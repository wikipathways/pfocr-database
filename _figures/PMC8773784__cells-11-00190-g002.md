caption: Activation of inflammasome-dependent and independent mechanisms in cystinosis.
  In vitro, in cultured monocytes, cystine crystals act as an NLRP3 agonist. Inflammasome
  activation requires two signals. Signal 1 is triggered by PAMPs or DAMPs through
  TLR/NLR activation and leads to NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation of inflammasome
  components, including NLRP3, and IL-1β.Signal 2 is triggered by cystine crystals
  phagocytosis, causing K+ efflux leading to hypokalemia, oxidative stress activation
  by ROS, or lysosomal rupture, and leads to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  which ultimately results in the cleavage and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines
  IL-1β and IL-18. A role for the cystine-loaded lysosome in activating inflammasomes
  has not been demonstrated. Inflammasome-independent mechanisms have also been described
  in human cystinotic PTECs, in which markedly high levels of NLRP2 have been observed.
  NLRP2 amplifies pro-inflammatory and profibrotic responses through activation of
  the NF-κB signaling pathway. CXCL5, C-X-C motif chemokine 5; DAMPs, damage-associated
  molecular patterns; IL, interleukin; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1;

  family pyrin domain containing 3; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLRs, Toll-like receptors.
