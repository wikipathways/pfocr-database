caption: The committed step of Taxol (paclitaxel) biosynthesis is catalyzed by taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene
  synthase (TS), a diterpene cyclase responsible for transforming the ubiquitous isoprenoid
  intermediate geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) to the parent olefin with a taxane
  skeleton. Taxadiene is then functionalized by a series of eight CYP-mediated oxygenations,
  three CoA-dependent acylations, and several other transformations en route to baccatin
  III, to which the side chain at C13 is appended to afford final product Taxol. Besides
  Taxol, Taxus species produce about 400 different taxoids, all of which are based
  upon the unique taxane skeleton. Xylosyltransferases (XYLTs) catalyze the addition
  of xylosyl group to 10-deacetylpaclitaxel (10-DAT), 10-deacetylcephalomannine (10-DAC),
  and other 10-deacetyl taxoids transformed from 10-deacetyl baccatin III (10-DAB).
  These taxoid metabolites may represent defense compounds, and they also constitute
  significant side-routes that divert pathway flux away from Taxol to decrease production
  yields of the target drug.
