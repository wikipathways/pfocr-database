caption: The host/pathogen cross-talk mechanism through core pathways at the early
  stage of C. difficile infection (CDI). (A) The secreted pathogenic factors of Clostridium
  difficile (C. difficile) and their induced cytopathic effect in Caco-2 cells; (B)
  the remedial schemes employed by host cells in response to C. difficile toxins;
  (C) offensive mechanisms via host-secreted reactive oxygen species (ROS), microRNA
  (miRNAs), and immune response, and thus the defense mechanism of C. difficile at
  the early stage of CDI. The red arrow lines denote transcriptional regulation; the
  gray solid lines indicate the protein–protein interaction; the green dot lines signify
  protein translation; the gray blue dash lines indicate protein secretion; and the
  purple clump with arrow and dash lines represent the activity of ROS. In (A), C.
  difficile toxins hijack a RAC1-related pathway to promote ROS production in host
  cells. The significant change of acetylation level of heat shock proteins (HSP90B1
  and HSPA5) and their interactions with toxins impair their chaperone-activity, resulting
  in the formation of misfolded protein and the induction of autophagy. As the remedial
  schemes for these injuries, in (B), Caco-2 cells employ the DNA damage response
  and autophagy to deplete the damage caused by pathogens, and innate immune response
  to remove the invasive bacterium. The alternative routes of these counter mechanisms
  and the miRNA silencing used by host cells to interfere with the activities of pathogen
  are also displayed in (C). Furthermore, the scheme in (C) shows the multiple pathways
  of C. difficile against the oxidative stress presented by Caco-2 cells.
