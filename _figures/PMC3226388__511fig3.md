caption: The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. Upstream
  signaling inputs such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt positively regulates
  mTORC1 by inhibiting the negative regulator tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1/TSC2.
  mTORC1 also senses amino acid sufficiency via Rag proteins, which serve to control
  the subcellular localization of mTORC1 independent of TSC. Two downstream targets
  of mTORC1, S6 kinase (S6K) and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), regulates a number
  of translation factors, thereby controlling mRNA translation at both initiation
  and elongation stages. eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; GβL, G-protein β-subunit-like
  (also known as mLST8, mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8); IGF, insulin-like
  growth factor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  PDCD4, programmed cell death protein 4; Rheb, Ras homologue enriched in brain.
