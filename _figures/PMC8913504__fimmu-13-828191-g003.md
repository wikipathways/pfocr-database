caption: The IL-2/IL-2R signaling pathways control the lineage choice of Th17 and
  Treg cells. The co-expression of IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ and γc is essential for IL-2 binding
  to cell. IL-2 regulation of Treg cells is mediated by the PI3K-Akt and JAK-STAT5
  pathway. JAK-STAT5 pathway promotes Treg cells differentiation, and inhibiting transcription
  of the IL-17, thereby suppressing Th17 cell. In addition, IL-2 can activate mTOR
  through PI3K-AKT and promote the differentiation of CD4+ T into Th17 cells. IL-2R,
  interleukin-2 receptor; P, phosphorylate; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase.
