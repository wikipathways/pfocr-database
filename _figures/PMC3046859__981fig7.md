caption: Metformin inhibits hypoxia-induced HIF-1α protein expression through the
  inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Metformin inhibits oxygen consumption and
  ATP production by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I. Subsequently, intracellular
  oxygen redistribution supplies oxygen for prolyl hydroxylase, which promotes the
  degradation of HIF-1α in the proteasome. ATP depletion caused by mitochondrial inhibition
  activates AMPK, which is a downstream signaling pathway of mitochondrial respiratory
  chain complex. Therefore, AICAR activates AMPK pathway but fails to inhibit hypoxia-induced
  HIF-1α accumulation.
