caption: Hypothesised regulation of extracellular matrix composition by the cilium
  and ciliary proteins. Matrix-degrading proteases such as ADAMTS-5 bind to the LRP-1
  receptor, which is polarised at the periciliary region in chondrocytes, possibly
  at the endocytosis-active structure, the ciliary pocket (CiPo). These enzymes are
  trafficked through the endosomal pathway to the lysosome (Lyso), where they are
  degraded. Recycling of the LRP-1 receptor to the ciliary/CiPo membrane may occur
  directly from the early endosome (EE) or via the recycling endosome (RE). Ciliary
  proteins have also been shown to regulate proteases at transcriptional level. The
  transcriptional effectors of the Hh pathway (GLIs), directly target genes encoding
  protease-regulating proteins such as TIMP-3, or interact with other transcription
  factors such as RUNX2 to regulate the expression of the protease itself. The Hh
  pathway could also interact with other pathways to regulate this process. Transcription
  of matrix components that determine the composition of the ECM occurs downstream
  of a calcium response triggered by the action of mechanosensitive receptors on the
  ciliary membrane, such as the polycystins PC1 and PC2. Proteins involved in intraflagellar
  transport (IFT), which mediates the trafficking of cargo from the cell body to the
  tip of the cilium and back via motor protein-driven IFT particles, have been linked
  to matrix secretion. IFT20 localises to the cis-Golgi, where it is anchored by the
  protein GMAP210, and could be involved in the targeting of proteins to the cilium
  via Arf4-driven trafficking and subsequent exocyst-mediated exocytosis. Exocytic
  and endocytic vesicles in the cytosol are transported by motor proteins along microtubules,
  which emanate from the main microtubule organising centre (MTOC) of the cell, the
  centrosome, at the base of the cilium. The mechanism by which IFT20 mediates this
  ciliary targeting, how it interacts with Arf4, and the extent of polarisation of
  matrix secretion at the cilium, are unknown. Positioning of the basal body at the
  plasma membrane, and therefore of the cilium and cellular processes that occur in
  the periciliary region, is influenced by the planar cell polarity (PCP pathway).
  PCP effectors such as Inturned and Fuzzy regulate the actin cytoskeleton, which
  in turn controls basal body polarisation.
