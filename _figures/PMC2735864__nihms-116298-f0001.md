caption: Binding of TNF-α (TNFSF1A) to TNF-R1 (TNFRSF1) at the cell surface results
  in receptor oligomerization and recruitment of signaling intermediates TRADD, TRAF2,
  TRAF5, and RIPK1, leading to the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. IKK
  is composed of two catalytic kinase subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) and one regulatory
  scaffold subunit (IKKγ or NEMO); IKKβ is the main kinase of the canonical pathway.
  IKK phosphorylates and promotes degradation of IκB, resulting in the release of
  NF-κB dimers, which can then translocate to the cell nucleus and bind to specific
  sequences in the promoter or enhancer regions of a large number of target inflammatory
  and other genes related to cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Key canonical
  pathway NF-κB dimers include NF-κB1 (p50), RelA (p65), and c-Rel.
