caption: '(A) The incompatible interaction between viral factors and host proteins
  or the members of non-functional viral susceptibility proteins, such as eIF, translation
  initiation factor; NLR, nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat; and RDR,
  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, can provide resistance to viruses by inhibiting viral
  multiplication. (B) A simplified mechanism showing antiviral silencing in which
  RDR creates an amplification loop in the process of RNA degradation, mediated by
  the dsRNA-specific endo-ribonuclease Dicer-like (DCL) family of proteins. DCLs detect
  and process dsRNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Argonaute (AGO) proteins
  play a major role in RNA silencing which further functions distinctively in transcriptional
  and post-transcriptional gene silencing. Viral suppressors for RNA silencing (VSR)
  repress RNA silencing, having evolved to be encoded by plant viruses to neutralize
  resistance mechanisms by antiviral silencing in plants. (C) Salicylic acid (SA)
  significantly induces the expression of RDR in the presence of TMV infections, which
  shows a critical link between RNA silencing and the nonexpressor of PR-1 (NPR1)-dependent
  SA signaling pathway. Abbreviations: COI, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE-1; JAZ, jasmonate
  ZIM domain; NSP, non-structural proteins.'
