caption: 'The analysis for enrichment pathway between Diet II vs I groups. A: Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis;
  B: Fatty acid degradation; C: Steroid biosynthesis; D: Tryptophan metabolism; E:
  β-alanine metabolism; F: Pyruvate metabolism; G: Retinol metabolism in animals;
  H: Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; I: PPAR signaling pathway; J: Peroxisome;
  K: Vitamin digestion and absorption. The proteins in green were down-regulated,
  proteins in red were up-regulated and in yellow some proteins were up-regulated
  and some were down-regulated.'
