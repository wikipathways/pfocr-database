caption: 'Hypothesized D. tertiolecta G11_7 mutant fatty acid metabolic pathways.
  Enzyme names and intermediates are abbreviated in the figure. Validated overexpressed
  gene‐coding enzymes are shown in red colour font sitting on the pathway lines. Validated
  significantly increased intermediates are surrounded by red solid line rectangles,
  and decreased intermediates are surrounded by green solid line rectangles. The increased/decreased
  intermediates with a fold change ≥2 or ≤−2 are shown in a filled rectangles with
  red/green colour. The general three sources of acetyl‐CoA are 1, β‐oxidation, 2,
  glycolysis and 3: amino acid catabolism. The specific core pathways use solid arrows
  for one‐step reactions and dash arrows for multiple‐step reactions. The DCA treatment‐related
  pathways have two critical enzymes, PDH and PDK in pink prismatic and grey trapezoid
  shapes, respectively. Note: The above showed enzyme and intermediate abbreviations
  are listed below: BCA2, branched‐chain amino acid aminotransferase; BCKDH, branched‐chain
  ketoacid dehydrogenase; IVD, isovaleryl‐CoA dehydrogenase; MCCB, 3‐methylcrotonyl‐CoA
  carboxylase beta unit; ACCA: acetyl‐CoA C‐acetyltransferase; AMX1, copper amine
  oxidase family protein. PDHC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase; FabD: malonyl‐CoA:acyl‐carrier‐protein transacylase; α‐KG, α‐ketoglutarate;
  Glu, Glutamate; Pro, Proline.'
