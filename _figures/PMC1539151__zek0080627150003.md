caption: The TPP biosynthetic pathway. TPP is composed of a thiazole and a pyrimidine
  moiety, each synthesized through a separate pathway. The thiazole branch is shaded
  in gray. The bacterial genes responsible for each step are shown, followed by the
  symbol •, ○, ▪, or □ indicating the presence of the gene in different algae (see
  Fig.  for the key). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Ga3P) and pyruvate (Pyr) are combined
  to form DXP in the thiazole branch, while 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide is converted
  to hydroxymethylpyrimidine diphosphate (HMP-PP) in the pyrimidine branch. Prokaryotes
  use the thiL gene product to convert thiamine monophosphate to TPP, while eukaryotes
  appear to dephosphorylate thiamine monophosphate before pyrophosphorylating thiamine
  with TPK.
