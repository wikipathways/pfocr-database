caption: 'Scheme of the phenylpropanoid pathway. The expression profiles of all pea
  genes, which are responsive to at least one treatment (P ≤ 0.05), involved in the
  phenylpropanoid pathway during early interaction with A. euteiches and P. pisi are
  shown in the tables in the figure. Numbers in the coloured boxes represent the fold
  change (FC) in expression. P6 and A6 correspond to FC at 6 hpi while P20 and A20
  correspond to FC at 20 hpi in response to P. pisi and A. euteiches, respectively,
  compared to mock-inoculated control samples. Asterisks indicate FC values that are
  differentially expressed (0.67 > FC > 1.5). The heat map goes from blue to red with
  increasing expression values. Arrows represent enzymatic reactions. The abbreviations
  marked in red indicate that at least one gene member of the family is differentially
  regulated at least in one treatment. Abbreviations: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase
  (PAL), cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamoyl-CoA
  reductase (CCR), shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase
  (COMT), cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), chalcone synthase (CHS), naringin
  3-dioxygenase (F3H), 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase (IFS), 2-hydroxyisoflavanone
  dehydratase (HID) and isoflavone O-methyltransferase (I7OMT)'
