caption: Proposed ABA Biosynthesis Pathway and Functions.The ABA biosynthesis steps
  that are expressed preferentially in leaves are highlighted in the box. It is likely
  that early ABA precursors have distinct functions in photosynthesis and light stress
  protection. It is not clear whether these ABA precursors are transported from leaves
  to petioles, stems, and roots. The expression of NCED3 and SDR1 is regulated differently.
  Xanthoxin needs to be exported from plastids to be converted to ABAld by SDR1 in
  the cytosol. The active sites of the GIN1 promoter are listed. New ABA functions
  presented in this study are listed in boldface.
