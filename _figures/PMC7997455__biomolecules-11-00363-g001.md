caption: 'Error-prone and error-free pathways of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair.
  When a DSB is formed, it is repaired through one of two major repair mechanisms:
  non-homologous end joining (NHEJ, left) and homologous recombination (HR, right).
  In the NHEJ pathway, the DNA ends associate with the Ku70/80 heterodimer and DNA-dependent
  protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), which further recruits Artemis, XRCC4,
  and Ligase IV to trim the DNA ends nucleolytically, fill in the DNA gap formed,
  and then ligate the two ends. NHEJ is a highly efficient DSB repair pathway, but
  it occasionally entails deletion or insertion of several nucleotides. In the HR
  pathway, PARP1 binds to the DSBs, and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex is recruited
  to the DSBs, followed by recruitment of CtIP and BRCA1/BARD1 to initiate DSB end
  resection. Extensive end resection is catalyzed by EXO1 and DNA2/BLM to yield long
  single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails, which become coated by replication protein A
  (RPA). The BRCA2/PALB2/BRCA1 complex facilitates replacement of RPA with RAD51.
  The RAD51–ssDNA filament seeks the homologous DNA sequence on its sister chromatid
  or on the homologous chromosome and catalyzes the formation of displacement loop
  (D-loop). DNA polymerization occurs by using the sister chromatid as a template,
  and the resolution of the resulting complex produces an accurate copy of the template.'
