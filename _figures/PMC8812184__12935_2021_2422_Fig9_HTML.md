caption: A The KEGG PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (cfa04151) []. The boxes are divided
  into three parts depicting DEGs in PAC, PAC metastasis, and TCC cell lines from
  left to right. With the exception of BCR, IRS1, CCND1 and BCL2, whose Ensembl identifiers
  (ENSCAFG00000013773, ENSCAFG00000010397, ENSCAFG00000010700 and ENSCAFG00000000068)
  were not recognized by the visualization tool, genes depicted in white were not
  considered expressed. The boxes on the left summarize the number of identified genes
  in the growth factors (GF), RTK, cytokines and receptors, focal adhesion and the
  chemokine signaling pathway which are differentially expressed in each histopathological
  classification (See Fig.  for details). B Western blot analysis using antibodies
  against PI3Kα, PI3K-p85, and Akt. Membranes were cut prior to antibody incubation
  and cropped to be displayed together. C Summary of the findings in the PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway
