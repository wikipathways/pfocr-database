caption: Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate
  pathway that results in the synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids. Cholesterol
  is the sole precursor for sex steroid biosynthesis and has been shown to increase
  tumour androgen signalling and stimulate tumour growth in mouse models of prostate
  cancer. In addition, cholesterol is a key component of lipid rafts, which facilitate
  intracellular signalling processes by serving as organizing centres for the assembly
  of signalling molecules, such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and IL-6. EGF
  and IL-6 activate the PI3K AKT and JAK–STAT pathways, respectively, enhancing the
  transcription of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. The mevalonate pathway
  can also support prostate tumour growth via non-cholesterol-mediated mechanisms.
  For example, resulting isoprenoids, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranyl pyrophosphate,
  facilitate recruitment of G-proteins Ras and Rho to the plasma membrane. High mevalonate
  levels suppress levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21), thereby
  promoting cell cycle progression via activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)
  activity. SREBPs, sterol-regulatory-element-binding proteins.
