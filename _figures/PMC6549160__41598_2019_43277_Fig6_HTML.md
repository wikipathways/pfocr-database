caption: Hypothetical signaling pathway related to heterogeneous cytoplasm-induced
  suppression of the multi-ovary gene. *Indicates differentially expressed parts in
  Mo_HC and Mu_NC. Mu_NC, F1 population derived from a cross between DUOII as female
  parent and TZI as male parent; Mo_HC, F1 population derived from a cross between
  TZI as female parent and DUOII as male parent.
