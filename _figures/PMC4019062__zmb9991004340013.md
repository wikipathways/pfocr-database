caption: Model for cell cycle control in Rb1ΔG/ΔG mutant cells. (A) Cell cycle regulation
  by the RB pathway in normal cells. pRB restricts E2F transcription to prevent Cdk2
  activation, negative feedback to pRB, and cell cycle advancement. (B) ΔG-pRB is
  responsive to p16 activation and, in the absence of regulation of E2F transcription
  factors, retains the ability to prevent cell cycle entry.
