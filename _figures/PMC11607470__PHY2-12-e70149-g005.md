caption: Schematic of the mechanism by which NBP attenuates I/R‐induced skeletal muscle
  injury. NBP may alleviate I/R‐induced skeletal muscle injury by activating the Sirt1/Nrf2
  signaling pathway and promoting the expression of Myog and MyoD, thereby exerting
  a protective effect during the progression of I/R‐induced skeletal muscle damage
