caption: EPA metabolome in the body. EPA is converted by COX or LOX, which leads to
  the formation of 3-series PGs or 5-series LTs. In addition, recent studies uncovered
  novel EPA metabolic pathway via omega-3 hydroxylation and epoxygenation, and found
  potent anti-inflammatory metabolites such as E-series Rvs and 12-OH-17,18-EpETE.
  These metabolic pathways may represent an endogenous mechanism acting as an anti-inflammatory
  cascade after dietary intake of EPA.
