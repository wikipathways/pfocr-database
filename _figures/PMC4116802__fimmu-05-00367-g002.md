caption: Inflammation induces B cell activation. TLR activation by nucleic acid–protein
  complexes derived from inflammation and MYD88 mutation B cell antigen receptor (BCR)
  delivers nucleic acids–protein complexes to TLR-containing endosomes, where MYD88
  initiates the activation of intracellular signaling pathways, such as NFκB. Intriguingly,
  oncogenic MYD88 mutations require intact TLR apparatuses to recognize nucleic acids.
  One of the potential sources for TLR ligands is nucleic acid–protein complexes derived
  from inflammation and chronic infection. A subset of ABC-DLBCL shows constitutively
  activation of JAK-STAT3 pathway, presumably due to autocrine stimulation by IL-6
  and IL-10. The activation of cytokine receptor signaling can also be induced by
  inflammatory cytokines in the milieu of inflammation and chronic infection.
