caption: Immune response induced by DTMUV infection and its immune evasion. RIG-I-like
  receptors (RLRs) such as RIG-I and MDA5 can recognize the DTMUV genomic RNA and
  trigger signaling cascades through the adaptor protein MAVS, inducing the production
  of interferons (IFNs). DTMUV RNA activates the STING pathway and induces TBK1-IRF-3-mediated
  IFN expression. The IFN-mediated Janus-STAT signaling pathway induces abundant expression
  of various ISGs, including Mx1, OAS1, IFITM3, and OASL, which can inhibit DTMUV
  replication. To date, DTMUV has evolved multiple mechanisms to evade host immune
  responses, involving interactions between various viral proteins and host immune
  signaling pathways, including NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4B, and NS5
