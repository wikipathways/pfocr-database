caption: 'APP is a type I transmembrane protein that is the substrate for several
  cleaving enzyme complexes known as secretases. In the amyloidogenic pathway (right),
  APP is cleaved at the β-secretase site by BACE1, releasing a large N-terminal domain
  of APP (termed sAPP-β). The remaining membrane-bound CTF (termed APP β-CTF) undergoes
  subsequent intramembranous cleavage by the β-secretase complex to release the Aβ
  peptide (of various numbers of amino acids in length). Secreted Aβ exists in monomeric,
  dimeric and likely several oligomeric forms. The remaining membrane-associated fragment
  (AICD) has been shown to translocate to the nucleus where it exerts signaling functions.
  In the nonamyloidogenic pathway (left), APP is cleaved at the α-secretase site within
  the Aβ sequence itself by another proteolytic complex, releasing a slightly longer
  N-terminal domain of APP (termed sAPP-α). The remaining membrane-bound CTF (termed
  APP α-CTF) undergoes subsequent intramembranous cleavage by the γ-secretase complex,
  releasing a nonamyloidigenic fragment of the Aβ peptide, termed P3. Not pictured,
  yet germane to the topic of upcoming CSF biomarkers of AD, is SorLA/sLR11, a neuronal
  receptor for APP that controls its intracellular transport and processing, blocking
  both the amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic pathways, and S100A7/psoriasin, a calcium-binding
  protein shown to promote α-secretase cleavage via effects on ADAM-10, an enzyme
  with known α-secretase activity.Aβ: β-amyloid; aa: Amino acid; AICD: APP intracellular
  domain; CTF: C-terminal fragment.'
