caption: Schematic model of signaling pathways implicated in tumor cell VM. Only signaling
  molecules that have been specifically modulated using antisense oligonucleotides,
  small inhibitory RNAs, blocking antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, or transient
  transfections, with demonstrated ability to directly affect VM, are depicted. These
  molecules are categorized as vascular (red), embryonic/stem cell (green), tumor
  microenvironment (purple), and hypoxia signaling pathways (blue). Molecules shaded
  with two different colors demonstrate overlap between major VM signaling pathways.
  Involvement of Gal-3, IL-8, cAMP, and EPAC 1/Rap1 in VM has been previously reviewed
  by Seftor et al. Question marks indicate the potential involvement of a protein
  and/or downstream effector protein or proteins in modulating VM in aggressive cancer
  cells, for which the underlying signaling pathway or pathways are not yet clearly
  defined. EP3, prostaglandin E receptor EP3 subtype (encoded by PTGER3).
