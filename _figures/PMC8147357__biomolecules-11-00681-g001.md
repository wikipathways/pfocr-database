caption: 'The mTOR signaling pathway. In response to insulin stimuli, IGFR activates
  the IRS that leads to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt. Activated Akt phosphorylates
  TSC2 to suppress its inhibitory effect on Rheb-GTP recycling from Rheb-GDP that
  is required for mTOR activation. Rheb-GTP can then activate the mTORC1 complex (mTOR,
  Raptor and GβL) to exert control over protein synthesis by phosphorylating 4E-BP
  and P70S6K, which are two key regulators of ribosome assembly. Under periods of
  cellular stress such as hypoxia, low ATP, or DNA damage, AMP kinase acts to inhibit
  mTORC1 by activating the TSC2 protein in human cells. The mTORC2 complex can be
  activated at its regulator subunit mSin1 by Akt or by PI3K-generated PIP3. Activated
  mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt in a positive feedback loop. Abbreviations are: IGFR,
  Insulin growth factor receptor; IRS, Insulin receptor substrate; PI3K, Phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; PTEN, Phosphatase and tensin homolog; PIP2, Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate;
