caption: Figure 1. Proposed schema of anti-tumor immunity following DNA vaccination
  with DKK1/defensin-2 DNA fusion vaccine. Following intramuscular injection in mice
  of DKK1/defensin-2 DNA fusion vaccine, muscle and resident APCs are transfected
  with plasmid, leading to fusion protein production. Murine defensin-2 plays a role
  in activating APCs via CCL-6 and TLR4. Cross-priming occurs in which CD8+ T cell
  responses are primed by exogenous MHC Class I–restricted antigens that are not expressed
  in, but rather are acquired by, local APCs. These DCs (dendritic cells) acquire
  antigen, express CCR7, and are attracted by chemokines expressed in the draining
  lymph nodes, where they prime naive T cells. DKK1 is processed, and peptides are
  presented by MHC Class I molecules; this peptide/MHC Class I complex stimulates
  CD8+ T lymphocytes. Soluble protein released by transfected cells is taken up by
  DCs, and via the MHC Class II pathway, the peptide/MHC Class II complex stimulates
  CD4+ T lymphocytes, and MHC Class II-binding peptides from DKK1 activate the large
  repertoire of anti-DKK1 CD4+ T cells. Pairs of receptor–ligands (matched colors)
  interact to 'license' the DCs to maintain presentation of tumor-derived peptides
  that are able to prime anti-tumor CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. CpGs interact with TLR9
  in APCs, where they induce the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD80
  and CD86, MHC Class II molecules, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. B7H1-blocking
  antibodies interrupt T-cell immunosuppression through PD-1/B7 family signaling.
  OX40-agonist antibodies might affect the roles of Treg cells through OX40 signaling
  since mouse Treg cells constitutively express OX40. Therefore, DKK1 DNA vaccine
  plus CpG combined with B7H1-blocking or OX40-agonist antibodies could break the
  immunosuppression of T-cell response and lead to much better anti-tumor immunity
  induced by the vaccine. TCR, T-cell receptor.
