caption: Summary of mechanisms by which exosomes from cyclic stretch-exposed PDL cells
  negatively regulate IL-1β production in macrophages. The treatment of macrophages
  with LPS activates NF-κB signaling via TLR4 (Signal 1), and induces the expression
  of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. NLRP3 inflammasome components, which consist of NLRP3, apoptotic
  speck-like protein (ASC), and caspase-1, are assembled after being exposed to nigericin
  (Signal 2), and induce the activation of caspase-1, which leads to the production
  of IL-1β and pyroptosis. Exosomes from cyclic stretch-exposed PDL cells inhibit
  the activation of NF-κB signaling without affecting the binding activity of LPS
  to macrophages (Signal 1), but do not interfere with Signal 2, which is followed
  by the negative regulation of IL-1β production and pyroptosis.
