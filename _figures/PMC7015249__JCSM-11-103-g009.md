caption: Proposed mechanism of serum amyloid A 1 (SAA1) induced muscle atrophy. SAA1
  binds to muscular Toll‐like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, which results in an activation
  of the canonical NF‐κB p65 pathway leading to NF‐κB p65/RelA phosphorylation and
  its translocation into the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF‐κB p65/RelA binds to NF‐κB
  response elements (NRE), which leads to increased expression and secretion of the
  pro‐inflammatory cytokine Il6. IL6 in turn induces expression and secretion of SAA1
  resulting in a positive feedback loop. In addition, SAA1 causes an increase of MuRF1/Trim63
  and Atrogin1/Fbxo32, which mediate muscle atrophy in sepsis. Anti‐TLR2 or anti‐TLR4
  antibodies inhibit SAA1‐induced Il6 expression. The specific IκB kinase subunit
  IKK‐2 inhibitor BMS‐345541 inhibits SAA1‐induced and NF‐κB dependent gene expression,
  thereby reducing SAA1‐mediated atrophy and inhibiting the self‐augmenting SAA1‐IL6
  feedback loop.
