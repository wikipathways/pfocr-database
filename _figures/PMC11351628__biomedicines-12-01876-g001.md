caption: PPAR targets and contributing factors in MASLD/MASH. C1Q and collagen domain
  containing adiponectin (ADIPOQ) is a key insulin regulator whose secretion from
  the adipose tissue into the liver is regulated by PPARγ. Insulin regulates SREBP-1C
  via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the liver. PPARα regulates the essential glycolytic
  enzymes ACC and FAS that play key roles in the synthesis of TGs. ChREBP is also
  involved in TG synthesis. LPL and APOC3 promote TG hydrolyzation into FAs. CPT1/2,
  SLC27A1, ACAD, HMGCS2, and EHHADH are involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation. In
  the presence of ACC, acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA (de novo lipogenesis).
  Peroxisomal β-oxidation is enhanced via ACOX and DGAT1/2. Excess TG is transported
  to adipose tissue by VLDL facilitated by the expression of apolipoproteins, APOE
  and APOC2, and MTTP. In adipose tissues, FAs are converted into TGs via FABP4, CD36,
  LPL, MOGAT1, and FSP27. FA accumulation can cause autophagy controlled by ATA and
  TFEB. In MASH, downregulation of TGF-β, TNF-α, and MCP1 levels triggers hepatic
  inflammation, which subsequently activates the hepatic stellate cells and can lead
  to fibrosis
