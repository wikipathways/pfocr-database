caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) and type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathways.
  A, Induction of type I IFN production in cells. Viral nucleic acids are detected
  by TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9. TLR3 activation results in signaling through the Toll–interleukin
  (IL)–1R domain–containing adapter-inducing IFN-β (TRIF)–dependent or nuclear factor
  (NF)–κβ essential modulator (NEMO)–dependent pathway. Activation of TLRs 7, 8, and
  9 results in signaling through the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)–dependent
  pathway. Transcription factors, IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3, IRF7, or NF-κβ, initiate
  transcription of IFN genes in the nucleus. IKK, inhibitor of NF-kB kinase subunit
  alpha or beta; IkB, inhibitor of kB; IRAK-4, IL-1R–associated kinase; RIG-1, retinoic
  acid–inducible gene 1; TRAF3, tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3.;
  TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1. RIG 1 is a cytosolic virus sensor. B, Response of cells
  to IFN. IFNs bind to the IFN receptor and initiate signaling through the signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway to induce transcription
  of IFN-stimulated genes that inhibit viral replication. Mutations in shaded genes
  have been associated with severe HSV infections, including herpes simplex encephalitis
  (HSE). Mutations in TYK-2, tyrosine kinase 2, have not been associated with HSE.
