caption: Models depicting the multifaceted role of Mte1 in RF repair and CO promotion.
  (A) The role of Mte1 in Mph1-mediated RF repair. (TLS) Translesion DNA synthesis;
  (TS) template switch; (DHJ) double HJ. For review, see ). (B) During HR, Mte1 promotes
  CO formation by channeling the Rad51-made D-loop intermediate into the DSBR pathway.
  For review, see ).
