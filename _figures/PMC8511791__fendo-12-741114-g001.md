caption: (A) The classical paradigm of T2D glycemic control maintains a cause-effect
  relationship between insulin resistance, secretion and clearance. However, the cause-effect
  paradigm is still unresolved (symbolized by question marks) in terms of molecular
  modes-of-mediation. The three effectors of T2D are proposed here to be concomitantly
  driven by an upstream primary hyperactive mTORC1. mTORC1 may be hyper-activated
  by growth factors (e.g., insulin), nutrients excess (e.g., glucose, leucine), or
  inflammation (e.g., NFkB/IKK), while being suppressed by metabolic stress. (B) Hyperactive
  mTORC1 may concomitantly drive peripheral insulin resistance, beta cells insulin
  hypersecretion and failure, and suppression of hepatic insulin clearance. Thus,
  hyperactive mTORC1 drives insulin resistance by disrupting the IR-Akt transduction
  pathway resulting in glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, inhibition of glucose uptake
  and adipose lipolysis. mTORC1 activation by the insulin-IR-Erk transduction pathway
  allows for sustained activation of mTORC1 by insulin upon disrupting the insulin-IR-Akt
  transduction pathway. Hyperactivation of beta cells mTORC1 serves as double-edged
  driver, allowing for insulin hypersecretion, while concomitantly promoting beta
  cells ER stress and apoptosis. Hepatic hyperactive mTORC1 suppresses hepatic insulin
  clearance.
