caption: Signaling pathways involved in radiation-induced apoptosis. After being induced
  by radiation, the initiation of apoptosis is mainly activated by two different pathways,
  intrinsic and extrinsic, both of which ultimately complete apoptosis by activating
  the execution pathway. Additionally, ionizing radiation can promote apoptosis in
  other two ways, P53 and SAPK/JNK pathways.
