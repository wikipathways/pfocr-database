caption: Proposed mechanism for formation of Hb monoadducts and cross-links derived
  from the S-oxidase and β-lyase metabolic pathways of DCVC. For S-oxidase pathway,
  globin monoadduct formation includes DCVCS, DCVCS-GSH, NA-DCVCS, and NA-DCVCS-GSH
  and globin cross-link formation involves DCVCS and NA-DCVCS as cross-linkers. For
  β-lyase pathway, globin monoadduct and cross-link formation involves sulfur- and
  oxygen (formed upon hydrolysis)-containing reactive intermediates. aMonoadducts
  (types 2 and 4) can also arise by initial conjugation with GSH followed by Hb. Hb
  is used here to describe general types of adducted globins without specification
  of which globin chain is involved.
