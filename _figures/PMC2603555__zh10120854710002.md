caption: 'Schematic summary of 13C-NMR technique for measurement of pyruvate cycling.
  The technique involves incubation of β-cell lines with [U-13C6]glucose, extraction
  of glutamate and analysis of 13C isotopomers by 13C-NMR spectroscopy. Shown for
  example are spectra of carbon-2 of glutamate simulated using tcaSim (, , ) under
  two idealized situations. Top: the spectrum obtained if pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
  is the sole pathway for pyruvate to enrich α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and glutamate
  (20% unlabeled endogenous substrate is also assumed). Bottom: the spectrum obtained
  when PDH and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) flux contribute equally to pyruvate entry
  into the TCA cycle. Several changes in the glutamate isotopomer populations occur
  as result of PC activity. For example, notice that carboxylation of pyruvate by
  PC leads to the loss of enrichment in the C1 position and a dramatic increase in
  the isotopomer population detected as a D23 multiplet. In experimental data, the
  isotopomer populations determined by the 13C-NMR multiplets of all glutamate carbons
  are used to calculate relative flux through the oxidative (PDH) and anaplerotic
  (PC) entry points into the TCA cycle. It is assumed that pyruvate cycling is equivalent
  to PC flux. See text and refs. , , and  for more details.'
