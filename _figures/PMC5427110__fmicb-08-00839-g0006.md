caption: Proposed model for the involvement of RpoN in the regulation of tobramycin
  tolerance in the stationary growth (A) and logarithmic phase growth (B) in nutrient-rich
  medium. (A) RpoN stimulates the expression of the genes involved in the translation
  apparatus and positively affects the synthesis of ribosome components. Upon exposure
  to tobramycin, RpoN counteracts the negative effects of tobramycin on translation
  by increasing the expression of relA, which in turn produces the effector of the
  stringent response, ppGpp. ppGpp promotes survival in the presence of tobramycin
  by inducing translational inactivity and affecting the growth rate. The translational
  inactivity produced by ppGpp blocks tobramycin from exerting its effect on the ribosome
  and consequently leads to tobramycin tolerance. In addition, RpoN positively affects
  the expression of rpoS in the presence of tobramycin and employs RsmA to overcome
  the effect of tobramycin, likely by increasing the mRNA stability of a gene potentially
  involved in tobramycin tolerance. RpoN increases the expression of gacA in response
  to tobramycin, which probably occurs through a ppGpp-dependent pathway. (B) During
  the logarithmic phase of growth, RpoN employs the RpoS-dependent pathway, which
  in turn activates additional stress-response genes promoting the survival to tobramycin.
  RpoN profoundly downregulates the expression of rsmA in response to tobramycin.
  Furthermore, RpoS negatively affects the expression of gacA in the presence of tobramycin.
  The mutant deficient in rpoN and rpoS demonstrates (i) the loss of tobramycin-mediated
  inhibition of relA expression, (ii) a consequent increase in ppGpp production, and
  (iii) suggests ppGpp-dependent upregulation of gacA, which together lead to tobramycin
  tolerance. The detailed regulation network is described in the Discussion. OM, outer
  membrane; PS, periplasmic space; IM, inner membrane; TOB, tobramycin; → represents
  positive control; ⊥ represents negative control.
