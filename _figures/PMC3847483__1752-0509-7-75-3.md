caption: 'The reconstructed pathway of the sucrose synthesis process in cassava presented
  on the SmartDraw platform. The number in the orange boxes denotes the EC number
  of the enzymes which is possibly a product of the genes below, denoted as the 12-digit
  ID. The colored dots beside each gene ID indicate the plant templates from which
  the genes were annotated: green – Arabidopsis, red – maize, pink – rice, violet
  – castor bean, and orange – potato. The background colors of the dots represent
  the matching quality of the sequence alignment: highest in yellow to lower in blue
  and the lowest in white. The following two columns describe the match (MS) and conservation
  (CS) scores, respectively.'
