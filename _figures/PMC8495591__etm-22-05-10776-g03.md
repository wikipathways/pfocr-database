caption: Potential mechanisms of TGF-β1/Smads-dependent regulation of SnoN during
  DN. TGF-β1 is involved in the regulation of fibrosis, and TGF-β1/Smads is the canonical
  pathway for its biological functions. In a high-glucose environment, cells secrete
  TGF-β1, leading to the phosphorylation of Smads, which form a complex to regulate
  the expression of SnoN. During the occurrence and development of DN, the level of
  SnoN protein may be reduced through UPS-mediated degradation of SnoN protein, reversing
  the transcriptional activation of SnoN. TGF-β1 mediates E3 ubiquitin ligase and
  induces SnoN protein degradation. Thus, the amount of SnoN protein in renal tubular
  epithelial cells depends on the balance between these two effects. Both processes
  are mediated by the TGF-β1/Smads/SnoN signaling pathway, which leads to the fibrosis
  amplification, promoting the occurrence and development of DN. TGF-β1, transforming
  growth factor β1; SnoN, Ski-related novel protein N; Smurf2, Smad ubiquitin regulatory
