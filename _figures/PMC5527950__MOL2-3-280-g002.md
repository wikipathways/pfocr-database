caption: The internalization routes influence signaling output. (A) CME promotes sustained
  signaling, while NCE target cargos to degradation. EGFR and TGF‐β receptors enter
  cells either via CME or raft‐dependent, NCE pathways. EGFR and TGF‐β entering through
  CME are efficiently recycled. This trafficking route is coupled to sustained and
  spatially restricted signaling. Raft‐mediated internalization mainly targets these
  receptors to degradation leading to signal attenuation (Le Roy and Wrana, 2005).
  Ubiquitination of the receptors mediated by the E3 ligases Smad7 (Di Guglielmo et al.,
  2003) or CBL (Sorkin and Goh, 2009) for TGF‐β and EGFR, respectively preferentially
  direct these cargos toward degradative pathways, indicating that this posttranslational
  modification might be critical to determine receptor fate and signaling outcome,
  albeit the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for this routing are ill‐defined.
  The cycle of internalization and recycling associated to CME is thought to be essential
  to spatially restrict signaling leading to directional migration and chemotaxis.
  (B) NCE promotes signal activation, while CME signal attenuation. The Wnt family
  of secreted ligands binds to the seven transmembrane‐spanning receptors of the Frizzled‐type
  and to the Low Density Receptor‐related protein (LRPs) (Kikuchi et al., 2007). Among
  Wnt ligands, Wnt3a can bind to its co‐receptor LRP6, promoting its raft‐mediated
  internalization and signaling. In the presence of Wnt3a, LRP6 is phosphorylated
  and internalized into a raft‐dependent, caveolin‐positive vesicular compartment,
  where it can stabilize β‐catenin and transduce the signal. Phosphorylation does
  not require the trafficking of the receptor to the caveolin‐1 positive compartment
  (where its kinase, CK1 g, is found) (Yamamoto et al., 2008). Conversely, signal
  transduction (i.e., β‐catenin stabilization) requires both phosphorylation and endocytosis,
  suggesting that endosomes may become critical signaling platform. LRP6 can also
  bind a Wnt3a antagonist, Dickkopf (Dkk), which diverts it from the caveolin to the
  Clathrin pathway, preventing the encounter of the receptor with its kinase, its
  phosphorylation and β‐catenin stabilization.
