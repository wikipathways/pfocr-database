caption: Simplified schematic showing the proposed mechanism of how SEs may suppress
  cellular immunity and antitumor responses. (A) In contrast to benign T cells, malignant
  T cells typically express a monoclonal TCR Vβ chain and often exhibit decreased
  expression or function of the TCR complex. SEs may therefore in many cases not stimulate
  malignant T cells directly but rather indirectly through activation of benign T
  cells. (B) Upon colonization with enterotoxin-producing SA bacteria, SEs bind MHC-II
  molecules expressed on malignant T cells, benign T cells, and antigen-presenting
  cells. SEs bound to MHC-II molecules subsequently crosslink TCRs on benign T cells,
  which elicits cell-cell contact–dependent interactions between the benign and malignant
  T cells and triggers secretion of IL-2 from the benign T cells. (C) These signals
  in turn induce high expression of IL-10 from the malignant T cells via a Jak3/Stat3-dependent
  pathway. IL-10 secreted from the malignant T cells can dampen cellular immunity
  by several means. For example, IL-10 impairs the maturation of dendritic cells,
  represses the expression of Th1 cytokines (interferon-γ, IL-12), inhibits T-cell
  activation, and promotes the function of regulatory T cells as well as the development
  of immunoregulatory M2 macrophages (MΦ), collectively contributing to suppression
  of cellular immunity and antitumor immune responses. The malignant T cells, however,
  display deficient expression of IL-10R and are therefore protected against the suppressive
  effects of IL-10. DC, dendritic cell; IFN-γ, interferon-γ.
