caption: The Wnt signaling pathways. In the absence of Wnt signal, the destruction
  complex constituted by Axin, adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC), and glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β (GSK3β) leads to phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β in the cytoplasm.
  The phosphorylated β-catenin is subsequently ubiquitinated by β-TrCP and targeted
  for proteasomal degradation. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is activated by
  upon binding of Wnt to its Frizzled (Frz) receptor and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 6 (LRP6) co-receptor. LRP6 phosphorylated by cyclin-Y/CDK14 complex, GSK3β,
  and casein kinase 1γ (CK1γ) recruits the destruction complex and Dishevelled (Dsh,
  Dvl in mammals) to the plasma membrane. Dvl is activated through polymerization,
  inhibiting the destruction complex. This results in accumulation of unphosphorylated
  β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus, leading
  to cell proliferation. In the non-canonical Wnt/calcium pathway, calmodulin-bound
  CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) negatively regulates the
  canonical β-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling through phosphorylation of TCF, which inhibits
  β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription
