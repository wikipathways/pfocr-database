caption: Pathways through which E. siraeum regulates fat deposition. E. siraeum reduces
  fecal tyrosine levels in mice, consequently decreasing blood tyrosine levels. Tyrosine
  acts as a cofactor in the ATP-ADP conversion reaction, providing phosphate groups
  to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Reduced tyrosine levels diminish the phosphorylation
  level of RTKs, subsequently reducing phosphorylation of the PI3K-AKT pathway and
  mTORC1. This ultimately leads to a decrease in mRNA transcription levels and lipid
  synthesis in fat adipocytes. As white adipose tissue is responsible for secreting
  leptin and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, the suppression of white adipose tissue
  results in a corresponding decrease in leptin and IL-6 levels
