caption: Metabolic pathway and regulation visualized by Kyoto encyclopedia of genes
  and genomes (KEGG) under nitrate-deprived stress. Direct connections between the
  metabolites are indicated with solid line arrows, and putative connections between
  the metabolites are indicated with dash line arrows. The red words in red solid
  line boxes represent an increase in the abundance of the responding biomarkers,
  the blue words in blue dash line boxes represent a decrease in the abundance, and
  the black words represent no significant change. The percentages represent the change
  rates of the biomarkers by up- or down-regulation.
