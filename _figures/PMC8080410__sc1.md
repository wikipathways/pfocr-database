caption: The formation of co-assembled, self-adjuvanting peptide hydrogel vaccine
  with nanofiber structures and vaccination-mediated E. G7-OVA lymphoma immunotherapy.
  (A) Peptide conjugates chemically coupled with antigen epitopes were mixed in water
  to induce the spontaneous supramolecular co-assembly of nanofibrious hydrogel. (B)
  Subcutaneous vaccination of peptide hydrogel vaccines. Vaccines were uptaken by
  host DCs, processed and presented to naïve T cells, which differentiated into CD8
  T and CD4 T helper cells. Effector CD8 cytotoxic T cells would capture and eradicate
  tumor cells along with the secretion of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). (C) The activation
  of MyD88-dependent NF-κB signaling pathway in DCs.
