caption: Figure 1. Models of mechanical stretch activation of JAK kinases and STAT
  proteins. Conformational model. Mechanical stretch is postulated to induce conformational
  changes in the gp130 and AT1 receptors that expose binding sites for JAK2 kinases
  and Gαq proteins, respectively. It is unclear how or if gp130 dimerizes in order
  to allow JAK2 kinase cross-phosphorylation. The AT1 receptor acting as a stretch
  receptor will activate the RAS/MEK/ERK/p38 pathway leading to upregulation of the
  angiotensinogen gene. The transcription factor activated by p38 or ERK1/2 has not
  been identified. Paracrine model. Mechanical stretch initiates signal transducer
  association with receptors as in conformational model. Continued signaling after
  mechanical stretch exhaustion is performed by Ang II produced in response to stretch-activated
  AT1 receptors to give autocrine signaling as well as paracrine signaling. Ang II-activated
  cardiac fibroblasts produce IL-6 family cytokines that activate the canonical JAK-STAT
  pathway in cardiomyocytes via paracrine signaling thereby maintaining the post-mechanical
  stretch hypertrophic state.
