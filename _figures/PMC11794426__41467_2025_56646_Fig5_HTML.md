caption: a Raw and suppression-corrected (SC) peak intensities across chromatographic
  systems and uncleaned and cleaned ionization source conditions. b Metabolic pathways
  determined by ICMS before and after ion suppression correction. c Metabolic pathways
  determined by RPLC-MS before and after ion suppression correction. Data were drawn
  in SBGN (system biology graphical notation), Process Description (PD) and Activity
  Flow (AF) languages or Simple Interaction Format (SIF). Metabolites are color-coded
  based on the percent peak intensity. Raw = 12C raw; SC = 12C suppression corrected;
  Uncleaned+ uncleaned positive ion mode, clean+ clean positive ion mode, uncleaned-
  uncleaned negative ion mode, cleaned- cleaned negative ion mode. BCAA branched chain
  amino acid, PPP pentose phosphate pathway. Colors represent percent peak intensity
  as indicated by the color bar
