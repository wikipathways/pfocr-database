caption: Model of BACE1-AS in the regulation of the propagation of C. parvum. BACE1-AS
  is likely downregulated by the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in HCT-8
  cells following C. parvum infection. BACE1-AS can sponge miR6805-5p to upregulate
  the level of IRF3, and then downregulation of BACE1-AS leads to downregulation of
  IRF3. Downregulated IRF3 can upregulate BCL2 to decrease the apoptosis level of
  cells, thus promoting the propagation of C. parvum
