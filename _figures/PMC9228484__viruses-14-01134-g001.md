caption: 'JUNV entry to the cell. JUNV uses hTrf1 (human Transferrin receptor 1) as
  its main receptor to enter the cell, but, under certain constraints, it utilizes
  alternative ports of entry. As noncanonical receptors, JUNV uses: (i) hTIM-1 phosphatidylserine
  receptor; (ii) lectin receptors, such as hDC-SIGN and hL-SIGN; (iii) voltage-gated
  calcium channels (VGCCs). Thereafter, JUNV is internalized through a clathrin-mediated
  endocytic pathway, which is dependent on dynamin II and EPS15 proteins, and the
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is early activated. Then, JUNV travels through the cellular
  endocytic pathway, specifically from Rab5-early (pH = 6.2–6.5) to Rab7-late (pH
  = 5.0–6.0) endosomes. Endosomal acidification is a necessary event to fulfill virus
  internalization and vacuolar-proton ATPases (V-ATPases), which acidify endosomes
  by pumping protons across membranes, strongly contributing to this process. Low
  pH triggers conformational changes in the arenavirus glycoprotein (GP), resulting
  in the exposure of a specific motif within the GP2 subunit that mediates fusion
  of the virion with host cell membranes. This enables the release of the viral content
  into the cytoplasm. TIM-1: T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain 1; hDC-SIGN: human
  dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin;
  hL-SIGN: liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin; EPS15: epidermal
  growth factor receptor substrate 15.'
