caption: Simulation of metabolic flux changes in the central metabolism of the redox
  reaction manipulated strains. In each case, all fluxes were expressed in molar percentage
  of the corresponding glucose uptake rate. The red lines indicated reactions with
  NADP(H) as cofactor, the thin blue lines indicated reactions with NAD(H) as cofactor,
  the green lines indicated ATP generating/consuming reactions, the thick blue lines
  indicated the redox synthesis pathway of succinate, the dot lines indicated the
  transportation reactions from intracellular to extracellular. 1,3DPG 3-phospho-glyceroyl
