caption: Top Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) interactome derived from transcriptional
  regulators found in the Vesiclepedia database. Proteins clustered within the Top
  Networks/Associated Functions as derived from IPA algorithms are shown as members
  of this interactome, which was entitled “Gene Expression, Cell Cycle, Infectious
  Disease.” Details of the symbols and edges are described in the legend for Figure
  .
