caption: Schematic representation of IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and oleocanthal-mediated
  inhibition. This schematic represents the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and highlights
  the inhibitory role of OC, a natural phenolic compound. The pathway begins with
  IL-6 binding to its receptor complex (GP-80 and GP-130), leading to the activation
  of JAK1/2 kinases. This activation phosphorylates STAT3, which then translocates
  to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. The downstream effects include the promotion
  of cancer cell progression (Cyclin D1), apoptosis resistance (Bcl-2), and invasion
  (MMP2)
