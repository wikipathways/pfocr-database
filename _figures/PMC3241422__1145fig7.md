caption: The CWI pathway transcriptional program. The majority of genes regulated
  by CWI signaling are under the control of the Rlm1 transcription factor, which is
  phosphorylated and activated by Mpk1. Among these genes is MLP1, which encodes a
  pseudokinase paralog of Mpk1. Using a mechanism that is independent of protein kinase
  catalytic activity, Mpk1, together with Mlp1, drive expression of a subset of cell
  wall stress-induced genes through the Swi4/Swi6 transcription factor (including
  FKS2).
