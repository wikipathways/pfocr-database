caption: Breast cancer cell-based pathobiochemical pathways showing LPHN-induced activation
  of PKCα, which triggers the translocation of Tim-3 and galectin-9 onto the cell
  surface which is required for immune escape. The interaction of FLRT3 with LPHN
  isoform leads to the activation of PKCα, most likely through the classic Gq/PLC/Ca2+pathway.
  Ligand-bound LPHN activates Gq, which in turn stimulates PLC. This leads to phosphatidyl-inositol-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) degradation and production of inositol-trisphospate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG). PKCα is then activated by DAG and cytosolic Ca2+. PKCα provokes the formation
  of SNARE complexes that tether vesicles to the plasma membrane. Galectin-9 impairs
  the cancer cell killing activity of cytotoxic T cells (and other cytotoxic lymphocytes).
  Possible (not directly confirmed) interactions of galectin-9 with glycoside component
  and T cell receptor (TCR)/CD8, with MHC I, and antigen are highlighted with question
  mark “?” to indicate the fact that it is a hypothetic interaction, since TALL-104
  cells used in the study kill tumor cells in MHC-independent manner ().
