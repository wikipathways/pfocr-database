caption: The OADHC-dependent pathways of the lysine and tryptophan catabolism, interacting
  with NAD metabolism. Lysine condenses with 2-oxoglutarate into saccharopine leading
  to 2-oxoadipate, whose oxidative decarboxylation by OADHC generates glutaryl-CoA.
  Glutarate is formed from glutaryl-CoA by hydrolysis or transacylation reactions.
  Tryptophan is catabolised through alternative pathways leading to either 2-oxoadipate
  or quinolinic acid (QA). QA is an intermediate for the de novo biosynthesis of NAD
  from tryptophan,. In addition to its metabolic functions, NAD has signalling significance
  for glucose homeostasis, in particular through the Ca2+-mobilizing action of nicotinic
  acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), whose synthesis from NADP+ requires
  nicotinate. Dependent on cell-specific expression of the OADH-involving pathways,
  the OADH inhibition may downregulate saccharopine pathway and/or increase QA for
  biosynthesis of NAD and its signalling derivatives from tryptophan. The quantified
  metabolites of the presented pathways are shown in grey. Solid and dashed arrows
  indicate the single and more than two enzymatic reactions within a metabolic pathway,
  correspondingly. NA – nicotinic acid (nicotinate); NAADP – nicotinic acid adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate; NAM – nicotinamide; NAMN – nicotinic acid mononucleotide;
  QA – quinolinic acid.
