caption: Canonical/ Classical pathway and the Non- Canonical/ Alternative pathway
  of NF-KB. In the canonical pathway, the toll-like receptor gets activated by large
  stimuli and binding of ligand and recruiting the activation of IKB complex (IKK)
  complex, and then phosphorylates inhibitory enzyme (IKB) getting degraded by ubiquination.
  Further, the activated NF-KB complex (p50/p65) translocates into the nucleus to
  transcribe genes. In Non-canonical/alternative pathway, the activation of NF-KB
  inducing kinase (NIK) in response to very small stimuli (lymphotoxin B, B cell-activating
  factor) carries the intracellular signaling. The NIK phosphorylates the 2 IKK –alpha
  subunits phosphorylating p100, further activating heterodimer p52/RelB complex to
  translocate into the nucleus. (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure
  is available in the electronic copy of the article).
