caption: 'Schematic diagram showing the proposed crosstalk between integrins and GPCRs
  in ASM cell contraction signaling. Integrin activation is achieved via the formation
  of focal adhesion plaques leading to cytoskeleton reorganization, which is essential
  for actin polymerisation and recruitment of linker proteins for tension development.
  Integrin activation causes the phosphorylation of FAK and activation of downstream
  signaling events leading to ASM contraction. Integrin activation will also increase
  intracellular Ca2+ concentration to cause phosphorylation of MLCK and activation
  of myosin ATPase activity and crossbridge cycling. GPCR-induced ASM contraction
  signaling can be enhanced either by inhibition of cAMP/AC activity that regulates
  ASM relaxation signaling, or by activation of Ca2+ current that is necessary for
  ASM contraction signaling. Activation of integrins can attenuate GPCR-induced AC
  activity via the FAK/PI3K/Akt pathway. cAMP accumulation and AC activity can be
  decreased by integrin activation via G protein switching, in which Gi is activated
  instead of Gs. Altered phosphorylation of GPCR by integrins is thought to underlie
  G protein switching in ASM cell. Caveolin-1 that binds integrin has been shown to
  regulate GPCR signaling. Caveolae which are rich in caveolin-1 function as negative
  regulators of cAMP accumulation in ASM cell. GPCR stimulation of Ca2+ can be enhanced
  by integrin via inhibition of cAMP/PKA and activation of the Gi/ERK1/2/cPLA2/AA
  signaling. AA: arachidonic acid; AC: adenyl cyclase; AKT: protein kinase B; ASM:
