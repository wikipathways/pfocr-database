  Desaturation of phytoene occurs by two enzymes, phytoene desaturase (PDS) and zeta-carotene
  desaturase (ZDS), which are required to form lycopene. A major branch point occurs
  after lycopene synthesis when cyclization mediated by the enzymes lycopene-b-cyclase
  (LCYB) and lycopene-3-cyclase (LCYE) gives rise to α-carotene and β-carotene. α-carotene
  is acted upon by a β-ring hydroxylase to form zeinoxanthin, which is then hydroxylated
  by a ε-ring hydroxylase to produce lutein. β-carotene can be hydroxylated β-carotene
  hydroxylase (CRTRB) in a two-step reaction to zeaxanthin, with β-cryptoxanthin as
  an intermediate product. Zeaxanthin can be epoxidized to violaxanthin, and a set
  of light- and dark-controlled reactions, known as the xanthophyll cycle, rapidly
  optimize the concentration of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in the cell through the
  action of zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) and violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE), respectively,
