caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways of flavonoids in plants. The diagram delineates the
  sequential enzymatic steps converting phenylalanine into key flavonoid compounds:
  isoflavones, flavones, flavonols, and anthocyanins. Beginning with the transformation
  of phenylalanine into cinnamic acid via phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), the pathway
  proceeds through cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL)
  to produce 3-Malonyl-CoA and 4-Coumaroyl-CoA. Chalcone synthase (CHS) then catalyzes
  the formation of chalcones, which are isomerized by chalcone isomerase (CHI) to
  produce flavanones. Flavanones are diversified into different flavonoid classes:
  isoflavones via isoflavone synthase (IFS), flavones via flavone synthase (FNS),
  and further conversion into dihydroflavonols by flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H). Dihydroflavonols
  are converted to leucoanthocyanidins by dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), which
  are subsequently transformed into anthocyanidins by anthocyanidin synthase (ANS)
  and stabilized into anthocyanins by UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase
  (UFGT). Alternatively, dihydroflavonols can be converted to flavonols by flavonol
  synthase (FLS). This pathway highlights the metabolic intricacies and enzymatic
  specificity required for flavonoid biosynthesis, crucial for plant coloration, UV
  protection, and interactions with pollinators. PPP, phenylpropanoid pathway; EBGs,
  flavonoid early biosynthetic genes; LBGs, flavonoid late biosynthetic genes'
