caption: A model delineating the possible mechanism by which C. elegans FLR-4 modulates
  longevity through a neuron-gut crosstalk, preventing aberrant activation of the
  Met-C and the p38-MAPK pathway on diet containing different B12 levels. In the flr-4
  mutant, grown on a high B12 diet, the flux through the Met-C localized in the ADF
  serotonergic neurons directs the release of serotonin, which binds to MOD-1, its
  cognate receptor in the interneurons. These interneurons, in turn, release the neuropeptide
  FLR-2, which then binds to its cognate receptor FSHR-1 in the intestine. This cascade
  induces the oligomerization of TIR-1, activating the downstream p38-MAPK pathway.
  Consequently, this leads to an increase in CyTP gene expression, enhancement of
  osmotic stress tolerance and an extension of the lifespan of the flr-4 mutant grown
  on a high B12 diet. Created in BioRender. Mukhopadhyay, A. (2025) https://BioRender.com/83r2ngb
