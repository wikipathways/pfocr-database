caption: 'Schematic diagram of cross-regulation of ferroptosis and immunogenic cell
  death in tumor microenvironment. (In the tumor microenvironment, ferroptosis and
  immunogenic death are cross-regulated through complex mechanisms. In the core pathway
  of ferroptosis, RSL3 can regulate the GPX4 levels of M1 and M2 macrophages, causing
  lipid peroxidation and thus promoting ferroptosis. The specific mechanism is as
  follows: M1 macrophages highly express INOS, which catalyzes the production of a
  large amount of NO, which promotes lipid peroxidation—a core process of ferroptosis—thereby
  promoting ferroptosis of tumor cells; M2 macrophages have low expression of INOS
  and produce little NO, which makes it difficult to effectively induce lipid peroxidation
  and inhibit ferroptosis. Meanwhile, DMF further promotes lipid peroxidation by reducing
  intracellular GSH and GPX4 levels and upregulating 5-LOX, which strengthens the
  ferroptosis process. In terms of immunogenic death, tumor cells release DAMPs such
  as HMGB1 and ATP when undergoing ferroptosis, and these molecules can activate the
  immune response. For example, IFN-γ secreted by CD8+ T cells regulates SLC7A11 and
  ACSL4 through the STAT1-IRF1 pathway, which not only affects ferroptosis-related
  metabolism but also promotes immune activation. The cross-regulatory network between
  the two is manifested in many ways. On the one hand, immune cells are involved in
  the regulation of ferroptosis. M1 and M2 macrophages affect lipid peroxidation through
  GPX4, thereby regulating the occurrence of ferroptosis. Neutrophil-derived substances
  such as MPO are also involved in the ferroptosis process. On the other hand, ferroptosis
  affects the immune microenvironment. Ferroptosis-related signals such as GPX4 downregulation
  can activate immunosuppressive cells such as PMN-MDSC, leading to immunosuppression.
  The release of DAMPs, on the other hand, activates the immune response, forming
  a two-way regulation of “ferroptosis-immune activation-microenvironment remodeling”
  that ultimately affects tumor development). (Created by Figdraw)'
