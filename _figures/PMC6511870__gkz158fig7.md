caption: Model for repair of a telomeric stalled replication fork. A replication fork
  is stalled at the Tus/Ter barrier (top). Resection of the lagging strand followed
  by DNA replication resumption would leave a ssDNA gap behind the fork (depicted
  on the left). The gap can be filled by post-replicative HR mediated by the Rad51
  and Rad52 proteins amongst others. Deletions may arise via non-allelic HR repair
  of the ssDNA gap, in a process that is counteracted by Sgs1’s ability to disrupt
  aberrant strand invasion events. Alternatively, extended or prolonged fork regression
  might occur that is mediated by Mph1 (depicted on the right). Binding of Telomerase
  and the addition of telomeric repeats to the regressed fork could create a recombinogenic
  substrate that engages in HR with the telomeric repeats downstream of the Ter sites.
  Resolution of this HR intermediate would result in the observed telomere-proximal
  truncations observed in esc2 mutants. Large structural rearrangements could arise
  if unresolved HR intermediates are carried into mitosis and undergo chromosome breakage.
  Loss of Esc2 is proposed to lead to dysregulation of Mph1 activity, resulting in
  more extensive fork regression. Srs2 might normally serve to prevent HR intermediates
  from being processed correctly, with the result that srs2 cells funnel intermediates
  preferentially down the left branch of the pathway.
