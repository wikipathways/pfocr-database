caption: 13C labeling scheme following an infusion of [1,2 13C2] glucose. Black circles
  denote the possible position of 13C labeling on carbon backbones during metabolism.
  The isotopomers resulting from metabolism through glycolysis, the oxidative branch
  of the PPP, the first and second turns of the TCA cycle, and pyruvate recycling
  are shown. Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate; ME, malic enzyme; PC, pyruvate carboxylase;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PK, pyruvate
  kinase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
