caption: Metabolite pathway analysis with Pearson correlation coefficient only edges
  corresponding to correlations whose similarity was less than 0.5 are shown. (A)
  Metabolite pathway analysis between M3 and M20. (B) Metabolite pathway analysis
  between M20 and F20. The upward adjustment is red; the downward adjustment is green.
  The edges red solid line represents positive correlation, and the green solid line
  represents negative correlation. The line between metabolism–protein and protein–protein
  is indicated by a black dotted line.
