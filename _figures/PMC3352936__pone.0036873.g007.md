caption: In AD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated (1). This hyperphosphorylation would
  enhance its secretion by either exosomes/microvesicles or another unconventional
  secretory pathway (2). Extracellular hyperphosphorylated tau would be dephosphorylated
  by TNAP present at the plasma membrane (3) and this would result in an increase
  of dephosphorylated tau in the extracellular space (4). Dephosphorylated extracellular
  tau would activate the muscarinic receptors (5) and this would induce an increase
  of intracellular calcium (6), an event linked to the increase of tau hyperphosphorylation
  (7). This further increase of hyperphosphorylated tau would initiate a vicious circle
  that would enhance tau secretion.
