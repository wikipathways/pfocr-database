caption: Systemic (I) and central nervous system (II) responses to physical exercise.
  (I) Physical exercise promotes angiogenesis and neuroplasticity, and anti-oxidation
  counteracts oxidative stress. (II) Physical exercise increases BDNF affinity to
  the TrkB receptor (1) enhancing a cascade of intracellular signals, including MAPK/ERK1/2–IP3/Akt
  pathway (2) that inhibits apoptosis and free radical release—ROS (A) on the one
  hand, and phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB on the other (3); the latter,
  by attaching to the CRE elements in the cell nucleus, increases the transcription
  of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene (4) responsible for conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA,
  from which DA is formed, and transcription of genes (5) that promote the survival
  processes, thereby blocking apoptosis and inhibiting the formation of ROS (B). Akt—Akt
  enzyme, also known as protein kinase B, BDNF—brain-derived neutrophic factor, CREB—cyclicAMP-response
  element-binding protein, DA—dopamine, ERK—extracellular signal-regulated kinases,
  IP3—inositol trisphosphate, L-DOPA—levodopa, MAPK—mitogen-activated protein kinase,
  ROS—reactive oxygen species, TrkB—tropomyosin receptor kinase B.
