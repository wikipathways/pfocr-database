caption: The pheromone response signaling pathway. (A) The main chain of the pheromone
  pathway downloaded from KEGG, (B) the output of our PathFinder implementation, (C)
  The color-coding algorithm output for the pheromone pathway [20], (D) the NetSearch
  program prediction for the pheromone pathway [18]. The interactions that do not
  exist in the PPIN are shown with dashed edges in (A). Notice that, for (B),(C) and
  (D) the proteins that were not on the main chain of the pathway, as shown in (A),
  were not colored.
