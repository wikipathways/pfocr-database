caption: Effect of FA on LPS-induced cellular inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis.
  Through the canonical NF-κB pathway, TLR4 recognizes extracellular LPS and transduces
  signals via MyD88 to activate NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory gene transcription.
  In addition, ligated TLR4 promotes the interaction between Park7 and P47phox, which
  increases NOX-mediated ROS generation. Subsequently, excessive ROS accumulation
  in the cytoplasm leads to a loss of the MMP, mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and
  uncoupling of Nrf2-Keap1 and IκBα-NF-κB. Most notably, although dissociated Nrf2
  is responsible for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity, its levels were increased
  after 12 h of LPS treatment but did not block the inflammation and oxidative stress
  induced by NF-κB in the early stage. However, FA interference advances the activation
  of Nrf2, consequently relieving the inflammatory response and oxidative stress to
  inhibit cellular apoptosis and promote BMEC survival.
