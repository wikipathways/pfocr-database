caption: Mtb induces the production of IFN-β in infected cells via release of bacterial
  DNA (eDNA) (, –) or damage to host cell mitochondria followed by increased mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA) in the cytosol (). All these factors initiate the STING/TBK1 signaling
  pathway that leads to activation of the transcription factor IRF-3 and increased
  IFN-β production. The secreted IFN-β acts on bystander cells to increase secretion
  of IL-10 and IL-1Ra which lead to increased host cell necrosis and tissue damage,
  thus exacerbating the disease outcome (). Here we show that Mtb inhibits autocrine
  IFNAR-signaling which limits not only the production of IFN-β but also the expression
  of genes with host cell defense properties such as Nos2.
