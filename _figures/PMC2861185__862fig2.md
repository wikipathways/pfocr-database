caption: Models of the Hippo pathway in Drosophila and mammals. In Drosophila, Fat
  protocadherin may initiate the Hippo pathway signal in response to Ds binding, and
  is modulated by binding of Lft and phosphorylation by Dco (; ; ). Fat may inhibit
  a nonconventional myosin Dachs, which represses Wts protein levels (). Fat may also
  activate Ex with an unknown mechanism (; ; ; ). Mer and Ex also activate the Hippo
  pathway (). They may form a complex with Hpo and Sav (). Kibra interacts with both
  Mer and Ex, and may also be in the complex (). Hpo kinase interacts with and phosphorylates
  a scaffold protein, Sav (). Together, they phosphorylate and activate Wts kinase
  and its associated protein, Mats (). Wts phosphorylates a transcription coactivator,
  Yki, on three sites (). Phosphorylation of Yki S168 induces 14–3–3 binding and cytoplasmic
  retention (). Yki may also be retained in the cytoplasm by physical interaction
  with Ex, Wts, and Hpo (; ). When Yki is relieved from inhibition and gets into the
  nucleus, it binds and activates a transcription factor, Sd, to induce cycE, diap1,
  and ex expression (; ; ). Yki induces bantam microRNA through Hth and Tsh (). In
  mammals, functional significance of Fat and Ex homologs are not clear. However,
  Mer may still activate the Hippo pathway (). RASSF, a subgroup of Ras effector proteins,
  may also activate Mst1/2 (Hpo homolog) (). Relationships between Hpo, Sav, Wts,
  and Mats are basically conserved in mammalian Mst1/2, Sav1 (Sav homolog), Lats1/2
  (Wts homolog), and Mob (Mats homolog). Lats1/2 phosphorylates YAP on five conserved
  HXRXXS motifs (four on TAZ) (). Dependent on cell context, there may exist another
  YAP kinase in response to Mst1/2 and another Lats1/2 kinase (). S127 (S89 in TAZ)
  phosphorylation-dependent 14–3–3 binding and cytoplasmic retention are conserved
  in YAP/TAZ (; ). YAP is also inhibited by S381 phosphorylation, which primes CK1δ/ɛ
  phosphorylation of S384, and S387 finally leads to SCFβ-TRCP-mediated ubiquitination
  and degradation (). Sd homologs, TEADs, are major YAP target transcription factors.
  They mediate expression of CTGF, Gli2, and many other target genes (). AREG is induced
  by YAP through an unidentified transcription factor (). YAP and TAZ also bind Smad1
  and Smad2/3 to activate expression of TGF-β and BMP target genes, respectively,
  to maintain stem cell pluripotency (; ).
