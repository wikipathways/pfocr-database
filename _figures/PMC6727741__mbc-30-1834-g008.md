caption: The role of WDR92 in the axonemal dynein assembly pathway. (a) Diagram illustrating
  the central role that WDR92 may play in coordinating association of R2TP (and variant)
  complexes with the prefoldins and the CCT chaperonin. WDR92 interacts directly with
  both prefoldins and the RPAP3_C domains present in RPAP3 and SPAG1. These in turn
  scaffold interactions with the RuvBL1/2 AAA+ ATPases, and PIH proteins that mediate
  recruitment of HSP70 and HSP90. As eukaryotes (such as yeast, higher plants, and
  nematodes) missing axonemal dyneins also lack WDR92, how prefoldins and chaperonins
  associate with R2TP in these organisms remains unclear. Furthermore, although clearly
  essential for axonemal dynein HC formation, why cytoplasmic and IFT dynein HCs,
  which have similar folding requirements, are unaffected remains unexplored. (b)
  Model illustrating the synthesis of dynein HCs. Each spliced HC mRNA is ∼15 kb,
  which equates to an unfolded linear molecule of ∼5 μm; at an incorporation rate
  of 5 residues/s, a ribosome would take ∼13–15 min to track along an mRNA of this
  length. Simultaneous association of numerous ribosomes would lead to a group of
  partially synthesized dynein HCs associated with a complex array of cytoplasmic
  assembly and stabilization factors. Given the circular arrangement of AAA domains
  within the dynein motor unit, an HC can be fully stabilized only once the terminal
  AAA unit has been synthesized. However, binding sites for individual dynein components
  such as LC1 (DNAL1), which associates near the ATP-dependent microtubule-binding
  domain, or the IC/LC complex, which interacts with the N-terminal region, may become
  available and occupied before completion of HC synthesis.
