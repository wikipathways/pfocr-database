caption: 'Being coupled to stimulatory (Gs/olf) and inhibitory (Gi/o) GTP-binding
  proteins, D1 and D2 receptors have opposite effects on the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32
  cascade (‘canonical pathway’), which regulates the levels of phosphorylation of
  multiple cellular and nuclear targets. In particular, the cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32 pathway
  modulates the activity of MAPK-dependent signaling pathways downstream of glutamate
  receptors. It has been recently recognized that cAMP-independent pathways are also
  recruited following D2 receptor stimulation (non-canonical pathways; cf. Section
  ‘DA receptor signaling in the neurons of the intact striatum: modulation of cAMP/PKA
  pathways and non-canonical signaling’). Full names of the molecules shown in this
  drawing are given in the list of abbreviations.'
