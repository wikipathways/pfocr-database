caption: (A) In normal melanocytes, N-Ras is inactive until a stimulus (e.g., growth
  factor) binds its receptor tyrosine kinase, which promotes exchange of GDP to GTP
  by GEFs, thereby activating N-Ras. In normal melanocytes, activation of N-Ras signaling
  is mediated by the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. (B) In NRAS mutant melanoma, the N-ras protein
  is unable to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, and remains in the GTP-bound, active state. Oncogenic
  N-Ras stimulates various Ras effector pathway, including Raf, PI3K/Akt, and RAL.
  Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling drives cellular proliferation, as does the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  Downstream signaling can be disrupted via inhibition of MEK signaling, and in cooperation
  with MEK inhibition. Disruption of CDK4/6 signaling cooperates to disable tumor
  growth in NRAS mutant melanoma. There is some suggestion the response to immune
  checkpoint blockade is enhanced in patients with NRAS mutant melanoma, but the reports
  are limited and a proposed mechanism is lacking. Treatment of NRAS mutant melanoma
  (*) involves targeting MEK, PI3K/Akt, CDK4/6, or immune checkpoints (PD1, CTLA-4).
