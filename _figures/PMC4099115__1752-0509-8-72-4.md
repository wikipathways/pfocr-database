  Most significant IPA metabolic interaction network for the plasma metabolites correlated
  with polyp counts and associated with a Genotype by Diet interaction (listed in
  Table  and Additional file : Table S5). For metabolic pathways, an arrow pointing
  from node A to node B signifies that B is produced from A. The keys of molecule
  shapes and relationship labels show the nature of the nodes as and their relationships,
  respectively. Acronyms refer to relationship labels and numbers in parentheses next
  to them refer to the number of literature findings that support these relationships
  individually. Both direct (solid line) and indirect (broken line) specific relationships
  between the metabolites are indicated. Nodes with pink fillings represent metabolites
  that were significantly changed in the interaction effect and correlated with the
  outcome of interest. Metabolites involved in “Gastrointestinal Disease and Cancer”
  are circled in dark pink. Note in the top-left of the graph the presence of the
  hippuric acid metabolic pathway resulting from the conjugation of glycine with benzoic
  acid, which in turn is a conversion by-product of the L-phenylalanine metabolism.'
