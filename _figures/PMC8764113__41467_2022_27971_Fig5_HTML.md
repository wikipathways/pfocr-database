caption: a Decarboxylative condensation of malonyl-CoA with the enzyme-bound 4-hydroxyphenylpropionyl
  unit. b Formation of the 4-hydroxyphenylpropionyl-β-diketide-CoA intermediate. c
  Decarboxylative condensation of phenylpropionyl-β-diketide acid nonenzymatically
  derived from phenylpropionyl-β-diketide-CoA with the enzyme-bound benzoyl unit.
  d Formation of the C6–C5–C6 scaffold product. e Schematic representation of the
  proposed mechanism of the formation of the C6–C5–C6 scaffold by PECPS. The entrances
  to the catalytic cavities are indicated with red arrows.
