caption: The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Glucose enters the cell and undergoes
  two-step conversion to fructose-6P (fructose-6-phosphate), after which approximately
  95% of it proceeds to glycolysis and 3–5% of it is converted to glucosamine-6P (glucosamine-6-phosphate)
  by the enzyme GFAT (glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase), utilizing
  glutamine that enters the cell. GFAT catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step
  in the formation of hexosamine products and thus is a key regulator of HBP. GNA1/GNPNAT1
  (glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase) then converts glucosamine-6P (which
  can also be made by glucosamine entering the cell) into GlcNAc-6P (N-acetylglucosamine-6-Phosphate),
  also utilizing acetyl-CoA that is made from fatty acid metabolism. This is then
  converted to GlcNAc-1P (N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate) by PGM3/AGM1 (phosphoglucomutase)
  and further to UDP-GlcNAc (uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine) by UAP/AGX1
  (UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pyrophosphorylase), utilizing UTP from the nucleotide metabolism
  pathway. UDP-GlcNAc is then used for N-linked and O-linked glycosylation in the
  ER and Golgi and for O-GlcNAc modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins by
  OGT (O-GlcNAc transferase). OGA (O-GlcNAcase) catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc
  and adds back GlcNAc to the HBP pool for re-cycling through salvage pathway (Fig.
