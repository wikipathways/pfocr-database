caption: 'Summary of the hypothesized interaction within the NRF2/AKR1C1/PR pathway.Notes:
  Activated NRF2 (high nuclear, low cytoplasmic expression) activates aldo-keto reductase
  family 1 member C1 (AKR1C1) via an antioxidant response element (ARE). AKR1C1 converts
  progesterone to its inactive form, the 20-alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone, and decreases
  PR receptor activity with consecutive platinum resistance. Metformin treatment counteracts
  this pathway, which may reverse the effects and consecutively lead to platinum re-sensitization.'
