caption: 'Mechanism of meningeal metastasis in solid tumors. A EMT can downregulate
  the expression of E-cadherin in tumor cells, while promoting N-cadherin and vimentin
  expression, leading to loss of cellular polarity and intercellular connections.
  This process enhances their migratory capacity through activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway; B In the MICs formation process, immune cells and various factors
  such as physical stress, oxidative stress, etc., eliminate circulating tumor cells
  derived from the primary tumor. The remaining few cells are then encapsulated by
  platelets, neutrophils, or tumor stromal cells to form MICs clusters that circulate
  within the body; C The mechanism by which tumor cells breach the BBB involves cathepsin
  S, matrix metalloproteinases, and various CAMs. Furthermore, T cells can upregulate
  the GBP-1 expression in tumor cells to facilitate LM. Additionally, aging can also
  impact BBB integrity; D The CSF-barrier comprises the arachnoid CSF barrier and
  the BCB. Bacterial degradation products, activation of C3a receptor on choroid plexus
  epithelium, and the upregulation of ICAM2 facilitate tumor cell penetration through
  the CSF; E Distinct organs possess the ability to selectively capture or attract
  specific subtypes of tumor cells, thereby facilitating organ-specific metastasis.
