caption: Red text indicates the up-regulated genes, green text indicates the down-regulated
  genes. The dashed vector arrows indicate potential pathways that involve more than
  one intermediates and genes but none of which could be identified in the proteomic
  analysis. All reaction steps were derived from KEGG pathway maps.
