caption: The nitric oxide-peroxynitrite-PARP pathway in health and disease. Nitric
  oxide (NO) activates the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-cyclic guanosine-3′,5′-monophosphate
  (cGMP) signal transduction pathway and mediates various physiological/beneficial
  effects including synaptic plasticity; vasodilation; inhibition of platelet aggregation;
  anti-inflammatory, anti-remodeling, and anti-apoptotic effects; just mentioning
  a few. Under pathophysiological conditions (eg, stroke, myocardial infarction, chronic
  heart failure, diabetes, circulatory shock, chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer,
  and neurodegenerative disorders, and so forth), nitric oxide and superoxide (·O2−)
  react to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−) that induces cell damage via lipid peroxidation,
  inactivation of enzymes and other proteins by oxidation and nitration, and also
  activation of stress signaling, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) among others. Mitochondrial
  enzymes are particularly vulnerable to attacks by peroxynitrite, leading to reduced
  ATP formation and induction of mitochondrial permeability transition by opening
  of the permeability transition pore (PTP), which dissipates the mitochondrial membrane
  potential (ΔΨ). These events result in cessation of electron transport and ATP formation,
  mitochondrial swelling, and permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane,
  allowing the efflux of several proapoptotic molecules, including cytochrome c and
  apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). In turn, cytochrome c and AIF activate a series
  of downstream effectors that mediate caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic
  death pathways. In addition to its damaging effects on mitochondria, peroxynitrite,
  in concert with other oxidants, causes oxidative injury to DNA, resulting in DNA
  strand breakage which in turn activates the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
  (PARP-1). Activated PARP-1 consumes NAD to build up poly(ADP-ribose) polymers (PAR),
  which are themselves rapidly metabolized by the activity of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase
  (PARG). Some free PAR may exit the nucleus and travel to the mitochondria, where
  they amplify the mitochondrial efflux of AIF (nuclear to mitochondria cross talk).
  Depending on the severity of the initial damage by peroxynitrite and other oxidants,
  the injured cell may either recover or die. In the latter case, the cell may be
  executed by apoptosis in case of moderate mitochondrial PTP opening and PARP-1 activation
  with preservation of cellular ATP, or by necrosis in case of widespread PTP opening
  and PARP-1 overactivation, leading to massive NAD consumption and collapse of cellular
  ATP. Overactivated PARP-1 also facilitates the expression of a variety of inflammatory
  genes leading to increased inflammation and associated tissue injury.
