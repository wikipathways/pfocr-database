caption: Reprogramming of glucose metabolism in T cells during acute graft-versus-host
  disease (aGvHD) pathogenesis. MYC and mTORC1 signaling pathways are known to be
  activated by T-cell receptor (TCR) and co-stimulating molecular CD28 during antigen
  recognition to promote the transcriptional activity of E2F family transcription
  factors (TFs). During aGvHD pathogenesis, we found glycolysis and its related pathways,
  such as pentose phosphate pathway, to be enriched in alloreactive T cells. TCR,
  mTORC1, MYC signaling pathways and E2F6 might be “master regulators” of glycolytic
  activity. Expressions of glycolytic genes, such as PFKP, ENO3, and GAPDH were shown
  to be elevated and correlated with activities of TCR, MYC, and mTORC1 signaling
  and E2F family. E2F6 was predicted as a TF to regulate the expression of PFKP, ENO3,
  and GAPDH. High expression of glycolytic genes PFKP, ENO3, and GAPDH in T cells
  can predict aGvHD development. Thus, we assumed that TCR might interact with MYC
  and mTORC1 to promote E2F expression, further increasing the expression of PFKP,
  ENO3, and GAPDH to activate glycolysis and its related pathways in alloreactive
  T cells during aGvHD development. These changes in glucose metabolism might promote
  T-cell activation through supplying energy and precursors for anabolism. Red text
  indicates activated signaling pathways, TFs, glycolytic genes, and glycolysis-related
  pathways.
