caption: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated inflammation. Under ERS condition,
  the UPR is activated, and this leads to activation of the three principal UPR signaling
  transmembrane receptor proteins including IRE-1, PERK, and ATF6. Activation of the
  IRE-1 leads to the splicing of the mRNA of a transcription factor XBP1 and subsequent
  expression of sXPB1, a highly active transcription factor for the release of ER-resident
  enzymes and molecular chaperones. As a result, it leads to activation of NF-κB and
  CHOP resulting in increased expression of proinflammatory gene products. Likewise,
  activated IRE-1 recruits TRAF2, and this complex causes activation of downstream
  signaling of kinases including JNK and NF-κB, which induce production of inflammatory
  cytokines and trigger inflammation. These inflammatory kinases then phosphorylate
  and activate downstream mediators of inflammation. Phosphorylation of PERK/eIF2a
  downstream signaling pathway results in uncoupling of NF-κB from IkB. As a result,
  NF-κB translocates into the nucleus where it activates expression of genes encoding
  proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a, resulting in persistent
  inflammatory response. On the other hand, autophosphorylation of PERK initiates
  activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which further undergoes phosphorylation
  resulting in translational attenuation of protein synthesis. Similarly, this downstream
  phosphorylation of eIF2 leads to increased expression of ATF4 and translocation
  into the nucleus where it binds to the UPRE resulting in transcriptional modification
  of CHOP, a proapoptotic gene transcription factor that initiates inflammation as
  well as apoptosis. IRE-1 recruits TRAF2 and causes activation of downstream signaling
  of kinases including JNK and NF-κB, inducing the production of inflammatory cytokines.
  PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, which leads to the activation of NF-κB and CHOP to further
  promote the expression of the inflammatory gene. ERS leads to dissociation of TRAF
  from TRAF2-procaspase 12 complex, which is located on the ER membrane, leading to
  activation of caspase 12. At the same time, IRE1–JNK complex recruits TRAF2 leading
  to the formation of the IRE1–JNK–TRAF2 complex. The ATF6 pathway also activates
  NF-κB, further intensifying the expression of inflammatory genes, which secrete
  more cytokines.

  description: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated inflammation. Under ERS
    condition, the UPR is activated, and this leads to activation of the three principal
    UPR signaling transmembrane receptor proteins including IRE-1, PERK, and ATF6.
    Activation of the IRE-1 leads to the splicing of the mRNA of a transcription factor
    XBP1 and subsequent expression of sXPB1, a highly active transcription factor
    for the release of ER-resident enzymes and molecular chaperones. As a result,

    proinflammatory gene products. Likewise, activated IRE-1 recruits TRAF2, and this
    complex causes activation of downstream signaling of kinases including JNK and
    NF-κB, which induce production of inflammatory cytokines and trigger inflammation.
    These inflammatory kinases then phosphorylate and activate downstream mediators
    of inflammation. Phosphorylation of PERK/eIF2a downstream signaling pathway results
    in uncoupling of NF-κB from IkB. As a result, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus
    where it activates expression of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines including
    IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a, resulting in persistent inflammatory response. On the other
    hand, autophosphorylation of PERK initiates activation of eukaryotic initiation
    factor 2 (eIF2), which further undergoes phosphorylation resulting in translational

    a proapoptotic gene transcription factor that initiates inflammation as well as
