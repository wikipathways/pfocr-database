caption: This figure illustrates the role of glutaminolysis in various diseases, including
  neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune conditions, kidney diseases, and cardiovascular
  diseases. Key metabolic alterations in glutamate and glutamine pathways are highlighted,
  showcasing their impact on cellular function and disease progression. The potential
  therapeutic targets within these pathways are also emphasized, suggesting avenues
  for future research and treatment. Overall, glutaminolysis emerges as a critical
  factor influencing disease mechanisms across multiple biological systems
