caption: 'The Hippo signaling pathway and therapeutic targets. The Hippo signaling
  pathway consists of the kinase cascade component in the cytoplasm and the YAP/TAZ-TEAD
  transcription component in the nucleus. The pathway is regulated by numerous stimuli,
  including mechanical stress, GPCRs, cell polarity, and cell adhesion. When the Hippo
  pathway is “on,” the kinase cascade transduces the stimuli, ending with YAP/TAZ
  phosphorylation. Phosphorylated YAP/TAZ bind with 14–3-3 and undergo ubiquitin-proteasomal
  degradation. In the Hippo “off” condition, YAP/TAZ are activated in a dephosphorylated
  state and are translocated into the nucleus to modulate transcription. The possible
  targets of the Hippo pathway are: i) upstream regulators of YAP/TAZ, ii) YAP/TAZ
  nuclear translocation, iii) protein–protein interaction between YAP/TAZ and TEAD,
  iv) protein-DNA interaction between YAP/TAZ-TEAD and target DNA, and v) transcription
  and expression of the target genes. Candidate compounds shown in the diagram are
  ACT-333679, DHX, statins, MK-5108, verteporfin, and miR-15a. The GPCR ligands are
  ACT-333679, which is a partial agonist of IP receptor, and DHX, which is a full
  agonist of DRD1. The statins are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and MK-5108, which
  is a selective inhibitor for Aurora kinase A; they indirectly inhibit the nuclear
  translocation of YAP. Verteporfin blocks the protein–protein interaction of YAP/TAZ
  and TEAD, and MiR-15a decreases YAP expression'
