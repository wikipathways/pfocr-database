caption: Sources of oxidative stress in melanocytes and subsequent activation of the
  NRF2/KEAP1/ARE-signaling pathway. Endogenous sources of oxidative stress include
  ROS produced by mitochondrial respiration, melanosomal melanogenesis, and the activity
  of NOX enzymes as well as RNS produced by NOS enzymes. It should be noted that NOX
  enzymes are expressed in several subcellular compartments in addition to the plasma
  membrane, as depicted here. Exogenous sources of oxidative stress include environmental
  stressors such as UVR and exposure of the skin to pro-oxidant chemical substances.
  Under normal conditions, there is a consistent low level of NRF2 present that is
  sequestered in the cytosol by KEAP1. CUL3 can then bind to the NRF2/KEAP1 complex
  leading to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of NRF2. However, under
  conditions of oxidative stress, there are redox-sensitive cysteine residues on KEAP1
  that become modified leading to the release of NRF2. Released NRF2 can then enter
  the nucleus, bind to AREs, and promote the expression of antioxidant genes. ARE,
  antioxidant response element; CUL3, E3 ubiquitin ligase cullin-3; GSH, glutathione;
  KEAP1, kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; NOX, NADPH
  oxidase; NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2; RNS, reactive nitrogen species;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; TRX, thioredoxin; and UVR, ultraviolet radiation.
