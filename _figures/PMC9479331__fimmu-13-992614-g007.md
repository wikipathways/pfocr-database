caption: Schematic representation on the role of ICOS-ICOSL axis in the pathogenesis
  of sepsis. Septic insult results in an imbalance in the ICOS-ICOSL axis, leading
  to bidirectional harmful effects, where, on the one hand, the triggering of ICOS
  can induce immunosuppression, while, on the other hand, the signaling pathway downstream
  of the ICOSL protein leads to overactivation of FAK-p38-NLRP3 axis, promoting the
  transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, as well as the cleavage of pro IL-1β into
  IL-1β and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Leukocyte recruitment
  is also stimulated by the release of cytokines. Systemic hyperinflammation (cytokine
  storm), along with polymorphonuclear cell recruitment, contributes to the onset
  of multiple organ failure. Treatment with ICOS-Fc can attenuate sepsis-induced hyperinflammation
  and therefore MOF to improve clinical outcomes.
