caption: 'Simplified overview of the pathways involved in miRNA regulation of gene
  expression in addiction. Neurotransmitters activate intracellular signaling pathways
  through binding to their different receptors, leading to activation of transcription
  factors. Transcriptional activation induces transcription of a large program of
  plasticity-related genes - leading to synaptic adaptation and favoring the formation
  of the addictive phenotype - together with transcription of primer miRNAs. Primer
  miRNAs are processed by Drosha/DGCR8, and then exported by exportin 5 as precursor
  miRNAs to be converted to mature miRNA by Dicer and other nucleases. Upon strand
  selection, the selected strand of the mature miRNA binds with Ago2 and the Risc
  complex to interact with its specific target. Perfect match with the target mRNA
  induces deadenylation and mRNA cleavage, while imperfect match prevents binding
  to ribosomes and blocks translation: in both cases expression is silenced. In many
  cases, miRNAs regulate gene expression (including plasticity-related genes) in a
  dynamic double negative feedback loop, as exemplified here with miR-181a/miR-124/let-7
  d, involved in cocaine (adapted from [,]): the brain-enriched miR-124 is suppressed
  by chronic cocaine in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway (presumably by the induction
  of REST), which induces expression of genes encoding miR-124 targets (BDNF, integrin
  β1, NAC1, axon guidance molecules such as SEMA6A, and so on), while downregulation
  of let-7 d by cocaine results in induction of the genes encoding its targets (μ-opioid
  receptor, dopamine receptor D3R, semaphorins SEMA6A and SEM4C, PLAU, and so on);
  these genes (upregulated by cocaine) markedly induce miR-181a, causing downregulation
  of its targets (RGS4, PI4K2B, Per2, and so on), which in turn regulate expression
  of miR-124a and let-7 d. Abbreviations: Ago2, argonaute 2; ATF2, cAMP-dependent
  transcription factor 2; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CREB, cAMP-responsive
  element binding protein; DGCR8, DiGeorge syndrome critical region protein 8; Dicer,
  double-stranded RNA endoribonuclease III; 4E-BP, translational repressor protein;
  eEF1A, elongation factor 1A; eIF-4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; PLCγ: phospholipase C-γ; Risc,
  RNA-induced silencing complex; STAT4, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  protein 4; S6, ribosomal protein S6 kinase.'
