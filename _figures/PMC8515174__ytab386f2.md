caption: Diagnostic algorithm for thrombotic microangiopathies. Thrombocytopenia and
  Coombs-negative anaemia suggest for a diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathy. Thrombotic
  microangiopathy is divided in primary and secondary. The first includes a spectrum
  of entities like thrombocytopenic purpura, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and complement-mediated
  thrombotic microangiopathy. The main characteristics of thrombocytopenic purpura
  is ADAMTS13 reduction or deficiency and neurological syndrome. In haemolytic uraemic
  syndrome, the prominent organ injury is renal and ADAMTS13 activity is normal. Typical
  haemolytic uraemic syndrome is caused from enteric bacterial infection (Escherichia
  coli) that produces Shigatoxin that damages endothelial cells. More rarely, there
  are thrombotic microangiopathies cases with normal ADAMTS13 activity and in the
  absence of Shiga toxin-producing organisms or enteric symptoms. This group is referred
  to complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (or atypical haemolytic uraemic
  syndrome) due to the dysregulation of the alternate complement pathway leading to
  complement overactivation and consequent endothelial damage. Secondary thrombotic
  microangiopathies are caused by other underlying conditions, such as infections,
  autoimmune disease, or medical treatment. ADAMTS13, a disintegrin and metalloprotease
  with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13; CFH, complement factor H; cTMA, complement-mediated
  thrombotic microangiopathy; GI, gastrointestinal; HUS, haemolytic uraemic syndrome;
  TMA, thrombotic microangiopathy; TTP, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
