caption: Hypoxia-invoked response of the glycolysis gene network. Expression of glycolysis-enhancing
  enzymes (masked with pale pink) was up-regulated while that of glycolysis-suppressing
  enzymes (masked with pale blue) was down-regulated. Human genes assigned to the
  glycolysis pathway map of the KEGG database were selected, and TSS-tag numbers of
  the corresponding genes were evaluated. Red bars and blue bars represent TSS-tag
  ppm in normoxia and hypoxia respectively. Fold induction for each of the genes is
  shown in Supplementary Table 11. Genes included in the list of the ‘hypoxia-induced’
  120 genes are highlighted by green boxes. Note that, since we used the stricter
  criteria for selecting hypoxia-induced genes (>10 p.p.m., >5-fold induction), many
  of the genes belonging to this pathway are not directly included in the list, though
  they showed inductions at least to some extent.
