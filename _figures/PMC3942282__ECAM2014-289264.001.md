caption: Schematic illustration of the molecular mechanisms and pathways of BBR in
  reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. (1) BBR could inhibit oxidative stress
  by upregulation of SOD, UCP2 and downregulation of NADPH oxidase expression, which
  was possible to be mediated by the SIRT1/FOXO or AMPK pathway. (2) BBR administration
  induced the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, which was crucial for the antioxidant
  and anti-inflammatory activities of BBR. The effect of BBR on Nrf2 relied on the
  activation of AMPK, PI3K/Akt, and P38 pathways. (3) BBR could suppress inflammation
  by blocking the MAPK pathways in an AMPK-dependent manner, inhibiting the classic
  NF-κB signaling pathway; inhibiting the Rho GTPase pathway, which was proved to
  play a role in NF-κB regulation, and attenuating the transcription activity of AP-1,
  which was possible to be mediated by PPARγ activation. The black lines/boxes and
  red lines/boxes indicate pathways and molecules involved in the antioxidant or anti-inflammatory
  activity of BBR, respectively. Red boxes with black frame indicate pathways and
  molecules responsible for both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of BBR.
  The symbols of “?” indicate possible mechanisms and pathways that need to be further
  verified. There was a vicious cycle between oxidative stress and inflammation, which
  was possibly able to be terminated by BBR administration.
