caption: 'Putative model for the intracellular signaling pathways involved in NPY-induced
  VSMC proliferation. NPY stimulates VSMC proliferation at concentrations ranging
  from 10−14 to 10−7 mol·L−1, in a characteristic bimodal fashion with 2 growth peaks
  — high-affinity (below known NPY receptor Kds) and low-affinity (10−9–10−7 mol·L−1).
  At all concentrations, NPY activates Gi/o proteins, which stimulate 2 major signaling
  pathways: Y1 receptor-mediated PLC activation and Y1 and Y5 receptor-mediated inhibition
  of adenylyl cyclase. PLC activation leads to the increase in intracellular calcium,
  mainly by extracellular calcium influx, but possibly also by its mobilization from
  intracellular stores. Increase in calcium activates PKC, which stimulates the Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK1/2
  cascade, and CaMKII, which facilitates this by direct interactions with Raf-1. Decrease
  in adenylyl cyclase activity and cAMP level inhibits PKA and, as a consequence,
  blocks its inhibitory effects on the Ras and Raf proteins. This pathway is particularly
  important at low concentrations of NPY, where Y5-dependent PKA inhibition provides
  additional amplification of Y1 receptor-mediated mitogenic signal.'
