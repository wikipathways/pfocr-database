caption: 'CNN1 signaling pathway involved in cancer. CNN1 recruits PKC/ERK through
  its structural domain, further activating the mTOR pathway, which leads to cell
  proliferation. Malignant tumor cells secrete various growth factors, such as PDGF-BB,
  which suppress CNN1 expression. CNN1 plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal remodeling
  and signal transduction due to its structural domain. Decreased CNN1 expression
  destabilizes F-actin, enhancing cell motility. In signal transduction, low CNN1
  expression reduces levels of dickkopf-1 (DKK1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2
  (TIMP-2). This leads to the overexpression of metalloproteinases (MMP2/MMP9), activating
  the β-catenin/Wnt/c-myc signaling pathways, which promote cell invasion, migration,
  epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and angiogenesis in tumor cells. A potential
  therapeutic approach involves the use of PDGF antagonists, such as neomycin, to
  target these pathways in cancer treatment. CNN1: Calponin 1'
