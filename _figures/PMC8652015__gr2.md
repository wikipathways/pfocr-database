caption: Biogenic amine neurotransmitters regulate the pathological mechanism of breast
  cancerA. ΑDR-α1 is coupled to Gq protein and exerts physiological effects via the
  PLC/IP3/Ca2+ and DAG/PKC pathways. ΑDR-α2 coupled with Gi protein inhibits AC expression
  and decreases the intracellular cAMP level. ΑDR-α2 stimulates ERK phosphorylation
  via the Ras/Rαf/MAPK signaling pathway and Src-independent pathway to promote breast
  cancer cell proliferation. B. Upon stimulation by adrenaline, ΑDR-β and GS protein
  conjugate to activate AC, resulting in the production of the second messenger cAMP,
  which then activates its two downstream target molecules PKA or EPAC, leading to
  biological effects. C. Under chronic stress, ΑDR-β2 promotes glucose homeostasis
  in breast cancer cells to shift toward glycolysis and promotes LDHA expression.
  The resultant weakly acidic microenvironment enhances the deubiquitination of MYC
  by USP28, improves the stability of MYC, and activates the promoter of Slug, ultimately
  promoting the stem cell-like properties of breast cancer. D. The increased expression
  of CCL2 and CCR2 in chronically stressed mice results in the accumulation of macrophages
  in the lungs, which ultimately leads to a significant increase in the metastasis
  and colonization of circulating breast cancer cells in the lungs. E. Trastuzumab
  resistance-dependent PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is controlled by catecholamine-induced
  ΑDR-β2 activation.
