caption: "MDC1 loss causes greater IR sensitivity than H2AX loss. a Diagram depicting
  the main events in the signal transduction pathway that leads to 53BP1 accumulation
  on chromatin at DNA-damage sites: (1) DSB induction and MRN/ATM recruitment/activation.
  (2) ATM phosphorylates H2AX and this is recognised by MDC1, which brings in more
  MRN and ATM. (3) MDC1-mediated accumulation of ATM results in amplification of the
  γH2AX signal and, consequently, further recruitment of MDC1/MRN/ATM. (4) ATM also
  phosphorylates the TQXF cluster of MDC1. (5) Phosphorylated TQXF motifs are bound
  by RNF8, which ubiquitylates another protein(s). (6) This ubuiqitylated protein(s)
  serves as a docking site(s) for RNF168. (7) RNF168 ubiquitylates H2A/H2AX and this,
  together with constitutive histone H4-K20-methylation, creates a platform that recruits
  53BP1 and the Shieldin complex. b Clonogenic survival assays towards ionising radiation
  (IR) in specified RPE-1 genetic backgrounds. The tendency for MDC1−/−H2AX−/− double
  knockout cells to be slightly more IR sensitive than MDC1−/− single knockout cells
  might be explained by 53BP1 binding γH2AX in a MDC1-independent fashion,, and/or
  by replication stress caused by the lack of H2AX ; n = 6/genotype (except for MDC1
  KO n = 4); error bars s.e.m. \uFEFFAdditional supporting data, including validation,
  genotyping and cell cycle profiling of knockouts, are presented in Supplementary
