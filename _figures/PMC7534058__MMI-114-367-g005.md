caption: Prediction of chemoreceptors and signaling pathways in V. cholerae. Each
  chemoreceptor is represented by a simplified cartoon of its topology and labeled
  by their locus number and heptad classes in parentheses. Chemosensory clusters I/F9
  (orange), II/F6(yellow), and III/F7 (green) are represented in the cartoon. Chemoreceptor
  genes encoded with core components of the system is shown in bold. The arrows show
  the chemoreceptors that could potentially signal through a different chemosensory
  pathway with some experimental evidence (solid) and with bioinformatic evidence
  only (dotted)
