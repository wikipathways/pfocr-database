caption: (A). Overview of the anaerobic cobalamin genetic pathway that was found in
  Rhodocyclus strains DSM 110, DSM 111, and DSM 112. Synteny plots were generated
  in PATRIC [] and genes are colored based on enzymatic family. (B). Overview of the
  anaerobic and aerobic cobalamin metabolic pathways. Enzyme numbering is the same
  as corresponding gene numbers in (A).
