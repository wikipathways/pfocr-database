caption: Canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling. Engagement between TGF-β and
  its receptor initiates canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways. The mature
  fragment of TGF-β1 remains associated with latency-associated peptide (LAP) at N-terminal
  propeptide. LTBPs (latent transforming growth factor β binding proteins) from the
  extracellular matrix (ECM) form the large latent complex (LLC) with TGF-β in the
  endoplasmic reticulum. When TGF-β was released and recognized by receptors, it subsequently
  stimulates the canonical and non-canonical pathways in cells through separate mechanisms.
  In canonical signaling, which is also called the SMAD-dependent pathway, the receptor
  activation triggers a cascade of SMAD proteins phosphorylation and translocation
  into the nucleus, thus promoting the downstream gene expression. While in non-canonical
  signaling, the receptor ligation leads to SMAD non-dependent pathway activation,
  including MEK/ERK pathway, AKT pathway, MAPK, and p38 pathways.
