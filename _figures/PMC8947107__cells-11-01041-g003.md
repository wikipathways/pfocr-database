caption: Glycolysis-induced autophagy inhibition. Stimuli, either tumor cell-autonomous
  or from the TME (extracellular) increase the expression and/or activity of one or
  more glycolytic components (transporters, enzymes or metabolites). This can lead
  to activation of several signaling pathways. One of these pathways is the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway which leads also to AMPK inhibition and, consequently, to autophagy inhibition.
  Autophagy inhibition can occur also due to an inhibitory interaction of a glycolytic
  enzyme with components of the autophagy pathway. AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal transition; PI3K/AKT/mTOR, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase/AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin.
