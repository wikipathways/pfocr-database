caption: (A) The evolutionarily conserved lin-28/let-7/lin-41 heterochronic pathway
  controls the timing of the expression of multiple neuron-specific effectors in the
  male nervous system. The RNA-binding protein LIN-28 controls the expression of the
  miRNA let-7, which in turn controls expression of the RNA-binding protein LIN-41.
  LIN-41 let-7-mediated downregulation at the onset of sexual maturation de-represses
  LIN-41 targets LIN29A, MAB-3 and DMD-3. Expression of these LIN-41 effectors in
  specific neurons in males, at the onset of sexual maturation, constitute effector
  modules directing the precisely timed nervous system masculinization. We hypothesize
  that similar LIN-41 effectors, not identified yet, could be acting in other neurons
  in the male nervous system and in the hermaphrodite nervous system. (B) Temporal,
  sex-specific and neuron-specific intersectional control of nervous system differentiation
  during sexual maturation. A hypothetical male neuron is shown. As discussed above,
  LIN-41 repression of the heterochronic pathway is relieved at the onset of sexual
  maturation, allowing neuron-specific effector proteins to be expressed. In males,
  degradation of the ubiquitously expressed transcriptional repressor TRA-1 allows
  expression of male-specific regulatory effectors (blue boxes same as panel A). The
  neuron type-specificity of regulatory effector gene expression is determined by
  terminal selector transcription factors that control the expression of many other
  neuronal identity features. Hence, terminal selectors define a neuron type-specific,
  but permissive state whose sex- and time-specificity is controlled by factors that
  antagonize the effect of terminal selectors on regulatory effector genes (transcriptionally
  – TRA-1; translationally – LIN-41). Note that features that are controlled by sex/time-specific
  regulatory effectors, exemplified by LIN-29A regulation of neurotransmitter pathway
  genes, are also controlled by terminal selectors, thereby constituting a ‘feedforward’
  regulatory architecture.
