caption: The unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway. In unstressed conditions
  (upper box), the activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1a (IRE1α), pancreatic
  ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6a (ATF6α) is inhibited by
  the binding of Bip/GRP78. During the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, binding
  of glucose regulated protein 78-kDa/binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78/BiP) to
  misfolded proteins allows the activation of IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6α (lower box).
  Activated IRE1α cleaves 26-nucleotides from the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA
  allowing the translation of XBP1; hyper-oligomerized IRE1α executes regulated IRE1a-dependent
  decay (RIDD) activity on selected cytosolic mRNAs (; ). Activated PERK phosphorylates
  the eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2α) leading to attenuation of protein synthesis
  and to the preferential translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)
  mRNA (). ATF6α activation is achieved in the Golgi complex where it undergoes to
  intramembrane proteolysis-specific cleavage by site-1 protease (S1P) and S2P to
  produce a transcriptionally active fragment (pATF6α). XBP1, ATF4, and pATF6α are
  responsible for the execution of the UPR transcriptional program in the nucleus
  ().
