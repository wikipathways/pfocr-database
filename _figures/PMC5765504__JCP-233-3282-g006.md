caption: Network connectivity of differentially regulated genes in the salivary glands
  of klotho‐deficient mice. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was applied to genes showing
  significant dysregulation, with filtering on their relative distance from the mean
  ratio of the population. The first main pathway that appeared to be differentially
  expressed was PPAR γ signaling. Genes belonging to this pathway were significantly
  differentially down‐regulated
