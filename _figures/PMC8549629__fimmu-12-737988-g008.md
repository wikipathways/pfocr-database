caption: Proposed signaling pathway leading from Siglec-8 engagement to eosinophil
  cell death. Cellular events that occur in the cell death process are named in filled
  boxes. Positively identified signaling molecules are placed in boxes outlined in
  blue, candidate molecules that may be involved in the pathway are placed in boxes
  outlined in green, and molecules that do not appear to be involved in the pathway
  are placed in boxes outlined in red. Pharmacological inhibitors are named in red
  text adjacent to their molecular target, and the timing of signaling molecule activation
  is added in bold text adjacent to SFK, ERK1/2, and Btk. The data in this study identify
  and place molecules necessary in this pathway upstream or downstream of the named
  cellular events in the diagram. The precise sequence of molecules is hypothetical
  based on the literature, with well-supported interactions indicated with solid arrows
  and possible interactions indicated with dotted arrows.
