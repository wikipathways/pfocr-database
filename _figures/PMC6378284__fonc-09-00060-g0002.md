caption: The mammalian Hippo pathway signaling. Various signal stimulators activate
  the Hippo pathway, which includes GPCR, cell junction and ECM proteins, and soluble
  factors. These signals regulate the phosphorylation of MST1/2 and LATS1/2 kinases
  to further induce YAP/TAZ activation. Without the upstream signals, KIBRA interacts
  with NF2 to promote the pathway activity. Also, NF2 and MAPK4s directly interact
  with LAST1/2 and promote LATS1/2 phosphorylation (pLATS1/2). Then, pLATS1/2 phosphorylates
  YAP/TAZ. And, the phosphorylated YAP/TAZ presents a 14-3-3 biding site and SCFβTrCP
  specific recognition site, which causes cytoplasmic retention of YAP/TAZ and results
  in YAP/TAZ degradation. YAP protein is also degraded via autophagy. VGLL4 acts as
  a transcriptional repressor by competing with YAP/TAZ for binding TEADs. Unphosphorylated
  YAP/TAZ complex translocates into the nucleus, and acts as transcription coactivators
  by forming complexes with various transcriptional factors, such as TEADs. Binding
  of YAP/TAZ with TEAD prevents VGLL4 from associating with the complex, and consequently
  drives the expression of numerous genes which are related to cell proliferation,
  survival, and migration. The signaling outcome includes induction of cell cycle
  regulator cyclin E, cell-death inhibitor Diap1, connective tissue growth factor
  (CTGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF1), and etc.
