caption: Model for genomic instability-induced cGAS activation and immune response.
  Genomic instability, caused by dMMR or HRD, leads to tumor cells bearing a higher
  neoantigen load. Additionally, the instability of the tumor genome also causes the
  activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which in turn up-regulates the expression
  of chemokines and attracts immune cells to migrate to tumor tissue.
