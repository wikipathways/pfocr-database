caption: The C3Gs include DDD and C3GN and share a common dysregulation at the level
  of the C3 and C5 convertases. It is possible that the relative degree of convertase
  dysregulation differs between DDD and C3GN. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody
  to C5 that prevents cleavage of C5 to C5a and C5b. In the absence of C5b, MAC and
  sMAC cannot be generated, thus halting the contribution of the terminal complement
  cascade to the disease process. However more proximal dysregulation at the level
  of the C3 convertase of the alternative pathway continues unchecked, the consequence
  of which is progression of disease.
