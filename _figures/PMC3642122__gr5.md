caption: Schema of the possible roles of Trp-His on CaMK II-mediated VDCC phosphorylation
  in VSMCs. We demonstrated that Trp-His inhibited the Ang II-induced activation of
  CaMK II and inhibited Ang II-induced phosphorylation of VDCCs. Considering that
  CaMK II is involved in the phosphorylation of VDCCs followed by the facilitation
  of Ca2+ influx via VDCCs, these data suggest that Trp-His plays a potential role
  in the regulation of [Ca2+]i by its blockade of the CaMK II-VDCC phosphorylation
  pathway. The potential of Trp-His to act on the Ca2+-CaM/CaMK II signaling pathways
  remains unclear, and further investigations are currently in progress.
