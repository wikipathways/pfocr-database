caption: 'Mechanisms of action by which extracellular vesicles (EVs) exert their immunomodulatory
  effects after myocardial injury. EVs can modulate immune cell response after cardiac
  damage in two ways: reducing monocyte infiltration and modulating macrophage polarization.
  (a,c) Different microRNAs (miRNAs) are responsible for decreasing pro-inflammatory
  cytokine and chemokine secretion on different cell types in the heart, which reduces
  cardiac inflammation. (b) miR-24-3p decreases the expression of C-C chemokine receptor
  type 2 (CCR2) on the surface of monocytes, reducing their recruitment in the heart
  where high levels of C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) are present. (d) Pregnancy-associated
  plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) increases the extracellular levels of insulin growth factor-1
  (IGF-1), which decreases the pro-inflammatory phenotype on macrophages. (e–h) Embryonic
  stem cell (ESC) and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived EVs stimulate anti-inflammatory
  M2 polarization on macrophages via different molecular mechanisms: inhibition of
  toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3
  (NLRP3) pathway, inhibition of nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  or activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and sphingosine-1-phosphate
  receptor 1 (S1PR1) pathway. (i,j) Cardiosphere-derived cell (CDC)-derived EVs increase
  phagocytosis activity by increasing complement factor C1qa expression or via unknown
  pathways. (k) CDC-EVs enriched in miR-26a suppressed disintegrin and metalloprotease
  17 (Adam17) on macrophages, which sustains tyrosine-protein kinase Mer (MERTK) expression
  by decreasing the cleavage of this receptor, enhancing the efferocytosis ability
  of macrophages. A question mark is placed inside of an EV (circle) or before an
  arrow in case of the EV cargo responsible for the therapeutic effect is unknown.
