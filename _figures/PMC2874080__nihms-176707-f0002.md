caption: Pathway of de novo synthesis of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids
  and regulation of lipogenic genes by transcription factors (LXR, SREBP-1c and ChREBP).
  NADPH is required for fatty acid synthesis and three chemical reactions yield NADPH
  (inset). PGC-1β has been shown to coactivate LXR and SREBP-1c, as discussed in the
  text. ACL, ATP-citrate lyase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase;
  ELOVL6, elongation of long-chain fatty acids family member 6 (elongase 6); SCD,
  stearoyl-CoA desaturase; LXR, liver X receptor; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein 1c; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element binding protein; ME, malic enzyme;
  G6PD, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGD, Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Color
  version of figure is available online.
