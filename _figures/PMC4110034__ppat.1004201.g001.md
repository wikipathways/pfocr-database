caption: Intrinsic apoptosis is dependent on mitochondrial damage by Bax and Bak and
  activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 can also be activated via cell surface receptors
  such as TNFR in the pathway of extrinsic apoptosis. Pyroptosis depends on caspase-1,
  which is activated by cytosolic NLRs, and caspase-11, for which the precise signaling
  pathway needs to be determined. Necroptosis requires Ripk1 and 3 and MLKL. Representative
  intracellular pathogens are listed that modulate these host suicide programs, either
  by blocking (red) or inducing (green) their activation.
