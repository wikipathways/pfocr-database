caption: 'The KP-mediated immune tolerance and cancer invasion: KP promotes immune
  tolerance by two different mechanisms. Firstly, elevated IDO1/TDO2 enzyme activity
  in either tumour or immune cell depletes TRP concentration in its local tumour environment.
  A TRP-stripped environment induces cell arrest in T-cells while inducing differentiation
  and proliferation of Treg cells. Secondly, downstream KP metabolites induce cell
  arrest in T-cells and Treg proliferation by either interaction with AhR or by direct
  interaction with immune cells themselves. In addition to KP-mediated immune tolerance,
  elevated KP promotes cancer cell motility and proliferation by either overproduction
  of NAD+ for cellular repair or byactivation of AhR.'
