caption: Induction of IL-36 cytokine expression by TLR agonists and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. (A) il36 transcription is triggered by the activation of several cell
  surface TLRs such as TLR1/2, TLR2/6, TLR5 and TLR4. The possible intracellular pathway
  that induces il36 transcription downstream of TLRs activation involves signaling
  via IRAK/TRAF and p38/JNK/NFκB, followed by the translocation of AP1 and NFκB to
  the nucleus. Intracellular TLRs such as TLR3 and TLR7 can also induce il36 transcription.
  These receptors can activate IRF3/7 which may induce the transcription of il36.
  (B) il36 expression is induced by several pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β,
  TNF-α, IL-17A, IL-18, IFN-γ and IL-36 cytokines. IL-1β-mediated induction of il36
  expression via IL1R-IL1AcP involves the ERK/p38/JNK/NFκB signaling and subsequent
  activation of the transcription factors c-Jun, T-bet and NFκB. The exact pathway
  via which other cytokines induce il36 transcription has not been determined yet
  but likely involves similar intracellular signaling molecules.
