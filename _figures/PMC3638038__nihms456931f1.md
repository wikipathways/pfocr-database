caption: 'Potential mechanisms include: (A) Limiting direct presentation of ESC derived
  antigens: Limited MHC-II expression by ESCs favors the indirect pathway of antigen
  recognition wherein ESC-derived antigens (orange) are either shed from the surface
  or collected from dying/apoptotic ESCs by recipient APCs (blue) and re-presented
  to recipient T cells. In the direct pathway (left side of panel), T cells engage
  with APCs of donor origin (red) and recognize the donor APC’s MHC-II molecule and/or
  donor-derived antigen. (B) Expression of ESC-arginase I depletes L-arginine (orange
  circles) from the local environment, which renders responder T cells unresponsive,
  possibly through downregulation of the TCR-associated CD3-ζ chain (green). (C) hESC
  protein extracts (pink circles) may prevent the maturation of dendritic cells by
  decreasing the expression of CD80, HLA-DR, and CD83, as well as decreasing the production
  of IL-12p40 (yellow circle), which presumably will decrease the expression of IL-12
  and IL-23. (D) Future studies may clarify whether ESCs can influence the polarization
  of naïve T cells towards a regulatory phenotype; the question marks indicate that
  the mechanism remains to be clarified.'
