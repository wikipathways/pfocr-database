caption: Metabolic pathways of glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of oral
  keratinocytes (a) and oral fibroblasts (b) in hypoxic culture (n = 6). Quantified
  metabolite concentrations are shown as bars; ambient oxygen cultured (blue), 2%
  O2 for 24 h, 2% O2 for 72 h, 0.5% O2 for 24 h, and 0.5% O2 for 72 h from the left,
  respectively. p-values were calculated using Student’s t-test (two-tailed, unequal
  variance). * p 0.05 was shown for comparison between each data with data for 20%
  oxygen.
