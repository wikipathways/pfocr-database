caption: Similarly, mitophagy, the selective degradation of damaged or dysfunctional
  mitochondria, follows an analogous pathway. Dysfunctional mitochondria are tagged
  for degradation by autophagy adaptors such as p62/SQSTM1, which contains binding
  domains for ubiquitin and LC3. The process is facilitated by the ubiquitination
  of outer mitochondrial membrane OMM proteins by parkin, following recruitment and
  phosphorylation by PINK1. p62/Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1), a selective autophagy receptor
  for degradation of ubiquitinated substrates; LC3, Microtubule-associated protein
  1 light chain 3 beta; PINK1, Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative
  kinase 1; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane
