caption: 'Signal transduction pathways that regulate the initiation of meiosis in
  fission yeast. Four pathways that regulate expression of the ste11 gene, which encodes
  a transcription factor crucial for sexual development, are schematically depicted.
  From left to right: The cAMP pathway response to glucose; the TORC1 pathway response
  to nitrogen sources; the MAP kinase pathway response to mating pheromones; and the
  MAP kinase pathway response to environmental stresses. The former two pathways down-regulate,
  whereas the latter two up-regulate, ste11 expression. Reproduced from Ref.  with
  some modifications.'
