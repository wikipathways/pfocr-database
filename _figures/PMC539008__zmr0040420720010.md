caption: Ribosome synthesis and growth rate. The states of the feedback loop that
  connects ribosome function and ribosome production to achieve an optimal growth
  rate in minimal (A) and rich (B) nutrient environments are illustrated. When the
  system is in balance, expanded growth and the rate of production of new ribosomes
  are tuned to the cellular capacity to increase the supply of amino acids and other
  substrates required to support protein synthesis. In the two examples, the concentrations
  of cellular components within the feedback circuit (amino acids, ppGpp, free RNA
  polymerase, and Fis) are indicated by the sizes of the ovals. The fluxes at different
  steps in the circuit (supply of amino acids, production of ppGpp, interaction of
  free RNA polymerase with the rrn P1 and P2 promoters, and ribosome biogenesis pathway)
  are indicated by the sizes of the arrows. During growth in minimal medium, where
  ribosome function is suboptimal, both ppGpp hydrolyase and ppGpp synthetase activities
  are produced from expression of the spoT gene, and ppGpp accumulates. During growth
  in rich medium, where ribosome function is optimal, only ppGpp hydrolyase is produced,
  and ppGpp does not accumulate. The relative strengths of the rrn P1 and P2 promoters
  (Vmax/Km) are illustrated by the sizes of the promoter rectangles. Important interactions
  are illustrated as solid lines connecting components. For example, during slow growth
  in nutritionally poor medium, the high concentration of ppGpp binds to the RNA polymerase
  and (i) inhibits the production of the rrn P1 transcriptional activator Fis and
  (ii) reduces the rrn P1 promoter strength (Vmax/Km). During rapid growth in rich
  medium, where the ppGpp concentration is low, Fis accumulates and activates the
  P1 promoter. For details, see the text. The ppGpp hydrolyase and PSII ppGpp synthetase
  are alternative activities encoded by the spoT gene.

  description: Ribosome synthesis and growth rate. The states of the feedback loop
    that connects ribosome function and ribosome production to achieve an optimal
    growth rate in minimal (A) and rich (B) nutrient environments are illustrated.
    When the system is in balance, expanded growth and the rate of production of new
    ribosomes are tuned to the cellular capacity to increase the supply of amino acids
    and other substrates required to support protein synthesis. In the two examples,
    the concentrations of cellular components within the feedback circuit (amino acids,

    The fluxes at different steps in the circuit (supply of amino acids, production
    of ppGpp, interaction of free RNA polymerase with the rrn P1 and P2 promoters,
    and ribosome biogenesis pathway) are indicated by the sizes of the arrows. During
    growth in minimal medium, where ribosome function is suboptimal, both ppGpp hydrolyase
    and ppGpp synthetase activities are produced from expression of the spoT gene,
    and ppGpp accumulates. During growth in rich medium, where ribosome function is
    optimal, only ppGpp hydrolyase is produced, and ppGpp does not accumulate. The
    relative strengths of the rrn P1 and P2 promoters (Vmax/Km) are illustrated by
