  Kinase; AHK5/CKI2—Arabidopsis Histidine Kinase 5/Cytokinin Independent 2; CHARK-CHASE
  domain receptor serine/threonine kinase, cytokinin receptor; CKI1—Cytokinin Independent
  1, histidine kinase; CRFs—Cytokinin Response Factors; ER—endoplasmic reticulum;
  ETR1—Ethylene Response 1, ethylene receptor, histidine kinase; HPts—phosphotransfer
  proteins; PHPs—pseudo-phosphotransfer proteins; PhyB—phytochrome B; OsRAC3—GTP binding
  protein of GTPase Rac/Rop family; RRA—type-A response regulator; RRB—type-B response
  regulator; RRC—type-C response regulator; SnRK2s—Sucrose non-fermenting-1-Related
  Protein Kinases 2; TFs—transcription factors; w/o RD—without receiver domain. Active
