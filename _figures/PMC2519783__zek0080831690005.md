caption: Model depicting the role of Hog1 during arsenite exposure. Long-term exposure
  to arsenite results in Hog1-independent cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2/M. After
  a transient delay, wild-type cells adapt and resume growth despite the presence
  of arsenite. In contrast, cells lacking Hog1 are not able to exit the G1 arrest
  to restart the cell cycle. When Hog1 is absent, stimulation of the Sho1/Mbs2 branch
  of the HOG pathway results in cross talk signaling to the pheromone pathway, phosphorylation
  of the MAPK Fus3, and activation of mating response, including G1 cell cycle arrest.
  However, suppressing cross talk signaling in the hog1Δ mutant by deleting SHO1 and
  MSB2 does not relieve arsenite-induced persistent G1 delay. This suggests that Hog1
  itself may regulate specific targets to promote adaptation to G1 cell cycle arrest.
  Indeed, we found that arsenite-induced G1 arrest is associated with stabilization
  of the Cdk inhibitor Sic1 and that Hog1 is required to induce Sic1 degradation and
  promote exit from G1 phase. In addition, Hog1 downregulates the activity of the
  glycerol channel Fps1 to reduce arsenite influx (). As(III), arsenite.
