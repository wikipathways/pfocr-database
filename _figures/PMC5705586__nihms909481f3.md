caption: Schematic overview of canonical TGF-β/SMAD signaling. The extracellular TGF-β
  ligand binds to the TGF-βRII receptor, which subsequently phosphorylates TGF-βRI
  and propagates the growth factor signal. In the canonical signaling pathway, TGF-βRI
  phosphorylates serine residues in the C-terminal, MH2 region of SMAD2 and SMAD3.
  When phosphorylated, these residues are able to associate with SMAD4 and translocate
  to the nucleus, where the SMAD complex associates with other protein co-factors
  (not shown) at SMAD binding elements (SBEs) located in the promoters of particular
  genes, driving expression of these genes. The inhibitory protein SMAD7 inhibits
  the interaction between TGF-βRI and SMAD2, thus preventing SMAD2 phosphorylation
  and subsequent association with SMAD4, which is necessary for nuclear translocation
  and promotion of further TGF-β-mediated signal transduction.
