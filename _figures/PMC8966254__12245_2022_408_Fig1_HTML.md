caption: Mechanisms of angioedema [, –]. A Histamine induced. Upon exposure to an
  allergen, it is taken up by antigen-presenting cells (e.g. dendritic cells) and
  proteolyzed to produce small peptides. These peptides are then presented with major
  histocompatibility (MHC) class II antigen as a complex on the cell surface and recognised
  by T-helper (Th) lymphocyte receptors. This leads to the activation of T cells and
  release of Th2 cytokines that promote the differentiation of B cells to plasma cells
  and the production of specific IgE antibodies that recognise the original antigen.
  These antibodies bind to high-affinity IgE receptor FcεRI on mast cells and persist
  for weeks, months or years. Upon re-exposure to the allergen, the allergenic peptide
  is recognised by these bound IgEs, activating the mast cells to release bioactive
  mediators such as histamine. Binding of histamine on selective receptors of the
  vascular endothelium causes vasodilation and increased permeability. Mast cells
  can also be activated and triggered to produce histamine mediators through non-IgE-mediated
  response. B Bradykinin-induced. The contact pathway is initiated when factor XII
  (or Hageman factor) binds to damaged tissue and converts to factor XIIa, which then
  converts prekallikrein to plasma kallikrein. Finally, kallikrein cleaves HMWK to
  form bradykinin, which binds B2 receptors on the vascular endothelium, triggering
  vasodilation and increased permeability. Plasmin from the fibrinolytic system can
  convert factor XII into factor XIIa, accelerating the bradykinin production from
  HMWK. Multiple biological and pharmacological inhibitors can be used to treat bradykinin-induced
  angioedema. C1-INH can act on multiple stages of the contact and fibrinolytic system
  to inhibit the production of bradykinin. Ecallantide is a kallikrein inhibitor that
  blocks the cleavage of HMWK into bradykinin, and icatibant is an antagonist that
  prevents bradykinin from binding to its receptor
