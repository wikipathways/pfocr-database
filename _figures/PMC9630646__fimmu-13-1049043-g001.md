caption: Tumor microenvironment (TME) is composed of tumor cells, immune cells, stromal
  cells, extracellular matrix, and exosomes, thus forming a microenvironment with
  the characteristics of inflammation, hypoxia, acidity, and immunosuppression. Different
  types of cells in TME have their preferred metabolic phenotypes. OXPHOS, oxidative
  phosphorylation; HBP, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor cell; Treg cell, regulatory T cell; M2-TAM, immunosuppressive
  macrophages; Tmem cell, CD8+ memory T cells; DC, dendritic cell; Teff cell, CD8+
  effector T cells; NK cell, natural killer cell; M1-TAM, inflammatory tumor-associated
  macrophages; CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-2, Interleukin-2; IFN-γ, Interferon-γ; ECM, extracellular
  matrix.
