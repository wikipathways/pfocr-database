caption: 'Mechanism of action and classification of E3 ubiquitin ligases causing neurological
  diseases in human. (A) Ubiquitination cascade. E1 enzymes activate ubiquitin (Ub)
  in an ATP-dependent manner, forming a thioester bound with Ub. Activated-Ub is then
  transferred to Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2). Finally, E3 ubiquitin ligases assist
  or directly catalyze the transfer of Ub to substrates. Substrates can be mono-,
  multi- or poly-ubiquitinated, with different types of Ub chains, to modulate various
  processes, including protein activation, interaction, trafficking, subcellular localization,
  and degradation through the 26S proteasome or the autophagy pathway. (B) E3 ligases
  underlying neurological diseases and their classification. The three classes of
  E3 (HECT, RING, and RING-HECT hybrid) are represented. E3 ligases identified as
  the genetic cause of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases in human
  are classified within each category (sub-classes with no disease representative
  are not shown). The HECT and RING E3 ligases differ in the way they transfer Ub
  to the substrate. The HECT E3s receive Ub from E2 enzymes, form a thioester intermediate
  with Ub, and catalyze the transfer to the substrate. RING E3s associate with E2
  enzymes and substrates and mediate the transfer of Ub from E2 to the substrate.
  RING E3s can function as monomers, dimers or multi-subunit RING E3s. The latter
  class is subdivided in different groups, among which the Cullin-RING Ligases (CRLs)
  are the largest E3 ligase family. SCF, ECS, CRL3 and CRL4 ligases are composed of
  a modular E3 core containing specific Cullins (respectively CUL1, CUL2/5, CUL3,
  CUL4) and RBX1 (RING-box1 proteins), and a substrate specificity module composed
  of an adaptor (Skp1, EloC, and DDB1) and a substrate receptor. The RING-HECT hybrid
  ligases (RBR for RING-between-RING) interact with E2 as the RING E3 but transfer
  Ub with HECT-like mechanism. Finally, particular E3 are represented (“Others”):
  RanBP2 does not transfer Ub but Sumo (small ubiquitin-related modifier) and is neither
  an HECT, nor a RING E3 ligase; TOPORS has a RING domain and is a dual E3 Ub and
  Sumo ligase.'
