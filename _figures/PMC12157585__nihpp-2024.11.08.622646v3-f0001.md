caption: '(A) Simplified pathway of fatty acid synthesis and desaturation in C. elegans.
  Boxes indicate the name of the enzymes, FAT-2 desaturase is indicated in a red box.
  Fatty acids of which the synthesis is dependent on FAT-2 are indicated in red. Fatty
  acid abbreviations are as follow: palmitic acid (PA), palmitoleic acid (POA), vaccenic
  acid (VA), stearic acid (SA), oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA), alpha-linolenic
  acid (ALA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), stearidonic acid (STA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic
  acid (DGLA), eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA), arachidonic acid (AA), and eicosapentaenoic
  acid (EPA). (B) AlphaFold2 predicted FAT-2 structure with the serine at position
  101 indicated with a red arrow. (C) Same structure as in B, zoomed in and angled
  to show that the S101 position that is mutated to phenylalanine in the fat-2(wa17)
  allele lies in a loop connecting two alpha helices'
