caption: Schematic model for neuronal pathways controlling cutaneous vasomotor activity.
  Cutaneous vasoconstrictor sympathetic premotor neurons in the medullary raphé excite
  cutaneous vasoconstrictor sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal intermediolateral
  nucleus at least in part by serotonergic (5-HT) activation of 5-HT2A receptors and
  by glutamatergic (GLU) activation. Excitatory drive from the rostral ventrolateral
  medulla (RVLM) contributes to maintaining cutaneous sympathetic tone. Temperature-responsive
  neurons in the caudolateral preoptic region (CLPO) and rostromedial preoptic region
  (RMPO) provide thermoregulatory control of cutaneous vasomotor response to cold
  or warm stimuli. Warm-responsive preoptic neurons send direct inhibitory (GABAergic)
  projections to the medullary raphé. The warm-responsive neurons inhibit cutaneous
  sympathetic premotor neurons under warm-condition and contribute to cutaneous vasodilator
  response. Some of warm-responsive neurons exert inhibitory influence on cutaneous
  sympathetic outflow by inhibiting cutaneous vasoconstrictor neurons in the ventral
  tegmental area (VTA) that may provide excitatory drive to the medullary raphé neurons,
  or by activating cutaneous vasodilatative neurons in the rostral ventrolateral periaqueductal
  gray (rvlPAG) that may provide inhibitory drive the medullary raphé neurons. Cold-responsive
  RMPO neurons send direct excitatory (glutamatergic) projections to the medullary
  raphé. The cold-responsive neurons excite cutaneous sympathetic premotor neurons
  in the cold, and contribute to cutaneous vasoconstriction. The cold-responsive RMPO
  neurons receive tonic GABAergic inputs under warm-condition. PGE2 possibly inhibits
  GABAergic interneurons in the RMPO that send direct projection to cold-responsive
  neurons in the RMPO, and elicit cutaneous vasoconstriction by reducing inhibitory
  influence on the medullary raphé neurons. The GABAergic interneurons may also exert
  inhibitory influence on the medullary raphé neurons via other indirect pathway.
  During aversive psychological events, cutaneous vasoconstrictor sympathetic premotor
  neurons in the medullary raphé are activated at least in part by excitatory drive
  from neurons in the amygdala, the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), and orexinergic
  neurons in the hypothalamic area (lateral hypothalamus (LH), perifornical area (PeF)
  and DMH). Noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) contribute to the excitatory
  drive via the amygdala. Activation of the neurons in the habenula elicits cutaneous
  vasoconstriction possibly by activation of the medullary raphé neurons. Solid black
  line with a question mark indicates that the pathway is not established. Solid black
  with dashed lines indicates that it is not known whether pathway is direct or indirect.
