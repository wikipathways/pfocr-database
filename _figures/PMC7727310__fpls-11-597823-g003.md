caption: 'Pathway map summarizing the effect of growth stage (pre-germination and
  leaf rosette) and photoperiodic lighting treatments: NL, NL + photoperiodic lighting
  with fluorescence light (FL), NL + photoperiodic lighting with LEDs R:FR 3:1 (R:FR
  3:1), and NL + photoperiodic lighting with LEDs R:FR 1:3 (R:FR 1:3), on leaves and
  tuberous roots of the two hybrids MBO (A) and MDR (B) of Ranunculus asiaticus L.
  The heat map results were calculated as Logarithm base 1.5 (Log1.5) of single values/total
  average values and visualized using a false-color scale, with red indicating an
  increase and blue a decrease. The significant ratios were indicated in the squares.'
