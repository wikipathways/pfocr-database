caption: Proposed pathway based on data from the present study showing increased Nox4
  expression in response to stretch. Stretch increases cytosolic ROS via mitochondrial
  complex III, triggering a feed-forward mechanism via NF-κB, resulting in increased
  Nox4 expression and a sustained increase in cytosolic ROS. Nox4 increases cyclin
  D1 expression, leading to PASMC proliferation and vascular remodeling. Dashed lines
  highlight other potential pathways, as evidenced by the literature, but not investigated
  in the present study. Increased cyclin D1 expression may contribute to the positive
  feedback mechanism via the release of E2F, which have been shown to upregulate Nox4
  expression. There is increasing evidence of cross talk between Nox isoforms and
  mitochondrial ROS, and increased Nox4 expression may augment ROS generation at complex
  III.
