caption: Overview of TLR signaling and the endogenous DAMP pathway in systemic JIA
  and AOSD. Regarding the role of TLR and its ligands in the pathogenesis of systemic
  JIA and AOSD, current evidence suggests that endogenous ligands, such as S100A8,
  S100A9, and S100A8/A9, and HMGB1, interact with and stimulate the TLR4 pathway.
  Activated TLR4 and TLR7 induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the secretion of
  IL-1β in systemic JIA and AOSD.
