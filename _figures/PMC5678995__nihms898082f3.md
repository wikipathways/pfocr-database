caption: Trans-omics of pABA effects of P. gingivalis on the tetrahydrofolate metabolic
  pathway. Red, blue and yellow short arrows represent proteins up-, down-, or non-regulated
  by pABA respectively (see Methods for statistical thresholds). * represents a non-detect
  in the proteome but down regulated at the transcriptional level. Ϯ represents a
  protein unchanged in the proteome but upregulated at the transcriptional level.
  Red and blue connecting arrows represent functionally predicted up- and down-regulation
  respectively. Blue font denotes PLP-dependent enzymes whose functions were suppressed
  as shown in the metabolome (). Red and blue boxes represent increased and decreased
  metabolite production respectively.
