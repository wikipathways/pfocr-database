caption: Heme synthethic pathway. The rate-limiting synthetic enzymes are believed
  to be ALA synthase and, in part, porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). Both enzymes
  exist in adipocytes and in erythroid and non-erythroid forms. In non-erythroid cells
  such as liver, kidney, heart, ALA synthase essentially plays a housekeeping role,
  maintaining intracellular heme levels. High levels of heme thus repress the synthesis
  of ALA synthase while stimulating heme degradation through the induction of HO-1
  ,. In the origin of hematopoietic-derived cells such as adipocyte and erythroid
  cells, heme is essential for cellular proliferation and differentiation ,,, and
  increase ALA synthase mRNA levels and enzyme activity. Further, excess heme enhances
  the synthesis of globin mRNA  An iron-binding element has been located on the 5’
  untranslated region of the erythroid type cells ALA synthase, so it is possible
  that the enzyme is actually regulated by intracellular levels of iron. Thus, an
  increase in heme may induce HO, increasing the levels of free iron which in turn
  stimulate the formation of adipocyte ALA synthase mRNA and adipocyte during differentiations.
