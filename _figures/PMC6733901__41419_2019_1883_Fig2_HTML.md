caption: The canonical pathway upon sensing DAMPs, PAMPs or other cytosolic disturbances
  results in the recruitment and activation of caspase-1 either directly or through
  recruitment of the receptor protein ASC. Caspase-1 successively promotes maturation
  of the precursors of IL-1β and IL-18 into mature forms and cleaves GSDMD. The pore
  form domain (PFD) of GSDMD interacts with the plasma membrane to form GSDMD pores,
  resulting in the release of intracellular contents, including IL-1β and IL-18. The
  noncanonical pathway is initiated by the caspase-11 self-detection of cytosolic
  LPS in Gram-negative bacteria. Activated caspase-11 (caspase-4 or caspase-5 in humans)
  successively cleaves GSDMD and induces pyroptosis. The other pathway of pyroptosis
  can be engaged through mechanisms such as CASP8-GSDMD and CASP3-GSDME. In turn,
  activated caspase-3 cleaves GSDME to produce GSDMD-cNT, which forms pores in the
  plasma membrane and activates pyroptosis. The bacteria are recognized by TLR4, which
  signals via RIP1 to form a cell death complex consisting of RIP1, caspase-8, and
  FADD. Both this complex cleavage of GSDMD and activation through caspase 1/11 and
  GSDME cleavage via caspase-3 lead to cell membrane permeabilization and subsequent
  pyroptosis. In addition, neutrophil elastase (NE) is able to cleave GSDMD independently
  of caspase activity
