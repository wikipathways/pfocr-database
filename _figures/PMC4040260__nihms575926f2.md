caption: a. Bacterial infection. Following phagocytosis of invading bacteria, neutrophils
  frequently undergo a form of ‘phagocytosis induced cell death’ (PICD) with subsequent
  engulfment by surrounding phagocytes, providing a second round of pathogen destruction.
  The engulfing phagocytes also increase production of pro-resolving lipid mediator
  release (for example RvD1) with enhanced host-directed bacterial killing. b. Acute
  inflammation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are produced at sites of acute
  inflammation impair phagocytosis through the activation of RhoA within phagocytes.
  Scavenging ROS (for example by using N-acetylcystein; NAC) enhances apoptotic cell
  clearance. c. Glucocorticoids can potentially augment eosinophil clearance by promoting
  both eosinophil apoptosis and cell clearance via a protein S–Mer-dependent pathway.
  d. Atherosclerosis. Impaired engulfment in atherosclerosis is, in part, mediated
  by increased activity of RhoA and its downstream mediator ROCK, both of which are
  negative regulators of apoptotic cell engulfment. RhoA inhibition by HMG-CoA reductase
  inhibitors (statins) or ROCK inhibition seems to have a beneficial effect in atherosclerosis,
  possibly by regulating engulfment. e. Rheumatoid arthritis. At sites of inflammation,
  extracellular damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as histones and
  HMGB1 negatively regulate apoptotic cell engulfment by binding to integrins on the
  surface of phagocytes. Strategies to degrade DAMPs (for example through the degradation
  of histone H3 by antigen presenting cells (APCs)) can improve apoptotic cell clearance.
  f. Recognition and uptake of donor apoptotic cells by recipient DCs and macrophages
  can promote donor-specific tolerance in the recipients and limit allograft rejection.
  g. Induction of tumour cell death accompanied with CRT and DAMPs exposure can promote
  DC-mediated engulfment and DC maturation to initiate an anti-tumour immune response.
  h. Targeting tumour cells with anti-CD47 blocking antibodies or soluble SIRPα variants
  inhibits CD47-SIRPα interaction and facilitates tumour cell removal by macrophages.
