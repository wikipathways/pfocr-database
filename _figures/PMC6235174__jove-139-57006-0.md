caption: The physiological rationale of the technique is based on the measurement
  of the potential difference between the airway epithelium in the nostril and the
  subcutaneous compartment. Ion channel activities are explored by measuring the stable
  maximal baseline potential difference (PD), its changes after blocking the ENaC
  related Na+ absorption and driving Cl- secretion via different apical Cl- transporters
  including CFTR. CFTR dysfunction is shown by a minimal change in potential difference
  upon stimulation of Cl- secretion through a cAMP dependent pathway and an increased
  ENaC mediated Na+ absorption as detected by a more negative baseline potential difference
  and an enhanced response to amiloride. The mechanistic basis for CF versus normal
  PD is summarized in .
