caption: Model of the recruitment of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins to phosphorylated
  HP1 at damaged sites. Shown is the graphical representation of nucleosomes (histone
  octamer in purple, DNA in blue) containing H3K9 methylation (yellow circles) to
  which HP1 is bound (green). DNA damage (indicated by DSB) could trigger the CSD-dependent
  binding of HP1 to chromatin directly (upper pathway). In this scenario, damage-bound
  HP1 is phosphorylated (indicated by P), which may allow phosphorylation-dependent
  interactions with DDR proteins (in yellow) containing, for instance, a BRCT or FHA
  domain. Alternatively, the binding of HP1 could be preceded by the binding of a
  damage-binding protein containing a PXVXL motif (indicated in red in the lower pathway).
  This protein subsequently recruits HP1 through interactions between the PXVXL motif
  and the CSD of HP1. After that, phosphorylated HP1 may have phosphorylation-dependent
  interactions with DDR proteins.
