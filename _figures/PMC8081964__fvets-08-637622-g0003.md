caption: Notch/HES1-associated miRNA–mRNA interactions. Dysregulated genes are shown
  as ovals or polygons, dysregulated miRNAs are shown in text boxes. In both cases,
  red indicates expression that is higher in tumors than in normal bone, blue indicates
  expression that is lower in tumors, and purple indicates that one probe in the Affymetrix
  array showed NFKB1 as upregulated and another as downregulated. Genes on the left
  are ligands or inhibitors of Notch; genes on the right are downstream targets of
  the Notch signaling pathway and/or specifically interact with HES1.
