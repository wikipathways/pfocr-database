caption: A working model of the C. albicans glucose-sensing network. Three independent
  yet interconnected signal transduction cascades are triggered by glucose in C. albicans
  to produce a coordinated response. The asterisks indicate mechanisms inferred from
  work with S. cerevisiae. Glucose is indicated by blue hexagons, galactose by a gray
  hexagon, and sucrose by a disaccharide (linked hexagon and pentagon). Components
  and processes activated in the presence of glucose are shown in black, while those
  that are inactivated by glucose are shown in gray. Kinases are indicated as stars.
  The red lines indicate repression, and the green lines indicate activation; certain
  genes are derepressed by low levels of glucose but repressed under high-glucose
  conditions. The SRR pathway (center) is as follows. Hgt4 senses extracellular glucose
  or galactose, which initiates Yck2-mediated phosphorylation, and SCFGrr1-mediated
  ubiquitylation, of the transcriptional corepressor Std1, resulting in its degradation
  (, ). Cellular depletion of Std1 is followed by phosphorylation of the Rgt1 transcriptional
  repressor by PKA, rendering it inactive (). Expression of Rgt1 target genes, including
  those involved in alternative respiration, fermentation, and glucose repression,
  and the HGT genes for hexose import, is derepressed (, , ). The glucose repression
  pathway (left) is as follows. Upon hexose influx through the Hgt transporters, intracellular
  glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate, primarily through the action of
  the hexokinase Hxk2 (). Subsequent glycolysis raises cellular ATP levels, and under
  conditions of glucose abundance (>0.2% for C. albicans), this instigates the dephosphorylation/inactivation
  of the Snf1 kinase through the action of the Reg1/Glc7 phosphatase complex (, ,
  ). The absence of Snf1 activity enables the Mig1/Mig2 transcriptional repressors
  to mediate the repression of genes required for the use of alternative (nonfermentable)
  carbon sources, genes involved in the adenylate cyclase pathway, and high-affinity
  HGT genes needed only when glucose is scarce (, , , ). The adenylate cyclase pathway
  (right) is as follows. Either activated Gpr1/Gpa2-GTP (, , ) or activated Ras1-GTP
  () (or both) stimulates the Cyr1/Cdc35 adenylate cyclase through mechanisms that
  appear to require intracellular phosphorylated glucose (). The noncanonical Gβ protein
  Asc1 antagonizes the Gpr1 branch of this pathway (). Activated Cyr1/Cdc35 requires
  the cyclase-associated protein Cap1 to generate cAMP from ATP (, ), and the cellular
  abundance of cAMP is downregulated mainly through the action of the phosphodiesterase
  Pde2 (, ). Increased cAMP levels inactivate the Bcy1 inhibitory subunit of PKA ().
  Once activated, PKA phosphorylates the Efg1 transcription factor (), which functions
  as an activator for hypha-specific genes and for genes that promote virulence (,
  ) but also acts as a feedback repressor for EFG1 ().
