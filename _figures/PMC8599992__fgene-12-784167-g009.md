caption: 'SLX4IP is a critical regulator of the alternative lengthening of telomeres
  (ALT) pathway. (A) The 3′ G-rich tail undergoes intertelomeric strand invasion,
  generating a branched DNA structure called a displacement-loop (D-loop). Strand
  invasion promotes break-induced telomere synthesis using one of several different
  polymerases, shown here as Pol. Telomere extension is regulated by the opposing
  actions of structure-selective endonucleases and a helicase-topoisomerase complex.
  In the resolution pathway (left), the D-loop is cleaved/resolved by the endonucleases
  bound to SLX4, resulting a telomere exchange event (crossover) in the absence of
  telomere extension. In the dissolution pathway (right), a protein complex containing
  the BLM helicase, TOPIIIα topoisomerase, and RMI1/2 proteins promotes branch migration
  and long tract telomere synthesis, followed by D-loop dissolution into non-crossover
  products. Recent work shows that SLX4IP functions in both pathways through its interactions
  with SLX4, XPF and BLM. Circles indicate 5′-termini. (B) Current model depicting
  SLX4IP as a protein that balances the two molecular pathways that regulate telomere
  length in ALT cells: resolution of recombining telomeres by SLX4 and its associated
  endonucleases and dissolution of recombining telomeres by the BTR complex. The presence
  of SLX4IP is essential for telomere length maintenance in ALT cells, as well as
  cell proliferation and survival. More work is needed to determine the mechanism(s)
  by which SLX4IP achieves this balance.'
