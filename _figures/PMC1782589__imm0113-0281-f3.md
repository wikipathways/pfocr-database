caption: IL-10, IL-22 and IL-22 receptor signalling. Binding of IL-10, IL-22 and IL-26
  to their respective receptor complex results in the initiation of various signalling
  cascades. In all cases the JAK/STAT pathway is the primary pathway known to be activated
  by ligand binding. IL-10 also activates the PI-3K pathway via the binding of the
  IRS-2 adaptor molecule to the IL-10R complex. STAT-1 and SHP-1 have also been shown
  to be activated by IL-10, however, the former is only induced with IFN-γ; preincubation.
  IL-22 and IL-26, like IL-10, initiate the dimerization of STAT-3, however, IL-22
  also activates the JNK, ERK and MAPK pathways as well as STAT1 and -5. IL-22 and
  -26 also activate the acute phase/pro-inflammatory responses in cells rather than
  de-activation of the inflammatory response.
