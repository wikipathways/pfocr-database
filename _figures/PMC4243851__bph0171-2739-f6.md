caption: The proposed mechanism by which the AMPK signalling pathway regulates BP
  in the NTS of rats with fructose-induced hypertension. Treatment with an AMPK activator
  (resveratrol) demonstrated that AMPK acts as an important regulator of BP through
  NADPH oxidase activity. AMPK decreased BP, decreased the generation of ROS, and
  enhanced the activity of the Akt-nNOS pathway by down-regulating NADPH oxidase levels
  and up-regulating SOD2 levels in the NTS of rats with oxidative stress-induced hypertension.
