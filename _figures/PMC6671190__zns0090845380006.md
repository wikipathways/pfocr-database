caption: Highly simplified schematic of the cerebellum and associated brain circuitry
  essential for eyeblink conditioning. Note inhibitory connections from the IN to
  the IO. In extinction, IN inhibition would promote IO activity decreases below baseline
  levels considering that the omission of the US would cease to excite climbing fibers.
  The strong IN inhibitory output that results during performance of the conditioned
  response without a US would then cause IO activity to decrease, signaling changes
  that would ultimately allow extinction to occur. Dashed line indicates inhibitory
  rubro-olivary pathway activated during RN stimulation. This pathway is hypothesized
  to have provided an efficient substitution for a signal of extinction normally conveyed
  by the interpositus.
