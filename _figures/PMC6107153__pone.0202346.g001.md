caption: 'The data set containing gene identifiers and corresponding fold changes
  and p-values generated from one-way ANOVA analysis in Partek Genomic Suite Software
  was uploaded into the web-delivered IPA application. Each gene identifier was mapped
  to its corresponding gene object in the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base. The data
  set was mined with the IPA library to extract information of the canonical VDR/RXR
  activation pathway, and networks were generated by using IPA graphical representations
  of the molecular relationships between genes and gene products. Red color represent
  genes that are upregulated; grey: genes from the dataset that did not pass the analysis
  cutoffs; white: genes from the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base that are not part
  of the dataset.'
