caption: Schematic representation of the pathway leading to IL-1β release from NK92
  and its inhibition by DMF or MMF. After binding TLR (and perhaps others), LPS activates
  caspase-1 which induces the synthesis of IL-1β. Also, LPS upregulates the mRNA for
  IL-1β, and stimulates GSDMD which induces pyroptosis in the cell membranes allowing
  the exocytosis of IL-1β. The activities of GSDMD are inhibited by the drug DMF and
  by MMF plausibly through hypermethylation of GSDMD gene, resulting in impairing
  the exocytosis of this cytokine, and preventing the pyroptosis of NK92 cells.
