caption: This figure shows the modules that could be used to describe interactions
  between the growth factor and β-adrenergic receptor pathways. The growth factor
  signaling pathway is divided into two modules (the red box and the green box). Such
  modularity divides this pathway by their location within different subcellular regions.
  All members of the red box are functional at the plasma membrane while the members
  of the green box are cytoplasmic. At a functional level, the reactions in the red
  box specify how EGF binding to its receptor regulates activation of Ras while the
  reactions in the green box specify how the activated Ras regulates MAPK phosphorylation.
  The gray box provides a counter point to the organizational logic of the red and
  green boxes. Here the module spans reactions from the membrane to the cytoplasm,
  from the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproternol to the small G protein Rap1
  in the cytoplasm. This modular arrangement provides a facile way of understanding
  how β-adrenergic receptor stimulation could inhibit or augment EGF activation of
  MAP-kinase. Comparison of Figures 1A and 1B are crucial for understanding the necessity
  of specifying the isoforms of the components within the modules to understand regulatory
  behavior. When the major isoform is C-Raf, the interactions between the EGF receptor
  pathway and β-adrenergic receptor pathway are antagonistic since Rap1 sequesters
  but does not activate C-Raf (Figure 1A). In contrast, B-Raf is activated both by
  Ras and Rap1. Here, the two pathways are additive or synergistic in activating MAP-kinase
  (Figure 1B).
