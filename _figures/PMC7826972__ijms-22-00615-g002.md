caption: Role of Myo1c in enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) adhesion on intestinal epithelial
  cells surface and in evasion from phagocytosis. Microvilli and phagocytic extensions
  rely on the actin cytoskeleton, in particular on myosin Ic that interacts with actin
  (A). When EPEC infects intestinal epithelial cells, the bacterial Tir receptor is
  injected by EPEC’s Salmonella typhimurium Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) and then
  presented at the cell host surface to interact with the EPEC envelop protein intimin.
  T3SS is a molecular device that allows the injection of bacterial proteins inside
  the host cell cytoplasm (zoom) (B). This interaction triggers actin polymerization
  under the bacterial adhesion site through activation of the Nck/N-WASP/Arp2/3 pathway,
  thus leading to the formation of a platform called “pedestal” (C1). The effector
  EspB also injected inside the host cell by the T3SS (B), competes with actin for
  myosin-binding (C). In epithelial cells, this interaction destabilizes microvilli,
  thus contributing to attaching-effacing lesions (C1); in macrophages, this interaction
  inhibits phagocytic structure extension, thus leading to inhibition of phagocytosis
  (C2).
