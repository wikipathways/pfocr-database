caption: (A) T lymphocytes are normally in the resting, or G0, phase of the cell cycle.
  Signals from the TCR promote the transition from G0 to G1, which renders the cells
  competent to progress further through the cell cycle by stimulating the expression
  of the genes encoding IL-2 and the subunits of IL-2R. Subsequently, the IL-2窶的L-2R
  interaction is responsible for blastic transformation and G1 progression, which
  moves the cell through the G1 phase of the cell cycle to the point that the cells
  no longer require signals from the IL-2窶的L-2R interaction (i.e., past the R-point
  [R]) to enter S phase and subsequently undergo mitosis. (B) HSCs, like resting mature
  T lymphocytes, are also normally in G0. Unlike the T lymphocyte lineage, little
  is known regarding the cytokines and receptors responsible for stimulating the HSCs
  to leave G0 and enter the cell cycle. Even so, once this G0-G1 transition occurs
  and an HSC has given rise to a committed progenitor cell, such as a committed granulocyte
  precursor, the cytokines responsible for G1 progression are known, and this is exemplified
  in the figure by G-CSF acting on a committed granulocyte precursor to promote the
  progression from the G1 to the S, G2, and M phases.
