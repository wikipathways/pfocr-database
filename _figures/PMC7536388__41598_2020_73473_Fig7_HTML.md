caption: 'Schematic representation of interrelations between profibrotic Smad2/3-dependent
  and anti-fibrotic Smad1/5/(8)9-dependent pathways in HBFs. TGF-β1-activated profibrotic
  Smad2/3 pathway is enhanced in HBFs derived from asthmatic patients (↑AS; red) than
  in its non-asthmatic (NA) counterparts (both at the level of phosphorylation of
  Smad2/3 proteins and their intranuclear translocation). However, in response to
  TGF-β1 exposition, HBFs NA shows the increased activation of anti-fibrotic Smad1/5/(8)9
  pathway (↑NA; green) (both at the level of phosphorylation of Smad1/5/(8)9 proteins
  and their intranuclear translocation). Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), is able to increasing
  the activation of Smad1/5/(8)9-dependent pathway (↑AS; green) and concomitant attenuation
  of pro-fibrotic potential in HBFs AS. Dysregulation of balance between profibrotic
  Smad2/3 and anti-fibrotic Smad1/5/(8)9 pathway may leads to the enhanced fibrogenic
  potential of asthmatic HBFs (↑AS; red). ↑—activation of pro-fibrotic pathway (red);
  ↑—activation of anti-fibrotic pathway (green); Abbreviations: TGF-β1 transforming
  growth factor-β1; BMP7 bone morphogenic protein 7; ISL isoliquiritigenin; SBE Smad
  binding elements; HBFs human bronchial fibroblasts; AS asthmatic; NA non-asthmatic;
