  Continuous lines indicate direct functional relationships, dashed lines indicate
  indirect relationships (i.e., do not require physical contact between the two molecules,
  as defined by IPA). Network nodes are labeled with the gene name and the functional
  classification of genes is denoted by their different shapes. The human genes CYP2B6,
  CYP2C19, CYP3A5, GSTA5 and GSTM5 correspond to the rat genes Cyp2b2, Cyp2b6, Cyp3a23/3a1,
  Gsta2, and Gstm1, respectively'
