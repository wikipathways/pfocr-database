caption: Final predicted metabolic pathway for the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism
  pathway (KO00630). The metabolic pathway was reconstructed for the glyoxylate and
  dicarboxylate metabolism pathway (KO00630) based on the probabilistic network modeling
  method with inclusion of the associated chemical compounds. The yellow nodes denote
  the chemical compounds extracted from the KEGG knowledgebase
