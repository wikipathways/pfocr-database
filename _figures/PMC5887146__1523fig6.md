caption: Possible mechanisms of Torso-like function from the prothoracic gland. (A)
  Tsl is secreted from the PG into circulation where it acts in conjunction with InR
  in all tissues to modulate insulin signaling. (B and C) Tsl influences the activity
  of the dILPs in the IPCs, which in turn regulate systemic insulin signaling. In
  this model, Tsl could act on either (B) the fat body (FB), which is responsible
  for producing and releasing important regulators of dILP secretion (R, brown oval)
  such as CCHamide-2, Unpaired-2, Growth-blocking peptides 1 and 2 and Stunted, or
  (C) the IPCs to directly control dILP activity.
