caption: 'Caspase-6 cascades-mediated neuron-microglia interaction in the spinal cord
  initiates chronic pain through neuroinflammation and central nociception sensitization.
  Chronic pain is categorized as inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, cancer pain,
  musculoskeletal pain, and drug treatment-induced pain, which is driven by neuroinflammation
  in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Painful insults, which includes peripheral tissue
  inflammation, nerve trauma, fracture with orthopedic surgery, chemotherapy and opioids
  treatment, result in the hyperexcitability of primary sensory neurons and trigger
  the release of caspase-6 from the central terminals of primary nociceptive afferents,
  which causing microgliosis and microglia activation, and subsequent microglial TNF-α
  secretion. Then, the interaction between TNF-α and TNFR at presynaptic sites causes
  the release of glutamate via ERK and TRPV1 pathway. Activation of TNFR at postsynaptic
  neurons also facilitates the phosphorylation of ERK, which drives central sensitization
  via positive modulations of NMDAR and AMPAR and subsequent intracellular calcium
  influx. Simultaneously, caspase-6 cleavage promotes chemokine CCL21 release from
  presynaptic neurons, which elicits microglia activation via acting on its specific
  receptor CXCR3. Microglia activation further increases the secretion of the pro-inflammatory
  mediators (IL-1β, IL-18, and PGE2). These regulations of excitatory synaptic transmission
  by microglial mediators at pre-synaptic, post-synaptic, and extra-synaptic sites
  drive central sensitization in the nociception circuits, leading to the development
  of chronic pain. Abbreviations: AMPAR, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid receptor; CCL21, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21; CXCR3, chemokine (C-X-C motif)
  receptor 3; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; IL-18,
  interleukin-18; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; p-ERK, ERK phosphorylation;
