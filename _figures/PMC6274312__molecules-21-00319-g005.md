caption: Interactomic analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of significant
  molecules. The interactome shows the close functional association between the molecules
  evaluated in this work as well as the paths in which other functionally relevant
  molecules are also involved. In details, we report in yellow the genes modulated
  only in MCF7 cells like three up-regulated genes (IL-1, IL-6 and iNOS) and the activated
  H2AX, in cyan PI3K that is activated only in MDA-MB231 cells, in green the genes
  (CYP1A1, NFKB1 and RELA) that are up-regulated in both cell lines, and in pink the
  other two HUB genes, TP53 and ESR1.
