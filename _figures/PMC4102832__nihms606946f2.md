caption: Salinomycin exerts its inhibition on Wnt signaling pathway through its suppression
  on the phosphorylation of LRP6 and the expression of β-catenin and p-GSK-3β. It
  also induces the production of ROS and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which
  consequently results in the activation of caspase-3, the induction of PARP-1 cleavage,
  and the elicitation of DNA damage. These events subsequently induce tumor cell death
  and inhibit cancer cell growth. Moreover, salinomycin is able to induce autophagic
  cell death, inhibit NF-κB pathway, and activate p38 MAPK pathway through so far
  unclear mechanisms [–, , , , , , ].
