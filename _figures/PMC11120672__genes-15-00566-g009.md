caption: Diagram of the H2O2 regulation pathway, which may be dependent on ROS generation
  of flg22 and the Ca2+ regulation pathway in SC15-infected soybeans. Purple dotted
  box refers to flg22 and the Ca2+ regulation pathway, grey dotted box refers to the
  H2O2 regulation pathway. The yellow parts indicate the presence of the corresponding
  DEGs
