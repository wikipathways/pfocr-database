caption: Chlorophyll metabolic pathway in tepals of Chinese narcissus and gene expression
  changes during tepal pigmentation process. The pathway is divided into five associated
  parts (ALA formation, Proto IX formation, heme formation, chlorophyll formation,
  and chlorophyll breakdown) based on the functions of unigenes. The additive expression
  changes of unigenes at different tepal pigmentation stages (T2, T3, T4 and T5) are
  shown by color grids based on RPKM value. Black filled arrows indicate the substance
  metabolism directions; red filled arrows indicate two dominant flux of chlorophyll
  metabolic pathway in tepals. Enzymes marked with sunlight indicate their catalytic
  activities can be influenced by light. Interaction of HCAR with other components
  in chlorophyll metabolic pathway has not been investigated, the molecular nature
  of MCS is unknown, thus are labeled with a question mark.
