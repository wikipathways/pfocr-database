caption: The IL-17RA and IL-17RC subunits are characterized by two extracellular fibronectin-like
  domains (FN), and bind to IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17AF ligands. The intracellular
  domains encode conserved SEFIR domains that interact with a corresponding SEFIR
  motif on the adaptor Act1. Both IL-17RA and IL-17RC also have essential “SEFIR-extension”
  sequences (SEFEX) that are required for functional activity. Act1 additionally contains
  a TRAF-binding site that enables association with TRAF family proteins. Engagement
  with TRAF6 drives activation of the classical NF-κB pathway, MAPK:AP1 activation
  and also activation of Syk kinase:CARMA2 that also activates NF-κB. Collectively
  these factors trigger transcriptional induction of target genes, TRAF2 and TRAF5
  can also be engaged by Act1, and promote a pathway of post-transcriptional mRNA
  stabilization or through control of multiple RNA binding proteins including HuR
  and Arid5a. A distal, non-conserved domain in IL-17RA activates the transcription
  factor C/EBPβ, and has been termed CBAD (C/EBPβ activation domain).
