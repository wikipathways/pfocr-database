caption: Systems analysis of the apoptosis execution phase. (a) Simplified overview
  of core signalling processes during the apoptosis execution phase. Associated systems-level
  features and underlying molecular causes are listed. (b) Kinetic simulations of
  substrate cleavage by effector caspases correlate well with experimental measurements
  in individual parental HeLa cells. (c) Mathematical calculations of the time required
  from MOMP until effector caspases activation in different cancer cell lines correlate
  well with experimental measurements. (d) Predictions on the consequence of XIAP
  overexpression on substrate cleavage by effector caspases were experimentally confirmed
  by measurements in HeLa cells overexpressing XIAP. Substrate cleavage is prolonged,
  submaximal and sublethal. (e) Mathematical analysis of the consequences of increasing
  XIAP amounts on effector caspase activity in HeLa cells. The simulations highlight
  that cells can undergo a sudden transition from apoptosis competent to apoptosis
  resistant once a critical XIAP concentration is exceeded. Display items in panels
  (b–e) are results from kinetic systems models of apoptosis execution and were reproduced
  or modified from previous publications,
