caption: 'A simple representation of key intermediates and modulators of the insulin
  signaling pathway is shown. Anchor genes in the pathway are marked in red and novel
  genes introduced into the network by BAKE are given in dashed boxes. Relationships
  between novel genes and anchor genes and between different anchor genes identified
  by BAKE are indicated by green broken lines. Gene associations were derived from
  the following BAKE clusters that were obtained using the 15 anchor genes together
  with the 20 closest neighbors of different anchor genes (anchor gene used given
  in parentheses, anchor genes forming clusters given in bold): KLF4-IRS2-TSC2, CHD7-GYS1
  (IRS2); ATXN2-FRAP1, RCOR1-Rab10 (P110ß), ALPL2-AKT1 (AKT2), P110ß-AKT2-Rab10 (AKT1)
  and TSC2-FRAP1-Raptor (FRAP1).'
