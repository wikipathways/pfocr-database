caption: PQQ biosynthetic pathway. The ribosomally-produced peptide PqqA, containing
  a leader sequence and the to-be-modified Glu and Tyr, is recognized and bound by
  the peptide chaperone PqqD (1). The complex associates with PqqE, along with one
  equivalent of SAM (2). The radical SAM Fe-S cluster is reduced, and this electron
  is then transferred to reductively cleave SAM (3 and 4). The newly-produced deoxyadenosyl
  radical abstracts hydrogen from the glutamate γ-carbon, leading to formation of
  a carbon–carbon bond between two residues and a radical on the tyrosine (5). Oxidation
  of the tyrosyl radical leads to the cross-linked peptide product, which is later
  hydrolyzed and oxidized to give AHQQ, the substrate for PqqC, which converts AHQQ
  to PQQ in an oxygen-dependent manner.
