caption: Network of the relationship between circRNAs and miRNAs. (A) Red dots represent
  upregulated circRNAs in PC, blue dots represent downregulated circRNAs in PC, and
  yellow dots represent downstream miRNAs that bind to circRNAs; (B) Flow chart of
  the experiment and two circRNAs involved in the VEGF signalling pathway, one of
  which was upregulated and the other was downregulated.
