caption: The reactions were grouped into blocks connected by the shared metabolites
  and included (J0) glucose transport and phosphorylation, (J1) oxidative pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), (J2a) the ‘upper’ reactions of glycolysis which consume
  hexose phosphates (HxP; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate) and
  produce the triose phosphates (TrP; dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate),
  (J2b) the ‘lower’ reactions of glycolysis which consume TrP and produce pyruvate
  (Pyr), (J3) the non-oxidative PPP which returns pentose phosphates (R5P) to the
  HxP pool (J3a) and produces TrP (J3b), (J4) lactate production and export, (J5)
  mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, (J6) mitochondrial oxidation of glycolytic NADH,
  (J7) export of mitochondrial malate (Mal) and oxidation by cytoplasmic malic enzyme,
  (J8) cytoplasmic NADPH oxidation, and (J9) consumption of ribose-5-phosphate by
  phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase for nucleotide synthesis. The measured fluxes
  are denoted in red and include J0, J4, and mitochondrial respiration (JRR). In other
  experiments, neurons were given [1,2-13C2]glucose and the [13C] distribution in
  lactate was measured (where M, M1, and M2 denote unlabeled lactate, or [13C1], [13C2]lactate,
  respectively). These data were used in a model that allowed calculation of all remaining
  fluxes.
