caption: A model for the development of epithalamic asymmetry in zebrafish.  Habenular
  neurons (hN, green) are detected earlier in the left habenula than  in the right,
  reflecting an earlier L/R asymmetry in the pool of habenular  progenitors (hP, red).
  The asymmetry in habenular neurogenesis occurs before  parapineal migration and
  is independent of the parapineal. Nodal signalling in  the left epithalamus drives
  this early asymmetry in neurogenesis (1) and  either directly (not indicated) or
  more likely indirectly via the left  habenula, biases parapineal migration to the
  left (2). As this migration is  dependent on Fgf8 (not shown), it is possible that
  Nodal biases lateralisation  by influencing the activity of the Fgf pathway. The
  early Nodal-dependent L/R  asymmetry in habenular neurogenesis influences the later
  identity of habenular  neurons (3), and is potentially responsible for subtle aspects
  of the axon  terminal morphology of habenular neurons that remain asymmetric after  parapineal
  ablation. Upon migration, the parapineal sends signals that promote  the elaboration
  of habenular asymmetry (4), perhaps by maintaining a  quantitative left bias in
  neurogenesis and/or by directly specifying the  identity of the neurons that are
  produced. Developmental stages are indicated  to the right. ep, epiphysis; pp, parapineal;
