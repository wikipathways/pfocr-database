caption: 'The interaction of the WNT pathway, Hippo pathway, and Notch pathway. Wnt
  pathway: The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated when Wnt proteins bind
  to Frizzled (FZD) receptors and the co-receptor LRP5/6 on the cell membrane. This
  binding recruits the scaffolding protein Disheveled (Dvl), which leads to the phosphorylation
  of LRP5/6 and Axin. This disrupts the β-catenin destruction complex, allowing β-catenin
  to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Once stabilized, β-catenin moves into the nucleus,
  where it forms a complex with TCF/LEF transcription factors to activate the expression
  of Wnt target genes. In the absence of Wnt proteins, β-catenin is degraded by the
  destruction complex, which includes Axin, APC, GSK3β, and CK1α, keeping its levels
  low. Hippo pathway: The upstream STRIPAK complex regulates MST1/2 and MAP4K, which,
  along with the scaffold protein SAV1, phosphorylate LATS1/2 and the scaffold protein
  MOB1. The phosphorylation of MOB1 promotes LATS1/2 activation by inducing conformational
  changes. Additionally, the WWC1-3 proteins support this process by assisting in
  the phosphorylation of both LATS1/2 and MOB1. When the Hippo pathway is activated,
  LATS1/2 phosphorylates and inhibits YAP/TAZ. However, when the Hippo pathway is
  inactivated, dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocates to the nucleus, where it binds
  to TEAD transcription factors, thereby inducing gene expression that can drive tumor
  growth. Notch pathway: When the NECD binds to a ligand on an adjacent cell, it activates
  the receptor, causing a conformational change that exposes a cleavage site. First,
  the ADAM metalloprotease cleaves the S2 site, producing a notch intermediate called
  NEXT. Then, γ-secretase cleaves the S3 and S4 sites in the transmembrane domain,
  releasing the NICD. NICD then translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex
  with CSL and MAML, regulating the expression of notch target genes. Abbreviations:
