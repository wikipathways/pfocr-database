caption: 'Hippo signaling pathway components in mammals. The Hippo signaling pathway
  has a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and organ size.
  When the pathway is active, upstream signals trigger phosphorylation (P) of MST1/MST2
  kinases. SAV1 functions as a scaffold protein, forming a complex with MST1/2 kinases.
  This interaction facilitates phosphorylation and activation of LATS1/2 kinases.
  MOB1A/B function as co-factors for LATS1/2 kinases; they form a complex with LATS1/2,
  enhancing phosphorylation and activation of YAP/TAZ proteins, which leads to YAP/TAZ
  retention in the cytoplasm or their degradation. As a result, YAP/TAZ cannot enter
  the nucleus or promote gene expression related to cell growth. However, when the
  pathway is inactive, YAP/TAZ are unphosphorylated, translocate to the nucleus, and
  activate TEAD, promoting expression of genes necessary for cellular growth and migration.
  MST1/2: mammalian ste20-like kinase; LATS1/2: large tumor suppressor kinase; SAV1:
  scaffold protein Salvador; YAP: Yes-associated protein; TAZ: transcriptional co-activator
  with PDZ-binding motif; TEAD: TEA domain family member; and P: phosphorylation.
