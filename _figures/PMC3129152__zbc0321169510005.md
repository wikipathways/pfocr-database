caption: 'Sublytic MAC activation in RPE-cells increases regulated VEGF secretion.
  VEGF, which is present in granular vesicles, is secreted via exocytosis triggered
  by Ca2+. Sublytic complement activation, results in the influx of Ca2+ and Na+ ions,
  which triggers both Ca2+-activated pathways and also depolarizes the cell membrane.
  Membrane depolarization activates voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC), allowing
  for the local influx of Ca2+ required for exocytosis. VDCC activation can be amplified
  by MAC-mediated influx of Ca2+ leading to Src activation. Ca2+ influx also activates
  the Ras/Erk pathway known to be involved in the regulated secretion of VEGF. Thus,
  sublytic MAC formation engages at least two intracellular signaling pathways that
  result in regulated VEGF secretion: Src/VDCC and Ras/Erk. The inhibitor experiments
  also revealed crosstalk between these two pathways. Finally, both Ras- and Erk-mediated
  signaling have been reported to inhibit zfp, which in turn results in increased
  VEGF expression. Thus, we hypothesize that sublytic MAC-activation engages pathways
  involved in regulated VEGF secretion rather than basal VEGF release.'
