caption: Fructose is initially metabolized to fructose 1-phosphate by fructokinase,
  which rapidly sequesters phosphate, consequently activating adenosine monophosphate
  (AMP) deaminase to cleave AMP to inosine monophosphate (IMP). Sequential enzymatic
  activation metabolizes IMP and eventually produces uric acid. Uric acid subsequently
  inhibits aconitase in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to suppress mitochondrial
  respiration. Glycolysis is preferentially activated, and several metabolites are
  fed into several side pathways, including the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and
  hexosamine pathway (HXP), which aberrantly activate energy production, synthesis
  of biosynthetic precursors, and redox homeostasis.ADP, adenosine diphosphate; AldoB,
