caption: Klotho protein-mediated network of signaling pathways. This figure shows
  the multiple biological pathways Klotho protein is involved in and its intermolecular
  interactions. Klotho induces PF4 production, which affects cognitive function after
  crossing the blood-brain barrier. In calcium and phosphorus metabolism, FGF23 binds
  to the α-Klotho-FGFR complex, activating the FGF signaling pathway to maintain balance.
  FGF19 and FGF21 bind to β-Klotho-FGFR complexes for metabolic regulation. In the
  Nrf2-GR pathway, increased Klotho leads to Nrf2 binding to antioxidant response
  element (ARE), enhancing glutathione reductase (GR) expression and activity. Klotho
  is also involved in Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β pathways. In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  it may affect β-catenin – related processes, and in the TGF-β pathway, it inhibits
  receptor binding and reduces oxidative stress. Overall, these pathways highlight
  Klotho’s significance in health maintenance and anti – aging
