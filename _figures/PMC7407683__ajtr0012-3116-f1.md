caption: FSHR is expressed in multiple organs related to metabolic diseases and FSH/FSHR
  participates in the regulation of cellular activities and metabolic processes. FSHR
  in adipose tissue regulates thermogenesis/beiging of white adipocytes through cAMP-Ucp1-mitochondria
  pathway. Also, it regulates retinoic acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, PPAR
  signaling pathway and adipocyte apoptosis by regulating Rdh10, dgat2, Acsl3, Dci,
  AdipoQ, Lpl, RarB and Fas respectively. Meanwhile, FSHR upregulates Ca2+ and CREB
  by binding with FSH. CREB can not only promotes lipogenesis through upregulating
  C/EBPα, Fas, Lpl and perilipin, but also increase fatty acids and tryglyceride level
  by activating PPARγ signaling pathway. FSHR in liver and HepG2 cells regulates LDL-R
  and reduces the endocytosis of LDL-C, which then contributes to lipid accumulation.
  The binding of FSH to FSHR in vascular endothelial cells activates Gαs, AC/cAMP/PAK,
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR, NF-kB and VCAM-1 successively, and finally causes monocyte adhesion.
  FSHR in osteoclast and their precursors enhances MEK/Erk, NF-kB, Akt and Ik-Bα phosphorylation,
  which then promotes RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast differentiation
  and activation. Besides, FSHR promotes osteoclast differentiation and activation
  through TRAP, MMP-9, CathepsinK, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. FSHR in the ovary is associated
  with oosphere stimulation and ovulation, and modulate skeletal metabolism by regulating
  estrogen. FSHR in ovarian epithelial tumors stimulates OCT4 and Gankyrin induced
  cancer cell proliferation and also enhances EMT through PI3K/Akt-Snail signaling
  pathway. Also, FSHR upregulates VEGF and angiogenesis in ovarian cancer by triggering
  ROS expression. FSHR in non-gonadal endocrine tumors is supposed to be involved
  in cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis.
