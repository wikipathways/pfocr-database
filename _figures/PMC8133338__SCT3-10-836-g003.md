caption: The role of Epo‐Epor signaling in bone development and remodeling. A, Epor
  expression in osteoblasts is required for bone loss in EPO‐stimulated erythropoiesis.
  In addition to its cardinal effect of enhancing erythropoiesis, recombinant human
  erythropoietin (EPO) has nonerythroid effects that include a reduction of bone mass
  in patients undergoing treatment for anemia. Osteoblasts synthesize bone, express
  functional Epor, and also produce Epo. Suresh et al found that EPO directly stimulates
  osteoblasts to decrease bone mass. Transgenic mice (Tg) with osteoblastic‐specific
  deletion of Epor exhibit reduced bone. EPO administration (1200 U/kg) for 10 days
  reduced trabecular bone in control mice, but not in Tg mice. B, Epor expression
  in B cells contributes to osteoclastogenesis and bone remodeling. In common with
  osteoblasts, osteoclasts, preosteoclasts, and some B and Pro‐B cells express functional
  Epor. Deshet‐Unger et al present evidence for an alternative B cell‐derived osteoclastogenic
  pathway in which EPO treatment increased the osteoclastic factor RANKL, induced
  Pro‐B cell transdifferentiation to osteoclasts, and increased the number of B cell‐derived
  preosteoclasts. Mice with conditional knockdown in the B cell lineage displayed
  higher cortical and trabecular bone loss
