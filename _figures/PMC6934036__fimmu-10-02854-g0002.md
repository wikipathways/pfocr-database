caption: WNT signaling activation in leukocytes. Canonical WNT signaling promotes
  T cell lymphopoiesis and regulates peripheral T cell activation and differentiation.
  Thus, canonical WNT activity promotes differentiation into the TH2 and TFH subsets.
  Regulatory T (Tr) cells survival is also promoted by the canonical WNT pathway.
  Nevertheless, TCF1 limits the suppressive activity exerted by Tr in the effector
  T cell population. Finally, WNT/β-catenin activation is essential for the development
  of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) natural killer (NK) cells and DC differentiation.
  Conversely, non-canonical WNT signaling induces the secretion of IL-12 by dendritic
  cells favoring TH1 responses. CLP, Common lymphoid progenitor; CMP, Common myeloid
