caption: 'Heatmaps below each metabolite display log2fold changes of relative metabolite
  abundance in four pairwise comparisons (from left to right): AO vs. without AO (NAO)
  in agitation (Ag), AO vs NAO in static (St) conditions, St vs. Ag with AO, and St
  vs. Ag without AO. G. subvermispora (GS) is shown in the top row and T. versicolor
  (TV) in the bottom row. Green and dark blue colors are indicative of a negative
  and positive log2fold change, respectively, in each pairwise comparison. Asterisks
  (*) within heatmap boxes show significant differences in pairwise comparisons, confirmed
  by a Tukey’s honest significant difference test. A metabolite is considered as present
  if detected in at least three biological replicates. Gray boxes indicate the metabolite
  is not detected. Molecules without heatmaps do not have commercially available standards.
  Continuous and discontinuous black lines correspond to validated and proposed enzymatic
  steps, respectively. Metabolomics results originate from three biological replicates
  for each cultivation condition. AO ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol antioxidants,
  NAO no antioxidants, Ag agitation, St static, GS G. subvermispora, TV T. versicolor'
