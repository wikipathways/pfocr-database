caption: Relevant reactions and proposed salvinorin A biosynthesis pathway. (A) The
  scheme of reactions catalyzed in routes a and b using GGPP as the substrate with
  formation of intermediate labda-13-en-8-yl+ diphosphate. (B) The proposed biosynthetic
  pathway of salvinorin A based on known compounds identified from S. divinorum. The
  step elucidated in this study is highlighted in the box to the lower left. The compounds
  outlined in the dashed box could exist as the corresponding descarboxylmethylated
  molecules and then be converted to their methylesters just prior to formation and
  secretion. Alternatively, the carboxylmethyltransferase could act early in the pathway.
