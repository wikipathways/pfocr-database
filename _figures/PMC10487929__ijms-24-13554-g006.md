caption: Influence of COVID-19 on SNCA expression and PD. (a) Network connectivity
  pathway map of the downstream effects of simulated SARS-CoV-2 infection on predicted
  activity of SNCA and PD. COVID-19-mediated downregulation of IFNG leads to the downregulation
  of ACE2. The downregulation of ACE2 affects the 34 intermediary molecules (14 predicted
  inhibited molecules (CCL2, CCL5, CHL1, CHRNA4, CHRNA6, DUSP1, EMP1, NR4A2, NTRK2,
  RET, SYN1, SYN2, TP53, and TUBB3) and 20 predicted activated molecules (ABL1, AGT,
  AKT1, Alp, CCK, CD74, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB5, IL6, IL1B, IRF7, ISG15, MX1, PLAC8, PLSCR1,
  PTGS2, RBP4, RSAD2, STAT1, and TNF)) associated with COVID-19 and SNCA. The downregulation
  of ACE2 leads to an overall predicted activation of SNCA and subsequent predicted
  activation of PD pathogenesis. (b) Core Analysis of the top 10 enriched canonical
  pathways involved in the network connectivity pathway map of the downstream effects
  of simulated SARS-CoV-2 infection on predicted activity of SNCA and PD Core Analysis
  revealed the top two most-significant signaling pathways involved in the modulation
  of COVID-19 on SNCA to be the NISP (p-value of 1.26 × 10−17) and the role of hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia,
  also known as “cytokine storms” (p-value of 1.99 × 10−13) as shown in the red squares
