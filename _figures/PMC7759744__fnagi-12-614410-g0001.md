caption: Mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics in inflammatory astrocytes and neurological
  disorders. Astrocytes undergo a gradual activation process in response to various
  stimuli, including injury, infection, inflammation, stroke, genetic factors, high
  glucose, fatty acid, and β-amyloid peptides, that leads to the induction of inflammatory
  phenotypes through the alteration of mitochondrial dynamics (left) and bioenergetics
  (right). The alteration of mitochondrial dynamics is represented by an increase
  in fission and a decrease in fusion events characterized by changes in related proteins
  [p-DRP Ser616, optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), MFN2, and CDK5], culminating in the increased
  number of fragmented mitochondria. Similarly, altered mitochondrial bioenergetics
  is represented by increased glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
  The change in the bioenergetic process is mediated by the regulation of mitochondrial
  proteins such as the upregulation of PDK2 and p-PDH. This phenomenon induces astrocytes
  toward their inflammatory activation through the excessive production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent activation of the NF-κB pathway. Reactive
  astrocytes release diverse pro-inflammatory mediators and induce inflammatory neuronal
  stress or toxicity associated with aging and metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.
  OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation.
