caption: 'LKB1 in complex with its two regulatory subunits STRAD and Mo25 directly
  phosphorylates and activates a family of 14 AMPK-related kinases. These kinases
  in turn directly phosphorylate a number of downstream substrates to mediate effects
  on cell polarity, metabolism, and growth control. All well-established substrates
  of AMPK and its related family members are shown, and those for which further in
  vivo data is needed are shown with a question mark. It is important to note that
  many of the known substrates are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and may not
  explain ubiquitous effects of LKB1 and its downstream kinases in all cell types.
  Bottom: The sequences flanking the best-characterized phosphorylation site in each
  substrate with those residues selected for from in vitro peptide library and alanaine
  scanning peptide mutagenesis studies highlighted. Importantly, to date there is
  no substantive mutational data from human tumors to specifically support any of
  the downstream kinases, including the two AMPK catalytic genes, as being a particularly
  critical target of LKB1 in tumor suppression. One confounding issue with the lack
  of mutations found in these downstream kinases is that there is a great deal of
  redundancy among them, suggesting that loss of any one of them may be compensated
  for by other family members, unlike the case for LKB1 for which no other specific
  kinase has been shown to compensate in vivo.'
