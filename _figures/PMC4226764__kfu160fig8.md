caption: 'A simplified diagrammatic representation of the interaction of the methionine
  cycle (blue), folate cycle (black), choline catabolism (red), and histidine catabolism
  (orange) pathways is depicted above. (1) reveals where the choline catabolism pathway
  interacts with the methionine cycle, (2) indicates the point at which the methionine
  and folate cycles interact, (3) shows the metabolic reaction inhibited by methotrexate,
  and (4) indicates how the folate cycle can directly influence the histidine catabolism
  pathway. THF: tetrahydroflate; DHF: dihydrofolate; FIGLU: formiminoglutamic acid.'
