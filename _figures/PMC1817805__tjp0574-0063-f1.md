caption: Grow stimulation elicits activation of Akt and ERK, resulting in cell proliferation
  by activating both CDKs to progress cell cycle and mTOR pathway to promote protein
  synthesis essential for cell growth and proliferation (through pathways indicated
  by dashed arrows). AMPK activation overcomes the growth-stimulatory signalling via
  activation of p53–p21 axis as well as inhibition of mTOR signalling, resulting in
  suppression of cell proliferation.
