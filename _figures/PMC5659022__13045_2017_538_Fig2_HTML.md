caption: Proposed scheme for the role of BMSCs in modulation of p53-miRNA interaction
  in association with stroma-induced drug resistance in MM. Following interaction
  between BMSCs and MM cells, p53 mRNA and protein and some p53-related TS-miRs (miR-15a/16-1)
  will be downregulated. On the other hand, the expression of some oncomiRs which
  negatively regulate p53 such as miR-125a, b will be promoted. Interestingly, exosomes
  released from BMSCs also contain miRNAs which affect p53 pathway. The outcome can
  be attenuation of p53-mediated apoptotic effects and drug resistance (CAMDR). It
  is established that integrin activation and cytokine signaling pathways will cross-talk
  with p53 pathway which ends in modulation of the pathway and also post-transcriptional
  changes in p53. However, it requires thorough investigations whether pathways activated
  following BMSC-MM cell interaction somehow impinge on transcriptional modulation
  of TP53 or miRNA genes in the nucleus through epigenetic mechanisms, miRNA biogenesis,
  or gene activation
