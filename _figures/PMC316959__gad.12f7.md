caption: Model for the regulation of sc in SMCs and neighboring epidermoblasts. In
  all proneural cluster cells, including the emerging SMC, sc transcription is activated
  by prepattern genes acting on proneural cluster-specific enhancers (). This activation
  is largely independent of the N signaling pathway. Additionally in the SMC (left),
  the sc SMC-specific enhancer, by means of E boxes that bind Sc protein (as heterodimers
  with Da), promotes sc self-activation. The self-stimulatory loop also requires the
  unidentified activating factor Xα, which should bind to α boxes (NF-κB-like binding
  sites). The resulting increased Sc accumulation promotes strong activation of Dl
  in the SMC, which signals to the neighboring proneural cluster cells (right) and
  promotes in them the transcription of E(spl)-C genes. The E(spl)-C proteins prevent
  the sc self-stimulatory loop in these cells, which become epidermoblasts, by interacting
  with the Xα factor and, possibly, by complexing with Sc and Da proteins (). (DNA
  sites capable of binding E(spl) proteins, although dispensable, may facilitate or
  stabilize their interaction with the Xα factor.) As a consequence, the Sc concentration
  remains low and the inhibitory signaling through Dl to the SMC will be weak. The
  fact that E(spl)-C proteins in SMCs are undetectable () suggests the presence of
  a mechanism that reduces E(spl)-C transcription in SMCs. As proposed for dorsoventral
  boundary formation at the wing margin (), sequestering of N molecules by the high
  concentration of active Dl in the SMC may block reception of signaling from the
  surrounding cells. In addition, low levels of N activation in the SMC may be compatible
  with lack of E(spl)-C transcription, as small amounts of Su(H) activator can be
  titrated by the constitutive levels of the Hairless antagonist ().

  description: Model for the regulation of sc in SMCs and neighboring epidermoblasts.
    In all proneural cluster cells, including the emerging SMC, sc transcription is
    activated by prepattern genes acting on proneural cluster-specific enhancers ().
    This activation is largely independent of the N signaling pathway. Additionally
    in the SMC (left), the sc SMC-specific enhancer, by means of E boxes that bind
    Sc protein (as heterodimers with Da), promotes sc self-activation. The self-stimulatory
    loop also requires the unidentified activating factor Xα, which should bind to
    α boxes (NF-κB-like binding sites). The resulting increased Sc accumulation promotes
    strong activation of Dl in the SMC, which signals to the neighboring proneural
    cluster cells (right) and promotes in them the transcription of E(spl)-C genes.
    The E(spl)-C proteins prevent the sc self-stimulatory loop in these cells, which
    become epidermoblasts, by interacting with the Xα factor and, possibly, by complexing
    with Sc and Da proteins (). (DNA sites capable of binding E(spl) proteins, although
    dispensable, may facilitate or stabilize their interaction with the Xα factor.)
    As a consequence, the Sc concentration remains low and the inhibitory signaling
    through Dl to the SMC will be weak. The fact that E(spl)-C proteins in SMCs are
    undetectable () suggests the presence of a mechanism that reduces E(spl)-C transcription
    in SMCs. As proposed for dorsoventral boundary formation at the wing margin (),
    sequestering of N molecules by the high concentration of active Dl in the SMC
    may block reception of signaling from the surrounding cells. In addition, low
    levels of N activation in the SMC may be compatible with lack of E(spl)-C transcription,
    as small amounts of Su(H) activator can be titrated by the constitutive levels
    of the Hairless antagonist ().
