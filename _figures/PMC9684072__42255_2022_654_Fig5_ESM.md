caption: The synthetic energy system contains three modules. Firstly, the PP pathway
  was transformed into a PP cycle by downregulation of PFK1/2, which enabled the repeated
  decarboxylation. The H + was carried in the form of NADPH. Secondly, one transhydrogenase
  cycle was introduced, which transformed the NADPH into NADH. At last, the NADH in
  the cytosol was transfered to the respiratory chain in mitochondrial membrane to
  generate energy.
