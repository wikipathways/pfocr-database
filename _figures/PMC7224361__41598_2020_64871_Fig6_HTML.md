caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed molecular mechanisms of fisetin-induced
  G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy in uterine leiomyomas. The schematic diagram
  delineates the extrinsic (death receptor) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways
  of fisetin-induced apoptosis. Fisetin may induce apoptosis through both pathways.
  Mitochondria act as major control points involving the regulation of apoptosis.
  Uterine leiomyomas cells were exposed to fisetin, and the phagosomes were converted
  to double-layered membranes of autophagosomes through increasing expression levels
  of Atg proteins including Beclin-1and Atg-7, while LC3-I is converted to LC3-II.
  The inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway contributes to the accumulation
  of LC3-II, which suggests that the pathway is upstream of fisetin-induced autophagy.
  Once the autophagosome develops, its maturation is complete upon fusion with a lysosome
  to form an autophagolysosome. Eventually, fisetin induces programmed cell death.
  In addition, phosphorylation of p53 stimulates its activation of p21, resulting
  in cell cycle arrest in G2/M through inhibiting cyclin B1 (CCNB1) expression and
  activity.
