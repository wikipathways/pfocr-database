caption: The role of TP53 in apoptosis and senescence. Mutations or inactivation of
  p53 plays an important role in both apoptosis and senescence resistance of LSCs.
  While LSCs with mutant P53 are unable to activate downstream P21 to enter the senescent
  process, they do not target apoptosis pathway proteins including induction of pro-apoptotic
  proteins like Bax, and apoptosis initiator groups like NOXA and repressing anti-apoptotic
  members BCL2 and MCL1, eventually fail to initiate apoptosis. MDM2, minute 2 homolog;
  BCL2, B-cell lymphoma 2; MCL1, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1; Bax, Bcl-2-associated
  X protein; NOXA, proapoptotic BH3-only protein.
