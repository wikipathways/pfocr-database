caption: A model for the Cr(VI)-induced ethylene biosynthesis and signaling. Model
  shows that Cr(VI) induces ethylene biosynthesis by enhancing the expression level
  of ACS and ACO encoding genes. Induced ethylene biosynthesis mediates induced ethylene
  perception that mediates the CTR1 modulated EIN2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylated
  EIN2 stabilizes EIN3 and regulates EIN3/EIL dependent transcription. Finally, the
  ethylene pathway activates the auxin polar transporter AUX1 mediated induced auxin
  accumulation. It inhibits the cell cycle. Taken together, the model shows that the
  pathway ends with the primary root growth inhibition.
