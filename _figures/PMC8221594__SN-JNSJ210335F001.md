caption: Schematic diagram of proposed SARS-CoV-2 entry into neurons and the role
  of mitochondria. In a healthy neuron, the initial binding of SARS-CoV-2 to receptors
  and unknown neuronal TTSP complex initiate CME. CCV containing the virus fuses with
  endosomes to expose the virus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to make new viral
  proteins for viral replication. We hypothesize that at the mitochondria, the endosomes
  fuse with mTORC1-bound lysosomes to form a hybrid endolysosome, which can also interact
  with ER or fuse with autophagosomes in the autophagy pathway. The lysosome–autophagy
  pathway is active in healthy neurons, allowing degradation of CoV vesicles and virus
  clearance. In high-risk COVID patients, neurons have dysfunctional mitochondria
  and the lysosome–autophagy signaling is impaired, leading to increased virus replication
  and ROS/iron levels. The high levels of ROS/iron production initiate the induction
  of pathways such as apoptosis or ferroptosis.
