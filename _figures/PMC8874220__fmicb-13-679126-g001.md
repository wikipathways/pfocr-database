caption: Engineered biodegradation pathway for methyl parathion. Organophosphate hydrolase
  (Opd) from Flavobacterium sp. ATCC 27551 initially hydrolyzed the methyl parathion
  (MP) into two major intermediate products, 4-nitrophenol (PNP) and dimethylphosphate
  (DMP). PNP was further converted to β-ketoadipate under the catalysis of five enzymes
  (encoded by pnpA–pnpE) from Pseudomonas putida. The solid arrows show enzyme actions
  as designed, and the dotted arrows show spontaneous reactions in bacteria.
