caption: Schematic diagram of mechanisms for poly(dA:dT)-mediated HSV-2 inhibition
  in human cervical epithelial cells. Poly(dA:dT) can be recognized by RNA polymerase
  III which then converts DNA into 5’-ppp RNA, the ligand for RIG-I. The activation
  of RIG-I facilitates the phosphorylation and translocation of IRF3 and IRF7, resulting
  in the production of IFNs. The released IFNs bind to their corresponding receptors
  on the cell surface, and trigger JAK/STAT signaling pathway, facilitating STATs
  phosphorylation and inducing the antiviral ISGs (ISG15, ISG56, OAS1, OAS2, MxA,
  MxB, viperin, GBP5) which have the ability to block or inhibit HSV-2 at different
  steps of replication cycle.
