caption: 'Schematic representation of methionine metabolism via methionine cycle and
  transsulfuration pathway showing cysteine as a precursor of GSH and hydrogen sulfide
  (H2S). Dietary Met is activated by conversion to S-adenosylmethionine (S-AdoMet
  also termed SAM) in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase
  (MAT). Then, in the transmethylation pathway S-AdoMet donates its methyl group to
  a large variety of acceptors (DNA, RNA, histones, phospholipids) through the action
  of different methyltransferases (MTs) yielding S-adenosylhomocysteine (S-AdoHcy
  also termed SAH) that is hydrolyzed to form Hcy and adenosine via a reversible reaction
  catalyzed by S-AdoHcy hydrolase. S-AdoHcy is a potent competitive inhibitor of methylation
  reactions, therefore, the fast removal of Hcy and adenosine is required to prevent
  accumulation of S-AdoHcy. Hence, Hcy is either re-methylated back to Met using the
  methyl group provided by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or irreversibly converted into
  Cys via transsulfuration pathway. Re-methylation of Hcy is catalyzed by methionine
  synthase (MS) or by betaine Hcy methyltransferase (BHMT). The first of these enzymes
  which is expressed in all mammalian tissues requires normal level of folate and
  vitamin B12 while the second one is confined to the liver and kidney and requires
  the presence of betaine, a metabolite of choline. In hepatic cells in particular,
  dietary Cys acts in methionine-sparing capacity and promotes re-methylation of Hcy
  to Met. However, when the supply of Cys is insufficient, Hcy in the liver as well
  as in the brain astrocytes is channeled into the transsulfuration pathway (Vitvitsky
  et al. ; Lu ; Kandil et al. ; McBean ). Thus, in the reaction catalyzed by B6-dependent
  enzyme cystathionine β synthase (CBS), Hcy condenses with serine to form cystathionine
  which in the reaction mediated by cystathionine γ lyase (CSE termed also CTH) releases
  free Cys that is used for GSH synthesis. Two enzymes are involved in the latter
  reaction: γ-glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and glutathione synthase (GS). Abbreviations:
  BHMT betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, CBS cystathionine-β-synthase, CSE cystathionine-γ-lyase,
  GCL γ-glutamate cysteine ligase, Glu glutamate, Gly glycine, GS glutathione synthase,
  MAT methionine adenosyltransferase, MS methionine synthase, MT methyltransferase'
