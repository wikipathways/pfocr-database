caption: In the absence of Wnt ligands, the classical signaling pathway is off. At
  that time, β-catenin is phosphorylated at Ser45, Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 by a destruction
  complex consisting of axin, GSK3β, Dvl, APC, and CK1. And then phosphorylated β-catenin
  is ubiquitylated by β-TrCP and degraded by the proteasome. When Wnt ligands are
  present and activated, they bind to coreceptors consisting of FZD protein and LRP5
  or LRP6 on the cell surface, recruiting Dvl which induces dissociation of the destruction
  complex, and in turn results in intracellular accumulation of β-catenin. The accumulated
  β-catenin enters the nucleus and binds to TCF/LEF, thereby promoting target gene
  transcription. In the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway, Wnt ligands bind to frizzled receptors
  or their coreceptors (such as ROR-frizzled) which then recruit and activate Dvl
  proteins, which mediate Rho activation through Daam1. Activation of Rho in turn
  activates ROCK. Dvl also mediates Rac activation and then activates JNK. In addition,
  Daam1 can also mediate actin polymerization through the actin-binding protein Profilin.
  In the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, Wnt ligands mediate G protein activation upon binding to
  frizzled receptors, which then recruit to activate Dvl, thereby activating the acid
  diesterase PDE. PKG can block the release of Ca2+, while PDE can increase the release
  of Ca2+ by inhibiting PKG. In addition, Dvl and G proteins can also activate PLC,
  which can activate IP3. The activation of IP3 induces the release of Ca2+ from the
  cell, thereby leading to an increase in Ca2+ levels. Ca2+ flux induced by these
  two pathways can activate second messengers such as PKC, CamKII, or CaN. Among them,
  CamKII activates TAK-NLK signaling and then antagonizes classical Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling through competing TCF. Activated CaN dephosphorylates NFAT, which then
  enters the nucleus and increases the transcription of its target genes. PKC can
  also engage in the Wnt/PCP pathway by activating the small GTPase Cdc42.APC, adenomatous
  polyposis coli; β-TrCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein; CamKII, calmodulin-dependent
  kinase II; CBP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate response-element binding protein;

  description: In the absence of Wnt ligands, the classical signaling pathway is off.
    At that time, β-catenin is phosphorylated at Ser45, Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 by
    a destruction complex consisting of axin, GSK3β, Dvl, APC, and CK1. And then phosphorylated
    β-catenin is ubiquitylated by β-TrCP and degraded by the proteasome. When Wnt
    ligands are present and activated, they bind to coreceptors consisting of FZD
    protein and LRP5 or LRP6 on the cell surface, recruiting Dvl which induces dissociation
    of the destruction complex, and in turn results in intracellular accumulation
    of β-catenin. The accumulated β-catenin enters the nucleus and binds to TCF/LEF,
    thereby promoting target gene transcription. In the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway,
    Wnt ligands bind to frizzled receptors or their coreceptors (such as ROR-frizzled)
    which then recruit and activate Dvl proteins, which mediate Rho activation through
    Daam1. Activation of Rho in turn activates ROCK. Dvl also mediates Rac activation
    and then activates JNK. In addition, Daam1 can also mediate actin polymerization
    through the actin-binding protein Profilin. In the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, Wnt ligands
    mediate G protein activation upon binding to frizzled receptors, which then recruit
    to activate Dvl, thereby activating the acid diesterase PDE. PKG can block the
    release of Ca2+, while PDE can increase the release of Ca2+ by inhibiting PKG.
    In addition, Dvl and G proteins can also activate PLC, which can activate IP3.
    The activation of IP3 induces the release of Ca2+ from the cell, thereby leading
    to an increase in Ca2+ levels. Ca2+ flux induced by these two pathways can activate
    second messengers such as PKC, CamKII, or CaN. Among them, CamKII activates TAK-NLK
