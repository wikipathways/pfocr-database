caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for hFA-sphingolipids. The de novo pathway
  is postulated based on our in vitro and in vivo evidence (, ). Salvage pathways
  (not shown) leading to formation of hFA-sphingolipids have not been studied. In
  addition to C16 fatty acid, many other fatty acids (C14–C34) can be used. The N-acylation
  step is catalyzed by any of the six isoforms of ceramide synthase (). GSL, glycosphingolipid;
  SM, sphingomyelin.
