caption: A) Smad signaling in the hypodermis regulates the transcription of ins-4,
  which in turn feeds into DAF-2/IIS in the intestine to control lipid metabolsim.
  B) In wild-type animals, DAF-2/InsR is regulated by multiple agonistic and antagonistic
  ILPs. DAF-2/InsR activation leads to phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of
  SKN-1/Nrf and DAF-16/FoxO. In dbl-1 loss-of-function (LoF) mutants, reduced Smad
  activity leads to increased INS-4 expression. Also in dbl-1 mutants, SKN-1/Nrf nuclear
  localization has reduced sensitivity to DAF-2/InsR activity, while DAF-16/FoxO nuclear
  localization has increased sensitivity to DAF-2/InsR function.
