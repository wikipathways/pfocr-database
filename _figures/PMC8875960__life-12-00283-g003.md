caption: Targeting the NOTCH signaling pathway. NOTCH signaling can be targeted by
  monoclonal antibodies mAbs that are directed against the NOTCH extra cellular domain
  (NECD). Other mechanisms of NOTCH inhibition include the targeting by γ-secretase
  inhibitors that block γ-secretase, thus inhibiting the cleavage of NICD, which is
  necessary for nuclear translocation. As a consequence, γ-secretase inhibitors prevent
  the transcriptional activation of NOTCH1 target genes through the suppression of
  the MAML (Mastermind-like) and CSL (CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, Lag-1) transcription
  factors.
