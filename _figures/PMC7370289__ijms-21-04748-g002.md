caption: Pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. Disruption of the epithelial
  layer causes increased permeability of luminal antigens through the epithelial layer.
  These antigen presenting cells (macrophages—Mϕ and dendritic cells—DC) are activated
  by recognition of antigens via toll-like receptors (TLR). Activation of the antigen
  presenting cells results in activation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway, which stimulates the production of inflammatory
  cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, IL-23, IL-1β, and TNFα) via increased transcription.
  Antigen presenting cells then process the antigen and present it to T cells, in
  turn promoting their differentiation and leading to production cytokines (IFNγ and
  IL-17) that are responsible for moderating cell-mediated immunity. Natural killer
  cells (NK cells) participate in surveillance to infectious pathogens and are the
  main source of IL-13, which is responsible for disruption of the epithelial barrier.
