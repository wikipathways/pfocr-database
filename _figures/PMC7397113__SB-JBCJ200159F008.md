caption: Proposed pathways for the utilization of galactan, galactose, cellobiose,
  and β-galactosides in G. stearothermophilus T-1. The extracellular β-1,4-galactanase
  Gan53A cleaves galactan and generates short galacto-oligosaccharides that enter
  the cell via a specific ABC transport system (GanEFG) and are further degraded by
  the intracellular β-galactosidase Gan42B into galactose (). Galactose is metabolized
  via the Leloir pathway involving the galKETR operon encoding for galactokinase (galK),
  UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (galE), galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (galT),
  and a transcriptional regulator (galR). Extracellular galactose binds the high-affinity
  sugar-binding protein GalP, which presents the sugar to the sensor histidine kinase
  (GalS). GalS phosphorylates the response regulator (GalT2), which in turn binds
  to the galE2 promoter and activates the expression of the ABC transport system for
  galactose (GalE2F2G2). In addition, galactose can be imported by a specific PTS
  for galactose (PtsABC). Inside the cell, the phosphorylated galactose (galactose
  6-phosphate) is further metabolized via the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway to dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or, alternatively, hydrolyzed by a phosphatase
  to galactose and Pi. Strain T-1 encodes for homologous tagatose pathway genes, including
  galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (galA), tagatose-6P kinase (galB), and tagatose
  1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (galC). Cellobiose is imported to the cell by a dedicated
  PTS (celBCD) and is further hydrolyzed inside the cell by 6-phospho-β-glucosidase
  (Cel1A) to glucose 6-phosphate and glucose. Other galacto-moiety disaccharides,
  including lactose and galactosyl-glycerol, can be also imported by the PTS for cellobiose.
  Lactose and galactosyl-glycerol are further hydrolyzed by Gan1D to galactose 6-phosphate
  and glucose or glycerol, respectively. The letter P on the genetic map indicates
  proposed promoter sites, and Ω indicates the position of hypothetical ρ-independent
  transcription termination sites.
