caption: 'Glucoraphanine in cruciferous vegetables is hydrolyzed to sulforaphane by
  myrosinase or by gut microbiome. Sulforaphane inhibits the KEAP-1 mediated degradation
  of Nrf2, allowing Nrf2 to migrate from the cell cytoplasm into the nucleus where
  it binds to the antioxidant responsive element in the promoter regions of Nrf2 target
  genes, including GSTM1, thereby increasing their transcription, and hence their
  activities. The result is a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive
  aldehydes (RAs), and factors involved in inflammation and kidney injury. In a disease
  state such as hypertensive kidney disease, those homozygous for the GSTM1 active
  allele (GSTM1+) have decreased risk of kidney disease progression through the activation
  of GSTM1 enzyme. While those carrying the GSTM1 null allele (GSTM1(0)) may be at
  higher risk of disease progression, they could be protected due to increased bioavailability
  of sulforaphane to enhance Nrf2-mediated transcription of other antioxidant genes.Figure
