caption: Mechanism of Notch signaling pathway. In the Golgi, the first cleavage (S1)
  occurs under the action of the furin-like converting enzyme. In the second lysis
  (S2), the extracellular region (NECD) is phagocytosed by the surface cells and then
  the intracellular region (NICD) is lysed for a third time under the action of γ-secretase
  and mutant presenilin (S3), after which it enters the nucleus, and initiates the
  transcription of downstream target genes. ML metal loprotease, TACE TNF-α-convertingenzyme,
