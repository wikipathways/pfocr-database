caption: Metabolic pathways for biosynthesis of P(3HB) in recombinant R. eutropha
  strain from glucose and xylose as carbon sources used in this study. The overall
  metabolic pathway is shown together with the introduced metabolic pathways for the
  production of P(3HB). Xylulose 5-phosphate is generated by E. coli xylose isomerase
  (xylA) and xylulokinase (xylB). 3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA is generated by R. eutropha
  β-ketothiolase (phaA) and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (phaB). In R. eutropha strain,
  all the genes involved in PHA biosynthesis are in the chromosomal DNA except the
  xylAB gene encoding E. coli xylose isomerase and xylulokinase, which is additionally
  expressed by the introduction of pKM212-XylAB
