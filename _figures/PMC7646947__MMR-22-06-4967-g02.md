caption: Receptors and substances involved in metabolism that affect muscle protein
  synthesis and degradation in cancer cachexia. In cancer cachexia, the overexpression
  of the VDR impairs muscle regeneration and causes protein degradation. Increased
  PDK4 expression directly promotes cancer cachexia-related changes in muscle metabolism
  and skeletal muscle atrophy. Furthermore, Ang II activates the UPS to induce protein
  degradation and inhibits the IGF-1 signaling pathway, thereby interfering with protein
  synthesis. VDR, vitamin D receptor; Ang II, angiotensin II; R, receptor; UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome
  system; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; PDK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
  4.
