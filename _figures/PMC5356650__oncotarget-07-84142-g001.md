caption: (A) Drug treatment profiles were generated from MCF7 cell lines that were
  treated with three different PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibitors (LY294002, wortmannin,
  sirolimus). Drug treatment profiles were used to calculate a DRS for patient tumors
  in several breast cancer datasets and for GDSC cell lines. DRS was validated in
  the TCGA dataset using RPPA data. After validation of DRS as estimator of PI3K-Akt-mTOR
  pathway activity, DRS was used to predict patient prognosis in breast cancer datasets.
  DRS was also calculated for GDSC cell lines and correlated with drug IC50 of 139
  compounds.
