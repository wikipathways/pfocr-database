caption: NADPH and hydrogen peroxide at the crossroad of chloroplast antioxidant and
  thiol-dependent redox regulatory systems. FDX, the final acceptor of the photosynthetic
  electron transport chain, fuels reducing equivalents to plastid thioredoxins (TRXs)
  with the participation of FTR. NADPH, which can be produced from sugars by the oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP), is also generated from FDX by the action of FDX–NADP
  reductase (FNR). Photosynthesis inevitably produces ROS including superoxide anion
  (), which is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by Cu/Zn- and Fe-dependent SODs.
  ASC provides reducing equivalents to scavenge H2O2 via ASC peroxidase (APX), producing
  oxidized intermediates MDA and DHA. Regeneration of ASC via MDAR and DHAR uses reduced
  GSH hence yielding oxidized GSH (GSSG), which is reduced back to GSH by an NADPH-dependent
  GR. Plastids harbor an additional group of hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzymes,
  TPXs, which include PRXs and GPXs (see ). The scheme only represents the most abundant
  plastid TPX, 2-Cys PRX (2CP), which is predominantly reduced by NADPH-dependent
  NTRC, and, with lower efficiency (denoted by a thinner arrow), by TRXs.
