caption: Two signaling pathways [-]. MAL is the bridge connecting TLR1/2/4/6 and MyD88.
  When MyD88 bound to the receptor, the TIR domain of TLRs can then interact with
  MyD88. At the same time TIR domains can lead to the phosporylation of the IRAK-1
  and -4. Both IRAKs lead to the activation and polyubiquitination of the oligomer
  itself through interaction with TRAF6. The connection between IRAKS and TRAF6 results
  in the activation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK), which frees NF-κB from
  IκB. NF-κB will translocate to the nucleus, and activate some proinflammatory genes.
  TRAM is necessary for TLR4 but not for TLR3 in TRIF signaling pathway. TRAF3 activated
  by TRIF will make IRF3 phosphorylated. Phosphorylated IRF3 will translocate into
  the nuclear to induce type I IFNs and activate IL-10 gene. TRIF can also influence
  NF-κB through RIP1 and TRAF6. Except for interacting with TRAF6, TLR7, 8 and 9 can
  also take part in anti-inflammation effects by interacting with TRAF3.
