caption: 'Breast cancer cells originate from either lobules or ducts. FABP4 (red staining)
  is mainly expressed in tumor stroma, particularly in tumor-associated macrophages
  (green), inducing protumor interleukin (IL)-6 production via the nuclear factor
  kappa B (NF-κB)/miR-29b pathway in macrophages. Circulating FABP4 released by adipocytes
  (yellow) during obesity enhances IL-6/STAT3/ALDH1 activity in breast/mammary tumor
  cells (gray), leading to an enhanced stem cell-like phenotype and tumor progression.
  Abbreviations: ALDH1, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1; PIPs, phosphatidylinositol phosphates;
  STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.'
