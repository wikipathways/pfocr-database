caption: UFPM, Cardiovascular disease-drug target-pathway network. The red node at
  the center of the figure corresponds to the Shengmai formula and the surrounding
  green diamond-shaped nodes are the three Chinese herbal medicines (Ginseng radix
  et Rhizoma Rubra, Ophiopogonis Radix, and Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus). The round
  nodes represent the key network targets in the “disease gene-drug target interaction
  network,” where the red circles (the marked target genes) are candidates for the
  Shengmai formula, and the others are disease-related genes. The edges represent
  interactions among cardiovascular disease genes, herbs, and putative targets for
  the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The different color ovals represent the
  main pathways from the enrichment analysis of major targets in the “disease gene-drug
  target interaction network” and the previously described toxicity pathways of UFPM.
