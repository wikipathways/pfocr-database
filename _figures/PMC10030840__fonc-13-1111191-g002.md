caption: Pedigrees of index ovarian cancer cases harbouring candidate variants in
  DNA repair genes identified in phase I of the study. Selected top candidate variants
  were identified in 5 of 13 families having at least two or more OC cases. Anonymized
  pedigrees indicate carrier status of tested index case (arrow) and available family
  members denoted by plus (carrier) or minus (not a carrier) signs. All Index cases
  (arrow) were subjected to whole exome sequencing analyses (WES). All carriers were
  found in a heterozygous state. Age in years is shown at cancer diagnosis and death
  where applicable. Superscript C denotes histological subtypes that were confirmed
  by pathology reports or death certificates.
