caption: The role of the SIRT1–c-Myc axis in the control of stem cells. Both SIRT1
  and c-Myc have significant expression levels in several types of stem cells. SIRT1
  removes acetyl groups from c-Myc, leading to enhanced stability. When c-Myc is more
  stable, it increases the transcription of c-Myc target genes like Usp22, Mat2a,
  Tert, and Smpdl3b. The upregulation of MAT2A leads to the synthesis of SAM, resulting
  in an elevation of H3K4me3 levels on pluripotent genes and subsequently promoting
  their expression. This activity is crucial for the preservation of pluripotent stem
  cells. C-Myc also stimulates the production of SMPDL3B to modify sphingolipids on
  the plasma membrane, affecting the flexibility of the membrane and the signaling
  pathways which are involved in the process of neuronal development. C-Myc stimulates
  the process of transcribing Tert, which, in turn, enhances the elongation of telomeres.
  C-Myc enhances the excessive production of USP22, an enzyme which removes ubiquitin
  from proteins, leading to the stabilization of SIRT1. This modulation augments the
  suppression of p53 by SIRT1 while simultaneously increasing mitochondrial biogenesis
  through PGC-1α, which, in turn, promotes the survival and proliferation of stem
  cells. This figure was partly created with BioRender.com
