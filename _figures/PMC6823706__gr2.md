caption: Molecular mechanism of Fetuin-A involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic
  associated fatty liver disorders via suppression of insulin signaling resulting
  in insulin resistance. FetA, a glycoprotein produced by the liver, could provide
  the elusive link between FFAs and the TLR4 pathway. FFAs binds to FetA, which then
  binds TLR4. TLR4 signaling leads to the activation of the transcription factors,
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and AP-1, which can then upregulate the transcription
  of inflammatory genes, resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines that
  can lead to insulin resistance. NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  factor 88; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR4, toll-like receptor; AP-1, activator protein
  1; IKK, IκB kinase; TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β; MD2, myeloid
  differentiation protein-2; IκB, inhibitor of Κb; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinases.
