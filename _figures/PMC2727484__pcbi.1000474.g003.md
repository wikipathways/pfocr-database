caption: 'Each node represents one reaction set – the substrates and products of a
  single human metabolic reaction. Edges connect the reactions in the canonical pathway
  as annotated in HumanCyc . As given in the color key, each reaction is colored according
  to the expectation value indicating the strength of similarity between that target
  reaction set and the respective MDDR drug set. Diamond shaped nodes indicate reactions
  catalyzed by enzymes annotated as known drug targets in the MDDR; circles indicate
  reactions catalyzed by enzymes not annotated as targets. Reaction key: 1. Deoxyuridine
  kinase 2. Thymidine kinase 3. Thymidylate kinase 4. Deoxythymidine diphosphate kinase
  5. Thymidylate synthase (TS) 6. Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase 7. Dihydrofolate
  reductase (DHFR) 8. Deoxyuridine diphosphate kinase 9. Deoxyuridine triphosphate
  diphosphatase.'
