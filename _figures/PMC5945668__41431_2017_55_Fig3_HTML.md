caption: 'Contraction of smooth muscle cell: cellular pathway and the role of MYL9
  and of other genes related to MMIHS. a Diagram illustrating some steps in the cellular
  pathway related to smooth muscle contraction. The phosphorylation of regulatory
  myosin light chain (rMLC) encoded by MYL9 is crucial to promote contraction and
  occurs at the end of this pathway (thick arrow). The increase in intracellular calcium
  concentration [Ca2+]i is an essential step to initiate the process, which is triggered
  by several factors (autonomic nervous system, hormones, local chemical, or mechanical
  stimulus). The [Ca2+]i increases due to two mechanisms: the influx of calcium ions
  (Ca2+) from extracellular to cytosol mediated by different channels (Ca2+ voltage-dependent
  and nonselective cation channels) and by the release of this ion from sarcoplasmatic
  reticulum (SR) through a G-protein- (G) mediated cascade. The binding of agonists
  to the G-protein-coupled receptor increases the phospholipase C (PLC) activity via
  G-protein leading to the production of inositol 1,4,5-triphophate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG) from membrane phospholipids—phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2). Protein
  G also activates the Rho pathway. IP3 binds to a specific receptor (IP3R) on SR
  causing the release of Ca2+ to the cytosol. The activation of the ryanodine receptor
  (RyR) on SR also contributes to the release of Ca2+ to the cytosol and both, IPR3
  and RyR, are activated by increased [Ca2+]i (not shown). The intracellular Ca2+
  (four molecules) binds to calmodulin (CaM) and this complex activates the myosin
  light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK phosphorylates the rMLC of myosin class
  II (also composed by myosin heavy chain—MHC and essential myosin light chain—eMLC),
  allowing actin–myosin binding and generating the force necessary to contract the
  cell. Dephosphorylation of rMLC occurs by the action of the myosin light chain phosphatase
  (MLCP), inducing the relaxation. MLCP is inactivated via phosphorylation mediated
  by kinases (PKC, RhoK, and ZIPK—activated by DAG and Rho G pathway) and activated
  by the cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathway. The increase in [Ca2+]i also stimulates
  the contraction by the pathway related to caldesmon, an actin-binding protein (not
  shown). b The presumed effect in smooth muscle contraction due to deletion in MYL9:
  the disruption of rMLC caused by deletion impairs the phosphorylation mediated by
  MLCK, leading to reduced or absent contraction. c The genes and the respective contractile
  filaments and inheritance patterns related to MMIHS—ACTG2 filamentous actin (F-actin),
  gamma-2 isoform, MYH11 myosin heavy chain (MHC) 11, MYLK myosin light chain kinase
  (MLCK), MYL9 regulatory myosin light chain (rMLC), LMOD1 leiomodin 1, an actin-binding
  protein. *eMLC encoded by MYL6 gene, not related to MMIHS until now, AD autosomal

  smooth muscle contraction was based on different references [, –]'
