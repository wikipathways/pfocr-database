caption: Binding of LXA4 to FPR2 receptor results in the activation of many intracellular
  signaling pathways. Depending on the cell type, LXA4 have different effects on PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway. In macrophages, lipoxins have an anti-inflammatory effect through
  the activation of PI3K/AKT pathways which leads to an increase in their life span.
  By increasing cytosolic calcium levels, LXA4 is involved in the recruitment of neutrophils
  at the site of inflammation. LXA4 controls the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  by inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB and by increasing the SOCS mRNA level.
  By inhibiting the activation of transcription factors including NFkB and AP-1, LXA4
  up-regulates the levels of Nrf2 and PPARγ—factors which suppress the expression
  of pro-inflammatory genes. LXA4 Lipoxin A4, NF-κB nuclear factor-κB, SOCS cytokine
  signaling suppressors, AP-1 activator protein 1, Nrf-2 nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2, PPARγ peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
