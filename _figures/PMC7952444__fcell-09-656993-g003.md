caption: Mechanisms of PIWIL1 dysregulation in tumor. Several mechanisms that drive
  overexpression of PIWIL1 have been discovered, including activation of the RASSF1C/MEK/ERK
  pathway, hypomethylation of the PIWIL1 promoter and enhanced binding of ERα to the
  PIWIL1 promoter. Also, PIWIL1 is targeted by miR-154-5p and miR-2116-3p in tumor
  cells. Moreover, lncRNA FALEC indirectly induces PIWIL1 expression by sponging miR-2116-3p.
  Inhibition of B-RAF with PLX4720 (a selective B-RAF inhibitor) and treatment with
  Betulinic acid (a plant secondary metabolite isolated from birch trees), causes
  downregulation of PIWIL1 in cancer cells.
