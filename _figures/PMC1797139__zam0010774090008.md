  baylyi (the pobS gene located between pobR and the qui genes were not included in
  the scheme). The thick horizontal arrows represent promoters; thus, the double arrows
  stand for two divergent promoters. The vertical lines demonstrate regulatory mechanisms
  affecting positively (bottom) or negatively (top) the respective promoter. POB,
  p-hydroxybenzoate; PCA, protocatechuate.
