caption: A proposed model for I-SMAD-regulated signaling that enhances HSPG expression,
  cholesterol uptake and HCV entry. HCV entry is mediated by viral binding to HSPGs,
  LDLR and SR-BI (and other entry factors, not shown) on the host cell surface, thereby
  triggering a cassette of signaling to facilitate the internalization of HCV virions.
  HCV infection also induces the expression of SMAD6 and SMAD7, two I-SMADs of the
  TGF-β signaling pathway via NF-κB regulation. The I-SMADs translocate to the nucleus
  and transcriptionally activate the expression HSPG core protein and other cholesterol
  uptake receptors. Increased expression level of heparin sulfate on the cell surface
  in turn enhances HCV binding. Additionally, the I-SMADs and HSPGs can be induced
  by BMP6 and BMP7, the ligands in the BMP/TGF-β pathway.
