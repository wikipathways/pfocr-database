caption: 'Regulation of SCAP/SREBP activation in Cancer Cells.In cancer cells, oncogenic
  EGFR signaling increases glucose uptake and enhances the synthesis of UDPGlcNAc,
  the end-product of the hexosamine synthesis pathway, promoting the N-glycosylation
  of SCAP, which enables SCAP dissociation from INSIG and leads to SCAP/SREBP trafficking
  from the ER to the Golgi. In the Golgi, SREBPs are sequentially cleaved by S1P and
  S2P proteases to release their NH2-terminal forms, which enter into the nucleus
  to activate the expression of key lipogenic genes, including themselves, forming
  a feedforward loop to activate lipid metabolism. Moreover, the newly synthesized
  INSIG1, cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids mediated by SREBPs enhance the binding
  of INSIG and SCAP to retain SCAP/SREBP complex in the ER, forming a negative feedback
  loop to regulate SREBP activation. In addition, the nuclear SREBP forms are degraded
  by ubiquitin E3 ligase FBXW-mediated proteasome system, a process regulated by phosphorylation,
  acetylation and sumoylation by GSK3β, SIRT1 and PIAsy, respectively. Recently, miR-29
  was found to be transcriptionally upregulated by SREBP-1, and in turn to inhibit
  SCAP and SREBP expression, mediating an additional negative feedback loop controlling
  this signaling pathway. Various inhibitors shown in blue, which inhibit SREBP translocation
  or maturation, have been tested in cancer cells and have shown promising anti-tumor
  effects. Abbreviation: ACACA, acetyl-coA carboxylase alpha; ACACB, acetyl-coA carboxylase
