caption: The role of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway in regulating FoxO3 activity
  is conserved between C. elegans/D. melanogaster/humans. Following extracellular
  binding of the insulin receptor (InR) by a substrate (e.g., insulin or insulin-like
  growth factor-1), the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) associates with InR on the
  cytoplasmic side of the cellular membrane. IRS in turn recruits PI3K which phosphorylates
  the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-2-phosphate (PIP2), creating phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate
  (PIP3). PIP3 is bound by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDPK1) which
  activates AKT via phosphorylation. Active AKT inhibits the nuclear translocation
  of FoxO3 and promotes its exclusion from the nucleus via a phosphorylation event.
  Phosphorylated FoxO3 is bound by the 14–3-3 regulator protein, leading to ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation.
