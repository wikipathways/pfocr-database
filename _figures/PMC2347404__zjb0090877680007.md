caption: Proposed rhamnolipid biosynthetic pathway. RhlA is responsible for diverting
  the β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP intermediate from the FASII cycle and directly competes
  with FabA and FabI for this intermediate. RhlA is the only protein required to convert
  two molecules of β-hydroxyacyl-ACP to HAA. Thus, the amount of HAA formed is governed
  by the competition between RhlA and FabA/FabI, and then, RhlB and RhlC produce RL1
  and RL2, respectively, by the consecutive attachment of rhamnosyl groups. PhaG is
  a transacylase that converts β-hydroxyacyl-ACP to the corresponding CoA thioester,
  which is polymerized by PhaC to form PHA.
