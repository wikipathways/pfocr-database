caption: Schematic representation of glutaminolysis genes differentially expressed
  in GBM. GBM cases presented hyperexpression of GLSiso2 and hypoexpression of other
  genes of the glutaminolysis pathway (GLSiso1, GLS2, GLUD1, GPT2), (downregulation
  of GLUD1 and GPT2 was confirmed at protein level) leading to an accumulation of
  Glu and activation of GSH synthesis and consequently inducing tumor cell proliferation
  and survival. On the other hand, AGII and AGIII IDH1mut display hyperexpression
  of GLSiso2, GLUD1, and GPT2 (upregulation of GLUD1 was confirmed at protein level)
  leading to activation of glutaminolysis pathway and fueling the TCA cell cycle.
  Additionally, in IDH1mut cases, a decrease in Glu availability sensitizes the tumor
  cells to oxidative stress leading to slow tumor growth. The downregulated expression
  is represented by blue thermometers, upregulated by red thermometers, and the non-significant
  differential expression in gray. Red arrows represent the activation of the pathway
  and blue arrows represent the inactivation of the pathway
