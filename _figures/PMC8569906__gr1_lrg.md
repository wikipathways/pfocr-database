caption: Potential mechanisms of inhaled pollutant interaction with viral life cycle.
  Controlled in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro exposure studies indicate that inhaled
  pollutants can affect host defense response to viral infections in multiple ways.
  (1) Enhance the expression of receptors and the production or activity of proteases
  needed for viral entry, (2) impair TLR activation, (3) impair intracellular pathway
  activation (NF-kB and JAK/STAT), (4) impair gene expression (type I IFN, inflammatory,
  IFN inducible, and chemokine genes), (5) impair antiviral immune signaling molecule
  production including cytokines and chemokines, and (6) impair immune cell functions
  such as phagocytosis, NET formation, and cytotoxic NK-cell activity. Each of these
  disruptions of normal host defense responses result in increased viral replication
  and dysregulation of immune responses. Because inhaled pollutants affect the viral
  life cycle, it is important to reduce harmful exposures and explore prevention and
  mitigation strategies against these environmental pollutants. This figure shows
  SARS-CoV-2 as an example, but it is generally applicable to other types of viruses,
  such as influenza. JAK/STAT, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  NET, neutrophil extracellular trap; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer;
  NK, natural killer; TLR, Toll-like receptor. The figure was created at BioRender.com.
