caption: Vagal afferent neurons are located in the bilateral NG neurons. Ghrelin activates
  the Gαi-PI3K-Erk1/2-KATP pathway in NG neurons, and evokes potassium currents, thereby
  causing hyperpolarization. By contrast, GLP-1 induces depolarization. Ghrelin and
  GLP-1 regulate feeding through their opposing effects on the cellular excitability
  of vagal afferent neurons. ARC, arcuate nucleus; NG, nodose ganglion; NTS, nucleus
  tractus solitarius
