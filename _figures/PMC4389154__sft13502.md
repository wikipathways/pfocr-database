caption: (a) Model of VEGF signalling in the glomerulus. VEGF is released by podocytes
  and acts on VEGF receptors on endothelial cells (EC), causing receptor phosphorylation
  and signal transduction that is required to maintain endothelial cell integrity
  and the glomerular filtration barrier. TMA, thrombotic microangiopathy. (b) Targeting
  the VEGF pathway at a number of levels. Anti-VEGF antibodies and VEGF-trap bind
  VEGF ligand; anti-VEGF-receptor antibodies block at the level of the receptors,
  whereas TKIs inhibit intracellular pathways activated by VEGF. TKI, tyrosine kinase
  inhibitors. Both figures are taken from [] with permission.
