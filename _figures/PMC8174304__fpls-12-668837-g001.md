caption: 'Summary of the molecular pathways controlling adventitious rooting in different
  Populus species. Positive (highlighted in blue) and negative (highlighted in red)
  regulators of adventitious rooting have been identified in different Populus species.
  The TIR1 homolog PagFBL1 interacts with IAA28 protein. This interaction might release
  the activity AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (ARF) 7 and 5 and promote adventitious rooting.
  Another AUX/IAA gene, IAA4, was shown to inhibit AR formation. Salt stress induces
  the expression of transcription factor bZIP53, which binds to the promoter region
  of IAA4 activating its expression and repressing AR formation, probably through
  the regulation of ARFs. Additional AUX/IAA might also regulate adventitious rooting
  in Populus through the ARFs as it has been described in arabidopsis where multiple
  IAAs interact with different ARFs. ARFs 8 and 17 have been identified to promote
  rooting in Populus, and their transcriptional activity is negatively regulated by
  micro-RNAs, miR167 and miR160 respectively. Another miRNA, miR476a, has been very
  recently identified to positively regulate AR formation in Populus through a mitochondria-dependent
  pathway which activates the auxin polar transport. WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX5a,
  11, 12, and WUSa) genes promote rooting during the first stages of AR formation.
  Cytokinins (CKs) and giberellins (GA) negatively regulate adventitious rooting.
  CKs repress AR formation through the CK typeB response regulator, PtRR13, whereas
  gibberellins signaling inhibits rooting probably through the disturbance of polar
  auxin transport. In Populus, jasmonate (JA) has been recently shown to promote adventitious
  rooting through the COI1-dependent signaling. Transcription factor PuHOX52 is induced
  by the addition of JA and promotes adventitious rooting. PuMYC2 is a target of PuHOX52
  and a transcriptional activator of JA signaling, which acts as a positive regulator
  of AR development in Populus. MADS-box transcription factor (PuAGL1), also promotes
  rooting downstream the COI1-signaling and possibly targets PuSHR and PuSCR which
  were previously described to be involved in the regulation of adventitious rooting
  in Populus. The different Populus species abbreviation where genes have been first
  identified are Pe: Populus euramericana, Pde: Populus deltoides, Pt: Populus trichocarpa,
  Pto: Populus tomentosa, Pu: Populus ussuriensis. A complete description of genes
  is described in .'
