caption: The different roles of mTOR signaling in stress granules assembly. A. The
  activation of mTOR-S6 kinase pathway facilitates malignant progression of malignant
  tumor, and also promotes SGs assembly. The mTOR-S6 kinase pathway can promote SG
  assembly in response to mild oxidative stress by eIF2α phosphorylation, and mTOR/4EBP1/eIF4E
  axis enhances the ability of SGs assembly. B. mTORC1 is a main activator of translation,
  and thus translation arrest through mTORC1 inhibition may has potential to induce
  SGs assembly.
