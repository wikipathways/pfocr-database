caption: Regulation of apoptosis by HMGB1 in macrophages. HMGB1 is capable of inducing
  apoptosis of mouse peritoneal macrophages and the effect of HMGB1 on macrophage
  apoptosis is in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Caspase-3 activity might contribute
  to HMGB1-mediated macrophage apoptosis. It is necessary for rapid apoptosis via
  inhibiting NF-κB pathways in monocytes, and also inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway
  may enhance HMGB1-induced apoptosis in the macrophages. Caspase-3, cysteinyl aspartate-specific
  protease-3; HMGB1, high mobility group box-1 protein; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end products; TLR4, Toll-like receptor-4.
