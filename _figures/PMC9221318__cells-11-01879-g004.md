caption: The primary cilium and its interaction with Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction
  is critical to many aspects of the developing mammal and maintenance of postnatal
  mammalian tissue. (A) Embryonic primary cilia extend approximately 1–3 μm into the
  extracellular environment and function as a highly specialized sensory organelle
  that interpret changes in the surrounding environment in nearly all mammalian cell
  types. (B–D) The Hh signaling pathway is the pathway that is most closely associated
  with and dependent upon an intact primary cilium in mammals. (B) Canonical Hh signaling
  involves the secretion of Hh ligand from a Hh-secreting cell (upper right panel),
  which is bound by Patched-1 (PTCH1), a 12-pass transmembrane receptor. Binding of
  the Hh ligand to PTCH1 initiates a conformational change that leads to translocation
  of the Hh–Ptch1 complex just outside of the ciliary axoneme while also permitting
  its 7-pass transmembrane co-receptor, Smoothened (SMO), to translocate within the
  ciliary axoneme. Permissive relocation of SMO into the primary cilium concurrently
  allows GLI activators to enter into the nucleus for transcriptional activation and/or
  further upregulation of Hh signaling. (C,D) Noncanonical Hh signaling also utilizes
  Hh ligand secreted from a Hh-secreting cell (upper right panel). Noncanonical pathways
  for Hh signaling are best-characterized by their functions independent from either
  a traditional Hh receptor (C, Type II Noncanonical), Hh functioning independently
  from one (or all) of the GLI transcription factors (C), or a Smoothened-independent,
  non-traditional route of activating GLI targets (D, Type I Noncanonical). (C) One
  example of noncanonical Hh signal transduction can occur in the presence of Hh ligand,
  where activation of the pathway is achieved via SMO, and the subsequent initiation
  of RhoA/Rac1-mediated mechanisms of proliferation, cell adhesion, and/or migration.
  (D) Another example of noncanonical Hh is brought about in the presence of Hh ligand,
  where binding to PTCH1 activates a SMO-independent, G-protein coupled receptor-like
  activation of PI3K (via Gαi), and the subsequent initiation of GLI1 transcriptional
  activation. Figure created with Biorender.com (accessed on 29 May 2022).
