caption: 'Overview of action mechanisms of selected drugs that are under development
  for malignant melanoma therapy: (from left to right) relatlimab, a monoclonal antibody,
  binds to the LAG3 receptor, which is present on the surface of specialized immune
  cells, restoring its activity and allowing them to attack cancer cells; atezolizumab,
  a monoclonal antibody, binds to the PD-L1 on both tumor cells and immune cells,
  blocking its interactions with PD1 and B7.1 receptors and restoring T-cell activity;
  T-VEC presents a dual mechanism of action—selective viral replication results in
  lysis of tumor cells and production of GM-CSF by tumor cells upon T-VEC further
  leads to proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell and IFN-γ expression; indoximod downregulates
  the IDO pathway, resulting in the immunostimulatory effect of CD4 + and CD8 + T
  cells and a decrease of Tregs; epacadostat inhibits the IDO1 enzyme, which leads
  to the restoration of CD8+ T-cell and CD4+ T-cell proliferation and a reduction
  of Tregs; entinostat works through the epigenetic mechanism of action involving
  histone acetylation and simultaneous acetylation of non-histone proteins—this dual
  mechanism causes an increase of the immune response and melanoma cell apoptosis
  (T-VEC talimogene laherparepvec, LAG-3 lymphocyte activation gene 3, PDL-1 programmed
  death ligand 1, PD1 programmed cell death protein 1, GM-CSF granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating
