caption: 'Cancer stem cells supporting activities of CD44v6. A: Structure of CD44
  including insertion of variant exon products; B: CD44v6 is engaged in assembling
  the HA matrix by inducing HAS transcription. The matrix supports CD44 activation;
  C: GEM-located CD44/CD44v6 is src associated and cooperates with adjacent integrins.
  Activated ERM proteins and Ankyrin link CD44 to the cytoskeleton and initiate RhoA
  and ROK activation, which together play an important role in CSC motility; D: CD44v6
  is engaged in uPAR and MMP transcription. It associates with MMP14, which captures
  MMP2 and MMP9, supporting ECM degradation and remodeling; E: GEM-located CD44v6
  can be cleaved by TACE and subsequently by PSN2. CD44-ICD is a powerful cotranscription
  factor, which induces beside others CD44 transcription; F: There are several pathways,
  whereby CD44v6 supports CSC survival and apoptosis resistance. It cooperates with
  c-Met, which is brought into vicinity by CD44v6-bound HGF; a complex of CD44, Annexin
  II, S100A and HAS stabilizes MDR1; stress induces merlin phosphorylation, which
  dissociates from CD44 and hampers activation of the Hippo pathway; G: One pathway
  of CD44-linked induction of EMT relies on TNFα that fosters CD44 expression and
  CD44 cooperativity with TGFβRII promoting Smad signaling. CD44 also is engaged in
  activation of Nanog and in repressing miRNA transcription that targets EMT proteins
  (not shown). The majority of these CSC supporting activities of CD44/CD44v6 rely
  on GEM-recruited CD44. CSC: Cancer stem cells; GEM: Glycolipid-enriched microdomains;
  ERM: Cytoskeletal proteins ezrin, radixin, moesin; EMT: Epithelial mesenchymal transition;
  TNFα: Tumor necrosis factor α; TGFβ: Transforming growth factor β; TACE: TNFα converting
  enzyme.'
