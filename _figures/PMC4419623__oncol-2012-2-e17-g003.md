caption: There is a strong association between human papilloma virus (HPV) infection
  and the development of cancer formation because of viral immune evasion. The primary
  mechanism of viral immune evasion for HPV is avoidance of antigen presentation.
  HPV-16, and -18, E6 and E7 interfere with the interferon pathway; therefore, the
  amount of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules is reduced on
  the cell surface. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an important role in
  the elimination of viral-infected cells. However, MHC class I is not expressed on
  the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), resulting in inactivation of
  CD8+ CTLs. Continuous viral immune evasion leads to viral persistence and cancer
  formation in the long term. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
