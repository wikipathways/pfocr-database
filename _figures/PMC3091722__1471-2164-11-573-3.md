caption: 'Modelling of the listerial metabolism during intracellular replication.
  The main anabolic and catabolic pathways of L. monocytogenes are shown. Transporters
  for cations (green), anions (pink), carbohydrates and organic acids (orange), and
  amino acids and peptides (blue) are depicted in the membrane. Numbers in red indicate
  key affected enzymes, areas shaded in light red key pathways for intracellular survival
  according to this study. Transporters are generally referred to TransportDB [] and
  the Transport Classification Database tcdb [], their known specificities were discussed
