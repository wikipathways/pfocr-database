caption: 'Simplified summary of key elements involved in insulin signal transduction
  that ultimately regulate multiple cellular processes. Upon binding to its ligand,
  insulin and IGF-1 receptors undergo autophosphorylation, which increases their tyrosine
  kinase activities. Tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the docking proteins
  insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1/2), engages regulatory subunits of the
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) that generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 tris
  phosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol 3,4, bis phosphate (PIP2). The serine
  threonine kinases phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1) and Akt1 or
  Akt2 bind to PIP3 by their PH domains. PDPK1 phosphorylates Akt on Thr 308 and mTORC2
  phosphorylates Akt1/2 on Ser 473. Once activated, Akt in turn phosphorylates multiple
  targets of which a subset is shown. Phosphorylation of these targets induces pleiotropic
  cellular responses: Bcl2 phosphorylation inhibits apoptosis, FOXO protein phosphorylation
  promotes nuclear exclusion, thereby repressing the expression of FOXO-regulated
  transcripts that mediate autophagy and apoptosis. TSC1/2 phosphorylation promotes
  mTOR activation, which increases mRNA translation, promotes protein synthesis, cell
  growth, mitochondrial fusion and also inhibits autophagy. Phosphorylation of glycogen
  synthase kinase (GSK) removes the repression of glycogen synthase, which in concert
  with increased availability of glucose promotes glycogen synthesis. Phosphorylation
  of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOSIII) or eNOS by Akt increases the generation
  of nitric oxide (NO) to promote vasodilation. Akt phosphorylation mediates the translocation
  of vesicles containing the GLUT4 glucose transporter in part by phosphorylating
  downstream targets such as AS160 (not shown), leading to increased glucose transport
  following insertion into the plasma membrane. Akt also mediates in part, translocation
  of the fatty acid translocase CD36. Insulin signaling also promotes activation of
  the mitogen activated protein kinases (ERK1/2) to increase the expression of various
  genes.'
