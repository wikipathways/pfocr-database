caption: 'A proposed model: CLI186 is an integrator of L and C signaling interactions.
  L and C signaling interactions converge via CLI186 that may, in turn, act on a number
  of downstream regulatory factors such as HAT22, SINA, RAV1, ERF5, WRKY and a Zn-finger
  protein. These regulatory proteins may regulate a number of genes involved in various
  biological processes such as N-metabolism, C-metabolism and Energy among others.
  Genes involved in the light reactions of photosynthesis (CAB4, LHCA2*1, etc.) were
  not represented within the multinetwork and so it remains unclear how CLI186 may
  target these genes for regulation. Genes in bold are those that exhibit misregulation
  in the cli186 mutant and in phyA and phyB mutants, supporting the hypothesis that
  the light signal integrated with carbon may be perceived through a phytochrome pathway.
  The genes within the dashed box indicate a relationship supported by the network
  analyses. All genes depicted within this hierarchical network are misregulated in
  the cli186 mutant, with the exception of PHYA. This molecular hierarchy depicted
  is supported by our analysis and interpretation of the microarray analyses carried
  out for cli186.'
