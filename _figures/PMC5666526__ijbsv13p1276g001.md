caption: Schematic diagram showing the EBV-related pathogenic factors that contributes
  to cancer pathogenesis via exosomal pathway. Internal vesicles or multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) are formed by the inward budding of cellular compartments. The cargo
  is packaged into intraluminal vesicle (ILVs) within MVBs. The MVBs contain a wide
  range of pathogenic factors depending on the producer cell. The MVBs either fuse
  with lysosomes to degrade MVB contents or fuse with cell membrane to release exosomes.
  The exosomes enter the recipient cell via caveolae-mediated endocytosis and the
  pathogenic contents are implicated in the EBV-associated cancer pathogenesis.
