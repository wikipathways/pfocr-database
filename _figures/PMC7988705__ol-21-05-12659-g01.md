caption: Association between FAT1 and Hippo signaling pathway. Schematic diagram of
  the FAT1 cytoplasmic tail (not drawn to scale) depicting the association between
  FAT1 and the Hippo signaling pathway. FAT1 induces the activation of the Hippo core
  kinase cassette via kinase Tao, which leads to the phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ, which
  is finally degraded by proteasome. In the absence of FAT1, YAP/TAZ is not phosphorylated
  and is transferred to the nucleus to start the transcription and upregulate target
  gene expression. FAT1, FAT atypical cadherin 1; p, phosphorylated; Sav, Salvador;
  Lats, large tumor suppressor; Mst, macrophage stimulating; YAP, Yes-associated protein.
