caption: 'Classical and non-classical views of pain transmission and pain modulation.
  Panel (a). Classical pain transmission pathway. When a noxious (painful) stimulus
  is encountered, such as stepping on a nail as shown, peripheral “pain”-responsive
  A-delta and C nerve fibers are excited. These axons relay action potentials to the
  spinal cord dorsal horn. Here, neurotransmitters are released by the sensory neuron
  and these chemicals bind to and activate postsynaptic receptors on pain transmission
  neurons (PTNs) whose cell bodies reside in the dorsal horn. Axons of the PTNs then
  ascend to the brain, carrying information about the noxious event to higher centers.
  The synapse interconnecting the peripheral sensory neuron and the dorsal horn PTN
  is shown in detail in panels (b) and (c).Panel (b): Normal pain. Under basal conditions,
  pain is not modulated by glia. Under these circumstances, glia are quiescent, and
  thus not releasing pain modulatory levels of neuroexcitatory substances. Information
  about noxious stimuli arrives from the periphery along A-delta and C fibers, causing
  the release of substance P and excitatory amino acids (EAAs) in amounts appropriate
  to the intensity and duration of the initiating noxious stimulus. Activation of
  neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors by substance P and activation of AMPA receptors by
  EAAs cause transient depolarization of the PTNs, thereby generating action potentials
  that are relayed to brain. NMDA-linked channels are silent as they are chronically
  “plugged” by magnesium ions. Panel (c) Pain facilitation: classical view. In response
  to intense and/or prolonged barrages of incoming “pain” signals, the PTNs become
  sensitized and over-respond to subsequent incoming signals The intense and/or prolonged
  barrage depolarizes the PTNs such that the magnesium ions exit the NMDA-linked channel.
  The resultant influx of calcium ion activates constitutively expressed nitric oxide
  synthase (cNOS), causing conversion of L-arginine to nitric oxide (NO). Because
  it is a gas, NO rapidly diffuses out of the PTNs. This NO acts presynaptically to
  cause exaggerated release of substance P and EAAs. Postsynaptically, NO causes the
  PTNs to become hyperexcitable. Glia have not been considered to have a role in creating
  pain facilitation in this neuronally driven model. Panel (d): Pain facilitation:
  new view. Here, glial activation is conceptualized as a driving force for creating
  and maintaining pain facilitation. The role of glia is superimposed on the NMDA-NO-driven
  neuronal changes detailed in (c), so only the aspects added by including glia in
  the model are described here. Glia are activated (shown as hypertrophied relative
  to (b), as this reflects the remarkable anatomical changes that these cells undergo
  on activation) by three sources: bacteria and viruses which bind specific activation
  receptors expressed by microglia and astrocytes; substance P, EAAs, fractalkine,
  and ATP released by A-delta and/or C fiber presynaptic terminals (shown here) or
  by brain-to-spinal cord pain enhancement pathways (not shown); and NO, prostaglandins
  (PGs) and fractalkine released from PTNs. Following activation, microglia and astrocytes
  cause PTN hyperexcitability and the exaggerated release of substance P and EAAs
  from presynaptic terminals. These changes are created by the glial release of NO,
  EAAs, reactive oxygen species (ROS), PGs, proinflammatory cytokines (for example,
  IL1, IL6 or TNF), and nerve growth factor. Modified by Journal of Internal Medicine
