caption: 'Glutaminolysis and glucose metabolism in cancer cells. The higher glycolytic
  pathway contributes not only to the production of ATP per glucose consumed, but
  also feeds other biosynthetic pathways. Deviation of glyceraldehyde-3P to glycerol-3P
  is important for lipogenesis. Glucose-6P can also shift toward the phosphate pentose
  pathway that provides ribulose-5-phosphate and NADPH to nucleotide synthesis. On
  the other hand, glutamine uptake maintains the anaplerotic process in the TCA cycle.
  Glutamine is taken up via the transporter ASCT and is converted into glutamate.
  Glutamate together with pyruvate can be metabolized by GPT producing α-ketoglutarate
  and alanine; glutamate is metabolized producing α-ketoglutarate and aspartate by
  GOT; or glutamate is metabolized by glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUTD) forming α-ketoglutarate.
  All these reactions contribute to support the TCA cycle. Citrate outside mitochondria
  contributes to the de novo formation of fatty acids and aminoacids. Cancer cell
  metabolism is also characterized by the upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase to
  facilitate the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which is then secreted to the
  tumor microenvironment via the MCT. Abbreviations: ASCT, Asc-type amino acid transporter;
  ETC, electron transport chain; GLUT1/3, glucose transporter 1 or 3; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; GOT, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase; GPT, glutamate–pyruvate transaminase;
  MCT, monocarboxylate transporter.'
