caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the specific cascade and signaling pathway
  in LPS-primed macrophages stimulated with MSU, silica, or alum salt crystals. LPS
  priming induces transcription of pro-IL-1β gene and other genes in the nucleus upon
  activation of the transcription factor NFkB and subsequent production of pro-IL-1β
  protein in the cytosol (1). Particle internalization (2), fusion to lysosome (3)
  and further phagolysosome destabilization may lead to cathepsin leakage (4) which
  precedes pannexin/connexin (Panx/Conx) hemichannel and purinergic signaling-dependent
  intracellular ATP release (5). Extracellular ATP may act through P2X7 receptor to
  amplify ATP release in a P2X7 receptor-dependent way (6). ATP, UTP, or their derived
  degradation products such as ADP, UDP, and adenosine, generated by ecto-endonucleases,
  may act through an autocrine loop on other purinergic receptor P2X, P2Y, and/or
  P1 receptors (7) leading to NLRP3 receptor activation (8). This allows inflammasome
  complex formation and maturation of pro-IL-1β to IL-1β production (9) and IL-1β
  secretion (10).
