caption: The mevalonate pathway, NHRs and immunity. The mevalonate pathway is divided
  into pre-sterol and sterol stages (red segmented line). Compound structures and
  names without immune functions are in black and enzymes of the cholesterol pathway
  are named in (red). The pre-sterol intermediates are mainly produced in peroxisomes.
  Peroxisomes transform Acetyl-CoA into farnesyl-diphosphate (light blue) which is
  also a precursor for Heme A and O, Ubiquinone, dolichol, protein prenylation and
  sterol biosynthesis. The sterol-stage occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. It starts
  when squalene or its derivatives, which are linear precursors are cyclicized by
  the enzyme LSS giving origin to sterol lipids which are molecules with 4 structural
  rings (A,B,C,D) shown here in the molecule lanosterol. For sake of simplicity only
  the Bloch pathway is shown in its totality. Substrates have similar structures for
  each pathway but the shunt pathway has a epoxy group in the side-chain (blue arrow)
  while the enzyme DHCR24 removes the Δ24 double bond of any CBI (blue arrow in lanosterol)
  to produce the intermediates of the Kandutsch-Russell pathway. The preferred substrate
  of DHCR24 is 7,24-cholestadien-3β-ol (red segmented arrow).The removal of methyl
  groups at C4 from T-MAS requires two cycles of processing by the enzymes SC4MOL,
  NSDHL and HSD17B7. Shown is only the first cycle, the second is represented by a
  circle (4aC to 3one to 3ol). The CBIs from lanosterol to 4α-methyl-zymosterol are
  also called methylsterols or C4-methylated sterols. Non-canonical CBIs are produced
  when one intermediate in the pathway is processed “out of order” like lanosterol
  (green arrow) producing 4α-derivatives of Lanosterol. The CBIs that were identified
  as NHR ligands with immune functions are named in (olive green) and NHR name is
  in (blue); for NHR names see . Many CBIs bind RORγ/γt but the immune function of
  these compounds has not been demonstrated. For a complete list of sterols that bind
  RORγ/γt and promote reporter activity in ligand-free systems see [].
