caption: Proposed pathobiological functions and regulatory mechanisms of the Ras/cAMP/PKA
  signaling pathway in C. auris. The principal regulation of Cyr1 is conducted by
  Ras1, while cAMP degradation is handled by Pde1 and Pde2, serving minor and major
  roles, respectively. The Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway influences several phenotypes, including
  stress resistance, cell growth rate, ploidy change, nutrient starvation susceptibility,
  biofilm formation, and thermotolerance. These combined effects contribute to the
  virulence of C. auris. Notably, the inhibition of Bcy1 and Pde2 significantly heightens
  susceptibility to nutrient starvation and high temperature, underscoring their crucial
  role in C. auris pathogenicity.
