caption: Common inflammatory and oxidative stress-related signaling pathways for traumatic
  brain injury and glioma. Activation of inflammation and oxidative stress are reported
  in both traumatic brain injury and glioma, and both conditions share a common network
  of signaling for downstream functions. Specifically, in the cases of oxidative stress
  or inflammation in the brain, more ROS could thus be generated. Several cancer-specific
  external stimuli like the TNF-α, could lead to a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane
  potential that activates ROS generation. Besides, the NADPH oxidase (NOXs) family
  proteins are one of the main producers of ROS in various cancers, as well as in
  traumatic brain injuries. And specific signals like TGF-β, MAPK, AKT, ERK and various
  others, could lead to conformational changes in the NOX complex and increase ROS
  generation. Another important pathway that acts on glioma and traumatic brain injury
  in a similar manner is hypoxia-inducing factor 1 (HIF-1), which could be upregulated
  due to the inhibition of degradation via PHD inactivation. HIF-1 could increase
  the expression of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), erythropoietin (EPO), VEGF, as
  well as BNIP3. Besides, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) can increase the production of
  ROS, which can also be regulated by the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway via regulating GATA-6.
  Transcriptional enhancement of HSF1 by Ras could activate the SESN1 and SESN3 genes
  to promote the production of ROS. TGFβ also increases the production of ROS through
  activating GSK3β and mTOR signaling pathways in mitochondria, as well as inhibiting
  antioxidant enzymes, like the SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).
