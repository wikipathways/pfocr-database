caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of very long chain primary alcohol in plants
  (cuticle and seed coat). FAE, FAR1, FAR4, and CER4 are the wax biosynthetic enzymes
  from Arabidopsis. ScFAR is the wax biosynthetic enzyme from jojoba. (This figure
  is available in colour at JXB online.)
papertitle: FAR5, a fatty acyl-coenzyme A reductase, is involved in primary alcohol
  biosynthesis of the leaf blade cuticular wax in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).
