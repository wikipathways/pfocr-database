caption: Schematic model of FIPV nsp5-mediated inhibition of the type I IFN signaling
  pathway during FIPV infection. RIG-I and MDA5 play nonredundant roles in cytosolic
  RNA sensing by recognizing different groups of viral RNAs. RIG-I and MDA5 activation
  induce the polymerization of MAVS, which in turn recruits and activates E3 ligases
  TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6. These E3 ligases then synthesize polyubiquitin chains
  that are sensed by NEMO through its ubiquitin-binding domains. NEMO then interacts
  with TANK and recruits TBK1 and IκB kinase complex (IKKε) to the MAVS polymer, where
  the kinases phosphorylate IRF3, leading to the induction of type I IFN. However,
  the FIPV nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage disrupted the interaction between TANK and
  NEMO, which reduced the phosphorylation of IRF3, leading to the inhibition of type
  I IFN production.
