caption: The AKT signaling pathway contributes to treatment resistance against targeted
  therapies and chemotherapies in cancers. (a) BRAF inhibition (BRAFi) upregulates
  AKT activity in melanomas with concurrent PTEN loss and activating BRAFv600E mutations.
  This result in AKT-mediated inhibition of the transcription factor Forkhead Box
  O3A (FOXO3A), and reduces the transcriptional upregulation of its pro-apoptotic
  target gene, BIM. Combined pharmacological inhibition of BRAF activity and AKT activity,
  by PI3K inhibition, increases BIM expression and potentiates apoptosis, suggesting
  that AKT activity contributes to the resistance of BRAFV600E mutation-bearing melanomas
  to BRAFi []. (b) Activating mutations in the catalytic subunit of PI3K (PI3KCA)
  also contribute to resistance against chemotherapies in colorectal cancers through
  suppression of pro-apoptotic responses, and inhibition of PI3K can potentiate the
  cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy [].
