caption: Diagram of the main pathways targeted by ART-ABPPs in P. falciparum blood-stage
  trophozoites. The hemoglobin digestion pathway provides the amino acids to support
  rapid development and growth of the malaria parasite. Glycolysis provides the primary
  carbon sources and energy supply for the malaria parasites. Rapid glycolytic flux
  maintains rate-limiting glycolytic intermediates to support nucleotide biosynthesis,
  lipid biosynthesis, shikimic acid pathway, isoprenoid biosynthesis, and glutaminolysis.
  Arrows indicate metabolic steps, with multiple arrows showing various intervening
  steps not shown; dotted arrows indicate biochemical transport. CRT, chloroquine
  resistance; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; G3PDH,
  glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; HK, hexokinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;
  MDR, multidrug resistance pump; P, phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PFK, phosphofructokinase;
  PGI, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; PK, pyruvate kinase;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; TPI, triosephosphate
  isomerase. *Proteins detected and identified by ART-ABPPs. Modified from refs.  and
