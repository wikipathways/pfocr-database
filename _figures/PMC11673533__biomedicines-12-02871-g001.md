caption: Artificial sweeteners affect hormonal pathways in breast cancer. Methanol
  and formaldehyde produced by artificial sweeteners in the body may interfere with
  the estrogen signaling pathway, leading to hormone imbalance and breast cancer cell
  proliferation. They may also further increase breast cancer risk by affecting insulin
  and IGF levels and the balance of leptin and ghrelin
