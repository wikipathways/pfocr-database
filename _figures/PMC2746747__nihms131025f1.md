caption: Illustrated are two canonical Smad pathways originating from two representative
  tetrameric receptors. After TGF-β binding, the TGFβRII receptor recruits a type1
  receptor (TGFβRI) and activates it by phosphorylation. Alk-5 then specifically phosphorylates
  receptor-regulated Smad 2 and Smad3 whereas Alk-1 phosphorylates Smad1 (Smad5 and
  Smad8, also activated by Alk-1, are not illustrated). The receptor Smads then complex
  with Co-Smad4 resulting in their transport to the nucleus where they cooperate with
  other factors to regulate transcription of critical genes, here represented by CTGF
  and α2(I) collagen. Also illustrated is a non-canonical pathway resulting in the
  activation of c-Abl. As pictured, imatinib blocks the activity of c-Abl, effectively
  inhibiting the fibrotic response although the events downstream of c-Abl are presently
  unknown. Imatinib also blocks the phosphorylation of Smad1, but here also the pathway
  is unknown.
