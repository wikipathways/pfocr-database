caption: 'Regulation of ferroptosis by E-cadherin and EMT. Left: E-cadherin activates
  the Hippo pathway, thereby inactivating YAP- and TAZ-activity. This leads directly
  or indirectly to decreased expression of proteins that are relevant for ferroptosis
  (note that decreased levels of NOX4 and NOX2 are due to reduced expression of EMP1
  and ANGPTL4, respectively, see text for details). However, involvement of additional
  genes and/or signalling pathways is likely. Ferroptosis is blocked. Right: EMT—for
  instance, triggered by activation of ZEB—leads to a loss of E-cadherin expression
  and inhibition of the Hippo pathway. Although the downstream targets have not been
  elucidated so far, YAP/TAZ activation supports ferroptosis. Additional pathways
  remain to be elucidated. However, this can be counterbalanced by phosphorylation
  of AKT (or, possibly, other mechanisms). Activated AKT may lead to a decreased level
  of ACSL4 as well as increased formation of MUFAs and CoQ10 via mTORC1 stimulation.
  Ferroptosis is prevented.'
