caption: 'cGAS: Bridging Immune Surveillance and Tumor Biology cGAS enhances the recognition
  of cytosolic DNA by promoting autophagy and interacting with STING, thereby facilitating
  immune responses while regulating intracellular metabolism and homeostasis. As a
  key sensor, cGAS recognizes DNA damage within the cell and activates the cGAS-STING
  pathway, promoting antitumor immune responses while influencing the immune evasion
  mechanisms of tumor cells. Under oxidative stress conditions, cGAS identifies cytosolic
  DNA and activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, thereby enhancing antiviral
  and inflammatory responses, while also participating in apoptosis and the activation
  of inflammasomes, further influencing cellular senescence. cGAS serves as an intracellular
  DNA sensor that, through the activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, promotes
  cellular senescence and chronic inflammation, impacting cell death mechanisms and
  contributing to the development of autoimmune and metabolic diseases. In the tumor
  microenvironment, cGAS activates the STING signaling pathway by recognizing DNA
  released from tumor cells, enhancing immune responses, promoting T-cell infiltration,
  and facilitating the formation of immune memory. However, its activation may also
  increase PD-L1 expression, promoting tumor immune evasion and progression. cGAS
  plays a pivotal role in antitumor immunity by activating the STING pathway to mobilize
  inflammatory and immune responses, while also enhancing cellular response to endogenous
  and exogenous threats through interactions with signaling pathways such as NF-κB
  and PERK. The activity of cGAS is influenced by various regulatory mechanisms, including
  acetylation and m6A modification, which enhance cGAS''s ability to bind DNA and
  regulate its expression, thereby promoting antiviral and antitumor immune responses.
  cGAS plays a critical role in ferroptosis and cuproptosis by activating the cGAS-STING
  pathway, promoting the death of tumor cells and the polarization of macrophages,
  thereby enhancing antitumor immune responses and modifying the tumor microenvironment,
  which affects tumor progression. As a key immune surveillance factor, cGAS recognizes
  bacterial DNA in the gut microbiome and regulates inflammatory responses, while
  also enhancing antiviral immune responses through the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis, with
  its activity influenced by the composition of the gut microbiome and its metabolites.
  In the tumor microenvironment, cGAS regulates immune responses through the cGAS-STING
  pathway, for example, by promoting the secretion of IL-6, impacting the immune evasion
  of tumor cells, while also enhancing the response to immunotherapy by regulating
  DNA damage responses and augmenting the functions of cytotoxic T cells. PERK: Protein
