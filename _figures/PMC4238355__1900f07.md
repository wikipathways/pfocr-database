caption: Model for roles of microRNAs during the reprogramming process. MicroRNAs
  induced by the four factors regulate intracellular and extracellular processes involved
  in cell fate decisions. Intracellularly, microRNAs target signaling pathways that
  are barriers for iPSC generation, such as TGFβ signaling, the p53–p21 pathway, and
  cell cycle control. Meanwhile, some microRNAs, such as miR-135b, regulate expression
  of ECM genes to establish a growth environment that promotes the fully reprogrammed
  state. Both groups of microRNAs work collaboratively following 4F transduction to
  reprogram MEFs to iPSCs.
