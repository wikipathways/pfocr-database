caption: Integrated analysis of transcriptional and metabolic changes. Expression
  profiles for each condition are displayed as a heat map for genes predicted to be
  involved in nitrate reduction (A), branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis (B), acetate
  utilization (C), and glycerol-3-phosphate coupled nitrate reduction (D). In each
  panel, the expression level normalized by Z-score is displayed. In each heat map,
  rows are genes associated with the pathway step (integer numbers note individual
  enzymes, while decimals indicate subunits), and columns are condition time points.
  Nt, no treatment control; Cys, cysteine treatment; Sulf, sulfide treatment. Additionally,
  for specific metabolites for which the absolute concentration was quantified (e.g.,
  amino acids) or for which a metabolomic feature was associated, the Z-score of the
  metabolite abundance (or relative abundance) is displayed. The metabolomic feature
  number is indicated for metabolites with putative identification. Error bars represent
  the standard deviations from biological replicates (n ≥ 3).
