caption: Schematic representation of the miR-20a-mediated promotion of FSS-induced
  osteogenic differentiation. FSS activates miR-20a up-regulation, and then miR-20a
  promotes FSS-mediated osteogenic differentiation by activating the BMP2 signaling
  pathway by directly down-regulating the negative regulators of the BMP2 signaling
  pathway, SMAD6 and BAMBI. FSS, fluid shear stress; ECM, extracellular matrix; BMP2,
  bone morphogenetic protein 2; BAMBI, BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor; SMAD6,
  mothers against decapentaplegic family member 6; SMAD, mothers against decapentaplegic
  family member; RUNX2, Runt-related transcription factor 2; SP7, SP7 transcription
  factor; ALP, alkaline phosphatase.
