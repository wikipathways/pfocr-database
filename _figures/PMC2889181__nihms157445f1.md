caption: 'Schematic diagram of cholesterol anabolism divided in a branching process
  that starts with mevalonate synthesis and includes the rate limiting enzyme, HMGCR.
  Subsequent to the mevalonate pathway, isoprenoid side-products and squalene are
  generated. The post squalene portion commits to sterol synthesis and leads to lanosterol
  production. The pathway then takes two routes: cholesterol synthesis I and II. Both
  pathways result in the production of cholesterol but differ in the specific enzymatic
  steps and intermediate metabolites of the pathways. Cholesterol synthesis pathway
  I is further subdivided into cholesterol synthesis III that is most prominent during
  early brain development.'
