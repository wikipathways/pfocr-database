caption: A) Phosphorylation of MARCKS by Cdk5 could modulate its interaction with
  actin filaments leading to stabilization of actin cytoskeleton. B) Involvement of
  Grin1 phosphorylation by Cdk5 in actin dynamics and neurite outgrowth. GPCR stimulation
  activates MAPK signaling pathway with increased of Egr1 and p35 expressions and
  subsequent increases in Cdk5 activity, which in turn phosphorylate Grin1. Additionally,
  GPCR stimulation promotes neurite outgrowth possibly mediated by the phosphorylation
  of Grin1 by Cdk5 and Cdc42-PAK-LimK-Cofilin pathway.
