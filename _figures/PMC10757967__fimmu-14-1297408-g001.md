caption: mTORC pathways and activation mechanisms of mTORC1. The components of mTORC1
  are slightly different from those of mTORC2. RAPTOR and PRAS40 are unique to mTORC1,
  whereas mTORC2 contains mSIN1, PROTOR, and RICTOR. Several external stimuli, such
  as immune signals and growth factors, activate PI3K, which catalyzes the transversion
  of PIP2 to PIP3. The latter can induce the activation of PDK and AKT by phosphorylation.
  PIP3 can also activate mTORC2. AKT is a potent stimulator of mTORC1 activity by
  inhibiting TSC, a GTPase-activating protein. mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome
  and activated by RHEB with GTP binding, whereas TSC facilitates the transition from
  GTP to GDP and suppresses RHEB-mediated mTORC1 activation. In addition to the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1
  pathway, growth factors can activate the Ras/Erk/RSK1 pathway to ameliorate the
  negative effect of TSC on mTORC1 activity. Cellular energetic status is another
  determiner of mTORC1 activity. AMPK can detect the increasing ratio of AMP to ATP
  caused by glucose deprivation and inhibit mTORC1 directly and indirectly by phosphorylating
  RAPTOR and activating TSC, respectively. However, AMPK serves as an activator of
  mTORC2. In addition to RHEB, mTORC1 is recruited and activated by the Ragulator-Rag
  complex induced by amino acids. Rag A/B and Rag C/D bound to GTP and GDP, respectively,
  facilitate the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosome and activate it with the
  assistance of Ragulator. CASTOR1 and Sestrin2 sense the alterations in the content
  of Leucine (Leu) and Arginine (Arg) and mediate the mTORC1-activating signals by
  suppressing GATOR2, which mitigates the negative effect of GATOR1 on Rag heterodimer.
  Changes in Arg in the lumen of lysosomes are sensed by v-ATPase, which activates
  mTORC1 through the Ragulator-Rag pathway. Glutamine (Gln) is converted to α-KG during
  glutaminolysis, which generates ATP to inhibit AMPK and activate mTORC1. α-KG regulates
  the nucleotide-binding state of Rag B via PHDs, and Gln enhances the translocation
  of mTORC1 to the lysosome via Arf1. PI3K, phosphoinositide 3 kinase; RTK, receptor
