caption: Three specific families of pattern recognition receptors, RIG-I-like receptor
  signaling pathway (A), Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (B), and NOD-like receptor
  signaling pathway (C), were responsible for detecting various pathogens and generating
  innate immune responses. These pathways were simplified and modified from KEGG.
  The genes boxed with blue border in the pathways were identified in common carp.
  Genes marked in pink represent DEGs in RNA-seq.
