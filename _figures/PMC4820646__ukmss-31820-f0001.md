caption: The CREB cascade. CREB is regulated by diverse signalling pathways, and can
  thus serve as a central integrator for the actions of numerous external stimuli,
  including antidepressants (ADT). Antidepressants which have distinct acute targets
  are known to recruit several signal transduction pathways, including cyclic AMP
  – protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) cascade, the MAP kinase signalling pathway (MEK/ERK)
  as well as calcium and phospholipase C (PLC) signalling. A downstream consequence
  of enhanced CREB function is thought to be the increased expression of target genes
  like the neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neuropeptide
  Y (NPY), which may contribute to the ADT-mediated changes in structural plasticity
  and behaviour.
