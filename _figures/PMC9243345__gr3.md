caption: Basement membrane signaling cascade. Basement membrane core molecules—laminin,
  type IV collagen, perlecan, and nidogen—regulate cell adhesion, migration, polarization,
  proliferation, and differentiation via directly or indirectly binding to cell surface
  receptors such as dystroglycan (DG), integrin, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), and
  discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1). For example, laminin-6 plays a role in mechanical
  signaling transduction by assembling into multi-molecular fibrillary complexes with
  perlecan via a DG-dependent and integrin-independent manner. Laminin binding to
  DG also triggers the GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2)-RAC1-PAK1-JNK
  (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) pathway that contributes to hypertrophy. Evidence shows
  a direct connection between DG and MAP kinase (MEK) and between DG and extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Type IV collagen plays a role by interacting with
  the laminin network through perlecan and nidogen followed by binding with integrins
  and DDR1. Perlecan modulates cell survival, migration, and proliferation by tethering
  growth factors., By binding to laminin and type IV collagen, nidogen plays a role
  in maintaining capillary integrity through forming a non-covalent high-affinity
  stabilizing bridge.
