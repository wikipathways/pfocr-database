caption: 'Recent mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of antiphospholipid
  antibodies (aPL) and APS. Starting at the bottom of the figure and moving roughly
  clockwise: In the vessel wall of atherosclerotic plaques, beta-2 glycoprotein I
  (β2GPI)-specific TH1 cells trigger cell death and release interferons (IFNs). Endothelial
  cells (ECs) release vesicles (like microparticles) that activate TLR7 in other ECs
  by delivery of single-stranded RNA. aPL-mediated platelet activation relies on phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K). Type I IFNs reduce the function of restorative circulating endothelial
  progenitors, which may lead to the accrual of endothelial damage over time. Cofactor-independent
  aPL activate monocytes via endosomal reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in
  increased expression of tissue factor (TF). In response to aPL, neutrophils release
  neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which help facilitate thrombin activation.
  Complement activation, especially through the classical pathway, leads to the assembly
  of the membrane attack complex (MAC) on the endothelial surface, while also facilitating
  the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells.'
