caption: 'Two major de-nitrosylation pathways reduce s-nitrosocysteine in cells: the
  thioredoxin reductase (Trx) family of redox sensors that includes Glutaredoxin (Grx),
  and the indirect S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) system. a Trx removes the
  s-nitrosyl-group from the protein-SNO (either through Trx-mediated trans-nitrosylation
  or Trx-disulfide-bond formation within the protein-SNO) and then b generates a disulfide
  bond, freeing HON or NO + H+. Alternatively, the GSNOR system c first requires that
  glutathione (GSH) react with the s-nitrosocysteine of an S-nitrosylated protein,
  transferring the nitrosyl-group to the thiol of the cysteinyl-group of GSH generating
  GSNO. d Next, the enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) and co-enzyme NADH
  catalyzes the conversion of GSNO to an N-hydrosulfinamide (GSNOH) intermediate and
  subsequently to glutathione-disulfide (protein-GSSG) and hydroxylamine (not shown).
  e Protein-GSSG is then reduced to GSH through the activity of glutathione reductase
  (GR) and co-enzyme NADPH. f The Grx member of the Trx family has two modes of SNO
  reduction. Grx can form an oxidized Grx intermediate (Grx-SNO) on one cysteine residue
  following transfer of the nitrosyl-group from protein-SNO. This can either be reduced
  though the GSH pathway described above (mono-thiol reaction) or through the traditional
  Trx system (diol-thiol reaction) by producing a disulfide bond. g The now oxidized
  Grx is reduced by two GSH molecules to restore the cycle. This figure was created
  using Biorender.'
