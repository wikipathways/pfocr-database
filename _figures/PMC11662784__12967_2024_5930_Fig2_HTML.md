caption: 'The Role of DEAD-Box Helicases in Esophageal Cancer: DDX5: DDX5 enhances
  the expression of CDK2 and Cyclin D1, promoting the G1/S phase transition in esophageal
  cancer cells. Additionally, DDX5 mediates increased expression of E-cadherin and
  decreased expression of Vimentin, facilitating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) in esophageal cancer cells. Moreover, DDX5 promotes the expression of BIP,
  p-PERK, p-eIF2a, and P62, contributing to esophageal cancer progression through
  the induction of autophagy defects and endoplasmic reticulum stress. DDX5 also facilitates
  the expression of β-catenin and c-Myc, mediating cell proliferation and invasion
  in esophageal cancer via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. DDX46: Silencing DDX46
  causes cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and reduces the phosphorylation of Akt
  and IκBα, thereby inhibiting NF-κB activity and inducing apoptosis in esophageal
  cancer cells. DDX51: DDX51 promotes esophageal cancer progression by increasing
  the phosphorylation levels of PTEN, PI3K, AKT, and mTOR, thereby activating the
  PI3K/AKT signaling cascade'
