caption: 'Factors emanating from endoderm induce mesoderm layer formation. Gata4 in
  endoderm controls a non-cell-autonomous pathway for cardiac myogenesis. Other transcription
  factors and signalling molecules induce Gata4 in endoderm, which in turn induces
  secreted molecules that promote cardiac differentiation of the underlying cardiac
  progenitors to cardiomyocytes. This model did not exclude a direct function of Gata4
  in the mesoderm itself to promote cardiac differentiation as depicted by the question
  mark (?). Abbreviations: Eomes, Eomesodermin; Bra, Brachyury; Mesp, Mesoderm Posterior;
  Nkx, Nkx gene; Tbx, Tbx gene; Gata4, Gata4 gene.'
