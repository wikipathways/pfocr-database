caption: The L. pneumophila iol operon and pathway of myo-inositol catabolism. (A)
  The L. pneumophila lpg1653 to lpg1649 gene cluster forms the iol operon that contains
  five genes predicted to be involved in the metabolism of myo-inositol. The genes
  encode the putative inositol transporter IolT and the inositol catabolism enzymes
  IolG, IolCB, IolD, and IolE. The arrangement of the B. subtilis iol genes is shown
  for comparison. (B) For catabolism, inositol is taken up through the transporter
  IolT and oxidized to 2-keto-myo-inositol catalyzed by the inositol-2-dehydrogenase
  IolG. The dehydratase IolE produces 3,5/4-trihydroxy-cyclohexane-1,2-dione, which
  is linearized to 5-deoxy-gluconate catalyzed by the hydrolase IolD. IolB and IolC
  catalyze an isomerization and phosphorylation, yielding 2-deoxy-5-keto-d-gluconate
  and the central intermediate 2-deoxy-5-keto-d-gluconate-6-phosphate, respectively,
  which in B. subtilis and S. enterica are cleaved by the bisphosphate aldolase IolJ,
  yielding dihydroxyacetone phosphate and malonate semialdehyde. Malonate semialdehyde
  is converted into acetyl-CoA by the decarboxylating malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  IolA. The scheme is adapted from Yoshida et al. () and Kröger and Fuchs (). TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle.
