caption: A positive feedback loop from Snail to Cat L to CUX1 and back to Snail drives
  EMT and can be inhibited by Cat L inhibitor. A positive feedback loop may exist
  whereby Snail overexpression may promote its own gene's transcription and lead to
  E-cadherin repression in part through binding of CUX1 to the Snail and E-cadherin
  promoters, leading to an increase in EMT, migration, and invasion in prostate and
  breast cancer cells. This vicious cycle can be antagonized by Z-FY-CHO.
