caption: Neuronal apoptosis network. The directed network consists of 21 vertices
  representing proteins and 37 edges describing the regulatory interactions between
  vertices. The regulatory interactions are shown, wherein activation is represented
  by → and inhibition by ˧. Self-degrading vertices are shown in dashed-line rectangular
  box. The input vertices represent survival factor, GF and death ligand, FasL shown
  in triangular box. The output of network was measured from readout vertices which
  represent DNA Repair and APOPTOSIS. The activation of Mito box denotes the initiation
  of mitochondrial death pathway.
