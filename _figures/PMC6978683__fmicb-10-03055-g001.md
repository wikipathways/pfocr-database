caption: General scheme of the canonical chemotactic sensing and signaling pathway
  in the bacterial membrane for governing motility functions, which are also accessible
  for protein activity sensing. Receptor proteins associate in large complexes of
  trimers of dimers, spanning the inner membrane toward the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm,
  the receptors associate with the histidine kinase CheA and the adaptor protein CheW.
  Upon stimulus binding, CheA autophosphorylates. Subsequently the response regulator
  protein CheY activates and translocates the information to the flagella motor proteins,
  ultimately inducing a change in the direction of flagella rotation (dotted lines)
  or flagellar speed. The chemotaxis components, and flagellar basal body proteins,
  for instance the FlhA and FliM proteins, also provide a regulatory platform for
  diverse activity inputs and protein-protein interactions (symbolized by X). Phosphorylated
  CheY can be dephosphorylated for signal termination by various proteins, for instance
  CheZ. CM, cytoplasmic membrane; P, phosphoryl group. CW – clockwise; CCW – counterclockwise
  (for the direction of flagellar rotation). The top of the panel points to the outside
  of the bacterial envelope.
