caption: 'Model for congression via DCP and integration with checkpoint signaling.
  (a) Schematic depicting the contribution of kinetochore factors to movement (green
  arrow) of bioriented chromosomes by DCP. Inset shows single microtubule-kinetochore
  attachment site. The Ska complex attaches to, and tracks with, the curving protofilaments
  as they peel away from the lattice, thus generating a pulling force. This coupling
  is essential for the maintenance of P kinetochore attachment when under load. Attachments
  absolutely require the Ndc80 complex, which may also contribute to force generation
  by biased diffusion (dotted curved arrow). In addition to these coupling factors,
  MCAK, Aurora B, and CENP-Q—a subunit of CENP-O complex ()—contribute to force generation
  (Fpull). (b) Model for bioriented kinetochore maturation and attachment regulation
  during prometaphase. The canonical Aurora B error correction pathway destabilizes
  erroneous attachments (i.e., syntelic), promoting the formation of bioriented attachments.
  These unaligned bioriented kinetochore pairs then congress by DCP. During congression,
  each kinetochore progressively (and autonomously) loads Ska complexes. This increases
  the load-bearing capacity of the structure, enabling kinetochores to efficiently
  track the depolymerizing K-fiber microtubules, which are increasing in number and
  stability. Unaligned bioriented, but immature, kinetochore pairs do not silence
  the SAC. We propose that maturation is part of a mechanical microtubule attachment
  self-check: if the kinetochore does not recruit sufficient Ska complex, or microtubule
  recruitment is too rapid, the kinetochore will detach from its associated K-fiber.
  As a result, only mature bioriented sister kinetochores reach the metaphase plate
  and silence the SAC.'
