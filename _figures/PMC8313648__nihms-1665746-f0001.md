caption: (A) Illustration of the major peroxynitrite (ONOO–) biogenesis pathway. ONOO–
  is generated from the diffusion-controlled reaction between superoxide (O2•–) and
  nitric oxide (•NO). O2•– could be produced during mitochondrial respiration (oxidative
  phosphorylation) or by activated NADPH oxidase (NOX). NOX can be activated during
  cell signaling such as a growth factor binding to a growth factor receptor (GFR).
  Superoxide dismutase (SOD) can convert O2•– to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can
  mediate secondary radical (e.g. •OH or –OCl) production. •NO is produced by nitric
  oxide synthetase (NOS), which is coupled to arginine metabolism. ONOO– is a highly
  reactive nitrogen species that plays crucial roles in tyrosine nitration, lipid
  peroxidation, DNA damage, and cell death.(B) Sensing mechanism of pnGFP-Ultra. pnGFP-Ultra
  has a boronic acid-modified chromophore that can be converted to a phenolate chromophore
  upon reaction with ONOO–, resulting in a large fluorescence turn-on response.(C)
