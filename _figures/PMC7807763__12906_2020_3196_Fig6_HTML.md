caption: The proposed mechanism of luteolin on suppressing microcirculatory disturbance
  caused by cell adhesion. Luteolin could decrease the expression of adhesion molecules
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting LPS/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, which
  would suppress LPS-induced leukocyte adhesion. Subsequently, the other processes
  of microcirculatory disturbance induced by LPS such as hydrogen peroxide production,
  mast cell degranulation, blood flow reduced and mesenteric artery pathological changes
  were also improved
