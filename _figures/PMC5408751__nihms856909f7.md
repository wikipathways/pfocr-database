caption: GSK-3β modulation of LKB1-AMPK pathway in autophagy induction. (A) With serum/growth
  factors supplement, cells are growing normally due to PI3K-AKT pathway activation,
  which suppresses GSK-3β activity. Meanwhile, sufficient nutrient supply also leads
  to low activity of LKB1-AMPK pathway. (B) Under serum starvation, cellular AMP accumulates
  and LKB1-AMPK pathway is activated, resulting in autophagy induction. Meanwhile,
  inactivation of PI3K-AKT pathway also leads to increase of GSK-3β activity, which
  serves as a checkpoint of LKB1-AMPK pathway to control the extent of cellular autophagy
  activity. (C) Under serum starvation, GSK-3β inhibition removes its restrictive
  action on LKB1-AMPK pathway, leading to profound autophagy and cell death. Bif-1
  accumulation is also involved in this process as reported (22).
