caption: Conceptual model of possible molecular events describing OsHV-1 and Crassostrea
  gigas interactions in the infected oyster cells. Replicating OsHV-1 DNA amplifies
  the production of viral RNAs, dsRNAs and proteins necessary for virion assembly
  and responsible of some host-pathogen interactions (e.g. OsHV-1 IAPs). The binding
  of viral DNAs and dsRNAs to specific oyster receptors, namely endogenous TLRs (eTLRs)
  and RIG-I/MDA5 proteins, activates the Toll and Interferon pathway, respectively
  (red boxes) and leads to the transcription of antiviral effectors (green boxes).
  Pro-apoptotic genes, like caspases, Pro-PO elements, like tyrosinases and laccases,
  and interferon stimulated genes, like viperin and ADAR-1 are upregulated during
  OsHV-1 infection. These antiviral effectors control the virus, which counteracts
  by expressing anti-apoptotic viral genes (IAPs, like ORF99). Oyster ADAR-1 edits
  dsRNAs with a mechanism known as A-to-I editing, producing G mismatches that impair
  dsRNAs, and possibly making the edited dsRNAs less effective in activating dsRNA
  receptors, while the impact on OsHV-1 replication is unknown. A few oyster miRNAs
  are regulated during OsHV-1 infection, but their function in controlling host and
  viral genes remain unclear
papertitle: Parallel analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs suggests distinct regulatory networks
  in Crassostrea gigas infected by Ostreid herpesvirus 1.
