caption: Regulation of proximal tubule glucose transporters in disease. (1) Hyperglycemia
  enhances filtered glucose and, via SGLT2 (and SGLT1, not shown), the reabsorption
  of glucose and Na+ in the proximal tubule. (2) Diabetes can increase the renal membrane
  expression of SGLT2; proposed mechanisms include tubular growth, angiotensin II
  (Ang II), and hepatocyte nuclear factor HNF-1α, which may respond to basolateral
  hyperglycemia sensed through GLUT2. (3) Hyperinsulinemia and tubular growth may
  induce a coordinated upregulation of proximal tubular transport systems, including
  SGLT2, NHE3, URAT1, and Na+/K+-ATPase. The resulting increase in proximal tubular
  Na+ retention enhances GFR via tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), which by increasing
  brush border torque may further increase luminal membrane transporter density in
  the early proximal tubule. (4) Diabetes, in part due to the associated acidosis,
  can enhance gluconeogenesis in the early proximal tubule. The resulting increase
  in intracellular glucose may feedback inhibit on SGLT2 expression. (5) HNF-1α and
  HNF-3β upregulate GLUT2, the basolateral exit pathway of glucose. (6) The relevance
  of apical translocation of GLUT2 in diabetes remains to be determined, but may be
  secondary to excessive SGLT2-mediated glucose uptake. (7) Increased glucose reabsorption
  maintains hyperglycemia. Induction of TGFβ1 and tubular growth may be particularly
  sensitive to basolateral glucose uptake via GLUT1. (8) Hypoxia induced by kidney
  injury or due to diabetes-induced hyperreabsorption may induce HIF1alpha, which
  inhibits apical transporters (not shown) and facilitates basolateral glucose uptake
  and a metabolic shift to glycolysis
