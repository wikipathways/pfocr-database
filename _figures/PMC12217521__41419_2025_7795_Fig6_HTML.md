caption: PIK3CA mutations activate the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in ADSCs, transforming
  them into Mac-ADSCs and altering their cytokine secretion profile. The differentially
  secreted cytokines from Mac-ADSCs influence neighboring wild-type cells by activating
  their PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and enhancing their proliferation, migration, and
  invasion abilities. Additionally, these cytokines promote angiogenesis in VECs and
  adipogenesis in ADSCs. Notably, this paracrine effect can be reversed by the PIK3CA
  inhibitor BYL-719. This figure was created with Figdraw (https://www.figdraw.com/)
