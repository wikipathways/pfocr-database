caption: Molecular mechanism through which IAV regulates innate immunity via autophagy/mitophagy.
  IAV infection rapidly induces the host innate immune response through a variety
  of regulatory factors essential for pathogen clearance and host survival. PB1-F2
  antagonizes innate immune responses by inducing mitophagy (as indicated by the red
  arrows). PB1-F2 completely translocates into the mitochondrial inner membrane space
  via Tom40 channels, which leads to a reduction in ΔΨm. The accumulation of PB1-F2
  accelerates mitochondrial fission, and the decrease in ΔΨm inhibits the RIG-I signaling
  pathway and NLRP3 activation. In addition, PB1-F2 functions as an autophagy receptor
  protein and simultaneously interacts with LC3 and TUFM domain I to mediate mitophagy.
  PB1-F2 inhibits mitophagy-dependent type I IFN production by negotiating the sequestration
  of mitochondria (including MAVs) into autophagosomes. Unlike PB1-F2 proteins, the
  M2 protein antagonizes the autophagy process to enhance host antiviral innate immune
  responses. The M2 protein anchors to mitochondria, promotes mitochondrial fusion
  and increases the mitochondrial number. M2 induces PI3K–Akt–mTOR-dependent autophagosome
  formation but inhibits autolysosome formation. Furthermore, M2 increases ROS-dependent
  MAV aggregate formation through a mechanism dependent on its ion channel activity.
  Additionally, the M2 antagonist blocks the autophagy process of the interaction
  of MAVs with ATG5 or LC3 and, thereby reduces ATG5–MAV and LC3–MAV complex formation
  and decreases the degradation of MAV aggregates (as indicated by the black arrows).
