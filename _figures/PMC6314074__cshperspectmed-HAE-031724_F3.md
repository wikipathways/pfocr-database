caption: Life cycle of hepatitis E virus (HEV). (1) Nonenveloped HEV virions bind
  to cellular receptors. Heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and heat shock cognate
  protein 70 (HSC70) are thought to be the attachment receptors for HEV but more research
  is required to determine the entry receptors for HEV. Once bound to the cell, virions
  are taken into the cell through a dynamin-2, clathrin, and cholesterol-dependent
  process. (2) Quasi-enveloped HEV virions are capable of entering the cell via a
  clathrin-mediated pathway. This entry pathway appears to be dependent on Rab 5 and
  Rab7 GTPases and, unlike the unenveloped HEV virions, also requires lysosome function
  before uncoating within the host cell. (3) Heat shock proteins including HSP90 and
  Grp78 have been implicated in transporting virions to sites of genome release. (4)
  Once released into the cytoplasm, the positive-strand genomic RNA serves as messenger
  RNA (mRNA) for the translation of the open reading frame (ORF)1 nonstructural polyprotein.
  (5) Whether or not processing occurs for the ORF1 polyprotein remains debatable,
  but the viral nonstructural proteins within ORF1 transcribe the positive-sense RNA
  genome into a negative-strand intermediate. This step occurs at either the rough
  endoplasmic reticulum (RER) or RER-derived membrane vesicles and involves host proteins,
  including elongation initiation factors, and viral proteins, including ORF4 for
  genotype (gt)1 HEV replication. The subgenomic bicistronic mRNA is generated from
  the negative-stranded RNA and serves as messenger for translation of ORF2 and ORF3
  proteins. (6) Host ribosomes translate the newly synthesized RNAs into more nonstructural
  proteins and the ORF2 and ORF3 proteins. (7) There are a number of unknown steps
  to virus assembly. ORF2 binds to viral genomic RNA and begins to multimerize. ORF3
  also binds to ORF2 during transition to the plasma membrane. (8) Particles become
  membrane-associated likely by budding into intracellular vesicles via interaction
  of the ORF3 protein with host vacuolar sorting proteins such as tumor suppressor
  gene 101. These enveloped particles retain the trans-Golgi network protein 2 protein
  and CD63 on their lipid surface until particle release. (9) The plasma membrane
  serves as the final site for release of enveloped virions via the exosomal release
  pathway and is sensitive to disruption of Rab27a and Hrs. (10) At some point during
  transit through the host digestive system, the viral envelope is lost. HEV released
  into the bloodstream appears to retain its quasi-envelope, which is thought to mask
  the capsid shell from the host immune system.
