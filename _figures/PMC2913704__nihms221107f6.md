caption: TGFβ1 (left) binds to its receptor (TβRII) on astrocytes in active MS lesions,
  activating the serine/threonine receptor kinase ALK5. This leads to phosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation of Smads 2 and 3 as heterodimers with Smad4, and Jagged1
  gene transcription. Jagged1 expressed at the surface of reactive astrocytes binds
  to Notch1 receptors on OPCs (below), leading to S3 cleavage of Notch1 and nuclear
  translocation of NICD. Activation of Notch1 signaling alters the balance between
  OPC proliferation and differentiation. Under the influence of canonical Notch signaling,
  expansion of the progenitor pool is favored, at the expense of differentiation and
  myelin formation.
