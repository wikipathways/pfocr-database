caption: Microbiota dysbiosis alters gastric epithelial cell signaling pathways. H.
  pylori promotes nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of YAP and β-catenin
  in gastric epithelial cells, leading to activation of target genes CDX2, LGR5, and
  RUVBL1, facilitating cell proliferation and expansion, ultimately resulting in GC
  development. H. pylori also induces the expression of IL-11 and cancer-related genes
  Ptger4 and TGF-β. H. pylori enhances autophagy gene ATG16L1, increasing IL-8 production,
  driving carcinogenesis. H. pylori induces the expression of G6PD and D-LDH in host
  cells, facilitating glycolysis, and energy production. F. nucleatum upregulates
  transcription factor SP1, activates lncRNA ENO1-IT1 transcription, guides KAT7 histone
  acetyltransferase to modify target gene ENO1, increasing host cell glycolysis. δ-valerobetaine
  produced by various bacteria inhibits mitochondrial FAO and increases lipid accumulation
  via transcription factor PPAR-α. SCFAs serve as substrates for lipid synthesis.
  Additionally, the microbiota can induce sustained inflammatory responses, generate
  ROS, causing DNA fragmentation, membrane disintegration, and protein misfolding
  through modification of key substrates such as nucleic acids, lipids, and proproteins,
  leading to cellular senescence, secretion of SASPs, and accelerated tumor growth.
  EBV infection can activate the cGAS-STING pathway and upregulate the expression
  of OLFM4, thereby leading to the activation of YAP in recipient cells
