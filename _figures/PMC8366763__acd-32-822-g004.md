caption: 'The schematic molecular mechanism by which 4E1RCat or 4EGI-1 enhanced the
  antitumor effect of sorafenib in HCC cell lines. As the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction
  inhibitors, both 4E1RCat and 4EGI-1 block the binding of eIF4E and eIF4G and inhibit
  the formation of eIF4F complex that participates acquired drug resistance. However,
  Thr37/46 site mutation of 4E-BP1, which promotes the binding of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E
  and then inhibits the formation of the eIF4F complex, failed to enhance the effect
  of sorafenib. Besides, the coadministration of sorafenib and 4E1RCat or 4EGI-1 downregulated
  the expression of eIF4E and eIF4G, as well as inhibiting the PI3K-AKT signaling
  pathway. Overall, these indicate that the synergetic relationship between drugs
  might be due to the inhibition of eIF4E, eIF4G, or PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. 4E-BP1-Thr37/46:
  4E-BP1 Thr37/46 mutation. HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.'
