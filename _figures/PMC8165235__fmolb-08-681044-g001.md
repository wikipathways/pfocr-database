caption: The genetic basis of Bladder Cancer. Distinct genetic pathways are involved
  in the development of muscle-invasive or non-muscle invasive BC. NMIBC can be sub-classified
  into low-grade, which are mainly superficial (papillary) tumors that grow into the
  bladder innermost layers but do not invade the muscle layer, and high-grade, which
  include a subset of superficial tumors as well as carcinoma in situ (CIS), which
  are characterized by a flattened layer of dysplastic cells that is presumed to be
  the major precursor of muscle-invasive bladder tumors. NMIBC low-grade papillary
  lesions are frequently associated with either activating mutations in RAS (usually
  the H-Ras isoform) or FGFR3 gene (these mutations are mutually exclusive, meaning
  that they do not occur together). On the contrary, FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations usually
  co-occur in NMIBC. The Wnt pathway can also be involved in NMIBC when in combination
  with RAS pathway activation. In MIBC lesions, as the name suggests, the cells invade
  the adjacent muscle layer of the bladder and, in some cases, progresses to metastatic
  tumors. The most commonly found mutations in high-grade lesions such as non-muscle-invasive
  CIS or MIBC are loss of p53 and RB function. Loss of PTEN function and activation
  of the Wnt signaling pathway are also related to high-grade tumors especially MIBC.
