  Expression Reveal Pathway Convergence on Potential Target Genes.Three-way comparison
  of SSTF genes responding to 1 h Rc (WT-D versus WT-R1), long-term (2d)-Rc (WT-D
  versus WT-Rc), and to the pifq mutations in darkness (WT-D versus pifq-D). Classification
  of the genes as induced (B) or repressed (C) is based on the direction of the response,
  relative to WT-D, elicited by each genotype treatment combination. A small group
  of 25 genes in Classes 4 to 7 were designated as ambiguous as the direction of the
  response relative to WT-D differed between WT-R1, WT-Rc, and/or pifqD. These genes
  are listed in Supplemental Data Set 5 online and were excluded from the analysis
  shown in (B) and (C). The mean fold change in expression relative to WT-D (set at
  unity) for all genes in each class is shown in the bar graphs in (B) and (C). Error
  bars represent the mean standard error for the genes averaged for each genotype
  treatment combination. Percentage of genes having a G-box in the 3-kb upstream regulatory
  sequence is indicated in parenthesis.(A) Venn diagram showing comparison among all
  genes in the three different sets of SSTF differentially regulated genes (left panel).
  This comparison between genes responding to WT-R1, WT-Rc, and pifq-D resulted in
  the definition of seven classes of responsive genes (right panel) corresponding
  to the sectors of the diagram (circled numbers in red). The number of genes in each
  sector/class is indicated in black.(B) Induced genes. The number of induced genes
  in each class is indicated by the black numbers in each sector of the Venn diagram.
  The gene lists are in Supplemental Data Set 3 online.(C) Repressed genes. The number
  of repressed genes in each class is indicated by the black numbers in each sector
  of the Venn diagram. The gene lists are in Supplemental Data Set 4 online.
