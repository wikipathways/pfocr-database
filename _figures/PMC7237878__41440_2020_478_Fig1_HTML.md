caption: Possible associations of the renin-angiotensin system with SARS-CoV-2 infection
  and lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts
  angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II). Ang II signaling leads to organ
  damage, such as lung injury, by promoting inflammation and fibrosis through the
  Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and has opposing effects through the Ang II type 2
  receptor (AT2R). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) converts Ang II to Ang-(1–7)
  and Ang I to Ang-(1–9). Ang-(1–7) signaling attenuates the effects of inflammation
  and fibrosis through the Mas receptor (Mas-R). It has been suggested that ACE2 is
  upregulated by some ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and AT1R blockers (ARBs). ACE2 is also
  a receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). ACE2-binding
  SARS-CoV-2 is internalized by endocytosis into the cell, and membrane-anchored ACE2
  on the cell surface is downregulated. Downregulation of ACE2 promotes organ damage
  through activation of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and deactivation of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas-R
  pathway. Another mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmembrane protease serine
  2 (TMPRSS2)-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 accompanied by ACE2. ACE2 is also shed
  from the membrane by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), and the soluble
  form of ACE2 may intercept the virus from binding to membrane-anchored ACE2 in the
  cell plasma membrane. Possible increases in the expression and soluble form of ACE2
  induced by RAS inhibitors would have beneficial effects of protection against lung
  injury and other organ damage but not infection with SARS-CoV-2
