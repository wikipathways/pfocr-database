caption: Catalytic cycle for E. coli DHFR, showing the canonical cycle for the WT
  enzyme (black) and the alternate pathway enabled by the N23PP/S148 mutations. Rate
  constants for the dissociation of product and oxidized cofactor are shown in black
  for WT and red for the N23PP/S148 mutant in complex with ddTHF and NADP+.
