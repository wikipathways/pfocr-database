caption: Exosomes secreted by BMSCs, modified with HO-1, deliver miR-124-3p. miR-124-3p
  targets STEAP3, reducing the conversion of Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ and promoting the transport
  of Fe²⁺ via DMT1, thereby regulating the process of ferroptosis. In the Fenton reaction,
  Fe²⁺ induces lipid peroxidation, increases lipid ROS, and activates ferroptosis,
  a process that is suppressed by the antioxidant action of GPX4. Additionally, miR-25-3p
  in the exosomes can inhibit PTEN, thereby regulating the p53 signaling pathway and
  reducing cell apoptosis
