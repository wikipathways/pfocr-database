caption: PDE4-inhibitor-induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells appears to occur by a PKA-mediated
  pathway, as the percentage of cells that undergo apoptosis following rolipram treatment
  is reduced by co-treatment with the PKA antagonist Rp-8-Br-cAMPS. In contrast, activation
  of the cAMP effector EPAC1 by the EPAC-specific agonist 8-CPT-2Me-cAMP is anti-apoptotic
  in B-CLL cells. As the net effect of PDE4 inhibitor treatment is to induce apoptosis
  in B-CLL cells, the pro-apoptotic PKA-mediated pathway appears to predominate over
  the anti-apoptotic effects of PDE4-inhibitor-mediated EPAC activation. One study
  reported that PKA signalling induces apoptosis in B-CLL cells by activating PP2A,
  which in turn dephosphorylates BAD, releasing it from 14-3-3 proteins, and allowing
  BAD to initiate apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway. Cyt C, cytochrome c.
