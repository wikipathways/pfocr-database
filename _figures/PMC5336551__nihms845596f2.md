caption: Genes that are mutated in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are involved
  in several cellular pathways (blue boxes). As such, mutations in these genes can
  lead to a range of cellular consequences, such as aberrant DNA repair and B cell
  receptor (BCR) signalling, among others,. The minus sign from GBN1 to the MAPK–ERK
  pathway indicates negative regulation. *For more detail of the BCR and its associated
  signalling, see . ASXL1, additional sex combs-like protein 1; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia
