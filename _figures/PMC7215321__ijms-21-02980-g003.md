caption: Necroptotic signaling pathway exemplified by tumor necrosis factor alpha
  (TNF-α)-mediated activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)1. Activated
  TNFR1 forms a multi-protein complex I that transmit either pro-survival response
  (NF-κB activation) or cell death response, which is mediated by cylindromatosis
  (CYLD)-dependent deubiquitylation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1).
  Complexes-IIa/b are formed when the activation of caspase-8 can proceed apoptosis.
  Upon inhibition of caspase-8, complex IIc (necrosome) mediates activation of mixed
  lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) by phosphorylation at Ser358 that results in pore
  formation in the plasma membrane and Ca2+ influx. Compounds that inhibit necroptosis,
  including necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), necrostatin-1s (Nec-1s), and necrosulfonamide (NSA)
  are shown in orange background.
