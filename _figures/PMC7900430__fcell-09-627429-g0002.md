caption: The mechanism of the inhibitory role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in preadipocytes
  during adipogenesis. (Left) When in preadipocytes the canonical Wnt pathway is turned
  on by autocrine Wnt10b, this leads to nuclear localization of β-catenin in the nucleus,
  where it can bind with LEF/TCF. This transcription factor complex starts the expression
  of Axin2 and other genes related to stem cell maintenance and proliferation. Axin2
  binds with GSK3β in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing migration into the nucleus.
  In this state, inactive C/EBPβ prevents the expression of transcription factors
  C/EBPα and PPARγ. Additionally, Snail inhibits the expression of C/EBPα. (Right)
  If the Wnt pathway is turned off this results in the start of terminal differentiation
  into mature adipocytes. Immediately preceding Wnt inactivation in preadipocytes,
  destruction of β-catenin in the cytoplasm by the destruction complex results in
  an absence of nuclear β-catenin. Without Axin2, GSK3β localizes into the nucleus
  where it phosphorylates Snail and C/EBPβ. Phosphorylation of Snail is accompanied
  by its degradation while phosphorylation of C/EBPβ renders its activation. These
  events start the expression of PPARγ C/EBPα, both crucial for initiating the final
  stage of adipogenesis. Changes in gene expression and epigenetic regulators prevent
  the production and secretion of endogenous Wnt ligands. Moreover, PPARγ starts the
  expression of Axin2, a Wnt signaling inhibiter.
