caption: In the wing imaginal disc, the diffusible ligand Hh exerts its function by
  binding to its receptor Ptc, which relieves the inhibitory effects of Ptc on Smo.
  Smo signalling then activates the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci)
  and its target genes. The work by Spannl et al () demonstrates that the splicing
  factor Ecd directly splices several enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, GAPDH,PYK
  and PDK to drive glycolysis, ATP production and membrane potential via the Na+ (blue)/K+
  (orange)‐ATPase pump. The sodium/potassium pump in addition to importing nutrients
  into the cell is also responsible for transporting a small lipoprotein (LPP)‐associated
  inhibitor called N‐acylethanolamides (purple) that destabilises Smo to repress Hh
  signalling and maintain the correct shape of the developing wing imaginal disc.
