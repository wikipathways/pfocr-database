caption: ROS homeostasis regulates plant cold tolerance. The Ca2+ signal is not only
  associated with the generation of early ROS signals but also promotes the clearance
  of excessive ROS. In addition, plants can scavenge excess ROS by increasing the
  activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, POD, CAT, GPX, APX, GSTU, and AsA.
  Moreover, H2O2, as a signaling molecule, positively regulates the expression of
  CBF1. Furthermore, CBF is involved in the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins and
  promotes ROS clearance
