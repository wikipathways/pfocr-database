caption: A simplified model showing ethylene–dependent and low temperature–modulated
  ripening pathways in kiwifruit. In ethylene–dependent ripening pathway, ethylene
  exclusively regulates the expression of specific genes (orange) as well as common
  genes (green). The expression of these ethylene–induced genes can be suppressed
  by 1–MCP application. Equally, low temperature regulates the expression of specific
  genes (blue) as well as common genes (green). Induction of these genes by low temperature
  is not suppressed by 1–MCP application, implying that they are independent of ethylene.
  Ripening–related gene classes are represented as rectangle (ethylene biosynthesis–related
  genes), oval (cell wall modification–related genes), wavy (carbohydrate metabolism–related
  genes), diamond (flavor–related genes), and pentagon (Gibberellin–2–oxidase genes)
