caption: The pathway of intrinsic apoptosis. BH3-only proteins are upregulated in
  response to apoptotic stress. They activate BAX (BCL-2-associated X protein) and
  BAK (BCL-2 homologous antagonist killer) which oligomerize and results in mitochondrial
  membrane permeabilization. Cytochrome c, SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator
  of caspase), and Omi are released and the apoptosome is formed from procaspase-9,
  dATP, cytochrome c, and APAF-1. Caspases are then activated and begin to cleave
  cellular proteins resulting in apoptosis. Arrows represent activation and T bars
  represent inhibition.
