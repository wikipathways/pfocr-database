caption: The intrinsic pathway refers to mainly mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway.
  The intrinsic pathway triggered by various extra and intra-cellular stresses, which
  include oxidative stress, irradiation, and treatment with cytotoxic drugs.,  shows
  the pathways of apoptosis, the intrinsic pathway is mediated by Bax/Bak insertion
  into mitochondrial membrane, and subsequently, cytochrome c released from the mitochondrial
  intermembrane space into the cytosol. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Bcl-2 family member) are
  anti-apoptotic proteins which prevent the release of cytochrome c. The cytochrome
  c combines with Apaf–1 and procaspase-9 to produce apoptosome. Apoptosome is a multi-protein
  complex which comprised of a seven-spoke ring-shaped complex, which triggers caspase
  9 followed by the activation of caspase-3 signaling caspase cascade which leads
  to the demolition of cells and ends up to apoptosis.,, Proteins that are generally
  involved in intrinsic pathway include SMAC/DIABLO (Second mitochondrial activator
  of caspases/direct IAP binding protein with low PI), Caspase-9 (Cysteinyl aspartic
  acid-protease-9), Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma protein 2), Bcl-w (Bcl-2 like protein),
  Nox (Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1), Aven (Cell death regulator
  Aven) and Myc (Oncogene Myc). The dysfunctional mitochondrial results in loss of
  inner mitochondrial membrane potential, hyperproduction of superoxide ions, disturbance
  in mitochondrial biogenesis, the outflow of matrix calcium glutathione and release
  of membrane proteins,, hold promising potential for cancer therapeutic strategies
  via induction of apoptosis in cancer cells which are discussed later in this review.
