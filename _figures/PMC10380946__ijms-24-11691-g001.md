caption: 'Principal mechanism of apoptosis activation. (A) Activation of extrinsic
  pathway occurs through ligand binding to death receptors (FAS, TRAIL-R, or TNFR1),
  subsequently mediates bind of adapter proteins (FADD or TRADD) building DISC, activating
  caspase-8/-10 and -3. (B) Several stimuli trigger intrinsic pathway like cytokine
  deprivation, increase generation of ROS, DNA damage, and ER stress (blue arrow),
  causing MOMP that leads to the release of the mitochondrial proteins [cytochrome
  c (red dots), Smac (blue dots)], and subsequent activation of initiator caspase-9
  and executioners caspases-3, -6, and -7 concluding in apoptosis. (C) There is crosstalk
  between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways through the cleavage of caspase-8,
  which generates a tBid. tBid triggers MOMP, amplifying the apoptotic signal. FAS:
  Fas cell surface death receptor. TRAIL-R: TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
  receptor. TNFR1: TNF receptor superfamily member 1A. FADD: FAS-associated death
  domain protein. TRADD: TNFR-associated death domain protein. DISC: Death-inducing
  signaling complex. ROS: Reactive oxygen species. DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid. ER:
  Endoplasmic reticulum. MOMP: Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. tBid:
  Truncated form of Bid.'
