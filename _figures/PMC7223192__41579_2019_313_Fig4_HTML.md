caption: Intermediates of central metabolism are diverted towards the provision of
  precursors for polymer synthesis. Four general mechanisms for the production of
  polysaccharides in bacteria are shown. Synthesis of some secreted non-repeating
  polysaccharides, such as alginate and cellulose, is mediated by multiprotein complexes,
  usually consisting of a polymerase, a copolymerase, carbohydrate-modifying enzymes
  and secretion subunits. The genes encoding such functionally related protein subunits
  are co-clustered in large operons, such as the alg and bcs operons. Some polysaccharides,
  such as xanthan, are produced through the Wzy-dependent polysaccharide synthesis
  mechanism. In this pathway the repeating sugar units and their linked lipid carriers
  are assembled by several glycosyltransferases at the cytoplasmic membrane, followed
  by flipping across the cytoplasmic membrane, the final polymerization step in the
  periplasm and secretion. However, the synthesis of some polysaccharides, such as
  hyaluronate, dextrans and levans, is less complex and is mediated by a single enzyme.
  Dextrans and levans are synthesized outside the cell by sugar transferases that
  convert disaccharides into polysaccharides and use the energy that is released by
  hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond of the disaccharides. Modification of secreted
  polysaccharides (for example, acetylation, deacetylation, epimerization and phosphoethanolamine
  (pEtN) addition) can occur during translocation of nascent polymers across the cell
  envelope. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (for example, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)) are synthesized
  by a polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase that coverts hydroxyacyl-CoA derivatives of central
  metabolism into intracellular polyesters. Enzymatic processes independent of ribosomal
  protein biosynthesis synthesize polyamides. Dashed lines indicate multiple enzymatic
  steps, a circled plus sign indicates positive correlation and a circled minus sign
  indicates negative correlation. ABC, ATP-binding cassette; CPS, capsular polysaccharide;
