caption: 'CD8+ T-cell metabolism in COVID-19. (A) In comorbidity-free patients developing
  asymptomatic/mild symptomatic forms of COVID-19, cytotoxic immune response mediated
  by effector CD8+ T-cells results in eradication of virus and patient recovery. Normal
  antigen levels in antigen-presenting cells and cytokine levels (interleukin IL-2
  released by helper CD4+ T-cells) stimulate TCRs and co-receptors such as CD28, thus
  enhancing mTOR signaling via PI3K and protein kinase B that increases glycolysis.
  Cells shift from OXPHOS/FAO to glycolytic-based metabolism, whereby anabolic processes
  activate effector cells to clear infection. This includes production of cytotoxic
  factors (type 1 Interferon, granzyme, perforin) and enhanced proliferation. Massive
  increase in glycolysis results in production of ATP (less than OXPHOS but sufficient
  to inhibit AMPK, preventing mTOR pathway blockade. ROS production activates Nrf2,
  reducing inflammation and apoptosis by inhibiting NF-κB and pro-inflammatory cytokine
  production. (B) Aging and age-related disorders cause CD8+ T-cell senescence in
  severe COVID-19. Excess antigens upregulate inhibitory receptors (programmed death-1:
  PD-1) that block TCR activation, thus reducing signaling required for glycolytic
  metabolic phenotype itself crucial to proper effector functioning. Malfunction is
  compounded by upregulation of PD-1 expression-enhancing transcription factors, reduction
  in helper cell survival and proliferation signaling (IL-2), and increase in inhibitory
  signals. Senescent CD8+ T cells secrete SASP, paracrinely amplifying production
  of inflammatory cytokines and triggering cytokine storm. Massive decrease in glycolysis
  causes fall in ATP production and fails to sufficiently inhibit AMPK which then
  partially inhibits mTOR pathway. Substantial ROS production activates Nrf2 but fails
  to inhibit NF-κB pathway and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These events
  combined make cells malfunction metabolically, inhibit cytotoxic function and exhaust
  the phenotype.'
