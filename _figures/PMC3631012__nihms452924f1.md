caption: In response to DNA damage, the Mi-2/NuRD complex, like other ATP-dependent
  chromatin remodeling complexes (such as INO80, SWI/SNF, RSC, and SWR1), might be
  recruited to the site of damaged DNA, and exerts its function in DNA repair by multiple
  different mechanisms. It was shown that MTA1, an integral component of the Mi-2/NuRD
  complex, is a multiple functional DNA damage responsive protein. MTA1 regulates
  p53-dependent and –independent DNA repair processes following IR treatment by modulating
  the p53-p53R2 and p21WAF1-PCNA pathway, respectively. In this context, MTA1 controls
  p53 stability through inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligases Mdm2- and COP1-mediated
  ubiquitination by destabilizing of Mdm2 and COP1 and/or by competing with COP1 to
  bind to p53, thereby regulating the p53-dependent transcription of p53R2, a direct
  p53 target gene for supplying nucleotides to repair damaged DNA (left panel). In
  addition, MTA1 transcriptionally suppresses p21WAF1 expression by recruitment of
  MTA1/HDAC2 complex onto p21WAF1 promoter, and inhibits p21WAF1 binding to PCNA,
  thereby facilitates PCNA-dependent DNA repair. In addition, MTA1 is required for
  ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint function in response to UV irradiation. In this
  case, MTA1 interacts with ATR and is required for the ATR-mediated Chk1 activation
  and γ-H2AX induction following UV irradiation. Consequently, MTA1 deficiency results
  in a defective G2/M DNA damage checkpoint and increased cellular sensitivity to
  UV irradiation.
