caption: Scheme of the unfolded protein response (UPR), showing the sites of action
  of compounds that inhibit protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)
  signaling.The UPR is mediated by three endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane
  proteins that sense ER stress. Once activated, the kinase PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) in the cytoplasm. This inhibits protein
  translation, reducing the overload of misfolded proteins. Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible
  protein-34 (GADD34), a protein phosphatase upregulated by the PERK pathway, dephosphorylates
  eIF2α, providing a negative feedback mechanism that contributes to rapidly restoring
  protein synthesis upon resolution of ER stress. Sustained activation of PERK/eIF2α-P
  signaling causes chronic translational attenuation leading to synapse loss and neurodegeneration,
  and selectively enhances translation of ATF4 that induces the expression of C/EBP
  homologous protein (CHOP), eventually triggering apoptosis. Activated inositol-requiring
  enzyme 1 (IRE1) initiates the unconventional splicing of the mRNA encoding the transcriptional
  factor X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) to produce sXBP1, a more stable form of XBP1
  with a potent transactivator domain that enhances transcription of genes involved
  in protein folding, secretion and ER-associated degradation. Activating transcription
  factor 6 (ATF6) is transported to the Golgi where it is processed within the transmembrane
  domain to release the cytosolic domain, which translocates to the nucleus (nATF6)
  and induces the expression of ER chaperones. GSK2606414 is a potent inhibitor of
  PERK. Trazodone and dibenzoylmethane (DBM) reverse translational attenuation, acting
  downstream of eIF2α-P.
