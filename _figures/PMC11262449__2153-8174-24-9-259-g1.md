caption: Genes involved in glucose sensing, the reward system, sweet  taste receptors,
  the endocannabinoid system, and insulin mediated glucose uptake  found to have SNP
  associations with dietary sugar intake and/or cardiometabolic  risk factors in children.
  (A) The solute carrier family 2 (SLC2A2) gene  encodes GLUT2†, a facilitated glucose
  transporter, which has both  transport and receptor functions. DRD2†encodes dopamine  receptor
  D2. (B) TAS1R2* and TAS1R3*  code for proteins (T1R2 and T1R3) that heterodimerize
  to form sweet taste  receptors. GNAT3* encodes the alpha subunit of gustducin, the
  G  protein responsible for transmitting sweet, bitter and umami tastes from taste  receptors.
  Endocannabinoids bind with G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors,  i.e., CB1 and
  CB2 encoded by CNR1†and CNR2 respectively. (C) Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin
  type 1 and 2  (PCSK1*¤, PCSK2¤) encode  proprotein convertase 1/3 and 2 (PC1/3,
  PC2) respectively.  INSR*¤ encodes preprotein precursors cleaved into  alpha and
  beta subunits of the heterotetrameric insulin receptor. Binding of  ligands including
  insulin and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) along with  insulin receptor substrate
  1 (IRS1¤) or insulin receptor substrate  2 (IRS2) to the insulin receptor results
  in activation of the insulin signaling  pathway. *Genes that have been studied in
  preschool-aged children (includes 18  months–5 years) for a relationship with dietary
  sugar intake and/or  cardiometabolic risk [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]. †Genes
