caption: Notch1 pathway. Notch1 ligand (DLL, JAG) on the sending cell (Signal Sending
  Cell). The Notch1 receptor is activated on the receiving cell (Signal Receiving
  Cell), undergoes endocytosis, and is processed by ADAM metalloprotease and γ-Secretase.
  The release of NICD into the cytoplasm allows it to translocate into the nucleus
  where it binds to CSL, MAML, and co-factors to modulate the expression of Notch1
  target genes (i.e., HES4, DTX1, MYC) in cooperation with other transcriptional regulators.
  FBXW7 and PEST mediate NICD degradation
