caption: 'Heterogeneity of KRAS mutant cancer characterized by EMT and KRAS dependency.
  The role of mutant KRAS in proliferation and survival is variable in tumor cells
  driven by KRAS mutations. While KRAS-dependent cancer cells show an epithelial-like
  phenotype, KRAS is dispensable for the survival of mesenchymal-like KRAS mutant
  cancer cells. KRAS mutant cancer cells acquire mutant KRAS independency by various
  means: activation of RSK-mTOR pathway and/or KEAP1-NRF2 pathway, YAP activation,
  LKB1 loss, and mutant KRAS-independent PI3K activation. These bypass signaling pathways
  are involved in activation of survival signaling pathways, rewiring of metabolic
  pathways, and induction of EMT. EMT transcription factors also promote KRAS independency.
  The activated bypass signaling networks and EMT are interdependent. Abbreviations:
  EMT, Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; EMT-TFs, Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
