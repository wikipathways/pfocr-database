caption: Pathophysiology of NAFLD as a continuum from obesity to metabolic syndrome
  and diabetes. Environmental factors affect the expression of genes, inducing weight
  gain. When the capacity of expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) is reached,
  an increased free fatty acids (FFAs) mobilization arises, resulting in visceral
  and ectopic fat deposition. One ectopic site is the muscle, where increased FFAs
  deposition promotes insulin resistance (IR), inhibiting insulin-mediated glucose
  uptake. On the other hand, AT insulin resistance facilitates lipolysis and increases
  the flux of FFAs to the liver, inducing hepatic IR and enhancing glucose production,
  de novo hepatic lipogenesis, VLDL release and atherogenic dyslipidemia. FFAs spill
  over into the pancreas, causing β-cell dysfunction by lipotoxicity, hyperglycemia
  and diabetes (the twin cycle hypothesis). Increased liver fat also promotes hepatic
  glucagon resistance (GR) over the amino acids (AAs) metabolism, reducing ureagenesis
  and resulting in hyper-aminoacidemia. Increased AAs stimulate glucagon production
  to compensate for hepatic GR, and a vicious cycle is installed (the liver-pancreas
  axis). This hyperglucagonemia also leads to an increased hepatic glucose release.
  The globally IR state results in hyperinsulinemia, which may enhance sodium reabsorption
  and increase sympathetic nervous system activity, contributing to the hypertension.
  Inflamed dysfunctional AT becomes more insulin resistant and releases pro-inflammatory
  adipokines, while decreases anti-inflammatory adiponectin. In the liver, triglycerides
  and toxic metabolites induce lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic
  reticulum stress, leading to hepatocyte damage, apoptosis and fibrosis. These dysfunctional
  hepatocytes synthesize and secret the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which promotes
  inflammation of AT macrophages and more IR. AAs amino acids, AT adipose tissue,
  DPP4 dipeptidyl peptidase 4, FFA free fatty acid, GR glucagon resistance, HDL high-density
  lipoprotein, IR insulin resistance, LDL low-density lipoprotein, NAFLD nonalcoholic
  fatty liver disease, SAT subcutaneous adipose tissue, SNS sympathetic nervous system,
  VAT visceral adipose tissue, VLDL very low-density lipoprotein. Pointed arrows indicate
  stimulation or enhancement, while blunt ends indicate inhibition or repression.
  Dashed arrows indicate progressive reduction in a pathway
