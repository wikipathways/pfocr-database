caption: Schematic examples of protein palmitoylation and metabolism, cancer, inflammation,
  neurodegeneration. a. In the model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), palmitate
  induces CD36 palmitoylation, and the enhanced palmitoylation promotes the CD36/Lyn/Fyn
  complex, impairs FA β-oxidation, causes lipid accumulation, increases inflammation
  and cytokines release. b. Transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) is autopalmitoylated
  and it could be affected by intracellular palmitate levels. Palmitoylation of TEAD
  is required for its association with YAP and the regulation of transcriptional output
  of Hippo signaling. c. The de novo synthesis of palmitate by FASN and CD36-mediated
  exogenous FA uptake are two important sources for MYD88palmitoylation, which is
  essential for IRAK4 recruitment, p38MAPK and p65 activation, TLR4/MYD88 pathway.
  d. Palmitate deposition in the hippocampus increases GluA1 palmitoylation through
  FoxO3a-mediated overexpression of zDHHC3, resulting in altered GluA1 localization
  and function, suppressed AMPAR response and impairment of cognitive function. Figures
  include data from references , , , .
