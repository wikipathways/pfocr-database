caption: 'Analysis workflow: ChiP-Seq provides evidence of TF binding to promoter
  regions with 0 ≤ RP ≤ 1, quantifying the likelihood that this is functionally important.
  RNA-Seq quantifies Spearman’s correlation (ρ) between TF and gene expression. Filtering
  these data establishes potential TF–glycogene interactions in specific cancer types.
  TFs disproportionately regulating specific glycosylation pathways were identified
  using the above TF–glycogene relationships as well as biochemical knowledge available
  at GlycoEnzDB (green region). Reactome DB analysis helped to establish cell signaling-TF–glycosylation
  pathway connectivity that are visualized using alluvial plots. Independently, Cytoscape
  maps enabled visualization of TF–glycogene relationships in different cancer types
  (orange region). Clusters in the resulting interactomes were related to pathway
  maps and signaling processes, and thus developing TF–community signaling pathway
  relationships.'
