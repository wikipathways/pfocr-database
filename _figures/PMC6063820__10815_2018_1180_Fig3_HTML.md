caption: Activation of a primordial follicle is regulated by Hippo and Akt signaling.
  (A) Fragmentation force is likely transmitted through actin to activate the Hippo
  signaling pathway via Rho GTPase and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). (B) This
  leads to a dephosphorylated yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator
  with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) which enables entry into the nucleus. (C) Simultaneously,
  the Akt (protein kinase B) pathway is also activated by the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) that subsequently leads
  to Akt phosphorylation allowing it to enter the nucleus. (D) Upon entry, the forkhead
  box O3 (FOXO3) transcription factor, an essential mediator of follicle dormancy,
  is phosphorylated at the Akt site causing nuclear export into the cytoplasm. (E)
  The nuclear YAP/TAZ binds the transcriptional enhancer associate domain (TEAD) allowing
  for expression of growth factors (i.e., cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61/CCN1), connective
  tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2), and nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV/CCN3)) and
  baculoviral inhibitors of apoptosis repeat containing (BIRC) proteins. CCN and BIRC
  are growth factors that lead to follicular activation and cell growth. The red arrows
  indicate pathways that are likely active to activate the follicle while gray arrows
  signify non-active steps. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase-1; MST1/2, macrophage stimulating; SAV1, salvador 1; LATS1/2, large
  tumor-suppressor homolog*SUN1/2, transmembrane proteins; Nesprin, nuclear envelope
  spectrin repeat protein.
