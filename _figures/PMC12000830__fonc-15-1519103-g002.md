caption: Regulatory role of MEG3 in cancer progression and suppression. This figure
  depicts the multifaceted tumor-suppressive role of MEG3 in cancer regulation. MEG3
  induces cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 or G2/M phases, restricting uncontrolled
  proliferation, and promotes apoptosis by upregulating Caspase 9 and Cytochrome C
  while downregulating the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. It suppresses oncogenic activity
  by inhibiting c-Myc and B-actin and enhances tumor suppression by upregulating PTPN11,
  leading to increased p53 accumulation. MEG3 also inhibits metastasis by enhancing
  the expression of PTEN and modulates key microRNAs (miR-7, miR-27a, miR-19a, and
  miR-21) to balance oncogenic and tumor-suppressive pathways. Furthermore, it regulates
  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by modulating p53 and NF-κB signaling, preventing
  the transition of epithelial cancer cells into migratory mesenchymal cells. Through
  these mechanisms, MEG3 acts as a crucial regulator of cancer progression and suppression
