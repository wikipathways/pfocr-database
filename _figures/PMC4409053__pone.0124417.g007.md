caption: 'UVA irradiation induces production of PGE2 and its downstream molecule,
  cAMP through activation of AP-1 and NF-κB. cAMP molecule sequentially reduces expression
  of HIF-1α gene through CREB activation, consequently downregulating expression of
  stemness genes such as NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4. In the UVA irradiation-induced signaling
  pathway, aspartic acid attenuates UVA-induced effects on expression of stemness
  genes by inhibiting AP-1, which is upstream of PGE2 production. AA: aspartic acid'
