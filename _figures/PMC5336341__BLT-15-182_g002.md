caption: Proteomics and tracing experiments reveal the presence of previously unappreciated
  metabolic pathways in mature RBC.(A) An overview of the central metabolic pathways
  that are reasonably active in RBC in the light of proteomics evidence. Di- and tri-carboxylates
  can be metabolised by the enzymes indicated in the bottom left corner of the panel.
  (B) Enzymes identified in the cytosol of RBC in the present study which may be involved
  in sulphur/methionine synthesis and serine/folate metabolism are shown. Some reactions
  catalysed by IDH1 (A) or MTHFD1 (B) can generate NADPH without the activation of
  the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway (A). (C) An overview of metabolic
  reactions in nitrogen/arginine metabolism that are theoretically possible in RBC
  in the light of the enzymes identified in this study. (D) An overview of the 13C1,2,3-glucose
  labelling experiment and expected isotopologue distribution in downstream glucose
  oxidation, pyruvate carboxylation and malate dehydrogenase 1-dependent generation
  of malate. (E) Experimental results of 13C3-alanine detection in supernatants and
  cell extracts of stored RBC incubated with 13C1,2,3-glucose. Median ± interquartile
  ranges are shown. Enzyme abbreviations are consistent with Uniprot names in Online
  Supplementary Table SI.
