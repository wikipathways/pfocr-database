caption: Our current working model is that PM2.5 uptake at the ACE barrier (schematic
  on the left) results in the buildup of ROS in the lung alveolar cells (schematic
  on the right). Downstream of ROS, the ERS-related proteins, including the heat shock
  protein family member binding BiP, PERK, eIF2α, and p-eIF2α are activated. This
  series of critical intracellular signaling events leads to a CHOP protein-dependent
  activation of Caspase3 and subsequent apoptosis. The close interface between alveolar
  epithelial cells and the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries leads to
  potential vulnerability for both populations in response to environmental toxins
  such as PM2.5. The ACE chip may be a valuable tool for testing toxicity response
  and pathway activation at the level of heterotypic cell-cell interactions in a variety
  of tissue-based model systems.
