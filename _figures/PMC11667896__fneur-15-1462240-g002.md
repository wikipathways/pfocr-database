caption: GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) plays a vital role in neuroprotection and
  regeneration through multiple mechanisms. It promotes the expression of NGF and
  BDNF, activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and reduces neuroinflammation, thereby
  facilitating nerve regeneration. GLP-1 also enhances mitochondrial activity by activating
  AMPK, increasing the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, and
  reducing the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. It reduces oxidative
  stress by decreasing ROS production and upregulating antioxidant enzymes. Additionally,
  GLP-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway and reduces the activation of microglia
  and astrocytes, thereby mitigating inflammatory responses. Furthermore, GLP-1 significantly
  decreases cell apoptosis by regulating the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins and
  inhibiting apoptotic signaling pathways. These combined mechanisms enable GLP-1
  to play a vital protective role in maintaining the health and function of the nervous
  system
