caption: The canonical HH signaling pathway. In the absence of the HH ligand (left),
  PTCH binds SMO, leading to its degradation. Microtubule complex containing Gli and
  SUFU is phosphorylated by GSK3β/PKA/CK1 to activate Gli proteins, which subsequently
  combine with β-TrCP to switch into transcriptional repressor (GLI-R). In the presence
  of HH ligand (right), SMO restriction by PTCH is relieved, active SMO moves to the
  primary cilium. Active Smo interacts with the SUFU/GLI complex, localized at the
  top of the primary cilium, GLI proteins from the complex switch into transcription
  activators (GLI-A), which then translocate to the nucleus and activate the HH target
  genes, including PTCH, GLI1, FOXA2, BCL-2, BCL-Xl, MYC, and CYCLIN family among
  others.
