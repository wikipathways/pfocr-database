caption: Under normoxic conditions (left), neutrophils express high levels of PHD2
  which result in the targeting of HIF‐1α for proteasomal degradation. In this setting,
  neutrophil homeostasis relies on the glycolytic pathway. Neutrophils further increase
  both their glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway flux in response to hypoxic
  culture and stimulation (right). In addition, they also upregulate the influx of
  extracellular glucose and glycogen storage. The neutrophil TCA cycle is a dysfunctional
  cycle with only partial activity.
