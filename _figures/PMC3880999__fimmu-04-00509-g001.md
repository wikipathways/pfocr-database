caption: The molecular details of BAFF/BAFFR-mediated activation of NF-κB2 signaling
  pathway. (A) In the absence of BAFF a complex consisting of TRAF2, TRAF3, and cIAP1/2
  facilitate the degradation of NIK, the key kinase involved in activation of NF-κB2
  signaling. p100 inhibits NF-κB2 activation by sequestering RelB in the cytoplasm.
  (B) Following BAFF ligation of BAFFR, TRAF3 is recruited to the receptor and subsequently
  degraded by the combined actions of TRAF2 and cIAP1/2. Lack of TRAF3 deactivates
  the TRAF/cIAP complex, releasing NIK from degradation and allowing it to accumulate
  in the cell. NIK then facilitates degradation of p100 via direct phosphorylation
  and phosphorylation of IKKα. p100 is subsequently partially degraded and active
  p52/RelB dimers are able to migrate to the nucleus and initiate NF-κB2 specific
  gene transcription programs. Refer to Sections “” and “” of text for further details.
  Negative control mechanisms which impact on NF-κB2 activation are indicated within
  dashed boxed, including OTUD7, Act1, IKKα, and nuclear p100, refer to Section “”
  of the text for further details. Small black circles represent ubiquitin, small
  red circles with P are phosphorylations.
