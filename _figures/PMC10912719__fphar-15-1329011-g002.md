caption: 'DNPNB pathway. Representation of the sequential conversion of PRPP into
  AMP and GMP via the de novo biosynthetic pathway of purine nucleotides. The steps
  are labeled with specific colors and numbered, with a corresponding list of enzymes
  involved in each step provided for both bacteria and vertebrates (see Table 1).
  In vertebrates, six enzymes are responsible for converting PRPP to IMP, which is
  then further processed into GMP or AMP by several additional reactions. Prokaryotes,
  on the other hand, require fourteen enzymes to catalyze the chemical steps. The
  structure of each E. coli enzyme is illustrated. Resolved structures of E. coli
  enzymes have the following PDB accession numbers: 1ECB (PurF), 1GSO (PurD), 1CDE
  (PurN), 1KJ8 (PurT); 1CLI (PurM), 1D7A (PurE), 1B6S (PurK), 2GQS (PurC), 1PTR (PurB),
  1GPM (GuaA), 1ADE (PurA). For other E. coli enzymes to which no structure was resolved,
  the ortholog structures are shown with the following PDB accession numbers and percentage
  of sequence identities: 6JTA (Salmonella typhimurium PurL, 94% identity), 4A1O (Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis PurH, 43% identity), and 4DQW (Pseudomonas aeruginosa IMPDH, 66% identity)'
