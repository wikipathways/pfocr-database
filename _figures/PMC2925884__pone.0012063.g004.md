caption: An illustration of the model's suggested interactions between drugs coincident
  with hernia and proteins belong to the prostate cancer pathway. This is an example
  of a non-causative association where drugs listing prostate-related disease as their
  therapeutic indication indeed interact with proteins in the prostate cancer pathway.
  Since patients suffering from prostate cancer are likely to experience a post-operative
  hernia, an association between hernia and prostate cancer emerges. Node and edge
  representation is the same as .
