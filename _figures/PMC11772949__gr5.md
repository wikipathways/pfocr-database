caption: Modulation of RLRs induced by protein palmitoylationNLRP3 palmitoylation
  is induced by ZDHHC7 but suppressed by ABHD17A at Cys126. ZDHHC5 induces NLRP3 palmitoylation
  at Cys837/838. Palmitoylation of NLRP3 at Cys130 and Cys958 is regulated by ZDHHC1.
  Based on ZDHHC17, NLRP3 is palmitoylated at Cys419. Conversely, PPT1 suppresses
  NLRP3 palmitoylation. CD36 mediates the entry of phenylpyruvate into macrophages
  to inhibit PPT1 and promote NLRP3 palmitoylation. FASN enhances the palmitoylation
  of NLRP3 at Cys898. ZDHCC12 contributes to NLRP3 palmitoylation at Cys844 to inhibit
  its expression by improving NLRP3 degradation via the HSC70 and LAMP2A-associated
  autophagy-lysosomal pathways. In addition, ABHD8 can recruit ZDHHC12 to NLRP3 to
  enhance NLRP3 degradation. NOD1 is palmitoylated at Cys558, Cys567, and Cys952.
  NOD2 is palmitoylated at Cys395 and Cys1033. ZDHHC5 contributes to palmitoylation
  of both NOD1 and NOD2. Palmitoylation of NOD2 blocks its degradation via the SQSTM1-associated
  autophagy-lysosomal pathway. However, ABHD17 inhibits NOD2 protein stabilization
  by reducing NOD2 palmitoylation
