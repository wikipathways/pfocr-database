caption: Hypothetical working model illustrating βC1‐mediated counter‐defence against
  plant defence responsive hormones. Nuclear‐encoded chloroplast localized allene
  oxide synthase (AOS), allene oxide cyclase (AOC) and lipoxygenase (LOX) are key
  enzymes of JA synthesis pathway. The chloroplast membrane synthesized the polyunsaturated
  fatty acid, α‐linolenic acid (18:3) (α‐LeA), which is converted to 13(S)‐hydroperoxy‐octadecatrienoic
  acid (13‐HPOT) by the reaction catalyzed by LOX. AOS catalyzes the conversion of
  13‐HPOT to 13(S)‐epoxy‐octadecatrienoic acid (12,13‐EOT) and further to 12‐oxophytodienoic
  acid (OPDA) by AOC. OPDA, being involved in the production of jasmonic acid (JA),
  is transported to peroxisome and converted to JA by the action of OPDA reductase
  3 (OPR3). JA activates JAZ proteins, and other JA‐responsive genes, such as MYC2,
  PDF1.2, PR4, CORI3, VSPI, CYP79B2, etc. The MYC2 transcription factor activates
  the JA biosynthetic genes, terpene biosynthesis genes, and suppress the salicylic
  acid (SA) synthesis by down‐regulating the expression of isochorismate synthase
  1 (ICS1) through activating NAC transcription factor. In an infected plant cell,
  βC1 protein modulates the JA‐mediated defence response by targeting the MYC2 transcription
  factor. Interaction of βC1 with ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 (AS1) transcription factor suppresses
  the expression of MYC2, which is required for the synthesis of JA biosynthetic gene
  (1). βC1 protein also interacts and interferes with MYC2 promoter binding activity
  leading to the suppression of JA‐biosynthesis genes expression (2) and JA‐responsive
  gene (3). In chloroplast, nuclear‐encoded ICS catalyzes the conversion of chorismate
  to isochorismate and facilitate the production of SA. SA mediates the defence against
  biotrophic pathogens by activating SA‐responsive genes, siRNA pathway, and defence‐related
  reactive oxygen species production (ROS). Geminivirus‐βC1 protein localizes into
  chloroplast and interferes with PSII electron transport rate by affecting its oxygen‐evolving
  complex. βC1 mediated interference of PSII electron transport rate lead to intervenes
  in ROS production (4). The localization of βC1 in the chloroplast and disruption
  of its ultrastructure facilitate the optimal niche for virus probably by affecting
  the nucleus‐chloroplast signalling and the plant defence hormone (SA, JA) production
  (5). HR refers to hypersensitive response.
