caption: ROS functions in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). The balance between self-renewal
  and differentiation of PSCs is partly regulated by ROS which are mediators of cellular
  redox state. Increased levels of ROS (highlighted in green) caused by prolonged
  hypoxia, activation of oxidative phosphorylation by inactivation of the uncoupling
  protein 2 (UCP2), and mitochondrial dysfunction (disruption of the functioning of
  complexes I and/or III of the ETC of mitochondria) all lead to reduced self-renewal
  control and increased ESCs differentiation. Nox4-generated ROS are involved in the
  proper differentiation of mouse ESCs into smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage. Decreased
  ROS levels (highlighted in blue), which enhances glycolysis, or suppressing oxidative
  phosphorylation improve ESC self-renewal, while repressing their differentiation.
  SIRT1, as well as the serine–threonine liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK) pathway, activate FoxO3 transcription factor, upregulating antioxidant
  enzyme expression in ESCs upon oxidative stress and metabolic changes, respectively.
  Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and UCP2 negatively regulates the pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) complex, controlling the level of Acetyl-CoA and further protein acetylation.
  The activity of the components of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein
  kinase (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), PTEN, FoxO, as well as hypoxia
  inducible factor-a (HIF1a), SIRT1, and pyruvate kinase (PK) are all regulated by
  ROS (marked with a yellow asterisk).
