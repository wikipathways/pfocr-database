caption: 'Model of actions and interactions of the HSP network required for normal

  constitute a large group of chaperones that interact with non-native proteins, assisting
  their correct protein folding. HSPs are constitutively expressed, but their expression
  levels can increase under conditions of stress. They are mainly divided into groups:

  through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) or the autophagy-lysosome pathway.
  The central component of the chaperone network and folding catalysts is the Hsp70/HSPA
  family. Hsp40/DNAJs hydrolyze ATP (bound to Hsp70/HSPA) to ADP, increasing the affinity
  of its substrate-binding domain for unfolded proteins. Nucleotide-exchange factor
  (NEF) proteins remove ADP and substitute ATP, reducing Hsp70/HSPA’s substrate-binding
  affinity, allowing release of the folded protein. Proteins that are unable to utilize
  Hsp70/HSPAs for complete folding are transferred to the chaperonin or the Hsp90/HSPC
  system. For transfer of substrates from Hsp70/HSPA to Hsp90/HSPC, HOP is required
  as a co-chaperone. Under acute stress conditions, HSPB oligomers dissociate into
  dimers to bind unfolded substrates, thereby avoiding irreversible aggregation of
  client proteins. This process allows ATP-dependent chaperones to assist in the substrates
  refolding when normal physiological conditions are restored. (B) In the presence
  of chronic stress, which triggers protein misfolding, re-folding attempts might
  be particularly unsuccessful. Under such conditions, the HSP network can assist
  in protein unfolding and disaggregation, and specific targeting of the misfolded
  or even aggregated proteins for degradation is usually required. Members of each
  HSP family are shown to interact with misfolded proteins and to reverse the formation
  of aggregates. However, whether different HSPs functionally cooperate with each
  other in order to modulate mutated protein toxicity is not yet clear. Solid lines
