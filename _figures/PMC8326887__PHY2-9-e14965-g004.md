caption: The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and glycolysis. This figure shows
  important metabolic intermediates for these pathways as well as the main enzymes
  for the HBP and protein O‐GlcNAcylation. Intermediates shared between glycolysis
  and HBP are shown in black, HBP‐only intermediates are shown in red, and glycolysis‐only
  intermediates are shown in green. Glucose metabolized to fructose‐6‐phosphate (F6P)
  can enter the HBP or undergo further glycolysis to generate pyruvate. GFAT (enzymes
  shown in ovals) is the rate‐limiting enzyme in the HBP and uses glutamine to catalyze
  the conversion of F6P to glucosamine‐6‐phosphate. After a series of reactions, uridine
  diphosphate‐β‐GlcNAc (UDP‐GlcNAc) is the end product of the HBP and serves as the
  donor for the enzyme O‐GlcNAc transferase (OGT) to perform O‐GlcNAc protein post‐translational
  modifications. The enzyme O‐GlcNAcase (OGA) removes the GlcNAc moiety from proteins.
  Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis
