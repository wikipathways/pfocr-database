caption: A scheme depicting CpxR~P influence on the CsrA-Crp-RovM-RovA regulatory
  cascade. The RovM-RovA regulatory pathway leading to the controlled production of
  several virulence determinants – including the Y. pseudotuberculosis adhesin invasin
  – is strictly controlled by cascade regulation at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional
  levels in response to multiple environmental cues. The strongest influence on RovA
  production is through two opposing pathways. The first is an auto-amplification
  loop, which in turn is controlled by thermo-regulated proteolysis via the action
  of ClpXP and Lon proteases. The second is repression via RovM acting in concert
  with H-NS. RovM levels are principally controlled by an uncharacterised auto-activation
  loop and the prominent Csr and Crp pathways responsive to carbon and glucose availability.
  Additionally, we now show that the CpxR~P pathway responsive to extracytoplasmic
  (periplasmic) noxious stresses that is another critical player in this cascade regulation.
  Active CpxR~P isoform directly induces production of the RovM repressor, and also
  directly represses production of both RovA and invasin. By an uncharacterised mechanism
  active CpxR~P also negatively influences Csr output. Thus the net effect of CpxR~P
  is a significant downturn in RovA and invasin production, as well as other prominent
  virulence factors such as the Ysc-Yop T3SS (not shown here). In this context, it
  is interesting that the FliA sigma factor plays a role in the coordination of inverse
  regulation of invasin and the Ysc-Yop system (not shown). On this basis, a prediction
  would be that the regulatory events of CpxR~P and FliA are somehow connected. In
  the diagram, direct (filled line) or indirect (dotted line) induction events are
  indicated by a green arrow, while direct (filled line) or indirect (dotted line)
  repression events are indicated by a blunted red line.
