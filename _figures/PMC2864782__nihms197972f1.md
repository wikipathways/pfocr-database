caption: High levels of phosphotidyl inositol-protein kinase C signaling in the PFC
  markedly impair PFC function at the behavioral and cellular levels. Molecules that
  normally serve as brakes on this pathway and are highly associated with genetic/biochemical
  alteration in mental illness are indicated in gray. Patients with these genetic
  changes would have weaker regulation of phosphotidyl inositol-protein kinase C signaling.
  Many treatments for mental illness inhibit this signaling pathway through either
  extracellular or intracellular actions; these treatments are indicated in italics.
  Tamoxifen is a proof of concept (p.o.c.) treatment; prazosin is used to treat PTSD
  but not schizophrenia or bipolar disorder; chelerythrine is undergoing pre-clinical
  safety testing
