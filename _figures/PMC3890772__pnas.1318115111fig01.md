caption: (A) Structure of the NF-κB–IκBα complex to the κB DNA [Protein Data Bank
  (PDB) ID code 1VKX ()]. The RelA subunit of NF-κB is shown in green, the p50 subunit
  is shown in cyan, and the κB DNA is shown in (orange). Highlighted in bright pink
  is the AmC6–pyrene fluorophore, bound to the κB sequence. (B) Structure of the NF-κB–IκBα
  complex (subunits, coloring, and orientation are the same as in A bound and IκBα
  (magenta) [PDB ID code 1NFI ()]. The naturally occurring Trp-258 used as the fluorophore
  to monitor IκBα binding is highlighted in bright pink. (C) Schematic diagram of
  the NF-κB signaling pathway showing the feedback loop that produces newly synthesized
  IκBα in purple.
