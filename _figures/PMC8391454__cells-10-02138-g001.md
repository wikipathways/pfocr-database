caption: The highly conserved HH signaling pathway. Shown here is a scheme of the
  HH pathway. (Left panel), in the absence of HH, PTC inhibits SMO. Ci/GLI is processed
  into a truncated repressor form that enters the nucleus to block target gene expression.
  (Right panel), the presence of HH relieves the inhibition of PTC on SMO, leading
  to dimmerization and cell surface accumulation of SMO. Upon Hh stimulation, full-length
  Ci is activated to turn on target gene expression.
