caption: A diagram showing LMP1 signaling transduction to IRF4 activation. LMP1 is
  known to induce IRF4 expression via NFκB. In our current study, we show that LMP1
  recruits Src through P85 that is a subunit of the PI3K kinase complex, and that
  these two kinases constitutes a positive regulatory circuits, leading to Akt and
  IRF4 activation. Activated IRF4, in cooperation with a co-factor, regulates expression
  of its targets, such as IFI27, IFI44, CFLAR and BIC/miR-155.
papertitle: LMP1 signaling pathway activates IRF4 in latent EBV infection and a positive
  circuit between PI3K and Src is required.
