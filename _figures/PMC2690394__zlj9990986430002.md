caption: Molecular targets of natural chemopreventive agents. The cell signaling pathways
  activated by natural dietary agents are numerous and different for different agents.
  Multiple growth factor receptors (epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin-like
  growth factor 1 receptor, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor
  receptor) are activated at the cell surface in tumorigenesis. Activation of these
  receptors activates several downstream signaling pathways. Among these pathways,
  the Ras-MAPK (such as ERK and JNK) pathways, the JAK-STAT pathways, the PI3K-AKT
  pathways and the NF-κB pathways are important and are the targets of natural chemopreventive
  agents. Some natural agents inhibit the receptors at the cell surface either by
  dephosphorylating them or by inducing their degradation, which ultimately modulate
  the downstream signaling pathways important for proliferation, angiogenesis, and
  apoptosis. Inhibition of AKT and ERK signaling by natural agents is quite common,
  although in many cases this inhibition is the result of growth factor receptor inhibition.
  Inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway by interfering with multiple targets of signaling
  is another common target of natural agents. Many natural compounds generate reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), which activate p53 family members and induce cell cycle arrest
  and apoptosis. EGCG, epigallocatechin-3-gallate; ERK, extracellular signal–regulated
  kinase.
