caption: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of mitochondria- and MIEAP-related gene
  sets from METABRIC and TCGA cohorts. Mitochondria-related gene sets (mitochondria
  pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, reactive oxygen species pathway,
  unfolded protein response, activation of Noxa and translocation to mitochondria,
  electron transport reaction pathway) and p53-related pathway (apoptosis, p53) are
  shown. Normalized enrichment score (NES) and false discovery rate (FDR) are indicated.
  According to recommendation by the GSEA software, FDR<0.25 was considered statistically
  significant.
