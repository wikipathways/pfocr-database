caption: Model of 25HC-mediated regulation of accessible cholesterol. (1) 25HC secreted
  from IFN-γ activated macrophage enters the target cell and stimulates the enzymatic
  activity of ACAT (Step 1). ACAT activation results in production of cholesteryl
  esters that are incorporated into lipid droplets (Step 2). Cholesterol esterification
  lowers the free cholesterol levels in the ER, triggering internalization of accessible
  cholesterol from the plasma membrane (Step 3). Long-term suppression of accessible
  cholesterol is achieved through 25HC-mediated inhibition of the SREBP2 pathway which
  leads to lower cholesterol synthesis and uptake (Step 4).
