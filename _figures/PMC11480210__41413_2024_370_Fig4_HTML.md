caption: Role of 14-3-3 proteins in bone biology. The specific pathways and mechanisms
  by which different isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins modulate the differentiation and
  activity of various bone-related cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
  osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and osteoclasts, are elucidated during bone development
  and repair. Highlighting their involvement in key cellular processes, such as MSC
  differentiation, chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, and osteoclast differentiation,
  the pathways illustrate how isoforms like 14-3-3η, 14-3-3ε, and 14-3-3γ exert their
  influence through mechanisms like immobilization, phosphorylation, and regulation
  of anabolic factors or interaction with RANKL. The interconnected nature of these
  cellular events ultimately contributes to bone formation and homeostasis. Figure
