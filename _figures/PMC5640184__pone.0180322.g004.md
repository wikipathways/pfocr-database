caption: Statistically significant overrepresented KEGG pathways within the 5,084
  distinct genes with marked differential expression level as a response to endurance
  exercise. Pathway’s circle size is proportional to the number of annotated genes
  (node degree). Pathway’s node color refers to their specific main category according
  to the KEGG structure. Genes annotated to each pathway are color-coded according
  to their type of regulation (green codes for down-regulation and red for up-regulation).
