caption: 'Schematic diagram of carbon fixation and TCA cycle metabolic pathway responses
  to PEG and NO stress in Medicago sativa leaves. Transcripts encoding different enzymes
  are represented in black boxes. 1: ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (Ru-bisco);
  2: phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK); 3: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH);
  4: fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA); 5: fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP); 6:
  triosephosphate isomerase (TPI); 7: sedoheptulose-bisphosphatase (SBP); 8: transketolase
  (TKT); 9: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH); 10: citrate synthase (CS); 11: aconitate
  hydratase (ACO); 12: isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH); 13: α-oxoglutarate de-hydrogenase
  (α-KGDH); 14: succinyl-CoA synthetase (LSC); 15: succinate dehydrogenase (SDH);
  16: malate dehydrogenase (MDH). Heat map showing gene expression of DEGs under each
  treatment. Red and green colors indicate up- and down-regulated transcripts, respectively.
  The column graphs represent changes in metabolites or catalase activity in Medicago
  sativa leaves. Green and red colors indicate up- and down-regulated transcripts,
  respectively. Data are means ± SE of three replicates (n = 3). Different letters
  indicate significant differences among treatments (Tukey test at P < 0.05)'
