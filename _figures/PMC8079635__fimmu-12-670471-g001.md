caption: Roles of unconventional lymphocytes in intestinal repair. Gut ILC1 can produce
  MMP9 and TGFβ1 which contribute to extracellular matrix remodeling- a crucial part
  of repair. ILC2s become activated after exposure to IL-33 released by damaged epithelium,
  which results in their production of IL-13, which contributes to extracellular matrix
  remodeling and epithelial cell proliferation. Activated intestinal ILC2 also produce
  Areg which both enhances mucin production by epithelial cells increasing the mucus
  layer, and upregulates Claudin-1, increasing tight junction strength and reinforcing
  the barrier. Gut γδ T cells, or γδ IELs, can contribute to repair by the production
  of KGF which promotes epithelial proliferation, and via the production of AMPs such
  as RegIIIγ. In gut, the contribution of MAIT cells to healing responses remains
  relatively unknown, however these cells have been observed to respond similarly
  to human peripheral blood MAIT and can strengthen epithelial barrier integrity by
  inducing the tight junction protein, occludin, and by enhancing mucin expression
  to bolster the mucus layer. Intestinal ILC3s can become activated by PGE2, SCFAs,
  or IL-23 and IL-1β. Activated ILC3s produce IL-22 which promotes epithelial stem
  cell maintenance in a STAT3 dependent manner, and can also promote the DNA damage
  response. ILC3s can also promote epithelial cell proliferation via a Hippo/Yap-1
  pathway downstream of gp130. The factors released by ILC3s which signal via gp130
  are not known, but may be IL-6, Lif or Oncostatin M as these all signal via gp130-coupled
  receptors. Activated ILC3s also produce GM-CSF which contributes to M1 polarization
  of macrophages which inhibit healing, but also inhibit fibrosis which is associated
  with scar formation. ILC3s can produce IL-22 and IL-17 which promotes the production
  of AMPs and mucins by epithelial cells, but it is not known if these cells are the
  key producers of these cytokines in this context. Created with BioRender.com.
