caption: Schematic Representation of Potassium’s (K+) Role in Various Cellular Processes.
  (A) K+ interaction with hexokinase II (HKII) initiates glycolysis by converting
  glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). This segment traces the glycolytic pathway,
  showing the influence of K+ on key metabolic enzymes, including pyruvate kinase
  (PK), leading to pyruvate production and its metabolic outcomes in varying oxygen
  conditions. (B) The role of K+ in cell cycle regulation is depicted, beginning with
  the engagement of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) with its receptor IGF-1R.
  Activation of PI3K/Akt and RAS/ERK pathways leads to K+ channel-mediated membrane
  hyperpolarization, affecting Ca2+ uptake and activating transcription factors that
  govern cell cycle progression. (C) K+ is depicted as an inhibitor of apoptosis,
  where elevated K+ levels suppress the activation of caspase-8 (Casp8) and the CAD
  enzyme, highlighting its role in inhibiting the apoptotic process. (D) K+’s control
  over cell volume changes during cancer cell migration is shown, with a focus on
  the polarized distribution of K+ channels and other ion channels at the cellular
  edges. The coordination of these channels is critical for facilitating cell migration,
  a vital process in cancer metastasis. The question mark indicates that the exact
  potassium channel is not known. Cartoon in Figure 1 was created with BioRender.com
