caption: GSH biosynthetic route and GSH cycle. GSH biosynthesis occurs in two different
  ATP-dependent steps. The first and limiting step is carried out by GCL, formed by
  two subunits GCLC and GCLM. In this step Glu and Cys react to form γ-glutamylcisteine
  (γ-GC). GS is responsible of the second step that joins Gly forming γ-glutamylcisteinyl-glycine
  (GSH). Aerobic respiration or other ROS sources increase H2O2 that should be metabolized,
  in this case by GPx generating GSSG. This GSSG can be reduced to GSH again with
  the help of GR, creating a redox cycle, using as a reducing agent NAPDH, from the
  Penthose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) or folate metabolism (FM). GSH also forms mixed
  disulfides with proteins through S-Gluthathionylation, protecting redox sensitive
  Cys residues. Furthermore, glutaredoxins (Grx) can reduce disulfide (S–S) bonds
  in proteins, and glutathione S transferase (GST) uses GSH to conjugate and detoxify
  reactive electrophilic compounds (R).
