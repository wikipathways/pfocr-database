caption: FGFR signaling induces expression of the SPRED family, the Sprouty family,
  SEF, and nuclear DUSPs via transcriptional activation and translation to attenuate
  RAS/MAPK signaling. (A) Growth factor-activated RTKs induce GRB2-mediated recruitment
  of SHP2 to signaling complexes. GRB2 redirects activated SHP2 to other signaling
  proteins that normally inhibit RTK signaling, subsequently acting as a positive
  regulator. (B) Growth factor-activated RTKs recruit and activate PI3K. The PI3K
  lipid signaling intermediate is dephosphorylated by PTEN, thereby attenuating PI3K/AKT
  signaling. (C) SPRED proteins increase RAF recruitment to the plasma membrane and
  prolongs RAS/RAF complexation, withdrawing RAF from activation by phosphorylation.
  (D, D’) Sprouty proteins translocate to the plasma membrane where they are phosphorylated.
  This phosphorylation induces a confirmation change that allows Sprouty proteins
  to bind and disrupt the GRB2/SOS complex, RAS activation, and RAF activation, thereby
  attenuating RAS/PI3K and RAS/MAPK signaling. (E) RKIP binds to both RAF1 and MEK
  to prevent their physical interaction and MEK phosphorylation, thereby attenuating
  RAS/MAPK signaling. (F) SEF-b suppresses activation at the level of, or downstream
  from, MEK. (G) DUSP6 dephosphorylates ERK. Dashed lines connecting the human congenital
  disorder with the protein in the pathway encoded by the causative mutated gene.
