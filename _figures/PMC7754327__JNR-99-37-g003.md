caption: ERK1 and coiled‐coil and C2 domain containing 1A (CC2D1A) signaling pathways
  converge in cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB) activation to enhance learning
  and memory processes. ERK1 activity is modulated both positively and negatively
  by multiple kinases and phosphatase. Here, we show ERK1 phosphorylation by MAPK/ERK
  kinase (MEK) and ERK1 dephosphorylation by striatum‐enriched protein‐tyrosine phosphatase
  (StEP), specifically at the striatum, as possible pathway involved in reward learning
  process. StEP activity is, in turn, phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) and
  dephosphorylated by Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). CC2D1A binds and regulates phosphodiesterase
  4D (PDE4D) activity resulting in cyclic AMP (cAMP) degradation, and in PKA and CREB
  activation in the hippocampus
