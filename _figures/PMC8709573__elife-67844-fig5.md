caption: '(A) Schematic representation of the larval head and the chemosensory system.
  Bitter tastants detected at the level of external sense neurons are quinine in C3
  neuron () and denatonium in C7 and C1 (; ) but not caffeine, the latter being sensed
  through DP1 pharyngeal neuron (; ). Similarly, sugar taste seems to be also segregated
  at different levels of detection—brain Gr43a receptor neurons detect hemolymph sugar
  (), Gr43a expression in the pharyngeal organs (DP4 neuron) is central in sensing
  ingested sugar, while neurons like C2 and C5 contribute to sucrose preference at
  external level especially when food ingestion is less accessible ( and ). As the
  first gate for food evaluation, it is important to note the capacity of TOG neurons
  for integration of opposed valence taste wither within the same neuron as in C7
  (), or by co-activation of a sugar sensing with a bitter sensing neuron as suggested
  for C2 and C1 (). (B) Schematic representation of the proposed model in larval sugar
  sensing. Upper panel: When unable to ingest as readily, larvae utilize C2 and/or
  other TOG neurons to guide sugar preference via a C2/TOG pathway. Gr43a is the main
  internal nutrient sensor, expressed in the pharyngeal taste neurons, proventriculus
  (gut), and brain. While the lack of ingestion prevents pharyngeal-expressing Gr43a
  neurons from contributing to immediate sugar preference, internal metabolic state
  signals may alter behavioral output. Lower panel: upon ingestion, internal sensing
  mechanisms take over sugar-associated preference most specifically for fructose,
  with a diminished role of external neurons (C2/TOG).'
