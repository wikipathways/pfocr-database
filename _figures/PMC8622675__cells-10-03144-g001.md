caption: Functions associated with microglia in the homeostatic and activated states,
  including roles currently known and ascribed to microglial Hippo pathway components/YAP
  in Alzheimer’s disease (detailed in ). During homeostasis, microglia perform functions
  in the CNS to support neurons and to surveil for pathogens or other debris. Once
  activated by a number of possible stimuli, microglia change gene expression and
  function to increase their phagocytic ability, and to resolve infection/damage by
  releasing pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines. These activated functions may
  result in resolution of infection/damage and thus neuroprotection or, for example,
  in neurodegenerative diseases, result in continued inflammation and subsequent neurotoxic
  effects. Current evidence suggests that the Hippo pathway and YAP have important
  roles in microglia in the pathogenesis of AD. AD, Alzheimer’s disease; AMPK, AMP-activated
  kinase; YAP, Yes-associated protein; Aβ, amyloid beta.
