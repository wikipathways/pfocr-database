caption: 'PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, mTORC2 signaling, and
  the EMT process. (A) Upstream regulators and accompanying pathways affecting mTORC1;
  (B) downstream effectors regulated by mTORC1. (1) mTORC1 and mTORC2: rictor and
  mTOR are components of mTORC2, whereas raptor is the binding protein of mTORC1.
  (2) RTKs: extracellular growth factors bind to RTK and activate IRS1 and Ras. (3)
  Src: Src is activated by ER or Csk; Src activates PI3K to regulate PI3K/Akt cascade
  and activates Ras to affect ERK pathway and PI3K/Akt cascade. (4) PI3K/Akt/mTORC1:
  the PI3K/Akt cascade is activated by IRS1, Src, Ras, and Syk; Akt suppresses TSC1/2
  complex, which downregulates mTORC1 through Rheb, to upregulate mTORC1; mTORC1 phosphorylates
  S6K1 and 4E-BP1 to promote protein synthesis and cell growth, and phosphorylates
  ULK1 to inhibit autophagy; S6K1 inhibits IRS1 to form a feedback loop in PI3K/Akt/mTORC1
  pathway. Activation of mTORC1 results in accumulation of HIF-1α which increases
  the expression of VEGF. (5) Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK: Ras activates Raf; as a result, activated
  MEK1/2 upregulates ERK to affect cell proliferation. It is an important compensatory
  pathway of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway. (6) The cross-regulation of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  and PI3K/Akt/mTORC1: ERK inhibits PI3K and promotes mTORC1 directly or through repressing
  TSC1/2 complex. PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 negatively regulates Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by
  Akt inhibiting Raf. (7) mTORC2: PI3K activates mTORC2, which in turn activates Akt;
  RhoA is activated by mTORC2 and activates ROCK to induce the inhibition of cofilin
  and actin, and the increase of stress fibers; RhoA signaling plays an important
  role in cell migration and invasiveness through EMT process. (8) EMT: ERK pathway
  and the constitutive mTORC1 pathway converge on the Fra1–ZEB-1/2 transcriptional
  network to promote migration and invasion; NFκB activated by Akt induces SNAIL1
  stabilization which plays an integral role throughout EMT. (9) NR2F2: activated
  RAS upregulates COUP-TFII and increases lactate production; overproduction of lactate
  disrupts the interaction of TSC2 and Rheb to increase mTORC1 activity.'
