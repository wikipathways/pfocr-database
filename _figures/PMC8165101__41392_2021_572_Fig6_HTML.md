caption: Proteasome inhibition acts through multiple mechanisms to induce cell apoptosis.
  Proteasome inhibition leads to NF-κB deactivation, thereby downregulating multiple
  pro-neoplastic pathways associated with cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis,
  and angiogenesis. Inhibition of proteasome activates the JNK signaling pathway and
  results in programmed cell death via caspase 3 and 7. Additionally, proteasome inhibition
  can indirectly cause apoptosis by preventing the degradation of pro-apoptotic family
  proteins such as BAX, BID, BIK, and BIM as well as NOXA. Inhibition of proteasome
  prevents the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, which can increase endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress and activate the UPR, cell cycle arrest, and subsequent apoptosis.
