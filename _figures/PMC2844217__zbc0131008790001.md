caption: Schematic representation of the biosynthetic pathway of emetine, cephaeline,
  and related alkaloidal glucosides in P. ipecacuanha. Probable O-methylation steps
  in ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis are shown. IpeGlu1 has been identified by Ref. .
  The alkaloidal glucosides having an R-configuration, methylalangiside and 6,7-O,O-dimethylipecoside,
  both of which have two methoxy groups on the isoquinoline skeleton, have not yet
  been identified in P. ipecacuanha.
