caption: Hypothesized model of molecular signaling underlying the reconsolidation
  of cocaine-related contextual memory. NMDA receptor-dependent LTD plays an important
  role in the reconsolidation of cocaine-associated memory. The results presented
  herein support a model by which a protein phosphatase cascade, such as PP2B and
  PP1, is activated during LTD and results in the dephosphorylation of Akt and GSK3
  following the reactivation of cocaine contextual memories. The activation of GSK3
  inhibits the activity of mTORC1. Arrows indicate the direction of regulation during
  reconsolidation. GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PP2B,
  protein phosphatase 2B
papertitle: Reactivation of cocaine reward memory engages the Akt/GSK3/mTOR signaling
  pathway and can be disrupted by GSK3 inhibition.
