caption: Fig. 8. Models describing the relationship between CaGcn4, morphogenetic
  signalling and general amino acid control in C.albicans. Amino acid starvation induces
  CaGcn4, which activates the transcription of amino acid biosynthetic genes in an
  Efg1-independent fashion via the GCRE element in their promoters. Ras1 stimulates
  morphogenesis via both Ras-cAMP (Efg1) and MAPK (Cph1) pathways, but does not activate
  amino acid biosynthetic gene expression. CaGcn4 stimulates morphogenesis by interacting
  with the Ras-cAMP pathway. CaGcn4 might act downstream in concert with a Ras1-dependent
  factor. Alternatively, CaGcn4 might act upstream of Ras1, activating the pathway
  specifically in response to amino acid starvation (see text). Hence, CaGcn4 coordinates
  morphogenetic and GCN-like responses following amino acid starvation in C.albicans.
