caption: Schematic diagram of VNP-shCCDC25 blocking CCDC25-NET-DNA and remodeling
  immunity in B16F10-bearing mice and 4T1-bearing mice. Overall, VNP-shCCDC25 inhibits
  tumor lung metastasis after intravenous injection in mice. Specifically, VNP-shCCDC25
  mediates tumor lung metastasis inhibition through the following 3 mechanisms. (1)
  VNP-shCCDC25 knocked down CCDC25 and its downstream prometastasis signaling pathway
  ILK-Parvb-RAC1-CDC42 after successful invasion of tumor cells, which in turn reduced
  the invasiveness of tumor cells. (2) The NETosis at tumor site was somewhat inhibited
  after knocking down CCDC25. (3) In TME, elevated infiltration rates of M1-Mφs and
  N1-NEs with antitumor phenotypes as well as effective activation of DCs were observed,
  suggesting that VNP-shCCDC25 can remodel TME and ultimately achieve tumor metastasis
  suppression
