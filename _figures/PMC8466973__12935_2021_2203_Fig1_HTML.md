caption: The potential mechanisms underlying the effects of HTRA1 on EOC, BC and PC.
  In EOC, HtrA1 mediates apoptosis by inhibiting the levels of nuclear EGFR and XIAP,
  X-conjugated inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. In BC, PN-1 expression is regulated
  through the EGF/EGFR/PKCδ/MEK/ERK/EGR1 signaling pathway to inhibit the effect of
  the HTRA1 protein on tumors. In PC, HTRA1 directly inhibits the Notch-1 signaling
  pathway to regulate the tumor microenvironment
