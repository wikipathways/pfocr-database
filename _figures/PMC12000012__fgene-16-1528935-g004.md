caption: 'Hypoxia-regulated iron homeostasis and erythropoiesis. (A) Under hypoxic
  conditions, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) suppresses hepcidin transcription via
  inhibition of the R-Smad/Co-Smad and STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby enhancing
  dietary iron uptake to meet systemic demands. Erythroblast-derived factors (ERFE,
  GDF15, and TWSG1) further inhibit hepcidin expression, facilitating iron mobilization
  for hemoglobin synthesis in nascent erythrocytes. (B) Transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2)
  senses iron-saturated transferrin levels to regulate EPOR signaling dynamics. Elevated
  iron-saturated transferrin induces TFR2-dependent attenuation of EPOR sensitivity,
  suppressing downstream pro-erythroid proliferation pathways (e.g., JAK2/STAT5).
  Conversely, reduced iron-saturated transferrin alleviates TFR2-mediated EPOR inhibition,
  enhancing erythropoietin responsiveness. (C) Intracellular iron sensing is governed
  by iron regulatory proteins (IRPs): Iron deficiency promotes IRP binding to IREs,
  suppressing HIF-2α synthesis. Conversely, under iron-replete conditions, iron-bound
  IRPs dissociate from the 5′iron-responsive element (IRE) of HIF-2α mRNA, permitting
  HIF-2α translation and stabilization. These interconnected pathways maintain systemic
  iron equilibrium during hypoxic adaptation. Note: While this schematic highlights
  hypoxia-driven iron regulation, the precise iron metabolism network in HAPC remains
  undefined and warrants further investigation'
