caption: Different endothelial responses to different patterns of flow. (A) ECs lining
  straight blood vessels are exposed to laminar shear stress, whereas those linging
  branching or curved blood vessels are exposed to disturbed flow. (B) High laminar
  flow induces quiesent phenotypes in ECs including low proliferation rate, reduced
  cell death, and anti-inflammatory gene expression (left panels), while low or disturbed
  flow induces atheroprone phenotypes in ECs including high proliferation rate, increased
  cell death, and inflammatory gene expression (right panels). High laminar flow induces
  the expression of KLF2 and KLF4 via the MEK5/ERK5/MEF2 signaling pathway. KLF2 promotes
  the activation of Nrf2 and both KLF2 and Nrf2 promote quiescent phenotypes of ECs.
  Low or disturbed flow upregulates the expression of NFκB through JNK and its downstream
  ATF2. Flow-driven NFκB activation is mediated by integrin-dependent signaling upon
  binding to fibronectin. AP-1-, EGR1-, and YAP-dependent gene expression is also
  induced by disturbed flow. RhoA and F-actin are responsible for determinging the
  localization of YAP in sheared ECs, although it is not determined whether disturbed
  flow regulates the canonical Hippo pathway.
