caption: Potential mechanisms of EC pyroptosis in sepsis. The GSDMD-NT-dependent pathway
  participates in activating pyroptosis by inducing the formation of transmembrane
  pores and mitochondrial damage, which further promotes pyroptosis. The NLRP3-dependent
  pathway is important in pyroptosis occurrence, and several DAMPs, such as extracellular
  histones and eCIRP, and complement C3a can increase NLRP3 levels. Recent research
  has demonstrated that Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), hepatocytes, and macrophage
  can regulate pyroptosis by influencing caspase family proteins or NLRP3. Created
