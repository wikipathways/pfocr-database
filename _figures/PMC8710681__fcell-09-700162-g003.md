caption: 'Mitotic proteins and their role in the DNA damage response (DDR). (A) In
  DSBs by ionizing radiation, ATM phosphorylates the histone variant H2AX (Ser139)
  and the BUB1 kinase (Ser314). This phosphorylation promotes the colocalization of
  BUB1 with the foci of the γ-H2AX, also of interacting with the DNA damage protein,
  53BP1, associated with the NHEJ repair pathway. Further, BUB1 phosphorylates the
  H2A (Thr120), favoring the localization of SHUGOSHIN to the centromeres and activating
  the SAC (this last step is mitotic-dependent). (B) In response to DNA damage caused
  by UV-light or doxorubicin, BUBR1 can colocalize with PARP-1. Besides, in cells
  with low levels of BUBR1, PARP-1 cleavage is facilitated. However, it is unknown
  how BUBR1 could regulate PARP-1 and the DDR response. (C) Overexpression of MAD1
  prevents the localization of MDM2 and promotes the degradation of p53 in the presence
  of DNA damage. Furthermore, p53 can regulate the expression of MAD1. However, it
  is not clear if this regulation on MAD1 inhibits its activity or represses it. (D)
  MAD2 interacts with XPD (a subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH), inhibiting
  the binding of XPA with XPD. This causes a decrease in the repair efficiency and
  increases sensitivity to drugs that damage DNA, e.g., cisplatin. (E) In response
  to DNA damage, MPS1 phosphorylates CHK2 (Thr68), promoting its activation, which
  in turn phosphorylates MPS1 (Thr288), promoting its stabilization and activating
  the G2/M checkpoint. MPS1 phosphorylates MDM2 (Thr4, Thr305, and Ser307), increasing
  the activity of MDM2 on histone H2B. It has been proposed that the ubiquitination
  of histone H2B participates in response to DNA damage by oxidative stress. MPS1
  also binds to p53 and phosphorylates it at Thr8. This phosphorylation increases
  the stability of p53. This phenomenon has been proposed to be important in response
  to antimicrotubule drugs. (F) AURORA B interacts and phosphorylates p53 and promotes
  MDM2 ubiquitination and its degradation. The AURORA B expression reduces the transcription
  of p53 targets like p21 and BAX. AURORA B phosphorylated the residues: Serine 183,
  215, and 269, Threonine 211 and 284; however, the relevance of each residue on p53
  is unclear. Note: Created with BioRender.com.'
