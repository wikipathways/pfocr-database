caption: Iron overload, along with ox-LDL as the major component of lipid peroxidation,
  are contribute to ferroptosis and promote AS, which can be transferred by DFO. Fe3+
  through the cell membrane via TFR1, converted into Fe2+ by Fenton reaction. Too
  much Fe2+ causing iron overload in the cells, promote ferroptosis and accelerate
  the production of intracellular ROS, which promotes the polarization of M1 macrophages
  through the acetyl-p53 pathway to facilitate the occurrence of AS. The role of ox-LDL
  can be divided into two aspects. On the one hand, ox-LDL increases the expression
  of hepcidin by promoting the TLR4/NF-KB pathway, which enhances the degrading of
  Fpn, improving intracellular iron, and causing ferroptosis. On the other hand, the
  accumulation of intracellular lipid peroxidation has a mutual promotion effect with
  iron overload, which removal mainly through Gpx4. The interaction between ferroptosis
  and AS is probably through angiogenesis and inflammation.
