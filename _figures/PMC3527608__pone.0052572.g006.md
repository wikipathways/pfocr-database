caption: GTP has shown to affect epigenetic and various signaling pathways. GTP induces
  activation of extrinsic pathway of apoptosis to similar extent irrespective of their
  p53 status. However, intrinsic pathway is activated by p53 upregulation in cells
  possessing wild-type p53; whereas it is activated by inhibition of Akt, which in
  turn dephosphorylate BAD and activate intrinsic pathway in the cells lacking p53.
  The GTP-mediated cell cycle arrest and eventually cell death via induction of apoptosis
  is caused by upregulation of p21/waf1 due to downregulation of class-I HDACs, which
  in turn causes increase acetylation of histone H3 and its binding on to the promoter
  of p21/waf1, leading to increased p21/waf1expression in prostate cancer LNCaP cells
  irrespective of their p53 status.  demonstrate activation and  demonstrate inhibition.
