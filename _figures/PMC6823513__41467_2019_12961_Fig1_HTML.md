caption: Rewiring yeast central carbon metabolism for efficient production of aromatic
  chemicals. Introduction of a phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.22)-based pathway (green)
  to divert the glycolytic flux toward the formation of E4P. This consisted of a phosphoketolase
  to irreversibly cleave F6P into E4P and AcP, and a phosphotransacetylase to convert
  AcP into acetyl-CoA. The shikimate and AAA biosynthesis pathway were systematically
  investigated to relieve bottlenecks for biosynthesis of l-Phe and l-Tyr, two substrates
  for p-HCA production. A phenylalanine ammonia lyase and a cinnamic acid hydroxylase
  (PAL branch, pink) and a tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL branch, blue) were both employed
  for the biosynthesis of p-HCA production. Further optimization of carbon distribution
  between glycolysis and the AAA biosynthesis pathway was achieved by fine-tuning
  glycolytic flux at phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase (blue triangles), via
  a combinatory promoter screening approach (see the main text). Glc glucose, G6P
