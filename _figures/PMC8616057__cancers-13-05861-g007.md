caption: Working model for the opposite effects of MAPK and RAC1 signaling on NIS
  expression in thyroid cancer cells. Both NRAS- and BRAF-mutants are negative regulators
  of NIS expression and function; treatment with MEK1/2 inhibitor has a more meaningful
  positive impact in NRAS Q61R- than in BRAF V600E-expressing cells; NRAS, but not
  BRAF, stimulates RAC1 activity, which in turn, has a positive impact on NIS functional
  expression. The concerted action of MAPK pathway inhibition (which releases the
  repression of NIS transcription) and an increased RAC1 activity (which potentiates
  NIS expression and its plasma membrane abundance) could explain the better response
  to selumetinib treatment of thyroid tumors harboring NRAS-activating mutations over
  those carrying BRAF mutation (where NIS transcription is only partially rescued).
