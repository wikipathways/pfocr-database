caption: 'Example functional connectivity of a subgroup of CNS cholinergic neurons.
  Striatal cholinergic neurons (TANs) receive glutamatergic inputs from both cortex
  and intralaminar thalamus, as well as dopaminergic modulation from the substantia
  nigra pars compacta (SNc). Medium spiny neurons (MSNs), projection neurons in the
  striatum, express either type 1 or type 2 dopamine receptors (D1 or D2, respectively).
  Following thalamic stimulation, TANs generate a burst-pause pattern of activity
  that transiently and presynaptically inhibits thalamic and cortical excitation of
  D1 and D2 striatal MSNs through muscarinic receptor subtype M2 signaling. It also
  initiates a sustained, muscarinic receptor subtype M1-mediated facilitation of dendritic
  responsiveness in D2 MSNs: resulting in a bias of cortical and thalamic excitation
  toward D2 expressing, striatopallidal MSNs for the duration of the pause in TAN
  activity. The pause is dependent on dopaminergic signaling onto TANs. Functionally,
  thalamic excitation of TANs is thought to provide a window in which excitation of
  D2-expressing MSNs is enhanced, allowing for preferential recruitment of the striatopallidal
  pathway. Such wiring diagrams may serve as useful models to study subep-ChAT neuron
  connectivity. Distinct neuronal cell types and projection patterns are represented
  in different colors for clarity.'
