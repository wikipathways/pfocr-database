caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanisms underlying sugar degradation
  at sufficiently low glucose concentrations (low x), which leads to the appearances
  of the P2 shoulder/P2 doublet and P3 peak. Under such x-conditions, glucose is transported
  into the cell and degraded to produce the energy required for light emission in
  modes 1 and 2 (P1 and P2, respectively), as detailed in . In parallel, acetate originating
  from glucose breakdown is expelled from the cell. A low glucose concentration leads
  to a lower amount of non-phosphorylated EIIA proteins and thus to a lower inhibition
  of adenylate cyclase. The concentration level of cAMP thus increases, which allows
  for the formation of the cAMP/Crp complex and the activation of the simultaneous
  transcriptions of the acetate and xylose operons (albeit at different rates) necessary
  for their intracellular transport and degradation. Abbreviations: PE-P, phosphoenolpyruvate
  Glc-6P; Glucose 6-phosphate; EMP, Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway; PPP, the pentose
  phosphate pathway; AcCoA, acetyl CoA; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle; AC, adenylate
  cyclase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; Crp,
  cAMP receptor protein; ActP, cation/acetate symporter. The inset displays the time-dependent
  luminescence response corresponding to the molecular mechanisms highlighted in the
  scheme, with the P2 shoulder originating from the acetate that is metabolized by
  cells.'
