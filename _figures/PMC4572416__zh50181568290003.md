caption: 'Pathways to AT2 cell injury/dysfunction defined by using mutant proSP-C
  isoforms as prototype substrates. The expression of proSP-C mutants can produce
  1 of 2 profiles of aberrant cellular responses. Misfolding BRICHOS proSP-C (Group
  A1): ER stress marks the state in which the UPR can no longer maintain ER homeostasis
  because of overwhelming expression of misfolded SP-C, leading to a cascade of cellular
  disruption and injury: 1) Dysfunction of ERAD due to an overloaded and defective
  UPS. This event can be further exacerbated by second hits such as cigarette smoke
  and viruses. 2) ER stress-dependent recruitment of TRAF2 by IRE1 to activate JNK
  that promotes upregulation and release of cytokines. 3) Induction of apoptotic pathways
  by ER stress-induced activation of either the PERK/EIF2α/ATF4 network to trigger
  CHOP activation, IRE1/TRAF2 activation of caspase 4/12, and/or cytochrome c release
  from dysfunctional mitochondria. All 3 intersect downstream at the activation of
  caspase 3. 4) A failure of aggresomal compartmentalization or autophagy also contributes
  to the eventual accumulation of toxic macroaggregates. Mistrafficked Linker (non-BRICHOS)
  proSP-C (Group B): mutations in the COOH-terminus outside BRICHOS domain of proSP-C
  reported to date appear to be initially mistargeted to the plasma membrane via a
  constitutive pathway. Because of proper processing failure, proSP-C in the plasma
  membrane can be reinternalized and trafficked through early endosomes to late endosomes
  (LE)/MVB. The enhanced presence of aberrantly trafficked and misprocessed proSP-C
  in these compartments leads to a functional disruption of normal endosome/amphisome/lysosome
  turnover within the autophagic machinery that ultimately results in a distal block
  in autophagy. Such a block leads to the accumulation of abnormally large autophagic
  vacuoles containing undegraded, organellar, and proteinaceous debris populated with
  autophagy markers including LC3 and P62, as well as parkin, a protein critical for
  autophagy-dependent removal of dysfunctional mitochondria (i.e., mitophagy). *Potential
  sites for organelle disruption by the expression of mistrafficked proSP-C.'
