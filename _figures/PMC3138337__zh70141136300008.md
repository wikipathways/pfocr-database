caption: The cell growth and regulatory network formed by regulators whose targets
  were altered by hypoxia. The network was constructed by using Pathway Studio (version
  7.1, Ariadne Genomics). Shown here are the regulators that exhibit interactions
  and connections with other regulators or cell growth. Each line or arrow indicates
  a previously identified biochemical or genetic interaction. “+” indicates a positive
  effect, while a stop line indicates a negative effect.
