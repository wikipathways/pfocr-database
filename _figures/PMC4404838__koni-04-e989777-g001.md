caption: Mechanisms of TNFα-induced lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. Tumor cell-derived
  tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) directly acts on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)
  to induce their proliferation and migration through interaction with TNF receptor
  1 (TNFR1) receptor. In the tumor microenvironment, TNFα also recruits and activates
  macrophages that produce a high level of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C).
  Through activation of VEGFR3, VEGF-C induces LEC tip cell formation, which is an
  essential process guiding lymphatic development. Additionally, the VEGF-C-VEGFR3
  signaling pathway significantly contributes to LEC proliferation and migration.
  In primary tumors, the intimate interaction between TNFα-TNFR1 and VEGF-C-VEGFR3
  signaling pathways in macrophages and LECs leads to ingrowth of tumor lymphatics
  and lymph node metastasis.
