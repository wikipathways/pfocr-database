caption: 'A: The model of the EGFR signaling pathway contains 4 sub-pathways: MAPK
  pathway, PI3K-AKT pathway, Ca2+signaling pathway, PAK signaling pathway. B, C are
  parts of the model network visualized by PyBioS. B: The mRNA BAD-1 is produced by
  the transcription reaction (1) of gene BAD and also takes part in decay reaction
  (2) and translation-reaction (3), which produces the protein BAD-1 (cytoplasm).
  The protein BAD-1 takes part in further three reactions that are the decay-reaction
  (4), phosphorylation reaction (5) and dephosphorylation reaction (6). The phosphorylated
  protein P-AKT (plasma membrane) catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction, in which
  protein BAD-1 is phosphorylated into P-BAD-1. Afterwards, the protein P-BAD-1 is
  then dephosphorylated; C: shows a simplified miRNA biogenesis, target recognition
  and competitive anti-miRNA effect. (1) miRNA-gene transcription; (2) miRNA translocation
  (from nucleus into cytoplasm); (3) miRNA-binding-target reaction; (4) miRNA binds
  to the miRNA inhibitor.'
