caption: Working model of cell differentiation and nitrogen fixation by SUTN9-2 exposed
  to rice extract. The currently implied AMPs from rice plants are predictably recognized
  by BclA ABC transporters belonging to Sap ABC transporter family-like AMP recognition
  receptors. AMPs are targeted to the cell membrane of bradyrhizobia, localizing the
  BclA or Sap transporter, promoting the import of AMPs and providing protection against
  the antimicrobial activity of these peptides. AMPs affect master cell cycle regulators
  by reducing GcrA activity and the CtrA autoregulation pathway, but promoting DnaA
  and CcrM for the initiation of DNA replication, resulting in an increase in DNA
  content and enlarged cell size. A defect in flagellar activity during cell differentiation
  was observed. This was followed by increased nitrogen fixation activity, which correlated
  with an enlarged cell size. Excess oxygen perturbs the nitrogen regulatory protein
  NifA and reduces nitrogen fixation activity. Oxidoreductase may play a role in controlling
  oxygen to an appropriate level for nitrogenase activity. GroESL co-regulated with
  the nitrogen regulatory gene nifA and rpoN RNA polymerase for the formation of a
  functional nitrogenase. The successful colonization of bradyrhizobia in rice plants
  is triggered by the RND efflux system and induced rice nsHbs then regulate low oxygen
  partial pressure and facilitate nitrogen-fixing endophytic cells.
