caption: Regulatory mechanisms of cytokines in male sex determination in mice. SRY,
  the only sex-determining gene located on the Y chromosome, binds to GATA4 in a MAPK-dependent
  manner to facilitate its own on-time expression and cooperates with SF1 to promote
  SOX9 expression. Activated SOX9 induces SRY expression and forms a positive feedback
  pathway with WT1 and DMRT1 to promote further SOX9 expression. SOX9 promotes the
  expression of testis development-associated factors, including FGF9, AMH, SOX8,
  PTGDS, and PGD2, facilitating embryonic development into a male phenotype. MAPK,
