caption: 'Caprin-1 functions in normal and malignant cells. (a) Caprin-1 regulates
  RNA stability and translation in normal cells, promoting cell cycle progression
  through the expression of Cyclin D and c-myc. This facilitates the transition from
  the G1 phase to the S phase, driving cell proliferation. Under stress conditions,
  cytoplasmic Caprin-1 undergoes LLPS to form SGs, protecting cells from stress and
  supporting survival. (b) In malignant cells, overexpression of Caprin-1 promotes
  tumor growth, survival, and metastasis. Cytoplasmic Caprin-1 accumulates in SGs
  and sequesters pro-apoptotic factors, protecting cancer cells from stress-induced
  apoptosis and contributing to chemotherapy resistance. Furthermore, Caprin-1 activates
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting EMT, stemness, and metastatic potential.
  Cancer-specific membrane-expressed Caprin-1 has been reported in various cancers,
  identifying it as a novel and targetable molecule.Source: Created with BioRender.com.EMT,
