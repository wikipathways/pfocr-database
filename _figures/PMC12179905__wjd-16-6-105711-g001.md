caption: 'Pathways of apoptosis. A: Mitochondrial pathway: When the inside of the
  cell is stimulated, pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bak are activated and
  inserted into the mitochondrial membrane, increasing the permeability of the mitochondrial
  membrane and releasing cytochrome C into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome C combines with
  Apaf-1 to form an apoptosome, which recruits and activates Caspase-9, and then activates
  downstream effector caspases, leading to apoptosis; B: Death receptor pathway: Apoptotic
  signaling molecules outside the cell, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and FasL,
  bind to the death receptors on the cell surface to form a death-inducing signaling
  complex. After Caspase-8 is activated, it directly activates downstream effector
  caspases to trigger apoptosis. It can also activate the endogenous mitochondrial
  pathway by cleaving the Bid protein to amplify the apoptotic signal; C: Endoplasmic
  reticulum pathway: When the endoplasmic reticulum undergoes stress due to the accumulation
  of misfolded proteins, etc., it initiates the unfolded protein response. Through
  pathways such as the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway and the IRE1α pathway, it induces the
  expression of pro-apoptotic genes. At the same time, the endoplasmic reticulum releases
  calcium ions into the cytoplasm and activates relevant enzymes, such as Caspase-12,
  etc., ultimately inducing apoptosis. TNF: Tumor necrosis factor. It was drawn using
  Figdraw software'
