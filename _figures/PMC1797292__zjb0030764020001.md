caption: The activated methyl cycle, biosynthesis of AI-2, and directly coupled metabolic
  pathways in gram-positive bacteria. AI-2 is produced from SAM, which is essential
  for a large number of methylation processes and is used for polyamine synthesis,
  in three enzymatic steps. During various methyltransferase reactions, SAM is converted
  to SAH. SAH is detoxified by the Pfs enzyme to yield adenine and SRH. LuxS then
  catalyzes the conversion of SRH, yielding DPD and homocysteine. DPD undergoes spontaneous
  rearrangements to form AI-2. Homocysteine is used to recycle methionine. Methionine
  synthase is required by all organisms to ensure the regeneration of the methyl group
  of SAM. Most gram-positive bacteria contain a cobalamin-independent methionine synthase,
  MetE, and a YxjH enzyme, which is suggested to be an alternative cobalamin-independent
  methionine synthase that is mainly involved in the SAM recycling pathway. Methionine
  is then converted to SAM in a reaction catalyzed by SAM synthetase (MetK). Homocysteine
  can also be synthesized de novo from oxaloacetate in seven steps as part of the
  aspartate family. Notably, some organisms, such as L. plantarum and L. salivarius,
  can synthesize homocysteine from cysteine by direct sulfhydrylation involving the
  CysK enzyme. Homocysteine can also be converted to cysteine via the reverse transsulfuration
  pathway. The enzymes cystathionine β-lyase and cystathionine γ-synthase (encoded
  by metI and metC homologues) require pyridoxal-phosphate as cofactor. These complex
  branching pathways are coordinated by a variety of regulatory mechanisms, including
  multivalent feedback inhibition of enzyme activity by more than one end product,
  “metabolite-sensing” controllers of gene expression such as riboswitches and amino-acid-specific
  T boxes, and regulatory proteins. Moreover, the scheme presented here is simplified.
  For example, some gram-positive organisms can use alternative organic and inorganic
  sulfur sources, and some bacteria use O-succinylhomoserine instead of O-acetylhomoserine
  in the MetB-catalyzed reaction. Additionally, not all gram-positive bacteria contain
  the complete set of pathways. The common gene names for B. subtilis and E. coli
  are used. The pathway was constructed based on previously described data (, ), the
  KEGG PATHWAY website (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/map/map00271.html), and
  the LacplantCyc pathway genome database (). TCA, tricarboxylic acid; MTA, methylthioadenosine;
  MTR, methylthioribose; THF, tetrahydrofolate; THPG, tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate;
  dcSAM, decarboxylated SAM.
