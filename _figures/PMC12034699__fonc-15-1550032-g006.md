caption: Expression trends of each molecule associated with the interferon signaling
  pathway based on gene chip analysis The interferon signaling pathway was significantly
  activated. Red color indicates that the gene was significantly upregulated, and
  green color indicates that the gene was significantly downregulated in the experimental
  results (The main genes are marked in red)
