caption: The central panel shows a schematic representation of the oxygen-dependent
  metabolic modulation mechanism. Oxidative stress and increased pO2 during storage
  in AS-3 is expected (and previously observed) to trigger activation of the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP ON) to recycle oxidized glutathione (GSSG) back to the reduced
  form (GSH). However, this mechanism is progressively impaired during storage, and
  should be negatively affected by anaerobiosis,. On the other hand, anaerobiosis
  should slow Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions by removing oxygen, a key substrate
  for pro-oxidant reactions. No significant effect was observed in terms of redox
  homeostasis in response to anaerobiosis (either in presence or absence of CO2).
  Metabolic intermediates of the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway
  (see text) increased in response to total anaerobiosis (AN). Solid line=AN, Dotted
  line=AN[CO2], Dashed line=Control
