caption: Schematic representation of the pathophysiological processes that drive cyst
  formation and growth in renal tubular epithelial cells of the collecting duct in
  ADPKD and the mechanism of action of vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists and SST
  analogues. In ADPKD, the polycystin complex (formed by the proteins PC1 and PC2
  on the apical membrane) is dysfunctional, which leads to diminished calcium influx
  or diminished release of calcium from intracellular stores. Low intracellular calcium
  levels in turn stimulate activation of adenylate cyclase (AC), which converts adenosine
  triphosphate into cAMP. cAMP is an important player in several pathways that could
  possibly lead to cyst expansion. cAMP increases cell proliferation via protein kinase
  A and activation of the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway. Furthermore, cAMP activates apical-positioned
  chloride channels (CFTR channels), leading to fluid secretion into the cyst lumen.
  cAMP production can be inhibited by blocking the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R),
  which is coupled to G stimulatory (Gs) proteins that can activate AC. Activation
  of the SST receptor (SSTR) can inhibit cAMP production in a direct and indirect
  way. AC can be directly inhibited by the receptor-coupled G inhibitory (Gi) proteins.
  Activation of these Gi proteins can also activate calcium channels and stimulate
  intracellular release of calcium via phospholipase C, which can restore intracellular
  calcium stores. This leads indirectly to inhibition of cAMP production. Orange and
  grey lines indicate that the pathway is activated or inactivated, respectively.
