caption: Interaction network in haploids. Tpk1/3 exerts negative feedback on cAMP
  pathway, however their inhibition is not complete. Tpk1/3 functions positively to
  activate Ste12Tec1 along with Tpk2 thereby helping in MAPK signal amplification.
  Flo8 phosphorylation by Tpk2 is significant as compared to Tpk1/3 (Tpk2Flo8 >>>Tpk1/3flo8).
  Sfl1 phosphorylation (deactivation) strongly depends on Tpk2. Tpk1/3 has a very
  less role to play in terms of deactivating Sfl1 as compared to its role in phosphorylating
  Flo8 ( Tpk1/3Flo8 >>>Tpk1/3Sfl1). Tpk1/3 overexpression or a Δsfl1tpk2 mutation
  can demonstrate the positive effect because in the presence of Tpk2 their positive
  role is not observed. Similarly, Δtpk1/3 mutation can demonstrate the negative effect
  of Tpk1/3
