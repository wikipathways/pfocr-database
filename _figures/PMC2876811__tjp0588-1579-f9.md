caption: Stretch and/or angiotensin II (Ang II) through AT1 receptor stimulation triggers
  the release/formation of endothelin (ET). NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) probably play a significant role in this step of the signalling cascade.
  ET activates the ETA receptor and induces epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  transactivation. The communication between the ETA receptor and the EGFR involves
  matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activation and possibly the ROS-sensitive Src kinase.
  EGFR activation triggers an intracellular signalling pathway that leads to mKATP
  channel opening increasing ROS production and release through the mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore (MPTP). This causes ERK1/2 activation and NHE-1 phosphorylation
  at Ser703, increasing NHE-1 activity and intracellular Na+ concentration that favours
  intracellular Ca2+ accumulation through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). The increase
  in ROS production can also contribute to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ through
  a direct stimulatory effect on the NCX () and by increasing action potential duration
  ().
