caption: Stresses initiate oxidative stress that disrupts redox signaling-induced
  ROS. Excessive amount of ROS instigates impairment of DNA, Protein, and lipids,
  decline mitochondrial energy, and disrupt the antioxidant reserve of the body. These
  stresses are associated with various biochemical pathways such as Nrf2/keep1. These
  pathways recognize the mechanism for the ARE-regulated antioxidants gene transcription,
  and thus stimulates antioxidant enzymes, including SOD, CAT, and GPx. The figure
