caption: Major pathways for bile acid synthesis and metabolism in humans and mice.
  (A) The classical pathway for bile acid synthesis begins with cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
  (CYP7A1) and intermediates synthesized via this pathway are substrates for the sterol
  12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), which generates CA. The alternative pathway begins with
  sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and generates predominantly CDCA. In mice, CDCA
  and UDCA undergo 6β-hydroxylation by the cytochrome P450, Cyp2c70 to generate αMCA
  and βMCA. (B) In humans, bile acids in the liver are conjugated (n-acyl-amidated)
  with glycine (G) or taurine (T), whereas mice use almost exclusively taurine. (C)
  Primary bile acids are biotransformed by the gut microbiota. These reactions include
  deconjugation, which is catalyzed by bile salt hydrolases (BSH), epimerization to
  change the orientation of the hydroxyl groups on the steroid nucleus of the bile
  acids, and 7-dehydroxylation. (D) After returning to the liver, conjugated DCA can
  be rehydroxylated at the C-7 position to regenerate conjugated CA. This reaction
  occurs in mice and other species but is apparently absent in humans. (E) Bile acids
  undergo Phase 1 and Phase 2 metabolism, including additional hydroxylation, sulfation
  (sulfonation), and glucuronidation. In humans, sulfation of bile acids such as LCA
  is a primary pathway for their detoxification, whereas in mice hydroxylation plays
  a dominant role. The locations of these additional modifications to the bile acid
  structure are indicated.
