caption: (1) Prevention of Aβ formation and Amelioration of Aβ cytotoxicity. In the
  non-amyloidogenic pathway, α-secretase (α-sec) cleaves amyloid precursor protein
  (APP) within the Aβ domain, therefore precludes the formation of Aβ. In the amyloidogenic
  pathway, β-secretase (β-sec) and γ-secretase cleaves APP to produce Aβ. (2). Reduction
  of intracellular calcium overload. Increased calcium entered cells via the voltage-gated
  calcium channel currents (VGCC), resulting in calcium overload. (3) Regulation of
  Tau protein phosphorylation. In AD, there is a reduction in the ability of Tau to
  bind to tubulin and promote microtubule assembly. Hyperphosphorylated Tau contributes
  to the destabilization of microtubules and ultimately the formation of neurofibrillary
  tangle (NFT). (4) Increasing the activation of the cholinergic nervous system. Acetylcholine
  (ACh) is synthesized in the cytosol of cholinergic presynaptic neurons from choline
  and acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)
  and is then transferred into synaptic vesicles. In the synaptic cleft, ACh is rapidly
  hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), releasing acetate and choline.
