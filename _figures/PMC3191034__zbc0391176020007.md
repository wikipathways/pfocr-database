caption: Postulated model for GRTH negative autocrine molecular mechanism of regulation
  of androgen synthesis in Leydig cells. Steps 1–12 indicate the sequence of gonadotropic
  hormone stimulation of androgen synthesis through PKA-regulated StAR action and
  GRTH negative regulation (see below). Dotted arrows, multiple steps of cholesterol
  and steroidogenesis; AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; ?, not determined; bent arrow, transcriptional
  initiation. After gonadotropin binds to the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) at
  the cell surface of Leydig cells, cAMP-activated PKA type II (step 1) facilitates
  StAR mRNA tethering, protein synthesis (step 2a), and activation (phosphorylation;
  step 2b) in the vicinity of mitochondria (). In turn, StAR enhances the transfer
  of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane (step 3) to initiate pregnenolone
  synthesis (step 4) as the rate-limiting step for the consequent androgen production
  (step 5). Androgen transcriptionally activates GRTH gene expression through binding
  to the androgen receptor (AR; step 6) (, ). GRTH transport its own RNA message from
  the nucleus (step 7) to the cytosol to be translated at polysome sites (step 8)
  (). GRTH further associates with StAR mRNA as a GRTH-StAR mRNA complex (step 9)
  to enhance StAR message degradation presumably through the small RNA pathway system
  (step 10). This negative regulatory action of GRTH on the fate of StAR mRNA (step
  11) controls androgen homeostasis in the Leydig cell. In the absence of GRTH, increased
  HMGCR protein levels through a yet-to-be-identified mechanism increase de novo cholesterol
  synthesis (step 12) as a compensatory reaction to restore the intracellular cholesterol
  pool. The prolonged StAR mRNA half-life and enhanced protein levels facilitate cholesterol
  accumulation at the inner mitochondria and the increased androgen production observed
  in GRTH null mice upon gonadotropin stimulation.
