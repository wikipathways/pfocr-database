caption: A. In cells depleted of sterols, SCAP transports SREBP from the ER to the
  Golgi in COP II vesicles. In the Golgi, the luminal loop of SREBP is cleaved by
  S1P, separating its two transmembrane domains. In the Golgi, S2P cleaves the N-terminal
  fragment of SREBP in its transmembrane domain to liberate the bHLH leucine zipper
  domain, which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of genes involved
  in lipid synthesis and uptake. B. In unstressed cells, ATF6 is retained in the ER
  bound to the chaperone BiP. When unfolded proteins accumulate and bind to BiP, ATF6
  lacking BiP translocates to the Golgi complex where it is cleaved sequentially by
  the same two proteases, S1P and S2P, to release a fragment containing a bZip transcription
  factor domain. This fragment translocates to the nucleus and activates genes involved
  in the unfolded protein response pathway.
