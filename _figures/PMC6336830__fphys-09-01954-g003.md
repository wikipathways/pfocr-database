caption: Summary of the mechanisms involved in the stimulation of brown adipogenesis,
  mitochondrial biogenesis and energy expenditure by some dietary molecules. (a) The
  direct and/ or indirect (via AMPK) activation of SIRT1 induces deacetylation and
  interaction of key transcription factors promoting brown and beige adipogenesis
  as PPARα/γ and PRDM16. The PPAR/PRDM16 complex is also able to bind and activate
  PGC1α, another cofactor specifically expressed in brown and beige adipocytes that
  stimulates the transcription of several genes involved in thermogenesis and mitochondrial
  biogenesis. Similarly, AMPK can also directly enhance PGC1α activity by phosphorylation,
  thus increasing mitochondrial biogenesis. (b) TRPM8 activation in brown adipocytes
  enhances the expression of thermogenic genes via Ca2+-dependent PKA signaling pathway.
  (c) Activation TRPV1 receptors in GIT, and consequent stimulation of the vagal afferent
  pathways leads to activation of neurons within the ventromedial hypothalamus. This
  mechanism of action induces a cold-independent adrenergic response that mediates
  brown adipogenesis. The adrenergic stimulation in brown adipocytes can be also promoted
  by the reduction of degradation of (d) cAMP and (e) norepinephrine through direct
  inhibition of PDEs and COMT activity, respectively. TRPM8, transient receptor potential
