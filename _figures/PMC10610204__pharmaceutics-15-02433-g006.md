caption: The mechanism map of the synthetic lethality interaction between PRMT5 and
  MTAP (by Figdraw). (A) In normal cells, MTAP is active and able to convert MTA to
  SAM by methionine salvage pathway. SAM acts as a substrate for PRMT5 to form SDMA
  through methylation, and PRMT5 inhibitors can relatively reduce methylation. (B)
  In MTAP-mutant cancer cells, MTAP is inactivated and fails to catalyze MTA, causing
  excessive accumulation of MTA in the cells. At this time, MTA competes with the
  substrate SAM of PRMT5, inhibits the activity of PRMT5, and leads to increased sensitivity
  to PRMT5 depletion. If PRMT5 inhibitors are used, cell death will occur. The red
  arrow indicates that the reaction is activated. The grey arrow indicates that the
  reaction is inactivated.
