caption: Methionine metabolism. Methionine is metabolized to homocysteine, which is
  either (i) methylated back to methionine through the remethylation pathway or (ii)
  converted to cysteine through the trans-sulfuration pathway. The cysteine that is
  formed may be used for protein synthesis or formation of glutathione.
