caption: Proposed model of TCAP and GAPDH interaction, leading to increased cell survival
  during stress. (A) Under oxidative conditions, GAPDH undergoes NO-S-nitrosylation,
  where it can then bind to E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein complex transits to
  the nucleus, degrading nuclear proteins, resulting in apoptosis [modified from Hara
  et al. ()]. (B) A proposed TCAP interaction with GAPDH leading to the inhibition
  of GAPDH binding with E3 ubiquitin ligase, thus preventing its downstream apoptotic
  actions. The inhibition of this pathway supports increased cell survival under stress.
