caption: The alternative pathways and mechanisms bypass targeting EREG-mediated EGFR
  signal activation in colorectal cancer cells. (A) The expression of AREG and EREG
  are coordinately regulated by an autocrine loop through EGFR downstream signaling
  activation, which plays an important role in tumor growth and survival. The EGFR
  ligand binds to the EGFR and causes downstream signaling pathways that are essential
  for cell growth and proliferation. Cetuximab or panitumumab prevents the ligand
  from binding to EGFR, thereby blocking EGFR signaling. (B) Low AREG and EREG gene
  expression levels are associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. The low expression
  levels of AREG and EREG indicate that tumor progression is less dependent on EGFR
  activation; therefore, the cancer cells are particularly prone to less response
  to EGFR inhibitor treatment. (C) Aberrant genetic alterations, including RAS, BRAF,
  PIK3CA, EGFR S492R mutations, PTEN loss, and STAT3 phosphorylation in the EGFR signaling
  pathways induce resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. These constitutively activate the
  downstream signal cascade of EGFR leading to resistance to anti-EGFR therapy, regardless
  of EGFR blockade. (D) Aberrant activation of the alternative pathways can induce
  resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. EGFR downstream effectors can be activated by activating
  compensatory membrane growth factor receptors, including IGF-1R, MET, HER2 and VEGFR.
  The stimulation of the corresponding growth factors causes the intracellular signaling
  pathway to bypass EGFR and induce tumor cell growth and proliferation, leading to
  resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.
