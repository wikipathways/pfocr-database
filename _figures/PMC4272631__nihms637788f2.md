caption: Mod5/TRIT1 compete for DMAPP substrates with essential pathways. Aggregated
  Mod5 loses its ability to modify tRNAs and thus yeast that contain aggregated-Mod5
  draw less DMAPP out the ergosterol pathway and are better able to overcome fluconazole
  treatment (; ).
papertitle: The cytoplasmic and nuclear populations of the eukaryote tRNA-isopentenyl
  transferase have distinct functions with implications in human cancer.
