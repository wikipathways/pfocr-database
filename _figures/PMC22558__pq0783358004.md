caption: A model for the sequential development of the 5HT-activated signaling cascades
  in the tail sensory neurons. The subcellular pathway that links 5HT to modulation
  of excitability is fully expressed at the youngest stage of development that has
  been examined. Conversely, maturation of the subcellular pathway that links 5HT
  to spike broadening occurs through the final stage of juvenile development. For
  the effects of 5HT on excitability and spike duration in adult sensory neurons (C),
  the ionic currents that mediate these two forms of neuromodulation have been well
  characterized (IKS and IKV, respectively). Moreover, the second messenger systems
  that link the 5HT receptor to modulation of the ionic conductances have been characterized
  (PKA and PKC, respectively). Although we have not directly assayed identified ionic
  currents in juvenile sensory neurons, we hypothesize (indicated by question marks
  in A and B) that the modulation of ionic conductances underlying spike broadening
  and increased excitability are similar to those characterized in the adult. The
  posited developmental sequence of the pathway responsible for major spike broadening
  is illustrated in the three steps of the model. In the first step, the ionic conductance
  is expressed but cannot yet be modulated (A). In the second step, the conductance
  can be modulated by the second messenger but the second messenger cannot be activated
  by the neurotransmitter (B). In the final step, the neurotransmitter is now able
  to activate the second messenger and thereby complete the pathway (C).
