caption: Proposed mechanism of the immunomodulatory activity of Ligilactobacillus
  salivarius TUCO-L2 isolated from llama (Lama glama) milk in porcine intestinal epithelial
  (PIE) cells. PIE cells were stimulated with the TUCO-L2 strain and then challenged
  with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from enterotoxigenic Escherichia
  coli to induce the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 resulting in differential
  expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared to that in ETEC PAMPs-challenged
  control cells. The immunomodulatory effect of L. salivarius TUCO-L2 is mediated
  by the modulation of the negative regulators of the TLR signaling pathway.
