caption: GOLPH3, by binding to PI(4)P-enriched Golgi membranes and to MYO18A protein,
  mediates a linkage with the F-actin cytoskeleton that provides the tensile force
  necessary for Golgi architecture and vesicle trafficking. Golgi dispersal, in response
  to DNA damage, depends on the GOLPH3-MYO18A-F-actin pathway and the DNA damage protein
  kinase (PK) that phosphorylates GOLPH3 on T143 and T148. Several vesicle trafficking
  routes depend on GOLPH3 function. Human GOLPH3 also localizes to mitochondria and
  regulates total mitochondrial mass through mitochondrial lipid biogenesis. GOLPH3
  is required for anterograde vesicle trafficking from Golgi to plasma membrane. In
  addition this protein associates with Vps35 a subunit of the cargo-recognition complex
  of the retromer which regulates receptor recycling of several transmembrane receptors
  including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Thus GOLPH3 might function with Vps35
  and the retromer to regulate receptor recycling of key surface signals and affect
  downstream mTOR signaling, a pathway that is also sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction.
  GOLPH3 family proteins are also essential for normal glycosylation of glycoproteins
  at the Golgi, a process that has been associated with several biological processes
  that are relevant for cancer disease including cell migration and invasion, immune
  recognition and signal transduction. In this context, GOLPH3 regulates docking and
  localization of several Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases (GT).
