caption: Around stage I in the seminiferous cycle (shown in the upper panel), the
  MEK/ERK pathway, regulated by an unknown signal, is activated and promotes GDNF
  expression in Sertoli cells, which leads to activation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling
  in spermatogonial stem cells via RET/GFRα1 co-receptors. Intrinsic MEK/ERK signaling
  maintains the undifferentiated state of spermatogonial stem cells by inducing GFRα1/RET
  expression in addition to suppression of differentiation-associated gene expression.
  Concomitantly, PI3K/AKT signaling stimulates proliferation of spermatogonial stem
  cells as well as their differentiation. This weak induction of differentiation may
  be compensated by ERK1/2 signaling. Around stage VIII, RA restricts local availability
  of GDNF by decreasing GDNF expression in Sertoli cells. RA also directly promotes
  differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells by suppressing intrinsic factors essential
  for maintaining their undifferentiated state and activating differentiation-associated
  genes such as STRA8 and c-KIT. At this time, weak activation of PI3K/AKT signaling
  may also be required to induce differentiation.
