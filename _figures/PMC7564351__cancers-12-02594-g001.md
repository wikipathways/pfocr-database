caption: An overview of arginine/nitric oxide pathway. Metabolites are written in
  a straight script and enzymes in italics. Pathway components not determined in current
  study are marked in gray. Red color was used for inhibitory effects and a dashed
  line indicates weak impact. ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine; ARG, arginase; CATs,
  cationic amino acid transporter; DMA, dimethylamine; DDAH, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase;
  NOS, nitric oxide synthase; PM, plasma membrane; PRMT, protein methyltransferase.
