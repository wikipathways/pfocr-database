caption: 'The TGFβ, PI3K, NFκB, and WNT pathways are some of the most important pathways
  interacting with NOTCH. Notably, Jagged 1 is activated by TGFβ pathway and in turn
  activates NOTCH receptors in neighboring cells. Phosphorylation of NOTCH from the
  WNT-induced GSK3β leads to ubiquitination through FBXW7 and final degradation. Also,
  a classical NOTCH target, HES1, represses PTEN, a competitor of another pathway
  with oncogenic roles, PI3K, which in turn activates NFκB, a pathway important for
  leukemia progression. Important parameters of the interactions, such as regulation
  of NFκB pathway by NOTCH through HES1 action, or the interaction of NOTCH with the
  WNT member DVL (Dishevelled) protein that inhibits both WNT and NOTCH pathways are
  not shown in this figure. ICJ1: intracellular part of JAG1, ECJ1: extracellular
  part of JAG1.'
