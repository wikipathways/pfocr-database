caption: 'Signaling through the EP family of receptors. EP receptors belong to the
  family of GPCRs: (a) signaling through the EP1 receptor results in the activation
  of PKC and a higher concentration of intracellular Ca2+; (b) EP2 receptor signaling
  induces the production of cAMP and the activation of PKA; (c) EP3 is associated
  with different G proteins: depending on which Gα is associated with EP3, it can
  increase or decrease cAMP; and activate the Rho family ATPases; (d) EP4 and EP2
  share the same pathway of PKA activation when PGE2 binds to them. Unlike EP2, signaling
  through EP4 also stimulates non-canonical activation of the PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways.
