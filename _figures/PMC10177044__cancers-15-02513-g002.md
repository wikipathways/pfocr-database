caption: The ratio of p38 signaling to ERK determines whether cancer cells enter a
  dormant state or undergo proliferation. Various CAF-secreted factors can induce
  cancer cells to enter a dormant state, which is characterized by cell cycle arrest
  through upregulation of p21, as well as increased autophagy and inhibition of Wnt
  signaling. On the other hand, CAFs can secrete factors to promote the awakening
  of dormant cancer cells by restoring the cell cycle and promoting the Wnt signaling
  pathway. In addition, CAFs can promote the escape of dormant cancer cells through
  the synthesis and remodeling of the ECM. These processes promote cytoskeletal reorganization,
  β1 and α5β1 integrin signaling, stromal stiffness, and the adhesion of tumor cells
  to the ECM, ultimately leading to dormant cell escape. Some CAF-secreted factors,
  such as IL-6 and IGF-2, play a dual role.
