caption: The insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/IGF-1R signaling pathway in the development
  of liver disease. During the initiation of liver diseases caused by hepatitis virus
  infection, obesity, alcohol, or toxins, hepatocytes increase the release of inflammatory
  cytokines, such as IL -6. IL-6 can also be secreted by Kupffer cells after hepatitis
  B virus (HBV) infection, activating the IGF/IGF-1R signaling pathway. Released cytokines
  recruit TAMs and CAFs to the hepatocytes, leading to cirrhosis formation. IGF/IGF-1R
  signaling is activated following disease progression. Meanwhile, the levels of IGF-1,
  IGF-2, Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), and IGFBP proteases
  can change. Cirrhosis in the liver may develop into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
  In HCC, more TAMs and CAFs are recruited to the cancer microenvironment and hypoxia
  occurs in the liver. Furthermore, the expression of IGF-1, IGF-2, IGF-1R, and IL-6
  increase.
