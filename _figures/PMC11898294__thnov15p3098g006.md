caption: Enhanced CTL responses in TNBC via MUC1 mRNA nanovaccine and anti-CTLA-4
  therapy. Combined immunotherapy with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and MUC1 mRNA nanovaccines
  enhances anti-tumor immunity by promoting T cell activation and reducing immunosuppression
  in the TME. MUC1 nanovaccines are taken up by dendritic cells, leading to antigen
  presentation and robust CTL activation, amplified by CTLA-4 blockade. This increases
  CTL infiltration into tumors, triggering apoptosis. The therapy also reduces immunosuppressive
  cells such as Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, while upregulating pro-inflammatory
  cytokines like IFNγ. Additionally, STAT3 pathway inhibition suppresses tumor-supportive
  signals, further driving tumor cell death. In a 4T1 mouse model, this combined approach
  results in significant CTL-mediated tumor regression
