caption: Molecular targets for MS/SS in the near future would be CD158k, JAK, phosphoinositide-3-kinase
  (PI3K), the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and microRNAs. IPH4102, a humanized,
  monoclonal antibody against CD158k, can selectively and efficiently deplete primary
  Sézary cells through antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis.
  Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, and Tofacitinib, a JAK 1/3 inhibitor, exhibit anti-tumor
  effects in CTCL cell lines in vitro. Duvelisib, an oral drug that can inhibit both
  PI3K-δ and PI3K-γ, has both experimental and clinical activity. Everolimus, an oral
  agent that targets the mTOR pathway, has clinical effect on relapsed or refractory
  T cell lymphomas. PF-04691502 is a recently developed drug that can inhibit both
  mTOR and PI3K pathways. Cobomarsen, a locked nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotide
  inhibitor of miR-155, inhibits miR-155 expression, reduces cell survival signaling,
  decreases cell proliferation, and induces apoptosis.
