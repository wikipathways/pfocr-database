caption: Crosstalk of flavonoids with other signaling pathways under cold stress.
  This diagram illustrates the complex interactions between flavonoids and various
  signaling pathways that enhance plant cold resistance. A. Under cold stress, the
  synthesis of flavonoids is promoted, which in turn enhances the production of ABA
  and JA. There exists a reciprocal relationship where ABA and JA also promote flavonoid
  synthesis, creating a positive feedback loop that enhances plant cold resistance.
  B. The combined effects of UV stress, salt stress, and cold stress regulate the
  content of flavonoids, which plays a critical role in modulating plant chilling
  resistance. These environmental stresses synergistically influence flavonoid pathways,
  thereby impacting the plant’s ability to withstand cold conditions. C. Cold stress
  induces the production of flavonoids or the activation of calcium channels, which
  operate through the CBF (C-repeat binding factor) signaling pathway. This pathway
  regulates the expression of downstream cold-responsive (COR) genes, ultimately aiding
  the plant’s response to cold stress. This integrated model highlights the multifaceted
  roles of flavonoids in enhancing cold resistance through interactions with hormonal
  pathways (ABA and JA), response to multiple environmental stresses (UV and salt),
  and the regulation of stress-responsive gene expression via the CBF-COR signaling
  pathway. EBGs, flavonoid early biosynthetic genes; LBGs, flavonoid late biosynthetic
  genes; CBFs, C-repeat binding transcription factors; CORs, cold-responsive genes.
