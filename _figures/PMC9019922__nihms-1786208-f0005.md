caption: (a) DSP183-219 binds to integrin β6 and forms a complex, activating phosphorylation
  of p38, Erk1/2 and Smad1/5/8. Phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 interact with Smad4. The
  complex is translocated into the nucleus. Phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 in coordination
  with Smad4 bind to SBEs in the DSPP regulatory region and activate DSPP transcription.
  On the other hand, DSP363-458 as a ligand interacts with the extracellular loop2
  of Ocln194-241, stimulating Ocln phosphorylation at Ser490. Furthermore, the DSP-Ocln
  complex stimulates FAK phosphorylation at Ser722 and Tyr576 and then induces dental
  mesenchymal cell differentiation and mineralisation. (b) DPP binds to integrin α5β3
  through its RGD domain. DPP-α5β3 activates MAPK signal pathway and up-regulates
  gene expression and cell differentiation. The RGD domain of DPP phosphorylates paxillin
  and FAK at Tyr397. Phosphorylated FAK activates Erk and phosphorylated Erk is translocated
  into the nucleus and activates transcription factor Elk-1 and downstream gene expression.
  In addition, the DSS repeat region of DPP mediates intracellular calcium store flux
  and triggers CaMKII activation, resulting in Smad1/5/8 signalling cascade. DSS,
  Asp-Ser-Ser; RGD, Arg-Gly-Asp.
