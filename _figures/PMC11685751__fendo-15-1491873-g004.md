caption: Postulated mechanism of pseudo-Cushing syndrome in our patient. Abundant
  and chronic secretion of catecholamines leads to hypermetabolic and proinflammatory
  state that in turn activates HPA axis. Cortisol may potentiate the secretion of
  catecholamines by increasing the expression of thyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting
  enzyme in the catecholamine synthesis pathway; and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase,
  a key enzyme in noradrenaline-to-adrenaline conversion. A glucocorticoid-dependent
  positive-feedback loop may potentiate ACTH release. Created with BioRender
