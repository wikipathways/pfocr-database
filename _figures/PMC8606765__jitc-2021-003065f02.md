caption: Classical TLR signaling pathways in human innate immune cells. TLR molecules
  can signal through MyD88-dependent and independent pathways. In the MyD88-dependent
  pathway, activation of proinflammatory transcription factors AP1 and NF-kB is induced
  via IRAK1/4, TRAF6 and TAK1. In the MyD88-independent pathway, the adaptor molecule
  TRIF initiates signaling via TRAF3 and IRF, also resulting in the induction of proinflammatory
  gene transcription. AP1, activator protein 1; IRAK, IL-1R-associated kinase; IRF,
  interferon-regulatory factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MyD88, myeloid Differentiation
  Primary Response 88; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa B; TAK1, transforming growth factor-β-activated
  kinase-1; TIRAP, toll-IL 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein; TLR, toll-like
  receptor; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-activated factor; TRAM, TRIF-related
  adaptor molecule; TRIF, toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β.
