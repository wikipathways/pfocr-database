caption: CircRNAs mediate drug resistance of NSCLC (A) circRNAs function as miRNA
  sponges to mediate drug resistance. (B) circRNAs govern drug sensitivity as the
  sponges of RBPs. (C) circRNAs mediate drug resistance through a signaling pathway.
  (D) circRNAs control drug resistance by inhibiting T cells. (E) circRNAs regulate
  autophagy derived proteins to mediate drug resistance. (F) circRNAs control drug
  resistance by curbing glycolysis. The meaning of "→" is "promote", and "T" is "inhibit".
