caption: Descriptive mechanism of action of ASP. Mice consuming either a standard
  chow diet or HFD received 3 mg of ASP daily for 12 weeks. We hypothesize that ASP
  prevented weight gain in mice consuming HFD by altering nutrient-sensing mechanisms
  of the taste buds that are involved in the homeostatic and hedonic regulation of
  food intake (, , , , , ). In the taste buds, gustatory Type II cells express the
  plasma membrane receptor CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36), a receptor participating
  in the orosesory detection of dietary lipids (). Type II cells also express the
  free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1) and free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4) which
  mediate orosensory responses to long and short-chain fatty acid respectively ().
  They also express subfamilies of the taste receptor type 1 (TAS1R) which detect
  sweet, bitter, and the umami taste (). The endocannabinoid system is also involved
  in the orosensory detection of dietary fatty acids (). This physiological function
  is mediated by the activity of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) () which additionally
  plays a major role in the enhancement of the sweet taste (). When ASP was administered
  in mice consuming HFD, levels of CB1R, sweet (TAS1R2 and TAS1R3) and fat (CD36,
  FFAR1, and FFAR4) receptors were nearly doubled. FFAR1-4 and TAS1R2-3- are coupled
  to the G-protein α-gustducin (G-α-gus) which activates phospholipase C-β2 to promote
  the formation of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and the final release of intracellular
  Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (, , ). Similarly, when dietary lipids
  bind to CD36, this will ultimately result in the rise IP3 (). The binding of IP3
  to ER will release free Ca2+, followed by Ca2+ efflux (). The increase in intracellular
  Ca2+ activates the transient receptor potential cation channel M5 (TRPM5) and then
  the voltage-gated Na+ channels allowing the entrance of Na+ ions and the outward
  current of K+ ions, inducing membrane depolarisation as well as ATP release (, ).
  At the same time, neurotransmitters and peptides involved in the regulation of food
  intake including NPY, ghrelin, and leptin are released to modulate autocrine and
  paracrine signaling within the taste bud itself and with afferent sensory nerves
  (, ). In response to taste stimulation, ATP release is increased into the cranial
  nerves VII and/or X and this elicits a greater afferent nutrient-sensing signal
  to the brain (, , , , , ). Taste signaling increases cortical activity in the mesolimbic
  pathway (regions of the brain associated with hedonic responses) which in turn send
  chemical signals to the hypothalamus for the regulation of food intake (, ). In
  the hypothalamus of mice consuming HFD, ASP downregulated the gene expression of
  appetite regulators including ghrelin, POMC, leptin, and CB1R (, , ). We hypothesize
  that ASP overstimulates taste buds signaling in response to high fat diet consumption
  leading to suppression of orexigenic signaling in the hypothalamus (, , , , ).
