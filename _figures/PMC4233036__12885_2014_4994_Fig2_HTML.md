caption: Pathway analysis highlights opposing regulation of a DNA repair pathway in
  radioresistant versus radiosensitive cells. Gene lists determined by RNA-seq for
  the (A) PC-3 and (B) LNCaP cell lines 24 hours after 2 Gy irradiation were analysed
  using IPA. DNA repair pathways were identified as being significantly altered in
  response to RT (q-value 1x10−10). Significantly up-regulated genes are coloured
  red and down-regulated green, those present within our data set but not significant
  are shown in grey. Significant genes were defined as reporting a log2 fold change
  >1 and a q-value <0.05. Arrows indicate gene products which were found to be oppositely
  regulated.
