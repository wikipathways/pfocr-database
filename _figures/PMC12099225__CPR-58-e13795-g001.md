caption: Mechanisms of MSC‐Exos in the treatment of age‐related diseases. A Immunomodulatory
  and anti‐inflammatory, MSC‐Exos mediate immunomodulatory and anti‐inflammatory effects
  by regulating the polarisation of T cells and macrophages, promoting an anti‐inflammatory
  state while inhibiting pro‐inflammatory responses; B Suppression of oxidative stress,
  MSC‐Exos mitigate oxidative stress by activating cellular antioxidant defence mechanisms,
  including NRF2/ARE signalling pathway. Through the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes
  (e.g., SOD, GPx), MSC‐Exos facilitate the reduction of ROS and prevent autophagy
  oxidative DNA damage, thereby inhibiting pathways associated with tumour progression
  and cellular senescence; C Promotion of cell migration and proliferation, MSC‐Exos
  activate the PI3K/AKt/mTOR signalling pathways by PTEN to promotion protein synthesis,
  cell growth, and cell proliferation;D Remodelling of the aging microenvironment,
  MSC‐Exos regulate the aging microenvironment by modulating the expression of inflammatory
  and anti‐inflammatory factors within the SASP. Through the suppression of pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines and growth factors, MSC‐Exos alleviate age‐related inflammation and mitigate
  cellular aging processes that are exacerbated under stress conditions
