caption: Overview of different pathomechanisms linking DM and AD. Amyloid beta oligomers
  and ApoE mutation causes dysregulation of downstream insulin signaling pathway resulting
  in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, AGE expression and inflammation.
  Cross-seeding of Aβ oligomers between the pancreas and the brain promotes cellular
  dysfunction in both T2DM and AD. Aβ oligomers and ApoE protein blocks insulin receptors
  resulting in impairment of PI3K and Akt pathways and activates microglia mediated
  JNK downstream pathway. Further, dysregulation of insulin signaling pathway enhances
  Aβ production due to translation of BACE and APP, increases GSK-3β phosphorylation
  resulting in NFT formation and neuronal death. In addition, Aβ oligomers are degraded
  by lysosomal pathway. However, ApoE mutation impairs lysosomal degradation resulting
  in intracellular accumulation of Aβ and cell death.
