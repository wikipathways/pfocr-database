caption: Effect on protein ubiquitination signaling pathway in plasma of total mRNAs
  obtained from δ-tocotrienol treatment of hepatitis C patients. The protein ubiquitination
  pathway was down-regulated by δ-tocotrienol treatment. It plays a major role in
  the degradation of regulatory proteins, including a variety of cellular processes,
  such as cell cycle, cell proliferation, DNA repair, apoptosis, transcription regulation,
  cell surface receptors, ion channel regulation and antigen presentation

  ubiquitination through multiple-signaling pathways in chronic hepatitis C patients.
