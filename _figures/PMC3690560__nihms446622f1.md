caption: Schematic of the possible mechanistic roles of platelets in cancer metastasis.
  1) Active platelets can promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells
  by secretion of TGFβ and activation of TGFβ/Smad and NF-kB pathways, 2) Active platelets
  can secrete pro-angiogenic cytokines (e.g. VEGF-A, PDGF etc) and proteases (e.g.
  MMP-2, MMP-9 etc) to influence tumor vascularization, matrix and basement membrane
  degradation, cancer cell migration and intravasation, 3) Following intravasation,
  tumor cells can induce further platelet activation (e.g. via tissue factor pathway)
  and aggregation around themselves to form a ‘platelet cloak’ to stay protected from
  immune surveillance in circulation, 4) Active platelets can facilitate the arrest
  of circulating tumor cells under dynamic blood flow conditions with the assist of
  leukocytes onto the vascular wall at secondary sites, and mediate endothelial retraction,
  matrix degradation and extravasation, and 5) Active platelet secretome and platelet-mediated
  recruitment of leukocytes can regulate inflammation, matrix remodeling and angiogenesis
  to promote metastatic microenvironment.
