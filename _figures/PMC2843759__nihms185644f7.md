caption: Production of both 10-deoxymethynolide 2 and narbonolide 3 by the pikromycin
  PKS system requires that PikAIII and PikAIV engage in their docking domain mediated
  protein-protein interaction. Subsequent to this interaction, the hexaketide intermediate
  can follow one of two paths. As shown in path A, the hexaketide intermediate that
  extends from the ACP domain of PikAIII can be offloaded and cyclized to 10-deoxymethynolide
  2 by the terminal TE domain of PikAIV. Alternatively, the hexaketide intermediate
  can follow path B, in which it is transferred from the ACP domain of PikAIII to
  the KS domain of PikAIV. The hexaketide intermediate then undergoes an additional
  round of elongation and β-keto processing prior to being offloaded and cyclized
  by the TE domain to give narbonolide 3.
