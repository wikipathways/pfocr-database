caption: Phenotypic characteristics of pro- versus anti-inflammatory macrophages.
  Pro-inflammatory stimuli (like TLR ligands or pro-inflammatory cytokines) will generate
  a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages, notably characterized by the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and a
  Th1 response. On the other hand, anti-inflammatory stimuli (like IL4, IL13 or IL10)
  will promote a pro-repair phenotype in macrophages notably caracterized by the production
  of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolutive factors and the generation of a Th2 response.
  In the context of infection, the generation of pro-inflammatory macrophages will
  promote their killing activity but microbes will try to promote the generation of
  anti-inflammatory phenotype to escape these responses. Anti-inflammatory macrophages,
  while promoting infections in general, will have a strong anti-helminth effect.
  Metabolically, the pro-inflammatory macrophages use glycolysis and PPP to produce
  energy and have a broken TCA cycle. Instead, anti-inflammatory macrophages use the
  FAO and OXPHOS to provide cellular energy. FAO, Fatty acid oxidation; IFN, Interferon;
