caption: Diagram of androgen production and subsequent signaling through the androgen
  receptor. Testosterone (T) is produced in the testes and adrenal glands. Testosterone
  is then converted to its most common and active metabolite, dihydrotestosterone
  (DHT) by 5α-reductase. Androgens, usually DHT, bind to the androgen receptor (AR),
  dissociating chaperone proteins, members of the heat shock protein family HSP27
  and HSP70. Ligand-bound AR molecules homodimerize and translocate to the nucleus
  where they bind to androgen response elements (ARE), and act as transcription factors
  to signal downstream targets. Second-generation antiandrogens are illustrated at
  their points of pathway disruption; Abiraterone acetate prevents androgen biosynthesis,
  and Enzalutamide, Apalutamide and Darolutamide prevent AR translocation to the nucleus.
