caption: Schematic representation of the exosome release pathway and the proposed
  activation of the immune response by exosomal Hsp70. (1) Extracellular molecules
  or membrane proteins are internalized into the endosomes that form intra-luminal
  vesicles by the inward budding of their limiting membrane. (2) Under certain conditions,
  these MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane releasing their ILVs to the outside where
  they are known as exosomes. (3) Exosomes exhibit the same orientation of their membrane
  proteins as on the plasma membrane with extracellular domain of the protein present
  on the exosomal surface. (4) Exosomes that are Hsp70-positive can interact with
  TLRs on the cell surface (5) thus activating NF-⊠B signaling pathway.
