caption: Targeted therapy in extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. Rituximab targets
  CD20-positive B lymphoma cells, which results in anti-tumor effects related to complement-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Upstream of
  the NF-κB pathway, different types of inhibitors may target key enzymes that are
  activated downstream of BCR signaling or affected by genetic alterations (BIRC3-MALT1
  translocation, BCL10 and MYD88 mutations [*]). These include BTK inhibitor inbrutinib
  and MALT inhibitors. BCR stimulation also activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that
  can be targeted by PI3K inhibitors and mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Activation of
  NF-κB itself, which may also result by loss of TNFAIP3 function due to gene deletions
  or mutations [*], can be blocked by bortezomib. Lenalidomide promotes degradation
  of IKZF1 and IKZF3, thereby downregulating the expression of MYC and IRF4. Transcription
  factors FOXP1 and BCL6, which are upregulated by genetic alterations (e.g., chromosomal
  translocations, promoter mutations), as well as other epigenetic regulators that
  require HDAC activity, can be blocked by the action of HDAC inhibitors
