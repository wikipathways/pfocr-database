caption: 'Plants have two pathways for SA production, the isochorismate (IC) pathway
  and the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) pathway. Enzymes involved in SA biosynthesis
  are abbreviated as follows: AAO aldehyde oxidase, BA2H benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase,
  CM chorismate mutase, ICS isochorismate synthase, IPL isochorismate pyruvate lyase,
  and PAL phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. Question marks indicate that the enzyme responsible
  for the indicated conversion has not yet been definitively identified'
papertitle: How does the multifaceted plant hormone salicylic acid combat disease
  in plants and are similar mechanisms utilized in humans?.
