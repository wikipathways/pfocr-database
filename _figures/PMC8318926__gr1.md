caption: Liver sinusoidal cell dysfunction in liver pathogenesis.Normal LSEC function
  is necessary for liver homeostasis. Various aetiologies can cause LSECs to become
  dysfunctional, leading to disease progression. Capillarisation is the loss of fenestrae
  and appearance of a basement membrane in LSECs. eNOS-derived NO plays a pivotal
  role in liver homeostasis by regulating vascular tone, maintaining fenestrae, maintaining
  HSCs in a quiescent state and blocking platelet attachments to endothelial cells
  among other functions. LSEC dysfunction often precedes pathological events, including
  inflammation, NET formation, microvascular thrombosis, parenchymal extinction (regions
  of tissue loss and fibrosis secondary to vascular obstruction and microvascular
  thrombosis), hepatocyte injury and fibrosis, leading to the development of portal
  hypertension. By contrast, in HSCs, calcium-independent contraction is mainly regulated
  by MLCP, which is inhibited by the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway and activated by the
  NO/PKG-pathway. CXCL1, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1; HSCs, hepatic stellate
  cells; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; LSECs, liver sinusoidal endothelial
  cells; MLCP, myosin light-chain phosphatase; NO, nitric oxide; NET, neutrophil extracellular
