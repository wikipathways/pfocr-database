caption: DNA sensors and related signaling pathway. TLR9 recognizes CpG DNA in the
  endosome and recruits MyD88 to activate IRF7 and NF-κB, leading to induction of
  type I interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines. AT-rich double-stranded DNA
  (dsDNA) is transcribed by RNA Pol III into 5ʹ-triphosphate double-stranded RNA (5ʹ-ppp-dsRNA),
  which in turn activates the RIG-I–MAVS pathway. DNA from viruses or bacteria could
  be detected by cGAS and potentially also by other putative DNA sensors, which are
  all proposed to activate the endoplasmic reticulum–resident adaptor protein STING.
  STING translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi to activate TBK1-IRF3
  and NF-κB, resulting in robust type I IFN induction and inflammatory cytokine production.
  Detection of DNA by IFI16 and AIM2 in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, activates
  the inflammasome via recruitment of ASC and caspase-1, leading to proteolytic cleavage
  of pro-IL1β and pro-IL18.
