caption: 'Potential Mechanisms for Microbiota-Mediated Immunomodulation in Tumor (see
  attached file). Gut microflora can exert an impact on tumor immunity both locally
  and systemically. Locally, Fusobacterium may act on CRC cells via TLR4/MYD88 signaling
  pathway. The activation of NF-kB promoted the transcription of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, leading to the accumulation of immunosuppressive
  myeloid cells in TME. Systemically, bacterial flagellin accelerated distal malignant
  progression via TLR5 signaling, resulting in increased systemic IL-6 and subsequent
  more γδT cells to produce immunosuppressive galectin-1. Furthermore, the enterohepatic
  circulation enabled microbiota-derived PAMP and metabolites to play a role in HCC.
  On one hand, in the context of HCC, there is a significant increase in portal and
  systemic LPS, owing to dysbiosis and increased gut permeability. Elevated LPS activated
  NF-κB in HSC, inducing production of inflammatory chemokines. These cytokines could
  enhance migration of macrophages and MDSCs to the liver. Similarly, gut-derived
  LTA induced the expression of COX2 to promote local production of PGE2. Then PGE2
  suppressed the antitumor response through the PTGER4 receptor on immune cells, manifested
  as decreased production of IFN-γ and TNF-α, reduced CD103+DC and increased CD4+FOXP3+Treg.
  On the other hand, depletion of gram-positive bacteria involved in primary-to-secondary
  bile acid conversion increased the expression of CXCL16. Upregulation of CXCL16
  induced accumulation and activation of CXCR6+NKT cells, which suppressed liver tumor
  growth. In addition, intestinal microbiota could also control the immune tone of
  secondary lymphoid organs via bacterial translocation. The translocation of selected
  Gram-positive bacterial species into spleen is indispensable for CTX-driven accumulation
  of pTh17 cells, which increased systemic CD8+T cells and intratumoral CTL/Treg ratio.
