caption: Notch signaling is activated by proteolytic cleavages followed by the release
  and translocation of Notch intracellular domain to the nucleus where it acts on
  downstream targets by binding the transcription factor CSL to activate Hes/Hey family
  genes which are involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival.
