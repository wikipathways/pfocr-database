caption: Overview of NO and nitrite-mediated signaling pathways in the vasculature.
  Dashed arrows depict multistep signaling processes. (1) eNOS generates NO in the
  endothelium using l-arginine (l-Arg) and O2. (2) NO freely diffuses through cellular
  membranes into neighboring smooth muscle cells and binds sGC. (3) Activation of
  sGC results in the conversion of GTP to the second messenger cGMP. (4) cGMP binds
  to and activates PKG-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells, and PKG-1 subsequently phosphorylates
  downstream targets to regulate physiological processes, such as smooth muscle relaxation
  (i.e., vasorelaxation). (5) Inorganic nitrite acts as a stable NO reservoir. At
  low O2 tensions in the vasculature or under conditions of pathophysiological hypoxia,
  ferrous deoxyHb reduces nitrite to generate an equivalent of NO and ferric (met)Hb.,,,
  Multiple hemoprotein-facilitated reactions regulate NO signaling and prevent overstimulation.,,,
  (6) The multicopper-containing enzyme ceruloplasmin, found in the plasma, readily
  oxidizes NO to nitrite, while (7) oxyHb (and other O2-bound hemoproteins) rapidly
  oxidize NO to nitrate in a process called NO dioxygenation. (8) Nitrate can be carried
  throughout the plasma and concentrated in the salivary glands, where nitrate is
  secreted and metabolized by commensurate bacteria back to nitrite., Taken together,
  these processes (5–8) are collectively part of the nitrate–nitrite–NO pathway, a
  complementary, O2-independent route to NO. (9) eNOS is also found in RBCs and platelets,
  which contribute to regulation of the vascular tone.– (10) NO, derived from eNOS
  and/or nitrite reduction, inhibits platelet activation via the canonical sGC pathway.–
  (11) Nitrite may increase H2O2 levels by directly inhibiting catalase or reacting
  with hemoproteins under O2-replete conditions to generate H2O2.– (12) Some evidence
  suggests that nitrite may therefore also regulate the vascular tone in a NO–sGC–cGMP-independent
  fashion in mesenteric resistance vessels by facilitating oxidative activation of
  PKG-1. More details regarding each of these pathways can be found in the main body
  of the text.
