caption: Schematic of a proposed mechanism for the interaction of IRAK3 and cGMP to
  modulate inflammatory cytokine production in TLR4/IL1R signalling pathway. Activation
  of TLR4/IL1R by endotoxins such as LPS (indicated by stars) leads to the formation
  of myddosome complexes comprising MyD88, IRAK4 and IRAK1/IRAK2, then activates TRAF6,
  that transduces the signal to degrade IκBα (an NFκB inhibitor) and trigger nuclear
  translocation of the transcription factor NFκB containing p50 and RelA subunits.
  NFκB induces the transcription of inflammatory genes (TNF-α and IL-6), consequently
  leading to cytokine production. IRAK3 generates cGMP to create a nanoenvironment
  surrounding its protein interactome and inhibits the association of IRAK1 or 2 with
  TRAF6, thus suppressing the downstream cascade. Sub-nanomolar levels of cellular
  cGMP directly added via membrane permeable cGMP (mp-cGMP) or pharmacologically modulated
  using DEA NONOate (NO donor) or ODQ (a soluble GC inhibitor), lead to changes in
  NFκB activity and cytokine production. NO released from NO donor also stabilizes
  IκBα by inhibiting its degradation from NFκB, causing reduced NFκB activity [].
