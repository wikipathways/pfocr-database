caption: Schematic representation of the four different metabolite networks analyzed
  in this report. The positions of the different amino acids in the different networks
  are marked with boxes. Biosynthetic/allosteric, biosynthetic/nonallosteric, and
  catabolic enzymatic steps are indicated by double-headed, black, and white-headed
  arrows, respectively, while enzymatic steps with no known genes are indicated by
  gray arrows. Numbers near each arrow refer to enzyme names provided in . A, The
  network of Lys, Met, and Thr metabolism, composed of three pathways (from Asp to
  Lys, from Asp to Met, and from Asp to Thr). B, The network of Ile, Leu, and Val
  metabolism, composed of three pathways (from Thr to Ile, from pyruvate to Val, and
  from pyruvate to Leu), which were analyzed together (as one pathway). C, The network
  of Trp, Phe, and Tyr metabolism, composed of tree pathways (from chorismate to Trp,
  from chorismate to Phe, and from chorismate to Tyr), from which the pathways leading
  to Phe and Tyr were analyzed together (as one pathway). D, The network of Pro and
  Arg metabolism, composed of two pathways (from Glu and Orn to Pro and from Glu and
  Orn to Arg), which were analyzed together (as one pathway). The reasons for the
  definition and joining of the different pathways are explained in the text. Dotted
  lines ending with a bar sign represent feedback inhibition loops.
