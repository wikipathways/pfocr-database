caption: LRP-1 may affect angiogenesis through TGF-β signaling and the plasminogen/plasmin
  system modulation. (A) Colored heatmap generated from proteomics analysis data using
  the ggplot2 R package reflecting LRP-1’s influence in 24 h shLRP-1 and shCtrl MDA-MB-231
  TCM. Comparison of proteomics profiles between shLRP-1 and shCtrl triplicate. Logarithmic
  scale of fold change from 1.5 to –1.5. (B) Representative pathway of LRP-1 modulations
  in MDA-MB-231 secretome. Among selective known genes linked to cancer progression
  and/or angiogenesis, protein–protein interactions were mapped using Ingenuity Pathways
  Analysis. TGF-β signaling (governed by TGF-β1, on the left) and the plasminogen/plasmin
  system (represented by PLG/PLAT, on the right) stand out for their privileged place
  within these multiple interactions organized around LRP-1.
