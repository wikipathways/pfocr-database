caption: 100 frequent associations obtained after p value cut off in BLCA with CDCOCA.
  Pathway associations for presumptive target genes from the 100 most frequent associations
  in BLCA obtained after p value cut-off are shown. TGF-beta signaling genes (blue
  triangles) and genes from cellular apoptotic pathways (red triangles) present in
  these genetic locations are displayed. Gains are represented with prefix "g" and
  green color circles whereas losses with prefix "l" and orange circles. Associations
  were drawn using cytoscape [].
