caption: VEGF/VEGFR signaling controls angiogenesis and vascular permeability. a Role
  of VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway in angiogenesis. (1) The vascular stability of quiescent
  microvessels covered by pericytes and basement membrane (BM) is maintained by non-VEGF/VEGFR
  signaling pathways such as Ang/TIE signaling. (2) Upon VEGF ligand stimulation,
  the BM degrades and releases bio-unavailable VEGF ligands. Endothelial cells (ECs)
  lose structural support and key adhesion molecules such as VE-cadherin and undergo
  tip cell selection. (3) VEGF signaling strongly induces the tip cell phenotype and
  metabolic characteristics, providing guidance cue for tip cells, whereas VEGFR2
  and VEGFR3 are highly expressed in tip cells. Tip cells inhibit VEGFR2 and VEGFR3
  and increase VEGFR1 and sVEGFR1 in stalk cells. VEGF supports perpendicular proliferation
  of stalk cells and lumen formation. (4) Tip cells recognize each other and induce
  sprout anastomosis. sVEGFR1, possibly produced by macrophages, regulates this process.
  VEGF negatively regulates vessel maturation. b Role of VEGF/VEGFR signaling in vascular
  permeability. The vascular permeability of quiescent microvessels is maintained
  by pores in ECs, glycocalyx, and EC junctions. VEGFR2 Y949 phosphosite in mice downregulates
  VE-cadherin via SRC. VEGFR2 also promotes nitric oxide (NO) production to reduce
  the expression of adhesion molecules required for paracellular permeability. VEGF
  has also been shown to stimulate vesicovacuolar organelles (VVO) and fenestrae formation
  for transcellular permeability. However, whether the glycocalyx can be cleaved by
  VEGF stimulation is not fully understood. Created in BioRendender.com
