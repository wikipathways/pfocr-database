caption: TLR signaling is mediated by the MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathway.
  MyD88-dependent pathway is utilized by all TLRs except TLR3 and is initiated by
  association of MyD88 with the TLRs, followed by subsequent recruitment and activation
  of IRAKs, TRAF6 and other signaling molecules to the cytoplasm membrane. The pathway
  leads to activation of IKK and nuclear translocation of NFκB to induce expression
  of its target genes such as IL-12 and TNFα. The TRIF-dependent pathway is utilized
  by TLR3 and TLR4 and activates IRF3 (IFN-regulatory factor 3) and transcription
  of IFNα and co-stimulatory molecules. GSK3α is critical for proinflammatory cytokine
  production induced by TLRs by promoting NFκB-CBP association. The PI3K-Akt pathway
  can inhibit TLR-induced proinflammatory cytokine production by phosphorylating and
  deactivating GSK3α. TAK1, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1; TBK1,
  TRAF family member associated NFκB activator-binding kinase 1.
