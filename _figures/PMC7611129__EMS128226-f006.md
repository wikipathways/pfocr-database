caption: '(a) Steps involved in the metabolic labeling of nascent RNA with AMU. Since
  AMU is not metabolically incorporated into RNA, the corresponding triphosphate (AMUTP)
  is transfected using 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP), which is
  then efficiently incorporated into nascent RNA by endogenous RNA polymerases., Other
  transfection agents like Lipofectamine did not work well as compared to DOTAP. Alternatively,
  an engineered UCK2 enzyme involved in the pyrimidine salvage pathway readily assists
  in metabolic incorporation of AMU into RNA. (b) Tyrosine residue (Y65) in the active
  site hinders the C5 position of the substrate analog of UTP (PDB: 1UEI).'
