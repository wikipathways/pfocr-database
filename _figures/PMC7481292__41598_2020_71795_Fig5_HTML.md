caption: 'Summary of effects of TCDD on OCM gene expression and metabolites. (a) OCM
  pathway schematic depicting dose response effects of TCDD on gene expression (green
  rectangles labelled A–H) and metabolite levels (black rounded rectangles labelled
  1–11) in male C57BL/6 mice at 28 days repeated TCDD exposure. Gene expression and
  metabolite levels were determined by RNA-seq or LC–MS/MS, respectively. Homocysteine
  levels were not determined (N.D.). The Log2(fold change) range is denoted on left
  y-axis of each box and the bar colors represents red as induced and blue as repressed.
  (b) OCM pathway schematic depicting changes in gene expression and metabolite levels
  in male C57BL/6 mice orally gavaged with sesame oil vehicle or 30 µg/kg TCDD every
  4 days for 28 days. Inhibition or activation of enzymes in pathway are indicated
  by grey dashed lines. Changes in genes expression and metabolite levels were determined
  by RNA-seq or LC–MS/MS, respectively. Green boxes represent genes and black circles
  represent metabolites. The Log2(fold change) represents red as induced and blue
  as repressed. Official gene name and symbol: (a) Mat1a S-adenosylmethionine synthase
  isoform 1a, (b) Mat2a S-adenosylmethionine synthase isoform 2a, (c) Gnmt glycine
  N-methyltransferase, (d) Sardh sarcosine dehydrogenase, (e) Ahcy adenosylhomocysteinase,
  (f) Cbs cystathionine beta-synthetase, (g) Bhmt betaine homocysteine methyltransferase,
  (h) Slc1a5, 7a5, 7a7, 7a8, 16a9, 38a1, 38a2, and 43a2 solute carrier family.'
