caption: Model of innate immune pathways involved in AAV-mediated gene transfer. a
  The TLR9-MyD88 pathway, which senses the AAV genome, is involved in CD8+ T-cell
  responses. It may also be involved in suppressing anti-capsid IgG1 antibody responses
  when MyD88 signaling is intact. b Through an unknown pathway, B cell-intrinsic MyD88
  regulates the production of capsid-specific Th1-associated IgG2c antibodies. c An
  unidentified mechanism leads to the production of MyD88-independent anti-capsid
  IgG1.
