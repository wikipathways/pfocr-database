caption: Schema showing effect of different RAF inhibitors in monomeric RAF kinases
  (i.e. BRAFV600E) (top section) or dimeric RAF kinases (bottom section). ERK activation
  is strongly activated downstream of BRAFV600E, even more so than seen for RAF dimeric
  kinase signaling. Monomer-selective RAF inhibitors bind to the ATP site in BRAF
  monomers and inhibit downstream signaling. In RAF dimeric kinases, binding of drug
  inhibits the bound RAF protomer, but leads to a conformational change in the other
  protomer in the dimer pair and strong transactivation of this protomer, leading
  to overall increased ERK activation. Drug binding to one site of the RAF dimer pair
  leads to a negative cooperativity for binding to the other site, and therefore at
  clinical doses, only one protomer in the dimer pair binds drug. RAF dimer inhibitors
  are able to bind to mutant RAF monomers and dimers at equipotent doses without negative
  cooperativity for the second site, and therefore can inhibit mutant RAF monomers
  and dimers at the same dose. RAF dimer breakers bind to and inhibit BRAF monomers.
  In RAF dimeric kinases, these drugs act by directly disrupting dimerization, rather
  than binding to both protomers in the dimer pair and exhibit negative cooperativity
  for binding a second protomer in the dimer pair. Dimer breakers disrupt BRAF-containing
  dimers, but do not disrupt CRAF homodimers, where they cause transactivation of
  the unbound CRAF protomer.
