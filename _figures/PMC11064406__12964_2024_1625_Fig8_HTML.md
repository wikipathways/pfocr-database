caption: Cuproptosis enhances anti-cancer immune effects by influencing the cGAS-STING
  pathway. This signaling pathway is activated inside dendritic cells by cancer cells
  undergoing cuproptosis, triggered by treatments such as ES and copper chloride (CuCl2).
  This reaction leads to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  including IL-2, TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), IFN-γ (interferon-gamma), C-X-C
  motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) 10, and CXCL11. Furthermore, the concurrent use of
  cuproptosis inducers with PD-1 blockade significantly increases the population of
  circulating CD45 + CD8 + T cells, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of
  cancer therapy
