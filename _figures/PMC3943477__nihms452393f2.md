caption: Results from the panel of assays identify the pathway targets and generate
  a point of departure (POD) for the subsequent risk assessment as an in vitro concentration.
  Computational systems biology pathway (CSBP) modeling of circuitry and dynamics
  for the assay system indicates the expected shape of the dose response at lower
  doses, leading to a POD. The POD concentration is then converted to an exposure
  standard through techniques of reverse dosimetry implemented by pharmacokinetic
  modeling. This step takes advantages of in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE).
