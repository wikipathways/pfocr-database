caption: NT-3 and NGF act upon a common TrkA receptor in sympathetic neurons to regulate
  distinct stages of axonal growth. NT-3 promotes proximal axon extension along the
  vasculature, whereas NGF is required for innervation of final peripheral targets.
  NGF-specific engagement of the PLC-γ effector pathway activates the calcium-responsive
  phosphatase, calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates PxIxIT motif-containing dynamin1
  isoforms to promote TrkA endocytosis. Calcineurin-mediated endocytic trafficking
  of TrkA receptors signals locally in sympathetic nerve terminals to promote NGF-dependent
  axonal extension and branching within final target tissues.
