caption: 'CD39 in COVID‐19 severity: schematic representation of pro-thrombotic and
  proinflammatory pathways related with purinergic signaling. sCD39 is upregulated
  along COVID-19 severity. Hypoxia and antiviral immune response through RIG-I pathway
  might be involved in CD39 upregulation. Moreover, this study reports impaired purinergic
  signaling in COVID-19, characterized by high levels of eATP and eADP in combination
  with low levels of anti-inflammatory ADO, maybe due to CD73 reduced expression.
  eATP contribute to hyperinflammation and TF release secondary to NLRP3 activation.
  eADP overproduction is linked to platelet activation through P2Y12R. Blockade of
  P2Y12R through drugs as ticagrelor is suggesting as a promising therapy for severe
  COVID‐19 patients.'
