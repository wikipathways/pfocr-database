caption: —Predicted versus actual promoter changes in the passaging. Predicted (on
  left, as before) and actual mutations (on right) found during the passaging. Actual
  paths (red promoters) on right are shown with arrows, and pathway boxes are shaded
  according to activity. Activity as a percentage of the G78-KIRV T7 RNAP on the CGG
  promoter is displayed in parentheses below each triplet (fig. 1 and ,  online).
  Those promoters found that matched the prediction are underlined whereas those unanticipated
  by the prediction are boxed.
