caption: Proposed model for the NF-independent, T3SS-dependent symbiotic process between
  Bradyrhizobium ORS3257 and A. indica. The symbiosis between ORS3257 and A. indica
  does not involve NFs but depends on a mixture of T3Es delivered into the host cell
  where they act in concert for nodulation. NopP1 and NopM1 suppress plant defense
  responses resulting from the activation of PTI and/or ETI. Both NopAB and NopT effectors
  promote bacterial infection of the nodule, directly or indirectly. The ErnA effector
  triggers organ development either by activating the common symbiosis signaling pathway
  (CSSP) or by a yet-unknown mechanism. Moreover, we cannot exclude that ErnA is also
  involved, directly or indirectly, in the infection process.
