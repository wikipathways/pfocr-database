caption: Hypothetical role of TRPP2 in mechanotransduction. Cilium bending in response
  to fluid shear stress may activate GPCR(s) in a ligand-independent fashion, probably
  through mechanical stretching of the PM and/or associated cytoskeletal structures
  (arrows). Activation of GPCR would result in intracellular Ca2+ release from the
  ER through the IP3pathway and activation of SOCs. ROCs, including plasma membrane
  TRPP2, could also be activated, resulting in a massive and long-lasting increase
  in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Dashed arrow denotes changes in membrane tension
  in response to cilium bending.
