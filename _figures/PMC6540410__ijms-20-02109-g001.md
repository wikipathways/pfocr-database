caption: Schematic representation of the insulin signaling pathway and the modulation
  of this pathway by cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R). The binding of insulin to
  the insulin receptor triggers a signaling cascade, which involves tyrosine phosphorylation
  of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and the activation of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K). This leads to an increase in the level of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate,
  which recruits Akt to the plasma membrane alongside phosphatidylinositol-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1). In this cascade, Akt is phosphorylated at Thr308 by PDK1 and at
  Ser473 by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). The activated CB1R mediates
  the activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), which subsequently inhibits the Ser 307 phosphorylation of
  IRS1. Activated CB1R is also believed to inhibit the activation of mTORC2, thereby
  preventing the Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt.
