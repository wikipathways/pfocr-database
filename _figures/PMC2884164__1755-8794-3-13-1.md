caption: 'Significant signaling pathway networks mined from pituitary adenoma protein-mapping
  dataset. Significant signaling pathway networks that are involved in human pituitary
  adenoma mapping proteins and that function in (A) cancer, cell-to-cell signaling
  and interaction, small molecule biochemistry (Network 1); (B) post-translational
  modifications, protein-folding, hematological disease (Network 2); (C) organ morphology,
  reproductive-system development and function, molecular transport (Network 3); (D)
  lipid metabolism, molecular transport, smallmolecule biochemistry (Network 4); (E)
  cell death, hematological disease, cellular development (Network 5); and (F) lipid
  metabolism, small-molecule biochemistry, carbohydrate metabolism (Network 6). An
  orange solid edge denotes a direct relationship between two nodes (molecules: proteins;
  genes). A black unsolid edge denotes an indirect relationship between two nodes
  (molecules: proteins; genes). A gray node denotes an identified protein in our study
  []. The various shapes of nodes denote the different functions (Additional file
  , Table S1). A duplicated shape means this node contains multiple components. A
  curved line means intracellular translocation; A curved arrow means extracellular
  translocation.'
