caption: Anerobic metabolic routes in C. reinhardtii. Under dark anoxia, starch is
  metabolized to pyruvate via glycolysis, thereby generating ATP and reducing power
  (NADH). The network shows a pyruvate branch point with four enzymes. Another branch
  point is acetyl-CoA that can be used to produce ethanol via ADHE or acetate via
  the PTA-ACK pathway. Network is simplified by the omission of the subcellular localization
  of the different enzymes. Fe and Zn indicate the metal in the active site of the
  alcohol dehydrogenases. To better understand the metabolic responses, the number
  of oxidizable electrons is indicated for each metabolite. The main fermentation
  route used by the alga incubated in AIB under dark anoxia is the “PFL-gated pathway,”
  which consists of PFL, ADHE, and PTA-ACK.
