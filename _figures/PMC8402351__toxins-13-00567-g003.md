caption: 'Schematic summary of the main signaling events triggered by StII on normal
  BHK cells and tumor Raji cells. Upon binding to the membrane, StII promotes Ca2+
  release to the cytosol from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) []; after pore organization
  in the membrane a decrease of K+ and increase of Ca2+ ions occurs in the cytosol.
  Sublytic doses of StII elicit activation of Erk1/2 and p38 MAPKs, leading to cell
  survival in BHK cells. This activation occurs in response to K+ depletion in cell
  cytosol []. In Raji cells, sublytic doses of StII activate the signaling pathway
  involving Erk1/2 and RIP1. This activation leads to cell death by a necrosis cell
  type of cell death with the participation of intracellular pathways. Lytic doses
  of StII provoke cell necrosis accompanied by blebbing. *: activated components.'
