caption: Starvation increases the expression of four sisRNAs (sisR-1 to sisR-4) in
  the ovaries, which results in a decrease in oocyte production. Those oocytes that
  managed to develop past the apoptotic checkpoint have higher levels of sisR-8 and
  RpL10Ab mRNA, which is later translated into RpL10Ab protein during development.
  Both sisR-8 and RpL10Ab repress the splicing of RpL10Ab pre-mRNA transcribed during
  development and result in a lower basal expression of RpL10Ab. This leads to a more
  active TOR pathway in the progeny germline, lower sisR-1 to sisR-4 expression and
  consequently greater resistance to starvation-induced oocyte loss.
