caption: a cGAS is activated by mislocalized DNA in the cytosol by various sources
  such as self-DNA from damaged mitochondrion or micronucleus, or exogeneous DNA derived
  from virus, dead cell, and bacterium. Activated cGAS uses ATP and GTP as substrates
  to catalyze the formation of cGAMP, which acts as a second messenger to activate
  STING. b Cyclic dinucleotides secreted from bacteria can also activate STING directly.
  c Activated STING dimerizes and translocates from the ER to the perinuclear region
  via Golgi to recruit and promote TBK1-IRF3-IκB assembly, which subsequently drives
  activation of IRF3 and NF-κB to produce IFN and inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6),
  respectively.
