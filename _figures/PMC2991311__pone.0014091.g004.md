caption: A boxed gene/protein name indicates the activity of this enzyme was measured.
  Red lettering for the protein designation indicates an increase in activity; green,
  decrease; black, no change. Metabolites appearing more than once are connected by
  gray lines. Changes are shown for (A) the initial response, time  = 10–30 min with
  (B) serving as a legend. Graphs depicting changes for pre-methanol addition, time
   = 0 min; just prior to/at the start of cell growth, time  = 1–2 h; and exponential
  cell growth, time  = 3–6 h are included in . Reaction descriptions are included
  in  along with gene expression intensities, LogRatios, fold changes and p-values.
  Mesaconyl-CoA, ethylmalonyl-CoA, methylsuccinyl-CoA were measured as free acids.
  **Color at T = 0 represents the concentration before methanol was added for all
  metabolites except for methanol which was calculated as 50 mM for the initial T = 0
  value.
