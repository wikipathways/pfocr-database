caption: Genetic and cellular determinants that regulate pyrophosphate and phosphate
  homeostasis and the formation of hydroxyapatite crystals in the ECM. The key enzymes
  (ENPP1, CD73 and ALP) and transporters (ANK and ABCC6) that mediate the ATP metabolic
  pathway and pyrophosphate catalysis are detailed. The functions of matrix vesicle
  (MV) that carry and transport calcium/phosphate (Ca++/Pi) and matrix proteins to
  ECM for the formation of hydroxyapatite crystals and the secretion factors that
  are important for calcium binding and inhibition of the formation of hydroxyapatite
  crystals (MGP, OPN and Fetuin-A) are highlighted.
