caption: Schematic diagram for the suppression of testosterone production by TiO2-NPs
  associated with ROS-MAPK(ERK1/2)-StAR signaling pathway. Acute oral exposure to
  high doses of TiO2 NPs in male rats would lead to the production of ROS and further
  activation of MAPK (ERK1/2) by ROS. ERK and StAR regulate each other, and interference
  with the expression of ERK1/2 will lead to the inability of StAR to transport cholesterol
  to the mitochondria normally, resulting in the inhibition of testosterone synthesis
  in the testis. (“↑” activation, “‡” inactivation, “P” phosphorylation)
