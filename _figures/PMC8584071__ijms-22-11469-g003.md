caption: 'EMT related pathways that can activate the expression of different TFs.
  Once TGFBR is activated, SMAD1 and 2 are phosphorylated inducing the transcription
  of SNAI1 gene. SNAI1 could also be activated, together with SLUG gene, via RAS/MAPK
  pathways triggered by different ligands (i.e., FGF, EGF). Wnt signaling leads to
  β-catenin accumulation into the nucleus followed by TWIST1 transcription, which
  is also regulated by Notch pathway via STAT3, as well as SLUG. Finally, hypoxia
  contributes to TWIST1 transcription. Created with Available online: https://biorender.com/
