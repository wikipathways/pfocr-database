caption: Autophagic cell death in breast tumor cells. In the canonical pathway, Beclin-1
  is essential for the initiation of autophagy. Bcl-2 binds to Beclin-1 and interferes
  with its capacity to promote autophagy; conversely, silencing of Bcl-2 can lead
  to autophagic cell death. Autophagy induced in the non-canonical pathway is independent
  of Beclin-1 function. Resveratrol is one agent that induces non-canonical autophagic
  cell death in breast tumor cells. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediates autophagy
  by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR/4EBP1 signaling pathway and can induce both apoptosis
  and autophagic cell death. Autophagic cell death can serve as a backup mechanism
  in cells where apoptosis is inhibited, by agents such as the caspase inhibitor,
  z-VAD-Fmk. Intraconversion between cytoprotective autophagy and autophagic cell
  death can be observed in MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 breast tumor cells when radiation treatment
  is combined with vitamin D or a vitamin D analog.
