caption: (A) Short-patch base excision repair pathway. This pathway involves the removal
  of damaged bases and leads to a repair track of a single nucleotide. (B) The long-patch
  base excision repair pathway produces a repair track of at least two nucleotides.
  (C) Alignment of PARP1 catalytic domains in human, Leishmania infantum, Leishmania
  major, Trypanosoma brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi. The ADP-ribose transferase catalytic
  triad H-Y-E is highlighted.
