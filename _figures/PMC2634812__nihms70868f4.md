caption: Myeloid diversion pathways for advanced pro-T cells by re-introduction of
  C/EBPα or PU.1. Comparison of the sequences of gene expression changes induced by
  transduction of pro-T cells with PU.1 or with C/EBPα, from first effects (day 1–2)
  through lineage conversion (4–9 days). Effects summarized in the figure were measured
  on purified DN3 pro-T cells from adult mouse thymus, transduced with C/EBP factors
  [] or on DN2/3 stage fetal thymocytes, transduced with PU.1 []. “Pro-T genes” include
  Rag1, Lck, LAT, and ZAP70, the products of which are needed for TCR function. Continued
  progress along the myeloid pathway depends on the lack of Notch-Delta signals in
  PU.1 overexpressing cells. The pathway branch indicated by “+DL” shows how reintroduction
  of Notch-Delta signaling can stall or reverse the reprogramming of fetal pro-T cells
  by PU.1. Although high-level PU.1 is inhibitory for proliferation and progression
  of T-lineage cells beyond the DN3 stage, Notch signaling and neutral viability support
  (a Bcl2 transgene) can restore substantial T-lineage differentiation even beyond
  β-selection. Major gene targets that are differentially affected by PU.1 in the
  presence or absence of Notch-Delta signaling are shown (data from ref. []).
