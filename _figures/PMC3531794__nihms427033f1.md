caption: Impact of IL-27 on lymphocyte signaling pathways. Dimerization of gp130 and
  IL-27Ra engages JAK1, 2 and Tyk2 that engage the MAPK pathway and activation of
  multiple STATs, most notably STAT1 and STAT3. The activation of STAT1 is linked
  to inhibition of GATA-3 and RoRγt but upregulation of PD-L1, T-bet and IL-10. The
  ability to engage STAT3 is linked to increased proliferation as well as IL-10 while
  the MAPK pathway intersects with AHR to promote IL-10 and IL-21.
