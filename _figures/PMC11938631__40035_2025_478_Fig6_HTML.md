caption: 'Potential mechanisms of Shh signaling pathway in maintaining BBB integrity.
  Model 1 (Shown by black lines and arrows): Astrocytes secrete Shh, which binds to
  its receptor Ptch1 on BECs to activate Smo and initiate the transcription of Gli1
  and other target genes. This signaling leads to the upregulation of junctional proteins
  that restrict paracellular diffusion across the BBB, along with a reduction in transcellular
  transport. Model 2 (Shown by green lines and arrows): Binding of Shh to the Ptch1
  receptor on astrocytes activates downstream Shh signaling targets, including Gli1,
  leading to reduced transcytosis in BECs. After TBI or in AD, Shh expression is suppressed,
  leading to increased endothelial transcytosis and BBB permeability. The downregulation
  of Shh following TBI is mediated by Endothelin-1 (ET-1), which activates endothelin
  ETB receptors. Created with BioRender.com'
