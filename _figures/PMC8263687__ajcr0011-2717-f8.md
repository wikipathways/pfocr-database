caption: Model for the effects of KLF16 overexpression in GC. We propose a model in
  which KLF16 transcriptionally up-regulates MFAP5, which in turn, leads to an activation
  of the Notch pathway. Activation of Notch pathway, followed by augmentation of PI3K
  and phospho-AKT, increased cell cycle-related gene expression resulting in GC cell
  growth. Activation of the Notch pathway also increases EMT-related gene expression
  resulting in GC cell migration and invasion.
