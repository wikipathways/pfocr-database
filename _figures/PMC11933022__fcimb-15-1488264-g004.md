caption: 'Model of TMAO effect on CKD: Three main pathways are depicted: TMAO activates
  macrophages by stimulating NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor protein 3) and stimulates T
  cell differentiation to produce multiple inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α, IL-6,
  etc., which exacerbate the inflammatory response; At the same time, it not only
  promotes the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome, but also activates the expression
  of NF-κB signaling pathway, Caspase-1 activation, PERK/Akt/mTOR pathway, IL-1β and
  other inflammatory and fibrosis-related factors, thus significantly enhancing the
  process of renal fibrosis. Finally, the function of the intrarenal transporters
  is affected, resulting in the accumulation of waste products in the kidney, which
  may further exacerbate kidney injury and fibrosis'
