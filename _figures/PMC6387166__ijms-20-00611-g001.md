caption: Effects of distinct molecules produced by stressed cancer cells on NK cell-mediated
  functions. (a) Exosomes expressing NKG2D ligands induce NKG2D downmodulation leading
  to an impairment of NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity. (b) Exosomes expressing HSP70 engage
  TLR2 expressed on distinct innate immune cell populations as indicated. The direct
  TLR2 engagement on NK cells induces cellular activation. In contrast, TLR2 triggering
  on MDCSs induces the production of immunosuppressive factors that can impair NK
  cell activity. (c) Specific miRNAs can engage TLR8 expressed by macrophages leading
  to inflammatory cytokine production or TLR7 on plasmacytoid DCs leading to type
  I IFN production, that in turn contribute to NK cell activation. (d) Double strand
  DNA (dsDNA) accumulates in the cytoplasm of cancer cells in response to stress stimuli
  where it activates the cGAS/STING pathway leading to type I IFN production; in turn,
  dsDNA is packaged into exosomes and released in the tumor microenvironment where
  it is taken up by DCs that produce type I IFNs with a mechanism dependent on the
  cGAS/STING pathway. Type I IFNs, produced either by stressed cancer cells or DCs,
  activate NK cell-mediated functions, including cytotoxicity and cytokine production.
  “T” means inhibition. NK, Natural Killer; HSP70, Heat shock protein 70; NKG2D, NK
  group 2 member D; TLR2, Toll-like receptor 2; MDSCs, Myeloid suppressor cells; IFN,
