caption: Mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis and venetoclax mechanism of action. In
  response to cellular stress, the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK are translocated
  to the mitochondria and induce the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane
  with release of cytochrome c (Cyt C) into the cytoplasm. The Cyt C/Apaf-1 complex
  activates caspase 9 and the caspase cascade, inducing apoptosis. The mitochondrial
  pathway is regulated by pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, which activate BAX and
  inhibit BCL-2 and MCL-1. BCL-2, MCL-1 and BCL-X regulate cell survival by inactivation
  of the pro-apoptotic proteins. Venetoclax triggers apoptosis by selective inhibition
  of BCL-2, leading to the release of Cyt C and cell death.
