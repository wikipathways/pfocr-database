caption: A. The production of one molecule of PQQ requires the participation of at
  least six proteins, five equivalents of O2, one equivalent of SAM and the participation
  of an electron donor system to initiate the reductive SAM cleavage. B. The newly
  proposed redox cofactor mycofactocin (MFT) biosynthetic pathway shares high similarity
  to PQQ biogenesis. [,] In the proposed pathway, MftA, a short peptide, is modified
  by radical SAM enzyme, MftC, in the presence of a chaperone, MftB. The modified
  MftA is hydrolyzed by protease, MftE, followed by oxidative deamination and glycosylation.
  The mature MFT contains a presumed redox-active MFT core that can be reduced to
  MFTH2.[]
