caption: The complex steps leading to SREBP activation and input from mTORC1 signalling.
  (A) SREBP processing and activation is regulated by mTORC1 through S6K and lipin
  1 leading to the transcriptional induction of the SREBF1 and SREBF2 genes, encoding
  SREBP1 and SREBP2, respectively, and genes encoding many lipogenic enzymes involved
  in both fatty acid and sterol synthesis. The mTORC1-mediated transcriptional activation
  of SREBF1 could result from either autoregulation by SREBP1 or from an unknown parallel
  pathway downstream from mTORC1. (B) In the presence of sterols, SREBP resides in
  the endoplasmic reticulum bound to SCAP and the Insig proteins. When sterols become
  scarce SCAP undergoes a conformational change, which releases the SCAP–SREBP complex
  from the Insig, allowing its transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi
  apparatus through COPII vesicles. Once in the Golgi, SREBP comes into contact with
  two site-specific proteases. S1P cleaves the luminal loop of SREBP and S2P cleaves
  the amino-terminal transmembrane region of SREBP, which releases the N-terminal
  region of SREBP containing the DNA-binding and -transactivating domains. The NLS-containing
  processed form of SREBP enters the nucleus to activate transcription of genes containing
  SREs in their promoters. Finally, the processed form of SREBP is unstable and subject
  to proteasome-mediated degradation. In some settings, SREBP processing has been
  found to require S6K1 downstream from mTORC1 and is therefore sensitive to rapamycin.
  However, the nuclear shuttling of SREBP has been found to require lipin 1 downstream
  from mTORC1, the phosphorylation of which is largely resistant to rapamycin but
  sensitive to mTOR kinase domain inhibitors (). The precise molecular mechanisms
  by which either of these two mTORC1 targets regulates SREBP activation are unknown.
