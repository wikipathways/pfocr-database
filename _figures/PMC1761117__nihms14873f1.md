caption: A pathway (shown by the transparent shapes) involving the activation of the
  Gs/adenylyl cyclase/cAMP signaling cascade seems to be prominently involved in the
  LHR-provoked phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MA-10 cells. Cyclic AMP seems to stimulate
  ERK1/2 phosphorylation by activating protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn activates
  Ras by a pathway that has not yet been characterized (indicated by the broken arrows
  and question marks). Additional LHR-mediated pathways for Ras activation are also
  possible as indicated by the curved arrow and question marks. The Ras-induced activation
  of the Raf1-MEK1-ERK1/2 cascade is presumed to occur by the classical pathway that
  has been so well described in many other cell types. A role for MEK has been documented
  by the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by the addition of UO126, a
  selective MEK inhibitor.A role for cAMP can be readily documented by the inhibition
  of ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by overexpression of a cAMP phosphodiesterase
  (PDE) and by the ability of 8Br-cAMP (a cAMP analog that activates PKA or cAMP-GEFs)
  to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation. A role for PKA can be documented by the inhibition
  of ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by overexpression of the heat stable PKA inhibitor
  (PKI) or by addition of H89, a selective PKA inhibitor. A role for Ras can be documented
  by ability of hCG to enhance the levels of Ras-GTP and by the inhibition of ERK1/2
  phosphorylation induced by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant (Ras-S17N).The
  involvement of cAMP-GEFs, and Rap1 can be excluded (shown by the gray shapes) by
  the inability of 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (a cAMP analog that selectively activates cAMP-GEFs)
  to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation, by the inability of hCG to activate Rap1 and
  by the inability of a dominant negative mutant of Rap1 (Rap1b-S17N) to inhibit the
  hCG-induced increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
