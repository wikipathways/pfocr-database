caption: Overview of uptake of dsRNA by the cell to trigger RNAi and possible mechanisms
  of interference by persistent RNA (or DNA) virus infection. As an example, a gut
  epithelial cell is shown. Note that many of the proposed mechanisms are hypothetical.
  DsRNA is taken up from the gut content by endocytosis (“environmental RNAi”) and
  hypothetically may be presented, by an unknown mechanism, at the late endosomal
  stage to the RNAi machinery (siRISC complexes containing Dicer-2 and Ago-2). Alternatively,
  internalized dsRNA can be degraded in lysosomes. Cytoplasmic RNA virus infection
  can interfere with the RNAi machinery by the production of protein viral suppressors
  of RNAi (VSRs) and by the generation of large amounts of RNAs (including defective
  interfering RNAs) and small RNAs (sRNAs) that will “overflow” the RNAi machinery.
  Virus-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs; for instance dsRNA)
  can also interact with pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs; for instance helicase
  domain of Dicer-2) to activate innate immune pathways that will establish a general
  “antiviral state” in the cells. If such an alternative pathway exists to control
  persistent virus infection, the maintenance costs for effective RNAi may become
  too high and deficiencies in the RNAi machinery may accumulate. The establishment
  of such hypothetical general “antiviral state” could also occur during nuclear DNA
  virus infection, for instance through the modulation of host miRNAs or the production
  of viral miRNAs (which are assembled in miRISC complexes containing Dicer-1 and
  Ago-1). The local antiviral response can hypothetically also result in the secretion
  of cytokine-like factors that will spread through the insect body to establish a
  systemic antiviral reaction.
