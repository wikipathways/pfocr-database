caption: Schematic outline for the proposed use of TrkB ligands as novel therapeutic
  drugs in depression. In preclinical studies, inflammation promotes reduced BDNF
  in the PFC and hippocampus, as well as increased BDNF in the NAc of the brain, resulting
  in a depression-like phenotype in rodents. From preclinical data, we propose that
  TrkB agonists and current antidepressants, such as SSRIs and SNRIs could be effective
  therapeutic drugs for depressed patients with decreased levels of BDNF in the PFC
  and hippocampus. In contrast, TrkB antagonists confer potential therapeutic benefits
  for patients with treatment-resistant depression showing increased BDNF levels in
  the VTA-NAc pathway.
