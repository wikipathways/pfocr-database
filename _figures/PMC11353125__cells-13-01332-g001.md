caption: 'Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
  and its variant EGFRvIII activate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, subsequently influencing
  mTOR activity. Activation of RTKs, EGFR, and EGFRvIII leads to the phosphorylation
  and activation of PI3K, which converts PIP2 to PIP3 [18]. This conversion recruits
  and activates AKT, which in turn phosphorylates and activates mTOR. Activated mTOR
  functions as a major inhibitor of autophagy by phosphorylating and inhibiting key
  autophagy-initiating proteins, such as ULK1/2 [52]. This inhibition prevents the
  formation of autophagosomes and, subsequently, blocks the autophagic process, allowing
  for the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles within the cell. mTOR pathway:
  Inhibition of autophagy occurs through the mTOR pathway, which is activated by abundant
  nutrients. Under conditions of nutrient deficiency, energy deficiency, and oxidative
  stress, mTOR is inhibited, leading to the induction of autophagy'
