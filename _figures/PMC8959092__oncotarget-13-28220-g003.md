caption: Omeprazole inhibits V-ATPase, thereby reducing acidification of tumor microenvironment,
  which sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy. Novobiocin inhibits DNA polymerase
  theta (Polθ) suppressing DNA repair mechanisms and sensitizing cancer cells to PARPi.
  Itraconazole inhibits Hedgehog (Hh), mTOR, and VEGFR/angiogenesis pathway disrupting
  tumor vasculature and sensitizing ovarian cancers to paclitaxel. Licofenole attenuates
  cancer tissue inflammation and hypoxia by inhibiting COX2 and 5LOX. It also reduces
  the expression of stem cell markers and regulators (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, ALDH1A, CD133)
  sensitizing ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel. Chloroquine disrupts autophagy sensitizing
  cancer cells to PARPi. Metformin suppresses insulin signals and glucose synthesis
  via respiratory-chain complex I blockage and sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin.
  Mebendazole inhibits microtubule polymerization and glucose uptake by cells effectively
  killing chemotherapy resistant ovarian tumor cells.
