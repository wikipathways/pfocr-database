caption: The schematic diagram of the mechanism of rescued effector‐triggered immunity
  (ETI) in elevated temperature by overexpressed NON‐RACE‐SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1
  (NDR1) in Arabidopsis. In plant immunity, NDR1 genetically interacts with Resistance
  to Pseudomonas Syringae‐2 (RPS2) and RPM1‐interacting protein 4 (RIN4) to facilitate
  ETI in response to AvrRpt2. Concomitantly, NDR1 contributes to a robust pro‐immune
  transcriptome, including the upregulation of RPS2 and genes involved in salicylic
  acid (SA) signaling. At elevated temperature (29°C), transcription of these defense
  genes is inhibited, rendering plants susceptible to bacteria pathogen infection.
  In the ndr1/35S::NDR1 overexpression line, increased levels of NDR1 rescue the transcription
  of ISOCHRISMATE SYNTHASE 1 (ICS1) and CALMODULIN BINDING PROTEIN 60g (CBP60g) under
  elevated temperatures, thus sustaining the production of SA and its signaling pathway.
  In parallel, NDR1 overexpression enhances RPS2 messenger RNA accumulation and stabilizes
  RIN4, the guardee, to sustain the function of the nucleotide‐binding leucine‐rich
  repeat complex. Dashed lines indicate dampened signaling pathway. Yellow explosion
  symbols indicate immune activation.
