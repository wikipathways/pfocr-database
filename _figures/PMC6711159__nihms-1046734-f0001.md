caption: A Closer Look at Pyroptosis. Cell lysis as well as abnormal proliferation
  in MDS can be attributed to pyroptosis. Pyroptosis, as described in , occurs with
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation. It has been shown that ROS generated either from
  mutations or DAMP signaling begins NLRP3 activation. The NFκB pathway is crucial
  for the production of inflammasome component assembly. Concurrently, ROS also activates
  the wnt/β-catenin pathway leading to abnormal proliferation. Abbreviations are found
  in the text. CASP1 = caspase 1.
