caption: Schema for potential state of canonical Wnt signaling pathway in mouse models.
  (A) Wnt signaling is activated in 1638N-T1. (B) Wnt signaling is inhibited in CMT-93
  through cross-talks with VDR- and/or LXR-induced pathways. Interaction of tumor
  cells with the microenvironment has an impact on cell proliferation, invasion, and
  metastasis in mouse models. Signature genes and transcription factors/cofactors,
  whose binding sites were found to be enriched in promoters, are indicated by a red
  asterisk or a yellow asterisk, respectively.
