caption: FA And Cholesterol Metabolism in Hematological Malignancies. The de novo
  synthesis of FA is regulated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. De novo FA synthesis
  mainly depends on two key rate-limiting enzymes, ACC carboxylates acetyl-CoA to
  malonyl-CoA, and FASN converts acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA Conversion of acyl-CoA
  to long-chain FA. ACC and FASN are regulated by mTOR, which is a downstream target
  of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Overexpressed FASN can prompt p70-S6 kinase to
  phosphorylate USP11 and the phosphorylated USP11 mediates eIF4B deubiquitination
  to increase its stability. eIF4B mediates the expression of anti-apoptotic and cell
  survival proteins, ultimately driving the development of lymphoma. In addition,
  PARK2 can also be phosphorylated by mTORC1 to lose its ubiquitination activity,
  thereby blocking the ubiquitination and degradation of eIF4B protein. The E3 ubiquitin
  ligase COP1 binds to ACC1 through Trib1 and causes ACC1 ubiquitination and degradation
  to inhibit FA synthesis. Cells uptake exogenous FAs mainly through CD36, FATP, FABP
  and SCL27. Endogenous FAs and exogenous FAs enter the mitochondria through the transmembrane
  mechanism, and generate a large amount of ATP through FA β-oxidation, the TCA cycle
  and the electron transport chains. Moreover, MIEF2, a key regulator of mitochondrial
  fission, can stimulate the production of mitochondrial ROS and activate the AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway to further enhance FA synthesis. Cholesterol homeostasis is mainly
  regulated by SREBPs and LXRs. In conditions of low cholesterol levels, SCAP-SREBP2
  can be smoothly transferred from the ER to the Golgi apparatus to activate the de
  novo synthesis pathway of cholesterol. In conditions of high cholesterol levels,
  INSIG, SCAP and SREBP2 form a stable trimolecular complex to block the export and
  activation of SREBP2, and finally inhibiting the de novo cholesterol synthetic route.
  Moreover, by activating LXR-RXR to express ABCA1 and ABCG1, excessive cholesterol
  is transported to the liver and excreted in the form of bile acids. Furthermore,
  excessive cholesterol is rapidly esterified and exported under the action of ACAT
  and SR-BI to form vacuoles containing cholesterol ester derivatives. I, II, III
  and IV represent complex I, complex II, complex III and complex IV in the electron
  transport chains, respectively.
