caption: Schematic illustration of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) invasion
  into bladder epithelial cells. Due to the relatively short length of the female
  urinary tract, UPEC typically enters the bladder through the urethra and attempts
  to invade bladder epithelial cells. The urine accumulated in the bladder serves
  to flush out most bacteria; however, a small fraction of UPEC that adheres to the
  surface of the bladder epithelial cells proceeds to invade further and may even
  cause ascending infections. UPEC enters the bladder epithelial cells via endocytosis.
  Simultaneously, the toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the cell surface transmits signals
  that activate the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. This activation
  prompts the release of a substantial amount of cytokines and cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP). The produced β-defensin is then secreted into the extracellular space to
  counteract the invasion of UPEC. Moreover, the released cAMP promotes the exocytosis
  of vesicles containing UPEC. The cytokines generated primarily combat the invasion
  of UPEC by recruiting immune cells. Meanwhile, a portion of UPEC within the vesicles
  can breach the vesicle membrane and enter the cytoplasm. The majority of these intracellular
  bacteria will be recognized by lysosomes and ultimately be excreted out of the cells.
  However, a minuscule number of them are capable of forming intracellular bacterial
  communities (IBCs) within the cells. Created with BioRender.com
