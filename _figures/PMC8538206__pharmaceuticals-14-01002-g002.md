caption: CB1 and CB2 signaling pathways. Endocannabinoids (ECs) stimulate cannabinoid
  receptors type 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2, respectively), activating G-protein subunits.
  Subunit Gα decreases cyclic AMP (cAMP) and inhibits the activity of protein kinase
  A (PKA). Moreover, it is responsible for the activation of several kinases such
  as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), P38, and Rho kinase. Subunit Gβγ activation
  modulates channel conductance and the activity of G protein receptor kinases (GRKs).
  Both receptors can be phosphorylated by GRKs and associate with β-arrestin leading
  to receptor internalization and extracellular-signal related kinase (ERK) pathway
  activation.
