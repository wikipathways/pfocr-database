caption: 'The metabolic pathways that provide precursors necessary for the tRNA modifying
  enzymes in eukaryotes. The mitochondrion metabolic activity plays a vital role in
  tRNA modification. The single-carbon metabolism in the mitochondrion maintains the
  appropriate cytoplasmic pool of tetrahydrofolate (THF). The folate cycle cross-talks
  with the methionine cycle in a highly dependent manner, thereby providing SAM, a
  methyl donor for tRNA methyltransferase reaction. The mitochondria also supply an
  iron–sulfur (Fe/S) cluster that is transported via the Atm1 transporter into the
  cytosol. The cytoplasmic iron–sulfur protein assembly machinery produces the cytoplasmic
  iron–sulfur cluster that is essential for tRNA thiolation. In addition, intermediary
  metabolic pathways in the mitochondria usually produce acetyl-CoA, which serves
  as a donor of acetyl moiety for the tRNA isopentenylation pathway and most acetyl
  transferase reactions, including tRNA acetylation. The glycolytic pathway serves
  as a major source of energy for tRNA synthesis. Overall, the modification hotspots
  of tRNA are also shown, including their positions. (SAM: S-adenosylmethionine; 3-P.
