caption: Model showing how hypoxia potentially influences cytosolic and mitochondrial
  NAD(P)H redox, superoxide generation, and metabolic interactions that appear to
  control relaxation of SMC in BCA to hypoxia. Based on NAD(P)H autofluorescence changes
  and the actions of rotenone, hypoxia may increase mitochondrial NADH and superoxide
  production from complex I of the electron transport chain, whereas contracting BCA
  with 30K prevents hypoxia from increasing mitochondrial NAD(P)H and a decrease in
  mitochondrial superoxide is observed. Superoxide production in the cytosolic-nuclear
  region is lowered by hypoxia potentially as a result of decreased activity of cytosolic
  NAD(P)H-dependent Nox oxidases. Hypoxia increases BCA lactate and decreases pyruvate,
  indicating it increases the ratio of lactate/pyruvate, which is an indicator of
  increased cytosolic NADH/NAD redox. Our previous work (Ref. ) documents evidence
  that hypoxia promotes BCA relaxation by increasing the ratio of NADP/NADPH associated
  with a lowering glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P). This hypoxia-elicited impaired maintenance
  of G-6-P and cytosolic NADPH by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is prevented
  by added pyruvate. Since hypoxia was observed to lower pyruvate, it may regulate
  mitochondrial-dependent metabolic pathways (described in the discussion), which
  control cytosolic NADPH redox through processes that include a feedback inhibition
  of glycolysis in a manner that maintains G-6-P levels and NADPH generation by the
  PPP. Note that the up and down arrows highlight documented and hypothesized effects
  of hypoxia observed in BCA.
