caption: Metabolic switch between MEP and MEC. Transcriptome pattern of genes involved
  in glycolysis, fermentation and TCA cycle in MEP (V) and MEC (F) at 15 and 20 DAP
  in flint and dent inbred lines. Right box lines represent MEP/MEC log2 expression
  ratio. Left box lines represent 20/15 DAP log2 expression ratio. For multigenic
  families, the results represent the mean of all genes. Genes ID and log2 ratio of
  all genes are listed in Table . Blue lines, amino acid synthesis pathway; PFK, phosphofructokinase;
  PFP, pyrophosphate-fructose-6-phosphate-1-phosphotransferase; ALD, fructose-bisphosphate
  aldolase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGK, phosphoglycerate
  kinase; PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase; ENO, enolase; PPDK, pyruvate orthophosphate
  dikinase; PK, pyruvate kinase; PDH, pyruvate; PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase;
  PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PDC, pyruvate decarboxylase; ADH, alcohol
  dehydrogenase; ALA-T, alanine aminotransferase; CTS, citrate synthase; ACO, aconitase;
  IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; OGDC, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex; SCS, succinyl-CoA
  synthetase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; FUM, fumarate hydratase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase;
  ME, malic enzyme; GOGAT, glutamate synthase; GAD, glutamate decarboxylase; GABA-T,
  γ-aminobutyric acid trans-aminase; SSADH, succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase.
