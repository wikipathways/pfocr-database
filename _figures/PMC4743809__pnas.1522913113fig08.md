caption: A model of G1 or G2 APOL1-induced cytotoxicity mediated by K+ efflux and
  activation of SAPK signaling. APOL1 proteins form K+-permeable cation-selective
  pores in the plasma membrane. Pores formed by G1 or G2 mediate increased efflux
  of intracellular K+, leading to depletion of intracellular K+ and resulting in activation
  of p38, JNK, and ERK MAPKs. The aberrantly activated SAPKs (p38 and JNK) cause cell
  toxicity and death likely via their downstream effectors. Down-regulation of GP130-STAT3
  signaling is a downstream consequence of activated p38 MAPK. However, the direct
  contribution of the GP130-STAT pathway in the pathogenesis of G1 or G2 APOL1 cytotoxicity
  is yet to be determined. Apparent cytoplasmic swelling results from influx of Na+
  (likely G1 or G1 APOL1-related), with accompanying Cl− and H20. G1 or G2 APOL1-induced
  autophagy occurs independently of K+ efflux and does not seem to contribute to G1
  or G2 APOL1-induced death of HEK293 cells.
