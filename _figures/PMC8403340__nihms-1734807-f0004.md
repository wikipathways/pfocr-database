caption: Hypothetic model of glutamate-induced consecutive activation that potentially
  stimulate glioma growth. GluRs and calcium influx participate in the consecutive
  processes that could form a positive feedback circuit to potentiate the glutamatergic
  effects in glioma cells. Activation of GluRs further increases calcium influx.
