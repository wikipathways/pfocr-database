caption: Speculative model for interaction of CTG repeats with homologous recombination.
  Although the upstream and downstream copies of the two APRT genes are not shown
  explicitly, the CTG repeats are present in the top strand of the downstream copy,
  as illustrated. To generate APRT− crossovers by SSA requires a double-strand break
  between the mutant and wild-type copies of exon 2, that is, to the left of the CTG
  repeat, as shown. Conversions by SDSA can be generated in a variety of ways that
  depend on invasion of a 3′ end, priming of DNA synthesis, release of the extended
  strand, and pairing with sequences on the other side of the break. The depicted
  events depart from the standard models for SSA and SDSA () at the formation of a
  hairpin by the triplet repeats and cleavage of the hairpin by the Ercc1/Xpf (E/X)
  endonuclease. It is hypothesized that a single strand ending in a hairpin is compromised
  for the strand invasion step in the SDSA pathway. If the initial break is in APRT
  sequences to the right of the repeat, the right-hand end will not have a hairpin
  and conversion may proceed normally.
