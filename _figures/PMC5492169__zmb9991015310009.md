caption: Schematic model describing the CD99 peptide-induced signal transduction pathway.
  CD99 engagement by agonistic ligands elicits the recruitment of SHP2 through the
  sAC/PKA signaling pathway, resulting in activation of the HRAS/MAPK signaling pathway.
  MAPK activation leads to the isomerization of FAK and PTPN12 mediated by PIN1, followed
  by PTPN12 binding to FAK and subsequent dephosphorylation of FAK at Y397, resulting
  in the inactivation of β1 integrin.
