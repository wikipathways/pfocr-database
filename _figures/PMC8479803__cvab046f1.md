caption: Regulation and characterisation of VSMC phenotypic switching. In the healthy
  vessel wall, VSMCs exhibit a contractile phenotype characterized by expression of
  contractile proteins (ACTA2, TAGLN, and MYH11) regulated by MYOCD, which is negatively
  regulated by NFκB, FOXO3A, miRNA221/222, miRNA21, and miRNA124. Upon injury or atherosclerosis,
  VSMCs switch to a synthetic phenotype mediated via PDGF-BB and Klf4, which is inhibited
  by miRNA143/145 and TGFβ. Synthetic VSMCs are characterised by increased secretion
  of ECM, MMPs, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and exosomes. Exosomes can trigger neighbouring
  VSMCs to transdifferentiate into osteochondrogenic VSMCs characterised by RUNX2,
  SOX9, osteopontin expression, release of calcium deposits, and calcifying vesicles.
  Osteochondrocyte-like VSMCs secrete calcifying vesicles that further propagate calcification.
  In some cases, calcifying VSMCs originate from medial contractile VSMCs in response
  to high concentrations of calcium and phosphate, β-catenin/Wnt signalling, KLF4,
  or miRNA221/222. Exposure to agLDL or oxLDL triggers a switch to macrophage-like
  VSMCs or foam cells characterised by CD68, CD36, LGALS3, CD11b, and pro-inflammatory
  cytokine expression, which is inhibited by integrin β3, apolipoprotein A1, or HDL.
  VSMCs may adopt adipocyte-like features in a corticosteroid/insulin-rich milieu
  characterised by expression of adipsin, leptin, and PPARγ pathway activation. KLF4
  promotes phenotypic modulation into macrophage-like and Sca1-expressing mesenchymal-like
  VSMCs, while MSCs differentiate into VSMCs in vitro when exposed to TGFβ and PDGF-BB.
  VSMCs might also derive from ECs following EndMT driven by TGFβ signalling. VSMCs
  can potentially transdifferentiate into endothelial-like cells characterised by
  CD31 expression and angiogenic features in response to shear stress or via a KLF4-dependent
  stem cell state. TCF21 and OCT4 promote phenotypic modulation into an athero-protective
  ‘myofibroblast’-like VSMC characterised by fibronectin, collagen 1 alpha 1, and
  proteoglycans production. Phenotypically switched VSMCs conserve an epigenetic H3K4me2
  signature of their former contractile state that can be used as a VSMC-specific
  marker. MYOCD, myocardin; NFκB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
