caption: Pathways of biosynthesis of O-glycans in normal and cancer breast epithelial
  cells. All of these transfer reactions are catalysed in the Golgi apparatus. Enzymes
  involved in the pathways are indicated in italic font next to the arrows. Various
  mechanisms are illustrated by which O-glycans expressed in normal cells (bottom
  left) can be turned down to shorter and sialylated species. First, the enzymes involved
  in extended O-glycans can be downregulated or mutated (downward white arrows) in
  cancer cells, leading to a decrease or an absence of extended structures and revealing
  previously masked precursors such as T and Tn antigens. Alternatively or concomitantly,
  overexpression of diverse sialyltransferases (upward white arrows) can compete with
  the enzymes of normal extension and generate truncated sialylated structures (right
  column). This competition can occur at different levels of the extension pathway
  and produce the sialylated structures of each precursor (that is, sialyl-Thomsen-nouvelle
  (sTn) antigen, sialyl-Thomsen-Friedenreich (sialyl-T or sialyl-TF) antigen (or sialylated
  Core1) and sialylated Core2 O-glycans). Gal, Galactose, GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine;
  GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid; Fuc, fucose. Linkages
  (anomery and carbons involved) are only indicated the first time they appear along
  the pathway. N, various numbers (2 to 10) of repeats of lactosamine units (Gal β1-3/4GlcNAc).
