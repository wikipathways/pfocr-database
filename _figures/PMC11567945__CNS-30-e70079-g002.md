caption: The alterations of paracellular permeability in Alzheimer's disease (AD)
  patients and numerous AD models. In AD patients and animal models, blood–brain barrier
  (BBB) becomes leaky, manifested as downregulation of junctional proteins and uncoupling
  of neurovascular unit cell members. Increased invasion of blood‐derived detrimental
  mediators like fibrinogen and thrombin further aggravate brain pathologies. In in vitro
  cell models, numerous amyloid β (Aβ) species induce downregulation of junctional
  proteins. Activation of NF‐κB pathway and Ca2+/Calcineurin‐mediated MMPs upregulation
  are reported contributing to the downregulation of tight junction proteins, in which
  mitochondrial apoptosis and increased autophagy are also involved. The reorganization
  of cytoskeleton and adherens junction, like VE‐Cadherin are observed under the stimulation
  of hypoxia or inflammatory mediators, in which activation of RhoA/ROCK/MLC/MLCK
  is involved
