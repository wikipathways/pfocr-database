caption: The ROS rheostat of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. Accumulation
  of DNA damage and genotoxic oxidative stress contributes to a common pathway that
  leads to loss of self-renewal capacity of HSCs and leads HSCs to exit their quiescent
  state. This contributes to the gradual decline of functional HSCs in the bone marrow.
  Mixed lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4) activates forkhead box O (FoxO) targets through
  an unknown mechanism, and MLL4 expression is shown to be protective in the MLL1-AF9
  (ALL1-fused gene from chromosome 9, or MLLT3) of AML by reducing the accumulation
  of ROS and, thus, DNA damage. Mll4-deficiency may also contribute to DNA damage
  through a ROS-independent mechanism. DNA damage results in the activation of ATM
  and, subsequently, DDR. Accumulation of γH2AX and co-localization with 53BP1 serve
  as markers of DDR, as in Flach, et al. Under normal conditions, ATM helps to maintain
  ROS at low levels. However, in the face of severe DNA damage ATM contributes to
  the accumulation of ROS and loss of quiescence in HSCs. ATM, ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated; FoxO, forkhead box O; DDR, DNA damage response; γH2AX, phosphorylated histone
  H2AX; MLL4, mixed-lineage leukemia 4; mitoBID, mitochondrial BH3 interacting-domain
  death agonist; MLL4, mixed-lineage leukemia 4; p38 MAPK, p38 mitogen-activated protein
  kinases; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD2, superoxide
  dismutase 2; TP53BP1, tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1. p16INK4A, cyclin dependent
  kinase inhibitor 2A; AKT, protein kinase 3. Solid arrows represent known mechanisms;
  dashed arrows labeled with question marks represent unknown mechanisms.
