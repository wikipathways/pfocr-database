caption: 'Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway: After activation of the representative
  protein Wnt, the signal is forwarded through the cytoplasmic protein (GSK-3β, Axin,
  APC, β-catenin and etc) to activate the nuclear transcription factor(TCF-LEF). Thus,
  the level of E- cadherin in the cells was downregulated. TGF-β signaling pathway:
  The TGF-β ligand binds to the type II receptor dimer to form a heterotetramer complex.
  SARA recruits R-SMAD protein and binds R-SMAD protein to type I receptor. The type
  I receptor phosphorylates the serine residue of R-SMAD and separates it from the
  receptor complex and SARA. Phosphorylated R-SMAD binds to CoSMAD(SMAD4) and enters
  the nucleus, causing the level of E- cadherin in the cells was downregulated. PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway: PI3K/Akt signaling pathway can directly induce EMT, mainly by
  up regulating the expression of transcription factors (Snail, Slug, Twist, ZEB,
  etc), so as to down regulate the level of intracellular E-cadherin. Notch pathway:
  Notch signal is cleaved by γ-secretase during activation, releasing the activated
  form of Notch protein NICD. NICD enters the nucleus and binds to CSL protein to
  promote downstream gene expression, thereby promoting EMT.'
