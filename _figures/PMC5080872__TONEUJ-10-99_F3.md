caption: Functional implications of Cav2.3 R-type VGCC in cellular epileptiform activity,
  excitotoxicity and thetagenesis. Cav2.3 mediated Ca2+ influx triggers varies intracellular
  cascades. One cascade mediates the activation of cyclic-nucleotide gated channels
  leading to plateau potentials and superimposed bursting. Associated hyperexcitability
  and Ca2+ overload can result in excitotoxicity and neuronal apoptosis. Note that
  Cav2.3 Ca2+ channels are modulated by muscarinic signaling. The G αq11, DAG and
  PKC pathway was reported to be associated with thetagenesis as well (reprinted from
  []).
