caption: 'cGAS-STING pathway activation by replicative stress. Two different pathways
  can trigger cGAS-STING activation by replicative stress: (1) the formation of micronuclei
  and (2) the accumulation of replication fork-derived DNA in the cytoplasm. These
  events will trigger the activation of cGAS, which produces cGAMP, activating the
  STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING) protein. Once activated, STING recruits TBK1
  that is then able to phosphorylate its different targets that include Interferon
  Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3) and different members of the NF-κB signalling pathway.
  This culminates in an upregulation of pro-inflammatory factors.'
