caption: Candidate drugs for the inhibition of glucose metabolism and glucose transporters
  in breast cancer. Inhibitors for GLUT1 involved in glucose influx in glycolysis
  include WZB117, SFT-31, BAY-876, anti-GLUT1 antibody, and polyphenols such as resveratrol,
  hesperetin, quercetin, glabridin, EGCG, cantharidin, kudingcha, and vitamin D3.
  2-DG competes with glucose for binding GLUT1. Enzyme inhibitors for HK2 involved
  in glycolysis include 3-BrPA and methyl jasmonate, and resveratrol as PKF inhibitors;
  cyclosporine A as PKM2 inhibitor; and oxamate, gossypol, AT-101, and galloflavin
  as LDHA inhibitors. Enzyme inhibitors for G6PD involved in PPP include DHEA, 6-aminonicotinamide,
  and CB83 and oxythiamine as TKT inhibitor. In the serine and glycine pathway, PHGDH
  inhibitors include NCT-503, CBR-5884, PKUMDL-WQ-2101, PKUMDL-WQ-2201, and 15 fragments,
  and sertraline as SHMT inhibitors. HK, hexokinase; PKF, phosphofructokinase; PKM2,
  pyruvate kinase isozymes M2; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; G6PD, glucose 6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; TKT,
  transketolase; PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase.
