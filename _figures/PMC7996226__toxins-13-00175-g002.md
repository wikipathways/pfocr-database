caption: Intoxication pathways of cholera toxin (CT), heat-labile toxin (LT), Shiga
  toxin (Stx) and C. difficile toxins A and B (TcdA/TcdB). (A). TcdA/TcdB cytotoxicity
  pathways. After internalization through endocytosis, toxins reach acidified endosomes.
  Low pH induces structural conformations in the toxin delivery domain leading to
  pore formation and translocation of glucosyltransferase domain (GTD) into the host
  cytosol. Rho family proteins become inactivated when GTD transfers a glucose unit
  from uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose to the switch I region of GTPase, leading
  to pathogenic effects or cell death. (B) CT and LT cytotoxicity pathways. After
  endocytosis and travelling of CT and LT as holotoxins through the trans Golgi network
  (TGN) and the ER, their catalytic A1 subunit is cleaved and released inside the
  cytoplasm. Thereafter, the A1 fragment ADP-ribosylate the Gsα subunit of G-protein
  and consequently activates adenylyl cyclase (AC). Activation of AC leads to elevated
  levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) that activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA stimulates
  the secretion of Cl− through cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) but
  provokes the inhibition of Na+ absorption leading to the disturbance of cellular
  ionic balance, and ultimately apoptosis. (C) STa cytotoxicity pathway. STa binds
  to guanylate cyclase C (GC-C) receptor and activates its intracellular catalytic
  domain, which induces cyclic GMP (cGMP). Elevated levels of cGMP activate cAMP-dependent
  PKA and inhibit phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3). Subsequently, activated cAMP-dependent
  PKA along with PKGII, phosphorylate and open cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel. Through CFTR, Cl− and HCO3− are released in the intestinal
  lumen, while Na+ reabsorption is inhibited as PKA has the ability to block the NHE3
  channel. These modulating effects on the ionic channels induced by STa, finally
  result in an electrolyte imbalance that causes cell death. (D) Stx cytotoxicity
  pathway. Stx is internalized inside host cells (endocytosis) within early endosomes.
  Afterwards, Stx is following a retrograde transportation pathway, which is directed
  towards the transGolgi network (TGN) and subsequently reaches the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER). In the ER, the enzymatically active A1 fragment translocates into the cytoplasm.
  Thereafter, it cleaves one adenine residue from the 28S RNA of the ribosomal subunit
  and thus inhibits protein synthesis leading to cell death. Created with biorender.com
