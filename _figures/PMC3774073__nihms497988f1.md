caption: 'Aquaporin 2 recycling, including endocytosis and both constitutive and regulated
  exocytosisConstitutive exocytosis occurs independently of aquaporin 2 (AQP2) phosphorylation
  and involves recycling of AQP2 through a trans-Golgi or recycling endosome compartment.
  AQP2 membrane accumulation can be increased simply by inhibiting clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis. The regulated pathway occurs upon vasopressin (VP) interaction with
  its basolateral receptor (V2R), which increases cAMP formation after Gas stimulation
  of the adenylyl cyclase (AC). Protein kinase A (PKA) activation results in AQP2
  phosphorylation initially on residue S256. At some point, S261 is dephosphorylated
  and S264 and S269 phosphorylation is increased. AQP2 phosphorylation can also be
  increased by the cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) pathways, upon increased activity of
  the soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC) by, for example, nitric oxide (NO). Extracellular
  hypertonicity activates the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and JNK,
  ERK and p38 activities are all required for AQP2 surface accumulation after an acute
  hypertonic shock. During exocytosis, AQP2 interacts with SNARE proteins and their
  regulatory proteins such as Munc 18-2, and these interactions may be regulated by
  phosphorylation. Once at the cell surface, phosphorylated AQP2 resides in endocytosis-resistant
  domains, and its interaction with hsc70, a protein required for clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis, is inhibited. AQP2 that is not phosphorylated at S256 interacts strongly
  with hsc70 and this may be one of several protein–protein interactions that leads
  to AQP2 accumulation in clathrin-coated pits, followed by endocytosis. The myeloid
  and lymphocyte-associated protein (MAL) also is involved in AQP2 endocytosis by
  an as yet unknown mechanism. Endocytosis of AQP2 is also facilitated by protein
  kinase C (PKC) activation (but possibly not by direct phosphorylation of AQP2),
  as well as by activation of dopamine (DA, D1) and prostaglandin receptors (EP3,
  PGE2). Finally, the actin cytoskeleton is centrally involved in AQP2 trafficking:
  actin depolymerization alone results in cell surface accumulation of AQP2.'
