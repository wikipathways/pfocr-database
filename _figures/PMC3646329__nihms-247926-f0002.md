caption: 'Intratumoral hypoxia is found relatively frequently in NSCLC, and hypoxia
  --inducible factor (HIF) is a well-known regulator of VEGF levels. A number of other
  molecular alterations exist that probably lead to VEGF upregulation in NSCLC such
  as activation of the MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways via activating mutations of KRAS,
  EGFR and PI3K or loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN). A second common
  route to VEGF upregulation in NSCLC is activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) pathway. Activation of mTOR is known to increase HIF and VEGF levels both
  transcriptionally and translationally, and in NSCLC mTOR can be activated by loss
  of the tuberous sclerosis complex, deletion of PTEN, or via inactivating mutations
  of the LKB1 tumor suppressor gene. Activating events are shown in green. Loss of
  function events in blue. AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase.'
