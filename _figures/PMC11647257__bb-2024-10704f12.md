caption: 'C1QBP function as a ligand in cancer cell signaling pathway. C1QBP binds
  to αvβ3 integrin and recruits IκB kinase, which phosphorylates IκB, leading to the
  translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus. This promotes the expression of metalloproteinases,
  resulting in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and cancer cell invasion. C1QBP
  also phosphorylates receptor tyrosine kinases, activating the mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways.
  ERK facilitates the translocation of C1QBP to the nucleus, where it binds to PKC,
  activating PKC-dependent signaling, which is crucial for metastasis and the inhibition
  of apoptosis. In mitochondria, C1QBP enhances mitochondrial fusion, metabolism,
  and quality control, promoting tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and serving
  as a diagnostic marker. In immune cells, C1QBP increases oxidative phosphorylation,
  fatty acid metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum expansion. These processes contribute
  to T cell differentiation, adaptation to the tumor microenvironment (TME), dendritic
  cell maturation, T cell infiltration, and antitumor mechanisms. Targeting C1QBP
  through CAR T cell therapy is a promising approach for cancer treatment. Additionally,
  nanoparticle drugs such as CGKRK and C1QBP-binding peptide inhibitors are potential
  therapeutic targets. C1QBP: Complement C1q-binding protein'
