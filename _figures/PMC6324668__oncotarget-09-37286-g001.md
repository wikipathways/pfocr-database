caption: 'The chemical structures of the clinical indenoisoquinoline derivatives,
  LMP400, LMP776 and LMP744 are shown at the top left. The camptothecin derivatives
  are shown at the right. Camptothecins are active in the lactone form and are readily
  inactivated at physiological pH in the blood and tissues by E-ring hydrolysis to
  the ring-open carboxylate form, which is sequestered by albumin. Middle: both the
  indenoisoquinolines and camptothecins trap TOP1 cleavage complexes (TOP1cc) by binding
  at the enzyme-DNA interface. Trapped TOP1cc induce the rapid degradation of TOP1
  by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and engage the chromatin response by phosphorylation
  of histone H2AX (γH2AX). TOP1cc are excised by TDP1 (tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase)
  and the endonuclease XPF-ERCC1. The primary cytotoxic lesions in cancer cells result
  from collisions between the trapped TOP1cc and replication forks. These collisions
  are repaired by engaging HDR (homology directed repair) and activating ATR (Ataxia
  Telangiectasia related) kinase and PARP (poly[ADPribose]polymerase). Replication
  collisions also activate the cell death pathways by engaging p53 (TP53) and Schlafen
  11 (SLFN11).'
