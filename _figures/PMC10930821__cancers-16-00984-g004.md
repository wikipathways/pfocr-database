caption: 'A model for the interaction of drug resistance-related factors in drug-resistant
  cancer cells. (A) Altered signaling pathways for apoptotic cell death mediated by
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein 1 (AP-1) and mutant p53 (mp53) in
  lymphoblastic leukemia cells with atypical multidrug resistance (at-MDR). at-MDR
  is defined by the mutation and reduced expression of topoisomerase IIα (Topo IIα)
  without drug efflux pump overexpression. Teniposide (VM-26) treatment suppresses
  c-Jun/AP-1 activation in proportion to the degree of drug resistance. Activated
  AP-1 consists of a c-Jun/Fra-1 dimer in drug-sensitive cells and c-Jun/Fra-2 and,
  to a lesser extent, c-Jun/Fra-1 dimers in drug-resistant cells. mp53 induction is
  more stable and the DNA damage-induced p53 response is attenuated after VM-26 treatment
  in resistant cells compared with those in sensitive cells. In resistant cells, alterations
  in apoptotic cell death signaling pathways and target enzymes are regulated independently.
  (B) Alteration of apoptotic cell death signaling pathways upon the reduction in
  the proapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-xS in ABCC1/multidrug resistance
  protein (MRP)-overexpressing epidermoid carcinoma cells. The introduction of Bcl-xS
  promotes apoptotic cell death and partially restores drug sensitivity in resistant
  cells without affecting the reduction in drug accumulation. The attenuation of the
  apoptotic cell death pathway via the reduction in Bcl-xS expression and drug accumulation
  by MRP are regulated independently in resistant cells. Abbreviations: DOX, doxorubicin;
  VCR, vincristine. This figure was custom-made by Wiley Editing Services based on
