caption: One pathway for ammonium (green boxes) assimilation is the amination of the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate 2-ketoglutarate by GDH to form glutamate
  (blue arrow). A second pathway requires joint action of GS and GOGAT, which first
  aminate glutamate to form glutamine (GS), which donates one amine to 2-ketoglutarate
  (GOGAT) to form two glutamate molecules, which further provide amines (green circles)
  for biosynthesis of amino acids and other nitrogenous compounds (pink arrows). Growth
  of the glutamate auxotrophic (glut-aux) strain deleted in GDH and GOGAT (red crosses)
  by a supplemented amine source is possible via the following mechanisms. The amine
  donor either (I) replaces glutamate as an amine source for the production of amino
  acids and nitrogenous compounds, (II) donates an amine to 2-ketoglutarate to form
  glutamate, (III) is converted to an intermediate donating an amine to 2-ketoglutarate,
  or (IV) is metabolically converted into glutamate. Green arrows indicate these cases.
