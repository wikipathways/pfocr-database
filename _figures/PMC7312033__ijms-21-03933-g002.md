caption: Effects of IL-33, as pro-inflammatory and regulatory, on the central nervous
  system, liver, cardiovascular system, and pulmonary system. Following activation
  of the IL-33 pathway, and subsequent activation of NF-κB, JNK, and ERK/MAPK pathways,
  a pro-inflammatory response is initiated. This pro-inflammatory response results
  in the release of cytokines, including IL-3, IL-4, and IL-5. These cytokines act
  on target cells within the central nervous, hepatic, cardiovascular, and pulmonary
  systems. Within the central nervous system, activated oligodendrocytes, astrocytes,
  microglia, and neurons induce pro-inflammatory or regulatory effects. In the liver,
  activated macrophages and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) induce pro-inflammatory
  effects, while FoxP3+ Tregs induce regulatory effects. In the heart, cardiac endothelial
  cells induce pro-inflammatory or regulatory effects. In the pulmonary system, pulmonary
  endothelial cells and M2 macrophages induce pro-inflammatory and regulatory effects.
