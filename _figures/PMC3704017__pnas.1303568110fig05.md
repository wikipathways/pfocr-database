caption: Revised biosynthesis of dehydrophos. (A) Proposed model for the biosynthesis
  of dehydrophos based on precedent in dehydroalanine formation. (B) Proposed model
  for the biosynthesis of dehydrophos based on the in vitro biochemical analysis of
  DhpD, DhpH, DhpK, and DhpJ. (C) Alternative mechanism for the PLP domain of DhpH.
  A single capital letter denotes proteins participating in the DHP biosynthesis.
  Capital letters X and Y denote hypothetical proteins that are not present in the
  DHP biosynthetic gene cluster.
