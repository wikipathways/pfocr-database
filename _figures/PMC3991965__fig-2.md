caption: Supported cell signaling cascades for activation of immediate early genes
  following prostaglandin analogue treatment. Ligand binding to prostaglandin receptor
  (PR) activates G-protein-dependent (Gαq) and -independent (Gαi) pathways. Activation
  of Gαq-dependent pathway results in increased intracellular calcium stores and protein
  kinase C (PKC) induction leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway. The Gαi-independent pathway leads to activation of Rho signaling.
  PR activation can also lead to phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)-dependent transactivation
  of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) followed by MAPK and β-catenin activation.
  MAPK, Rho, and translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus induce gene expression
  of immediate early genes (eg, early growth response-1) and molecules involved in
  cell migration and cytoskeleton remodeling. TF, transcription factor; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  IP3, inositol triphosphate.
