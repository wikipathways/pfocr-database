caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analyses: Pathway analyses were from the commercially
  available Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Input was the top 100 up- and top
  100-downregulated probes ordered by fold change. Three networks were significantly
  enriched. Up-regulated probes are in red whereas down-regulated probes are in green.
  The network 2 shown here was defined as “Neurological disease, organ injury, inflammatory
  disease”. Canonical pathways identified by the pattern of gene expression are shown
  in the long ovals labeled “CP” in pink. These included a large number of G-protein
  coupled receptors. Associated disease states are also in long ovals labeled “Fx”
  in green. A number of disorders related to anxiety, addiction and stress were significantly
  over-represented (social anxiety; “ptsd”).'
