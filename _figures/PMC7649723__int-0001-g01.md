caption: 'SARS-CoV-2 replication. The viral cycle begins with the interaction between
  the viral spike and the cellular receptor. Several membrane proteins have been proposed
  as possible receptors for SARS-CoV-2; however, ACE2 is likely to be the most important
  one []. After the viral spike has interacted with the receptor, the virus gains
  entry into the host cytosol by two mechanisms: (1) by late endocytosis, releasing
  the viral RNA after the fusion with the lysosome (this entry is blocked by HCQ),
  or (2) by early endocytosis by fusion of the viral and host membrane without the
  participation of the lysosome. In these early stages, the priming processing by
  cellular proteases is the key for the exposure of the viral fusion motive. TMPRSS2
  could act in both early and late endosome entry processes and could be inhibited
  by benzoic acid derivatives such as nafamostat, camostat, and bromhexine [, ]. Furthermore,
  other proteases such as cathepsin B could mediate the entry in the late lysosomal
  pathway, while only TMPRSS2 has been related to the early entry endosome [, , ,

  reading frame 1 (ORF1) is translated to produce the RdRp. Subgenomic mRNAs are produced
  by discontinuous transcription, a process characteristic of this RdRp, which favors
  recombination. Compounds such as remdesivir, favipiravir, and sofosbuvir block this
  enzyme [, , , ]. The subgenomic mRNAs are then translated into protein. The genome
