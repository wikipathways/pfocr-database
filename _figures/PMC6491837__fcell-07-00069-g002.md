caption: Positive and negative feedback signals for neuronal polarization. (A) Overview
  of positive (red arrows) and negative (blue arrows) feedback signaling that is responsible
  for neuronal polarization. Neurotrophins, TGF-β, Wnt5A, and TAG1 activate the Rac1/PI3-kinase/PIP3/Cdc42/Par
  complex/RacGEFs (STEF/Tiam) pathway that acts as a positive feedback loop underlying
  axon specification and MP-to-BP transition (red arrows). Neurotrophins induce Ras
  activation and thereby activate PI3-kinase. Ras also activates ERK1/2 through Raf/MEK
  pathway, and ERK1/2 regulates the selective transport of the Par complex to the
  nascent axon. TGF-β induces the phosphorylation of Par6, which is required for axon
  formation. Wnt5A activates aPKC through Dvl and promotes axon specification. TAG1
  induces Rac1 activation through the Src family kinase Lyn. Rac1 regulates actin
  polymerization through PAK1-mediated phosphorylation of Shootin 1 and the Sra-1/WAVE
  complex during neuronal polarization. Rac1/PI3-kinase/PIP3/Cdc42/Par complex/RacGEFs
  (STEF/Tiam) pathway also activates CRMP-2 through Akt/GSK-3β pathway. CRMP-2 modulates
  microtubule stabilization, endocytosis, selective transport and actin filament dynamics
  through its binding to tubulin, Numb, the kinesin light chain subunit of kinesin-1,
  and Sra-1. Neurotrophins activate cAMP/PKA/LKB1/SAD-A/B kinases pathway, which regulates
  microtubule dynamics through the phosphorylation of Tau. Neurotrophins also induce
  Ca2+/CaMKK/CaMKI/GEF-H1/RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway that acts as a negative feedback
  signaling for preventing multiple axonal formation (blue arrows). N-cadherin activates
  RhoA/Rho-kinase. Rho-kinase maintains RhoA activation through inactivation of p190RhoGAP.
  Rho-kinase regulates actin filament dynamics and microtubule stabilization through
  MLC, LIM-kinase, and CRMP-2. Rho-kinase can inactivate Rac1 through the disruption
  of the Par complex and inactivation of Rac GEF (STEF). Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) suppresses
  axon formation through cGMP/PKG pathway. (B) In unpolarized neurons, the positive,
  and negative feedback signals are balanced in all minor neurites (red and blue arrows).
  When the balance is upset by the local amplification of neurotrophins, the Rac1/PI3-kinase/PIP3/Cdc42/Par
  complex/RacGEFs pathway is continuously activated within one minor neurite and thereby
  induces axon specification and elongation (red arrows). Concurrently, the long-range
  Ca2+ waves are propagated from the nascent axon to the cell body. The Ca2+ waves
  activate the CaMKI/GEF-H1/RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway, which represses the positive
  feedback loop in all minor neurites to prevent the formation of multiple axons and
  determine dendritic specification (blue arrows).

  description: Positive and negative feedback signals for neuronal polarization. (A)
    Overview of positive (red arrows) and negative (blue arrows) feedback signaling
    that is responsible for neuronal polarization. Neurotrophins, TGF-β, Wnt5A, and
    TAG1 activate the Rac1/PI3-kinase/PIP3/Cdc42/Par complex/RacGEFs (STEF/Tiam) pathway
    that acts as a positive feedback loop underlying axon specification and MP-to-BP
    transition (red arrows). Neurotrophins induce Ras activation and thereby activate
    PI3-kinase. Ras also activates ERK1/2 through Raf/MEK pathway, and ERK1/2 regulates
    the selective transport of the Par complex to the nascent axon. TGF-β induces
    the phosphorylation of Par6, which is required for axon formation. Wnt5A activates
    aPKC through Dvl and promotes axon specification. TAG1 induces Rac1 activation
    through the Src family kinase Lyn. Rac1 regulates actin polymerization through
    PAK1-mediated phosphorylation of Shootin 1 and the Sra-1/WAVE complex during neuronal
    polarization. Rac1/PI3-kinase/PIP3/Cdc42/Par complex/RacGEFs (STEF/Tiam) pathway
    also activates CRMP-2 through Akt/GSK-3β pathway. CRMP-2 modulates microtubule
    stabilization, endocytosis, selective transport and actin filament dynamics through
    its binding to tubulin, Numb, the kinesin light chain subunit of kinesin-1, and
    Sra-1. Neurotrophins activate cAMP/PKA/LKB1/SAD-A/B kinases pathway, which regulates
