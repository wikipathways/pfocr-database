caption: 'Scenario for the application of minimal cut sets. (A) Reaction network under
  consideration, which is supplied with acetate and glutamate. It is assumed that
  the production of histidine should be prevented. Histidine is produced from the
  central metabolism intermediate ribose-5 phosphate (). Assuming that it is not possible
  to entirely knock out the reactions r17 and r18 that directly produce ribose-5 phosphate,
  the reactions r10–r15 are defined as alternative targets (black reactions). (B)
  In order to determine minimal cut sets, r10–r15 are added to the subsystem containing
  the outflow reaction of histidine. From the elementary flux patterns, the minimal
  cut sets can be obtained. (C) Minimal sets of reactions that need to be knocked
  out to suppress the production of histidine: (black crosses) MCS1; (dark gray crosses)
  MCS2; (light gray crosses) MCS3. Subsequently, the minimal cut sets can be ranked
  according to different criteria, like side effects or required effort to knock out
  the corresponding genes, to determine the optimal knockout strategy. A list of abbreviations
  can be found in Supplemental material S2.'
