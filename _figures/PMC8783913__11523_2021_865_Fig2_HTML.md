caption: Potential mechanism of ALK involvement in D2R internalization. Prolonged
  exposure to dopamine (DA) desensitizes dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) promoting recovery
  of firing dopaminergic neurons. D2R desensitization mechanism involves anaplastic
  lymphoma kinase (ALK) through its transactivation and association with D2R; in particular,
  phosphorylated ALK binds to phospholipase C (PLC) and promotes, in a downstream
  pathway mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), internalization of the D2R and subsequent
  lysosomal degradation. Blocking activation of ALK inhibits endocytosis of D2R and
  recovery of firing dopaminergic neurons. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic
  agent, and its activity is achieved by the antagonism of multiple neuronal receptors,
  including D2R. DAG diacylglycerol
