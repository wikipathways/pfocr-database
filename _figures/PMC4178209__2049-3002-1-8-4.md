caption: 'Role of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2)/fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase)-2
  in the balance between glycolytic flux and redox regulation. Glucose-6-phosphate
  fulfills glycolysis, glycogen synthesis and pentose phosphate pathways. The scheme
  shows how the PFK-2 or the FBPase-2 activity could be crucial in controlling the
  balance between glycolytic flux and redox regulation by the pentose phosphate pathway
  for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production. Enzymes: phosphofructokinase
  (PFK-1), phosphofructokinase 2/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2), TIGAR
  (FBPase-2 activity). Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is an activator of PFK-1 and inhibitor
  of FBPase.'
