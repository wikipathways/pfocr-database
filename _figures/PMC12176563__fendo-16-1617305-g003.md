caption: Multimodal regulation of cardiac metabolic flux and enzymatic hierarchy.
  (A) Disordered Glucose Metabolism. (B) Lipid Metabolism Disorder. (C) Ketone Metabolism.
  Figure 3 delineates the multimodal regulation of cardiac metabolic flux and enzymatic
  hierarchy. Panel (A) illustrates abnormal partitioning of glycolytic intermediates
  under pathological stress, including diversion into the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), driven by impaired mitochondrial
  pyruvate uptake via MPC1/MPC2 defects. Panel (B) depicts lipid overload from PPARα/γ
  hyperactivation, leading to lipotoxic intermediate accumulation (e.g., ceramides)
  that activate PKCθ/JNK signaling, insulin resistance, and myocardial fibrosis, alongside
  endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-mediated regulation of lipid-metabolizing enzymes.
  Panel (C) highlights upregulated ketone utilization in heart failure (e.g., SLC16A1-mediated
  ketone uptake and BDH1 elevation), despite inefficiencies from low P/O ratios and
  competition with glucose oxidation
