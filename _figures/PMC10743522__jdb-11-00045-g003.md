caption: 'Summary of the signaling pathways regulated by phase separation during development.
  (Left): Hippo signaling pathway regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival,
  including in many stem cells. Mechanoregulation, polarity complexes, and GPCR signaling
  are upstream regulatory signals modulating Hippo activity. Hippo (Mst1/2) signaling
  is a phosphorylation cascade that inactivates STRIPAK. This leads to the phosphorylation
  of YAP/TAZ by LATS1/2, thereby preventing the nuclear translocation of the transcriptional
  regulator. Partitioning of Mst1/2 and STRIPAK to distinct condensates prevents YAP/TAZ
  phosphorylation, leading to the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation
  of target genes. (Right): Wnt signaling also plays a critical role in development
  and occurs through binding to the frizzled receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptor (‘Active’).
  Wnt pathway activation is facilitated by the formation of β-catenin signalosome
  condensates consisting of disheveled, GSK/CK1 kinases, APC, and axin. This complex
  causes the stabilization of β-catenin by preventing its phosphorylation and allowing
  its nuclear translocation for the activation of target genes. The absence of Wnt
  (‘Inactive’) promotes the phosphorylation of β-catenin within distinct condensates
  containing a destruction complex composed of active GSK/CK1 kinases, APC, axin,
  and β-catenin. Phosphorylated β-catenin is targeted for proteasomal degradation'
