caption: The HIF degradation pathway. In normoxia the hydroxylases (PHDs and FIH)
  use O2 to hydroxylate HIF-1α in the Oxygen Dependent Degradation Domain (ODDD) and
  the C-Terminal Activation Domain (CTAD). Hydroxylation in the ODDD targets HIF-1α
  for ubiquitination by the VHL containing E3 ligase complex and HIF-1α is then degraded
  by the proteasome. In moderate hypoxia the PHDs are inhibited causing HIF-1α accumulation
  and its dimerisation with HIF-1β. Further decreases in oxygen cause FIH inhibition
  and subsequent interaction of the HIF-1α-CTAD with co-activators such as p300/CBP.
