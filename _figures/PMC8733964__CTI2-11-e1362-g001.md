caption: Schematic representation of the PLK1/mTOR signalling pathway. Phosphorylated
  Aurora‐A is elevated in murine lupus, which is highly conducive to the activation
  of PLK1. Activation of the PLK1 on Thr 210 regulates downstream mTOR association
  with a regulatory‐associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR; a required component of mTORC1),
  but not the rapamycin‐insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR; a required component
  of mTORC2). Activated 4E‐BP1 is also a consequence of downstream mTORC1 mediated
  response to PLK1 regulation. Given that all of the above changes are observed in
  murine lupus, and the observation that PLK1 inhibition ameliorates systemic and
  renal lupus in mice, the pathogenic cascade shown is likely to be central in lupus
  pathogenesis.
