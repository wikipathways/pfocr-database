caption: Core signaling pathways in skin stem cell niche. The schematic diagram emphasizes
  the core signaling pathways, demonstrating their role in orchestrating the physiological
  development of skin stem cells. Notably, Notch signaling promotes epidermal differentiation
  while also exerting negative control on Wnt and Shh signaling pathways to prevent
  unregulated epidermal proliferation. Under normal circumstances, the activity of
  YAP/TAZ is constrained by the Hippo pathway, accompanied by adherens junctions,
  which enhance the formation of the 14–3-3-YAP complex, leading to proteasomal degradation
  of YAP. Furthermore, α-catenin in adherens junctions binds to β-catenin, impeding
  its nuclear translocation of β-catenin, consequently inhibiting skin stem cell differentiation
  and maintaining the skin stem cell compartment. SMO, smoothened; PTCH, Patched;
