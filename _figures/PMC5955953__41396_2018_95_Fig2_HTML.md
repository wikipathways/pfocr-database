caption: 'Thiamine-related genes and reactions. a Overview of the thiamine biosynthesis
  pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on Ref. [], and as included in the KEGG
  metabolic pathways (Pathway: sce00730) []. Yellow boxes indicate genes encoding
  for the enzymes in the corresponding reactions. Red borders indicate genes for which
  there are S. cerevisiae homologs in S. indica (see Methods). b Simplified schematic
  of central metabolism in eukaryotic cells with cytosol and mitochondria compartments
  indicated. Orange enclosures show reactions of the central metabolism, while blue
  boxes show essential enzymes catalyzing these reactions and requiring ThPP as a
  co-factor (shown in green). Green oval indicates ThPP . Red boxes indicate the positions
  inside a cell'
