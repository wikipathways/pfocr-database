caption: Under normal conditions, an acute stressor will signal the paraventricular
  nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus to release corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)
  into the hypophyseal portal veins, which causes the anterior pituitary gland to
  release adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). Circulating ACTH signals the adrenal
  cortex to release glucocorticoids (GC) that have downstream metabolic effects. A
  negative feedback loop is established to turn off activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  (HPA) axis by suppressing the production of CRF and ACTH upon cessation of the initial
  stressor. The hippocampus and the amygdala play inhibitory and excitatory roles
  in regulation of the HPA axis, respectively. CRF released upon HPA axis activation
  also has peripheral effects. Mast cells (MC) can become activated by CRF, causing
  the release of cytokines and growth factors that have reciprocal interactions with
  peripheral nociceptors. Nociceptor activation signals through the dorsal horn of
  the spinal cord, leading to activation of supraspinal somatosensory brain regions.
  The descending pain pathway also plays a role in the regulation of painful experiences.
