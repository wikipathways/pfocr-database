caption: Proposed signaling pathway for SesA. Blue light irradiation photoconverts
  the Pb form of SesA into the Pg form, which catalyzes the formation of c-di-GMP
  from two GTP molecules via its diguanylate cyclase activity. When Tll007 binds c-di-GMP
  at its PilZ domain, it then acts as a cellulose synthase. Extracellular cellulose
  accumulation results in cell aggregation.
