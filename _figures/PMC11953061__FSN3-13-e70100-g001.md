caption: The protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of reproducible and differentially
  expressed proteins (RDEPs) were generated via the STRING database. The PPI networks
  of the (a) reproducible and up‐regulated proteins (RUPs) with two distinct clusters
  and (b) reproducible and down‐regulated proteins (RDPs) with three distinct clusters.
  Among the RUP proteins, the red module represents proteins involved in the FoxO
  signaling pathway, while the green module represents proteins involved in apoptosis.
  Among the RDP proteins, the red module represents proteins involved in the TNF signaling
  pathway, the green module represents proteins involved in the PI3k/Akt signaling
  pathway, and the turquoise module represents proteins involved in cell cycle regulation.
  All modules were populated using the k‐mean clustering option and the highest confidence
  score (0.9) in the STRING database. Each node represents a protein with its corresponding
  gene ID labeled. Filled nodes indicate proteins with known/predicted 3D structures.
  The edges between nodes represent their respective interactions, whereas the edges
  indicate known or predicted interactions
