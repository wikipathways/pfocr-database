caption: (A) Canonical Wnt Signaling. Without activation of the Wnt ligand, β-catenin
  interacts with a complex consisting of Axin, APC, and GSK3β and is targeted for
  destruction. With Wnt ligand stimulation, β-catenin is allowed to accumulate in
  the cytosol and translocate into nucleus. In the nucleus, it forms a transcriptional
  activation complex with TCF7L2 to promote transcription of genes involved in proliferation
  and patterning. (B) The interaction of aspirin with Wnt signaling. Aspirin interacts
  at numerous levels to inhibit Wnt signaling, including the COX-2/PGE2Pathway and
  the β-catenin destruction complex.
