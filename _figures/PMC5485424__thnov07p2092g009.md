caption: Schematic model of BRAFV600E signaling-induced epigenetic silencing by H3K27me3
  in tumorigenesis. BRAFV600E mutation constitutively activates the MAPK/Erk signaling,
  resulting in upregulation of its downstream effector c-Myc in many types of cancer
  particularly thyroid cancer and melanoma. In general, c-Myc is degraded via the
  ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, this process can be inhibited by activated
  PI3K/Akt pathway in cancer cells. When c-Myc translocates into the nucleus, it regulates
  the expression of its target genes through binding to their regulatory elements
  via interaction with its obligate partner MAX or other unknown mechanisms. In the
  present study, c-Myc regulates the expression of the PRC2 components, contributing
  to epigenetic silencing through two distinct mechanisms. First, c-Myc transcriptionally
  regulates the expression of the PRC2 components through binding to the regulatory
  elements within their promoters. Second, c-Myc transcriptionally represses the expression
  of a panel of miRNAs, whereas some of them target and regulate the expression of
  the PRC2 components at post-transcriptional levels. In addition, BRAFV600E signaling
  also induces epigenetic silencing through Erk1/2-induced RNAPII poising and chromatin
  architecture.
