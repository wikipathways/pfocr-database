caption: Differentially accumulated proteins in starch biosynthetic pathway in taproot
  of Brassica napus between the beginning (T0) and the end (T1) of vernalization.
  The blue to red scale is related to the Log2Fc of the down‐ and up‐accumulated enzymes
  (identified by their Uniprot ID), respectively. Metabolites experimentally measured
  to accumulate during vernalization are indicated in solid green background. Metabolic
  pathway was adapted from KEGG database
