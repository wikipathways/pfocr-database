caption: (A) Stabilization of receptor by ligand-binding is demonstrated by the shift
  in the melt curve, and ligand-induced protein-protein interaction results in the
  formation of a more stable complex that unfolds cooperatively with a Tm higher than
  that of both individual proteins. (B) A SnRK2-MBP fusion protein exhibits a bi-phasic
  melt curve, of which only the transition curve corresponding to untagged SnRK2 shifts
  in the presence of SnRK2 inhibitors.
