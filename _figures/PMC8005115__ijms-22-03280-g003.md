caption: Primary and secondary biogenesis of piRNAs in model Drosophila melanogaster
  germline cells. The piRNA precursors can be transcribed from uni-strand and dual-strand
  piRNA clusters by polymerase II. Majority of these precursors are antisense (5′-3′)
  relative to transposon transcripts. Export from nucleus to processing sites is mediated
  by UAP-56 activity. The piRNA precursors are resolved by Armitage (armi) RNA helicase
  after export, and this leads to their unwinding. The 5′end processing is then mediated
  by the Zucchini mitochondria-associated nuclease (ZUC). ZUC action transforms the
  piRNA precursors into pre-piRNAs which are subsequently loaded into Piwi or AUB
  protein complexes. Here, fragments with Uracil bias at the 5′end are primarily selected.
  The overhanging 3′end is trimmed with 3′ to 5′ Nibbler exonuclease (Nib), Hen1 then
  methylates the 3′end and the piRNAs are then mature. piRNAs loaded into the Piwi
  protein are then involved in transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in the nucleus.
  In contrast, the Aub–piRNA complex triggers the ping-pong amplification pathway
  by recognising and cleaving transposon mRNA. The product of this cleavage is converted
  into new sense oriented piRNA (secondary piRNA) which has a 10A bias, and this is
  subsequently loaded into the Ago3 protein complex and trimmed and methylated. The
  Ago3-piRNa complex similarly recognises and cleaves the anti-sense cluster transcript,
  and the product of this cleavage re-initiates the cycle. This provides one-cycle
  transposon sequence cleavage and simultaneous amplification of the piRNA sequence.
  The ping-pong amplification is therefore a mechanism of post-transcriptional gene
  silencing (PTSG).
