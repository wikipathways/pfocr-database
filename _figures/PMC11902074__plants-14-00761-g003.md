caption: Visualization of the Specific Gene Locations Identified in the AA and BB
  Genomes. Specific genes within the AA and BB genomes were identified using BLASTn,
  and the positions of homologous genes flanking these specific genes in both genomes
  are displayed. This figure demonstrates the accuracy of specific gene identification
  and indicates that these specific genes arise due to insertion and deletion mutations.
  (a–d) Panels illustrate specific genes in the hormone signaling pathways, including
  Macma4_04_g11940 (MJ_GID2), Macma4_06_g14450 (MJ_ ARF), Macma4_07_g28170 (MJ_IAA)
  in the A genome compared to the B genome, Macma4_02_g00180 (MJ_CALM) in the MAPK
  signaling pathway, Macma4_08_g22960 (MJ_EIN3), and Macma4_04_g24700 (MJ_CISZOG)
  in the zeatin biosynthesis pathway (e), as well as the specific gene Mba10_g12780
  (MJ_PYL) in the BB genome (f)
