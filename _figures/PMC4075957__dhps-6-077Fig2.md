  MAPK signaling by monomeric mutant BRAF (BRAFV600) is blocked by BRAF-specific inhibition
  using a selective BRAF inhibitor such as vemurafenib or dabrafenib. (B) In normal
  and tumor RAF wild-type cells, BRAF specific inhibition leads to paradoxic upregulation
  of the MAPK pathway. In these cells RAS activity is high, leading to RAF homodimerization
  or heterodimerization (eg, BRAF: BRAF, BRAF: CRAF, etc). BRAF-specific inhibition
  results in transactivation of the homodimeric or heterodimeric binding partner and
  increased downstream MAPK signaling.Abbreviations: ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
