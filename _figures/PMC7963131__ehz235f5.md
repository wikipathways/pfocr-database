caption: Multicompartmental metabolic network characterizing subclinical atherosclerosis.
  Metabolites highlighted in strong colours passed the multiple testing correction
  in MESA (1.8 × 10−5) and were replicated in independent populations (the Rotterdam
  Study and LOLIPOP) for Model 1 (adjusted for age, sex, cohort, and ethnicity) in
  relation to coronary artery calcium and/or intima-media thickness. Nodes and edges
  in the graph represent metabolites and reactions from the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of
  Genes and Genomes. Metabolites from Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes are
  included in the ‘metabonetwork’ if they were present on the set of shortest paths
  between the metabolites associated with coronary artery calcium/intima-media thickness.
  The direction of association between metabolites and coronary artery calcium/intima-media
  thickness is illustrated in the graph by the orange (direct) and blue (inverse)
  colours, and was consistent within each pathway. Full names of abbreviations are
  listed in the , .
