caption: A model of leptin action on the TRH neuron. Shown is a proposed model of
  leptin action on the TRH neuron. After crossing the blood-brain barrier leptin can
  act either directly on the TRH neuron or via an indirect pathway by increasing the
  production of α-MSH in the POMC neuron in the arcuate nucleus. Also shown are the
  inputs of AGRP and NPY, both of which are known to project to the TRH neuron. Leptin,
  through the phosphorylation of Stat3, can directly activate the TRH promoter as
  can α-MSH through the activation of CREB. T3 can inhibit TRH gene expression, principally
  through the TRβ2 isoform. NPYR1/5, NPY receptor 1 or 5.
