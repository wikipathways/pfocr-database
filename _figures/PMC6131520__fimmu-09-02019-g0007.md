caption: Proposed cytokine signaling pathway triggered by internalized free IgG antibody.
  The 3D8 IgG-N434D mutant, which is not recognized by TRIM21, induces human monocytes
  to produce more IL-8 and TNF-α than cells exposed to wt 3D8 IgG. An as-yet-unknown
  cytosolic Fc sensor may be responsible for cytokine signaling triggered by entry
  of free IgG to the cytosol.
