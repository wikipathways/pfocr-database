caption: MYOCD and SRF hypothesis of AD arterial pathology. High levels of SRF-MYOCD
  in AD VSMC contribute to brain hypoperfusion (white pathway) by increasing the expression
  of contractile proteins, such as smooth muscle (SM) α-actin, calponin, and myosin
  heavy chain (MHC) and by increasing the expression of genes that regulate calcium
  homeostasis. This leads to arterial hypercontractility, reduced resting cerebral
  blood flow (CBF) and attenuated CBF responses to brain activation, which ultimately
  creates a chronic hypoperfusion state. Furthermore, SRF-MYOCD potentiate CAA and
  focal brain Aβ accumulation (yellow pathway) via CArG-box dependent activation of
  SREBP2, which acts as transcriptional suppressor of LRP, a key Aβ clearance receptor
