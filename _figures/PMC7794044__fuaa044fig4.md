caption: 'Signalling pathways activated by peptidoglycan upon stimulation of NOD-like
  receptors. The canonical pathway of muropeptide-mediated NOD1/NOD2 activation ultimately
  culminates with the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and the expression
  of its target genes. The NOD1 or NOD2 CARD domains interact first through homotypic
  CARD-CARD interactions with the CARD-containing kinase RIPK2/RICK. The NBDs recruit
  additional players, including proteins that regulate the ubiquitination-mediated
  signal transduction cascade that leads NF-κB activation. These players may either
  positively (e.g. TRAF6, cIAP1 and 2) or negatively (e.g. Caspase 12, A20) modulate
  NOD receptor activation and subsequent signalling. In response to their muropeptide
  ligands, NOD1 and NOD2 activation can also signal through RIPK2/RICK-independent
  mechanisms. RIPK2/RICK-independent signalling occurs downstream of NOD2 activation
  upon binding to CARD9. Whilst this leads to the activation of MAPKs, other RIPK2/RICK-independent
  pathways exist which do not result in the activation of either MAPKs, NF-κB or IRF7.
  In this case, NOD1 and NOD2 interact with other NLRs. For instance, NOD2 has been
  shown to specifically and directly interact with and drive downstream signalling
  via NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRP12. Interaction of NOD2 with NLRP3 activates ASC, which
  in turn activates caspase 1 and leads to the production of IL-1β. Similarly, NOD1
  recruitment to the membrane is accompanied by ATG16L1 recruitment and activation,
  which in turn leads to activation of the autophagy process (which may be RIPK2/RICK-dependent
  or independent). Hexokinase is an enzyme that participates in glycolysis by catalyzing
  the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. N-acetylglucosamine generated
  by peptidoglycan degradation (likely within endosomes/lysosomes) binds mitochondrial
  outer membrane-associated hexokinase (H), inducing its release and the liberation
  of its interacting partners (e.g. voltage-dependent anion channel VDAC, Akt). Following
  a multistep process that involves (among other events) the release of mitochondrial
  DNA, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated, pro caspase-1 converted into caspase-1,
  and pro Il-1β converted into active IL-1β. This hexokinase-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation is independent of NOD1 and NOD2 receptors. A20: alpha-induced protein
  3; ASC: apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD; ATG16L1: autophagy
  related 16 like 1; cIAP: cellular inhibitor of apoptosis; eRK: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; IRF7: interferon regulatory transcription factor 7; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB: nuclear factor-kappa B; NLRP:
  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain
