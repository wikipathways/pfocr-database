caption: 'Siglec-15 affects four key areas: bone metabolism, modulates infections
  caused by pathogenic microorganisms, immune regulation, and the pathogenesis of
  hematologic diseases. In bone metabolism, Siglec-15 interacts with CD44 expressed
  on osteoclast precursors to stimulate the DAP12-SYK pathway and RANKL-RANK-TRAF6
  signaling cascade, activating ERK and PI3K-AKT activation. It also been shown to
  be activated by microbial agents, thereby associating with unidentified receptors
  on T cells to regulate cytokine release and phagocytic activity to regulate immune
  responses. In immune functions, Siglec-15 expressed on tumor-associated macrophages
  and/or cancer cells interacts with unknown receptors on T cells, inhibiting T cell
  proliferation. Elevated levels of TGF-β and/or IL-10 further inhibits T cell activation.
  Studies have also demonstrated thatSiglec-15 is expressed on hematological tumor
  cells where is interacts with enigmatic receptors on T cells, modulating immune
  responses via the NF-kB signaling pathway. It exists as a soluble form in the bloodstream,
  contributing to diverse immune reactions in the body'
