caption: 'Model of the interplay between the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), SHH and
  transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway during embryonic lung branching morphogenesis
  and fibrogenesis in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). a) Model
  of the interactions between the mesothelial, mesenchymal and epithelial cells during
  lung pseudoglandular stage. The arrow shows the interactions between the different
  genes of interest. Transcription factors are in blue. The dashed arrows depict the
  biological effects of these genes of interest. Note the negative regulation of GLI
  by TGF-β receptors in the light green box. See the main text for further details.
  Haematoxylin eosin staining of a mouse embryonic mouse lung at E14.5 during the
  pseudoglandular stage is shown. Scale bar=80 µm. b) Model of the interactions between
  the mesothelial, mesenchymal and epithelial cells during lung fibrogenesis in adult.
  Note the positive regulation of GLI by TGF-β receptors in the light orange box.
  See main text for further details. Haematoxylin eosin staining of an epithelial
  metaplasia region in a human lung of a patient with IPF is shown. ep: epithelium;
  mes: mesenchyme.'
