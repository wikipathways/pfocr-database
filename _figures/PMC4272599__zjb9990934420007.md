caption: The V. cholerae El Tor C6706 Cpx envelope stress response senses and mediates
  adaptation to low iron. Changes in iron homeostasis in the IM caused by iron chelation
  (e.g., addition of bipyridyl) induce the Cpx pathway in V. cholerae. An unknown
  signal (e.g., a toxic compound [represented by a star]) may be sensed directly or
  indirectly by the sensor kinase CpxA, which then phosphorylates the response regulator
  CpxR. CpxR then activates the expression of genes involved in iron acquisition in
  order to maintain iron homeostasis. Additionally, resistance-nodulation efflux systems
  are CpxR-dependently activated to pump out unknown toxic compounds that are generated
  during disruption of iron homeostasis in the IM.
