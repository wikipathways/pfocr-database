caption: 'Schematic illustration of (A) the core–shell structure of MH-PNs and MH-MNs,
  and (B) accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor sites through the EPR effect, intracellular
  trafficking pathway, and synergistic antitumor effect of MH and TPGS.Notes: Chemical
  structures of HA-PBCA (a), MH (b), and TPGS (c). The intracellular trafficking pathway
  includes steps of receptor-meditated cellular internalization, endolysosomal disassembly,
  and drug release.Abbreviations: EPR, enhanced permeability and retention; HA-PBCA,
  hyaluronic acid-poly(butyl cyanoacrylate); IV, intravenous; MH, morin hydrate; MH-MNs,
  morin hydrate-loaded mixed nanoparticles; MH-PNs, morin hydrate-loaded plain nanoparticles;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; TPGS, D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000
  succinate.'
