caption: 'Schematic view of the GSL de novo biosynthesis pathway. Ceramide, the metabolic
  precursor of complex sphingolipids, occupies a central position in the GSL biosynthesis.
  Ceramide synthesis occurs in the ER, while at the level of cis-Golgi apparatus GlcCer
  is generated that is converted in LacCer in the trans-Golgi. The reactions involving
  ceramide transformation into all major classes of GSL are catalyzed in the lumen
  of the Golgi apparatus by membrane-bound transferases. Ceramide glucosyltransferase
  (GCT), also known as glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), is the rate limiting step
  for the synthesis of all major classes of GSL. GSL inhibitors like NB-DNJ inhibit
  GCS and hence the biosynthesis of all major GSL. Dashed line: intermediate synthesis
  steps are not shown. Sphingolipids synthesized in the ER are in red and in a box;
  GSL synthesized in the Golgi are in black. The GSL synthesis rate limiting enzyme
  GCS is shown in italics.'
