caption: Schematic overview depicting the effects of the tumor macroenvironment on
  circadian hepatic metabolism. Our results show that lung tumors, acting through
  the inflammatory STAT3-Socs3 axis, operate to distally rewire circadian transcription
  and metabolism by acting as an endogenous circadian organizer (ECO). This manifests
  in loss of hepatic insulin signaling, glucose intolerance, and deregulated lipid
  metabolism through the AMPK/SREBP pathway.
