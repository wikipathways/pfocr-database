caption: Glutathione metabolism. Proteomic analysis revealed prevalence of GSH synthesis
  and consumption in female hippocampus. The glutathione redox cycling catalyzed by
  GPx and GR is dependent on NADPH as a supplier of reducing equivalents, constantly
  regenerated mainly by pentose phosphate pathway. The differentially expressed proteins
  revealed by proteomics in organotypic hippocampal slice culture are highlighted
  in pink (increased abundance in female) and blue (increased abundance in males).
  For more details, see Supplementary Dataset . Statistical analyses were performed
  by using Student's t test followed by multiple testing corrections using the Benjamini–Hochberg
  procedure for false discovery rate (n = 5 biological replicates, each containing
  3 slices).
