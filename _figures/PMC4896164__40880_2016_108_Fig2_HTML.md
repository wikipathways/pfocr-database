caption: Main pathways regulated by the BCR-ABL1 protein. The downstream pathways
  regulated by BCR-ABL1 protein associated with cell survival, cell proliferation,
  cell cycle, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and the microenvironment of leukemia
  stem cells. Dark violet shapes indicate the kinase; lavender pink shapes indicate
  the proven oncoprotein; blue shapes indicate the proven tumor suppressor protein;
  and other color shapes indicate the proteins existing in normal cells. Red solid
  lines indicate inhibiting; green solid lines indicate activating. Blue dotted lines
  indicate that the results need further confirmation. Black dotted lines indicate
  the functions associated with the signaling pathway. JAK2 janus kinase 2, STAT5
  signal transducers and activators of transcription 5, BCR-XL B-cell lymphoma-extra-large,
  CRKL Crk-like protein, PI3 K phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT protein kinase B,
  MDM2 mouse double minute 2 homolog, TP53 tumor protein p53, p21WAF-1/CIP-1 cytosolic
  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, SKP2I S-phase kinase-associated protein 2
  inhibitor, NF-κB nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells,
  IKKβ IKβ kinase, C/EBPα CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, GATA2 GATA binding protein
  2, GRB2 the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2, SOS son of sevenless,
  MEK mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, ERK extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases, hnRNP-E2 poly(rC)-binding protein E2, FOXO3a forkhead box O3, TRAIL TNF-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand
