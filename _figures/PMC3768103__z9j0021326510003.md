caption: Schematic illustration of ligand-dependent transcriptional controls by nuclear
  receptors. Ligand binding induces dimerization and nuclear translocation of NR dimers.
  NRs recognize and bind specific DNA element sequences in the target gene regulatory
  regions to control the transcription of targets genes. Liganded NRs associate with
  transcriptional coregulator complexes. The transcriptional activity of NRs is modulated
  through various posttranslational protein modifications (for example, shown phosphorylation
  and ubiquitination) in response to the signals from activated cell membrane receptors.
  The transcripts (mRNA or miRNA) of target genes exert biological actions as downstream
  factors of the NR-mediated signaling pathway.
