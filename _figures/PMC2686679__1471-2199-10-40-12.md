caption: Signaling pathway leading to Egr-1 biosynthesis in thrombin or carbachol-stimulated
  39M1-81 cells. Stimulation of protease-activated and M1 muscarinic acetylcholine
  receptors leads to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), the generation of IP3
  and the release of Ca2+-ions into the cytosol via stimulation of ionotropic IP3
  receptors of the endoplasmic reticulum. The increase of the intracellular Ca2+-concentration
  is prevented by pretreating the cells with BAPTA-AM. Elevation of the intracellular
  Ca2+-concentration may induce a transactivation of the EGF receptor or an activation
  of PKC. Protein kinase C regulates directly or indirectly Raf activity. While preincubation
  of the cells with AG1478 was used to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the
  EGF receptor, PKC activity was either blocked by incubation with the bisindolylmaleimide
  GF109203X or by prolonged treatment with TPA. Both transactivation of the EGF receptor
  or activation of PKC stimulated the ERK signaling pathway. The compound PD98059
  was used to inhibit the phosphorylation of MAP kinase kinase by Raf, thus blocking
  the stimulus-induced phosphorylation and activation of ERK. Major nuclear substrates
  for ERK are ternary complex factors such as Elk-1, essential components of the serum
  response element ternary complex. The Egr-1 promoter contains five SREs that mediate
  signal-induced activation of Egr-1 gene transcription. Stimulus-induced Egr-1 biosynthesis
  was blocked by inhibiting ternary complex factor activity via expressing of a dominant-negative
  mutant (REST/Elk-1ΔC). Likewise, forced dephosphorylation of ERK by overexpression
  of MKP-1 blocked the signaling cascade leading to enhanced Egr-1 biosynthesis.
