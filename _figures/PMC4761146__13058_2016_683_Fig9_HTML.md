caption: Schematic diagram depicting the proposed signaling pathway involved in interferon-induced
  transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) upregulation in SUM149 cells. IFITM1 is one of
  the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are induced through the canonical Janus
  kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway due to
  increased expression of interferon α (IFNα). The binding of IFNα to its receptor
  interferon (alpha, beta and omega) receptor (IFNAR1/2) leads to the induction of
  the canonical JAK-STAT pathway, which involves phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2,
  and the formation of the complex interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), ultimately
  inducing many ISGs, including IFITM1. In the nucleus, ISGF3 recruits chromatin remodeling
  complex brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) via STAT2 to remodel the promoter and expose
  interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)/interferon gamma-activated site (GAS)
  for transcription factor binding. Alternatively, STAT2 can homodimerize upon phosphorylation,
  and bind interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form a non-ISGF3 complex that
  is capable of binding the GAS or ISRE/IRF sequences at the promoter region of a
  subset of ISGs and induce their transcription without the participation of STAT1
  in a noncanonical interferon signaling pathway. The presence of both GAS and ISRE/IRF
  consensus sequences at the IFITM1 promoter suggests that its transcription can be
  induced by both canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways, resulting in its
  overexpression in SUM149 cells
