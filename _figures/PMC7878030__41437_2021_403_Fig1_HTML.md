caption: In each example, multiple independent variants can be combined to constitute
  the population scale loss-of-function allele state. a Loss of function in SLC30A8
  is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes in humans (Flannick et al. ;
  Dwivedi et al. ). b Experimental evolution in Pseudomonas aeruginosa resulted repeatedly
  in loss-of-function mutations in nfxB, conferring antibiotic resistance (Wong et
  al. ). c Experimental evolution in yeast led to consistent disruption of specific
  signaling pathway genes including MTH1 during adaptation to stable environments
  (Kvitek and Sherlock ). d Populations of Plasmodium falciparum repeatedly evolved
  loss-of-function alleles in Epac during adaptation to lab culture environments (Claessens
  et al. ). e Natural RDO5 loss-of-function variants in Arabidopsis thaliana occurred
  at high frequency in northwest Europe and caused reduced seed dormancy, a trait
  under strong locally adaptive selection (Xiang et al. ). f Adaptation to agricultural
  intensification led to selection for semi-dwarf rice, which is caused by loss-of-function
  variants in GA20ox2 (Spielmeyer et al. ; Sasaki et al. ).
