caption: 'A scheme illustrating multiple decarboxylating pathways of C4photosynthesis.
  A fraction of OAA produced by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylation in the mesophyll
  (M) cells, a, is reduced to malate, which will move to the bundle‐sheath (BS) mitochondria
  where malate is decarboxylated, generating NADH that will drive the mitochondrial
  electron transport chain (mETC) and produce ATP. The remaining fraction of OAA in
  the M cells, (1 − a), follows various possible pathways: a fraction of this part
  of OAA (a′) follows the NAD‐malic enzyme (ME) or NADP‐ME decarboxylating pathway
  or the PEP‐carboxykinase (CK) pathway where the PEP generated will be converted
  to pyruvate in the BS cells by pyruvate kinase (PK) – the pathway denoted as PEP‐CK(PK);
  another fraction (a″) follows the PEP‐CK pathway, where the PEP generated will be
  converted to pyruvate in the BS cells by PEP phosphatase (PP) – the pathway denoted
  as PEP‐CK(PP); and the remaining fraction, 1 − a′ − a″, follows the classical PEP‐CK
  pathway where the ATP required for PEP‐CK may come from the ATP generated from the
  aforementioned NADH‐associated mETC. As discussed in the main text, the NH2‐flux
  balance associated with the PEP‐CK type would require that a = (1 − a)(1 − a′ − a″).
  The gross ATP requirements for each decarboxylating form can be formulated according
  to these fractions, as indicated in the figure, where NAD‐ME, NADP‐ME, and PEP‐CK(PK)
  all require two ATP per decarboxylation (for PEP regeneration by pyruvate, phosphate
  dikinase), and therefore are lumped in the same category (but elsewhere in the text,
  and in Table  and Fig. , the fraction of this category for NADP‐ME is denoted as
  b). Summing individual gross ATP requirements up, deducting the ATP production by
  the NADH oxidation (which is na, where n is the number of ATP produced per NADH
  oxidation), would give the net ATP requirement for the whole C4cycle. Combining
  this with the NH2‐balance equation a = (1 − a)(1 − a′ − a″) and rearranging terms
  would give an equation describing net ATP requirement for the whole C4cycle as 2 + a″ − (n + 1 + a″)a
  in this mixed type.'
