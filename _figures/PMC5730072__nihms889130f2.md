caption: Mapped pathway for the therapeutic effects on colorectal cancer patients’
  metabolomes. Metabolites were mapped according to their biochemical pathway (KEGG
  – bold line) and chemical similarity (PubChem ID – light gray line). Fold changes
  and adjusted/FDR-corrected p-values were abstracted by comparing patients pre- and
  post surgery. Only metabolites with an adjusted/ FDR-corrected p-value <0.1 were
  labeled as increased/decreased.
