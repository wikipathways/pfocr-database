caption: 'In some cases, migration and invasion are stimulated through NGF or proNGF
  upon activation of p75NTR and TrkA. Two main pathways are described in that context:
  (1) ephrin-B receptor activated through interaction with ephrin-ligand (from surrounding
  cells) phosphorylate Kidins220/ARMS leading to increase p75NTR/TrkA affinity for
  NGF (; ; ). Upon NGF activation, p75NTR/TrkA/Kidins220/ARMS activate MAPkinase pathway
  (). (2) Migration and invasion is also activated through proNGF/sortilin/p75NTR/TrkA
  (). In this context, SRC/RhoA signaling pathway is activated leading to cytoskeleton
  remodeling (). (A) Information collected from NCC migration and invasion during
  the development. (B) Information collected from cancer studies (highlighted in blue).
  Orange and blue borders = information related to both situations, NCC and cancer
  cells migration and invasion.'
