caption: Plasmalogen signaling in the M. xanthus response to photooxidative stress.
  (A) Cleavage by 1O2 of the plasmalogen vinyl ether bond and its products. (B) Model
  for the plasmalogen-based signal transduction pathway leading to CarR inactivation
  in M. xanthus (arrows for activation; blunt ended for inactivation). As the PEDS1
  desaturase, CarF converts (both in the dark and in the light) the plasmanyl precursor
  (AEPE) to plasmalogen (VEPE), which is absolutely required in the response to blue
  light. Generation of 1O2 upon photoexcitation of PPIX provokes cleavage of VEPE
  at the vinyl ether bond, generating a fatty aldehyde and lyso-PE. This may inactivate
  CarR directly by adduct formation with the reactive fatty aldehyde or by lipid remodeling
  and perturbation of the local membrane structure around CarR, leading to a conformational
  change and/or degradation of CarR. As a consequence, CarQ is liberated, associates
  with RNA polymerase (RNAP), and activates specific genes leading to carotenoid synthesis.
