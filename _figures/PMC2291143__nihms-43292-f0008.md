caption: a | Chordin binds bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) through cysteine-rich
  domains CR1 and CR3. After cleavage of Chordin by Xolloid (small arrows), the CR
  modules still bind BMP, but with tenfold reduced affinity. In principle, this lowered
  affinity might explain why Xolloid cleavage restores BMP signalling from inactive
  BMP-Chordin complexes. b | In the presence of Twisted-gastrulation (xTsg) protein,
  two new activities are observed. First, xTsg increases the binding of BMP to full-length
  Chordin, converting the Chordin-xTsg-BMP ternary complex into a better BMP antagonist.
  Second, after Xolloid cleavage, residual binding of BMP to CR modules is readily
  competed by xTsg. The binary xTsg-BMP complex does not interfere with BMP receptor
  binding at physiological concentrations, therefore eliminating inhibition by CR
  fragments and providing a permissive signal for BMP binding to its cognate receptors.
  The thicker arrows in b indicate the effects of xTsg on this biochemical pathway.
  Activated BMP receptor is phosphorylated (circled Ps), relaying the signal intracellularly.
