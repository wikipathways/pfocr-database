caption: Localizing mRNA to be transported to the neuronal processes begins RNP (L-RNP)
  formation within the nucleus, helping to ensure stringent translational repression.
  In the cell soma after export the mRNA (blue line) and associated RNA binding proteins
  (gray circle) form the L-RNP. In one pathway, an L-RNP is actively transported along
  the axon (axonal mRNA transport) to the growth cone where guidance cues activate
  local signal transduction pathways (yellow stars). This activates kinases (open
  circle; inactive kinase, red circle; activated kinase) that modify components of
  the transport and/or translation machinery, resulting in local translation (represented
  by 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits) of the mRNA toward the direction of the guidance
  cues to aid in navigation of the growth cone. In another pathway an L-RNP is actively
  transported into the dendrites (dendritic mRNA transport). At the post-synaptic
  region of activated synapses (green pre-synaptic terminal) synaptic activity activates
  signal transduction pathways, activating kinases that modify components of the transport
  and/or translation machinery, resulting in local translation of the mRNA in the
  vicinity of the guidance cues. The lack of activated kinases at non-stimulated synapses
  (red pre-synaptic terminal) does not cause translational de-repression at these
  sites.
