caption: Deleterious effects of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation in asthma.
  Bronchial epithelial cells are the first barrier against environmental agents. In
  asthma, exposure to allergens and environmental AhR ligands such as particulate
  matter (PM), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or Benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P)
  induces MUC5AC expression leading to mucus hypersecretion through AhR. Moreover,
  the alarmins interleukin (IL)-33 and Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP) are also
  induced through this pathway. These cytokines are able to activate innate lymphoid
  cells type 2 (ILC2) inducing eosinophil recruitment. Other structural cells implicated
  in asthma and expressing AhR are fibroblasts. Co-activation of these cells by an
  allergen and AhR ligands leads to TGF-β and α-SMA transcription, which are implicated
  in airway remodelling. Bone marrow derived-macrophages (BMDM) can also participate
  in airway remodelling through secretion of Cxcl2, a chemokine induced by Ahr activation
  and leading to smooth muscle cell migration. Moreover, increased secretion of Cxcl2
  as well as Cxcl1 (or CXCL-8/IL-8 in humans) in response to allergen and AhR ligands
  costimulation leads to the recruitment of neutrophils. Neutrophil inflammation is
  associated with severe asthma and increased secretion of IL-17. The Th17 pathway
  is also induced by allergens and AhR ligands activated -dendritic cells and -alveolar
  macrophages through increased Jag1 expression. Furthermore, alveolar macrophages
  are implicated in Th1 and induced T regulatory cell (iTreg) inhibition through Ahr
  activation. In response to Ahr signalling, dendritic cells through increased expression
  of costimulatory molecule CD86 and HLA-DR, as well as alveolar macrophages participate
  in increased Thelper (Th)2 activation. Moreover, bone marrow derived-dendritic cells
  (BMDC) stimulated with an allergen and AhR ligands can amplify type 2 responses
  by inhibiting Th1 and activating Th2 cells. All these AhR-dependent signals result
  in increased Th17/neutrophilic and/or Th2/ILC2/eosinophilic inflammation, together
  with decreased Th1/Treg regulation.
