caption: Alternative pathway of NF-κB activation. In unstimulated cells, NIK is destabilized
  by bound TRAF3. Activation through a subset of receptors of the TNFR superfamily
  including the BAFFR, CD40, RANK and lymphotoxin-β R leads to the recruitment of
  TRAF proteins (including TRAF3) to the receptor. TRAF3 is inactivated (possibly
  by degradation or sequestration) and active NIK is thus released. NIK then phosphorylates
  and activates IKK; it also recruits NF-κB2/p100 (probably bound to RelB), which
  is phosphorylated by IKKα. This triggers K48 polyubiquitination of p100 mediated
  by β TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent proteasomal processing to yield the
  mature subunit p52. Predominantly RelB/p52 heterodimers are generated, which migrate
  to the nucleus. The classical pathway is also activated through these receptors
  with some receptors (BAFFR) activating less strongly than others. Unlike TNFR (Figure
  2), BAFFR signaling is associated only with survival functions. BAFFR, B-cell activating
  factor receptor; IKK, IκB kinase; LT, lymphotoxin; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; NIK,
  NF-κB-inducing kinase; RANK, receptor activator of NF-κB; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor
  receptor; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor.
