caption: Transport of heme synthesis intermediates and heme in metazoans. A, heme
  is synthesized via a conserved eight-step pathway involving both mitochondrial and
  cytoplasmic enzymes. The intermediates ALA, CPgenIII, and PPIX and the substrate
  glycine need to be transported across mitochondrial membranes for the subsequent
  reactions. The solute carrier protein SLC25A38 may be involved in translocating
  glycine into mitochondria. The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB6 and the peripheral
  benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) were proposed to facilitate the import of CPgenIII
  into the mitochondria, whereas the 2-oxoglutarate carrier (OGC) and the adenine
  nucleotide translocator (ANT) may play a role in PPIX transport. The mechanisms
  for the export of ALA and the shuttling of heme precursors among the cytosolic enzymes
  are unknown. ALAS, aminolevulinic acid synthase; CPOX, coproporphyrinogen oxidase.
  B, the last step of heme biosynthesis occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. The nascent
  heme moiety must be translocated across membranes to multiple subcellular compartments
  where target hemoproteins reside. Heme can also be exported out of the cell or imported
  into the cell. The cell-surface FLVCR and the ABC transporter ABCG2 have been implicated
  in heme export in erythroid cells, whereas HRG-1 was identified as a heme importer.
  The question marks represent the presumptive heme trafficking pathways that are
  currently unclear. COX, cytochrome c oxidase; Cytb5, cytochrome b5.
