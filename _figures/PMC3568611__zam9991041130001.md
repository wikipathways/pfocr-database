caption: Biosynthetic pathway of l-valine and by-products of C. glutamicum under oxygen
  deprivation. Enzymes whose genes were overexpressed are highlighted in black boxes,
  and enzymes whose genes were disrupted are marked with an X. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; PC, pyruvate carboxylase;
  MDH, malate dehydrogenase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; NDH, NADH dehydrogenase;
  MQ, menaquinone; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; AlaT, alanine transaminase encoded
  by alaT; AvtA, alanine transaminase encoded by avtA; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  PQO, pyruvare:quinone oxidoreductase; CTF, CoA transferase; PTA, phosphotransacetylase;
  ACK, acetate kinase; AHAS, acetohydroxy acid synthase; AHAIR, acetohydroxy acid
  isomeroreductase (AHAIR*, NAD-preferring mutant); DHAD, dihydroxy acid dehydratase;
  TA, transaminase B; LeuDH, leucine dehydrogenase (L. sphaericus).
