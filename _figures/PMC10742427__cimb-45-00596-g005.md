caption: 'NAD+ biosynthetic pathways. NA is converted to NAD+ via the Preiss–Handler
  pathway, whereas NAM and NR enter the salvage pathway to produce NAD+. The NAD+
  salvage pathway recycles NAM that is generated as a byproduct of the activity of
  NAD+-consuming enzymes: CD38, PARP, and sirtuins. NMN is synthesized from NAM by
  NAMPT as well as from NR by NRKs. PARP: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; NMN: nicotinamide
  mononucleotide; NAMPT: nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; NRKs: nicotinamide
  riboside kinases. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 21 November 2023)'
