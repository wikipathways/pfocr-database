caption: 'Example of significant gene S100A7 in: (a) HPRD and (b) BioGRID; In both
  the networks, S100A7 is connected to known MD genes. In HPRD, it connects some high-degree
  nodes such as EGFR. In BioGRID, it connects two clusters that have some important,
  known MD genes. The presence of APP here is notable since pathway analysis for these
  significant genes highlights Alzheimer’s disease. (Visualization: Gephi).'
