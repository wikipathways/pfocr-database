caption: Fig. 7. Model for the intra-S DNA damage checkpoint. (A) DNA damage during
  S phase leads to phosphorylation of RP-A and Rad53 mediated by Mec1. Active Rad53
  modulates the target specificity of Cdk1*, causing inhibition of pol–prim phosphorylation
  and modification of Srs2. (B) Replication forks encountering DNA damage have the
  option, in the presence of a functional SRS2 gene product, to switch the template
  copying the newly synthesized lagging strand, thus bypassing the DNA lesion. The
  re-establishment of a conventional replication fork can occur by reverse branch
  migration. This mechanism allows duplication of a damaged template without leaving
  gaps opposite the lesions. In the absence of Srs2, a faster replication mechanism,
  involving repriming downstream of the damage, is favoured. This generates gapped
  DNA molecules that will be highly recombinogenic, likely to lead to increased genomic
  instability (see text for details).
