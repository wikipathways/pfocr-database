caption: It is proposed that neuron-derived E2 (NDE2) regulates synaptic plasticity
  via both rapid and genomic signaling mechanisms. 1) Membrane localized estrogen
  receptors (estrogen receptor-α and β, ERα and ERβ, and G-protein coupled estrogen
  receptor-1, GPER1) can bind NDE2 and 2) the receptor bound NDE2 then induces rapid
  PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK kinase signaling, which is capable of quickly shaping synaptic
  plasticity. In addition, the activated intracellular kinase signaling also phosphorylates
  the important transcriptional factor, CREB which further translocates into nucleus
  to facilitate the expressions of neurotrophic factor BDNF and synaptic protein PSD95.
  BDNF can also regulate synaptic plasticity by coupling to the rapid intracellular
  kinases. Moreover, BDNF signaling activates cofilin which is required for F-actin
  assembly and dendritic spine formation. Intracellular ERα and ERβ act in the genomic
  signaling pathway by transactivating estrogen response elements (ERE) in regulated
  genes and promoting genes transcription. CRE = cAMP response element.
