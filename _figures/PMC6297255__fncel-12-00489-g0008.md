caption: 'Model proposing ROCK inhibition mediates morphological shift and neurite
  outgrowth-promoting property of OECs. Left: Activated RhoA/ROCK pathway maintains
  the integrity of F-actin fiber cytoskeleton, which triggers YAP nuclear shuttling.
  Nuclear YAP upregulates integrin, activates integrin-focal adhesion (FA) signaling
  and results in flattened shape of OECs. Right: inhibition of ROCK pathway disrupts
  F-actin fiber cytoskeleton, which excludes nuclear YAP to cytoplasm. YAP cytoplasmic
  shuttling shifts OECs towards process-bearing shape, upregulates L1-CAM and enhances
  neurite outgrowth-promoting property of OECs.'
