caption: Overview of biological processes and pathways involved in patients with CNV-genes
  acting according to double-hit model. The network depicts the protein-protein interactions
  (grey lines) revealed by STRING analysis (visualized by Cytoscape tool) on the basis
  of the enrichment obtained with GeneCodis4 tool. The Figure shows the enriched BP
  terms and KEGG pathways clustering the CNV-genes of the eight patients with known
  NDD genes (SFARI reported genes with score 1/2 and OMIM genes correlated to NDDs).
  The analysis shows that all eight patients have CNV-overlapped genes involved in
  two known NDD-associated biological processes, except patient IGGAC13, for whom
  the two implicated genes appeared in the same KEGG pathway. GO terms “neuron projection
  development”, “synaptic membrane adhesion”, “ion trasport”, “G-protein-coupled receptor
  signalling pathway” and “mRNA splicing” are shared by at least two different patients.
