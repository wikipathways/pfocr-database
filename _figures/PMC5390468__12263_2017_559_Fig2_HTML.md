caption: KEGG TGF-beta signalling pathway. Genes specifically responding to rye in
  the jejunum of broilers are encircled in red and in IPEC-J2 cells in black. Overlapping
  genes ZFYVE16 and NOG are encircled by dashed red-black lines. The DEG ZBTB17 (alias
  MIZ1) and gene CDKNA1 (alias p21) were also part of the KEGG cell cycle pathway
  and integrated in the original scheme of the KEGG TGF-beta signalling pathway (encircled
  with a dashed line) and are discussed in the section of amoxicillin. Arrows indicate
  up (↑)- or down (↓)-regulation. Official gene symbols are provided for non-HUGO
  symbols used in the boxes of the pathway scheme (NOG = Noggin, SARA = ZFYVE16)

  with in vitro data provides improved insight into gene regulation mechanisms in
  the intestinal mucosa.
