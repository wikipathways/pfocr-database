caption: Drug-initiated microtubule disassembly mobilizes several signaling pathways
  that impact PAI-1 transcription. Colchicine- induced disruption of microtubule cytoskeleton
  leads to the activation of EGFR and Src family kinases, perhaps as a consequence
  of an increase in the generation of ROS. pp60c-src-phosphorylated EGFR (at the Y845
  site) signals to MEK-ERK initiating ERK interactions with specific transcription
  factors (TFs), including members of the bHLH-LZ family that are known to be MAP
  kinase targets [] and which initiate PAI-1 gene expression via the ERK1/2 pathway
  []. Colchicine also stimulates SMAD2/3 phosphorylation (at the c-terminal end) independent
  of the TGF-β1-ligand dependent mechanisms (e.g., de novo synthesis or release of
  the active form of TGF-β1 from the matrix) and independent of TGF-β1 receptor activity.
  pSMAD2/3 may cooperate with pERK1/2-activated bHLH proteins to initiate PAI-1 transcription.
  Mobilization of the RhoA/ROCK pathway downstream of microtobule deformation appears
  necessary for sustaining SMAD phsophorylation and subsequent PAI-1 induction [].
  In this model, stimulation of the Rho/Rock pathway by a microtubule-dependent increase
  in Rho GEF function may regulate the activity of specific SMAD phosphatases (e.g.,
  PPM1A) impacting, thereby, the duration of SMAD-dependent transcription of target
  genes such as PAI-1. MEK/ERK involvement downstream of ROS generation was critical
  for PAI-1, but not CTGF, expression following microtubule perturbation suggesting
  bifurcation of pathways downstream of EGFR activation. Colchicine-initiated SMAD3
  phosphorylation, moeover, was essential for PAI-1, but not CTGF, expression further
  highlighting divergence of signaling events downstream of Rho/ROCK.
