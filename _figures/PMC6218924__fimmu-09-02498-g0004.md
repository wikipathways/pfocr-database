caption: 'Mechanisms of iron-glucose metabolism cross-talk. Iron and glucose can cross-talk
  via different mechanisms: (A) Glucose increases expression of hepcidin, inhibiting
  cellular iron export via ferroportin. (B) Iron acts via the production of ROS or
  via mitochondrial respiration and subsequent ATP production, to promote insulin
  exocytosis by the pancreatic β-cells. Insulin binding to the insulin receptor in
  target cells, e.g., hepatocytes, promotes cellular glucose import via the glucose
  transporter 2 (GLUT2), and glycolysis. (C) In the context of infection, glucose
  metabolism can be regulated by heme via a pathway that involves TLR4, but which
  has not yet been fully described. Heme interaction with the nuclear receptor Rev-erbα,
  downregulates the transcription of gluconeogenic genes including G6PC, the enzyme
  catalyzing the last step of gluconeogenesis. G6PC is also downregulated by iron
  produced via heme catabolism by HO-1, an inhibitory effect countered by ferritin.'
