caption: 'A simplified illustration of SMO-dependent GLI regulation in the context
  of transcriptional regulation. The binding of transcription factors AP1, AP2α, SP1,
  and CREB to promoter regions of SMO kickstarts the onset of its transcription. Similarly,
  the binding of NFκB to the NFκB binding site located within the Shh promoter induced
  the transcriptional upregulation of Shh. Furthermore, the increased transcriptional
  output of SMO and Shh can also occur as epigenetic events through hypomethylation
  of CpG islands that reside within promoters, which further promotes the binding
  of transcriptional machinery to promoters. Conversely, hypermethylation of the PTCH1
  promoter leads to decreased transcriptional expression and consequently decreased
  production of PTCH1 protein. Together, these molecular events work in concert to
  further enhanced Hh pathway activity and promote tumorigenesis. Dotted triangle-headed
  arrow: inactivated function; dotted bar-headed arrow: loss of inhibition; red upward
  triangle-headed arrow: upregulation.'
