caption: 'Simplified tryptophan metabolism by the kynurenine pathway. Tryptophan is
  most commonly metabolized into kynurenine via one of two enzymes: indoleamine 2,3
  dioxygenase (IDO) or tryptophan 2,3, dioxygenase. Kynurenine can be further broken
  down into a variety of metabolites that are neuroactive, including 3-hydroxykynurenine
  (3HK), quinolinic acid, and kynurenic acid. The conversion from 3-hydroxyanthranillic
  acid to quinolinic acid, represented by a dashed line, requires 2 reactions. The
  first is an enzymatic and the other is nonenzymatic. Alternatively, tryptophan can
  also produce serotonin.'
