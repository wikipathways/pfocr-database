caption: The proposed signaling pathway induced by combination treatment with NB and
  DOX. NB enhances DOX cellular accumulation and augments DNA damage. This activates
  the p53 pathway and results in activation of the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
  pathway through downregulating the Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio. NB also triggers
  intracellular Ca2+ mobilization through interacting with TRPM8. Ca2+ overproduction
  may facilitate mitochondrial dysfunction and affect ROS generation. In turn, this
  can suppress activation of ERK1/2 and AKT, and facilitate p38MAPK and JNK phosphorylation
  to boost p53 activation and strengthen the effects on apoptosis.
