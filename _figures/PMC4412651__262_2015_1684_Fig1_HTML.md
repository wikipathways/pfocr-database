caption: Interconnected networks of CEA and TGF-β signaling in cancer. The cancer
  cell is an autocrine source of CEA as well as of TGF-β which bind to their specific
  receptors, CEAR or TGF-β-RI:RII, respectively; the latter signaling via the NFκB
  pathway. Recently, it has been recognized that CEA also signals via TGF-β-R and
  initiates the same biological effects []. Additionally, Tregs and Bregs, as well
  as stroma cells, participate in this network by secreting TGF-β. It remains open
  whether the reverse is the case, and TGF-β may also interfere with the CEAR pathway,
  which is much less defined
