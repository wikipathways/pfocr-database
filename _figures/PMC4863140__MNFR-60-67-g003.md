caption: The three proposed mechanisms through which inorganic nitrate reduces blood
  pressure. Nitrate is converted to NO via the enterosalivary pathway or the XOR‐catalysed
  nitrate‐nitrite‐NO pathway. NO can then activate soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC),
  reducing blood pressure in the canonical manner. Further, it can inhibit superoxide
  production by NADPH oxidase, a vasoconstriction pathway stimulated by angiotensin
  II. Finally, NO can suppress hepatic erythropoietin (EPO) expression, reducing haemoglobin
  levels and thus the haematocrit.
