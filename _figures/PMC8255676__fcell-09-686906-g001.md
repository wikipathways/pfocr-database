caption: Three main components of ferroptosis mechanisms. Cysteine metabolism, consisting
  of cystine import and transsulfutation pathway, refers to a compensation method
  of cellular cysteine that contributes to the biofunction of glutathione (GSH) cycle
  in cytoplasm. As the key factor of antioxidative system, glutathione metabolism
  removes excessive ROS with the participation of GPX4 and NADPH. Radical homeostasis
  is the essential link to exacerbate cell destroy. Labile iron pool is accumulated
  excessively as a substrate of Fenton reaction for ROS generation by the uptake of
  ferrous iron and degradation of ferritin.
