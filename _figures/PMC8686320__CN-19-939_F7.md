caption: IRAP and GLUT4 translocation in insulin-responsive tissues. IRAP is supposed
  to contribute to deteriorating memory processing [] since this enzyme is found in
  regions associated with cognitive function as well as sensory and motor function.
  In neurons of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, IRAP is present in intracellular
  vesicles containing GLUT4 [], suggesting a similar system as has been described
  for fat and muscle cells. In insulin-responsive tissues, IRAP and the glucose transporter
  are translocated together to the cell surface after insulin stimulation [, ].
