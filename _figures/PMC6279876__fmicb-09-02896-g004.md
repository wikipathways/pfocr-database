caption: Schematic model of HPV-driven carcinogenesis. (A) A multistep molecular mechanism
  of host-viral interaction (). The initial outcome of carcinogenesis is modulated
  by both viral (high-risk versus low-risk HPV types, HPV integration) and host factors
  (inflammatory response, oxidative stress). Inflammatory response upon initial infection
  such as IFN response plays role in reducing episomal HPV resulting clearance of
  infection. Integration of HPV is (initiated with DNA damage. The IFN induced loss
  of episomal HPV and down-regulation of E2 leads to the selection of cells with integrated
  HPV genomes expressing higher levels of E6 and E7. Once the early genes E6 and E7
  are expressed, TLR9 down regulated and IFN response impaired, resulting a conducive
  milieu for immune evasion and persistent infection. Up regulation of E6/E7 increases
  genetic instability and chromosomal rearrangements that increase the risk of integration.
  Overexpression of E6/E7 leads to deregulation of the cell cycle via p53 and Rb degradation,
  deregulation of oncogenes and miRNAs expression. Epigenetic and genetic modification
  in viral and host genome leads to the deregulation of E6 and E7 oncogenes, and host
  tumor suppressor genes that lead to carcinogenesis. Oxidative modification of TFs
  also leads to altered gene expression and carcinogenesis. (B) Schematic model of
  the interaction between microRNAs and factors involved in malignant transformation
  caused by HPVE6 and E7 expression in cervical cancer cell (). E6 disrupts the expression
  of miR-23b, miR-218, and miR-34a via p53 degradation and their expression is transactivated
  by the binding of p53 to consensus sites in the promoter regions, affecting the
  expression of cell cycle regulators, such as E2, cyclin D1, CDK4, CDK6, E2F1, E2F3,
  E2F5, Bcl-2, SIRT1, p18, uPA, and LAMBD3. In the overexpression of miR-15/16 cluster
  byE7, E2F1 transactivates the c-Myb expression and represses the c-Myc expression,
  and then the microRNA cluster regulation is controlled by binding of c-Myc or c-Myb
  to promoter region of microRNA cluster. The increased expression of miR-15a/miR-16-1
  induces the inhibition of cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. The down regulation
  of miR-203 by E7 is mediated by MAPK/PKC pathway.)
