caption: Overview of the molecular mechanisms within the axon and the Schwann cell
  during Wallerian degeneration. Upon nerve transection, the axonal transport of NMNAT2
  is interrupted, and NMNAT2 already present in axons is degraded in a PHR1- and proteasome-dependent
  manner. Conversion of NMN to NAD by NMNAT2 is halted so NMN builds up inside the
  axon. NMN binds the SARM1 octamer, causing a conformational change and its activation.
  SARM1 activity generates cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD but also other products
  from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) and other substrates, such
  as nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NaADP) and 2′-phospho-cyclic ADP-ribose
  (cADPRP). It is incompletely understood how SARM1 activation leads to further downstream
  steps in the axonal degeneration pathway, such as calcium release, ROS generation,
  ATP decline and the role of the molecule Axundead. The timings of the activation
  of the molecular pathways involved in the Schwann cell injury response in relation
  to those that regulate the axon degeneration machinery have not been fully delineated.
  It is likely that the majority of the Schwann cell injury response occurs during
  or slightly after axon degeneration has been executed. During axon degeneration,
  placental growth factor (Plgf) is released from axons and activates VEGF receptors
  leading to constriction of actin filaments in the Schwann cell, which helps break
  up axon fragments. It is possible that mTORC1 activation contributes to this process.
  Within the nucleus, c-JUN upregulation mediates a substantial amount of the Schwann
  cell response to nerve injury, especially repair program gene expression, cell shape
  change forming repair Schwann cells, upregulation of myelinophagy to aid in myelin
  sheath removal and repression of the myelin program through inhibition of Krox-20
  function. Other pathways that aid myelin clearance include calcineurin, MEK-ERK,
  Notch and P38 MAPKinase pathway activation, though their full mechanism is not completely
  understood. Furthermore, TAM receptor phagocytosis also contributes to myelin clearance.
  Within the nucleus, both OCT6 and HDAC1/2 repress c-JUN function and the polycomb
  repressive complex 2 (PRC2) represses a number of other repair program genes. Broken
  lines with question marks highlight a hypothetical association or an unknown quality. Created
