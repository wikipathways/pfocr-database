caption: The NOD2 signaling pathway for recognition of bacterial and viral PAMPs is
  shown on the left. NOD2 is triggered by bacterial MDP to activate NF-κB while ssRNA
  from RSV leads to activation of IRF-3 signaling. The RIG-I Inflammasome is depicted
  on the right. Both RIG-I and MDA5 can interact with CARD9/BCL10 to activate NF-κB.
  This leads to induction of pro-IL-1β. RIG-I but not MDA5 can directly associate
  with ASC bifurcating NLR mediated activation of Caspase-1. This leads to cleavage
  of IL-1β and secretion from the cell.
