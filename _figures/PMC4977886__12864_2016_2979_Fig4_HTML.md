caption: Differentially expressed proteins regulated cellular processes/diseases and
  hypothetical depiction of BPA action. (a) BPA-induced differentially expressed (p < 0.05)
  proteins regulated cellular processes and diseases as depicted by Pathway Studio
  software. Differentially expressed proteins have been highlighted in yellow background.
  At least 11 proteins among the 24 differentially expressed proteins were implicated
  in different disease processes. (b) Hypothetical depiction showing the effects of
  BPA in spermatozoa and the possible mechanism of action. BPA may bind to membrane
  receptors on spermatozoa that induce rapid phosphorylation of MAPK (p38), PI3K (p85),
  PKA substrates and subsequent activation of the kinase systems. Simultaneously,
  BPA induced the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue (Try-P) of sperm proteins. BPA
  induced changes in spermatozoa affect the overall protein content of the spermatozoa,
  ultimately predispose to several pathological outcome
