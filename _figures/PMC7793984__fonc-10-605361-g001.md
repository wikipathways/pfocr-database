caption: 'LMP agents and biological factors that induce lysosomal rupture and cell
  death. The limiting lysosomal membrane employs various glycoproteins, NPC1/2 and
  LAMP1/2, and a characteristic lipid composition to maintain its functional integrity
  as a barrier with the cytosol. Internally, ILVs delivered from endosomes via vesicles
  bind to and activate lysosomal hydrolases responsible for the metabolic breakdown
  of delivered glycolipids to maintain cellular steady-state levels. CADs such as
  siramesine and HMA compromise this metabolic pathway, likely by interfering with
  the activation of enzymes such as ASM by ILV-localized acidic lipids such as BMP.
  The resulting accumulation of glycolipid substrates such as SM leads to limiting
  membrane destabilization, LMP and cathepsin release, and ultimately cell death.
  By suppressing proton import, v-ATPase inhibitors similarly suppress lysosomal hydrolase
  function by elevating luminal pH beyond the optimum for catalytic activity. Lysosomotropic
  detergents directly disrupt the limiting membrane by partially solubilizing lipid
  components, and ferroptosis inducers such as salinomycin sequester iron in lysosomes
  to promote ROS accumulation and limiting membrane destabilization through lipid
  oxidation. Internally-produced ROS from mitochondria can also contribute to limiting
  membrane destabilization, as can the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores such
  as the ER to activate calpains. Abbreviations: ASM, acid sphingomyelin; BMP, bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate;
