caption: A summary of the effect of FMN on PD. FMN mitigates MPP(+)-induced oxidative
  stress and protects dopaminergic neurons via Nrf2 activation in a Parkinson’s disease
  model. MPP(+) increases ROS production, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and
  the accumulation of α-synuclein, which further exacerbates neuronal damage. By activating
  the Nrf2 pathway, FMN helps to mitigate oxidative stress, reduce mitochondrial damage,
  and protect dopaminergic neurons, potentially delaying or preventing PD progression
  (created with Biorender, https://app.biorender.com/, accessed on 10 August 2024).
  The black arrows indicate the known mechanisms by which MPP induces the PD model,
  while the red arrows and lines represent the mechanism of FMN, which exerts neuroprotective
  effects by activating Nrf2 to inhibit oxidative stress
