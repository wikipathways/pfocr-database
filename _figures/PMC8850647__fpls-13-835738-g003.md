caption: ER stress-induced cell death in plants. In a mammalian-conserved mechanism,
  IRE1 is responsible for the splicing of bZIP60, which loses its transmembrane domain
  causing a relocation to the nucleus. IRE1A has an unspecific ribonuclease function
  during cell death, promoting the Regulated IRE1a-dependent RNA Decay. Like the ATF6
  factor in mammals, the transmembrane ER sensors bZIP17 and bZIP28 are processed
  in the Golgi apparatus. Both bZIP28 and bZIP60 matured transcription factors have
  pro-survival functions in the nucleus but also upregulate pro-apoptotic genes like
  ANAC089 in Arabidopsis. ANAC089 is a plant-specific NAC-containing factor that is
  processed in the Golgi in a S1P/S2P-independent mechanism. Without its transmembrane
  domain, ANAC089 upregulates programmed cell death (PCD)-associated genes. Another
  plant-specific arm of ER-induced PCD is the developmental cell death (DCD) domain-containing
  asparagine-rich protein (NRP)-mediated cell death response, where the NRP genes
  are upregulated and induce the expression of ANAC036 in Arabidopsis, culminating
  in the expression of the cell death executor gammaVPE. The NRP/DCD pathway is attenuated
  by the expression of the molecular chaperone BiP. Prolonged ER stress also promotes
  the Calcium release from the organelle and accumulation in the mitochondria. The
  cation accumulation in the mitochondria leads to a ROS burst and the formation of
  mitochondrial PTPs. The mitochondrial ROS leakage promotes the Calcium release from
  the ER creating a positive feedback loop. A few BAG proteins are BiP binding partners,
  and this protein family acts as calcium sensors, inhibiting the ion accumulation
  in the mitochondria.
