caption: The pathophysiological actions of MLKL in the lysosome and endosome. (A)
  MLKL translocates to the lysosomal membrane, triggering lysosome aggregation and
  fusion and ultimately leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). The
  interaction between p-MLKL and BAX is also a LMP inducer. LMP may result in the
  release of lysosomal contents, such as CTSB for cleaving pro-survival proteins and
  consequently trigger necroptosis. (B) MLKL also plays a pivotal role in lysosomal
  autophagy. MLKL can promote the phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4EBP1 by enhancing
  the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and inhibiting AMPK phosphorylation, which may impair
  the formation of autophagosomes. In contrast to canonical RIPK3 phosphorylation,
  CaMKII-mediated non-canonical MLKL phosphorylation promotes autolysosomal formation.
  (C) MLKL is also involved in endosomal transport. Multiple receptors on the plasma
  membrane can enter the intracellular region via endocytosis and are delivered to
  the endosomes via endocytic vesicles. MLKL, on the one hand, can strengthen the
  transport of endosomes to multivesicular bodies, thereby expediting the degradation
  of intracellular ligands and receptors and the release of exosomes. On the other
  hand, activated MLKL can further enhance the efficacy of this endosomal transport
  and lead to the release of p-MLKL from extracellular vesicles, thereby preventing
  the aggregation of p-MLKL on the plasma membrane and the severity of necroptosis
