caption: 'Systemic damage responses of the fat body methionine metabolism (A) Methionine
  metabolism in Drosophila. Methionine is converted to SAM by Sams. SAM provides a
  methyl group for various methyltransferases including Gnmt, and becomes SAH. SAH
  is further metabolized into homocysteine, which is either regenerated into methionine,
  or converted into cystathionine through the transsulfuration pathway. SAM also provides
  an aminopropyl group to synthesize polyamines, such as spermidine and spermine.
  SAM: S-adenosylmethionine, Sams: SAM synthase, Gnmt: glycine n-methyltransferase,
  SAH: S-adenosylhomocysteine, CBS: cystathionine β synthase, Ahcy: adenosylhomocysteinases.
  (B) Enhancement of SAM metabolism in the fat body affects energy wasting and aging.
  Defects in apoptosis cause necrosis that triggers a systemic immune response including
  Toll activation in the fat body. dFoxO is activated concomitantly, and induces Gnmt
  that converts SAM into SAH, possibly functioning as an adaptive response against
  energy wasting. As aging proceeds, Gnmt is upregulated in the fat body however SAM
  level is also increased. Enhancing the dFoxO-Gnmt axis rescues age-dependent SAM
  accumulation and extends the lifespan. (C) Fat body methionine metabolism remotely
  regulates local tissue repair. Local disc injury non-autonomously affects methionine
  metabolism in the fat body via an unidentified “Help Me” signal. In turn, appropriate
  regulation of methionine metabolism in the fat body is required for sufficient tissue
  repair in damaged discs.'
