caption: 'Canonical pathway analysis. A Chord diagram presenting a pathway analysis
  of significantly altered proteins in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in critical
  (A) and non-critical (B) patients. Each pathway’s width is determined by the number
  of proteins associated with each pathway. Canonical pathways’ significance (-log(p-value))
  was also compared (C): this analysis showed similar exosome responses in critical
  and non-critical patients. The diseases and disorders analysis (D), molecular and
  cellular functions (E), and physiological system development and function elaboration
  (F) are also shown.'
