caption: 'The role of different signaling pathways in DCM. Diabetes induces the formation
  of AGEs, which can simultaneously induce the activation of NOXs, RAGE and NF-κB
  to induce the excessive production of ROS, followed by the enhancement of oxidative
  stress. The activation of NOXs, RAGE and NF-κB can also cause and inflammation and
  oxidative damage. Oxidative stress can cause cardiomyocyte injury, apoptosis, extracellular
  matrix accumulation, myocardial fibrosis, remodeling, and dysfunction, all of which
  are characteristic of DCM. Nrf2 signaling pathway to produce antioxidant factors
  such as SOD and NQO1 to reduce oxidative damage. AGEs: advanced glycosylation end
  products; RAGE: receptor for AGEs; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; NOX: NADPH oxidase; Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2; ROS: reactive oxygen species; DCM: diabetic cardiomyopathy.'
