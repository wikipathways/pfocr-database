caption: Intracellular trypanosomatid parasites evade the protective role of IFNγ
  signaling by targeting essential components of the JAK-STAT pathway. Gene induction
  by serine(SP)- and tyrosine(YP)-phosphorylated STAT1 including interferon-regulatory
  factor 1 (IRF1), inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and STAT1 is crucial for the anti-parasite
  actions of this pathway. The model depicts the inhibition of STAT1 transcriptional
  activity by parasite-mediated dephosphorylation of STAT1 serine 727 (as shown for
  T. cruzi.) and activation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 (in L. donovani-infected
  cells).
