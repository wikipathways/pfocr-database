caption: 'Manipulation of macrophage signaling pathways by L. donovani. L. donovani-derived
  molecules like EF-1α and Fructose 1,6 bisphosphate aldolase activate SHP-1 which
  negatively affects JAK2, STAT1, ERK1/2, and IRAK-1 inhibiting IFN-γ-induced NO production
  and TLR-mediated production of cytokines like IL-12, TNF-α. Impairment of IFN-γ-dependent
  pathway also includes reduced level of JAK2 expression and proteasome-mediated degradation
  of STAT1α. NF-κB-dependent pathway is blocked by impaired degradation of IκB. Other
  than SHP-1, L. donovani also leads to an enhanced expression of MKP3, PP2A, and
  MKP1 by inducing PKCζ, and PKCε respectively. These dual phosphatases or serine/threonine
  phsophatases inhibit p38 (MKP1) and ERK1/2 (MKP3/PP2A) resulting in upregulation
  of IL-10 and downregulation of NO and TNF-α production. PKC-mediated secretion of
  immunosuppressive molecule PGE2 is also observed. Enhanced level of endogenous ceramide
  inhibits PKCβ leading to an impaired oxidative burst. PKC-dependent phosphorylation
  of MARKS and MRP and resulting phagosomal maturation is also inhibited by the parasite.
