caption: The breaking of immune tolerance in ICI therapy. (A) ICI can lift the inhibitory
  signal for the activation of self-reactive lymphocytes (left panel) or prevent the
  apoptosis of effector self-reactive lymphocytes (right panel). (B) Expression of
  immune checkpoint molecules on healthy cells can lead to the destruction of self-cells
  by antibody-mediated mechanisms such as activation of the classical complement pathway
  and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). (C) The effective immune response
  against the tumor cells as a result of ICI can lead to high amounts of cell death,
  which results in the release of many self-antigens in a pro-inflammatory milieu.
  This can enable the activation of self-reactive lymphocytes, which normally have
  low avidity and affinity to the cognate self-antigen and a high activation threshold.
