caption: Schematic presentation of pathogen-induced A20 and its role in promoting
  H. pylori infection. In response to infection by extra- and intracellular pathogens
  (different colored rods), the host activates multiple signaling cascades, one of
  which is the NF-κB signaling pathway. NF-κB-induced A20 can be advantageous for
  pathogen infection. In H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells, A20 participates
  in the apoptotic cell death pathway by deubiquitinylating procaspase-8. Interestingly,
  the scaffold protein p62 is important for this interaction of A20 with procaspase-8.
  These events suppress host apoptotic cell death, which is beneficial for the colonization
  and persistence of H. pylori.
