caption: Signaling pathway models control polar cell growth in root hairs and pollen
  tubes. (A) Illustration of growing root. A root hair emerges from an epidermal cell.
  (B) Higher-magnification image of the dotted square region in A. FER interacts with
  ROPGEF via its cytosolic kinase domain. RHOGEF interacts with and activates RAC/ROP
  via exchanging GTP from GDP. Downstream signaling activates NADPH oxidase to produce
  ROS, leading to influx of Ca2+ from extracellular space. ROS and Ca2+ enhance tip
  growth. Auxin likely activates ROP signaling to promote tip growth. (C) Illustration
  of a pollen tube reaching an ovule. An ovule contains a female gametophyte consisting
  of an egg cell (EC), a central cell (CC), three antipodal cells (AC), and two synergid
  cells (SC). (D) Higher-magnification image of dotted square region in C. Based on
  the molecular similarity, ANX1/2 may function as a membrane-localized receptor that
  activates downstream ROP signaling for pollen tube elongation. FER expressed in
  synergid cells may release a signal or may sequester putative ligands for ANX1/2,
  leading to the arrest of pollen tube growth and the rupture of the pollen tube.
