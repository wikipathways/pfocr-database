caption: (A) In both flies and mammals, the gut epithelium produces immune effectors,
  including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Epithelial
  cells and immune cells secrete cytokines that stimulate tissue regeneration. The
  Hippo pathway is a conserved regulator of intestinal stem cell (ISC) activity. In
  Drosophila, activation of the JAK-STAT pathway by the cytokine Unpaired 3 (Upd3)
  triggers the release of epidermal growth factors (EGFs) by the stem cell niche,
  which then induces stem cell proliferation. JAK-STAT activation also directly stimulates
  ISC proliferation and differentiation. The Wingless (Wnt/Wg) pathway is a major
  regulator of ISC proliferation in mammals and also promotes tissue regeneration
  through cMyc in the infected Drosophila midgut. The dashed arrows indicate presumed
  activities but as yet are undefined. (B) Gut microbes and viruses coordinately stimulate
  a PDGF-VEGF Receptor and Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase dependent (pvf2/PVR/ERK)
  antiviral response through the Immune Deficiency (Imd) pathway and Cyclin-dependent-kinase
  9 (Cdk9) induction, respectively, in the midgut of Drosophila. The ERK-stimulated
  antiviral activities/effectors have not been determined. In addition, exogenous
  insulin initiates ERK mediated antiviral activity.
