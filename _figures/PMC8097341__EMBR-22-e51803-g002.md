caption: (A) At promoters of actively transcribing genes, high levels of H3K4me3 oppose
  ADD domain and the binding of DNMT3L‐DNMT3A/B to prevent de novo CpG methylation.
  (B) At gene bodies of actively transcribing genes, high levels of H3K36me3 interact
  with PWWP domain of DNMT3B and facilitate its genic localization. (C) A parallel
  pathway operates at the intergenic region, where H3K36me2 interacts with PWWP domain
  of DNMT3A and facilitates its intergenic localization. (D) At repetitive elements
  and retrotransposons, interactions between H3K9 methyltransferases and DNMT3A/B
  enable co‐localization of H3K9me3 and CpG methylation for transcriptional silencing.
