caption: Metabolic pathways changed by pathway engineering in this study. The upregulated
  genes in HLT013 are depicted in bold. The bold arrows show the upregulated steps.
  (A) Purine biosynthetic pathway. By deleting repressors, the route from ribulose
  5-phosphate (R5P) to IMP was enhanced. THF, tetrahydrofolate. (B) Pyrimidine biosynthetic
  pathway. While the supply of precursors was enhanced by amplifying carAB and aspC,
  the pyrBI, pyrC, pyrD, and pyrE genes were unchanged. OAA, oxaloacetic acid. (C)
  Arginine biosynthetic pathway. By deleting repressors, most of the arginine biosynthetic
  genes appeared enhanced, but biosynthesis was not efficient due to significantly
  decreased argG.
