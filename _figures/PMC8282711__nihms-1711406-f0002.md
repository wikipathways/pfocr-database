caption: 'Potential mechanisms by which one carbon metabolism influences early development.
  Maternal intake of one carbon (1C) nutrients may affect the status of 1C nutrients
  in the fetus, thereby influencing biosynthesis of nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids
  and epigenetic regulation, eventually affecting cellular growth and metabolism.
  Maternal 1C nutrient status may also exert its influence via the placenta by modifying
  the mTOR pathway activity and subsequently affecting macronutrient transport to
  the fetus, as well as altering placental epigenetic marks, resulting in secondary
  epigenetic changes in pathways that regulate growth and stress response in the fetus.
  These alterations in placental functions by 1C nutrients eventually affect fetal
  growth and metabolism. Taken together, maternal one carbon metabolism programs developmental
  and metabolic pathways early in life, thereby exerting lasting impacts on functional
  outcomes such as neurocognitive development, body size and cardiometabolic differences.
