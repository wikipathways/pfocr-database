caption: Cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) actions in β-cells. Activation of CB1R downregulates
  glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1R and insulin receptor (IR) activation, which, in turn,
  diminishes GLP-1-mediated insulin secretion, and also reduces Akt phosphorylation
  and its downstream signaling pathways. Activation of CB1R activates the MAPK pathway
  and induces caspase 3 cleavage and expression of transcription factors that would
  lead to a metabolic shift in β-cells. Direct or indirect CB1R action on mitochondria
  in β-cells remains to be determined, but together with CB1R induction of ceramide
  synthesis, the metabolic shift induces increased intracellular oxidative stress.
  Altogether, chronic overactivation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in β-cells
  leads to reduced function, i.e., decreased insulin secretion, reduced proliferation,
  activated resident macrophages, and reduced β-cell viability.
