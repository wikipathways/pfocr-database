caption: Hypoxia-driven immune escape within the tumour microenvironment (TME). The
  hypoxic environment promotes tumour production of interleukin (IL)-10 to recruit
  myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-cells (Tregs) to the TME.
  Hypoxia-induced expression of CC-chemokine ligand 28 (CCL28) and CXCL12 recruits
  Tregs to the TME. Hypoxia inducible factors (HIF)-1α and -2α transcriptionally upregulate
  vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) to promote proangiogenic signalling
  in addition to recruiting Tregs to the TME. The HIF pathway also increases glucose
  transporters (GLUTs) to support substrate provision for tumour glycolysis. Upregulation
  of PD-L1 on tumour cells is HIF-1α-dependent. Impaired maturation and reduced production
  of cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ in dendritic cells (DCs) occurs in hypoxic
  environments. Upregulation of inhibitor programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on
  DCs, Tregs, macrophages and MDSCs are all dependent on HIF signalling. TME Hypoxia
  regulates the expression of inhibitory checkpoint proteins. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
  antigen-4 (CTLA-4), lymphocyte activating 3 (LAG3), T-cell immunoglobulin domain
  and mucin domain 3 (TIM3) and PD-1 are up-regulated on CD8+ T-cells in a HIF-1α-dependent
  manner.
