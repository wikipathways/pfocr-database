caption: '(A) The fatty acid and DSF family signal biosynthetic pathway in the Xcc
  strain. Abbreviations: Acc, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FabD, malonyl-CoA ACP transacylase;
  FabH, 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III; FabG, 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; FabZ/A, 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP
  dehydratase; FabB/F, 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I/II; FabV, enoyl-ACP reductase; and,
  RpfF, acyl-ACP thioesterase/dehydratase. (B) Proposed model for interplay of RpfF,
  RpfB, and FabH in Xcc. The reactions catalyzed by RpfF, RpfB, and FabH are shown
  on the top of the figure. The interplay of RpfF, RpfB, and FabH are shown on the
  bottom of the figure.'
