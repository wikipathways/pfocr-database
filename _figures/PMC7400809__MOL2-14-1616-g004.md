caption: Mechanism of action of TET inhibitors. (A) Direct inhibition. A novel compound
  discovered by Chua et al. [], Bobcat 339 emerged from a selection of different TET
  enzyme inhibitors as the most successful on inhibiting the enzyme function by binding
  its Cl residue on the pocket reserved for Me. The drug blocks both TET1 and TET2
  enzymes and does not interact with other methylation enzymes such as DNMTs. (B)
  Indirect inhibition. JAK/STAT pathway is involved in TET1 transcription, and STAT
  inhibitor UC‐514321 seems to stop aberrant TET1 function found in AML according
  to Jiang et al. []. (C) Indirect inhibition. SP1 appears to be a transcription factor
  involved in TET1 transcription, and as in the case of UC‐514321, blocking TET1 transcription
  and translation in AML gives promising results avoiding the spread of the malignancy.
