caption: COVID-19 increased SERPING1 and the encoded protein, C1 esterase inhibitor,
  a central regulator of coagulation and complement regulation, regardless of symptom
  severity. (A–D) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) “Complement System” canonical pathway;
  yellow and blue fill denotes significantly (FDR<0.01) increased or decreased log2
  fold-regulation over HC, respectively. (A and C) Overlaid differential expression
  (DE) values of RNA when compared to HC for groups 2 and 1, respectively. Grayed
  molecules are in the dataset but do not meet the cutoff of more than 2-fold regulated
  with FDR<0.01. (B and D) Overlaid serum protein values for patients with non-severe
  and severe COVID-19, respectively, compared to healthy controls. Values and FDR
  calculations were performed as in Shen et al. []. The corresponding gene names are
  displayed, although these data represent differentially abundant serum proteins.
  Grayed molecules are in the dataset but do not meet the cutoff of FDR<0.01. The
  key to each gene name can be found in the S5 Table.
