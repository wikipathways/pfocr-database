caption: 'Potential therapeutic effects of ezetimibe on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
  and steatohepatitis (NAFLD and NASH). On the basis of the lipotoxicity model of
  NAFLD and NASH [], it has been proposed that metabolites of unesterified fatty acids
  may induce lipotoxic hepatocellular injury manifested as ER stress, inflammation,
  apoptosis, necrosis, and dysmorphic features such as ballooning and Mallory-Denk
  body formation. The generation of lipotoxic metabolites of fatty acids often takes
  place in parallel with the accumulation of triglyceride droplets (steatosis) in
  the liver. A high-fat diet often causes insulin resistance, a state that is associated
  with hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. Because insulin resistance promotes an
  excessive flow of fatty acids from adipose tissue and also impairs peripheral glucose
  disposal, these alterations increase the need for fatty acid disposal in the liver
  through oxidative pathways and through the formation of triglyceride which is then
  either stored temporarily as lipid droplets or secreted as VLDL. Furthermore, elevated
  blood insulin and glucose activate transcription factors SREBP-1c to increase hepatic
  lipogenic gene expression. In addition, intestinal cholesterol absorption promotes
  hepatic lipogenesis via cholesterol-dependent activation of LXR. Ezetimibe treatment
  could block (i) intestinal fatty acid absorption, which could reduce a delivery
  of fatty acids from the gut to the adipose tissue through the chylomicron pathway;
  (ii) diet-induced insulin resistance in part by reducing intestinal fatty acid absorption;
  (iii) cholesterol-driven lipogenesis by inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption,
  which together may substantially reduce the burden of fatty acids on the liver.
