  under study (acids, alcohols, esters, monoterpenic compounds, norisoprenoids, sesquiterpenic
  compounds, sulfur compounds, and volatile phenols), taking into account that they
  can be formed from raw materials and/or produced and biotransformed along brewing,
  also the main associated metabolic pathways were highlighted (magnifying glass)
