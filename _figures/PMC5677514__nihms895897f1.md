caption: (a) Hypothetical prodigiosin (1) biosynthetic pathway in P. rubra (by analogy
  to the pathway elucidated in Serratia) and the cyclization of 1 into cycloprodigiosin
  (2) investigated in this work. (b) Comparison of the pig gene cluster in Serratia,
  which produces only 1, and P. rubra, which produces both 1 and 2, shows that pigN
  is absent in the latter. The gene downstream of pigM in P. rubra shows no similarity
  to pigN. Also shown is an excerpt of P. rubra contig 4, which contains PRUB675 and
  PRUB680. Genes in pink have homology to Serratia pig genes and/or to Streptomyces
  red genes. (c) The Rieske monooxygenase-like RedG catalyzes the carbocyclization
  of undecylprodigiosin to form streptorubin B, motivating our search for the enzyme
  responsible for the analogous cyclization of 1 in P. rubra.
