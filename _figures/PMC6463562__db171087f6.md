caption: Proposed scheme for PAHSA synthesis. DNL from glucose to palmitate is controlled
  by ChREBP. Membrane phospholipids (PhL) are oxidized to phospholipid hydroperoxide
  (PhL-OOH), which is further converted to a phospholipid with the hydroxy fatty acid
  (PhL-OH) via GSH-dependent peroxidases. The hydroxy fatty acid (HSA) is liberated
  from the PhL-OH and subsequently coupled to acyl-CoA coming from the DNL pathway
  (PA), yielding a PAHSA, which can be later degraded by specific hydrolases. While
  DNL from glucose is an essential prerequisite for PAHSA synthesis, Nrf2 overexpression
  limits the DNL pathway. Therefore, it seems plausible that fine-tuning of enzymatic
  and nonenzymatic cellular antioxidant defenses and coordination with the DNL pathway
  is needed for PAHSA synthesis and that substrate specificity of peroxidases/phospholipases
  might play a role in the synthesis of individual regioisomers.
