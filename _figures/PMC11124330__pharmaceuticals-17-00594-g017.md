caption: Schematic illustration of this study. BEPD regulates neutrophil recruitment
  and chemotaxis by inhibiting the release of S100A8/A9 and downregulating the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
  signaling pathway. Consequently, the release of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and LDH, as
  well as chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL3 and CXCL5), is reduced, which ultimately protects
  the vaginal mucosa of VVC mice
