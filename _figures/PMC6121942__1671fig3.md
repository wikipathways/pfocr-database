caption: 'Pathway analysis. A: FA synthesis pathways in infected cells demonstrated
  by comparing the 3 hpi time point to the 2 hpi time point. B: Active pathways in
  infected cells comparing 2 hpi to baseline (time 0). Green and red arrows show reactions
  with positive and negative Z-scores, respectively, thus showing pathways with increased
  and decreased reactivity. The boxes highlight potential changed pathways based on
  Z-scores.'
