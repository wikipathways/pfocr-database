caption: 'The light-blue box summarizes the effect of Bacopa on the three transcription
  factors identified by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Bacopa activates ATF4
  and NRF2, while it inhibits the function of FOXO3. The color of boxes and arrows
  indicates the effects of Bacopa: green indicates increase/activate, orange indicates
  decrease/inhibit. Blue boxed are three biological endpoints: learning & memory,
  neuroprotection, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Explanation of the numbered connections:
  (1) ATF4 and NRF2 functionally interact with each other [–]. (2) ATF4 is implicated
  in memory [–]. (3) NRF is implicated in memory [–]. (4) Translation initiation factor
  eIF2-alpha stimulates translation of ATF4 [–]. (5) eIF2-alpha is implicated in memory
  formation [, ]. (6) ATF4 has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [–]. (7)
  NRF2 has also been linked to AD [, , , ]. (8) NRF2 plays a critical role in neuroprotection
  [–]. (9) FOXO3 mediates oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death [–]. Inhibition
  of FOXO3 by Bacopa could explain its neuroprotective effect.'
