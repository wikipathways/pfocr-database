caption: 'Impacts of DDR alterations on immune system in cancers. (A) Correlations
  of DNA damage and repair with STING pathway in tumor microenvironment. The STING
  pathway can be activated by DNA damaging agents or DDR alterations. Cytosolic DNA
  sensor cGAS can activate innate immune responses by catalyzing cGAMP synthesis,
  which roles as a second messenger in the activation of STING pathway. The activation
  of STING pathway makes a conformation change of STING, which leads to an endoplasmic
  reticulum to perinuclear endosome shuttling. TBK1 can phosphorylate STING as well
  as IRF3, therefore, promoting the production of type I IFNs. Besides, expression
  of RAE1 can activate NK cells. A hypothesis regarding the mechanisms of STING in
  spontaneous anti-tumor immunity has been put forward: dying tumor cells are engulfed
  by DCs, while free tumor DNA is recognized by cGAS, leading to the secretion of
  IFN α/β to improve DCs'' cross-presentation to enhance T cell activation. DNA damage
  in tumor cells can also cause the activation of natural-killer cells mediated by
  the expression of retinoic acid early transcript 1 (RAE1) through STING pathway.
  (B) DDR deficiencies improve tumor recognition through generating neoantigens. The
  neoantigen hypothesis is that a non-synonymous mutation leads to the change of an
  amino acid, which produces a new peptide. Therefore, cancer cells with DDR-deficiency
  can be recognized as the foreign by immune system. (C) DNA damage signaling and
  DDR deficiencies role as important regulators in upregulating PD-L1 expression.
