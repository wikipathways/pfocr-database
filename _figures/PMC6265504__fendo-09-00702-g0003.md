caption: Regulative mechanisms of brain SIRT1 in metabolic homeostasis. Brain SIRT1
  increases energy expenditure via the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis and increased
  sympathetic nerve activity in the adipose tissue. In addition, hormones, such as
  leptin, insulin, and ghrelin through brain SIRT1 to balance energy expenditure and
  energy intake. For example, SIRT1 in POMC neurons deacetylate Forkhead box protein
  O1 (FOXO1) to increase the insulin signal pathway.
