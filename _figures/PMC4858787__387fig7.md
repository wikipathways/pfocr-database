caption: TRX-1 regulates SKN-1 nuclear localization cell non-autonomously. TRX-1 expressed
  in the ASJ neurons negatively controls nuclear localization of intestinal SKN-1,
  independently of its redox activity, probably through an unknown signaling intermediate.
  Two possible models by which ASJ-localized TRX-1 could cell non-autonomously direct
  SKN-1 nuclear localization in the intestine are shown. (1) A novel modification
  of SKN-1 could occur that results in p38 MAPK pathway-dependent nuclear localization
  of SKN-1, but not activation. (2) An alteration in signaling through the p38 MAPK
  pathway activity could cause SKN-1 localization without concurrent transcriptional
  activation.
