caption: Summary of the postulated protective mechanism of cilastatin against gentamicin-induced
  AKI. Megalin, an endocytic receptor located in the cholesterol lipid rafts on the
  brush border apical side of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, is the main
  route for the entry and accumulation of gentamicin. On the left panel, intracellular
  gentamicin promotes direct tubular damage affecting the mitochondria and increased
  Fas expression that leads (after its clustering with FasL) to apoptosis and cell
  death and finally to oxidative stress and inflammation, which exacerbates and amplifies
  the kidney injury. On the right panel, cilastatin binding to the brush border membrane
  dehydropeptidase-I (DHP-I) in cholesterol lipids rafts causes a significant reduction
  in gentamicin uptake and cancels the initial step of extrinsic pathway of gentamicin-induced
  proximal cell apoptosis, reducing caspase 8, 3 and 9 activations, and oxidative
  and proinflammatory signaling pathways, thereby protecting tubular cells. ROS, reactive
  oxygen species.
