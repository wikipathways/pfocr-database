caption: Hypothetical model of the neural networks affected in PDD and corresponding
  cognitive deficits. Solid arrows correspond to direct neural connections and colours
  are indicative of the primary neurotransmitter involved as shown in the key. Dashed
  arrows connect the relevant dysfunctional neural network to its putative cognitive
  effects. Purple arrows indicate that a deficit in one cognitive domain contributes
  to the development of impairment in another domain. Black crosses indicate damage
  to a neural pathway. The red dashed arrow represents direct projections from prefrontal
  cortex to the NBM, permitting top-down control of attention from the fronto-parietal
  network via recruitment of this latter structure and its cortical projections. The
  limbic, orbitofrontal and associative circuits in the prefrontal cortex correspond
  to the dissociable fronto-striatal loops of . Note effects of levodopa therapy at
  improving and worsening executive functions reliant on cognitive flexibility and
  learning from feedback, respectively. Electrocortical activation refers to cortical
  EEG desynchonization indicative of the awake/alert state as described in the text,
  and is driven by corticopetal cholinergic input from the NBM only. Both cholinergic
  input from NBM and noradrenergic input from the locus ceruleus (LC) modulate processing
  in sensory cortices to facilitate orienting of attention to stimuli. Cx = cortex;
  DLPFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; fx = function; GPi = globus pallidus (internus);
  PPC = posterior parietal cortex; SNpc = substantia nigra pars compacta; VLPFC =
  ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; VTA = ventral tegmental area.
