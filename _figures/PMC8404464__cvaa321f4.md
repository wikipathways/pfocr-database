caption: Network analysis to identify novel disease mediators. A network approach
  has enabled a number of novel disease mechanism discoveries. Notable examples include
  the vitamin D receptor (VitDR) and interleukin (IL)-10 pathways in pre-eclampsia
  (upper left), NEDD9 in PAH (upper right), 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit
  3 (PSMD3) in valvular calcification (lower left), and nuclear factor of activated
  T cells 4 (NFATC4) in type 2 diabetes (DM2) (lower right). (upper left) Network
  analysis of 348 differentially expressed vitamin D-associated genes in peripheral
  blood of pre-eclampsia patients identified the network modules specific to the changes
  in maternal immune responses. Of these, the IL-10 signalling pathway was noted to
  be closely interacting with the vitamin D signalling pathway with notable down-regulation
  of IL-10 signalling in pre-eclampsia patients. (upper right) Betweenness centrality
  analysis of a novel network consisting of ALDO-regulated genes associated with vascular
  fibrosis identified NEDD9 as a novel mediator of PAH pathogenesis. (lower left)
  Construction of the proteomics subnetworks involving the proteins overrepresented
  in the calcific stages of human calcific aortic valve disease in the fibrosa layers
  and betweenness centrality analysis identified fibronectin-1, PSMD3, and PSMA1 as
  the potential key disease mediators involved in valvular calcification. (lower right)
  Control centrality analysis of the human pancreatic islet tissue-specific gene regulatory
  network developed from diabetic and non-diabetic donors identified multiple biological
  pathways driving the type 2 diabetes disease network with NFATC4 as a key controller
  of these pathways. Adapted from refs,,, with permission.
