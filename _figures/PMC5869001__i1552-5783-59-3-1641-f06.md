caption: Hypothesized KS biosynthetic pathway in the absence of functional β3GnT7.
  We hypothesize that without operative β3GnT7, GlcNAc cannot be added to its Gal
  substrate (shown by a red X over GlcNAc) to form the KS repeating disaccharide.
  Without a terminal GlcNAc residue, perhaps the catalytic addition of Gal, GlcNAc,
  and sulfate cannot repeat as normal (red X over arrowed loop), resulting in an atypically
  shortened KS structure.
