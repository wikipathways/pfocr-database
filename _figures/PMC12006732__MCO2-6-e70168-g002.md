caption: 'Communication between the gut microbiota and the brain. (A) Signals are
  transmitted to the enteric nervous system via the vagus nerve and spinal efferent
  nerves. At the same, gut microbiota components can directly interact with the enteric
  nervous system and its associated vagal and spinal afferent nerves. (B) Gut microbiota
  components or metabolites regulate the secretion of neuropeptides. Gut microbiota
  engage in bidirectional interactions with neuroendocrine signaling pathways mediated
  by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Abbreviations: CRH, corticotropin
  releasing hormone; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone. (C) The gut microbiota and
  its metabolites influence immune homeostasis, leading to localized proinflammatory
  or anti‐inflammatory immune responses. They can also promote the activation of microglia
  and astrocytes, exacerbating neuroimmune reactions (created in BioRender. Yang,
