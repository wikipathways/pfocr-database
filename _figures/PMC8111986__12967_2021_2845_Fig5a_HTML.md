caption: An integrative analysis of multiomics analyses and prognostic impacts according
  to immune classes. a Venn diagrams show different genes between the immune class
  and the non-immune class (left) or the exhausted class and the active immune class
  (right) affected by at least one of the indicated CNV, DEG, lncRNA, miRNA, protein
  or SNP events. The KEGG pathway network was constructed using the most significantly
  enriched pathways (p < 0.05) in the immune class (b), non-immune class (c), and
  exhausted and active immune subgroups (d). e, f The network of protein–protein interactions
  was constructed using the key genes in the KEGG pathway network in the immune class
  and non-immune class. g The Kaplan–Meier survival curves, including all the key
  nodes within the protein–protein interaction network, showed that 5 mRNAs were significant
  for predicting patient overall survival in the immune class, non-immune class and
  exhausted class. h 5 mRNAs expression was evident in 2 validation datasets. *p < 0.05;
