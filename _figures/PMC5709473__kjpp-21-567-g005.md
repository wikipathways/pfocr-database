caption: As a caspase-dependent pathway, obesity increases the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and
  facilitates mPTP opening. Upon mPTP opening, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria
  to the cytosol. Released cytochrome c activates caspase-9 and cleaves caspase-3.
  Cleaved caspase-3 induces DNA fragmentation, leading to apoptosis. The relationship
  between obesity and the caspase-independent pathway has been rarely studied. ↓,
