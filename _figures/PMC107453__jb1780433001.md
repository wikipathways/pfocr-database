caption: Schematic representation of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway showing the
  deduced role of the RhlG protein in the production of rhamnolipids and PHAs. Initiation
  of the fatty acid biosynthetic cycle, catalyzed by FabH, requires acetyl-CoA and
  malonyl-ACP to form aceto-acetyl-ACP. Subsequent cycles are initiated by condensation
  of malonyl-ACP with acyl-ACP, catalyzed by FabB and FabF. In the second step, the
  resulting β-ketoester is reduced to a β-hydroxyacyl-ACP by FabG. The third step
  in the cycle is catalyzed by either FabA or FabZ. The fourth and final step is the
  conversion of trans-2-enoyl-ACP to acyl-ACP, a reaction catalyzed by FabI. TDP-r,
