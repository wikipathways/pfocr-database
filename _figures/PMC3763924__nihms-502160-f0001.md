caption: 'Pathways of ICL repair. Replication-independent mechanisms are highlighted
  in the pink box (left). Four steps are shown (left). Three distinct mechanisms can
  sense ICL lesions (indicated by a red line) (top): repair proteins recognizing distortion
  in the DNA helix (left column), a transcribing polymerase (middle column) or a replisome
  blocked by the lesion (right column). Recognition can occur through dedicated repair
  enzymes (NER or MMR) or following collision during DNA transactions. Several nucleases
  are thought to participate in the incision steps (second row), however, their exact
  sites of action are not defined. XPR/ERCC1, by analogy with NER, is thought to act
  5′ of the ICLs, whereas the 3′ nuclease acting in RIR is not known (?). The FA pathway
  regulates the activity of nucleases in the replication-dependent pathway. FANCM
  facilitates fork regression whereas other FA proteins could recruit nucleases. Specific
  translesion synthesis nucleases participate in distinct repair pathways (third row):
  Polκ and Polζ in replication-independent repair and Rev1 and Polζ in the replication-dependent
  pathway. More than one DNA polymerase could be involved in the repair of an ICL.
  Replication-dependent ICL repair generates a DSB intermediate (bottom left), which
  is ultimately repaired via homologous recombination.'
