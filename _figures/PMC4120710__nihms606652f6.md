caption: Activation of G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTK) initiates activation of parallel signaling cascades that culminate in actin
  filament remodeling, changes matrix adhesiveness and regulation of myosin II motors
  that generate traction force. Immediate post-receptor events include activation
  of trimeric G proteins, Src family tyrosine kinases, phospholipase C (PLC) and PIP2,
  PI3-kinases (PI3-K) and increased Ca2+. Multiple small G proteins (RhoA, Rac, Cdc42)
  and calmodulin (CaM) then activate downstream targets that are shown here in darker
  shades of red. Some targets are effector proteins that regulate actin polymerization
  including the formins (mDIA1 and mDIA2), WAVE and WASP and the ARP2/3 complex. Other
  targets include members of the MAP kinase family (p38 MAPK and ERK), Rho kinases
  (ROCK) and p21-activated protein kinases (PAK). The signaling kinases phosphorylate
  other protein kinases (MAPKAPK, LIMK) or phosphatases (MLCP) to regulate effector
  proteins (dark blue ovals) that control actin polymerization and traction forces
  generated by myosin II. Most of the schematic is organized as sets of parallel linear
  signaling cascades, which is an oversimplification for the sake of clarity. Pathway
  convergence and crosstalk are known to occur between the pathways shown. Regulation
  of MLCK is a good example where both positive and negative inputs are integrated
  to determine the level of myosin II regulatory light chain phosphorylation and traction
  force. Reprinted from Gerthoffer271 by permission of the American Heart Association.
