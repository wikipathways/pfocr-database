caption: 'Hypoxia inducible factor and VEGF link the HIF/VHL and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathways. Vascular endothelial growth factor, together with other external growth
  factors, activates Akt, which in turn activates mTORC1 complex The PI3K (phosphoinositide
  3-kinase) pathway may be overactive because of faulty or deficient phosphatase and
  tensin homolog (PTEN). mTORC1 is a protein complex that functions as a specific
  controller of protein synthesis. It is composed of mTOR itself, a regulatory-associated
  mTOR protein named Raptor, mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (MLST8) and GβL,
  a positive regulator of the rapamycin-sensitive pathway required for the nutrient-sensitive
  interaction between Raptor and mTOR. What is striking is that it has been shown
  that mTORC1 complex, when up-regulated, subsequently up-regulates the expression
  of HIF-1α subunit (–).Under conditions of lower oxygen tension (hypoxia), VHL tumor
  suppressor protein becomes inactivated, which results in constitutive activation
  of the HIF pathway. HIF protein is heterodimeric; it consists of two constitutively
  expressed subunits: β-subunit and an oxygen-sensitive α-subunit. The latter is not
  degraded in such conditions; therefore, it translocates to the nucleus. Inside the
  nucleus, it undergoes dimerization with HIF-β subunit to form transcriptionally
  active HIF. In consequence, HIF as a transcription factor starts to regulate many
  biological processes via hypoxia-inducible genes, such as: SDP1 (scan domain containing
  protein), GLUT1 (glucose-transporter 1), LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), EPO (erythropoietin),
  ADM (adrenomedullin), PDGFR-β (platelet-derived growth factor-β), TGF-α (tumor growth
  factor-α). Other genes activated by mTORC1 complex: p70S6 kinase, 4E-BP1 (4E-binding
  protein 1), eiF-4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E) (–).Under conditions
  of normal oxygen tension (normoxia), HIF-α subunit is hydroxylated by specific prolyl-hydroxylases
  and subsequently targeted for rapid proteasomal degradation. This is done by the
  VHL tumor suppressor protein, which is active at the time. In other words, HIF protein
  is degraded in proteasome when prolyl-hydroxylated α-subunits are targeted to the
  process of ubiquitination. It occurs by high-affinity binding to the VHL E3 ubiquitin
  ligase. Tumorigenic processes do not occur (, ).'
