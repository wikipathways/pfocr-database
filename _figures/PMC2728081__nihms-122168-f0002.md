caption: Ag triggering of the BCR initiates activation of PTKs Syk and Lyn. Syk activates
  the PI3K pathway, responsible for catalyzing the formation of PIP3. Bam32 and p47phox
  are recruited to the cell surface when the SHOP phosphatase converts PIP3 to PI(3,4)P2.
  Lyn phosphorylates Y139 on Bam32, a key step in Bam32's ability to modulate downstream
  pathways. Bam32 and the NADPH oxidase compete not only for access to a limited pool
  of inositol lipids but also for a limited pool of the small GTPase Rac. Retardation
  of Bam32 KOI B-cell entry into the cell cycle may be due in part to enhanced BCR-induced
  superoxide generation.
