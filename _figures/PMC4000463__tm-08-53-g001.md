caption: JAK2 receptor signaling and activation of STAT pathway. The binding of erythropoietin
  (EPO) to a receptor results in receptor dimerization of JAK2. This dimerization
  leads to phosphorylation of STAT3 and 5 and formation of stable homodimers and heterodimers
  which subsequently induce transcription of genes that regulate the cell proliferation
  and survival. The JAK2V617F mutation can cause the monotonous activation of STAT
  pathway in the absence of any other trigger. Furthermore, activation of MPL can
  initiate the downstream signaling cascade of JAK2 via recruitment of Src homology
  2 (SH2) which can stimulate RAS protein and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) leading
  to transcriptional activity of certain genes.
