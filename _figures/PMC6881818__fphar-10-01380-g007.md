caption: A working model of CQ, OT, V1AR, and Mas-related G protein-coupled receptors
  (Mrgprs) in mice skin. CQ activates Mrgprs and excited the afferent nerve fibers
  in the skin, then induces scratching behavior. In addition, CQ also stimulates the
  release of OT from keratinocytes (a source of local OT), which potentiates CQ-induced
  itch via triggering NO release through activation of V1AR signaling pathway. CQ,
  chloroquine; OT, oxytocin; V1AR, vasopressin-1a receptor; NO, nitric oxide.
