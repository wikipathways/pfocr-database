caption: 'Dopamine Receptor Signaling: Genes differentially expressed in the NAC of
  LE vs. SD rats are significantly over represented in the dopamine-receptor signaling
  pathway. In LE rats, COMT, DRD1a and ADCY5 mRNA levels in the NAC (red-filled shapes)
  are higher than in SD rats. In contrast, MAO(b), ADCY4, PDE10A, PKA (Prkag2) and
  PP1 (Ppp1r3c) (green-filled shapes) exhibit reduced expression in LE rats compared
  to SD rats. Adapted from Ingenuity ® System''s database of canonical pathways for
  Dopamine Receptor Signaling. Where the biochemical annotation in the Ingenuity canonical
  pathway differs from the gene symbol used by Affymetrix (see ), the Affymetrix gene
  symbol is included in parentheses.'
