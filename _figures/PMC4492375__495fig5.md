caption: Model for how SUMOylation of ZTF-8 regulates its germline functions. In wild-type
  animals, we propose that SUMOylation (blue circle) of ZTF-8 is required for meiotic
  DSBR as well as for the proper localization of the 9-1-1 complex, which results
  in DNA damage checkpoint activation (left). An interaction with a yet unknown SUMOylated
  protein(s) (gray oval with blue circle), perhaps via a SIM (SUMO interaction motif)
  at ZTF-8, could explain how the non-SUMOylatable ZTF-8 is still localized properly;
  however, it does lead to inefficient DSBR and DDR activation due to lack of interactions
  between ZTF-8 and the 9-1-1 complex (middle). A defective SUMOylation pathway may
  hinder the proper localization of ZTF-8 due to the absence of SUMOylation in another
  protein (gray oval), and this leads to impaired DSBR and DDR (right).
