caption: Pathogenesis of HMGB1 in atopic dermatitis. After the skin of patients with
  atopic dermatitis is damaged by impairment of the skin barrier, microbial infection
  or scratch, keratinocytes (KCs) produce HMGB1, which binds to Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) on the surface
  of KCs, after which the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3Ks)/AKT serine/nuclear factor-κB
  (PI3K/AKT/NF-κb) pathway or the extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK)/NF-κB
  pathway is activated. This leads to the production of the proinflammatory cytokines
  interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). In contrast, HMGB1
  binds to TLR4 or RAGE located on the surface of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, which promotes
  the activation and secretion of IL-6 by Th2 cells and promotes an immune response
  in patients with atopic dermatitis during disease progression
