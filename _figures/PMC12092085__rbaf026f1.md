caption: Mechanism by which magnesium promotes osteogenesis. (A) Schematic showing
  how the TRPM7/PI3K signalling pathway mediated by magnesium ions promotes osteogenesis
  and resistance to alkaline stress-induced cytotoxicity in human osteoblasts. Adapted

  Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved. (B) Schematics showing the release of Mg2+ through
  Mg2+ transporters or channels (i.e. MAGT 1 and TRPM 7) and the promotion of CGRP-vesicle
  accumulation and exocytosis. The CGRP released by DRGs in turn activates the CGRP
  receptor (composed of CALCRL and RAMP 1) in PDLSCs, which triggers the phosphorylation
  of CREB 1 via cAMP and promotes the expression of genes that contribute to osteogenic
  differentiation. Adapted and reproduced from Ref. [2]. (C) Schematic showing the
  mechanism by which Mg2+ regulates macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells during
  bone healing. Figure is licenced under CC by-NC-ND 4.0 [3]. Copyright © 2021, the
