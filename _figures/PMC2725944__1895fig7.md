caption: ATM acts as a binary switch to control the contribution of p53 signaling
  to the DNA damage response. The DNA damage response can be subdivided into three
  major functional components—cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. (A) In
  p53-proficient cancer cells, ATM signaling contributes largely to apoptosis (highlighted
  in orange). (B) Loss of p53 in tumor cells dramatically reduces apoptosis and redirects
  ATM signaling to mediate a robust cell cycle (highlighted in orange). In addition,
  ATM contributes to HR-mediated DSB repair. The net result of this rewired ATM signaling
  is increased cellular survival in response to DNA damage. (C) Loss of ATM dramatically
  attenuates apoptotic signaling through p53 and instead promotes a p53-mediated cell
  cycle arrest (highlighted in orange). ATM-deficient cancer cells expressing functional
  p53 rely on the DNA-PKcs-mediated NHEJ pathway to repair chemotherapy-induced DSBs
  (highlighted in orange). Pharmacological abrogation of DNA-PKcs signaling selectively
  sensitizes ATM-deficient p53-expressing cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of
  DNA-damaging chemotherapy. (D) The combined loss of ATM and p53, albeit rare in
  human tumors, prevents the execution of functional cell cycle checkpoints and promotes
  death of chemotherapy-treated cancer cells due to mitotic catastrophe. In addition,
  therapeutic targeting of ATM in p53-deficient cancer cells results in a dramatically
  increased chemosensitivity of p53-deficient cancer cells.
