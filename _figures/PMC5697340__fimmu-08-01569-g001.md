caption: Overview of stages of innate lymphoid cell (ILC) development. (A) Current
  understanding of the regulation of peripheral ILC subsets. A variety of different
  transcription factors are required for the development of peripheral ILC subsets.
  Key transcription factors (red) are responsible for the lineage determination of
  the canonical ILC subsets (top panel). ILC subsets can also be further differentiated
  and categorized based on the organ in which they reside, functional differences,
  or the expression of different receptors and surface markers (middle panel). In
  response to activation signals, ILCs are able to produce effector molecules and
  cytokines to mediate an appropriate immune response (bottom panel). (B) Schematic
  showing the current understanding of ILC development from the common lymphoid progenitor
  (CLP) through multiple intermediary stages on their way to becoming mature ILC subsets
  ILC1, 2, and 3. CLP has multi-lineage potential, including T and B cell fate, but
  this potential is gradually lost as the progenitors differentiate into the more
  lineage restricted αLP. This occurs through the intermediate α4β7+ CLP and αLP/common
  helper-like ILC precursor (CHILP) progenitors or through an alternative pathway
  via the early innate lymphoid progenitors (EILPs). Within the αLP population, the
  natural killer (NK) cell lineage diverges from the ILC lineage and the ILC precursor
  (ILCp) exclusively develops into the remaining mature ILCs in the periphery. (C)
  Dynamic regulation of the surface markers (left panel) and transcription factors
  (right panel) throughout the ILC ontogeny. The graphs show the relative RNA expression
  among the different ILC progenitor stages (100% represents the highest expression
  for each gene detected across the six different populations).
