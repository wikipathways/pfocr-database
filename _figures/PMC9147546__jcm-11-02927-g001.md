caption: 'Schematic representation of how the HIV virus infects and activates lymphocytes
  that increase the production of different inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ).
  These cytokines, in turn, stimulate the maturation of the osteoclast, the cell responsible
  for bone resorption through the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway. The source of RANKL is different
  cells, such as lymphocytes or osteoblasts, in response to inflammatory cytokines.
  HIV: Human Immunodeficiency Virus; RANK: Receptor activator of nuclear factor κ
  B; RANKL: Receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B-Ligand; OPG: Osteoprotegerin.'
