caption: Ubiquitin-dependent signaling cascade plays important roles in recruiting
  DDR fators to sites of DSB. This recruitment relies on K63-linked ubiquitylation
  of histones and other chromatin-binding proteins through RNF8- and RNF168-dependent
  pathway. DSBs are first recognized by MRN complex, triggering the recruitment and
  activation of ATM. ATM phosphorylates H2AX at Ser139 (known as γH2AX), generating
  a binding site for MDC1. ATM-dependent phosphorylation of L3MBTL2 promotes its interaction
  with MDC1 and its recruitment to sites of DSB. Subsequently L3MBTL2 is ubiquitylated
  by RNF8 which recruits RNF168 to sites of DNA damage. RNF168, in turn, monoubiquitylates
  H2A to amplify the DNA damage signal and promote the engagement of ubiquitin-binding
  domain (UBD)-containing repair factors for proper DSB signaling and DSB repair.
  DNA end resection plays a crucial role in dictating DSB repair pathway choice. By
  recognizing both monoubiquitylated H2A K15 and dimethylated H4K20, 53BP1 is recruited
  to DSBs to antagonize BRCA1-dependent end resection via ATM phosphorylation-dependent
  interactions of 53BP1 with its binding partners RIF1 and PTIP. PTIP recruits Artermis
  which trims DNA end and promote NHEJ. RIF1 recruits REV7, the Shielding complex
  (SHLD1–SHLD2–SHLD3) and the CST/Pol α-Prim complex to shield DNA end from BRCA1
  dependent end resetion, thus promote NHEJ. Conversely, BRCA1 antagonizes NHEJ by
  impairing RIF1 retention at DSBs in S phase in a CtIP-dependent manner. BRCA1 is
  recruited by RAP80 which is initially recruited to DSBs through the binding to K63-
  or K6-linked polyubiquitin chains. HR is initiated with two-step DNA end resection
  by MRN-CtIP and DNA2-EXO1 in 5’−3’ direction to generate a long 3’ ssDNA overhang
  which is rapidly coated by replication protein A (RPA). With the help of mediator
  complex BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2, RAD51 displaces RPA to form RAD51-ssDNA filaments which
  perform homology search and strand invasion followed by DNA synthesis at the resected
  strand. RNF138 is required for stimulating CtIP ubiquitylation and accrual at DSB
  sites. Multi-site ubiquitylation of RPA by ubiquitin ligases RFWD3 and PRP19 facilitates
  homologous recombination by as-yet-unknown mechanisms. CRL3KEAP1 can ubiquitylate
  PALB2 to suppress its interaction with BRCA1 and HR and this ubiquitylation is counteracted
  by USP11. The E3 ligase UHRF1 can mediate K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIF1
  which leads to its dissociation from 53BP1 and DSBs, thereby promoting HR.
