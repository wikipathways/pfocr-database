caption: Antioxidant defense mechanisms against oxidative stress in ovarian cancer.
  (A) Role of Nrf2 and CD44v9 in antioxidant defense systems for ovarian cancer. (B)
  Pharmacological inhibition of Nrf2 and CD44v9. Ovarian cancer cells upregulate cellular
  antioxidant capacity to maintain ROS levels below a toxic threshold. The CD44v9/xCT
  and Nrf2 pathways are important antioxidant systems. Sulfasalazine is an inhibitor
  of the CD44v9/xCT pathway. Natural products, synthetic compounds or small interfering
  RNA that suppresses Nrf2 function have been used in preclinical studies to prevent
  cancer progression. However, concurrent inhibition of both pathways can induce ROS-dependent
  lethality in cancer cells. In addition, the CD44v9 and Nrf2 pathways serve the role
  of oncoproteins in certain cancer types. CD44v9, CD44 variant isoform 9; Nrf2, nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; xCT, cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11.
