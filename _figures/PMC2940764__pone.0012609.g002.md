caption: 'Among the physically active members of twin pairs, as compared to their
  inactive co-twins, gene expression in the skeletal muscle was up-regulated for the
  central pathways of energy metabolism and supportive metabolic pathways related
  especially to the processes of oxidative energy production. In fat tissue the pathways
  were related e.g. to branched-chain amino acid degradation and PUFA synthesis. These
  metabolic changes were associated with decreased cardio-metabolic risk, including
  an increase in aerobic fitness. Centroids: OXPHOS, Oxidative phosphorylation; VLI
  deg, Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation; CoQ, Ubiquinone biosynthesis; PRO
  met, Propanoate metabolism; FA metab, Fatty acid metabolism including mitochondrial
  β-oxidation and peroxisomal β-oxidation; BUT met, Butanoate metabolism; TRP met,
  Tryptophan metabolism; F-M met, Fructose and mannose metabolism; CAA deg, Chloroacrylic
  acid degradation; Urea cycle, Urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups; IL2RB,
  IL2RB pathway; PUFA syn, Polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis; RECK, RECK pathway;
