caption: IL-23/IL-17 signaling transduction. IL-23 is important in differentiation
  of Th17 cells, by promoting the production of IL-17A, IL-17F, TNF, and IL-6. IL-23
  is heterodimeric and composed of IL-12p40 and IL-23p19. Binding to its receptors,
  IL-23 involves in phosphorylation of JAKs and TYK, as well as phosphorylation and
  dimerization of STAT3. Subsequently, STAT3 homodimers regulates the expression of
  ROR-γt to promote the gene expression. The combination of IL-17A/A, IL-17A/F, or
  IL-17F/F cytokine with IL-17RA and IL-17RC is found to be a crucial complex of immune
  response. IL-17R acts on Act1 through interaction platform of the SEFIR domain.
  Upon ligand binding, Act1 activates NF-κB, C/EBP family, and MAPK pathway by inducing
  various TRAF proteins. Act1 is essential for mediating ubiquitination of TRAF6,
  then TRAF6 triggers a positive reaction in multiple different pathways. TRAF6 recruits
  and stimulates the TAK1 and IKK complex, leading to activation of NF-κB pathway.
