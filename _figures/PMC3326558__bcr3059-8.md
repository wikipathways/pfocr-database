caption: Schematic illustrating estrogen-dependent regulation of miRNA (miR)-34b expression,
  its target genes and tumor growth. The role of estrogen in the miR-34b-regulating
  pathway is shown. Under 17β-estradiol (E2)-free conditions, p53 and estrogen receptor
  (ER) bind to the miR-34b promoter and activate its transcription. However, in the
  presence of E2 or xenoestrogens, the activated ER disrupts the binding of the p53-ER
  complex to the miR-34b promoter region, which subsequently inhibits the tumor-suppressing
  network and promotes cell proliferation and tumor progression.
