caption: Upon synthesis, β-catenin interacts with cadherins at the adherens junctions,
  whereas plakoglobin interacts with cadherins at the adherens junctions and desmosomes
  (1). The excess β-catenin and plakoglobin proteins are recruited to the destruction
  complex and degraded via the proteasome pathway (2). Excess cytoplasmic β-catenin
  can translocate to the nucleus, bind to TCF and change its activity from a repressor
  to an activator (3). The excess cytoplasmic plakoglobin can take one of several
  fates, depending on the level of β-catenin and its nuclear presence. If the excess
  plakoglobin remains in the cytoplasm, it can indirectly activate TCF by replacing
  β-catenin in adherens junctions, allowing for the interaction of the liberated β-catenin
  with TCF and its transcriptional activation (3). Alternatively, if the excess plakoglobin
  translocates to the nucleus, it can suppress β-catenin-TCF activation (4a), or in
  the absence of nuclear β-catenin, it can interact with TCF and directly lead to
  its transcriptional activation (4b). α-cat, α-catenin; β-cat, β-catenin; E-cad,
  E-cadherin; PG, plakoglobin, DSG, desmoglein, DSC, desmocollin; PKP, plakophillin,
