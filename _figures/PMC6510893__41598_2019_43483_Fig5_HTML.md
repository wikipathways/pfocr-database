caption: The Conserved Response of chickens to NDV infection. The gene network, including
  the five core genes upregulated in response to NDV, and the top Disease & Function,
  the antiviral response, is shown. The data were analyzed through the use of IPA
  (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).
  The red color demonstrates the average upregulation of the genes, the light grey
  are the gene-gene interactions (solid = direct, dashed = indirect) the orange color
  shows activation of that pathway, the dark grey shows the effect is not predicted,
  and the yellow shows findings not consistent with downstream molecules.
