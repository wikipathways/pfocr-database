caption: 'The basic diagram of the biosynthetic pathway of keratin, threonine, and
  wax. Note: (a) Biosynthetic pathway of keratin and threonine; (b) wax biosynthetic
  pathway. PEYP-1-1 was the trace iodine control group of leaves, PEYP-1-2 was the
  moderate iodine exposure group of leaves, and PEYP-1-3 was the excessive iodine
  exposure group of leaves'
