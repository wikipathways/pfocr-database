caption: Endoplasmic reticulum stress promotes the immunosuppressive activity of M2
  macrophages and myeloid‐derived suppressor cells to enhance tumor immune escape.
  (A) PERK enhances the expression of ATF4, thereby promoting serine production and
  facilitating the activation of M2 macrophages. The activation of IRE1α enhances
  the expression of XBP1 and activates signal transducer and activator of transcription
  family members 3 and 6 (STAT3/6), promoting polarization toward the M2 phenotype.
  XBP1 further enhances the expression of signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα)
  on the surface of macrophages. They attach to CD47 on the surface of neoplastic
  cells to emit the “don't eat me” signal. XBP1 also enhances the expression of PD‐L1.
  The overexpression of PD‐L1 elevates the amount of CD206, hence predisposing macrophages
  to the M2 phenotype. (B) IRE1α and ATF6 can both enhance the expression of nitric
  oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) and facilitate the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
  by elevating the amount of XBP1. PERK enhances PMN‐MDSC aggregation by increasing
  the expression of ATF4 and CHOP. Concurrently, CHOP enhances the production of IL‐6
  and arginase 1 (Arg1) to suppress T cell proliferation and function. Besides CHOP,
  PERK also modulates PMN‐MDSC activity through nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related
  factor 2 (NRF2). The targeted elimination of PERK leads to a substantial reduction
  in NRF2 levels, heightened reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and mitochondrial
  dysfunction. Subsequent to mitochondrial depletion, mtDNA levels rise, hence activating
  the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. This activation results in the
  production of IFN‐I and the suppression of NFκB, allowing PERK‐deficient PMN‐MDSCs
  to perform an antitumor function
