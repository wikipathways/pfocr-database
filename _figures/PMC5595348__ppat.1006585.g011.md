caption: Upon infection, viral ssRNAs are recognized by TLR7 to trigger signaling
  events. TLR7 signaling is initiated by binding to MyD88 and IRAK and recruiting
  TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB1/2 to multiple intracellular signaling cascades, including
  p38 MAPK, NF-κB, and IRF3/7 to induce IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines production.
  This study reveals that ssRNA viruses induce HRS, which in turn induces immune and
  inflammatory responses by regulating TLR7 pathway. Initially, virus-induced HRS
  acts as a key component or regulator in TLR7 signaling to facilitate the assembly
  of the TLR7 complex by binding with TLR7 and TAB1. HRS further stimulates NF-κB
  and IRF3 pathway to induce IFNs, resulting in the induction of innate immune response.
  HRS also facilitates NF-κB and p38 pathway to induce proinflammatory cytokines,
  leading to the induction of inflammatory responses.
