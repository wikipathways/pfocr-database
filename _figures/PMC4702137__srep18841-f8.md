caption: 'Cartoon illustration of the role of FZHY during hepatocyte differentiation:
  After the induction of definitive endoderm (DE) from hESC, DE cells were used to
  differentiate towards hepatocytes (hEH) in conjunction with treatment with FZHY.
  FZHY enhanced ERK and Wnt signaling pathways, and these two pathways interact at
  β-catenin. The increase of β-catenin after translocation into nuclei activated TCF1,
  which up-regulated its downstream genes, consequently enhancing the proliferation,
  differentiation and maturation of the differentiating cells. TCF1 down-regulated
  Notch pathway to inhibit the formation of cholangiocytes though up-regulation of
  Numb. In addition, the treatment with FZHY also inhibited the formation of mesenchymal
  cells.'
