caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of type 2 diabetes cardiomyopathy associated remodeling
  and fibrosis. The initial endothelial dysfunction due to chronic hyperglycemia and
  insulin resistance leads to NO depletion and loss of vasorelaxation capabilities.
  Additionally, the disruption of the endothelial cell adhesion process favors increased
  vascular permeability, which allows the migration of M1 macrophages and leukocytes
  that promote myocardial interstitial inflammation and increased ET-1 signaling.
  The M1 macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory signals that promote cardiomyocyte apoptosis
  and DAMPs release converging in an overactivated TGF-β/smad pathway, which leads
  to myocardial remodeling with ECM degradation and subsequent fibrosis, thereby producing
  diastolic dysfunction (HFpEF). The RASS affected due to chronic hyperglycemia increases
  the stimulation of cardiac remodeling pathways through BNP, ANP, and PKC expression
  in cardiomyocytes. The diabetic cardiomyocyte with decreased expression of GLUT4
  satisfies its energy demand through fatty acids but with increased ceramides and
  acylcarnitine synthesis that produce lipotoxicity, which inhibits autophagy and
  perpetuates dysfunctional receptors and other critical proteins for cardiomyocyte
  contractility. Mitochondrial stress, due to fatty acid oxidation, induces ROS and
  DAG production with consequent RAGE and PKC activation with secondary inflammatory
  signals increased expression. All these cellular events converge in the dysfunction
  of calcium intracellular handling with deficient contractile function and the hallmarks
  of HFpEF. NO: Nitric Oxide; ET-1: Endothelin-1; MLC: Myosin Light Chain; DAMP: Damage
