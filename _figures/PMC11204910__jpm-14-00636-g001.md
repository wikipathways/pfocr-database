caption: 'Heme biosynthetic pathway in erythroid cells and the role of ATP-binding
  cassette transporter B7 (ABCB7 gene): The first enzyme of heme synthesis is 5-aminolevulinate
  synthase (ALAS2), which is the rate-limiting enzyme. In the presence of pyridoxal
  phosphate, it condenses glycine and succinyl-coenzyme to form ALA. Mutations in
  the erythroid-specific ALAS2 gene cause X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) by
  impairing the synthesis of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). ALA is transported out
  of the mitochondria into the cytosol to continue the heme synthesis. Ultimately,
  heme synthesis involves the incorporation of ferrous iron into protoporphyrinogen.
  However, hereditary sideroblastic anemia can affect genes that encode proteins involved
  in the synthesis, trafficking, or incorporation of iron–sulfur clusters, such as
  ALAS2, HSPA9, SLC25A38, GLRX5, or ABCB7. In particular, ABCB7 is crucial for hematopoiesis
  and is located at Xp13.3. The ABCB7 gene encodes a mitochondrial transporter of
  the Fe–S cluster. These clusters are initially synthesized as Fe-S intermediates
  within the mitochondria and subsequently transported to the cytoplasm for maturation15
  by the mitochondrial transporter ABCB7. ABCB7 mutations cause a rare recessive X-linked
  sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (XLSA/A) disorder'
