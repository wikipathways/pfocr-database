caption: Schematic illustration of the possible functions of the  Arabidopsis ANP1
  and tobacco NPK1 MAPK pathways.  (A) Cold and H2O2 activate the  AtMPK3 and AtMPK6
  pathway through either an unknown MAPKKK or ANP1,  respectively (). ANP1 activation
  results in induction of  stress-inducible genes and inhibition of auxin-inducible
  genes. Auxin  stimulates auxin-inducible gene expression by an independent pathway.  (B)
  Mitotic regulation of the cell cycle is mediated by  the NPK1 pathway, which also
  consists of the MAPKK Q and MAPK R ().  NACK1, a kinesin-like protein, is an upstream
  activator of NPK1 ().
