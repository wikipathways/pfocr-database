caption: 'Vitamin D synthesis. Main forms of vitamin D in nature are: vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)
  that is photochemically synthesized in plants, and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)
  that is synthesized in the skin of animals and humans in response to sunlight. The
  synthetic pathway involves 25- and 1-alpha-hydroxylation of vitamin D2 and D3, in
  the liver and kidney, respectively. First hydroxylation occurs within the liver
  and lead to the formation of 25(OH)D or calcidiol; second hydroxylation occurs within
  the kidneys and constitutes the most biologically active hormonal form of vitamin
  D: 1,25(OH)2D, or calcitriol.'
