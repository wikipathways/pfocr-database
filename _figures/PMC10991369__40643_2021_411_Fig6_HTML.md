caption: Differential transcription of genes involved in protein processing in the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). With the KEGG annotation result for ER, we also performed
  pathway functional enrichment using phyper, a function of R. Then, we calculated
  the false discovery rate (FDR) for each p-value; in general, the terms for which
  FDR was not larger than 0.05 were defined as significantly enriched
