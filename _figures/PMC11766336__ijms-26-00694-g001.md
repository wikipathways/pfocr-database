caption: The biological functions of lncRNA in malignant brain tumors. (A) LncRNAs
  regulate the expression of target genes by interacting with DNA and forming complexes.
  (B) They can also affect mRNA stability and gene transcription by binding to mRNA.
  (C) LncRNAs have the ability to interact with proteins, influencing signaling pathways
  (such as mTOR, Wnt, MAPK, etc.). Notably, lncRNAs can act as competitive endogenous
  RNAs (ceRNAs), sequestering miRNAs (acting as “sponges”) to prevent miRNA binding
  to their target mRNAs, thereby influencing mRNA stability and indirectly regulating
  signaling pathways. (D) LncRNAs possess “coding” functions, forming micropeptides
  with potential biological activities
