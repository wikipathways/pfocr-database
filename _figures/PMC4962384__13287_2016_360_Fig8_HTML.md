caption: Proposed model for tumor-suppressive effects of ES-CMs. Some factors secreted
  by ES cells could efficiently suppress Stat3 pathway activation in breast cancer
  cells. The Stat3 signaling pathway regulates the expression of E-cadherin, Vegf,
  c-Myc, and Mmp, and is then involved in cancer cell growth, survival, invasion,
  and migration. MMP matrix metalloproteinase, Stat3 signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3, VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor
