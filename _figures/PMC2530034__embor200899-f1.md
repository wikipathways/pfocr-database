caption: Transcriptional regulation and the pathway of RNA polymerase II transcription.
  Signalling pathways activate gene-specific transcription factors that bind to gene-regulatory
  regions. Distant factors can interact with more proximal factors through DNA looping.
  These gene-specific factors can recruit chromatin-modifying factors, as well as
  transcriptional coactivator complexes, to the vicinity of the transcription start
  sites. The coactivators function to recruit, and possibly to stimulate, the activity
  of the transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC). PIC assembly can be modulated
  by the repressors Mot1 and negative cofactor 2 (NC2). On initiation of transcription,
  the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) is phosphorylated at
  Ser 5 by cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7). Transcription elongation in higher eukaryotes
  is often blocked by the action of negative elongation factor (NELF) and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole
  (DRB) sensitivity-inducing factor DSIF (Spt4/5) to generate a paused polymerase.
  This block is overcome by the action of CDK9, which phosphorylates the Pol II CTD
  at Ser 2, as well as at NELF and DSIF. The elongating Pol II with the CTD phosphorylated
  at Ser 2 and Ser 5 recruits factors that are involved in chromatin modification,
  transcription elongation, messenger RNA (mRNA) processing, mRNA transport and termination.
  Chromatin-modifying factors that are associated with the transcription–elongation
  complex function ahead of Pol II to generate a chromatin state that is permissive
  for transcription, and a more repressive state after the passage of Pol II to prevent
  cryptic initiation. Long-range chromatin interactions, for example between insulator
  elements, isolate chromatin domains to prevent the spread of regulatory signals
  and probably also function in other aspects of gene regulation.

  description: Transcriptional regulation and the pathway of RNA polymerase II transcription.
    Signalling pathways activate gene-specific transcription factors that bind to
