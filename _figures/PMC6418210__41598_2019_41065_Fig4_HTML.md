caption: 'Schematic network of sugar and organic metabolism network. The numbers colored
  in red are enzyme identifier number. Differential metabolites are in green boxes
  while the white boxes are other pathway related metabolites. The bars with four
  small blocks in each DEGs or differential metabolites are the relative fold change
  value on 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Orange color means up-regulated under chilling injury
  and green means down-regulated at that time point. The higher the intensity of the
  color, the greater the difference. Solid line between two metabolites means a straight
  reaction while a dashed line means some omission of several metabolites and genes.
  The enzyme identifier meaning are as follows: 1.1.1.22: UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase
  2; 1.1.1.37: malate dehydrogenase; 1.1.1.42: isocitrate dehydrogenase; 1.2.1.12:
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase GAPCP1; 1.2.1.9: NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; 1.2.4.1: pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit; 2.2.1.1: transketolase;
  2.3.1.12: dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase component 4 of pyruvate
  dehydrogenase complex; 2.3.3.8: ATP-citrate synthase; 2.4.1.1: alpha-1,4 glucan
