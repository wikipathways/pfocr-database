caption: The P38 MAPK signaling pathway is regulated by ubiquitination in MASLD. FBXW5
  and TRAF6 stimulate ASK1 activation by increasing ubiquitination and activation
  could be inhibited by OTUB1 and TNFAIP3. Similarly, TAK1 is activated by TRAF3 and
  deactivated by CYLD, USP4 and USP18. TRIM38 and TRIM16 promote the ubiquitination
  degradation of TAB2 and TAK1 respectively. And TRAF5 promotes JAK1 inactivation,
  resulting in inhibition of the P38 MAPK signaling pathway
