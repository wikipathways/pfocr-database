caption: Schematic of the TGF-β signaling pathway, showing the activation cascade
  and points of inhibition (??). Active TGF-β, released from the latent complex by
  the action of thrombospondin, binds to the type II receptor, resulting in the formation
  of an active receptor-signaling complex. This binding is enhanced by accessory receptors,
  whereas the receptor dimerization can be inhibited by membrane-bound inhibitors
  such as bone morphogenic protein and activin membrane bound inhibitor (BAMBI). After
  ligand binding, the receptor SMADs are phosphorylated, dimerize with SMAD-4, and
  translocate to the nucleus where they recruit appropriate cofactors and coactivators
  to stimulate transcription of target genes. TGF-β signaling can be blocked by the
  inhibitory SMADs, SMAD-6 and SMAD-7, which prevent receptor-SMAD activation; and
  by the ras pathway, which can lead to inhibition of nuclear translocation of the
  dimeric SMAD complex. Receptor SMADs can also be degraded following ubiquinylation
  by the ubiquitin ligase SMURF1. Figure adapted from Massagué [].
