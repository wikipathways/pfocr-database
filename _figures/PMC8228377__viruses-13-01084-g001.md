caption: APOBEC3-mediated restriction of HIV-1 and Vif counteraction. (A) An HIV or
  SIV retrovirus integrates into the host genome as a double-stranded DNA provirus
  (red). This provirus is transcribed to produce genomic RNA (gRNA) and mRNA. The
  gRNA is exported to the cytoplasm where it is bound by viral Gag polyprotein to
  facilitate encapsidation (not shown). Additionally, in the cytoplasm are the APOBEC3
  (A3) enzymes A3D, A3F, A3G, A3C S188I, and A3H Haplotypes II, V, and VII. The A3
  enzymes bind the gRNA and become encapsidated if they escape Vif mediated degradation.
  There are also the viral proteins reverse transcriptase (RT), nucleocapsid (NC),
  integrase (IN) among others, with the encapsidated A3. The viral mRNA produces the
  protein Vif later in the replication cycle and with the highest Vif levels correlating
  with virus assembly, to purge the cytoplasm of A3 enzymes. However, Vif-mediated
  degradation is often incomplete. Vif binds CBF-β and Elongin C (EloC) which stabilizes
  Vif and enables nucleation of the Cullin 5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which ubiqutinates
  A3 enzymes and induces their degradation through the proteasome pathway. (B) A3
  enzymes that escape this fate travel to the next target cell of infection within
  the viral capsid. The capsid stays intact during reverse transcription and is drawn
  as an expanded view in a box. Here the viral reverse transcriptase copies the gRNA
  to (−)DNA. This forms a RNA/DNA hybrid (not shown) that is converted to ssDNA by
  the endonuclease action of the RNaseH domain of reverse transcriptase. During this
  short time before (+)DNA synthesis starts, A3 enzymes access ssDNA and inhibit reverse
  transcriptase DNA synthesis from the RNA (round head arrow) or DNA (hatched round
  head arrow) template, but the blockage is more efficient from the RNA template.
  Primarily the A3 enzymes deaminate cytosine (C)→ uracil (U) in a 5’CC or 5’TC context.
  Copying a U in DNA leads to an adenine (A) being inserted on the (+)DNA strand.
  This causes G→A mutations in the coding strand sense. The uracils can be repaired
  by host base excision repair (BER) and the proviral DNA can integrate into the host
  genome. Alternatively, excessive uracils can lead to DNA repair mediated degradation,
  which destroys the proviral DNA. Integrated but mutated proviral DNA can remain
  transcriptionally active but does not produce virions. The mRNA can, however, be
  translated. The defective proteins may be misfolded or truncated leading to their
  degradation in the proteasome which promotes display of their epitopes on the surface
  of infected cells and promotes immune recognition.
