caption: Synthetic pathway for the 68Ga-NOTA-hTf.The synthesis of 68Ga-NOTA-hTf was
  carried out in three reaction steps. Human-apo-transferrin and NOTA were conjugated
  through an isothiocyanate moiety. 68Ga-NOTA-hTf (iron-bound form) was synthesized
  by reacting 68Ga-NOTA-aTf with an excess amount of ferric citrate.
