caption: 'Polθ promotes the annealing of small microhomologies (≥2bp) within resected
  3’ termini and initiate synthesis from minimally paired primers []. One or more
  aborted rounds of synthesis often occur at DSBs with minimal microhomology or in
  A-T rich regions, suggesting that insufficient annealing leads to iterative rounds
  of microhomology search and synthesis aimed at generating de novo microhomologies
  capable of supporting end ligation []. Polθ appears to be capable of using one of
  two substrates as a template for synthesis: i) the opposing 3’ overhang (intermolecular
  synthesis) or ii) upstream sequences of the same molecule via a snap-back mechanism
  (intramolecular synthesis). This mechanism helps to explain the presence of templated
  insertions mapping to nearby sequence at breakpoints repaired by TMEJ: when the
  first round of synthesis is sufficient for completion of repair, a deletion with
  microhomology is produced at the repaired junction, whereas two or more rounds of
  iterative synthesis result in a templated insertion derived from nearby flanking
  sequence (typically within 30bp) [,]. Single-strand annealing (SSA) is a DSB repair
  pathway that involves annealing of homologous repeat sequences flanking a DSB. SSA
  requires long-range DSB end resection to expose stretches of flanking homology or
  homeology (partial homology) that are annealed to form a synapsed intermediate.
  Endonucleolytic cleavage of 3’ flaps followed by ligation can lead to a deletion
  between the repeats. SSA is promoted by proteins involved in end resection (CtIP,
  BRCA1), 3’ ssDNA flap removal (ERCC1, XPF), and annealing (RAD52), but is inhibited
  by RAD51 and factors that inhibit end resection (53BP1, RIF1) [].'
