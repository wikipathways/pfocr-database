caption: A hypothetical diagram of possible sites of action of non-opioids in the
  regulatory pathway of IL-6. IL-6 binds to IL-6 receptor forming a hexadimer with
  intracellular gp-130 molecule. This activates (phosphorylates) JAK-1 (Janus kinase
  1), which leads to the phosphorylation of gp-130 and subsequently the activation
  of STAT1 and STAT 3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription). The activation
  of this signaling cascade results in the induction of SOCS3 formation that ultimately
  inhibits the signaling transduction of IL-6. PGE2via EP2 and EP4 receptors activates
  adenylyl cyclase leading to the formation of cAMP that activates (protein kinase
  A) PKA and subsequently NFkB (nuclear factor kappa B). NFκB activation results in
  further IL-6 expression and it also interferes with activation of STAT. Non-opioids
  interfere with synthesis of PGE2, the degradation of c-AMP and also regulates SOCS
  3and NFκB. It should be noted that non-opioids have different effects on these targets
  in different cells and under different experimental conditions.
