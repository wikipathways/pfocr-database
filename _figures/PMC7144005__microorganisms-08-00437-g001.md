caption: Modes of electron transfer to pMMO in iMsOB3b model developed in this study.
  The dotted lines represent possible electron flow in 3 different modes of electron
  transfer. The green dotted lines refer to electron flow in redox-arm mode. The blue
  dotted lines refer to electron flow in uphill electron transfer mode. The red dotted
  lines represent electron flow during direct coupling mode. pMMO refers to particulate
  methane monooxygenase, q refers to ubiquinone, cytC refers to cytochrome C, NADH11
  refers to ubiquinone oxidoreductase, UQCYOR_2p refers to ubiquinol-cytochrome-c
  reductase, CYO_2p refers to cytochrome C oxidase, H4MTP refers to tetrahydromethanopterin
  pathway.
