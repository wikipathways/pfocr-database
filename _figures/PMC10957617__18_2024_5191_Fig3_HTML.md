caption: 'The Versatile Mechanisms of STING. ①cGAS-STING signaling pathway. The cGAS
  recognizes endogenous viral reverse-transcribed DNA or its DNA (from mitochondria
  or tumor cells). cGAS recognizes the DNA and then synthesizes the second messenger,
  2′3''-cGAMP, which activates STING. The translocation of STING from the endoplasmic
  reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is a prerequisite for its involvement in downstream
  signaling and the regulation of IFN-I transcription. Activated STING recruits and
  activates TBK1, which phosphorylates IRF3. Subsequently, phosphorylated IRF3 forms
  a dimer and translocate to the nucleus, where it initiates the expression of immunomodulatory
  factors such as IFN-I. ② STING and cellular autophagy. DNA from pathogens or damaged
  cells activates cGAS to synthesize cGAMP. cGAMP binds to STING and triggers the
  translocation of STING from the ER to the ERGIC and the Golgi apparatus, a process
  that is dependent on SAR1, SEC24C. The ERGIC, which contains STING, serves as a
  membrane source for LC3 recruit and lipolysis through a WIPI2-dependent mechanism.
  The LC3-positive membranes target DNA and pathogens to autophagosomes, which subsequently
  fuse with lysosomes. Accumulation of STING in lysosomes leads to lysosomal membrane
  permeabilization, which in turn leads to lysosome-dependent cell death. ③: STING

  in T cells, which induces ER stress, leading to cell death. ④: STING and cellular
  metabolism. STING binds to hexokinase 2 (HK2), the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis,
