caption: Sulfation of 25HC as an epigenetic regulatory pathway. 25HC is an endogenous
  agonist of DNMT-1 that methylates CpG in promoter regions and subsequently silences
  gene expression, resulting in cell death and lipogenesis. 25HC can be sulfated to
  25HC3S, which acts as an endogenous ligand and inhibits activities of DNMTs. 25HC3S
  demethylates 5mCpG in promoter regions and successively increases gene expression.
  The eminent pathways regulated by the sulfation of oxysterol are involved in energy
  and lipid metabolisms, MAPK-ERK, and calcium-AMPK. 25HC3S significantly increases
  DUSPs and CREB expressions, which activate MAPK-ERK pathway, including CREB, BAD,
  and ERK, and subsequently regulate cell survival and death. 25HC3S decreases lipid
  biosynthesis and reduces lipid accumulation by demethylating 5mCpG in promoter regions,
  increasing expression of key genes involved in calcium channels and AMPK, and activating
  corresponding signaling pathways, which result in increased oxidation of FFA, and
  decreased biosynthesis of cholesterol and FFA. The global regulation by sulfation
  of oxysterol suggests the physiological and pathophysiological significance of this
  regulatory mechanism.
