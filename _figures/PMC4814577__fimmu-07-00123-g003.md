caption: The cAMP pathway in Treg and its regulation by IFN-α. Signaling via the T
  cell receptor (TCR) leads to an activation of adenylate cyclases, resulting in high
  cAMP levels in regulatory T cells (Treg). cAMP can be transferred via gap junctions
  into conventional T cells (Tcon), thereby mediating the suppressive activity of
  Treg (A). Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), which can be activated by MAP kinase ERK-related
  pathways, reduces cAMP amounts in Treg by enzymatic cleavage, impairing the regulatory
  activity of Treg (B). IFN-α abolishes the suppressive function of Treg by cAMP reduction,
  restoring the Tcon activation. Inhibition of the ERK or PDE4 pathway, respectively,
  results in a renewed suppressive capacity of IFN-α treated Treg (C).
