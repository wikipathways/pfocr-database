caption: The kynurenine pathway. Breakdown of the kynurenine pathway in the brain
  as related to neurodegeneration. The four primary metabolites in the kynurenine
  pathway that readily cross the BBB are tryptophan, L-kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine,
  and anthranilic acid. The metabolism of kynurenine metabolites in the brain occurs
  in two separate cells, microglial cells and astrocytes. In microglial cells, kynurenine
  is converted to 3-hydroxykynurenine, which causes oxidative damage and serves as
  the entry point of QA. QA is excitotoxic and neurotoxic. It acts as an agonist to
  the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and causes oxidative stress in the central nervous
  system. In astrocytes, L-kynurenine is converted to KA, an antagonist to the N-methyl-D-aspartate
  and alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. It also acts as a neuroprotective
  agent by blocking QA-induced neurodegeneration.
