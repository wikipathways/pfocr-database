caption: Network representation of the signaling pathway with CatSper channel as the
  only source of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration. Notice the absence of the LVA
  and HVA channels previously depicted in Fig. . Also note the new direct link between
  pH, voltage and Ca 2+ node with the CatSper channel, highlighted with bold arrows.
  This network constitutes Model-III.
papertitle: Network model predicts that CatSper is the main Ca2+ channel in the regulation
  of sea urchin sperm motility.
