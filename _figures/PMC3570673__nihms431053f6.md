caption: SIRT1 in the brain is involved in a number of processes that affect neuronal
  health, neurogenesis, and behavior. (a) SIRT1 can deacetylate retinoic acid receptor
  β (RARβ), which causes the heterodimerization of RARβ with retinoid X receptor (RXR)
  on the promoter of ADAM10, which encodes α-secretase. Increases in the abundance
  and activity of ADAM10 direct amyloid precursor peptide (APP) processing toward
  the α-secretase pathway. This in turn leads to less β-secretase cleavage of APP
  and thus less Aβ production, which is protective against Alzheimer’s disease. (b)
  SIRT1 deacetylates and activates TORC1 by promoting its dephosphorylation and its
  interaction with CREB. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and PGC-1α are key
  targets of SIRT1 and TORC1 transcriptional activity. Both targets counteract the
  toxic effects of the Huntingtin protein and protect against Huntington’s disease.
  (c) SIRT1 limits miR-134 expression via a repressor complex containing the transcription
  factor YY1. If SIRT1 is downregulated and miR-134 expression is increased, CREB
  and BDNF are downregulated, thereby impairing synaptic plasticity. (d) SIRT1 deacetylates
  and thus activates the neuronal helix-loop-helix 2 (NHLH2) transcription factor,
  which in conjunction with SP1 controls the transcription of monoamine oxidase A
  (MAOA). MAOA activity alters the abundance of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin
  and noradrenaline, which in turn influence an animal’s mood and behavior. (e) SIRT1
  knockout results in decreased extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)
  phosphorylation and in altered expression of hippocampal genes involved in synaptic
  function. SIRT1 knockout animals have compromised cognitive functions, reinforcing
  the notion that SIRT1 is indispensable for normal learning, memory, and synaptic
  plasticity. (f) SIRT1 binds the CLOCK-BMAL1 complex in a circadian manner and promotes
  the deacetylation and degradation of cytochrome PER2. The PER2/CRY complex suppresses
  the activity of CLOCK/BMAL1, forming a negative feedback loop that results in periodic
  oscillation of the abundance of these molecules. SIRT1 is required for normal circadian
  transcription of core clock genes in the liver and connects cellular metabolism
  to the circadian rhythm. (g) SIRT1 protects against Parkinson’s disease by deacetylating
  heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) to increase activation of its targets, such as heat shock
  protein 70 (HSP70). Interestingly, the induction of HSF1 activity requires the overexpression
  of both SIRT1 and the A53T disease gene.
