caption: Hpo/MST is activated by Tao-1/TAOK-mediated phosphorylation or trans-autophosphorylation
  of its activation loop site (blue circles). Sav/SAV1 forms a heterotetramer with
  Hpo/MST to facilitate Hpo/MST activation and localization to the plasma membrane.
  Activated Hpo/MST then phosphorylates multiple sites (yellow circles) in its linker
  region. Binding of these phosphorylation sites by Mats/MOB1 helps recruit Wts/LATS
  to Hpo/MST. Hpo/MST then phosphorylates the HM of Wts/LATS to promote Wts/LATS autophosphorylation
  and activation. MAP4Ks function redundantly with Hpo/MST to phosphorylate the HM
  of Wts/LATS leading to its activation. Conversely, the linker phosphorylation sites
  of Hpo/MST recruit the STRIPAK PP2A phosphatase complex to dephosphorylate and inactivate
  Hpo/MST, therefore creating a negative feedback to restrict Hpo/MST activity. Upstream
  regulators such as KIBRA and Mer/NF2 facilitate the kinase cascade by recruiting
  Wts/LATS to the plasma membrane for its activation by Hpo/MST.
