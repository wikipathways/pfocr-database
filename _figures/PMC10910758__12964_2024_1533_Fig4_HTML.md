caption: 'Schematic of NF-κB signalling during chondrogenesis in endochondral ossification.
  A General scheme of chondrogenesis and related molecules and signalling pathways.
  I. Condensation: MSC condenses into proliferating chondrocytes. TGF-β and BMP signalling
  regulate this stage, with BMP positively modulating NF-κB signalling. II. Proliferation
  and Differentiation: Proliferating chondrocytes transition to prehypertrophic chondrocytes.
  BMP and IGF-1/GH positively regulate NF-κB signalling, while RSPO2 counteracts it,
  with reduced expression during this stage. III. Terminal Differentiation: Prehypertrophic
  chondrocytes mature into hypertrophic chondrocytes. BMP and Wnt signalling positively
  regulate NF-κB signalling, while RSPO2 antagonizes it. Sox9 expression is regulated
  by NF-κB and is present in proliferating chondrocytes but suppresses their differentiation
  into prehypertrophic chondrocytes and is absent in the final maturation stage. B
  Detailed molecular mechanism of NF-κB regulation during chondrogenesis. Inflammatory
  macrophage-derived IL-1β and growth factors (IGF-1, GH, BMP2) activate PI3K/AKT
  signalling. PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol - 4,5 - bisphosphate (PIP2) into
  phosphatidylinositol [3–5]-trisphosphate (PIP3), activating AKT via mTORC2 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
  1 (PDK1). mTORC1 signalling may also stimulate NF-κB-65. Active P50/P65 translocates
  to the nucleus, inducing Sox9 promoter activity, chondrogenic gene expression, and
  B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL) expression for chondrocyte survival, proliferation,
  and differentiation. Mechanical overload stimulates Rac1, activating NF-κB signalling
  to promote RSPO2 expression, which inhibits chondrogenesis (Created with BioRender.com)'
