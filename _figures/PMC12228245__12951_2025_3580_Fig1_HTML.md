caption: Schematic summarizing the preparation of Ga-TA MPN-modified fish swim bladder
  (GaPP@FSB) for enhancing tendon–bone healing. This patch-like scaffold is designed
  for the repair of RCTs, with one end anchored to the tendon stump and the other
  end secured to the humeral head, thereby facilitating tendon-bone healing. Specifically,
  TA can crosslink and toughen FSB while chelating gallium ions, forming Ga-TA MPNs
  on the FSB. Ga-TA MPNs are capable of responding to acidic and ROS microenvironments
  by releasing Ga ions, which in turn promotes the regeneration of the transitional
  tissue at the tendon-bone interface. GaPP@FSB also emulates the ECM, thereby activating
  the α5β1/Akt/PI3K pathway to induce tenogenic differentiation. Additionally, GaPP@FSB
  exhibits remarkable anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and antibacterial activities
