caption: 'Canonical signaling pathway of TREM2–DAP12 cascade and its functional role.
  Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of ITAM in DAP 12 leads to the activation of
  SYK which results to phosphorylation of endogenous signaling proteins: ERK 1/2,
  Cb1, and PLCγ1. These proteins translocate to nucleus and initiates the expression
  of multiple transcription factors which had implications in cell survival, differentiation,
  and proliferation.'
