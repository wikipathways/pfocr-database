caption: The role of CysLTs in lung injury. By activating different receptors, cysLTs
  play diverse roles in the lungs. 1. The activation of CysLT1R can trigger degranulation
  of eosinophils, releasing granule contents including eosinophil cationic protein
  (ECP), major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), and eosinophil-derived
  neurotoxin, among others. These released granule contents can damage tissue cells,
  activate immune cells such as neutrophils and mast cells, and enhance the Th2 immune
  response. Eosinophils can also release various cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and
  IL-13, which can affect the differentiation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells. Furthermore,
  ILC2s activated by CysLTs can rapidly secrete multiple type 2 cytokines, which are
  key mediators of type 2 immune responses and can further recruit and activate more
  immune cells, such as Th2 cells, thereby amplifying the inflammatory response. Alveolar
  macrophages, upon activation by CysLT1R, release inflammatory factors such as tumor
  necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8
  (IL-8), exacerbating lung inflammation, while the upregulation of the P2Y6 signaling
  pathway can alleviate inflammation by inhibiting CysLT1R. 2. The activation of CysLT2R
  primarily manifests in the induction of HMGB1 expression on the surface of platelets,
  a change that can promote their firm adhesion to eosinophils, facilitate degranulation,
  and participate in the initiation of inflammation. 3. Research on CysLT3R is still
  in its infancy, and its activation mainly synergizes with IL-25-dependent signaling
  pathways to induce the expansion of tuft cells in the airways, leading to the occurrence
  of type 2 lung inflammation. (figure was created by Figdraw)
