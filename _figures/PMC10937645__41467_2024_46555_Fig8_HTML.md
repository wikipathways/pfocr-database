caption: Bacteriophage DNA is proposed to be recognized by two systems, cGAS-STING
  and TLR9/MyD88. While the latter system works efficiently, leading to activation
  of IRF7 and NF-κB transcription factor, and subsequent production of INFβ, the cGAS-STING-dependent
  pathway is blocked at the stage of IRF-3 phosphorylation. This impairment of IRF3
  phosphorylation results from a lack of stimulation of this process by TBK1 and IKKε
  (in cooperation with TANK, TBKBP1, and NAP1) due to ineffective RLRs-MAVS activation
  in response to a lack of RNA polymerase III-catalyzed transcription of bacteriophage
  DNA and impaired production of dsRNA, because of the absence of specific AT-rich
  sequences and/or eukaryotic-like promoters in phage genomes. The scheme was created
  using BioRender.com (publication license no. BQ26HQ0INZ)
