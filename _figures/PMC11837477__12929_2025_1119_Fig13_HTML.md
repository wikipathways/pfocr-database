caption: 'The EGFR roles in lung fibrosis. A–C EGFR role in lung injury: A Lung injury
  induces an upregulation of EGFR ligands such as EGF and AREG, that promote EGFR
  activation signalling leading to airway remodelling. Specifically, EGF-EGFR binding
  increases squamous metaplasia of basal cells and alters barrier integrity, due to
  suppression of tight junction. Moreover, EGF promotes EGFR degradation. AREG-EGFR
  binding induces hyperplasia of basal cells and mucous cell hyperplasia and stimulates
  expression of genes related to mucous differentiation. Furthermore, AREG leads to
  EGFR prolonged signal pathways due to EGFR recycling process on the plasma membrane.
  B Oxidative stress activates EGFR-PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, such as FOXO3A, that
  inhibits NF-κB, leading to the expression of several cytokines that favors lung
  inflammation. Moreover, AKT activation regulates cell survival. Altogether these
  events contribute to lung fibrosis development. C Oxidative stress induces the formation
  of IL-33-RACE-EGFR complex that favors the mucin secretion and globet cell differentiation
  in lung epithelium. D, E EGFR activation: D EGFR transactivation by TNF-α induces
  activation of caspase8/3-mediated apoptosis, leading to cell death. However, AREG-EGFR
  binding triggers EGFR phosphorylation, activating AKT signaling that inhibits apoptosis
  processes. E TGF-β increases the expression of AREG on lung fibroblasts via ADAM17,
  which promotes the ligand release. AREG-EGFR binding induces ERK, JNK and AP‐1 expression,
  promoting the expression of profibrotic and mesenchymal genes, such as α-smooth
  muscle actin, collagen 1-α1/α2, fibronectin and tenascin, involved in the ECM remodeling
  and in the EMT process'
