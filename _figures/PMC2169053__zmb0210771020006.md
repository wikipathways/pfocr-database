caption: Model for SCF-mediated regulation of hFBH1 and Srs2 turnover in response
  to DNA damage. The F-box domain of hFBH1 forms an SCF ubiquitin ligase that controls
  hFBH1 DNA damage-induced turnover. In budding yeast under unperturbed conditions,
  Srs2 is recruited by sumoylated PCNA, and in response to DNA damage, the conserved
  Rad6/Rad18/Rad5/Ubc13 PRR pathway triggers K63 ubiquitylation of PCNA. PCNA ubiquitylation
  stimulates the recruitment of a putative SCF complex that, as in the case of the
  hFBH1 F-box domain, enhances Srs2 turnover. In addition to its role in monoubiquitylating
  PCNA, Rad6, by promoting the modification of another unknown target(s), aids hFBH1
  and Srs2 recombination functions. Increased hFBH1 and Srs2 turnover might lead to
  the stimulation of recombinational repair of DNA lesions.
