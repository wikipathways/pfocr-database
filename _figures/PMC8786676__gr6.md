caption: 'Interaction network of top candidates, cell processes, and radiation(A)
  Protein network of the top candidates identified in this study, enriched cell processes,
  and the term “Radiation” as treatment was obtained using Pathway Studio software.
  The top 13 candidates include the top 6 entities for early dysfunction (has-miR-10b-5hashsa-miR-5582-3p,
  has1, hsa-miR-181c-5p, RTN4, and SELP), the top 4 entities for late dysfunction
  (fumarate, adenosine monophosphate, hsa-miR-181a, and CD44), and the top 2 entities
  for intermediate patterns (TAGLN2 and SERPINE1). CDKN2A, target of miR10B, is also
  included in the list of top candidates.(B and C) Same network where candidate entities
  are identified according to their level of expression compared with nonirradiated
  cells (red: increased expression, blue: decreased expression) in the early (0.5–7 days)
  (B) and late (14–21 days) (C) time points following irradiation.'
