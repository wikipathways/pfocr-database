caption: Proposed biosynthesis of MAAs via the shikimate pathway. The broken line
  represents the putative biosynthetic route of MAA synthesis, while 4-deoxygadusol
  (4-DG) acts as a direct MAA precursor (modified from references  and the  with permission

  symbiotic dinoflagellates (), while more MAA products (indicated by white stars)
  have been found in reef-building corals such as Stylophora pistillata (). PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate; EPSP, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate;
