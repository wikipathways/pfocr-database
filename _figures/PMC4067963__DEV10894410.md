caption: Model of Sox9, Sox10 and FGF function during lacrimal gland branching morphogenesis.
  (A) Sox9 controls the initial budding and the elongation of the lacrimal bud; Sox10
  is activated by Sox9 and continues the elongation and branching of the lacrimal
  bud and controls the formation of secretory acini. (B) Fgf10 regulates the expression
  of Sox9 and Sox10. In turn, Sox9 regulates the expression of heparan sulfate-synthesizing
  enzymes (HSSE), which are required for the synthesis and function of heparan sulfate
  (HS), to promote FGF signaling. Sox9 and FGF signaling regulate ECM components,
  which may contribute to the formation and elongation of the lacrimal bud. Identifying
  the Sox10-specific pathways in the lacrimal buds will require further exploration.
