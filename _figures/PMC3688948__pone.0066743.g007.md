caption: In gastric smooth muscle PAR2 receptors are coupled to Gq, G13 and Gi1/2,
  and stimulation of PI hydrolysis via Gaq and Gbgi1/2, and RhoA/Rho kinase via Ga13.
  Initial contraction is mediated via PLC-b/Ca2+/MLCK pathway whereas sustained contraction
  is mediated via RhoA/Rho kinase pathway. Although PAR2 receptors are coupled to
  inhibition of cAMP via Ga i1/2, activation of NF-kB pathway via Ga13/RhoA leads
  to degradation of IkB and activation of PKA that result in attenuation of Rho kinase
  activity in a feedback mechanism via phosphorylation of RhoA at Ser188 by PKA.
