caption: 'On the left-hand side are listed the potential benefits (i.e. glycogen synthesis,
  ammonia detoxification and improved energy balance), and on the right-hand side
  are given the potential risks of GKA (lactic acidosis, lipogenesis and the possibility
  of triglyceride accumulation in the liver). +, stimulation and/or increased generation;
  −, inhibition and/or decreased generation. The present findings demonstrate that
  the stimulation of glycolysis by GKA resulted in numerous changes in normal hepatic
  metabolism, including: (i) enhanced direct pathway of glycogen synthesis, but decreased
  gluconeogenesis; (ii) augmented anaplerosis and, associated with this, increased
  flux through the TCA cycle and generation of glutamate, aspartate or citrate (cataplerosis);
  (iii) the increased flux through the TCA may enhance the generation of NADH and
  thus ATP synthesis, resulting in an improved hepatic phosphorylation potential and
  energetic state; (iv) stimulated synthesis of NAG, and enhanced detoxification of
  NH3 through ureagenesis; (v) increased generation and output of lactate, which could
  lead to lactic acidosis; and (vi) increased levels of citrate may augment hepatic
  lipogenesis and thus accumulation of triglycerides. OXA, oxaloacetate.'
