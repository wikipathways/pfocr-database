caption: Working model that describes the relationship between sphinganine metabolism,
  polarized membrane traffic from SAC, and apical PM biogenesis in response to cAMP/PKA
  signaling in HepG2 cells. First, cAMP/PKA signaling reorganizes polarized membrane
  traffic from the SAC, which includes the rerouting of a fluorescent lipid probe
  from a basolateral direction into the transcytotic pathway, leading to the apical
  surface. Activation of this pathway is crucial for cAMP/PKA-stimulated polarity
  development. cAMP/PKA signaling also increases the activity of dihydroceramide synthase,
  thereby stimulating the turnover of sphinganine. The inability to turn over sphinganine
  and the consequent accumulation of free sphinganine inhibits cAMP/PKA-induced activation
  of the apical PM directed traffic route from SAC and, hence, polarity development.
