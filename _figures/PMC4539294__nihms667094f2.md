caption: Schematic of the itch spinal cord circuit.The initial stages of the itch-circuit
  in the spinal cord are characterized by the expression of neuropeptides and the
  post-synaptic expression of their cognate receptors. Initially Nppb is released
  from primary puriceptive neurons (black arrow) and activates Npr1-expressing spinal
  cord neurons. In turn, Npr1-neurons release GRP which activates tertiary GRPR-expressing
  cells. The GRPR-neurons then directly or indirectly, (broken white arrow) activate
  projection neurons which send projections to higher brain centers. Inhibitory Bhlhb5-interneurons
  (green) express Sst2a receptors and can be hyperpolarized by somatostatin. The Bhlhb5-cells
  are thought to release the kappa-opioid dynorphin in response to activation by primary
  afferent DRG stimulation. Dynorphin causes inhibition of the excitatory (red) itch
  pathway.
