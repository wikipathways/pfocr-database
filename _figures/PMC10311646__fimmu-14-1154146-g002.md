caption: Lysosomal peptidases mediate immune evading primarily by regulating TAMs,
  MDSCs, and cytokines (e.g.TNF-α,VEGF,IL-6,IL-10 etc.). Lysosomal peptidases stimulates
  TAMs through gamma-enolase and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to activate autophagy
  and regulate glycolysis and lipid metabolism, stimulates immune cells to produce
  cytokines such as TNF-α, VEGF,IL-6 and IL-10. On the one hand, these cytokines act
  on TAMs and MDSCs and regulate their function; on the other hand, they activate
  the signaling pathways TNF-α/p38MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR. lysosomal peptidasesto stimulate
  the production of IL1-β by MDSCs and inhibit the function of cathepsin L and NK
  cells. The inflammasome also has this effect. The above three pathways jointly promote
  the proliferation of glioma cells, the formation of tumor neovascularization and
  the degradation of extracellular matrix. Eventually, glioma invasion and metastasis
  occur and immune escape occurs. This figure has been created with https://app.biorender.com
