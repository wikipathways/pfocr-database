caption: Pathway of 2,4,5-T degradation. The tftA and tftB genes encode two subunits
  of the 2,4,5-T oxygenase responsible for the conversion of 2,4,5-T to 2,4,5-TCP
  (, ). A two-component flavin-containing monooxygenase encoded by the tftC and tftD
  genes () catalyzes the para-hydroxylation of 2,4,5-TCP to yield 2,5-DCHQ (, ). A
  second hydroxylation step by the same enzyme converts 2,5-DCHQ to 5-CHQ (). The
  tftG gene product catalyzes dechlorination of 5-CHQ to yield HQox (this work). An
  HBQ reductase reduces HQox to HQ before HQDO, encoded by the tftH gene, can catalyze
  ring cleavage to yield MA (this work and reference ). Maleylacetate reductase, encoded
  by the tftE gene, catalyzes the reduction of MA to 3-oxoadipate (), which ultimately
  is converted to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates.
