caption: The HH signalling pathway. HH ligands bind to the membrane-associated protein
  PTCH1 and inhibit its function. PTCH1 inhibits SMO by preventing it from translocating
  to the primary cilium. SMO inhibits SUFU which, in turn, inhibits the activation
  and translocation of GLI1 and GLI2 to the nucleus. SUFU also activates GLI3, which
  is processed by proteolytic cleavage to become a transcriptional repressor. GLI1
  and GLI2 activate transcription of several target genes, including themselves and
  PTCH1. The loss of PTCH leads to constitutive activation of the pathway. Small molecule
  inhibitors bind and inhibit SMO.
