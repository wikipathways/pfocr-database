caption: In macrophages, interferon (IFN)-β induces several gene products (miR-342-5p,
  cholesterol-25-hydroxylase [Ch25h], viperin, interferon-induced transmembrane protein
  3 [Ifitm3]) that inhibit virus by depleting cholesterol [CHOL] and isoprenoids required
  for viral gene expression in the replication organelle, and/or by reprogramming
  intracellular cholesterol trafficking. miR-342-5p suppresses the mevalonic acid
  synthesis pathway (depicted as multiple steps from acetyl-CoA to CHOL) through repressing
  SREBP2 and pathway enzymes. Ch25h-derived 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) inhibits
  SREBP2 activation, OSBP1-dependent cholesterol delivery to the replication organelle,
  and, along with Ifitm3, also blocks viral fusion/entry. Ch25h can also directly
  inhibit the HCV NS5A protein. Viperin impairs viral budding through altering raft
  lipids. IFNβ-induced depletion of newly synthesized cholesterol in the ER de-represses
  stimulator of IFN genes (STING), inducing IFNβ production. Enteroviruses promote
  clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) of cholesterol to the replication organelle,
  a pathway that can also be promoted by SREBP2-supported, LDLR-dependent uptake of
  extracellular cholesterol. ER = endoplasmic reticulum; HCV = Hepatitis C Virus;
  Ifnar = IFNα/β receptor; LDLR = low density lipoprotein receptor; OSBP = oxysterol
  binding protein; SREBP = sterol response element binding protein; VAPA = vesicle-associated
  membrane protein-associated protein A.
