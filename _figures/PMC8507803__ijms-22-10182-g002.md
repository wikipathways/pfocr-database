caption: Biosynthesis and metabolism of HDL. The biosynthesis of HDL starts with the
  synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein (Apo) A-1 as a lipid-free protein from
  hepatocytes. Through the efflux mediated by the transporter ATP-binding cassette
  transporter (ABC)-A1, ApoA1 obtains phospholipids (PL) and unesterified cholesterol
  (UC) from cells to form a disc-shaped nascent HDL particle. These particles take
  up additional PL and UC through ABCA1-mediated efflux. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase
  (LCAT) converts UC into the more hydrophobic cholesteryl ester (CE), which is taken
  to the center of the HDL, shaping HDL into a spherical particle. Spherical HDL serves
  as an acceptor for UC efflux mediated by ABCG1 and SR-B1. Cholesteryl ester transfer
  protein (CETP) mediates the exchange of cholesteryl esters in HDL with triglycerides
  in ApoB-containing lipoproteins, reducing the HDL cholesterol levels. HDL cholesterol
  (UC and CE) is directly cleared in the liver via SR-B1, which mediates a process
  called selective lipid uptake in which the lipid moiety of HDL is taken up by cells
  and the lipid-depleted particle returns to the circulation. Cholesterol taken up
  in the liver can either be recycled into newly assembled ApoB-containing lipoproteins
  or can undergo net excretion into the bile. A similar SR-B1-mediated pathway of
  selective lipid uptake from HDL occurs in steroidogenic cells of the adrenal gland,
  testes, and ovary to support steroid hormone biosynthesis.Black dotted arrows represent
  the movement or conversion of cholesterol. Solid black arrows represent the movement
  or conversion of HDL particles.
