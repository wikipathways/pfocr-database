caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to predict the effect of chemical drugs on level
  of Jab1/COPS5. In this case we showed the predicted expression level of genes in
  the regulation network in response to increased level of doxorubicin, cisplatin,
  or curcumin based on the IPA database. The color of each gene represents the corresponding
  expression level. Light-red means activation and light-blue means inhibition, while
  red means increased measurement and green means decreased measurement.
