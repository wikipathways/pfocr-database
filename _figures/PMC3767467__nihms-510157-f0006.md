caption: A proposed model of TRP47 effector function in E. chaffeensis infection of
  the macrophage based on defined molecular interactions study and previous reports
  (,,,,). Binding of E. chaffeensis to its receptor directly or indirectly activates
  FYN. Activated FYN tyrosine kinase phosphorylates and activates PLC-γ, which hydrolyzes
  membrane phospholipid PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol biphosphate), resulting in increased
  level of IP3 (inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate) and release of Ca2+ from intracellular
  stores, and Ca2+ influx. FYN may regulate the function of IP3 receptor by phosphorylation
  and promoting release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. FYN also phosphorylates
  caveolin-1 involved in ehrlichial entry. TRP47-PTPN2 interaction modulates cytokine
  signaling events by exerting negative feedback on the Jak/Stat pathway by dephosphorylation
  of Jaks and Stats involved in intravacuolar maintenance and survival of E. chaffeensis.
  TRP47-PCGF5 interaction modulates gene transcription associated with cell signaling
  and remodeling of cytoskeleton facilitating and supporting intracellular survival
  of E. chaffeensis. CAP1 promotes rapid actin dynamics in conjunction with ADF/cofilin
  and is required for cell morphology, migration, and endocytosis. Mitochondrial shuttling
  of CAP1 promotes actin- and coflin-dependent apoptosis, which may play important
  role in release of DC ehrlichiae from the monocyte (Reproduced with permission from
