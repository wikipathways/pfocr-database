caption: Simplified schematic of endocrine factors involved in epithelial ovarian
  cancer progression. GnRH secreted from the hypothalamus stimulates release of FSH
  from the anterior pituitary. FSH binds to the FSH receptor to activate the PI3K/Akt
  pathway, stimulating the expression of survivin (). Survivin activates HIF-1α, resulting
  in secretion of VEGF, which inhibits apoptosis, stimulates proliferation and induces
  angiogenesis in various carcinomas (). FSH-induced survivin upregulation is also
  associated with inhibition of death receptor DR5 and de-activation of an intracellular
  death-induced silencing complex (). GnRH binding to the GnRH-I receptor activates
  intracellular NFkB, which inhibits ovarian cancer cell apoptosis (, ). Estrogen
  has direct effects by inducing activation of the proliferative, survival and angiogenic
  MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (, ). Estrogen also has an indirect pro-tumor effect
  by stimulating subsequent release of GnRH and FSH (, ).
