caption: 'Working model: Raw regulates the ability of injured axons and dendrites
  to degenerate by restraining a JNK-dependent transcriptional program. Signaling
  downstream of the Wallenda/DLK kinase after axonal injury and in other conditions
  of stress () regulates multiple JNK-dependent responses. These include promotion
  of axonal degeneration, which may occur locally in injured axons independently of
  the nucleus (; ), and downstream events that involve transcription factors including
  Fos and Jun: regenerative axon sprouting (; ), global upregulation of microtubule
  dynamics (; ), and protection of neurites from degeneration (, ; ). Our data suggest
  that Raw regulates protective signaling without influencing sprouting or increasing
  microtubule dynamics. Because the nuclear localization of Jun(Jra) is altered (increased)
  in raw mutants (), we propose that this specificity might occur via the regulation
  of different transcription factor complexes. Raw may therefore provide a new inroad
  to functionally separate pathways that share dependence upon the JNK MAP kinase.'
