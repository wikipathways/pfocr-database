caption: '(A) Crystal structure of REV7 in complex with SHLD2 and SHLD3 fragments
  (PDB ID: 6KTO). REV7 forms a head-to-head homodimer in the context of the Shieldin
  complex. Only one molecule of REV7 forms a canonical closed-seatbelt interaction
  with the seatbelt binding motif in the N-terminus of SHLD3. “?-REV7” indicates a
  novel form of REV7 identified by Liang et al. The functional significance of which
  is not fully understood. (B) When REV7 is active, the full Shieldin complex can
  be assembled. REV7 mediates the recruitment of SHLD2-SHLD1 via SHLD3, inhibiting
  resection and subsequently recruiting CST-Polα for fill-in synthesis. (C) Inactive
  REV7 fails to bind to SHLD3, leading to an inability to recruit downstream Shieldin
  factors. In the absence of Shieldin, resection can occur at high levels and HR is
  expected to predominate.'
