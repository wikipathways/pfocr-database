caption: Mechanistic illustrations. The increasing formation of ROS in DM can directly
  cause damage to spermatogenesis via attacking the fluidity of the plasma membrane
  lipids, protein modifications, and integrity of DNA. And ROS also can induce autophagy
  by inhibiting mTOR through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Autophagy accelerates
  the degradation of p62, and then, the Nrf2 activation is suppressed and the oxidative
  damage is aggravated. Autophagy also directly causes damage to spermatogenesis via
  reducing serum testosterone levels, suppressing SC proliferation, and damaging BTB.
  Moreover, mTOR has distinct effects on spermatogenesis via promoting spermatogonia
  proliferation, maintaining somatic cell function, and restructuring BTB. As a result,
  the oxidative damage in diabetic testes is further enhanced, thereby promoting the
  occurrence of infertility.
