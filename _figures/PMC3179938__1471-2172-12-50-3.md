caption: 'Top IPA generated network. The figure illustrates the graphical representation
  of the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Each node contains comprehensive information
  on a gene''s function, how that gene is regulated, its direct neighbours, and synonyms,
  Genes are represented as nodes and the biological relationship between two nodes
  is represented as an edge: dashed lines if relationship is indirect and continuous
  lines are for direct relationships. Nodes are displayed using various shapes that
  represent the functional class of the gene product (legend in the top left). The
  output of the IPA query is exploited for Biological Annotation from the IPA Knowledge
  Database. The top network found by IPA concerns cellular growth and proliferation
  and the humoral immune response. Six (grey nodes) among the ten input genes show
  more than one interaction (also indirect) in the network built by IPA.'
