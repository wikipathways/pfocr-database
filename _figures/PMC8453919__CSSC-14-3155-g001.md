caption: 'Four PCET steps between the catalytic intermediates from S12+ to S02+ for
  the supramolecular dye‐WOC‐dye complex. It is assumed that two light flashes induce
  the co‐photooxidation of the two NDI dyes in the two‐channel model (Si2+→Si4+, i=0–4:
  NDI1→NDI1+. and NDI2→NDI2+.). The vertical and horizontal double arrows correspond
  to the pathways of a sequential PCET mechanism, either ET from the WOC to the oxidized
  dye first (Si4+→Si4+′ and Si3+→Si3+′) or PT to the solvent first (Si4+→Si3+ and
  Si3+→Si2+). The diagonal double arrow denotes the concerted PCET mechanism. The
  favorable pathway of the second half of the catalytic cycle in the two‐channel model
  is indicated in blue. The stable intermediates investigated in the present study
  are shown in black. The ligand exchange S02++H2O→S12++3O2 is also indicated in grey.
  H+ represents the proton transferred to the solvent. The catalytic steps from S34+
  to S02+, which are the main focus of this work, are specifically described in the
  top panel.'
