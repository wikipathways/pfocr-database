caption: Schematic illustration of inflammation signaling pathway in AD. Inflammatory
  cascade which was triggered by NBM lesion primarily involved NF-κB which regulates
  cytokines and COX-2 expression. IκBα/P-IκBα ratio, which was regulated by ROS molecules,
  directly amplifies the cascade. EE fruit juice could remarkably attenuate NF-κB
  pathway so, inhibit inflammation and following events
