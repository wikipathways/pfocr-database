caption: Potential sites of action for reactive oxygen species in the regulation of
  the insulin signaling pathway. This simplified scheme shows the major pathways of
  insulin signaling, involving activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase cascade
  leading initially to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and its cellular
  substrate IRS proteins and Shc (). The steady-state level of tyrosine phosphorylation
  of these proteins is regulated by PTPases, a family of enzymes that constitute one
  of the key targets of regulation by reactive oxygen species in the cell. Additional
  thiol-sensitive regulatory proteins that strongly impact on the insulin action cascade
  include PTEN, PP2A, and MKP-1. See text for discussion and additional references.

  kinase C.
