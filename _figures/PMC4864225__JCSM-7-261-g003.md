caption: Hypothesis on skeletal muscle adiponectin resistance in chronic heart failure.
  In chronic heart failure, insulin resistance is associated with decreased levels
  of phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase/Akt/forkhead box protein O1 and a reduced expression
  of the adiponectin receptor AdipoR1. Skeletal muscle metabolic deficiency in chronic
  heart failure is corroborated by a deactivated adenosine monophosphate activated
  protein kinase/sirtuin 1/peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor α pathway and
  down‐regulation of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor ƴ coactivator1 α,
  ultimately progressing to a state of skeletal muscle adiponectin resistance. This
  adiponectin resistance contributes to lipotoxicity, and further worsens insulin
  resistance. All these facets infer a disease process that eventually fulminates
  into skeletal muscle wasting.
