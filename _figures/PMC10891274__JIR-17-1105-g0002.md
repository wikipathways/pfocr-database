caption: The role of YAP/TAZ in fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLS) and its related
  signaling pathway involved in RA. General speaking, the activation of YAP/TAZ could
  regulate the pathological progress of RA via inhibiting the autophagy process or
  promoting apoptosis activity. Furthermore, YAP/TAZ also have an influence on the
  inflammatory response in RA through the TGF-β signaling pathway
