caption: '[Right] The schematic depicts an interconnected signaling network organized
  as collection of modules that define pathway structure. Perturbations of key genes
  result in changes to the transcriptional profile of the cell. Expression signatures
  developed from the pathway module analyses represent activity of units of this structure.[Left]
  To elucidate pathway modules, we decompose a pathway based on common patterns in
  the expression of the genes in the pathway. First, we identify a set of core pathway
  genes and a set of samples with microarray gene expression data evidencing a range
  of variation in activity in the pathway. We next apply the BFRM software to decompose
  the pathway into a series of signatures. As part of the modeling process, BFRM expands
  the pathway genes into a set that more comprehensively describes pathway structure,
  ultimately yielding a collection of estimated signatures. Finally, we link the signatures
  with known modules of the pathway. We reason that if a signature is significantly
  related to activity of a particular module of the pathway, then that signature is
  a representative of that pathway module.'
