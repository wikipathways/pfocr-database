caption: Multiscale evidence for striatal circuitry alterations underlying repetitive
  behaviors. Diseases like (A) Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, OCD, (B) Autism Spectrum
  Disorder, ASD, (C) premanifest Huntington’s Disease, (preHD) and (D) Gilles de la
  Tourette Syndrome, GTS, despite having different etiologies, all share repetitive
  behaviors as a core symptom in affected patients. Changes at the molecular and cellular
  level can lead to dysfunctional structural and functional connectivity across the
  striatal circuitry. (A) In OCD, alterations in the electrophysiological properties
  of dSPNs, iSPNs and astrocytes, can lead to a direct vs. indirect pathway imbalance.
  (B) In ASD, complex alterations at the molecular and cellular level, as well as
  structural and functional connectivity have been associated with the emergence of
  repetitive behaviors. (C) In premanifest HD, loss of matrix and striosomes cellular
  identity, as well as altered connectivity between cortical and striatal regions
  have been reported, at very early stages of the disease. (D) In GTS alterations
  at the cellular and circuit level lead to a scenario where disinhibition of the
  direct pathway could be the underlying cause of uncontrollable tics. dSPN, direct
