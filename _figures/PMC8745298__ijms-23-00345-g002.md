caption: The mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum stress and its potential role in Alzheimer’s
  disease. Under normal physiological conditions, the ER sensors including PERK, ATF6
  and IRE1 are inactivated through the interaction with 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein
  (GRP78); however, the misfolded proteins preferentially bind to GRP78, causing the
  dissociation of GRP78 from PERK, IRE1 and ATF6, eventually resulting in the phosphorylation
  of PERK and IRE-1, and the translocation of ATF6 to the Golgi. The activation of
  these signaling pathways regulates the expression of chaperones and decreases the
  accumulation of abnormal proteins, which can restore endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis.
  In neurons, under chronic ERS, the sustained activation of PERK leads to eIF2α phosphorylation,
  which not only influences the neuronal plasticity through protein synthesis inhibition,
  but also upregulates the expression of BACE1 and ATF4. Meanwhile, the BACE1 can
  be involved in the production of Aβ, and the ATF4 can further trigger cell death
  by upregulating the CHOP. Moreover, the adaptive activation of IRE1α leads to XBP1
  splicing, which directly or indirectly participates in AD pathogenesis. On one hand,
  XBP1 can increase the degradation rate of key AD proteins—APP, BACE1 and p-Tau through
  inducing the E3 ubiquitin–ligase HRD1. On the other hand, the specific XBP1s’ splicing
  by IRE1 can also increase the generation of neurotrophic factor BDNF; however, the
  continuous activation of IRE1α leads to the preferential phosphorylation of TRAF2
  and the inhibition of XBP1s splicing, which can further activate the downstream
  JNK signaling pathway and cause neuronal apoptosis. In addition, ATF6 is localized
  at the ER in physiological conditions and encodes a bZIP transcriptional factor
  in its cytosolic domain. While undergoing sustained ERS, ATF6 can translocate to
  the Golgi apparatus where it is processed by site 1 and 2 proteases releasing its
  cytosolic domain (ATF6f), and further controlling the upregulation of UPR target
  genes. The arrow indicates the activation of process, while the T arrow indicates
  the inhibition of process.
