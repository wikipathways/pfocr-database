caption: Reactions are coded by numbers in circles and described in . Critical reactions
  of the pathway i. e. those which are conducted by key enzymes are shown with numbers
  in white circles wherease others are circled in black. Comparison of the nessesary
  reactions of the pathway with those present in Salinibacter ruber DSM13855, suggests
  that this pathway can be present in Salinibacter’s metabolism. When these reactions
  where included in the reconstructed model, FBA analysis showed that it can carry
  out fluxes under low nutrition conditions.
