caption: Sphingolipid metabolic pathways according to Merrill [], and Maceyka and
  Spiegel []. The de novo synthesis pathway (red) begins with the condensation of
  serine and palmitoyl coenzyme A (CoA) to form ceramide through a series of reactions
  including the conversion of 3-ketosphinganine, sphinganine, and dihydroceramide.
  Ceramide can be modified into sphingomyelin via the sphingomyelinase pathway (blue)
  or into glycosphingolipid, sphingosine, and ceramide-1-phosphate via the salvage
  pathway (green). Double arrows indicate reversible reactions.
