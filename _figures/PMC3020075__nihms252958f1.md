caption: 'The main function of membrane-attached GPC5 is thought to regulate the pathway
  signaling of Wnt, Hedgehogs (Hh), and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Depending
  on the biological context, GPC5 can either stimulate or inhibit cell signaling activity.
  GPC5 may bind to Wnt and to the Frizzled receptor in association with the co-receptors
  LRP5/6. Activation of the Frizzled receptor results in subsequent activation of
  Dishevelled. Through an unknown mechanism, Dishevelled inhibits the function of
  a multi-protein complex including Axin, APC, CK-γ, and GSK-β, which blocks phosphorylation
  of β-catenin and prevents its degradation. Increasing levels of free β-catenin translocate
  to the nucleus, complex with the TCF/LEF cofactors and activate target genes. In
  the case of the Hh pathway, it is proposed that GPC5 may inhibit the signaling by
  competing with Patched (the Hh receptor) for Hh binding. Binding Hh with the Patched
  receptor alters the interaction of Patched with Smoothened, a G protein-coupled
  receptor, resulting in the activation of Smoothened. This initiates a cascade of
  events resulting in the Gli entering the nucleus and acting as transcriptional activators.
  When the Hh signaling is lacking, Gli is bound to a multiprotein complex consisting
  of Fused (Fu) and the suppressor of Fu (SuFu) and will not enter the nucleus. GPC5
  may activate the FGF pathway through unknown mechanisms. Following FGF ligand binding
  and receptor dimerization, the kinase domains transphosphorylate each other, leading
  to the docking of adaptor proteins and the activation of four key downstream pathways:
  RAS–RAF–MAPK, PI3K–AKT, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
  and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). The biological outcomes of FGF/FGFR activation are
  dependent on a complex network of signaling and transcriptional events regulated
  by multiple factors. CK-γ, casein kinase γ; GSK-β, glycogen synthase kinase β; APC,
  adenomatous polyposis coli; TCF, T cell–specific transcription factor; LEF, lymphoid
  enhancer–binding factor; Hh, hedgehog; Fu, fused; SuFu, suppressor of Fu; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol;
