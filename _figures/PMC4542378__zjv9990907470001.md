caption: Signaling networks activated during primary KSHV infection as analyzed by
  Kinex antibody array and IPA. (A to C) Signaling networks activated during primary
  KSHV infection. Serum-starved HUVEC were mock infected or infected with KSHV for
  5, 10, and 15 min. Cell lysates were collected, pooled, and analyzed with a Kinex
  antibody microarray. The antibody array data shown in , as well as kinases or signaling
  molecules that were previously reported to be activated during primary KSHV infection,
  were used as inputs and analyzed by IPA. The top enriched networks and their associated
  pathways were the integrin/MAPK network (A), the insulin/EGFR network (B), and the
  JAK/STAT network (C). Kinases or signaling molecules whose phosphorylation levels
  were increased by KSHV infection are shown in red, while those with a decreased
  phosphorylation status are shown in green, with the color intensities correlating
  with the levels of changes. The kinases or signaling molecules that were previously
  reported to be activated by KSHV infection are shown in gray, while those that were
  not known to be regulated by KSHV during primary infection are shown in white. ECM,
  extracellular matrix.
