caption: 'An Edd knock-out is typically not able to grow on glucose as sole carbon
  source underpinning the dominant role of the Entner Douderoff pathway for sugar
  catabolism in P. aeruginosa. Carbohydrates are on the other hand no major preferred
  nutrients for P. aeruginosa  and knock outs in the central carbohydrate pathways
  do not appear as auxotrophic organisms, albeit they are compromised in their metabolic
  capacity and grow more slowly than the wild type. Consistent with the subordinate
  role of sugars as carbon source, the genes of sugar dissimilation are only weakly
  or moderately expressed (source: transcriptome data of strains PAO1, LES400, LES431
  and TBCF10839 , ). Enzyme abbreviations: Ald, aldolase; Edd, 6-phosphogluconate
  dehydratase; GapA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Glk, glucokinase; GlnK,
  gluconokinase; KdpA, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase; Kgk, 2-ketogluconate
  kinase; Pgi, phosphoglucoisomerase; Zwf, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.'
