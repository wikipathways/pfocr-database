caption: Models of estrogen action. In the “classical” pathway of estrogen action
  (i), estrogen or other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) bind to the
  estrogen receptor (ER), a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates transcription
  of target genes in the nucleus by binding to estrogen response element (ERE) regulatory
  sequences in target genes and recruiting coregulatory proteins (CoRegs) such as
  coactivators. Rapid or “nongenomic” effects of estrogen may also occur through the
  ER located in or adjacent to the plasma membrane (ii), which may require the presence
  of “adaptor” proteins, which target the ER to the membrane. Activation of the membrane
  ER leads to a rapid change in cellular signaling molecules and stimulation of kinase
  activity, which in turn may affect transcription. Lastly, other non-ER membrane-associated
  estrogen-binding proteins (EBPs) may also trigger an intracellular response (iii).
