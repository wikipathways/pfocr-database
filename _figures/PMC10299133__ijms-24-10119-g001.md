caption: 'HGF/MET signaling pathway and most frequent alterations in NSCLC. The binding
  of HGF to MET leads to homodimerization and phosphorylation of the receptor that,
  with a cascade mechanism, activates downstream pathways such as RAS, PI3K/AKT, the
  STAT and NF-κB, involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, cell motility,
  invasion and survival. Furthermore, the stability and degradation of the MET receptor
  are regulated by the intracellular juxtamembrane domain, encoded by exon 14 of the
  gene, containing a tyrosine residue (Y1003). The phosphorylated Tyr1003 works as
  a binding site for the casitas-B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) E3 ubiquitin ligase that
  is able to ubiquitylate MET leading to internalization and degradation of the receptor.
  In NSCLC, point mutations of the MET gene can cause skipping of exon 14 during pre-mRNA
  splicing, leading to the loss of the CBL-binding site and increasing the half-life
  of the MET receptor. Increasing of MET gene copy numbers on chromosome 7 causes
  MET amplification while an upregulation of the MET protein receptor in the transcription
  phase leads to MET overexpression. Both these mechanisms can lead to a global increase
  in MET signaling. Finally, chromosomal translocation is responsible for the creation
  of a fusion gene with a wide variety of partners, such as TPR, KIF5B and HLA-DRB1,
  making the receptor constitutively activated. Abbreviations: AKT, protein kinase
