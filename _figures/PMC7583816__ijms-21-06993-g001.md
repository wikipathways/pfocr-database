caption: 'Diagram of proposed Pi-induced PP2A/Src/DAPK-1/TPM-3 signaling pathway.
  While hyperphosphorylation of TPM-3 (as the supporting link between TMP-3 and the
  cytoskeleton) [] is associated with an enhanced actin stress-fibre formation and
  works as a protective mechanism in maintaining cell membrane integrity, hypophosphorylation
  of TPM-3 may result in loss of actin stress-fibres and be associated with membrane
  blebbing/MV generation from the cells. NB: Pi transporters include Na+-Linked PiT-1
  (slc20a1) and PiT-2 (slc20a2), with the former the main Pi transporters in endothelial
  cells (ECs) (described in detail in the Introduction).'
