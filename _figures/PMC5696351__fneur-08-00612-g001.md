caption: 'Crosstalk between inflammation and thrombosis. C-reactive protein (CRP)
  and proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL-β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α]
  are mediators implicated in the materno-fetal inflammation (–). CRP increases tissue
  factor (TF) activity in vivo (). TNF-α induces the endothelium activation: the production
  of TF and release of von Willebrand factor (vWF)-propeptide (, ). Microparticles
  (MPs), released from platelets, macrophages, and endothelial cells upon activation
  (), trigger coagulation cascades via TF and vWF binding sites (). Activated mononuclear
  cells attract and activate platelets via TF inducible expression (–). Monocyte activation
  leads to TF-dependent thrombin generation and activation of coagulation (, ). Neutrophil
  extracellular traps (NET) regulate both inflammation and coagulation (). Proinflammatory
  cytokines and activated monocyte/macrophages are present within the wall of NAIS-susceptible
  arteries (). Glycosaminoglycan synthesis and anticoagulant activity is decreased
  under inflammation through TF pathway inhibitor and antithrombin interactions with
  their serine proteinases is impaired (, , ). Antithrombin activity is downregulated
  due to its consumption to counteract the mononuclear cells activation and thrombin
  generation (). Thrombomodulin is downregulated upon TNF-α exposure (, ). IL-1β and
  TNF-α contribute to vasoconstriction via the upregulation of endothelin-1 (–). Endothelin-1
  increases superoxide anion production, cytokine release (), and induces prothrombotic
  effect close to the endothelin-1-induced vasospasm. The ductus arteriosus closure
  is triggered by a vasospasm caused by the decreased plasma concentrations in PGE2
  and the increased O2 tension (, ). This mechanism could also happen in NAIS-susceptible
  fetal cerebral arteries. The thrombotic process is associated with the recruitment
  at the coagulation site of innate immune cells, this is the immunothrombosis. Thrombin
  induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by the endothelial
  cells (). Platelets are also involved in the trapping and clearing of bacterial
  agents (, , ). Activated platelets support neutrophils and monocytes recruitment
  (e.g., through CXCL1, CXCL4, CXCL5, CCL3, CCL5, CCL7 expression), adhesion (e.g.,
  platelet P-selectin, CD40 ligand expression), and activation [e.g., receptor expressed
  on myeloid cell (TREM)-1 induced proinflammatory activity] (, , ).'
