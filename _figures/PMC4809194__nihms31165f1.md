caption: Panel A shows the reactions catalyzed by HS biosynthetic enzymes. The reaction
  sites at each modification step are circled. The names and abbreviations for the
  saccharide units are displayed underneath the sugar unit. Panel B shows the steps
  involved in the synthesis of a library of HS-like polysaccharides. The enzymes used
  for each compound are shown in .
