caption: 'Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.
  Major bile acid transporters in human hepatocytes and enterocytes are shown. Enzymes
  and transporters regulated by FXR are indicated. In hepatocytes, bile acids activate
  FXR to inhibit CYP7A1 gene transcription by two pathways: (i) FXR induces small
  heterodimer partner (SHP), which inhibits CYP7A1 by inhibiting nuclear receptors
  liver related homologue-1 (LRH-1) or hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF4), which bind
  to the CYP7A1 promoter. (ii) In enterocytes, FXR induces intestinal hormone fibroblast
  growth factor 19 (FGF19), which is circulated to hepatocytes to activate FGF receptor
  4 (FGFR4) signaling to inhibit CYP7A1 via activation of the extracellular stress-activated
  receptor kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. FXR induces bile salt expert pump (BSEP) to
  efflux bile acids into bile; multidrug resistance protein 2/3 (MDR2/3) to efflux
  phosphatidylcholine (PC) to bile; and MDR related protein 2 (MRP2) to efflux organic
  anions including glucuronidated- and sulfated-bile acids, organic anions, and drugs
  into bile. Bile acids also facilitate efflux of cholesterol to bile by ATP binding
  casette G5/G8(ABCG5/G8). In the bile, bile acids, PC, and cholesterol form mixed
  micelles, which are stored in the gallbladder. In the brush border membrane of the
  ileum, bile acids are reabsorbed by the apical sodium bile salt transporter (ASBT).
  In enterocytes, bile acids activate FXR, which induces ileum bile acid binding protein
  (IBABP) to bind bile salts and may facilitate intracellular transport of bile acids
  to organic solute transporter α/β (OSTα/β) located in the basolateral membrane for
  efflux of bile acids into portal circulation. Bile acids in portal blood are reabsorbed
  into hepatocytes by Na+-dependent taurocholate cotransport peptide (NTCP). FXR inhibits
  NTCP transcription as a feedback inhibition of bile acid uptake to prevent liver
  injury. In the sinusoidal membrane of enterocytes and hepatocytes, FXR also induces
  MRP3/4 to efflux bile acids as an adaptive response to cholestasis. In hepatocytes,
  FXR also induces OSTα/β to efflux bile acids into sinusoidal blood to prevent bile
  acid accumulation in hepatocytes. MRP3 may be induced by FXR as an adaptive response
  to cholestasis. Bile acids returned to hepatic sinusoid are also taken up by Na+-independent
  organic anion transport proteins (OATP2). Many of these membrane transporters (ASBT,
  OSTα/β, and MRP2/3) also are present in cholangiocytes for reabsorption of bile
  acids, and in renal proximal tubule cells for reabsorption of bile acids from blood
  circulation and excretion of hydrophilic bile acids.'
