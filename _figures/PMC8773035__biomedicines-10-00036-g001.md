caption: 'Top network identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for chronic mild
  traumatic brain injury (mTBI) versus control: Connective Tissue Disorders, Inflammatory
  Disease, and Organismal Injury and Abnormalities. Green indicates genes that are
  downregulated, and red indicates genes that are upregulated, where increased color
  saturation represents more extreme down- or upregulated in the dataset. Solid lines
  represent direct interactions, nontargeting interactions, or correlations between
  chemicals, proteins, or RNA. Dotted lines represented indirect interaction. Arrowed
  lines represent activation, causation, expression, localization, membership, modification,
  molecular cleavage, phosphorylation, protein–DNA interactions, protein–TNA interaction,
  binding regulation, and transcription. Shapes represent molecule type (double circle
  = complex/group; square = cytokine; diamond = enzyme; inverted triangle = kinase;
  triangle = phosphatase; oval = transcription regulator; trapezoid = transporter;
  circle = other). Reprinted from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis under a CC BY 4.0 license,
