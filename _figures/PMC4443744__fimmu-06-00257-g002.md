caption: Role of complement in physiology. (A) Protection of host cells against complement.
  Complement AP is permanently activated and deposits C3b molecules to any surface.
  On host cells, these C3b molecules are rapidly inactivated by different membrane
  expressed or plasma complement regulators. (B) Immunologically silent clearance
  of apoptotic cells. Limited complement activation occurs on apoptotic cells. C1q
  recognizes “eat-me” signals on the surface of dying cells. It serves as a bridging
  molecule, facilitating the phagocytosis by dendritic cells or macrophages. Uptake
  of C1q-opsinized cargo induces an anti-inflammatory program, increased expression
  of immunological checkpoint molecules, and prevents up-regulation of maturation
  markers. iC3b on apoptotic cells interacts with CR3 on phagocytes and induces anti-inflammatory
  response. (C) Complement in human T cell homeostasis. Cathepsin L cleaves C3 intracellularly,
  generating C3a and C3b. C3a binds on C3aR, expressed in the lysosomes, and stimulates
  mTOR signaling pathway. This signaling is important for the cell survival in resting
  state.
