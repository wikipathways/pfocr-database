caption: Bioenergenesis neurotransmitter pathways with differentially expressed genes
  between frontal cortex and hypothalamus. A solid line with arrowhead indicates a
  direct reaction or transport. A dashed line with arrowhead indicates more than one
  steps involved in passages. The RNA levels of genes in red or green colors were
  expressed significantly higher or lower in the frontal cortex than in hypothalamus,
  respectively. If the changes in RNA levels were not significant (p>0.05) or less
  than 1.25-fold, the gene symbols or enzymes are not shown in the flow chat. The
  mean expression levels, standard deviations, fold changes, p-values, false discovery
  rate (FDR) and the full name of genes are listed in Table . (A) Bioenergenesis neurotransmitter
  pathways include glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis
  in cytoplasm and β-oxidation, TCA cycle and OXPHOS, REDOX, and neurotransmitter
  synthesis in mitochondria. Double dashed lines represent the inner and outer mitochondrial
  membranes, of which a portion was enlarged to illustrate OXPHOS complexes I, II,
  III, IV and V with differentially expressed genes in each complex. A proton (H+)
  flow and ATP synthesis are indicated. REDOX enzyme (GSTZ1) is involved in removal
  of ROS (e.g. O2-). Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic enzymes with the RNA levels higher
  in the frontal cortex than in hypothalamus for synthesis of neurotransmitters (gray
  ovals) include GLS2 and GPT for synthesis of the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter
  L-glutamate, GAD1 and ABAT for the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric
  acid [GABA], DDC for dopamine, histamine and serotonin, and AGXT for serine and
  glycine. SLC25A18 and SLC25A22 are involved in transport of L-glutamate across mitochondrial
  membranes. (B) Insulin signaling pathway. Insulin binding to its receptor results
  in the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates. This leads to activation
  of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PIK3CB and PIK3R3) and growth factor receptor-bound
  protein (GRB2). The activated PIK3CB and PIK3R3 lead to upregulation insulin-responsive
  genes including hexokinase 2 (HK2). HK2 localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane
  and phosphorylates glucose into glucose-6-phosphate, the first rate-limiting step
  of glycolysis pathway. PIK3CB and PIK3R3 also activate protein synthesis, of which
  22 of 23 genes displayed RNA levels higher in the frontal cortex than in hypothalamus
  (Table ). Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K2) plays a critical role
  in mitogen growth factor signal transduction, and its downregulation suggests decreased
  activities in transferring the GRB2 signal for proliferation and differentiation.
  (C) PPARD signaling pathway. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD)
  is a nuclear hormone receptor and transcriptional regulator and is involved in fatty
  acid transport and oxidation via binding to DNA and regulating transcription.
