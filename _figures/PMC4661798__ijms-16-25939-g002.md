caption: 'Metabolic activation of astrocytes []. Synaptic activity produces an increase
  in extracellular K+, which stimulates Na+K+-ATPase by binding of its extracellular
  K+-sensitive site. The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is taken up by astrocytes
  through excitatory amino acid transporters. This kind of transport produces an increase
  in intracellular Na+, which stimulates Na+K+-ATPase by binding of its intracellular
  Na+-sensitive site. Na+K+-ATPase activation produces a decrease in ATP/ADP ratio,
  thus glycolysis and glycogenolysis activation. In addition, glucose is oxidized
  by pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to produce NADPH and to maintain the redox balance,
  reducing glutathione and ascorbic acid (Asc). Ascorbic acid released by astrocytes
  is taken up by neurons to protect themselves from oxidant species (ascorbic acid
  is oxidized in neurons). Oxidized ascorbic acid (dehydroascorbic acid, Asc+) is
  released from neurons and taken up by astrocytes through GLUT1. In astrocytes, glutamate
  is able to bind ionotropic receptors, which are predominantly calcium channels.
  This Ca2+ increase cooperates with Krebs cycle (TCA) activation and produces arachidonic
  acid (AA) and prostaglandin (PGs), which stimulate the constriction and dilation
  of capillaries, respectively. ADP: adenosine diphosphate; ATP: adenosine triphosphate;
  EAAT: excitatory amino-acid transporter; GLUT: glucose transporter; G-6-P: glucose
  6-phosphate; GSSG: glutathione disulfide; GSH: glutathione; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase;
  MCT: monocarboxylate transporter; Na+K+-ATPase: sodium-potassium pump; NADP+: nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH-reduced form of NADP); PFK1: phosphofructokinase-1;
  TCA: Krebs cycle.'
