  entities for the EGFR signaling pathway among pathway datasets retrieved from Netpath,
  BioCarta, Protein Lounge, STKE and Cell Designer (CellDes). 371 unique interactors
  were collectively identified using all five pathway databases. Out of these 371
  interactors, only 103, 46, 32, 15 or 10 interactors were mentioned in at least two,
  three, four or all five databases, respectively. For investigators who are interested
  in only ‘High-Confidence’ datasets (), the 10 interactors identified in all five
  databases mentioned in this example, would be of particular interest.
