caption: A model for tau pathogenesis. a Tau is a microtubule-binding protein, which
  can undergo various types of post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation
  and truncation. Under disease conditions, aberrant PTMs induces tau dissociation
  from microtubules, leading to tau aggregation and oligomer formation. Tau oligomers
  can further aggregate to form PHFs and NFTs in neurons. Tau aggregates can induce
  mitochondria fragmentation, impair synaptic vesicle mobility and release, thereby
  leading to presynaptic dysfunction. In addition, pathological tau species such as
  truncated tau and tau oligomers can be released to the extracellular environment
  via exosomes or directly from the plasma membrane. b Tau is normally distributed
  to compartments other than postsynaptic densities. Hyperphosphorylated and truncated
  tau species may enter postsynaptic compartments to consequently impair LTP by modulating
  Fyn/NMDAR complexes. Extracellular pathogenic tau species may be internalized in
  neurons through a HSPGs-mediated pathway to induce the aggregation of intracellular
  tau. c Extracellular tau can bind CX3CR1 receptors, and subsequently internalized
  by microglia for degradation. Alternatively, tau released from neurons can enter
  microglia through unknown mechanisms. Internalized tau may be modified and re-released
  from microglia to the extracellular space via exosomes, and then taken up by adjacent
  neurons to induce tau propagation. In addition, pathological tau species can activate
  microglial NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways, leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine
  release. Excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines can increase the activity of tau kinases
  such as CDK5 and P38, thereby exacerbating tau hyperphosphorylation
