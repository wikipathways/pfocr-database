caption: 'The nodes represent genes of the four MAPK pathway modules (the ERK1/2,
  p38, JNK and ERK5 pathways). The outline colours represent the classes of MAPK proteins
  that are encoded by particular genes, as shown on the left side of the figure. The
  abbreviations are as follows: GEFs guanosine exchange factors, GTPase Guanosine
  triphosphatase, MAPKKKK mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase, MAPKKK
  mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, MAPKK mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase, MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase, DUSP dual-specificity phosphatase,
  Other; proteins other than those described above. Node colours represent the frequencies
  of gene mutations, and their increasing colour intensities denote higher percentages
  of tumours with mutations in genes encoding MAPK pathway proteins. In order clearly
  show the cancer-type mutations in the MAPK genes, we have presented the maximum
  gene alteration seen specific cancer types for each gene. This is because the mean
  gene mutation frequencies do not show how certain cancer types tend to have mutations
  in different MAPK genes. Additional, both the mean gene mutations across cancer
  types and the cancer-type maximum mutation rate in each specific MAPK pathway gene
  are given in Supplementary File  in the sheet named “Specific MAPK Gene Mutations”.
  Edges indicate known types of interaction: red for inhibition, black arrows for
  activation, dotted lines for physical protein-protein interactions and green lines
  for interaction with scaffold proteins. To make the visualisation clearer, we have
  omitted some interactions between some network nodes. See Supplementary Fig.  for
  the complete connectivity network of all the MAPK pathway proteins.'
