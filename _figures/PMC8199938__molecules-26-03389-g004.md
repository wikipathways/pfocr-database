caption: 'Anti-inflammatory ECs recommended targets and cell types in inflammatory
  bowel disease. (a), Inflamed bowel cross-section along with infiltration of the
  leukocytes (i.e., lymphocytes (Ly), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PNM), macrophages,
  and mast cells). (b) In macrophages, the synthesis of the MIP-2 macrophage inflammatory
  protein-2 and CXCL-8 (chemokines), TNF-α (Tumour necrosis factor α), and anandamide
  initiated by LPS. Anandamide performs autocrine mediation to inhibit the synthesis
  of TNF-α and synthesis of the chemokine. The inhibition is carried out using receptors
  CB1 or CB2 (one of two or both). The activation of both receptors CB1 and CB2 can
  inhibit the synthesis pathway of TNF-α in mast cells. Consequently, inflammation
  reduction and leukocyte infiltration processes are affected. Stimulation of CB1
  receptor paracrine on extrinsic and intrinsic enteric neurons blocks the release
  of acetylcholine (ACh) and tachykinin, respectively, that results in the inhibition
  of gut motility. The use of the FAAH inhibitor prevents the anandamide breakdown.
