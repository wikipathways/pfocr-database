caption: ATM binds and phosphorylates PICT-1 in the nucleolus upon DNA damage, and
  PICT-1 phosphorylation at S233 and T289 is responsible for DNA damage-induced reduction
  in PICT-1 protein. Both PICT-1 phosphorylation and degradation release RPL11 from
  the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, where it binds and blocks MDM2 activity. This
  allows p53 accumulation and induces apoptosis.
