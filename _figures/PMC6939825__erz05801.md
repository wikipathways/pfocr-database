caption: 'A depiction of the major phosphate and carbon exits from the Calvin–Benson
  cycle. Rates: sucrose, 25–50%; starch, 30–60%; photorespiratory amino acids, 7–15%;
  shikimate pathway, 1–2%; lipids 1–3%; methylerythritol pathway, 1–3%; PEP carboxylation,
  0.5–4%; CO2 release from photorespiration*, 7–12.5% of fixed carbon lost and does
  not contribute to TPU capacity. Abbreviations: E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate; F6P,
  fructose 6-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PGA, 3-phosphoglyceric acid; SBP, sedoheptulose bisphosphate; TP, triose phosphates;
  Xu5P, xylulose 5-phosphate.'
