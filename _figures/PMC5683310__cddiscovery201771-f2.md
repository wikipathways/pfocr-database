caption: Molecular pathways regulated by ZNFs in physiological conditions. (a) ZNF750
  regulates keratinocytes terminal differentiation by interacting with KLF4 and chromatin
  regulators. This interaction leads to the positive regulation of genes (PPL, PKP1)
  involved in differentiation. In addition, ZNF750 interacts with KDM1A and negatively
  regulates progenitor gene expression (RBBP8, HOMER3). ZNF750 directly regulates
  the expression of KLF4, which subsequently modulates the expression of the indicated
  genes. (b) KLF4 regulates epithelial cell differentiation by interacting with β-catenin
  and repressing the WNT signalling pathway. (c) KLF5 is involved in myoblast differentiation,
  acting as a co-factor for MyoD. This action leads to the upregulation of the indicated
  genes. (d) The presence of SLUG on the PPARG promoter reduces HDAC1 recruitment,
  leading to C/EBP-mediated activation of PPARG expression. This effect promotes adipogenesis.
