caption: 'NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathways. Sensing of iE-DAP and/or MDP occurs via
  the LRR domains by NOD1 and NOD2, respectively. Once activated, NOD receptors recruit
  the kinase RIP2 which can interact with LUBAC and the kinase complex TAK1:TAB. This
  complex of proteins can activate two different pathways: (1) activation of the IKK
  complex (NEMO: IKKα: IKKβ) which in turn activates NF-κB nuclear translocation;
  (2) activation of MAP kinases (eg, p38, ERK, and JNK) will activate the transcription
  factor AP1. Both NF-κB and MAPK pathways will induce gene expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and mediators, including anti-microbial peptides (AMP). Alternatively,
  ER stress triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) caused by accumulation of
  unfolded or misfolded proteins and bacterial infection. ER stress activates IRE1α
  (inositol-requiring enzyme 1α) which recruits TRAF2, NOD receptors, and RIPK2 to
  the ER membrane and initiates inflammatory response through NF-κB signaling; however,
  the exact mechanism of NF-κB signaling activation by ER stress is still unclear.
  A cytosolic UPR (cUPR) has been described that is required for NOD1 and NOD2 complex
  formation and activation of NF-κB. Upon PGN recognition, the heat-shock protein
  HSPBB8 is released from the complex with HRI and binds NOD1 or NOD2 allowing the
  folding and release of these receptors from endomembranes. This pathway is associated
  with NF-κB activation, although the mechanism is not totally known. At the bacterial
  entry site on the plasma membrane, NOD2 can recruit the autophagy protein ATG16L1,
  leading to elimination of intracellular pathogens. NOD1 and NOD2 signaling can also
  induce type I interferon expression. NOD2-RIPK2 activates TRAF3 which recruits TBK1
  and induces the IFN-β transcription factor IRF7. In addition, NOD2 is also activated
  by sensing of virus-derived single-strand RNA (ssRNA). Binding of NOD2/TRAF3 to
  mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) induces activation of IRF3 which induces
  IFN-β gene expression'
