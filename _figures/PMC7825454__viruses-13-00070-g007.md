caption: '(A) Proposed signaling pathways regulated by HSV-2 infection and TRIM26
  activation. IRF3 can be phosphorylated, and thereby activated by the TBK1- IKKε
  complex that is induced by signals from: 1) cell surface TLRs (TLR2 and TLR4); 2)
  viral dsDNA triggering endosomal TLRs (TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9) or viral DNA sensors
  (cGAS and IFI16); and 3) viral RNA receptors RLRs (RIG-I and MDA-5). The resulting
  phosphorylation of IRF3 leads to its dimerization and translocation to the nucleus
  where it participates in the transcription of IFN-β and ISGs. Viral infection also
  results in nuclear translocation of TRIM26 that negatively regulates IRF3 activity,
  resulting in a downregulation of antiviral response. TRIM26 impacts the expression
  of other interferons after infection through an unknown mechanism. (B) Overexpression
  of TRIM26 downregulates IRF3 expression and its downstream antiviral factors IFN-β
  and the ISGs MX1 and ISG15, thus leading to increase in viral replication. Knocking
  out of TRIM26 allows for increased IRF3 expression, thereby stimulating IFN-β and
  ISG production to inhibit HSV-2 replication. Abbreviations: TLR, toll-like receptor;
  RLRs, RIG-I-like receptors; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP
  synthase; IFI, interferon-inducible; MDA, melanoma differentiation-associated gene;
  RIG, retinoic acid inducible gene; IFN, interferon; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene.'
