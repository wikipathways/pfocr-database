caption: 'The electron transport chain of M. barkeri has been proposed to comprise
  2 energy-conserving systems, the F420H2:heterodisulfide oxidoreductase and the H2:heterodisulfide
  oxidoreductase. In the former system, F420H2 is oxidized by FpoF releasing 2 electrons
  that are transferred through FpoBCDI and then FpoAHJKLMN to membrane-soluble methanophenazine.
  This reaction is coupled to the pumping of 2 protons outside the cell. Reduction
  of methanophenazine consumes 2 protons from the cytoplasm, which subsequently are
  released outside the cell upon oxidation of MPH2. The electrons then are transferred
  through HdrED to reduce CoM-S-S-CoB with 2 protons from the cytoplasm. Alternatively,
  in the H2:heterodisulfide oxidoreductase, H2 is oxidized by Vht/Vhx to produce 2
  protons outside the cell and 2 electrons that are transferred to MPH2, which then
  is used to reduce CoM-S-S-CoB. The dashed arrow represents a third possible energy-conserving
  mechanism that is proposed in this study. In this pathway, F420H2 is oxidized by
  the cytoplasmic hydrogenase Frh to generate H2. The H2 then diffuses outside the
  cell to the active site of membrane-bound hydrogenase Vht/Vhx, where it is reoxidized,
  resulting in the translocation of 2 protons via a H2-cycling mechanism. The electrons
  are passed through methanophenazine to CoM-S-S-CoB, as in the other 2 systems. In
  all 3 systems, the entire electron transport process leads to the net translocation
  of 4 protons (highlighted in red) outside the cell per 2 electrons transferred from
  F420H2 or H2 to the CoM-S-S-CoB. The electrochemical gradient generated is coupled
  to ATP synthesis via an A-type ATPase. Abbreviations: CoB-SH, coenzyme B; CoM-SH,
  coenzyme M; CoM-S-S-CoB, mixed disulfide of CoM-SH and CoB-SH; Cytb2, cytochrome
  b2; F420/F420H2, oxidized and reduced Factor 420; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide;
  [FeS], iron-sulfur cluster; Fpo, F420H2:phenazine oxidoreductase; Frh, F420-reducing
  hydrogenase; Hdr, heterodisulfide reductase; MP/MPH2, oxidized and reduced methanophenazine;
  [NiFe], bimetallic catalytic center; Vht/Vhx, methanophenazine-dependent hydrogenase.'
