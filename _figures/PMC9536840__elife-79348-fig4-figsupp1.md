caption: 'Full pathway results and possible mechanism for discordant variant rs370014171
  with gene annotation PDPR. rs370014171 (PDPR): The discordant variant rs370014171
  had gene annotation PDPR, which encodes the regulatory unit of the protein pyruvate
  dehydrogenase phosphatase that is responsible for the activation of the pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH) complex that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA
  (supplementary expanded pathway Figure 4-figure supplement 1). One possible mechanism
  for this variant is that it is increasing PDPR activity, leading to increased conversion
  of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, resulting in decreased pyruvate levels and, by compensation,
  decreased lactate levels. In addition, to compensate for the decreased pyruvate
  levels, there could be an increased conversion of alanine to pyruvate and glutamate.
  This would cause a decrease in levels of alanine and an increase in levels of glutamate.
  In response to the increased acetyl-CoA, there could be decreased breakdown of metabolites
  that are normally broken down for its production, including isoleucine and leucine,
  resulting in an increase in their levels. With the increase in acetyl-CoA levels,
  less HMG-CoA is broken down to acetyl-CoA. The reaction of HMG-CoA to acetyl-CoA
  also produces acetoacetate, so this decrease results in a decrease in acetoacetate,
  as well as the other ketone bodies (acetone and -hydroxybutyrate), which are directly
  downstream of acetoacetate. Some of the increase in HMG-CoA (from its decreased
  breakdown) leads to an increase in cholesterol. Meanwhile, alanine to glutamate
  is an important regulator of BCAA levels since the first step in BCAA breakdown
  is a reversible conversion to glutamate. An increase in glutamate’s levels means
  again less BCAA will need to be broken down, which is another potential reason for
  increased levels of the BCAAs (isoleucine, leucine, and valine). This variant was
  also found to be significantly associated with an increase in isoleucine, leucine,
  and valine and a decrease in alanine in another recent metabolomics study (). In
  this dataset, after these four amino acids, the metabolite with the next most significant
  association with this variant lysine (Z = 3.8, p=1e-4) (). Lysine is another amino
  acid that can be catabolized to produce acetyl-CoA and thus like isoleucine, leucine,
  and valine, based on the hypothesized mechanism for this variant it makes sense
  lysine would have a positive association.'
