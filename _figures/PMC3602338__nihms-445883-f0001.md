caption: A) Hsp27 binds to the unfolded proteins that gather in the cytosol during
  stress. The unfolded proteins are then transferred down the protein-folding pathway,
  eventually reaching hsp90. The unfolded proteins are then folded by Hsp90 with the
  assistance of many co-chaperones, including Aha1, CDC37, and p23.B) Unfolded proteins
  accumulate during stress and require excess amounts of the hsps to maintain cellular
  integrity. HSF1 triggers the heat shock response, which is responsible for the up-regulation
  of the hsps and the rescue of cells otherwise sentenced to death. The inhibition
  of hsp27, 40, or 70 would cause a major disruption in the rescue pathway by preventing
  proper protein folding. Improper folding and protein aggregation induces cell death.
