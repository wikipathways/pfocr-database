caption: S1PR signaling pathways in liver regeneration and HCC progression. Sphingosine-1-phosphate
  (S1P) acts as a lipid mediator of various cellular responses such as cell cycle,
  proliferation, and migration, and acts primarily through S1P receptors (S1PR1 to
  S1PR3). S1PR1 mediates cell migration via the Gi/Rac pathway, whereas S1PR2 mediates
  inhibition of migration via the G12/13/Rho pathway. SIPR3 also promotes cell migration
  via the Gi/Rac or Ras/ERK pathway. S1PR1 overexpression was positively correlated
  with vimentin and MMP-9 expression and negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression.
  In addition, S1PR1 overexpression induced EMT and enhanced tumor invasion and cancer
  stemness
