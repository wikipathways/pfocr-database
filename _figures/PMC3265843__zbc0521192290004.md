caption: Ocular carotenoid/retinoid metabolism in Drosophila. A, images of the heads
  of wild-type flies and sine oculis flies, which lack compound eyes. B, schematic
  drawing of a longitudinal section through a fly omatidium. The visual cycle of the
  fly operates between the photoreceptor cells and the secondary pigment cells. Visual
  pigments are sequestered in rhabdomeres R1–R6 of photoreceptor cells, which express
  ninaE, and rhabdomers R7 and R8, which express other opsin genes. C, zeaxanthin
  is converted to one molecule of 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal and one molecule of all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal
  by NinaB expressed in neuronal and glial cells. Transport of 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal
  to photoreceptors depends on the PINTA protein. The all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal cleavage
  product is converted to all-trans-3-hydroxyretinol by PDH. A blue light-dependent
  isomerase reaction mediates 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinol production. 11-cis-3-Hydroxyretinol
  is then converted to 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal. The 11-cis-chromophore binds to different
  fly opsins to form functional visual pigments. Insect visual pigments are bistable,
  so the opsin-bound chromophore can be isomerized back to the 11-cis geometric state
  by light. However, a regeneration pathway for the chromophore is required for the
  released chromophore from internalized rhodopsin. This all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal
  is converted by PDH into all-trans-3-hydroxyretinol, which can be recycled back
  to the chromophore by the enzymatic steps described above. hν, one photon.
