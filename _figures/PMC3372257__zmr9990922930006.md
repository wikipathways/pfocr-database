caption: 'Schematic drawing of the major proteins identified within calicoblastic
  cells. Calicoblastic cells form an epithelium (calicodermis) whose apical membrane
  (AM) is attached to the coral skeleton by desmocytes via a hemidesmosome adhesion
  complex. Their basal pole is close to the mesoglea, a sheet of extracellular matrix
  proteins. Various transport proteins within calicoblastic cells have been identified
  or suggested on the basis of pharmacological evidence: ATPases (Na+ pump and Ca2+
  pump), antiporters (Na+/Ca2+ antiporter and bicarbonate carrier) and channel proteins
  (Ca2+ channel). The presence of numerous mitochondria within calicoblastic cells
  both energizes ion transport and supplies metabolic CO2 as a source of carbon for
  calcification. The presence of carbonic anhydrase within the extracellular calcifying
  medium (between the calicodermis and skeleton) facilitates the chemical equilibrium
  between the different carbon species. In addition, calicoblastic cells synthesize
  and secrete via vesicles a mixture of macromolecules, called the organic matrix
  (OM), which acts as an organic framework. Calcium ions may reach this medium both
  by a paracellular pathway through septate junctions and by transcellular transport,
  aided by the large surface area of the basal lateral membrane (BLM) of the calicoblastic
  cells. The symbiont cell may enhance calcification either by altering the physicochemical
  composition of extracellular fluids by either absorbing CO2 or releasing O2 (1)
  or by supplying organic compounds to the calicoblastic cells, such as precursors
  for skeletal organic matrix synthesis or high-energy molecules (2) (see text for
  more details).'
