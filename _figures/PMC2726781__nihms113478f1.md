caption: The retromer sorting pathway is made up of a coat complex that binds and
  transports transmembrane receptors between the endosome and the trans-Golgi network
  (TGN). In yeast, the coat complex, made up of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) 35,
  VPS26, VPS29, VPS5, and VPS17, binds and transports VPS10 from the endosome back
  to the TGN (red arrow). In nonneuronal mammalian cells, the coat complex, made up
  of VPS35, VPS26, VPS29, VPS5, and VPS17, binds and transports the mannose-6-phosphate
  (M6PR) and the polymeric immunoglobulin (PIGR) receptors from the cell surface to
  endosome and from endosome back to the TGN (red arrows). In neurons, the coat complex
  binds and transports the family of VPS10-containing receptors, including sorLA/LR11.
  sorLA/LR11 binds the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The exact transport itinerary
  of the neuronal retromer sorting pathway remains undetermined (?). ER indicates
  endoplasmic reticulum, NUC, nucleus; and SNX, sorting nexin.
