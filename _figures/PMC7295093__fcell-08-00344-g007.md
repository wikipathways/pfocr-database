caption: 'Dry eye disease-related altered metabolic pathway network of the significantly
  regulated metabolites. Several metabolic pathways of amino acids were activated:
  tryptophan, arginine-proline, and cysteine-methionine metabolism. Notably, phenylalanine-tyrosine-tryptophan
  biosynthesis, glycine-serine-threonine metabolism, and valine-leucine-isoleucine
  biosynthesis were decreased. The increased levels of malate, citric acid, fumarate,
  and lactic acid indicated significant elevation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. Metabolites of adenine, guanine, and inosine
  were significantly inhibited, suggesting decreased purine metabolism. Histidine
  and glutathione metabolism was inhibited, indicated by a decrease in urocanic acid,
  pyroglutamic acid, oxidized glutathione, and spermine. Pyrimidine metabolism was
  inhibited as indicated by the levels of uridine and uracil.'
