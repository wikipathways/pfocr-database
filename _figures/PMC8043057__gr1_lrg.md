caption: 'Potential interactions of proteins encoded by studied genes in COVID-19.
  Complement activation leads to C3 activation and C3 convertase formation on C3-opsonized
  surfaces, culminating in pronounced C3 fragment deposition on complement-targeted
  surfaces (proximal complement). In the presence of increased surface density of
  deposited C3b, the terminal complement is triggered, leading to membrane attack
  complex (MAC) formation on the surface of target cell. The present study focused
  on complement pathway dysregulation resulting from loss-of-function mutations in
  regulatory factors (Factor H, I, THBD/thrombomodulin, Membrane Cofactor Protein/MCP
  or CD46) shown in red, gain-of-function mutations (C3 and Factor B) shown in green,
  mutations shown in black, indicating the unknown effect on complement cascade. In
  addition, variants in ADAMTS13 were studied. ADAMTS13 cleaves von Willebrand factor
  anchored on the endothelial surface, in circulation, and at the sites of vascular
  injury. Proteins found to be of potential clinical significance (FH, C3, THBD, ADAMTS13)
  in COVID-19 are shown in black letters. AP: alternative pathway; Properdin: P; MAC:
  membrane attack complex. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)'
