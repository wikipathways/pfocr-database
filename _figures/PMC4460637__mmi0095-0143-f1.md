caption: De novo threonine biosynthesis pathway. Aspartate is sequentially converted
  to homoserine via a series of enzymatic reactions involving aspartokinase (AspK),
  aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (AspSD) and homoserine dehydrogenase (HSD).
  Homoserine is phosphorylated by HSK to form O-phospho-homoserine, a substrate for
  threonine synthase (ThrS) to produce threonine. Candidate genes for each of these
  metabolic enzymes are shown for Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major.
