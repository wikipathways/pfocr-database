caption: 'Sugar substrates are presented inside the red boxes. Pathways regulated
  or induced by the presence of a specific sugar are indicated by colored background
  and their expressions on different sugars are presented next to the pathway as bar
  graphs: (a) Leloir pathway, (b) HexNAc catabolic pathway, (c) pyruvate fermentation
  pathway, (d) FOS/Inulin glycosyl hydrolase. The relative amounts of enzymes involved
  in the bifid shunt are presented in . Numbers in the parenthesis next to the enzyme
  are the locus tag of each protein expressed.'
