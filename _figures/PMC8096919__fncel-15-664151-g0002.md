caption: Membraneless organelles and associated functions that are impaired by the
  C9orf72 arginine rich DPRs and G4C2 repeat RNA. (1) Nuclear pore complex—Phenylalanine-glycine
  low complexity domains (LCDs) of nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) phase separate
  into a selective hydrogel in the central channel of the nuclear pore. Both the arginine
  rich DPRs and G4C2 RNA have been shown to interact with these nucleoporins, thus
  their altered phase separation may underlie the nucleocytoplasmic transport dysfunction
  seen in C9orf72-ALS/FTD. (2) Stress granules—both the arginine rich DPRs and repeat
  RNA bind and cause the aberrant phase separation of LCD containing stress granule
  proteins inducing formation of poorly dynamic stress granules, which likely contributes
  to the translational repression seen in C9orf72-ALS/FTD models. (3) Nucleolus—Poly-PR
  disrupts the phase separation of the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin with ribosomal
  RNA leading to its mislocalization from nucleoli to the nucleoplasm, and an impairment
  in ribosomal biogenesis; this nucleolar stress may also lead to the observed aberrant
  activation of the p53 pathway. The G-quadruplex forming G4C2 RNA has also been shown
  to associate with the nucleolar protein nucleolin (NCL) and cause nucleolar dysfunction.
  (4) Heterochromatin—poly-PR perturbs phase separation of heterochromatin protein
  1α (HP1α) displacing it from heterochromatin and resulting in its degradation and
  an upregulation of repetitive RNA elements which form double-stranded RNA and initiate
  pathological interferon signaling. (5) Nuclear structures—proteins associated with
  nuclear speckles, paraspeckles, Cajal bodies and Gems interact with both the arginine
  rich DPRs and G4C2 RNA. The arginine rich DPRs have specifically been shown alter
  the liquid-like properties of these organelles and binding to LCD containing U2
  snRNP proteins results in their mislocalization from nuclear speckles to the cytosol
  and reduced splicing activity.
