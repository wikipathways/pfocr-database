caption: Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-induced activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway.
  TGF-β can induce PI3K and Akt activation, possibly through interaction of the p85
  subunit of PI3K with the TGF-β receptors. Activated Akt then controls translational
  responses through mTOR1 and S6K, or directly acts on the translational responses
  by inducing phosphorylation of hnRNPE. TGF-β also induces activation of mTORC2,
  which contributes to enhanced Akt activation and forms a reinforcing feedback loop
  in PI3K-Akt activation. These non-Smad-mediated translational responses collaborate
  with Smad-mediated transcriptional responses during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT), but can antagonize Smad-mediated transcription responses during growth arrest
  or apoptosis. Akt can regulate Smad3 activity by sequestering Smad3 in the cytoplasm
  or inhibiting GSK3β-mediated Smad3 phosphorylation and degradation. Akt can also
  regulate apoptosis or EMT by directly phosphorylating FoxO or Twist1 or inducing
  Snail phosphorylation by GSK3β.
