caption: What regulates the regulators? Six steps from global gene regulation to infection
  and antibiotic tolerance. (a) A selection of well-characterized global transcriptional
  regulators that directly regulate the expression of the las and rhl QS systems.
  (b) The three main branches of QS regulators all regulate their own signal production
  through an autofeedback mechanism that results in the upregulation of their respective
  AI signals, as shown in (c). There is an extensive interplay between the three QS
  pathways. PqsE is colored light purple, distinct from the rest of the PQS pathway,
  because of its role outside of the biosynthesis of PQS related to regulating RhlR
  function. (c) The three main AI signals that bind to their cognate receptors in
  (b). HHQ, the precursor to PQS synthesis is shown because it can also act as an
  activator of PqsR. (d) Downstream regulators may or may not be QS regulated, but
  they exert their influence on QS by repressing the activation of QS through transcriptional
  regulation or binding to the receptors to disrupt their activation. (e) The totality
  of the regulation shown in a-d manifests itself in the timely expression of QS-dependent
  public goods. For simplicity, we highlight only the genes discussed in this review.
  (f) A summary of the effects each of the QS-dependent public goods has during host
  infection. Red bars indicate transcriptional repression. Green arrows indicate transcriptional
  activation. Blue arrows indicate AI production and binding. Orange bars and arrows
  indicate protein-protein interactions that result in activation and repression,
  respectively. Dotted green lines indicate indirect transcriptional activation.
