caption: Metabolomic analysis of the arginine metabolism of the four cervical cell
  lines. C33A cells displayed potentiation of arginine metabolism. Biochemicals displaying
  salient changes among the four cell types are shown as box plots. Each box plot
  provides a measure of scaled intensity, normalised by protein content. The relevant
  pathway map of arginine metabolism is also shown.
