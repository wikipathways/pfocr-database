caption: 'Schematic representation of the proposed enzymatic steps in the FAC -elicited
  JA biosynthesis pathway regulated by SIPK, WIPK and NPR1. During larval feeding,
  wounded plant tissue comes into contact with components of the oral secretion of
  insect larvae, such as fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FAC). The perception of
  FAC s by leaf cells elicits signaling mechanisms that differentially activate 18:3
  release from membrane lipids via the activation of glycerolipase A1 (GLA1) in N.
  attenuata. SIPK and NPR1 participate in the activation of this enzymatic step. However
  unknown independent mechanisms (?) also operate. In contrast, WIPK-mediated mechanisms
  target the activation of OPDA biosynthesis via the regulation of allene oxide synthase
  (AOS) and/or allene oxide cyclase (AOC). Due to the instability of the AOS product
  EOT, AOS and AOC are thought to be in close contact. EOT: 12,13-epoxy-18:3; OPDA:
  (9S,13S)-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid.'
