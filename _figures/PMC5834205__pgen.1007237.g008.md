caption: A model indicating the targets of the CSN and CSN5A in the GA- and ABA- regulated
  seed germination pathway. The CSN complex (or CSN1) promotes germination by facilitating
  SCF-mediated degradation of RGL2 DELLA repressor. CSN5A, independently from the
  CSN complex, is involved in the turnover of ABI5, which acts downstream of RGL2.
  ABI5 appears to have a role in stabilizing RGL2, while RGL2 has been reported to
  activate ABI5 expression directly and by inducing ABA synthesis.
