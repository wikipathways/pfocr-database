caption: 'Overview of terpenoid biosynthetic pathway in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii.
  The plastidic MEP pathway begins with the condensation of pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate (G3P) leading to the formation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and
  its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). The condensation of DMAPP with one
  or more IPP units leads to the formation of the following direct precursors; geranyl
  pyrophosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP). The introduced additional copy of the gene is indicated by +, whereas the
  potential flux increase of the corresponding IPP and DMAPP is presented by ↑↑. The
  subsequent effect on downstream metabolites to be investigated is indicated by??.
  Dashed arrows indicate a number of steps are involved but are not shown. Abbreviations:
  DXS, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; DXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate;
  IDI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; SPPs solanesyl diphosphate synthase; PSY,
  phytoene synthase and GGR, geranylgeranyl reductase.'
