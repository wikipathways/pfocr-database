caption: Sequestration of different host components into viroplasmic condensates.
  RV dismantles P bodies and SGs during infection. Many of the SG (ADAR1, eIF2α, Caprin1,
  PKR, Staufen1, CPEB, 4EBP) and P body (DDX6, Lsm1, Caf1, PARN, XRN1, DCP1a, DCP1b)
  components relocate to viroplasms at least transiently or partially and interact
  with viroplasmic proteins. Additionally, many hnRNPs and ARE-BPs are re-located
  from the nucleus to the cytosol, get sequestered within viroplasms, and interact
  with NSP2 and NSP5 within RV infected cells. Many relocated RBPs are also absorbed
  by the viral transcripts. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER leads to
  uncoupling of GRP78 from UPR sensors, resulting in activation of the three branches
  of UPR-the ATF6 pathway, the PERK-dependent pathway, and the IRE1-based signalling.
  During early hours of infection, RV activates the ATF6 and IRE1 branches of the
  UPR. Following dissociation from GRP78, the transcriptionally inactive fragment
  of ATF6 (ATF6p90) is translocated to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved into
  the transcriptionally active fragment (ATF6p50) which is further transported to
  the nucleus to trans-activate UPR elements (CHOP, GADD34, GRP78 and GRP94). Despite
  initial activation of the ATF6 branch of UPR, RV inhibits transcription of UPR elements
  by sequestering the ATF6p50 fragment into viroplasms. Moreover, activation of the
  IRE1 pathway includes dimerized and autophosphorylated IRE1 (p-IRE1) to trigger
  splicing of xbp1 mRNA (xbp1u) to generate a spliced variant (xbp1s). However, further
  translation of the xbp1s is prevented as a result of the host translational inhibition
  mediated by RV-NSP3. Release of PERK from GRP78 leads to homo-dimerization and phosphorylation
  of PERK; however, RV sequesters p-PERK in the viroplasms inhibiting further activation.
  Additionally, RV blocks the potential antiviral effects of UPR by inhibiting the
  translation of ER stress responsive genes and by re-locating many UPR effector proteins
  (CHOP, GADD34, GRP78, GRP94) near/within viroplasms at the late hours of infection.
