caption: (a) Some iNKT cell hybridomas and clones can readily be activated by CD1d-expressing
  APCs. During steady state, some self-antigens, depicted as x (in red), are loaded
  into CD1d molecules in the ER/secretion pathway and other self-antigens, depicted
  as y (in blue), are loaded into CD1d in the endosomes/lysosomes with the help of
  lipid transfer proteins (depicted as green circles), and both are presented by CD1d
  molecules at the surface of APCs. (b) A combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (IL-12, type I interferons) and recognition of self-antigen(s) can trigger an iNKT
  cell response. (c) Upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules at the surface of activated
  APCs helps triggering the response of iNKT cells toward self-antigen(s) presented
  by CD1d. (d) Under certain conditions, CD1d molecules might aggregate within lipid
  rafts at the surface of the APCs and trigger a response by iNKT cells. (e) Following
  activation, high affinity agonist self-antigen(s), depicted as z (in green), are
  generated and loaded onto CD1d in the lysosomes of APCs with the help of lipid transfer
  proteins and replace otherwise weakly stimulatory self-antigen(s), x and y, that
  are usually presented by CD1d at steady state. Of course, these various possibilities
  to induce an iNKT cell response against “self” are not mutually exclusive.
