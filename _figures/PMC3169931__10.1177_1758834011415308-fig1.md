caption: The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway with BRAF and MEK inhibitor
  sites of action. One mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibition is hypothesized
  to occur through upregulation of NRAS and CRAF with subsequent evasion of BRAF and
  thus continued signaling and cell proliferation.
