caption: The effects of virus mediated targeting of PDZ proteins often converge on
  the PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathway. A schematic of the PI3K/AKT pathway showing
  the PDZ proteins involved that are targets of the viral proteins. PDZ proteins are
  identified by black outline. PIP2 and PIP3 are phosphoinositides. The reader should
  refer to the text for a fuller explanation of the effects of the virus proteins
  on the signalling pathway.
