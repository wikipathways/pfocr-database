caption: The H/N-Ras spatial cycle uses an acylation cycle and vectorial transport
  to maintain localization and counter entropy increase. (A) Golgi-confined palmitoylation
  of Ras and transport to the PM through the secretory pathway, account for enrichment
  of H/N-Ras at the Golgi and PM, respectively. This palmitoylated Ras will slowly
  redistribute to all membranes (leakage). Ubiquitous depalmitoylation by thioesterases,
  such as APT1, converts mislocalized palmitoylated Ras to the fast-diffusing solely
  farnesylated form. Diffusion increases the probability of a Golgi encounter, in
  which it is (re)-palmitoylated and transported to the PM through the secretory pathway.
  (B) Perturbation of the spatial cycle through thioesterase inhibition, leads to
  eventual leakage from the PM, and equilibrium binding of palmitoylated Ras on all
  cellular membranes, effectively diluting Ras on the plasma membrane and attenuating
  its signalling response.
