caption: (A) Engineered metabolic pathway for the biosynthesis of disubstituted MAAs.
  The knockout of the transaldolase gene TAL1 and its paralog NQM1 (Red) limits the
  conversion of S7P into the unwanted F6P. The introduction of the xylose-utilizing
  pathway xyl1, 2, and 3 (Magenta) enhances S7P production by directing xylose into
  PPP. The double knock-in of mysA and mysB and the introduction of mysC (Green) achieve
  the biosynthesis of MG. mysDs including Np.mysD and Nl.mysD (Blue and Purple) direct
  the synthesis of disubstituted MAAs including shinorine and porphyra-334 (Yellow
  and Blue). The reaction mechanism from MG to disubstituted MAAs is shown. The tetrahedral
  intermediate (middle) was used for molecular docking. Abbreviations of metabolites
  are provided in the glossary of Supporting Information. (B) Stepwise yeast engineering
  for MAA production. The orange bubbles represent individual chromosomes, whereas
  sites of knockout and insertion are labeled as red dashes. The knock-in of the second
  copy of mysA and mysB and the deletion of the NQM1 gene were simultaneously accomplished
  in step4
