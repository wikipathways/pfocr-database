caption: 'Analyzing the observations comprehensively on modular study and referring
  to related literature, the signaling pathway from TGFβ1 targeting OCIAD2 was concluded
  as shown in : the signaling transmits from TGFβ1- TGFβR1- AR-OCIAD2 in liver cancer
  mesenchymal stem cell, then differentiates into Tumor-Associated-Fibroblasts (TAFs)
  in tumor stroma. As the only known mammalian coSMAD, SMAD4 transferred signaling
  from cytoplasm to TGFB signal. AR, the symbol of androgen receptor, mainly functioned
  as a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates target gene expression from
  cytoplasm into nucleus.'
