caption: Schematic model of downstream signaling after GPCR activation. After chemokine
  binding, Gα and Gβγ subunits dissociate and GDP is exchanged for GTP. Gβ subunits,
  Rac1, Plcβ2, and Plcβ3 form a macromolecular complex upon activation, leading to
  generation of IP3 (black circles), which in turn binds to IP3-gated calcium stores
  leading to calcium release (black stars). Finally, activated LFA-1 upshifts to the
  high-affinity conformation. Dotted arrows, question marks, and molecules in light
  gray circles indicate potential alternative signaling pathways which might also
  play a role in downstream signaling leading to LFA-1 activation.
