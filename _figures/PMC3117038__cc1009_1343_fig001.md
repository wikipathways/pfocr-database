caption: The roles of CARM1 and coactivator methylation in DNA damage signaling pathway.
  DNA damage activates ATM kinase and promotes the activity of tumor suppressors p53
  and BRCA1. CARM1 methylates coactivator p300 and histones and induces coactivator
  complex formation with BRCA1 and other BRCT domain proteins for expression of p21,
  Gadd45 and other CDKIs. This leads to cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair in
  response to genotoxic stress. CARM1, p300 and BRCA1 are not required for expression
  of genes involved in the apoptosis branch of the DNA damage response pathway. CARM1
  may be an essential factor inducing cell cycle arrest and cell survival rather than
  apoptosis in the DNA damage signaling pathway.
