caption: DT-Web Drug Combination Prediction Example. Once the user submits a list
  of genes, DT-Web calculates, using the pathways stored in the database, a list of
  possible drugs that indirectly target such genes, using the pipeline described above.
  When finished, the user will see a list of such drugs, ordered by direct and indirect
  targets, which can be filtered by selecting an appropriate combination of parameters
  (either one or more drugs/targets). By selecting a drug or a target, the user will
  also view an excerpt of the pathway used by the algorithm to compute the prediction.
  By clicking on a drug the user obtains a list of predicted targets.
