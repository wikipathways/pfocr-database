caption: Model for role of Hippo pathway in stress responses. Xenobiotic and other
  forms of stress induce an apoptotic stimulus driven by Yki, which interacts with
  the stress response transcription factor p53. The strong apoptotic response needs
  to be modulated in order to prevent cell death and tissue degeneration. The Hippo
  pathway is activated in the presence of cellular stress and acts as negative regulator
  of Yki/p53-induced cell death
