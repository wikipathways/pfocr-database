caption: Proposed mechanisms of neurotoxicity of α-LTX in the neuromuscular junction.
  (1) In the presynaptic membrane, the wing region (N-terminal domain) of α-latrotoxin
  (α-LTX) interacts with neurexin-Iα (NXR-Iα), protein tyrosine phosphatase σ (PTPσ),
  and latrophilin 1 (LPH1). This interaction facilitates the insertion of the tetramer
  into the lipid bilayer, allowing the influx of monovalent (Li+, Cs+, Na+, K+) and
  divalent (Ca2+, Ba2+, Mg2+) alkali cations. (2) The excess of Na+ induces the release
  of more Ca2+ from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm. (3) α-LTX triggers LPH1 signaling,
  resulting in the activation of the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC)
  pathway. PLC increases the levels of inositol trisphosphate, promoting the release
  of intracellular Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum. (4) The depolarization
  of the presynaptic terminal activates voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), allowing
  the influx of more Ca2+. (5) The massive increase in intracellular Ca2+ promotes
  the mobilization of synaptic vessels (SV) containing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine
  (Ach). (6) The release of Ach into the synaptic cleft can be either due to the fusion
  of SVs with the plasma membrane or due to the leakage of the neurotransmitter through
  the α-LTX pore. (7) The interaction of Ach with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
  (nAChR) present in the membrane of the myocyte causes depolarization and muscle
  contraction.
