caption: Strain-specific host gene networks activated in Mtb-infected BMM. Significantly
  differentially expressed host genes upon infection by CDC1551 or HN878 of BMM at
  6 and 24 hpi were used to construct strain-specific networks by IPA. (A) Early immune
  activation network (EIAN); genes in this network were significantly up-regulated
  only in CDC1551 infected BMM at 6 hours. (B) Insignificant expression of EIAN genes
  during HN878 infection of BMM at 6 hours. (C and D) A subset of lipid metabolism
  pathway genes significantly activated only in HN878 infected BMM at 24 hours. (D)
  The majority of genes in the lipid metabolism pathway were not significantly expressed
  during CDC1551 infection of BMM at 24 hours. Up-regulated genes are marked red and
  down-regulated genes are marked green with their absolute level of expression under
  respective gene symbols (also described in Additional file ). Solid lines indicate
  direct interaction and broken lines represent indirect interaction between the genes
  in the network.
