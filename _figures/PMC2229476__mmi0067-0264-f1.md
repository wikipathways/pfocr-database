caption: Phosphorylation of lipid A by LpxT is linked to the recycling of C55-P. The
  carrier lipid C55-P is first synthesized in its pyrophosphate form (C55-PP) by UppS
  synthase on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. Prior to its use, the lipid
  must be dephosphorylated by an undecaprenyl pyrophosphatase. An example of the recycling
  of C55-P during the synthesis of the essential bacterial polymer peptidoglycan is
  shown. The MraY and MurG enzymes catalyse the successive transfers of the MurNAc-pentapeptide
  and GlcNAc motifs from the peptidoglycan nucleotide precursors onto C55-P, generating
  the lipid I and lipid II intermediates respectively. Following transport of lipid
  II across the inner membrane, reactions catalysed by the penicillin-binding proteins
  (PBPs) begin. This results in the generation of free C55-PP that must be dephosphorylated
  prior to its reuse for de novo peptidoglycan biosynthesis (, ). LpxT (formerly YeiU)
  dephosphorylates C55-PP and transfers the phosphate group to lipid A to form lipid
  A 1-diphosphate contributing to the recycling of C55-P. It cannot be excluded that
  LpxT may dephosphorylate C55-PP that has been directly transported across the inner
  membrane (indicated by dashed arrow) as part of the C55-P de novo synthesis pathway.
  All enzymes are indicated in blue.

    The carrier lipid C55-P is first synthesized in its pyrophosphate form (C55-PP)

    the lipid must be dephosphorylated by an undecaprenyl pyrophosphatase. An example
