caption: The establishment of WNT/PCP signaling is vital for vertebrate development.
  All Robinow syndrome associated genes result in proteins that play a role in WNT/PCP
  signaling, therefore, dysregulation of the WNT pathway in humans may be the cause
  of Robinow syndrome. ROR2 is a co-receptor of FZD2, which binds to extracellular
  ligand WNT5A, together they can activate the non-canonical WNT signaling, which
  is associated with planar cell polarity in drosophila and the equivalent convergent-extension
  movement during gastrulation in vertebrates (; Sokol, 2000; Yamanaka et al., 2002).
  DVLs are key downstream mediators of the WNT pathway and NXN was found to be a negative
  regulator of the WNT pathway. This model is adapted and revised from a previous
  version (). We removed a potential candidate gene RAC3 since the clinical phenotype
  of the patient who has a potentially pathogenic variant in RAC3 is more consistent
  with clinically distinct RAC3-related neurodevelopmental disorder (; ; ) than with
  DRS.
