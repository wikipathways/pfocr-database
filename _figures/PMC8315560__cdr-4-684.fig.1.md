caption: 'Mechanisms related to CSC and EMT involved in drug resistance in cancer
  described in this review. The CSC phenotype is a plastic state and can be adopted
  by most cancer cells. CSCs are slow-cycling or quiescent, and circumvent therapies
  targeting rapidly-dividing cells. CSCs exhibit increased activities of detoxifying
  proteins including ALDH and ABC transporters (P-gp, BCRP). CSCs maintain low levels
  of ROS by metabolic reprogramming and/or auto/mitophagy to protect from radio- and
  chemo-therapies. Hypoxia and Hifα are crucial regulators of metabolic reprogramming
  primarily by increasing flux to glycolysis and antioxidant production (e.g., GSH)
  and inducing autophagy. Hypoxia and Hifα are also emerging inducers of EMT/CSC phenotype,
  one of the mechanisms is via NF-κB signaling pathway activation (not shown in the
  figure). EMT is a crucial regulator of and tightly interconnected with CSC, their
  involvement in drug resistance may represent different manifestations of the EMT/CSC
  phenotype. Activation of diverse signaling pathways are involved in the induction
  of EMT/CSC phenotype, including developmental pathways (e.g., Wnt/β-catenin, Hh/Gli1,
  Notch), cell survival pathways (e.g., GFR), and EMT-related pathways (e.g., TGF-β/SMAD
  signaling). The above pathways act independently or cross talk with each other to
  induce EMT/CSC phenotypes, leading to elevated drug resistance by various mechanisms:
  (1) The activation of these pathways allows the maintenance of CSC properties, including
  enhanced drug resistance. (2) These pathways converge on EMT-TFs (e.g., Snail, Slug,
  Zeb, Twist, FOX, etc.) to alter the expression of EMT markers (e.g., increase in
  N-cadherin, vimentin; decrease in E-cadherin) and induce EMT; the downstream transcription
  factor of the above pathways, as well as EMT-TFs, can upregulate ABC transporters,
  leading to enhanced drug efflux. EMT-TFs also enhance stemness and anti-apoptotic
  signaling. (3) The activation of these pathways is associated with enhanced anti-apoptotic
  machinery and thereby promotes tumor cell survival. (4) Certain pathways and EMT-TFs
  like Zeb1 can enhance ATM and CHK1/2-mediated DNA-damage repair and promote resistance
  to genotoxic therapies. (5) Non-cancer cells such as CAFs and TAMs in the TME can
  also activate these signaling pathways by secreted proteins and thus promote drug
  resistance. CSC: Cancer stem cell; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition; ALDH:
  aldehyde dehydrogenase; ABC transporters: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters;
