caption: Phosphorylation life cycle of SRC-3 and probabilistic interactions. (A) The
  vast majority of SRC-3 is nuclear resident, but both the nuclear and cytoplasmic
  pools are dynamic. SRC-3 contains an NLS and an NES that regulate its import and
  export, respectively. External stimuli activate the cytoplasmic ERK signaling pathway,
  which in turn promotes SRC-3 phosphorylation. This results in an increase in the
  kinetics of import and the nuclear concentration of SRC-3 where it exhibits rapid
  molecular dynamics. (B) Phosphorylated SRC-3 has a high-affinity interaction with
  ERα and other coregulators (e.g., CBP, CARM1, and P/CAF) in the nucleoplasm. These
  interactions lead to a reduced mobility and the formation of random and transient
  foci, which are generally not associated with transcription sites based strictly
  upon three-dimensional probabilities. (C) When dynamically bound to chromatin (),
  ERα can specifically interact with phosphorylated SRC-3, which recruits other members
  of the chromatin remodeling machinery to initiate transcriptional activation. Phosphorylation-driven
  equilibria increase the probability of forming transient complexes at a target gene
  and are critical to ERα-regulated gene expression. ERE, ER element; kOFF, constant
  of dissociation of the ER at the promoter.
