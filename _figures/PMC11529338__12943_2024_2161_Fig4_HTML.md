caption: Osteoclast-mediated bone resorption reactivates dormant tumor cells. When
  bone tissue is damaged or stimulated, osteoclasts are activated and cluster at the
  bone surface. Through the release of acidic protons and enzymes, they lower the
  pH of the bone matrix, resulting in the breakdown of inorganic salts and collagen
  fibers. This process leads to bone resorption and the release of growth factors
  and extracellular matrix components stored in the bone matrix. In the presence of
  active osteoclasts, dormant tumor cells can be reactivated as the released growth
  factors and matrix-derived molecules bind to receptors on the tumor cells, leading
  to the activation of cellular signaling pathways associated with proliferation,
  survival, and immune evasion. This reactivation process may promote the transition
  of dormant tumor cells from a quiescent to an active state, facilitating their growth,
  invasion, and metastasis
