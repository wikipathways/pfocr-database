caption: IRE1α arm of the unfolded protein response. IRE1α is an endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) transmembrane protein that becomes activated when misfolded proteins in the
  ER lumen bind to its luminal domains. The cytoplasmic tail of IRE1α has two enzymatic
  activities—a serine/threonine kinase domain and an endoribonuclease (RNase) domain.
  Upon luminal binding of misfolded proteins, IRE1α’s kinase becomes activated and
  trans-autophosphorylates multiple serine/threonine residues on the cytosolic tail.
  IRE1α phosphorylation leads to allosteric activation of the adjacent RNase. The
  consequences of IRE1α activation vary depending on the level of ER stress. In response
  to low levels of ER stress, IRE1α’s RNase excises a 26-nt intron from the mRNA encoding
  the XBP1 (X-box protein 1) transcription factor to produce the homeostatic transcription
  factor XBP1s. XBP1s then translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription of
  many genes that augment ER size and function in an attempt to restore ER homeostasis.
  However, if ER stress is irremediable, IRE1α becomes hyperactivated and undergoes
  homo-oligomerization. Under sustained oligomerization, IRE1α’s RNase endonucleolytically
  degrades hundreds of ER-localized mRNAs containing an N-terminal signal sequence,
  which depletes ER cargo and protein-folding components to further worsen ER stress.
  Moreover, when hyperactivated, IRE1α’s RNase directly cleaves select microRNAs that
  normally repress proapoptotic targets. In addition to signaling through RNA substrates,
  IRE1α oligomerization has been shown to induce activation or upregulation of a number
  of proinflammatory proteins, including the pro-oxidant protein TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting
  protein), to activate the inflammasome and its Caspase-1-dependent prodeath pathway.
  Finally, sustained IRE1α oligomerization serves as an activation platform for ASK1
  (apoptosis signal–regulating kinase) and its downstream target JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal
  kinase). Phosphorylation by JNK has been reported to both activate proapoptotic
  BIM and inhibit antiapoptotic BCL-2. Once activated, BH3-only proteins such as BID
  and BIM disable mitochondrial protecting proteins (e.g., BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1) and
  in some cases directly trigger the multidomain proapoptotic BAX and BAK proteins
  to permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane and release toxic mitochondrial
  proteins, such as cytochrome c, into the cytoplasm, where they lead to activation
  of downstream effector caspases (e.g., Caspase-3) and cell demise. Modified with
