caption: A schematic diagram explaining how TRPC3 and NFATc1 signaling would regulate
  cell migration in MDA-MB-231. Long-term knockdown of TRPC3 (e.g. by lenti-shTRPC3)
  inhibits the Ca2 + entry across plasma membrane. This decrease in Ca2 + influx would
  in turn cause the translocation of NFATc1 from the nucleus to the cytosol and the
  NFATc1 signaling pathway would be inactivated concomitantly. When NFATc1 is activated,
  it would bind to the promoter of GPC6 and positively affect its expression. Due
  to the translocation of NFATc1 to the cytosol, nuclear NFATc1 would decrease, leading
  to less GPC6 being transcribed and expressed. In MDA-MB-231, GPC6 proteins directly
  interact with vinculin (a component of FAs) and regulate the actin cytoskeleton
  organization and the dynamics of FAs turnover. These would in turn determine cell
  migration. Long-term knockdown of GPC6 decreases migration of MDA-MB-231. Our study
  highlights a key functional role of the TRPC3-NFATc1-GPC6-vinculin signaling cascade
  in maintaining the migration of TNBC cells
