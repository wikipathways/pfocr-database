caption: Molecules detected at altered levels in T24MshPFN1- versus T24MshSCR transduced
  cells are marked. An overall decrease in the activity of the pathway is predicted.
  The pathway was generated by Ingenuity pathway Analysis software (IPA) and further
  adjusted to depict schematically the main modules that were introduced in this study.
