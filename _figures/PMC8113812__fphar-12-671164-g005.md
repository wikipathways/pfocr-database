caption: Role of exosomes derived from epithelial and endothelial cells in sepsis.
  Epithelium-derived exosomes promote activation, proliferation, migration, infiltration
  and M1 polarization of macrophages through multiple miRNAs-mediated NF-κB activation,
  PTEN inhibition and caspase3-mediated ROCK1 activation. However, salidroside can
  induce epithelial exosomes releasing miR-146a, which inhibit TLR4/IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB
  signaling pathway. Exosomal PGE2 of IEC inhibit T cells through cAMP/PKA-dependent
  pathway①, and decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines release via autocrine and paracrine.
  Exosomal HSPA12b of endothelium reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines release and adhesion
  of macrophages by Inhibiting NF-κB② and activating PI3K/Akt③signaling separately.
  Endothelial exosomes can induce a M2-like phenotype in monocyte through Inhibiting
  TLR/IRAK4/TAK1/NF-κB④signaling pathway and promote DC maturation and T cell activation.
