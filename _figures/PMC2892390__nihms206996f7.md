caption: (A) A diagrammatic view of the lateral pouch during canal morphogenesis.
  Cross-repressive interactions between Lrig3 and Ntn1 define the boundary between
  fusing (blue) and non-fusing (red) regions of the otic epithelium. When the regulatory
  loop is interrupted by loss of Lrig3, fusion is expanded, while in Ntn1 mutants,
  fusion does not occur. Interactions between Lrig3 and Ntn1 ensure that these two
  genes become confined to distinct domains of the lateral pouch. (B) We propose the
  following model for the Lrig3/Ntn1 feedback loop. Lrig3 is present throughout the
  canal pouch before fusion and inhibits activity of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
  signaling pathway (1). Subsequently, fusion is initiated by an unknown fusion plate
  signal, which we hypothesize acts through the RTK pathway by inhibiting Lrig3 (2),
  resulting in transcription of Ntn1 (3). Lrig3 initially continues to be transcribed,
  as expected for a feedback-induced antagonist. However, the increased levels of
  Ntn1 eventually inhibit Lrig3 expression, either by inhibiting Lrig3 or by potentiating
  activity of the fusion plate signal. For instance, Ntn1 protein may augment activity
  of the RTK pathway by promoting basal lamina breakdown (4).
