caption: Mechanisms of action of the enteropathogenic yersiniae Ysc T3SS effectors
  (Yops) on host cell signaling and survival. As shown, membrane-bound Yersinia Yad
  and invasin proteins bind host cell β1-integrins, bringing the bacteria into close
  proximity to the host cell thereby facilitating insertion of the T3SS injectisome
  needle-like structure into the targeted host cell. Yops are then translocated across
  the host plasma membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they interact with the cytoskeleton
  and host cell signaling molecules. YopO/YpkA interacts directly with the cytoskeleton,
  as well as the small GTPase signaling molecules, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. YopE inhibits
  the activities of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. YopP/J promotes LPS-induced host cell apoptosis
  and directly induces capsase-1 cleavage. YopP/J also inhibits mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPK) and IKK-mediated NF-κB activation, which prevents expression
  of proinflammatory and cell survival genes. YopM forms a complex with Rsk and Pkn
  in the host cell nucleus, which is believed to contribute to bacterial pathogenesis.
