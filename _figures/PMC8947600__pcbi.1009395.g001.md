caption: (a) Example metabolic network under Culture Medium 1 (CM1). We have 5 reactions
  (rE1, r1, r2, r3, r4), 4 metabolites (M1, A, B, C) and 3 genes (g1, g2, g3). rE1
  is an input exchange reaction and represents the availability of M1; (b) g1 and
  g2 are synthetic lethals under CM1. (c) If g2 is not active (red dotted line), the
  inhibition of g1 is essential under CM1. (d) Example metabolic network under Culture
  Medium 2 (CM2). With respect to the metabolic network in (a), we have 2 additional
  reactions (rE2, r5) and 1 additional metabolite (M2). rE2 is an input exchange reaction
  and represents the availability of M2; (e) g1 and g2 are not synthetic lethal under
  CM2 due to the alternative pathway via M2 degradation (in green). (f) The inhibition
  of g1 and g2 and deprivation of M2 in the metabolic network from (d) renders cellular
  proliferation impossible. (g) gMCSs and ngMCSs for CM1 and CM2. Gray dotted lines
  stand for not active/not present reactions/metabolites.
