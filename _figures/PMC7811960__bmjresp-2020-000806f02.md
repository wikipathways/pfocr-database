caption: Azithromycin effects in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 after receptor-mediated
  endocytosis, both viral (PAMP) and host released (DAMP) molecules trigger antiviral
  pathways. SARS-CoV-2 induces a strong NF-KB pathway activation but supresses interferon-related
  gene transcription. This promotes macrophage activation and the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and supresses an effective cellular immune answer. In severe COVID-19,
  this imbalanced immune answer causes a so called ‘cytokine storm’. Neutrophils are
  drawn to the site of inflammation. Together with activated endothelial cells they
  contribute to hypercoagulation. They also contribute to a strong fibroblast activation,
  raising the concern for fibrotic complications in the long term. Current data shows
  that an effective Th2 response is more likely to occur in severe infection. It remains
  uncertain whether immunoglobulin release is beneficial or rather enhances the acute
  inflammation by mechanisms such as antibody-dependent enhancement. Azithromycin
