caption: Interactions of COPD and OSAS in inflammatory mechanisms that predispose
  to cardiovascular disease. Both COPD and OSAS are associated with elevated levels
  of CRP and IL-6, in addition to TNF-α and IL-8, and are also associated with oxidative
  stress. However, cigarette smoking and obesity are confounding variables in these
  associations. Hypoxia is a key factor in elevated TNF-α production in OSAS, which
  is particularly relevant to the overlap syndrome. In OSA, and to a lesser extent
  COPD, the hypoxia is usually intermittent, which is particularly pro-inflammatory.
  Each inflammatory pathway has been associated with atherogenesis and subsequent
  cardiovascular disease. COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; OSA, obstructive
  sleep apnoea; CRP, c-reactive protein; IL-6, interleukin-6; TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor alpha; IL-8, interleukin-8. Reproduced from ().
