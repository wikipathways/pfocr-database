caption: 'Pathways for NAD+ biogenesis and consumption. Intracellular NAD+ is synthesized
  either from tryptophan (de novo pathway) or from nicotinamide riboside (NR), nicotinamide
  (NAM), or nicotinic acid (NA) (salvage pathways). Once internalized, NAM and NR
  merge at the step of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is converted into
  NAD+. NA is converted to NA adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) and then to NAD+. Depletion
  of NAD+ is associated with enzymatic reactions that take place intracellularly:
  CD38/NAD+-glycohydrolase, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases (PARPs), and Sirtuins. NAD+
  is also used as a cofactor by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) for 1) the generation of
  intracellular adenosine from methionine, and 2) the activity of a viral SAM-dependent
  methyl transferase (MTase) enzyme, composed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nonstructural proteins (nsp) 14 and 16, active for viral
  cap formation during viral replication. Extracellular NAD+ is metabolized by CD38,
  the first enzyme within a purinergic signaling cascade that, together with CD203
  and CD73, generates exogenous adenosine.'
