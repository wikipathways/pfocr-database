caption: 'A schematic representation of the function of SAMMSON in different cancers.
  SAMMSON, by promoting Wnt activation, and sponging miR‐9‐3p increases hepatocellular
  carcinoma. In breast cancer, SAMMSON promotes tumour progression via facilitation
  of epigenetic modulations. SAMMSON, by sponging miRNAs affects different aspects
  of tumour behaviour. On the contrary, silencing of SAMMSON inhibits the production
  of ROS, and reduces drug resistance, which results in inhibiting the growth of cancer
  cells. In glioblastoma, SAMMSON via the activation of PI3K/Akt signalling pathway
  and sponging of miR‐622 effects EMT process and cell proliferation. Also in PTC,
  SAMMSON can interact with p300 and promotes the expression levels of SP1 as a transcription
  factor. TCF/LEF: T‐cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor, EMT: Epithelial‐mesenchymal
  transition, Me: Methylation, SP1: A transcription factor, PTC: Papillary thyroid
  cancer, ROS: Reactive oxygen species.'
