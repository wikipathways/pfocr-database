caption: The hypothesized relationship of FKBP5 DNA methylation and cardiometabolic
  risk. Our findings demonstrate evidence that FKBP5, and therefore likely the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  axis, play a role in metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk and outcome. FKBP5,
  and the glucocorticoid receptor, is expressed in the brain, intestinal endothelial,
  and epithelial tissues. FKBP5 expression in the brain (hypothalamus and hippocampus)
  as well as these other tissues has been associated previously with the influences
  of stress and cortisol load, exercise, and diet. Prior demonstration has also shown
  the function of FKBP5 to play a role in adipogenesis and in endothelial changes
  in myocardial infarction. Taken together, these associations are hypothesized to
  link to risk and outcomes in cardiometabolic disease through methylation of FKBP5,
  and therefore, potentially expression or sensitivity of the glucocorticoid receptor.
  The methylation of FKBP5 is associated with increased clinical risk factors for
  disease including hyperlipidemia (elevated LDL), chronic hyperglycemia (elevated
  HbA1c), and obesity (high BMI and WC) in individuals with diabetes. Further, methylation
  of FKBP5 may be associated with cardiovascular procedures and inversely associated
  with exercise independent of LDL and obesity. Though many clinical trials have established
  the classical model of pathophysiologic associations with diabetes and hyperglycemia,
  hyperlipidemia, obesity, and cardiometabolic disease, the findings illustrated here
  demonstrate that there may be a role for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
  and glucocorticoid pathway dysfunction in the underlying pathophysiology of cardiometabolic
  disease risk and outcomes
