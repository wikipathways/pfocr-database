caption: Schematic view of the TLR4 signaling pathways between MSCs and HCC cells
  in inflammation microenvironment. This signaling pathway activated by viral proteins
  and inflammatory conditions can ultimately lead to the activation of the NF-κB transcription
  factor. This transcription factor after entering the nucleus, induced expression
  of the factors involved in proliferation, survival inflammation, and carcinogenesis.
  The TSG-6 factor produced by MSCs leads to inhibition of this pathway, but IL-1α/β
  is an activator for NF-κB inducing. MSCs prevent the effect of IL-1α/β by the production
  of soluble receptors
