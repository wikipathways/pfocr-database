caption: Schematic showing MYCN down-regulation by didymin and based on network analyses
  of our proteomic studies that focused on cancer-related pathways active in NB cells.
  The MAPK/ERK pathway (also known as the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathways) is a cell-signaling
  pathway that plays a vital role in normal cell division and growth. Mutations that
  result in constitutive activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway have been implicated in
  a broad range of solid tumors and are associated with tumor resistance to standard
  cancer therapies. Inhibition of MEK, which is pivotal protein kinase in the MAPK/ERK
  pathway, may block growth of solid tumors and interfere with development of resistance.
  Didymin inhibits MYCN through Raf-dependent and -independent mechanisms by inhibiting
  CDE through RKIP, GRK, PKC, and the Let-7 micro-RNA.
