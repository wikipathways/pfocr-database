caption: A representation of a typical eukaryotic cell division cycle. The four major
  phases of the cell division cycle, G1 (gap) phase, S (synthesis) phase, G2 and M
  (mitosis) phases, are shown. Different cyclins and CDKs function during specific
  cell cycle phases to drive phase-specific events. Highlighted in the figure are
  the key processes of the secretory pathway that are inhibited during M phase (see
  text for details).
