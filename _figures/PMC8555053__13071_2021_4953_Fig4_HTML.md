caption: 'Schematic overview of the dauer signalling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans
  consisting of the cGMP signalling pathway, the parallel TGF-β and insulin/IGF-1
  pathways, and the concluding DA biosynthetic pathway. The colour scale indicates
  how conserved each gene is across parasitic nematodes: blue is not conserved, yellow
  towards red indicates that a gene is less or more conserved. This figure was redrawn
  from references [, ]'
