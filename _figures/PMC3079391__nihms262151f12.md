caption: Simplified catalytic cycle of SO and SDH. Stage 1 corresponds to the resting
  state of the enzyme. The pathway 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 corresponds to the normal catalytic
  turnover. Depending on buffer pH, stage 3 corresponds to the hpH or lpH form of
  the active center. Stages 3A and 3B (typically observed at pH < 7) are the two debated
  alternatives which correspond to the blocked form of the active center. In wt vertebrate
  SO, the blocked form is generated in chloride-depleted samples at low pH. Addition
  of chloride results in hydrolysis of the sulfur-containing ligand (transition 3A
  → 3 or 3B → 3).
