caption: Cell cycle arrest by CDKN2A. The CDKN2A gene encodes two alternatively spliced
  transcripts, p16INK4A and p14ARF, which differ in their first exon. The p16INK4A
  protein inhibits the CDK4/6-cyclin D1 complexes, keeping the retinoblastoma (Rb)
  proteins in a dephosphorylated state, and enables binding and inactivating the E2F
  transcription factors. Free E2F ensures the transcription of various proteins, most
  of them are necessary for progression to S phase. P16INK4A is also upregulated by
  E2F. In contrast, p14ARF stabilizes and thus activates the tumor suppressor gene
  p53 by inhibiting MDM2, which inactivates p53 by ubiquitin-mediated degradation.
  Active p53 induces the expression of p21, a negative cell cycle regulator which
  is an inhibitor of the CDK1-cyclin A/B complexes, thereby preventing the progression
  from G2 phase to metaphase. The human papillomavirus oncoproteins E6 and E7 interfere
  in the Rb pathway and in the p53 pathway, in order to bypass the cell cycle checkpoints.
  The E7 oncoprotein promotes the progression to S phase. It binds the Rb proteins
  and thereby releases the E2F transcription factors. The E6 protein targets p53 and
  induces loss of function by degradation.
