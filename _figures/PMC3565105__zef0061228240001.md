caption: 'Hypothetical model illustrates the E2-ERα signaling pathway involving both
  genomic and extranuclear signaling pathways. Extranuclear signaling of E2/ERα: Several
  signaling proteins like PI3K, Src, HPIP, MTA1s, etc., interact with ERα in the cytoplasm
  to activate E2 extranuclear signaling. Rapid E2 signaling promotes interaction of
  ERα with caveolin-1 in the caveoli and activates the PI3K/AKT pathway. Sequestration
  of ERα by HPIP in the cytoplasm through a microtubule scaffolding mechanism facilitates
  PI3K/Src recruitment, and activation of AKT/MAPK pathways occurs in response to
  rapid E2 signaling. MTA1s also activate E2 rapid signaling through cytoplasmic sequestration
  of the receptor. In response to rapid E2/ERα signaling, PELP1 could activate AKT
  and MAPK pathways by interaction with PI3K and Src kinase, respectively. Activation
  of downstream signaling kinases such as AKT, MAPK, PAK1, etc., by growth factor
  signaling led to phosphorylation of ERα, which could further impact its nuclear
  activity. Phosphorylation of ERα by GSK3 also enhances ERα transcriptional activity.
  Methylation of ERα at arginine 260 by PRMT1 involves activation of FAK signaling
  in response to E2 rapid signaling. Genomic signaling of E2/ERα: Ligand binding to
  ERα ensures heat shock protein (HSP) dissociation and the receptor''s nuclear entry.
  Upon nuclear translocation, ligand-bound receptor binds to its target genes to activate
  the transcription. If the HDAC complex is recruited to ERα chromatin, ERα-dependent
  transcription is repressed, whereas HAT complex recruitment activates ERα-dependent
  transcription. This model also illustrates that ERα can regulate the gene expression
  by extensive chromatin looping to bring genes together for coordinated transcriptional
  regulation. PM, Plasma membrane; NM, nuclear membrane; P, phosphorylation; M, methylation;
