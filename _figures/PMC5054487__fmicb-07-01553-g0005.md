caption: 'Tryptophan biosynthetic pathway in two different endosymbiont-host systems.
  Most Buchnera strains can synthesize tryptophan from chorismate derived from central
  metabolites. The first step is catalyzed by anthranilate synthase, encoded in the
  trpEG genes, then, anthranilate is converted into tryptophan by four additional
  enzymatic steps, encoded in the trpDCBA operon. In panel (A) the structure of the
  pathway in the system B. aphidicola and the aphid A. pisum is presented. Feedback
  inhibition of tryptophan on anthranilate synthase is present. (B) In the aphid C.
  cedri, the primary (B. aphidicola BCc) and the co-primary (S. symbiotica SCc) endosymbionts
  share the production of tryptophan: trpEG genes are only present in Buchnera, while
  the trpDCBA genes only in Serratia.'
