caption: Cend1 induces the p53-Cyclin D1-pRb signaling pathway resulting in cell cycle
  arrest at the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle. Cend1 triggers p53 and its downstream
  effector p21, leading to pRb hypophosphorylation and withdrawal from the cell cycle
  at the G1/G0 transition, while interfering with Cyclin D1 signaling.
