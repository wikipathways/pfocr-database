caption: The fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in E. coli. There are 14 targeted proteins
  in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in E. coli. Acetyl-CoA is first converted
  to malonyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AccABCD). Subsequently,
  malonyl-CoA is transformed to ACP by FabD. Enzymes FabH/B/F/G/A/Z/I catalyze subsequent
  steps. After six additional elongation cycles, the fatty acid chain is released
  by TesA’.
