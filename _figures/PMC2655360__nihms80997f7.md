caption: (A) Pathway maps generated using GenMapp depicting increased glycolytic protein
  expression in differentiated intestinal epithelial cells relative to crypt cells.
  The intensity of red indicates the extent to which protein expression is elevated
  in the villus fraction. (B) Corresponding mRNA levels of glycolytic genes are upregulated
  in the villus fraction in mouse small intestine (n=4 mice). Red asterix indicates
  statistical significance (P<0.05) as assessed using a paired t-test. (C) Increased
  glycolytic gene expression following butyrate induced differentiation of Caco-2
  colon cancer cells. Caco-2 cells were treated with 5 mM butyrate for 72 hours and
  changes in gene expression determined using 27,000 feature cDNA microarrays. For
  B and C, the intensity of red indicates the extent to which gene expression is elevated
  in the villus fraction, as indicated in the figure legend.
