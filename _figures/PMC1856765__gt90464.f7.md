caption: 'Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) appears in two forms: soluble TNF (sTNF) is
  shed from the cell surface on enzymatic cleavage of the membrane‐bound form (mTNF).
  sTNF has a high affinity for the TNF receptor (TNFR)1 and induces pro‐apoptotic
  signals on ligation. TNFR1 assembles a death‐inducing signal complex (DISC) similar
  to that of FAS/CD95 and exerts its effect via activation of caspases. On the other
  hand, mTNF has a high affinity for TNFR2 that rather induces antiapoptotic signals
  via activation of the nuclear factor (NF)κβ pathway and the mitogen‐activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) cascade. NFκβ might also exert an antiapoptotic function via inhibition
  of the FAS‐associated death domain (FADD) and formation of the DISC. In some cells,
  NFκβ up regulates the FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP). Some data also suggest that
  NFκβ is induced by TNFR1, resulting in a complex cross‐talk of both TNF receptors.
  MAPKs such as extracellular signal‐regulated kinase1/2, c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase
  and p38 can activate transcription factor targets (c‐Jun, ATF2), turning on genes
  that regulate growth and apoptosis. These factors also contribute to initiation
  of transcription of pro‐inflammatory and antiapoptotic cytokines such as interleukin
  (IL)6 and TNF. CNI‐1493 is a composite that inhibits phosphorylation and activation
  of several MAPKs. A different mechanism is shown in cell 2: infliximab might induce
  reverse signalling on binding to mTNF. In turn, activation of pro‐apoptotic pathways
  including activation of upstream caspases and the mitochondrial pathway via BAX
  induces apoptosis of T cells and monocytes.'
