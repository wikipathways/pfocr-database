caption: PERK signaling under virus attack. Upon ER stress such as virus infection,
  protein kinase PERK oligomerizes in the ER membrane and is activated via trans-autophosphorylation.
  The activated PERK phosphorylates a subunit of eIF2, which inhibits the exchange
  factor eIF2B from recycling eIF2 to its active GTP-bound form. In addition, dsRNA-activated
  protein kinase R (PKR) can also activate this pathway independently of PERK. The
  resulting reduced activities of eIF2B and the eIF2 complex account for all of the
  important consequences of PERK activity, such as translation inhibition of most
  mRNAs, which reduces protein synthesis and lowers ER loading. However, some mRNA
  such as ATF4 gains a selective advantage for translation via phosphorylated eIF2.
  ATF4 in turn contributes to the transcriptional activation of CHOP, XBP1, GADD34,
  and other genes involved oxidative stress and cell death. GADD34 is a regulatory
  subunit of protein phosphatase (PP) 1 that dephosphorylates eIF2α and recovers the
  activity of eIF2, constituting a negative feedback loop for regulation of PERK signaling.
  A constitutive phosphatase CreP also promotes eIF2 dephosphorylation. Viruses such
  as CMV may directly exploit the negative loop to terminate the PERK signaling pathway,
  via increasing the expression of ATF4, because the prolonged closure of protein
  synthesis is harmful to virus infection. Some viruses, such as HSV1 and ASFV, may
  produce a viral factor, which is homologous to host GADD34, to restore the activity
  of eIF2 along with PP1. Other viruses such as HCV may encode a viral protein that
  binds to PERK as a pseudosubstrate and thus, inhibits PERK activation. Finally,
  viruses such as LCMV may selectively activate the branches of the UPR to favor their
  replication. At present, no PERK-like pathway has been found in plants.
