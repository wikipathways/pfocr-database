caption: hFSSC secretome reduced liver fibrosis by regulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling
  pathway. hFSSC secretome inhibited TGF-β1expression and activated Smad7 expression
  which are activated by the binding of the TGF-β super family to the cell surface
  receptors. TGF-β1-mediated tissue fibrosis via Smad2/Smad3 which the two major downstream
  regulator, while Smad7 serves as a negative feedback regulator of TGF-β1/Smad pathway,
  thereby protecting against TGF-β1-mediated fibrosis. Furthermore, hFSSC secretome
  decreased the collagen I expression, thereby reducing liver fibrosis
