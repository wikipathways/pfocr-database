caption: GcvB posttranscriptionally regulates multiple amino acid transport and biosynthetic
  pathways. GcvB targets regulated by either R1, R3, or both are indicated in green,
  red, or purple font, respectively. In the metabolic pathway map, black arrows represent
  the reaction steps that are posttranscriptionally regulated by GcvB. Thick arrows
  represent the GcvB‐regulated transporters for amino acids and dipeptides, some of
  which adopt multiple substrates, for example, ArgT for Arg/Lys/Orn, CycA for Gly/Ala/β‐Ala/d‐Ala/d‐Ser/cycloserine,
  and GltI and GltP for Glu/Asp (Table )
