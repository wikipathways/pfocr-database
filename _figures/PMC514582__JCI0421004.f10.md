caption: Schematic of Nef signaling pathways and their relationship with Nef’s biologic
  effects in podocytes. Nef activates both Stat3 and MAPK1,2 pathways via an Src-dependent
  pathway. Src activation is essential for Nef-induced podocyte proliferation and
  dedifferentiation. Stat3 and MAPK1,2 mediate these Nef effects in an additive manner.
  Other downstream signaling of Nef-Src interaction may also be important.
