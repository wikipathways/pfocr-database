caption: 'Some metabolic pathways and pathways implicated in virulence and repair
  mechanisms induced in vivo compared to in vitro cultivation. The pathways were drawn
  according to KEGG database. Circles next to each gene display its regulation for
  each condition. a–i represent significantly up-regulated KEGG pathways under in
  vivo conditions: a Cardiolipin synthesis, b Mevalonate pathway, c Tryptophan synthesis,
  d Biotin synthesis, e Thiamine synthesis, f Fatty acid degradation, g Base excision
  repair, h Nucleotide excision repair, and i LPS synthesis. Reactivity of in vivo
  vs cell and cell-free cultures are always the same (except cbu0608, due to induction
  of mevalonate pathway in cell culture similar to in vivo, relative to cell-free
  culture system)'
