caption: Schematic representation of mechanisms of resistance due to MET/HGF pathway
  and potential interventional strategies. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage DNA
  which in-turn increases nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) mediated increased expression
  of HGF and MET. MET [I] and/or HGF [II] over-expression are major mechanisms of
  resistance due to MET/HGF axis against contemporary therapies. VEGF inhibition can
  cause hypoxia and increased hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-α) mediated HGF
  and MET expression. Rarely, mutations in the kinase domain [III] can cause constitutional
  activation of MET signaling and contribute to increased resistance. In gefitinib,
  erlotinib, cetuximab and bevacizumab resistant tumors, MET/HGF activates oncogenic
  signaling via Mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway, the Phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase (PI3K-AKT) pathway and the Phospholipase-Cγ (PLC-γ) pathway. The MET/HGF
  inhibition by HGF antagonists [A], anti-MET antibody [B] or small molecule receptor
  tyrosine kinase inhibitor (SmRTKI) [C] can help overcome resistance.
