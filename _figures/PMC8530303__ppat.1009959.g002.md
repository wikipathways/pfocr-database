caption: Glycolysis, Stickland fermentation, TCA cycle, Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, and
  SCFA synthesis are underlined and presented in a simplified version for clarity;
  adapted from []. Selected precursors, intermediates, and end products of these pathways
  are labeled with the major precursors and intermediates relevant for SCFA-centric
  metabolism in C. difficile. Pathways resulting in net generation of NADH (red),
  NAD (blue), or ATP (green) are indicated. SCFA, short chain fatty acid; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid.
