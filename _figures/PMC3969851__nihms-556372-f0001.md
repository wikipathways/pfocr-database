caption: (a) Phenazines affect morphogenesis of P. aeruginosa PA14 colony biofilms,.
  Phenazine producing strain = BigBlue, phenazine-null strain = Δphz (See ). Colony
  biofilms are imaged after three days of development. Scale bar = 1 cm. (b) Phenazine
  biosynthetic pathway in P. aeruginosa. Arrows are labeled with the enzymes catalyzing
  the various conversion reactions. PCA=phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, PCN=phenazine-1-carboxamide,
  PYO=pyocyanin, 5-MCA=5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid (c) Phenazine redox reactions,
  with redox potentials shown for pH=7.
