caption: The necroptosis signaling pathway. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–α binds to
  TNFR1 to form the TNF receptor–associated death domain (TRADD) complex, which recruits
  downstream molecules leading to the assembly of complex I. Thereafter, complex I
  triggers necroptosis by regulating RIPK1. The presence of necroptosis inhibitor
  Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) or apoptosis inhibitor zVAD-FMK in thyroid cancer cells can
  enhance the effect of necroptosis. This effect can improve the therapeutic efficacy
  of iodine-131 in advanced thyroid cancer
