caption: PPI network and Path-Act-Network analyses. (A) The online Search Tool for
  the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (version 11.0) was used to construct
  the PPI network. Each node represents all proteins produced by a single protein-coding
  gene locus. Coloured nodes represent differentially expressed genes and the first
  shell of interactors. Edges represent protein-protein associations. (B) Top 10 hub
  genes identified using the cytoHubba plugin app of Cytoscape using the degree calculation
  method. The redder the node color, the higher the ranking. (C) Path-Act-Network
  analysis showing the upstream and downstream associations of significant signaling
  pathways. Red represents pathways that are significant only for upregulated genes,
  while green represents pathways that are significant only for downregulated genes.
  PPI, protein-protein interaction.
