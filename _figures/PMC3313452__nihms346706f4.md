caption: (A) Under normal conditions, de novo synthesized NIK is immediately bound
  by TRAF3 and recruited to the TRAF-cIAP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex via TRAF3-TRAF2
  dimerization. cIAP1/2 catalyzes K48 ubiquitination of NIK, targeting NIK for degradation
  in the proteasome. The continuous degradation of NIK prevents NIK accumulation or
  activation of noncanonical NF-κB signaling. (B) Ligand engagement of the noncanonical
  NF-κB-stimulatory receptors induces recruitment of the TRAF-cIAP E3 components to
  the receptor complex. Probably due to its aggregation, TRAF2 becomes activated and
  mediates K63 ubiquitination of cIAP1/2, a modification that stimulates the K48-specific
  E3 activity of cIAP1/2. cIAP1/2 then conjugates K48 polyubiquitin chains to TRAF3,
  resulting in TRAF3 degradation. In the absence of TRAF3, the de novo synthesized
  NIK is stabilized and accumulated to higher levels; this allows NIK to induce IKKα-dependent
  p100 phosphorylation and ubiquitination, leading to the nuclear translocation of
  the generated RelB/p52 heterodimer.
