caption: DNA damage-mediated activation of ATM signaling pathways. (A) The DNA damage
  repair mechanism includes sensors, transducers, and effectors. Sensors, such as
  the MRN complex, recognize the DNA structure modifications induced by DNA DSBs.
  Transducers are ATM (and ATR involved in HRR) PI3K involved in phosphorylation of
  many effector proteins that control cell cycle progression (CHK1 and CHK2), DNA
  repair (via, for instance, NHEJ mechanisms), and apoptosis. The intrinsic apoptotic
  signaling pathway relies on p53 stabilization, followed by PUMA transcription and
  BAX activation. MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity plays a central role in keeping a
  low p53 concentration in non-ATM-activated cells. On ATM activation, MDM2 ubiquitin
  ligase activity is inhibited and p53 stabilized. PUMA frees the proapoptotic BAX/BAK
  proteins (members of the BCL2-family) that can transfer to mitochondria where they
  promote cytochrome C, AIF, and SMAC release and further activation of caspases.
  In the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, death receptor (TNF-R, TRAIL-R, and
  FAS) activation leads to BID cleavage by caspase 8 and further release of cytochrome
  C. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of H2AX triggers recruitment of MDC1, which in turn
  recruits more MRN complexes and activated ATM to the damaged chromatin. This promotes
  H2AX phosphorylation and spreads ATM and H2AX phosphorylation over a large chromatin
  domain. (B) ATM structure. ATM is a 350 kDa protein (3056 amino acids) and a member
  of the PIKK family. It includes HEAT repeats, FAT, PI3K, and FATC domains. The HEAT
  repeats allow NBS1 binding. Post-translational modifications include autophosphorylation
  (at Ser 1981, Ser 367, Ser 1893, Ser 2996) and TIP 60 acetylation at Lys 3016 (,
  , , ). 53BP1, p53-binding protein 1; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia
  mutated; ATR, ATM- and Rad3-related; BID, BH3 interacting-domain death agonist;

  2; FAT, FRAP-ATM-TRRAP; FATC, FAT C-terminal; HEAT, Huntington-elongation factor
  3-protein phosphatase 2A-TOR1; HRR, homologous recombination repair; MDC1, mediator
