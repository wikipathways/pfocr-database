caption: The phospho-MEK1/ERK1/2/p90 RSK signaling pathway was activated in the spiral
  ligament and in the sensory and supporting cells of the organ of Corti, with peaks
  at 3–6 h and independently of de novo synthesis of the protein kinases. The expression
  of phospho-JNK and p38 MAPK showed late upregulation in the spiral neurons at 48
  h, in addition to early upregulation with peaks at 3 h after the noise trauma. Phospho-p38
  MAPK and c-Jun activation was dependent on de novo synthesis of the proteins.
