caption: Mechanisms of ductal bile modification. According to a widely accepted model,
  secretin induces HCO3−-rich fluid secretion from cholangiocytes via the cyclic adenosine
  3′,5′-monophosphate-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) signaling pathway by activation
  of the apical cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl−channel
  resulting in extrusion of Cl− ions, which in turn stimulate the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger
  AE2 and subsequent secretion of HCO3−. Secreted HCO3− ions drive passive aquaporin
  1 (AQP1)-mediated movement of water in response to established osmotic gradients.
  An alternative mechanism of Cl– efflux is also shown, consisting of acetylcholine
  (ACh) binding to basolateral M3 muscarinic receptors, which leads to increases in
  inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which binds to (types I and II) IP3Rs, causing release
  of Ca2+ and activation of apical Cl− secretion. AC, adenylate cyclase; Gs, Gs protein;
  PKA, protein kinase A; SR, secretin receptor. [Adapted from Masyuk et al. (), with
