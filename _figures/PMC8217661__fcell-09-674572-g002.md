caption: The role of WASp in signal transduction in T cells. TCR ligation with pMHC
  triggers signal transduction within the cytoplasm of T cells. Once phosphorylated
  by ZAP-70, phospho-LAT recruits proteins to form the LAT/SLP-76 signalosome containing
  Nck and Vav. Vav activates the Rho GTPase Cdc42, which in turn interacts with WASp.
  This complex is recruited to the signalosome via Nck. In association with GTP-Cdc42,
  WASp is released from the auto-inhibited conformation and then initiates the ARP2/3-dependent
  F-actin polymerization. In Ras/Rac-MAPK pathway, WASp is essential for the translocation
  of phospho-Erk1/2 into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, phospho-Erk1/2 phosphorylates
  Elk1, which then causes c-fos expression, a component of transcription factor AP-1.
  WASp was not required for the activation of Jnk, a kinase causing c-jun expression
  that is the second component of AP-1. In the PKC pathway, WASp contributes to PKCθ
  activation in response to low doses of antigen. Activated PKCθ is required for activation
  of transcription factor NF-κB and its nuclear translocation. For Ca2+-mediated signaling,
  WASp is indispensable for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, which is essential for
  NFAT translocation to the nucleus. In the squared box, two alternative pathways
  of WASp recruitment to TCR are shown. Firstly, WASp is constitutively associated
  with Nck and Nck-WASp is recruited to the TCR upon TCR ligation. Secondly, preformed
  CrkL-WIP-WASp is recruited to ZAP-70 following T cell activation. We propose that
  these two recent identified pools of WASp play a role in controlling actin polymerization
  and may contribute to the nuclear translocation of phospho-Erk1/2, PKCθ-mediated
  NF-κB activation and Ca2+ influx.
