caption: CAMs can activate neurite outgrowth through different mechanisms. The two
  subsets represent a neuroblast, surrounded by other neurons, undergoing neurite
  outgrowth. (A) Mechanical activation of neurite outgrowth by CAMs through cytoskeleton
  remodeling, which is necessary for membrane protrusion. N‐cadherin (N‐cdh) is activated
  by trans‐homophilic interaction, and can therefore bind β‐catenin and p120 catenin.
  N‐cadherin is bifunctional because of its growth‐promoting action through β‐catenin
  and activation of microtubule assembly, and growth‐inhibiting action through p120
  and inhibition of actin assembly. The mode of activation of teneurins, L1, and NCAM
  is still unknown, but they all foster cytoskeleton remodeling through their intracellular
  partners. (B) Genetic activation of neurite outgrowth by CAMs. L1, Celsr2, and Celsr3
  activate the MAPK pathway, CAMKII, and calcineurin, respectively, to modulate gene
  expression. Celsr2 and Celsr3 are activated by trans‐homophilic interaction, but
  how integrin‐binding to L1 is induced is still unclear. The cytosolic cofactor TAF1
  of Pcdh7 (NF‐protocadherin) might translocate into the nucleus to activate growth
  in response to an unknown signal. The ICDs of teneurins and NCAM are cleaved and
  might modulate transcriptional activity in the nucleus. The signal of cleavage is
  only known for NCAM and corresponds to its trans‐binding.
