caption: Mechanisms of LINC00346 in glioma. LINC00346 upregulates SZRD1 levels by
  sponging miR-128-3p in glioma. LINC00346 modulates cell proliferation and apoptosis
  by regulating miR-128-3p/SZRD1. LINC00346 also functions as a ceRNA of miR-340-5p
  to reduce the expression level of ROCK1 in glioma. The expression level of LINC00346
  is positively regulated by ankyrin repeat and KH domain-containing protein 1 (ANKHD1).
  Angiogenesis associated with glioma-associated endothelial cells (GECs) is facilitated
  by the ANKHD1/LINC00346/znf655 pathway.
