caption: Overview of the methanogenic pathway in M. thermophilus based on gene content
  and Hdr activity. H2 or formate can act as an electron donor for growth. The core
  methanogenic pathway is shown in boldface font. H2 can be generated from formate
  or formate can be generated from H2 via a reversible formate hydrogenlyase activity.
  H2 is essential for energy-converting hydrogenase (Eha/Ech)-dependent ferredoxin
  reduction and formate is essential for heterodisulfide reduction. Either H2 or formate
  can act as an electron donor for F420 reduction, via Frh or Fdh, respectively. The
  CH3-H4MPT:CoM methyltransferase translocates Na+ across the cell membrane. The resulting
  Na+ gradient is used to drive ATP synthesis via ATP synthase. CH3-H4MPT and CO2
  are substrates for synthesis of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) with Fdred required
  as an electron donor.
