caption: 'Alcohol’s effects on fibrogenic pathways in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).
  HSCs are quiescent liver cells that, on stimulation by pro-inflammatory proteins
  and other agents, differentiate into myofibroblasts to repair damaged tissues. Excessive
  alcohol consumption increases the permeability of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
  exposing HSCs to endotoxin (i.e., lipopolysaccharide [LPS]). LPS is bound by LPS-binding
  protein (LBP), enabling engagement with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) and activating
  the myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD88)-dependent pathway. MyD88 signaling
  decreases expression of BMP and activin membrane–bound inhibitor (BAMBI), a pseudoreceptor
  that suppresses responses to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β; secreted by activated
  Kupffer cells). Thus, alcohol-induced TLR4–MyD88 signaling increases the HSCs’ responsiveness
  to TGF-β. microRNA 29 (miR-29) inhibits the production of extracellular matrix (ECM),
  and its downregulation by MyD88 signaling therefore increases ECM deposition. TLR4–MyD88
  signaling in HSCs—along with complement 5a and exposure to the alcohol-breakdown
  product acetaldehyde and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and tumor necrosis
  factor α (TNFα) secreted from activated Kupffer cells—upregulates the expression
  of various chemokines (i.e., monocyte chemotactic protein [MCP-1], macrophage inflammatory
  protein 1 [MIP-1], and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted
  [RANTES]). These chemokines recruit macrophages (i.e., Kupffer cells and scar-associated
  macrophages) and other immune cells to the site where HSCs reside (i.e., the liver
  perisinusoidal space or space of Disse). These signals spur the differentiation
  of HSCs into myelofibroblasts that produce and secrete ECM, leading to liver fibrosis.
  In addition, Kupffer cell–produced ROS inhibit activities of metalloproteinases,
  which normally degrade ECM and thus inhibit fibrosis.NOTES: C5aR = C5a receptor;
  CD14 = cluster of differentiation 14 protein; MD-2 = myeloid differentiation 2 protein;
  TNFαR = TNFα receptor.'
