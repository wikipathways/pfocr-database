caption: Separate pathways regulate synapse-specific and electrical activity-dependent
  transcription. NRG, which is present in the synaptic basal lamina, activates ErbB
  receptors in the postsynaptic membrane and leads to activation of a Ras signaling
  pathway. Our experiments sugest that this pathway leads to activation of GABPα/GABPβ
  and an increase in AChR gene expression selectively in synaptic nuclei. The pathway
  activated by electrical activity is thought to result in a decrease in the activity
  and/or abundance of transcriptional activators that bind E-boxes, such as myogenin
  and E12, leading to a decrease in AChR gene expression in nuclei throughout the
  muscle fiber.
