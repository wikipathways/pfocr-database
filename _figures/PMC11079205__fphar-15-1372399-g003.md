caption: Mechanisms of GLP-1 effects on bone. In MSCs and osteoblasts, GLP-1 activates
  intracellular signaling pathways by binding to its receptors. After GLP-1R is activated,
  it stimulates adenylate cyclase to convert ATP into cAMP and then activates downstream
  PKA signals. Then, PKA continues to increase the phosphorylation of ERK, P38, JNK,
  and β-catenin, causing them to enter the nucleus to stimulate the expression of
  osteogenesis-related genes and promote bone formation. In osteoclasts, when GLP-1
  binds to GLP-1R, it inhibits the activity of the intracellular MAPK pathway and
  NF-κB pathway. The former downregulates the transcription of c-Fos to inhibit osteoclast
  formation, while the latter downregulates the expression of downstream osteoclast
  marker genes mediated by NFATc1 and NFATc1 to inhibit bone resorption. In addition,
  GLP-1 directly inhibits the activity of RANKL, thus inhibiting the activity of the
  NF-κB pathway. OPG and RANKL secreted by osteoblasts and osteoclasts are important
  signaling pathways that mediate the balance between bone resorption and bone formation,
  and a proper state of balance is conducive to maintaining bone homeostasis
