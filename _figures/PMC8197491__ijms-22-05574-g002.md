caption: Oncometabolites epigenetic and pseudohypoxia effects. Oncometabolites act
  as competitive inhibitors of αKG-dependent dioxygenases (αKGDDs) such as the KDMs
  and TETs families responsible for the modulation of chromatin by demethylation of
  histones and DNA CpG islands, respectively. The inhibition of PHDs blocks the HIF
  proline hydroxylation for the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation leading to HIF stabilization
  and activation of the hypoxia signalling pathway establishing a pseudo-hypoxic phenotype.
  KDMs, lysine histone demethylases; TETs, ten-eleven translocation; K, lysine; C,
  cytosine; P, proline; PHDs, prolyl hydroxylases; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor;
  Ub, ubiquitin.
