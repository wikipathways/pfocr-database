caption: The interaction of the EG F and TGF-β pathways in the control of proliferation
  in breast cancer. In normal ECs these pathways are balanced so as to control growth,
  but in TECs increased secretion of TGF-β induces fibroblasts and myofibroblasts
  to secrete more EGF. This disrupts the prolifération-inhibition mechanism by partially
  blocking the TGF-β-Smad pathway and triggers proliferation. From [], with permission.
