caption: Schematic diagram illustrating lipid droplet formation, VLDL secretion, and
  pathways involving hepatic inflammation. For lipid droplet formation, phospholipids
  and triglycerides synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) form naïve lipid
  droplets. Hepatic ablation of Plin2 decreases lipid droplet size and number. The
  MCD diet induces lipid accumulation, resulting in increased lipid droplet size,
  an effect blunted in L-KO mice. For Plin2-null lipid droplets, lack of Plin2 results
  in formation of smaller lipid droplets and production of MTTP-rich microsomes that
  are precursors of pre-VLDL and VLDL particles (, ). For VLDL secretion, partially
  lipidated ApoB100-containing microsomes constitute naive VLDL particles in the ER.
  MTTP transfers triglycerides and phospholipids to the nascent VLDL to form pre-VLDL
  that are stabilized by ApoE. The MCD diet inhibited PC synthesis in WT mice, leading
  to decreased levels of VLDL and increased hepatic steatosis. For lipid droplet expansion,
  CCT translocates to the lipid droplet surface and begins production of PC to expand
  the lipid monolayer (). The lack of choline in the MCD diet favors PC synthesis
  via the PEMT pathway over CCT-mediated production. Plin2 may block lipase activity
  of HSL and ATGL (). For hepatic inflammation, NLRP3 inflammasomes mediate caspase-1
  activation of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. PERK, an ER stress marker, induces
  increased expression of CHOP, which then upregulates pro-caspase-1, which is cleaved
  by NLRP3 (, ) to generate the active form, caspase-1. Several proinflammatory markers
  target lipid droplets including COX2 and prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) (, , ).
  L-KO mice fed the MCD diet exhibit decreased expression of CHOP, resulting in decreased
  activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β.
