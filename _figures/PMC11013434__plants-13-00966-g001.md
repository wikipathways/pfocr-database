caption: Proposed biosynthesis of MIAs and MOAs in H. patens (Modified from []). TDC—tryptophan
  decarboxylase (green), LAMT—loganic acid methyltransferase (red), SLS—secologanin
  synthase (grey—not evaluated in this work), STR—strictosidine synthase (light blue),
  NPF2.9—nitrate/peptide family strictosidine transporter (yellow), SGD—strictosidine
  β-glucosidase (purple), THAS1 and THAS2—tetrahydroalstonine synthase 1 and 2 (blue).
  CYP71-P450—CYP71 family spirooxindole synthases involved in MIA conversion to an
  MOA []. The biosynthetic steps from shikimate pathway and iridoids pathway to tetrahydroalstonine
  are based on C. roseus MIA biosynthesis.
