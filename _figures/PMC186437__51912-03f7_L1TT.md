caption: Two-step proteolytic processing of RseA. RseA first receives a cleavage by
  DegS on the periplasmic side, which somehow triggers the second cleavage by YaeL
  on the cytoplasmic side or within the membrane. The end result will be elimination
  of RseA and release of active ﾏウ.
papertitle: YaeL (EcfE) activates the ﾏウ pathway of stress response through a site-2
  cleavage of anti-ﾏウ, RseA.
