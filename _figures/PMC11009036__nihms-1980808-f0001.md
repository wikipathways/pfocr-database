caption: a | The two broad functions of the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway.
  b | Simplified view of the molecular mechanism of NMD in mammals. Up-frameshift
  1 (UPF1) is an RNA helicase recruited to all mRNAs that remains stably bound only
  to NMD target mRNAs by an unknown mechanism; thus, high UPF1 occupancy is regarded
  as a reliable feature of NMD target mRNAs. UPF1 also binds to UPF2, which triggers
  the former to undergo a conformational change that activates its RNA-helicase activity.
  UPF2 also binds to UPF3B, which, in turn, interacts with the exon-junction complex
  (EJC), a set of proteins (consisting of eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  4A-III (eIF4A3), Y14 (also known as RBM8A) and MAGOH) that bind near exon–exon junctions
  in RNAs after they are spliced in the nucleus. EJC-bound RNAs are then transported
  to the cytoplasm, where accessory proteins, including the EJC protein MLN51 (also
  known as CASC3) are recruited. The formation of an EJC-core NMD factor complex triggers
  RNA decay, but other mechanisms can also elicit NMD (see ). During this chain of
  events, the protein kinase SMG1 phosphorylates UPF1, which is thought to commit
  an mRNA to degradation, since phosphorylated UPF1 binds to the RNA endonuclease
  SMG6, which is known to cleave NMD target mRNAs. Phosphorylated UPF1 also recruits
  the SMG5–SMG7 heterodimer, which interacts with decapping and deadenylating enzymes
  to further foster RNA decay. NMD is regulated by many factors, including eIF2α phosphorylation
  during cellular stress, microRNAs and specific regulatory proteins (not shown),,.
