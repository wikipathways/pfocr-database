caption: 'Proximity of Bcl-xl to p38, MK2, and RTN4 in platelet function. A: signaling
  and protein binding relations in the neighborhood vicinity of MK2 and RTN4 in Pathway
  Commons, as queried and rendered by ChiBE. Directed relations (arrows) indicate
  that the source protein controls a state change of the target protein. A state change
  can be a modification on the protein, on its location, or a change to the complex
  that the target protein is a member. Undirected edges (connecting lines) indicate
  that two proteins appear as members in the same complex. B: replicate samples (n
  = 3) of washed human platelets (1 × 109/ml, 1 ml) were incubated with DTBP cross-linker
  for 30 min at room temperature before lysis and processing for immunoprecipitation
  (IP). Following IP with RTN4 or control IgM antisera, samples were analyzed for
  RTN4 capture and Bcl-xl coimmunoprecipitation by Western blotting (WB). Tick marks
  indicate relative positions of 30- and 50-kDa molecular mass markers for Bcl-xl
  and RTN4, respectively. C: replicate samples (n = 3) of washed human platelets (5 × 108/ml)
  were pretreated with SB202190 (SB; 2 µM), PF3644022 (PF; 2 µM), or vehicle alone
  (veh.; 0.1% DMSO) before stimulation with thrombin (0.5 U/ml, 5 min). Following
  lysis into Laemmli sample buffer, samples were examined for Bcl-xl phospho-Ser62
  (p-Bcl-xl) immunoreactivity by Western blotting. Total Bcl-xl levels serve as a
  control for equal protein loading. Tick marks indicate relative positions of 30-kDa
  molecular mass marker.'
