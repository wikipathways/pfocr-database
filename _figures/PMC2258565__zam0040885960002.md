caption: (A) Vitamin B12biosynthetic pathway and genes involved in the first five
  steps of biosynthesis. (B) Gene cluster for vitamin B12 biosynthesis in F. succinogenes.
  The genes highlighted by boxes (A) or cross-hatched arrows (B) are those with low
  homology to their respective counterparts in F. intestinalis. The hemA gene (filled
  arrow) was not detected under low-stringency Southern blotting conditions.
