caption: Sugar metabolism pathways in MCF-7 and ZR75-1 cells profiled by GenMAPP.
  Common genes are denoted by an * and significant genes with a fold change of ≥5
  and ≤-5 were taken. Genes in the GO list were rearranged with the GenMAPP to depict
  the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways in (a) MCF-7, (b) ZR75-1 cells and the (c)
  pentose phosphate (hexose monophosphate shunt, HMS) pathway in ZR75-1 cells.
