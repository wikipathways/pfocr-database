caption: Putative sequence of pathogenic events in ANCA-mediated vasculitis. (Reproduced
  from Jennette and Falk.) Circulating neutrophils are primed for activation by ANCA
  by inflammatory cytokines or C5a derived from complement activation (note that monocytes
  can be similarly primed and activated but are not illustrated). Primed neutrophils
  release ANCA antigens at the cell surface and into the microenvironment, where they
  interact with ANCA. Fc receptor engagement by ANCA bound to ANCA antigens as well
  as F(ab′)2 binding to ANCA antigens on neutrophil surfaces cause neutrophil activation.
  ANCA-activated neutrophils release factors that activate the alternative complement
  pathway, generating C5a. C5a and ANCA create an inflammatory amplification loop,
  with C5a attracting and priming more neutrophils for activation by ANCA, which causes,
  in turn, further activation of the alternative complement pathway and production
  of more C5a. ANCA-activated neutrophils marginate and penetrate vessel walls and
  undergo respiratory burst, degranulation, NETosis, apoptosis, and necrosis. Disruption
  of endothelium allows plasma to spill into vascular and perivascular tissue where
  activation of the coagulation cascade produces the fibrin strands of fibroid necrosis.
  The innate inflammatory response orchestrates the conversion of the initial acute
  neutrophil-rich inflammation into mononuclear leukocyte-rich inflammation and subsequent
  collagen deposition and fibrosis. ANCA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody.
