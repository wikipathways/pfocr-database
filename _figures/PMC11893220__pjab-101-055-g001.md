caption: Chemical structures and biosynthetic pathway of mugineic acid and its derivatives
  in graminaceous plants (modified from Kobayashi et al. 2010).66) Key molecules referred
  in the main text are highlighted. Blue arrows and neighboring blue letters indicate
  the biosynthetic reactions and their corresponding enzymes, respectively. Currently,
  four other members of the mugineic acid family phytosiderophores have been identified
