caption: 'Multiple levels of regulation control stress-induced differentiation in
  Toxoplasma. The developmental transition from proliferating tachyzoites to encysted
  bradyzoites, which can be induced by cellular stress, is regulated by transcriptional
  (A) and post-transcriptional mechanisms (B). At least one response pathway that
  has been linked to stress-induced bradyzoite differentiation involves the eIF2 kinases,
  which lead to the phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to stress. In turn, this
  decreases general protein synthesis in favor of a select subset of mRNAs that may
  encode transcription factors (TF). Other post-transcriptional modes of regulation,
  such as RNA transport or splicing, may also be involved (not shown). While no transcription
  factor has been directly implicated in Toxoplasma developmental transitions, cis-elements
  have been identified in bradyzoite promoters (gray box). There is also evidence
  that epigenetic events, such as chromatin remodeling, are associated with gene expression
  changes that are required for bradyzoite differentiation. An example of histone
  acetylation (Ac), which activates gene expression, is shown (see ). It has yet to
  be determined if similar mechanisms of regulation occur in parasites that “spontaneously”
  differentiate, i.e. convert to bradyzoites without a stress application. TBP: TATA-binding
  protein.'
