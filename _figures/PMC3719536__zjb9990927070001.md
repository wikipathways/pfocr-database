caption: A working model proposed for bacterial biotin metabolism and its regulatory
  mechanism by BioR. (A) Schematic diagram for the bacterial biotin de novo biosynthetic
  pathway and its alternative scavenging route; (B) BioR represses biotin biosynthesis
  pathway in A. tumefaciens; (C) negative autoregulation of BioR and its repression
  of both the biotin biosynthesis pathway and biotin transport system in Brucella.
