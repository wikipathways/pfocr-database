  (Lpro, 2B, 3A, 3B, 3C) can directly or indirectly act on retinoic acid-induced gene

  of junction protein VISA at the transcriptional or protein level. Lpro, 2B and 3A
  can directly or indirectly target IRF3 to inhibit interferon production. 3C proteins
  inhibit JAK-STAT signaling pathway, thus inhibiting ISGs production. Lpro and 3C
  inhibit the synthesis of antiviral molecules by cutting related factors of host
  transcription and translation. Lpro protein can not only induce apoptosis, but also
  inhibit host cell apoptosis and promote virus replication, which is achieved by
  blocking the translation of α-IFN and inhibiting PKR synthesis. 2C can promote virus
  replication by regulating autophagy. eIF4G: eukaryotic initiation factor 4G; NF-κB:
