caption: Overview of the main mechanisms and signaling pathways of Apelin-13 in regulating
  Alzheimer’s disease. The pathogenesis of AD is complex and diverse, and its occurrence
  and development are closely related to many factors, such as increased apoptosis,
  enhanced autophagy, synaptic plasticity disorder, elevated level of neuroinflammation,
  increased oxidative stress, destruction of blood brain barrier (BBB), formation
  of cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and unesterified apolipoprotein E (APOE4).
  Apelin-13 plays an anti-AD role through the following mechanisms. 1. Apoptosis (1)
  Apelin-13 inhibits the production and aggregation of β-amyloid protein (Aβ), whereas
  Aβ induces apoptosis by regulating the Yes-related proteins-related protein (YAP)
  to increase the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and promote caspase-3 protein expression. (2) Apelin-13
  inhibits the cell apoptosis by promoting Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R)
  expression. (3) Apelin-13 enhances phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling
  pathway to inhibit neuronal apoptosis. (4) Apelin-13 reduces endoplasmic reticulum
  stress (ERS) by inhibiting inositol-requiring enzyme α (IRE-1α)/X-box binding protein
  1 (XBP1)/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  2 (eIF2)/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)/CHOP signaling pathways, thereby
  inhibiting cell apoptosis. 2. Autophagy Apelin-13 paly a both promoting and inhibiting
  roles in autophagy through activation of (AMP-activated protein kinase) AMPK/(mammalian
  target of rapamycin) mTOR/(UNC-51-like kinase 1) ULK1 signaling pathway and of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway. Apelin-13 exerts its anti-AD effects mainly through the inhibition
  of cellular autophagy, which inhibits the formation of immature autophagy follicles
  and produce of Aβ. 3. Synaptic plasticity (1) Apelin-13 activates soluble guanylate
  cyclase (sGC) and increases the level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) through
  endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) signal pathway then improves synaptic plasticity.
  (2) Normally, N-methyl d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) induce long term potentiation
  to improve synaptic plasticity. Apelin-13 inhibits oxidative stress induced by overactivated
  NMDAR, thereby reducing synaptic damage and improving synaptic plasticity. (3) Apelin-13
  increases dopaminergic receptor 1 (DR1) levels and promotes DA-induced LTP, thereby
  promoting synaptic plasticity. 4. Neuroinflammation (1) Apelin-13 exerts an anti-inflammatory
  role by promoting microglia polarization to M2 phenotype and inhibiting microglia
  polarization to M1 phenotype. (2) Apelin-13 reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced
  oxidative damage in mitochondria and inflammatory response induced by nucleotide-binding
  and oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3
  inflammasome activation. (3) Apelin-13 reduces ERS, thus inhibiting neuroinflammation.
  5. Oxidative stress (1) Apelin-13 inhibits NMDAR activity, sequentially inhibiting
  the production of ROS and reactive nitrogen species caused by excessive calcium
  ion influx. (2) Apelin-13 inhibits Aβ aggregation, which interacts with Fe2+ or
  Cu2+ to produce H2O2 which induces oxidative stress. (3) Apelin-13 induces the expression
  of antioxidant protein through AMPK/P-GSK-3β/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway or AMPK/thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 signal
  pathway, which relive oxidative stress-related cell damage. 6. BBB (1) Apelin-13
  promotes vascular endothelial cell proliferation. (2) Apelin-13 inhibits oxidative
  stress-mediated BBB damage. 7. CAA (1) Apelin-13 promotes endothelial nitric oxide
  (eNO) secretion by vascular endothelium, and thus enhances the ability of vascular
  transmembrane transport to Aβ, thereby promoting the clearance of Aβ and inhibiting
  CAA. (2) Apelin-13 has an inhibitory effect on CAA by inhibiting the increase of
  β and γ secretase activity mediated by oxidative stress. (3) Apelin-13 inhibits
  the angiotensin II signaling pathway, thereby decreasing the activity of β-site
  APP-cleaving enzyme 1/β-secretase and inhibiting the generation of amyloid precursor
  protein (APP), playing an inhibitory effect on CAA. (4) Apelin-13 promotes the internalization
  of APOE4 that reduces the level of Aβ in intertissue-fluid, thus inhibiting CAA.
  8. APOE4 Apelin-13 promotes the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1
  (ABCA1) protein, which facilitates cholesterol outflow to promote the lipidation
  of APOE, and thus enhances APOE4 internalization
