caption: 'Network of immune family expression similarities based on the VectorBase
  Expression Map. The network layout optimized with a spring model provides a 2D visualization
  of expression similarities for pairwise comparisons of all 36 immune-related gene
  families computed as gene co-occurrence scores across the VectorBase Expression
  Map (AgamP4.11 VB-2019-02). Families with more similar gene expression profiles
  are placed closer together in the graph. Significant co-occurrences are indicated
  with connecting lines: light blue <0.05, royal blue <0.01, and dark blue <0.005
  with line thickness scaled to the P value and co-occurrence scores indicated for
  all pairs with P<0.01. Family acronyms are defined in  and are colored according
  to categories defined based on their putative roles in the principal immune phases:
  classical recognition (red), other recognition (blue), pathway signaling (bright
  green), pathway modulation (purple), cascade modulation (orange), antimicrobial
  effectors (pink), effector enzymes (olive green), autophagy (dark cyan), RNAi (black),
  cytokines (brown), and toll receptors (dark green).'
