caption: Pathways surrounding transaldolase. (A) Metabolic map of wild type during
  growth on xylose. (B) Currently accepted metabolism of transaldolase-deficient mutant
  (Tal deletion) on xylose and pgi-Tal deletion on glucose. Only the metabolites within
  the red circle could be produced in Tal deletion on xylose. Reactions indicated
  by blue arrows are additionally possible in the pgi-Tal knockout on glucose. (C)
  A map indicating a possible bypass pathway through deoxyribonucleosides (reactions
  shown in blue). The directions of the reactions shown in red are fixed to the reverse
  of the wild-type direction when the bypass is the sole source of carbon flux from
  xylose. (D) Possible metabolism of the Tal-deletion strain on gluconate, using currently
  known reactions. The reactions shown in red are required if ED pathway and/or the
  bypass shown in panel C is the sole source of carbon flux. (E) Relative amounts
  (talAB/wild type) of metabolite (box) and mRNA (diamond) are shown on the metabolic
  map. (F) Flux distribution of the wild type and talAB mutant growing on xylose.
  The novel reactions and the transaldolase reaction are shown in red and blue, respectively.
  The relative flux of each reaction (with incorporation of xylose set to 100) is
  shown at the respective position (upper, wild type; lower, talAB). See  for detailed
  results.
