caption: Model for the effect of CRY on TIM. The light-induced conformation of CRY
  promotes TIM ubiquitination, perhaps through direct interaction with TIM. This conformation
  of CRY also signals to a degradation pathway through a DPI-sensitive electron transport
  mechanism. As a result, both CRY and TIM are degraded (although TIM degradation
  is not observed in S2 cells, light-induced TIM degradation in flies is CRY dependent
  [] [Fig. ]). We assume that, like other photoreceptors, CRY is eventually deactivated.
  Overexpression of CRY may favor its deactivation, resulting in decreased TIM ubiquitination
  in S2 cells and decreased degradation in flies (Fig. ). We suggest that the inactive
  CRY actively inhibits TIM ubiquitination, a mechanism by which CRY could also control
  TIM ubiquitination in the dark (see Discussion). FADH, reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide.
