caption: 'The molecular mechanisms of alcohol-related liver pathogenesis and therapeutic
  targets. Adapted from references[,,]. When alcohol intake is chronic and heavy,
  alcohol oxidation occurs via cytochrome P450s, resulting in increased levels of
  CYP2E1, which in turn causes oxidative stress through the generation of ROS which
  are responsible for lipid peroxidation and alcoholic liver injury. ROS also negatively
  regulates the activation AMPK and leads to overexpression of SREBP-1, resulting
  in an increase of de novo lipogenesis. GSH also has been reported to its depletion
  by CYP2E1 followed by the development of oxidative stress. Alcohol consumption negatively
  affects adiponectin secretion from adipocytes then causes inactive AMPK pathway,
  leading to elevated de novo lipogenesis and inflammatory process in the liver, while
  simultaneously decreasing fatty acid β-oxidation and contributing to hepatocyte
  necrosis. The red font indicates the end-point of pathology in the liver. ACC: Acetyl-CoA
