caption: Overview of the metabolic pathways and stimulatory signals in activated B
  cells. Glucose has a pivotal role in the supply of energy and biomolecules. GLUT1
  regulates glucose transport allowing glucose to fuel the glycolytic pathway and
  the TCA cycle within the mitochondria. The TCA cycle produces NADH and FADH2, which
  deliver electrons flux to the Electron Transport Chain for ATP generation during
  the oxidative phosphorylation. B cell metabolism can shunt from these pathways toward
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to increase nucleotide biosynthesis. In activated
  B cells, the high flux of glucose grants the biomolecules required for the cell
  expansion. Because of that, there is a large production of lactate and increased
  lipid synthesis. Fatty acid oxidation and glutaminolysis reactions are also increased
  to sustain the TCA cycle and replace the intermediates consumed in other biological
  processes. Stimulatory signals from the BCR and TLRs or from CD40 or BAFFR co-stimulatory
  molecules activate intra-cellular pathways with the recruitment of transcription
  factors leading to the transcription of glycolysis genes in the nucleus. The induction
  of the metabolic programs is under the control of numerous transcription factors,
  miRNA and enzymes that have positive (pointed arrow) or inhibitory (flattened arrow)
  effects. Only intermediates, transcription factors, enzymes and signaling molecules
  mentioned in the review are shown. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; AMPK, AMP-activated protein
