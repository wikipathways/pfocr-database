caption: GLP-1 source, GLP-1R labeling and GLP-1R signaling in pancreatic islets.
  (A) Potential sources of GLP1 in the islets, as well as paracrine signaling pathways.
  Proglucagon products from α-cells that activate islet GLP-1Rs include glucagon and
  potentially GLP-1. The biological relevance of GLP-1 produced by α-cells remains
  an unresolved line of investigation. (B) GLP1R labelling is observed at the membrane
  in β-cells. Predominantly cytoplasmic labelling is nonspecific unless the GLP1R
  is agonist-bound in which case some surface and punctate intracellular staining
  is detected due to GLP1R internalization. (C) Major GLP1R signaling pathways reported
  in primary rodent and human beta cells or islets. It is well established that GLP-1R
  signals through cAMP pathways, including PKA and EPAC2. β-arrestin 1 has been proposed
  to regulate GLP-1R signaling; however, the mechanisms of this pathway remain unresolved.
  (D) Actions mediated by the GLP-1R in pancreatic islets. ADCY, adenylate cyclase,
  GLP1R, Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; EPAC2, exchange
  protein directly activated by cAMP 2; INS, insulin SST, somatostatin.
