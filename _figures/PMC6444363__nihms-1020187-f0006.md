caption: Tat promotes astrogliogenesis over neurogenesis through its binding to Notch
  to activate the Notch signaling pathway. Tat binds to the Notch extracellular domain
  and leads to cleavage of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) by γ-secretase. NICD
  translocates to the nucleus and binds to the Rbpj binding site on the Hes1 promoter,
  dissociates the co-repressor (CoR), and recruits the co-activator (CoA) to transactivate
  downstream molecular Hes1 expression. Activation of Notch signaling is sufficient
  to favor astrogliogenesis over neurogenesis
