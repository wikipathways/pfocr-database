caption: The violacein biosynthetic pathway. Violacein is synthesized through five
  enzymatic steps and one non-enzymatic reaction from two molecules of tryptophan.
  Side-products detectable by HPLC after expression in yeast include deoxyviolacein,
  proviolacein, and prodeoxyviolacein. Additional side-products (in gray) deoxychromoviridans,
  chromoviridans, and oxychromoviridans are reported in the literature but are not
  produced in significant quantities in our strain; the precise mechanism of the reaction
  forming these products is still uncertain. See Supplementary Figure S8 for a detailed
  pathway with molecule structures.
