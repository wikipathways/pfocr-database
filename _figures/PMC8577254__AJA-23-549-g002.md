caption: 'RA synthesis pathway. Retinol enters the target cell through the Stra6 receptor
  where it is oxidized via RDH10 into retinal. The second oxidation reaction is catalyzed
  by ALDH1A family proteins. These proteins can be inhibited by WIN 18,446 which prevents
  retinal’s transition to RA. RA is then either used to mediate meiosis via binding
  to RAR/RXR transcriptional regulators or is inactivated via CYP26 family proteins
  resulting in meiotic arrest until a sufficient level of active RA is present. RA:
  retinoic acid; Stra6: stimulated by retinoic acid gene 6; RDH10: retinol dehydrogenase
  10; ALDH1A: aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A; RAR: retinoic acid receptor; RXR: retinoid
  X receptor; CYP26: cytochrome P450, family 26 proteins.'
