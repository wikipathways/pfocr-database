caption: '21-BD binds to NKA and decreases EGFR and ERK phosphorylation to reduce
  proliferation of HeLa cells. In addition, 21-BD binds to NKA and induces cell apoptosis
  through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. This involves the translocation
  of Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol.
  Cytochrome c activates the initiator caspase-9 (intrinsic pathway), which leads
  to activation of the effector caspase-3 and, subsequently, PARP-1 cleavage. Moreover,
  21-BD also activates the initiator caspase-8 (extrinsic pathway) and the effector
  caspase-3. 21-BD: 21-benzylidene digoxin; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor;
  ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Casp: caspase; cyt c: cytochrome c;
  PARP-1: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Question marks refer to unknown intermediaries
  in the pathway stimulated by 21-BD.'
