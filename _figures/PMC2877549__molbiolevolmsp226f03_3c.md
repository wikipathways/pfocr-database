caption: The proposed major metabolic pathways in Ascogregarina taiwanensis as determined
  by annotations of the GSS. Pathways and features that are shared with Cryptosporidium
  to the exclusion of other apicomplexans are shown in red, whereas those shared with
  other apicomplexans to the exclusion of Cryptosporidium are shown in green. Two
  organic end products in the glycolytic pathway are boxed.
