caption: Repulsive guidance signals specified by Sema-1a bidirectional signaling play
  an important role in sculpting Drosophila neuromuscular connectivity. In our model,
  Sema-1a forward signaling largely contributes to CNS axon guidance, whereas both
  forward and reverse signaling are required to induce axon-axon repulsion at specific
  pathway choice points in the PNS. In the PNS, two direct but opposing regulators
  of Rho family small GTPases, pbl and p190, are required for attractive target recognition
  processes that guide motor axons before reaching, or after leaving, guidance choice
  points. Furthermore, these proteins mediate Sema-1a reverse signaling through the
  control of Rho1 activity at guidance choice points and likely participate in the
  recognition of these choice points by axonal growth cones, an essential prerequisite
  for selective axon-axon defasciculation mediated by repulsive signaling pathways.
  We propose that Pbl links choice-point recognition signaling and Sema-1a reverse
  signaling, and further, that Sema-1a reverse signaling collaborates in parallel
  with receptor functions of PlexA to induce selective axon-axon repulsion. In addition,
  Pbl not only competes, but also collaborates, with p190 to regulate Sema-1a reverse
  signaling in a context dependent manner. Sema-1a/PlexA–mediated repulsive signaling
  and target recognition signaling are likely integrated and coordinated by pbl and
  p190, both spatially and temporally, so as to establish precise connections between
  motoneurons and their muscle targets.
