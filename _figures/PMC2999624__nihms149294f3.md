caption: Schematic model of the FeMo-co biosynthetic pathway showing the convergence
  of FeMo-co biosynthetic precursors ([Fe6-S9-X], [MoFe3S4] and homocitrate) into
  a central node composed of the NifEN and NifH proteins. The [Fe-S] cluster biosynthetic
  branch involves the activities of NifS, NifU, NifB and NifX; the molybdenum branch
  involves the activity of NifQ; and the homocitrate is synthesized by NifV. The NifEN
  protein catalyzes the conversion of NifB-co into the VK-cluster, whereas the incorporation
  of molybdenum into FeMo-co – and probably that of homocitrate– requires the concerted
  activities of NifEN and NifH. Completed FeMo-co is then transferred by NafY to the
  cofactor-deficient apo-NifDK protein to generate active Mo-nitrogenase.
