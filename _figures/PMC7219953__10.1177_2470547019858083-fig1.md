caption: 'The proposed mechanism of action underlying the fast and sustained antidepressant
  effects of ketamine. It is postulated that ketamine acts antagonizing NMDAR in GABAergic
  interneurons (a), thereby decreasing inhibitory action of this system on glutamatergic
  tonus (b). Thus, glutamatergic neurons release glutamate-containing vesicles in
  the synaptic cleft, which preferentially activates AMPAR, since NMDAR is antagonized
  by ketamine (c). Upon activation, AMPAR induces a transient sodium influx that depolarizes
  the cell and activates VDCC, which induces exocytosis of BDNF-containing vesicles.
  Released BDNF, in turn, activates TrkB receptors. Upon activation, TrkB stimulates
  signaling pathways, particularly PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated pathway. This signaling
  pathway culminates in the synthesis of synaptic proteins such as synapsin, PSD-95
  (which anchors AMPAR), and AMPAR subunit 1 (GluA1), which are inserted to the cell
  membrane, contributing to synaptogenesis and rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine
  (d). 4E-BP: eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein; Akt: protein kinase
  B; AMPAR: alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-5-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor; BDNF:
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GluA1: AMPA receptor subunit 1; GSK-3β: glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β; mTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin; NMDAR: N-methyl-D-aspartate
  receptor; p70S6K: 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PSD-95: postsynaptic density protein-95 kDa; TrkB: tropomyosin receptor
  kinase B; VDCC: voltage-dependent calcium channels. Figure designed using images
