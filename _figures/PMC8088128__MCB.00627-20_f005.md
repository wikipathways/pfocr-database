caption: RTK/MAPK signaling circuitry. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is represented as a circuit diagram, whereby
  RTKs are represented as parallel arranged power sources (green batteries) that transmit
  signal (e.g., electricity) downstream through functionally redundant paralogs, represented
  as parallel switches. (A) The loss of one paralog (single switch) still permits
  downstream signaling (MAPK signaling is represented as a lamp). (B) SHOC2 functions
  as a critical point of passage for RTK signal transduction to the MAPK pathway due
  to a lack of functionally redundant paralogs. The loss of SHOC2 alone is sufficient
  to abrogate the activation of the MAPK pathway.
