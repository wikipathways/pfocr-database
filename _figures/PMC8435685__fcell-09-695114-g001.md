caption: 'Schematic representation of the Notch pathway and miRNA biogenesis. (A)
  The Notch precursor is cleaved by a furin-like protease in the Golgi apparatus and
  then transported to the plasma membrane. Notch receptor on the membrane is activated
  by the binding with ligands present on adjacent cells, which induces a second proteolytic
  cut mediated by A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease (ADAM) 10 or 17, followed by a
  third cleavage by the γ-secretase complex that releases the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD). In the “canonical” Notch signaling, NICD translocates into the nucleus
  and, through the interaction with the transcription factor CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG1
  (CSL) and the Mastermind-like (MAML) adaptor proteins, modulates the transcription
  of several target genes. In the “non-canonical” signaling, Notch modulates Wnt/β-catenin,
  mammalian target of the rapamycin 2 complex (mTORC2)/Akt, Nuclear Factor kappa B
  (NF-κB), IkB kinase (IKK)-α/β and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced
  kinase (PINK1) on mitochondria, independently from CSL. NECD: Notch extracellular
  domain. (B) In the nucleus, genes coding for miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase
  II or III into primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), which are processed by the complex consisting
  of RNA-binding protein DGCR8 and type III RNase Drosha, into a stem-loop structure
  called precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Afterward, pre-miRNA is transported into the
  cytoplasm by Exportin-5 complex (Exportin -5_ Ran-GTP), where pre-miRNA is processed
  by another type III RNase enzyme Dicer to form the mature miRNA duplex. The two
  strands of the duplex are loaded into Argonaute (Ago) protein to form the RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC); one strand (also called guide strand) is selected to form
  the functional RISC complex, the other strand (passenger strand) is released from
  Ago and degraded (). For most miRNAs, one strand is preferentially loaded into Ago,
  forming the functional RISC, while the other is released and degraded. However,
  for some miRNAs, both strands give rise to functional miRNAs that are loaded into
  the RISC. Functional miRNAs regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level
  mainly by binding their seed region (nucleotides 2–8) to the 3′-untranslated region
  (UTR) of their target mRNAs. The interaction miRNA/mRNA modulates gene expression
  by inhibiting translation or inducing degradation of a specific mRNA depending on
  the complementarity of the sequence.'
