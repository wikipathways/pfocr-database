caption: Expression of genes involved in secondary metabolism in response to OGs and
  fungal infection. The scheme summarizes the relationships between the shikimate,
  Trp, Phe, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, camalexin, indole glucosinolates, and aliphatic
  glucosinolates biosynthetic pathways and the levels of expression of selected genes
  in each pathway, portrayed with MapMan software. The number of small squares next
  to each pathway or portion of pathway indicates how many genes present in the manually
  compiled list (for details, see ) and assigned to that pathway showed a 2.0-fold
  or greater change of expression (P ≤ 0.01) in response to OGs (A) at 1 h (left squares)
  or 3 h (right squares) or B. cinerea infection (B) at 18 h (left squares) or 48
  h (right squares). Red squares represent genes showing increased expression, blue
  squares represent genes showing decreased expression. Color intensity indicates
  the extent of change, expressed as log2 of the mean ratio between treated and control
  samples (see scale). Gray dots indicate that none of the genes in the pathway are
  significantly induced or repressed by the indicated treatment.
