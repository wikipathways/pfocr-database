caption: 'Influence of tumor microenvironment-derived factors in the activation of
  β-catenin pathways. Several cytokines, growth factors, and small nuclei acid molecules
  secreted by stromal cells induce aberrantly activation of β-catenin and its nuclear
  translocation in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells promoting events associated with
  an aggressive phenotype of the tumor cells. Il-37 represses the expression of β-catenin
  and its transcriptional activity. Osteopontin is statistically associated with the
  expression of β-catenin in CRC and is known to induce its activation in other types
  of cancer. More studies are necessary to confirm positive feedback between the secretion
  of this tumor microenvironment (TME) factor and β-catenin signaling pathways in
  CRC. In addition to these factors, the microbiota and the hypoxia in the TME, also
  participate in the modulation of β-catenin activation. This figure is original for
  this work. BMP: Bone morphogenic protein; CCAL: Colorectal cancer-associated lncRNA;
