caption: Proposed eRNA and NamiRNA interaction in drug resistance (a) and breast cancer
  tumorigenesis (b). During drug resistance, overexpressed miR-17 represses PTEN leading
  to the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway and HIF-1α. Simultaneously, Net1e increases
  the expression of NET1 while inhibiting the PI3K inhibitor and BCL-2. NET1 and NET1e
  interact with miR-17 via the PI3K-Akt pathway to inhibit apoptosis and increase
  tumor growth, while NET1 causes induced drug resistance (a). In breast cancer, fibroblast
  growth factor receptor 2 interacts with NET1e, the Estrogen receptor (ER), to regulate
  BRCA and other cancer genes, which are targets of miR-200b ~ 200a ~ 429. These trigger
  an interaction between miR-200b ~ 200a ~ 429, ER, NET1e, and ER-associated genes
  leading to tumor suppression, increased proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in
  breast cancer cells
