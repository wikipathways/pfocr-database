caption: Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a sensor of metabolic stress and
  integrator of environmental cues. Activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is triggered
  by oxidative stress, amino-acid levels and endosomal traffic to the lysosome by
  small GTPases such as Rab4A. In turn, mTORC1 promotes inflammation by skewing T-cell
  development. Oxidative stress is promoted by mitochondrial electron transport and
  balanced by the production of reduced glutathione (GSH) and its regeneration by
  NADPH via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Oxidative stress and activation of
  mTORC1 inhibit the expression of FoxP3, leading to contraction of the T regulatory
  (TREG) cell population, and expansion of proinflammatory T-cell lineages such as
  T helper (TH) 1, TH17, T follicular helper (TFH) and double-negative (DN) T cells.
  Pharmacological interventions by rapamycin (RAPA), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and 3-(3-pyridyl)-2-hydroxy-2-phosphonopropanoic
  acid (3-PEHPC) are highlighted in yellow. AKT, RAC serine/threonine-protein kinase;
  ANA, antinuclear antibodies; GTP-binding protein Rheb; IFNγ, interferon γ; Lck,
  tyrosine-protein kinase Lck; PI3K, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase; Rheb, SLE, systemic
  lupus erythematosus; TAL, transaldolase; TCR, T-cell receptor; TGFβ1, transforming
  growth factor β1.
