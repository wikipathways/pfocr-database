caption: Network generated in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool of “infectious diseases,
  antimicrobial response, and inflammatory response” of differentially expressed proteins
  (DEPs) in vaccinated sheep at (A) 5 days post-vaccination (dpv) and (B) 14 dpv.
  Proteins that were upregulated are shown in red, and those that were downregulated
  are shown in green. Proteins in white were not significantly dysregulated. Symbol
  shape indicates gene function.
