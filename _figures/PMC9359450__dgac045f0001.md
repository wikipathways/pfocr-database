caption: TSH receptor (TSHR) signaling. Schematic representation of major signaling
  pathways downstream TSHR. When not stimulated by activated receptor, Gα (α) is bound
  to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and Gβγ (βγ), forming inactive Gs or Gq containing
  trimer, αβγ. Ligand-activated receptor leads to GDP/GTP exchange on the α subunit,
  resulting in dissociation into α and βγ subunits. α and βγ protein subunits subsequently
  interact with second effector proteins, promoting multiple downstream pathway activation;
  TSHR/Gs activates adenylyl cyclase (AC), resulting in increased cAMP, which in turn
  regulates multiple signaling pathways, including ion channels, protein kinase A
  and EPAC. TSHR/Gq initiates phospholipase C (PLC)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
  cascade activation, promoting cell proliferation and survival. Likewise, TSHR/Gq
  enhances diacyl glycerol (DAG) generation and protein kinase C (PKC) activation.
  Both Gs and Gq, eventually activate Raf/MEK/ERK, also known as mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathways. βγ subunits initiate receptor-distinct signaling processes
  including G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) recruitment. GRKs phosphorylate
  serine/threonine residues within the TSHR C-terminus, creating binding sites for
  β-arrestins (βarr). βarr recruitment prevents further G protein activation (desensitization).
  All signaling pathways downstream from TSHR culminate in biological effects mediated
  through transcription factors such as ERK and cAMP response element binding protein.
