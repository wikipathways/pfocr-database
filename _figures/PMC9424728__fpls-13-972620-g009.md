caption: Difference in the enzyme expression between the WT and v-3 in the chlorophyll
  and carotenoid biosynthetic pathways. (A) The red arrow represents the chlorophyll
  synthesis pathway, and the green arrow represents the chlorophyll decomposition
  pathway. (B) Carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. In mutants, the upregulated gene is
  in red boxes, and the downregulated gene is in blue boxes. The white boxes represent
  genes with unchanged expression. *DEGs with | FoldChange| > 1.5 and p < 0.05. DEGs,
  differentially expressed genes; WT, wild type.
