caption: 'The pivotal role of HK2 in the glycolytic pathway. HK2 can catalyze the
  conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P). Subsequently, G-6-P initiated
  the main pathway of glucose utilization, including glycolysis. There are five isotypes
  of HK family are founded in mammals: HK1, HK2, HK3, HK4 and HKDC1, the expression
  levels in various tissues and cells are different. HK1 is ubiquitous in mammalian
  tissues and has a high content in the brain. HK2 is a major regulated isoform in
  various types of tissues cell lines, and mainly found to be expressed in musculoskeletal
  system and heart cells. HK3 was mainly distributed in bone marrow, lung and spleen.
  HK4 regulates insulin secretion, glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis and decomposition
  in liver. HKDC1 is widely expressed in the pharynx, thymus, colon, and eyes'
