caption: Metabolism regulation under hypoxia conditions. Cellular metabolism is affected
  by hypoxic conditions. Under low oxygen conditions, HIF-1 increases the transcription
  of enzymes involved in glucose catabolism. Similarly, HIF-1 enhances the anaerobic
  lactate pathway by increasing the transcription of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA).
  Furthermore, HIF-1 promotes the transcription of glucose transporters to offset
  low ATP availability. Conversely, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK-1) is induced,
  causing phosphorylation and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to regulate
  the levels of acetyl-CoA. Additionally, HIF-1 upregulates isocitrate dehydrogenase-1
  (IDH-1) and aconitase expression, causing a reduction in acetyl-CoA availability
  and reducing the activity of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) to decrease ROS
  generation by the mitochondria. Furthermore, hypoxia promotes the transcription
  of LON genes, inhibiting the expression of the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform
  1 (COOX4-1). Altogether, HIF-1 upregulates COOX4-2, allowing a cellular environment
  for optimal use of oxygen during oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, hypoxic
  conditions have been reported to affect lipid metabolism. Lipogenesis and lipids
  are upregulated by HIF-1 through the induction of several target genes, thus promoting
  fatty acid and triacylglycerol (TGA) synthesis. Additionally, endocytosis of lipoproteins
  is regulated during hypoxia through the overexpression of the low-density lipoprotein
  (LDL) receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)
  receptor (VLDLR). Moreover, IDH1 is regulated by HIF-1 indirectly, which leads to
  maintaining fatty acid synthesis through reductive carboxylation. Lipid storage
  is upregulated by the induction of acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 2 (AGPAT2)
  and lipin-1. Moreover, HIF-1 and HIF-2 inhibit enzymes that participate in fatty
  acid degradation via a downregulation in the expression of several target genes
  involved in this process. Green arrows indicate induction or upregulation, and red
  arrows denote inhibition or downregulation.
