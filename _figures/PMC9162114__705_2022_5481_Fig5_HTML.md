caption: Hypothetical model of the JEV life cycle. (a) 1. Interaction of JEV with
  host cell receptors. 2. Entry of JEV through the endocytic pathway, which may be
  clathrin dependent, clathrin independent, or cholesterol dependent. 3. Once inside
  the host cell, JEV releases its genomic RNA into the cytosol. 4. Binding of JEV
  genomic RNA to the ribosome located on the ER membrane. 5. Initial translation of
  genomic RNA followed by polyprotein cleavage and arrangement of structural and non-structural
  proteins in the ER membrane, ER lumen, and cytosol as shown in Fig. . 6. Formation
  of the replication complex required for replication of JEV genomic RNA. 7. Packaging
  of the JEV genomic RNA into the viral capsid protein, forming the nucleocapsid.
  8. Budding of the ER membrane carrying newly assembled virions. 9. Release of the
  newly assembled JEV virion through ER budding (pH 6.7). 10. The immature virion
  then enters into the Golgi body (pH 6.0) through the cis-Golgi network (CGN). 11.
  Release of JEV through the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (pH 5.7) 12. The furin protease
  site of prM gets exposed due to the decrease in pH, and prM is cleaved by the host
  furin protease. The conversion of prM into the M protein results in a rearrangement
  of the viral envelope proteins, which results in the maturation of JEV. 13. Mature
  JEV virions are released through exocytosis. (b) JEV replication complex and assembly
  complex. The formation of the replication complex occurs at vesicle packets, which
  are an extended and modified network of the ER. Non-structural proteins participate
  in the formation of the replication complex and replication of JEV RNA. NS1 proteins
  induce curvature into the ER membrane, which is required for the recruitment of
  other non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4, NS5). The NS3 protein, which has helicase
  activity, and the NS5 protein, which has RdRp activity, interact with the viral
  RNA and participate in replication. NS2B acts as a cofactor for the NS3 protein.
  NS4A and NS4B interact with NS1 and help in the formation of the viral replication
  complex. The assembly complex is formed by JEV structural proteins (C, prM, and
  E), where newly synthesized RNA is incorporated into a virion particle. (c) Proteolytic
  cleavage of the prM protein by furin protease is required for maturation of the
  virion.
