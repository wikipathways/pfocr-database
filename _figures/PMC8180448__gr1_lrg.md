caption: 'Virus directed and host directed actions of DHODH inhibitors as antiviral
  agents. DHODH plays an important role in generation of UMP, which is used by the
  virus for its replication. Thus DHODH inhibitors may hamper the RNA replication
  process of the virus. By acting on the interferon system, DHODH inhibitors also
  plays crucial role in activation of innate immune system. Leflunomide/teriflunomide
  shows binding to the spike: ACE2 interface (in silico evidence), binds to active
  site of M-Pro of SARS-CoV-2 (in silico evidence). ┤indicates inhibition and ┤┤indicates
  possible inhibition (only in silico evidence). Green arrow → indicates activation
  of a pathway. ISG: Interferon stimulated genes, IRF: Interferon regulatory factors.
