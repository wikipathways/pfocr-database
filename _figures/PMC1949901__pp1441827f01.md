caption: Current understanding of the pathways of fatty acid synthesis which are known
  to occur within the Brassicaceae. Dashed lines indicate multistep pathways, while
  shaded boxes indicate inferred steps. The capital letters in parentheses indicate
  the potential pathways by which triacylglycerols can be produced following ACP synthesis
  within the plastid. These letters are used to differentiate these pathways (A–H)
  as described within this article. Suffix annotations in parentheses after enzyme
  name have been added to simplify description of these enzymes within this article.
  ACCase, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FA, fatty acid; FAS, fatty acid synthase; FAT, fatty
  ACP thioesterase; DES, desaturase; ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase; MC, medium chain; AT,
  various acyl transferases; PC, phosphatidylcholine; TAG, triacylglycerol. Within
  the plastid, fatty acids are synthesized de novo from acetyl-CoA in a series of
  condensation and elongation reactions to form a pool of mostly 16:0- and 18:0-acyl
  chains linked to ACP, of which a portion are desaturated to monounsaturated acyl-ACPs.
  These acyl-ACPs are cleaved by specific thioesterases to free fatty acids and then
  converted to acyl-CoAs by acyl-CoA synthetases at or near the outer plastid envelope,
  so as to be available for passage to the cytoplasm (). Export to the cytoplasm,
  or entry to the eukaryotic pathway, diverts acyl chains away from membrane lipid
  synthesis in the plastid (the prokaryotic pathway) and makes them available for
  incorporation into triacylglycerols. Within the cytosol (primarily endoplasmic reticulum)
  further modification of the acyl chains occurs through the complex interaction of
  desaturation, elongation, and phospholipid/acyl-CoA exchange mechanisms. The extra
  carbon required for acyl chain elongation commonly observed in the Brassicaceae
  originates from a distinct cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool, probably derived from mitochondrial
  citrate metabolism ().
