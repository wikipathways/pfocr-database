caption: Methionine uniquely induces the PPP-GDH-PLP node. (A) Metabolic pathways
  induced by methionine. Illustration of the results of a manual regrouping of the
  methionine responsive genes into their relevant metabolic pathways, restricted only
  to central carbon metabolism, and subsequent anabolic processes. The pathway map
  includes individual genes in central carbon metabolism which are induced by methionine
  (indicating the fold changes in gene expression). The color bar indicates the fold
  increase in gene expression. (B) A bird’s-eye view description of the PPP-GDH-PLP
  node regulated by methionine. Each bead (or filled circle) represents a step in
  the pathway (see details in Supplemental Figures 4 and 5). Methionine-induced steps
  are shown with a yellow fill at the centre of the circle for the given step. Precursors
  generated through this node are shown in the inset; p = 1.2 × 10–6 (Fisher’s exact
  test) for the methionine-dependent induction of the PPP-GDH-PLP node.
