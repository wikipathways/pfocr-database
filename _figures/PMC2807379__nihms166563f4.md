caption: '"Cystoproteins” are proteins of genes mutated in cystic kidney diseases
  of humans, mice, or zebrafish. Depending on cell cycle stage, cystoproteins are
  localized at different subcellular organelles (shown in grey), including primary
  cilia, basal bodies, endoplasmic reticulum, the mitotic spindle, centrosomes, adherens
  junctions or focal adhesions. Arrows in the primary cilium indicate the direction
  of anterograde transport along the microtubule system mediated by kinesin-2 and
  retrograde transport by cytoplasmic dynein 1b. A) Most nephrocystins (blue) are
  located at cilia, the basal body, and centrosome in a cell cycle dependent manner.
  NPHP1 is also at the transition zone, focal adhesions and adherens junctions. B)
  Sensory cilia perceive and process cell external signals, and “cystoproteins” are
  involved in signaling mechanisms downstream of cilial signal recognition. Downstream
  of cilia (pink), Wnt signaling () and hedgehog signaling () play a role in planar
  cell polarity, which is mediated (C) partially through orientation of centrosomes
  and the mitotic spindle poles (). D) Cilia-dependent mechanisms of planar cell polarity
  seem to be the central to the pathogenesis of the ciliopathies, the most prominent
  of which are listed on the right. Wht, the Wnti signaling pathway; Shh, the sonic
  hedgehog signaling pathway.'
