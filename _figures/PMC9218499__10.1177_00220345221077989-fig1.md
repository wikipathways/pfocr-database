caption: Distribution of taste receptors and taste signaling pathways. (A) Taste receptors
  are expressed in the oral cavity (taste buds and gingival solitary chemosensory
  cells [SCCs]), respiratory tract (SCCs and brush cells), urinary tract (brush cells),
  and digestive system (tuft cells). (B) Agonists activate sweet or bitter receptors
  through the GNAT3-PLCβ2-TRPM5 pathway. Gustatory and extragustatory taste receptors
  share the same portion of the taste signaling pathway that involves activation of
  the taste receptors, gustducin, PLCβ2, and TRPM5. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IP3,
  inositol trisphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. In the taste
  system, an increased intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration leads to the
  release of ATP through the CALHM1 channel to the facial nerve, transmitting the
  taste signal to the brain. In the airway and urethra, SCCs or brush cells activated
  by bitter compounds or acyl-homoserine lactones release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine,
  which activates nearby peptidergic trigeminal nerve fibers, inducing mucociliary
  clearance by nasal ciliated cells and leading to protective responses and neurogenic
  inflammation. SCC activation can also stimulate neighbor nasal ciliated cells, which
  directly exert an antibacterial effect by releasing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).
  In the airway smooth muscle cells, increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration results
  in potassium efflux and the relaxation of precontracted smooth muscle. In the gut,
  activation of tuft cells expressing the taste signaling pathway triggers the release
  of IL-25, which acts on innate lymphoid immune cells and activates type II immunity.
