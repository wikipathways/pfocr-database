caption: Overview of the PATHLINKER algorithm. Given an interactome, we identify a
  set of receptors and a set of TRs for a particular curated pathway (e.g., Wnt).
  We apply PATHLINKER to reconstruct the pathway, ranking proteins and interactions
  by their first occurrence in the k shortest paths from any receptor to any TR. Using
  the curated pathway as a ground truth, we evaluate the performance of PATHLINKER.
  We combine the ranked lists for multiple curated pathways to obtain an aggregate
  evaluation.
