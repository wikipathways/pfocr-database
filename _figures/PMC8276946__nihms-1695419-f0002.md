caption: The proposed model of aluminium-induced neuronal apoptosis. Al was shown
  to induce apoptosis in neuronal cells through distinct pathways. Mitochondrial pathway
  is directly related to Al-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent Bax-mediated
  cytochrome c release. The latter is also stimulated due to positive and negative
  regulation of p53 and Bcl-2 expression, respectively. Al was shown to increase the
  rate of cytochrome c binding to Apaf-1 with subsequent formation of apoptosome and
  caspase 9 activation with subsequent caspase 3 cleavage and activation promoting
  apoptosis. Another pathway of Al proapoptotic effect involves Fas/FasL signaling
  with activation of caspase 3 following caspase 8 stimulation. In addition, Al3+-induced
  up-regulation of DAXX results in JNK signaling that also possesses a stimulatory
  effect on Bax. Prooxidant activity of Al3+ is also expected to underlie proapoptotic
  effect of the metal through increased oxidative modification of biomolecules and
  particularly nucleic acids.
