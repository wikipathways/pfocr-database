caption: Schematic drawing of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) is activated through receptor-binding (receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs) or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), sidled blue line) by growth factors
  (GF) or cytokines (CY) resulting in phosphorylation of PIP2. PIP3 subsequently serves
  as a second messenger allowing the binding of pleckstrin homology domain-containing
  proteins like Akt. Thereby the latter undergoes conformational changes leading to
  its phosphorylation and activation by PDK1 and mTORC2. Akt finally participates
  in the regulation of cellular processes like translation, cell growth and apoptosis
  by phosphorylating further proteins. Termination of the signaling cascade can either
  occur through the dephosphorylation of PIP3 by the phosphatase PTEN or SHIP, or
  further downstream through the dephosphorylation of Akt by PHLPP or PP2A.
