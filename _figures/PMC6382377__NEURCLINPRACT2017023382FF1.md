caption: The mechanisms of action of each DMT have not been fully elucidated in relapsing
  MS; the depiction shown in this schematic with respect to effects on lymphocytes
  is based on currently available evidence. Alemtuzumab is a humanized immunoglobulin-1
  monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody that results in rapid lysis of lymphocytes. Daclizumab
  is a humanized monoclonal anti-CD25 antibody that leads to CD56BRIGHT expansion
  via interleukin-2 modulation, and consequently, to activated T-cell depletion. Dimethyl
  fumarate is believed to exert its lymphopenic effect through activation of the Nrf2
  pathway, which leads to induction of the anti-inflammatory stress protein HO-1 and
  consequently apoptosis of primarily CD8+ T cells., Fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate
  (S1P) agonist; after binding to and activating S1P1, fingolimod acts as a functional
  antagonist and prevents CCR7+ lymphocytes, including naïve and central memory T
  cells and B cells, from exiting lymph nodes., Natalizumab is a humanized monoclonal
  anti-α4 integrin antibody that binds α4β1 integrin (very late antigen-4 [VLA-4])
  and prevents lymphocytes from crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and entering
  the CNS. Ocrelizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against
  CD20-expressing B-cells; it results in antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis following
  cell surface binding to B lymphocytes. Teriflunomide inhibits de novo pyrimidine
  synthesis in rapidly dividing cells by inhibiting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
  (DHODH), causing a cytostatic effect on activated/proliferating T and B cells.
