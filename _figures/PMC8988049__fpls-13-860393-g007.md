  that were included in the heatmaps were significantly (q < 0.05) differentially
  abundant at least in one time point across all genotypes investigated. During P.
  brassicae infection, pathogen releases signal metabolites such as PAMPs and effectors
  and these elicitors were recognized by host cells. Plant receptors such as receptor
  like -kinases and -proteins (RLKs/RLPs) and resistance (R) proteins interact with
  the pathogen signal compounds, thereby activates the MAP kinases (signal transduction).

  SA, JA, and ET biosynthetic pathway and other secondary metabolism were activated.
  Pathogen defense related secondary metabolites such as glucosinolates, small molecules
  thaumatin, polyssacharides (lignin), glycosyl hydrolases (chitinases), and a spectrum
  of antimicrobial and defense related proteins including dehydrin proteins were differentially
  accumulated in response to the pathogen. Growth regulators, auxin (AU) and cytokinin
  (CK) were manipulated by the pathogen, the hormones are regulated abnormally, thereby
  leading to the hypertrophy in the root tissues. There is an interplay between ROS
  and calcium signaling compounds during plant and pathogen (P. brassicae) interaction.
