caption: SARS-CoV-2 intracellular signaling. The main route for SARS-CoV-2 entrance
  in cells is through the ACE2 receptor, which subsequently undergoes to downloading.
  The virus enters into the cells also via TLR receptors or integrins. After internalization,
  SARS-CoV-2 promotes reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species production
  and activates the inflammasome complex, formed by the nucleotide-binding domain
  leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing receptor 3 (NLRP3), the adaptor
  apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and the caspase 1 effector protein.
  In this condition, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), in steady
  state inactivated by Keap-1 ligand, is ubiquinated favoring the inflammatory response
  caused by the presence of to the virus. In the presence of the inflammatory response
  caused to the virus, the reactive oxidizing species produced, and the activated
  inflammasome triggers the activation of IκB kinase (IKK) complex boosting the nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) pathway, which in
  turn, translocating into the nucleus, promotes the transcription of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and enzymes, such as cycloxygenase (COX) and
  the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) amplifying oxidative stress and
  inflammation. Increased reactive oxidant species levels activate the hypoxia inducible
  factor 1α (HIF-1α) which, once translocated into the nucleus, interacts with the
  aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) protein, in a promotor region
  hypoxia response element (HRE) on DNA, promoting TNF-related death genes transcription
  and ultimately leading to apoptosis. NLRP3 inflammasome activation leads to the
  boosting of the caspase cascade contributing to inflammation and apoptosis worsening
  the symptoms of COVID-19 disease.
