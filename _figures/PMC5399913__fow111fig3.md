caption: Anti-recombination and anti-crossover activities of Srs2 during replication
  and HR mediated DSB repair. (A) Accumulation of single-stranded DNA at stalled replication
  forks can lead to Rad51 filament assembling and Rad51-catalyzed recombination events.
  PCNA, when sumoylated, actively recruits Srs2 helicase to turn over Rad51 filaments
  and suppress salvage recombination events. (B) Double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be
  repaired by HR, which is initiated by the generation of 3΄ single-stranded DNA through
  DNA end resection. RPA, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein loaded during DNA
  end resection, is replaced by Rad51, a reaction facilitated by mediator activities
  from Rad52 and Rad55-Rad57. Rad51 is able to catalyzed strand invasion when Rad54
  is present. In its absence, the Rad51 filament may become toxic and requires strippase
  activity from Srs2 for its turnover, so that alternative repair mechanisms can be
  employed. Upon successful strand invasion, the invaded 3΄ end is extended by repair
  DNA synthesis to recover the missing genetic information based on the available
  homologous template. The resulting intermediates may be processed through SDSA pathway
  where the invading strand is displaced and annealed to the opposite 3΄ end of the
  break followed by gap filling. Multiple lines of genetic evidence suggest Srs2 plays
  a key role in SDSA pathway.
