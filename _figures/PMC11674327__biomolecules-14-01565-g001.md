caption: The extra-ribosomal functions of two RPs activating the NF-kB pathway during
  viral infection. (i). During FMDV infection, eL13/RPL13 induces and activates the
  promoters of NF-κB and downstream IFN-β genes, which mediates the transcription
  and secretion of the relevant antiviral cytokines IFN-β and IL-6. (ii). By directly
  interacting with HSV-1 DNA or IAV RNA, the uS2/RPSA is phosphorylated. Then, the
  phosphorylated uS2/RPSA is associated with SMARCA5 to increase the recruitment of
  the activated NF-κB p65 subunit to the promoters of specific proinflammatory cytokine
  genes, accelerating their transcriptional upregulation, and improves chromatin accessibility
  at inflammatory gene promoters. (Produced using Figdraw 2.0)
