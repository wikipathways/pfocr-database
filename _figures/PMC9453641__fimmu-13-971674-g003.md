caption: The mechanism of action of HSV-1 therapy. (A) Propranolol blocks β-adrenergic
  binding to β-adrenergic receptors, leading to a restriction of Gαs-mediated cAMP
  synthesis. This restriction limits the transient flux of intracellular cAMP to activate
  PKA production and inhibits its phosphorylation to produce BARK. activation of Src
  kinase is dependent on BARK, and its inhibition in turn inhibits activation of the
  transcription factor STAT3. This series of reactions inhibit the type I IFN-mediated
  antiviral response and promotes the normal replication and propagation of HSV-1,
  thus exerting an oncolytic effect. (B) HSV-1 stimulates the production of type I
  IFN by pDC, which activates NK cells to exert a direct killing effect on tumor cells.
  (C) HSV-1 stimulates the release of type II IFN by NK cells through the TLR2/NF-κB
  signaling pathway. Type II IFNs released by NK cells recruit macrophages, DC cells,
  and other immune cells, which act as immune agents to remove tumor cells. (D) The
  viral polymerase synthesis factor UL42 is able to interact with the host transcription
  factor IRF3. This interaction inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation and downstream IFN-β
  gene transcription, thereby suppressing IFN-β expression and thus the antiviral
  effect. The virus is consequently able to replicate and spread normally, exerting
  an oncolytic effect.
