caption: 'Models for antigen cross-presentation mechanisms induced by adjuvants in
  DCs. TLR-based adjuvants: In the presence of TLR triggering, antigen is taken up
  by the DCs and delivered to phago/lysosomes (1). The MHCI molecules and TLR4 within
  the endosomal recycling compartment are shuttled into the phago/lysosome (2a) following
  TLR4 signaling induced phosphorylation of SNAP23 (). TLR4 signaling further induces
  perinuclear clustering (3) of lysosomes in a Rab34-dependent manner (), resulting
  in delayed (dashed line) phago-lysosomal fusion (2b). The latter slows down antigen
  degradation and thereby increases cross-presentation. Saponin-based adjuvants: Saponins,
  alone or in phospholipid and cholesterol particles, in combination with antigens
  are phagocytosed (A). The saponins induce lipid bodies (B) and increase cytosolic
  translocation of the antigen (C) and subsequent proteasome-dependent cross-presentation
  (D) (, ) via the cytosolic pathway. Lipid bodies play an unknown but crucial role
  in this process (B) (). Aluminum-based nanoparticles: An aluminum-based nanoparticle
  loaded with antigen and the TLR9 ligand CpG is taken up via endocytosis, which is
  largely mediated through the scavenger receptor A (I) (). After lysosomal fusion
  with the endosome, nanoparticle-mediated rupture of the vesicular membrane gains
  antigens access to the cytosol (II) and after proteasomal degradation (III) are
  cross-presented via the cytosolic pathway.'
