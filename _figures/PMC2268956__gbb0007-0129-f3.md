caption: 'Schematic illustration of the major pathways leading to apoptosis. Apoptosis
  occurs through two main pathways. These are the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway
  which originates through the activation of cell-surface death receptors, for example
  Fas, and the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway which originates from mitochondrial
  release of cytochrome c. A distinct nuclear pathway of apoptosis arises through
  increased expression of GAPDH and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus,
  whereas the JNK signal-transduction pathway is activated in response to different
  stress stimuli. Bid, Bax and Bak represent pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members; Bcl-2
  and Bcl-xL are antiapoptotic. Abbreviations: ΔΨm, inner mitochondrial transmembrane
  potential; AP-1, activating protein-1; Apaf1, apoptotic protease-activating factor
  1; dATP, deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate; Cyt C, cytochrome c; endoG, endonuclease
  G; FasL, Fas ligand.'
