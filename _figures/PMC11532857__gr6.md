caption: Role of miRNAs regulating glycolysis in HCC. A. Tumor cells use glucose as
  their metabolic source to meet their biosynthetic and bioenergetic needs. By inactivating
  pyruvate dehydrogenase and increasing the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A,
  pyruvate is converted to lactate, and lactate increases to a large level. Increased
  levels of lactate become the main energy fuel in tumors.B.The increase of miR-3662
  levels by directly targeting the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) by inhibiting
  the activation of ERK and JNK signaling pathways and by reducing lactate production
  and reducing the Warburg effect inhibits coagulation in cancer cells. Increasing
  the level of miR-183-5p by reducing the expression of the PTEN gene in the Akt,
  p-Akt, and mTOR pathway and increasing the expression of PKM2, HK2, LDHA, GLUT1
  genes with lactate production leads to an increase in glycolysis in HCC cells
