caption: AIV infection resulted in Golgi apparatus stress (GAS), characterized by
  swelling and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus. During GAS response, the TFE3
  pathway exhibited robust activation. The activation of the TFE3 pathway within the
  GAS response promoted endosome acidification and increased the transcription of
  glycosylation enzymes, thereby facilitating AIV replication
