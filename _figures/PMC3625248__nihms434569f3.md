caption: 'Schematic depiction of mechanochemical signaling pathway responsible for
  flow-mediated dilation in human coronary arterioles. Shear stress can activate phospholipases
  to cleave arachidonic acid from cell membranes. This serves as a substrate for CYP450
  monooxygenase production of EETs. These metabolites and/or shear directly activate
  TPRV4 channels to enhance calcium entry into endothelial cells. The rise in calcium,
  together with enhanced production of ROS from NADPH oxidase and mechanosensitive
  factors (unpublished data), stimulates mitochondrial production of superoxide. The
  mitochondrial-produced superoxide is dismutated to hydrogen peroxide, which diffuses
  to the vascular smooth muscle cell layer to oxidize cysteine residues of PKG1α,
  causing homodimerization and activation of the enzyme. The activated dimer opens
  BK channels on the cell membrane, leading to hyperpolarization and relaxation of
  the vascular smooth muscle layer. Abbreviations similar to . Also: CuZn SOD (copper-zinc
  superoxide dismutase); MnSOD (Manganese superoxide dismutase); PKG1α (protein kinase
  G 1α); PLA2 (phospholipase A2); TPRV4 (transient receptor potential vannilloid 4).'
