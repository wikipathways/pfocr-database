  cycle. In the Kennedy pathway, choline kinase catalyzes the conversion of choline
  into PC. PC is then converted to CDP-choline by phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase,
  and subsequently, CDP-choline forms PC under the action of 1,2-diacylglycerol choline-phosphotransferase.
  Phosphatidylethanolamine synthesizes PC through PEMT. In phospholipids, saturated
  and monounsaturated fatty acids typically esterify at the sn-1 position, while polyunsaturated
  fatty acids are esterified at the sn-2 position. The asymmetric distribution of
  fatty acids at sn-1 and sn-2 is established through a deacylation-reacylation process
  known as the Lands'' cycle. The deacylation step, catalyzed by phospholipase A2,
  removes saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids from the sn-2 position of PCs.
  The reacylation step, facilitated by LPCAT, incorporates polyunsaturated fatty acids
  at the sn-2 position of PC. PC, phosphocholine; PEMT, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyl
