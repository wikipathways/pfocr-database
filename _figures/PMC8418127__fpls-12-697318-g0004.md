caption: Representative biosynthetic pathway of phytoalexins in Oryza sativa (rice).
  Phytocassanes bioproduction is initiated by the conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP) to ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) by OsCPS2 (copalyl diphosphate synthase
  2). ent-CDP is converted to ent-cassadiene by OsKSL7 (kaurene synthase like 7).
  ent-cassadiene is converted to different derivatives of phytocassanes by CYP450s.
  Momilactone biosynthesis is initiated by the conversion of GGPP to syn-copalyl diphosphate
  (syn-CDP) through OsCPS4. syn-CDP is converted to syn-pimaradiene by OsKSL4. syn-pimaradiene
  is converted to momilactone through the reactions mediated by CYP99A2/A3, CYP701A8,
  CYP76M14 and short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (momilactone synthase; OsMAS). Dotted
  arrows represent a multi-step pathway.
