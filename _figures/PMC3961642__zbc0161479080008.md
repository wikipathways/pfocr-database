caption: 'TXNIP deficiency disrupts mitochondrial fuel selection. During periods of
  carbohydrate deprivation, up-regulation of TXNIP serves to limit glucose transport
  into skeletal muscle and promote mitochondrial oxidation of alternative fuels. TXNIP
  deficiency enhances glucose uptake and flux through both glycolysis and the pentose
  phosphate pathway. Despite this shift to glycolytic metabolism, respiratory function
  of the ETC remains intact, thereby permitting transfer of glucose-derived NADH to
  complex I via the malate/aspartate shuttle. Diminished protein expression and activities
  of specific mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes lowers muscle capacity for oxidizing
  lactate, fatty acid, amino acid, and ketones, thus disrupting adaptive mitochondrial
  fuel switching in response to starvation and exercise. Key: metabolites affected
  by TXNIP deficiency are indicated in red (increased) and blue (decreased). Abbreviations:
