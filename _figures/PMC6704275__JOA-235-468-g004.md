caption: 'Model of non‐glycolytic metabolism interaction in astroglial and neuronal
  cells. In the presence of glucose, free fatty acids in the brain are taken up and
  oxidised by astroglial and neuronal cells to produce ATP via Krebs cycle/OxPhos
  as a supplementary energy source. Potentially, MCFA are mainly oxidised in neurons
  and other fatty acids in astroglial cells (dark green pathways). Under glucose deprivation:
  (1) astroglial cells can conduct ketogenesis to provide fast energetic substrates
  to neurons (light green pathway) and (2) ketone bodies from the bloodstream are
  taken up and oxidised by brain cells, providing up to ~70% of the energetic requirements
  (blue pathways). (3) Glutamate/glutamine is necessary to regulate the Krebs cycle,
  playing a major role in the communication of astroglia and neurons by processing
  excessive synaptic glutamate and providing amino acid glutamine. Also, but to a
  lesser extent, astroglial produced alpha‐ketoglutarate can be converted into glutamate
  to promote neurotransmitter and/or neuronal energetic by‐product release (mustard
  coloured pathways). (5). Neurotransmitter GABA can also be converted into a Krebs
  cycle metabolite depending on the needs of the mitochondrial Krebs cycle (red coloured
  pathway).'
