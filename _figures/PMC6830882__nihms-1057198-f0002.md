caption: The LINC complex and the YAP/TAZ pathway are canonical signaling pathways
  that transduce mechanical forces to the nucleus. The LINC complex interacts with
  the actin cytoskeleton (a). Forces applied to the cellular membrane are propagated
  through focal adhesions and actin fibers, activating the LINC complex and inducing
  changes in chromosomal structure and gene expression. In addition to LINC complex
  activation, force application also induces activation of the transcriptional co-activators
  YAP/TAZ and of the transcription factor TEAD (b). The application of physical forces
  induces actin stress fiber formation, which inhibits phosphorylation and subsequent
  degradation of YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ then translocate to the nucleus to bind TEAD and
  activate gene expression
