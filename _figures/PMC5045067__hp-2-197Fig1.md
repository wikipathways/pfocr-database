caption: 'Dual regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α by oxygen-dependent
  prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation.Notes: In the presence of oxygen, prolyl hydroxylase
  domain (PHD) enzymes and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) hydroxylate two proline (P)
  and one asparaginyl (N) residues, respectively. Hydroxylated proline residues (P-OH)
  target HIF-α for proteasomal degradation by enabling recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau
  tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) product, an ubiquitin E3 ligase. Proline hydroxylation
  is inhibited in the presence of modest hypoxia, allowing HIF-α to escape proteolytic
  destruction and form a transcription factor in complex with HIF-β. More severe hypoxia
  results in the inhibition of hydroxylation of the asparaginyl residue (N-OH), allowing
  for the recruitment of the transcriptional co-activators p300/CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding
  protein) binding protein to enhance HIF-mediated gene transcription. Reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) can act at multiple points to modulate the HIF hydroxylase pathway:
  for example, by inhibiting FIH (and to a lesser extent, PHD enzymes) as well as
  by enhancing HIF-α transcription and translation.Abbreviations: PAS, PER-AHR/ARNT-SIM;
  PER, period circadian protein; AHR, aryl-hydrocarbon receptor; ARNT, aryl-hydrocarbon-receptor
  nuclear translocator; SIM, single-minded protein; bHLH, basic-helix-loop-helix;
  2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate.'
