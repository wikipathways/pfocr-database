caption: 'β-lactamase production is the most important mechanism by which Gram-negative
  bacteria develop resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins, cephalosporins,
  and carbapenems. These enzymes hydrolyze the β-lactam ring, which inactivates the
  antibacterial properties of the molecule (, top) [, ]. As a result, bacterial infections
  are often treated with two drugs: one such as a penicillin to inhibit bacterial
  cell wall synthesis and a second drug to inhibit the β-lactamases produced by the
  bacteria, thereby preventing the hydrolysis of penicillin. There are three β-lactamase
  inhibitors approved for clinical use: clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam
  (, bottom). Unlike β-lactam antibiotics, which are rapidly hydrolyzed by the β-lactamase,
  the acyl-enzyme formed by β-lactamase inhibitors chemically rearranges to form a
  transiently inhibited complex (). Following acylation, the thiazolidinium ring of
  tazobactam or sulbactam or the oxazolidinium ring of clavulanic acid opens to give
  a reactive imine (species 1, ). The reactive imine can then participate in a number
  of transformations. The most likely process is hydrolytic deacylation of the imine
  acyl-enzyme, leading to free enzyme. The second most likely pathway is formation
  of a transiently inhibited enzyme in which the imine acyl-enzyme tautomerizes to
  yield a more stable cis- or trans-enamine (species 2 and 3, ). Finally, another
  form of inhibition arises from attack on the reactive imine by a second enzymatic
  nucleophile, S130, to form a cross-linked species in the active site that can degrade
  to an irreversibly-bound acrylate-like species (species 4, ).'
