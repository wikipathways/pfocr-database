caption: In vertebrates vision is triggered by light-dependent activation of rhodopsin
  or other visual pigments. In rod cells, this chromophore couples to a protein opsin,
  forming rhodopsin. Absorption of a photon of light by rhodopsin causes photoisomerization
  of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal. In turn, photoactivated rhodopsin generates
  activation of hundreds of heterotrimeric G proteins, called transducin or Gt, in
  photoreceptors. This G protein-coupled receptor cascade is a classic cyclic nucleotide
  pathway that results in lowering cGMP levels (not depicted on the figure), and consequently
  hyperpolarization of the plasma membranes and ultimately reduction of glutamate
  secretion to the secondary neurons. The visual cycle regenerates 11-cis-retinal
  from released all-trans-retinal from the chromophore binding pocket of opsin. All-trans-retinal
  is reduced to all-trans-retinol in a reversible reaction catalyzed by RDH12 and
  RDH8, which are NADPH-dependent all-trans-retinol dehydrogenases. All-trans-retinol
  diffuses into the RPE where it is esterified in a reaction catalyzed by lecithin:retinol
  acyl transferase to long-chain fatty acids. As a consequence of the propensity of
  retinyl esters to aggregate, these esters are stored in lipid droplet-like structures
  called retinosomes. The all-trans-retinyl esters appear to be the substrate for
  RPE65 that converts it to 11-cis-retinol, which then is further oxidized back to
  11-cis-retinal by retinol dehydrogenases, RDH5, RDH11, and other NAD-dependent retinol
  dehydrogenases. 11-cis-retinal formed in the RPE diffuses back into the ROS and
  COS, where it completes the cycle by recombining with opsins to form rhodopsin and
  cone pigments. Mutations in genes encoding proteins of phototransduction and the
  retinoid cycle are associated with various retinal diseases, some of which are indicated
  by the green boxes. Pharmacological intervention has been successful in animal models
  in a few instances, as indicated by the compounds in the blue boxes. IPM, interphotoreceptor
