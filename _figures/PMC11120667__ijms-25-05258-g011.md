caption: Proposed model of the mechanisms of action of male M. pomifera extracts on
  ER-positive MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells. (1) Plant extract activates TRPV1,
  inducing calcium influx into cells. The elevated intracellular calcium triggers
  several apoptotic pathways, the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway, extrinsic
  FAS-FADD and ERK-induced pathways, and ER-stress mediated pathway. (1a) The accumulation
  of Ca2+ into mitochondria causes the transient depolarization of mitochondrial membrane
  potential. As a result, the mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTPs)
  open and release cytochrome c (cyt c), leading to caspase activation, increasing
  proapoptotic proteins BAK/BAX, decreasing anti-apoptotic BCL-2, and leading to apoptosis.
  (1b) Calcium influx triggers the extrinsic pathway by activating FAS, FADD, caspase
  8, and caspase 3, and leading to apoptosis. It may be that plant extracts activate
  the FAS/FADD pathway directly (2). (1c) TRPV1 also activates the epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR), further activating ERK. Phosphorylated ERK then activates
  caspases by inducing mitochondrial intrinsic apoptosis. (1d) Plasma membrane TRPV1
  activation and calcium influx lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ER TRPV1
  becomes another source of calcium release in the cell. ER stress activates PERK,
  phosphorylated PERK (pPERK) activates ATF4, and ATF4 activates CHOP, leading to
  PERK-ATF4-CHOP-mediated apoptosis
