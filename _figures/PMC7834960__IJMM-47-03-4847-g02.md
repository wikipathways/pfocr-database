caption: These pathways play an important role in cell growth, proliferation, and
  homeostasis, thus, a mutation in anyone may cause cancer cell survival, division
  and metastasis. These pathways include (from left to right) the PI3K/Akt pathway
  mutation linked with over-expression of Akt, causing cell division and the inhibition
  of apoptosis is reported in 70% of CRC cases. The JAK/STAT pathway is associated
  with pro-inflammatory gene expression due to binding and activation of GAS elements;
  EGFR/MAPK pathway regulates the CREB transcription factor, and over-expression of
  EGFR is reported in CRC cases; Wnt pathway regulates the β-catenin levels in the
  cell and activate target genes such as MYC, CCND1 and AXIN2. The Notch pathway and
  associated Notch-1 have been found to be upregulated in CRC and adenocarcinomas;
  SHH pathway mutations are reported in CRC (Smo, Gli1 and Ptc); the TGF-β pathway
  is 'lost' in cancer cells, thereby resisting growth inhibition; however, later stages
  of CRC report the pathway leading to EMT.
