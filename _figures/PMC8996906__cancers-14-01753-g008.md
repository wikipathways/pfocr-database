caption: IPA-predicted activation and inhibition of the enriched regulation of epithelial
  mesenchymal transition by the growth factors pathway based on 4SC-202-induced consensus
  DEGs. The pathway is built in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and illustrates the
  known molecular relationships. The molecules are the nodes, and the edges represent
  biological relationships between these nodes supported by at least one reference
  from literature, a textbook, or canonical information in the Ingenuity Knowledge
  Base. 4SC-202-induced consensus differentially expressed genes (DEGs) driving the
  predicted changes are filled red (overexpressed) or green (underexpressed) with
  intensity based on the log fold change from Workflow 1. Molecular Activity Predictor
  (MAP)-based activations are shown in orange and inhibitions in blue. Molecules with
  no color have no predicted activity or significant differential expression. HDAC1,
  HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC8, and KDM1A were added to the network, and their known interactions
  based on the Ingenuity Knowledge Base are indicated by arrows. Shapes of nodes represent
  the functional class of the gene product. A more detailed legend for node shapes
  and relationships can be found at https://qiagen.secure.force.com/KnowledgeBase/articles/BasicTechnicalQA/Legend,
