caption: Abbreviated versions of the cerebral 24-hydroxylase (left) and acidic (right)
  pathways of bile acid biosynthesis. Enzymes, metabolites, and reactions of the 24-hydroxylase
  pathway are indicated in blue, those of the acidic pathway are in green. Enzymes/genes
  expressed in the brain, and metabolites observed, in CSF are in bold. CoA intermediates
  are observed as the unconjugated acids in CSF. Italics indicate that the named structure
  is one of a number of possibilities. The broken arrows indicate a reaction leading
  to elimination of C-27. Thick coloured arrows pointing upwards or downwards indicate
  significant positive or negative correlations even when the confounding variables
  are considered. Red triangles indicate significance ignoring confounding variables,
  in at least one of the two studies. The full stereochemistry and numbering system
  for cholesterol is indicated. Abbreviated structures are shown for other sterols
  ignoring ring-stereochemistry.
