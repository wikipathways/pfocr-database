caption: 'The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Left (red arrows): In the absence of
  Wnt ligand, β-catenin is bound by the destruction complex consisting of the scaffolding
  proteins Axin and Adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC), and the protein kinases Glycogen
  synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and Casein kinase I (Csnk1), and sequentially phosphorylated
  by these kinases. Phosphorylated β-catenin binds to and is ubiquitinated by the
  E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP, thereby targeting it for proteasomal degradation. In
  the absence of Wnt ligand, lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (Lef1) or T cell-specific
  (TCF) transcription factors are bound to the promoters of Wnt target genes in the
  cell nucleus together with co-repressors of the Groucho/transducin-like enhancer
  of split (Tle) family proteins, thereby repressing their expression. Right (green
  arrows): On binding of Wnt ligand to the Frizzled (Fzd) receptor and low-density
  lipoprotein receptor-related protein (Lrp) co-receptor complex, Axin and GSK3β are
  recruited to the cell membrane via Dishevelled (Dvl) and the destruction complex
  falls apart. Unphosphorylated β-catenin accumulates in the cytosol and translocates
  into the nucleus, where it binds to the Lef1/TCF transcription factors and activates
  Wnt target genes by displacing the co-repressors and recruiting co-activators to
  this complex. Properties of Lef1/Tcf binding sites in the promoters of known Wnt
  target genes, i.e. the number of conserved Lef1/Tcf binding sites as well as the
  averaged matrix similarity, were used to train a classifier and to predict direct
  or indirect interactions of potentially new target genes and Lef1/Tcf transcription
  factors in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.'
