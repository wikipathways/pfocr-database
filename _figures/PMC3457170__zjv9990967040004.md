caption: JAK/STAT signaling pathway is targeted by RVFV NSs protein at different levels.
  The promoter regions of several genes participating in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway
  were identified during ChIP-on-chip experiments as interacting with NSs (gray ovals).
  Genes whose expression was statistically significantly downregulated after RVFV
  ZH infection compared with RVFV ZHΔNSs infection (identified as in ) are shown in
  gray ovals outlined in red. P, phosphate; IFNAR1, IFN-α/β receptor 1; IRF9, interferon
  regulatory factor 9; ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element; ISGs, interferon-stimulated
  genes; PKR, protein kinase R; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, Jun
  N-terminal protein kinase; Mapk8ip3, mitogen-activated protein kinase 8-interacting
  protein 3.
