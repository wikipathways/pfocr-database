caption: 'The biosynthesis and physiological roles of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) and UDP-Gal-UDP-Glc
  and UDP-Gal are utilized in many biosynthetic pathways: GlcCerS, glucosylceramide
  synthase; UGDH, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase; GS, glycogen synthase; DPGS, dolichol-P-glucose
  synthase. UDP-Glc is generated from either UDP-Gal by UDP-galactose 4-epimerase
  (GALE) or from glucose-1-phosphate (Glc1P) and UTP by UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase
  (UGP). The synthesis of UDP-Gal via the Leloir pathway (blue arrows) itself requires
  UDP-Glc. After transport into the cell, galactose (Gal) is phosphorylated by galactokinase
  (GALK1) to yield galactose-1-phosphate (Gal1P), which in turn is converted into
  UDP-Gal by galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT), whose uridyl donor is
  UDP-Glc. UGP deficiency could potentially provoke increased fluxing of Glc-6-P through
  the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway to yield increases in cellular UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc
  (UDP-HexNAc). The bold arrows represent single reaction steps whereas normal arrows
  indicate pathways involving several steps.'
