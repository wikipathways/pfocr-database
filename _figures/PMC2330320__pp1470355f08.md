caption: Interactions between genetic pathways controlling seasonal induction of flowering
  in temperate cereals. VRN2 represses FT1 to counteract PPD1 dependent long-day induction
  of FT1 prior to winter. Prolonged exposure to low temperatures up-regulates VRN1,
  which promotes inflorescence meristem identity at the shoot apex, accelerating inflorescence
  initiation independently of the long-day response pathway. VRN1 also represses VRN2
  in the leaves to allow the long-day induction of FT1. FT1 can further accelerate
  inflorescence initiation and also subsequent stages of inflorescence development.
  According to this model, VRN1 acts in a low-temperature response pathway, FT1 acts
  in a daylength response pathway, and VRN2 integrates the low-temperature and daylength
  responses. In varieties where VRN2 is deleted, or where dominant VRN3 alleles are
  present, increased FT1 expression accelerates inflorescence initiation. This induces
  expression of VRN1 (dotted line).
