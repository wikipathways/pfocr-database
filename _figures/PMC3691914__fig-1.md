caption: Overview of energy metabolism. The scheme shows the relevant pathways involved
  in the metabolism of glucose and glutamine (blue lines). Glucose is catabolized
  by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to obtain reducing power (NADPH) and ribose
  for nucleic acid biosynthesis and oxidize by glycolysis to generate pyruvate and
  other metabolic intermediates. In the cytoplasm, the generated pyruvate can be reduced
  to lactate and further exported from the cell or completely oxidized in the mitochondria
  by the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). The transfer of electrons obtained
  in oxidations (NADH/FADH2) to molecular oxygen by respiratory complexes (green)
  of the inner mitochondrial membrane is depicted by light blue lines. The formation
  of the proton gradient generated by respiration and its utilization for the synthesis
  of ATP by the H+-ATP synthase in oxidative phosphorylation is highlighted by a red
  circuit. The entrance of ADP in exchange with ATP by the adenine nucleotide translocase
  (ANT) and inorganic phosphate is also shown (yellow lines). Metabolic activity utilizes
  carbon skeletons, NADPH, and ATP. To see this illustration in color, the reader
  is referred to the web version of this article at www.liebertpub.com/ars
