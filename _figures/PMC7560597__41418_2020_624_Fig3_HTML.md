caption: Activation of the cGAS–STING pathway by mitochondrial DNA results in production
  of IFN and TNF. Binding of IFN to IFNAR1 and TNF to TNFR1 can results in RIPK1–RIPK3
  activation, when caspase-8 is inhibited. RIPK1–RIPK3 activates MLKL to execute necroptosis.
  Moreover, IFN upregulates RIPK3 and MLKL expression. It would be interesting to
  understand if STING agonists can initiate necroptosis to limit tumor growth when
  apoptotic caspases are usually inhibited in cancer cells. Green arrow indicate upregulation.
