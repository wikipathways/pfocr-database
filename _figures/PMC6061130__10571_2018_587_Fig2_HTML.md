caption: a Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) directs PINK1 towards OMM. PINK1
  is continuously imported into mitochondria through the TOM/TIM complexes and subsequently
  targeting signal is cleaved and degraded by PARL and MPP, respectively. The truncated
  PINK1 is degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system; b collapse of ΔΨ blocks the
  TOM/TIM import pathway. PINK1 becomes stable on the OMM and recruits Parkin and
  activates its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity through the phosphorylation of Parkin
  on Ser65
