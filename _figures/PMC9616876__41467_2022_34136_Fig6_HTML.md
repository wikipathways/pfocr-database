caption: 'The general function of CcmABCD is to attach heme to the periplasmic heme
  chaperone, CcmE, in the System I cyt c maturation pathway. Structures presented
  here provide the molecular basis for this function. The hypothetical cycle begins
  (#1) with CcmABCD containing all substrates: heme liganded by CcmC P-His1 and P-His2,
  the His130E adduct to vinyl 2 of heme, and two ATP molecules bound by a CcmA dimer
  in the closed NBD state. The structures represented by #1 to #4 are discussed in
  the text, whereby hydrolysis of ATP leads to the CcmB:CcmC interaction that pulls
  P-His2 (and the CcmC outer TM5) towards CcmB1. This in turn allows the Tyr134E to
  ligand the heme iron (i.e., a P-His2 to Tyr134E ligand switch) and release as holoCcmE
  (see #4). Note that the conformational changes induced by ATP hydrolysis that lead
  to major movements of CcmC P-His2/TM5 could occur at #2 or #3. See Supplementary
  Movie  for a 30 s representation using the structures for the cycle and ATPase-based
  release of holoCcmE.'
