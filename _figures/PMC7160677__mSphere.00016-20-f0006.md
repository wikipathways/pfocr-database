caption: Scheme of AA on the metabolism pathways of C. albicans. Glucose penetrates
  the plasma membrane and is metabolized by glycolysis and converted into pyruvate
  and acetyl-CoA in the cytosol. Acetyl-CoA is involved in the biosynthesis of ergosterol
  and farnesol and fatty acids. Moreover, glucose is fed in the pentose phosphate
  pathway, and erythritol, arabitol, and acetate are synthesized. Also, pyruvate enters
  the mitochondrion and initiates the TCA cycle; alanine and aspartate are produced.
  Letters in yellow show downregulation, whereas letters in white show upregulation.
