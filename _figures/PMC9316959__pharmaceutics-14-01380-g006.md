caption: Regulation of glucose metabolism by miR-122 in hepatocellular carcinoma.
  miR-122 targets ALDOA and PKM2 in the glycolysis pathway. ALDOA is one of the key
  regulators in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, wherein its levels increase
  under hypoxic conditions in HCC cells. PKM2 is responsible for aerobic glycolysis,
  which is a prominent characteristic of cancer cells. PPP is activated in cancer
  cells, and G6PC is the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-determining step in the activation
  of PPP. CS catalyzes the biosynthesis of citrate, which is a key enzyme in fatty
  acid synthesis in HCC. G6PC3 is one of the isotypes of G6P that produces glucose
  from glucose 6-phosphate in the gluconeogenesis pathway. GYS1 mediates the synthesis
  of glycogen. Although G6PC3 and GYS1 are direct targets of miR-122 in HCC, the functional
  link of these enzymes to HCC is not clear yet.
