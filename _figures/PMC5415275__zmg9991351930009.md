caption: Model of the putative role of central insulin resistance in attenuating leptin
  modulation of rHypoE-19 hypothalamic neurons. Chronic insulin stimulation attenuates
  activity of the PI3K pathway by hindering phosphorylation of Akt that may be required
  leptin-mediated transcriptional regulation of neurons. In addition, chronic stimulation
  of the insulin receptor may lead to an increase in SOCS3 protein levels, which are
  known to hinder both leptin and insulin signal transduction by dephosphorylation
  of the insulin receptor, JAK, STAT, and IRS proteins. This may, in part, account
  for the observed decrease in leptin-induced phosphorylation of Akt and STAT3 after
  induction of insulin resistance.
