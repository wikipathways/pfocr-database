caption: Action model for the activation of eHsp and proinflammatory cytokines. (A)
  In healthy neonates at term, eHsp-27 modulates the expression of the protein inhibitor
  (Ikβ) reducing the activity of the nuclear factor-kappa β (NFkβ) pathway (, ), modulating
  the inflammatory response (, ), oxidative stress (), and action of matrix metalloproteinases-9
  (MMP-9) (, ). (B) During the infections process, the inflammatory response is activated
  which reduces the expression of eHsp-27, increased the expression of eHsp-60, eHsp-70,
  and NFkβ and finally increases the secretion of IL-1β, TNFα, and MMP-9 (, , ).
