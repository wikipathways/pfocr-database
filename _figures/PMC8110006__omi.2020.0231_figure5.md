caption: Comparison of pathway outcomes between normal and cancer conditions. On the
  left (A) is a schematic of events when HOTAIR is expressed. When HOTAIR is expressed,
  WIF1 and CD82 are silenced; thus, the Wnt Pathway and metastatic pathways are active.
  In this case, when HOTAIR is expressed on the right (B), the SNPs in WIF1 and CD82
  may be preventing HOTAIR from silencing. In normal cases when WIF1 and SFRP4 are
  expressed, they may bear competing with CRNDE and UCA1 to either inhibit or activate
  the WNT ligands. What is observed in the samples is that and CRNDE and UCA1 are
  activating the WNT ligands for the Wnt pathway to be active. In addition, CRNDE
  may be negatively regulating SFRP4, which may be a contributing factor to the inability
  of SFRP4 to inhibit the WNT ligands. The x's indicates this gene contains an SNP
  found in IGV. WIF1—WIF1-S1 (rs7301320); WNT5A—WNT5A-3 (rs669889); UCA1—UCA1-IV (rs7258210);
