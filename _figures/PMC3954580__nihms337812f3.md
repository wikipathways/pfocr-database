caption: MEK5/ERK5 pathway is activated by cell stressors, mitogens or cytokines.
  Once stimulated, MEKK2 or MEKK3 will phosphorylate MEK5 on its serine 311 and threonine
  315 residues(). MEK5 then phosphorylates the threonine 218 and tyrosine 220 residues
  of ERK5(). Upon activation, ERK5 can phosphorylate downstream target molecules such
  as Sap1, cFOS, c-Myc and MEF2 or autophosphorylate its carboxyl-terminal region
  which contains a NLS region (nuclear localization signal) allowing ERK5 to shuttle
  from the cytosol to the nucleus. This gives ERK5 two possible mechanisms for signaling;
  either by activating downstream molecules or potentially acting directly as a transcription
  factor (, ).
