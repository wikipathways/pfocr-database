caption: Schematic model of DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathway and DDR inhibitors
  used in clinical settings. In response to DNA damage, the PARP protein increases
  and rearranges DNA damage. In conjunction with the MRN complex, comprising MRE11,
  RAD50, and NBS1, ATM phosphorylates both CHK2 and TP53. ATM-dependent CHK2 phosphorylation
  promotes the subsequent CHK2-dependent phosphorylation of numerous downstream substrates
  such as p53, CDC25C, PML, and a complex of DNA-damage signal effectors, BRCA1/2,
  PALB2, RAD51, and BARD. CHK2 regulates several cellular processes, such as cell
  cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA synthesis and repair. ATR and CHK1 are activated
  by junctions between single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).
  These genes constitute the main signal for DNA repair mechanisms. CHK1 may also
  be activated by ATM. These genes collectively regulate cell cycle checkpoint response
  and apoptosis
