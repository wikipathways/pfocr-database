caption: Dynamic changes occur in T cell metabolism upon T cell activation, highlighting
  the shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis during activation. This metabolic reprogramming
  supports the rapid proliferation and increased functionality of effector T cells
  in response to inflammatory signals. Resting T cells, shown on the left side, predominantly
  utilize OXPHOS as their main energy source, relying on the mitochondria for efficient
  ATP production in a low-energy demand state. On the right side, activated T cells
  exhibit a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, which enables T cells to generate
  ATP more rapidly to meet the increased energy demands of proliferation and effector
  functions
