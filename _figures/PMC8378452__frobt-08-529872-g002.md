caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed feed-forward collision prediction
  visual neural networks. There are three layers pre-synaptic to the two neurons,
  the photoreceptor (P), lamina (LA) and medulla (ME) layers. The pre-synaptic neural
  networks of LGMD-1 and LGMD-2 share the same visual processing in the first two,
  P and LA layers. The processing yet differs in the third ME layer for the purpose
  of separating their different selectivity. The ME layer consists of ON/OFF channels
  wherein the ON channels are rigorously suppressed in the LGMD-2’s circuit (dashed
  lines). The delayed information is formed by convolving surrounding non-delayed
  signals in space. The FFI is an individual inhibition pathway to merely the LGMD-1.
  The PM is a mediation pathway to the medulla layer of the LGMD-2. The two LGMDs
  pool their pre-synaptic signals respectively to generate spikes that are passed
  to their post-synaptic neurons. Notably, the non-linearly mapped, hybrid firing
  rate is the network output deciding the corresponding collision avoidance response.
