caption: The proposed schematic diagram of RLIP76 role in angiogenesis. In response
  to pro-angiogenic factors stimulation, RLIP76 mainly participates in mediating the
  activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway that induces further activation of HIF-1.
  The activation of HIF-1 is required for promoting the VEGF expression that is essential
  for angiogenesis and cell migration and spreading. In addition, RLIP76 actively
  participates in regulating Rac1 and Arf6 signaling pathway that heavily contributes
  to cell spreading and migration. Thus, RLIP76 plays an important role as a critical
  link in a small GTPases downstream effect in response to membrane transduction of
  pro-angiogenic factors in which is vital for tumor angiogenesis
