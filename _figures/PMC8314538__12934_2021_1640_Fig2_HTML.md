caption: Metabolic pathway of TAG synthesis from glucose. Reactions that were investigated
  in this study and had a positive effect on TAG accumulation are colored. Pathway
  reactions that were upregulated are shown in green. For Ckb1p, which is not encoding
  a metabolic enzyme, we assume a repressing effect on the activities of Sct1p and
  possibly Pah1p through phosphorylation, in the case of Pah1p antagonistic to the
  Nem1p/Spo7p phosphatase complex (see main text). Competing pathways, which were
  partially blocked, are depicted in red. The mutated variant of Acc1p, together with
  an overexpression of DGA1 and the deletion of CKB1, GSY2, ARE2 and TGL3 (framed
  reactions) resulted in a strain with 65% TAG content. Dashed lines several reactions,
  straight lines single reactions, G3P glucose-3-phosphate, FFA free fatty acids,
  DAG diacylglycerol
