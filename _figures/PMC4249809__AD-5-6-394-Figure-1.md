caption: Role of TGF-beta in healthy and OA cartilage. TGFβ signals through TβRII
  and ALK5 in young and healthy cartilage eliciting chondrogenic factors. In aged
  or AO cartilage, TβRII and ALK5 breakdown occurs while ALK1 expression is enhanced.
  Therefore, TGFβ signalling shifts from Smad2/3 to Smad 1/5/8 leading to COL10 and
  MMP13 expression.
