caption: BRAF-specific inhibitors block the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway in BRAFV600E
  mutant cells. However, tumor cells acquire resistance to this therapy during the
  course of treatment. Several mechanisms that involve reactivation of ERK signaling
  through amplification or mutation of proteins in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway (i.e.
  NRAS, BRAF, CRAF and COT1) have been recently described for the development of acquired
  resistance. In addition, hyper-activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (i.e.
  through upregulation of IGF-1R or PDGFRβ) can also be involved in resistance by
  promoting survival or proliferation. BRAFV600E suppresses the LKB1 tumor suppressor
  and AMPK through the BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade, and this regulation is critical
  for melanoma cell proliferation.
