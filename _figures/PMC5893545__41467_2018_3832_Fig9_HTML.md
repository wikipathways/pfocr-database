caption: Model for the NIGT1-centred transcriptional cascade. a Model for the transcriptional
  cascade that modulates nitrate uptake in response to fluctuations in the nitrate
  condition. Nitrate activates NLP, which directly upregulates both the NRT2.1 and
  NIGT1-clade gene promoters. Thus, NRT2.1 expression is initially activated (1) and
  then repressed by expression of NIGT1-clade genes (2). Increases in NRT2.1 expression
  lead to enhanced uptake of nitrate as a substrate for nitrate assimilation and also
  a signal for activating NLP. The expression level of NRT2.1 is modulated by the
  balance of these positive and negative regulatory loops. b Model for the transcriptional
  cascade that integrates nitrate and P-starvation signalling pathways. When P nutrient
  (phosphate) is abundant, PHR1 is kept inactive by the SPX–inositol polyphosphate
  (*) complex. Thus, the nitrate-NLP cascade activates the NRT2.1 promoter independently
  of the PHR1 pathway. Upon P depletion, PHR1 is freed and enhances the expression
  of NIGT1-clade genes, leading to reductions in both NRT2.1 expression and nitrate
  uptake
