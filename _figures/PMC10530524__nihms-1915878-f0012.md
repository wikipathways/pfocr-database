caption: GpsB(Spn) and possibly other ligands, such as Lipid II, stimulate the phosphorylation
  of a negative regulator of MurZ(Spn) and MurA(Spn) enzymatic activity, but not their
  cellular amounts, in the first committed step of Lipid II synthesis for PG synthesis.
  By genetic criteria presented here, the negative regulator is unphosphorylated IreB(Spn).
  Phosphorylated IreB(Spn)~P does not bind to MurZ(Spn) or MurA(Spn), resulting in
  full enzymatic activity in pneumococcal cells growing exponentially in rich media.
  The absence of GpsB(Spn) significantly reduces phosphorylation of IreB(Spn) leading
  to inhibition of MurZ(Spn) and MurA(Spn) enzymatic activities and no growth. This
  inhibition can be relieved by inactivation of the cognate PhpP protein phosphatase,
  which allows residual phosphorylation to IreB(Spn)~P. The absence of the StkP protein
  kinase and the need for protein phosphorylation in pneumococcal cells growing exponentially
  in rich media can be suppressed by inactivation or absence of the IreB(Spn) negative
  regulator, by amino-acid changes in a regulatory domain of MurZ(Spn), which is enzymatically
  predominant over MurA(Spn), or by overexpression of murZ(Spn) or murA(Spn) in spontaneous
  chromosomal duplications. Moderate MurZ(Spn) overproduction sufficient to suppress
  the absence of StkP also occurs in the absence of the KhpAB RNA-binding protein,
  which also negatively regulates FtsA amount. This pathway provides a positive feedback
  loop, such that cells growing rapidly in rich media produce Lipid II, which may
  activate StkP(Spn) to fully phosphorylate IreB(Spn) and maximize MurZ(Spn) and MurA(Spn)
  enzymatic activities for the production of even more Lipid II for PG synthesis.
  Evidence for the direct interaction between unphosphorylated IreB(Spn) and MurZ(Spn)
  will be presented elsewhere (Merrin Joseph, unpublished result). Structures predicted
  by AlphaFold v2.0 also suggest that MurZ(Spn) and MurA(Spn) enzymatic activity is
  subject to negative pathway feedback inhibition by binding of UDP-MurNAc (UDP-N-acetylmuramic
  acid) near the catalytic sites of the enzymes (, ). See text for additional details.
