caption: 'Canonical three-signal activation model for T cells. Activation is dependent
  on integration of three signals: 1) recognition by the T-cell receptor (TCR) of
  an antigen presented as a peptide by the major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)
  on antigen-presenting cells (APCs); 2) costimulation, which lowers the stimulation
  threshold of naïve T cells, prevents anergy, and enhances cytokine production; and
  3) cytokine signaling along the JAK-STAT pathway, which amplifies the clonal expansion,
  survival, and differentiation of T cells. These converging cellular signaling cascades
  influence the activation and differentiation status of T lymphocytes, in this case,
  CD8+ T cells. Adapted from “Three Signals Required for T cell Activation”, by BioRender.com
