caption: Scheme of the possible interaction of the RAS and RAGE signaling pathways.
  Binding of the virus to ACE2 leads to an increase in the level of ANGII, its interaction
  with AT1R, followed by transactivation of the RAGE cytosolic domain and activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which stimulates the expression of pro-inflammatory
  genes, including RAGE and one of the central RAGE ligands, HMGB1; after exiting
  the cell HMGB1 interacts with the RAGE extracellular domain and restarts the process
  mediated by NF-κB activation.
