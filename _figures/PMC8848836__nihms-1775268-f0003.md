  for 17-OH PREG through a Peroxoanion Intermediate,, versus the Possibility of C-C
  Scission Mediated by Compound I (Black and Green Arrows)aaAn analogous scheme applies
  to 17OH-PROG, with the caveat that the 17-OH hydrogen bond is directed toward the
  terminal oxygen of the Fe-O-O fragment of the peroxo intermediate.
