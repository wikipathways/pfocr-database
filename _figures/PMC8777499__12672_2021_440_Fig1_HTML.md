caption: 'Schematic representation of the one-carbon metabolism. The schematic image
  describes biochemical pathway involved in serine and glycine biosynthesis and in
  one carbon metabolism, a group of reactions necessary to production of proteins,
  purines, thymidylate, methionine, cysteine, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) and glutathione.
  Regarding one-carbon units, the current image shows a strong metabolic connection
  between cytoplasmatic, and mitochondrial enzymes involved in THF production, serine
  de novo biosynthesis and serine and glycine catabolism. Cytoplasmatic enzymes: PHGDH
  phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, PSAT1 phosphoserine aminotransferase 1, PSPH phosphoserine
  phosphatase, SHMT1 serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1; mitochondrial enzymes: SHMT2
  serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2, MTHFD1 methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase1,
  MTHFD2 methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase2, MTHFD2L methylenetetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase NADP+ dependent 2 like, GCS glycine cleavage system. Biochemical compounds:
  3-PG 3-phospoglycerate, 3-PP 3-phosphopyruvate, 3-PS 3-phosposerine, THF tetrahydrofolate,
  5,10-me-THF 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, 5-me-THF 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate,
  10-f-THF 10-formate-tetrahydrofolate'
