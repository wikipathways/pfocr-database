caption: 'APP is a transmembrane protein which can be processed by either the non-amyloidogenic
  or amyloidogenic pathways. Upper Panel: During non-amyloidogenic processing, an
  enzymatic activity called α-secretase cleaves APP (1) to generate a soluble N-terminal
  fragment (sAPPα) and an 83 amino acid C-terminal fragment (C83). Next, the γ-secretase
  complex (2), with PS1 acting as the catalytic subunit, cleaves the C83 fragment
  within the transmembrane domain, releasing a secreted peptide known as P3. Lower
  Panel: In amyloidogenic processing, an enzymatic activity called β-secretase (1)
  cleaves APP to generate different soluble N-terminal (sAPPβ) and C-terminal (C99)
  fragments. Cleavage of the C99 fragment by γ-secretase (2) results in the generation
  of the Aβ peptide. Processing of APP in either pathway results in the production
  of an APP intracellular domain (AICD) with poorly defined function.'
