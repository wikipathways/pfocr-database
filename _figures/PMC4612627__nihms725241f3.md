caption: A simplified model of a cell signaling process highlighting the flow from
  signals generated externally by epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the activation
  or repression of transcription. In addition, potential feedback in the form of expression
  of signaling repressor proteins is shown. Drivers that would make useful targets
  for intervention could lie anywhere within a pathway and be themselves the result
  of different molecular events (e.g., promoter methylation, mutation, gene amplification)
