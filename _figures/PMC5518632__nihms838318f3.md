caption: NLRC5-dependent MHC class I expression is essential for CD8+ T-cell-mediated
  anti-tumor responses. NLRC5 induces the expression of genes encoding critical components
  in the MHC class I pathway, which is essential for the cancer antigen presentation
  and recruitment/activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. This anti-tumor immunity usually
  works effectively and cancer cells are eliminated at the early stage of development.
  Even if tumors are formed, patients have good prognosis. However, aberrant genetic
  and epigenetic changes in NLRC5 may occur during the evolution of cancer cells.
  Mutations, copy number loss or promoter methylation of NLRC5 cause impaired MHC
  class I antigen presentation due to reduced expression of HLA-A, -B, -C, B2M, LMP2,
  7 and TAP1. These changes result in diminished anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell responses
  and a reduced infiltration in cancer tissues. Cancer cells, upon successful immune
  evasion, can achieve efficient tumor growth, leading to poor prognosis of the patients.
  Survival curves were generated for melanoma, with a high NLRC5 expression quartile
  group (pink line) and a low quartile group (blue line) [].
