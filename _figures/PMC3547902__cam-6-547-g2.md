caption: Figure 2. Schematic representation of molecular complexes involving neuropilins
  of the plasma membrane of cancer and/or endothelial cells. (A) Interaction between
  VEGF and neuropilin/VEGF receptor complexes; (B) interaction between class3 semaphorin
  and neuropilin/plexin complexes; (D) interaction between VEGF and neuropilin/integrin
  complexes. Oligomerization of NRPs molecule is induced by VEGF or SEMA3A as mentioned
  in  via MAM domain (yellow box). NRPs forms complex with VEGFR (A) or plexin (B)
  to induce angiogenesis or repulsion and apoptosis. (C) Competition between VEGF
  and class3 semaphorin for neuropilin binding and activation of signaling pathway.
  Competition of VEGF and SEMA3A occurs at the level of b1 domain in NRP1. This mechanism
  is particularly relevant in tumor cell migration. (D) NRPs also participate in cell
  adhesion via α5β1, αvβ5 and α6β1 integrins. NRPs can also induce independent activities
  via interaction of the SEA domain with NIP/GIPS.
