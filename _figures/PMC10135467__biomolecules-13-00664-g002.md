caption: Illustration of the regulatory network of METTL3 in the nervous system. The
  targets and signaling pathways of METTL3 in neurophysiological and neuropathological
  events are summarized. We found that low expression of METTL3 exhibits different
  effects, which exert beneficial roles to promote neurological events such as promoting
  neurogenesis, while possibly exacerbating neuropathological events, such as worsening
  GBM. Blue wording, targets. Purple wording, signaling pathways. Solid box, neurophysiological
  events. Dotted box, neuropathological events. METTL3, methyltransferase-like3; METTL3
  downregulation facilitated glioma (GBM) occurrence by altering the PI3K/Akt pathway,
  and promoted glioma development via activating the Notch pathway that targeted NOTCH3,
  DLL3, and HES1; AD, METTL3 downregulation worsens Aβ-induced synaptic damage in
  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) via m6A signaling that is mainly targeted to upregulation
  of PSD95; downregulation of METTL3 significantly affected angiogenesis of human
  endothelial cells in arteriovenous malformation (AVM) by reducing the level of hNotch
  E3ue and activating the Notch signaling pathway; METTL3 downregulation participates
  in sevoflurane-induced postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) via suppressing
  the MAPK/ERK pathway that targeted BDNF, SOX2, and SYN1; METTL3 downregulation triggered
  traumatic brain injury (TBI) development via the MAPK signaling pathway that downregulated
  SOX21 expression; NP, METTL3 downregulation triggers neuropathic pain (NP) occurrence
  via the miR-150/BDNF pathway; METTL3 downregulation triggers acute ischemic stroke
  (AIS) occurrence via the miR-335/Erf1 axis. NOTCH3, Notch homolog 3; DLL3, Delta-like
  3; PSD95, postsynaptic density protein 95; hNotch E3ue, heterodimeric Notch E3 ubiquitin
  ligase; BDNF, neurotrophic factor; SYN1, synapsin 1; IEGs, immediate early genes;
  Ezh2, enhancer of Zeste homolog 2.
