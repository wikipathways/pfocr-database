caption: 'NGF signaling pathways in mediating neurotrophic and nociceptor effects.Notes:
  NGF signals through the high-affinity TrkA and low p75NTR receptors. TrkA activates
  both PI3 kinase (PI3K) and Ras pathways, which lead to cell survival and neurite
  outgrowth. Signaling through p75NTR leads to apoptosis, which is blocked by the
  TrkA-activated PI3K pathway. PI3K activation also leads to activation of the nonselective
  cation channel TRPV1 by phosphorylation, thereby generating action potential for
  nociceptive functions. Moreover, TRPV1 phosphorylation results in increased translocation
  of TRPV1 to the plasma membrane to enhance channel activity. Antibody-mediated NGF
  blockade results in the abolition of both neurotrophic and nociceptor functions.Abbreviation:
  NGF, nerve growth factor.'
