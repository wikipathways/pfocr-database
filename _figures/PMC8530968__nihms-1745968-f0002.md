caption: a | Target innervation is a carefully orchestrated process that encompasses
  axon specification, elongation, pathfinding, and branching in end-organs and involves
  the combined effects of autocrine and paracrine secreted factors. Autocrine hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF) signalling initiates axon extension (1) and axons extend along
  blood vessels in response to vascular-derived guidance signals, artemin, neurotrophin
  3 (NT3) and endothelin 3 (2, 3). Axons undergo terminal branching and growth to
  fully innervate NGF-expressing final targets (4). b | Target-derived nerve growth
  factor (NGF) promotes target innervation by activating local cytoskeletal and endocytic
  pathways in axons and retrogradely regulating transcriptional events in cell bodies
  and/or nuclei. NGF-mediated axon growth also relies on local protein synthesis of
  effectors, including Impa1 and Rac1, and also post-translational lipidation of newly
  synthesized proteins in distal axons. Tp53inp2 is an axonally abundant mRNA that
  mediates NGF-dependent growth in a non-coding manner. Retrograde NGF signalling
  via axonal transport of TrkA-signalling endosomes activates transcription factors
  and the expression of downstream target genes essential for long-term axon growth
  and target innervation. c | NGF signalling regulates autocrine signalling loops
  to promote innervation of peripheral organs. NGF induces Wnt5a synthesis in sympathetic
  neurons and autocrine Wnt signalling through Ror1/2 receptors promotes axon branching.
  In tissues with low NGF expression, such as the thymus, autocrine CD40L signalling
  via the CD40 receptor promotes axon branching and innervation. This pathway is downregulated
  when axons encounter high NGF levels in tissues such as the salivary glands. d |
  Axon pruning occurs by competitive collateral elimination mediated by the actions
  of the p75 and DR6 receptors. Activity-dependent brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF) release by ‘winning’ axons activates p75 to antagonize TrkA trophic signalling
  in ‘losing’ axons. p75 also promotes actin remodelling and intracellular Ca2+ increase
  to induce degenerative signalling. The actions of DR6 and axonal caspase signalling
  are also required for axon loss. e | Postganglionic sympathetic neurons form non-canonical
  synapses with peripheral tissues. Sympathetic synapses resemble bouton like-structures
  loaded with norepinephrine (NE). The formation of synaptic contacts between sympathetic
  neurons and peripheral tissue as well as neurotransmitter synthesis and release
  are regulated by NGF signalling. Egr3, early growth response 3; SCG, superior cervical
  ganglia.
