caption: Signalling pathways that regulate osteoblastogenesis. Osteoblastogenesis
  is tightly controlled by numerous signaling pathways that regulate the activity
  of key osteogenic transcription factors, such as Runt-related transcription factor
  2 (RUNX2), which are essential for bone regeneration and remodeling. Signaling pathways,
  including Hippo, Notch, Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), Wnt, Hedgehog, and Fibroblast
  Growth Factors (FGFs), play a distinct role in regulating osteogenesis, by either
  promoting or inhibiting the expression of the gene coding for RUNX2. The canonical
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway is one of the most well-known pathways that positively regulates
  osteogenesis. Upon binding of Wnt ligands to their receptors (WNTr), β-catenin is
  stabilized, preventing its degradation. This stabilization allows β-catenin to accumulate
  in the nucleus, where it promotes the transcription of genes involved in osteoblast
  differentiation, including RUNX2. Identical outcomes occur when BMP or FGFs bind
  to their receptors (BMPr and FGFr, respectively), activating the transcription of
  the messenger RNA coding for RUNX2. Similarly, Hedgehog signaling, modulated by
  the Smoothened (Smo) and Patched1 (PTCH1) receptors, also supports RUNX2 activity.
  Hedgehog signaling is crucial not only for osteoblast differentiation but also for
  the regulation of bone development and tissue maintenance. It interacts with various
  cellular processes to ensure that osteoblast differentiation occurs properly during
  skeletal development. On the other hand, Notch signaling exerts a negative regulatory
  effect on osteogenesis. Upon ligand activation, the Notch receptor interacts with
  the transcription factor Hey1, which inhibits RUNX2 activity and thus affects both
  cell differentiation and bone remodeling. This impact of this pathway in bone biology
  underscores its importance in regulating the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast
  activity, ensuring proper bone turnover. Another pathway that influences osteoblast
  differentiation is the Hippo signaling pathway. This pathway regulates cell proliferation
  and survival. It can negatively impact osteolastogenesis by inhibiting the Yes-associated
  protein (YAP) and the transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ).
  When the Hippo pathway is activated, the YAP/TAZ protein pair remains inactive in
  the cytoplasm, thus preventing osteoblast differentiation. In contrast, when the
  extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness increases, integrins cluster and induce the
  formation of F-actin stress fibers, leading to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into
  the nucleus (represented as a green dashed line), where they activate the expression
  of genes associated with osteoblast differentiation, such as RUNX2. The mechanical
  properties of the ECM (particularly its stiffness) play a crucial role in regulating
  YAP/TAZ activity. In contrast with a stiff ECM, a softer ECM inhibits the activation
  of YAP/TAZ, thus preventing osteoblast differentiation. This mechanosensitive regulation
  highlights the importance of biomechanical forces in the fine-tuning of osteoblastogenesis,
  a critical step in bone remodeling and regeneration
