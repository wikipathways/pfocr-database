caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of actin cytoskeleton signaling in the Xenopus
  laevis whole brain after exposure to the predatory salamander larva, Hynobius lichenatus.
  Actin cytoskeleton signaling after 24 h of predation (24 h group). The microtubule
  dynamics shown in the boxes labeled Ex6hr (after 6 h of predation), Ex10days (after
  10 h of predation), and Ex5days-Out (after 5 days of predation, followed by 5 days
  with no predation) in the top right corner, were predicted from the actin cytoskeleton
  signaling. The microtubule dynamics in Ex24hr were predicted to be up regulated
  in the signal transduction map. Blue indicates downregulation and orange indicates
  upregulation of the microtubule dynamics, compared with the control. The predictions
  were performed using two statistical measures, an overlapping p‐value, and an activation
  z-score, that were computed for each potential transcriptional regulator. This figure
  was created using Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) version 2.1, QIAGEN; (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis).
