caption: 'The scheme summarizes metabolic pathways identified so far in the glycosomes
  of Leishmania and T. brucei. EC numbers of enzymes identified only in the Leishmania
  glycosome are indicated in black boxes with white text, those identified only in
  T. brucei are indicated in italics, and those found in the glycosome of both species
  are indicated in bold. Predicted transport processes across the glycosomal membrane
  are indicated by the circled question marks and dashed arrows. Letters in black
  circles indicate the different metabolic pathways as follows: A: glycolysis; B:
  succinic fermentation; C: pentose phosphate pathway; D: superoxide and trypanothione
  metabolism; E: purine salvage; F: pyrimidine metabolism; G: mannose metabolism;
  H: glycerolipid biosynthesis; I: β-oxidation of fatty acids; L: phosphoarginine
  metabolism; M: mevalonate pathway; N: phospholipid degradation. Abbreviations used
  are: Acyl-GPC, 1-acyl-glycero-phosphocholine; Acyl-GPE, 1-acyl-glycero-phosphoethanolamine;
  AOX, alternative oxidase; DHA, dehydroascorbate; MDHA, monodehydroxyascorbate; NB,
  nucleobases; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate.'
