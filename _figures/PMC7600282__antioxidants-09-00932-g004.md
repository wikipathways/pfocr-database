caption: 'Target points of the dietary compounds on mitochondrial dynamics and mitogenesis,
  with a particular focus on mitophagy. AMPK is one of the central upstream regulators
  of mitophagy and mitogenesis. Through oxidative-stress, induced mtDNA mutation activates
  the AMPK pathway and further inhibits the mTOR []. AMPK, in turn, stimulates mitophagy
  via ULK1 and mitogenesis via the PGC-1 α pathway. The main upstream mediators of
  PGC-1 α are FOXO1/3 and SIRT1/3. PGC-1 α, in turn, activates mitophagy via NRF1/2
  and TFAM. Paradoxically, the mitogenesis promoter PGC-1 α also interferes with mitophagy
  by regulating lysosomal biogenesis via TFEB. Further, AMPK targets FOXO1 and -3.
  FOXO, in turn, increases the transcription of essential mitophagy mediators and
  proteins. On the other hand, mTOR blocks mitophagy by inhibiting ULK1 as well as
  downstream signaling of ribosomal protein S6K1, which, in turn, also suppresses
  mitophagy by indirectly inhibiting ULK1 and Beclin-1. The upstream modulator of
  mTOR is the IR/IGF-R, which activates PI3K, followed by activation of AKT, which
  activates mTOR. ERK, in turn, phosphorylates Drp1 for mitochondrial fragmentation
  and stimulates mitophagy due to the activation of IR/IGF-R signals. In general,
  Fis1 is recruiting Drp1 to the OMM to induce mitochondrial fission. In this figure,
  the target points of the most prominent compounds of both the Mediterranean and
  the Asian/Okinawan diets are displayed. Hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein from olive
  oil, curcumin, astaxanthin, resveratrol, and spermidine were all found to stimulate
  mitochondrial dynamics, mitogenesis, and, especially, mitophagy. Abbreviation: AMPK
