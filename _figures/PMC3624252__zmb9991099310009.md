caption: Schematic representation of Gab2 signaling and its negative regulation by
  RSK. While Gab2 phosphorylation at tyrosine residues promotes Shp2 recruitment and
  activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, RSK-mediated phosphorylation of Gab2 on Ser/Thr
  residues inhibits Shp2 binding and Shp2-dependent signaling. RSK-mediated phosphorylation
  of Gab2 likely plays a role in tightly regulating Gab2-dependent biological functions,
  such as the regulation of cell motility.
