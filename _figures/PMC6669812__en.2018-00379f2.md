caption: Leptin binds to the LEPR and mediates multiple downstream pathways. The JAK/STAT
  pathway is mediated via homo-oligomerization of JAK2, with subsequent phosphorylation
  and activation of STAT transcription factors, such as CPT1B and c-myc. JAK also
  phosphorylates Tyr985, leading to phosphorylation of SHP2 and downstream activation
  of ERK and associated gene expression, including the oncogene c-fos. JAK also leads
  to activation of the PI3K pathway, whereby AKT is phosphorylated and mTOR is subsequently
  activated, leading to expression of EIF4E and CAD. JNK is another pathway activated
  by JAK, leading to downstream expression of genes including c-Jun (oncogene) and
  MMP7. Reprinted with permission, Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography
