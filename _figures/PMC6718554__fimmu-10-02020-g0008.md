caption: A schematic illustration of how MEK1/2 pathway modulates the interferon responses
  in macrophages. (A) TLR3 activation by poly(I:C) and TLR4 activation by LPS induce
  scarce levels of Irf1 and interferon response genes, at least in part due to the
  inhibitory effects of MEK1/2-ERK-IL-10-STAT3 signaling. (B) Inhibition of MEK1/2
  pathway using MEK1/2 inhibitor blocks activation of ERK-mediated inhibitory signaling,
  unlocking the IRF1-IFN-β-interferon signature response through the NF-κB pathway.
  The combination therapy with TLR7 agonist and MEK1/2 inhibitor may greatly enhance
  the anti-tumor monotherapies with either TLR7 agonist or MEK1/2 inhibitor by boosting
  the interferon signature response.
