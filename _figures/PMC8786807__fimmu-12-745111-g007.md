caption: Model of naringenin-mediated inhibition of autophagy and cell proliferation
  and promotion of DC differentiation and maturation through FKBP4/NR3C1/NRF2 signaling
  pathway. Naringenin inhibits FKBP4 protein, thus releasing and inducing NR3C1 protein
  to bind to NRF2 protein, leading to autophagy and proliferation inhibition of BC
  cells, as well as differentiation and maturation promotion of DC. Among tumor microenvironment,
  naringenin might promote T cells to kill breast cancer cells by enhancing the antigen
  presentation function of DC cells.
