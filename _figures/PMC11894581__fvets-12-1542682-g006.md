caption: PPI networks. (A) Core PPI network of SFRP1, PPP1CA, and ADAM17. Orange nodes
  represent the target proteins (SFRP1, PPP1CA, and ADAM17), green nodes indicate
  proteins that directly interact with the target proteins, and gray edges represent
  the interactions between proteins. (B) Directed interaction network of ADAM17. The
  orange node represents ADAM17, green nodes indicate its directly interacting proteins,
  and gray edges represent the interaction relationships. The network highlights ADAM17’s
  role as a key regulatory factor interacting with multiple proteins. (C) Directed
  interaction network of SFRP1. The orange node represents SFRP1, green nodes indicate
  its interacting proteins, and gray edges represent the interaction relationships.
  The network suggests SFRP1’s potential involvement in ECM regulation and signal
  transduction. (D) Extensive interaction network of PPP1CA. The orange node represents
  PPP1CA, green nodes indicate its interacting proteins, and gray edges represent
  the interaction relationships. The network reveals PPP1CA’s potential roles in ribosomal
  protein regulation, signaling pathways, metabolism, and cytoskeleton organization
