caption: 'Arginine deiminase (ADI) hydrolyzes arginine into citrulline. To replenish
  arginine, cells utilize a two-step synthetic pathway involving argininosuccinate
  synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). Prostate cancers deficient in
  either ASL or ASS will not be able to synthesize the necessary amount of arginine
  de novo. At this point, arginine deficiency can activate several different cellular
  metabolic pathways. Pathway A, AMPK is activated and mTOR is subsequently inhibited.
  This will promote autophagy. Pathway B, Bcl-2 is inhibited, freeing Beclin 1 to
  stimulate autophagy. Pathway C, Bcl-2 is once again inhibited, but in this case
  freeing Bak/Bax to activate apoptosis. Note: A longer duration of treatment ultimately
  promotes cell death – mediated by either apoptosis or pro-longed autophagy.Modified
