caption: Innate B cell-stimulating signals in the spleen. Canonical neutrophils (NC
  cells) colonize peri-MZ areas of the spleen under homeostatic conditions via a non-inflammatory
  pathway. NC cells acquire a distinct phenotype and B cell-helper function in response
  to splenic signals such as IL-10 from sinusoidal endothelial cells and macrophages.
  The resulting NBH cells form MZ B cell-interacting NET-like structures to elicit
  CSR, SHM as well as IgM, IgG, and IgA production via a mechanism involving the cytokines
  BAFF, APRIL, and IL-21
