  a Inflammasomes complex. Recognition of PAMPs or DAMPs by PRRs stimulates the NF-κB-mediated
  upregulation of inactive pro-IL-1β and multiple receptor proteins, such as NLRP1,
  NLRP3, NLRC4, NLRC12, as well as the proteins AIM2 and pyrin. The downstream signaling
  involves the engagement of a receptor protein activator, which drives the assembly
  of the inflammasome, proximity-induced autoproteolysis of caspase-1, and the subsequent
  cleavage of IL-1β, IL-18, and GSDMD, ultimately leading to the induction of inflammation
  and pyroptosis. b MYD88-dependent and MYD88-independent pathways. TLRs are universally
  expressed across diverse immune system cells, with TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 positioned
  prominently on the cell surface, while TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 are intimately associated
  with endosomal membranes. Upon recognition of various DAMPs or PAMPs by these TLRs,
  they initiate a complex signaling cascade, leveraging adaptor proteins MYD88 (MYD88-dependent
  pathways) and TRIF (MYD88-independent pathways) as crucial intermediates. These
  adaptors, in turn, activate downstream MAPKs and IKK, which collaborate to facilitate
  the production of inflammatory cytokines by activating transcription factors like
  AP-1 and NF-κB, respectively. c The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling.
  Typical MAPKs activated by various extracellular stimuli are characterized by a
  three-tiered signaling cascade, starting with MAP3KK, followed by MAP2K, and culminating
  in the activation of MAPK. In mammalian cells, three major MAPK families have been
  identified: ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3, and the p38 (α, β, γ, δ) isoforms signaling cascades.
  The transcription factors regulated by MAPK signaling include ELK1, ATF-2, AP1,
  STAT1, c-Fos, MEF-2, c-Myc, CREB, C/EBPα, and c-Jun. The MAPK pathway precisely
  influences cell proliferation, stress responses, inflammation, differentiation,
  functional synchronization, transformation, and apoptosis. d The NF-κB signaling.
  Upon the recognition of PAMPs or DAMPs by PRRs, a critical signaling cascade is
  initiated. This leads to the activation of the IκB Kinase (IKK) complex, which is
  composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO (also known as IKKγ). The IKK complex then phosphorylates
  IκB (inhibitor of κB), a protein that keeps the NF-κB complex (made up of p50 and
  p65 subunits) inactive in the cytoplasm. Following phosphorylation, IκB is marked
  for ubiquitination (Ub) and is subsequently degraded, allowing the NF-κB complex
  to be released. The liberated NF-κB complex translocates to the nucleus, where it
  triggers the transcription of genes involved in immune responses. This signaling
  pathway is essential for a swift reaction to infections and inflammatory stimuli,
  and it also plays a pivotal role in governing cell survival and proliferation. e
  The cGAS–STING–IFN pathway. In the cytoplasm, the presence of free cytosolic DNA
  or endosome-encapsulated DNA triggers the activation of the cGAS enzyme. cGAS synthesizes
  cGAMP, which serves as a second messenger that binds to and activates STING. This
  activation initiates a signaling cascade that involves the transcription factors
  IRF3 and IRF7, leading to the production of Type I IFNs. Concurrently, STING also
  activates the NF-κB pathway, which promotes the expression of inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-6 and TNF. The coordination of these signaling events within the nucleus
  results in a robust DNA-driven immune response, which is essential for the defense
  against intracellular pathogens and the regulation of immune homeostasis. f The
  Ca2+ signaling. Extracellular Ca2+ signaling mediated by ion channels in the cell
  membrane can modulate the activation of these PRR subfamilies. This modulation favors
  the promotion of IRF3/7 activation, initiating IFN-associated innate immune responses
  and enhancing NF-κB-related inflammatory reactions. Furthermore, recent evidence
  has revealed that TLR7 augments the cAMP-PKA pathway, ultimately leading to increased
  expression of SERCA and RYR2 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby disrupting Ca2+
  signaling within cardiomyocytes. This figure is created by BioRender (https://app.biorender.com)'
