caption: 'The bioactive effect of Trp metabolites in bone-related cells. Osteoblastic
  cell: Trp improved mRNA levels of Nanog and Oct-4 to maintain stemness, up-regulated
  osteogenic markers OPN and OCN, and decreased PPAR-γ and LPL to promote osteogenesis.
  Kyn up-regulated CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression to generate ROS. Kyn inhibited Runx2
  expression and generated calcified matrix by damaging ATP production. Kyn could
  up-regulate miR-29b-1-5p to decrease CXCL12, CXCR4, and ACKR3 partially through
  the AhR pathway to inhibit osteogenic differentiation. PICA promoted the expression
  of osteogenic genes Runx2 and OCN to protect bone formation. 5-HT activated HTR1B
  to diminish phosphorylation of CREB and suppress CyclinD1. 5-HT also targets HTR2a
  and HTR2b to activate the PLC-IP3/DAG-PKC signaling pathway to enhance OB proliferation.
  Melatonin conversed the inhibitory effects of TNF-α on osteogenic differentiation,
  curbed the MT2-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway, and activated AMPK signaling, up-regulating
  Foxo3a and Runx2. Melatonin facilitated Osterix expression through PKA and PKC signaling
  pathways and up-regulated ZIP-1 to promote bone mineralization. Melatonin could
  suppress the expression of circ_0003865 to regulate GAS1 translationally by sponging
  miR-3653-3p to enhance osteogenic differentiation. Melatonin also promoted NSD2
  expression by targeting MT1/2 to manage H3K36me2 and H3K27me3 modification, increasing
  Runx2 and BGLAP expression. IS inhibited ERK and p38 MAPK pathway through the AhR
  signaling. Osteoclastic cell: Kyn activated AhR to up-regulate c-Fos and NFATc1,
  as well as Blimp1, Cyp1b1, and Cyp1a2 expression, and enhanced NF-κB pathways to
  promote OC differentiation. Melatonin inhibited osteoclastogenesis through the miR-882/Rev-erbα
  axis and induced ROS. IPA enhanced PXR/P65 complex synthesis. IS affected the NFATc1
  expression mediated by AhR signaling pathways in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
  Chondrocyte: 5-HT facilitated CCN2 production engaged by 5-HTR2A in the growth plates
  and reduced CCN2 generation through 5-HTR2B in articular cartilage. 5-HT can stimulate
  phospholipase A2 to increase collagenase type II activity, causing cartilage damage.
  Melatonin up-regulated Aanat, Mt1, Mt2, and Pthrp expression, subsequently followed
  by increased levels of Sox9 and Ihh. Besides, Bmal1 expression was enhanced, whereas
  Per1 expression was reduced. Melatonin facilitated the cartilage matrix synthesis
  via the TGF-β signaling pathway. Melatonin down-regulated the expression of MMP-13
  and ADAMTS4 and promoted Col2A1 expression. Melatonin also inhibited the MAPK signaling
  pathway to repress IL-1β and TNF-α and was involved in activating the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway and inactivating the NF-κB signaling pathway. Melatonin maintained
  mitochondrial redox balance and repressed oxidative stress by modulating the AMPK/Foxo3
  pathways. Melatonin enhanced the expression of Sirt1, inhibiting IRE1α-XBP1S-CHOP
  to alleviate ERS and curtailing EPC calcification. High melatonin concentrations
  impeded the chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation by down-regulating the
  Col2 and aggrecan expression and reduced the protein expression levels of PCNA,
  Sox9, and Smad4. Melatonin also up-regulated the expression of miR-526b-3p and miR-590-5p,
  which in turn boosted the phosphorylation of SMAD1 by targeting SMAD7, ultimately
  promoting chondrogenic differentiation. [All original elements used in the schematic
