caption: Lines represent steps in the biosynthesis of IAA and its precursors in land
  plants (blue) and bacteria (pink). Enzymatic reactions that have been confirmed
  by genetic and biochemical analysis are provided in the appropriate steps. Unlabeled
  lines represent hypothesized steps in the pathway or steps for which genetic evidence
  is lacking. Many steps in the proposed pathways are currently unknown in both land
  plants and bacteria (Reviewed in [,,]).
