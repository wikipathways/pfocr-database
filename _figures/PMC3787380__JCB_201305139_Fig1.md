caption: How regulated mRNA translation mediates axon guidance. (A) Several studies
  support a model in which guidance cue–induced asymmetrical synthesis of cytoskeletal
  proteins, or their regulators, mediates attractive/repulsive responses in growth
  cones through the polarization of cytoskeletal dynamics (; ; ; ). (B) During midline
  crossing of axons, the receptor Robo 3.2 for the repulsive guidance cue Slit present
  at midline intermediate targets is expressed only on distal axon segments after
  crossing. This spatiotemporal expression pattern is formed through translational
  control to avoid the repulsion between the midline intermediate targets and axons
  that have not yet reached the midline (). The Robo3.2 transcript, which harbors
  a PTC, is degraded by the NMD pathway after local translation, modulating its expression
  levels (). (C) Axonal translation of an adhesion molecule, NF-protocadherin, is
  triggered by regionally expressed Sema3A in the visual pathway, resulting in increased
  adhesion between axons and the substrate and helping axons to turn correctly in
  vivo (). RBP, RNA-binding protein; Cue, guidance cue.
