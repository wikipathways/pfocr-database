caption: Hypothesized mechanisms and potential treatment targets of RAAS-mediated
  cardiovascular disease in HIV. Potential mediators of RAAS dysfunction may include
  direct viral effects, antiretroviral therapy effects, or the adipose depot. Increased
  RAAS activation activates the mineralocorticoid receptor, which may potentiate metabolic
  dysregulation, increased inflammation, and immune activation. Adverse cardiovascular
  sequalae of metabolic disease and inflammation may include coronary microvascular
  and myocardial dysfunction. US Food and Drug Administration–approved medications
  acting along the RAAS pathway, such as ACEi, ARB, and mineralocorticoid receptor
  blockers, are physiologically based treatment targets, which may be useful for CVD
  risk reduction based on strong data that RAAS blockade may reduce BP, decrease inflammation,
  and improve metabolic indices in PWH.
