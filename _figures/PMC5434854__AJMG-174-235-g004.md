caption: Top ranking gene network by P‐value from the gene list uploaded from SSRI
  versus control group analysis. The pathway is centered on the CREB1 gene hub with
  all uploaded genes interacting directly with it except one gene that is one interaction
  away. As with the NRI pathway, there is a strong association with inflammatory processes.
  Although there is minimal overlap between the genes uncovered across the two analysis
  both drugs seem to affect the same networks but through different mechanisms. The
  Frizzled gene, a GWAS hit for schizophrenia, was among the uploaded genes and also
  shows a direct interaction with Creb1. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com].
