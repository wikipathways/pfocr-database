caption: mTOR pathway is a regulator of iron metabolism, targeted drugs everolimus
  and temsirolimus target the mTOR pathway to treat ccRCC patients. The VHL/HIF-α
  axis, which plays a central role in the carcinogenesis of ccRCC, is the main regulator
  target of iron metabolism. Targeting drugs such as sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib,
  and axitinib targeted at VHL gene pathway. Inactivation of VHL increases the sensitivity
  of ccRCC to ferroptosis. IRP1 can bind to the iron reaction element of HIF-2α mRNA
  and inhibits its translation. Tempol, an IRP1-activated drug, inhibits HIF-2α and
  HIF-1α protein levels. PT2399 and PT2385 are inhibitors of HIF-2α.
