caption: 'Schematic summary of SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into host cells, replication, effect
  on host cells, and postulated effects of statins. ACE2 and CD147 are located in
  the plasma membrane, associated with lipid rafts, and can act as SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors.
  Statins, by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, can modify the composition of lipid
  rafts. Statins can also down‐regulate CD147 expression and its translocation to
  the cell surface. Autophagy in host cells is altered during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection,
  by a mechanism that involves SKP2 up‐regulation and subsequent BECN1 degradation.
  Statins decrease SKP2 levels and induce BECN1 and LC3 II synthesis, which trigger
  autophagy activation. Another process modulated by SARSCoV‐2 is the activation of
  the NF‐κB pathway leading to proinflammatory cytokine synthesis, including IL‐6,
  and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Statins can down‐regulate NF‐κB pathway activation,
  proinflammatory cytokine synthesis, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Anti‐thrombotic
  effects of statins by TF modulation could also be beneficial in COVID‐19 patients.
  Purple, discontinuous lines: viral entry and release. Black lines: cell processes.
  Green lines: positive regulation of the process. Red lines: negative regulation
  of the process. Continuous green or red lines: process regulated by statins. Discontinuous
  green or red lines: process regulated by virus. Viral proteins: EP, envelope protein;
  NP, nucleocapsid protein; MP, membrane protein; SP: spike protein. *Targets of specific
  ongoing clinical trials against COVID‐19'
