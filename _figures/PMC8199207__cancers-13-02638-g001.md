caption: 'Genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of immune evasion in MSI tumors. MSI
  tumors may trigger a prolific immune response in the presence of CPIs, since they
  generate more tumor-specific antigens than MSS tumors, thereby inducing the immune
  surveillance (green panel). However, MSI tumors can deceive the immune system through
  several evasion patterns: (a) alterations in the JAK-STAT pathway compromise the
  immune response and negatively regulate PD-L1 expression; (b) MMR-deficient and
  -proficient neoplastic cells in the same tumor might impede the prolific response
  to CPIs; (c) the Wnt/β catenin pathway in MSI tumors contributes to T cell exclusion,
  favoring the immune escape; (d) the loss of antigenicity, due to the acquisition
  of mutations in specific genes (e.g., MHC class I, B2M), compromises the opportunity
  to present tumor-derived antigens to the immune system; (e), immune suppression
  exerted by Tregs, MDSC, and peculiar cytokines like TGF-β and IL-10 leads to an
