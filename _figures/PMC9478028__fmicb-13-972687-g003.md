caption: 'Mechanisms involved in HCC onset caused by HBV-DNA integration into the
  host genome. The figure depicts the downstream effects of HBV-DNA integration favoring
  HCC onset: (i) Dysregulation of host tumor-related genes (top-left) due to the up-regulation
  of host oncogenes (red) or to the lack of oncosuppressors. Magenta line indicates
  a generic HBV promoter; (ii) Expression of chimeric virus-host transcripts with
  transactivating properties (top-right). HBx-human long interspersed nuclear element
  1 (hLINE1) fusion transcript, derived from integrated HBV-DNA, can activate the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, leading to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  and cell migration; (iii) Production of truncated HBV proteins from integrated HBV-DNA
  (bottom-left). HBV ORF X integration into the host genome can lead to the synthesis
  of a truncated HBx protein, retaining the anti-apoptotic N-terminal domain and lacking
  the pro-apoptotic C-terminal domain. Similarly, HBV ORF S integration can lead to
  the synthesis of truncated HBs proteins that are retained in the membrane of endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), triggering ER stress, and in turn activating pro-oncogenic pathways;
  iv) Induction of chromosomal instability (bottom-right). The hepatocyte with a regular
  chromosomal set can develop chromosomal aberrations, such as deletions, translocations
  or dicentric chromosomes, as a consequence of HBV-DNA integration into the genome.'
