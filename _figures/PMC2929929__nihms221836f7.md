caption: Schematic illustrating putative molecular pathways mediating the effects
  of centrally administered LPS on sympathetic drive. LPS induces the production of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, with subsequent induction of NAD(P)H
  oxidase dependent superoxide production. LPS also induces p38 MAPK, which is redox
  dependent. Downstream gene products of p38 MAPK include COX-2, the enzyme that generates
  PGE2. PGE2 activates E class prostanoid receptors (EP-R) to activate the sympathetic
  nervous system. LPS also induces expression of mRNA for the angiotensin II type
  1 receptor (AT1R). The LPS induced sympatho-excitatory response can be blocked by
  inhibiting the LPS-induced NAD(P)H dependent p38 MAPK pathway with blockers or inhibitors
  at the levels indicated (see text for details). The increase in AT1R mRNA is blocked
  by agents that reduce superoxide production, but not by the p38 MAPK inhibitor,
  suggesting an alternative mechanism for that effect. LPS activation of the p44/42
  MAPK pathway, which is also redox dependent, might account for this effect.
