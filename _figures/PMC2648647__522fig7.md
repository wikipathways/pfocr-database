caption: 'Model for the YcgF/YcgE-controlled small regulatory protein network. At
  the top of the network, YcgF acts as a direct antagonist for the MerR-like regulator
  YcgE. The roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of YcgF and YcgE are indicated
  (for details, see the Discussion). Inactivation of YcgE results in the induction
  of eight small proteins (YcgZ, YmgA, YmgB, YmgC, YliL, YnaK, Bdm, and YbgS; all
  between 71 and 126 amino acids long). YcgE directly represses the ycgZ-ymgABC operon
  and down-regulates also yliL and ynaK by yet uncharacterized mechanisms. Among the
  small proteins induced, YmgA and YmgB activate the Rcs phosphorelay pathway, and
  YcgZ has a weak opposite effect. Expression of the small protein genes bdm and ybgS
  (but not yliL and ynaK) is activated by YmgB. The bdm gene is a known member of
  the RcsB regulon; how YmgB affects the ybgS gene has yet to be clarified (therefore,
  ybgS is not included in the figure). Several signals are integrated by the YcgF/YcgE
  pathway: Blue light affects the activity of YcgF protein; low temperature induces
  the expression of YcgF, YcgE, and σS; and starvation (and other stresses) results
  in σS accumulation due to post-transcriptional control mechanisms. For further details
  and references, see the Discussion.'
