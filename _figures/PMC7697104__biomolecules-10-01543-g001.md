caption: (a) Coupling of glucose metabolism with insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cell.
  Glucose is metabolized through glycolysis that produces pyruvate. Pyruvate enters
  into mitochondria through the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and fuels the
  TCA cycle by the action of both pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH). The TCA cycle generates reducing equivalents transferred by NADH and FADH2
  to the electron transport chain (ETC), leading to the hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial
  membrane (ΔΨm) and generation of ATP. Then, ANT transfers ATP to the cytosol, raising
  the ATP/ADP ratio that induces the closure of the K-ATP channels promoting plasma
  membrane depolarization (ΔΨc). This opens voltage sensitive Ca2+ channels, increasing
  cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c), which triggers insulin exocytosis (triggering
  pathway, blue arrows). The amplifying pathway of metabolism–secretion coupling is
  contributed to by additive coupling factors, e.g., glutamate produced by glutamate
  dehydrogenase (GDH) and transported by GC1 (red arrow). Free fatty acids potentiate
  glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (Lc-CoA),
  glycerolipid/free fatty acid cycle (not shown), import into mitochondria through
  the fatty acid transport protein (FATP1) and the carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier
  (CAC), β-oxidation; or through FFAR1 signaling (green arrows). Gαq activates phospholipase
  C (PLC) producing both inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which triggers calcium release
  from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, and raises diacylglycerol (DAG), an
  activator of the phosphokinase C (PKC) involved in insulin exocytosis. (b) Functional
  interaction network of mitochondrial metabolite carriers and associated genes, i.e.,
  pyruvate metabolism, TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism and fatty acid transport.
  Nodes were connected using the STRING interaction knowledgebase with a confidence
  score > 0.4.
