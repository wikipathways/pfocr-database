caption: Molecular mechanisms of JNK activation by p85. (A) Schematic depiction of
  the role that p85 plays in activating JNK. The full-length p85 regulatory subunit
  potentiates the activation of JNK through the insulin/cdc42/MKK4 pathway and also
  facilitates the activation of JNK via the ER stress pathway. Activation of JNK through
  either pathway results in negative feedback on the insulin signaling pathway. Thus,
  the loss of p85 improves insulin sensitivity, in part by diminishing this JNK-mediated
  negative regulation. (B) Schematic of the structural features of the p85 regulatory
  subunit of PI3K showing how they may impact insulin action. The N terminus contains
  an SH3 domain, which may mediate intermolecular interactions with possible cdc42
  guanine nucleotide exchange factors, while the BH domain binds activated cdc42.
  The SH2 domains in the C terminus are critical for proper function and localization
  of PI3K and may also mediate the recruitment of p85α to various cellular complexes.
  The proline-rich domains (P) are diagrammed, but we have not investigated the roles
  of these domains in p85α function.
