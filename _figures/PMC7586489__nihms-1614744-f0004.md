caption: Oxidative stress induces an 8-oxoG in a TNR tract. OGG1 removes the 8-oxoG
  and leaves an abasic site that is subsequently 5’-incised by APE1. In the absence
  of MSH2-MSH3, pol β skips over a template loop structure, leading to repeat deletions
  (the pathway on the left). In the presence of MSH2-MSH3, MSH2-MSH3 interacts with
  pol β and guide the polymerase to copy through the repeats within the loop, generating
  a downstream loop with a short flap that is cleaved by FEN1 alternate flap cleavage.
  This promotes the synthesis of repeats and results in the incorporation of the loop
  leading to repeat expansions (the pathway on the right) ().
