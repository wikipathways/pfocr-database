caption: Hijacking of the exosomal pathway by viruses. The association between exosomes
  and viruses is not clear; however, it has been observed that exosomes before a viral
  infection can act by facilitating or inhibiting the infection. In the first case,
  it improves infectivity of many viruses, such as LGTV, WNV, DENV-2, ZIKV, HCV, HIV-1,
  RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, by hijacking the exosomal pathway to transport viral, cellular
  or immune response factors to other neighboring or distant cells, exosomes being
  a Trojan horse that allows the dissemination and replication of viruses without
  the detection of the immune system, and alter non-permissive cells for better propagation
  of these viral agents. In the second case, exosomes can act as antigen-presenting
  vesicles and activate CD4 T cells.
