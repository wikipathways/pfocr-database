caption: Effect of cigarette smoke on the etiology of colon carcinogenesis. Cigarette
  smoke contains nicotine as well as numerous carcinogenic compounds that effect the
  initiation, promotion, and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). These carcinogenic
  compounds include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heterocyclic amines (HCAs),
  and aromatic amines. These compounds have the ability to induce epigenetic changes
  in KRAS and BRAF genes; both these genes are important in preventing the initiation
  of CRC. Furthermore, these carcinogenic compounds can be bioactivated via cytochrome
  P450 subenzyme (CYPs); this activation can result in DNA-adduct formation, potentially
  resulting in DNA mutations in KRAS, BRAF, and MYC if the DNA damage is not repaired.
  DNA repair pathways such as the base excision repair (BER) pathway can reverse the
  damage induced by these carcinogens through up regulation of various repair proteins
  such as, OGG1, APEX1/APE1, and XRCC1. Alternatively these carcinogenic compounds
  can be excreted from the body via glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and/or UDP-glucuronosyltransferases
  (UGTs). Specific carcinogenic compounds, such as nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone
  (NNK) have been shown to induce the production of ROS; these reactive intermediates
  can then activate numerous molecular pathways including MAPK and NFκB. The MAPK
  signaling cascade has numerous potential protein targets, including NFκB, AP-1,
  and C-myc; the activation of these pathways can further result in increased inflammatory
  markers such as COX-2, leading to the initiation and promotion of CRC. Additionally,
  NNK can activate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), resulting in β-adrenaline
  upregulation; β-adrenaline can up regulate COX-2 levels, further leading to VEGF
  upregulation. Alternatively β-adrenaline can bind and activate the β-adrenaline
  receptor leading to cascade activation; receptor stimulation triggers ERK1/2 activation
  leading to up regulation of downstream targets such as, BCL-2, Bad, and AP-1. The
  downstream targets of the β-adrenaline receptor lead to the induction of apoptosis
  and further activation of metastatic proteins such as MMPs. Additionally, cigarette
  smoke contains nicotine which can activate multiple cell membrane receptors including,
  nAChRs, β-adrenaline, and EGFR. Activation of these membrane receptors leads to
  the up regulation of inflammatory, apoptotic, and metastatic proteins, such as COX-2,
  Bad, BCL-2, AP-1, and VEGF. The illustration also denotes the modulatory role of
  lifestyle interventions at various levels on these aberrant signaling pathways.
