caption: Detection of poxviruses by anti-viral pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
  leads to the activation of IRFs. IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1 and IKKε leads to
  its dimerization and nuclear translocation, where it associates with CBP/p300 to
  initiate transcription of anti-viral target genes, such as type I interferons (TI-IFNs).
  TRAF3 plays a central role in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling through generation
  of activating polyubiquitin chains. TLR3 sensing of dsRNA recruits TRIF, which activates
  TRAF3, in turn forming a complex with TBK1 and IKKε to promote IRF3 phosphorylation.
  The MyD88 adaptor protein associates with TLR7/8 and TLR9 is also able to activate
  TRAF3-mediated signaling. TLR4-associated TRAM can additionally activate this pathway
  through associations with TRIF. NFκB essential modulator (NEMO) is traditionally
  associated with NFκB activation to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production but
  can also activate TBK1, thus inducing IRF3 phosphorylation. RIG-I-like receptors
  (RLRs) sense viral RNA and activate a common activator mitochondrial antiviral signaling
  protein (MAVS), leading to IRF activation. Cytosolic DNA sensing by cGAS, the RLR
  RIG-I (potentially via DNA Pol III-generated transcript from viral DNA) or Ku additionally
  activates this system, leading to IRF3 phosphorylation.
