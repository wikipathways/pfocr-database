caption: Anabolism and catabolism of NAD+. NAD+ is synthesized from four precursors
  including nicotinamide (NAM), tryptophan, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide riboside
  (NR) through three pathways (salvage pathway, de novo pathway, and Preiss-Handler
  pathway). In salvage pathway, the precursors are converted into an intermediate
  called nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) through nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAMPT). Then NMN is converted into NAD+ via nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase
  (NMNAT). NAD+ generated by this pathway is consumed by multiple enzymes including
  sirtuins, PARPs, and cADPR synthases, to generate NAM, and reused in salvage pathway.
  In Preiss-Handler pathway, nicotinic acid is converted into nicotinate mononucleotide
  (NAMN) through nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), then NAMN is converted
  into nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) through NMN transferase (NMNAT),
  further generate NAD+. In de novo pathway, tryptophan is converted into NAMN via
  quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), and then into NAD+ via the Preiss-Handler
  pathway. In redox reactions, NAD+ can be phosphorylated to NADP+ by NAD+ kinase.
  NADP+ can be dephosphorylated to NAD+ by NADP phosphatase. Both the oxidized forms
  (NAD+ and NADP+) serve as hydride acceptors to generate their reduced forms (NADH
  and NADPH).
