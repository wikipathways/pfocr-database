caption: As shown in , compound 11 was synthesized from D-mannose (9, 16.5 g, 92 mmol)
  following a previously reported procedure with slight modifications. Accordingly,
  to a small portion of 9 (~30 mg) in acetic anhydride (63 mL) was added 70% perchloric
  acid (5 drops). The remaining 9 was slowly added to the reaction mixture over a
  20-min period, keeping the reaction temperature at 40–45 °C. The resulting mixture
  was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and then cooled to 15 °C. Phosphorus tribromide
  (13 mL) was added dropwise to the reaction with the reaction temperature kept at
  20–25 °C. Cold water (8.3 mL) was slowly added to the resulting mixture, and the
  reaction was kept at room temperature for 1.5 h. After cooling to 10 °C, a chilled
  solution of sodium acetate trihydrate (50 g, 370 mmol) in water was slowly added
  with the temperature kept at 25–30 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred at room
  temperature for 20 min and poured onto ice. The resulting mixture was extracted
  with methylene chloride (100 mL × 2) and washed sequentially with cold saturated
  sodium bicarbonate and cold water. The solution was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4
  and evaporated in vacuo. The obtained crude mixture, which contained 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-α-D-mannopyranose
  (10) byproduct, was thoroughly washed with anhydrous diethyl ether to give the desired
  product 11 as a white powder (6.7 g, 19 mmol, 21%). The 1H NMR spectral data of
  11 is consistent with those previously reported.
