caption: 'Summary of wild-type and mutant p53 calcium mediated cell death processes.
  (A) Wild-type p53: (1) induces apoptosis by different cellular stresses such as
  hypoxia and chemotherapy; (2) mediates an increase in ER Ca2+ through SERCA; (3)
  promotes ER Ca2+ transfer to the mitochondria resulting in a Ca2+ overloading activated
  caspase 3 and thus PARP; and (4) mediates apoptosis through an induction in TRPC6
  expression and (5) associated Ca2+ influx. (B) (1) Mutations in TP53 result in a
  loss of function; (2) TP53 fails to induce SERCA; (3) this leads to reduced mitochondrial
  Ca2+ promoting apoptotic resistance; (4) ORAI3 is increased in TNBC, promoting Ca2+-mediated
  increase in serum and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase-1 (SGK-1) inducing TP53
  degradation and (5) increased S100 calcium-binding protein P (S100P) also induces
  TP53 degradation. Both enhance cell survival. ER: Endoplasmic reticulum; PARP: poly(ADP-Ribose)
  polymerase; SERCA: sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase.'
