caption: Schematic diagram of molecular cellular pathways potentially involved in
  the NF-κB and IFN-signalling pathways, in SARS-CoV-2 illness. (A) SARS-COV-2 virus
  enters the alveolar cell via ACE2 receptor with help of TMPSRR2 protease, moves
  to the endosome where viral single-stranded DNA signals through TLR 7 and 8, and
  double-stranded DNA through TLR 3, to activate the NF-kB pathway via NEMO. (B) SARS-CoV-2,
  DNA, triggers the RIG-1-like receptors that act through interferon response elements,
  and interferes with normal production of anti-viral IFNs. (C) Viral SARS-COV-2 and
  ROS acting through mitochondrial MVAS pathway, reduces mitochondrial function and
  production of anti-viral interferons, possibly by use of its structural proteins.
  (D) Senescent cells, the associated secretome (SASP) and RAGE-associated-glycated
  damage join an inflammatory pathway involving the NF-kB, IL-1α, TGF-β, IL-6, that
  contribute to the pro-inflammatory milieu. (E) Secondary bacterial infections, such
  as pneumococcus, PAMPs and DAMPs use TLR4 and various intracellular signalling pathways,
  that result in NF-κB activation and further augmentation and production of cytokines,
  chemokines and interferons. (F) Autophagy is slowed up, causing damaged material
  to accumulate and trigger inflamm-ageing pathways. (G) All different signalling
  pathways join a common downstream signalling pathway that results in phosphorylation
  of the cytosolic inhibitor IκBα, which triggers its proteasomal degradation, resulting
  in translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, with the production of the SARS-COV-2-related
  pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade. (H) Research trials are investigating repurposed
  drugs to block the NEMO/NF-κB pathway and proteosome inhibitors to block the autophagy
  process. TLR4, Toll-Like Receptor, LPS, Lipopolysaccharide; NEMO, NF-kappa B Essential
  Modulator; RIG-1-like, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors; PAMPs, Pathogen
  Associated Molecular Patterns; DAMPs, Danger Associated Molecular Patterns; NLRs,
  nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain receptors; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin
  domain containing 3; SASP, Senescence-Associated-Secretory-Phenotype; RAGE, Receptor
  for Advanced Glycation Endproducts; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MAVS, mitochondrial
  anti-viral signalling protein; TMPRSS2, transmembrane serine protease; BTK, Bruton's
  tyrosine kinase; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
