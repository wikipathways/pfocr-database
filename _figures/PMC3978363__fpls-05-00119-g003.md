caption: Regulation of vegetative development and flowering by sugars through T6P
  and SnRK1. Model showing regulation of vegetative development and flowering by sugars
  through T6P and SnRK1. Sugars regulate vegetative and reproductive developmental
  phase transitions through the antagonistic action of T6P and SnRK1. T6P inhibits
  SnRK1 activity in young leaves to promote growth, while SnRK1 delays vegetative
  growth and flowering in response to energy depletion through bZIP activation, which
  in turn represses T6P accumulation. T6P promotes flowering through the photoperiod
  pathway by activating FT in the leaves and via the miRNA156/SPL age pathways at
  the SAM by inhibiting miR156. Sugars also regulate vegetative phase change through
  the miR156/SPL pathway by repressing miR156. Question marks and dotted lines denote
  possible relationships between genes and/or signaling molecules (see text for details).
