caption: Signal transduction events that link ER stress to inflammation. Unfolded
  proteins in the ER cause release of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6. Once released, IRE1α binds
  TRAF2, activating signaling downstream kinases that activate NFκB and AP-1, causing
  expression of genes associated with inflammatory response. The intrinsic ribonuclease
  activity of IRE1α also results in production of XBP1, inducing production of inflammatory
  cytokines by enhancing TLR signaling and differentiation of B lymphocytes and dendritic
  cells. PERK activates its intrinsic kinase activity, causing phosphorylation of
  eIF2 and attenuation of translation of IκB, resulting in excess of NFκB moving to
  the nucleus and induces expression of genes involved in inflammatory pathways. Selective
  activation ATF4 by PERK induces production of inflammatory cytokines and regulates
  redox homeostasis. Activation of ATF6 also induces activation of NFκB. ATF6 can
  also induce production of XBP1 (not shown).
