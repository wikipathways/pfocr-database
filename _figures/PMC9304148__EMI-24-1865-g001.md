caption: 'The two pathways for regulating M. xanthus light‐induced carotenogenesis.A.
  Left panel: B12‐dependent pathway. In the dark, CarH binds to its operator at Pcrt  (recognized
  by RNAP‐σA) to repress expression of the carotenoid synthesis genes (crtE–orf9)
  of the carB operon. Light (UV/blue/green) disrupts CarH‐operator binding to allow
  transcription from Pcrt . Right panel: B12‐independent pathway. CarA represses Pcrt  in
  the dark and its action is counteracted by CarS, expressed when protoporphyrin IX
  (PPIX) exposed to blue light generates photoexcited PPIX (PPIX*) and 1O2. Plasmalogens
  (VEPE), whose biosynthesis requires CarF, are essential for inactivation of CarR
  by a mechanism that may involve VEPE cleavage by 1O2 to its lyso‐PE form and a fatty
  aldehyde (Gallego‐García et al., ) to free CarQ, which associates with RNAP to activate
  PI  and, together with the CarD–CarG complex, PQRS .B. Molecular mechanism of action
  of CarH and CarA. Top: Binding of AdoCbl to apoCarH (monomer or molten globule tetramer)
  forms active CarH repressor oligomers (tetramers: CarHTt, CarHBm; undefined oligomer:
  CarHMx). Photolysis of the AdoCbl Co‐C bond liberates the Ado group as 4′, 5′‐anhydroadenosine
  (unfilled red circles) (Jost et al., ) and disrupts CarH oligomers to monomers (CarHTt,
  CarHMx) or dimers (CarHBm) with bound photolyzed AdoCbl (unfilled red triangles).
  Bottom: CarA dimers bind cooperatively to its operator, which overlaps with promoter
  elements at Pcrt , to repress expression in the dark. Blue light induces expression
  of CarS, which sequesters the CarA DNA binding domain leading to antirepression.'
