caption: Major areas of the ascending pain system and locations of plasticity. The
  diagram shows the basic anatomy of the ascending pain pathway with examples of locations
  where plasticity can occur, driving persistent pain. For instance, inflammation
  or injury to nociceptors can cause changes in the excitability and/or phenotype
  of these cells, causing them to fire action potentials to low-threshold stimuli
  and/or in the absence of any apparent stimulus (ectopic activity).
