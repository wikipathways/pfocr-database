caption: PDE4D exacerbates Ang II-induced vasocontraction by affecting SMC contraction,
  consequently contributing to hypertension. The mechanism by which PDE4D aggravates
  SMC contraction likely involves the PKA-AMPK-MYPT1-MLC signaling pathway. PDE4 inhibitor,
  rolipram, showed a therapeutic effect on Ang II-induced hypertension in mice primarily
  through PDE4D in SMCs. The image was created with BioRender.com, and acquired the
