caption: 'The canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway. A: In the absence of an activating
  Wnt ligand, cytoplasmic protein Dsh remains unphosphorylated. This in turn allows
  a multiprotein complex, which includes the scaffolding proteins APC and Axin, CK1g
  and GSK3b, to phosphorylate b catenin and leads to its ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation. As a result, Wnt target gene expression is repressed by transcriptional
  inhibitors. B: In the presence of the Wnt ligand, the ligand binds to frizzled (Fzd)
  receptor and its coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)-5/6,
  causing the phosphorylation of Dsh. Phosphorylated Dsh is subsequently activated,
  which inhibits GSK3b from phosphorylating b catenin in the cytoplasm. b catenin
  is stabilized and able to be translocated into the nucleus. b-catenin can then bind
  to TCF/LEF transcription factors, thereby regulating the expression of Wnt target
  genes. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CK1g, casein kinase 1g; Dsh, Dishevelled;
  GSK3b, glycogen synthase kinase 3b; Fzd, frizzled; LRP5/6, low density lipoprotein
  receptorrelated protein 5/6; TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor;
  P, phosphorylation (modified from ).'
