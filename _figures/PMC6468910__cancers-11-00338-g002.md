caption: Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-mediated apoptosis and cancer therapy.
  Cancers can be treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy, either individually or
  as a combination therapy. The chemotherapeutic exerts its anticancer activity by
  inducing ERS through endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERSR) to kill tumor
  cells. The ERSR is mainly transduced by three ER-resident sensor proteins, protein
  kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activating the transcription
  factor 6 alpha (ATF6), and inositol requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1). The integrated
  signaling downstream of these three sensors can induce pro-apoptotic signaling through
  the activation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) that can downregulate B-cell lymphoma-2
  (Bcl-2) protein and upregulate Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) protein. The Ca2+ released
  through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs)
  at ER and mitochondrial contact sites can promote the release of mitochondria cytochrome
  c which interacts with apoptosis protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP) and procaspase-9 to form the apoptosome, and subsequently activates
  the caspase pathway resulting in apoptosis.
