caption: Proposed pathway for astaxanthin synthesis in green microalgae. Asterisks
  denote enzymes which have been targeted for metabolic engineering, as shown in Table
  . PSY, phytoene synthase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase;
  LYC-B, lycopene β-cyclase; BKT, β -carotene ketolase; CrtR-b, β-carotene hydroxylase.
  Modified from (; ). Synthesis of β -carotene occurs in the chloroplast, while there
  is evidence that the subsequent steps could also take place in the cytoplasm (;
  ).
