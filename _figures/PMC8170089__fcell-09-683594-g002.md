caption: Pro-fibrotic miRNAs in diabetic complications. TGF-β increases miR-21 expression
  through Smad3 activation. miR-21 expression is also directly increased by TGF-β
  and high glucose. miR-21 can in turn activates EndMT through releasing PTEN of Smad7
  inhibition (red arrow). Indeed, both PTEN and SMAD7 are negative regulators of EndMT
  via the Akt and TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling respectively. SMAD7 can also suppress fibrosis
  by down-regulating the pro-fibrotics miR-21 and miR-192, and up-regulating the anti-fibrotic
  miR-29b. miR451 triggers EndMT by blocking AMPK, an inhibitor of the TGF-β/SMAD
  pathway. miR-449a induces EndMT by inhibiting AdipoR2 and E-cadherin interaction
  in the lipid rafts. miR-374b plays its profibrotic activity by releasing MAPK7/ERK5-mediated
  EndMT inhibition. Finally, miR-122 activates EndMT via the neuronal PAS domain protein
  3 (NPAS3). Pro-fibrotic miRNAs are shown in dark, anti-fibrotic miRNAs in red.
