caption: In this model, TCR binding strength (avidity) during the cortical selection
  process steers stage 0 iNKT cells to specific cell fates. For iNKT cells, which
  express a semi-invariant TCR alpha chain, TCR beta chain usage can influence TCR
  binding avidity. For example, Vβ2 and Vβ7 chains tend to confer higher binding avidity.
  TCRs with high avidity drive NKT2 differentiation preferentially, TCRs with intermediate
  binding avidity drive NKT17 differentiation, and those with low binding avidity
  drive commitment to the NKT1 pathway. NKT progenitor (NKTp) cells finish their differentiation
  in the medulla.
