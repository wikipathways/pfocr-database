caption: A brief overview of the canonical pathway for p38 MAPK-MK2 pathway and the
  downstream effects following MK2 phosphorylation. The pathway may involve the binding
  of a cytokine or growth factor to a cell membrane receptor which results in a sequence
  of kinase chains through MAP3K to MKK to p38 MAPK. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK
  stimulates its migration into the cytosol where it binds and phosphorylates MK2.
  Phosphorylated MK2 is then activated and may further phosphorylate (A) transcription
  factors and co-factors that initiate transcription. Phosphorylation of MK2 results
  in exposing its nuclear export sequence which facilitates the movement of p38 MAPK-MK2
  complex into the cytosol. Here, MK2 further phosphorylates targets such as (B) heat
  shock proteins, (C) enzymes (e.g., 5-lipoxygenase) and (D) binding proteins and
  chaperones (TTP or 14-3-3) to elicit responses. The figure shows that the migration
  of MK2 and thus p38 are required for their full function
