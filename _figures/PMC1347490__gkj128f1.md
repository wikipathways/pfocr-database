caption: A representative example of a pathway in MetaCyc. Pathways can be displayed
  at varying levels of detail. This pathway display depicts an intermediate level
  of detail including enzymes, EC numbers, genes and chemical structures of the main
  compounds. Notice the brown arrows that provide hyperlinks to related upstream and
  downstream pathways.
