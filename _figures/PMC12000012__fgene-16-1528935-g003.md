caption: 'Divergent regulatory pathways in moderate erythropoiesis and excessive erythrocytosis.
  The regulation of erythropoiesis under hypoxia involves a tightly balanced molecular
  network that diverges dramatically between physiological adaptation and pathological
  erythrocytosis in CMS. Central to this dichotomy is the HIF signaling axis, which
  interfaces with chromatin remodeling, noncoding RNA networks, and hormone signaling
  to control erythroid proliferation and apoptosis. 1) Hypoxic Sensing and Transcriptional
  Activation. Under physiological hypoxia, HIF-α stabilization initiates a controlled
  erythropoietic response through two counterbalanced mechanisms: HIF-α recruits SENP1
  to deSUMOylate and stabilize GATA1; 2) Homeostatic restraint: Concurrently, ARID1B
  modulates chromatin accessibility at the GATA1 locus to limit transcriptional hyperactivity,
  and estrogen signaling suppresses ALAS2 via ERα-mediated repression. 3) Epigenetic-Noncoding
  RNA Crosstalk. The long noncoding RNA HIKER (LINC02228) serves as a pivotal rheostat:
  In physiological states, baseline HIKER expression supports CSNK2B-mediated GATA1
  phosphorylation, facilitating normal erythroid maturation while maintaining sensitivity
  to ARID1B-mediated chromatin repression. In CMS, hypoxia-driven HIKER overexpression
  hyperactivates CSNK2B, rendering GATA1 resistant to ARID1B suppression. This epigenetic
  bypass results in sustained ALAS2 upregulation and heme overproduction. 4) Apoptosis-Proliferation
  Coupling. Late-stage erythroblast-derived FasL enforces population control through
  paracrine apoptosis of early progenitors: Physiologically, ARID1B-maintained p53
  expression, creating negative feedback proportional to erythroblast density. In
  CMS, ARID1B deficiency reduces p53 and upregulates Bcl-xL, collectively blunting
  FasL-mediated apoptosis. This dual defect permits uncontrolled expansion of FasL-resistant
  progenitors. 5) Sexual dimorphism in CMS susceptibility emerges from hormone-pathway
  interactions: Estrogen reinforces physiological restraint by suppressing SENP1-HIF-α
  crosstalk. Testosterone exacerbates CMS by potentiating both AR-mediated proliferation,
  while inhibiting estrogen receptor signaling'
