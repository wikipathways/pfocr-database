caption: Contribution of hTERT to metabolic pathways under stress. The senescence
  program can be activated by different stress stimuli, such as infrared radiation,
  UVA, UVB, heat, chemotherapeutic drugs, replicative stress, and environmental factors,
  e.g., tobacco, air pollutants, chemicals, and nutrition. The main molecular effects
  triggered by this process are anti-apoptotic response, cell-cycle arrest, metabolic
  changes in mitochondria, accumulation of DNA damage, and rearrangement of the chromatin.
  In response to changes in the nucleus, most of the senescent cells induce the p53/p21/p38MAPK/NF-κB
  signaling pathway. Consequently, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
  is activated and numerous growth factors, cytokines, and ECM components (e.g., EGF,
  IL1, IL6, MMP2, MMP3) are secreted. All of these elements play an important role
  in autocrine and/or paracrine signaling. Under stress conditions, hTERT is distributed
  between the nucleus, the cytoplasm, and the mitochondria, and plays protective roles
  in these organelles. In the nucleus, hTERT is required to maintain telomeres and
  genomic stability. It can also affect chromatin structure and modulate the DNA damage
  response. hTERT protects mitochondria from oxidative stress (and DNA damage) by
  decreasing ROS levels and binding to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).
