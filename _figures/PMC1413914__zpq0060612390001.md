caption: 'Pathway showing all possible routes to xanthophyll synthesis in Arabidopsis.
  Enzymatic reactions are indicated by numbers: , ε-cyclization; , β-cyclization;
  , β-ring hydroxylation of β,ε- and β,ψ-carotenoids; , ε-ring hydroxylation;, , β-ring
  hydroxylation of β,β-carotenoids. Reactions blocked by mutation of the indicated
  loci are shown: lut1 (ε-ring hydroxylase), lut2 (ε-cyclase), lut5, b1, and b2 (three
  β-ring hydroxylases). Solid gray arrows indicate a reaction sequence that is supported
  by mutant phenotypes and/or enzyme activity assays in E. coli, whereas dashed gray
  arrows are not. Solid black arrows, compounds, and mutant loci indicate major biosynthetic
  routes.'
