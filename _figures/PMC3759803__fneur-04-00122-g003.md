caption: Alzheimer disease-related disruption of tau degradation. Impairment of protein
  degradation is a known component of both familial and sporadic AD. Familial AD-related
  mutations of PS1 are linked to impairment of lysosomal acidification and/or fusion
  to the autophagosome, while sporadic factors leading to similar impairments have
  not yet been elucidated. Impairment of the lysosome/autophagosome leads to accumulation
  of dysfunctional autophagic vacuoles (AVs), cytosolic p62, and aggregates of tau.
  Dysfunction of autophagy further inhibits the proteasome, possibly via accumulation
  of p62, which can be a chaperone for both systems. P62 is usually recycled via autophagy
  and accumulates in the cytosol when autophagy is impaired. Hypothetically, this
  allows p62 to compete with other proteasome chaperones thus inhibiting proteasomal
  degradation. Further, accumulation of aggregated proteins has also been shown to
  inhibit the proteasome. Taken together, this could lead to accumulation of soluble
  tau, and thus more proteolytic processing and further aggregate. Hence, a vicious
  cycle of degradative pathway impairment and tau accumulation/aggregation may contribute
  to the neurodegenerative processes in AD.
