caption: A working model of neuronal TIA1's function in EAE mice. In EAE mice, TIA1
  is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, facilitating SGs formation in
  neurons, inciting CNS inflammatory infiltration, and precipitating axonal demyelination.
  TIA1 knockout in the CNS of EAE mice yields a notable diminution in neuronal SGs,
  mitigates CNS inflammatory infiltration, and curtails axonal demyelination. Mechanistically,
  CNS‐specific TIA1 knockout engenders a reduction in IL‐31RA expression within spinal
  cord neurons, triggering a cascade that includes the downregulation of the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway, remediation of autophagy impairments, enhanced degradation of
  SGs, and a decrease in the chronic accumulation of SGs. These effects collectively
  contribute to alleviating neuroinflammation and myelin degradation associated with
  EAE. Created using Biorender.com
