caption: Ligands with different efficacies (inset) can modulate a given signaling
  pathway. Moreover, the efficacy of a drug may differ for different down stream signaling
  profiles. For instance, certain drugs induce routes involving signaling and regulatory
  proteins (e.g. Gi, arrestin) that complement the predominant pathway through Gs.
  In addition to ligand binding, other factors as lipid bilayer composition, pH and
  salt gradients, membrane potential, protein-protein interactions, either within
  the membrane (homo- or hetero-oligomerization and interaction with other membrane
  proteins) or with extracellular and intracellular partners, or post-translational
  modifications, as glycosilation, phosphorylation or acylation, can also influence
  the signaling behavior of the receptor.
