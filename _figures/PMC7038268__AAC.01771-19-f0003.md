caption: Simplified scheme of PG recycling and synthesis pathway of P. aeruginosa
  and illustration of the proteins identified by TraDIS. The bacterial murein matrix
  is formed by chains of the two alternating amino sugars MurNAc (M) and GlcNAc (G),
  which are linked by β(1→4) glycosidic bonds. Attached to the MurNAc residues is
  a pentapeptide side chain which typically is composed of l-alanine–γ-d-glutamate–meso-diaminopimelic
  acid–d-alanyl-d-alanine (l-Ala–γ-d-Glu–m-DAP–d-Ala-d-Ala). Cross-links between adjacent
  glycans are mainly built by connecting the meso-diaminopimelic acid of one chain
  with the d-Ala of the other chain. PG synthesis starts in the cytoplasm, where fructose-6-phosphate
  is converted in several steps by GlmS, GlmM, and GlmU to UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-GlcNAc
  is further converted to UDP-MurNAc by Mur enzymes A and B, and subsequently, a peptide
  chain is added by Mur ligases C, D, E, and F to form UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. An
  alternative route to generate UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide starts with the transfer of
  GlcNAc-1,6-anhMurNAc-peptides (muropeptides) along with GlcNAc-anhMurNAc into the
  cytoplasm by the permease AmpG. Some muropeptides (however, not GlcNAc-1,6-anhMurNAc-peptides)
  or free peptides may also be transported through AmpP, but its function in cell
  wall recycling has not been elucidated so far. The imported muropeptides are subsequently
  degraded by NagZ, l,d-carboxypeptidase LdcA, and AmpD, producing d-Ala, GlcNAc,
  l-Ala–iso-d-glutamate–meso-diaminopimelic acid tripeptide, and 1,6-anhMurNAc. AnmK
  then catalyzes the phosphorylation of 1,6-anhMurNAc, generating MurNAc-6P, which
  is further processed by MupP and the sugar kinase AmgK to MurNAc-α-1P. The uridylyltransferase
  MurU then converts the latter to UDP-MurNAc, following the formation of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide.
  The phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide moiety is then transferred by the cytosolic translocase
  MraY to the lipid carrier undecaprenol phosphate (Und-P) to generate lipid I, which
  is subsequently catalyzed by MurG to lipid II by adding GlcNAc to it. Lipid II is
  then flipped into the periplasm (likely by the putative flippase MurJ), where GlcNAc-MurNAc-peptides
  are integrated into the growing PG by high-molecular-mass penicillin-binding proteins;
  glycosyltransferases (GTFs), such as FtsW and RodA; transpeptidases (TPs); and dd-carboxypeptidases
  (CPs). Low-molecular-mass penicillin-binding proteins, endopeptidases (EPs; such
  as MepM1), lytic transglycosylases (such as MltG and Slt), and amidases (such as
  AmpDh2 and AmpDh3) finally cleave the existing PG layer to facilitate the insertion
  of new glycan strands and simultaneously to release the PG degradation products
  from the matrix into the cytoplasm. Under normal conditions, the PG precursor UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide
  binds to AmpR, causing the repression of ampC transcription. In the case of β-lactam
  treatment, the turnover of the muropeptides is increased (by blockage of PG cross-links),
  resulting in the accumulation of 1,6-anhMurNAc-pentapeptide in the cytoplasm. The
  1,6-anhMurNAc-muropeptides are able to displace UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptides from AmpR,
  causing the derepression and, hence, activation of ampC transcription. YgfB also
  modulates ampC expression, contributing finally to β-lactam resistance, but its
  specific role in mediating antibiotic resistance remains to be investigated. The
  proteins found via TraDIS are highlighted with a circle in red for proteins mediating
  repression of ampC expression and with a circle in green for proteins mediating
  derepression of ampC expression. The putative FtsW protein (so far not verified
  in P. aeruginosa) and the unknown mechanism of YgfB are labeled with interrupted
  lines. OM, outer membrane; P, periplasm; IM, inner membrane; C, cytoplasm; PG, peptidoglycan;
