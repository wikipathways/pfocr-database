caption: Schematic representation of ROS-mediated cell death and cell survival signaling
  pathways. The intricate balance between cell death and cell survival is largely
  modulated by intracellular ROS generation. In general, high intracellular ROS generation
  causes cell death by activation of cell death pathways (mitochondrial dependent
  and independent), whereas low levels of ROS acts as a signaling molecules that help
  in cell survival. The major cell death receptors such as TNF receptor–1 (TNFR1)
  and FasR cause cell death by enhancing high intracellular ROS production. The binding
  of TNF alpha to TNFR1 recruits proteins such as TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD)
  and TNFα-receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) to activate the TNFR1 signaling. The
  associated TRADD further recruits Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and pro-caspase-8,
  and this whole signaling complex known as death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)
  is endocytosed, resulting in caspase-8 activation. Similar to TNFR1, FasR recruits
  FADD and activates caspase-8. The extent of caspase-8 activation determines whether
  a cell will follow a mitochondrial-dependent pathway or an independent pathway.
  Low caspase-8 activation follows a mitochondrial-dependent amplification loop that
  is accompanied by caspase-8-mediated cleavage of pro-apoptotic bid (truncated bid
  [t-bid]), which causes Cyt-c release via oligomerization of Bax/Bak proteins in
  mitochondria. The released cytochrome c then subsequently binds apoptosis activation
  factor-1 (Apaf-1) and caspase-9 and activates effector caspases such as caspase-3,
  which causes cell death. In the event of significant caspase-8 activation, it directly
  activates casapse-3 independent of mitochondria. High intracellular ROS induces
  sustained JNK activation and causes mitochondrial cytochrome c release-dependent
  cell death. High intracellular ROS also causes cardiolipin (CL) oxidation, which
  is translocated to the outer membrane and provides the docking site for t-bid, facilitating
  the cytochrome c-release. In contrast, low levels of intracellular ROS mediate a
  transient JNK activation that helps in cell survival by activating AP-1 transcription
  factor and anti-apoptotic genes. TNFR1 signaling also activates NF-κB transcription
  factor by recruiting TRAF-2 and receptor-interacting kinase 1 (RIP1) proteins. NF-κB
  activation is involved in the transcription of manganese SOD (MnSOD) and anti-apoptotic
  signaling proteins such as cIAP-2 and Bcl-xL. MnSOD puts a negative feedback loop
  on enhanced ROS generation and switches off the apoptotic pathway. To see this illustration
