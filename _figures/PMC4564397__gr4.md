caption: 'Salicylic acid and anthocyanidins use different strategies to inhibit tumor
  cell protective catalase. (A) Direct inhibition of catalase by salicylic acid A
  combines recent results on the catalatic cycle of catalase for its classical substrate
  H2O2 and the alternative substrate peroxynitrite  with previously established central
  findings . The catalatic cycle (reactions #1–4) involves the formation of compound
  I (CATFeIV=O·+) and is extremely fast. It starts and ends with active ferricatalase
  (CATFeIII). The interaction between salicylic acid (SA) and catalase requires the
  presence of compound I (reaction #5) and is characterized as an one electron reduction
  of compound I (CATFeIV=O+·) to compound II (CATFeIV=O). Compound II is inactive
  with respect to the catalatic cycle, but can interact with a second molecule of
  salicylic acid (reaction #6) and thus regenerate active ferricatalase (CATFeIII).
  Reaction steps #5 and #6 represent the peroxidatic cycle of catalase. As the peroxidatic
  cycle is much slower than the catalatic cycle , it results in (partial) inhibition
  of catalase and thus allows free H2O2 to get used as substrate for POD-dependent
  HOCl synthesis. In parallel, peroxynitrite has a chance to get protonated and then
  to generate hydroxyl radicals and NO2. This seems to restore intercellular ROS-dependent
  apoptosis signaling through the NO/peroxynitrite and the HOCl signaling pathways,
  which are otherwise controlled by catalase . As further alternative, compound II
  can be converted to the inactive compound III (CATFeIIIO2·−) by H2O2, leading to
  a dead end of catalase activity and sustained restoration of intercellular ROS signaling.
  (B) Singlet oxygen-mediated inactivation of tumor cell protective catalase by anthocyanidins.
  Anthocyanidins inhibits NOD (#1) and thus NO generated by NOS (#2) is no longer
  dioxygenated by NOD (#3). This causes an increase in free NO (#4), a transient inhibition
  of catalase by NO (#5) (87), and an increase in the formation of peroxynitrite (#6).
  The NO-mediated inhibition also interferes with catalase-mediated decomposition
  of H2O2 (#7,8), decomposition of peroxynitrite (#9,10) and oxidation of NO (#11).
  Therefore, the concentrations of free H2O2 and peroxynitrite are now increased and
  a chance for the generation of singlet oxygen is established (#12). The ligand-independent
  activation of the FAS receptor by singlet oxygen  and the subsequent caspase-8-dependent
  stimulation of NOX activity  and NOS induction  cause a further increase of NO,
  superoxide anions, H2O2 and peroxynitrite. They thus amplify the generation of more
  singlet oxygen (#13). Singlet oxygen inactives catalase (#14)  and restores efficient
  signaling through the NO/peroxynitrite (#15, #16) and the HOCl signaling pathway
  (#17,#18) and subsequent activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis .'
