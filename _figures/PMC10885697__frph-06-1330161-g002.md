caption: 'Testosterone regulates the sertoli cell function via two pathways: (1) the
  classical signaling pathway: testosterone diffuses by the plasma membrane and binds
  with the androgen receptors undergo conformational changes for activation which
  allowing to release HSPs (heat shock proteins) presents in the cytoplasm. After
  activation of cascades the androgen receptors translocate to the nucleus and binds
  to the specific DNA sequences androgen response elements (AREs;) and facilitates
  the recruitment of co-activator or co-repressor proteins which could alter the cellular
  functions (2). The non-classical pathways: Testosterone interacts with GPCR (G coupled
  G-protein coupled receptor) in the plasma membrane and activates the PLC (Phospholipase
  C) to cleave PIP into IP. (3) In the non-classical pathways: Testosterone binds
  and interact the with androgen receptors to activates Src, which activates the EGF
  receptors and MAPK cascade via Ras and sequentially phosphorylates and activates
  the RAF, MEK and ERK, resulted phosphorylates CREB on ser 133 and regulates the
  gene expression. Created with BioRender.com (Accessed October 2023)'
