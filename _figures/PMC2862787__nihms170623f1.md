caption: Examples of pathways that may be activated by EP2R and EP4R. (i) Gαs may
  act via cAMP-gated channels to increase Ca2+ and Ca2+-dependent calcineurin signaling.
  Gαs may also act via (ii) cAMP to activate PKA or EPAC, leading to activation or
  inhibition of phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a
  member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. (iii) Gαs may also
  act independently of cAMP to activate the MAPK pathway by transactivating epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) via Src. Potential target transcription factors include
  nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), cAMP-response element binding protein
  (CREB) and activator protein-1(AP-1).
