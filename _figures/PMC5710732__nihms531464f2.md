caption: NADP+ is generated by the glutathione redox pathway in which GSH peroxidase
  (GPx) reduces H2O2 and oxidizes GSH to GSSG, which is reduced back to GSH by glutathione
  reductase (GRed) accompanied by the generation of NADP+. NADPH oxidase (NOX) also
  produces NADP+ when it reduces oxygen to superoxide. 5-Oxo-ETE synthesis is promoted
  by elevated levels of NADP+, which is also reduced back to NADPH by the pentose
  phosphate pathway, initiated by the action of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6Pdh) on glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Both 5-oxo-ETE and 5-HETE are metabolized
  by ω-oxidation in the presence of NADPH.
