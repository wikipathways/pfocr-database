caption: The overview of crosstalk pathways associated with Osx. The signaling pathways
  that control Osx expression can be divided into Runx2-dependent and Runx2-independent
  pathways. In regard to the Runx2 dependent pathways, the BMP/Smads/Runx2 is the
  canonical pathway, and Runx2 regulates Osx by Nfic, ZIP1 indirectly or upregulate
  Osx directly. Meanwhile, Osx cooperate with Dlx5 and Mef2 to control Runx2 reversely.
  As for the Runx2-independent pathway, they are induced by BMP, TGF-β and FGF, then
  activate Smads, MAPK or ETS to regulate Osx directly or indirectly. The Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling is involved in the suppression of Osx. What’s more, Osx has the capability
  of auto-regulation. Osx are also controlled by miRNAs and lncRNAs in an epigenetic
  manner. Generally, miRNAs act as negative regulators and Osx conversely stimulates
  miRNAs. Different lncRNAs regulate Osx positively or negatively. Eventually, Osx
  promotes osteogenesis through the regulation of downstream factors such as Zbtb16,
  Col1a1, Sost, etc.
