caption: 'Selected non-epigenetic effects of sulforaphane and I3C/DIM on prostate
  cancer cells. Sulforaphane (SFN) and I3C/DIM inhibit the Akt signaling axis, a signaling
  pathway often hyperactive in prostate cancer. Inhibition of this pathway decreases
  pro-survival signaling by mTOR, Akt, and NFkB. Sulforaphane and I3C/DIM treatment
  also lead to changes in gene expression (blue arrow) that trigger growth arrest
  and apoptosis. The expression of proteins controlling the cell cycle (e.g., p21,
  p27, and CDK6) is altered to effect growth arrest, and apoptosis is finally induced
  through the mitochondrial pathway. Abbreviations: AR androgen receptor, CDK6 cyclin-dependant
  kinase 6, IAP inhibitors of apoptosis'
