caption: Presumptive PSCA signaling pathway and PSCA-targeted immunotherapy.In the
  prostate epithelium, PSCA expression is induced by androgen through the binding
  of androgen-androgen receptor complex to androgen responsive element (ARE) located
  at the upstream of the gene. Its expression is also up-regulated by cell-cell contact
  in vitro. It was reported that introduction of human telomerase reverse transcriptase
  (hTERT) to urothelial cells suppresses PSCA expression. After translation, PSCA
  is sorted to endoplasmic reticulum, in which it is attached with glycosylphosphatidylinositol
  (GPI) and transported to the outer surface of the cell membrane where it is anchored
  to outer lipid layer via fatty-acid chain of the GPI-moiety. As other GPI-anchored
  proteins, PSCA is believed to be located to a specialized micro-domain, so-called
  lipid raft, in the cell membrane. PSCA may play multiple roles in cell-death induction,
  tumor progression, and tumor suppression. However, the ligand of PSCA is not yet
  identified and the downstream signaling pathway and the physiological function are
  unknown. PSCA targeted immunotherapy could be a new therapeutic option for hormone
  therapy-refractory prostate cancer. Possible strategies include direct cytotoxic
  effects by anti-PSCA antibody or by T cells with T cell receptor genetically fused
  to anti-PSCA antibody, and induction of tumor specific immunity by dendritic cells
  loaded with PSCA peptide.
