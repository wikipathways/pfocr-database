caption: Working model of major enrichment pathways in lung cancer. Proteins activated
  by CDC7, DBF4, CYCE, MCM, and CDC6 promote DNA replication, in addition to promoting
  cell amplification, particularly transcription factor E2F, which is regulated by
  numerous genes. In addition, upregulation of the transcription activity of E2F promotes
  Skp2 regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby potentially promoting the occurrence
  of lung cancer.
