caption: Summary and model of the role of UVSSA during oncogene-induced transcription
  stress. The UVSSA complex alleviates genomic stress during MYC-induced transcription.
  Whereas the role of UVSSA complex during normal RNAPII-associated transcription
  is not known, UVSSA is required for MYC-dependent transcription. UVSSA down-regulation
  during MYC-dependent transcription results in genomic stress, including aberrant
  RNAPII dynamics, transcription-dependent cell sickness, and activation of the ATM/CHK2
  DNA damage response pathway.
