caption: 'Mechanism of inflammation inhibited by zinc. Schematic diagram of zinc-mediated
  suppression of inflammatory pathways. Arrows indicate activation or signaling, and
  red lines indicate inhibition. MTs, whose expression is upregulated by zinc, suppress
  ROS production. Since ROS and NIK both activate NF-κB, zinc suppresses inflammation
  by inhibiting NF-κB-mediated pathways and plays a role in suppressing inflammation
  by inhibiting the NF-κB-mediated pathway. NIK: NF-κB-inducing kinase. IKK: Inhibitor
  of κB kinase. PPAR: Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor.'
