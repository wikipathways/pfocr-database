  Cancer.The binding of estrogen with estrogen receptor is displaced by tamoxifen
  which binds to estrogen receptor and inhibit cell proliferation. The molecular mechanism
  of Tamoxifen-mediated inhibition of cell growth and cell proliferation in estrogen-induced
  breast cancer was obtained using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, USA).
