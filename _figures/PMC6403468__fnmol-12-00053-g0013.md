caption: Model of ApoER2 and VLDLR mediated signaling during cortical development.
  Radial glia cells divide asymmetrically to produce postmitotic neurons. During early
  stages of cortical development these neurons migrate via somal translocation. When
  the thickness of the cerebral wall increases neurons switch their migration mode
  to multipolar migration followed by locomotion. Thus, polarized neurons leave the
  ventricular (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ), depolarize and migrate through the
  IZ via a multipolar migration mode. The depolarization step is ill defined and may
  involve ApoER2 (A)-mediated signaling driven by the central Reelin fragment R3–6
  (box 1). Repolarization of the neurons as prerequisite to glia cell guided locomotion
  is induced by Dab1 phosphorylation mediated by a netrin 1—deleted in colon cancer
  (DCC) signaling cascade and/or by the canonical Reelin pathway (box 2). Locomotion
  and terminal translocation is orchestrated by a complex set of Reelin (full length,
  FL) signals transmitted by clustering of ApoER2 (A) and VLDLR (V) homo- oligomers,
  leading to Dab1 phosphorylation (box 3). CP, cortical plate; IZ, intermediate zone;
  MZ, marginal zone.
