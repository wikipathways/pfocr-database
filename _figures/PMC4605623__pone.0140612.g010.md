caption: In normal cells (left panel), FANCC interacts with STMN1 and facilitates
  the action of CDK1 for STMN1 phosphorylation on serine 38. Subsequent phosphorylation
  of STMN1 requires a functional FA signaling pathway to ensure proper centrosome
  number and mitotic spindle size. In FA-deficient cells (right panel), lack of interaction
  between FANCC and STMN1 and CDK1 would impinge on S38-mediated phosphorylation of
  STMN1 and reduced mitotic kinases would affect subsequent STMN1 phosphorylation
  resulting in abnormal spindle sizes and centrosome numbers.
