caption: 'The canonical Notch signalling pathway and relevant pharmacological inhibitors
  under development in cancer. DLL1, DLL3 and DLL4, and Jagged ligands (JAG1 and JAG2)
  expressed on the cell surface can induce signalling in adjacent cells expressing
  their cognate receptors Notch1–4. Ligand binding promotes sequential cleavage of
  the Notch receptors by ADAM/TACE enzymes (S2 cleavage) and then γ-secretase (S3
  cleavage), resulting in release the NICD, which interacts with transcriptional regulators
  in the nucleus to instigate a Notch gene-expression profile. Notch target genes,
  in turn, regulate pivotal cell-fate choices, including differentiation, cell-cycle
  progression and survival. The final phenotypic effect is dependent on the specific
  signalling context, paralogue, ligand and dosage. Under many conditions, and in
  several types of cancer stem-like cells, Notch signalling can delay differentiation,
  and maintain proliferative and survival potential. Potential therapeutic inhibitors
  of targets involved in the Notch signalling include soluble decoy receptors, mAbs
  targeting the Notch ligands or receptors in the extracellular space, and small-molecules
  or mAb inhibitors targeting the γ-secretase complex. Abbreviations: ADAM, a disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase; APH-1/2, anterior pharynx-defective-1/2; CSL, CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1;
  DLL, delta-like ligand; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HES, hairy and enhancer
  of split-1; JAG1, Jagged-1; JAG2, Jagged-2; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MAML1, Mastermind-like
  1; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; NRARP, Notch-regulated ankyrin-repeated protein;
  SKIP, ski-interacting protein; TACE, TNF-α-converting enzyme (also known as ADAM17).'
