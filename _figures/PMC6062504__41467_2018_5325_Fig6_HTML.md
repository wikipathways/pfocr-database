caption: Pathway analysis. The pathway proposed was deduced from in silico literature
  mining for functional interactions of the differentially methylated genes. The network
  was consolidated by verification of each interaction in the published literature.
  Hypermethylated genes are depicted in blue and hypomethylated genes are given in
  orange. Note that DLX1/DLX2 may influence MAPT either via the WNT (brown) or via
  the GABA signaling (green) pathway (for details see text)
