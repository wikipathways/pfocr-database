caption: This pathway mediates intracellular signaling initiated by extracellular
  stimuli, such as stress and cytokines. MAPKKKs phosphorylate and activate MAPKKs,
  which in turn phosphorylate and activate MAPKs. The mammalian MAPK family includes
  Erk1/2, JNK, and p38. In the Erk1/2 pathway, Erk1/2 is activated by MKK1/2, which
  is activated by Raf. In the JNK pathway, JNK is activated by MKK4/7, which is activated
  by MEKK1/4, ASK1, and MLK3. In the p38 pathway, p38 is activated by MKK3/6, which
  is activated by MLK3, TAK, and DLK. Activated MAPKs phosphorylate various proteins,
  including transcription factors, resulting in regulation of inflammatory responses.
