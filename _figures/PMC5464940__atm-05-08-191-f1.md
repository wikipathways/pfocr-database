caption: 'Overview of the MOA of CHST15/CS-E and STNM01 in tissue remodeling in IBD.
  Currently, 3 mechanisms are involved in tissue remodeling: (I) Persistent inflammation
  by CHST15. CHST15 (mRNA and protein) is induced during the activation of fibroblasts
  both from resident (or recruited) fibroblasts and epithelial cells (EMT). STNM01
  inhibits the activation process, leading to reduced productions of IL-6, MCP-1/CCL2
  and collagen by activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts). (II) Activation of fibrosis
  pathway by CS-E. CS-E acts as a co-receptor for Wnt ligand and a direct receptor
  for RAGE, both leading to activation of fibrosis signaling pathways. (III) Collagen
  fibril formation by CS-E. CS-E directly augments collagen fibril formation and inhibits
  its degradation, leading to intractable fibrosis. STNM01 inhibits CS-E biosynthesis
  into ECM. STNM01 represses the excessive collagen deposition and promotes mucosal
  healing in clinical studies, indicating anti-tissue remodeling effect in vivo and
  in patients. CCL2, CC chemokine ligand 2; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1;
  EMT, epithelial mesenchymal transition; MOA, mechanism of action; CHST15, carbohydrate
  sulfotransferase 15; CS-E, chondroitin sulfate-E; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation
  end product.'
