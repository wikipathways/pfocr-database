caption: Metabolic reprogramming in cancer. In contrast with normal cells, cancer
  cells are able to fulfill their metabolic needs with minimal dependence on extrinsic
  stimuli by growth factors, through deregulation of pathways related to energy production
  and biosynthesis. Glycolysis and glutaminolysis are by far the most investigated
  pathways. The most common signaling molecules involved in metabolic pathways are
  PI3K, AKT, mTORC1, AMPK, as well as the oncogenic proteins KRAS and MYC, and the
  tumor suppressor p53 (depicted in blue font). A. Glycolysis. The “Warburg effect”
  or aerobic glycolysis is characterized by high glycolytic rates observed in cancer
  cells even in the presence of oxygen, with a consequent high amount of lactate production.
  KRAS induces glucose (Glc) uptake by cancer cells through upregulation of the GLUT1
  transporter. The glycolysis pathway is promoted by KRAS, MYC, AKT, loss of the tumor
  suppressor TP53 and HIF-1. Additionally, glycolytic intermediates are diverted towards
  biosynthetic processes, mainly DNA and RNA synthesis by the Pentose Phosphate Pathway
  (PPP). Glycolysis allows the production of pyruvate and ATP. Pyruvate can be converted
  into lactate and shuttled outside the cell; PDAC cells have enhanced activity of
  MCT1/4. Pyruvate can also enter the mitochondria through the MPC for further feeding
  the TCA cycle. B. Lipid synthesis. Cancer cells activate lipid synthesis (also named
  fatty acid synthesis or lipogenesis) to meet their demands. This pathway requires
  the production of cytosolic Acetyl-CoA, which is mainly derived from mitochondrial
  citrate into the TCA cycle. C. Fatty Acid Oxidation (FAO). FAO comprises a cyclical
  series of reactions that result in the shortening of fatty acids (FAs) molecules
  (beta-oxidation) to produce Acetyl-CoA and NADH/FADH2. CPT1, the rate-limiting enzyme
  of FAO, conjugates fatty acids with carnitine to translocate them into the mitochondria,
  where the acylcarnitines undergo B-oxidation. D. Glutaminolysis. In PDAC, KRAS and
  MYC also rewires glutamine (Gln) metabolism. Gln is transported into mitochondria
  by GLS1, then converted into glutamate and finally aspartate (Asp), which is shuttled
  to the cytosol to generate NADH for redox balance. PDAC relies on the transaminase
  enzymes GOT1 and GOT2 for this glutamine-metabolic rewiring. E. OXPHOS. Mitochondria
  are functional in cancer, and several cancer subtypes or populations exhibit an
  oxidative phenotype. Mitochondrial respiration, through OXPHOS, produces most of
  the cellular ATP. For this, the TCA cycle oxidizes substrates from glycolysis, FAO
  and glutaminolysis to produce high-energy electron donors (NADH and FADH2). These
  electrons power the ETC complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane, creating
  a proton force used for high-efficiency ATP generation. Upon detection of decreased
  energy charge, AMPK increases energy generation by enhancing OXPHOS. Metabolites
  and enzymes overexpressed in PDAC are depicted in red font. Dashed arrows represent
  serial reactions. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; Akt, protein kinase B; AMPK, adenosine
