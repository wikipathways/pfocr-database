caption: Model of JA-stimulated induction of nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco. In
  the presence of JA, COI1 binds to JAZ and mediates its degradation through the 26S
  proteasome complex. After the removal of JA pathway suppressor JAZ protein, MYC2
  transcription factor is released to bind the G-box motif, resulting in the activation
  of nicotine biosynthetic genes. The nit mutants may alter nicotine synthesis via
  modifying tobacco JA responses or directly regulating the genes involved in nicotine
  synthesis. The model for nicotine synthetic pathway is based on the reviews by Dewey
  and Xie () and by Lewis et al. (). NNK, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone;
