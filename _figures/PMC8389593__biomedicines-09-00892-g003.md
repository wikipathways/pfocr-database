caption: Mutation of CTNNB1 gene in APA. Mutations in β-catenin have been reported
  to activate the pathway independent from cell membrane depolarization in APA. (A)
  Normal adrenal β-catenin pathway. (B) Gene mutation in adrenal β-catenin pathway.
  β-catenin accumulates intracellularly when Wnt binds to Frizzled and induces the
  expression of downstream genes. β-catenin mutations cause Wnt-independent accumulation
  of β-catenin without degradation. Mutations in β-catenin cause it to accumulate
  in a Wnt-independent manner. As a result, it induces cell proliferation by activating
  downstream genes including AXIN2 and other cell proliferation-related genes. AXIN2
  is β-catenin regulator via GSK3B. On the other hand, it has been suggested that
  β-catenin induces the expression of NR4A family proteins and affects CYP11B2 gene
  expression.
