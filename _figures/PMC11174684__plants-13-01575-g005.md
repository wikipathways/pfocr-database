caption: The schematic representation of the hypothetical signaling pathway activated
  under PEG-6000 treatment in Saragolla and Svevo cultivars. In this pathway, Ca2+
  concentration in the chloroplast stroma has an important impact on cytosolic MAPK3/6
  phosphorylation by altering stomatal closure. In the Saragolla, a plastid-derived
  factor is most likely not active, thereby leading to an over-expression of MAPK3/6,
  which alters its kinase activity, leading to the promotion of partial stomatal opening.
  This eventually results in (almost) unchanged levels of transcription factors ERF109
  and MYB60. The image (in the left) of the wheat seedling representing the presumed
  site of the hypothetical signaling pathway (outlined in red) (inspired by Teardo
  et al. [53])
