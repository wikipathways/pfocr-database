caption: Hippo-YAP signaling pathwayOverview of the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, including
  the interactions between MST1/2, LATS1/2, YAP/TAZ, and TEAD. When the Hippo pathway
  is activated, YAP/TAZ are phosphorylated and retained in the cytoplasm, inhibiting
  abnormal proliferation. In pathway dysregulation, YAP/TAZ translocate to the nucleus,
  promoting tumor initiation and progression.Figure created using BioRender.com
