caption: Proposed model for the effects of hypoxia-induced energy stress on them TOR
  pathway in HNSCC cells. In response to ATP depletion associated with prolonged hypoxia,
  REDD1 plays a key role integrating yet to be elucidated signals that depend on the
  activation of the AMPK energy-sensing apparatus to promote mTOR substrate dephosphorylation
  in a TSC-dependent fashion. In addition, REDD1 acts as a critical negative regulator
  of mTOR activity in response to acute hypoxia independently on the cellular energy
  status.
