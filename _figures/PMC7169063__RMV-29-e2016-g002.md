caption: 'IFN signaling pathway and different ways that the virus interferes with
  this pathway. Downregulation: the long line with a small line at the end; inhibition
  of phosphorylation: the long line with a black circle at the end; scissor shape:
  cleavage by protease; EV71: enterovirus 71 infection. Attachment of IFN type 1 to
  IFNR1 and IFNR2 results in phosphorylation and activation of two adaptors called
  JNK1 and TYK2. The phosphorylation of these two proteins causes activation of STAT1
  and STAT2 adaptors which form a complex with IRF9 and KPNA1, with the complex being
  called ISGF3. As can be seen in this image, STAT1 has a residue (a nuclear localization
  signal) which is recognized by KPNA1. This attachment induces translocation of ISGF3
  to the nucleus and induces ISG''s promoter. 2A protease can suppress the pathway
  by interacting with IFNR1, and 3C protease can cleave IRF9 and inhibit formation
  of ISGF3. EV71 infection can also inhibit phosphorylation of JNK1, TYK2, STAT1,
  and STAT2 which has been suggested in some studies. One of the latest reports found
  new mechanisms through which EV71 infection causes downregulation of KPNA1 in a
  caspase 3‐dependent manner and inhibits translocation of ISGF3 to nucleus'
