caption: Metabolism of dimethyl fumarate (DMF). Orally administered DMF is not detected
  in the blood stream as it is rapidly converted in the gastrointestinal tract by
  hydrolases, such as methyl esterases, into monomethyl fumarate (MMF), which is the
  active principle exerting the therapeutic effects.MMF is further metabolized to
  fumarate which enters the citric acid cycle. This metabolic pathway is used by all
  aerobic organisms to oxidize acetate, and ultimately produce carbon dioxide and
  energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
