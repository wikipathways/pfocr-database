caption: Schematic of the regulation of leucine on glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity
  and ammonia metabolism by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/sirtuin4
  (SIRT4) pathway. Leucine could activate mTORC1 signaling. Mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex 1 inhibits SIRT4 gene expression, in turn; decrease the inhibition of GDH
  activity from SIRT4. Indeed, leucine increases GDH activity and stimulates glutamate
  synthesis from different nitrogen sources by regulating mTORC1/SIRT4 pathway. In
  addition, leucine promotes the reversible conversion from glutamate to glutamine.
  GLUL = glutamate-ammonia ligase; GLNase = Gluta-minase; α-KG = α-ketoglutarate.
