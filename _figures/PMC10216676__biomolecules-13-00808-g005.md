caption: The yeast cell model generated to identify the putative mitochondrial NAG
  transporter/s. Yeast cells lacking the ARG8 gene are auxotrophic for arginine. The
  expression of the E. coli argB-E in the cytosol makes cells dependent on the exit
  of NAG from the matrix. In this model, the expression of a functional unknown mitochondrial
  transporter able to catalyze the efflux of NAG from the matrix will make these cells
  able to grow in the absence of arginine. The part of the yeast mitochondrial arginine

    The expression of the E. coli argB-E in the cytosol makes cells dependent on the
