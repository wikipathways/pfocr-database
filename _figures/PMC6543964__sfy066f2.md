caption: 'Complement cascade and complement regulatory proteins (CRP). CRP modulate
  the ‘tickover’ process of alternative pathway activation and protect host cells
  from activated complement proteins generated via all three pathways. Thrombin independently
  activates C5 in conjunction with C5 convertase. C3b – activated C3; CFB – complement
  factor B; CFD – complement factor D; C3bBb – C3 convertase; C3bBbC3b – C5 convertase;
  CRP may inactivate C3b, prevent binding of CFB to C3b, or accelerate decay of C3
  convertase and C5 convertase. CRP regulation: I – inactivation C3 to C3i; II – inhibit
  binding of CFB to C3b; III – accelerate decay of C3 convertase; IV – accelerate
  decay of C5 convertase. CFH (complement factor H) – regulatory functions I, II,
  III, IV; CFI (complement factor I) – regulatory function I as cofactor for membrane
  cofactor protein (MCP) and thrombomodulin (TBMD).'
