caption: Langerhans cell signaling enhances the survival and proliferation of keratinocytes.
  Langerhans cells (LCs) that patrol the epithelium secrete two cytokines—IL-15 and
  IL-12—which are vital to the survival and proliferation of keratinocytes []. The
  IL-15 pathway (shown in blue) is initiated upon the binding of IL-15 to its respective
  receptor on the keratinocyte. The activated receptor induces the dimerization of
  STAT proteins, which in turn, activate the proteins Ras and Raf, known for their
  prominent roles in proliferation [,]. NF-kB can also be stimulated within this pathway,
  ultimately leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines []. The IL-12
  pathway (shown in red), activated upon the binding of IL-12 to the IL-12 receptor,
  triggers a phosphorylation cascade resulting in the phosphorylation of the Akt protein,
  a protein responsible for moderating cell survival []. A downstream effect of the
  IL-12 pathway is the production of IFN-γ, caused by the dimerization and phosphorylation
  of STAT proteins.
