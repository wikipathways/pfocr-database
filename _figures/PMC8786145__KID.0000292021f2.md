caption: SCFAs at the control of immunometabolism and kidney function. (A) The uptake
  of dietary fiber induces the production of SCFAs by the commensal gut microbiota,
  which signal through the G-protein coupled receptors GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109a or
  via the MCT and SMCT and regulate several metabolic processes. (B) Regarding immune
  cells, SCFAs activate the mTOR signaling pathway and inhibit HDAC activity, leading
  to increased IL-10 synthesis in CD4 T cells. They also directly influence the mitochondrial
  bioenergetics, by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and β oxidation. Finally,
  SCFAs can be converted into acetyl-CoA and boost the activity of the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle. These alterations induce macrophage M2 polarization, increased memory
  responses in CD8 T cells and higher antibody production in B cells. (C) Acetate,
  butyrate, or propionate from dietary fiber/gut microbiota production or supplementation
  have several direct effects in kidney tissue. Signaling through the specific G-protein
  coupled receptors GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109a results in less inflammation and improves
  renal function in kidney diseases. Upon SCFA activation, Olfr78 (the murine ortholog
  of OR51E2) induces the secretion of renin and regulates blood pressure. SCFAs can
  also be transported by OATs, MCTs, and SMCTs in kidney tissue, where they can modulate
  the cellular metabolism by increasing gluconeogenesis and interfere in kidney integrity
  by inhibiting apoptosis, pyroptosis, and HDAC activity. (D) Finally, gut dysbiosis
  can inhibit the production of SCFAs by the microbiota and, consequently, their modulatory
  effects on immune cells and kidneys. SCFAs, short-chain fatty acids; MCT, H+/monocarboxylate
  transporters; SMCT, Na+/monocarboxylate transporters; mTOR, mammalian target of
  rapamycin; HDAC, histone deacetylases; acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; Olfr78, olfactory
  receptor 78; OAT, organic anion transporters.
