caption: A proposed mechanism for the adenosine A2AR agonist mediated activation of
  the cAMP–CREB pathway and induction of immune tolerance. The agonist binds to the
  A2A receptor and activates the Gs protein. The activated Gs protein interacts with
  adenylyl cyclase (AC), which converts ATP to cAMP. Elevation of intracellular cAMP
  levels activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates the cAMP response
  element binding protein (CREB) at Ser-133. The phosphorylated CREB expresses a dual
  function in promoting tolerance. First, by forming a complex with p300 and the nuclear
  co-factor CBP, CREB is able to bind to CREB response elements (CREs) and activate
  transcription of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 as well as increasing
  the expression and number of FoxP3+ Tregs. Secondly, activated CREB blocks the NF-κB
  pathway, which is responsible for the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNFα.
