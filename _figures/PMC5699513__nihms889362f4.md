caption: 'A map for computational mechanistic genome integrity experiments: Experiments
  begin with (1) an initial cell, tissue, or organism type which undergoes (2) perturbations
  to alter biological context, ablate specific pathways, and/or induce mutagenesis
  through one of several mechanisms. Then, to enable (3) initial profiling and selection,
  nucleic acids are extracted from bulk tissue or via multiple-displacement amplification
  from single cells (+/- time lapse microscopy). Alternatively, clones are expanded
  and selected through transformation or karyotype screening. Finally, (4) comprehensive
  genomic profiling is performed, using whole genome sequencing (via standard short
  reads or long-range sequencing technologies) or other genomic and epigenomic profiling
  approaches. The same profiling can also be performed on the unperturbed cell type.
  The resulting variant data and their contextual features are analyzed using machine
  learning algorithms to identify recurrent patterns and link them to their biological
  context (e.g. pathway ablation). Among the several paths in this map are several
  recent studies dissecting the mechanistic basis for chromothripsis [–].'
