caption: Cobalamin biosynthesis and transport pathways, separating anaerobic and aerobic
  pathways with early and late incorporation of cobalt, respectively. Adapted from
  Doxey et al. [] and Fang et al. []. Sequence homology and functional equivalency
  between aerobic and anaerobic pathway enzymes are indicated by horizontal arrows.
  Colors denote the groups of profile HMMs (see TIGR or PFAM HMM numbers adjacent
  to corresponding pathway steps) that contribute to various stages of cobalamin synthesis
  and/or salvage transport
