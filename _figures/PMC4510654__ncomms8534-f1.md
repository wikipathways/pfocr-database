caption: 'Non-natural steps are indicated with red arrows. Starting from endogenous
  C15PP, the pathway includes 15 biochemical steps catalysed by six enzymes (see  to
  see all pathway intermediates). Bottom insets: colonies and cell pellets of E. coli
  expressing pathways to astaxanthin (left) and C50-astaxanthin (right) constructed
  in this study. DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; OPP,
  diphosphate unit.'
