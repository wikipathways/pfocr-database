caption: Gene correlation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
  enrichment analyses. Correlation of differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs
  (lncRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the depression-susceptible (Dep-Sus, A),
  anxiety-susceptible (Anx-Sus, B) and insusceptible (Insus, C) groups was analyzed
  using the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and ceRNA theory-based methods.
  Then, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs correlated
  with differentially expressed lncRNAs was performed. The top enriched terms from
  the depression-susceptible (D), anxiety-susceptible (E) and insusceptible (F) groups
  were identified, and titles in red indicate significantly enriched KEGG pathways.
  The p-value negative log (base 10) is on the x-axis. (G) Venn diagram showing the
  common and unique significantly-enriched KEGG pathways in the three groups. (For
  interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred
