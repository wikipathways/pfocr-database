caption: Targeting 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) for colorectal
  cancer prevention and treatment. Arachidonic acid is produced from membrane phospholipids
  as part of a major pathway involved in pain and inflammation. Arachidonic acid is
  further metabolized by lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. Among lipoxygenases,
  5-LOXs produce leukotrienes, which play major roles in inflammation and gastrointestinal
  (GI) damage and contribute to protumorigenic conditions. One of the leukotrienes
  is converted to lipoxin A4 through 15-lipoxygenase and helps in resolving inflammatory
  conditions; it exhibits antitumorigenic activity. The cyclooxygenase pathway produces
  prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), which serves as a substrate for conversion to various other
  prostaglandins. Many prostaglandins and thromboxanes have proinflammatory and prothrombotic
  effects, leading to increased risk of potentially fatal cardiovascular events. COX
