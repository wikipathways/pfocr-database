caption: The suggested molecular mechanisms of action for ASX in the prevention of
  lung diseases. ASX activates the Nrf–HO-1 pathway to inhibit emphysema and COPD
  and asthma development. ASX suppresses the NF-κB, MAPK, JAK/STAT-3, PI3K/Akt pathways.
  ASX downregulates Th1-mediated immune responses to alleviate asthma. ASX inhibits
  acute lung injury through its effect on the NF-κB and JAK/STAT-3 pathways; alleviates
  lung fibrosis by suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK pathways and NSCLC by ASX supplementation
  via the inhibited MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. ASX, astaxanthin; COPD, chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease; JAK/STAT-3, Janus kinase–signal transducers and activators of
  transcription-3; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Nrf-HO1, nuclear respiratory
  factor-2/heme oxygenase 1; NSCLC, non–small cell lung cancer; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; Th1, T helper type 1.
