caption: Signal-secreting cells (left) release the morphogen protein Hh after modifying
  it through the addition of two lipid molecules. A C-terminal cholesterol moiety
  is added via the activity of an intein domain within Hh itself, whereas the protein
  Ski/Rasp attaches an N-terminal palmitic acid. Lipid-modified Hh is released from
  the producing cell with the aid of the Disp protein. Signal-receiving cells (right)
  bind Hh via the transmembrane protein Ptc, perhaps with the assistance of the iHog/Boi
  family of proteins. Hh binding to Ptc leads to the de-repression of the GPCR-related
  protein Smo. Smo subsequently initiates intracellular signal transduction events,
  which involve proteins such as Cos2, Fu, and Su(fu), that lead to changes in target
  gene expression. The inhibition of Smo by Ptc is of particular interest here; it
  occurs nonstoichiometrically, in a manner that appears to rely on a catalytic activity
  in Ptc.
