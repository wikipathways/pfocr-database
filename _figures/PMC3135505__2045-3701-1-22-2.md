  environmental stresses and the corresponding genes in L. hongkongensis are shown
  as indicated (separated by broken lines). Line arrows indicate the flow of pathway.
  Solid arrows indicate the flow of substances through transporter. Transporters including
  uniporter, antiporter, symporter, and P-type ATPase are shown as blue rectangular
  box. ABC transporters are shown as composite figure of 2 circles, 2 ovals and 1
  horizontal oval. Integrated view of central metabolism is presented as yellow circle.
  Integrated view of gene regulation is presented as light blue rectangle. arc, arginine

  description: Metabolic scheme illustrating the mechanisms of response of Laribacter
    hongkongensis to different environment and stress as deduced from its genome sequence.
    Different environmental stresses and the corresponding genes in L. hongkongensis
    are shown as indicated (separated by broken lines). Line arrows indicate the flow
    of pathway. Solid arrows indicate the flow of substances through transporter.
    Transporters including uniporter, antiporter, symporter, and P-type ATPase are
    shown as blue rectangular box. ABC transporters are shown as composite figure
    of 2 circles, 2 ovals and 1 horizontal oval. Integrated view of central metabolism
    is presented as yellow circle. Integrated view of gene regulation is presented
    as light blue rectangle. arc, arginine deiminase; Cd2+, Cadmium(II) ion; Co2+,
