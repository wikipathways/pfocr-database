caption: 'Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. Proteins (□) and metabolites (o) with
  differential abundance involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis metabolism were
  mapped to the corresponding metabolic pathways in KEGG. Red indicates up-regulation;
  green indicates down-regulation; and yellow indicates no significant difference.
  The up-regulated proteins were beta-glucosidase [EC: 3.2.1.21] and cinnamyl-alcohol
  dehydrogenase [EC: 1.1.1.195], and the down-regulated proteins in this pathway were
  caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase [EC: 2.1.1.68] and caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase
  [EC: 2.1.1.104]. The up-regulated metabolite was L-phenylalanine, and the down-regulated
  metabolite was 4-hydroxycinnamic acid'
