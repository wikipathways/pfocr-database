caption: Proposed model for OsNAC5 role in senescence and metal remobilization. The
  model is based on indirect evidence provided by several studies, especially on and,
  and shows only Fe remobilization, although a similar pathway is likely to be involved
  in Zn and other metals remobilization. (A) A signal is sensed by the cell, triggering
  the senescence-associated cellular components degradation, including chloroplasts,
  the main site of Fe concentration in the cell. (B) OsNAC5 transcription is up-regulated
  by the senescence downstream signaling pathway. (C) OsNAC5 protein is produced and
  triggers the up-regulation of OsNAS2 and OsYSL2 transcription (based on microarray
  data presented in the work performed by). The increased transcription observed is
  either directly or indirectly regulated by OsNAC5. (D) OsNAS2 protein increases
  intracellular NA concentration, which in turn chelates free Fe coming from chloroplast
  and other cellular components degradation. (E) The Fe–NA complex is transported
  across the plasma membrane of the senescent cell, and then transported into phloem
  by OsYSL2, which allows Fe–NA complex long distance translocation. It is important
  to point the possibility that Fe and NA are exported independently from the cell,
  interacting in the apoplast and then transported into the phloem by OsYSL2.
