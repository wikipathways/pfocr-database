caption: Schematic summary of this study. (A) Recapitulation of human somitogenesis
  and somite patterning in vitro using human iPSCs. We generated four SM derivatives
  from human iPSCs in a stepwise manner by referring to these signaling environments
  during mouse and chick somite development as shown on the diagram. (B) Recapitulation
  of the FOP phenotype in two chondrogenesis pathways. Chondrogenesis was enhanced
  in the MSC-like cell-CI pathway but not in the SCL-CI pathway.
