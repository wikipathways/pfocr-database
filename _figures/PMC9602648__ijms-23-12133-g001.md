caption: 'Signal transduction of GPCRs [,,,,]. Upon stimulation, GPCRs not only couple
  to regulatory proteins, such as arrestins, but also trigger the activation of different
  G protein subtypes including Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13, which participate
  in the signal transduction pathway and mediate unique physiological or pathological
  functions. An arrow between two elements means that the side being pointed at is
  activated. Conversely, the symbol (├) represents an inhibiting effect. Abbreviation.
