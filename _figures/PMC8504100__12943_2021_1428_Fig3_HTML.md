caption: 'Major CAF-targeted immunotherapeutic strategies. There are three main approaches
  against cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their associated molecules for
  immunotherapy: A Through the immunotherapies or transgenic technologies that targeting
  CAF markers such as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), alpha-smooth muscle actin
  (α-SMA) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), CAFs can be directly
  depleted and consequently enhance immune response in the tumor microenvironment
  (TME); B CAF activation and function can be suppressed by inhibiting their crucial
  effector molecule or signaling pathways such as vitamin A, transforming growth factor-beta
  (TGF-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) together with Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (JAK-STAT3) signaling pathway, C–C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)-C–C
  chemokine receptor (CCR2) signaling axis and C-X-C chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12),
  thereby restricting the immune suppression induced by CAFs in the TME; C CAF-derived
  matrix proteins such as tenascin-C (TNC), hyaluronan (HA) and matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs) as well as related fibrosis-activated signaling pathways, like focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK) signaling pathways, are the ideal targets to effectively restrict extracellular
  matrix (ECM) remodeling'
