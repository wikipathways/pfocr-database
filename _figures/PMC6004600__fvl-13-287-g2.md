caption: Endosomal TLR3 and TLR7 induce two signaling pathways leading to type I IFN
  and cytokines responses. Although TLR3 and TLR7 induce similar responses against
  DENV, they use different adapter molecules to induce gene expression. TLR3 associates
  with TRIF, while TLR7 forms a complex with MYD88. CLEC5A is a potent inducer of
  cytokines via adapter molecules DAP10 and DAP12. This leads to the activation of
  kinases Syk and Akt and the induction of IL-6, TNF, CCL3 and CXCL8. In addition,
  CLEC5A activates NLRP3 inflammasomes, which process pro IL-1β and IL-18 into maturate
  IL-1β and IL-18, respectively. DC-SIGN signaling in response to manosylated ligands
  involves adapter protein LSP1 and kinase Raf-1. DC-SIGN triggering modulates NFκB
  activation via Raf-1 and possibly enhances CLEC5A-mediated IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF production.
  Direct MR activation leads to IL-10 production, although it does not contain a known
  signaling motif. RIG-I and MDA5 signal via adapter molecule MAVS to induce two distinct
  signaling pathways. One pathway leads to IL-1β, IL-6, TNF, CCL2, CLL3, CLL4 expression
  while the other signaling pathway involves kinases TBK1 and IKKε to induce type
  I and type III IFN. Notably, RLR-induced type I IFN triggers IFNα/βR signaling via
  JAK/STAT which is modulated by RLR-activated IKKε to induce IL-27 in addition to
  antiviral ISGs. In the absence of RLR-IFNα/βR crosstalk, IFNα/βR signaling leads
  to ISGs induction without IL-27.ISGs: IFN-stimulated genes; MR: Mannose receptor.
