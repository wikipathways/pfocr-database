caption: Testosterone deficiency in patients and mice with SCD is associated with
  priapism. Normalization of testosterone levels in SCD mice, by stimulating endogenous
  testicular testosterone production, reverses molecular abnormalities involving PDE5/oxidative
  stress signaling in the penis and decreases priapism susceptibility. The success
  of reducing priapism by restoring physiologic testosterone levels without reducing
  intratesticular testosterone suggests a novel, targetable pathway for treating hypogonadal
  men, including individuals with SCD, without adversely affecting fertility. SCD,
  sickle cell disease; PDE5, phosphodiesterase type 5.
