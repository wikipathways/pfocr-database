caption: Cellular model of song-regulated synapsin expression in NCM, depicting direct
  and indirect pathways of synapsin regulation. The activation of song-responsive
  auditory neurons in NCM triggers the activation of intracellular signaling cascades
  (arrows) that upregulate the expression of the syn2 and syn3 genes (direct pathway)
  and of genes encoding ITFs (indirect pathway, indicated by dashed arrows). Song-induced
  ITFs (possibly including ZENK and AP-1, the latter formed by c-Fos and c-Jun combined)
  act by negatively regulating the expression of syn genes. The blockade of synthesis
  of song-induced proteins by CYC relieves the suppressive effects of ITFs on syn
  expression.
