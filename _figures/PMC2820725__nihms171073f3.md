caption: 'Mechanism of redox remodeling by DCs. The possible sources of extracellular
  cysteine that accumulates during DC and T cell co-culture include: (i) increased
  flux through the transsulfuration pathway leading to enhanced synthesis of cysteine
  from methionine, (ii) direct reduction from cystine catalyzed by extracellular thioredoxin.
  (iii) xc--dependent import of cystine, its subsequent intracellular conversion to
  GSH, which is exported and degraded by the ectoenzymes, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase
  and a dipeptidase, to furnish cysteine. The extracellular accumulation of cysteine
  results in a reducing microenvironment for T cell activation and proliferation and
  also provides T cells with cysteine needed for the synthesis of GSH.'
