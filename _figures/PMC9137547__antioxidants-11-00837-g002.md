caption: 'Neuroprotective action of melatonin on HE brain. In the brain, melatonin
  is synthesized and released from pinealocytes of the pineal gland. Melatonin binds
  to its receptors and activates various physiological functions such as 1. In astrocytes:
  Melatonin detoxifies the excess ammonia by activating the Arginase I and II enzyme
  that prevents glutamine synthesis and glutamate accumulation in extracellular fluid.
  Furthermore, melatonin prevents neuroinflammation and astrocyte swelling by decreasing
  the Ca2+ influx and inhibiting water channel activation. 2. In a neuron, melatonin
  inhibits the cAMP/cGMP/PKA/Ry.R/Ca.V/GSK/PP-2A signaling pathway leading to the
  decreased oxidative stress level, inhibits the microglial activation, and reduces
  the inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis and release. Moreover, melatonin regulates
  glucose metabolism by acting on insulin/GLUT receptors, facilitating synaptic plasticity,
  LTP, cognition by increasing the synaptic density proteins expression, and increasing
  the excitatory neurotransmitter release.'
