caption: Schematic of prevalent locations and metabolic pathways of cellular sphingolipids.
  Ceramide is biosynthesized de novo in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER, purple, blue
  arrows). It is then translocated via the ceramide transport protein (CERT, black
  dotted arrows) to the site of sphingomyelin and ceramide‐1‐phosphate (C1P) formation
  in the trans‐Golgi network (TGN, purple) or via vesicular exocytotic membrane flow
  (black dashed arrows) to the site of glycosylation to glucosylceramide (GlcCer)
  in the Golgi compartment (blue) and more complex glycosphingolipids (GSL), including
  gangliosides (black dashed arrows). Note that only GM3 and GD3, the precursors of
  a‐ and b‐series of gangliosides, are generated in the Golgi, whereas all the following
  glycosylation steps are located to the TGN (lilac). Degradation of sphingolipids
  down to sphingosine occurs mainly in the lysosomal compartment (red arrows). Further
  metabolization of sphingosine is located to the ER, where it is first phosphorylated
  to sphingosine‐1‐phosphate (S1P) and then cleaved into ethanolamine phosphate and
  hexadecenal. Alternatively, S1P can be dephosphorylated back to sphingosine and
  further recycled to ceramide and all other sphingolipids via the salvage pathway
  (green dashed arrows). S1P generated in the plasma membrane by SK1 can be transported
  into the extracellular milieu via ATP‐binding cassette transporters (ABCt) or spinster
  homolog 2 (SPNS2) where it acts as a ligand of five G‐protein coupled receptors
  (S1PR1‐5). Transport of (glyco)sphingolipids occurs via vesicles (dashed black arrows)
  or transport proteins (dotted arrows). Note that sphingolipids are metabolized also
  in the plasma membrane, mitochondria, and nuclei. Abbreviations used are CPTP, C1P
  transport protein; GlcCerase, glucocerebrosidase; GLTP, glycolipid transport protein;
  and LPP, lipid phosphate phosphatase. All other abbreviations as in legend to Fig. .
