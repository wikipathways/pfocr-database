caption: Expression of orthologs annotated for the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) long-term depression (ko04730) pathway present in buccal S sensory
  neuron (BSC) expression clusters with decreasing trend (B3 and B4). Each node of
  the pathway diagram represents an ortholog assigned to an Aplysia californica transcript.
  Nodes are divided into six colored sections, from left to right, ages 7 to 12 months.
  Node sections are colored according to their mean centered and variance scaled expression,
  together representing the expression trends of each node across the aging process.
  Nodes that are not colored were absent from the gene sets of expression clusters
  B3 and B4. Pathway enrichment demonstrates broad downregulation of key signaling
  cascades in aging.
