caption: 'Evolutionary diversification of the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathways
  in plants. These aromatic amino acids, l-phenylalanine (Phe), l-tyrosine, and l-tryptophan,
  are required for protein synthesis in all organisms, but they are also used to synthesize
  diverse natural products (green) in plants. Plants synthesize Phe and tyrosine predominantly
  via the arogenate intermediate, unlike many microbes that make them via phenylpyruvate
  and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate intermediates, respectively (gray). Plants have an additional
  pathway to synthesize Phe in the cytosol. In certain plant lineages, the tyrosine
  and tryptophan pathways and their regulation have diversified: arogenate TyrA dehydrogenase
  (TyrAa) and anthranilate synthase ɑ subunit (ASα) are typically strongly feedback-inhibited
  by tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively (red lines); however, their lineage-specific
  noncanonical counterparts (blue) are not and provide abundant tyrosine or anthranilate
  precursors for synthesis of downstream specialized metabolites (green). Dotted lines
  denote hypothesized but uncharacterized transport processes. Abbreviations: cCM,
  cytosolic chorismate mutase; pCM, plastidic CM; ncTyrAa, noncanonical TyrAa found
  in some dicots; TyrAaα, Caryophyllales-specific TyrAa. See the footnotes for other
  abbreviations introduced in the text.'
