caption: The signaling pathways for NLRs. Activated NLRC1 and NLRC2 respectively self-oligomerize,
  and then recruit RIPK2. RIPK2 not only activates TAK1 to induce IKK-NF-κB and MAPK-AP1
  pathway, but also interacts with TRAF3 to induce TBK1-IKKε complex and further activates
  IRF7, which result in the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6,
  IL-8 and TNF-α) and type I IFNs, respectively. Once NLRC2 is activated by ssRNA
  of virus, NLRC2 oligomerizes and then interacts with MAVS protein and TRAF3 to activate
  IRF3 pathway, which induces expression of type I IFNs. Activated NLRC4/NAIP and
  NLRP members (NLRP1, 3, 6, 7 and 12) recruit ASCs and caspase-1 to form the basis
  of the inflammasome. The activated caspase-1 not only cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  into IL-1β and IL-18, but also triggers pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMD. So far, the
  downstream signaling pathways of NLRC3, NLRP10 and NLRX1 remain to be investigated
