caption: Component–target–pathway–disease network diagram. The circle in the outer
  ring represents the active ingredients of C. alatavicus. The circle in the inner
  ring represents the common targets shared by the diseases involved in the prostate
  cancer pathway and the active ingredients. The inverted triangle at the exact center
  represents the drug node. The triangle represents prostate cancer, and the square
  represents the pathway
