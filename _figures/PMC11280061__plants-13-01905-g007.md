caption: 'Auxin-regulated TFRN attenuates ABA transport, conjugation and signaling.
  Green and pink filled boxes signify dDEGs, which encode activators and repressors
  of ABA signaling, respectively. Black and orange arrows/bar-headed lines on the
  left scheme depict ABA signaling pathway and its transcriptional regulation, respectively.
  TFRN is represented by its interconnected US–DA part supplemented with the free-standing
  DA LCL1, which is a regulator of a dDEG encoding ABA transporter. The numbers in
  blue boxes denote ordinal numbers of the steps in the ABA signaling. Next to a TF
  within the TFRN, these numbers indicate that the TF regulates the corresponding
  step. US, upregulated suppressor; DA, downregulated activator. Abbreviations for
  the ABA transport, conjugation and signaling genes: ATP-BINDING CASETTE G25/30 (ABCG25/30),
