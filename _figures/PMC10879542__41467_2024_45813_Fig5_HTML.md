caption: Red arrows indicate the involvement of HCS1 and HCS2 in the maturation of
  cytochrome c (CytC) and cytochrome c1 (subunit of complex III) within the cytochrome
  oxidase pathway, which can be inhibited by cyanide (NaCN), independent from the
  SHAM-sensitive alternative oxidase pathway (AOX). Diagram of the TCA cycle with
  bar graphs showing levels of metabolites in the wild type (WT) and HCS2-27 mutant
  (HCS2) growing in TAP medium under normal light (NL; blue bars) or low light (LL;
  orange bars) conditions. Data are presented as mean values +/− SD (n  =  3, 6, 4,
  3. n refers to biological replicates of each strain). Asterisks indicate significant
  differences between means evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple
  comparisons test (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.001). Source data are provided as a Source
