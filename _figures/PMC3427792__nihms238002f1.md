caption: (a) Insulin and IGF1 receptors activate IRS proteins, which in turn activate
  PI3 kinase. PI3K generates PIP3, which bind to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain
  of the three Akt isoforms and translocate them to the membrane, where they are phosphorylated
  by PDK1 and mTORC2 for full activation. Akt phosphorylates and inactivates the FoxO
  transcription factors. Akt also phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits its activity, resulting
  in the activation of Rheb. Rheb activates mTORC1, which phosphorylates and activates
  S6K1, and phosphorylates and inactivates the 4E-BPs, resulting in the activation
  of eIF4E and 5′cap-dependent mRNA translation. Akt also can activate mTORC1 through
  the generation of intracellular ATP and the inactivation of AMPK, which otherwise
  inhibits mTORC1. The inhibition of FoxO by Akt prevents the induction of Sestrin
  3, which otherwise activates AMPK and inhibits mTORC1. The activation of mTORC1
  elicits a negative feedback loop that inhibits Akt activity either through S6K1
  and the inactivation of IRS proteins or through other mechanisms. (b) The generic
  primary structure of Akt proteins is shown. Binding of PIP3 to the PH domain and
  the phosphorylations by PDK1 and mTORC2 are illustrated.
