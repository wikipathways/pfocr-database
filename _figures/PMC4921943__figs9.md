  A. Glycolysis, PPP, and the TCA cycle pathway showing statistically significant
  increases or decreases in FATP1-OE relative to FATP1-EV indicated by arrows. Selected
  boxplots of altered metabolites are indicated. B. Citrulline and polyamine biosynthesis
  pathway showing statistically significant increases or decreases in FATP1-OE relative
  to FATP1-EV indicated by arrows. Selected boxplots of altered metabolites are indicated.
