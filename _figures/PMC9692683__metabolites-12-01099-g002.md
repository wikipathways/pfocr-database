caption: An integrative view of amyloid vascular deposition. SARS-CoV-2 (SV-2) triggers
  a peripheral hypercytokinemia led by IL-6, which, in the liver, leads to exacerbated
  production of APR proteins, including C-reactive protein, SAA, and fibrinogen. In
  the CNS, the virus directly affects endothelial cells and astrocytes compromising
  the BBB by inducing and facilitating vascular fibrinoid deposition. The astroglial
  response to SARS-CoV-2 and/or hypercytokinemia may be accompanied by increases in
  serum GFAP and S100B. The virus (via NLRP3) also increases APP metabolism, generating
  more Aβ. With astroglial dysfunction (also involving NLRP3), there is a reduction
  in Aβ clearance, leading to perivascular amyloid deposition. Note that IL-6, centrally,
  leads to an increase in astroglial SAA, which, in turn, could amplify APP neuronal
  processing through the activation of the TLR/NF-KB/NLRP3 pathway. Dashed ellipses
  emphasize the production of SAA by IL-6 in the hepatocytes (not shown) and astrocytes.
  Elevated peripheral production of SAA can accentuate fibrinoid deposition, while
  astroglial production can lead to non-AB amyloid deposition, which, in the CNS,
  involves the microglial scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1).
