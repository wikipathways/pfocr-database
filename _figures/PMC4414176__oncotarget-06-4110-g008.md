caption: In OSCC cells, despite regular CDDP uptake into the cells, overexpression
  of p22phox possibly sequesters CDDP in the cytoplasm, resulting in diminished CDDP
  entry to and DNA adducts formation in the nucleus. The decreased DNA damage triggers
  attenuated apoptotic signaling that is further inhibited by p22phox-activating PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway.
