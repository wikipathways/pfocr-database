caption: 'Schematic representation of the RAS-MAPK pathway’s regulation of cytoskeletal
  dynamics in neurons. The signal passing is driven by FGFR activation via FRS2α and
  GRB2 to activate RAS-GTP. Downstream, ERK1/2 phosphorylates ROCK, stabilizing actin
  filaments through cofilin inactivation, while ERK-mediated tau phosphorylation disrupts
  microtubules; however, tau also exerts negative feedback on ERK to mitigate collapse.
  This pathway further modulates neurofilament phosphorylation via ERK1/2, promoting
  neurite retraction. RhoA-ROCK signaling integrates actin stability, while ERK’s
  dual roles in microtubule destabilization and self-regulation highlight the balance
  between cytoskeletal remodeling and structural maintenance. Red arrows: the sequence
  of signals activation; Red dashed arrows: the sequence of signals activation with
  some steps are omitted here'
