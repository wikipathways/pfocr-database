caption: Condition-specific genes predicted from MEMPIS and the associated metabolic
  pathways. 21 condition-specific genes (except for EC 6.5.1.1) are broadly associated
  with 21 KEGG pathways with only a few overlaps (See Supp Table ). The starch and
  sucrose metabolism pathways include four dry-associated genes and one wet gene,
  and the butanoate metabolism pathway includes five glycine genes. Overall, carbohydrate
  metabolism responds to both moisture and carbon amendments while glycine genes are
  associated with amino acid metabolism more so than other condition-specific genes.
