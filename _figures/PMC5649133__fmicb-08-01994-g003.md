caption: Overview of metabolic characteristics of P. marinum NSCS20N07DT. The large
  blue box and the small orange box showed the metabolic pathway in Chr. I and Chr.
  II, respectively. Amino acids were marked in purple. The double sided arrows across
  the two boxes represented these amino acids synthesis genes were encoded in the
  two chromosomes. The green arrow represented the gene involved in this step was
  encoded in Chr. II. KDG, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PHB, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate.
