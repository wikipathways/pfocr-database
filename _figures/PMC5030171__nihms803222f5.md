caption: Shown schematically are steps in the biosynthesis and decay of TTP mRNA and
  protein that might be influenced by novel therapies designed to increase its overall
  accumulation. Small molecules might be identified that increase transcription of
  ZFP36, the human gene encoding TTP, that would have minimal effects on other genes
  that are often co-induced with TTP, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Other small
  molecules might be able to enhance splicing of the single ZFP36 intron. Changes
  in TTP mRNA stability might be influenced by “steric-blocking” oligonucleotides,
  which would inhibit the normally very rapid decay of the TTP mRNA. Small molecules
  might be identified that decrease the rate of decay of TTP protein and promote its
  overall accumulation in cells. Cell-based screening programs could be conducted
  without targeting specific steps in this biosynthetic pathway.
