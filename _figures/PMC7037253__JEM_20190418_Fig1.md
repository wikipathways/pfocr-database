caption: IL-10 production is metabolically regulated. (A) Macrophages stimulated via
  TLR4 undergo a metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis, which leads to the production
  of lactate and also to a break of the TCA cycle. As a result, succinate accumulates
  and activates HIF-1α, and the transcription of the Il1b gene is enhanced. Inhibition
  of this reprogramming, via the metabolic regulator PKM2 or during infection with
  M. tuberculosis, inhibits Il1b gene transcription, while promoting that of Il10.
  An increase of IL-10 production as a result of enhanced fatty acid metabolism has
  also been described, and is mediated by the transcription factor PBX1. In DCs, the
  maintenance of the pyruvate flux downstream of zymosan stimulation has been shown
  to reinforce the presence of acetylated histone 3 at the Il10 gene promoter, thus
  favoring IL-10 production. Other metabolic regulators, such as AMPK and mTOR, and
  metabolites, such as ATP, lactate, or butyrate, also contribute to IL-10 production
  by DCs, in different settings, but the molecular mechanisms in place remain largely
  unknown. (B) Gut microbiota derived short chain fatty acids signal through GPR43
  and activate STAT3 and mTOR in differentiated Th1 cells, up-regulating the expression
  of Blimp-1 and consequently that of IL-10. In IL-27–induced Tr1 cells, IL-27R signaling
  induces the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC). 25-OHC activates liver X receptor
  (LXR) and presumably decreases the expression of the transcription factor Blimp-1,
  thus limiting the expression of the Il10 gene. In IL-27–differentiated Tr1 cells,
  extracellular ATP (eATP) has been shown to increase the amounts of HIF-1α and consequently
  reduce those of AhR. This stabilization of HIF-1α also occurs under hypoxic conditions.
  Given the role of AhR in enhancing IL-10 expression in Tr1 cells, HIF-1α stabilization
  ultimately decreases IL-10 production. The Th1 switching from IFN-γ single-producing
  cells, to IFN-γ/IL-10 double-producing ones, and eventually IL-10 single-producing
  cells, is coupled to the biosynthesis of cholesterol, via cMaf. In Th17 cells, a
  short chain fatty acid, pentanoate, has been suggested to inhibit AMPK activation,
  thus releasing the mTOR pathway, increasing the glycolytic flux, and leading to
  the production of IL-10. In parallel, through an epigenetic-mediated mechanism,
  pentanoate reduces IL-17A expression.
