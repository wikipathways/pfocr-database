caption: Initially, through binding of GAPDH to TRAF2 the canonical NF-κB pathway
  is upregulated, which persist for 18–24 months, inducing an inflammatory environment.
  This continuous upregulation induced a strong upregulation of the noncanonical pathway
  revealed by NIK upregulation in the Tfh lymphoma cells accompanied by germinal center
  B cells, which also show NIK upregulation. A schematic representation of the signaling
  pathway upregulated in the Tfh lymphoma cells is shown. A therapeutic agent (NIK
  inhibitor) interfering with the noncanonical NF-kB pathway is indicated as also
  the treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD1.
