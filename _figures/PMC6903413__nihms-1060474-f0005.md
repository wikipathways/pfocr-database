caption: 'NFκB activation in inflammatory cells. There are multiple pathways how NFκB
  could be activated within leukocytes; here are the major pathways which play a role
  during acute pancreatitis. Cytokines like IL1β or TNFα as well as DAMP signals acting
  via Toll-like receptors can induce the translocation of p65/p50 into the nucleus.
  In leukocytes the majority of inflammatory mediators are under the control of NFκB:
  cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and components of the inflammasome pathway.
  Leukocyte mediated NFκB activation enhances the immune response in a very prominent
  manner and therefore has a different role in pancreatitis compared to NFκB activation
  within acinar cell.'
