caption: Interactions and connections between the gut microbiota, metabolites, and
  cellular components with IBS. Imbalance in the intestinal gut microbiota can lead
  to symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Gut microbiota metabolites, such
  as SCFAs, can directly affect intestinal movement, BAs affect intestinal movement
  and intestinal barrier function via the FXR/TGR pathway, Trp affects visceral hypersensitivity
  and intestinal inflammation through conversion to 5-HT and indol, and histamine
  affects intestinal inflammation through its receptors. Neurotransmitters (NA, DA,
  GABA), flavonoids, and proteases can also influence visceral hypersensitivity and
  inflammation. Gut microbiota components, lipopeptide, peptidoglycans, and LPS act
  on the TLR pathway or stimulate intestinal macrophages to secrete BMP2 and inflammatory
  factors (COX2, PGE2, NO) to affect intestinal movement
