caption: 'Cholesterol metabolism in the CNS. Cholesterol in the brain is assured by
  de novo biosynthesis requiring a multistep pathway. HMGCR is responsible for the
  conversion of HMG-CoA in MVA and represents the key and rate-limiting step. In the
  adult CNS, neurons reduce their own cholesterol synthesis and import this lipid
  from astrocytes, which secrete apoE rich-lipoproteins through ABCA1 transporters.
  ABCA1 and apoE transcription is elicited by LXR, whose activity is modulated by
  24-OHC. Cholesterol uptake in neurons is ensured by LDLr and LRP1, particularly
  expressed on the cell membranes of neurons. Cholesterol excretion in the brain is
  mainly promoted by its conversion to 24-OHC catalyzed by CYP46. Abbreviations: 24-OHC,
  24(S)-hydroxycholesterol; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; apoE, apolipoprotein
  E; BCEC, brain capillary endothelial cells; CYP46, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase; HMGCR,
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; LDLR, LDL receptor; LRP1, LDLr-related
