caption: Overview Diagram of Ferroptosis Mechanism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
  EB Virus, and SARS-CoV-2 Infections. (A) The necrosis of macrophages triggered by
  M. tuberculosis is closely linked to elevated levels of intracellular iron, increased
  mitochondrial superoxide, and enhanced lipid peroxidation. The use of iron chelators
  or inhibitors of lipid peroxidation effectively averted M. tuberculosis-induced
  macrophage necrosis. The nuclear factor (Nrf2) played a role in inhibiting the expression
  of Bach1 and regulating Gpx4 to mitigate ferroptosis. Additionally, the effector
  molecule PtpA secreted by M. tuberculosis promoted ferroptosis, thereby increasing
  its pathogenicity and ability to spread. (B) This panel outlines the molecular mechanisms
  through which EBV infects B cells and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines.
  EBV infection makes B cells reliant on the activity of SLC7A11 and Gpx4 to resist
  ferroptosis. In NPC cell lines, EBV infection activates the p62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway,
  leading to enhanced Nrf2 activity. This activation further upregulates downstream
  target genes, such as Gpx4 and xCT, which play a critical role in reducing lipid
  peroxidation and inhibiting the accumulation of lipid ROS, thereby preventing ferroptosis.
  (C) The accessory protein Orf7b of SARS-CoV-2 promotes ferroptosis through the c-Myc
  signaling pathway, leading to lung damage. The expression of ferroptosis-related
  genes ACSL1 and CREB5 in monocytes may further promote ferroptosis by regulating
  the inflammatory response. In lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, the mRNA levels
  of the ferroptosis marker PTGS2 are significantly increased. Additionally, ORF3a
  is considered a positive regulator of ferroptosis; it binds to Keap1, enhancing
  Keap1 stability, promoting the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2, and thereby accelerating
  the degradation of Nrf2, which in turn facilitates ferroptosis
