caption: 'ILs mitigating AKI progression. This figure illustrates the mechanisms by
  which various IL families inhibit the progression of AKI. (A) IL-1 family: Signaling
  pathways involving IL-37, highlighting its interaction with IL-18Rα and IL-1R8 receptors.
  (B) IL-2 family: Signaling pathways of IL-2 and IL-15 through their interactions
  with IL-2Rβ and γc receptors, resulting in JAK1/JAK3 activation and downstream STAT1/STAT3/STAT5
  and PI3K/Akt pathways. (C) IL-12 family: Signaling pathways of IL-27 and IL-35,
  showing their interactions with JAK2/TYK2 and STAT1/STAT3/STAT4 pathways. (D) IL-10
  family: Role of IL-10 in inhibiting AKI progression through its interaction with
  IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 receptors, activating JAK1/TYK2 and downstream STAT1/STAT3/STAT5
  pathways. (E) IL-17 family: Signaling pathways of IL-17E, showing its interaction
  with IL-17RA and IL-17RB receptors, leading to activation of TRAF, MAPK, TAK1, AP-1,
  and NF-κB pathways. (F) Overview of AKI inhibition: To summarize the overall process,
  cytokines such as IL-2, IL-10, IL-27, IL-35, and IL-37 mitigate inflammation by
  inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS. Meanwhile, IL-2, IL-15, and IL-35
  regulate the development of Tregs, while IL-17E allows macrophages to change from
  a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype and ILC2s.
  These concerted actions collectively facilitate the resolution of inflammation and
  promote tissue repair. Figure created with BioRender.com'
