caption: A, penicillin biosynthetic pathway. The schematic representation shows the
  genes and proteins involved in different steps of the biosynthesis of benzylpenicillin.
  The estimated mass for each enzyme of the pathway is also indicated. B, genealogy
  of some P. chrysogenum strains during industrial strain improvement programs. Thin
  arrows represent either steps of selection (without mutagenic treatment) or x-ray
  irradiation, UV irradiation, or nitrogen mustard treatment. Arrows between strains
  BL3-D10 and Wisconsin 54-1255 represents a total of nine selection steps. The thick
  arrows between the Wis 54-1255 strain and the high producer strains represent several
  selection steps in different industrial laboratories. The names of the strains used
  in this work are boxed. Penicillin titers are indicated on the right for some of
  these strains.
