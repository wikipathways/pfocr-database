caption: (A) Supernatant transfer assay. The supernatant transfer assay used to dissect
  the molecular events upstream and downstream of IGFR transactivation. V2R-null acceptor
  cells were stimulated with the transferred supernatant of AVP-stimulated, V2R-expressing
  donor cells that were or were not pretreated with inhibitors, dominant negative
  mutants, or siRNAs. (B) V2R-regulated signaling. V2R-regulated β-arrestin–dependent
  activities where AVP binding to V2R elicits the engagement of distinct β-arrestin
  (βarr) pools involved in opposed signaling events. AVP stimulation of V2R induces
  the Src-dependent metalloproteinase-mediated (MP) shedding of an IGFR transactivating
  factor, promoting β-arrestin recruitment to IGFR and the ensuing ERK1/2 activity.
  However, recruitment of β-arrestins to the activated V2R leads to signal arrest
  through desensitization of the Gs-adenylate cyclase (AC) –PKA signaling pathway.
