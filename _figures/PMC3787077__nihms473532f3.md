caption: 'Specificity and synergy in Toll and Imd signaling. The Toll and Imd pathways
  recognize distinct PAMPs and generate distinct responses, with either separate or
  coordinate regulation of transcriptional outputs. In the case of fungi and most
  Gram-positive bacteria, cell wall components (β-1,3,-glucan from fungi; Lys-type
  peptidoglycan from bacteria) are recognized by extracellular pathogen recognition
  receptors and the signal is transduced through protease cascades to activate Toll
  pathway signaling. A pure Toll response involves binding of a homodimer of the transcription
  factor Dif or Dorsal, typically at a single Toll-specific κB site (κB-T) upstream
  of Toll-responsive genes. In the case of Gram-negative bacteria, and select Gram-positive
  species, polymeric DAP-type peptidoglycan (PGN) is recognized by a dimer of PGRP-LCx
  and an extracellular version of PGRP-LE (containing only the PGRP domain) to activate
  Imd signaling. A pure Imd response involves two or more homodimers of the transcription
  factor Relish binding at neighboring Imd-specific κB sites (κB-I) upstream of Imd-responsive
  genes. In the event that both pathways are stimulated, Toll- and Imd-regulated Rel
  proteins can cooperatively regulate a third set of genes. The promoters of such
  dual-responsive genes contain neighboring Toll-specific and Imd-specific κB sites,
  where homodimers of Dif or Dorsal and of Relish, respectively, can bind to effect
  transcription. IM1: Immune-induced molecule 1. Def: Defensin. DptA: Diptericin A.'
