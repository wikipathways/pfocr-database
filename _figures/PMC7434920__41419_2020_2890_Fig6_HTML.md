caption: Shown is a working model depicting how fumarates protect liver cells from
  ROS damage by activating the NRF2 antioxidant pathway and inhibiting ROS-induced
  lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Fumarates increase the activity of NRF2, and
  upregulate the protein levels of NRF2, GCLC, HO1, and GPX4, thereby leading to a
  decreased ROS level, cell lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis.
