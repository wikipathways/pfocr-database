caption: 'Myofibroblast-derived cells and matrisome contribution to tumor microenvironment
  and HCC development: (A) Quiescent HSCs become activated by DAMPs released by apoptotic
  hepatocytes and by IL-1β and TNFα secreted by polarized M2 macrophages after hepatic
  injury. aHSCs induce the secretion of proinflammatory growth factors and chemokines
  such as CCL2, which is recognized by macrophage CCR2, perpetuating liver damage
  and tumor growth. aHSCs, induced by the loss of hepatocyte FBP1, secrete cytokines
  such as IL-6 and CXCL1, which are involved in liver tumorigenesis. Growth factor
  GDF15, induced by aHSC autophagy, also contributes to hepatocarcinoma. (B) CAFs
  are derived from activated myofibroblasts such as aHSCs. Diverse growth factors
  and miRNAs contained in EVs and released from cancer cells act as positive stimuli
  for CAF differentiation. CAFs promote tumor development via the CLCF1–CXCL6/TGFβ
  signaling pathway and induce the recruitment of macrophages and M2 polarization
  by endosialin–CD68 interaction. (C) The matrisome plays a key role in hepatocellular
  carcinoma development by the action of several molecules secreted into the tumor
  microenvironment, such as MMP, cytokines, integrins, and ADAMs. Abbreviations: aHSCs,
