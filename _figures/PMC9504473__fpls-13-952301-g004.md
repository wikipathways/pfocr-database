  representation of the salicylic acid (left) and jasmonic acid (right) defence network
  stages in Arabidopsis thaliana. Triangle-ended black arrows represent activation
  of signaling and circle-ended red arrows represent inhibition of signaling. Left:
  Perception of Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) from infection with
  a biotrophic pathogen initiates the salicylic acid biosynthesis stage (blue-shaded
  box) composed of two short parallel pathways (ICS and PAL) resulting in the production
  of metabolically active salicylate (SA: green hexagon). A negative feedback loop
  regulates hormone biosynthesis, represented by the red circular arrow. Salicylate
  can be converted to various metabolically inactive forms (SAx: yellow hexagons)
  in the modification stage (orange-shaded box). Bioactive salicylate can bind to
  its receptors to activate NPR1 (green rectangle) and suppress NPR3 and NPR4 (red
  rectangle), relieving the repression of the signaling pathway. A signaling cascade
  begins in the early response stage (green-shaded box) and ends in the late response
  stage (purple-shaded box) resulting in the deployment of a defence response tailored
  to the perceived stressor. Right: Perception of Damage Associated Molecular Patterns
  (DAMPs) from insect attack initiates the jasmonic acid biosynthesis stage (blue-shaded
  box), composed of a long pathway resulting in the production of metabolically active
  jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JAi: pink hexagon). A positive feedback loop regulates
  hormone biosynthesis, represented by the black circular arrow. Jasmonic acid can
  be converted to various metabolically inactive forms (JAx: yellow hexagons) in the
  modification stage (orange-shaded box). Bioactive jasmonate isoleucine can bind
  to its receptor (green rectangle), relieving the repression of the signaling pathway.
  A signaling cascade begins in the early response stage (green-shaded box) and ends
  in the late response stage (purple-shaded box), resulting in the deployment of the
  jasmonic acid-mediated defence response best suited to countering the perceived
  stressor while simultaneously suppressing the other defence response (necrotroph
  versus herbivore).'
