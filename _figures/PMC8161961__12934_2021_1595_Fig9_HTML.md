caption: Metabolic pathway analysis in B. amyloliquefaciens NCC 156 and L. paracasei
  subsp. paracasei NCC 2511. Metabolism of citrate and branched-chain amino acids
  (A, B) and of short- to medium-chain flavour aldehydes (C, D). The data reflect
  changes in metabolite abundances during 24 h of fermentation in comparison to those
  in non-fermented chickpea milk incubated under the same conditions (control). In
  separate experiments, citrate (yellow, 10 mM), a mixture of the branched-chain amino
  acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine (green, 5 mM each), and flavour aldehydes
  (blue, 5 mM, each tested individually in separate experiments) were spiked into
  chickpea milk. The evaporation of aldehydes (assessed from non-inoculated controls)
  is indicated as relative loss by the grey colour. The formation of alcohols and
  acids from a particular aldehyde is visualized by the size of the corresponding
  circle associated with the products (p < 0.05). n = 3
