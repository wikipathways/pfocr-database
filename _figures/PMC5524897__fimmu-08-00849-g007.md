  kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway activated by the adenosine A2B receptor is important
  to dendritic cell inhibition and lesion development in mice infected by L. amazonensis.
  L. amazonensis infection leads to the accumulation of adenosine (ADO) in the extracellular
  environment that activates adenosine A2B receptor (A2B ADOR) on dendritic cells
  (DC). The following steps of this pathway are the activation of adenylate cyclase
  (AC) and consequent production of cAMP, activation of PI3K and, finally, the phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2. In order to identify this pathway, we used inhibitors that are showed
  in parenthesis. phospho-ERK1/2 is able to translocate to the nucleus to interacts
  with transcription factors that leads to the decrease of CD40 expression and IL-12p70
  production. DC inhibited by L. amazonensis can decrease IFN-γ production by lymph
  node cells, resulting in the suppression of immune response and lesion development
  in mice.
