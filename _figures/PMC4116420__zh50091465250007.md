caption: Proposed model of SRF action in ciliated airway epithelial cells exposed
  to organic dust. The data presented here indicate that SRF is localized on the cilia
  of bronchial airway epithelial cells, as well as brain ependymal and oviduct ciliated
  cells. We hypothesize that exposure to DE causes SRF to be shuttled from the cilia
  to the cytoplasm, nucleus, or degradation pathways (i.e., through intraflagellar
  transport and/or other shuttling mechanisms). Inhibition of SRF in ciliated cells
  abrogates the inflammation response in the airway potentially due to interference
  in Rho kinase and/or MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore, our data indicate that
  Rho kinase/SRF inhibition modifies cilia beat frequency, which we hypothesize to
  be a result of abrogated cytoskeletal dynamics and homeostatic signaling mechanisms
  that are controlled by the Rho kinase signaling pathway. MKL, megakaryoblastic leukemia
  (SRF coactivator); SRE, serum response element (DNA binding site of SRF).
