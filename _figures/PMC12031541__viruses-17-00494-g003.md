caption: AAV life cycle and DNA Damage Response (DDR) signaling. AAV exploits host
  DDR machinery during its life cycle to facilitate efficient replication, genome
  integration, and persistence within host cells. The AAV Rep proteins Rep68/78 induce
  DNA breaks and create ssDNA intermediates that activate the ATR signaling pathway.
  Helper viruses such as adenovirus (Ad) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) manipulate
  host DDR signaling to enhance AAV replication and integration. Helper viruses induce
  both double-stranded (left panel) and single-strand (right panel) breaks on the
  host. Ad promotes AAV replication through interaction with the ATR pathway, and
  HSV causes replication stress and interaction with ATR that can delay replication
  but also support genome integration. Radiation-induced DNA damage similarly activates
  DDR signaling, facilitating AAV genome replication and integration, though AAV must
  rely more on host DDR machinery in this context. Together, these interactions highlight
  the critical role of DDR pathways in supporting AAV replication and persistence
