caption: '(A) Grey rectangle: mutant BRAF (BRAFV600E) hyper-activates ERK signaling
  and promotes tumor cell proliferation and survival, but BRAF and MEK drugs inhibit
  the pathway and block tumor progression. Main figure: resistance to BRAF inhibitors
  is mediated by several mechanisms, including expression of a truncated forms of
  mutant BRAF, increased expression of mutant BRAF or wild-type CRAF, acquisition
  of mutations in RAS or MEK, expression of MAP3K8/COT, loss of PTEN expression, or
  activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases PDGFRβ, IGF-1R, EGFR and HER2/HER3,
  or increased activation of MET through the increased secretion of HGF by the stromal
  compartment.(B) EGF family receptors mediate resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In colorectal
  cells BRAF inhibits HER1 by inducing CDC25C, so BRAF inhibition by vemurafenib (Vem)
  releases the block to HER1 activation by reducing CDC25C expression. In thyroid
  cancer cells HER3 expression is inhibited by BRAF through the CtBP1/2 transcription
  repressors, so BRAF inhibition by vemurafenib (Vem) results in increased HER3 expression,
  and it alsoincreases NRG1 expression through unknown mechanisms. In melanoma, BRAF
  inhibition by vemurafenib (Vem) drives HER1 signaling by increasing EGF secretion,
  increasing HER1 expression and suppressing MIG6 activity through unknown mechanisms.'
