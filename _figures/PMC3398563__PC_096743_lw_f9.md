caption: Schematic Overview of Selected Aspects of Pyrimidine Metabolism and Its Subcellular
  Localization.De novo pyrimidine synthesis (1 to 4) is distributed in different subcellular
  compartments and finally UMP is formed in the cytosol. Nucleosides, here shown for
  uridine, appear as breakdown products from nucleotides and are cleaved by a nucleoside
  hydrolase (5). The product (in the case of uridine, this is uracil) then has to
  enter the plastid to undergo salvage (6) or the initial step in nucleobase catabolism
  catalyzed by PYD1 (7). Import of uracil by PLUTO is the only known mechanism to
  supply plastids with precursors for pyrimidine nucleotide formation. CA, carbamoyl
  aspartate; CP, carbamoylphosphate; DHO, dihydroorotate; DHU, dihydrouracil. PLUTO
  mediates uracil import into plastids. 1, ; 2, ; 3, ; 4, ; 5, NSH1; 6, UPP, ; 7,
