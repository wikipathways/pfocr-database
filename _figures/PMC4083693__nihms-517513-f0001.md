caption: (A) In the absence of Wnt protein, newly synthesized β-catenin (Armadillo
  in Drosophila) is sequestered by a “destruction complex” which comprises Adenomatosis
  polyposis coli (Apc), Axin, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (Gsk3β), and Casein Kinase
  I (CkI). The phosphorylation of β–catenin protein by Gsk3β and CkI targets it for
  degradation by the proteasome. This keeps β–catenin at a low level in the cytoplasm.
  The transcription of Wnt target genes is inhibited through the action of T-cell
  factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (Tcf/Lef) complex. (B) In the presence of Wnt (Wingless
  is the homologue for Wnt-1 in Drosophila) protein, Wnt binds to the seven-transmembrane-domain
  protein Frizzled and its co-receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
  (Lrp) (Arrow in Drosophila). This triggers the activation of Dishevelled (Dvl) and
  phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of Lrp. The interaction between activated
  Dvl, the destruction complex, and the docking of Axin to phosphorylated Lrp promotes
  the disassembly of the destruction complex, allowing β-catenin to accumulate in
  the cytoplasm. β-catenin then translocates into the nucleus where it activates the
  transcription of Wnt target genes by binding to the Tcf/Lef complex. β-catenin also
  binds to the cytoplamic domain of N-cadherin to regulate the cadherin complex, controlling
  cell-cell adhesion.
