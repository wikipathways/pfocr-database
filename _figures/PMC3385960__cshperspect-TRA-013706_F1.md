caption: Model of the eukaryotic translation elongation pathway. In this model the
  large ribosomal subunit is drawn transparent to visualize tRNAs, factors, and mRNA
  binding to the decoding center at the interface between the large and small subunits
  and tRNAs interacting with the peptidyl transferase center in the large subunit.
  Starting at the top, an eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ternary complex binds the aminoacyl-tRNA
  to the 80S ribosome with the anticodon loop of the tRNA in contact with the mRNA
  in the A site of the small subunit. Following release of eEF1A·GDP, the aminoacyl-tRNA
  is accommodated into the A site, and the eEF1A·GDP is recycled to eEF1A·GTP by the
  exchange factor eEF1B. Peptide bond formation is accompanied by transition of the
  A- and P-site tRNAs into hybrid states with the acceptors ends of the tRNAs moving
  to the P and E sites, respectively. Binding of eEF2·GTP promotes translocation of
  the tRNAs into the canonical P and E sites, and is followed by release of eEF2·GDP,
  which unlike eEF1A does not require an exchange factor. The ribosome is now ready
  for the next cycle of elongation with release of the deacylated tRNA from the E
  site and binding of the appropriate eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site. Throughout,
  GTP is depicted as a green ball and GDP as a red ball; also, the positions of the
  mRNA, tRNAs, and factors are drawn for clarity and are not meant to specify their
  exact places on the ribosome.
