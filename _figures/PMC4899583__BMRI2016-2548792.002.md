caption: Schematic summarizing the oxidative stress mediated apoptotic pathway through
  which manganese causes the dopaminergic cell death and is involved in neurotoxic
  effects. Mn enters neuronal cells via transferrin/DMT1 receptor. Inside cell, Mn
  primarily gets accumulated in mitochondria causing inhibition of complex I/II and
  F1ATPase and interferes with Ca2+ activated ATP production. This resulted in loss
  of mitochondrial potential with release of Cyt C. Mitochondrial dysfunction also
  causes the generation of oxidative stress (ROS/RNS). The oxidative stress resulting
  from dopamine autooxidation causes damage to DNA/RNA/protein/lipid and releases
  inflammatory mediators that activate ERK/MAPK pathway. Activated kinase phosphorylates
  FoxO, preventing its translocation to nucleus and activation of antioxidant enzyme
  genes. Mn may also cause the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that resulted in
  activation of caspase-12 through unfolded protein response. Caspase-12 may further
  activate the other downstream multiple caspases which culminates in apoptotic cell
  death. Cyt C released upon mitochondrial damage activates caspase-3, a critical
  regulator of apoptosis. Caspase-3 proteolytically activates the protein kinase C
  δ (PKCδ) that again can activate ERK/MAPK pathway or on translocation to nucleus
  causes the expression of proapoptotic genes, resulting in mitochondrial mediated
  apoptotic cell death. Protein phosphatase 2A is a downstream substrate for PKCδ;
  activation of PP2A reduces the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, inhibiting the
  dopamine production.
