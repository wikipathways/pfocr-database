caption: 'Molecular mechanism of ERF3, SR4, DRM6-1, CHL1, NRL1, PM1, DMP2 and their
  role in resistance to P. infestans. Wild type potato (left panel), which negatively
  regulates the expression of defense-related genes: ERF3—suppresses defense gene
  activation downstream of ethylene signaling (ISC1); SR4—represses SA-mediated pathways
  by inhibiting EDS1 and NDR1; DMR6-1—hydroxylates SA (SA5H), attenuating SA accumulation;
  CHL1—BR-responsive transcription factor that downregulates immunity under pathogen
  effector-triggered brassinosteroid signaling; NRL1—mediates proteasomal degradation
  of the immune regulator SWAP70; and PM1—suppresses PRR signaling at the plasma membrane
  and negatively modulates the expression of defense-related genes, including StPR1,
  StPR5, StWRKY7, and StWRKY8. These mechanisms weaken the immune response and facilitate
  pathogen colonization. StDMP2 encodes an ER-localized DUF679 membrane protein that
  maintains endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and facilitates proper folding
  and stabilization of immune receptors, such as PRRs and NDR1, thereby enhancing
  pattern-triggered immunity and hypersensitive response upon Phytophthora recognition.
  CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts (right panel) of these genes relieve transcriptional repression
  or eliminate enzymatic activities, resulting in enhanced SA signaling, increased
  expression of WRKY and pathogenesis-related genes (PR1, PR5), stabilization of immune
  regulators, and improved recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns.
  By contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function of DMP2 compromises ERQC, reduces
  PRR and NDR1 accumulation, attenuates immune signaling, and increases susceptibility
  to P. infestans'
