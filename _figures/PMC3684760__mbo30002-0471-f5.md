caption: Comparative structural–functional analysis of the IDO, Bac, and Hil operons.
  In the insect pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis, the oxidation of 4-HIL catalyzed
  by 2-amino-3-methyl-4-ketopentanoic acid (AMKP) reductase (AR) results in the synthesis
  of an antimicrobial agent, AMKP, which is presumably then excreted by efflux pumps
  belonging to the RhtA exporter family (Ogawa et al. ). The genes encoding the hydroxylase,
  the reductase, and the exporter form an operon structure, IDO operon. Bacilysin
  consists of an l-alanine residue at the N terminus attached to a nonproteinogenic
  amino acid, l-anticapsin via amide (CONH) bond. l-anticapsin is synthesized from
  prephenate due to activities of BacABC enzymes and ligated with l-alanine by l-amino
  acid ligase BacD (Tabata et al. ). The resulting bacilysin is then exported from
  cell by BacE exporter. It was shown that the synthesis of this antibiotic is likely
  to be regulated by a quorum sensing (QS) pathway that is responsible for sporulation,
  competence development, and surfactant synthesis (Inaoka et al. ). By analogy, we
  can propose that the HilABC enzymes catalyze synthesis of l-isoleucine derivative
  that can be ligated with l-amino acid by the ATP-dependent carboxylate-amine ligase
  HilD and the resulting dipeptide antibiotic is then excreted from cell by the exporter
  HilE (). The putative QS-dependent expression of the Hil operon could be regulated
  by means of transcriptional regulator HilR and/or special sensory transduction pathway
  that could be initiated by binding of extracellular signal molecule with the extracellular
  solute-binding protein HilP. CM, cytoplasmic membrane; P, periplasm; OM, outer membrane;
  l-AA, l-amino acid.
