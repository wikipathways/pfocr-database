caption: '(a): Mevalonate (Mev) pathway of untreated DC generates isoprenoids (IPP:
  red circles; FPP/GGPP: yellow circles) and cholesterol (blue circles). Ras is prenylated
  in untreated DC (Ras-GTP) and causes the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling
  pathway and suppression of LXRα transcriptional activity. ABCA1 and apoA-I expression
  is finalized to tune the intracellular concentrations of cholesterol and other mevalonate
  pathway metabolites that were generated in physiological conditions. The supernatant
  obtained from untreated DC is unable to induce the proliferation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells
  as extracellular IPP concentrations are below a critical threshold. (b) Farnesyl
  pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) is inhibited in ZA-treated DC, which causes intracellular
  IPP accumulation (red circles), and isoprenoid (yellow circles) and cholesterol
  (blue circles) deprivation. Intracellular IPP induces LXRα nuclear translocation
  (a), which enhances Abca1 and apoA-1 gene transcription and upregulation of ABCA1
  and apoA-I expression. Isoprenoid deprivation concurrently causes Ras deprenylation
  (Ras), which relieves the inhibition operated by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway on LXRα
  nuclear translocation (b). Thus, two mechanisms are operative in ZA-treated DC,
  which causes upregulation of ABCA1 and apoA-1 expression and extracellular IPP and
  apoA-I release. The supernatant from ZA-treated DC contains sufficient amounts of
  IPP and apoA-I to induce the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. The question mark in
  the right panel indicates that the mechanisms by which soluble IPP released in the
  supernatant from ZA-treated DC induces Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation remain to be elucidated.'
