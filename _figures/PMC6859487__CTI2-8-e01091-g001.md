caption: Schematic of basic metabolic pathways used in T cells. (Green) In oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle reduces redox cofactors,
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD),
  to generate NADH, FADH2 and CO2. NADH and FADH2 donate electrons to drive the electron
  transport chain (ETC). The ETC shuttles electrons through complexes I–IV, driving
  progressive export of protons into the intermembrane space of the mitochondria to
  establish a proton gradient, and terminating in the consumption of O2 and generation
  of H2O. The proton gradient (mitochondrial membrane potential) drives complex V
  [adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase] to generate ATP. The ETC can generate ROS,
  which can promote TCR signalling through NFAT and can trigger an antioxidant response
  through nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2). (Orange) Upstream of
  FAO, short‐chain fatty acids diffuse across cellular membranes, but long‐chain fatty
  acids are actively taken up by the cell through transporters such as CD36 and fatty
  acid transport proteins (FATPs) and shuttled in the cytosol by fatty acid binding
  proteins (FABP). Long‐chain fatty acids are modified and imported into the mitochondrial
  matrix by Cpt1, CptII and CAT, where FAO takes place to generate acetyl‐CoA that
  can enter the TCA cycle. (Purple) In FAS, citrate is withdrawn from the TCA cycle
  to generate fatty acids and lipids for storage in the cytosol. (Red) In glutaminolysis,
  glutamine is taken up by the cell via the glutamine transporters, such as CD98,
  converted to glutamate and then α‐ketoglutarate, which can enter the TCA cycle.
  (Aqua) In glycolysis, extracellular glucose is taken up via glucose transporters,
  such as Glut1, and subsequently processed in the cytosol to yield ATP, NADH and
  pyruvate. Pyruvate can either be (1) transported into the mitochondrial matrix by
  the mitochondrial pyruvate transporters (MPC) 1 and 2, where the PDH complex converts
  it to acetyl‐CoA to fuel the TCA cycle and OXPHOS, or (2) diverted away from the
  mitochondria, converted to lactate by LDH and exported from the cell as lactic acid,
  in a pathway variant known as ‘aerobic glycolysis’. (Brown) The PPP diverts metabolic
  intermediates of glycolysis for the synthesis of NADPH and ribonucleotides. (Blue)
  One‐carbon metabolism uses glycine or serine, which can also be diverted from metabolic
  intermediates of glycolysis, for biosynthesis of nucleotides, lipids, NADPH, GSH
  and substrate for methylation reactions. (Black) Engagement of these metabolic pathways
  is controlled by reciprocal regulation of AMPK and mTOR. In addition, metabolic
  intermediates such as acetyl‐CoA can be used to control activation of proteins and
  acetylation of histones.
