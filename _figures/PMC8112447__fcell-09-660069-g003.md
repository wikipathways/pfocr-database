caption: Schematic of the Wnt and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. (A) The inactive
  state of the Wnt signaling pathway. In the absence of Wnt ligands, the destruction
  complex (Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase 1 (CK1), and GSK3β)
  phosphorylates β-catenin, marking it for ubiquitination (Ub) by beta-transducin
  repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP). β-catenin is degraded by proteasomes, thus preventing
  transcription of Wnt target genes. (B) The activation of the Wnt signaling pathway
  occurs upon the binding of Wnt ligands to Frizzled receptors. Next, CK1 and GSK3β
  phosphorylate the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6)
  co-receptor, activating DVL, which inhibits the destruction complex and prevents
  the degradation of β-catenin. Stabilized β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm
  and translocates to the nucleus as a transcriptional co-activator with T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) to induce transcription of Wnt target genes. (C) The PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway. Growth factors bind to a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), causing
  dimerization and autophosphorylation of the receptors. PI3K is recruited to the
  membrane and catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate
  (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) which is negatively regulated
  by phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). PIP3 activates Akt, a serine/threonine
  kinase that regulates numerous cell survival and cell cycle processes, including
  the inhibition of GSK3β and TSC1/2. The inhibition of TSC1/2 releases Rheb to activate
  mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), comprised of mTOR and the regulatory associated protein
  of mTOR (Raptor). The upregulation of mTORC1 activates several important cellular
  processes including protein synthesis, proliferation, cell growth, and autophagy.
  During times of cellular metabolic stress, LKB1, a serine-threonine kinase, activates
  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which activates TSC2 and inhibits Raptor to
  downregulate mTORC1 signaling. This figure was constructed using information from
  several reviews (; ; ; ; ).
