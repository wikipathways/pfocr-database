caption: 'ABCB6 is an integral membrane transporter in the heme biosynthetic pathway.
  This figure depicts the role of ABCB6 in heme and porphyrin biosynthesis, other
  avenues of poryhyrin uptake have been excluded. We speculate that when ABCB6 function
  is altered metabolites proceed through a nonenzymatic branch of the pathway resulting
  in accumulation of uroporyphyrinogen I and coproporphyrinogen I. The first step
  in the heme biosynthetic pathway, the condensation of of glycine and succinyl CoA
  by ALA synthase, has been omitted for clarity. Note: A non-energy dependent route
  for mitochondrial porphyrin uptake has been noted (see reference #), but its properties
  have not been defined.'
