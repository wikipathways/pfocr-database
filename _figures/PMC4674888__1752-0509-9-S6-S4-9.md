caption: Development WNT signaling pathway Part 1. Degradation of beta catenin which
  is the second scored pathway map in MetaCore enrichment analysis results. Ubiquitin
  was down-regulated in stoke samples at 3, 5, 24 hours and overall stroke samples
  as compared with control. HDAC1 was down-regulated in overall stroke samples.
