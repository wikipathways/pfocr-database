caption: RREB1-involved in MAPK signaling pathway. MAPK signaling pathway includes
  several core members Ras, Raf, MEK1/2 and Erk1/2. Extracellular stimuli activate
  the MAPK cascade and subsequently the activated Erk1/2 phosphorylates RREB1 to mediate
  its transcriptional activity. This process will be blocked by MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126.
  MiR-143 and miR-145 act as tumor suppressor in the pancreatic cancer and colorectal
  cancer by targeting MAPK signaling pathway. The activated RREB1 binds to RRE in
  the promoter of miR-143 and miR-145 and inhibits the transcription of miR-143 and
  miR-145 to remove the inhibition.
