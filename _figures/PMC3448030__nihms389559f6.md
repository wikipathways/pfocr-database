caption: '(A) APP processing pathways. Left: Non-amyloidogenic processing is initiated
  by α-secretase to produce C83, which is further processed by γ-secretase to produce
  the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) and the p3 peptide. Right:
  amyloidogenic processing is initiated by β-secretase to produce C99, which is further
  processed by γ-secretase to produce the AICD and the Aβ peptide. The Aβ peptide
  can form toxic oligomers and aggregates. Proteins affected by AS are highlighted
  in blue. (B) Alternative splicing of presenilin impacts γ-secretase activity. Exon
  9 removal in PS1 results in a constitutively active form of the protein by considerably
  shortening the autoinhibitory loop and removing the endoproteolytic cleavage site.
  Exon 5 skipping in PS2 results in protein truncation after the autoinhibitory loop,
  creating a variant that is missing the CTF that is required for catalytic activity.
  (C) Exon 4 removal in APH-1b results in removal of the entire fourth TM segment,
  causing inverted topology of the last three TM segments (purple). This also results
  in the omission of the GXXXG motif that is required for γ-secretase assembly. (D)
  AS of the 5-HT4 receptor results in a much shorter C-terminal tail, which presumably
  alters the signaling properties of this GPCR.'
