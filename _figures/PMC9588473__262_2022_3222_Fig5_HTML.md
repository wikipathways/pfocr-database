caption: A schematic diagram presenting the proposed mechanisms underlying the effect
  of DKK3 on GBM. DKK3 interacts with proteins related to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  and immune system. Immune cells in GBM may induce cancer stemness, glioma cell proliferation,
  and an immunosuppressive GBM microenvironment, resulting in increased mortality,
  disease progression, and chemoresistance in patients with GBM. GBM, glioblastoma
