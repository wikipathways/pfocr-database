caption: 'NF-κB signaling (canonical and non-canonical) pathways. Several signals,
  including signals associated with immune receptors, could trigger the canonical
  pathways, which involve IKK complex activation by Tak1, IKK-mediated IκBα phosphorylation,
  and following degradation, consequential transient nuclear translocation of the
  prototypical NF-κB heterodimer P50/RelA. In the case of the non-canonical pathway,
  signals from a subset of TNFR members will trigger phosphorylation-induced p100
  processing, and this pathway is NIK- and IKKα-dependent, not trimeric IKK complex-dependent,
  intervening in the persistent activation of the RelB/p52 complex. BAFFR: B-cell-activating
  factor belonging to TNF family receptor; BCR: B cell receptor; CD40: Cluster of
  differentiation 40; TLRs: Toll-like receptors; TNFR: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
  receptor; TCR: T cell receptor; LTβR: Lymphotoxin β-receptor; TAK1: IKK-activating
  kinase-1; IKK: IκB kinase; RANK: Receptor activator for nuclear factor κB; RelA:
