caption: a Known therapeutic vulnerabilities and strategies of inducing SLFN11-mediated
  cell death. Potential synergistic effects between cytotoxic agents and epigenetic
  silencers targeting SLFN11; and potential synergistic effects between DDA and DDR
  agents. b SLFN11 induces replication block and cell death. Cell death leads to innate
  immune pathway cGAS-STING activation, which leads to upregulation of IFNs and immune
  activation. SLFN11 is upregulated by IFNs and increases chromatin accessibility,
  which leads to activation of IEGs and enhances SLFN11-dependent replication block
  and immune response. SLFN11 expression can also increase IFNγ-mediated cytotoxic
  T cell killing. DDA DNA-damaging agents, IEG immediate early genes, IFN interferon.
