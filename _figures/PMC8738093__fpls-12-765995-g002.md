caption: Regulation of the floral transition by the gibberellin signaling pathway
  in different photoperiods in SAM and Leaves. Proteins involved in signaling pathways
  under SD, LD or both photoperiods are shown in ovals with a blue, orange or blue-orange
  background, respectively. Positive regulatory interactions are depicted by blue
  arrows and negative interactions are depicted by red T-bars. The thick lines represent
  protein-protein interactions, whereas thin lines indicate transcriptional regulation.
  Unknown mechanisms are depicted by dotted lines. Protein complexes are depicted
  as partially overlapping ovals. The regulation by the PKL is not fully understood;
  therefore, the GA signaling proteins are placed in an oval with a dotted border.
  miRNA is indicated by an oval with a black border.
