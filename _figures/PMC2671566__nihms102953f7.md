caption: Signaling during the early (A, B) and late (C, D) phase of neuromuscular
  synapse formation. (A, B) Early during synapse formation, Wnt signals act through
  unplugged/MuSK receptor to establish a central muscle zone, possibly through a Dsh-dependant,
  PCP like pathway. LRP4 is essential for MuSK localization, and Dok-7 for MuSK activation
  (). Ligand dependent unplugged/MuSK activation may rapidly become ligand-independent.
  One branch of this pathway requires rapsyn to cluster AChRs (red ovals in B) in
  a central prepattern, while through a rapsyn-independent mechanism, e.g. modifications
  of the ECM components (dark red stars in B), growth cones are restricted to the
  central zone. In the absence of Wnt or unplugged/MuSK, rapsyn is not activated and
  thus AChRs are dispersed throughout the muscle and navigating growth cones extend
  into lateral muscle territory. Blue shades indicate the central zone. (C, D) During
  the late phase, nerve-derived agrin signals through unplugged/MuSK and LRP4 to recruit
  rapsyn, which stabilizes neural AChRs and promotes synapse development. (D) In the
  absence of unplugged/MuSK, rapsyn is not recruited and thus AChR cluster are not
  stabilized in the central zone. Absence of unplugged also causes rapsyn-independent
  pathfinding defects, possibly through the lack of ECM modifications. Note that in
  the absence of a central muscle zone at the early stages, no AChR prepattern forms,
  but that local agrin secretion from the axon and late expression of unplugged/MuSK
  appears sufficient to induce neural AChRs and subsequently functional synapses.
