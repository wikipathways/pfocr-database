caption: Schematic illustrating the negative regulation of the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway by the cytoplasmic APC protein. The shift from the inactive state ‘1’ to
  the active state ‘2’ is determined by the nuclear buildup of β-catenin, a crucial
  factor. Once present in significant amounts within the nucleus, β-catenin interacts
  with TCF/LEF family transcription factors, leading to alterations in gene transcription.
  The active state ‘2’ of the Wnt signaling pathway is a distinguishing trait of colorectal
  cancer cells, facilitating a proliferative and survival-friendly milieu for cancer
  cells. GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; CK1, casein kinase 1; TCF, transcription
  factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor; β-TrCP, β-transducin repeat-containing
  protein
