caption: The extracellular domain consists of five cadherin-type repeats bound together
  by calcium ions, forming a parallel cadherin dimer. In the cytoplasmic domain, the
  core universal-catenin complex consists of p120 catenin bound to the juxta-membrane
  region, and β-catenin, bound to the distal region, which in turn binds α-catenin;
  α-catenin then binds through actin or actin-binding proteins [,]. In contrast, while
  epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds to its receptor (EGFR) and activates EGFR, the
  phosphorylation of β-catenin and GSK-3β are induced. This leads to dissociation
  of β-catenin from the cadherin-catenin protein complex and translocation into the
  nucleus (phosphorylated GSK-3β also induces uncoupling of β-catenin from the destruction
  complex and translocation into the core through the canonical Wnt signaling pathway).
  Consequently, nuclear β-catenin binds with TCF/LEF and induces the transcription
  of the Wnt target gene, which affects the cell cycle, migration, and invasion [,].
