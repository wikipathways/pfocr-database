caption: A model on the inhibition of Snx3-retromer-mediated retrieval of Kex2 from
  the pre-vacuolar compartment to TGN by α-syn. (A) α-syn binds to PI3P, and this
  binding inhibits the binding of Snx3-retromer to the endosome surface. The cargo,
  Kex2, then trafficks by default to the vacuole. (B) In the absence of α-syn, Kex2
  (and Ste13) cycle between the pre-vacuolar compartment and the trans-Golgi in a
  Snx3-retromer dependent manner. α-syn disrupts Snx3-retromer association with PI3P,
  resulting in the mis-processing of α-factor and concomitant degradation of Kex2
  in the vacuole.
