caption: Sesquiterpene lactone metabolism in the Asteraceae family. A, Characterized
  sesquiterpene oxidases in the biosynthetic pathways of sesquiterpene lactones in
  the Asteraceae subfamilies. Among these sesquiterpene oxidases, amorphadiene oxidase
  (AMO) occurs in a single species, Artemisia annua of the Asteroideae subfamily,
  while germacrene A oxidase (GAO) is present in six species in four subfamilies (underlined).
  Bootstrap values are given at each node. B, Oxidation of sesquiterpenes in the biosynthetic
  pathways of sesquiterpene lactones. In artemisinin biosynthesis (left), amorphadiene
  is oxidized by AMO to form artemisinic aldehyde (a biological precursor of artemisinin)
  and further to artemisinic acid, which can be chemically converted to artemisinin
  (dashed arrow). Costunolide biosynthesis (right) is considered the general sesquiterpene
  lactone pathway in the Asteraceae. ADS, Amorphadiene synthase; GAS, germacrene A
  synthase; DBR, double-bond reductase; COS, costunolide synthase.
