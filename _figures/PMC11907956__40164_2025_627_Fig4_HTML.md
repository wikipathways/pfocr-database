caption: Structure and PTMs of PD-L1 (phosphorylation, glycosylation and ubiquitination): Presented
  here is a schematic diagram that illustrates the functional domains of PD-L1 as
  well as its diverse PTMs. PD-L1 is composed of two extracellular immunoglobulin-like
  domains, a transmembrane (TM) region, and an intracellular domain (ICD), and is
  regulated by multiple PTMs, including N-glycosylation (G, yellow hexagons), phosphorylation
  (P, orange circles), and ubiquitination (Ub, red circles). The corresponding modified
  amino acid residues, upstream regulators, and the outcomes of each post-translational
  modification are indicated in the figure. PD-L1 can be phosphorylated by GSK3α,
  GSK3β, NEK2, AMPK, and JAK1. STT3, B3GNT3, GLT1D1, EGF and FKBP51s can promote the
  glycosylation of PD-L1. PD-L1 can be polyubiquitinated by E3 ubiquitin ligases β-TRCP,
  SPOP, TRIM21, STUB1, TNFAIP3, HRD1, ARIH1, NEDD4, RNF125, and MARCH8. PD-L1 can
  be deubiquitinated by deubiquitinating enzymes CSN5, OTUB1, USP5, USP7, USP8, USP9X,
  USP21, and USP22. GSK3β, CDK4, Caspase8, Trimethoxyflavone, and GSK3α, as the corresponding
  upstream pathways, can promote the ubiquitination of PD-L1 mediated by the corresponding
  E3 ubiquitin ligases, while CDK5 and CMTM 6 respectively inhibit the ubiquitination
  of PD-L1 mediated by TRIM21 and STUB1. GSK3 Glycogen synthase kinase 3, STAT3 Signal
