caption: Upon engagement by ligand, receptor-associated Janus Kinases (Jaks) become
  activated and phosphorylate both each other and the intracellular tail of their
  receptors, thereby creating docking sites for latent, cytoplasmic transcription
  factors termed signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Jak-mediated
  phosphorylation activates STATs, which in turn directly bind DNA and regulate gene
  expression (, ). There are four Jaks, Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2, which selectively
  bind different receptor chains (). The selective usage of Jaks by different receptors
  explains their distinct in vivo roles () and becomes particularly important with
  the generation of pharmacological inhibitors when specific or relatively discrete
  functional outcomes are sought.
