caption: Altered CREB/E2F1 signalling networks in co-treated HMCs. A. Pathway analysis
  with Ingenuity IPA software identified interacting partners of CREB differentially
  expressed in response to treatment with TGFβ. B. In comparison, fewer genes related
  to CREB signalling were differentially expressed in co-treated cells. C. Similarly,
  pathway analysis identified E2F1 interacting partners in cells treated with TGFβ.
  D. The number of E2F1 partners was enriched by co-treatment with TGFβ and CCN2.
  Interacting partners coloured pink/red were increased in expression in response
  to treatment, those coloured green were decreased in expression.
