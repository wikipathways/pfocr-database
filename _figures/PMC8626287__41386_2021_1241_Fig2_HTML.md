caption: A Proposed mechanisms of action of ketamine and sleep deprivation on the
  glutamatergic synapse. (1) ketamine and sleep deprivation activate astrocytes, which
  induces the exocytosis of adenosine, stimulating the P2 × 7 (ATP-gated P2X receptor
  cation channel family) receptor and releasing glutamate (GLU) into the intraneuronal
  space. Adenosine also binds A1R in NSCs inducing its proliferation via MEK/ERK-AKT
  pathways [, –]. Astrocytes might further receive humoral signals acting as zeitgebers
  from blood vessels thereby contributing to circadian neuronal activity [, ]. (2)
  Ketamine blocks NMDA receptors at the inhibitory GABAergic interneuron, leading
  to disinhibition of glutamatergic transmission []. (3) In turn, glutamate triggers
  the release of BDNF at postsynaptic neurons leading to stimulation of the TrkB-AKT-mTOR
  and subsequent synaptic protein synthesis [, , ]. Inhibition of GSK3β (which is
  controlled by the circadian clock) contributes to the activation of mTOR [, –].
  Dopamine also contributes to plasticity via the AKT-GSK3 pathway []. B Neuronal
  plasticity might be further enhanced by the inhibition (or phase-shift) of the BMAL1-CLOCK
  recruitment to Per2 Dusp1, Notch2, or Homer1 promoters []. Per2 functions as a scaffold
  to recruit TSC1, Raptor, and mTOR suppressing mTOR activity [], Dusp1 negatively
  regulates the MAPK pathway by dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 []. The transcriptional
  reduction of Dusp1 might disinhibit ERK1/2 which in turn blocks the TSC2 complex
  resulting in the induction of mTOR-mediated protein synthesis. Also, ERK1/2 activates
  the CREB-mediated transcription of bdnf, which indirectly induces protein synthesis
  by blocking the TSC2 complex via AKT. The transcriptional reduction of Notch1 promotes
  the neurogenesis involved in neural stem cell (NSC) maintenance []. Homer1 transcription
  is further modulated by CREB and participates in the synaptic plasticity-induced
  by sleep deprivation and ketamine [, ]. These mechanisms would be operating in different
  brain areas related to mood reward, and cognitive demanding tasks such as memory,
  attention, and decision-making such as the mPFC, hippocampus, striatum, ACC, and
  other brain regions.
