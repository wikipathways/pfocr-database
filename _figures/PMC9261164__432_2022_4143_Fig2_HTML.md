caption: Molecular mechanisms of epithelial defense against cancer (EDAC) in RasV12-transformed
  cells and neighboring normal cells. Normal cells recognize transformed cells via
  the cell–surface interaction between leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B3 (LILRB3)
  and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I), where MHC class-I is
  highly expressed on transformed cells and LILRB3 is on neighboring normal cells.
  Differential ephrin type A receptor 2 (EphA2)–ephrin A signaling is also thought
  to contribute to the detection of RasV12-transformed cells in epithelial cell sheets.
  The MHC-I-LILRB3 interaction triggers the accumulation of cytoskeletal protein filamin
  (FLN) and the intermediate filament protein vimentin (VIM) in neighboring normal
  cells at the interface of two types of cells. In addition, there are other molecules
  which also promote the accumulation of filamin, including exogenous sphingosine-1-phosphate
  (S1P) and intrinsic ADAMDEC1. Exogenous S1P mediates filamin accumulation through
  the activation of Rho/Rhok pathway via its interaction with S1PR2. In the transformed
  cells, epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN) is recruited, and the accumulation
  of filamin and EPLIN is mutually influenced, while plectin just promote accumulation
  of EPLIN. These collective cytoskeletal rearrangements in both cells facilitate
  the apical extrusion of transformed cells. Signaling downstream of EPLIN accumulation
  leads to the suppression of mitochondrial membrane potential, which is required
  for extrusion. Increased glucose uptake is also observed in the transformed cells,
  indicating the possible role of metabolic alteration in EDAC
