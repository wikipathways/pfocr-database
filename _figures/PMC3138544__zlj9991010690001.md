caption: Targets and therapies for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) within the
  context of the 10 hallmarks of cancer and overlapping oncogenic signaling pathways.
  (A) B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) composed of membrane immunoglobulin and associated
  Igα/Igβ (CD79a/CD79b) when bound to antigen (Ag) leads to BCR aggregation, while
  the α-β heterodimer transduces signals that rapidly activate Src family kinases
  Lyn (Blk and Fyn) and immediate downstream tyrosine kinases spleen tyrosine kinase
  (Syk) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), initiating a complex signaling cascade
  involving multiple adaptors, protein kinases, phosphatases, GTPases, and transcription
  factors that result in distinct consequences, including differentiation, survival,
  apoptosis, proliferation, and tolerance. Negative feedback loops that regulate BCR
  signaling (Lyn/CD22/Shp-1 pathway, SHIP, Cbl, Dok-1, Dok-3, FcγRIIB1, PIR-B, and
  BCR internalization) are not included in figure. In aggressive B-NHL, uncontrolled
  activation and proliferation of B-cells resulting from chronic active BCR signaling
  have been targeted and include (1) Syk (fostamatinib), (2) Btk (PCI-32765), (3)
  protein kinase C beta (PCKβ; enzastaurin), and (4) mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR; temsirolimus, everolimus, deferolimus), highlighted in green with red inhibitor
  sign. Therapeutic targets in orange with red inhibitor sign with question mark are
  targets in B-NHL for which drugs are or may be available for evaluation in clinical
  trials. The aberrantly activated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway has been
  targeted by overwhelming stress response by inhibiting (5) proteasome (bortezomib).
  Insensitivity to growth inhibitory signaling by epigenetic modulation has been evaluated
  by blocking (6) histone deacytelace (vorinostat, mocetinostat). Targeting other
  epigenetic enzymes such as DNA methyltrasferase (DNMT) is of interest, particularly
  as combinations. Agents promoting apoptosis (7) BCL2/BCLXL (ABT263) have entered
  clinical trials with promising activity. (B) Limitless replicative potential can
  be halted by inhibiting cell-cycle kinases (8) G1-S-G2 phase (cyclin-dependent kinases,
  checkpoint kinases) and (9) M phase (Aurora A/B). (C) Key hallmarks in the extracellular-stromal
  compartment critical for targeted therapies include (10) immune evasion (lenalidomide;
  inhibits T regulatory cells [Tregs]), invasion, and metastasis; neo-angiogenesis
  (bevacizumab, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor/platelet-derived growth
  factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors); cytokines (AMD3100); and tumor-stroma
  interactions. BCAP, B-cell adaptor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; PLCγ2, phospholipase C gamma 2; BLNK, B-cell linker; GRB2, growth factor
  receptor-bound protein 2; LAB, linker of activated B cells; SOS, son of sevenless;
  CARMA1, Caspase recruitment domain–containing membrane-associated guanylate kinase
  protein 1; MALT, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue; IKK, IκB kinase; TSC2, tuberous
  sclerosis protein 2; Me, methyl; His, histone; HDAC, histone deacetylase acetylation.
