caption: Schematic of the complement system. The complement cascade consists of 4
  activation pathways, including the recently characterized intrinsic pathway, all
  of which converge upon a terminal pathway that results in the assembly of the membrane
  attack complex (MAC). Multiple complement regulatory proteins act at different levels
  to modulate the system. The complement components and regulatory molecues that are
  localized in drusen are highlighted by an asterisk.
