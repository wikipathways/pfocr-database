caption: Comparison between the biosynthesis of isoprenoids in photosynthetic organisms
  (A) and the biosynthesis pathway proposed in haloarchaea (B). C5 prenyl units are
  synthesized via the mevalonate pathway starting from two acetyl-CoA molecules and
  C2 unit arising from amino acid degradation. Cis- and trans-prenyl chains are derived
  through head-tail (HT) condensation steps with isopentenyl-diphosphate (IPP). C15
  and C20 prenyl chains are modified by head-head condensations and desaturase reactions.
  Genes coding for the enzymes catalysing those reactions have been identified in
  the Halobacterium salinarum genome. β-Carotene is the precursor for retinal synthesis
  while lycopene is the precursor for bacterioruberines in the pathway proposed from
  the Halobacterium salinarum’s genomic analysis []. Preliminary evidence from other
  genomic analysis (Haloferax sp.) also support this proposal []. Details about genes,
  enzymes and chemical reactions involved in retinal and bacterioruberines synthesis
  are far from known. There are not reports about the biosynthesis reactions of other
  carotenoids such as zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, astaxanthin, etc. in haloarchaea.
  GPP = geranyl diphosphate; FPP = farnesyl diphosphate; GGPP = geranylgeranyl diphosphate.
