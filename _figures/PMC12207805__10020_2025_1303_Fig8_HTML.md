caption: The proposed mechanism by which L-Phe promotes liver steatosis. L-Phe reduces
  BNIP3 expression, thereby inhibiting BNIP3 recruitment of LC3B to form autophagosomes
  and initiate mitophagy to clear dysfunctional mitochondria. The accumulation of
  dysfunctional mitochondria promotes fatty acid synthesis by inhibiting AMPK and
  activating mTOR while inhibiting fatty acid β-oxidation through the suppression
  of the PPARα signalling pathway, resulting in lipid droplet deposition in the liver
  and incident liver steatosis
