caption: 'The Entner-Doudoroff and the pentose phosphate pathways in H. boliviensis.
  Enzymes highlighted in blue were the subject of this study. Numbers and abbreviations
  for each metabolic step refer to the number of alleles and the cluster that the
  alleles formed with: P, Proteobacteria; B, bacteria; T, thermophilic archaea; A,
  non-thermophilic archaea and combinations of these groups of organisms. Database
  accession numbers for enzymes of H. boliviensis are provided in Table . EC numbers
  for the enzymes in the metabolisms are pointed out as classified in the KEGG pathway
  database, and are listed in Table'
