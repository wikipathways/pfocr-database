caption: A dendritic cell detects tumor‐derived DNA, which often stems from cancer
  cells undergoing necrosis. After binding to cyclic GMP AMP synthase (cGAS), cGAMP
  is produced which activates STING, thereby resulting in increased interferon production
  and T‐cell‐priming events in the lymph node. Researchers are trying to identify
  synthetic STING agonists to activate this pathway.
