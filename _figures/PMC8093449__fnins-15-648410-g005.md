caption: GABBR1 may influence acetylcholinesterase regulation. GABBR1 is an autism-associated
  gene that codes for a membrane-bound protein (GABAB1) (). The binding of the neurotransmitter
  GABA to GABAB1 has several implications for cholinergic signaling, sensory signal
  transduction, and ion transport, across multiple cascades. As depicted here, a typical
  GABA/GABBR1 binding cascade inhibits adenylyl cyclases (ADCY), thereby preventing
  positive upregulation of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE). This figure was extracted
  from Pathway Studio’s curated pathways and was edited according to the needs of
  this study.
