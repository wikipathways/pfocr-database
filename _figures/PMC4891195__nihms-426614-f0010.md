caption: (1) Injury to neurons induces the synthesis of apoE. ApoE (apoE4 > apoE3)
  is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage in neurons, and the neurotoxic fragments
  that are generated escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction
  and cytoskeletal alterations. This is most likely to occur when apoE4 is expressed
  (apoE4 > apoE3) due to its abnormal protein conformation (instability and domain
  interaction). (2) Exogenous apoE, primarily from astrocytes, could cause neuronal
  injury and could generate neurotoxic fragments by being shunted to the ER/Golgi
  apparatus, where proteolysis could occur. In addition, exogenous apoE does impact
  Aβ clearance/deposition. (3) Aβ expression can be induced by injured/stressed neurons,
  and together with other injurious agents could perpetuate the toxic cycle of injury
  in neurons. This would include apoE synthesis followed by proteolytic cleavage,
  toxic fragment formation, and neuropathology.
