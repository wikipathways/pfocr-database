caption: Schematic illustration of the rationale for possible targeted therapies in
  CMTC. Blocking the constitutive activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  could play an essential role in the treatment of CMTC through the degradation of
  β-catenin by stabilizing Axin2 (tankyrase inhibitors), CK1 agonists (SSTC3), inhibitors
  targeting β-catenin-TFC transcription complex (LF3), CBP inhibitors, as well as
  porcupine inhibitors, but data on clinical efficacy and safety are still insufficient.
  E2 via ER would have a tumor-promoting role through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the RAS/RAF/MAPK
  signaling pathways, which would justify treatment with both antiestrogens (tamoxifen
  and aromatase inhibitors) and MKI inhibitors. The detection of additional somatic
  events (e.g. RET rearrangements) could be subsidiary to treatment with specific
  inhibitors. CMTC, morular cribriform thyroid carcinoma; E2, estrogens; ER, estrogen
