caption: The histiocytoses show variation in clinical and pathologic features, but
  the molecular alterations that drive the neoplastic process typically converge on
  common signaling pathways. The same pathway is targeted in primary and secondary
  H/DC sarcomas, which typically show more marked cytologic atypia. The presence of
  specific inhibitors that can target components of the pathway has led to advances
  in clinical management and improved prognosis in neoplasms of the histiocytic and
  dendritic cell lineages. The figure has been adapted from Figure 1 in the article
  by Kemps et al that begins on page 256.
