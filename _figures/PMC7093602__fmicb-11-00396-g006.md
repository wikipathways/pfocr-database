caption: Protein and metabolite changes of the amino acids metabolism in S. pogona
  and S. spinosa. The protein changes are from iTraq-labeled identification results.
  The proteins identified are indicated in purple. The proteins indicated in triangle
  pattern (red or blue) represent significant differences in S. pogona. The metabolite
  changes are from metabolomic analysis results. The metabolites indicated in arrow
  (red or blue) represent significant differences in S. pogona. The multistep reaction
  is indicated in consecutive arrows. P, phosphate.
