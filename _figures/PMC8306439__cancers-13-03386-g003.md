caption: 'Overview of the PI3K(p85/p110)/AKT/mTOR pathway and small molecule compounds
  that target this pathway in synergy with OV therapy. (A) Activating (PI3K, AKT,
  PDK1, mTORC1 and mTORC2) and inhibiting proteins (PTEN, TSC1/2) of the signaling
  pathway are shown. PI3K consists of catalytic subunit p110 and the regulatory subunit
  p85. PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, which in turn activates
  PDK1 and AKT. PTEN negatively regulates the activation of AKT, which can inhibit
  TSC1/2, a negative regulator of mTOR. Active mTOR phosphorylates S6K1 and 4EBP1
  leading to increased translation and synthesis of, among others, ISGs []. Targeting
  this process by means of different small molecule inhibitors (red annotated squares)
  allows OV replication to proceed for longer, resulting in increased viral spread
  and efficacy. See the main text for more details. Created with biorender.com. (B)
  Selected chemical structures of compounds depicted in panel A. All structures throughout
  were drawn using MarvinSketch (ChemAxon) from publicly available information. Abbreviations:
  RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1; IRS1,
  insulin receptor substrate 1; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin. PKR, protein kinase R; Myx, GTP-binding protein MX; AOS, oligoadenylate
  synthetase; S6K, S6 kinase; 4E-BP1, Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding
  protein 1; Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate
