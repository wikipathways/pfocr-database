caption: Research summary of this study. Our work began with evaluation of diuretic
  activity of Yuanhua (with or without combination of Gancao), and found that Gancao
  impaired the diuretic efficacy of Yuanhua. After studying some key factors in urine
  formation process, renal AQP 2 was proved the key target in Yuanhua’s diuretic activity
  and Gancao’s counteraction effect. Further, in renal collecting duct cells we found
  Yuanhuacine and Genkwanin dose-dependently decreased AQP 2 expression; oppositely,
  Glycyrrhetinic acid increased AQP 2 expression. The activity of these compounds
  were also verified in-vivo. Network pharmacology study revealed that these compounds
  could bind to MEK1 or FGFR1 protein and lead to regulations of ERK-MAPK pathway,
  which was verified by western blotting. At last, we conclude that the interaction
  in diuretic efficacy between Yuanhua and Gancao are due to differentially regulated
  renal AQP 2, which was mediated by ERK-MAPK signaling pathway.
