caption: Denosumab acts similarly to OPG, which is RANKL's natural decoy receptor;
  denosumab binds to RANKL, preventing the binding of RANKL to its receptor, RANK,
  on the surface of osteoclasts and also on osteoclast precursors. Thus, the RANK
  signaling pathway is not activated, resulting in impaired osteoclast precursor differentiation
  and function and possibly osteoclast apoptosis. All these effects lead to inhibition
  of bone resorption. Bisphosphonates act on osteoclasts, but not on their precursors.
  Bisphosphonates are internalized into osteoclasts possibly by endocytosis. Subsequently,
  bisphosphonates inhibit FPP synthase, a key enzyme in the mevalonate signaling pathway.
  This leads to impaired intracellular protein prenylation impairing osteoclast function
  and apoptosis. Thus, bone resorption is inhibited.
