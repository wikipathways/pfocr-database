caption: Schematic of injury-induced nociceptor sensitization via the Bone Morphogenetic
  Protein (BMP) Pathway. Injury by ultraviolet light activates the BMP signaling pathway
  including ligands, receptors, transducers, other mediators and, as demonstrated
  by the described experiments, the transcriptional repressor Brinker (Brk) and recruited
  activator Schnurri (Shn). In response, transcription of effector genes is regulated
  to sensitize the nociceptor and thereby promote healing.
