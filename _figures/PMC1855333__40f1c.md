caption: This proposed model integrates the molecular models of ovarian cancer with
  the fimbrial model of serous carcinogenesis, further taking into account cell of
  origin and pattern of spread.,,, The pathway on the right originates in the ovarian
  epithelial inclusions, giving rise to most Type I neoplasms (and less commonly,
  serous carcinomas) by step-wise mutations, and includes endometriosis, benign and
  borderline cystadenomas. The pathway on the left would arise in either the fimbrial
  mucosa or tubal epithelium that has become adherent to the ovarian cortex (endosalpingiosis).
  In this pathway, the initial step consists of a p53 mutation following genotoxic
  injury (the “p53 signature”). In the fimbria, a tubal intraepithelial carcinoma
  (TIC) develops in some instances and may invade locally or exfoliate to other peritoneal
  (e.g., ovary or pelvis) surfaces. Depending on the location and rate of tumor growth,
  the tumor might be presumed to originate from the tube, ovary, or peritoneum. This
  would explain many, but not all, high grade (Type II) tumors.
