caption: TRAIL signaling pathway and some points of therapeutic intervention. The
  functional TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 can be activated by proapoptotic receptor
  agonists such as Mapatumumab (DR4), Lexatumumab (DR5) and Dulanermin (both DR4 and
  DR5). Some drugs, such as HDAC inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors, augment apoptosis
  by upregulation of receptor expression. Caspase 8 is activated downstream of receptor
  activation. This activation is prevented by FLIP, which in turn is inhibited by
  AS-PTO and quercetin. The mitochondrial activation through Bid cleavage is counteracted
  by pro-survival BCL2 protein family members such as BCL2 and MCL1, which can be
  downregulated by HA 14-1 and ABT-737. Further downstream, caspase 9 activation is
  prevented by survivin, which can be pharmacologically inhibited by cisplatin and
  SM-164. For additional details, please refer to the text.
