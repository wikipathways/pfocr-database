caption: Metabolic pathways in macrophage activation. Macrophages are the key players
  involved in adipose tissue homeostasis. Under obese conditions, there is an influx
  of pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1). M1 macrophages have increased HIF1α levels
  that result in increased glycolysis and engagement of the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP). M1 macrophages have increased iNOS levels and secrete various pro-inflammatory
  cytokines like TNF-α. During normal homeostasis, adipose tissue is enriched with
  alternatively activated macrophages (M2) that rely mostly on oxidative phosphorylation
  for its energy requirements. Increased PPARγ and PGC1-β regulates lipid metabolism
  with increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO). mTOR also plays a crucial role in modulating
  lipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. M2 macrophages are characterized
  by Arg-1 expression and anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10.
