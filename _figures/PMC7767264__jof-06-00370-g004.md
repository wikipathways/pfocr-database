caption: 'Representation of genes/pathways/transcription factors identified from host–pathogen
  interaction during aflatoxin production. This pathway has added an understanding
  of gene regulation and regulatory networks at the gene expression level. The genes/proteins/pathways/resistant
  factors illustrated represent the crop resistant factors that control AP contamination.
  The components represented in red color are the important genes and transcription
  factors enriched in our study. In brief, the first host–pathogen interaction occurs
  at the seed coat, wax and cutin which provide the first layer of defense against
  A. flavus. At the initial stage, nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeats
  (NBS-LRR), elicitors and oxylipins play an important role in host–pathogen interactions.
  Transcription factors such as WRKY, bHLH, MYB, ERF, ARF trigger JA, SA and phenyl
  propanoid biosynthesis pathways to evoke defense responsive mechanism against A.
  flavus. In this defense responsive mechanism, PR proteins, linoleate 9S-lipoxygenase
  1 protein (LOX) genes, secondary metabolites like anthocyanin, chalcone, phytoalexin
  compounds like resveratrol synthase/stilbene synthase are expressed during infection
  and play an important role at the second level of resistance mechanism. Abbreviations:
  JA—Jasmonic acid; SA—Salicyclic acid; ROS—Reactive oxygen species; PR—pathogenesis-related
  proteins; MAPK—Mitogen activated protein kinases; AFB1—aflatoxin B1; SOD—superoxide
  dismutase; Transcription factors—NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2 domain proteins), ERF—Ethylene
  responsive factors; NPR-1.'
