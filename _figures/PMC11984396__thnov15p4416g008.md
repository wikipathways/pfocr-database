caption: Activation of CAP by electrical cervical nerve stimulation and splenic ultrasound
  stimulation to combat inflammation. During this process, the sympathetic splenic
  nerves release NE, which binds to β2AdrRs on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-expressing
  CD4+ T cells. These T cells subsequently secrete Ach, which activates α7nAChRs on
  Mφs. The α7nAChR signaling pathway inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  thereby reducing inflammation
