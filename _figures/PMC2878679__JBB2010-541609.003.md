caption: 'Conceptual design and biological implementation of the oscillatory circuit
  metabolator in Fung et al. []. (a) Conceptual design. The metabolator consists of
  two interconverting metabolite pools M1 and M2; their interconversions are catalyzed
  by the enzymes E1 and E2. Dashed lines indicate positive (arrow) and negative (blunt
  bar) regulation by M2 at the transcriptional or translational level; the accumulation
  of M2 represses E1 and induces E2. The circuit functions as follows. Influx into
  the circuit (from upstream processes) increases the concentration of M1, which is
  converted to M2 by E1. Initially the concentration of M1 is high and M2 is low.
  However, M2 gradually accumulates causing E1 to be repressed and E2 to be induced,
  eventually causing a net conversion of M2 to M1, which then starts a new cycle.
  (b) Biological implementation. The design of the metabolator was implemented using
  the acetate pathway in E. coli. The M1 pool is acetyl-CoA; the M2 pool consists
  of AcP, OAc−, and HOAc. Pta and Acs correspond to enzymes E1 and E2. Pta converts
  Acetyl-CoA to AcP, and AcP is further converted to OAc− by Ack. The protonated form
  of OAc− (HOAc) is permeable across the cell membrane. AcP is used as a signaling
  molecule and functions as follows. When AcP builds up, it will activate promoter
  glnAp2 through phosphorylation. The promoter glnAp2 controls the expression of Acs
  and lac repressor (LacI), and LacI in turn represses the expression of Pta. Ack:
  acetate kinase; AcP: acetyl phosphate; Acs: acetyl-CoA synthetase; HOAc: protonated
  form of acetate; LacI: lac repressor; OAc−: acetate; Pta: phosphate acetyltransferase
