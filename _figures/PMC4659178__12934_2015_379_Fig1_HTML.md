caption: Engineered biosynthetic pathways for the phenylacetyl-HSL analogs in E. coli.
  The acyl-HSL synthase RpaI from Rhodopseudomonas palustris catalyzes the conversion
  of phenolic acid coenzyme A to phenylacetyl-HSL. The phenolic acid substrate is
  achieved through the conversion of l-tyrosine to p-coumaric acid by a tyrosine ammonia
  lyase (TAL) from Saccharothrix espanaensis, hydroxylation of p-coumaric acid to
  caffeic acid by Sam5 from S. espanaensis, and O-methylation of caffeic acid to ferulic
  acid by O-methyltransferase (COM) from Arabidopsis thaliana. A 4-coumarate-CoA ligase
  from Nicotiana tabacum (4CL2nt) generates the CoA-ester of the phenolic acid substrates,
  allowing lactone formation catalyzed by RpaI
