caption: 'MiRNA biogenesis, function in cytoplasm and nucleus-cytoplasm transport.
  The biogenesis of miRNA takes several steps. First, pri-miRNA is transcribed via
  RNA pol II and then cleaved into pre-miRNA by Drosha with DGCR8. Guided by Exportin
  5, pre-miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm, where Dicer cuts the stem-loop structure
  into a double-stranded RNA. The double-stranded RNA formed is then loaded onto Ago
  2. One is the mature miRNA, also known as the guide strand. The other is the passenger
  RNA, which is quickly degraded. Mature miRNA functions both in the cytoplasm and
  in the nucleus. Core RISC, the major cellular post-transcriptional silencing machinery,
  is composed of miRNA, Ago 2 and trinucleotide repeat containing 6 (TNRC6). MiRNA
  recognizes and binds the miRNA response element (MRE) on the mRNA. In the cytoplasm,
  there are three pathways for miRNAs to exert post-transcriptional silencing: 1)
  Ago2 recruits TNRC6, which then recruits CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. This complex
  leads to deadenylation and degradation of mRNA. 2) TNRC6 recruits Dcp 1/2 decapping
  complex which cleaves 5′ cap of mRNA and reduces mRNA stability. 3) With binding
  of Ago 2, mRNA is rendered inaccessible for ribosome attachment and function, which
  inhibits the translation process. Meanwhile, Ago 2 with mature miRNA is imported
  into the nucleus via Importin 8 and TNRC6 via Importin β. In the nucleus, RISC is
  assembled and functions in the transcriptional or post-transcriptional pathway.
  The nuclear RISC can be transported into cytoplasm via Exportin1 (also referred
  to as XPO1 or chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1)), which makes transport between
  the cytoplasm and the nucleus bidirectional. RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; TGS, transcriptional
