caption: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) sensing by the intracellular innate immunity throughout
  the virus life cycle. Upon attachment to cellular receptors, HCV is internalized
  by endocytosis (1). Uncoating is then triggered and the viral genome is released
  into the cytoplasm (2). At the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) surface, viral RNA is
  translated (3), producing a polyprotein that it is co- and post-translationally
  processed into 10 viral proteins. Viral proteins’ expression induces the formation
  of a membranous web, which is essential for viral replication (4). HCV hijacks the
  lipid transport machinery for assembly (5) and uses the endosomal secretory pathway
  to be transported to the plasma membrane (6), where virion release occurs (7). The
  cytosolic sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5) and protein kinase R (PKR) together with the membrane pattern recognition
  receptor toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognize viral RNA inducing the downstream
  activation of interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines’ production.3. Activation
  of the Intracellular Innate Immunity by HCV.
