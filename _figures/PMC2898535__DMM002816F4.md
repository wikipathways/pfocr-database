caption: A genetic model for regulation of polycystin signaling by cwp-5. Our studies
  support a model in which CWP-5 facilitates polycystin signaling by repressing latent,
  toxic effects of the polycystins on sensory transduction. In wild-type animals,
  the sensory signals that elicit response behavior in C. elegans males are transduced
  both by the canonical LOV-1/PKD-2 polycystin complex, as well as by a secondary,
  as-yet-unidentified pathway (designated ‘X’), as shown in the central line. When
  cwp-5 function is lost in animals lacking both polycystins, no effect is seen, indicating
  that cwp-5 acts in the polycystin pathway. However, the loss of cwp-5 enhances the
  sensory defects of single polycystin mutants; this enhancement is dependent on the
  function of the remaining polycystin. The simplest genetic explanation for these
  observations is that cwp-5 mutants reveal that each of the polycystins has a latent
  capacity to interfere with the secondary pathway, as indicated in the upper and
  lower pathways. In wild-type animals, cwp-5 is likely to prevent the manifestation
  of this aberrant function; in addition, cwp-5 may also directly facilitate the response-promoting
  activity of the polycystins (dashed line). See Discussion for details.
