caption: Diagram of the neuronal network for audiogenic seizures (AGSz) with emergent
  properties (indicated by cylinders) in each requisite site at which systemically
  administered drugs that block these seizures may act at therapeutic doses. The network
  is organized as a hierarchy beginning with the acoustic stimulus (1) input into
  the auditory pathway (2–4), including neurons in these nuclei (up to the level of
  the inferior colliculus, IC) (5), whichis the consensus seizure-initiating site.
  The IC projects to the brainstem locomotion network nuclei, including the deep layersof
  superior colliculus (DLSC) (6), projecting to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) (7)
  and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) (8) and brainstem reticular formation (BRF)
  (9), which project to the spinal cord (10). The hierarchical activation of each
  requisite network nucleus produces the sequential behaviors of AGSz (wild running
  followed by tonic flexion and tonic extension) (11). (The critical structure that
  initiates each behavior is shown below the behavior.) Neurons in the BRF and SNr
  are the only regions that are active during the postictal behavioral depression
  that follows the tonic extension behavior. Therapeutic doses of several drugs with
  anticonvulsant properties act to inhibit neurons in the IC, including competitive
  (c-) NMDA antagonists, such as 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate and GABA uptake inhibitor,
  tiagabine, as well as ethanol. Therapeutic doses of other drugs that are effectively
  anticonvulsant exert no effect on IC neurons, including an uncompetitive (uc-) NMDA
  antagonist (MK-801), gabapentin, lamotrigine, and phenytoin. Other effective anticonvulsant
  drugs act to reduce PAG neuronal firing such as gabapentin. Therapeutic doses of
  phenytoin selectively act to inhibit neurons in the BRFof the pons. The SNr is the
  target of MK-801, but the effect is to increase neuronal firing. The emergent property
  of each nucleus is seen as a confluence of influences onto the neurons in each nucleus,
  including neuroactive substances (red squares) released onto the neurons via synaptic
  transmission (ST) and from the blood vessels, cerebrospinal and extracellular fluids
  via volume transmission (VT), as shown in the expanded diagram of an emergent property
  on the left of the network. Systemically administered drugs reach each site via
  VT. Direct stimulation of any site within the network, either chemically or electrically,
  can affect seizure susceptibility and may modify the emergent properties in the
  affected site. (CN = cochlear nucleus; SOC = superior olivary complex, which are
  auditory structures important for input to the IC.) Brain regions in the auditory
  pathway rostral to the IC were not requisite to seizure induction, and in fact,
  no regions rostral to the level of the midbrain are requisite to these seizures.
  It should be noted that neurons in the lateral amygdala are affected by these seizures,
  but blockade of this region does not block seizures, rendering the amygdala as an
  ancillary site.
