caption: Latent infection of CD34+ HPCs results in the expression of HCMV miR-US5-2
  which directly targets the TGF-β transcriptional repressor NAB1 resulting in increased
  production and secretion of TGF-β. Secreted TGF-β acts on neighboring uninfected
  cells to mediate myelosuppression. Infected cells additionally express miR-UL22A
  which directly targets SMAD3 to block signaling through the TGF-β pathway which
  is required for efficient latency establishment and genome maintenance.
