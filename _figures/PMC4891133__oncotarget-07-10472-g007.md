caption: The binding of Shh to the 12-pass transmembrane receptor Ptch leads to the
  translocation and activation of Smo, a G protein-coupled receptor. Smo activates
  Gli1 through inhibiting SUFU, an inhibitors of Gli1. In addition, Smo activation
  also leads to the formation of the Gβ and Gγ heterodimer, which activates the PI-3-kinase
  pathway. AKT activation leads to cytoskeleton remodeling and cell motility. Snail
  expression can be transcriptionally induced by Gli1. The Shh pathway may also contribute
  to increased invasiveness by converting cells to cancer stem-like cell phenotype
  and c-Met activation.
