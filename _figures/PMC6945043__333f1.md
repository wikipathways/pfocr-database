caption: Embryonic origin of the E blastomere and simplified diagram of the gene regulatory
  network for endomesoderm specification in C. elegans. (A) The E cell and its sister
  cell MS are found ventrally in the 8-cell embryo (approximately 50 μm long). MS
  generates mesodermal cells including body muscles and the posterior portion of the
  pharynx, shown in red on the diagram of the larva (approximately 200 μm long). E
  generates the 20 cells of the intestine, whose nuclei are shown in green on the
  larva. (B) Specification of MS and E fates begins with the same SKN-1 and MED-1,2
  factors, but then bifurcates into an MS pathway that includes the T-box factor TBX-35
  and the homeobox factor CEH-51, while endoderm specification involves activation
  of END-3 and END-1. These upstream transient factors ultimately activate ELT-2 (and
  its paralogue ELT-7) which maintain intestinal fate. Additional input into E specification
  occurs by input from TCF/POP-1 and Caudal/PAL-1. All of MED-1,2, END-1,3 and ELT-2,7
  are GATA type transcription factors. Arrows indicate transcriptional activation
  of the gene encoding a downstream factor.
