caption: 'STRING connectivity network demonstrating a protein–protein interaction
  network of predicted functional partners for differentially expressed genes in the
  brown module. Nodes represent all proteins produced by a single protein coding gene
  locus. Edges represent specific or meaningful associations. Node color: axon guidance
  pathway (KEGG hsa04360) genes (red), second shell of interactors (white). Node size:
  protein of unknown three-dimensional (3D) structure (small), protein of known or
  predicted 3D structure (large). Color of the edges connecting the nodes represents
  the types of evidence supporting the connections: predicted gene neighborhood (green),
  predicted gene fusions (red), known interactions from experimental evidence (pink),
  co-expression (black), and text-mining (green). Disconnected nodes in the network
  are not displayed.'
