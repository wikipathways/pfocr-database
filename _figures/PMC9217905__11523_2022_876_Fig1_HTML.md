caption: Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway coordinates cell
  proliferation, differentiation and fate during both embryogenesis and in normal
  adult tissues. a In the absence of a Wnt signal, cytoplasmic β-catenin that is not
  involved in cell-cell adhesion interacts with a degradation complex comprising axin,
  APC, GSK3 and CK1. Here, the sequential phosphorylation of β-catenin by CK1 and
  GSK3 marks it for ubiquitylation and degradation. This constant degradation prevents
  β-catenin from entering the nucleus and promoting the transcription of Wnt target
  genes. b The binding of Wnt to its frizzled receptor and LRP co-receptor leads to
  the recruitment of dishevelled. Together, this complex recruits the degradation
  complex to the cell membrane where LRP becomes phosphorylated by GSK3 then CK1.
  Axin then binds to the phosphorylated LRP, resulting in the disassembly of the degradation
  complex. Consequently, the stabilisation of β-catenin allows it to accumulate and
  translocate into the nucleus. Here, it binds to the TCF/LEF promotor region to stimulate
  the transcription of Wnt target genes including CCND1 (cyclin D1), MYC, PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2),
  MMP7, VEGF and WISP1. With deregulated, constitutive activation, the resultant protein
  products may drive tumourigenesis by enhancing proliferation, angiogenesis and invasiveness
