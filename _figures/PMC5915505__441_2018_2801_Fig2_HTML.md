caption: HIF degradation pathway in normoxia and its stabilisation in hypoxia and
  pseudohypoxia. Under normoxic oxygen levels, PHD enzymes hydroxylate HIFα subunit
  on specific proline residues. These are recognised by VHL ubiquitin ligase which
  targets HIFα for proteasomal degradation (first panel). Under conditions of low
  oxygen levels, PHD enzymes are inhibited and HIFα protein is stabilised, binds HIFβ
  subunit and transactivates HIF responsive genes (middle panel). In pseudohypoxic
  conditions depicted here by SDH deficiency, high succinate levels restrict the PHD
  reaction by product inhibition and HIFα is stabilised under conditions of normoxic
  oxygen levels (last panel)
