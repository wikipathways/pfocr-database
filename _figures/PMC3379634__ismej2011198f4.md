caption: A functional overview of E. mutabilis main metabolic traits determined from
  proteomic and metabolomic data. For each metabolic pathway shown in the figure,
  examples of metabolites are indicated (blue). Enzymes involved in those metabolic
  pathways are represented by a red line when identified by the proteomic approach
  and a blue line otherwise. In the extracellular medium, only metabolites found in
  the water at the study site and shown to be secreted by E. mutabilis in vitro were
  represented. Those possibly used as nutrient by Thiomonas sp. and Ca. F. communificans
  according to our previous analysis are represented in green and in brown, respectively
  ().
