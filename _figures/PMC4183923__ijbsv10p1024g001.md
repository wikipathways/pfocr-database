caption: The major pathophysiological pathways in Huntington's disease (HD). Mutant
  huntingtin (mHtt) protein disrupts many normal physiological processes and leads
  to unbalanced homeostasis of apoptotic molecules, deficits in autophagy, axonal
  transport impairment, transcriptional dysregulation, reduced cellular neurotrophic
  support, mitochondrial abnormalities, and glutamate excitotoxicity. mHtt disturbs
  the balance between pro-apoptotic (such as Bax and p53) and cell survival (such
  as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) molecules. Transcriptional regulation is disrupted in HD; as
  described in the text, mHtt allows REST translocation to the nucleus resulting in
  repression of genes including BDNF. As a result of decreased BDNF axonal transport
  and repression of gene transcription by REST, neurotrophic support of cells is diminished
  in HD. Impaired axonal transport of autophagosomes also increases autophagy deficits
  observed in HD. Mitochondrial abnormalities in HD include decreased ATP production
  and PGC-1a expression, as well as increased cytochrome c release which leads to
  cell apoptosis. Glutamate excitotoxicity, caused by hyperactivation of excitatory
  amino acid receptors that increase cell ion permeability and lead to intracellular
  calcium overload and ultimately cell death, is strongly implicated in HD. The pointed
  arrows indicate that mHtt increases the described physiological pathway; arrows
  with blocked ends indicate prevention of a physiological event.
