caption: The putative effects of over-expressed CFL-1 on DNA repair. (A) Under normal
  condition, IR-induced DNA damage will trigger the activation of the ATM kinase,
  which phosphorylates H2AX encompassing DNA damage sites. 53BP1 will recognize γ-H2AX
  and recruit additional DNA repair molecules to fix the damaged DNA and lead to cell
  survival; and (B) Over-expression of wild type CFL-1 (phosphorylatable) may enter
  and locate around DNA. After IR, the ATM kinase remains to be activated, but cannot
  phosphorylate H2AX. Recruitment of 53BP1 to the γ-H2AX sites fails, so that the
  DNA repair capacity is impaired and results in cell death.
