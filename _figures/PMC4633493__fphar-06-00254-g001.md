caption: Mechanisms through which microRNAs (miRNAs) implicated in the TGF-β signaling
  pathway in the lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts. The majority of TGF-β is in
  a latent form and kept inactive by the latency-associated peptide (LAP) in the extracellular
  milieu. Upon release from LAP, TGF-β dimers then associate with the type II TGF-β
  receptor, that in turn associates with the type I receptor, leading to the activation
  of the receptor heterodimer and initiation of a variety of signaling pathways. Both
  Smad-mediated and non-Smad mediated pathways are involved, leading to activation
  of target genes involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), differentiation,
  proliferation, migration, pro-fibrotic activity and ECM. miRNA targeting components
  of TGF-β signaling are shown (Green color indicates enhancer, whereas red color
  indicates suppressor).
