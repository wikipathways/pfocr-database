caption: Central carbon metabolism and relevant metabolic pathways of P. freudenreichii
  subsp. shermanii discussed in this work. Pathways are colour-coded. Upregulation
  of the glycine cleavage pathway, TCA cycle (via the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase),
  the citramalate pathway or the PPP are all possible ways to source additional reduced
  cofactors for propionate generation, although the ATP generation through the glycine
  cleavage pathway makes this particularly attractive. Potential knock-out strategies
  target glycolysis or the acetate synthesis pathway. Non-native enzymes proposed
  in this work are depicted in black.
