caption: Schematic depicting the metabolic regulation of the mammalian Hippo signaling
  pathway. Energy stress as observed in settings of glucose withdrawal/starvation
  inhibits YAP activity via activation of AMPK leading to phosphorylation of AMOT,
  YAP, or disruption of the YAP/TEAD complex. Metabolic pathways including the mevalonate/HMD
  CoA reductase-GGPP pathway also influence YAP and TAZ activity via RHOA/RAC1. Activity
  of this pathway can also be limited by disruption of YAP-TEAD binding by PFK-1.
