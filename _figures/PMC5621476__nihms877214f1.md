caption: In the first step of L-carnitine biosynthesis, a lysine residue bound to
  some proteins is post-translationally methylated by a methyltransferase (enzyme
  1) to form a 6-N-trimethyllysine residue. The methyl groups are transferred from
  S-adenosylmethionine yielding S-adenosylhomocysteine and the methylated lysine.
  After lysosomal proteolytic release of the 6-N-trimethyllysine residue, 6-N-trimethyllysine
  is then metabolized by 6-N-trimethyllysine dioxygenase (enzyme 2) leading to the
  formation of the hydroxylated metabolite, 3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine. 3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine
  aldolase (enzyme 3) splits 3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine into glycine plus 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde,
  which is further dehydrogenated to 4-N-trimethylaminobutyrate (also known as γ-butyrobetaine)
  by 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (enzyme 4). The enzymes mentioned
  in these steps are ubiquitously expressed; therefore, γ-butyrobetaine can be produced
  in many tissues. The last step in carnitine synthesis is the hydroxylation of γ-butyrobetaine
  by γ-butyrobetaine dioxygenase (enzyme 5) forming 3-hydroxy-4-N-trimethylaminobutyrate
  (carnitine). The presence of γ-butyrobetaine dioxygenase is restricted to kidney,
  liver, and brain, therefore the complete pathway for endogenous carnitine biosynthesis
  only occurs in these tissues.
