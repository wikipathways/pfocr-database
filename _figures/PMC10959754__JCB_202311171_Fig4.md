caption: 'The role of ubiquitination in TNF signaling. TNF binding to TNFR1 triggers
  the formation of the TNFR complex I, which comprises TRAF2, TRADD, UBE2D, cIAP1/2,
  and RIPK1. Within TNFR complex I, RIPK1 undergoes ubiquitination with M1-, K11-,
  K48-, and K63-linked ubiquitin chains, including mixed and branched chains. This
  ubiquitination of RIPK1 serves to stabilize TNFR complex I and enables the transmission
  of downstream signaling through LUBAC-induced M1-linked ubiquitination of its constituents
  (HOIP, HOIL-1, and SHARPIN) and NEMO, resulting in the activation of the NF-κB (p65-p50)
  or MAPK signaling pathway to promote cell survival and proinflammatory gene expression.
  Extended TNF signaling triggers additional cytotoxic pathways: the apoptosis pathway
  mediated by the TNFR1 complex II, which includes RIPK1-FADD-Caspase8 and the necrosome-mediated
  pathway via the formation of the RIPK1–RIPK3–MLKL complex. Ubiquitinated substrates
  and free ester-linked branched chains catalyzed by LUBAC may play a central role
  in mediating inflammation and cell death signaling pathways'
