caption: Cellular and molecular mechanisms of retinoic acid (RA) in podocytes. The
  protective effects of RA on podocytes depend on the types of injury. RA can inhibit
  podocyte proliferation and differentiation in mice with human immunodeficiency virus
  (HIV)-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) through activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway
  and upregulation of Wilms’ tumor-1 (WT-1) and Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) expression.
  In mice with crescentic glomerulonephritis [nephrotoxic serum (NTS) nephritis] and
  focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), RA stimulates podocyte regeneration from
  parietal epithelial cells (PECs) via activation of retinoic acid receptor (RAR)α,
  and this protective effect is impaired by albuminuria. However, a high dose of RA
  may induce retinoic acid receptor responder protein 1 (RARRES1) expression, which
  can cause podocyte apoptosis, a potential side effect of RA. ADR, adriamycin; DKD,
  diabetic kidney disease.
