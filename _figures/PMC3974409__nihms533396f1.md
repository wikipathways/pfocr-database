caption: 'Pathways that mediate outer membrane (OM) biogenesis and maintain OM integrity.
  (A) LPS is a complex glycolipid that consists of three regions: lipid A, a core
  oligosaccharide and an O-antigen polysaccharide. (B) O-antigen is assembled through
  the Wzy-dependent pathway. The O-antigen repeat unit is assembled in the cytoplasm
  and flipped to the periplasmic face of the IM by Wzx; O-antigen is polymerized by
  Wzy and the chain length is modulated by Wzz. (C) LPS is biosynthesized in the cytoplasm,
  flipped to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane (IM) and transported through
  the periplasm to the outer leaflet of the OM via the Lpt pathway. Ligation to O-antigen
  depends on the particular strain background. (D) Mislocalized or misfolded OMPs
  and LPS loss or defects initiate the σE envelope stress response pathway. LPS loss
  or defects affect porin assembly; misassembled porin binds to DegS, degrading RseA
  and initiating the σE stress response. LPS signal could directly bind to RseB, subjecting
  RseA to proteolysis by DegS to activate the σE stress response.'
