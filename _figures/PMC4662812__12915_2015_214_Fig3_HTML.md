caption: Current model of iP and tZ biosynthesis and metabolic pathways in Arabidopsis.
  In Arabidopsis, IPT preferentially utilizes ATP and ADP, and CYP735A preferentially
  utilizes iPRMP and iPRDP, as substrates. LOG exclusively reacts with their monophosphate
  forms. Active cytokinins are degraded by CKX, glucosylated by UGT, or reverted to
  their precursors by the purine salvage pathway
