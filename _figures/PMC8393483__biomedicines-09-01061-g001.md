caption: 'Biogenesis of exosomes and cell-to-cell communication. (a) Exosome biogenesis
  starts with the inward budding of the plasma membrane and the participation of proteins,
  such as clathrin. Endocytosis results in the formation of an early endosome, which
  encapsulates cellular proteins and genetic material present in the cytoplasm, becoming
  a late endosome. Then, multivesicular bodies (MVBs) containing exosomes are formed.
  The generation of exosomes can occur by two main pathways: (1) a ESCRT-dependent
  pathway and (2) a ESCRT-independent pathway. MVBs can be directed to the lysosome
  for degradation and recycling of MVB components or to the plasma membrane, and exosomes
  are released into the extracellular space by Rab small GTPases or R-SNARE. (b) Secreted
  exosomes can be taken up by recipient cells through several mechanisms, including
  (1) receptor-ligand interaction, (2) exosomal internalization by endocytosis, phagocytosis
  or micropinocytosis and (3) direct membrane fusion.'
