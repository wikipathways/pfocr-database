caption: PKCι drives both common and lineage-specific oncogenic pathways in lung cancer.
  In KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma (KRAS-driven LADC) PKCι acts as a critical downstream
  KRAS effector, activating a novel PKCι-ELF3-NOTCH3 signaling axis that establishes
  and maintains a KRAS-driven LADC TIC phenotype. In lung squamous cell carcinoma
  (LSCC) harboring 3q26 amplification, the 3q26 genes PRKCI, SOX2, and ECT2 are coordinately
  amplified and overexpressed, leading to lineage-specific activation of a PKCι-SOX2-HHAT
  signaling axis. This pathway drives a Hedgehog-dependent LSCC tumor-initiating cell
  (TIC) phenotype characterized by highly aggressive tumorigenic and invasive behavior
  and enhanced survival and chemoresistance. The PKCι gene target GLI1 is a major
  effector of this pathway. PKCι also activates a PKCι-ECT2-RAC1-MEK-ERK signaling
  pathway that drives transformed growth and invasion of both KRAS LADC and LSCC cells.
  The PKCι target matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP10) is a major effector of this
  pathway. The PKCι inhibitor auranofin exhibits antitumor activity against both LSCC
  and KRAS-driven LADC, and exhibits lineage-specific synergistic activity when combined
  with a NOTCH inhibitor in KRAS-driven LADC and a SMO inhibitor in LSCC.
