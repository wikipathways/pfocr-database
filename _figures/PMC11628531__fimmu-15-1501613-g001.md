caption: LAG-3 signaling pathway and its ligands in tumor immunity. LAG-3 is expressed
  on T cells and interacts with a variety of ligands to inhibit T cell activity and
  promote immune exhaustion. These ligands include MHC-II on antigen-presenting cells
  (APCs), FGL1 on cancer cells, LSECtin on hepatocytes, Galectin-3 on monocytes, and
  the recently identified TCR-CD3 complex. As shown, MHC-II binds to the extra loop
  of the D1 domain of LAG-3, whereas FGL1 binds to other part of D1. A large number
  of glycosylation sites is present on LAG-3, which is also the binding site of LSECtin
  and Galectin-3. Notably, the effect of LAG-3 on the TCR-CD3 complex is indirect,
  in which the KIEELE motif plays a key role in regulating TCR-CD3 function. In addition,
  LAG-3 can be hydrolyzed by ADAM10/17 to produce soluble LAG-3 (sLAG-3), which further
  regulates immune responses
