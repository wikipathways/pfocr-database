caption: eCIRP in sepsis. eCIPR is released from injured or dead cells as a DAMP to
  initiate an immune response. The binding of eCIRP to TLR4-MD2 and TREM-1 activates
  NF-κB signaling pathway for proinflammatory response, including the production of
  proinflammatory cytokines and formation of NETs. The interaction of eCIRP with IL-6R
  results in STAT3 phosphorylation and promotes transcription of immunosuppressive
  genes for immune tolerance and suppression. eCIRP, extracellular cold-inducible
  RNA-binding protein; IL-6R, interleukin 6 receptor; MD2, myeloid differentiation
  factor 2; NET, neutrophil extracellular trap; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; STAT3, signal transducer and activators of transcription 3.
