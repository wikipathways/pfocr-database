caption: β-Catenin participates in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and is a transcriptional
  coactivator in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In epithelial cells, the best-characterized
  adherens junctions are formed around the single-pass transmembrane protein E-cadherin
  (E-cad). The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin provides a scaffold for a multiprotein
  complex that includes p120-catenin (p120) and β-catenin (β-cat) and links extracellular
  adhesion sites to the actin cytoskeleton through α-catenin (α-cat). The intracellular
  portion of the complex can be liberated through proteolytic cleavage of adherens
  junctions, although the functional role of this cytosolic complex is unclear. Free
  cytosolic β-catenin is also regulated by a destruction complex associated with the
  canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The destruction complex comprises the scaffold
  proteins axin and APC, the serine-threonine kinases CK1 and GSK3β, a Dishevelled
  segment polarity protein (Dvl), and the β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP),
  which collectively bind, phosphorylate, and ubiquitinate β-catenin. The posttranslationally
  modified β-catenin is then shuttled to the proteasome for degradation. In the presence
  of a Wnt ligand, the destruction complex is disassembled by interacting with the
  Wnt receptor complex of Frizzled and an LRP protein. Disassembly of the destruction
  complex enables newly synthesized β-catenin to accumulate within the cytosol, translocate
  to the nucleus, and promote transcriptional coactivation of β-catenin target genes
  in conjunction with lymphocyte enhancer binding factors (LEF) and T-cell factor
  (TCF) transcription factors.
