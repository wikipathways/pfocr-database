caption: Schematic diagram of Flii involvement in inflammation. Flii is secreted in
  response to injury/LPS stimulation and current in vitro studies suggest that Flii
  can dampen TLR inflammatory pathway both extracellularily and intracellularily resulting
  in decreased TLR signalling, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. The effects
  of Flii as a mediator of inflammation in the context of EBA have yet to be investigated.
  Red arrow pointing down means decreased, and red cross means inhibited.
