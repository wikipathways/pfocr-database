caption: Proposed model for BR-regulated anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis
  mediated by the interaction between MdJa2 and MdBZR1. When plants are treated with
  BR, MdJa2 accumulates and most MdBZR1 proteins exist in a dephosphorylated active
  state, which considerably increases the possibility that MdBZR1 and MdJa2 will form
  a complex. This complex inhibits anthocyanin and PA synthesis by modulating the
  transcriptions of downstream target genes. P indicates phosphorylation modification,
  CArG-motif indicates binding element, vertical line indicates inhibition, and bold
  vertical line indicates enhanced inhibition.
