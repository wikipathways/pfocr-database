caption: Structure of BMP Pathway Components. Comparison of the structures of different
  components used in endothelial cell BMP signaling, highlighting important functional
  domains. A BMP ligand monomers have a pro-domain and a mature domain. Ligands often
  pair to make homodimers, although heterodimers have been reported. B Type I receptors
  share a ligand-binding domain with a hydrophobic residue on ALK2, 3, and 6, but
  not ALK1. They are phosphorylated by Type II receptors on their GS domain. Their
  active site is in the Ser–Thr kinase domain on the C-terminal end of the protein.
  This domain also contains the L45 loop that binds the R-SMAD L3 loop. C Type II
  receptors have a similar structure to Type I receptors but lack the GS domain and
  some contain a long C-terminal tail important for non-canonical signaling. D BMP
  Co-Receptor endoglin (ENG) dimerizes through a disulfide bridge in its ZP domain
  and binds ligands in the Orphan Domain 1. Betaglycan (BG) is a monomer that wraps
  around its ligand with both Orphan Domains and the N-terminal region of its ZP domain.
  Both co-receptors have short transmembrane domains with no signaling functionality.
  E–G All SMADs contain an MH2 domain with an L3 loop capable of binding the L45 loop
  on Type I receptors, connected to an MH1 domain (or MH1-like domain in i-SMADs)
  by a linker region. R-SMADs maintain an inactive, folded conformation until they
  are phosphorylated on the SSXS motif within their MH2 domain by Type I receptors
