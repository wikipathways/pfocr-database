caption: 'Activation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway
  leading to a smooth muscle cell contractile phenotype. Members of the TGF-β superfamily
  that include TGF-βs, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and growth and differentiation
  factors (GDFs) have similar functional properties regulating cell growth, differentiation,
  apoptosis, and extracellular matrix synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs).
  TGF-β ligands are synthesized as latent precursor molecules (LTGF-β), which are
  activated via proteolytic cleavage. Active TGF-β signaling is transmitted through
  two types of transmembrane serine/threonine protein kinase receptors: TGF-β type
  I (TGFβRI) and principally type II (TGFβRII) and mediated by a sequence of phosphorylated
  Smad proteins. In addition to the canonical Smad signaling pathway that directly
  regulates the transcription of Smad-dependent target genes, TGF-β function can also
  be mediated by Smad-independent pathways including MAPK signaling pathways, such
  as p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway,
  and Wnt signaling. TGF-β signaling via TGFβRII plays a pivotal role in both second
  heart field and cardiac neural crest derived SMC phenotype differentiation during
  vascular development as well as SMC phenotypic switching in disease states. TGF-β
  signaling induces SMCs to change shape into elongated SMC shape accompanied by an
  up-regulation of SMC contractile proteins.'
