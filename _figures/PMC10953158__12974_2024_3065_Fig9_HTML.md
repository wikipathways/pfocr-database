caption: Schematic illustration of NHE-1-mediated pHi and signaling regulation in
  microglial cells and communication with oligodendrocytes in ischemic white matter
  repair. Using single cell RNAseq, we discovered that selective deletion of microglial
  Nhe1 acidified microglia and activated CREB signaling with increased BDNF secretion,
  and elevated SPP1 signaling pathway, which enhanced the restorative microglia-oligodendrocyte
  interactions in support of white matter remyelination. Our findings identified a
  novel group of stroke-associated white matter microglia, which can be activated
  by acidifying microglial pHi through blocking the NHE1 protein. Regulating microglial
  pHi presents a possible mechanism in promoting the beneficial microglia-oligodendrocyte
  interactions in improving white matter myelination after ischemic stroke
