caption: Under standard conditions CDK4/6, directed by upstream signaling, phosphorylates
  RB1 promoting E2F transcription and cell cycle progression from G1 to S. CDK4/6
  inhibitors block this pathway, causing cells to stall at G1. This blockage in the
  cell cycle reduces uptake of thymidine and therefore of [18F]FLT
