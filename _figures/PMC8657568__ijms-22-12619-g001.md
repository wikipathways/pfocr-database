caption: Dehydrin gene expression regulatory network model. Abiotic stressors such
  as drought, high salinity, and cold trigger dehydrin expression in plants depending
  on various signaling pathways. Drought and high salinity activate the ABA and calcium
  signaling pathways. After ABA binds its corresponding receptor, it acts on bZIP
  TFs and mediates dehydrin expression. Calcium ions are decoded by proteins such
  as CaMs, CDPKs, CBLs, and CMLs and regulate dehydrin expression via CBF TFs. They
  also act as bridges connecting drought/salinity and cold stress responses. ICE1
  protein occurs in the early cold stress pathway. The CBFs in this pathway regulate
  the expression of multiple downstream CORs. The MAPK cascade also occurs throughout
  the entire regulatory network and regulates dehydrin expression upstream. Arrows
  and bars indicate positive and negative regulation, respectively.
