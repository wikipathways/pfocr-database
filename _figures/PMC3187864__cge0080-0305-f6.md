caption: Axon viability depends on coordinated endocytic trafficking and signaling.
  Nerve growth factor (NGF) binds to the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase and stimulates
  phosphorylation and internalization. Endocytosed TrkA is transported from Rab5-positive
  early endosomes to Rab7-positive late endosomes. In peripheral neurons long distance
  transport of late endosomes to the cell body is critical for growth factor degradation
  and proper nuclear signaling to maintain cell viability and differentiation. Transport
  occurs on microtubules through Rab7, the Rab interacting lysosomal protein (RILP)
  effector and dynactin minus-end directed motor complex. Return transport to the
  synapse is mediated by Rab7 in conjunction with a plus-end directed kinesin motor,
  likely KIF3a. Inset illustrates endosomal membrane protein complexes involved in
  Rab conversion that allows transfer of cargo along the degradative pathway. Several
  conserved multimeric protein complexes first identified in yeast are thought to
  aid in Rab conversion, directed transport and fusion (RETROMER endosome to Golgi;
  CORVET early to late endosome; HOPS late endosome to lysosome).
