caption: 'Scheme for down-regulation of MEP pathway in Arabidopsis by insect herbivory.
  Herbivory decreases photosynthesis and triggers an increase in ROS accumulation.
  Among ROS, 1O2 then converts β-carotene to the oxidation product βCC. In turn, βCC
  inhibits DXS, the rate-controlling enzyme of the MEP pathway. In previous work,
  the end products of the pathway, IDP and DMADP, have also been shown to inhibit
  DXS activity (). In addition to down-regulating the MEP pathway, which is involved
  in growth and development, βCC also triggers increased defense against herbivores.
  Moreover, the ROS induced by herbivory also induces another defense response via
  the MEP pathway. ROS stimulate a build-up of the intermediate MEcDP due to inhibition
  of the ROS-sensitive enzyme immediately following. The accumulated MEcDP is then
  transported out of the chloroplast and into the nucleus where it has been shown
  to stimulate the expression of defense genes (). Black solid arrows indicate metabolic
  conversions. Blue dashed lines indicate regulatory effects, positive with an arrowhead
  and negative with an inhibition bar. Intermediates: DMADP, dimethylallyl diphosphate;
  DXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; GAP, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; HMBDP, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl
  4-diphosphate; IDP, isopentenyl diphosphate; MEcDP, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate;
  and Pyr, pyruvate. Enzymes: DXS, DXP synthase; HDR, HMBDP reductase; HDS, HMBDP
  synthase; and MDS, MEcDP synthase.'
