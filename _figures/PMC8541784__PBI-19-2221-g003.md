caption: The general phenylpropanoid and monolignol‐specific pathways, with the changes
  in phenolic metabolism indicated for cse1 cse2 xylem and/or bark extracts compared
  with WT. Red and blue names indicate metabolites that are up or down, respectively,
  in cse1 cse2 xylem and/or bark extracts as compared to WT. Characterized metabolites
  uniquely detected in bark or xylem profiles are indicated with a (b) or (x), respectively.
  Co‐occurring metabolites are indicated by (x, b). Metabolites that are framed in
  a box belong to the same class. The flow through the pathway towards the conventional
  monolignols is in black in WT, whereas (putative) alternative flows are in grey.
  Successive arrows show two or more metabolic steps. Solid arrows show enzymatic
  conversions that are validated by experimental evidence, whereas dashed arrows show
  suggested conversions (Saleme et al., ; Van Acker et al., ). *The catalytic activity
  of CSE1 and CSE2 is suggested in planta and proven in vitro in this work. Each metabolite
  is indicated with a unique number, corresponding to the metabolites mentioned in
  the manuscript and Tables  and  and Tables . Their structures are given in Figure .
