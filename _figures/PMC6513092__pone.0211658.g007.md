caption: Overexpression of PIN1 induces the expression of PTOV1, which suggest that
  PIN1 might be the upstream protein which regulates the expression of PTOV1. Both
  the gene cooperatively share MAPK pathway including the expression of ERK, C-Jun
  and the master regulator C-Myc as well as induces the expression of apoptosis and
  autophagy related genes. PTOV1 interacts with RACK1 which is involved for protein
  synthesis in cancer similarly knockdown of PIN1 also inhibits RACK1 and thus PIN1
  might contribute to oncogenic signalling via PTOV1-RACK1 interaction.

  in MDA-MB-231 cells.
