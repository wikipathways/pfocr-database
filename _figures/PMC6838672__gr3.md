caption: 'Probing Kinase Activation in Patient-Derived Samples(A) Reorganization of
  kinase activities upon acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma: matched melanoma
  cell lines were established from patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from the same
  patient before and after acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor PLX-4720, giving
  rise to a model system comprising treatment naive, treatment sensitive, and treatment
  resistant cell lines.(B) Pairwise comparison of kinase activation between the 3
  conditions is depicted as volcano plot using an arbitrary significance cutoff (p <
  0.05).(C) Molecular function of ERK4, which is part of a highly confined molecular
  system, together with ERK3 and MK5. Bar plots show the detected abundance of the
  T-loop phosphorylations for ERK3, ERK4, and MK5 (normalized to values observed in
  naive cells, error bars depicting standard deviation, ∗p ≤ 0.05; ∗∗p ≤ 0.01; ∗∗∗p
  ≤ 0.001).(D) Determining kinase activation states in a breast cancer needle biopsy:
  proteins were extracted from half a needle biopsy (<5 mg of tissue), followed by
  tryptic digest, phosphopeptide enrichment by Fe(III)-IMAC, and global kinase activation
  screening by nanoLC-SRM.(E) The detected kinases span a dynamic range of more than
  3 orders of magnitude, as estimated by their intensity ratio to the heavy-isotope-labeled
  standard peptide (assuming roughly equimolar internal standard concentration).(F)
  Selected kinases detected in their activated state are shown in the context of their
  molecular signaling pathway according to the Kegg database (outlined in bold green).'
