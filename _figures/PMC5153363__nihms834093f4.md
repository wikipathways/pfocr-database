caption: a | The illustration on the left is of a crayfish species, Procambarus clarkii.
  The crayfish escapes from potential threats by producing a rapid tail-flip response.
  Mechanoreceptors lining its abdomen detect events in the water column and elicit
  the escape behaviour. Corollary discharge (CD) signals of movement commands protect
  the afferents to the mechanosensory escape system from maladaptive activation and
  desensitization. The schematic on the right depicts the circuitry that is involved
  in producing the crayfish’s tail-flip response. Mechanical information enters the
  system through sensory afferents (SAs) and reaches the lateral giants (LGs) by way
  of sensory interneurons (SIs). The LGs communicate with segmental giants (SGs) and
  movement generators (MoGs) that activate flexor muscles in the abdomen. CD interneurons
  (CDIs) are activated by the SGs and convey signals to primary afferent depolarization
  interneurons (PADIs) that inhibit the SAs. This transient inhibition briefly silences
  the mechanosensory pathway and prevents tail-flip-induced reafference from generating
  further tail flips. Part c shows a circuit that represents an example of CD signals
  that originate from a lower motor cortical area and target sensory neurons at an
  early stage of the processing stream. b | The illustration on the left is of a cricket
  species, Gryllus bimaculatus. Crickets communicate with one another by chirping.
  Chirps are generated by rubbing their forewings together, a process that is known
  as stridulation. CDs of the wingbeats phasically inhibit components of the auditory
  system and prevent saturation and desensitization. The schematic of the cricket
  thorax on the right depicts how CD coordinates the ‘song’ and auditory systems.
  The activity of the central pattern generator (CPG) drives the wing motor neurons
  (MNs) that produce song (musical notes). Signals are routed concurrently from the
  CPGs to the CDIs. Collaterals of the CDIs synapse on to the axon terminals of auditory
  primary afferents and on to the cell bodies of auditory interneurons (ANs) in the
  prothorax. CPG-induced CDI activity rhythmically imposes and lifts an inhibitory
  gate on the auditory systems and restricts auditory traffic from the tympanum. Part
  c shows how, for the system in part b, the point of contact between the motor and
  sensory systems is at the lower levels of the idealized sensorimotor circuit.
