caption: Conserved and novel homologues of bilaterian genes involved in axis patterning
  and regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in Hydra. a Stacked bar plot
  depicts shared homologues of planaria and Xenopus that are differentially regulated
  by the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in Hydra. b Predicted gene regulatory network
  of dorsoventral patterning genes based on differentially expressed gene under wnt
  activation condition. Genes highlighted in red colour are upregulated and genes
  highlighted in blue are downregulated; dotted line, β-catenin-dependent or -independent
  regulation. c Transcription factor targets of Wnt/β-catenin signalling identified
  in Hydra. TFs highlighted in red are also observed as part of the Spemann’s organizer
  signature.
