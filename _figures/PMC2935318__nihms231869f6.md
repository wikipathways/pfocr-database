caption: The established pathway of Rho signaling is through ROCK and LIM Kinase to
  inactivate cofilin, an actin-severing protein. This results in an overall increase
  in F-actin, which through a series of unknown events leads to changes in matrix
  gene expression. Based on the observations in this manuscript we present a revised
  model in which ROCK directly phosphorylates Sox9Ser181, causing increased nuclear
  localization and enhanced matrix gene expression. Thus, while actin remodeling also
  occurs upon stimulation of the revised pathway, this is a parallel event to the
  direct activation of Sox9 by ROCK.
