caption: The KRAS/TGF-β/p15Ink4b pathway controls the cell fate. Although oncogenic
  KRAS activates the proliferative signals, it also stimulates the TGF-β expression
  through MEK-EGR1 cascade. TGF-β further activates Cdkn2b expression via Smads component
  of TGF-β pathway. The p15Ink4b encoded by Cdkn2b gene together with p16Ink4a encoded
  by Cdkfn2a inhibit the Rb phosphorylation and activate Rb to induce cellular senescence
  and prevent tumor formation. However, when both Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b are inactivated,
  Rb is phosphorylated by CDK4/6 and make the cells encompass cellular senescence,
  which allow tumor formation.
papertitle: CDKN2B deletion is essential for pancreatic cancer development instead
  of unmeaningful co-deletion due to juxtaposition to CDKN2A.
