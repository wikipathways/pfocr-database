caption: Speculative Scenario of NNK-activated β-adrenergic Signaling Suppressed by
  Apigenin NNK binds to the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) that subsequently activates
  focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src to elicit the activation of the mitogenic activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. MAPK pathway involves activation of Ras/Raf/MEK resulting
  in the activation of ERK. Both the synthetic drug propranolol and the phytochemical
  apigenin appears to inhibit NNK activation of β-AR at the receptor level.
