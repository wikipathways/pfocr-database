caption: Roles of NLRC3 on T cells. (A) NLRC3 affects the differentiation direction
  of naïve T cells. NLRC3 prevents the production and release of IL-6, IL-23 and IL-12
  in dendritic cells and naïve T cells, in DCs, NLRC3 executes regulatory roles by
  affecting P38 signal pathway. IL-12 promotes the differentiation of naïve T cells
  into Th1 cell, and IL-23, IL-6 promote the differentiation of naïve T cells into
  Th17 cell. (B, C) The potential several manners of NLRC3 affects the activation,
  proliferation and differentiation of T cells. (B) Sufficient energy is critical
  for the activation, proliferation and activation of naïve T cells, NLRC3 regulates
  the activation, proliferation and differentiation through negatively regulating
  mitochondrial function and the production of energy in naïve T cells (C) NLRC3 inhibits
  the activation of both NF-κB and MEK/ERK signal pathways and further inhibit the
  activation, proliferation and differentiation of T cells.
