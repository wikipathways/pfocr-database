caption: Model of HIV-associated disruption of tight junctions in initial HIV entry
  and systemic HIV/AIDS disease. (Upper panel) Tight junctions are formed between
  epithelial cells of oral, genital and intestinal mucosa by lateral interaction of
  integral membrane proteins occludin and claudins, which are associated with the
  cytoplasmic proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3. These proteins themselves link occludin
  and claudins to the actin cytoskeleton. Junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAM-1) is
  also localized at the tight junctions of mucosal epithelia. (Lower left panel) HIV-associated
  disruption of mucosal epithelium may occur upon initial infection of HIV and during
  systemic HIV/AIDS disease. Initial HIV gp120 interaction with mucosal epithelia
  is facilitated by binding of viral gp120 to one or more HIV coreceptors (GalCer,
  CCR5 and/or CXCR4), as well as to HSPG, TLR2 and TLR4. Such interaction activates
  MAPK, PI3K and/or TLR signaling, leading to upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines,
  including TNF-α, which induce the activation of MLCK and MLC phosphorylation and
  actin cytoskeletal contraction. These events induce mislocalization of ZO-1 from
  junctional areas and internalization of occludin and claudins 1, 3 and 4 from assembled
  junctions. An increase in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines may activate
  the apoptotic pathway in epithelial cells, leading to MMP- and/or caspase-mediated
  degradation of junctional proteins. Disruption of epithelial tight junctions facilitates
  opening of the paracellular space between epithelial cells and paracellular penetration
  by HIV. During HIV/AIDS disease, HIV-infected subepithelial CD4+ lymphocytes, LC/DC
  and macrophages migrate into the mucosal epithelium and release virions and envelope
  protein gp120, which disrupt epithelial junctions. In addition, HIV-infected cells
  secrete the viral transactivator protein tat, which also contributes to the disruption
  of tight junctions. (Lower right panel) HIV tat binds to integrins and induces MAPK
  activation, which downregulates expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1, occludin,
  and claudins 1, 3 and 4. The lack of expression of tight junction proteins leads
  to a lack or incomplete formation of tight junctions.
