caption: Putative functions of the differentially expressed proteins in metabolic
  processes of rice grain development at high temperatures. Proteins of known function
  are shown in red text. Up-regulated proteins are marked with ↑, and the down-regulated
  proteins are marked with ↓. Cal, Calvin cycle; EMP, glycolytic pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; ADPase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (OsDP3); UDPase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase
  (OsDP5); GBSS, granule-bound starch synthase (OsDP8); SDE, starch debranching enzyme
  (OsDP6); GDI, putative GDP dissociation inhibitor (OsUP19); GAPDH, d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (OsUP5); GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; G-6-P (G6P), glucose 6 phosphate;
  UDPG, uridine diphosphoglucose; Pyr, pyruvate; Ac-CoA, acetyl-CoA; Suc Acid, succinic
  acid; Suc CoA, succinic-CoA; TIM, triose phosphate enzyme; 1,3-BGP, 1,3-diphosphoglyceric
  acid; Glu, glutamate. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)
