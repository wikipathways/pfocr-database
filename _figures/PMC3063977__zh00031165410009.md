caption: Working model of the GCK-3 signaling pathway that functions to regulate CLH-3b
  activity. GCK-3 binds to CLH-3b via a canonical Ste20 binding motif and mediates
  phosphorylation of 2 downstream serine residues. Phosphorylation inhibits CLH-3b
  activity, and GCK-3 must bind to the channel's cytoplasmic COOH terminus in order
  for phosphorylation to occur (, ). We postulate that the ERK kinase MPK-1 functions
  to directly or indirectly activate GCK-3. MEK-2 is a MAP kinase kinase that phosphorylates
  and activates MPK-1 (). Cell shrinkage activates the pathway via unknown sensors
  and upstream signaling components. U-0126 inhibits active and inactive MEK-2 (,
  ) and, thereby, causes constitutive CLH-3b activation under basal conditions ().
  PD-098095 has been reported to prevent activation of MEK kinases (, ) and has no
  effect on basal CLH-3b activity but prevents cell shrinkage-induced channel inhibition
  (). In the C. elegans oocyte, major sperm protein released from sperm induces meiotic
  maturation via activation of a MEK-2/MPK-1 signaling cascade (). However, as maturation
  proceeds, activated MPK-1 levels fall rapidly and dramatically (). We postulate
  that falling MPK-1 levels result in GCK-3 inactivation, leading to dephosphorylation
  of CLH-3b via the type I phosphatases GSP-1 and GSP-2 (). Subsequent channel activation
  functions to regulate the timing of sheath cell contractions that mediate ovulation
  ().
