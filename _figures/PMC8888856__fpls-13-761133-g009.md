caption: Hypothetical model for P. pyrifolia in response to the infection of two pathogenetic
  C. fructicola strains and the crosstalk between hormone signaling and transcription
  factors (TFs) that are involved in leaf senescence. (A,B) Proposed models for P.
  pyrifolia in response to the infection of strain PAFQ32 and PAFQ31, respectively.
  In panel (A), (1) After infection by strain PAFQ32, pear plants sense fungal pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) (exemplified by chitin) with host pattern recognition
  receptors, and produce a variety of defense responses including activation of the
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and plant hormones signal transduction
  pathway, change of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS); (2) The fungus further secrets multiple effectors to target
  host proteins and suppress pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)-triggered
  immunity (PTI); (3) The plants synthesize resistance (R) proteins to recognize effector
  activity that triggered strong effector-triggered immune responses; (4) SA may act
  a pivotal role in the process of PTI or effector-triggered immunity (ETI) activation.
  In panel (B), (1) strain PAFQ31 grows under the cuticle within the cell wall around
  the epidermis and shortly form thin secondary hyphae to destruct the colonized host
  tissues; (2) The plants active PTI or ETI, and JA, ET, and ABA signaling pathways.
  (C) Effects of specific phytohormones and TFs on leaf senescence. After PAFQ31 infection,
  pear plants activated JA, ET, ABA, and SA signaling pathways, which may induce the
  upregulated expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and chlorophyll catabolic
  genes, and finally result in defoliation of the diseased leaves. Phytohormone, protein
  and TFs marked in red indicated that the expression of related genes were upregulated
  in this study. Solid lines represent well-defined biological processes, and dotted
  lines represent the information reported in the studies of Arabidopsis thaliana
  as a reference ().
