caption: Model of NDV V protein regulating apoptosis in DF-1 cells. When NDV invaded
  the DF-1 cells, the virus replicated and translated a number of V proteins. V protein
  inhibits the activation of Bax and activates Bcl-2, thereby inhibiting apoptosis.
  TXNL1 inhibits the activation of Bcl-2 and activates the Bax-Caspase-3 pathway,
  thereby promoting cell apoptosis. At the same time, the V protein inhibits the expression
  of TXNL1. In this process, apoptosis inhibits the replication of NDV.
