caption: Proposed mechanism underlying TRIM32 in enhancing neuronal ferroptosis after
  SCI. TRIM32 promotes K63-linked ubiquitination of GPX4 at K107, thereby enhancing
  p62-GPX4 interaction and leading to p62-dependent selective autophagic degradation
  of GPX4. ROS-ATM-Chk2 signaling pathway phosphorylates TRIM32 at S55, leading to
  GPX4 degradation and subsequent neuronal ferroptosis after SCI, suggesting a positive
  feedback loop between ROS and TRIM32. In the absence of TRIM32, GPX4 protein is
  stabilized and neuronal ferroptosis is inhibited, leading to better locomotor functional
  recovery after SCI
