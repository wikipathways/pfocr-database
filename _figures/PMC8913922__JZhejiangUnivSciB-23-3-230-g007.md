caption: ' Benzaldehyde and its derivatives and a schematic diagram, which illustrates
  the feasible signaling mechanisms of benzaldehydes 1 and 2 to reduce the LPS-induced
  inflammation in cells. Benzaldehydes 1 and 2 could inhibit the release of NO and
  ROS, and block the protein expression of IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 and phosphorylation
  levels of ERK, JNK and p38. LPS: lipopolysaccharide; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
  JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-related kinase; NF-‍κB:
  nuclear factor-κB; iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2;
  NO: nitric oxide; IL-6: interleukin-6.'
