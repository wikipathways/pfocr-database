caption: Proposed mechanisms of aspirin, the single nucleotide polymorphism rs6983267,
  and their interaction on the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway. A) Aspirin dampens CTNNB1 signaling
  through inhibition of PTGS (COX)–mediated synthesis of PGE2. PGE2 stimulates the
  CTNNB1 pathway through EP2 receptors, coupling the heterotrimeric G proteins of
  the Gs family and inhibiting the CTNNB1 destruction complex. This leads to release
  of GSK-3β from the complex, thereby blocking phosphorylation and destruction of
  CTNNB1. Subsequently, CTNNB1 accumulates in the cytoplasm, eventually translocating
  into the nucleus and complexing with the TCF/LEF family transcription factor TCF7L2,
  thereby promoting expression of target oncogenes, including MYC and CCND1, which
  promote colorectal tumorigenesis. B) Through COX-independent pathways, aspirin also
  inhibits CTNNB1 signaling by directly inducing phosphorylation and subsequent degradation
  of CTNNB1. C) The T allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs6983267 impairs
  binding of CTNNB1/TCF7L2, downregulating expression of MYC, the oncogene most proximate
  to rs6983267. Aspirin lowers level of CTNNB1 (A and B), further impairing binding
  of CTNNB1/TCF7L2. D) In contrast, the G allele of rs6983267 leads to constitutively
  active binding of CTNNB1/TCF7L2 and expression of MYC, promoting carcinogenesis.
  Thus, among individuals with only G allele, binding of CTNNB1/TCF7L2 is less sensitive
  to nuclear CTNNB1 levels, resulting in relative resistance to the effect of aspirin
  on inhibition of CTNNB1 accumulation.
