caption: 5-LOX pathway. ARA C20:4n-6 is converted to 5-HpETE with 5-LOX. This enzyme
  also catalyzes the next step in leukotriene biosynthesis. It converts 5-HpETE into
  LTA4, which can then be converted into LTB4 with LTA4H, into LTC4 with LTC4S, or
  into 5-oxo-ETE. 5-HpETE can also be converted to 5-oxo-ETE. LTC4 can be converted
  to other cysteinyl leukotrienes. LTC4 can be converted to LTF4 with the involvement
  of carboxypeptidase A or to LTD4 with the involvement of GGT1 and GGT5. Subsequently,
  LTD4 can be converted into LTE4 with the participation of DPEP1 and DPEP2, and then
  converted into LTF4 with γ-glutamyltranspeptidase. ↑—higher expression of given
  enzymes in GBM tumor relative to healthy tissue.
