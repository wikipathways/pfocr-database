caption: Representative diagram of miRNAs acting as oncogenes and their correlation
  with signaling pathways in renal cancer. The picture mainly demonstrates that miR-224/193a-3p
  and miR-501-5p improve PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling pathway through increasing the
  level of PI3K, AKT, and p-mTOR, respectively. On the contrary, miR-19, miR-122,
  and miR-92b-3p inhibit the expression of PTEN, and FOXO3 and TSC1 exert the same
  effect. miR-21 and miR-223-3p facilitate the VEGF and RAS/MAPK signaling pathway
  by augmenting the levels of VEGFA/c-jun and KRAS, respectively. Moreover, miR-125b
  and miR-543 increase the Wnt signaling pathway by decreasing the expression of DKK3
  and DDK1, respectively. miR-452-5p activates the TGF-β signaling pathway by decreasing
  the expression of SMAD4. In addition, miR-146a-5p and miR-146b-5p target G6PD and
  TARL6, and thus are involved in PPP metabolism and inflammation mechanism, respectively.
  PI3k – phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; p-AKT – p-protein kinase B; mTOR – mammalian
  target of rapamycin; PTEN – phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
  10; FOXO3 – forkhead box O3; TSC1 – tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 1; VEGFA
  – vascular endothelial growth factor A; KRAS – Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene;
  DKK1/3 – Dickkopf1/3; SMAD4 – SMAD family member 4; G6PD – glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  TRAF6 – TNF receptor associated factor 6.
