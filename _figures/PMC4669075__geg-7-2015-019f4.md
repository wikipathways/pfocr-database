caption: The model for CD44 action in logarithmic (growth-promoting mode) and confluent
  (growth-inhibitory mode) growth conditions. Specific ligands determine two functional
  states of CD44 that influence the cytoplasmic complexes. The ligands of the growth
  mode have not been defined for CD44. It is, however, known that CD44s, and particularly
  the larger splice variants CD44v, serve as a platform for the activation of growth
  factors (GF). GFR, growth factor receptor; PPi, inactive protein phosphatase; PPa,
  active protein phosphatase; ERM, ezrin, radixin, and moesin. Merlin (NF2), which
  is an inhibitor for the Ras–Raf–Mek–Erk pathway, is inactivated by phosphorylation
  in the growth-promoting mode for CD44.
