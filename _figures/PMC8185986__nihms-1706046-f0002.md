caption: Mϕ-derived chemokine MIP-2 binding to CXCR2 induces PMN migration as well
  as GRK2 and GRK5 expression through PI3Kγ signaling. Increased GRK2 and GRK5 expression
  results in chemokine receptor internalization and desensitization, thereby negatively
  regulating PMN migration. Thus, PI3Kγ-activated signaling is postulated to be a
  feedback mechanism regulating PMN migration. LPS acting through the TLR4 signaling
  pathway transcriptionally downregulates expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in response
  to MIP-2. This decreases chemokine receptor desensitization by preventing CXCR2
  internalization and thus augments PMN migration. MEK kinase is involved in mediating
  the cross-talk between TLR4 and chemokine receptors. (Dashed lines show inhibitory
  signals).
