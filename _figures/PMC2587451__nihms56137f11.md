caption: Even simple diketone derivatives 24a-e presented a number of hurdles to cyclization,
  partly because of the presence of the very sensitive formyl group (). Formylpyrroles
  as a class are generally unstable to acids, a property that was especially pronounced
  with 24a-e. These substrates underwent rapid decomposition with even weakly acidic
  ammonium salts. In contrast, basic or neutral sources of ammonia cleanly afforded
  mixtures of hemiaminal intermediates 26, but these species were resistant to dehydration
  and easily reverted to diketones 24. Working with substrate 24b (R = Me) we eventually
  found that the combination of (NH4)2CO3/basic Al2O3 in CH3CN at 75 °C gave ~75%
  yields of the corresponding dihydrodipyrrin 13b, a significant improvement over
  Method B (cf. ). In analogous fashion diketone 24d (R = n-pentyl) afforded 13d in
  much improved yield (77%). However, the relatively unhindered substrate 24c (R =
  H) required special care. This material was susceptible to competing aldol condensation,
  and upon aminolysis at 75 °C gave predominantly the aldol product 27c (51%) along
  with only 18% of dihydrodipyrrin 13c. After further experimentation we found that
  the aldol pathway was greatly reduced by effecting aminolysis at RT for 24 hrs before
  briefly heating to 75°C, affording 13c in 58% yield along with 17% of 27c. However,
  13c was still best prepared using conditions i (cf. ). Finally, we were surprised
  to find that the meso-Ph diketone 24a underwent significant decomposition upon attempted
  aminolysis, since in related examples the Ph-substituent appeared to have a stabilizing
  influence. In any event dihydrodipyrrin 13a was best prepared using conditions ii,
  as was the n-decyl derivative 13e (cf. ). All of these results are summarized in
  . Because of the unpredictable effect of meso-substituents R on substrate reactivity/stability
  a truly general synthesis of formyl derivatives 13 remains elusive. However, this
  investigation culminated in two complementary routes to these key intermediates
  that together are far more efficient than our original approach.
