caption: DISC1 regulates neurogenesis via Wnt/β-catenin signaling. During canonical
  Wnt signaling, β-catenin levels are kept low in the cytosol due to GSK3β-mediated
  phosphorylation which targets β-catenin for degradation. In the presence of Wnt
  ligands, the receptor complex and downstream signaling machinery is engaged, leading
  to increased accumulation of β-catenin and transcription of Wnt-dependent genes.
  In embryonic and adult neural progenitors, DISC1 directly binds and inhibits the
  function of GSK3β, thereby increasing cytosolic β-catenin concentration and functioning
  as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling. This function of DISC1 is similar to Akt
  and Lithium (used to treat mood disorders), which can also inhibit GSK3β, suggesting
  this pathway plays an important role in psychiatric disease.
