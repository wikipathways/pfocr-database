caption: Pathway by which starvation induces a glucagon-mediated increase in liver
  autophagy. Starvation lowers blood glucose levels leading to release of glucagon
  from the pancreas. Glucagon binds to receptors on the hepatocyte to trigger calcium
  release into the cytosol from intracellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum
  by activation of the calcium channel InsP3R1. The increase in intracellular Ca2+
  activates CaMKII by phosphorylation, and this kinase in turn phosphorylates and
  activates OGT. OGT activation triggers ULK1 O-GlcNAcylation which promotes ULK1
  association with AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation. Activated ULK1 phosphorylates Beclin
  1 to initiate phagophore formation and increase autophagy. Increased autophagy supplies
  substrates including amino acids, glucose and free fatty acids (FAA) to maintain
  cellular energy levels in the setting of starvation. This nutritional up regulation
  of autophagy by glucagon may also serve to increase the other beneficial effects
  of autophagy in the hepatocyte such as resistance to cell injury and death.
