caption: PEP and DHAP generated from glycolysis occurring in the cytosol of the parasites
  enter the apicoplast via the apicoplast phosphate transporter (TgAPT1). They are
  then converted to pyruvate and G3P by a PK and GpdA, respectively. A PDHC (only
  present in the apicoplast []) is responsible for the formation of acetyl-CoA from
  pyruvate. ACC converts this to malonyl CoA. FabD/H complex leads to the attachment
  of an ACP and the loss of CoA resulting in ACP-malonyl. The FASII complex (comprised
  of FabG/B/F/I/Z) are responsible for the formation of short FA chains, mainly C14:0
  and C16:0 fatty acyl (FA) ACP-chains. Esterification of FA-ACP from FASII or FA-CoAs
  from scavenged FAs on a G3P backbone (i.e., acylation) can occur in both the apicoplast
  by a plant-like acyltransferase TgATS1 [], and/or at the ER by a GPAT []. It is
  the first step for the de novo synthesis of all glycerolipids and results in the
  synthesis of LPA. LPA can be further acylated with another FA chain resulting in
  PA by ATS2-apicoplast or AGPAT-based ER []. LIPIN is responsible for the dephosphorylation
  of PA into DAG []. DAG can be further acylated into TAG by DGATs []. Elongation
  of FA chains can occur in the elongation pathway in the ER via ELO-A/B/C []. FASI
  is present in T. gondii parasite and not essential during tachyzoite stages and
  has not been further characterized []. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACP, acyl-carrier
  protein; DAG, diacylglycerol; DGAT, DAG acyltransferase; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; FA, fatty acid; GpdA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; G3P,
