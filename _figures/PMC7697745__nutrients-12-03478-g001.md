caption: 'Absorption of haem and non-haem iron through the duodenal enterocyte. Non-haem
  absorption pathway: Ferric iron (Fe3+) is first reduced to ferrous iron (Fe2+) by
  the enzyme, Duodenal cytochrome B (DcytB). Fe2+ can then be absorbed across the
  apical surface via the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and exported via ferroportin.
  Haem absorption pathway: Haem iron is absorbed directly into the enterocyte through
  haem carrier protein (HCP1). Once inside the enterocyte, haem iron can either be
  released into plasma via the FLVCR1 receptor or be converted to Fe2+ through the
  enzyme haem oxidase (HO). Before exportation, Fe2+ is oxidized back to its Fe3+
  form via Hephaestin. Hepcidin controls ferroportin and will inhibit iron export
  in the presence of inflammation. Facilitators of iron absorption include ascorbic
  acid, citrate and amino acids while inhibitors include phytate, tannins and antacids.'
