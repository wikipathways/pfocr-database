caption: The regulation of metabolic pathways was reconstructed based on the metabolomic
  data of latently infected microglial cells (HC69) as compared to their uninfected
  counterpart (C20). Enzymes are shown in italics. The figure includes the main energetic
  pathways described in the paper, as well as relevant connections with pathways that
  were significantly enriched in the analysis shown in Fig . The red lines indicate
  the pathway proposed to be active in latently infected cells. Solid lines indicate
  direct connections. Dashed lines indicate indirect connections involving intermediate
  metabolites not shown in the figure. Networks were built using the Cytoscape software
  (http://www.cytoscape.org) and the MetScape plugin (http://metscape.ncibi.org/tryplugin.html)
  (Gao et al, ) and adapted using Adobe Illustrator (v 16.03). Nicotinamide and glycerolipid
  pathways were included in the figure as they were found to be significantly enriched
  [nicotinamide (Q statistic = 45.127, P = 0.0069702 and FDR= 0.010205); glycerolipid
  (Q statistic = 80.501, P = 0.015301 and FDR= 0.020291)] in latently infected cells,
