caption: Overall organization of mitotic exit control. Mitotic exit is controlled
  by a series of systems that both activate (green pointed arrows) and inhibit (red
  block arrows) one another as cells pass from M into G1 phase. The temporal sequence
  in which the systems function during mitotic exit is ordered from top to bottom.
  A recurring theme is that a regulator will activate a downstream process that ultimately
  antagonizes the activator. For example, mitotic cyclin–Cdk1 promotes APCCdc20 function
  and the FEAR pathway, which both then oppose M-phase CDK function. The large-scale
  processes occurring sequentially during mitotic exit are shown in blue boxes on
  the right, connected by dashed lines to the regulatory systems that promote them.
