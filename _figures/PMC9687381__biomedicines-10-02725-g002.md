caption: 'The influence of the Eret stress pathway components on the metabolic processes
  of lipids in the liver. In the red circles, pathway elements have been marked, the
  expression of which has been described in the literature, as altered by androgens
  or their disturbed metabolism. Testosterone binds to androgen receptors (AR), which
  dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they can attach to androgen response
  elements (AREs) and control the expression of androgen regulated genes (ORP150—oxygen-regulated
  protein 150, PDI—protein disulfide isomerase, Herpud—homocysteine inducible ER protein
  with ubiquitin like domain 1). Androgens also affect ATF6, protein kinase R-like
  endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease
  1α (IRE), and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Fiansteride (Fin) may be an additional
  element modulating ERet stress by influencing the level of androgens. Note: XBP1
  is characterized by variable expression depending on the severity of symptoms in
  some diseases.'
