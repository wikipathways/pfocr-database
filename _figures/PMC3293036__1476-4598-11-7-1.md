caption: Schematic representation of the Wnt signaling pathway in cancer cells. In
  the presence of active Wnt, β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm, then localizes
  to the nucleus, and activates transcription together with TCF/LEF transcription
  factors. Negative regulators are depicted in red and positive regulators in green.
  Activation of the mTOR pathway is also directly regulated by Wnt-dependent downregulation
  of GSK3 kinase activity which is depicted in yellow.
