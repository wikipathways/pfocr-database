caption: 'Transcriptional repression of glucose metabolism by metabolic gatekeepers
  prevents B-cell transformation and is lost during oncogenic signaling. (A) Gatekeeper
  transcription factors (PAX5, IKZF1) limit glucose consumption and the production
  of metabolites that fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), thus limiting the energy
  (ATP) production necessary for neoplastic transformation; (B) Genetic alterations
  leading to loss of PAX5 or IKZF1 gatekeeper functions allow an unrestricted consumption
  of glucose (glycolytic flux) and sufficient energy production to permit transformation.
  In B cells, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is required in order to further enhance
  glucose utilization, which is also through the PPP pathway. Solid arrows indicate
  activity of the pathway; dashed lines indicate inhibited or weak activities. GLUT:
