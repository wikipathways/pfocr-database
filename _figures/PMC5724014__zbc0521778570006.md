caption: The mechanisms of cytokine-induced dysfunction and death of insulin-secreting
  cells mediated by intracellular S1P. A, control conditions. B, Cytokine incubation.
  A, pancreatic β-cells are characterized by a relatively high endogenous expression
  of the proapoptotic SK2, which generates S1P. S1P is well metabolized upon control
  conditions as a result of an adequate expression of sphingolipid pathway enzymes,
  together with a parallel presence of S1P transporters (T) and receptors (R). This
  keeps S1P at a low concentration and enables the proper function and viability of
  β-cells and participates in Ca2+ homeostasis. B, proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β,
  TNFα, and IFNγ, acting via their specific extracellular receptors, stimulate the
  expression and activity of SK2, resulting in an increased rate of S1P generation
  in ER, mitochondria, and nucleus. In parallel, cytokines decrease the expression
  of S1P transporters and SPL, leading to the accumulation of S1P within the cell.
  The transcription factor CHOP, which participates in β-cell apoptosis, is activated,
  and the chaperone protein BIP is down-regulated in the ER. BIP is a partner protein
  for the polypeptide-transporting channel SEC61 (which binds to its SEC61a1 subunit),
  and the decreased expression of BIP results in the failure of SEC61 channel closure
  and leakage of Ca2+ from the ER lumen into the cytoplasm. Elevation of cytosolic
  Ca2+ activates calpain, leading to dephosphorylation of BAD. This results in cytochrome
  c release from the mitochondrial membrane and caspase-3/7 activation. A parallel
  increase in Ca2+ within mitochondria disturbs mitochondrial function. S1P produced
  inside the nucleus regulates the expression level of a variety of genes probably
  by histone deacetylase modifications. S1P accumulation results in a reduction of
  prohibitin 2 and mimitin expression, the two mitochondrial proteins involved in
  ATP generation. As a consequence, the ATP content is reduced, leading to disturbances
  in glucose-induced insulin secretion. A reduced ATP content potentiates the proapoptotic
  effect of intracellular S1P. Thus, intracellular S1P is a novel and important second
  messenger and regulatory molecule involved in cytokine-mediated β-cell dysfunction
  and death.
