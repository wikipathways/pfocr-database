caption: (for the most recent review see [], only the latest references are included
  in the legend). ESR components (orange) are shown in the context of GNB structure
  and biogenesis pathways (). OMPs are shown in solid dark blue, while lipoproteins
  are shown with pattern fill. Stress (red stars) can directly or indirectly (through
  inhibition of a biogenesis pathway) activate ESRs. Solid arrows represent signaling
  events that are relatively well-established and dashed lines represent proposed
  events that not yet fully understood.(A) Rcs (regulator of capsule synthesis). The
  OM sensory lipoprotein RcsF and the IM negative regulator IgaA are central to regulation
  of RcsCDB phosphorelay, in which RcsC is the hybrid histidine kinase, RcsD the phosphotransfer
  and RcsB, the cytoplasmic transcriptional response regulator. RcsB works as a homodimer
  or as a heterodimer with RcsA. In the absence of stress, IgaA keeps the system inactive
  by repressing the phosphotransfer protein RcsD []. In response to stress or when
  it accumulates at the IM, RcsF interacts with the periplasmic domain of IgaA, releasing
  the inhibition of phosphorelay. At the OM, the Bam complex assembles RcsF in a complex
  with OMPs, resulting in partial surface exposure. This topology allows RcsF to monitor
  the integrity of the LPS layer. While a growing body of evidence suggests that RcsF
  is not a sensor of Bam complex activity [], it remains unknown whether periplasmic
  retention of RcsF increases signaling.(B) Cpx (conjugative pilus expression). CpxAR
  is a classical two-component system with positive (NlpE) and negative (CpxP) regulators.
  The OM lipoprotein NlpE is only required to sense a subset of cues, such as lipoprotein
  biogenesis defects. When export of NlpE is compromised, it interacts directly with
  the periplasmic domain of CpxA histidine kinase, leading to phosphorylation of the
  transcriptional response regulator CpxR [,]. CpxA can also be activated by PG defects
  or IM-mistargeted OMPs; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknow. Periplasmic
  CpxP is both an effector and negative regulator of CpxA and provides negative feedback,
  helping to fine-tune Cpx output. While some misfolded proteins help to titrate CpxP
  and promote signaling, attenuation of CpxP is not generally required for CpxA activation.(C)
  σE. σE is the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) alternative σ factor. In the absence
  of stress, the transmembrane anti-σ factor RseA inhibits σE. The signaling pathway
  relies on regulated proteolysis of RseA by DegS, RseP, and ClpXP proteases. PDZ
  domains of DegS recognize the YxF motif of periplasmic uOMPs, initiating a proteolytic
  cascade. Defects in biosynthesis and export of LPS synergistically induce σE. While
  the precise underlying mechanism is unknown, it involves releasing RseB inhibition
  of DegS-dependent RseA cleavage.
