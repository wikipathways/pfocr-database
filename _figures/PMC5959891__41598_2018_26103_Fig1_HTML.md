caption: The acetic acid biosynthesis pathway in plants. Pyruvate is converted to
  acetaldehyde by PDC1 and the resultant acetaldehyde is converted to acetic acid
  by ALDH2B7. Acetaldehyde may also be converted to ethanol and vice versa. According
  to Rasheed et al. (2016a), genes shown in red were up-regulated in response to drought
  stress, while the genes shown in blue were down-regulated. *The expression of only
  the mitochondrial PDH-E1 alpha (AT1G01090) and beta (AT1G30120) subunits decreased
  significantly in response to drought stress.
