caption: Survival pathways with their cross-talk and immune regulatory mechanisms
  are shown in this pictorial representation of the Reed-Sternberg (R-S) cell. CD30,
  CD40, and receptor activator of NF-kB (RANK) receptors on R-S cells are activated
  by autocrine and paracrine loops leading to activation of PI3K and phosphorylation
  of AKT, promoting growth and survival. IL-21 activates STAT3 and upregulates STAT3
  target genes, triggering anti-apoptotic mechanisms, and inducing trafficking of
  CCR4 and CCR6- expressing T regulatory cells towards the neoplastic cells. Phos-phorylated
  STAT3 upregulates IL-23 and induces Foxp3 expression in Tregs expressing the IL-23
  receptor. These immune regulatory cells modulate the anti-tumor immunity by secretion
  of IL-10 and IFN-y, both of which block the adaptive and effector immune response.
  PKC-α activation is associated with increased immune modulation and reduced apoptosis
  by Bcl-2 overexpression in hematologic malignancies. Inhibition of AKT, NF-kB, STAT3,
  PKC-α and MAPK-ERK pathways induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The use of an
  SFK inhibitor has the potential to modulate the immune escape mechanisms by blocking
  the STAT pathway.
