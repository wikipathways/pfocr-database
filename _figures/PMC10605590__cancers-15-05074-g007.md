caption: 'Schematic overview of the potential non-genomic P4 action in colorectal
  cancer. P4 may initiate rapid non-classical signaling through the complex of PGRMC1
  and NENF, leading to increased proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells.
  However, P4 cannot activate the classical genomic signaling pathway due to weak
  PGR expression in colorectal cancer cells (arrow: ↓PGR—weak PGR expression). P4
  or NENF may significantly increase the release of IL-8 by colorectal cancer cells
  (arrow: ↑IL-8—increased release of IL-8). P4 significantly up-regulates mPRα and
  mPRγ expression in colorectal cancer cells (arrow: ↑mPR-α, ↑mPR-γ—increased expression
  of mPR-α and mPR-γ). NENF, neuron-derived neurotrophic factor; P4, progesterone;
  PGR, nuclear progesterone receptor; and PGRMC1, progesterone receptor membrane component
