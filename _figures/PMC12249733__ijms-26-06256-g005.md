caption: The involvement of the DEGs of NC and IC associated with effects of ACTH(6-9)PGP
  peptide a day after IR conditions in striatum. In the network, pathway clusters
  (NC and IC) are grouped in the white ellipses. The genes are represented by rectangular
  blocks colored according to their differential expression in IA-s vs. IR-s pairwise
  comparison. The only genes included were in the network were DEGs in IA-s vs. IR-s
  but not IA-f vs. IR-f at 24 h after tMCAO. The lines connecting the pathways and
  genes indicate the participation of the protein products of genes in the pathway
  functioning. Genes are grouped in accordance with their association with pathway
  clusters, as well as up/downregulation of their expression in IA-s vs. IR-s. Thus,
  four gene groups were revealed in the network. The KEGG databases from the DAVID
  database (2021 update) were used to annotate all clustered signaling pathways. Only
  DEGs and annotations with Padj < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Cytoscape
  3.9.2 (Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA, USA) was used to create the network
