caption: Inhibition of T‐cell activation. In T cell activation, CK2 phosphorylates
  PTEN. PTEN inhibits PI3K, which leads to the dephosphorylation of PIP3 to generate
  PIP2, making PIP3 less available in the cell. Therefore, T cell activation results
  in a reduction of PI3K inhibition. PD‐1 inhibits the phosphorylation of PTEN and
  stimulates PTEN phosphatase activity by inhibiting CK2, thus terminates PI3K/Akt
  pathway initiation. Therefore, T cell proliferation will decrease. SHP‐2 binds to
  the cytoplasmic tail of PD‐1 from the site of ITSM. Another signaling pathway that
  PD‐1 affects is the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway. MEK‐ERK pathway is downstream to Ras, and
  Ras signaling pathway is important for T cell development, proliferation, and differentiation.
  Ras includes diacylglycerol (DAG)‐binding domain and a couple of calcium‐binding
  EF‐hands. PLCγ1 hydrolyzes PIP2, resulting in DAG and IP3 generation. IP3 stimulates
  release of calcium from intracellular stores. DAG and Ca2+ are necessary for the
  activation of RasGRP1. Hence, PLCγ1 activation brings about RasGRP1 activation.
  PD‐1 has the ability of PLCγ1 inhibition, and actually, PD‐1 inhibits TCR linkage
  to Ras and restricts T cell development, proliferation, and differentiation. Parts
