  identifies recurrently mutated genes and recurrent sCNAs in CLL, respectively. Bold
  – significantly mutated genes identified in a previous CLL sequencing effort ().
  * - novel CLL genes identified in the present analysis (). ‘n’ – number of samples
  out of 160 CLLs harboring a mutation in a specific gene; ‘n_cosmic’ – number of
  samples harboring a mutation in a specific gene at a site previously observed in
  the COSMIC database. (B) The significantly mutated genes fall into seven core signaling
  pathways, in which the genes play well-established roles. Red - genes with significant
  mutation frequencies; pink - additional pathway genes with mutations.
