caption: A model for regulation of antiviral innate immunity by BA metabolism. Viral
  infection triggers an immediate-early NF-κB activation, which induces expression
  of BA transporter and rate-limiting biosynthesis enzymes, leading to accumulation
  of intracellular BAs by both de novo biosynthesis and uptake. The accumulated intracellular
  BAs activates a TGR5-β-arrestin-SRC pathway, leading to SRC-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation
  of several key innate antiviral signaling components, including RIG-I, VSIA, MITA,
  TBK1 and IRF3. The tyrosine phosphorylation of these components enables their activation
  by viral nucleic acid-triggered signaling, leading to innate antiviral immune response

  axis to enable innate antiviral immunity.
