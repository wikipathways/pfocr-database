caption: Sources of NO in blood vessels. The main source of NO in blood vessels is
  endothelial cells that express eNOS, which is activated by different stimuli including
  shear stress, bradykinin (BK), VEGF, insulin and other stimuli that could increase
  intracellular calcium concentration. White blood cells (WBC) produced NO by the
  activity of eNOS and iNOS also involved in platelet inhibition. The questions whether
  erythrocytes (RBC) also express functionally active eNOS and whether they could
  produce NO which reaches platelets are still not clear.
