caption: A schematic diagram showing how cigarette smoke increases OPN expression
  and stimulates the recruitment of MSCs to lung cancer cells. Our model illustrates
  the potential mechanisms that facilitate cigarette smoke-induced promotion of OPN
  expression and MSC recruitment by lung cancer cells. Arrow 1 refers to the effects
  of long-term CSE and B[α]P exposure, with subsequent increases in OPN expression
  in lung cancer cells via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Arrow 2 refers to the
  process whereby integrin-positive and CD44-positive MSC cells are recruited to the
  lung TME and adhere to lung cancer cells. Arrow 3 refers to the events that occur
  when OPN induces MSC formation to TA-MSCs, which stimulates the invasiveness of
  lung cancer cells in vitro and lung tumor metastasis in vivo (3).
