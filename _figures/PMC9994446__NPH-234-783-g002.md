caption: Overview of auxin metabolism, transport and signalling. (a) Auxin levels
  are maintained through de novo synthesis (blue), conjugation (yellow) and degradation
  (green). In the well characterised TAA/YUC tryptophan (Trp)‐dependent synthesis
  pathway, Trp is initially converted into indol‐3‐pyruvate (IPA) by tryptophan aminotransferase
  (TAA) enzymes. IPA is then converted into indol‐3‐acetic acid (IAA), which is the
  most common form of auxin, by YUCCA (YUC) enzymes. The levels of IPA intermediate
  available in a cell can be controlled by the pyridoxal phosphate‐dependent aminotransferase
  VAS1, which converts IPA back into Trp. Conjugation with amino acids, peptides or
  sugars regulates the amount of biologically active auxin with enzymes such as Gretchen
  Hagen 3 (GH3) and UDP‐glucosyl transferase (UGT) conjugating IAA with amino acids
  or sugars, respectively. Conjugation with amino acids such as alanine and leucine
  is generally reversible via enzymes such as IAA‐LEUCINE RESISTANT 1‐like (IRL1)
  and its homologue IAA‐ALANINE RESISTANT 3 (IAR3), whereas conjugation with aspartic
  acid (Asp) or glutamic acid (Glu) flags auxin for oxidation to 2‐oxindole‐3‐acetic
  acid (oxIAA) and subsequent degradation. oxIAA can also be generated independently
  of conjugation by the enzyme DIOXYGENASE FOR AUXIN OXIDATION (DAO). (b) Summary
  of auxin transport pathways identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. Auxin can move in
  and out of the cell via plasmodesmata (purple arrow) and diffuse in as IAAH (blue
  arrow). Other flux is mediated by transporter proteins that are localised in the
  plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. AUX/LAX (yellow) transporters move auxin
  into the cell whereas PIN (blue) and ABCB (orange) transporters move auxin out of
  the cell. Transport between the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum is mediated
  by PIN (influx and efflux) and PIN‐LIKES (PILS; grey) (influx only) transporters.
  (c) Canonical auxin signalling pathway. Auxin response factor (ARF) transcription
  factors bind to auxin response elements (AuxRE) in the promoters of auxin responsive
  genes. At low concentrations of auxin, Aux/IAA proteins interact with ARFs to inhibit
  their activity whereas at high concentrations auxin mediates an interaction between
  Aux/IAA and the TIR1/AFB F‐box protein of the E3 Ubiquitin ligase Skp, Cullin, F‐box
  containing (SCF) complex. This interaction leads to polyubiquitination of the Aux/IAA
  and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. As a consequence, ARF inhibition is
  relieved enabling expression or repression of the auxin responsive gene depending
  on whether the ARF is an activator or a repressor (only activation is shown).
