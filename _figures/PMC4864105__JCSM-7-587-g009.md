caption: 'Schematic model of the effects of docosahexaenoic acid on muscle protein
  turnover and lipid mobilization during 48 h fasting. Left panel: Akt‐ and adenosine
  monophosphate‐activated protein kinase‐dependent signalling pathways are down and
  up‐regulated by fasting, respectively, resulting in reduced protein synthesis and
  enhanced proteolysis. The endocannabinoid system can inactivate the Akt‐dependent
  signalling pathway (22, 23), and is also induced in fasting. Finally, fasting also
  induced lipid droplet markers (Rab18 and PLINs expression), providing cells with
  energy through lipid mobilization. Right panel: docosahexaenoic acid (i) preserved
  Akt activity and blocked the activation of the endocannabinoid system during fasting.
  Whether the effect of docosahexaenoic acid on Akt activity during fasting is direct
  or indirect via the endocannabinoid system remains to be elucidated. Furthermore,
  docosahexaenoic acid had (ii) no effect on markers of protein synthesis, but (iii)
  partially prevented adenosine monophosphate‐activated protein kinase and proteolysis
  activation, and iv) modulated the overexpression of lipid droplet markers. The latter
  changes may modify the subpopulations of lipid droplets and therefore influence
  lipid mobilization (34, 38–40). This scheme suggests that docosahexaenoic acid changed
  either the nature of intracellular lipids and/or improve lipid mobilization efficiency,
  resulting in subsequent muscle protein sparing. Arrows indicate positive inputs
  whereas lines ending with a cross bar indicate inhibitory inputs. The docosahexaenoic
  acid effect is indicated in green lines vs. standard conditions in blue lines. Crosses
  indicate that docosahexaenoic acid blocked the fasting effect. Finally, dashed green
  line indicates that docosahexaenoic acid modified the fasting effect. Thick or thin
  lines denote strong or slight effects, respectively. Effects represented by dotted
  lines remain to be demonstrated.'
