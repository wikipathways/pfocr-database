caption: Proposed mechanisms of HPV16 E6 in oral carcinogenesis. HPV16 E6-activated
  LT is involved in TAP suppression in human oral cancer. HPV16 E6 upregulates lymphotoxin
  which functionally affects the stability of MHC-I by suppression of genes that are
  involved in MHC-I-dependent antigen presentation, TAP. Impaired T-cell responses
  could promote the persistent infection of HPV in oral cells, leading to oral cancer
  development and progression.
