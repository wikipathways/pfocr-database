caption: TGFβ and tumor suppression. (a) Cell cycle inhibition. TGFβ exerts strong
  cytostatic effects and induces cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase by increasing the
  expression of the small cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15, p21, and p27. These
  effects are Smad-dependent but also require the transcription factors Sp1 and FoxO.
  p15 directly inhibits CDK4/6 and displaces p21 and p27 from their preexisting CDK4/6
  complexes allowing them to bind and inhibit CDK2-cyclin A/E complexes (orange arrows).
  TGFβ-induced cell cycle arrest also relies on the downregulation of the oncogene
  c-myc through Smads and repressor E2F4/5. The transcription factors from the ID
  family are also repressed by TGFβ through Smads, MAD2/4, and ATF3, further contributing
  to TGFβ-mediated cell cycle arrest. Finally, other pathways, potentially more tissue
  specific, have been described, including upregulation of the tumor suppressor menin
  in pituitary adenomas, leading to G1 arrest, and downregulation of the tyrosine
  phosphatase CDC25A in mammary epithelial cells, also leading to G1 arrest. (b) Induction
  of apoptosis. A central pathway in the mediation of the TGFβ proapoptotic effects
  involves the E2F1-pRb-P/CAF pathway that leads to gene transcription of multiple
  TGFβ proapoptotic target genes in various types of normal and cancer cells. In hematopoietic
  cells, TGFβ specifically induces expression of the lipid phosphatase SHIP, which
  in turn decreases second messenger PIP3 level and blocks Akt-mediated survival pathways,
  leading to cell death in both B and T lymphocytes. Other tissue specific proapoptotic
  pathways have been described downstream of TGFβ, including the TGFβ-mediated induction
  of the two proapoptotic proteins DAXX and DAPK in liver cells, the transcription
  factor TIEG1 in pancreatic cells, and the mitochondrial protein ARTS. TGFβ also
  promotes apoptosis in an SAPK-dependent manner by inducing pro-apoptotic target
  gene expression (Bmf, Bim and Bax) and by repressing antiapoptotic gene expression
  (Bcl-Xl and Bcl-2), further inducing mitochondrial release of cytochrome C and activation
  of the apoptosome, leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis in hepatocytes and B-lymphocytes.
  In colon cancer, TGFβ was also shown to inhibit expression of the prosurvival protein
  survivin. (c) Inhibition of cell immortalization. TGFβ also exerts its tumor suppressive
  effects through inhibition of cell immortalization in normal and cancer cells. This
  effect is mediated through the Smad, p38, and JNK pathways and requires recruitment
  of histone deacetylases (HDAC) to the telomerase (hTERT) gene promoter, further
  leading to inhibition of telomerase expression, and thereby preventing cell immortalization.
