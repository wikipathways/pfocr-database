caption: 'Gut dysbiosis/permeability increase circulating LPS and exosomal HMGB1,
  leading to TLR activation in microglia and the induction of iNOS and superoxide.
  This leads to the formation of ONOO-, which is a major inducer of aSMase and ceramide.
  Ceramide has negative impacts on mitochondria functioning, both directly and via
  the inhibition of orexin and melatonin. Orexin, melatonin, and butyrate disinhibit
  PDC, leading to an increased conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which is the
  necessary co-substrate for AANAT and the initiation of the mitochondria melatonergic
  pathway. Increased mitochondria melatonin promotes SOD2, sirtuin-3, and oxidative
  phosphorylation. By decreasing cellular 14–3-3, ceramide may also inhibit the stabilization
  of AANAT, thereby preventing the initiation of the melatonergic pathway. Ceramide
  also increases metabolic syndrome, lipid dysregulation, and gluconeogenesis, all
  of which are more evident in MS. Gut dysbiosis/permeability have reciprocal interactions
  with stress, cytokines, and oxidative stress, which can all increase IDO and TDO,
  leading to kynurenine, which activates the AhR and increases CYP1b1, leading to
  the backward conversion of melatonin to NAS. Gut dysbiosis/permeability lowers butyrate
  levels, thereby decreasing butyrate’s suppression of ceramide. Butyrate drives the
  conversion of ceramide to glucosylceramide and the MS-protective gangliosides. The
  decrease in butyrate attenuates its inhibition of glia and immune cell reactivity,
  likely mediated via butyrate regulation of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway.
