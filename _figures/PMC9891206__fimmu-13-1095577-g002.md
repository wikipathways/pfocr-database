caption: The cGAS-STING signaling pathway STING is a pattern recognition receptor
  (PRR) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that does not bind directly to DNA. Pathogenic
  microorganisms and damaged host cells can release double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The
  cytoplasmic DNA sensor, cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), recognizes dsDNA and catalyzes
  the synthesis of cGAMP from ATP and GTP. The cGAMP binds to STING, triggering STING
  conformational transitions, dimerization, and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi
  intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi apparatus (Golgi). The dimerized
  STING recruits TBK1, which induces the production of IRF3 and NF-κB. Subsequently,
  IRF3 and NF-κB translocate to the nucleus to induce the production of IFN-I and
  pro-inflammatory factors.
