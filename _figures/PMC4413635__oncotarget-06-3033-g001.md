  Rb protein is a tumor suppressor that plays a pivotal role in the negative control
  of the cell cycle; Rb1 loss of function is frequently observed in cancer []. When
  Rb1 is phosphorylated, E2F is released and can transcriptionally activate its target
  genes, enabling the G1/S transition of cell cycle. Cyclin D1 (CCND1) can also be
  regulated at the transcription level by the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway and at the translation
  level by mTOR via S6K and 4EBP1 [, , , ]. mTOR inhibitors may attenuate CCND1 action
  by decreasing translation of CCND1. CDK4/6 inhibitors may attenuate the effects
  of this pathway as well, especially in the presence of CDK4/6 amplification or CDKN2A/B
  loss (since CDKN2A/B inhibits CDK4/6 activity). Patients with Rb1 loss or mutations
  would be expected to be resistant to agents such as mTOR or CDK4/6 inhibitors that
  act more proximally.
