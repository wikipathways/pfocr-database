caption: 'Intracellular signaling pathways involved in initiation and perpetuation
  of hepatic stellate cell activation. Initiation of the activated state involves
  engagement of proliferative and activating pathways, including TGFβR (PDB IDs 1KTZ,
  3TZM, 5E8U, 5E8V); binding and downstream nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 and Smad
  4 proteins, resulting in transcription and translation of profibrotic genes. Binding
  of PDGF to its receptor PDGFR (PDB ID 5GRN) results in activation of cytoplasmic
  Ras and MAPK effectors, with subsequent nuclear translocation and expression of
  proliferative genes. Engagement of the GPCR CCR5 (PDB ID 6AKX) results in clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis, activation and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2, and expression of proliferative
  genes, also allowing for migratory properties. Cytokines also have significant modulatory
  properties on fibrogenesis; for example, binding of IL-17 to its receptor IL-17R
  (PDB ID 4HSA) results in activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway, resulting in
  pro-inflammatory gene expression. Programmed cell death can be facilitated via innate
  immune signaling; engagement of TLRs (PDB IDs 6NIH, 2MKA, 2J67); with various TLR
  ligands propagates downstream signaling culminating in autophagy, apoptosis or pyroptosis.
  Nuclear membrane receptors also have large roles in modulating profibrogenic properties;
  engagement of ligands, including fatty acids and thiazolidinediones, with receptors
  of the PPAR family, including PPARγ (PDB ID 2Q8S), results in nuclear translocation,
  heterodimerization with RXR and binding with DNA (PDB ID 3DZU), with subsequent
  expression of antifibrogenic genes. Binding of obeticholic acid to FXR and of vitamin
  D to VDR results in receptor nuclear translocation, heterodimerization with RXR
  and expression of antifibrogenic genes. Meanwhile, binding of heme to Rev-Erb upregulates
  Rev-Erb expression, accumulation of Rev-Erb in the cytoplasm and promotion of a
  profibrogenic, contractile HSC phenotype. Crystal structures rendered with NGL Viewer.Abbreviations:
