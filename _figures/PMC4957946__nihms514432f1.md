caption: mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates protein synthesis necessary
  for cell growth, proliferation, metabolism and angiogenesis. The binding of growth
  factors to cell surface receptors, such as VEGFr, IGF-receptor (IGF-1r) and EGFr,
  and by nutrients (amino acids and glucose) entering the cell, subsequently stimulate
  the mTOR signaling pathway. Key upstream elements include PI3K and AKT involved
  in the phosphorylation and activation of mTOR. Intracellular kinase PI3K synthesizes
  membrane phospholipids responsible for activation of the kinase AKT while negative
  regulator PTEN reverses PI3K activity and suppresses AKT activation. Activation
  of AKT facilitates phosphorylation of the tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressor gene
  TSC2 and leads to inactivation the TSC1-2 complex, a key regulator of mTORC1. mTORC1
  controls essential signal transduction pathways via its downstream effectors S6K1
  and 4E-BP1 and coordinates the production of the transcription factor HIF-1α. Promotion
  of transcription of angiogenic factors such as VEGF is regulated by HIF-1α in complex
  with HIF-1β. Dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is observed in many cancers.
  A number of mechanisms are responsible for hyperactive mTOR signaling including
  overexpression or activation of growth factor receptors, activation of mutations
  in PI3K/AKT and decreased expression of PTEN, TSC1–2 or VHL. In this figure, activation
  is depicted as an arrow while inhibition is represented as a bar.4E-BP1, 4E-binding
  protein 1; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
