caption: Schematic diagram of Orai1-mediated store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) signal
  transduction pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after parathyroid
  hormone (PTH) stimulation. In this proposed mechanism, PTH acts on its receptor
  PTHR1, a G-protein coupled receptor, to produce phospholipase C (PLC) and then inositol
  triphosphate (IP3), which stimulates its receptor to deplete Ca2+ stores in the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to the opening of the Orai1 channel in HUVECs
  to induce extracellular Ca2+ influx via SOCE. The subsequent increase in intracellular
  Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) causes the nuclear translocation of NFATC1 through the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  kinase 2 (CaMK-II)/calcineurin signaling pathway, and eventually induces COL1A1
  overexpression and HUVEC migration and proliferation.
