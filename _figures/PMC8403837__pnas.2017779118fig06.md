caption: Model illustrating the regional impact of inactivating Hh signaling in adult
  astrocytes on the BBB. (Left) Intact Hh signaling in astrocytes. (1) Binding of
  Shh to the Ptch1 receptor (purple) on astrocytes relieves inhibition on Smo (pink)
  and activates downstream Hh signaling targets, including Gli1 (indicated by green
  astrocyte endfoot). (2) Intact TJ between ECs presents a physical barrier to the
  paracellular diffusion of plasma components into the CNS. (3) Transcytosis of plasma
  proteins (e.g., albumin; blue/purple bubbles) is suppressed in CNS ECs under normal
  conditions in comparison to peripheral vessels (see enlarged illustration). (Right)
  Blocked Hh signaling in astrocytes. (4) Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of Smo
  in astrocytes prevents pathway activation and expression of downstream factors (i.e.,
  Gli1) (indicated by gray astrocyte endfoot). (5) The paracellular TJ barrier remains
  intact in cells with blocked astrocytic Hh signaling. (6) Inhibition of astrocytic
  Hh signaling results in increased transcytosis (see enlarged illustration) and accumulation
  of plasma proteins in the CNS parenchyma of the hypothalamus and spinal cord but
  not the cortex. Image created with BioRender.com.
