caption: Schematic representation of photosynthetic electron transport. Arrangement
  of Photosystem I (PSI), Photosystem II (PSII), cytochrome b6f and adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) synthase complexes within the thylakoid membranes is shown. The light-driven
  water splitting reaction leads to O2 evolution and originates linear electron transport
  (LET), indicated with black arrows, from water to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADP+), which is coupled to proton translocation from stroma into the
  luminal side of thylakoids during the light phase. The electrochemical gradient
  formed is used by the ATP synthase to produce ATP from Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
  and Pi in the stroma. The NADPH and ATP formed during the light phase drive the
  Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle reactions in the stroma. Two pathways of cyclic electron
  transport (CET) around PSI are indicated with red (Ferredoxin-dependent pathway)
  and green (NDA2-dependent pathway) arrows, respectively.
