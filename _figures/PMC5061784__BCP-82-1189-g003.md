caption: Overview of the HER2/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC pathway and potential sites for
  intervention with small molecule membrane‐permeable inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies
  (MoAbs). The HER2 receptor is indicated in blue. In this figure it is depicted as
  a homodimer, although it can also heterodimerize with other EGFR family members.
  The downstream PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway is regulated by Ras (indicated in green
  ovals), PTEN indicated in a black octagon, insulin regulated substrate 1 (IRS1)
  Shc, Grb2, Sos and β‐catenin are indicated in orange ovals. Kinases are indicated
  in green ovals. The p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (p85PI3Kα) is indicated in a
  green oval. The phosphatases which inhibit steps in this pathway are indicated in
  black octagons. TSC1 and TSC2 are indicated in black squares. PIP2 and PIP3 are
  indicated in yellow ovals. The mTORC1 blockers (rapalogs), PI3K and mTOR inhibitors
  are indicated in red octagons. The AMPK activator metformin is indicated in a green
  octagon. mTOR interacting proteins, which positively regulate mTOR activity, are
  indicated in yellow ovals. mTOR interacting proteins which negatively regulate mTOR
  activity are indicated in black ovals. Transcription factors activated by either
  ERK or Akt phosphorylation are indicated in yellow diamonds. The FKHR transcription
  factor that is inactivated by Akt phosphorylation is indicated by a black diamond
  and a white P in a black circle. FKHR is also activated by GSK‐3β phosphorylation
  which is indicated by a white P in a red circle. mRNA initiation factors and proteins
  associated with the ribosome are indicated in magenta ovals. mTORC1 phosphorylates
  the unc‐51‐like kinase 1 (ULK1) which results in the suppression of autophagy. ULK1
  is indicated in a black oval. In contrast, AMPK activates both ULK1 and autophagy
  as well as TSC activity. Proteins involved in the regulation of translation are
  indicated in purple ovals. Red arrows indicate activating events in pathways. Black
  arrows indicate inactivating events in pathways. Activating phosphorylation events
  are depicted in red circles with Ps with a black outlined circle. Inactivating phosphorylation
  events are depicted in black circles with Ps with a red outlined circle
