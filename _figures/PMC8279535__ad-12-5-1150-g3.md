caption: Role of T lymphocytes during osteoimmunology. Under physiological conditions,
  the balance between the osteolytic activity of T-helper type-17 (Th17) lymphocytes
  and bone protective activity of T regulatory (Treg) lymphocytes controls the maintenance
  of bone tissue homeostasis. Th17 lymphocytes express the transcription factor retinoid
  acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor C2 (RORC2) and induce osteoclastogenesis
  and activation of mature osteoclasts by producing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α,
  interleukin (IL)-17A, and receptor-activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL).
  Treg lymphocytes express the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), overexpress
  the cell surface marker CD25, and inhibit osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity
  mainly by producing transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and IL-10. It is noteworthy
  that Foxp3+CD25high Treg lymphocytes can directly inhibit the differentiation, proliferation,
  and function of RORC2+ Th17 lymphocytes. Moreover, Foxp3+CD25high Treg lymphocytes
  can promote the production of Wnt10b by CD8+ T lymphocytes, which induces the differentiation
  of osteoblasts precursors through the Wnt-β-catenin-signaling pathway and consequently
  promotes bone formation (Created with BioRender.com).
