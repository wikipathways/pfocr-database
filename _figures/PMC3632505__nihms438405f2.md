caption: BTB restructuring is mediated in part by serine/threonine kinases belonging
  to the MAPK pathway, which transduces signals received from external stimuli (e.g.,
  cytokines and environmental toxicants). In general, the MAPK pathway branches into
  four cascades, leading to the activation of p38, ERK1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) or ERK5. Here, MAPKs are phosphorylated and activated by MAPKKs, which in
  turn are phosphorylated and activated by MAPKKs.
