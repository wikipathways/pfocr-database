caption: Signalling pathways at fertilization.In frog, ascidian and echinoderms, src
  family kinases (SFK) activate PLCγ to produce InsP3 and trigger the calcium waves
  (blue pathway); in sea urchin, there is good evidence that sperm-egg fusion is required
  for egg activation, but in frog this is less certain. In sea urchin, calcium activates
  nitric oxide production which generates cADPr via cGMP (blue pathway). In mammals,
  sperm-egg fusion introduces PLCζ into the egg cytoplasm, so producing InsP3 (yellow
  pathway). Sperm egg fusion may also introduce NAADP in echinoderms; NAADP activates
  plasma membrane calcium channels (red pathway). In ascidian, NAADP inactivates plasma
  membrane channels, while cADPr triggers local calcium release to trigger cortical
  granule exocytosis (red pathway).
