caption: Statin therapy for cancer. When statins enter cells and block HMG-CoA reductase
  activity, the mevalonate pathway end product, RhoA is depleted. Depression of RhoA
  can affect the stability of the cytoskeleton, further prevent the YAP entering cell
  nucleus, here, YAP will drive transcription of target genes with TEAD to promote
  the tumor tissue growth. At the same time, KRAS is another important downstream
  molecule in the mevalonate pathway, which can activate the MAPK signal to accelerate
  cell proliferation, thus restraining KRAS will delay cancer cell proliferation.
  In addition to the mevalonate pathway, statins could directly depress the AKT signal,
  effect the synthesis and degradation p21 and p27, at last block the cell cycle progression.
  Besides, statin can activate caspase-8, caspase-3 and caspase-9 to induce apoptosis,
  and suppress angiogenesis by inhibiting TNF-α.
