caption: Proposed mechanisms for the lipid-promoting effects of myoinositol (MI) in
  algal cells, (1) through stimulating the transcription of the responsive genes (e.g.,
  ACC) harboring inositol-sensitive upstream activating sequence (UASino) element
  in their promoters which could in turn positively impact FA synthesis (FAS), (2)
  through auxin-related responses, and (3) by increasing membrane negative charge
  regulated by phosphatidylinositol (PI).
