caption: Roles that dopamine receptors play in regulating inflammasome formation as
  well as NF-κB pathway. (A) Elevated cAMP, induced by D1 like receptors, directly
  binds to NLRP3, triggering the ubiquitination of NLRP3 NACHT and LRR domains with
  K48 ubiquitin chains by MARCH7, targeting NLRP3 to autophagy-mediated degradation.
  (B) β-arrestin2 recruited by D2R binds to NLRP3 to repress its activation. (C) D5R
  directly recruits TRAF6, ARRB2, TAK1, IKKs, and PP2A to form a multiprotein complex,
  impairing TRAF6-mediated activation of NF-κB. (D) Activated cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling
  inhibits p65/RelA and p50 activation as well as their DNA binding by delaying IKB-α
  degradation and competing for the KIX binding site on CREB binding protein. (E)
  D2R signaling increases the level of CRYAB, which combines with NF-κB p65, thus
  negatively regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. (F) D2R activation increases
  the expression of PPP2R2C, leading to PP2A and Akt dephosphorylation, and to the
  inhibition of the IKKα/IκBα/NF-κB signaling pathway.
