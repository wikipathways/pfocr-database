caption: (A) Neuropeptides released from nerve endings and receptors on GCs are illustrated.
  Solid black lines highlight confirmed findings, while blue dashed lines represent
  findings yet to be validated. (B) Cellular signal transduction during GC differentiation.
  Muc5ac is the structural gene governing GC differentiation, and SPDEF, FOXA3, FOXA2,
  FOXJ1, NFκB, and ERK act as its transcription factors. The Notch signalling pathway
  is responsible for the differentiation of cells into secretory cells under normal
  conditions, while EGFR, and IL-4R are involved in the regulation of GC metaplasia
  in allergic rhinitis. ACh, acetylcholine; CALCRL, calcitonin receptor-like receptor;
  CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GABA, gamma-aminobutyric
  acid; GC, goblet cell; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; M3, muscarinic acetylcholine
  type 3; NCX2 (SLC8A2), solute carrier family 8 member A2; NKA, neurokinin A; NK1R,
  neurokinin 1R; RAMP1, receptor activity-modifying protein 1; SP, substance P; TRP,
  transient receptor potential vanilloid 1; VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide. EGFR,
  epidermal growth factor receptor; FOXA2, forkhead box protein A2; GABA A, gamma-aminobutyric
  acid type A; GC, goblet cell; IL-13, interleukin 13; LEF-1, lymphoid enhancer-binding
  factor 1; MUC5AC, mucin 5AC; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; SPDEF, SAM-pointed
  domain containing ETS-like factor; STAT6, signal transducer and activator of transcription
