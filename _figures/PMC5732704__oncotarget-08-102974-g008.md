caption: 'LPS triggers the activation of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway and promotes
  the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. AKG supplementation facilitates intracellular
  AKG metabolism with concomitant absorption and transport of intestinal nutrient,
  which co-administrate to enhance the expression of ODGH in the TCA cycle and generate
  large amounts of ATP for maintaining gut homeostasis. Thus AKG could reverse the
  adverse effects induced by LPS and inhibit the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway
  activity, which then would directly or indirectly enhance PXR signal, although AKG
  is not a known PXR ligand. One potential mechanism for the up-regulation of the
  PXR-regulated detoxification pathway is through the down-regulation of NF-κB pathway
  by AKG interaction which in turn de-represses the PXR-associated gene and protein
  expression, thereby improving intestinal immunity. ER: endoplasmic reticulum.'
