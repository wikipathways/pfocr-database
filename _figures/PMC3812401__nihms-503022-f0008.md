caption: The indirect pathway is dependent on adipogenesis, which includes not only
  the role of PPARγ in the allocation of stem cells, but also the potential negative
  regulation derived from adipocytes. The direct mechanism is independent on adipogenesis.
  The endogenous PPARγ in osteoblasts strongly inhibits the mTOR activity, thus inhibiting
  Runx2/Osteocalcin mediated osteoblastic differentiation.
