caption: Schematic diagram depicting the role of HFHS diet in female reproductive
  disorders. Proposed working model of HFHS diet-induced female reproductive and metabolic
  disorders. The HFHS diet induces heightened levels of serum testosterone, LH, and
  LH/FSH ratio, as well as an increase in ovarian antral follicles and irregular estrous
  cycles in female mice. Mechanistically, the HFHS diet disrupts the steroid hormone
  biosynthesis, glucolipid metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis pathways in the ovary.
  Furthermore, metabolic dysfunctions, including adiposity, hyperglycemia, and insulin
  resistance, are observed in HFHS mice. Collectively, these reproductive and metabolic
  abnormalities contribute to the onset of polycystic ovary syndrome
