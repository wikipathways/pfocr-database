caption: A summarization of metabolic reprogramming or altered metabolic events in
  renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene VHL through
  deletion or mutation is a key factor for the metabolic reprogramming in RCC cells.
  Loss of VHL leads to the deregulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family
  of transcription factors and other oncogenic signaling events, including the hyperactivation
  of Ras-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT–mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  pathway(s); they contribute to the reprogramming of multiple metabolic events in
  renal cancer cells. In RCC cells, upregulation of glucose transporters (GLUT or
  SGLT) increase glucose uptake and is catabolized through an elevated aerobic glycolysis
  (Warburg effect) and lactate fermentation. The upregulated pentose phosphate pathway
  provides reducing equivalents (NADPH) to inhibit the oxidative stress and ribose
  precursors for nucleotide synthesis needed for the rapidly growing cells. Increased
  efflux of lactate contributes to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The
  TCA cycle is downregulated in renal cancer cells due to lower conversion rate of
  pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and suppression of intermediates like fumarate and α-ketoglutarate.
  In RCC, lipid synthesis predominates over lipid degradation. The β-oxidation pathway
  of lipids is downregulated and contains the levels of acetyl-CoA to feed the TCA
  cycle. However, the synthesis of carnitine, fatty acids, phospholipids and cholesterol
  are upregulated in RCC. Urea cycle is downregulated in renal cancer cells which
  decreases the catabolism of amino acids like arginine and glutamine. The RCC cells
  take up increased amounts of glutamine for the synthesis of fatty acids through
  reductive carboxylation. The elevated glutamine in RCC also adds to the upregulated
  glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) pathway to neutralize the oxidative
  stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Metabolism of the amino acid tryptophan
  through the kynurenine (KN) pathway is upregulated to generate an elevated level
  of immunosuppressants like kynurenine and quinolinate. Thus, reprogramming of metabolic
  pathways produces energy (ATP) and other molecules like lipids, phospholipids and
  ribose sugars essential for cellular proliferation and enables renal cancer cells
  to endure hypoxia, nutrient exhaustion and oxidative stress, as well as evade the
  immune system for survival.
