caption: Key nutrient metabolic pathways involved in lipid synthesis. Acetyl-CoA metabolism
  and TCA cycle take place in the mitochondrion (dashed lines); the other pathways
  take place in the cytosol (solid lines). The conversion of glucose to triglycerides
  involves three different pathways. Ingestion of glucose first activates the glycolytic
  pathway that produces pyruvate from glucose. Second, through several enzymatic steps,
  pyruvate is then converted into acetyl-CoA. To synthesize fatty acids de novo acetyl-CoA
  is then carboxylated to malonyl CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a substrate
  used by the multidomain enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) to form fatty acids through
  a multistep process. Third, these fatty acids are the raw materials used in the
  formation of more complex glycerolipids, such as membrane and storage lipids. Sampled
  genes from pathways other than carbohydrate, fatty acid, and glycerolipid metabolism
  include AMP activating protein kinase (ampk), cGMP-dependent protein kinase (pkg),
  and lipid storage droplet-2 (lsd2). Underneath each gene abbreviation, two blocks
  indicate fold changes between sugar-fed and starved females for the short-term (hours,
  left block) and long-term treatment (days, right block). Green indicates a gene
  is down-regulated; red signifies up-regulation. A list explaining abbreviations
  can be found in .
