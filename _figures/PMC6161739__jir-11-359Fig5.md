caption: 'Current model of NLRP3 subcellular localization during its activation process.Notes:
  Primed NLRP3 is both cytosolic and associated with endoplasmic reticulum (eR). Upon
  activation, NLRP3 is recruited to mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) by
  co-migration with MARK4 along microtubules (1). NLRP3 is stabilized in the MAMs
  through its interaction with cardiolipin, MAVS, cFLIPL, Mfn 2, and oxidized mtDNA
  at the surface of the mitochondria (2). Upon NLRP3 activation, ASC relocates from
  the nucleus to the mitochondria network (3), which approaches the ER in a microtubule-dependent
  manner (4). NLRP3 associates with ASC in the MAMs (5). Phosphorylation of NLRP3
  by Golgi-associated PKD leads to the release of NLRP3/ASC complex from the MAMs
  (6) and assembly of a single speck at the centrosome (7). Autophagy dampens inflammation
  by targeting the inflammasome (8), while release of ASC speck from pyroptotic cells
  propagates the inflammatory signal to neighboring cells (9).Abbreviations: MAVS,
  mitochondrial antiviral signaling; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; ASC, apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a CARD domain; PKD, protein kinase D; mtDNA, mitochondrial
  DNA; GSDMD, gasdermin-D.'
