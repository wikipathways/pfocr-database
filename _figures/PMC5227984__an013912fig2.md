caption: The sorbitol pathway as an intracellular source, and dietary sources of fructose
  and AGEs. Question marks indicate areas in which our knowledge or evidence is scant.
  Dietary fructose is mainly kept at the liver at first pass; therefore, the role
  of circulating fructose in AGE formation is questionable. AGE, advanced glycation
  end product; Fru-AGE, fructose-advanced glycation end product; GI, gastrointestinal;
  G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate.
