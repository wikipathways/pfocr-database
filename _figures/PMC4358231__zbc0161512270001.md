caption: The core enzyme set in FASII. The AccABCD enzyme complex converts acetyl-CoA
  into malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (FabD) converts malonyl-CoA into
  malonyl-ACP. The β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH) initiates fatty acid synthesis
  by condensing malonyl-ACP with either 2-methylbutyryl-CoA for branched-chain anteiso
  fatty acid synthesis or acetyl-CoA for straight-chain fatty acid synthesis to make
  β-ketoacyl-ACP. The β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG) reduces β-ketoacyl-ACP to make
  β-hydroxyacyl-ACP. The β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (FabZ) dehydrates β-hydroxyacyl-ACP
  into trans-2-enoyl-ACP. The enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) reduces trans-2-enoyl-ACP
  into acyl-ACP. Acyl-ACP of the appropriate length can be used for phospholipid biosynthesis,
  whereas β-hydroxyacyl-ACP of the proper length is used for lipopolysaccharide synthesis
  in Gram-negative bacteria. The figure lists the multiple isoforms of several of
  these core enzymes that are expressed by different bacteria. The branch points in
  the pathway for unsaturated fatty acid synthesis are not illustrated. Please refer
  to a recent review for detailed information on the organism-specific nuances in
  the operation of FASII ().
