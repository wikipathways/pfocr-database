caption: JNK signaling in the stem cell niche. (A) HMGB1 released from activated astrocytes
  stimulates the RAGE-JNK pathway and promotes the proliferation of NSCs. (B) Embryonic
  HSCs stimulate endothelial cells with Tgf-β1 to encourage glucose production and
  HSC emergence via activating the Jnk–C-jun signaling pathway. (C) JNK signaling
  contributes to myeloid cell function in the CSC niche. JNK-deficient myeloid cells
  in the liver exhibit reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6,
  and TNF-α), which promote CSC stemness. (D) JNK signaling in breast cancer mediates
  ECM production. The JNK–C-JUN pathway, stimulated by cytotoxic stress, upregulates
  gene expression in the ECM, wound healing, and stem cells and promotes the production
  of matricellular proteins such as osteopontin and tenascin C, encoded by SPP1 and
  TNC, respectively. These proteins activate angiogenesis and further ECM production
  in the CSC niche and subsequently promote metastasis and chemoresistance.
