caption: 'A proposed model. In youthful environment, sex steroid hormones controlled
  by the HPG axis transcriptionally induce the expression of Tfeb in muscle stem cells
  (MuSCs). Tfeb drives the expression of the entire network of genes that contain
  the coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) motif in their promoters.
  Accordingly, the autophagy–lysosome pathway maintains stemness and quiescence of
  MuSCs. However, at early stage, decreased sex hormone signalling by functional decline
  of the HPG axis at old age or inhibition of GnRH results in decrease of Tfeb and
  autophagy and lysosomal genes, which leads to impaired autophagosome clearance and
  accumulation of bulk autophagy substrates (LC3, p62/Ub) and ROS. At late stage,
  the gradual increase of ROS by prolonged decrease of the HPG axis reaches the level
  similar to that of geriatric MuSCs and then eventually provokes entry into senescence,
  which is relevant to an organism''s normal aging process: impaired autophagy clearance
  at an early stage and then cellular senescence at the late stage. Importantly, Tfeb
  overexpression in geriatric or sex hormone signalling‐disrupted MuSCs rescues impaired
  autophagy–lysosome system and reverts MuSC function. Therefore, the HPG‐Tfeb axis
  would be a key contributor to the aging of MuSCs. HPG, hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal.'
