caption: Function of nuclear and cytoplasmic Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional
  coactivator with a PDZ-binding domain (TAZ). (A) Transcriptional coactivation. Nuclear
  YAP and TAZ bind to transcription factors (TFs) and recruit the NCOA6 methyltransferase
  complex as well as the BRM-containing SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, which
  mediates TF target-specific gene transcription. (B) miRNA processing. Nuclear YAP
  inhibits DDX17, a regulatory component of the microprocessor complex. This nuclear
  inhibition decreases global miRNA on YAP stimulation. Of note, some specific miRNAs
  are upregulated on YAP nuclear activation. (C) Wnt signaling. Cytoplasmic YAP and
  TAZ sequester β-catenin and in some instances recruit β-TrCP to the destruction
  complex. This leads to nuclear β-catenin downregulation and therefore dampens Wnt
  signaling. Cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ also negatively regulate Wnt signaling by sequestering
  β-catenin and disheveled (DVL). YAP and TAZ dictate nuclear and cytoplasmic localization
  of SHP2 and therefore its function. This feeds into the Wnt signaling pathway because
  nuclear SHP2 dephosphorylates parafibromin (CDC73), which leads to increased β-catenin
  transcriptional activity. (D) Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)/BMP–SMAD signal.
  Cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ sequester SMAD2/3 in the cytoplasm and therefore inhibit
  SMAD2/3-mediated signaling, although these mechanisms seem not to be universal and
  somewhat controversial. Nuclear YAP activates SMAD1-mediated transcription.
