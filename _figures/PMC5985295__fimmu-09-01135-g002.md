caption: 'IFN-dependent and -independent ISG transcription mediated by complexes comprised
  unphosphorylated STATs. In addition to the classical IFN signaling pathway based
  on complexes of phosphorylated STAT proteins (early response—details Figure ), evidence
  exists for the involvement of unphosphorylated versions of ISGF3 (U-ISGF3), GAF
  (U-STAT1), and STAT2/IRF9 (U-STAT2/IRF9), in maintaining basal expression of certain
  ISGs in unstimulated cells (IFN independent). In addition, these unphosphorylated
  complexes are instrumental in sustaining expression of ISGs in response to long-term
  IFN-I or IFN-II stimulation (IFN dependent), when the level of phosphorylated STAT
  proteins is decreasing, but de novo synthesized unphosphorylated STAT proteins accumulate
  and can be incorporated in unphosphorylated transcription factors (late response).
  Abbreviations: IFN, interferon; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  IRF, interferon regulatory factor; JAK, Janus kinase; TYK, tyrosine kinase; ISGF3,
  interferon-stimulated gene factor 3; GAF, γ-activated factor; ISRE, interferon-stimulated
  response element; GAS, γ-activated sequence; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; P,
  phosphate; U, unphosphorylated form.'
