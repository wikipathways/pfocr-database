caption: Canonical Notch signaling pathway. The Notch pathway is an evolutionarily
  conserved intercellular signaling mechanism implicated in cell fate determination
  and differentiation of endothelial cells. Notch signaling begins with receptor–ligand
  interaction between neighboring cells. This interaction triggers a series of proteolytic
  cleavages of the Notch receptor. The final one, catalyzed by the γ-secretase complex,
  releases the active Notch intercellular domain (NICD) from the cell membrane. NICD
  is translocated to the nucleus, where it interacts directly with the transcription
  factor CSL. Following binding of NICD to CSL, the repressor complex is converted
  into an activating complex by displacing corepressors and recruiting coactivators.
  After the coactivator complex is recruited, the transcription of promoters that
  contains CSL-binding elements is induced. Hairy/enhancer of split (HES) and HES-related
  proteins (HEY/HRT/HERP) family genes are included among the target genes of Notch
  signaling. Dll4 ligand is also a target gene regulated by the Notch signaling pathway.
