caption: Proposed model for oestradiol (E2) regulation of the testicular AMH production
  in Sertoli cells. E2 upregulates AMH transcription mainly through nuclear oestrogen
  receptor α (ERα) binding to a specific oestrogen response element (ERE) on the AMH
  promoter, located 1,782 bp upstream of the translational start site. More modestly,
  GPER activation also upregulates AMH expression. The increased AMH expression results
  in a higher testicular AMH production. Another potential mechanism, not studied
  in this work, which could increase testicular AMH production is the increase in
  Sertoli cell proliferation induced by membrane-bound ERα, signalling through the
  PI3K/Akt pathway, and/or GPER, through MAPK signalling (dotted lines).
