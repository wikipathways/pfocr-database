caption: Proposed mechanisms for PDE inhibitor-induced cytoprotection against myocardial
  ischemia-reperfusion injury. PDE5 inhibitors increase cGMP content, which activates
  PKG. PKG can subsequently activate mitoKATP channel and prevent the loss of ionic
  gradients in the necrotic pathway of ischemia/reperfusion injury. PDE5 inhibitors
  simultaneously initiate a signaling cascade involving PKC and ERK, leading to phosphorylation/induction
  of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and release of nitric oxide (NO). This pathway also
  leads to opening of mitoKATP channel. Alternatively, PDE3, and PDE4 inhibitors may
  increase the activity of PKA leading to phosphorylation of eNOS and p38 MAPK. p38
  MAPK activation may potentially result in translocation of 27 kDa heat shock protein
  (Hsp27) to the Z-disc, an event that may to stabilize the cytoskeleton and contractile
  fibers.
