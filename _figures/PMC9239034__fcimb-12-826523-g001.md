caption: Diagram of the constructed network. The network diagram was constructed using
  the yEd Graph Editor according to the mEPN notation, described by , using the information
  obtained from the search carried out in the literature. The components (genes) in
  the IL-17 gene regulatory network (GRN) are represented by rectangles connected
  by arrows that indicate the molecular interactions found during the literature review
  step. System start nodes (transcription factors) are represented by colored rectangles
  in black. The GRN output signal is represented in the rectangle on the right side
  of the diagram.
