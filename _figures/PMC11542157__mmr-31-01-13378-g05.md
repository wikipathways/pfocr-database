caption: CMA dysfunction contributes to multiple diseases. In lung diseases, exposure
  to cigarette smoke extract is known to induce an increase in the UPR in human bronchial
  epithelial cells, thereby promoting apoptosis and ultimately contributing to the
  development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Overexpression of LAMP2A has
  been shown to mitigate this UPR and can potentially reverse apoptosis. CMA enables
  the degradation of N-CoR, a factor that is associated with MCL1 errors, thereby
  promoting the survival of NSCLC cells. Macrophages are presumed to be the primary
  cell type expressing CMA markers in cardiovascular diseases. A reduction in CMA
  activity leads to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, subsequently
  promoting IL-1β secretion, vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis progression.
  Furthermore, CMA is instrumental in the functionality and metabolism of new blood
  vessels. Chronic HCV infection markedly increases the risk of hepatic steatosis.
  Co-culturing HCV with free fatty acids leads to downregulation of IFNAR1, subsequently
  inhibiting the antiviral activity of IFN-α and inducing hepatic steatosis. IFNAR1
  is capable of colocalizing with LAMP2A for degradation through CMA. Activation of
  CMA results in the degradation of beclin 1, thereby inhibiting the endocytosis of
  EGFR and subsequently activating EGFR signaling. This causes autophagosome-lysosome
  damage and the activation of downstream carcinogenic signaling pathways such as
  RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, eventually leading to the growth of cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma.
  Various forms of nephropathy are associated with abnormally high levels of lys-HSC70,
  and CMA upregulates toxic modifications in renal tubular cells in response to α2-microglobulin.
  Decreased activity of LAMP2A leads to increased expression of the nuclear transcription
  factor Pax2, thereby upregulating the proliferation of renal tubular cells and promoting
  hypertrophy. Macrophages are presumed to be the primary cell type expressing CMA
  markers in cardiovascular diseases. A reduction in CMA activity leads to the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, subsequently promoting IL-1β secretion,
