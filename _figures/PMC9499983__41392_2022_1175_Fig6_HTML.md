caption: RNA modifications and immune cells in diverse cancers. RNA modifications,
  especially m6A modification, mainly play a positive role in regulating immune function
  in various cancers as illustrated in the figure. In melanoma and lung cancer, FTO-mediated
  m6A demethylation in tumor cells elevates the transcription factors c-Jun, JunB,
  and C/EBPβ, allowing the rewiring of glycolytic metabolism, thereby restricting
  the function of CD8+ T cells and inhibiting tumor growth. Besides, ablation of Mettl3
  in myeloid cells promotes tumor growth and metastasis via impairing the YTHDF1-mediated
  translation of SPRED2, which enhances the activation of NF-kB and STAT3 through
  the ERK pathway, thereby increasing M1/M2-like tumor-associated macrophage and regulatory
  T cell infiltration into tumors. In melanoma, upregulation of YTHDF2 in NK cells
  promotes NK cell effector function and is required for IL-15–mediated NK cell survival
  and proliferation by targeting Tardbp. In melanoma and colorectal carcinoma, loss
  of YTHDF1 in classical DCs enhanced the cross-presentation of tumor antigens and
  the cross-priming of CD8+ T cells via increasing the m6A sites on transcripts encoding
  lysosomal proteases recognized by YTHDF1, which could be written by METTL14. In
  colorectal carcinoma, Mettl3- or Mettl14-deficient macrophages showed faster tumor
  growth via slowing down the degradation of Irakm, encoding a negative regulator
  of TLR4 signaling, or driving CD8+ T cells to dysfunctional ones by directly targeting
  Ebi3, respectively. Moreover, elevation of METTL14 in colorectal cancer cells promotes
  the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells via exosomes included miR-149-3p.
  In Thyroid carcinoma, METTL3 reduction in PTC cells recruits tumor-associated neutrophils
  into tumor tissue through IL-8, thereby further promoting tumor development, while
  in ovarian carcinoma, depletion of METTL3 in NK cells inhibits cell infiltration
  ability and function, leading to accelerated tumor development via reducing SHP-2
  expression as well as the activation of AKT and MAPK signaling pathway. In multiple
  myeloma, upregulation of the demethylase FTO in plasma cells plays a tumor-promoting
  and pro-metastatic role in MM by targeting HSF1 which could be recognized by YTHDF2.
  In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, LncRNA-PACERR increased the number of M2-polarized
  cells and facilized cell proliferation, invasion and migration via binding to IGF2BP2
  to enhance the stability of KLF12 and c-myc, thereby activating KLF12/p-AKT/c-myc
  pathway through binding to miR-671-3p. Extensive bioinformatics analysis revealed
  the potential key roles of RNA modifications other than m6A modification in immune
  cell infiltration in diverse types of tumors. DC dendric cell, NK T cell natural
