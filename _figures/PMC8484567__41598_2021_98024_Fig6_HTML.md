caption: Transcription factors and associated genes of signaling pathways during the
  immune response. The TFs and genes shown are associated with differences in DEGs
  between early and late responses to infection. DEGs and their magnitudes are shown
  on the right for TP3, TP4, and TP5, with columns for each of Mm and Mf. Red dots
  signify up-regulation and blue dots down-regulation. In addition to DEGs at TP4
  and TP5, the RIG1/MDA5-mediated PRR signaling pathway is included, as it is significantly
  different at TP3. IRF7-regulated genes expressed by ISRE also show significant changes.
  Finally, NFκB signaling, mediated by REL and RELA, plays a crucial role in controlling
  inflammation, and the ongoing strongly differential expression of the corresponding
  genes (ISRE- and GAS-regulated) at TP5 in Mm suggests a prolonged inflammatory response.
