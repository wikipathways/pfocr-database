caption: Other pathways. Aspirin/Salicylic has been shown to modulate a variety of
  signaling pathways which may also contribute to its anti-cancer effects. It is known
  to inhibit nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway, activate the adenosine monophosphate
  activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
  cause degradation of c-myc mRNA and proteins, and acetylate p53 leading to induction
  of p21 and Bax protein expression, to name a few. See text for details; additional
  pathways described in the text are not depicted in this figure. -P, phosphorylated
  protein; -Ac, acetylated protein.
