caption: Loss of DR6 rescues injured distal axons from axon degeneration indicating
  an essential role for DR6 in Wallerian degeneration. The signaling pathway leading
  to axon degeneration after injury involves activation of Sarm1, a drop in NAD+ levels
  and subsequent activation JNK and Calpain. Our in vitro and in vivo results indicate
  that after injury, DR6 acts as a receptor that leads to downstream activation of
  JNK.
