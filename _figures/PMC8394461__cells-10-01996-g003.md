caption: ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5) and ABRE BINDING FACTORs/ABRE-BINDING PROTEINs (ABFs/AREBs)
  function in feedback regulation of abscisic acid (ABA) pathway in Arabidopsis. In
  the presence of ABA, ABA receptors PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE PROTEINS/PYR-LIKE PROTEINS/REGULATORY
  COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORs (PYR/PYL/RCARs) bind and inhibit phosphatases PHOSPHATASE
  2Cs (PP2Cs), what in turn activates kinases, SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 2s (SnRK2s).
  SnRK2s phosphorylate and activate ABI5 and ABFs/AREBs. Phosphatases PP2Cs, when
  not bound with ABA receptors PYR/PYL/RCAR, inhibit SnRK2s activity and thus ABI5
  and ABFs/AREBs function. ABI5 is able to promote expression of PYL11 and PYL12 genes,
  which in turn strengthen ABA perception through PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. ABF1 and
  ABF4/AREB2 trigger ABF2/AREB1 expression. On the other side, ABI5 and ABFs/AREBs
  activate expression of ABI1 and ABI2, genes encoding PP2Cs, which inhibits activity
  of SnRK2. Furthermore, ABF4/AREB2 promotes FYVE DOMAIN PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR ENDOSOMAL
  SORTING 1 (FYVE1) expression. FYVE1 positively regulates degradation of PYR/PYL/RCARs
  and diminishes ABF4/AREB2 and ABI5 activity. Inhibition of ABF4/AREB2 and ABI5 activity
  by FYVE1 is possible after its phosphorylation carried out by SnRK2s. P—phosphate
  group.
