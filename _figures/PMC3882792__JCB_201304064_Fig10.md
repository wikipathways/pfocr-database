caption: 'Scheme of Dbl3 function. A schematic drawing of an epithelial cell along
  with the processes regulated by Dbl3: apical differentiation, apical domain size,
  brush border biogenesis, apical lateral border positioning, and lateral compression.
  Labeled is also the vertebrate marginal zone immediately apical to the tight junction.
  Indicated is how Dbl3 is recruited to the apical membrane by ezrin where it becomes
  enriched at the marginal zone. Dbl3 then activates Cdc42, resulting in stimulation
  of the Par–Par6–aPKC pathway in a process-specific manner that leads to phosphorylation
  of Par3 and retention at tight junctions while Par6 and aPKC segregate into the
  expanding apical membrane.'
