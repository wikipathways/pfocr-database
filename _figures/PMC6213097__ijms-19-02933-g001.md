caption: Cellular energy fluxes and transport routes in the context of the current
  review. In permeabilized cells cytosolic water-soluble liquid components and freely
  floating proteins are washed out but most of the ATPases and enzymes attached to
  cytoskeleton or other structures remain active. The movement of the adenine nucleotides
  through mitochondrial outer membrane (OMM) voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC)
  may be restricted by specific protein complex (X). However, the cytosolic creatine
  kinase (CK) isoforms coupled with ATPase and mitochondrial CK and adenylate kinase
  (AK) cytosolic isoform AK1 and mitochondrial AK2 create an opportunity for energy
  transport without ADP and ATP free diffusion in the cytoplasm. In these energy-transfer
  networks ADP generated in ATPase reactions and ATP produced in mitochondria are
  quickly directed to CK and AK reactions. Therefore, adding CK and AK activating
  compounds (creatine (Cr) or AMP, respectively) is also reflected in the rate of
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In the case of the AK shuttle the AMP derived
  from AK (AK1) reactions in the cytoplasm enters to the IMS where AK2 converts AMP
  and ATP to ADP. In addition to speed up the movement of the energy-rich phosphoryl
  group in cytoplasm, these energy transport systems provide better feedback between
  ATP consumption and synthesis. Addition of pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenol
  pyruvate (PEP) to medium traps ADP that is not attached to energy transport systems.
  Therefore, in the presence of PK-PEP system and without activation of the CK or
  AK pathway the rate of OXPHOS decreases. Hexokinase (HK) bound to VDAC directs mitochondrial
  ATP to glycolysis pathway and remained ADP can stimulate OXPHOS. Adenine nucleotide
  translocase (ANT) is situated in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). IMS, mitochondrial
  intermembrane space.
