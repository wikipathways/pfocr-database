caption: The physiological effects of KYN pathway metabolites. (a) AA can form complexes
  with Fe2+, downregulating ROS levels, and exhibiting antioxidant activity; XA exerts
  antioxidant effects by binding to heme and iron (Fe) chelators; XA facilitates neural
  signal transmission in the brain by activating cation channels mediated by GPCR
  and increasing intra-cellular Ca2+ concentrations. (b) In NK cells, KYN promotes
  the increase in cytochrome C and caspase-3, inducing elevated free radical levels,
  and leading to cell death. (c) In intestinal epithelial cells, KYNA activates GPR35
  and AhR receptors, promoting increased IL-22 levels. (d) In the stomach, helicobacter
  pylori activates the cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3 signaling pathway, promoting XA production,
  and leading to gastric metaplasia. (e) 3-HK auto-oxidizes to produce H2O2, which
  is further derived into α-Syn, binding to Aβ and complexing with metal ions, causing
  cell death. (f) CA activates AhR receptors and STC2 signaling, providing a protective
  effect on cells. (g) In microglia, QA activates NMDA receptors and promotes Glu
  release. In astrocytes, KYNA acts as an antagonist of α7nAChRs and NMDA receptors,
  thereby mitigating the effects of QA. (h) 3-HAA disrupts DNA structure by chelating
  metal ions. (i) Under INF-γ stimulation, PA can control cells in the G1 phase; PA
  activates microglia and astrocytes, promoting increased MIP-1α/1β levels, exhibiting
  antiviral effects; PA enhances the action of antibacterial drugs in macrophages
  by chelating metal ions. KYN, kynurenine; KYNA, kynurenic acid; AA, anthranilic
