caption: Mechanisms of action of decanoic acid identified in D. discoideum. (A) Decanoic
  acid regulates the phosphoinositide pathway by decreasing phosphatidylinositol phosphate
  (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol diphosphate (PIP2) concentrations; (B) increased
  diacylglycerol (DAG) levels through the inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase A (DGKA);
  and (C) reduced the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
  independent from glucose and insulin level through the inhibition of p97, an mTORC1
  activator, with a range of downstream effectors including autophagy. This figure
