caption: 'Four-compartment metabolic model compromising the blood, glutamatergic neurons,
  GABAergic neurons and astroglia. Glucose enters the brain with the aid of glucose
  transporter in the blood-brain barrier. In the glycolytic pathway, glucose is broken
  down into two pyruvate molecules which enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
  Acetate only enters the astroglial compartment and enters the TCA cycle via acetyl-CoA.
  One of the TCA cycle intermediates, 2-oxoglutarate, is in rapid exchange with a
  large glutamate pool that can be observed with NMR. The TCA cycle flux can be obtained
  from the glutamate turnover and is denoted VTCA. Due to compartmental localization
  of specific enzymes, the fate of glutamate differs in each of the three cellular
  compartments. In glutamatergic neurons, glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter
  and is released into the synaptic cleft in response to an action potential. Following
  interaction with post-synaptic receptors, the glutamate is taken up by the astroglia
  and converted to glutamine. Glutamine is ultimately transported back to the glutamatergic
  neuron, where it is converted back to glutamate, thereby completing the so-called
  glutamate-glutamine neurotransmitter cycle. The flux through this cycle, Vcycle,
  Glu/Gln, can be obtained by following the glutamine turnover. In the GABAergic neuron,
  the glutamate is first converted to GABA which is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter.
  Similar to the glutamatergic neuron, a GABA-glutamine neurotransmitter exists between
  GABAergic neurons and astroglia. A metabolic pathway specific to astroglia is the
  carboxylation of pyruvate catalyzed by the astroglia-specific enzyme pyruvate carboxylase.
  Note that the letter size roughly corresponds to the metabolic pool size of the
  corresponding metabolite (e.g. a large glutamine pool resides in astroglia). Metabolite
  abbreviations are given for: Ace, acetate; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; Glc, glucose;
  Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate'
