caption: The sorting mechanism of exosomal miRNA MiRNA genes are transcribed into
  primary miRNAs (pri-miRNA) by Pol-II. Then with the catalytic action of DGCR8 and
  Drosha complex, pri-RNA are transmitted into pre-miRNA, which are exported out of
  the nucleus by exportin5 complex. In the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNAs are digested
  by the Dicer complex into double-stranded miRNAs, which turn to be single-stranded
  ones, mature miRNAs, in the next step by Helicase. Mature miRNAs are sorted into
  exosomes via four potential modes: a the miRISC-related pathway; b nSMase2-dependent
  pathway; c miRNA motif and sumoylated hnRNPs-dependent pathway; d 3’miRNA sequence-dependent
  pathway. e Knockdown of Rab27 or their effectors, SYTL4 and EXPH5, could inhibit
  secretion of exosomes in HeLa cells. f Both the tumor repressor protein p53 and
  its downstream effector TSAP6 could enhance exosome production
