caption: 'The classical and alternative pathways of NF-KB signalling are mediated
  by a variety of receptors and signalling molecules, including TLR, CD30L, CD40L,
  RANKL, etc.; persistent EBV infection can also activate this pathway. In the classical
  NF-KB pathway, IKB binds to the P50-P65 heterodimer in the cytoplasm, preventing
  its entry into the nucleus. When receptor activation initiates adaptor proteins
  and signalling kinase responses, this will lead to activation of the IKB kinase
  complex(IKK), which phosphorylates IKB and leads to polyubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation. This allows P50-P65 to be released into the nucleus to induce gene
  expression. In the alternative pathway, IKKα is activated by the upstream kinase
  NF-KB inducible kinase (NIK), which promotes the processing of P100-RelB into P52-RelB.
  Abnormal activation of the NF-KB pathway in lymphoma: 1. In MALT, CARD11, MALT1
  and BCL10 are involved in the formation of the complex CBM, which is essential for
  the activation of NF-KB. 2. Meanwhile, overexpression of IAP2-MALT1 fusion proteins
  in MALT is also effective in activating NF-KB'
