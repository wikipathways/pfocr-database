caption: Schematic diagram of the potential role of NO in the heterosis of B. napus
  against salt stress at the proteomic and physiological levels. A rapid response
  of NO production catalyzed by NIA1/2 in hybrid is induced in response to salt stress.
  NO might control TCA cycle metabolism pathway, thus providing the energy and carbon
  skeleton for the protein synthesis related to chlorophyll and proline biosynthesis.
  Finally, salinity toxicity was alleviated. T bars, inhibition.
