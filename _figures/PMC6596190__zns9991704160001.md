caption: APP can be cleaved through amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic pathways. In
  the non-amyloidogenic pathway, α-secretase cleaves APP to form sAPPα and CTF83.
  In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by β-secretase (BACE1) at either the
  Glu11 site to form CTF89, resulting in a truncated form of Aβ, or the Asp1 site
  to make CTF99, which is cleaved by γ-secretase to form Aβ (gray). The Ala673 site
  of APP becomes the Ala2 site (red) of Aβ.
