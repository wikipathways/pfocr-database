caption: Neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways in PD pathogenesis. Free
  radicals can arise several diverse ways, such as glial cell activation, mitochondrial
  dysfunction and protein aggregation. Microglial derived NO and superoxide species
  react in extracellular spaces to form peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite readily crosses
  cell membranes where it contributes to lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and nitrotyrosine
  formation in α-synuclein and other cellular proteins. Damaged proteins are targeted
  to cellular proteosomes for degradation via the ubiquitination pathway. Excess NO
  produced by activated microglia can lead to S-nitrosylation of cellular proteins,
  including parkin. Such modifications may diminish E3 ubiquitin ligase activity necessary
  for efficient protein turnover by proteosomes. Excessive protein damage caused by
  oxidants and disruptions in the ubiquitin pathways may overload or inhibit protein
  degradation quality control measures leading to the accumulation of damaged proteins
  in cells. When reactive species exceed anti-oxidant defenses, oxidative stress is
  generated; destroying molecular structures, such as proteins, lipids and DNA, causing
  irreversible and detrimental damage, neuronal cell injury and death. Adapted from
  Gao et al. [].
