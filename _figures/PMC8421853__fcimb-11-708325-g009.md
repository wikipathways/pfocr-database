caption: Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) activity in fibrosis
  and inflammatory signaling. Depicted are the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways
  in which STAT3 plays a role. Arrows represent upregulation of a pathway, while blunt
  lines represent downregulation of a pathway. Cardiac inflammation is modulated by
  STAT3 via suppression of both nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and STAT1 pro-inflammatory
  signaling. Cardiac fibrosis signaling is promoted by STAT3 through transforming
  growth factor beta (TGF-β)/SMAD signaling. The image was created with the assistance
  of BioRender.
