  In the inactive state, the transmembrane protein receptor Ptch1 interacts with and
  inhibits the activity of a seven transmembrane protein, Smo. Interactions with cytoplasmic
  proteins, including Fused and Sufu, the transcription factors Gli are prevented

  cell apoptosis and proliferation, the second is Smo-dependent which associate with
