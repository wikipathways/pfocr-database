caption: The role of HSPs in regulating inflammation and immune responses. In dendritic
  cells (DCs), recombinant human HSPs, such as HSP60 and HSP72, can promote their
  maturation and can activate them to secrete the proinflammatory cytokines. Released
  or recombinant eHSPs can stimulate macrophages to secrete various cytokines, such
  as IL-1β, TNF-α, GM-CSF, and IL-12, while hsp60 can synergize with IFN-γ. Various
  eHSPs, such as eHSP90α, eHSP70, eHSP110, and eHSP27, can stimulate the macrophages
  to polarize toward to TAM-like macrophages that possess immunosuppressive and proangiogenic
  phenotypes, promoting the progression of cancer. Regarding monocytes, they can be
  activated by eHSP70 probably through two different signal transduction pathways,
  the one pathway dependent on intracellular calcium and CD14, causing monocytes to
  increase the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and the other pathway only dependent
  on intracellular calcium resulting in increased expression of TNF-α but not IL-1β
  or IL-6.
