caption: Proposed model of the AHR-1 signaling pathway in C. elegans response to pro-
  and antioxidants. In “normal” conditions (middle panel), AHR-1 is activated by intra-cellular
  ROS. This leads to the shedding of the chaperones from cytosolic AHR-1 and the subsequent
  nuclear translocation of AHR-1. In the nucleus, AHR-1 forms a heterodimer with the
  AHR nuclear translocator (AHA-1) and bind to XREs of target genes, which in turn
  leads to the reduction in intracellular ROS levels. In these conditions, loss of
  ahr-1 function leads to an increased lifespan. In the presence of antioxidants (left
  panel) the intra-cellular ROS concentrations are low leading to AHR-1 residing in
  the cytoplasm, bound by its cofactors. The inhibition of the basal AHR-1 activity
  leads to an increased lifespan. In the presence of pro-oxidants (right panel) AHR-1
  is activated by excessive ROS, which results its nuclear translocation, the AHR-1–AHA-1
  heterodimer formation and the initiation of target gene transcription. In the ahr-1
  KO, the decreased detoxification of ROS through AHR-1-induced target genes leads
  to an accumulation of ROS and renders the ahr-1 KO susceptible.
