caption: At least three extracellular and intracellular signaling molecules must be
  present to allow natural transformation to occur in V. cholerae. 1) Chitin degradation
  products such as chitin oligomers, which lead to the induction of the sRNA TfoR
  and the main regulator of transformation TfoX (chitin pathway shown in brown). 2)
  The secondary messenger cAMP, which has to accumulate within cells (CCR pathway
  shown in blue). 3) Extracellular autoinducers, with an emphasis on the stronger
  autoinducer CAI-1, which feed into the quorum-sensing circuit (shown in green).
  Whereas chitin- and TfoX-dependent induction and the requirement for cAMP and CRP
  are universal for all, so far investigated, competence genes, the QS-dependent circuit
  regulates only a subset of those, such as comEA and comEC. Therefore, QS acts as
  a switch in gene expression and is responsible for the final fate of the surrounding
  DNA (boxed areas). At a low cell density (LCD), the DNA (shown in purple) is degraded
  by the nuclease Dns. As a consequence, the cells are non-transformable. At a high
  cell density (HCD) and, therefore, high abundance of the autoinducer CAI-1, the
  nuclease gene dns is transcriptionally repressed, whereas comEA and comEC are activated.
  ComEA as well as ComEC then contribute to the DNA uptake process, probably due to
  their ability to shuffle the DNA through the periplasmic space and the inner membrane,
  respectively.
