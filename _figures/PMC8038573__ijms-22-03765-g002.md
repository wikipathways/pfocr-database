caption: 'Anti-angiogenic drugs can act as decoy agents, monoclonal antibodies, or
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Bevacizumab was the first anti-angiogenic drug approved
  for human use, however, its use as monotherapy is inefficient. Compensatory mechanisms
  of other angiogenic mediators induces a switch in the vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF)-dependent state to a VEGF-independent angiogenic process and leads
  to patient resistance to VEGF signaling pathway blockade. Nowadays, a new class
  of drugs, by blocking other effectors in angiogenic signaling pathways, try to improve
  the clinical efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapies. In some scenarios, the use of
  anti-angiogenic therapies delays the disease outcome of cancer patients, still other
  patients do not have any additional benefits. The major signaling pathways downstream
  of VEGFRs, FGFRs, PDGRs, and c-MET in endothelial cells (ECs) are PI3K-AKT-mTOR,
  Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK, and JAK-STATs, which are pivotal for EC survival, proliferation,
  and migration. AKT: Protein kinase B; ERK: Extracellular-signal-regulated kinase;
