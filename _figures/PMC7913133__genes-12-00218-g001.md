caption: Proposed PSY synthesis pathway and suggested enzymes involved in PSY processing.
  PSY genes are expressed in the nucleus as prepropeptides carrying a secretion signal
  peptide. The secretion signal is cleaved upon arrival in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), revealing the propeptide. The propeptide is received in the cis-Golgi where
  it undergoes post-translational modifications to become a precursor peptide. Prolyl-4-hydroxylases
  (P4H) catalyze hydroxylation of proline. Hydroxyproline O-Arabinosyltransferases
  (HPAT) catalyze the attachment of a L-Arabinose unit to one of the two hydroxyl
  groups. Reduced Residual Arabinose (RRA) and Xyloglucanase113 (XEG113) are proposed
  to attach the second and third arabinose unit, respectively. Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase
  (TPST) catalyzes the sulfation of the tyrosine residue. Before reaching the Trans-Golgi
  network, the precursor peptide is proteolytically processed to release the mature
  peptide. Subtilases (SBTs) and in particular SBT3.8 and SBT6.1 are suggested to
  be involved in PSY processing. The mature peptide is transported from the trans-Golgi
  to the cell membrane in vesicles, where it fuses with the membrane to secrete the
  mature peptide to the apoplast.
