caption: 'Virulence factors of Fusobacterium nucleatum. Fn has three main virulence
  factors: FadA, LPS, and Fap2. FadA binds E-cadherin, resulting in Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling that stimulates the transcription of cyclin D and c-Myc, resulting in
  the development and progression of pancreatic tumors. Fap2 interacts with the TIGIT
  receptor on NK and T-cells, inhibiting their ability to attack tumor cells. Fap2
  also binds to the Gal-GalNac polysaccharide expressed by tumor cells, which localized
  the Fn to tumor cells. Fn induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines by
  tumor cells and immune cells, creating a proinflammatory microenvironment. Fn binding
  of LPS to TRL-4/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway promotes chemoresistance.
  It activates the MYD88 innate immune signaling pathway, causing the loss of microRNAs
  miR-18a and miR-4802, up-regulating autophagy elements, and inhibiting cancer cell
  apoptosis by up-regulating baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat 3 (BIRC3).
