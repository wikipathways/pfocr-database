caption: 2–3% of glucose entering the cell is diverted from glycolysis into the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP). The end product of the HBP is UDP-GlcNAc, the high energy
  donor sugar used by OGT to transfer O-GlcNAc onto protein substrates. When OGA removes
  O-GlcNAc from proteins, GlcNAc can then by recycled through the GlcNAc salvage pathway
  which eventually converges with the HBP
papertitle: The post-translational modification O-GlcNAc is a sensor and regulator
  of metabolism
