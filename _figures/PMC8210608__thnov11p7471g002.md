caption: Immunotherapies combing with nanotechnology. The seven steps of the cancer-immunity
  cycle are simplified into four parts. To present which immune step is associated,
  the current developments of nano-immunotherapy are divided into these four parts.
  Nano-immunotherapies acting on preparatory stage include tumor antigen releasing
  and presenting (by ETAs, cancer vaccines, CD47 blockade therapy), and T cells priming
  and activation (by artificial APCs, restoring co-stimulatory signals, cytokines
  therapy). The functions of nano-immunotherapies acting on the effector stage are
  CTL trafficking and infiltration (through eliminating physical barriers and signal
  barriers), and CTL recognition and killing (through disrupting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway,
  CAR-T therapy and modulation the iTME). Besides, combination nano-immunotherapy
  consists of immunotherapies with different effects, making up for the deficiency
  of monotherapy in the immunity cycle.
