caption: miRNAs are a novel component of the starvation response. Stress-derived energy
  deficiency activates the SnRK1 protein kinase which leads to a major transcriptional
  reprogramming partly via transcription factors and partly via miRNAs. SnRK1 activity
  may impact miRNA function at several levels, including regulation of MIR promoter
  activity. Components of the miRNA pathway may also influence the SnRK1 transcriptome
  e.g., through changes in transcript stability. miRNAs contribute to SnRK1 signaling
  mainly through repression of gene expression, targeting TCPs and Hsp70-15, and possibly
  impacting major cellular processes like translation.
