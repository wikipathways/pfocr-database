caption: Bariatric surgery improves cardiovascular function via the miRNA-associated
  pathway. Weight loss surgery can prevent artery remodeling in three different ways
  and thereby improve cardiovascular function. First is downregulates miRNA-122 resulting
  in decreased levels of AMPK phosphorylation, which could lead to activate the AMPK
  signaling pathway of endothelial cells, result in an improvement of the endothelial
  function of patients; Next, directly reduces the LDL and total cholesterol content
  in plasma by downregulation of ADAM17 which could ameliorate atherosclerosis; Last
  is downregulates miR-21 resulting in the low expression of TGF-β, which could reduce
  the effect of the inhibition of VSMC apoptosis and the promotion of VSMC proliferation
  of miR-21.
