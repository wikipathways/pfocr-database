caption: The HIF pathway. (Left) Under normoxic conditions, PHD2 hydroxylates proline
  531 of HIF-2α, which can then be recognized by VHL, targeting it for ubiquitylation
  and degradation. (Right) Under hypoxic conditions, PHD2 cannot hydroxylate HIF α
  subunits, allowing it to be stabilized and translocate to the nucleus to dimerize
  with ARNT; the HIF-α-ARNT complex in the nucleus triggers transcriptional activation
  at hypoxia response elements (HREs).
