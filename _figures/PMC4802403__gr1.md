caption: Schematic representation of the mTOR pathway, it's classical upstream inputs
  and downstream targets.mTOR exists as two separate signalling complexes which are
  structurally distinct. mTOR complex 1, which is defined by raptor, receives signalling
  inputs from amino acids, ATP, insulin, growth factors and hormones, which all culminate
  in the initiation of multiple downstream signalling pathways. mTORC1 phosphorylates
  a limited number of known substrates, the principle ones being S6K1, 4EBP1, SREBP
  and GRB10. Activation of these mTORC1 targets culminates in the up regulation of
  anabolic processes and the down regulation of catabolic processes and mediates a
  negative feedback loop towards PI3K via S6K1. mTORC2, while not as throughly studied
  as mTORC1, is defined by raptor and is activated by PI3K signalling and acts downstream
  on Akt.
