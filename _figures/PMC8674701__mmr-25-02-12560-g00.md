caption: Common signal transduction and regulation of KOR. Activation of KOR leads
  to conformational changes and dissociation of the pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein
  subunits, activating G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels and
  inhibiting voltage-gated calcium ion channels. The α subunit binds GTP and dissociates
  from Gβγ. The GTP-binding protein α subunit inhibits the classical adenylyl cyclase/cyclic
  AMP/PKA pathway. Both Gα-GTP and free Gβγ can regulate secondary cascade activation.
  KOR activation also activates a β-arrestin-dependent signaling cascade. This interaction
  with scaffolding partners, such as β-arrestin, can be dependent or independent of
  receptor phosphorylation. KOR is phosphorylated in response to agonist occupation
  by multiple kinases, each of which has multiple isoforms. Phosphorylation by a particular
  kinase dictates secondary cascade interactions or subsequent receptor fate. Phosphorylation
  of KOR leads to internalization of the receptor, contributing to KOR agonist tolerance,
  response to agonist occupancy and subsequent signaling pathway activation, desensitization
  or degradation of the receptor. +, activation; -, blockade or inhibition; KOR, κ-opioid
  receptor; AC, adenylyl cyclase; cAMP, cyclic AMP; CREB, cAMP responsive element
