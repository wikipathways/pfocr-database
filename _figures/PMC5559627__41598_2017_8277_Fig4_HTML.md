caption: Metabolic pathways that generate various lactate isotopomers and isotopologues
  in cells, traced with [3-13C]glucose. In theory, when cells incubated with [3-13C]glucose,
  most glucose is converted to lactate directly through glycolysis, which results
  in equal amount of [1-13C]lactate that derived from glucose carbon 1, 2, 3 to lactate
  derived from glucose carbon 4, 5, 6. A fraction of glucose enters oxidative branch
  pentose phosphate pathway, cycles back to glycolysis through nonoxidative branch
  of pentose phosphate pathway, subsequently converts to lactate. Three major species,
  [1,2-13C2]lactate, [2-13C]lactate, and lactate, were generated from nonoxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway.
