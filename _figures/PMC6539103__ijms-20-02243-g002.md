caption: The potential roles of aberrant activations of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways
  in pathogenesis of PWS/SWS. Mutations in GNAQ, EphB4, RASA1, Tie2 and other genes,
  as well as co-expression of EphB1/EfnB2 lead to an activation of MAPK. Mutation
  in PIK3CA (G1049N) activates AKT/mTOR pathway. Overexpression of VEGF-A and VEGFR2
  can activate in MAPK and AKT/mTOR. Altogether, these factors lead to aberrant activations
  of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, thus result in cell proliferation, migration,
  survival, cytoskeletal arrangement and vasopermeability, eventually causing development
  of PWS/SWS. Some anti-angiogenesis compounds or antibodies that are under development
  or have been approved by FDA are listed in the figure for potential treatments of
  vascular malformations.
