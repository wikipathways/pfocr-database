caption: Fructose metabolism pathway. Fructose taken up by Glut2 or Glut5 is subsequently
  phosphorylated by ketohexokinase (KHK) into fructose-1-phosphate. Aldolase B then
  cleaves it to three carbon units, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), and glyceraldehyde.
  Glyceraldehyde becomes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P) to enter glycolysis or
  becomes glycerol-3-phosphate to provide the glycerol backbone of newly synthesized
  lipids (e.g., triglycerides).
