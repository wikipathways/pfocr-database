caption: Inflammasome NLRP3 initiates the cytokine cascade/storm using NF-kB pathway.
  (A) Direct stimulation of inflammasome NLRP3 is triggered by viral protein from
  SARS-CoV-2 through TLR 3 signalling. (B) Non-direct stimulation occurs through host-intrinsic
  mechanisms such as DAMPS - oxidation of phospolipids from alveolar epithelial/endothelial
  membranes, ROS, ATP, necrotic cells and pyroptosis. (C) NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  induces the production of mature IL-1β and IL-18 from inactive pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  precursors by caspase-1, which initiates a cytokine cascade. (D) The pro-inflammatory
  cytokines including L-6, IL-2, TNF-α, in turn stimulate production of IL-17 and
  IFN-γ which can activate the JAK-STAT or NF-κB signalling via binding to their receptors
  expressed on immune cells, to induce more production of pro-inflammatory genes,
  forming a positive feedback to trigger hyperinflammation and the threshold of cytokine
  storm. TLR3, Toll-Like Receptor 3; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3,
  DAMPs, Danger Associated Molecular Patterns; ROS, Reactive Oxygen Species; ATP,
  Adenosine Triphosphate; PLs, phospholipids; JAK-STAT, Janus kinase-signal transducer
  and activator of transcription.
