caption: Pathway analysis of sugar beet under salt stress. The proposed metabolic
  pathways are based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database
  of metabolic pathways. The metabolites, written in bold, were detected in this study.
  Omitted metabolic processes are represented by dashed lines. The small icons represent
  the genes, while the large icons represent the metabolites. The orange and red colors
  indicate upregulated expression on days 1 and 7, while the light blue and dark blue
  colors indicates downregulated expression on days 1 and 7, respectively
papertitle: Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal mechanisms of adaptation
  to salinity in which carbon and nitrogen metabolism is altered in sugar beet roots.
