caption: Schematic representation of the microbial aromatic degradation pathways involving
  protocatechuate, homogentisate, catechol and phenylacetate pathways. The catechol
  and protocatechuate pathways combine to form the β-ketoadipate pathway, which is
  preceded by the thiolase PcaF in the last step.
