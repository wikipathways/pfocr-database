caption: 'Mitophagy pathways. Turnover of mitochondria at the autophagosome (mitophagy)
  is required to maintain a healthy pool of mitochondria. Defects in mitophagy result
  in accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Two major pathways have been identified
  that regulate targeting of mitochondria to the autophagosome: (A) the Pink1/Parkin
  pathway in which activation of Pink1 kinase following mitochondrial depolarization
  leads to phosphorylation of Mitofusin by Pink1, that then acts as a receptor for
  Parkin. Recruitment of Parkin, a E3 ubiquitin ligase, results in ubiquitination
  of multiple mitochondrial substrates but how this leads to mitophagy is still a
  matter for debate, and possible explanations for how Parkin functions are highlighted
  in the inset box; (B) An alternative pathway involves the activity of BNIP3 and
  NIX, both of which are hypoxia inducible but also regulated by FoxOs, E2Fs, and
  p53. BNIP3 and NIX have both been shown to interact directly with processed LC3
  through a conserved LIR motif in their amino terminal ends. This interaction has
  been proposed to explain how BNIP3 and NIX target mitochondria to the autophagosome.
  Both BNIP3 and NIX are also known to interact with Rheb, and with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL but
  the significance of these interactions for mitophagy are not clear.'
