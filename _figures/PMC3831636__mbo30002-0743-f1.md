caption: Base-analog sensitivity of Escherichia coli deficient in Moco biosynthesis,
  previously described Moco-dependent pathways for HAP detoxification, and structure
  of Moco. (A) The chemical structure of HAP and the results of a spot test when HAP
  (10 μg) was placed in the center of a plate seeded with either the wild-type (wt)
  strain (NR10836) or its Moco-deficient (ΔmoaE) derivative (NR16523) using a multiprong
  replicator device (see Experimental Procedures). (B) Genetic pathways for Moco-dependent
  base-analog detoxification. The diagram, adapted from Kozmin et al. () and Kozmin
  et al. (), shows some of the synthesis steps of Moco, as well as its use in MPT
  form, for the YcbX- and YiiM-dependent pathways. The latter two perform in conjunction
  with flavin reductases CysJ (Kozmin et al. ) and Fre (S. G. Kozmin, E. I. Stepchenkova,
  J. Wang, and R. M. Schaaper, unpublished data) the detoxification (reduction) of
  6-N-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP), 2-amino-HAP (AHAP), N4-hydroxycytidine (HC), and
  hydroxylamine (NH2OH). The bisC pathway, mediated by biotin sulfoxide reductase,
  is a minor pathway dependent on the MGD form of Moco, which is only detectable in
  a ycbX yiiM background. The diagram also indicates the differential specificity
  of the three pathways for the indicated substrates. See text and Discussion for
  more details. (C) The structure of the Molybdenum cofactor. Shown is a simple Mo-MPT
  form that may be present in YcbX and YiiM (Kozmin et al. ). The Mo atom is coordinated
  through the dithiolene sulfurs connecting it to the ring system. Different forms
  of Moco have been described with additional sulfur ligand coordination at the Mo
  center, as well as nucleotide modifications, like the MGD or MCD dinucleotide form
  (Schwarz et al. ; Iobbi-Nivol and Leimkühler ).
