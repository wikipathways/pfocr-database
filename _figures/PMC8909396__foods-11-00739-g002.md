caption: 'The synthetic pathway of γ-PGA. Main biologically synthetic pathway of γ-PGA
  involves three steps: racemization, polymerization and transfer, and catabolism.
  Various substrates (e.g., glucose, citric acid, glycerol, biomass materials, and
  by-products) enter by the main anabolism pathway. For glutamate-independent strains,
  they can utilize exogenous nutrients to product γ-PGA through glycolysis, PPP, and
  TCA cycle. Instead, for glutamate-dependent strains, glutamic acid or glutamate
  are added to the medium directly to product γ-PGA. PPP, Pentose Phosphate Pathway;
  G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; TCA cycle, Tricarboxylic Acid cycle; E1, pyruvic
  acid aminotransferase (L-Glutamic acid); E2, alanine racemase; E3, pyruvic aminotransferase
  (D-Glutamic acid); RacE, glutamate racemase; Pgs, γ-PGA synthetase (four gene subunits
  operons: pgsB, C, A and E); GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; GS, glutamine synthetase;
  GOGAT, glutamate synthase or glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase. PgdS, γ-PGA
  hydrolase; Ggt, γ-glutamyl transferase; CwlO, cell wall lyases.'
