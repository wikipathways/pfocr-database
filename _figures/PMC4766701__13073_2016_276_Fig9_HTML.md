caption: Proposed model for B cell responses in secondary lymphoid organs during DENV
  infection. DENV recognition by naïve B cells and during early primary infection
  occurs in extra-follicular regions and induces a rapid differentiation to Ig-switched
  antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) secreting unmutated poly/cross-reactive IgG. This
  pathway may be initiated by DENV low-affinity interactions with B cells using an
  “innate” IGHV segment such as IGHV1-69 [] that promotes receptor-mediated endocytosis
  and TLR7 recognition. Both signals promote T-independent activation and class switch
  recombination (CSR). Later, the classical germinal center T-dependent response develops,
  peaking 1–2 weeks after symptoms onset. A secondary infection with a different serotype
  triggers the same “natural” B cell response derived from naïve B cells that temporally
  overlaps with a more rapid secondary T-dependent B cell response
papertitle: Lower IgG somatic hypermutation rates during acute dengue virus infection
  is compatible with a germinal center-independent B cell response.
