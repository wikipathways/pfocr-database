caption: Increased permeability of intestinal-barrier in elderly patients exacerbates
  the release of microbial compounds and inflammatory cytokines into the circulation.
  IL-1, one of the cytokines, will further induce the senescence of HSCs via microbiome/IL-1/IL-1R.
  LPS can stimulate increased release of IL-1 and TNF-α from old plasma cells via
  activation of TLR-mediated pathways, which will further induce HSCs aging. Moreover,
  LPS could directly induce HSCs aging by upregulating Klf5 and Stat3, and downregulating
  Ikzf1. The old HSCs from elderly septic patients exhibit myeloid-biased differentiation
  more significantly. In the circulation, neutrophils from older patients exhibit
  enhanced NETosis and deceased phagocytic capacity compared with those from young
  patients. Moreover, increased percentage of MO3 (CD14+ CD16++)/monocytes is observed
  in old patients, and these cells show impaired phagocytosis. The percentage of NK
  cells decreases in old patients, and the cytotoxicity of these cells is suppressed.
  DCs from elderly patients exhibit diminished antigen-presenting ability and enhanced
  proinflammatory activity. Enhanced T cell exhaustion has been observed in elderly
  patients due to increased percentage of PD-1+ T cells, and the immunosuppressive
  effects of Tregs are also elevated. In inflamed aged lungs, MC-derived CXCL1 drive
  neutrophil rTEM via ACKR1-CXCL1 axis. TREM2 expression level decreases in macrophages
  with aging. In several organs, such as lung, spleen, and liver, the downregulation
  of TREM2 induced more severe inflammation via IL-23/IL-17A axis. In the heart, TREM2
  deficiency macrophages show impaired phagocytosis, which causes decreased uptake
  of defective mitochondria from cardiomyocytes. In the liver, exosomes-containing
  miR-106b-5p released from TREM2 deficiency macrophages damage hepatocytic mitochondrial
  structure and function via Mfn2 blockade. Compared with young septic mice, increased
  inflammatory B1 and B2 cells are observed in adipose tissues in aged mice. And these
  cells induce inflammatory macrophages via NLRP3 activation, and inhibit lipolysis
  via Erk pathway suppression. (The red upward arrows mean increased cell numbers
  or functions in aged septic individuals compared with those in young septic individuals.
  The blue downward arrows mean decreased cell numbers or functions in aged septic
  individuals compared with those in young septic individuals.) *Created with BioRender.com
