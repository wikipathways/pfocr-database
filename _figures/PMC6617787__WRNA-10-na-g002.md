caption: Functional modes of secreted (viral) microRNAs (miRNAs). Host‐ and viral‐encoded
  miRNAs which are transcribed in the nucleus and processed in the nucleus and cytoplasm
  can be exported from the cell in extracellular vesicles (EVs). Export pathways involve
  multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) or budding from the plasma membrane. Viral miRNAs
  when transferred to recipient cells can promote/inhibit infection by regulating
  gene transcripts. Examples are shown involving viral miRNA transfer to dendritic
  cells (DCs) or macrophages (MΦ) that can lead to chronic inflammation through the
  activation of toll‐like receptors (TLRs). Host miRNAs transmitted from infected
  to uninfected cells can either enhance or suppress viral infections and/or contribute
  to chronic inflammation. Antiviral immune responses can be suppressed by host miRNAs
  that target the interferon (IFN) pathway in epithelial cells (Epi) or through inhibition
  of macrophage activation. On the other hand, host miRNAs can activate the IFN response
  by suppressing negative regulators of the retinoic acid‐inducible gene I (RIG‐I).
  Other mechanisms of host defense include the activation of autophagy
