caption: The reaction is believed to proceed through an α-bromination/cyclization
  pathway. The structure of the product was assigned by X-ray. The products in the
  box were synthesized using 0.05 mmol dienes and 0.1 mmol N-bromosuccinimide (NBS)
  in 1 ml dichloromethane for 2 h; isolated yield.
