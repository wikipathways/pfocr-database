caption: The schematic illustration about the relationship between surface molecule
  density and the cell death pathway. Surface density of CTAB on GNRs largely influences
  the internalization of GNRs, its intracellular route, the interaction between GNRs
  and lysosomes, and the specific killing of cancer cells dominated by apoptosis or
  necrosis. Caspase 8 protease plays a key role in the cell fate transition from necrosis
  to apoptosis which is tuned by tailoring GNR's Surface molecule density ρ surf.
