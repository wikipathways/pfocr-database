caption: Fluoride cause energy metabolism, mitochondrial respiratory chain damage,
  ER- mitochondrial-calcium-apoptotic pathway, resulting in apoptosis, resulting in
  dementia, skeletal fluorosis, hepatomegaly toxicity and other symptoms. (1) F− entered
  the mitochondria by free diffusion, the activities of key enzymes of respiratory
  chain complexes COX I, COX II, Cox III and ATP decreased, protein expression levels
  of NDUFV2 and SDHA decreased, and ROS increased. At the same time, the decrease
  of ATP synthesis and the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential caused the
  release of Cytc, which further triggered the caspase cascade reaction, which gave
  rise to cell apoptosis. (2) F− enters the mitochondria by free diffusion, and a
  small amount of electrons escape from the respiratory chain to form peroxides (H2O2),
  which act on COX I, produce extra ROS, activate NLRP3, ASC and Caspase 1, and cause
  apoptosis. (3) A large amount of ROS can destroy the single strand / double strand
  of DNA and is expected to result in apoptosis. (4) F-activates Ca2+ dependent enzyme
  captain and apoptosis factor Bcl-2 through ER stress, which further triggers caspase
  cascade reaction, releases CAD and RARP, DNA single strand / double strand destruction,
  and further causes cell apoptosis. It eventually causes symptoms such as dementia,
  skeletal fluorosis, hepatomegaly toxicity.
