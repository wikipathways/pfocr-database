caption: A. In unstressed cells, p53 expression is maintained at basal level due to
  its interaction with Mdm2, which serves to promote p53 ubiquitination and subsequent
  destruction. In response to DNA damage, Casein Kinase I (CKI) translocates into
  the nucleus and phosphorylates Mdm2 at multiple sites. The phosphorylated Mdm2 species
  are recognized and ubiquitinated by SCFβ-TRCP, and subsequently degraded by the
  26S proteasome-dependent pathway.B. p53 phosphorylation by ATM/Chk2 and Mdm2 phosphorylation
  by CKI positively regulate the p53 pathway. Phosphorylation of p53 by ATM/Chk2 triggers
  the dissociation of p53 from Mdm2 and stabilizes p53. However, increased p53 activity
  induces Mdm2 transcription, which serves as a negative feedback loop to induce p53
  downregulation. On the other hand, in response to the genotoxic stress, the Mdm2
  oncoprotein is quickly degraded by the CKI/SCFβ-TRCPsignaling pathway.
