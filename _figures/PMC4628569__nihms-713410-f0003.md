caption: The schematic pathways shown in the figure are derived from the findings
  of multiple studies described in the main text. The binding of IL-27 to its receptor
  leads to activation of JAK/STAT and P38/MAPK pathways. IL-27 can induce Th1 and
  Tr1 differentiation through multiple signaling pathways. Activation of STAT1 promotes
  Th1 differentiation either through activating T-bet or via upregulating membrane
  ICAM-1, which interacts with LFA-1 and signals via ERK. Another pathway of T-bet
  activation is through GADD45, leading to p38/MAPK activation. All these pathways
  of T-bet activation lead to IFN-γ secretion. SOCS3 represents one of the negative
  inhibitory loops for regulation of Th1 response. IL-27 signaling induces Tr1 differentiation
  by activating IL-10-related transcription factors Ahr and c-Maf. An additional pathway
  operates via Egr2 and Blimp-1. In addition, IL-27 can inhibit Foxp3 and suppress
  Treg generation.
