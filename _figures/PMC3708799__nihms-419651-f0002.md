caption: A well characterized target of PI3K and PTEN signaling is AKT. Accumulation
  of PI-3,4,5-P3 leads to the activation of AKT. AKT is a serine/threonine kinase
  and has a number of downstream targets. Through these targets, AKT regulates cell
  survival (through caspase, BAD and FOXO); cell growth (through p21, p27, MDM2, cyclin
  D (Cyn D) as well as FOXO); AKT also regulates mTOR signaling indirectly by inhibiting
  TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex 2 ). Through mTOR and glycogen synthase kinase
  (GSK3 β), AKT signaling pathway also controls protein translation. In addition,
  activation of AKT also leads to upregulation of lipogenic and glycolytic genes such
  as steroyl-CoA response element binding protein (srebp), fatty acid synthase (FAS)
  and glucokinase (GK). Together with mobilization of glucose transporters (GLUT),
  induction of these genes by AKT activation leads to enhanced cellular metabolic
  processes.
