caption: During hyperglycemia AR reduces glucose to sorbitol using NADPH as a co-factor
  and later sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) reduces sorbitol to fructose using NAD as
  a co-factor. AR causes oxidative stress by decreasing the ratio of NADP/NADPH and
  also competing with glutathione reductase (GR) for NADPH. Increased accumulation
  of sorbitol could cause osmotic stress. Metabolites of fructose increase AGE formation
  and cause glycative stress. Further, during oxidative stress conditions, AR catalyzed
  lipid aldehyde reaction products mediate cellular signals via activation of redox
  sensitive transcription factors.
