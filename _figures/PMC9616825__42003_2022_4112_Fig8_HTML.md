caption: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) signaling in healthy bone tissues
  maintains a balance between osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis, in collaboration
  through canonical Wnt signaling. At least for adipogenesis, TGFB restricts differentiation
  of marrow progenitor cells through the non-canonical TGFB-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)
  mechanism. Elevated glucose levels in diabetes suppress the TGFB signaling pathway,
  which, through alleviation of TAK1, leads to Pparg induction and expression of fatty
  acid- and lipid metabolism-regulating genes to favour adipogenesis. Dashed black
  arrows indicate linkages that require further investigation.
