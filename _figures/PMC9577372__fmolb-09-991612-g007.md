caption: TGFβ augments tumourigenesis by inducing angiogenesis. (A) As tumours grow,
  the concentration of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) in the tumour microenvironment
  increases. TGFβ upregulates genes involved with proliferation and migration in mural
  cells, which results in endothelial cell migration and leaky vessels. TGFβ binds
  to TGFβ receptors on endothelial cells to upregulate vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Both proteins are secreted into
  the basal lamina and increase proportionally to TGFβ. VEGF binds to endothelial
  cells and stimulates proliferation and migration. MMPs breakdown proteins in the
  basal lamina to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to carve out space for vessel
  formation. The new vessels grow and become more organized as time passes. (B) TGFβ
  binds to TGFβ receptors on endothelial cells and upregulate MMP2, MMP9, thrombospondin-4
  (TSP-4), microRNA-29s (miR-29a), VEGF, and protein kinase B (AKT). miR-29a blocks
  the translation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which is a known AKT inhibitor.
  Since the AKT pathway has been linked to angiogenesis, TGFβ signalling may induce
  angiogenesis through the AKT pathway.
