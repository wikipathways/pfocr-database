caption: 'Schematic summary of molecular mechanisms for duhuo jisheng decoction (DHJSD)
  on the lower back pain (LBP) caused by Bi Zheng. In TCM, “Bi Zheng” LBP is caused
  by Feng-Han-Shi due to double deficiencies in “Gan” and “Shen” or in “Qi” and “Xue”
  . DHJSD was specifically developed to orchestrate the therapeutic actions to target
  at the primary (Jun) and secondary (Chen and Zuo) causatives  and has an overall
  effect to eliminate “feng-han-shi” and thus relieves pain of “Bi Zheng” through
  promoting “Gan” and “Shen” function and reinforcing the bones and tendons . It also
  improves circulation and removes stasis of “Qi” and “Xue”, reduces tissue swelling,
  and relieves pain,,,,,,. Duhuo (contains osthole) and jisheng target the major etiological
  problems as “Jun” (or chief) components by eliminating “feng-han-shi”. Osthole exhibited
  anti-inflammation , and anti-bone resorption effect  and stimulated osteoblast differentiation
  and bone formation by activation of beta-catenin-BMP signaling (indicated by the
  blue arrows) . Jisheng has dual functions: it strengthens the “Gan” and “Shen” while
  subsequently nourishing the bones and tendons and relieves the pain of arthritis.
  DHJSD may inhibit VEGF and HIF-1α to retard cartilage degradation . The “chen” components
  all facilitate the effect of du-huo on “feng-han-shi” by targeting at the secondary
  etiological problems through the inhibition of the Rho/NF-κB and TGF-β/smad-3 pathways.
  The “Zuo” components include duzhong, niuxi, were used to promote function of “Gan”
  and “Shen” and strengthen the tendons and bones, danggui, chuanxiong, dihuang, and
  baishao to nourish and modulate function of “Xue” renshen, fuling and gancao to
  promote function of “Pi” and “Qi”. Therefore, the integrated function of the DHJSD
  is an effective “feng-han-shi” eliminator and LBP reliever and has anti-inflammation
  , and anti-bone resorption effect  and can stimulate osteoblast differentiation
  and bone formation  and has an integrated anti-inflammatory effect and significant
  protective effect against the ECM degeneration of the SDF-1-treated hNPCs. ECM:
  extracellular matrix; hNPCs: human nucleus pulposus cells; VEGF: vascular endothelial
  growth factor; GM-CSF: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; CXCR4:
  C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4; MMP-3: metalloproteinase-3; MMP-13: metalloproteinase-13;
