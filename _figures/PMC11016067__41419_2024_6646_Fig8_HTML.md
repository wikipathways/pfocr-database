caption: FBXL8 interacts with Snail1 and targets Snail1 for ubiquitin-proteasome degradation
  response to MI. In response to TGFβ stimulation and MI, downregulation of FBXL8
  expression in CFs leads to stabilization of Snail1, thereby activating the RhoA/α-SMA
  pathway, inducing myofibroblast differentiation and the progress of cardiac fibrosis
  following MI.
