caption: Working model for the Grb14-mediated inhibition of PTP1B activity. Known
  PTP1B regulators are reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathionylation, and SUMOylation.
  The novel PTP1B inhibitory pathway is activated through G-protein-coupled receptor
  rhodopsin-mediated activation of a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src, which in turn
  phosphorylates Grb14. Phosphorylated Grb14 binds to PTP1B and inhibits its activity
  through a competitive mode of inhibition. Grb14-mediated inhibition of PTP1B may
  have significance in insulin, leptin, Jak/Stat, and Ras signaling pathways. P-Grb14,
  phosphorylated Grb14.
