caption: Metabolism of cystine and cystine-derived metabolites. Schematic shows cystine
  uptake via SLC7A11Imported cystine is reduced to cysteine by utilizing NADPH (the
  reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Cysteine is used to
  synthesize glutathione by combining with glutamate and glycine (shown in the green
  background). Intracellular cystine can combine with other molecules such as γ-glutamylcysteine
  (an intermediate of the glutathione pathway) to form γ-glutamylcystine; similarly,
  cystine can also donate one cysteine to combine with glutathione to form glutathionylcysteiene
  (shown in the left red background). In addition, these metabolites can be linked
  to proteins via disulfide bonds (shown in the right red background).
