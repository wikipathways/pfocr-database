caption: (a) The experimentally well-characterized clock in S. elongatus consists
  of a negative feedback-enabled self-sustained oscillator. KaiBC complexes sequester
  KaiA, preventing runaway KaiC molecules from going through the cycle independently.

  known facts () about this clock; KaiC phosphorylation proceeds without KaiA and
  hence different KaiC hexamers can proceed independently through the cycle. (c) We
  combine both clocks in one model with an interpolating parameter  that selects between
  an S. elongatus-like KaiA-dependent pathway and an P. marinus-like KaiA-independent
  pathway. All reactions shown are assumed to be first order mass-action kinetics.
  We simulate such a system at different overall copy numbers  using the Gillespie
  algorithm. (d) We find limit cycles for . The resulting limit cycles for  violate
  the simplifying assumptions used in our dynamical systems (e.g., non-circular cycles
  of different size); and yet our results are qualitatively validated by this model
  ( from the main text).
