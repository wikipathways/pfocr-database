caption: LZTR1 inhibits the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway by regulating RIT1 in NS and
  GBM. (A) NS-related RIT1 mutations do not occur in codons analogous to the classic
  Gly12, Gly13, and Gln61 alleles compared with other RAS-superfamily proteins, although
  they are clustered around the switch II region. (B) LZTR1 induces polyubiquitination
  and degradation of RIT1 to inhibit the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. By contrast,
  mutations in LZTR1 or RIT1 prevent the formation of the substrate-LZTR1-CUL3 complex,
  resulting in insufficient degradation of RIT1, abnormal activation of RAS/MAPK signaling,
  leading to the occurrence of NS or GBM. (C) LZTR1 regulates RAS/MAPK signaling,
  and mutations in LZTR1 or RAS-superfamily proteins lead to excessive activation
  of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathways, eventually resulting in NS and GBM. LZTR1 inhibits
  the occurrence of schwannomatosis, although the specific mechanism remains unclear.
  The relationship between NF1, which serves as a negative regulator of the RAS signaling
  pathway, and LZTR1 remains to be studied. LZTR1, leucine zipper-like transcription
  regulator 1; RIT1, RAS-like without CAAX1; CUL, cullin; NS, Noonan syndrome; GBM,
  glioblastoma; NF1, neurofibromin 1; RBX, RING box protein; WT, wild-type; Mut, mutant;
  UB, ubiquitin; P, pyrophosphate.
