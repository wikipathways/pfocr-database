caption: EGFR signaling pathway. Ligand binding induces dimerization and activates
  the EGFR. Subsequent autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues activates downstream
  signaling. In the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK, one axis of the EGFR signaling cascade, an adaptor
  protein complex composed of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 adapter protein
  (Grb2), which harbors a tyrosine phosphate-docking site, and son of sevenless (SOS),
  a Ras GDP/GTP exchange factor, then activates the Ras GTPase. After activation,
  Ras (i.e., KRas) recruits and activates the serine protein Raf (i.e., B-Raf), and
  subsequent phosphorylation and activation of MEK and then MAPK occurs, resulting
  in activation of transcription factors in the cell nucleus. The Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling
  pathway is thought to control cell growth, differentiation, and survival (?apoptosis).
  The other axis of the EGFR signaling cascade that is important in colorectal carcinogenesis
  is the PI3K-AKT pathway. Once the EFGR tyrosine residues are phosphorylated, PI3K
  is translocated to the cell membrane and binds to tyrosine phosphate (through its
  adaptor subunit p85) which triggers the PI3K catalytic subunit p110 to produce phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3). PI3K then promotes AKT activation. Activated AKT (p-AKT), present within
  the cytoplasm, then activates various targets that result in cell growth, proliferation,
  and survival (paralleling the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK signaling pathway). Importantly,
  these two axes are closely related and have some overlap. For example, the p110
  subunit of PI3K can also be activated via interaction with Ras. Of note, phosphatase
  with tensin homology (PTEN) is a phosphatase that converts PIP3 back to phosphatidylinositol
  (4, 5) bisphosphate (PIP2), thereby negatively regulating the PI3K-AKT pathway.
