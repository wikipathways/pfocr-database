caption: Summary of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and growth and differentiation
  factor (GDF) signaling pathway and mutations causing connective tissue and skeletal
  disorders. The BMP signaling pathway is activated by extracellular ligands, such
  as BMPs and GDFs, through binding to type I (BMPRI) and type II (BMPRII) receptor
  complexes. Extracellular antagonists, such as noggin, can block ligand–receptor
  binding and pathway activation. Smad (shown) and non-Smad (not shown) mechanisms
  mediate BMP signal transduction to regulate transcriptional target genes, including
  sclerostin (SOST), a Wnt pathway inhibitor. Key components of the BMP pathway are
  shown to illustrate positions at which gene mutations act to cause specific human
  connective tissue and skeletal syndromes. Cross talk with the Wnt pathway is also
  shown. Specific disorders and their gene mutations (in parentheses), as discussed
  in text and , are shaded in yellow if the mutation enhances pathway signaling or
  in red if the pathway has diminished activation. White boxes indicate disorders
  for which the BMP pathway is either not directly affected or the functional consequence
  of the mutation is unknown. BDA2, Brachydactyly type A2; BDC, brachydactyly type
  C; AMDH, acromesomelic dysplasia Hunter–Thompson type; AMDG, acromesomelic dysplasia
  Grebe type; FOP, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva; VBD, Van Buchem disease.
