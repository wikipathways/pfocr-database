caption: Proposed molecular mechanisms mediating GRPR regulation of brain function.
  The stimulation of hippocampal memory consolidation by GRPR activation depends on
  PKC, MAPK, PKA, and PI3K, and is potentiated by activation of the D1R/cAMP/PKA pathway
  (, , ). GRPR activation at the postsynaptic membrane is coupled to Gq protein activity
  and increases in [Ca2+], leading to stimulation of the PLC/PKC and ERK/MAPK pathways.
  D1R is coupled to the Gs protein and adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation. The D1R-induced
  cAMP signal might be potentiated by [Ca2+]-induced stimulation of [Ca2+]-responsive
  types of AC (; ; , ), providing a possible mechanism for the requirement of cAMP/PKA
  signaling for GRPR influences on memory. Modified from , , with permission.
