caption: A sketch shows the biosynthetic pathway of ALA and the use of ALA as a substrate
  for the synthesis of chlorophyll and heme in plants. ALA is created in stroma of
  chloroplast. The main biosynthetic pathway of ALA is the Beal pathway, which starts
  from glutamic acid. L-Glutamate is ligated to tRNAGlu, which is catalyzed by glutamyl–tRNA
  synthetase (GluTS) to form L-glutamy–tRNA. Then, Glu-tRNA is converted to L-glutamic
  acid 1-semialdehyde (GSA), a reaction catalyzed by the key rate-limiting enzyme
  glutamyl–tRNA reductase (GluTR). GSA then undergoes an isomerization reaction catalyzed
  by glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (GSAT) to form ALA. Two molecules of
  ALA are catalyzed by ALA dehydratase (ALAD) and agglomerate to form a pyrrole ring
  called porphobilinogen (PBG). Then, after a six-step enzymatic reaction, four molecules
  of PBG polymerize to form a porphyrin structure, eventually forming (PpIX). PpIX
  combines with different enzymes and substrates to yield different products; PpIX
  chelates Fe2+ with Ferrochelatase (FECH) to produce heme, and Mg2+ with Mg-chelatase
  (MCH), and then undergoes a series of catalytic reactions to produce chlorophyll.
