caption: 'Blue light signaling pathway in stomatal guard cells. Arrows and a T-bar
  represent positive and negative regulation, respectively. The P in the white circles
  indicates a phosphorylation of each protein. The timescale of each peak of the key
  signaling events for blue light-induced stomatal opening (∼2 h) is shown as follows:
  phototropin activation (within 1 min), H+ pumping (∼2.5 min), hyperpolarization
  (several min), K+ accumulation (between 30 and 60 min). Triacylglycerol breakdown,
  starch degradation, and vacuolar remodeling are observed within 1 to 2 h after the
  start of light illumination. phot, Phototropin; 14-3-3, 14-3-3 protein; Chl., chloroplast;
  PAR, photosynthetically active radiation; TAG, triacylglycerol.'
