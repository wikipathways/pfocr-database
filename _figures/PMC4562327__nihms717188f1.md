caption: 'Transition of primordial to primary follicles. Embryonic specification of
  the female gonad and formation of primordial follicles depends on WNT4 and FOXL2.
  Quiescent primordial follicles leave the resting pool by mechanisms that involve
  changes in both oocyte (activation of the PI3K pathway) and somatic cell (levels
  of AMH) functions. Primary follicle formation is independent of gonadotropins but
  is associated with changes in granulosa cell function and morphology leading to
  expression of IGF-I/-II, FSHR, AMH, AR, and KL. Changes in oocyte functions lead
  to the production of the zona pellucida and expression of GDF9. KL and GDF9 coordinate
  to regulate formation of the theca cell layer. GDF9 also appears to enhance theca
  cell androgen production, which in turn can increase the expression of FSHR. In
  PCOS, high levels of insulin and LH may act on cognate receptors in theca cells,
  once organized, to further increase androgen production. Levels of FSHR (and AMH?)
  are elevated; however, some data indicate that AMH is lower (). Large gray circle:
  oocyte; red line: zona pellucida; small blue circles: granulosa cells; dark blue
  boxes: theca cells. Oocyte factor and GDF9 signaling is denoted by green arrows;
  LH and androgen signaling by red arrows and letters; and insulin signaling by purple
  arrows. Blue arrows indicate that these primary follicles go on to develop into
  secondary follicles.'
