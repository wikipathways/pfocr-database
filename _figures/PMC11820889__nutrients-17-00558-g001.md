caption: Summary of the effect of B. breve MCC1274 on AppNL–G–F and WT Mice. (A) In
  6-month-old AppNL–G–F mice, oral supplementation with B. breve MCC1274 alleviated
  cognitive dysfunction and reduced Aβ deposition by increasing the ADAM10 protein
  level in the hippocampus. This treatment also helped alleviate neuroinflammation
  and improved synaptic density. (B) In WT mice, supplementation with B. breve MCC1274
  decreased levels of soluble Aβ42 and PS1 proteins through the Akt/GSK–3β signaling
  pathway. It also attenuated microglial activation and inhibited tau phosphorylation,
  which may enhance synaptic function. (C) In 17–month–old AppNL–G–F mice, administration
  of B. breve MCC1274 may provide ameliorative effects by reducing chronic stress.
  This is achieved by inhibiting tau hyperphosphorylation through the p–JNK and p–ERK
  pathways, as well as improving synaptic density
