caption: Schematic illustration of distinct signaling pathways induced by rhTum and
  rhEndo. rhTum binds to αvβ3 integrin, whereas rhEndo binds to α5β1. Both rhEndo
  and rhTum inhibit phosphorylation of FAK (yellow). Downstream of FAK, rhTum inhibits
  PI3-K/Akt/mTor/4EBP1 pathway, resulting in inhibition of endothelial protein synthesis
  and proliferation. MAP kinase pathways are not affected by rhTum. In contrast, inhibition
  of FAK activation by rhEndo binding to α5β1 integrin leads to inhibition of ERK1/p38
  MAP kinase pathways with no effect on PI3-K/Akt/mTOR/4EBP1 pathways, resulting in
  inhibition of endothelial cell migration. [Adapted from Sudhaker et al. []]
