caption: Local effects of the gut microbiota on CRC development. Clostridium nucleatum
  promotes tumor development through multiple mechanisms. Its production of the virulence
  factor FadA can lead to increased expression of membrane-linked protein A1 via E-calmodulin,
  which in turn activates Wnt/β-linked protein signaling. The wnt ligand, a secreted
  glycoprotein, can bind to coiled-coil receptors and form larger cell surface complexes
  with lipoprotein receptor-associated protein (LRP). Displacement of the multifunctional
  kinase GSK-3β from the regulatory APC/Axin/GSK-3β complex is triggered by the activated
  Wnt receptor complex. The stable β-linked protein translocates to the nucleus, displaces
  the co-inhibitor upon binding to LEF/TCF transcription factors, and recruits the
  coactivator. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in F. nucleatum causes the activation of the
  nuclear factor κ light chain enhancer (NF-κB) signaling pathway in activated B cells.
  The conventional signaling pathway is that NF-κB/Rel proteins bind to and are inhibited
  by IκB proteins. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates IKK complexes (IKKβ, IKKα, and
  IKKγ) via toll-like receptors (TLR) to phosphorylate IκB proteins. IκB phosphorylation
  leads to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation followed by release of NF-κB/Rel
  complexes. The active NF-κB/Rel complex is further translocated into the nucleus
  and induces target gene expression. Another important signaling pathway that activates
  cytokines is the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT)
  pathway. When STAT is phosphorylated, it polymerizes into an activated form of transcriptional
  activator and enters the nucleus to bind to target genes and promote their transcription.
