caption: TLR/IL-1R signalling pathways. Once activated by their respective ligands,
  IL-1R, IL-18R, and TLRs engage with one or more adaptor proteins. These adaptors,
  namely, MyD88, MAL/TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM are recruited, in various combinations,
  to the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors through homophilic interactions between
  Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains present in each receptor and each adaptor. TIRAP
  is required to act as a bridge for MyD88 in TLR2 and TLR4 signalling, while TRIF
  is used in TLR3 signalling and, in association with TRAM, in TLR4 signalling. In
  the MyD88-dependent pathway, MyD88 associates with IRAK4, IRAK1 and/or IRAK2. IRAK4
  in turn phosphorylates IRAK1 and IRAK2 and promotes their association with TRAF6,
  which serves as a platform to recruit the kinase TAK1. Once activated, TAK1 activates
  the IKK complex, composed of IKKα, IKKβ  and NEMO (IKKγ), which catalyzes phosphorylation
  and subsequent degradation of IκB rendering NF-κB (i.e., p50/p65) free to translocate
  from the cytosol to the nucleus and activate NF-κB-dependent genes. The transcription
  factor IRF7 is also activated downstream of TLRs 7, 8, and 9, leading to its translocation
  into the nucleus and to activation of IFNα and IFN-inducible genes. TLR3 and TLR4
  both signal through the adaptor TRIF, which interacts with TRAF3 to activate the
  noncanonical IKKs, TBK1, and IKKε resulting in the dimerization and activation of
  IRF3, which then translocates into the nucleus activating the transcription of IFNβ  and
  IFN-inducible genes.

  description: TLR/IL-1R signalling pathways. Once activated by their respective ligands,
    IL-1R, IL-18R, and TLRs engage with one or more adaptor proteins. These adaptors,
    namely, MyD88, MAL/TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM are recruited, in various combinations,

    is required to act as a bridge for MyD88 in TLR2 and TLR4 signalling, while TRIF
    is used in TLR3 signalling and, in association with TRAM, in TLR4 signalling.
    In the MyD88-dependent pathway, MyD88 associates with IRAK4, IRAK1 and/or IRAK2.
    IRAK4 in turn phosphorylates IRAK1 and IRAK2 and promotes their association with
    TRAF6, which serves as a platform to recruit the kinase TAK1. Once activated,
    TAK1 activates the IKK complex, composed of IKKα, IKKβ  and NEMO (IKKγ), which
