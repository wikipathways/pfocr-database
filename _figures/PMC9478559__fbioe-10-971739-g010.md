caption: Schematic overview of metabolic regulation in Caco-2 cells cultured with
  C. difficile. First, C. difficile causes inhibition of energy metabolism, including
  glycolysis and the TCA cycle, along with downregulation of the electron transport
  chain in Caco-2 cells during the early stage of infection. Mitochondrial dysfunction
  leads to ROS production, and in response, Caco-2 cells upregulate the glutathione-dependent
  antioxidant system. Second, ER stress in Caco-2 cells caused by CDI causes the accumulation
  of nonfunctional proteins (unfolded and misfolded proteins). Caco-2 cells degrade
  nonfunctional proteins through the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway and reduce protein
  synthesis. Finally, C. difficile induces damage to cell junctions, including tight
  junctions and adherens junctions, in Caco-2 cells. In response, Caco-2 cells upregulate
  syndecan-4 to maintain intestinal epithelial barrier function. ETC, electron transfer
  chain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
