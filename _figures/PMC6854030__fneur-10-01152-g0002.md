caption: Amyloidogenesis and the influence of lipid managing proteins. (A) Alternative
  proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Plasma membrane α-secretase
  initiates the non-amyloidogenic pathway, releasing a soluble ectodomain (sAPPα)
  and generating a membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment (CTF) of 83 amino acids.
  In contrast, the amyloidogenic pathway is initiated by β-secretase in intracellular
  acidic organelles. Its processing results in a 99-amino-acid CTF and a soluble extracellular
  sAPPβ. CTFs are subsequently processed by γ-secretases generating p3 or Aβ peptides
  and releasing an APP intracellular domain (AICD). The AICD resulting from the amyloidogenic
  pathway translocates to the nucleus and regulates amyloidogenic and lipid metabolism
  gene transcription. The AICD generated by the non-amyloidogenic pathway is rapidly
  degraded in the cytosol. (B) Effects of ApoE on the production and dynamics of Aβ
  peptides. Direct interaction of ApoE with APP modulates its internalization. Also,
  LRP1 receptor promotes APP internalization. Because ApoE2/ApoE3 isoforms have more
  affinity for this receptor than ApoE4, ApoE2, and ApoE3 avoid APP internalization,
  preventing the amyloidogenic pathway (disfavored interactions depicted as red crosses).
  Moreover, ApoE triggers a signaling pathway that stimulates APP transcription. ApoE4
  is the most potent isoform in triggering this pathway and thus Aβ production. Finally,
  ApoE also binds hydrophobic Aβ peptides through its lipid-binding domain. The lower
  lipid load of ApoE4 isoform results in a lower efficiency in Aβ clearance.
