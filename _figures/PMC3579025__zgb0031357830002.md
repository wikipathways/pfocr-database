caption: Binding of antigen to the T cell antigen receptor (TCR-CD3) complex results
  in phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins, followed by the activation
  of PKCθ and by an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, which then
  activates calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinases and phosphatases. Phosphorylation
  triggers the Zap-70/Vav pathway leading to actin rearrangements and initiates a
  series of coordinated signals that ensure cell survival and induce cell proliferation
  and the production of IL-2 through the activation of transcription factors, Oct,
  NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-AT. PKCθ supports the activation of Oct and in synergy with
  calcium-activated calcineurin, stimulates the activation of AP-1 and NFAT through
  the MAPK/JNK pathway. PKCθ also stimulates the translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus through activation of the IKKβ subunit. Activation of these transcription
  factors leads to the production of IL-2, a major cytokine critical for inflammatory
  responses.
