caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway from breast cancer to liver metastasis.
  TP53 protein is one of the important targets in the cancer signaling pathway and
  is involved in cell-cycle control, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Bevacizumab is a
  VEGF-A monoclonal antibody against circulating VEGF and can inhibit tumor angiogenesis.
