caption: Correlation network analysis of selected features for miRNAs, immune cells,
  and microbes, and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of these miRNAs and their negatively
  correlated DE target transcripts. (A) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of bio-signature
  miRNAs and their negatively correlated DE target genes (p ≤ 0.05). The pie charts
  indicate the proportion of the DE gene’s contribution to KEGG pathways. The blue
  ellipse showed that mRNAs were downregulated in LB and upregulated in LSL, while
  the red ellipse showed the opposite. The green symbol depicts miRNAs downregulated
  in LB and upregulated in LSL, whereas the red symbol indicates those upregulated
  in LB and downregulated in LSL. (B) Correlation network derived from Pearson correlations
  calculated between bio-signatures of miRNAs, immune cells, and microbes (FDR ≤ 5%).
  Circular shape showed immune cells linked to LB (orange) or LSL (pink). Likewise,
  the sky blue triangle indicated microbial taxa linked with LB, while the yellow
  triangle showed microbial taxa associated with LSL. The red and green connections
  indicated the positive and negative correlation, respectively.
