caption: An illustration of the signaling mechanism that regulates the induction of
  the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) as elucidated in C. elegans.
  The UPRmt is activated during mitochondrial dysfunction or stress resulting in the
  transcriptional up-regulation of protective genes including mitochondrial chaperones
  and proteases, those involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, the
  glycolysis pathway and the mitochondrial protein import machinery. The cell determines
  mitochondrial function and when it is appropriate to induce the UPRmt by monitoring
  the mitochondrial protein import efficiency of the transcription factor ATFS-1.
  In the absence of mitochondrial stress, ATFS-1 is translated and efficiently imported
  into mitochondria via a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), where ATFS-1 is
  degraded by the Lon protease. However, during mitochondrial dysfunction, general
  protein import efficiency is reduced allowing a percentage of ATFS-1 to accumulate
  in the cytosol. Because ATFS-1 also has a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), it
  then traffics to the nucleus where it induces the UPRmt. Mitochondrial import efficiency
  can be impaired or reduced by a number of conditions including mitochondrial chaperone
  depletion or respiratory chain dysfunction. Additionally, import can be slowed by
  peptide efflux via the ABC transporter HAF-1, which occurs when the mitochondrial
  chaperone (green) capacity is exceeded by unfolded proteins (dashed lines); all
  of which result in UPRmt induction to maintain organelle homeostasis.
