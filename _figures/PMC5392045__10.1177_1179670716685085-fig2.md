caption: Interplay between autophagy, apoptosis, and the stimulator of interferon
  genes (STING) pathway. The canonical cytosolic DNA-cGAS-cGAMP-STING-IRF3 pathway
  is subject to regulation by autophagic and apoptotic signaling proteins. Beclin-1
  directly interacts with cGAS to suppress cGAMP production. ULK1 phosphorylates STING
  to prevent IRF3 phosphorylation. However, at high DNA damage loads, UV light and
  related environmental agents activate caspase and calpain apoptotic signaling, which
  promotes ULK1 degradation and therefore de-represses the STING pathway. cGAS indicates
  cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; TBK1, TANK-binding
  kinase 1; ULK1, UNC-51–like kinase 1.
