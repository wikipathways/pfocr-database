  Wild-type strain; b S-M strain; c S-M-E strain. Black circle represents total lipid,
  yellow circle represents C16:0, blue circle represents OCFAs (C15:0 + C17:0), and
  green circle represents DHA. Black lines represent original pathway, and gray lines
  represent enhanced (bold) or decreased (slim) original pathways after engineering
