caption: Chemically modified ncRNAs in diseases. (A) PUS7 facilitates the Nm modification
  of tRNA, which in turn regulates the TYK2-STAT1 signaling pathway in glioblastoma
  stem cell (GSC). (B) SNORD24 mediates the Ψ modification of 18S rRNA, affecting
  the structural functionality of ribosomes. FTO is responsible for the demethylation
  of m6A in circGPR137B, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation, while NOP2 mediates
  the m5C modification of PVT1, which promotes cell proliferation in hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC). (C) SNORA56 mediates the Ψ modification of 28S rRNA, thereby regulating
  the translation of the catalytic subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC) and
  promoting cell proliferation. ZFAS1 recruits SNORD12C and SNORD78 through synergistic
  recruitment with NOP58, leading to the elevation of the Nm modification of rRNA
  and the promotion of cell proliferation. METTL14 downregulates m6A modification
  of lncRNA XIST, thereby facilitating cell proliferation, while METTL3 mediates m6A
  modification of lncRNA RP11 and circ1662, both of which enhance cell migration.
  Furthermore, YTHDC1 mediates m6A modification of circNSUN2, promoting liver metastasis
  of colorectal cancer (CRC). (D) snoRNA and DKC1 mediate the Ψ modification of rRNA,
  which affects ribosomal function in breast cancer (BC). (E) SNORD88C and SCD1 mediate
  the Nm modification of 28S rRNA, promoting cell proliferation in non-small cell
  lung cancer (NSCLC). METTL3 also mediates m6A modification of LCAT3, contributing
  cell proliferation, while METTL1 and the WD repeat domain 4 protein (WDR4) mediate
  m7G modification of tRNA, which promotes cell proliferation in lung adenocarcinoma
  (LUAD). Conversely, METTL1 mediates m7G modification of let-7e, inhibiting cell
  migration in lung cancer (LC). (F) METTL3 mediates m6A modification of miR-25-3p,
  promoting cell migration. The complex CFL1/METTL3/YTHDC2/MLL1 mediates m6A modification
  of super-enhancer RNA (seRNA), which promotes oncogene transcription in pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). (G) NSUN2 mediates m5C modification of NR_033928,
  promoting cell growth in gastric cancer (GC). (h) METTL3 mediates m5C modification
  of circE7, inhibiting cell growth in cervical cancer (CC). (I) NSUN2 mediates m5C
  modification of NMR, promoting cell migration in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
  (ESCC). (J) METTL3 mediates m6A modification of circRIMS2, which is implicated in
  synaptic and memory impairments associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). (K) PUS7
  mediates the Ψ modification of tRFs to inhibit the synthesis of aberrant proteins,
  thereby improving hematopoietic function and protecting against leukemic progression
