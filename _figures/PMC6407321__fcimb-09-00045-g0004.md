caption: Proposed mechanism of protection for oral SUB+IV vaccine against tick infestations
  in cattle. Based on the negative correlation between anti-SUB IgG antibody and C3
  pathway gene mRNA levels and the number of female ticks, a protective mechanism
  for SUB+IV oral vaccination was proposed. After the vaccine reaches the oral mucosa-associated
  lymphoid tissue underlying the epithelium, antigen uptake, processing, and presentation
  occurs via microfold/membraneous cells (M) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such
  as macrophages (Mϕ), dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells (B). The C3 pathway activated
  in DCs and other cell types bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems for the
  initiation of antigen-specific response by activated T cells (T), T helper cells
  (Th), cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and B cells. Activated adaptive immune response
  cells secrete cytokines such as IL-12, IL-2, and TNF-α to realize the systemic immune
  protection. The C3 pathway was activated after oral vaccination with SUB+IV to mediate
  the production of IgG antibodies affecting SUB translocation/function after ingestion
  with blood meal for the reduction of tick infestations.
