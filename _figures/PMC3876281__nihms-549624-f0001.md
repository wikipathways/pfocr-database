caption: In drug-sensitive cancers (left), the mutant oncogene exerts unilateral control
  over RAS, MEK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT pathway signaling. When inhibited by the appropriate
  TKI, these pathways are suppressed, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
  In drug-resistant cancers with a bypass track (right), the secondary RTK reactivates
  the signaling of at least one of the key downstream pathways, whereas the primary
  oncogene remains inhibited. Sustained activation of these pathways leads to continued
  cell proliferation and survival in the presence of TKI.
