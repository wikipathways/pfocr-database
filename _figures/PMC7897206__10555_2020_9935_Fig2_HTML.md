caption: The role of caspase-8 in macrophagic differentiation. The interaction of
  M-CSF with its receptor provokes the PI3K/Akt pathway in the monocytes, which within
  3–4 days induces the assembly of a molecular platform that includes FADD, FLIP,
  RIP1, and pro-caspase-8. As a consequence, the cleaved RIP1 prevents the sustained
  NFκB activation in the nucleus. The activated caspase-8 and -3 target downstream
  proteins such as nucleophosmin (NPM-1), which also regulates the transcriptional
  activity of NFκB. NPM-1 is a multifunctional protein, and its caspase-mediated cleavage
  is required for the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages after M-CSF stimulation
