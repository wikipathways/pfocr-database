caption: (A) Under basal condition, the catalytic cycle of TOP1mt is facilitated by
  the removal of TOP1mt-cc by TDP1. Transcription of the mitochondrial subunits of
  the ETC complexes is balanced with transcription of the nuclear subunits, resulting
  in the proper assembly of the ETC complexes. Efficient functioning of ETC complexes
  promotes ATP production by OXPHOS, generating membrane potential that prevents formation
  of ROS. (B) In the absence of TDP1, TOP1mt-cc accumulate, which inhibit mitochondrial
  transcription without affecting transcription of the nuclear subunits, leading to
  misassembly of complex III. OXPHOS efficiency is reduced and ROS production is increased.
  (C) When excessive TOP1mt-cc are formed (for example, because of trapping by oxidized
  DNA lesions or TOP1mt poison), compensatory up-regulation of TDP1 activity accelerates
  TOP1mt catalytic cycle and promotes mitochondrial transcription. However, without
  proportional increase in nuclear transcription, misassembly of ETC complexes leads
  to a reduction in OXPHOS and an elevation of ROS production. Mito., mitochondrial;
  Nucl., nuclear.
