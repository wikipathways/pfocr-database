caption: GnRH-stimulated signaling pathways that regulate Fshb gene expression. When
  GnRH binds to its receptor (GnRHR), the receptor is activated and interacts either
  with Gαq/11 or Gαs to initiate intracellular signaling pathways that subsequently
  stimulate Fshb gene expression. The activation of Gαq/11 activates phospholipase
  C (PLC)β, which, in turn, results in generation of IP3 and DAG. IP3 mobilizes Ca2+
  from endoplasmic reticulum stores. Further increase of intracellular Ca2+ is mediated
  by calcium influx through L-type voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC). The rise
  in calcium concentration stimulates several calcium-dependent cascades, including
  the calmodulin/calcineurin/NFAT pathway and the calmodulin/CaMK II pathway, resulting
  in increased Fshb gene expression. DAG formation leads to activation of PKC, which
  in turn activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (ERK1/2, JNK, p38)
  to further stimulate Fshb gene transcription. The activation of Gαs activates adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) and consequently activates the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, which in
  turn leads to CREB phosphorylation and enhanced Fshb transcription. CaMK II, calcium/calmodulin-dependent

  description: GnRH-stimulated signaling pathways that regulate Fshb gene expression.
    When GnRH binds to its receptor (GnRHR), the receptor is activated and interacts
    either with Gαq/11 or Gαs to initiate intracellular signaling pathways that subsequently
    stimulate Fshb gene expression. The activation of Gαq/11 activates phospholipase
    C (PLC)β, which, in turn, results in generation of IP3 and DAG. IP3 mobilizes
    Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores. Further increase of intracellular Ca2+
    is mediated by calcium influx through L-type voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC).
    The rise in calcium concentration stimulates several calcium-dependent cascades,
    including the calmodulin/calcineurin/NFAT pathway and the calmodulin/CaMK II pathway,
    resulting in increased Fshb gene expression. DAG formation leads to activation
    of PKC, which in turn activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (ERK1/2,
    JNK, p38) to further stimulate Fshb gene transcription. The activation of Gαs
    activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) and consequently activates the cAMP/PKA signaling
    pathway, which in turn leads to CREB phosphorylation and enhanced Fshb transcription.
