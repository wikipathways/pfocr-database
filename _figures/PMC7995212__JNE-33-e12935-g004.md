caption: Hypothetical consequences of the marked down‐regulation of angiotensin‐converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) (symbolised by attenuated ) as a consequence of severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) (symbolised by ) to potentiate the aggressive
  branch and weaken the protective branches of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system
  (RAAS), represented by reddish and blueish objects, respectively. The down‐regulated
  metabolites and physiological functions are represented by grey objects, which drive
  toward increased vasoconstriction, inflammatory responses, cytokine storm, oxidative
  stress and intussusceptive angiogenesis, as well as the sustained activation of
  hypothalamic vasopressin magnocellular neurosecretory neurones (MNNs). The propposed
  mechanism is through potentiated angiotensin II (1‐8) to angiotensin III (2‐8),
  binding to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) and angiotensin receptor 2 (AT2R) of MNN
  and by promoting aldosterone secretion via the AT1R pathway in the cortical adrenal
  gland, causing water retention, hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia by potassium diuresis.
  Also, the hypothetical consequences of biased protein Gi signalling by the loss
  of apelin metabolites, causing receptor desensitisation and internalisation of the
  apelin receptor (APJ) by parental apelin peptides are depicted. APA, aminopeptidase
  A; MasR, Mas receptor
