caption: Crosstalks between BR/BRI1 and other RLK pathways.A. Crosstalk between BR/BRI1
  and flagellin/FLS2 pathways regulating the tradeoff between growth and immunity.B.
  BR/BRI1 crosstalks with the ERECTA-MAPK pathway to regulate stomata development.C.
  BR/BRI1 crosstalk with the TDIF/TDR pathway to antagonistically regulate xylem differentiation.
  TDIF/TDR also regulates BIN2 to promote lateral root development, independent of
  BR signaling.Red lines show posttranslational activation (arrows) or inhibition
  (bar end) by phosphorylation (+p) or dephosphorylation (-p), and blue lines show
  transcriptional activation (arrows) or inhibition (bar end).
