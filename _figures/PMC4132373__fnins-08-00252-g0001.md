caption: (A) A healthy neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a tripartite synapse composed
  of a motor neuron (MN) terminal synapsing onto a muscle fiber. Terminal Schwann
  cells (TSCs) that envelop the junction have a role in supporting and maintaining
  the motor neuron terminal. (B) Potential endogenous compensatory effects that could
  counteract NMJ instability in ALS. CD44 is upregulated by TSCs in ALS mice and is
  known to encourage IGF-1 production to provide trophic support to damaged muscle
  fibers. CD44 has also been found to colocalize with ErbB, and can amplify the NRG1-ErbB
  pathway with two potential outcomes (1) indirectly via paracrine stimulation of
  the NRG1-ErbB pathway in MN, which is involved in synapse formation/maturation and/or
  (2) directly via NRG1-ErbB pathway in TSCs, which is involved in survival and maintenance
  of TSC (vital for correct synapse function). APP (in muscle) can be cleaved (by
  α-secretase followed by γ-secretase) to form secreted-APP-α (sAPP-α), which can
  bind CRMP2 (and maintain it in a non-phosphorylated, neuroprotective state) resulting
  in stabilization of the neuronal cytoskeleton. sAPP-α is also known to bind SEMA3A
  and prevent its repulsive effects on the nerve terminal (presumably by preventing
  SEMA3A binding to NRP1, which leaves CRMP2 in an unphosphorylated, neuroprotective
  state, thus helping to stabilize the neuronal cytoskeleton). (C) Detrimental effects
  of non-guidance and axon guidance molecules on NMJ stability in ALS. Non-guidance
  molecules (in purple) such as galectin-1 (gal-1; secreted from TSCs) and amyloid
  precursor protein (APP; expressed by damaged muscle fibers) can both directly cause
  synapse degradation (see main text for further detail). Axon guidance molecules
  (in green) like SEMA3A (expressed by TSCs), NOGO-A (expressed by muscle fibers)
  and EPHA4 (expressed by motor neurons) are upregulated in ALS mice. SEMA3A and NOGO-A
  can influence the stability of the neuronal cytoskeleton via activation of the collapsing
  response mediator protein (CRMP)-pathway. SEMA3A does this via interaction with
  neuropilin-1 (NRP1) on the plasma membrane of MN, resulting in the phosphorylation
  of CRMP2. NOGO-A (in muscle) interacts with its receptor, NgR (on MN), to activate
  the CRMP4-RhoA kinase pathway. CRMP2 and CRMP4 can interact directly with cytoskeletal
  proteins (microtubulin and actin respectively) to negatively alter their dynamics.
  EPHA4 (expressed by MN) feeds into the RhoA-kinase pathway, which also regulates
  cytoskeletal dynamics. (D) Potential therapies that target specific molecular components
  of the NMJ to improve NMJ stability in ALS. The administration of trophic factors
  (such as VEGF, IGF-1, and GDNF) has been shown to have direct neuroprotective effects
  and/or effects on TSC survival and maintenance (Krakora et al., ). Administration
  of recombinant gal-1 (gal-1oxd; the oxidized form) is neuroprotective; presumably
  through a mechanism that enhances VEGF-signaling (gal-1oxd binds NRP1, which enhances
  binding of co-receptor VEGFR2). Administration of β-secretase blockers has the potential
  to enhance sAPP-α production (by enhancing the non-amyloidogenic cleavage pathway).
  sAPP-α binds to unphosphorlyated CRMP2 which may help maintain CRMP2 in an non-phosphorylated
  state and thus aid in the stabilization of the neuronal cytoskeleton. Neutralization
  strategies using antibodies directed toward NRP1 (Venkova et al., ) or NOGO-A (Bros-Facer
  et al., ) have the ability to inhibit these signaling pathways, probably by preventing
  phosphorylation of the appropriate CRMPs, and thus enhancing neuronal cytoskeleton
  stabilization. Fasudil, a RhoA-kinase inhibitor, can be administered to prevent
  EPHA4 function by inhibiting the activation of downstream mediators that usually
  lead to the destabilization of the neuronal cytoskeleton. The ideal treatment for
  ALS would therefore combine the various interventions listed above to increase the
  potential success of the therapeutic approach by enhancing the beneficial pathways
  and inhibiting the destructive pathways respectively.
