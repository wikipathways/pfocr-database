caption: Protein interactions for ECM and summary of regulators. (A) Protein-protein
  interaction network for the ‘ECM Organisation’ cluster of co-expressed genes generated
  using STRING. Genes have been highlighted using GO terms. (B) Summary of key chondrogenic
  regulators identified and their relationship to known regulators. Pathway of key
  regulators of hESC-chondrogenesis identified in our analysis using a variety of
  system biology approaches along with known interactions from the literature. IGF1
  is highly co-expressed with several ECM organization associated genes during hESC-chondrogenesis
  and is an upstream regulator of RELA and JUN. Both these TFs have targets enriched
  within the cluster of ECM organization genes. Along with IGF-1, miR-22-3p is also
  highly co-expressed with ECM organization genes during the hESC-differentiation
  and may be promoting hESC-chondrogenesis by targeting HDAC4 and SP1. MiR-29c-3p
  and miR-134-5p were also identified as chondrogenic regulators as they had a significant
  enrichment of targets within the ECM organization cluster and limb development cluster,
  respectively (targets shown below each microRNA). Molecules in green font are positive
  regulators of chondrogenesis while those in red are negative regulators of chondrogenesis.
