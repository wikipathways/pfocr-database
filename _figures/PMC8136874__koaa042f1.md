caption: The shikimate pathway and biosynthesis of AAAs in plants. The shikimate pathway
  leads to biosynthesis of AAAs, which are not only required for protein synthesis
  but also used as precursors of numerous AAA-derived natural products (green letters)
  in plants. The gray lines with an arrowhead or a hash indicate known feedback activation
  or inhibition of the post-chorismate pathways by AAAs, respectively, while double
  arrows denote the multiple reactions. DHS, 3- deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate
  synthase; EPSPS, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase; AS, anthranilate synthase;
  CM, chorismate mutase; TyrA, arogenate dehydrogenase; ADT, arogenate dehydratase;
  E4P, D-erythrose 4-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
