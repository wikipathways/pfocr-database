caption: Schematic overview of the hypoxia pathway under normoxia and hypoxia. The
  hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α subunits are synthesized and subsequently degraded
  under normoxia (blue). In the presence of physiological oxygen levels, prolyl hydroxylase
  domain proteins (PHDs) mediate hydroxylation of HIFs, leading to subsequent binding
  to von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL). VHL facilitates the ubiquitination
  of hydroxylated HIFs, resulting in proteasomal degradation. However, under hypoxia
  (red), the hydroxylation of the alpha subunits is inhibited, stabilizing the HIF-α
  subunits. The stabilized alpha subunits bind to the beta subunit and translocate
  to the nucleus. The HIFs, together with other cofactors, bind hypoxia response elements
  (HREs), promoting the transcription of genes essentially involved in erythropoiesis.
