caption: Dynamic regulation of 4CL in the naringenin synthetic pathway. The strain
  contains one copy of 4CL, four copies of CHS, and four copies of CHI for naringenin
  production from supplemented p-coumarate and malonate. Malonyl-CoA is produced endogenously
  by Acc1-catalyzed carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. A malonate transporter, SpMae1, and
  malonyl-CoA synthetase, RtMatB, were introduced for malonate assimilation to further
  increase the malonyl-CoA supply. The transcriptional repressor FapR was utilized
  to regulate 4CL expression in response to intracellular malonyl-CoA levels, while
  CouR was employed for indirect control of 4CL expression through FapR, in feedback
  to p-coumaroyl-CoA concentrations in the cell.
