caption: 'TOP: Schematic overview of the integrated role of mtFAS in the coordination
  of mitochondrial nutrient supply and metabolism. Acetyl-CoA feeds the TCA cycle
  and mtFAS pathway, where it fuels the generation of octanoyl-ACP as well as longer
  acyl chains (acyl-ACP). Octanoyl-ACP is the precursor for the synthesis of lipoic
  acid, which is an important cofactor for TCA cycle and other mitochondrial enzymes.
  Acyl-ACP supports oxidative chain (OXPHOS) biogenesis via two mechanisms: an undefined
  role in mitochondrial translation, as well as its interaction with the LYR protein
  network. BOTTOM: In complex with Acyl-ACP, LYRs support the assembly of ETC complexes
  and the iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster biogenesis machinery. Specifically, Sdh6 and Sdh7
  (SDHAF1 and SDHAF3) facilitate the assembly of Complex II, Mzm1 (LYRM7) assembles
  Complex III, Fmc1 supports assembly of Complex V, and Isd11 (LYRM4) is an essential
  subunit of a FeS complex biosynthetic complex. In mammals, two additional LYR proteins
  (NDUFA6 and NDUFB9) in complex with acyl-ACP are stable subunits of Complex I.'
