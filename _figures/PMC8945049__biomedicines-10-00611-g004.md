caption: 'PCA of DEGs in AD. The DEGs are shown in black colored text, while red colored
  text represents linker proteins that are fetched from the pathway database to extract
  curated pathways annotation. The “→” indicates activating/catalyzing, while “-|”
  implies inhibitory activity. Functional interactions and predicted functional interactions
  have been shown through “-” and “—”, respectively. The network topology/properties
  are shown as inlet. PCA: Pathway enrichment analysis, DEGs: Differentially expressed
  genes, AD: Alzheimer’s disease.'
