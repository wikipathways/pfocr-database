caption: Aβ-stimulated microglial and monocytic proinflammatory products cause TNFα/iNOS-dependent
  neuronal apoptosis. Binding of Aβ fibrils to microglia initiates a tyrosine kinase-dependent
  signaling response involving Src family members and Syk as membrane proximal signaling
  elements. Src kinases, such as Lyn, mediate the activation of several tyrosine kinase
  activities associated with adhesion and phagocytosis of Aβ fibrils. In parallel,
  Syk kinase activity specifically regulates increased cytokine production in response
  to Aβ stimulation. A separate cytokine regulatory pathway using the proinflammatory
  transcription factor NFκB is also activated on Aβ stimulation to operate independent
  of Src and Syk activation. Aβ-stimulated microglia secrete TNFα plus an additional
  secretory factor(s) to produce neuronal apoptosis. The apoptosis requires iNOS activity
  and correlates with increased expression of iNOS and peroxynitrite.
