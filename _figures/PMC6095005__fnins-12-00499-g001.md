caption: Kynurenine pathway activation in inflammatory conditions. The enzymatic activity
  of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is increased by inflammatory cytokines
  in activated monocytes, macrophages and brain microglia in inflammatory conditions.
  The essential amino acid tryptophan is therefore used for the synthesis of kynurenine,
  and this at the expense of the synthesis of the monoamine serotonin that directly
  depends on the availability of its precursor and limiting factor tryptophan. IDO
  activation might therefore impair serotonin neurotransmission. Kynurenine is then
  used to produce different neuroactive glutamatergic metabolites, including kynurenic
  acid, which is neuroprotective by acting on both glutamatergic NMDA and α7-nicotinic
  acetylcholine (α7-nAChR) receptors, and 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid
  that are rather neurotoxic by promoting oxidative stress and/or activating NMDA
  receptors. As the activity of the kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) that synthesizes
  3-hydroxykynurenine is increased in activated microglia by inflammatory cytokines,
  increased production of kynurenine is ultimately associated with skewing of the
  kynurenine metabolic balance toward increased neurotoxicity. By impairing serotonin
  neurotransmission and promoting neuronal damages, cytokine-induced kynurenine pathway
  activation can therefore contribute to the development of inflammation-driven depressive
  symptoms. TrypOH, tryptophan hydroxylase; KAT, kynurenine aminotransferase; KYNU,
  kynureninase; 3-HAO, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase.
