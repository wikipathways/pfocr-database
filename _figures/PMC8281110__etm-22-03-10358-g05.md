caption: 'Schematic model of m6A in regulating osteosarcoma. (A) Upper: METTL3 knockdown
  inhibits the expression of ATPase family ATAD2, and the proliferation and invasion
  of OS cells. Middle: METTL3 knockdown decreases m6A methylation and total mRNA levels
  of LEF1, followed by the inhibition of the activity of Wnt/b-catenin signalling
  pathway, such that the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of OS cells
  are inhibited. Lower: METTL3 knockdown decreases m6A and Drg1 mRNA levels, thereby
  decreasing both the mRNA and protein levels of DRG1, such that the migration and
  colony formation abilities of OS cells are inhibited. (B) ALKBH5 decreases the m6A
  modification of PVT1, thereby inhibiting the binding of reader protein YTHDF2 in
  PVT1 and suppressing PVT1 degradation, such that OS cell proliferation and tumour
  growth are promoted. m6A, RNA N6-methyladenine; METTL, methyltransferase-like; ATAD2,
  AAA domain-containing protein 2; OS, osteosarcoma; LEF1, lymphoid enhancer-binding
  factor 1; DRG1, GTP-binding protein 1; ALHBH5, α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase
  alkB homologue 5; YTHDF, YTH domain family.'
