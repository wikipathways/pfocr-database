caption: 'Differentially expressed genes in digestion and metabolism pathway between
  grass carp before and after food habit transition from transcriptome analysis. The
  most important pathways are insulin signaling and PPAR signaling (A), pancreatic
  secretion (B), protein digestion and absorption (C), bile secretion (D), gastric
  acid secretion (E). The colors of rectangles were shaded according to the different
  expression (red: the mRNA expression levels of fish in Group C were significantly
  higher than those in Group A (FDR ≤ 0.001, the absolute value of log2[Ratio] ≥ 1);
  green: the mRNA expression levels of fish in Group C were significantly lower than
  those in Group A (FDR ≤ 0.001, the absolute value of log2[Ratio] ≥ 1)). All of these
  genes were not differentially expressed between Groups A and B.'
