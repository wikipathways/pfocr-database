caption: 'Increases in pathological levels and oligomeric forms of RAGE ligands characterize
  the transition from health and homeostasis to disease- mediating activities in microglia
  during the progression of AD, PD, ALS and MS. These pathological RAGE ligands promote
  RAGE-DIAPH1 signaling-induced oxidative stress, cytokine production, gliosis, and
  inflammation. Inflammatory cell activation further induces increased RAGE and RAGE
  ligand expression, while decreasing innate detoxifiers, thereby promoting an inflammatory
  feed-forward loop resulting in strikingly higher degrees of inflammatory gliosis,
  neuronal stress, BBB dysfunction and, eventually, neuronal death. We posit that
  activation of the AGE-RAGE-DIAPH1 axis in microglia is an amplifying event and critical
  final common pathway driving increased cellular stress and inflammation leading
  to neurodegeneration and the progression of AD, PD, ALS and MS. Abbreviations: AD,
  Alzheimer’s disease; AGEs, advanced glycation end products; ALS, Amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis; BBB, blood-brain barrier; HMGB1, high mobility group box protein 1; MS,
  Multiple Sclerosis; and PD, Parkinson’s disease.'
