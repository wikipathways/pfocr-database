caption: Signal crosstalk with Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator
  with a PDZ-binding domain (TAZ). Wnt signaling activates YAP and TAZ by inhibiting
  the formation of the β-catenin destruction complex that in some instances functions
  as a cytoplasmic sink and causes degradation of YAP and TAZ. Nuclear YAP can form
  a complex with β-catenin and the transcription factor TBX5 to promote antiapoptotic
  gene expression, including BCL2L1 and BIRC5. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling
  is relayed via small G proteins. Activation of Gα12/13 and Gαq/11 induces YAP and
  TAZ nuclear translocation and activity, whereas active Gαs represses YAP and TAZ
  nuclear activity, which causes either activation or inhibition of large tumor suppressor
  (LATS) kinase activity. The family of epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligands activates
  YAP and TAZ in both a LATS-dependent and -independent manner. EGF receptor (EGFR)
  stimulation inhibits the kinase module by dissociating phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase-1 (PDK1) from the Hippo pathway components [LATS, mammalian STE20-like protein
  kinase 1 (MST), and Salvador family WW domain-containing protein 1 (SAV1)], preventing
  activation of LATS by MST. EGFR–Ras–MAPK signaling also enhances the AJUBA family
  protein Wilms’ tumor protein 1-interacting protein (WTIP) binding to LATS, which
  inhibits LATS activity toward YAP. In addition, a cytoplasmic intracellular domain
  of the ERRB4 receptor (ICD-ERBB4) is cleaved and released on neuregulin 1 (NRG1)
  stimulation, which in turn binds to YAP and promotes target gene expression. On
  transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signal activation, nuclear YAP and TAZ form
  a complex with SMAD2, SMAD3, and TEA domain family (TEAD) transcription factors,
  coordinating a protumorigenic transcriptional program. YAP and TAZ also directly
  promote transcription of several receptors and ligands to mediate endocrine and
  paracrine signal crosstalk and potential feedback loops. Notable examples are the
  Wnt signal inhibitor DKK1, ligands of the BMP/TGFβ family BMP4, the EGF-like growth
  factor AREG, NOTCH2, the Notch ligand Jagged1 (JAG1), integrin/extracellular matrix
  (ECM) signaling components such as β2-integrin (ITGB2) and the α5 subunit of laminin
  511 (LAMA5), and the focal adhesion component zyxin (ZYX).
