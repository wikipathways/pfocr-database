caption: Pathways involved in the protective effect of D2R in the kidney. D2R stimulation,
  either by G-protein-dependent or G-protein-independent, β-arrestin-2- dependent
  pathways, increases the expression of miR-217, which downregulates the expression
  of Wnt5a and by a Wnt non-canonical pathway decreases the transcription of TGF-β1
  and results in a decrease in fibrosis. The D2R β-arrestin-2-dependent pathway causes
  the recruitment of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) and serine/threonine kinase AKT
  to the β-arrestin-2/D2R complex. PP2A dephosphorylates and inactivates AKT. AKT
  downregulates the expression of NF-kB and the transcription of a number of inflammatory
  factors. AKT also regulates through phosphorylation glycogen synthase kinase β (GSK3β),
  another key signaling kinase. In its non-phosphorylated state, GSK3β is constitutively
  active, whereas AKT-induced phosphorylation inactivates GSK3β and inhibits β-catenin-driven
  changes in gene expression, including Wnt3a, resulting in the regulation of cell
  proliferation.
