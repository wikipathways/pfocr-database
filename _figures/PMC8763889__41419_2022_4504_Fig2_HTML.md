caption: 'TFF3 affects apoptosis (A) and cell cycle progression (B) by activating
  MAPK, NF-κB, PI3K, STAT3, and HIF-1α signaling pathways. TFF3 does not bind to EGFR,
  but it can induce its phosphorylation. Treatment with the specific EGFR inhibitors
  tyrphostin A25 and AG1478 can significantly inhibit TFF3-induced cell survival and
  proliferation. C The promoter region of TFF3 contains the binding sites of HIF-1α
  and STAT3, which enables TFF3 to achieve self-induction. On the one hand, TFF3 enhanced
  the induction of VEGF by HIF-1α; on the other hand, it induced IL-8 expression via
  STAT3 to promote angiogenesis. D TFF3 regulates the expression of proteins related
  to cell migration by activating the MAPK, NF-κB, PI3K, STAT3, mTOR, and HIF-1α signaling
  pathways. CXCR, TX2A-R, and PG-R are involved in this biological effect of TFF3.
  Although TFF3 does not directly bind to TXA2-R and PG-R, it may activate them by
  increasing the expression of COX or COX derivatives such as prostaglandin E(2) and
  prostaglandin I(2). The combination of TFF3 and CXCR4/7 can induce cell migration;
  however, the signaling pathway underlying this effect remains to be verified. Established
  functions are denoted by solid arrows, whereas unidentified pathways are indicated
  by question marks. PRINS: psoriasis susceptibility-related RNA gene induced by stress;
