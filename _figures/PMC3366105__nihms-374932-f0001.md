caption: SLOS patients experience a broad range of biochemical consequences stemming
  from elevated 7-DHC and deficiency in cholesterol. As cholesterol is a precursor
  in the synthesis of steroid hormones, bile acids and oxysterols, these compounds
  may be deficient in SLOS patients. Conversely atypical sterols, oxysterols, steroid
  hormones and bile acids are formed from 7- and 8-DHC. Atypical bile acids appear
  to be formed in “acidic pathway” via 27-hydroxylation; formation of 27-hydroxylated
  7- and 8-DHC () and conversion to 3β-hydroxycholestandienoic acids () has been demonstrated.*Can
  isomerize to form 8-DHC.
