caption: Dlp regulates synaptic plasticity at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction
  (NMJ). (A) The body wall muscles of Drosophila larva are innervated by type I glutamatergic
  motor neurons, which form synaptic boutons at the NMJs. Most larval body wall muscles
  are also innervated by octopaminergic type II neurons. (B) When larvae are placed
  under food deprivation conditions, octopamine is released from the type II boutons,
  and type II arbors rapidly extend new branches called synaptopods through the activation
  of Octβ2R octopamine autoreceptors. The acute acceleration of octopamine signaling
  by the growth of type II boutons leads to the rapid growth of type I boutons, which
  also express Octβ2R, and the increase of larval locomotor speed. (C) The expression
  of Dlp, which is a homolog of mammalian GPC4 and GPC6, is downregulated by octopamine
  signaling. Dlp suppresses the non-canonical BMP pathway that is composed of BMP
  receptor Wit and GluRIIA-containing iGluRs. Starvation-induced octopamine signaling
  downregulates Dlp expression, which leads to the activation of the non-canonical
  BMP signaling.
