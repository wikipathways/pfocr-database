caption: Nrf2 is an important factor to reduce oxidative stress injury of hair cells.
  Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is anchored in the cytoplasm by Keap1 and is rapidly
  degraded by ubiquitination. However, Nrf2 is disconnected from Keap1 and translocates
  into the nucleus after the action of oxidative stress. Antioxidant drugs have been
  found to promote the intracellular translocation of Nrf2 and the transcription of
  downstream antioxidant products after Nrf2 bound to ARE. After activation of Keap1-Nrf2-ARE
  signaling axis, antioxidant factors such as HO-1 can reduce the intracellular ROS
  level mediated by NIHL, ARHL and ototoxic hearing loss, thereby protecting hair
  cells and reducing hearing loss. Moreover, there is a positive feedback between
  p62-mediated autophagy and Nrf2. p62 destroyed the connection between Keap1 and
  Nrf2 to promote the accumulation of Nrf2 and nuclear translocation. Concurrently,
  increased Nrf2 promotes p62 expression. In addition, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway
  is also involved in the intracellular translocation of Nrf2 in hair cells. However,
  in the study on hearing loss, the relationship between other signaling pathways
  and Nrf2 expression is still not fully understood.
