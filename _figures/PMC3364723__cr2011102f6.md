caption: Hypothetical model of mir-35 family function during cell cycle. (A) In the
  intestinal cells, the mir-35 family suppresses Rb/E2F and SCF pathways to promote
  the entry of S-phase. lin-23 may be the direct target of mir-35 in the SCF pathway,
  while in the Rb/E2F pathway, the direct target is unknown. (B) In the distal gonad,
  the mir-35 family targets gld-1 to repress the germ line mitosis.
