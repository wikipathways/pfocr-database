caption: A schematic representation of potential mechanisms by which resistin may
  mediate cardiovascular dysfunction. Resistin possibly binds to the membrane bound
  TLR4 receptor, which then activates the intracellular signalling pathway. Resistin
  can activate the translocation of NFκB into the nucleus, which in turn, activates
  the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, contributing to the proliferation
  of VSMCs and endothelial dysfunction. Activation of NFκB can also be mediated by
  the resistin-induced activation of PI3K/AKT pathway. Resistin can also stimulate
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through MAPK p38 and JNK. Resistin
  can cause oxidative stress, which is another factor for MAPK activation and eNOS
  inhibition. Resistin increases the production of superoxide anions, which inhibit
  eNOS gene expression and reduce bioavailability of NO. VSMC proliferation and endothelial
  dysfunction including impaired vasorelaxation, enhanced thrombosis, hyper-permeability,
  angiogenesis and increased cell adhesion collectively contribute to the formation
  of atherosclerosis. Solid red arrows indicates activation, while broken blue lines
  indicate inhibition. eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal
