caption: Gut microbiome imbalance disrupts the gut-lung axis. When SARS-CoV-2 infects
  the lungs, it activates Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on alveolar macrophages by recognizing
  microbial patterns such as Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from pathogens. This triggers
  the Nuclear Factor Kappa- B Cells (NF-κB) signalling pathway, which promotes the
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including Interleukin-1 Beta (IL-1β) and
  Interleukin-18 (IL-18). These cytokines drive the formation of the inflammasome
  (Nod-Like Receptor Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3), ASC (Apoptosis-Associated
  Speck-Like Protein Containing a CARD) and Pro-Caspase-1), a protein complex that
  activates Caspase-1, leading to more IL-1β and IL-18 secretion and amplifying inflammation.
  In the gut, SARS-CoV-2-associated dysbiosis leads to an increase in pathogenic bacteria
  and bacterial components like Peptidoglycan (PGN) and LPS, which further activate
  TLRs. This induces inflammation in the gut epithelium and contributes to systemic
  immune activation. The cytokines and microbial products from the gut enter the circulation,
  exacerbating inflammation in the lungs and contributing to a cytokine storm, a life-threatening
  systemic inflammatory response. The immune response also involves T cells and B
  cells. Naïve T cells are polarized into T Helper Type 1 (Th1) and T Helper Type
  17 (Th17) cells, releasing cytokines such as Interferon-Gamma (IFN-γ), Interleukin-6
  (IL-6), Interleukin-17 (IL-17), Interleukin-21 (IL-21), Interleukin-22 (IL-22),
  Interleukin-23 (IL-23), and Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α). These cytokines
  cause tissue damage in both the gut and lungs, worsening the barrier function of
  the intestinal and pulmonary epithelia
