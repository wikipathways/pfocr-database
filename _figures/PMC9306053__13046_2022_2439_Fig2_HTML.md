caption: Mechanism of TME affecting the mitochondrial function of CD8+ T cells. (The
  red arrows indicate promotion, and the green arrows indicate inhibition) ①Glucose
  competition and lactic acid accumulation increase the glycolysis stress of CD8+
  T cells. ②Hypoxia inhibits OXPHOS and increases oxidative stress. ③Released K+ and
  metabolic waste PEG2, and adenosine interfere with the activity of the mTOR pathway.
  ④Certain fatty acids can directly damage mitochondrial structures. ⑤Soluble Fas
  released from tumor cells activates mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptotic processes
