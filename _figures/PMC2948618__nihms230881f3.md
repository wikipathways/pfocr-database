caption: (A) In response to DNA damage Eukaryotic cells activate a complex signaling
  network to arrest cell cycle, initiate repair, or induce apoptosis. In addition
  to ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 a third DNA damage signaling pathway mediated by p38 MAPK-activation
  of MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2). Adapted and reprinted with permission from Mol Cell. 2005
  Jan 7;17(1):37-48. (B) Detailed knowledge of DNA damage induced signaling pathways
  has great potential for personalized cancer treatments. Using Xengraft models Yaffe
  and colleagues have demonstrated that ATM inhibition can result in either pronounced
  chemoresistance or chemosensitization to DNA damaging agents. They have demonstrated
  how DNA damage signaling networks can be rewired and showed how pathway focused
  diagnostics can be used to successfully predict therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment.
