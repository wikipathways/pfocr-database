caption: 'Mechanisms of action of blockade of inhibitory pathways or activation of
  costimulatory pathways to promote CD8+T cell priming after vaccination. Antagonist
  antibodies targeting checkpoint inhibitors may act at different steps during T cell
  priming or the antitumor activities of CD8+T cells: (i) Blocking CTLA-4, GITR or
  PD-L1/L2 or activating CD40, CD70 switches dendritic cells from tolerogenic to mature
  professional antigen-presenting cells that are efficient for CD8+T cell priming;
  (ii) Inhibition of the CTLA-4 and CD80-CD86 interaction promotes the CD28/CD80-CD86
  costimulatory pathway; (iii) Inhibition of Treg via targeting of CTLA-4, PD-1, OX40,
  GITR alleviates the suppressor activity of these cells on effector CD8+T cells;
  (iv) Blockade of the interaction of PD-1/PD-L1 or Tim-3.'
