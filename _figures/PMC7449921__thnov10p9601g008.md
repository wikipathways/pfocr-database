caption: Working model of how MAD2 downregulation promotes asymmetric division and
  reduces tumor growth and invasion in MKN45 cell line. CSCs with high levels of MAD2
  (left) enhances symmetric division and increases tumor growth by activating the
  signaling pathway CXCR4-SNAI2-MMP1. Targeting MAD2, with shMAD2L1 or M2i-1 inhibitor
  (right), could downregulate this pathway, promoting GCSC asymmetric division and
  lower metastasis, and as a consequence, decreasing GCSC tumorigenic capacity.
