caption: A. The MUC1-C→NF-B p65 circuit activates transcription of the DNMT1 and DNMT3b,
  but not DNMT3a, genes and thereby regulates global DNA methylation patterns. The
  MUC1-C→NF-κB p65→DNMT1/3b pathway also induces DNA methylation of the CDH1 promoter
  in association with suppression of E-cadherin expression. In addition, MUC1-C induces
  BMI1 transcription by a MYC-dependent mechanism and increases BMI1 expression by
  ZEB1-mediated suppression of miR-200c. MUC1-C binds to BMI1 and promotes ubiquitinylation
  of H2A (H2AUb1) and suppression of the BMI1 target gene, CDKN2A, with downregulation
  of p16INK4a expression. Activation of BMI1 has been associated with cancer progression
  as a result of increases in self-renewal capacity, stem-like cells and genomic instability.
  B. The MUC1-C program activates the NF-κB p65 circuit and in turn integrates induction
  of (i) ZEB1 and EMT, (ii) the epigenetic regulators DNMT1/3b and BIM1, and (iii)
  PD-L1, an effector of immune evasion.
