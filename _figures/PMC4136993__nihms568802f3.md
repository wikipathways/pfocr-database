caption: 'An example of a brain-immune system physiological system: the cholinergic
  anti-inflammatory reflex. Afferent fibers within the vagus nerve convey information
  from the intestinal myeloid (such as dendritic cells, DC) and glomus cells to the
  nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. Following activation of a number
  of neuronal circuits in medulla, the efferent vagus signals to ganglia in the viscera
  (e.g., celiac plexus) leading to activation of the splenic nerve. These nerve fibers
  are noradrenergic, so the release of norepinephrine in the spleen is increased.
  Norepinephrine stimulates the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), an enzyme
  that is needed for the formation of acetylcholine. Splenic T cells express ChAT,
  leading to an increase in splenic acetylcholine. This leukocyte-derived neurotransmitter
  binds to α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChR) that are expressed on macrophages,
  resulting in the inhibition of TNFα synthesis. Note that an intraperitoneal inflammatory
  stimulus also activates the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, resulting in the release
  of adrenal glucocorticoids from the adrenal gland. This pathway inhibits dendritic
  cell and splenic inflammatory responses.'
