caption: 'The miRNA–mRNA interaction networks containing two matrix connectivity (a)
  and (b) represent the miRNA–mRNA interaction networks with three cell junction (focal
  adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, gap junction) and two matrix connectivity (tight
  junction, and adherens junction) related pathways, respectively. The dot indicates
  miRNA, and the box indicates a target gene that had a negative correlation with
  a given miRNA. Red indicates up-regulated, green indicates down-regulated, and yellow
  indicates a miRNA that was up-regulated in a given comparison combination and was
  down-regulated in other comparison combinations. The five pathways are focal adhesion,
  ECM-receptor interaction, gap junction, tight junction, and adherens junction. The
  miRNA–mRNA pairs in each pathway are shown in Additional file : Table S3'
