caption: Fronto-striatal circuits originate in the frontal cortex and pass through
  the basal ganglia, which project via the thalamus back to frontal brain areas. Output
  neurons in the striatum are medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which consist of direct
  pathway and indirect pathway neurons. The direct pathway neurons inhibit tonically
  active neurons in globus pallidus interna (GPi)/substantia nigra pars reticulata
  (SNr). The indirect pathway neurons activate neurons in GPi/SNr via inhibition of
  the globus pallidus externa (GPe) and activation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN).
  Direct and indirect pathway neurons induce opposing effects on the output neurons
  in GPi/SNr, resulting in disinhibition and proinhibition of output, respectively.
  Within the basal ganglia all projections are GABAergic except those from the STN.
  Main phosphodiesterases (PDEs) expressed in fronto-striatal circuits are PDE1B,
  PDE4, and PDE10A. PDE1B is generally colocalized with dopamine (DA) D1 receptors
  in the brain and thought to represent a major inactivation mechanism of D1 receptors.
  By acting like a DA D1 agonist PDE1B-Is can enhance phosphorylation of cAMP response
  element binding protein (CREB) as well as Dopamine- and cAMP-Regulated PhosphoProtein
  MR 32kDa (DARPP-32) enhancing synaptic transmission (e.g., AMPA receptors), neuron
  excitability, and synapto- and neurogenesis, resulting in neuroplasticity and neuroprotective
  effects at glutamatergic frontal and fronto-striatal synapses. Regarding fronto-striatal
  signaling, the effect of PDE4 inhibition on cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling,
  is linked to indirect pathway adenosine A2a receptor signaling and has no major
  role in D1 receptor direct pathway signaling. An opposite situation is observed
  at frontal dopaminergic signaling. In the frontal cortex, PDE4 is –just as PDE1B-
  localized at DARPP-32 expressing neurons. In contrast to the striatum, PDE4 inhibition
  enhances DA D1 receptor-induced phosphorylation of DARPP-32 in the frontal cortex,
  indicating a prominent role of PDE4 in frontal DA receptor signaling. Finally, DA
  release from DAergic midbrain terminals can be influenced with a PDE4 inhibitor
  as DA is expressed at DAergic terminals in neurons of the SNc in which cAMP has
  been reported to be a strong inducer of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene transcription
  rate and mRNA affecting DA synthesis and release. In direct pathway neurons, PDE10A
  inhibition activates cAMP/PKA signaling related to D1 receptor signaling, whereas
  in indirect pathway neurons PDE10A inhibition activates cAMP/PKA signaling by simultaneous
  potentiation of adenosine A2A receptor signaling and inhibition of D2 receptor signaling.
  Effects of PDE10A inhibition are suggested to predominate the indirect pathway.
  In contrast to PDE4 inhibition, PDE10A inhibition does not increase TH phosphorylation
  and therefore has no effects on DA synthesis and release. Nevertheless, it cannot
  be ruled out that selective PDE inhibitors (PDE-Is) might influence both the direct
  and indirect pathway via enhancing the release of DA from frontal DAergic projections
  depending on the –to be determined- presence of PDEs in these terminals.In striatal
  interneurons containing nitric oxide synthase (NOS), nitric oxide (NO) is produced
  and diffuses into dendrites of MSNs which contain high levels of guanylate cyclase
  (GC), which, when activated, lead to the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate
  (cGMP). In the striatum, transient elevations in intracellular cGMP, next to cAMP,
  primarily act to increase neuronal excitability and to facilitate glutamatergic
  fronto-striatal transmission. Thus, inhibition of selective PDE subtypes can also
  target the cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) pathway and have an effect on fronto-striatal
  functioning.
