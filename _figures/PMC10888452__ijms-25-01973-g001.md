caption: A schematic representation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and its activation.
  This pathway can be activated by various extracellular stimuli, including the GTP-mediated
  binding complex induced by chemokines or RTK-mediated complex (GF, EGF, FGF, etc.).
  Activated PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3, a process that is inhibited by PTEN.
  PIP3 then activates PDK1, which in turn activates AKT. AKT contains two binding
  domains at S474, which can be inhibited by PHLPP, and T308, which can be inhibited
  by PP2A. Some known stimulators of AKT include TRAP4 and mTORC2. Activated AKT contains
  over 100 effector molecules and is directly involved in cell growth arrest, increased
  protein translation, increased transcription, impaired DNA repair mechanisms, decreased
  apoptosis, and increased glucose metabolism. Created with BioRender.com
