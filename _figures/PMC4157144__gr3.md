caption: L-Serine Biosynthesis PathwayDe novo biosynthesis of serine is crucial to
  provide the organism with sufficient levels of this amino acid. The first and limiting
  step of this pathway is the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypiruvate
  by PHGDH (encoded by PHGDH). This is followed by the conversion of 3-phosphohydroxypiruvate
  to O-phosphoserine by PSAT (encoded by PSAT1). This reaction is accompanied by the
  transformation of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate and requires the presence of pyridoxal
  phosphate (PLP). The final step in serine biosynthesis is catalyzed by PSPH (encoded
  by PSPH), which gives rise to L-serine, the final product of this pathway.
