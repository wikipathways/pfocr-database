caption: Decorin induces autophagy in endothelial cells. (A) Graphical representation
  of the pathway by which decorin elicits the induction of canonical autophagy in
  endothelial cells. A more detailed explanation of the pathway is included in the
  text. (B) LC3-staining of aortic endothelial cells treated with 40 nM rapamycin,
  a well-documented autophagic inducer, and 200 nM decorin, a small, leucine-rich
  proteoglycan as compared to vehicle-treated cells. Note the similarity in LC3-localization
  in the rapamycin and decorin-treated cells (white arrows). Bar = 10 mm
