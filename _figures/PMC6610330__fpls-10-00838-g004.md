caption: Model illustrating potential effects of cold stress on membrane lipid pathway
  in peanut. Under cold stress, there is an increase in the content of PA, PI, DAG,
  and DGDG (the red words), but a decrease in the content of PC, PE, PG, MGDG, and
  SQDG (the blue words). The main pathways to rapid cold-induced PA formation include
  the activity of GPAT is up regulated in the de novo biosynthesis of phospholipids
  (1), enhanced hydrolysis of PC by PLD resulted from the increase of PLD activity
  (2), the phosphorylation of PLC-generated DAG from PPI leads to DAG accumulation,
  which might cause an increased content of PA as a result from phosphorylation of
  DAG by DGK (3), or the inhibition of PAH/PAP activity by DAG (4). The activity of
  PECT is proposed to be down regulated by cold stress, and this would lead to reduced
  PE formation (5). As a second messenger, PA can inhibit the activity of PEAMT, thereby
  blocking the synthesis pathway of PC (6). During cold stress, the requirement for
  eukaryotic galactolipid biosynthesis is reduced and the activity of DGAT is upregulated,
  excess PC is converted to DAG and subsequently acylated to 18:1-, 18:2-, and 18:3-rich
  molecular species of TAG, which are contained in cytoplasmic oil bodies (o.b.).
  Simultaneously, turnover of MGDG in the chloroplast results in accumulation of low
  amounts of 16:3-containing, chloroplastic TAG (7). The red and blue boxes, respectively,
  represent the up-regulation and inhibition of the enzyme activities, the enzyme
  activities in orange boxes have no significant change or are not very clear yet
  before and after cold stress. AAPT, aminoalcohol phosphotransferase; CDP-ETA, cytidine
