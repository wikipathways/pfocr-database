caption: Genetic events involved in thyroid tumor initiation and progression. Thyroid
  cell proliferation depends on the combined activation of cAMP/PKA, MAPK, and PI3K
  pathways, induced by TSH and other growth factors. Mutations of effectors along
  these signaling pathways play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of thyroid neoplasia.
  The figure represents a thyroid epithelial cell with the basal and apical membrane,
  and shows the tight and adherens junctions (TJ and AJ) between cells in order to
  form follicular structures. Activating mutations in TSHR or Gαs lead to constitutive
  activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway and give rise to hyperfunctional adenomas. There
  is evidence that constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway is required for PTC
  initiation. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is required for FTC initiation. Finally,
  deregulation of the p53 pathway and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is observed in ATC
  and has more to do with tumor progression.
