caption: 'Upper panel: Under normal physiological conditions, both EGFR/MAPK and InR/Pi3K/TOR
  pathways act in progenitor cells to control their proliferation and growth. But
  only the InR/Pi3K/TOR pathway, and not the EGFR/MAPK pathway, is active in ECs to
  promote their growth with endoreplication. Lower panel: During infection-induced
  regeneration, EGFR/MAPK signaling is strongly induced in progenitor cells and inherited
  by their progeny. This results in hyperproliferation of ISCs and hypertrophy and
  higher ploidy in ECs. EGFR/MAPK signaling post-transcriptionally up-regulates E2f1
  to induce this EC endorelplication.'
