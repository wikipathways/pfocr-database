caption: Working model showing the multiple roles of Ypd1p in the osmotic response
  signal transduction pathway. Phosphotransfer, the transfer of a phosphoryl group
  from the receiver domain of Sln1 to the conserved histidine 64 in Ypd1p; shuttling,
  the movement of Ypd1p in and out of the nucleus. The diagram shows the translocation
  of the phospho form of Ypd1p; however, the dephospho form of Ypd1p may likewise
  be involved. Phosphorylation, the transfer of the Ypdp1 phosphoryl group to the
  conserved aspartates in the receiver domains of the nuclear Skn7p and cytoplasmic
  Ssk1p (not labeled) response regulators. Phosphorylation of Skn7p leads to activation
  of SLN1-SKN7-dependent gene expression, and phosphorylation of Ssk1p leads to negative
  regulation of the HOG1 MAP kinase cascade and the maintenance of viability.
