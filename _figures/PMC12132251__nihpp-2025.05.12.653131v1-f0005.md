caption: 'Functional integrative gene-based enrichment for genes annotated to the
  meta-analyzed hypo- and hyper-methylated CpGs consistent across all three studies
  and across all LF phenotypes: GACRS, CAMP and VDAART. Nodes are the genes; rectangles
  are the enriched terms. Each library source for the gene-based term enrichment is
  given a different color: Gene ontology (GO) Biological process (Red), KEGG (Blue),
  GWAS Catalog (Green) and DisGeNET (Purple), and the gradient is based on the z-score
  (the darker, the higher z-score). The hypo-methylated sub-network was enriched for
  biological processes: cell migration and adhesion, embryonic development; KEGG pathways:
  Calcium signaling, Glycolysis and Rap1 signaling; GWAS associations: post-bronchodilator
  FEV1/FVC ratio, type 2 diabetes, neurocognitive behaviors. The hyper-methylated
  sub-network was enriched for biological process: amino acid transport; KEGG pathways:
  B-cell receptor signaling, ErbB signaling, Aldosterone synthesis/secretion and Notch
  signaling pathway; GWAS associations: Obesity related traits, insulin resistance
  and age-related macular degeneration. A. Enrichment analysis for gene list based
  on hypo-methylated CpGs; B. Enrichment analysis for gene list based on hyper-methylated
