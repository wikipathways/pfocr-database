caption: Cross-regulation of intracellular membrane-associated proteins and microRNAs
  in B cell differentiation. (a) Regulation of multiple intracellular membrane-associated
  proteins as well as AID (critical for CSR/SHM) and Blimp-1 (driving plasma cell
  differentiation) by a single microRNA. For example, miR-30a regulates Atg5, Beclin
  1 and Atg12 in autophagy and Blimp-1, miR-30c regulates Rab7 (in the endosome pathway)
  and AID, as well, miR-93 and miR-181b regulate AID as well as Atg16L1 and Atg5,
  respectively. (b) Regulation of one intracellular membrane-associated protein by
  several microRNAs. For example, Rab7 is regulated by both miR-30c and miR-302b,
  and Atg12 is regulated by both miR-30a and miR-23b. (c) Regulation of microRNA activities
  by endosomes and autophagosomes. Endosomes provide a structure to support the assembly
  of RISC in microRNA-mediated gene silencing. Autophagosomes promote degradation
  of Dicer and Ago, thereby downregulating microRNA biogenesis and functions, respectively.
