caption: The interaction between membrane-associated catalase and aquaporins of tumor
  cells. (A). Catalase prevents HOCl signaling and influx of H2O2 through aquaporins.
  NOX1-derived superoxide anions (#1) are dismutated by membrane-associated SOD (#2)
  or spontaneously. The resultant H2O2 is decomposed by membrane-associated catalase
  (#3). A minor concentration of H2O2 may escape the action of immobilized catalase
  and enter the tumor cells through aquaporins (AP) (#4). This is required for proliferation
  stimulation. Membrane-associated dual oxidase (DUOX) releases its peroxidase domain
  (POD) through the action of matrix metalloproteases (#5). As long as catalase is
  acting, the potential generation of HOCl through H2O2/POD interaction (#6), as well
  as hydroxyl radical generation through the reaction between HOCl and superoxide
  anions (#7) do not take place. The xC transporter transports cystine into the cells
  for the exchange of glutamate (#9). Cystine is reduced to L-cysteine (#9). Gamma-glutamylcyseine
  synthase combines L-cysteine and L-glutamate (#10) to γ glutamylcysteine (γ-GluCys).
  Glutathione synthase then completes the formation of glutathione (GSH) (#11). Glutathione
  and Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) effectively decompose H2O2, peroxynitrite and repair
  lipid peroxides in the membranes. (B). Consequences of catalase inhibition. Inhibition
  of catalase (#1) allows the influx of H2O2 through aquaporins (#2). GPX/GSH decompose
  H2O2 (#3), gradually leading to consumption of GSH and inhibition of GPX. The action
  of the xC transporter and glutathione synthesis (#4–8) counteraction consumption
  of GSH. The second consequence of catalase inhibition is the reactivation of HOCl
  signaling (#9–11), which is finalized by hydroxyl radical-mediated lipid peroxidation
  (LPO). As long as GPx/GSH are functional, they counteract lipid peroxidation (#12)
  and in this way prevent apoptosis induction. (C). Final steps. As soon as influx
  of H2O2 through aquaporins has depleted glutathione and inactivated GPx (#2–3),
  HOCl signaling and lipid peroxidation (#4–6) are no longer counteracted by GPx/GSH
  and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is induced (#7).
