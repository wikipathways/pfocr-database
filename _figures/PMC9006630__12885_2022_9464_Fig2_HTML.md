caption: Melatonin synthesis pathway. Tryptophan is hydroxylated by tryptophan hydroxylase
  (TPH) to 5-hydroxytryptophan which is subsequently decarboxylated by aromatic amino
  acid decarboxylase (AADC) resulting in serotonin. Serotonin is converted to N-acetylserotonin
  by Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT) which is then catalyzed by N-acetylserotonin
  O-methyltransferase (ASMT) to produce melatonin
