caption: Model for p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis. In response to DNA
  damage, cells sense DNA breaks and activate repair, cell cycle delay, and apoptosis.
  Following DNA damage, TEFU/dATM and MEI-41/dATR kinases activate MNK/dChk2 and p53
  to induce apoptosis (orange boxes). p53 regulates the pro-apoptotic genes hid and
  rpr, resulting in caspase activation (red box). GRP/dChk1 promotes cell cycle delay,
  allowing time for DNA repair. Incorrect repair of chromosome breaks followed by
  progression through mitosis will result in cells with reduced copy number of large
  chromosome regions (segmental aneuploidy). Haploinsufficiency of genes encoding
  ribosomal proteins or other products can induce apoptosis by ectopic brk expression,
  JNK pathway activation, and induction of hid expression. Other apoptotic mechanisms
  may also act to remove aneuploid cells (not shown).
