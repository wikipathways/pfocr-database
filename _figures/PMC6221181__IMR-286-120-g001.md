caption: 'Glucocorticoids regulate NK cells and ILC1s functions upon MCMV infection.
  MCMV infection induces the activation of the HPA axis: the hypothalamus produces
  the corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CHR), which activates the pituitary gland to
  release the adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) which, finally, induces the secretion
  of glucocorticoids (GCs) into the bloodstream by the adrenal gland. Signaling transduced
  by different combinations of cytokines and other unidentified potential mediators
  in the spleen and liver microenvironment differentially cooperates with the glucocorticoid
  receptor (GR) to regulate transcription. As a result, the control of gene expression
  in NK cells and ILC1s is both tissue and cell type specific: the genes induced by
  the GR pathway in each cellular target are highlighted in green (Down in GRNcr1‐iCre),
  while the genes repressed by the GR pathway are in red (Up in GRNcr1‐iCre). The
  GR pathway inhibits IFN‐γ production only in NK cells in the spleen through the
  induction of PD1 expression. This regulation is required to prevent immunopathology
  in the spleen, without affecting antiviral response'
