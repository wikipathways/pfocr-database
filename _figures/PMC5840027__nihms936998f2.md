caption: Therapeutic targeting of human lncRNAsThe schematic summarizes different
  approaches to target lncRNAs in the nucleus and cytoplasm.a) Transcriptional inhibition
  can be attained through classical CRISPR/Cas9 to delete regions of interest in lncRNA
  loci. Alternatively, dead-Cas9 fused to a repressor complex can inhibit transcription
  of lncRNA genes.b) Transcriptional upregulation of tumor suppressors can be attained
  through knockdown of the corresponding Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATs). NATs
  can be targeted post-transcriptionally using ASOs.c) ASOs can also be used to post-transcriptionally
  knockdown lncRNAs that are overexpressed in cancers.d) Post-transcriptional silencing
  can also be achieved by siRNAs targeting lncRNAs. SiRNAs stimulate Dicer activity
  in the cytoplasm and recruit RISC complex (RNA Induced Silencing Complex) to post-transcriptionaly
  degrade target RNAse) Steric inhibition of lncRNA-protein interactions can be achieved
  using small molecules, morpholinos, or uniformly-modified ASOs that cannot stimulate
  an RNA degradation pathway.
