caption: (A) Simplified schematic representation of the BMP pathway. BMP ligand dimers
  bind Type I/Type II transmembrane receptors. Activated Type II receptor cross-autophosphorylates
  Type I intracellularly, which, in turn, activates Smad proteins by phosphorylation.
  Activated Smad1/5/8 then binds Smad4 and the complex can enter the nucleus, bind
  to DNA and activate target gene expression. (B) Schematic representation of proposed
  BMP regulated events in vertebrate mucociliary epithelia. Yellow triangle indicates
  increasing BMP levels in migration and differentiated cells. Low/no BMP signaling
  is required in basal cells for maintenance and proliferation, while elevated BMP
  signaling levels are observed during migration and insertion of cell types into
  the epithelial cell layer during differentiation.
