caption: S1P signaling contributes to many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity.
  Pharmacological modulation of this pathway may attenuate tissue injury from autoimmune
  diseases, ischemia, sepsis and other conditions. 1) S1P/S1P1,2,3 mediates cardioprotection.
  Pharmacological activation of S1P1 and/or inhibition of SPL protect against cardiac
  and renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. 2) Lymph S1P is generated by lymphatic endothelium.
  This S1P source is required for lymphatic patterning and lymphocyte egress from
  lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. FTY720-phosphate blocks lymphocyte trafficking
  through functional antagonism and prolonged downregulation of S1P1  . 3) S1P/S1P2
  inhibits macrophage migration. S1P signaling contributes to trafficking/effector
  functions of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells of innate immune system. 4) S1P regulates
  thymic endothelial P-selectin expression, settling of TCPs and mature T cell egress
  at the thymic corticomedullary junction, where pericyte-generated S1P guides S1P1-expressing
  thymocytes into the circulation. 5) SPL in the thymus helps establish S1P chemotactic
  gradients. 6) Complement activation induces release of S1P from erythrocytes, facilitating
  hematopoietic progenitor cell egress from BM. 7) S1P/S1P1 facilitates pre-B cell
  egress from BM into the circulation. 8) S1P/S1P1 regulates migratory behavior of
  osteoclast precursors (relevant to pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis).
  9) S1P/S1P1,5 facilitates NK cell egress from BM and lymph nodes. 10) S1P/S1P1 induces
  marginal zone B cell migration into follicles. 11) S1P/S1P1 and SPL inhibition reduce
  endotoxin-induced lung injury. 12) HDL-bound S1P may mediate protection from atherosclerosis.
  13) S1P/S1P1,2,3 regulates vascular permeability and arterial pressure. 14) Erythrocytes
  and platelets generate blood S1P.
