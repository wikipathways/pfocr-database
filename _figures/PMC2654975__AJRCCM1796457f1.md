caption: The Notch pathway in mammals. The pathway is triggered by the Delta-like
  or Jagged ligands interacting with one or more of the Notch receptors. The pathway
  is activated by intracellular cleavage of a Notch receptor, releasing the Notch
  intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus where it activates CBF1
  (gene symbol, RBPSUH), the primary transcription factor to activate downstream Notch
  effector pathways (Hes1, 2, 5; Hey1, 2 and L). A variety of transcriptional coactivators
  and cytoplasmic and nuclear modulators tune the pathway, providing multiple points
  of control. When Notch signaling is active, differentiation is suppressed. When
  Notch signaling is turned “off,” differentiation to specific cell fates is allowed
  to proceed.
