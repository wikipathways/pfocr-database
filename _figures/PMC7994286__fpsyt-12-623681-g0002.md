caption: Possible mechanisms of antipsychotic adverse metabolic effects. The energy
  homeostasis pathway is complex and provides numerous possible mechanisms that might
  explain AP-related weight gain and metabolic effects. Arrow at end of line indicates
  activation of pathway and perpendicular bar denotes inhibition. Neuroendocrine signaling
  molecules are bolded. Potential AP inputs are italicized and represented by dotted
  lines. ARC, arcuate nucleus; LH, lateral hypothalamus; NPY, neuropeptide Y; AgRP,
  agouti-related peptide; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin; NPYR, neuropeptide Y receptor;
  MC4R, Melanocortin 4 Receptor; α-MSH, alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone.
