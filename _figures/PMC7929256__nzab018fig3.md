caption: Metabolic pathway of vitamin D3 to its subsequent metabolite forms. Vitamin
  D3 in circulation goes to the liver to be converted to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol
  (25-OH-D3). 25-OH-D3 can be further hydroxylated to either 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol
  [24,25-(OH)2-D3] or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2-D3]. When 1,25-(OH)2-D3
  binds to the vitamin D receptor, then biological effects are exerted through gene
  transcription. 1,25-(OH)2-D3 can also be further hydroxylated by 24-hydroxylase
  to 1,24,25-trihydroxycholecalciferol and undergoes a series of reactions to ultimately
  become calcitroic acid, a water-soluble metabolite that is safely excreted in urine.
