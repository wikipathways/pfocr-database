caption: Based on integration of the present data into previous models, we propose
  the following. Metabolic excess/overnutrition triggers adipocyte hypertrophy, which
  — via lipid toxicity and/or ER stress — initiates inflammatory gene expression in
  adipocytes. Initiation may occur via direct activation of inflammatory signaling
  cascades and/or via epigenetic mechanisms linked to derepression. Our present work
  demonstrated that a subset of key inflammatory genes was induced by clearance of
  the SMRT-GPS2 complex (IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1), promoting chromatin remodeling and
  recruitment of the transcriptional machinery (POL2 and TFIID). Subsequently, adipocyte-derived
  chemoattractants and cytokines stimulate immune cell activation that finally results
  in the chronic inflammatory status of obese adipose tissue. Both obesity-associated
  epigenetic alterations and inflammatory signaling are likely to cause downregulation
  of GPS2 and SMRT expression, in part via TWIST1. Improvement (resolution) of adipose
  tissue inflammation by TZD treatment or by gastric bypass–induced weight loss stimulates
  expression and activity of PPARγ, an upstream regulator of the TWIST1-SMRT-GPS2
  cascade. Consequently, these interventions restore the expression and function of
  the SMRT-GPS2 corepressor complex at inflammatory genes in adipocytes, thereby acting
  antiinflammatory.
