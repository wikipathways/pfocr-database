caption: Possible models of oncogenicity. In model 1, genetic alterations in any of
  the PI3K pathway members lead to amplification of PI3K signaling. In model 2, alterations
  of RTKs, RAS or PTEN in addition to mutant PIK3CA lead to activation of non-overlapping
  pathways or disrupt negative feedback loops to enhance PI3K signaling. In model
  3, oncogenic RAS leads to tumorigenesis via a mechanism independent of PI3K. In
  model 4, loss of PTEN leads to p53-dependent cellular senescence, which may be overcome
  by acquisition of an additional mutation in the pathway. In model 5, activation
  of PI3K is enhanced through interactions with oncogenic RAS. PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; RTKs, receptor tyrosine kinases.
