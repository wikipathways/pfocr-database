caption: Schematic representation of mevalonate biosynthetic pathway and its biological
  functions. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase by statins
  disrupts isoprenoid biosynthesis. Insufficient levels of isoprenoid species (e.g.
  geranyl pyrophosphate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate)
  cause numerous cellular effects, including loss of membrane integrity due to deficient
  cholesterol synthesis, altered cell signaling by blockade of post-translational
  modification of many proteins (e.g. prenylation), etc. Protein post-translational
  modification can also be blocked by bisphosphonates, FTIs, and GGTIs through inhibition
  of FPP synthetase, FTase, or GGTase I, respectively. Upon application, AGOH is thought
  to cross the plasma membrane and act as a substrate for sequential kinase reactions
  leading to AGPP, which can then be utilized by FTase or possibly also GGTase I to
  modify cellular proteins.
