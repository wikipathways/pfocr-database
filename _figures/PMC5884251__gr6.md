caption: Glucose and glutamine metabolism in redox prevention. Production of NADPH
  is mainly obtained from glucose metabolism (the pentose phosphate pathway) and glutamine
  metabolism (pathway from malate to pyruvate) through part of the TCA cycle. Glutathione
  is a tripeptide comprising glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. OAA, oxaloacetate;
  Asp, aspartate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate.
