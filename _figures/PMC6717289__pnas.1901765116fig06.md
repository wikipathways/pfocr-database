caption: Our proposed model of KRAS and TP53 oncogenes driving PDAC malignancy via
  the ARF6–AMAP1 pathway. KRAS promotes the 5′-cap–dependent translation of ARF6 and
  AMAP1 mRNAs, primarily via enhancing the activities of eIF4A and eIF4E, respectively.
  TP53 facilitates ARF6 activation by RTKs, via enhancing the expression of PDGFR
  () and MVP (), in which MVP activity is essential to geranylgeranylate RAB11b to
  transport ARF6 to the plasma membrane for its activation by RTKs (). EPB41L5 is
  induced during EMT by ZEB1 (). Although TP53 mutations can induce ZEB1 and hence
  EPB41L5, the molecular basis of this link appears to be complicated in PDACs and
  is not simply mediated by miRNAs. The ARF6–AMAP1 pathway drives tumor cell motility,
  in which the interaction of AMAP1 with EPB41L5, PRKD2, and other proteins is necessary
  to promote intracellular dynamics of β1 integrins and E-cadherin, as well as the
  cortical actin remodeling (main text). The ARF6–AMAP1 pathway also promotes PD-L1
  dynamics and is closely associated with the immune evasion of PDACs, whereas factors
  linking AMAP1 with PD-L1 and immune evasion are unknown.
