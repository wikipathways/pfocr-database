caption: Visualization of the GSEA-enriched genes from the leading-edge subset of
  the mismatch repair pathway in CPT-CEF-treated colon cancer cells. The pathway was
  extracted from the KEGG database, and the GSEA-enriched genes obtained from the
  data set were highlighted red. The underexpression of these genes is predicted to
  have an impact in the downstream signaling involved during mismatch repair.
