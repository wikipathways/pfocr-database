caption: Pyoverdine and Pf4 phage bind to Fe3+ and promote uptake by P. aeruginosa.
  Pyoverdine and Pf4 phage deprive A. fumigatus of Fe3+ and inhibit its growth (pathway
  ①). Phenazine reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+ and promotes P. aeruginosa uptake of Fe2+. Phenazine
  is converted by A. fumigatus into metabolic products with potentially modified redox
  potentials. These products may inhibit the reduction of Fe3+ in P. aeruginosa (pathway
  ②). Sub-MIC PYO, PCN, and PCA reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ and promote the FetCp/FtrA complex
  of A. fumigatus to take up Fe2+ (pathway ③). Sub-MIC 1-HP reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+,
  and two 1-HP molecules bind the newly formed Fe2+. This chelating activity induces
  iron starvation and activates triacetylfusarinine C (TAFC). TAFC promotes A. fumigatus
  uptake of Fe3+ and stimulates its growth (pathway ④).
