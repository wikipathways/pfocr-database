caption: (A) Schematic of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR)-mediated mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade in yeast. In this engineered pheromone response
  signaling pathway, cells express a yeast/human chimeric Gα protein to enable human
  GPCRs to couple with the yeast signaling pathway. Upon activation of downstream
  signaling, cells express mCherry fluorescent protein, which acts as an indirect
  measure of receptor activation. (B) Diagram represents homologous recombination
  approach used to include the mCherry gene along with the antibiotic resistance gene
  for clone selection within the Fus1 locus of yeast strains.
