caption: Functions of Mincle. After recognition of PAMP or DAMP by the extracellular
  carbohydrate recognition domain of Mincle, the positively charged arginine residue
  binds to the negatively charged residue of the FcRγ chain and transmits the activation
  signal through ITAM. Then, ITAM activates Syk via phosphorylation. According to
  reports, CARD9 is considered a crucial adaptor molecule downstream of ITAM signaling,
  forming a complex with Bcl10 and Malt1. Phosphorylated Syk activates the NF-κB signaling
  pathway through this complex, resulting in the release of chemokines from APCs.
