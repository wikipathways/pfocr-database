caption: Glucosinolate pathway regulation by ULT1 and CLF. A. Enzymatic pathway for
  methionine side chain elongation. B. Enzymatic pathway for indolic GSL biosynthesis
  from tryptophan and alipathic GSL biosynthesis from homomethionine. C. Enzymatic
  pathway for GSL breakdown in response to tissue damage. D. Enzymatic pathway for
  GSL breakdown in intact tissue. Black arrows between compounds represent enzymatic
  steps catalyzed by the associated enzymes. Only enzymatic steps that involve ULT1-
  or CLF-regulated genes are shown. Enzyme-encoding genes regulated by ULT1 (blue)
  or CLF (green) are indicated along with the logFC in mRNA expression level, as detected
  by microarray analysis, in the given background. Pathways were drawn after biocyc.org
  and (). u1 = ult1-3, 35SU1 = 35S:ULT1, 4D = 4-day-old vegetative apices, IM = inflorescence
  meristem apices.
