caption: Impact of miR-215 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, chemoresistance and
  EMT. p53 and miR-215 forms a positive feedback regulatory mechanism to regulate
  cell cycle control. The expression of p53 was induced by the suppression of DTL,
  a critical component of the CUL4A-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, along with the
  p53 down stream gene p21. The elevated p53 in turn up-regulates the expression of
  miR-215. In addition to DTL, miR-215 also suppresses the expression of TS, DHFR,
  CDC7, MCM3, and MCM10. miR-215 triggers cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase without
  triggering cell death, which contributes to chemoresistance to TS and DHFR inhibitors
  in CSCs. miR-215 also mediates EMT transition by targeting ZEB2 via TGFβ signaling
  pathway.
