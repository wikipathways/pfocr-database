caption: Illustration of SIRT1 signaling pathway in bone remodeling (; ; ; ; ; ; ).
  SIRT1 participates in intracellular energy metabolism through AMPK signaling pathway,
  and regulates bone metabolism in an AMPK-dependent manner. SIRT1 can promote the
  differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts by directly deacetylating SOX2. SIRT1 can
  deacetylate β-catenin and promote β-catenin to accumulate in the nucleus, thus further
  activating Wnt pathway to promote Osteogenesis differentiation. SIRT1 can activate
  the transcription factor RUNX2 and promote the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts.
  Activation of SIRT1 can significantly increase the expression level of BMP-2 and
  BMP-7 to promote bone repair. SIRT1 inhibits NF-κB degradation, downregulates NF-κB
  signaling and inhibits bone resorption. Activation of SIRT1 can significantly inhibit
  the activity of MAPK signaling pathway by inhibiting the expression of prostaglandin,
  promote the expression of OPG and inhibit osteoclast generation and bone resorption
  ().
