caption: 'Following its formation, a double-strand break (DSB) is initially bound
  by the yeast Mre11–Rad50–Xrs2 (MRX) or human MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 (MRN) complex. If
  a DSB is formed in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, the DSB is preferentially repaired
  by the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway (left panel). In this case, binding
  of the Ku heterodimer (Ku70–Ku80) prevents extensive nucleolytic processing of the
  DSB and promotes subsequent ligation of the DSB by the Dnl4–Lif1–Nej1 complex in
  budding yeast and the LIG4–XRCC4 factors in mammals. If a DSB is formed in the S
  or G2 cell cycle phase, the homologous recombination repair pathway predominates
  (right panel). Key steps for successful repair by homologous recombination include:
  nucleolytic processing of the 5′ ends of the dsDNA ends into 3′ single-stranded
  tails by the initial action of the yeast MRX complex and Sae2 enzyme (known as RBBP8
  or CTIP in mammals); extensive processing by either the exodeoxyribonuclease 1 (Exo1)
  or the Dna2–Sgs1 DNA-end-processing enzymes (the human Bloom’s syndrome protein
  (BLM) helicase is the homologue of yeast Sgs1); assembly of a recombination protein
  A (RPA)–ssDNA filament that is subsequently converted into a Rad51–ssDNA filament;
  completion of a successful homology search and formation of heteroduplex DNA; DNA
  synthesis that uses the 3′ end of the broken DNA, resolution of the heteroduplex
  or a double-sided Holliday junction; and, finally, ligation of the ssDNA nicks and
  termination of the process. Note that formation of the RPA–ssDNA filament is also
  essential for activation of the DNA damage cell cycle checkpoint. For a recent Review,
  see REF. . Protein or complex names given in brackets in the figure are the human
  homologues.'
