caption: Indole metabolites induce neuroinflammation through the AHR and NTS pathways.
  Gut microbiota metabolites derived from tryptophan can transmit signals through
  the AHR in microglia, activate TGF-α, and then exert neuroprotective effects via
  the ErbB1 receptor in astrocytes. They can also inhibit VEGF-β, thereby suppressing
  the neuroinflammation caused by the activation of Flt-1. Moreover, IFN-I-signaling
  in astrocytes collaborates with TPH microbial metabolites to co-activate the AHR,
  inducing the expression of Socs2, which in turn inhibits the activation of NF-κB
  and alleviates inflammation. Meanwhile, these metabolites can bidirectionally regulate
  the release of the appetite hormone GLP-1, enhance BDNF in the brain, and send signals
  to the brain circuits and the nucleus tractus solitarius. Figure support was provided
