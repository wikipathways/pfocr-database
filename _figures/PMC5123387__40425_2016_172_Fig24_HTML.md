caption: (Abstract P2). (i, ii) Under pathological conditions such as cancer, TGF-β
  production by tumor cells binds to cognate receptors on T cell surfaces and triggers
  signaling events that lead to Foxp3 expression and induced Treg cell development.
  (iii-iv) Signaling via the TGF-β non-canonical Akt-hnRNP E1-axis leads to post-transcriptional
  moesin expression. The TGF-β signaling pathway, Rho kinase and/or Phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate[PtdIns(4,5)P2] pathways, lead to phosphorylation/activation of
  moesin and aids moesin binding to the F-actin. (v-viii) Moesin-F-acting binding
  may promote internalization of TGF-β receptors possibly via early endosomes which
  feeds forward to promote optimal TGF-β signaling leading to efficient Foxp3 induction
  and iTreg cell differentiation. (ix) Moesin may also promote efficient recycling
  of TGF-β receptors to maintain the abundance of TβRII on the cell surface. (x) Differentiated
  induced Treg cells then suppress the proliferation of other immune cells such as
  cytotoxic T lymphocytes and effector T (Teff) cells to limit anti-tumor responses
  and promote tumor progression
