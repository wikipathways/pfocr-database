caption: This illustration depicts the transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory
  mediators when Dectin‐1 and other PRRs (e.g. TLR‐2 and TLR‐4) signal through the
  NFkB pathway. Dectin‐1 senses live yeast and zymosan to elicit the production and
  release of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL‐6 and PGE2). Signaling through Dectin‐1
  results in phosphorylation of NFkB inhibitors, which are subsequently degraded via
  proteolysis to allow NFkB subunits (associated with canonical pathway) to translocate
  to the nucleus to activate transcription of IL‐6 and Cox‐2 (rate-limiting enzyme
  in PGE2synthesis). We have discovered the presence of TLR‐2 and TLR‐4 on vulvar
  fibroblasts; these PRRs have been shown to signal through NFkB in other cells types,
  although their function in vulvar fibroblasts has not been confirmed. We are investigating
  the role of these and other PRRs in sensing and responding to subclinical levels
  of yeast and other stimuli that may contribute to chronic vestibular inflammation.
