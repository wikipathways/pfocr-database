  Application inspired by reference [35].This signaling pathway is activated during
  enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infections. Events include EPEC-mediated
  activation triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and interleukins.
  The process starts with the E3 ligand followed by the role of M1 and ubiquitin chains
  attached to K63 and then phosphorylation by IKK and TAK, breakdown of IκBα, and
  then NF-Κb, which is a transcription factor, followed by entry into the nucleus.
  Effector proteins in E. coli such as EspL, NleB, NleC, NleE, and NleH1/2 interfere
  with the steps shown in the figure [35]'
