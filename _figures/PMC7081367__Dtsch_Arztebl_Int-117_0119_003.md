caption: 'PI3K/AKT and RAS/RAF signaling pathways with main genes involved.Following
  binding of a growth factor to the corresponding receptor, for example,receptor tyrosine
  kinase (RTK), insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), both signal pathways are
  activated. There is also interaction (crosstalk) between several subsequently activated
  genes.The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (left) results in increased cell division and
  angiogenesis. The PIK3CA gene encodes for a catalytic subunit (p110α) of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K). PIK3CA mutations (usually present in mosaic form) cause PIK3CA-related overgrowth
  spectrum (PROS). This includes megalencephaly capillary malformation (MCAP), hemimegalencephaly,
  fibroadipose overgrowth (FAO), and congenital lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations,
  epidermal nevi, and skeletal anomalies (CLOVES). The proteinkinase AKT activates
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), leading to increased cell division and tissue
  growth. Mosaic mutations in the AKT1 gene are the cause of Proteus syndrome, while
  MTOR mutations are responsible for Smith–Kingsmore syndrome, as well as hemimegalencephaly
  and focal cortical dysplasia. Mutations in the above-mentioned genes are gain-of-function
  mutations. Antagonists of growth activation via the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade include
  PTEN (Cowden syndrome, macrocephaly/autism syndrome, Bannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba syndrome),
  and tuberous sclerosis (TSC1/2); the loss of which also results in overgrowth due
  to loss-of-function mutations. These mutations are usually not present in mosaic
  form, but are instead constitutional mutations.The RAS/RAF signaling pathway (right)
  regulates the cell cycle, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. Mutations in the
  involved genes result in what are referred to as RASopathies (Noonan syndrome: PTPN11,
  SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, NRAS, SHOC2, CBL genes; Costello syndrome: HRAS gene; cardiofaciocutaneous
  (CFC) syndrome: BRAF, MAP2K1/2). Gain-of-function mutations are found in the above-mentioned
  genes. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a negative regulator of the RAS/RAF signaling
  pathway. As in syndromes associated with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, the phenotypic
  overlap is great (, ).'
