caption: Graphical representation of the genomic neighborhoods of SRF and ZNF350.
  Genes are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes
  is represented as an edge. All edges are either between the master regulator and
  its predicted targets or supported by at least one reference from the literature,
  a textbook, or canonical information stored in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge
  Base. Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class
  of the gene product. In panel A for SRF, colored boxes encircle genes that are annotated
  to biological processes (cancer, muscle development, and cell movement) or signaling
  pathway (PTEN signaling, VEGF signaling, and ATM signaling). All genes shown here
  are differentially expressed between GIST and LMS (q < 0.001). Regulatory connections
  are shown by dotted arrows pointing the direction of regulation. MKL1 is the only
  upstream molecule known to regulate SRF, which, in turn, regulates the expression
  of several marker genes, including the computational marker PRUNE2 and MYOCD, which
  regulates immunohistochemical marker smooth muscle actin. In panel B for ZNF350,
  colored boxes encircle genes that are annotated to cancer, cell death, or integrin
  signaling. Notably, ZNF350 is predicted to bind to the promoter of muscle-specific
  immunohistochemical marker of LMS, desmin (DES).
