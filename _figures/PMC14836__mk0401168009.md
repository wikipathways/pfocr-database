caption: Model of signaling pathways regulating Raf and MAPK in CHO cells. The EGF
  receptor (EGFR) activates Ras and B-Raf, whereas the FGF receptor (FGFR) activates
  Ras, Raf-1, and A-Raf. Activated Gαo potentiates MAPK activation by Ras and EGFR
  but not FGFR. The G protein subunit stimulates the kinase activity of B-Raf by a
  Ras-independent and PKC- and PI3K-dependent mechanism, which is insufficient to
  promote MAPK activation. It is proposed that this mechanism can efficiently stimulate
  the MAPK pathway in the presence of a B-Raf-activating signal from Ras or the EGFR.
  The dopaminergic D2 receptor (D2R), which couples to both Gi and Go, appears to
  stimulate MAPK through Ras activation of Raf-1. This effect is presumably mediated
  by G protein βγ complexes and, possibly, Gαi subunits. Upon stimulation of this
  receptor, the Ras-independent and PKC- and PI3K-dependent activation of B-Raf induced
  by Gαo does not produce a MAPK response.
