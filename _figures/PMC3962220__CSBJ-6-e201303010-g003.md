caption: The IRE1 pathway. In normal growth conditions, the sensor molecule IRE1 is
  an inactive monomer, whereas IRE1 forms an active oligomer in response to ER stress.
  Activated IRE1 converts unspliced XBP1 mRNA to mature mRNA by the cytoplasmic mRNA
  splicing. From mature XBP1 mRNA, an active transcription factor pXBP1(S) is translated
  and activates the transcription of ERAD genes through binding to the enhancer UPRE.
