caption: 'Graphical sketch, adapted from Pivonka et al. , showing all mechanisms considered
  in the model presented in this paper, with novel contributions colored green and
  red: guidance of cell developments (OBu → OBp → OBa and OCp → OCa) occurs biochemically
  (governed by TGF-β and the RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway, including the action of PTH)
  via related activator and repressor functions, πact and πrep, and biomechanically
  (the macroscopic loading Σ relates to microscopic loading σbm, causing microscopic
  deformations represented by the microscopic strain energy density Ψbm, the latter
  entering the bone cell population model); evolutions of the different cell developmental
  stages follows cell differentiation (considered through maximum differentiation
  rates , , and ), cell proliferation (considered through maximum proliferation rate
  ), and cell apoptosis (considered through maximum apoptosis rates  and ); the mechanisms
  based on which the effects of PMO and denosumab administration, respectively, are
  depicted in the red-colored box (dotted thick lines) and in the green-colored box
  (dashed thick lines), respectively; see Sections 3.2–3.4 for details on related
