caption: Schematic model for EGFR-PI3K/AKT signaling activation induced by Notch1C1133Y
  mutation. a Schematic depiction of Abruptex domain C1133Y mutation and S1-3 cleavages
  in Notch1 receptor protein. EGF epidermal growth factor, LNR Lin/Notch repeats,
  HD (N and C regions), heterodimerization domain, TM transmembrane domain, RAM RBP-Jκ-associated
  molecule region, ANK ankyrin repeats, TAD transactivation domain, PEST sequence
  rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine. S1-3, S1-3 cleavages. Black
  arrows indicate the sites of the cleavages. Red arrow indicates the site of the
  C1133Y mutation. b Model for aberrant EGFR-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation
  by Notch1 C1133Y mutation. The Notch1 protein is synthesized in endoplasmic reticulum
  and is transported to Golgi complex for S1-cleavage. The S1-cleaved mature Notch1
  protein is presented on cell surface, where it has an inhibitory effect on EGFR
  phosphorylation. The ligand binding causes cleavage of the receptor at the S2-cleavage
  site. The remaining Notch1 receptor undergoes further cleavage at the S3 site, freeing
  the NICD domain. The NICD translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the DNA-binding
  protein CSL and was recognized by the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind (MAM).
  The triprotein complex recruits additional coactivators (Co-A) to activate target
  genes. In this study, we find that the Notch1 signaling has an inhibitory effect
  on EGFR activation. When Notch1 C1133Y mutation occurs, Notch1 protein is arrested
  in endoplasmic reticulum and is unable to be transported to Golgi complex for S1-cleavage,
  thus the canonical Notch1 signaling activation is disrupted. The PI3K/AKT signaling
  is activated by Notch1 protein arrest in endoplasmic reticulum induced by Notch1
  C1133Y mutation. Moreover, the loss of inhibitory effect by Notch1 loss-of-function
  mutation can also induces EGFR phosphorylation, thus activating PI3K/AKT signaling.
