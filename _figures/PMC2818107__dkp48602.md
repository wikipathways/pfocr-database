caption: Schematic representation of quinolone-mediated lethality. (a) Complex formed
  by gyrase interacting with DNA. (b) Quinolones trapping gyrase on DNA; DNA is broken
  with its ends constrained, which causes inhibition of DNA replication and bacterial
  growth. (c) First-generation quinolones (nalidixic and oxolinic acids) cause chromosome
  fragmentation that is blocked by chloramphenicol (CHL), a protein synthesis inhibitor.
  (d) Chromosome fragmentation stimulates a surge of ROS with hydroxyl radicals as
  the terminal product. (e) Formation of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals, the end product
  of an ROS cascade, is blocked by 2,2′-bipyridyl, an iron chelator, and thiourea,
  a hydroxyl radical scavenger, which prevent cell death. (f) Fluoroquinolones also
  kill bacterial cells by a protein synthesis-insensitive, ROS-independent chromosome
  fragmentation pathway that is postulated to occur by gyrase subunit dissociation.
