caption: Adropin regulates multiple signaling pathways. Adropin can upregulate the
  expression of eNOS through the VEGFR2/PI3K/AKT or VEGFR2/c-Src/ERK1/2 pathway, increase
  the release of NO, and improve endothelial cell function. Adropin can also reduce
  endothelial cell permeability by inhibiting the ROCK/MLC2 signaling pathway. Adropin
  can inhibit endothelial calcification by suppressing the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.
  Adropin may alleviate atherosclerosis by inhibiting EndoMT through the TGF-β/Smad2/3
  signaling pathway. Adropin downregulates PTEN through the Notch signaling pathway
  and may increase the basal level of PI3K to increase insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation.
  Adropin can regulate the function of brain cells by modulating the NB3/Notch1 and
  AKT/CREB/BDNF pathways. Adropin can improve liver function by activating the Nrf2
  pathway to reduce oxidative stress. Adropin also improves fat metabolism by regulating
  LPL via the cAMP/PKA and PLC/IP3/PKC pathways. In addition, Adropin reduces the
  expression of PGC-1α by inhibiting SIRT1, thereby downregulating Cpt1b and Pdk4
  to regulate glucose oxidation. AKT, protein kinase B; α-SMA, alpha-smooth muscle
