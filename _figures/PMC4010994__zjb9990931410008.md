caption: Proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of polyamines in T. kodakarensis. The
  proposed biosynthetic pathway in T. kodakarensis is shown, along with the enzymes
  pyruvoyl-dependent arginine decarboxylase proenzyme (TK0149), agmatine ureohydrolase
  (TK0882), pyruvoyl-dependent S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proenzyme (TK1592),
  and aminopropyltransferases (TK0147 and TK1691). The solid arrows represent the
  major reaction pathway for producing N4-bis(aminopropyl)spermidine [3(3)(3)4]. The
  broken arrows show a pathway confirmed by in vitro studies.
