caption: Hypothesis of signaling downstream of NIPI-3/Tribbles. A number of regulators
  downstream of NIPI-3 influence sek-1 transcriptional regulation. The NATC complex
  natc-1/2/3 and HDAC hda-4 are identified as novel components in the control of animal
  development in this study. Furthermore, positive feedback mechanisms of mak-2, pmk-1,
  and sek-1 forms a complex pathway to regulate proper animal development. The findings
  on the nipi-3(0) background led us to the wild-type scenario. See main text for
  details.
