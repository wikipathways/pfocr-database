caption: Mechanisms of action of small molecules with AβO-neurotoxicity-reducing effects.
  AβOs induce various pathological abnormalities, including oxidative stress, Ca2+
  dyshomeostasis, mitochondrial (mito) dysfunction, apoptosis, synaptic disruption,
  and tau abnormalities, leading to cognitive impairment. These responses are ameliorated
  by application of the antioxidative small molecules described in the text. These
  molecules exert ameliorative effects through various mechanisms, including activation
  of PI3K/Akt and Nrf2 pathways, inhibition of the JNK/p38 pathway, and antagonism
  of GluN2B-NMDARs. Notably, most of the small molecules have Nrf2-stimulating activity.
