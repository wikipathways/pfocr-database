caption: Mechanisms of apoptosis induction by the HIV-1 envelope protein at the cell
  surface. This can result from a hemifusion event through the transient interaction
  between Env- and CD4/CXCR4. This hemifusion event results in the exchange of membrane
  lipids and proteins. Alternately, Env-expressing cells can fuse with Env-negative
  cells resulting in the formation of a syncytium and death for the new fused cell.
  Here cell death relies on the p53 pathway via p38 and Cdk1 signaling.
