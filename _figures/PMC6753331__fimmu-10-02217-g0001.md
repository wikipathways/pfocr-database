caption: '(A) MiR-155 is expressed in plasma (P), monocytes, fibroblast-like synoviocytes
  (RASF) and synovial fluid monocytes (SFCD14*C) of patients with RA/JIA. It is induced
  by cytokines and LPS, and overexpression increases chemokine production. SOCS1,
  IL-13Rα1, and C/EBP-β are key target genes of miR-155. SOCS1 is a negative regulator
  of STAT1. MiR-155 decreased SOCS1 expression, increasing signaling through STAT1
  to promote M1 macrophages and suppress M2 macrophages to promote inflammatory responses.
  MiR-155 could also directly target C/EBP-β to suppress M2 macrophages. MiR-155 directly
  targets IL-13Rα1 and decreases the levels of IL-13Ra protein, resulting in decreased
  activation of the M2-promiting STAT6. MiR-155 is also associated with decreased
  expression of two predicated miR targets that mediate apoptosis: CASP10 and APAF1.
  (B) MiR-146a was expressed in PMBCs, monocytes, synovial fibroblasts, and synovial
  fluid monocytes (SFCD14*C) of patients in RA/JIA. It is induced by cytokines and
  LPS through the NF-κB pathway. It controls TLR4 signaling through a regulatory loop:
  the upregulation of miR-146a by caused by activated NF-κB; miR-146a reduces the
  expression of its targets including TRAF6, IRAK1, IRAK2, and IRF3; which limits
  activity of both NF-κB and IRF3 pathways.'
