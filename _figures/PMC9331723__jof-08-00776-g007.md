caption: 'The main antifungal agents used in treating sporotrichosis and their cellular
  targets are depicted. Azoles (e.g., itraconazole) and allylamines (e.g., terbinafine)
  are fungistatic drugs that slow fungal growth; the azoles by inhibiting cytochrome
  P-450-dependent synthesis of ergosterol (purple chart: sterol biosynthesis pathway)
  and the allylamines by competitive inhibition of squalene epoxidase, blocking the
  conversion of squalene to lanosterol. Amphotericin B is a fungicidal drug whose
  main target is the ergosterol molecule, producing pores in the plasma membrane (1),
  leading to the leakage of cytoplasmic material, sequestering (2), absorbing or extracting
  ergosterol from the membrane (4). Oxidative damage is reported as an alternative
  mode of action of AmB (3). The main adaptation that can lead to resistance in Sporothrix
  species is the increased expression of efflux pumps, especially to azoles, although
  other mechanisms may be involved. The illustration was partially based on Servier
