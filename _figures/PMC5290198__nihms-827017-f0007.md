caption: Breast cancer microenvironment is composed of diverse cell types including
  notably adipocytes, fibroblasts or immune cells, secreting numerous chemoattractant
  factors such as growth factors, chemokines or cytokines, including IL-6, that sustain
  cell migration or invasion. We identified BRD4 as a regulator of Jagged1, a Notch1
  ligand, which regulates Notch1 signaling activity in breast cancer cells to modulate
  their migration and invasion. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 enriches BRD4 at
  the Jagged 1 promoter to stimulate its expression and promote breast cancer cell
  migration and invasion through Notch1 signaling. A combined elevated expression
  of BRD4 and Jagged1 in breast cancer associates in vivo with the presence of distant
  metastases.
