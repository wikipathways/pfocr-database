caption: The main pathway for regulation of transcription by auxin. Auxin-inducible
  genes have AREs in their promoters, which are bound by dimers of the ARF protein
  family. Gene expression is prevented by recruitment of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors
  to these promoters via their interaction with the ARFs. Aux/IAAs recruit TPL family
  corepressors, which in turn recruit chromatin modifying enzymes (not shown) that
  stabilize the repressed state. The steps in the auxin response pathway are indicated
  by the numbered arrows. 1, Auxin acts as a molecular glue bringing together Aux/IAAs
  and F-box proteins of the TIR1/AFB family. 2, These F-box proteins are part of an
  SCF-type E3 ubiquitin protein ligase complex that transfers activated ubiquitin
  (Ub) from an E1/E2 enzyme system. 3, Polyubiquitination of the Aux/IAAs results
  in their degradation. 4, This releases repression at ARE-containing promoters.
