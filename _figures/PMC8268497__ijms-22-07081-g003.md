caption: The TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway. TGF-β and BMP ligands bind to two type II
  receptors, which recruit two type I receptors, and a complex is formed. The type
  I receptors are phosphorylated (P), initiating both the canonical and non-canonical
  signaling pathways. (Left) In the canonical pathway, phosphorylation of the type
  I receptors results in the recruitment of two R-Smads. The two R-Smads are phosphorylated
  and recruit SMAD4, forming a complex which translocates to the nucleus, where it
  regulates gene transcription. I-Smads inhibit R-Smad phosphorylation. (Right) In
  the non-canonical pathway, Smad-independent interactions occur within different
  kinase cascades, such as the Ras-ERK-MAPK pathway, the PI3k-Akt-mTOR pathway and
  the RhoA pathway. This sequential recruitment and phosphorylation of downstream
  kinases also results in translocation to the nucleus, where transcription of TGF-β
  and BMP target genes is regulated, such as Sp1, Forkhead Box (FOX)-related genes,
  and basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH)-related genes.
