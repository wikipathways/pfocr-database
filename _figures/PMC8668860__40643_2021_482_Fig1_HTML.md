caption: 'Schematic representation of the natural metabolism and the implemented Shemin
  pathway for PBG and porphyrin biosynthesis in E. coli from glycerol. Metabolic pathways
  outlined: glycolysis, glycine biosynthesis, pyruvate carboxylation, and oxidative
  TCA cycle (in black); glyoxylate shunt in the TCA cycle (in light brown); reductive
  branch of TCA cycle (in blue); Shemin/C4 pathway and its key precursors (in green);
  porphyrin formation (in red). Colored proteins: mutations (in red); heterologous
  expression (in purple); carbon source: glycerol (in blue). Metabolite abbreviations:
