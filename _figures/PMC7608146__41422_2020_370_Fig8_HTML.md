caption: Wnt9a and Wnt7b are two novel c-Fos/AP-1 target genes operating in an autocrine,
  and possibly paracrine, fashion in mouse and human OS to induce the expression of
  the collagen cross-linking enzyme Loxl2, thereby modulating collagen packing and
  impacting on osteoblast differentiation and tumor aggressiveness. c-Fos protein
  expression and stability is maintained through EGFR and its downstream kinase RSK2
  and the new regulatory pathway can be therapeutically targeted by inhibiting Wnt
  secretion (Wls) and/or Loxl2 activity (BAPN or blocking antibodies), to benefit
  OS patients.
