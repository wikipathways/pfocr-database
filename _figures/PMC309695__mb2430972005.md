caption: Model for regulating Reelin signaling at the level of Dab1. Reelin binds
  directly to ApoER2 and VLDLR on the surface of migrating neurons, which stimulates
  Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation and SFK activation in a positive-feedback loop, and
  triggers activation of downstream components of the Reelin-signaling pathway. Reelin-induced
  tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 is a limited process affecting a restricted subpopulation
  of Dab1 molecules, implying the presence of a limiting factor (represented as a
  box). Dab1 is primed for tyrosine phosphorylation by one or more serine/threonine
  phosphorylations (likely on serine) that are Reelin independent. Tyrosine-phosphorylated
  Dab1 is removed from the system by degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway,
  resulting in down-regulation and ultimately termination of Reelin signal transduction.
