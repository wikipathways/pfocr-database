caption: MAPK signaling pathways, their activators, and inhibitorsrelevant to this
  study. ERK signaling pathway is activated through the action of the EGF receptor
  (EGFR), Ras GTPase, MAP3K, Raf and MAP2Ks, MEK1 and MEK2. To inhibit ERK in cells,
  an inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 was used (U0126). Anisomycin was utilized as an activator
  for both JNK and p38 stress pathways, through activation of MEK4/7 and MEK3/6, respectively.
  To inhibit JNK or p38, SP600125 and SB202190 were used, respectively. These inhibitors
  are known to target JNK and p38 directly, preventing phosphorylation of downstream
  targets. However, there is a smaller effect on JNK and p38 phosphorylation by their
  respective MEKs. Changes in JNK and p38 activity were tested by monitoring the phosphorylation
  of their targets (c-Jun and MK-2) and levels of phosphorylated JNK and p38
