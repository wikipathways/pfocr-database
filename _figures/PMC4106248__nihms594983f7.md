caption: (A) Effect of ISW2 complex on its stress response gene targets in non-restricted
  (upper) and in calorie-restricted cells (lower). We found that Isw2 represses a
  cohort of stress response genes, including RAD51, which are induced either by isw2Δ
  or CR. (B) During CR, reduced nutrient levels are signaled to TOR-signaling pathway
  and the Isw2 regulated pathway, resulting in down regulation of both pathways. Decreased
  TOR-signaling results in reduced ribosome biosysthesis and protein translation.
  Down-regulated Isw2 causes derepression of stress response genes, including RAD51,
  as shown in 7A. Both reduced protein synthesis and elevated stress response promote
  longevity.
