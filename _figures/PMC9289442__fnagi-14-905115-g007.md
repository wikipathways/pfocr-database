caption: GDF15 alleviates SCI-induced neuronal ferroptosis by regulating the p62-Keap1-Nrf2
  signaling pathway. After SCI, cracked blood vessels at the injured cords result
  in the lysis and destruction of erythrocytes, which release a large amount of iron.
  Excessive iron accumulated in neurons produces superfluous ROS and causes neuronal
  ferroptosis, which promotes the activation of the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.
  Besides, GDF15 in neurons further facilitates the activation of the p62-Keap1-Nrf2
  pathway by stabilizing p62 and increased Nrf2 and HO-1 inhibit the accumulation
  of ROS and thus alleviate neuronal ferroptosis. GDF15 is suggested as a potential
  target on mitigating nervous tissue loss and promoting locomotor recovery post SCI.
