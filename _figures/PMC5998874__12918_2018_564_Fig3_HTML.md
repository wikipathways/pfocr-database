caption: The hypotheses of dysfunctional regulation mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis
  around XBP1. Red ellipses and green rectangles are TFs and targets obtained from
  our analysis respectively. The red line represents an increased positive regulation
  from normal to cancer, which also includes a decreased negative regulation; the
  green line represents a strengthened negative regulation from normal to cancer,
  which includes a decreased positive regulation as well. The dash line indicates
  the regulation relationship which exists in all three datasets while with differential
  regulation efficacy change. The orange ellipses, the white rectangles and the bottom
  blue rectangles are genes, pathway and cancer related biological processes obtained
  from the prior knowledge. As for the dark lines, ‘→’ indicates promoted effect;
  ‘—‘indicts protein-protein interaction; ‘-|’ indicates inhibited effect
