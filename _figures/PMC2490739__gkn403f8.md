caption: Scheme summarizing the differential effect of PARP-1 inhibition versus silencing
  on SSB repair via the BER pathway. The experimental evidence would suggest that
  SSB rejoining proceeds via the LPR sub-pathway when the SPR is deficient because
  of lack of PARP-1. In contrast, inhibition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in PARP-1 proficient
  cells was found to result in the accumulation of PARP-1 and PCNA in the vicinity
  of DNA damaged sites, with a 10-fold reduction of the bulk rate of SSBR. This does
  not impact on radiosensitivity in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, probably because
  cells have enough time to perform SSB repair. However, under such conditions in
  S phase collision of unrepaired SSBs with replication forks results in a large increase
  of radiosensitivity due to the formation of a large number of DSBs.
