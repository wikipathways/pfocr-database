caption: Several mechanisms have been shown to regulate TEAD transcriptional activity.
  Coactivator binding is the most important mechanism of altering TEAD transcriptional
  activity. YAP/TAZ bind TEAD along with AP-1 to activate transcription of downstream
  target genes. The transcriptional program driven by the YAP/TAZ, TEAD, AP-1 complex
  has been shown to be important for cancer progression. VGLL has been shown to compete
  with YAP/TAZ for TEAD binding. Availability of and competition between coactivators
  drive different TEAD transcriptional programs. Palmitoylation of TEAD in the central
  hydrophobic pocket is necessary for protein stability and is also suggested to be
  important for YAP binding. Osmotic stress acts via p38 to induce TEAD cytoplasmic
  translocation.
