caption: 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway: Activation of class IA/B PI3Ks
  occurs through the stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, which is induced by
  insulin and the concomitant assembly of receptor–PI3K complexes. Activated PI3Ks
  catalyze the conversion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 serves
  as a second messenger that helps to activate protein kinase B (AKT). Through phosphorylation,
  activated AKT affects many important downstream signals, including mouse double
  minute 2 homolog (MDM2), nuclear factor kappa–light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells (NF-kB), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR), and S6 kinase, and inhibits Forkhead box O (FOXO)s, Bcl-2-associated death
  promoter (BAD), and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β. RTKs, receptor tyrosine kinases;
  Ptdlns, phosphatidylinositol; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; SGK, serine/threonine-protein
  kinase; S6K, ribosomal protein S6 kinase.'
