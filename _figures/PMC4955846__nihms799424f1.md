caption: Pattern recognition receptors such as TREM-1 and TLR4 can recognize both
  exogenous (LPS) and endogenous (HMGB-1) signals. Signaling through TLR4/2 involves
  activation of the MyD88 dependent pathway leading to the translocation of NFkB into
  the nucleus. Signaling through TREM-1 involves ligation of the DAP12 adaptor protein
  leading to a downstream signaling cascade, which results in the activation of pro-inflammatory
  transcription factors. HMGB-1 signals through its receptor RAGE, as well as TLR4
  and TREM-1, which also contributes to the activation of NFkB to induce gene expression.
  The end result of signaling through all three pathways is the transcription of inflammatory
  genes, resulting in the production of mediators that contribute to increased airway
  inflammation. The TREM-2/DAP12 pathway may provide both inhibitory and activating
  signals. Phosphorylation of DAP12 leads to downstream activation of PDK-1/2, which
  recruits and activates Akt. Activation of PDK-1/2/Akt pathways leads to NFκB activation
  as well as inhibition of TLR signaling by blockade of MAPK signaling pathways.TREM
