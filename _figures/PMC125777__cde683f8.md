caption: Fig. 8. Model for dual regulation of RTG gene functions by Lst8p. Once on
  the cell surface, Ssy1p binds to glutamate or glutamine and sends an inhibitory
  signal to Rtg2p through Ptr3p. As revealed by the lst8-1 mutation, Lst8p might affect
  targeting or assembly of the Ssy1p–Ptr3p system, or its signal transduction function
  as suggested by , and thus act upstream of Rtg2p. Lst8p is also proposed to function
  downstream of Rtg2p, as revealed by the lst8-(2–5) mutations. Intracellular glutamate
  is hypothesized to be sensed by Ptr3p (), or some additional component of the Ssy1p
  signaling pathway. Repressive signals generated by glutamate would lock Lst8p in
  its ‘RTG inhibition’ state so that less Lst8p would be available for its function
  in Ssy1p–Ptr3 signaling; this would have the effect of attenuating glutamate repression
  of RTG gene functions.
