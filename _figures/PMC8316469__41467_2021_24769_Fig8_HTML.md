caption: A schematic model is proposed to illustrate how PD-L1 protein stability is
  regulated by NEK2 in pancreatic cancer. NEK2 positively regulates and interacts
  with PD-L1 largely through PD-L1 phosphorylation at the T194/T210 residue in ER
  of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, treatment with NEK2 inhibitor unexpectedly suppressed
  PD-L1 protein expression, largely by inhibition of PD-L1 phosphorylation that promotes
  its degradation.
