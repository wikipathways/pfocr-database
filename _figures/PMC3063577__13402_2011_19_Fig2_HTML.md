caption: 'Simplified diagram showing some of the identified BCR pathway members. In
  red, activating members; in green, inhibiting members; for some members the precise
  final effect is not clear; in grey, other proteins known to be present but not identified.
  Full arrows: direct interaction/activation; dotted arrows: indirect interaction/activation.
  Data derived from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway [] and
  from published literature. KEGG is a widely used annotated database of pathways,
  ligands and genes (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)'
