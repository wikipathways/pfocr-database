caption: RhoA/Rho‐kinase mediated vasocontraction. The RhoA/Rho‐kinase pathway is
  essentially involved in contraction of vascular smooth muscle and is linked to G‐protein
  coupled receptors for vasoconstrictors. The initial event is the activation of the
  small monomeric GTPtase RhoA by receptor associated heterotrimeric G‐proteins containing
  α subunits of the Gαq/11 and Gα12/13 family. RhoA activation is associated with
  an exchange of GDP to GDP at the protein. GTP‐RhoA subsequently activates Rho‐kinase.
  Rho‐kinase in turn phosphorylates and inhibits myosin‐light‐chain phosphatase. Inhibition
  of myosin‐light‐chain phosphatase results in enhanced phosphorylation of myosin‐light‐chains,
  which is the ultimate prerequisite for contraction of vascular smooth muscle. GDP,
  guanosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate.
