caption: 'Schematic representation of lipid metabolism and the link with epigenetic
  marks in PCa. PCa cells show an increased uptake of exogenous FAs, which are transported
  by membrane-bound transporters. PCa cells also have increased de novo FA synthesis.
  Additionally, intracellular FAs can mobilize via lipid droplet lipolysis. In the
  cytosol, FAs can either be stored as TAG in lipid droplets or undergo enzymatic
  conversion to acyl-CoAs, which can enter the mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle
  system. Inside the mitochondria, acyl-CoAs are broken down through a series of enzymatic
  reactions known as FAO. The resulting acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle, where it
  is oxidized for citrate production. Citrate can be transported to the cytosol, where
  it is converted to acetyl-CoA, which can then be used to synthesize cholesterol
  by the mevalonate pathway or phospholipids. Exogenous cholesterol can also be obtained
  as lipoproteins through the receptors LDLR and SB-R1. All these processes generate
  metabolic intermediates, some of which (white boxes) act as substrates or cofactors
  of epigenetic enzymes. Specifically, acetyl-CoA is used by HATs to acetylate histones;
  acyl-CoAs are used by HATs to acylate histones; SIRTs are dependent on NAD+; SAM
  is used by HMTs and DNMTs to methylate histones and DNA, respectively. Additionally,
  some SCFAs, such as butyrate, can inhibit HDACs, while some LCFAs can enhance sirtuin
  activity. Dotted lines correspond to metabolites that are transported or diffused
  through membranes (a different coloured line for the each metabolite). Underlined
  enzymes correspond to enzymes whose expression can be epigenetically regulated.
  Enzymes marked with a star (red for metabolic enzymes and black for epigenetic enzymes)
  are enzymes whose inhibition has an anti-oncogenic effect in PCa. Abbreviations:
