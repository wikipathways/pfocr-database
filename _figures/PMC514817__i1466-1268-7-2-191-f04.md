caption: Interaction of stress and inflammatory responses. Inflammatory agents activate
  NF-κB (1) and MAPK pathways (2) through several kinases resulting into activation
  of AP-1 and subsequent production of inflammatory cyokines (3). Stress factors activate
  MAPK pathway through a series of kinases (4) and HSF1 (5) that translocates into
  the nucleus. The MAPK pathway is also activated by constitutive Hsp90 (6). Activated
  HSF1 binds to HSE followed by HSPs production (7) that block NF-κB pathway (8, 9,
  10). The HSF1 may inhibit AP-1 inflammatory cytokine transcription activation (11).
  AP-1 has potential to activate HSF1 transcriptional activation (12). IL-10 blocks
  both IKK activation (13) and AP-1 activation (14) to repress inflammatory cytokine
  production. Dotted arrows represent stress response AP-1 products that are not produced
  by NF-κB. For more details see text
