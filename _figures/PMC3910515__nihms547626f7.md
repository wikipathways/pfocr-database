caption: Proposed mechanism of TGF-β signaling at the BBB during acute peripheral
  inflammatory pain. Acute CIP is characterized by an increase in production of inflammatory
  mediators, which leads to decreased expression of the ALK5 receptor (1a) and decreased
  circulating levels of TGF-β1 (1b). In turn, this leads to a decrease in signaling
  through the ALK5 receptor and decreased phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (2).
  The decreased expression of p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 results in a lower level of translocation
  of these Smad isoforms to the nucleus and a corresponding downregulation of TGF-β/ALK5-mediated
  signaling events (3). Our data also show decreased expression of the ALK1 receptor
  but this may be a compensatory response of the endothelial cell to maintain balance
  between ALK1- and ALK5-mediated signaling events. Interestingly, the expression
  of p-Smad1/5/8 was unchanged, suggesting that the TGF-β/ALK1 pathway may predominate
  at the BBB during acute CIP. Overall, this causes a dysregulation of the TJ protein
  complex, which is demarcated by increased expression of ZO-1 (4). Although our data
  also show that TGF-β/ALK5-mediated signaling can also modulate claudin-3, claudin-5,
  α-occludin, and β-occludin, the expression of these TJ constituents may be altered
  at a later time point. The result of this signaling mechanism is an increase in
  BBB permeability (5) that is characterized by enhanced paracellular diffusion of
  solutes (i.e., sucrose).
