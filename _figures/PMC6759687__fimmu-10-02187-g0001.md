caption: Alteration in lipid metabolism in tumor and potential effects on NKT independent
  and dependent immune function. Upregulation of de novo pathway and loss of tumor
  suppressive lipids such as DHA leads to differential accumulation of lipids in tumors,
  which favors tumor growth and provides energy sources and building blocks for bio-membranes.
  Alteration in lipid pool can affect immune response in an NKT independent or NKT
  dependent manner as outlined in the figure. It can lead to impaired macrophage function
  during inflammation and defective antigen presentation. Additionally, altered lipids
  can also serve directly as antigens for NKT cells and modulate their role in anti-tumor
  immunity. Homing of NKT cells can also be affected by altered lipids. Therefore,
  identifying the lipids as well as the pathways that lead to their upregulation and
  blocking it, can have potential therapeutic benefit in cancer.
