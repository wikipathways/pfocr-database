caption: (A) Following LPS stimulation, TLR4 signaling bifurcates into MyD88-dependent
  (brown) and TRAM-dependent (blue) pathways, which activates target genes such as
  Tnf and Socs3, and Cxcl10 and Ifit2, respectively. Black arrows indicate cross talks
  between MyD88-dependent and TRAM-dependent pathways. The two junctions analyzed
  in this study are indicated by stars (TLR4 to MyD88/TRAM and TRIF to TRAF6/RIP1/TBK1).
  Dashed line between TLR4 and TRAM represents indirect activation of TRAM for its
  recruitment to the TLR4 ( and supplementary ). (B) Tnf and (C) Socs3 in vivo mRNA
  levels after LPS treatment in wildtype (blue) and MyD88 KO (red, dotted) macrophages
  measured by qRT-PCR. Values are an average of six independent cultures and shown
  as means±SEM. In silico simulated expression (arbitrary units) of (D) Tnf and (E)
  Socs3 in the presence (blue) and absence (red, dotted) of MyD88 upon TLR4 activation.
  **p<0.01 vs. wildtype.
