caption: Saturated fats are internalized by cardiomyocytes and transported to the
  mitochondria to be used as a fuel source for beta-oxidation, causing a low level
  of mitochondrial ROS. This activates PKC, which in turn activates NOX2. ROS from
  NOX2 and mitochondrial ROS amplify each other in a feed-forward cycle that promotes
  greater ROS production and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium leak.
