caption: piRNA pathway and 21U-RNA pathway. (A) Primary piRNA processing and ping-pong
  amplification cycle in fly. piRNA precursor transcripts are produced from piRNA
  loci and are cleaved by an endonuclease Zucchini (Zuc). The PIWI proteins Aubergine
  (Aub) or PIWI with co-chaperones select the piRNA precursor fragments with enrichment
  for those with 5′U. The loaded piRNA precursor fragment in PIWI or Aub is then trimmed
  on the 3′ end by a hypothetical exonuclease Trimmer, and 2′-O-methylated at the
  2′ position of the 3′ nucleotide by the Hen1 methyltransferase. In the ping-pong
  amplification pathway, Aub with the mature piRNA targets transcripts bearing the
  complementary site. The 5′U on the mature piRNA would base pair with an A located
  on the complementary site. Cleavage occurs 10 nucleotides (inclusive of A) upstream
  of A, forming the new 5′ end. Shu and HSP83 facilitate the removal of the cleaved
  5′ upstream fragment. The cleaved 3′ fragment is then passed to AGO3 and trimmed
  by Trimmer followed by Hen1 methylation at the 3′ end to form the secondary piRNA/AGO3
  complex. This complex recognizes the complementary transcripts from the piRNA clusters
  and continues the cycle to amplify piRNAs. (B) piRNAs from mRNA 3′ UTR. piRNAs from
  mRNA 3’UTR were found in complexes containing PIWI family proteins. Zuc and Shu
  are required for production of 3′ UTR piRNAs, suggesting that 3′ UTR piRNAs are
  recognized by a mechanism similar to the primary piRNA processing pathway. (C) 21U-RNA
  pathway in worm produces piRNAs from the 21U gene. The majority of 21U-RNAs are
  generated from loci bearing the upstream CTGTTTCA and YRNT motifs (Y = pyrimidine,
  R = purine, N = any nucleotide). The CTGTTTCA motif is recognized by Forkhead transcription
  factors to enhance precursor transcription. R corresponds to the transcription start
  site of the 21U precursor, which is ~26 nt in length. The precursor RNA is loaded
  to the PIWI ortholog PRG-1. The extra nucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ ends are removed
  to produce mature 21U-RNAs. 21U RNA can trigger amplification of siRNA to regulate
  mRNAs and transposons. Recently, factors involved in 21U-RNAs were discovered. Some
  factors (Forkhead transcription factors, PRDE1, TOFU-3, TOFU-4, and TOFU-5) are
  involved in precursor biosynthesis, whereas the others (PID-1, TOFU-1, TOFU-2, TOFU-6,
  and TOFU-7) are involved in processing of 21U-RNA precursors.
