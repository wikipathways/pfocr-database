caption: Illustration of pathophysiological mechanisms of EL-induced intestinal fluid
  secretion and intestinal barrier disruption in mice. (1) EL produces CT, which induces
  intestinal barrier disruption. (2) LPS derived from EL translocates to the serosal
  side of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and binds to TLR-4 in both IEC and immune
  cells. (3) NF-κB activation leads to COX-2 expression and increased PGE2 production.
  (4) PGE2 binds to EP2 and EP4 receptors on IEC, resulting in generation of intracellular
  cAMP. (5) Intracellular cAMP elevation together with crosstalk to the Ca2+-dependent
  signaling pathway induces intestinal Cl- secretion via CFTR and CaCC, and causes
  intestinal barrier disruption. In addition, NO derived from NF-κB-mediated iNOS
  expression is involved in EL-induced intestinal barrier disruption.
