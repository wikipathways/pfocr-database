caption: A proposed mechanistic model for ABA-mediated stomatal closure in response
  to increased VPD in angiosperms. At low VPD (left), leaf water potential (ψ l) and
  turgor pressure are high, and PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE TYPE 2C (PP2C) proteins inhibit
  the function of the key ABA-signalling pathway, the protein kinase OPEN STOMATA1
  (OST1) (). This leaves OST1 incapable of activating the anion channel SLOW ANION
  CHANNEL 1 (SLAC1) in the guard cell membrane (). When VPD increases (right), transpiration
  (E) increases, decreasing leaf water potential (ψ l) and leaf turgor pressure. Our
  results indicate that altered turgor is the likely trigger for rapid up-regulation
  of NCED3, the rate-limiting step in the ABA-biosynthesis pathway, resulting in an
  increase in ABA level within 5 min. The speed of this response indicates that the
  turgor sensor involved is located close to the stomata, and we hypothesise that
  it is in the mesophyll cells. ABA is transported into the guard cells (enhanced,
  centre), from the main site of synthesis in the leaf, where it binds with ABA receptors
  within the PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE 1 (PYR)/PYR1-LIKE (PYL)/REGULATORY COMPONENT OF
  ABA RECEPTOR (RCAR) family, which alleviate inhibition of OST1 by binding the catalytic
  site of PP2C proteins (; ). OST1 phosphorylates and thereby activates SLAC1, resulting
  in a flow of ions and loss of osmotic potential from the guard cells, which deflate,
  closing the stomatal pore (). (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)
