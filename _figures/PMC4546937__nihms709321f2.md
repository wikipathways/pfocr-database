caption: 'IL-4Rα expression is regulated in the steady state by Hepatocyte growth
  factor-regulated tyrosine substrate (Hrs) (A). Hrs binding targets the IL-4Rα to
  the late endosome for degradation. Downregulation of IL-4Rα occurs through STUB1
  binding the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor through Hsp70 (B). Subsequent ubiquitination
  and degradation the IL-4Rα reduces cell surface expression and cellular responsiveness
  to IL-4. The IL-13Rα2 acts as a negative regulator of IL-4- but not IL-13-induced
  signaling through the type II IL-4 receptor (C). The IL-13Rα2 acts as a negative
  regulator of IL-4- but not IL-13-induced signaling through the type II IL-4 receptor
  although the precise mechanisms of this inhibition are not understood. IL-13Rα2
  expression is induced by TNFα in fibroblasts and leads to AP-1 driven pro-fibrotic
  reprogramming (D). YKL40 binds binds to the IL-13Rα2 chain leading to serine 473
  phosphorylation in addition to triggering ERK signaling (E). AKT phosphorylation
  following binding of YKL40 to IL-13Rα2 activates a myriad of signaling pathways
  including FoxO1/3 and the Wnt/b-catenin pathway. Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated
  tyrosine substrate, Hrs: STIP1 homology and U-Box containing protein 1, STUB1; heat
  shock protein 70, Hsp70; forkhead box protein O, FoxO; transforming growth factor-β,
  TGF-β; activator protein-1, AP-1.'
