caption: Programming anoikis induction. Upon cell detachment, anoikis signaling can
  be activated via three major pathways. (1), death receptor mediated pathway, (2),
  ECM-integrin cell survival pathway and (3), mitochondrial mediated pathway. (1),
  Activation of FAS/FADD in death receptor induces cleavage of caspase-8 and subsequently
  activate downstream caspase-3 to induce apoptosis. (2) ECM-epithelial cell interaction
  mediates integrin dependent activation of Talin1, FAK/SRC and ILK-1. Activation
  of ILK-1 mediates phosphorylation of GSK3β and recruitment of Snail. This signaling
  cascade activates PI3K/AKT cell survival signals. Loss of survival signals upon
  cell detachment, enhances cell susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli. (3). Cell detachment
  induces upregulation of pro-apoptotic protein, like Bim and down regulation of anti-apoptotic
  regulatory proteins such as BCL-2, which activate the cytochrome-C release from
  the mitochondria and subsequently trigger activation of Caspase-9 and 3 to induce
  apoptosis.
