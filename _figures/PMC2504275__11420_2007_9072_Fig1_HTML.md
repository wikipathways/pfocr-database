caption: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt proteins bind to a receptor complex
  composed of members of the frizzled gene family (Fzd) and low-density lipoprotein
  (LDL) receptor-related proteins (LRP). Receptor binding inhibits glycogen synthase
  kinase-3β (GSK-3). In the absence of Wnt signaling, GSK-3 phosphorylates β-catenin
  and targets it to a degradation pathway mediated by the APC protein (APC). In the
  presence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin escapes phosphorylation and degradation and
  accumulates in the cytoplasm. Excess β-catenin enters the nucleus where it associates
  with the lymphoid enhancing factor (Lef)/T cell factor (Tcf) transcription factors
  to regulate gene expression. Secreted frizzled-related proteins (Sfrps) contain
  the ligand binding domain of frizzled but lack the transmembrane region; they can
  bind the Wnt ligands but cannot transduce the Wnt signal, and thus, effectively
  block Wnt signaling. Dickkopf (DKK) proteins are secreted factors which also block
  Wnt signaling by binding to the LRP receptors
