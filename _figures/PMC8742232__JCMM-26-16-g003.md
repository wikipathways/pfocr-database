caption: Current models of primordial follicle activation in the mammalian ovary.
  In the adult mammalian ovary, only a small fraction of dormant primordial follicles
  are awakened to further developmental stages. Several signalling pathways exist
  to control primordial follicle activation, such as the mTORC1 signalling system,
  the p27Kip1‐CDK signalling pathway, MDM2/P53 and Sohlh1 signalling pathways. Among
  them, CDC42 regulates the activation of primordial follicles by regulating the expression
  level of PTEN in oocytes, which in turn regulates PI3K signalling activity in oocytes
