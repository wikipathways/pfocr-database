caption: Schematic representation of some involved pathways in C8- and C10-treated
  cells, on the basis of Metabolic Pathway analysis. In the mitochondrial matrix,
  glutamine can be converted, through glutaminase (GLS) activity, in glutamate and
  then in α-ketoglutarate (glutamine and glutamate metabolism). In cancer cells, α-ketoglutarate
  can converge toward citrate that, after conversion in acetyl-CoA in the cytosol,
  represents the primer for lipid synthesis. α-Ketoglutarate can also generate citrate
  through the oxidative metabolism in the citric acid cycle, forming succinate, fumarate,
  malate, oxaloacetate, and citrate. Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA can derive also from
  fatty acids β-oxidation or glycolytic pyruvate through the activity of pyruvate
  dehydrogenase complex (PDH). When in the mitochondrial matrix acetyl-CoA exceeds
  OAA amounts, acetyl-CoA can be used for ketone body production (ketone body metabolism).
  However, cancer cells can also produce a high level of lactate from glycolytic pyruvate,
  also in the presence of functioning mitochondria (Warburg effect).
