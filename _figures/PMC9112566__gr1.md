caption: The SARS-CoV-2 infection cycleSARS-CoV-2 virions attach to the host cell
  through the interaction between viral spike (S) protein and the plasma membrane
  receptor ACE2. The cell-surface protease TMPRSS2 mediates the cleavage of S protein,
  which further triggers fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and
  subsequent entry of viral genomic RNA. SARS-CoV-2 can also enter into the host cell
  by the endocytosis pathway, in which S protein is cleaved by lysosomal cysteine
  proteases (cathepsins; CTSB and CTSL). The viral positive-strand (+) RNA genome
  is translated to polyproteins PP1a and PP1ab, which are further processed into 16
  non-structural proteins (NSP1-16). NSPs participate in the formation of viral transcription
  replication complexes (RTCs) in DMVs to facilitate viral RNA synthesis and processing.
  The DMVs serve as a platform for RNA synthesis and the storage of negative-stranded
  templates/double-stranded viral RNAs. Nascent viral RNA is transported to the ERGIC
  or single-membrane vesicles (SMVs) for assembly. Viral particles egress through
  the secretory pathway and/or the lysosomal exocytosis pathway.
