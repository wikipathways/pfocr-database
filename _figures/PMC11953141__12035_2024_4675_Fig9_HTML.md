caption: CD38 coordinates with NF-κB to promote cochlear inflammation in NIHL. As
  the closest immune cell to organ of Corti, activated macrophages can express CD38
  and consume NAD in organ of Corti, causing NAD + metabolism dysfunction and ultimately
  leads to cochlear inflammation. In this process, inflammatory factors such as IL-1,
  IL-6, and TNF-α promoted the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway, forming a positive
  feedback cycle
