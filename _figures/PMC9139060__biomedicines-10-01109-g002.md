caption: Schematic representation of the role of DAMPs in the initiation of LGI. DAMPs,
  including cartilage compositions, crystals, endogenous molecules, and plasma proteins,
  are recognized by PPRs, including NLRs, TLRs, and RAGEs resulting in the activation
  of several signaling pathways involved in the production of proinflammatory cytokines
  and proteolytic enzymes by macrophages and chondrocytes. The binding of DAMPs to
  complement molecules activate the complement pathway resulting in cell activation
  leading to inflammatory responses and cell lysis.
