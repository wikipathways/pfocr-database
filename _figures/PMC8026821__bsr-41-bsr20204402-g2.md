caption: The metabolic form of glucose in cells is pyruvate. Most of the pyruvate
  in noncancer cells enters the mitochondria under aerobic conditions, and a small
  part is metabolized into lactic acid. PDH in the mitochondria converts pyruvate
  into acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle. In tumor cells, the oxidative (mitochondrial)
  pathway for glucose utilization is inhibited, and most of pyruvate is converted
  to lactic acid. PDK inhibited by DCA inhibits PDH phosphorylation and regulates
  its activity. Myc, Wnt, and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) individually or cooperatively
  transcribe one or more pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases in cancer cells. HIF-1 induces
  PDK to inactivate PDH and inhibits TCA circulation and mitochondrial respiration.
  HIF-1 can also stimulate the expression of glycolysis and LDH, thereby promoting
  the conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid.
