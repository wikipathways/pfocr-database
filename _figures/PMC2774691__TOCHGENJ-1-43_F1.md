caption: Schematic of fluorescent assay formats used to characterize kinase inhibitors
  within the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. (A) The FRET direct kinase assay uses a peptide
  substrate terminally labeled with a coumarin-fluorescein FRET pair and measures
  the amount of phosphorylated product due to a decrease in sensitivity of the phosphorylated
  peptide to proteolysis. Proteolysis of the non-phosphorylated product decreases
  the FRET, while FRET is maintained in the phosphorylated peptide. (B) The FRET triple
  cascade kinase assay detects phosphorylation of a labeled peptide substrate, as
  described for a direct assay. However, the kinase reaction components vary. In the
  case of the triple cascade assay shown, the kinase reaction components are active
  MAP3K kinase (RAF), unactivated MAP2K (MEK1), unactivated MAPK (ERK2), and the FRET
  peptide substrate. (C) The TR-FRET format detects association between a fluorescein-labeled,
  phosphorylated MEK1 protein and a terbium-labeled phospho- [Ser 217/221] MEK1 antibody.
  RAF activity is detected by an increase in the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescein
  acceptor MEK1 relative to the intensity of the terbium phospho-antibody donor.
