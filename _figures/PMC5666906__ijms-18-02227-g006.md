caption: Schematic representation of the impact of EGFR-ERK pathway on the type I
  interferon response in human keratinocytes. (A) Through a molecular mechanism not
  yet detailed, active EGFR-ERK pathway down-regulates the transcription factor IRF1,
  thereby keeping under control the expression of genes responsible of the type I
  interferon response; (B) Impairment of the EGFR-ERK pathway due to anti-EGFR and
  anti-MEK drugs leads to enhanced levels of IRF1. This transcription factor is actively
  implicated in the expression of the type I interferon gene cluster, including IFN-κ,
  in its turn responsible of STAT1 activation and eventual up-regulation of genes
  involved in the anti-viral defense and in the immune response. Dashed arrows indicate
  suppressed steps in the signaling pathway. T bars indicate drug-mediated inhibition.
