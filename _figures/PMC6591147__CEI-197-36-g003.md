caption: Mechanisms promoting regulatory T cell (Treg) development and immunosuppression
  in the tumor microenvironment. A, Treg cells are recruited to the tumor through
  chemokine attraction. B, Interaction of Treg cells with antigen‐presenting cells
  (APCs) through cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)‐4 deprive T effector (Teff)
  cells of co‐stimulatory signals, polarizes dendritic cells (DCs) towards a tolerogenic
  phenotype and induces the expression of indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase (IDO), which
  catabolizes metabolites, thereby inducing Teff cell apoptosis. Furthermore, it inhibits
  the reprogramming of Treg cells into Th17 cells by suppressing interleukin (IL)‐6
  secretion and promotes Treg cell lineage stability by inhibiting the transient mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1/protein kinase B (mTORC2/Akt) pathway. C, Tumor cells
  express programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1), which binds programmed cell death
  1 (PD‐1) at the surface of Treg cells. The PD‐1 pathway stabilizes forkhead box
  protein 3 (FoxP3) expression by inhibiting the phosphoinositide‐3‐kinase (PI3K)/Akt
  pathway and synergizes with transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β by diminishing the
  level of Smad3 necessary to promote the conversion of naïve CD4+ T cells into peripheral
  (p)Treg cells, while inducing Teff cell exhaustion.
