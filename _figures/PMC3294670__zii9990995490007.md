caption: Potential mechanisms of control of Listeria entry by the type IA PI 3-kinase
  signaling pathway. Infection of human cells with Listeria expressing InlB results
  in activation of the host Met receptor and of type IA PI 3-kinase (, , , ). The
  RNAi-based screen described in this work led to the identification of nine human
  proteins involved in PI 3-kinase signaling that play important roles in Listeria
  entry. Based on the biological functions of these nine proteins reported in the
  scientific literature, a diagram was constructed depicting some of the possible
  ways in which the host proteins could participate in bacterial uptake. Rab5c, a
  protein that interacts with regulatory and catalytic subunits of type IA PI 3-kinase,
  could promote Listeria entry by controlling the host endocytic machinery (, ). ARNO,
  an activator of Arf GTPases that binds directly to the PI 3-kinase product PI(3,4,5)P3,
  might help maintain proper levels of integrins, a class of receptor recently found
  to enhance InlB-mediated entry, in the plasma membrane (). The serine/threonine
  kinase PKC-ζ could promote Listeria internalization by controlling the actin cytoskeleton
  and/or the delivery of membrane through exocytosis (, , ). PKC-ζ is indirectly regulated
  by PI 3-kinase through the master kinase PDK1, which is a direct target of PI(3,4,5)P3
  (). mTor, a serine/threonine kinase indirectly controlled by type IA PI 3-kinase,
  might promote bacterial uptake through activation of the host proteins Rac1 and/or
  PKC-α (not shown) (, ). Apart from mTor, three other human proteins identified in
  the RNAi screen have the potential to control Listeria entry though activation of
  Rac1 GTPase. These proteins, SWAP70, DAPP1, and GIT1, each bind directly to PI(3,4,5)P3.
  SWAP70 is a direct activator of Rac1 and stimulates nucleotide exchange on the GTPase
  (). DAPP1 and GIT1 lack recognizable guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains
  and likely activate Rac1 indirectly. In addition to being an indirect activator
  of Rac1, GIT1 is also a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that inhibits Arf6 GTPase
  (). Along with ARAP2, another Arf6 GAP needed for Listeria entry (), GIT1 might
  restrain the activation of Arf6, which would otherwise interfere with bacterial
  uptake. Constitutively activated Arf6 alleles inhibit Listeria internalization ()
  and also induce the redistribution of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to internal
  membrane compartments (). Since plasma membrane cholesterol is critical for InlB-mediated
  entry, it is possible that GIT1 and/or ARAP2 promotes Listeria uptake by maintaining
  proper localization of cholesterol and/or other lipids ().
