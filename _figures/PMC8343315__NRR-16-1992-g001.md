caption: 'Schematic illustration representing “Epigenetic regulation of microglia-mediated
  neuronal LTP”.Left-panel of the image demonstrates that the HDAC inhibitor (HDACi)-mediated
  upregulation of H3K9ac levels at PI3K promoter leads to the upregulation of PI3K-AKT-BDNF
  signaling pathway in microglia. The upregulation of microglial BDNF eventually culminates
  in the increased neuronal LTP, suggesting an indispensable role of microglia in
  learning and memory functions. The right-panel of the image represents the miR-142-3p
  mediated regulation of the CAMK2A-CREB-BDNF pathway in microglia. Upon activation
  by LPS, upregulation of miR-142-3p expression in microglia downregulates the CAM2A-CREB-BDNF
  signaling pathway leading to decreased LTP, thereby compromising the cognitive functions
  in response to neurological insults/injuries. Red arrow indicates upregulation and
  green arrow indicates downregulation. AKT: Protein kinase B; BDNF: brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor; Camk2a: calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2a; CREB:
  cAMP-response element binding protein; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LTP: long-term potentiation;
  PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Adapted from Saw et al. (2019) and Gupta et
  al. (2020).'
