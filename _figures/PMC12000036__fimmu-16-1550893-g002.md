caption: The functions of TREM2. (A) The extracellular domain of TREM2 contains a
  V-type immunoglobulin domain, that allows TREM2 to interact with multiple ligands,
  including membrane phospholipids, lipoprotein (LDL, HDL, VLDL), lapidated apolipoproteins
  APOE, Aβ plaque, tau protein, myelin debris, apoptotic body, synaptic materials,
  bacteria, viruses, and DNA. Upon binding to these ligands, TREM2 activates downstream
  signaling pathways, ultimately leading to the activation of proteins associated
  with phagocytosis and the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, thereby enhancing
  the phagocytic capacity of macrophages for these ligands. This process plays a crucial
  role in the clearance of pathogens, apoptotic cells, abnormal protein deposits,
  and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by macrophages. (B) TREM2-deficient macrophages
  exhibit reduced lipid uptake, upregulation of Plin2 expression, and downregulation
  of ABCA1 expression, leading to increased formation of lipid droplets and reduced
  cholesterol efflux. The increased intracellular cholesterol is subsequently esterified
  into cholesterol ester by ACAT1. Additionally, TREM2 deficiency impairs energy and
  anabolic metabolism in macrophages. (C) The TREM2/DAP12 signaling pathway intersects
  with the CSF1R signaling pathway to promote macrophages survival and proliferation
  by activating the PI3K/AKT-mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. (D) After
  binding to LPS, TREM2 negatively regulates the TLR signaling pathway and downregulates
  the PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways to alleviate inflammatory responses. Furthermore,
  TREM2 effectively reduces neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease mouse models
  by inhibiting the JAK2-STAT1/STAT3 signaling pathway. Please note that, upon activation,
  TREM2 promotes inflammatory responses through downstream NF-κB and MAPK signaling
  pathways (Figure 1). However, depending on cell type or specific stimulation conditions,
  TREM2 can also exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. (D) highlights the mechanisms
  underlying its anti-inflammatory role. Image created with BioRender.com
