caption: The potential mechanism of TUDCA in treating AD. The potential mechanisms
  of TUDCA in treating AD may be related to reducing Amyloid-β protein deposition,
  regulating apoptotic pathways, preventing tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation,
  protecting neuronal synapses, exerting anti-inflammatory effects, and improving
  metabolic disorders. The therapeutic effects of TUDCA are represented by brown arrows,
  while the brown arrows with flat heads indicate the inhibitory effects on specific
  pathways
