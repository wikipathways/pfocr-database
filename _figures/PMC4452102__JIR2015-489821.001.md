caption: 'TLRs in human gastrointestinal pathology: health condition and inflammation.
  (a) In healthy human intestine, a constant homeostasis is maintained by the perfect
  regulation of microbial load and the immune response generated against it. (b) Failure
  of this balance may result in various pathological conditions. TLRs may be considered
  an interface among intestinal epithelial barrier, microbiota, and immune system.
  TLRs pathway, activated by pathogens, is involved in the pathogenesis of several
  infectious and inflammatory diseases. TLR signaling critically contributes to acute
  and chronic intestinal inflammatory processes.'
