caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of aromatic amino acids (AAAs). Consecutive enzymatic
  steps of pre-chorismate pathway: D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS),
  dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS), 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase
  (DQSD), shikimate kinase (SK), 5-enolypyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS),
  and chorismate synthase (CS); and post-chorismate pathway: anthranilate synthase
  (AS) chorismate mutase (CM) leading to the synthesis of tyrosine (TYR), phenylalanine
  (PHE), and tryptophan (TRP).'
