caption: Integrin trafficking and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi protein export
  pathways.A. Integrin trafficking depicting the two main pathways of internalization,
  clathrin-mediated and caveolar, as well as the pathways for recycling. Clathrin-mediated
  internalization utilizes clathrin coated pits, whereas caveolar internalization
  utilizes dynamin GTPase to form vesicles containing lipid rafts and caveolin protein.
  Recycling occurs through fusion to early endosomes and proceeds either via Rab4
  signaling through a short loop pathway or via Rab11 signaling through a long loop
  pathway where proteins pass through the perinuclear recyling complex. Respective
  integrins and their trafficking mediators are listed above the suggested pathways
  that they utilize (, , , , ). B. ER to Golgi protein export depicting coat protein
  complex II (COPII)-mediated anterograde transport and coat protein complex I (COPI)-mediated
  retrograde transport between the ER and the Golgi complex. COPII assembly commences
  with Sar1 G-protein activation by the Sec12 guanine nucleotide exchange factor,
  followed by the recruitment of the Sec23–24 heterodimer that recognizes ER export
  signals on cargo proteins for inclusion in vesicles. The Sar1-Sec23–24 complex recruits
  the Sec13–31 heterodimer that facilitates final budding and vesicle formation from
  the ER. Vesicles proceed to the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), which
  is also called vesicular tubular clusters (VTC), the complex of which transports
  proteins to the Golgi destination for eventual final export (, , ). GTP = guanosine-5′-triphosphate;
  SNARE = N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor. PKC
  = protein kinase C.
