caption: Schematic representation of secretory cell (SC) differentiation programs.
  Black lines ending with a perpendicular line indicate an inhibitory effect, while
  arrows show a stimulatory result; up- and downward red arrows indicate stimulation
  and suppression, respectively. Suprabasal cells activated by the NOTCH pathway activate
  the transcription factor HEY, leading to the repression of the MCC gene expression
  program and the differentiation in SCs [20]. Conversely, intermediate cells that
  do not receive active NOTCH signaling trigger a network involving MYCL, GMNC, and
  MCIDAS, leading to the differentiation into MCC precursors [20]. KLF4 and KLF5 repress
  the CFTR transcript, determining epithelial cell fate toward being secretory (club
  and goblet) [22,27]. The fates of club or goblet cells are determined by the expression
  of different transcription factors such as FOXM1, RUNX2, FOXA3, and SPDEF to goblet
  cells, while FOXA2 and TTF-1 inhibit genes implicated in goblet cell differentiation
  (Muc5ac, Muc15, Agr2, FOXA3, Clca1, Ptger3) [21,23,24,103]. In addition, FOXA2 and
  TTF-1 are relevant transcriptional regulators of genes expressed selectively in
  club cells (Scgb1a1, Sftpb, Sftpa1, Sftpd, Aqp5, Scnn1b, Scnn1g) [21,104,105,106].
