caption: A working model of hnRNPM-IRES-mediated translational switch in hypoxia.
  There are 3 types of cytoplasmic mRNAs (labeled with different colors) in the mRNA
  pool in the cells. Cap-dependent translation carried out by eIF4F (eIF4E-eIF4A-eIF4G1)
  is predominately used for protein synthesis in normoxia (left). When eIF4F-dependent
  translation is inhibited during hypoxia (transcripts in black), mRNA translation
  is then carried out selectively by the hypoxic eIF4F (eIF4E2-eIF4A-eIF4G3)-dependent
  (transcripts in orange) pathway [] (right). Alternatively, a subset of IRES-containing
  mRNAs (transcripts in green) undergoes conformational change in hypoxia and is recognized
  by the novel hypoxia-induced ITAF hnRNPM. Together with the help from complex X
  (other RBPs like hnRNPC1/C2 and HuR) and the interaction of hnRNPM-IRES trigger
  the formation of a new translation initiation complex and prime cap-independent
  translation to take place (right). Overall, protein synthesis through co-regulated,
  co-occupied IRES-containing mRNAs by hnRNPM can achieve vital physiological responses
  to combat environmental hypoxic stress. (For interpretation of the references to
  colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
