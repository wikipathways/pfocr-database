caption: Effects of metabolism on Foxp3 expression and the generation of Treg cells.
  There are various scenarios in which Treg cell signaling and metabolic pathways
  might integrate and potentially affect Foxp3 expression. One of the downstream effects
  of an enhancement in glycolytic metabolism is the production of metabolic intermediates
  that can also function as signaling molecules (1). For example, NAD+ and NADH might
  control Foxp3 stability via the activation of histone deacetylases such as SIRT
  proteins, which directly deacetylate Foxp3 in the nucleus and lead to its proteosomal
  degradation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the glycolytic enzyme enolase-1 can repress
  the FOXP3 splice variant containing exon 2 (E2) in human Treg cells, and its engagement
  in glycolysis serves as a mechanism by which glycolysis can control Foxp3 expression
  (2). Signaling molecules from glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism (PEP and ROS)
  activate NFAT via Ca2+ mobilization during T cell activation, a process that could
  potentially affect Foxp3 expression in Treg cells as well (3). Activation of Foxo
  transcription factors and HIF-1α downstream of the PI(3)K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway
  can reciprocally affect Foxp3 expression (4). Finally, the chromatin-modifying enzyme
  EZH2 that is crucial for the establishment of a repressive Treg cell gene program
  can be inhibited by specific microRNAs (such as miR-101 and miR-26a) under circumstances
  of glucose deprivation, which leads to Treg cell instability (5). ETC, electron-transport
  chain; PRC, polycomb repressive complex; IP3 and IP3R, inositol-1,3,4-trisphosphate
  and its receptor.
