caption: Schematic representation of the RANK/RANKL pathway. Pathways activated by
  RANK-RANKL signaling and downstream targets. ERK = extracellular signal-related
  kinases; JNK = cJun amino-terminal kinases; NF-κB = nuclear factor κB; PI3K = phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; RANK = receptor activator of nuclear factor κB; RANKL = receptor activator
  of nuclear factor κB ligand; TRAF = TNF receptor-associated factor.
