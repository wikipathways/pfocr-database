caption: 'The proliferative signal of EGF is transmitted through two pathways: (1)
  JAK/STAT pathway and (2) Ras/MAPK pathway, ultimately causing activation of transcription
  factors such as c-Fos, STAT1 and STAT3, which all have important roles in proliferation
  and keratinization. T4 was reported to potentiate the EGF signaling through both
  the STAT pathway and the MAPK pathway.'
