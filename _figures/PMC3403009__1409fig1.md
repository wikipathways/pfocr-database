caption: Classical view of the RB pathway and RB function in mammalian cells. (A)
  Schematic representation of the canonical RB pathway. Small cell cycle inhibitors
  prevent the phosphorylation of RB and its family members by Cyclin/Cdk complexes.
  E2F transcription factors are major mediators of RB function in mammalian cells.
  (B) Examples of RB's mode of action in cells to restrain cell cycle progression
  and promote differentiation. (Top) Classically, RB binds to the regulatory regions
  of cell cycle genes via its interaction with E2F transcription factors and recruits
  repressor complexes to inhibit the expression of cell cycle genes. (Second from
  top) RB also controls the cell cycle by blocking the degradation of the p27 small
  cell cycle inhibitor (of the p21 family) by Skp2; high p27 levels can directly inhibit
  Cdk2 kinase activity and slow cell cycle progression. (Third from top) RB can promote
  differentiation in cooperation with other transcription factors, such as Runx2,
  in the bone lineage. (Bottom) RB can also control cell fate by controlling the expression
  of transcription factors involved in cellular differentiation, such as PPARγ during
  adipogenesis.
