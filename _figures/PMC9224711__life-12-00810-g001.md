caption: Omega-3 FA synthesis pathway in cyanobacteria. AccABCD (acetyl-CoA carboxylase)
  catalyzes the formation of malonyl-CoA using two molecules of acetyl-CoA. The malonyl
  moiety is transferred to the acyl-carrier protein (ACP) by FabD (malonyl-CoA ACP
  transacylase. The initial condensation reaction is catalyzed by FabH (β-ketoacyl-ACP
  synthase III), reducing acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP to form acetoacetyl-ACP. AccABCD,
  FabD, and FabH are enzymes that perform reactions in the initiation step. The next
  reaction in the elongation cycle is catalyzed by FabG (β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase),
  which reduces acetoacetyl-ACP to form β-hydroxyacil-ACP, which is dehydrated by
  FabZ/FabA (β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase) to produce trans-2-enoyl-ACP. The final
  step in the cycle is catalyzed by FabI (trans-2-enoyl-ACP reductase). The resulting
  fatty acyl-ACP can be elongated further by FabF/FabB (β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II/I)
  or if the fatty acyl-ACP contains 16 or 18 carbon atoms (C16:0-ACP or C18:0-ACP,
  respectively) can be unsaturated by the action of desaturases. FabF, FabG, FabZ,
  and FabI are enzymes that perform reactions in the elongation cycle. In the desaturation
  step, four consecutive desaturases (DesC or Δ9, DesA or Δ12, DesB or Δ15, and DesD
  or Δ6) catalyzed the conversion of stearic acid (SA) into stearidonic acid (SDA).
  OA, oleic acid; LA, linoleic acid; GLA, γ-linolenic acid; ALA, α-linolenic acid.
