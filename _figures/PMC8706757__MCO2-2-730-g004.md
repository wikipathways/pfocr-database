caption: Signaling pathway of cell survival, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Necroptosis
  occurs when the death receptor tumor necrosis factors such as TNFR1, TNFR2, and
  FAS bind their own death receptor ligand such as TNF‐α, FasL with a inhibition or
  blocking‐up in apoptotic pathway. The deubiquitination and release of RIPK1 from
  TNFR complex I promotes the formation of complex II, which can activate downstream
  cell apoptosis and necroptosis pathways. To induce necroptosis, RIPK3 can trigger
  the mPTP by activating CaMK II
