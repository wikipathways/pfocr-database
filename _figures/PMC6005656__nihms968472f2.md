caption: Cholesterol catabolic enzymes are post-translationally regulated by acetylation,
  succinylation, and redox potential. (A) The cholesterol catabolic pathway and the
  enzymes involved that are post-translationally regulated. (B) The different post-translational
  regulatory mechanisms for catabolic enzymes. The cAMP-dependent MtPat acetylates
  lysine and this modification is removed by NAD+-dependent sirtuin, CobB. CobB also
  functions as a desuccinylase. Disulfide formation in FadA5 regulates catalytic activity
  and is reversible.
