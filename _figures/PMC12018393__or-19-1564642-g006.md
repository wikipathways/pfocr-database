caption: Toremifene metabolic pathway. The major circulating metabolite of toremifene,
  N-desmethyl (NDM) toremifene, is highlighted in red while the primary active metabolite
  of tamoxifen, 4OH-NDM-toremifene, is highlighted in blue. 4-hydroxy (4-OH) toremifene,
  another metabolite, is also shown. The key cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved
  in toremifene metabolism are noted alongside other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The
  conversion of toremifene into NDM-toremifene occurs primarily via CYP3A4, with CYP3A5
  and CYP2D6 also contributing to a lesser extent. NDM-toremifene is converted into
  its secondary metabolite, 4OH-NDM-toremifene, through the CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 isozymes.
  Further, toremifene is converted to 4OH-toremifene mainly via CYP2C9, with CYP2D6
  contributing a minor role. The CYP3A4 is the main isozyme in converting 4OH-toremifene
  into 4OH-NDM-toremifene, with CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 also involved to a lesser degree.
  4OH-toremifene and 4OH-NDM-toremifene are converted into excretable forms through
  sulfotransferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (100, 117, 118, 122, 123)
