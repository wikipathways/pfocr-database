caption: Schematic depiction of processes and pathways involved in iron homeostasis
  and regulation in the brain. Iron can enter the brain through the blood–brain barrier
  and the choroid plexus (1). Transport of iron across the blood–brain barrier is
  mediated by the TfR-DMT-1-Fpn pathway in a similar manner to cells in the periphery.
  Fe2+ released from the basolateral surface of brain capillary endothelial cells
  by Fpn is rapidly oxidized to Fe3+ by Cp, secreted into the interstitium through
  the astrocyte endfeet, and then captured by transferrin that is expressed by cells
  of the choroid plexus. Iron can also enter the brain through astrocytes (2). A significant
  amount of Fe3+ ions in the CNS circulate attached to low molecular mass molecules
  secreted by astrocytes such as ascorbate, citrate, or ATP. The CNS also contains
  a significantly greater amount of NTBI than the periphery. Neurons express high
  levels of TfRs and acquire the bulk of their iron from transferrin under physiological
  conditions. Astrocytes, on the other hand, express DMT-1 and internalize Fe2+ ions
  in the form of NTBI. Microglia internalize TBI via TfRs as expected, but also utilize
  the dicarboxylic acid receptor and probably also the lactoferrin receptor. Neurons
  and other glial cells also acquire NTBI from upregulated DMT-1 under inflammatory
  conditions (left part). Some factors might disrupt this iron balance resulting in
  iron deficiency (middle top) or iron overload (middle bottom). The IRP-IRE system
  regulates iron uptake and storage by modulating the expression of mRNAs coding for
  iron uptake, storage, and export proteins. When CNS iron levels are low (right top),
  IRP binds to the 3′ IREs of target mRNAs (e.g. TfR1 and DMT1) thus stabilizing the
  transcript in order to enable translation and the subsequent increase in iron uptake.
  Concomitant binding to the 5′ IREs of target mRNAs (ferritin, Fpn, ALAS2, HIF-2α,
  APP, and, possibly, a-synuclein) prevents binding of the 43S preinitiation complex,
  thus inhibiting translation and reducing iron storage and efflux. In the presence
  of excess iron in the CNS (right bottom), IRP1 incorporates ISCs in order to acquire
  aconitase activity, while IRP2 is degraded. IRPs thus lose their affinity for IREs,
  resulting in the degradation of mRNAs with 3′ IRE sequences that code for iron uptake
  proteins and in the translation of mRNAs with 5′ IREs that code for iron storage
  and efflux proteins. Figure adapted and get permission from references (; ). DMT-1,
