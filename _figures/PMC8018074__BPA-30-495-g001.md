caption: 'Table of Contents Image (TOCI): A sketch map demonstrates the cellular and
  molecular mechanism associated with PWMD in the septic neonatal rats. Microglia
  and astrocyte are activated in the PWM after intraperitoneal injection of LPS and
  release massive amounts of C3a and IL‐1β. Then they will bind to their receptors
  (C3aR and IL‐1R1) on the OLs and may activate AKT signaling pathway. It will inhibit
  GSK3β, allowing β‐catenin cytoplasmic accumulation and binding to TCF4 in the nucleus
  for nuclear translocation to active WNT/β‐catenin signaling pathway. It can lead
  to the delay of maturation or differentiation of OPCs through inhibiting the differentiation
  transcription factor of OPCs. This would contribute to axonal hypomyelination in
  the PWM in the experimental induced septic neonatal rats. XAV‐939, a selective inhibitor
  of WNT/β‐catenin signaling pathway, which may indirectly stabilize Axin2 through
  Tankyrase1/2, can promote the maturation or differentiation of OPCs in vitro.'
