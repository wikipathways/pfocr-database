caption: Overview of the role of DIR1 in carbon metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis,
  and hormone biosynthesis in guard cells during systemic defense response. Loss of
  DIR1 results in altered abundance of proteins, metabolites, and lipids involved
  in carbon metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of plant hormones
  and secondary metabolites. Proteins that were decreased in dir1-1 guard cells in
  the carbon metabolism metabolic pathway included FBA3, TIM, TPI, LOS2, PKPα, and
  ACO2. Proteins that were decreased in dir1-1 guard cells in the amino acid biosynthesis
  metabolic pathways included AGD2, CYSC1, CBL, MS2, MTO1, AT4G17830, and AQI, and
  decreased metabolites in these pathways included gly-leu, niacin, acetyl-leucine,
  desaminotyrosine, and pyroglutamic acid. One increased metabolite in dir1-1 guard
  cells in the arginine biosynthesis pathway was aminolevulinic acid. Proteins that
  were decreased in dir1-1 guard cells in the biosynthesis of hormones and secondary
  metabolites metabolic pathways included MEE32 and MOD1, and decreased metabolites
  and lipids in these pathways included salicylic acid, stearic acid (FA 18:0), behenic
  acid (FA 22:0), cetyl oleate (WE 16:0/18:1), and ethyl myristate (WE 16:0). One
  protein, EFE, and one lipid, FAO2 18:1, were increased in these pathways in the
  dir1-1 Pst-primed guard cells versus WT Pst-primed guard cells. Please refer to  for
  abbreviations.
