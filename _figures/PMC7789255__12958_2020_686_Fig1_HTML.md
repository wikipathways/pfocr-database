caption: The possible paracrine mechanisms controlling self-renewal of spermatogonia
  in juvenile testis. Spermatogonia are in close contact with Sertoli cells which
  provide structural support and paracrine factors to the developing spermatogenic
  cells. The self-renewal and proliferation factor GDNF expressed by Sertoli cells
  is responsible for transcriptional activation of Zbtb16 and Lin28B and thereby preventing
  spermatogonia to enter differentiation pathway. Sertoli cells are the source of
  paracrine RA signaling pathway. In Sertoli cells, retinol is oxidized to retinal
  by RDH10 and then to RA by RALDH1a1. However, the amount of RA produced by Sertoli
  cells within juvenile testis is not robust to initiate spermatogonia differentiation
  possibly due to the low amount of CRABP2 which is considered for activating of RA
  signaling in Sertoli cells as well as the high amount of CRABP which is considered
  for degrading of RA signaling within spermatogonia. Black arrows refer to retinol
  metabolism and RA signaling pathway. Blue arrows refer to endogenous factors that
  promote spermatogonia proliferation and self-renewal but at the same time inhibits
  spermatogonial differentiation and meiotic entry. RBP4, retinol binding protein
