caption: 'Pathway rewiring associated to different biological transitions. Each panel
  shows a network of communities identified in each transition: health to disease
  in panel a, disease to treatment in panel b, and treatment to health in panel c.
  In panel a, the “GPCR signaling community” is connected to the “ECM organization
  community” but not to the “neuronal system community.” In panel b, only four communities—“ECM
  organization community,” “GPCR signaling community,” “SLC-mediated transport community,”
  and “neuronal system community”—survived with no connections between communities.
  In panel c, the “GPCR signaling community” exhibits a rewiring, with a new connection
  (shown with a thicker line in the image) to the “neuronal system community.” A gray
  outline indicates the community that contains the “hemostasis” pathway, which changes
  in each transition as a consequence of pathway rewiring: it initially belongs to
  the “GPCR signaling community,” it is not found in any community in panel b (as
  it is not perturbed in this transition), and finally, it belongs to the “ECM organization
  community”'
