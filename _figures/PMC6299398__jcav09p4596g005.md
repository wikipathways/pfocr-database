caption: Affected pathways in group 4 medulloblastoma. The SHH pathway is inactivated
  and Wnt pathway is activated for group 4. Gain-of-function mutations in MUC16 can
  result in activation of the Wnt pathway by enhancing the transcriptional activity
  of CTNNB1. PCDH9 gain-of-function mutations can activate GSK3β and suppress Akt,
  however, the effect was unable to suppress the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In the SHH
  pathway, gain-of-function in PTCHD4 leads to greater inhibition of SMO that can
  result in repressed transcription of SHH response genes.
