caption: Proposed mechanism of central insulin resistance as a common pathological
  feature in non-transgenic models of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. In 6-OHDA-
  and MPTP-induced PD models (a) impaired dopaminergic signalling is the predominating
  severe pathological event due to the selectivity of these compounds for entering
  DAT-expressing dopaminergic neurons. The extent of dopaminergic signalling impairment
  accompanied by dopaminergic neuronal loss (particularly in the substantia nigra
  pars compacta) is large enough to cause motoric dysfunction. The molecular mechanism(s)
  of toxicity is related to mitochondrial damage, generation of oxidative stress and
  proinflammatory cytokines which may further damage the respective neuron but also
  the neighbouring astrocytes. However, due to the dopamine—insulin interaction based
  on the co-expression of their major signalling parameters, disturbed dopamine signalling
  may be, to a lesser extent, transduced to insulin signalling downstream the insulin
  receptor pathway, as a secondary, collateral damage. The resulting insulin resistance
  may further lead to cognitive impairment, but also to the accumulation of Alzheimer’s
  (amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated tau protein) and Parkinson’s (alpha-synuclein)
  pathological hallmarks. In the condition generated by STZ administration which induces
  Alzheimer’s disease (b), the insulin receptor and its signalling pathway are the
  primary, direct targets which lead to the insulin resistance state as a predominant
  pathological effect, both in neurons and neighbouring astrocytes expressing the
  targets. Therefore, it is to be expected that the extent of insulinergic signalling
  impairment is large (larger than induced by 6-OHDA/MPTP), because cognitive decline
  is pronounced, associated with pathological accumulation of the respective misfolded
  proteins. Damaged astrocytes can further destroy neighbouring neurons and vice versa,
  STZ-induced mitochondrial damage in the neuron can affect neighbouring astrocytes.
  In this scenario, due to the insulin–dopamine interplay, impaired insulin signalling
  can be transduced to dopaminergic signalling as a secondary, collateral damage (without
  severe dopaminergic neuronal loss), which can possibly be reflected in some motoric
  dysfunction expressed to a much lesser extent than in PD models. PD Parkinson's
