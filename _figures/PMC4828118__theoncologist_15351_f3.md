caption: 'Drugs interfering with breast cancer (BC)- and obesity-related pathways.
  Drugs commonly used in BC, obesity, and diabetes interfere with intracellular signaling
  hyperactivation in BC. Aromatase inhibitors inhibit enzyme aromatase in the conversion
  of androgens, such as testosterone and androstenedione, to estrogens, such as estradiol
  and estrone. SERMs, such as tamoxifen, bind to estrogen receptors and induce conformational
  changes that inhibit the expression of estrogen-related genes. In BC cells, high
  levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, typical in obese patients, activate
  IKKB that phosphorylates IkB, thus activating NF-κB, composed of its subunits p50
  and p65. Furthermore, phosphorylation of TSC1 by IKKB activated by mTOR kinase is
  involved in cell growth and angiogenesis. Drugs targeting IKKB, such as aspirin,
  and mTOR inhibitors, such as everolimus and rapamycin, are potentially effective
  as anti-BC drugs in obese women. Metformin, an antidiabetes drug that can effectively
  reduce body weight, activates AMPK, which phosphorylates TSC2, having an inhibitory
  effect on mTOR. Activation of the mTOR pathway leads to the production of VEGF,
  mediated by transcription factor HIF1α, which could be targeted by bevacizumab.Abbreviations:
  AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; EREs, estrogen response elements; HIF1α, hypoxia
  inducible factor-1α, IKKB, IkB kinase β; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; SERMs, selective
  estrogen receptor modulators; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor.'
