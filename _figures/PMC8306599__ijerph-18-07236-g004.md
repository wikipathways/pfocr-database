caption: 'AGEs in diabetic cardiomyopathy. The effect of the AGEs in diabetic cardiomyopathy
  arises through diverse mechanisms: (a) accumulation in the extracellular matrix
  of cardiac tissue due to the interaction with structural proteins, inducing reticulation
  between collagen fibers and laminin and decreasing the elastic properties of the
  cardiac tissue. (b) Activation of the AGE–RAGE pathway by the induction of TGF-β
  and other proinflammatory cytokines that allow the proliferation of fibroblasts
  conducive to myocardial hypertrophy. (c) Activation of the AGE–RAGE pathway and
  ionic imbalance due to inhibition of the SIRT1/NAD+ pathway, disturbing the function
  of the Na++/K+ ATPase. (d) Overstimulation of the RyR, generating irregular modifications
  of the Ca++ levels, favoring its exit and causing an alteration of the cardiac cycle
  that advances to diastolic dysfunction. Ca++: calcium, K+: potassium, Na++: sodium,
  TGF-β1: transforming growth factor β, and RyR: ryanodine receptors.'
