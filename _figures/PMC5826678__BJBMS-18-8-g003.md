caption: 'Three basic mechanisms of aberrant activation of Hedgehog signaling. (A)
  Type I - Ligand-independent Hedgehog signaling. This type includes: Ptch1 inactivating
  mutation (green asterisk) or Smo activating mutation (red asterisk), thereby Smoothened
  receptor can no longer be inhibited by Patched 1. The result is a constitutive activation
  of Hedgehog pathway in the absence of the ligand. (B) Type II - Ligand-dependent
  autocrine/juxtacrine Hedgehog signaling. The Hedgehog ligand is secreted by the
  tumor cell and taken up into the same tumor cell (autocrine manner) or into the
  nearby tumor cells (juxtacrine manner), thus activating the signal cascade downstream
  of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. (C-1) Type IIIa - Ligand-dependent paracrine
  signaling. The Hedgehog ligand is secreted by tumor cells and taken up by the stromal
  cells. Activated stromal cells synthesize and secrete signals, such as vascular
  endothelial growth factor and insulin-like growth factor, which are then taken back
  into the tumor cells to support their survival and growth. (C-2) Type IIIb - Ligand-dependent
  reverse paracrine signaling. The Hedgehog ligand is directly secreted by stromal
  cells and taken up by the tumor cells. Thus, the ligand helps the tumor cell proliferation
  and growth. Hh - Hedgehog; Ptch1 - Patched 1; Smo - Smoothened; Gli1 - glioma-associated
  oncogene 1; VEGF - vascular endothelial growth factor; IGF - insulin-like growth
  factor.'
