caption: Current L-phg synthesis pathways based on different substrates. (a) Summary
  of natural L-phg synthesis pathway from PPA as substrate. The pathway in bule or
  red background was the L-phg synthesis pathway identified from Streptomyces pristinaespiralis
  or Streptomyces coelicolor and Amycolatopsis orientalis respectively. (b) L-phg
  synthesis pathway from racemic MA. (c) L-phg synthesis pathway from PG.
