caption: The potential regulation pathway of the genes associated with OB morphology,
  oil content and FA compositions. (A) FAs biosynthetic and Acyl-CoA pool formation;
  (B) a schematic model of mature oil body surrounded by OB-membrane proteins; (C)
  a simple Schematic Model of cell division, growth, proliferation. The black characters
  indicate genes detected in previous studies, the red characters indicate the candidate
  genes in this study. The blue dotted materials indicate the combine between genes
  in different classification. The Blue materials indicate the combine between genes
  in same classification. The double-headed arrows indicate genes underlying different
  QTLs which affect the same trait with opposite additive effect at the same time
  based on the WinQTLcart2.5 and QTLNetwork_2.0 results (not the combined results
  of the two). Different colors denote different traits as the bar showed at the lower
  right corner of the picture. The abbreviations of gene name are same with Table
  .
