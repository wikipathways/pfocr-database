caption: Cytokines work as either an inducer or an inhibitor of autophagy. Conversely,
  autophagy inhibits production of cytokines including IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-18 and
  also facilitates the production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL2. Cytokines,
  including IL-6, TNF-α and TGF-β, increase glucose uptake, glycolysis, and ROS scavenging
  pathway. Due to an increased demand of energy, cancer cells shift metabolism from
  mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to anaerobic glycolysis. This shift
  can decrease mitochondrial metabolism accompanied by reduced ROS accumulation. ROS
  as an inflammatory mediator also regulates metabolism in cancer. ROS can induce
  glycolysis through stabilization of HIF-1α. Glycolysis, PPP, glutaminolysis, fatty
  acid oxidation, and one-carbon metabolism act as redox pathway to regulate ROS levels.
  PPP plays an important role in promoting cancer cell proliferation by increasing
  reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to scavenge ROS. NADPH
  is also generated through the non-canonical malate-aspartate shuttle to maintain
  redox balance in PDAC. The expression of aspartate transaminase (GOT1), which convers
  aspartate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) into oxaloacetate (OAA) and glutamate, regulates
  this pathway. Elevated autophagy level in PDAC cells is required for protecting
  cells from ROS, responding to increased metabolic and energy demand, and preventing
  DNA damage, resulting in cancer cell survival.
