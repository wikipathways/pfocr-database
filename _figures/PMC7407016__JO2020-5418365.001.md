caption: 'Regulatory circuits driven by liganded ER-alpha for DNA stabilization (A),
  cell proliferation (B), and fuel supply (C). Circuit A: Estrogen- (E2) activated
  estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) upregulates estrogen signaling via a regulatory circuit
  together with genome stabilizer protein (BRCA1) and aromatase enzyme (A450). Activated
  ER-alpha induces messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions on ESR1, BRCA1, and Cyp19A aromatase
  promoter regions upregulating the synthesis of ER-alpha, BRCA1, and aromatase enzyme.
  Aromatase enzyme produces estrogen hormones for further ER activation. In addition,
  activated ER-alpha may induce activating mutations on ESR1, BRCA1, and Cyp19A genes
  through the expression and activation of appropriate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).
  In addition, ER-alpha and BRCA proteins are capable of direct binding as transcriptional
  factors regulating each other''s activity. Circuit B: Estrogen activated ERα is
  the crucial regulator of increased and decreased cell proliferation in strong interplay
  with membrane-associated tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, EGFRs and IGF-1Rs.
  ERs regulate the expression and activation of growth factors (GFs) and their receptors.
  Transduction of growth factor signaling (GFS) induces kinase cascades via PI3-K/AKT/mTOR
  and RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK pathways, which are transmitted into the nucleus inducing expressions
  of specific genes through an unliganded activation of ERs. Circuit C: Estrogen activated
  ERα is the regulator of all steps of cellular glucose uptake and the maintenance
  of glucose homeostasis. Estrogen-regulated genes stimulate both insulin synthesis
  and insulin receptor (IR) expression. Activated ERα stimulates the expression and
  activation of GLUT4 facilitating cellular glucose uptake. In addition, estrogen-activated
  ERα at the plasma membrane stimulates the kinase cascade of the PI3-K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  via IRS-1 activation. These signals induce specific gene expressions in the nucleus
  conferred by unliganded ERα activation. CA: coactivator, AF2: ligand binding domain,
  and AF1: nonligand binding domain.'
