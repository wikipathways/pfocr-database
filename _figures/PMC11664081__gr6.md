caption: There are three main ERG biosynthetic pathways. (A) Anaerobic biosynthetic
  pathway, it occurs mainly in Chlorobium limicola, catalyzed by EanA and EanB. (B)
  Eukaryotic biosynthesis pathway, it occurs mainly in Neurospora crassa, catalyzed
  by Egt1 and Egt2. (C) Prokaryotic biosynthesis pathway, it occurs mainly in Mycobacterium
  smegmatis, catalyzed by ﬁve enzymatic steps, involving EgtA, EgtB, EgtC, EgtD, and
  EgtE
