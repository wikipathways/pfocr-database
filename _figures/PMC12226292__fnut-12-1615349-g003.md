caption: Explain the mechanism by which M. oleifera polysaccharides (MOLP) mitigate
  inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves modulation of gut microbiota composition
  and subsequent dampening of pro-inflammatory signaling. In IBD, dysbiosis is characterized
  by an increased abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidetes and
  Helicobacter) and a reduction in anti-inflammatory taxa (e.g., Firmicutes) contributes
  to mucosal barrier disruption and increased intestinal permeability. Oral administration
  of powdered M. oleifera leaves, rich in MOLP, appears to shift the gut microbial
  profile towards a more favorable composition, evidenced by increased beneficial
  genera such as Lactobacillus and the phylum Firmicutes. This modulation of the gut
  microbiota is associated with the downregulation of NF-κB signaling pathway and
  a consequent regulation of cytokine production, leading to a reduction in intestinal
  inflammation
