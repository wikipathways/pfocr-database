caption: TNF‐α/TNFR1 mediates the major signaling pathway of necroptosis. The binding
  of TNFR1 to TNF trimer leads to the formation of complex I at the cytoplasmic membrane
  consisting of TRADD, TRAF2, RIPK1, CYLD, and cIAP1/cIAP2. cIAP1/cIAP2 ubiquitinates
  RIPK1, activates the IKK complex, leading to the activation of NF‐κB and the activation
  of survival pathways. In the absence of cIAP1/cIAP2, RIPK1, TRADD, FADD, and caspase‐8
  form complex IIa. The high local concentration of pro‐caspase 8 induces caspase
  8 activation through autocleavage and trans‐cleavage from other active caspases.
  Caspase 8 then cleaves caspase 3 and caspase 7 and then induces apoptosis. When
  caspase‐8 activity is inhibited, complex IIb becomes the dominant signaling pathway.
  RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL form necrosomes and accelerate the polymerization of MLKL
  to form oligomers that are transported to the plasma membrane. MLKL binds to phosphatidylinositol
  phosphates on the inner membrane, disrupting the integrity of the cell membrane
  and leading to the release of intracellular contents. This process leads to cell
  swelling, rupture, and ultimately cell necroptosis
