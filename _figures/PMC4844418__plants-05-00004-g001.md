caption: 'Proposed model for interconversion routes between jasmonic acid (JA) and
  its Ile-conjugated/ω-oxidized derivatives upon leaf stress responses or flower maturation,
  with emphasis on quantitative aspects as explained in main text. Upon leaf stress
  responses (wounding or B. cinerea infection) or flower maturation JA synthesis is
  activated to different extents, mechanical wounding providing the strongest burst.
  JA can be modified via different metabolic routes, one being the formation of jasmonoyl-isoleucine
  (JA-Ile) by JAR1 or related conjugating enzymes. JA-Ile is then either ω-oxidized
  by the action of CYP94 family enzymes to its hydroxy- (12OH-JA-Ile) or carboxy-
  (12COOH-JA-Ile) derivatives. In addition, JA-Ile and 12OH-JA-Ile can be hydrolyzed
  by the amidohydrolases IAR3 and ILL6, leading to the formation of JA and 12OH-JA,
  respectively. The thickness of arrows for the main JA metabolic pathway (from JA
  to 12COOH-JA-Ile) reflects the abundance of a given reaction product in each physiological
  context as detailed in Discussion. Comparative analysis of jasmonate profiles in
  the three biological systems as described in this paper shows that adequate JA-Ile
  levels can be achieved with distinct upstream and downstream metabolite pool sizes
  through the action of common enzymes. Blue—flower maturation, green—leaf wounding,
  purple—leaf B. cinerea infection. Predominant enzymes performing a given reaction
  are mentioned as follows: CYP94C1: C1, CYP94B1: B1, CYP94B3: B3, ST2a—sulfotransferase
  2a. The compounds are shown in (3,7)-cis stereochemistry.'
