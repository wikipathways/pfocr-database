caption: Autophagy as an anti-inflammatory process. Activation of macrophages upon
  IFNγ and LPS treatment results in classically activated macrophages, which are more
  phagocytic, microbicidal and inflammatory in nature. During classical activation,
  autophagy is inhibited in a NO-dependent manner. This coincides with mitochondrial
  depolarization and accumulation of such depolarized mitochondria due to lack of
  mitophagy (since the core machinery for autophagy and mitophagy are same). Depolarized
  mitochondria are source of heightened reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) in the
  activated macrophages and also activates NLRP3 mediated inflammasome pathway and
  secretion of cytokines like IL1β and IL18. Inhibition of autophagy occurs in mToR/Akt
  dependent manner and inhibition of Akt signaling can alleviate the autophagy levels
  and control mitochondrial depolarization by directing damaged mitochondria toward
  mitophagy. Together, inhibition of autophagy in these cells helps achieve the pro-inflammatory
  phenotype, establishing the anti-inflammatory function of autophagy. Similar events
  also occur when macrophages are exposed to hypoxia, with the exception of NO production,
  which does not occur under hypoxia.
