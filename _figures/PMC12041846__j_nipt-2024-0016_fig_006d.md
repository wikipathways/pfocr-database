caption: Regulation of DEGs from GSE49028 dataset of binge ethanol-treated mice on
  signaling pathways related to anxiety and locomotor activity. Regulation of glutamate
  binding, activation of AMPA receptors and synaptic plasticity through overlay of
  DEGs onto glutamate binding, activation of AMPA receptors and synaptic plasticity.
  Ca+ and K+ transport was predicted to be activated (z-score activation=1.265, −log(p-value)=1.41)
