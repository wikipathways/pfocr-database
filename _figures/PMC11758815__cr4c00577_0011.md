caption: Cobalt signaling. Cobalt is taken up into the cell by a divalent cation channel
  and has been shown to activate the HIF-1α signaling pathway. Cobalt is a key component
  of vitamin B12 (cobalamin), which is necessary for the activity of enzymes implicated
  in DNA synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, synthesis of myelin,
  and red blood cell maturation. Cobalamin binds to transcobalamin, and this complex
  goes to lysosomes by transcobalamin receptor-mediated endocytosis. Then, cobalamin
  allows for the generation of methionine in the cytosol and succinyl-CoA in mitochondria.
