caption: The Stat5a/b pathway (see Box 2 for explanations) appears to be the major,
  if not the only, signaling pathway triggered by the PrlR in mouse and human prostate
  epithelial cells. Physical interactions between Stat5 and AR have been documented,
  providing a mechanistic basis for crosstalk between these two pathways resulting
  in reciprocal synergistic effects. Various levels of inhibition of this signaling
  cascade are in development (represented in yellow), which involve targeting of PrlR
  activation (competitive PrlR antagonist), Jak2 activity/stability (Jak2 inhibitors),
  and Stat5 DNA binding/expression (Stat5 inhibitors).
