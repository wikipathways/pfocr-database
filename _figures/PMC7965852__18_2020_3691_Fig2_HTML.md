caption: Mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated lineage transition. Transcription factors (such
  as SOX family), histone-modifying enzymes (such as enhancer of zeste homologue 2
  (EZH2) and RE1-slienicng transcription factor (REST)) regulate the reprogramming
  tumor cells into slow-cycling, drug-tolerant states. LncRNAs such as lincRNA-p21,
  TUG1, linc-PINT, HOXA11-AS, SOX2-OT, FBXL19-AS1, LINC00514, FENDRR are implicated
  in the reprogramming process. Alterations in several key signaling pathways such
  as WNT-β-catenin pathway, IL-6/STAT3 pathway, NF-κB pathway and YAP pathway promote
  phenotypic switching upon TKI treatment. lncRNAs such as MALAT1, GHET1, SNHG1, NEAT1,
  H19 TNK2-AS1 are involved in these key signaling pathways. Crosstalk with the tumor
  microenvironment, through secretion of various cytokines from cancer-associated
  fibroblasts such as hepatocyte growth factor(HGF), growth arrest-specific protein
  6 (GAS6), CXC-chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming
  growth factorβ (TGFβ); cytokines from endothelial cells such as epidermal growth
  factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF); Interluekin-6 (IL-6),
  VEGF from tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) controls tumor plasticity. The enhanced
  cell–cell adhesion via increased expression of integrin β1 and N-cadherin in tumor
  cells and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness via Serpin B2 can also
  promote tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) resistance. LncRNAs involved in the M2
  polarization of macrophage such as XIST and GNAS-AS1 played a part in TKI resistance.
  Lastly, low level of oxygen can active hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) in tumor
  cells, causing autocrine signaling by secretion of TGFα, VEGF and insulin-like growth
  factor (IGF-1), which promotes resistance to TKI therapy. TFs transcription factors,
