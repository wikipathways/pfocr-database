caption: The Wnt pathway can be classified as canonical and non-canonical. In the
  canonical pathway, Wnt signaling when it is on inhibits the degradation of β-catenin,
  which can regulate transcription of many genes. Wnt signaling is activated by binding
  of Wnt proteins to surface receptors composed of the seven transmembrane frizzled
  proteins and the LRP5/6. Upon binding, the cytoplasmic protein disheveled (Dvl)
  is activated. Activation of Dvl induces the dissociation of GSK-3β from Axin and
  leads to the inhibition of GSK-3β. Next, the phosphorylation and degradation of
  β-catenin is inhibited because of the inactivation of the “destruction complex”.
  Subsequently, stabilized β-catenin translocates into the nucleus leading to transcription
  of target genes like C-Myc and Cyclin D1. RNF43 (Ring finger protein 43) / ZNRF3
  promote FZD receptor turnover. R-spondins or RSPO’s bind to RNF43/ZNRF3 causing
  their ubiquitination and clearance, resulting in increased cell surface FZD receptors.
