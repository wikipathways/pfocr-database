caption: MAPK signalling pathway and PI3K/IP3signalling pathway in C. neoformans.
  Protein kinase C (Pkc1) phosphorylates MAPKKK (Bck1) and subsequent phosphorylations
  of MAPKK (Mkk2) by Bck1 and MAPK (Mpk1) by Mkk2 induce downstream components for
  virulence traits. Pkc1 also signals through a MAPK-independent pathway. The MAPK
  Hog1, which is activated by Pbs2, triggers virulence factor production. Although
  the exact architecture of the upstream part of the HOG pathway is unknown, the likely
  players are hybrid sensor kinases Tco1/2, Ypd1 and the response regulator Ssk1.
  Ste12 is a transcription factor involved in the mating MAPK pathway, but how it
  contributes to virulence is unclear. Phospholipase (Plc1) activates the PKC/MAPK
  pathway through two different routes, one of which involves diacylglycerol (DAG).
  IP3 is involved in the release of cytosolic Ca2+. PI3K signalling induces virulence
  traits through PIP3. PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate.
