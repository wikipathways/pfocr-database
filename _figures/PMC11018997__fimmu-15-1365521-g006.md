caption: Roles of 3Dpol in subverting host innate immunity. ①The RIG-I/MDA5/LGP2-MAVS
  pathway recruits downstream adaptors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated
  factor 3 (TRAF3), TRAF6, and the TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK),
  to directly induce the TBK1-IKKϵ-NEMO complex. These signaling cascades lead to
  the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and NF-κB in the nucleus,
  where they promote the expression of interferons (IFNs), interferon-stimulated genes
  (ISGs) and proinflammatory cytokines (). ②NOD2 signaling induces the activation
  of MAVS and the IKKα-IKKβ-NEMO complex. ③IFNs bind to IFN-α/β receptors (IFNARs),
  activating the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT)
  pathway to amplify IFN production (). Moreover, (i) PGAM5 affects mitochondrial
  morphology and affects the expression of MFN2, and MFN2 binds to MAVs to inhibit
  the RIG-I-like signaling pathway; (ii) Beclin-1 is a negative regulator of the RIG-I-MAVS-mediated
  IFN response. Figure adapted from ().
