caption: The ubiquitin-binding activity of HDAC6. The presence of a ubiquitin-binding
  domain in HDAC6 allows it to interact with higher affinity to poly-ubiquitinated
  protein chains. (A) Under physiological conditions, HDAC6 and the chaperone-like
  P97/VCP constitute a complex whereas an excess of P97/VCP over HDAC6 facilitates
  the release of ubiquitinated proteins for degradation in the proteasome. (B) In
  several neurodegenerative disorders, the formation of protein aggregates leads to
  a dysfunctional ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and consequent accumulation of
  poly-ubiquitinated proteins. HDAC6 senses the increase in poly-ubiquitin chains
  and binds to them with higher affinity coordinating an alternative cellular protein
  degradation pathway.
