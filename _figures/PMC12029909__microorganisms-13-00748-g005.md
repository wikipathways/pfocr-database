caption: (a) Screening for maps of metabolic pathways involved in key differentially
  expressed metabolites. The pathway map includes mainly glycolysis, TCA cycle, Calvin
  cycle, biosynthesis of amino acids, glutathione metabolism, and inositol phosphate
  metabolism. Full name corresponds to the abbreviation in the Supplementary Materials.
  (b–n) Cylindrical chart of the content changes of 13 differentially expressed metabolites.
  Data are presented as the mean and SD. Statistical analysis was performed using
  the Student’s t-test. (n = 6, * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001)
