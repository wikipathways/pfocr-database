caption: Activation of Nrf2 and AhR signaling pathways. Inorganic components of PM,
  such as metals, cross the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion/membrane transport
  proteins, where they then induce oxidative stress. Organic components such as PAHs
  are able to span the cells’ membrane due to their lipophilic characteristics and
  can also act as AhR ligands. Nrf2 is bound to KEAP-1 in the cytosol; a change in
  redox homeostasis leads to conformational changes, leading to translocation of Nrf2
  to the nucleus. Activation of the Nrf2 pathway is mediated by the ARE enhancer sequence
  in target genes. AhR can be directly activated by PAHs or naturally occurring compounds
  and endogenous ligands, which bind to AhR and facilitate AhR translocation to the
  nucleus, where it binds to XRE and activates phase I/II enzyme genes. Activation
  of the AhR leads to oxidative stress due to metabolism of the ligand and induction
  of CYP enzymes.
