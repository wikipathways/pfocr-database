caption: Comparative framework for the integrative analysis of cardiovascular phenotypes.
  Cardiovascular adaptation in two native species and a recent colonizer of the high-elevation
  QTP (Step 1) was examined using an integrative approach combining phenotypic data
  and gene expression analysis (Step 2), network analysis (Step 3), and functional
  assays (Step 4). The two native species, the White-rumped snowfinch (Onychostruthus
  taczanowskii, WR-snowfinch, dark blue) and Red-necked snowfinch (Pyrgilauda ruficollis,
  RN-snowfinch, light blue), belong to a lineage of snowfinches that have resided
  on the QTP for millions of years. In contrast, the low-elevation tree sparrow (Passer
  montanus, L-tree sparrow, gray) colonized the QTP much more recently, following
  the establishment of permanent agricultural settlements approximately 2,600 years
  ago (H-tree sparrow, green). Using this framework, we found that the two native
  species exhibit similar cardiovascular phenotypes and gene expression changes, which
  are highly distinct from those observed in the recent colonizer. A siRNA functional
  assay demonstrated that differential expression of key genes (AKT1 and IRS2) in
  a conserved regulatory pathway mediating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy underlies the
  major phenotypic differences between natives and colonizers
