caption: (A) Drosophila Toll pathway. Drosophila Toll controls dorsoventral axis formation
  during development and the antifungal and anti-gram-positive organism immune response
  in the adult fly. In both cases, triggering relies on binding of a host-derived
  protein, named Spätzle, which is produced as a zymogen that is activated through
  a serine protease cascade. This proteolytic cascade involves different proteases,
  both in development and in response to fungal or bacterial challenge. In the Drosophila
  immune response, the protease cascade is activated by upstream pattern recognition
  receptors, such as soluble PGRP-SA, which circulates in the hemolymph and recognizes
  gram-positive pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The pattern recognition receptor
  responsible for fungal detection has not been characterized yet but may be another
  member of the PGRP family. Triggering of Toll leads to the recruitment of two adaptor
  proteins, a MyD88 homolog, Drosophila MyD88 (dMyD88), and tube, a protein with no
  known homolog in vertebrates. They further transmit the signal to other signaling
  intermediates and eventually induce the activation of the NF-κB homologue Dif. (B)
  Drosophila immune deficiency pathway. The immune deficiency (imd) pathway regulates
  the gram-negative organism immune response in D. melanogaster and was named after
  one of its intracellular signaling molecules, imd, as the upstream receptor has
  long been unknown. Recent studies led to the identification of PGRP-LC as the putative
  gram-negative pattern recognition receptor. PGRP-LC lacks intracellular signaling
  motifs and might act in concert with a coreceptor or might trigger a protease cascade,
  which then leads to generation of a ligand for the immune deficiency receptor, analogous
  to the Toll pathway. Triggering of the immune deficiency receptor induces a signaling
  cascade which leads to activation of the NF-κB-like transcription factor Relish.
