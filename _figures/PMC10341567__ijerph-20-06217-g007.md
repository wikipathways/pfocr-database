caption: The TREM2/DAP12 pathway. In this pathway, various ligands bind to TREM2 which
  creates an electrostatic interaction between TREM2 and DAP12. This interaction generates
  tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12 with ITAM. This recruits the Syk kinase to activate
  signaling molecules such as PIP3, which then activates Akt. Through the Akt pathway,
  GSK3B is inhibited and therefore B-catenin is stabilized. The activation of Akt
  also activates NFκB, and NFκ B then relocates into the nucleus and binds to DNA.
  This increases the release of proinflammatory cytokines into the cytoplasm
