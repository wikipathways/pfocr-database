caption: Repair of DSBs by the microhomology-mediated end-joining pathway. 1) Introduction
  of a DSB break. 2) PARP-1 (PARP) mediates the rapid recruitment of MRN and CtIP
  to the DSB end. CtIP enhances the MRN endonuclease activity resulting in an internal
  single-strand break within the 5′ strand. The short single-strand fragment at the
  DSB end is then degraded by the MRN exonuclease activity. 3) Short regions of sequence
  complementarity, ranging from 2 to 20 nucleotides, are exposed within the RPA-coated
  single-strand regions. 4) The DNA ends are transiently aligned via the short microhomologies.
  PARP-1, MRN, and Pol θ have each been implicated in the end alignment. It is likely
  that a similar, possibly MRN independent process of end alignment also occurs between
  ends that are being resected by the long-range exonucleases, Exo1 and DNA2 (see
  , step 3). 5) Nonhomologous 3′ tails are removed prior to error-prone gap-filling
  DNA synthesis by Pol θ. It is assumed that several functionally redundant nucleases
  will participate in end processing. 6) Both strands are ligated by the LigIIIα–XRCC1
  complex (LigIII/XRCC1). 7) The DNA duplexes generated by MMEJ are characterized
  by deletions and the presence of sequence microhomologies at the repair site.
