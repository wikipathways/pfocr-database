caption: Proposed bicyclic autotrophic HCO3− assimilation pathway of C. aurantiacus.
  (Left) In the first cycle, two molecules of bicarbonate are assimilated to form
  glyoxylate as the primary fixation product. (Right) In the second cycle, glyoxylate
  and propionyl-CoA are condensed to β-methylmalyl-CoA, which is converted to acetyl-CoA
  and pyruvate. Propionyl-CoA is regenerated from acetyl-CoA and CO2 with enzymes
  of the first cycle. 1, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase; 2, malonyl-CoA reductase; 3, propionyl-CoA
  synthase; 4, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; 5, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase; 6, methylmalonyl-CoA
  mutase; 7, citric acid cycle enzymes (succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase);
  8, succinyl-CoA:l-malate CoA transferase; 9, l-malyl-CoA lyase/erythro-β-methylmalyl-CoA
  lyase; 10, proposed β-methylmalyl-CoA dehydratase; 11, postulated mesaconyl-CoA-transforming
  enzymes; 12, succinyl-CoA:d-citramalate CoA transferase; 13, d-citramalyl-CoA lyase;
