caption: 'Alcohol affects local translation of proteins in amygdala of alcohol-dependent
  rats. Alcohol exposure using conditioning chambers, as well as a non-pharmacologically
  active alcohol injection (priming) that served as an odor-taste cue, increased mTORC1
  (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) activation and the phosphorylation/activation
  of its downstream substrates, such as eukaryotic translation initiation factor-4E
  binding protein (4E-BP), S6 kinase (S6K) and the S6K substrates, and increased expression
  of post-synaptic density-95 (PSD95) and the AMPA receptor GluA1 subunit (). These
  effects were abolished by the mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin. A second pathway by which
  alcohol mediates synaptic translation is by increasing extracellular glutamate.
  This leads to activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) and activity-dependent
  release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF then binds and stimulates
  its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), activating downstream signaling
  pathways, including phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K), Akt and Ras, stimulating
  mTORC1, which culminates in the signaling effects described above. The increased
  GluA1-subunits are inserted into the membrane, increasing excitation and alcohol-sensitive
  substrates. Thus, mTORC1 activation mediates the translation of specific synaptic
  proteins that are important in plasticity processes. Figure and legend were adapted
  from . Abbreviations: 4E-BP, 4E binding protein; eEF2K, eukaryotic elongation factor-2
  kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; P indicates
  phosphorylated protein.'
