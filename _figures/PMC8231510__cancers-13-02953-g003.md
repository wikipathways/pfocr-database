caption: 'Biochemical activities of CUT domains in base excision repair. Diagrammatic
  representation of the steps involved in base excision repair, showing the enzymatic
  reactions that were found to be stimulated by CUT domains: substrate binding by
  OGG1, the glycosylase and AP-lyase activities of OGG1, the 5′-incision by APE1,
  and the polymerase and strand-displacement activities of DNA pol β. Base excision
  repair (BER) is initiated by a DNA glycosylase that is specific for the particular
  type of altered base []. DNA glycosylases for oxidized bases (OGG1, NTHL1, NEIL1,
  and NEIL2) carry out two enzymatic reactions: the glycosylase activity removes the
  oxidized base, while the AP-lyase activity introduces a single-strand break with
  a 3′-phospho-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (3′-PUA) in the case of OGG1. This 3′-PUA
  is converted to a 3′-OH by the 3′-phosphodiesterase activity of APE1. UDG and MPG
  are monofunctional and only carry out the glycosylase activity, following which
  APE1 produces a single-strand incision with a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (5′-dRP).
  This 5′-dRP is converted into a 5′-phosphate through the dRP-lyase activity of Pol
  β, which also introduces a single nucleotide in short-patch repair. It is not clear
  whether Pol β dRP-lyase activity or polymerase activity takes place first. When
  the 5′dRP is not removed, the pathway switches to long-patch repair, whereby a stretch
  of 2–13 nucleotides is synthesized by Pol β or Pol δ/ε aided by PCNA and RFC (not
  shown here). Not shown in this diagram is the XRCC1 scaffolding protein which interacts
  with Pol β and Lig3.'
