caption: (a) Glucose metabolism and cell death regulation intersect at several levels.
  Glucose metabolizing enzymes, including hexokinase II (HKII), glucokinase (GK),
  the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase TIGAR (Tp53-induced Glycolysis and Apoptosis Regulator),
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and others, are involved in the
  regulation of cell death through different mechanisms. Phosphoprotein-enriched in
  astrocytes (PEA15) might function as a molecular linker between HKII and TIGAR under
  certain conditions. Flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) generates NADPH,
  which is important for neuronal redox environment and inhibits cell death. (b) and
  (c) The expression of HKII in neurons is upregulated under hypoxic conditions. Together
  with PEA15 it functions as a molecular switch to regulate neuronal viability depending
  on the metabolic state []. HKII and PEA15 interact and bind to mitochondria through
  the outer-mitochondrial membrane voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). During
  hypoxia, HKII protects cells from cell death, whereas during glucose deprivation,
  where HKII detaches from mitochondria and the interaction with PEA15 is destabilized,
  HKII promotes cell death []. HKII also interacts with TIGAR under hypoxic conditions
  []. Similar to PEA15, which increases the capacity of HKII to protect neurons, TIGAR
  increases the glycolytic activity of HKII. However, the exact mechanistic link is
  presently unknown. Glc, glucose; GLUT, glucose transporter; Glc-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  Fru-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; Gal-3-P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; Lac, lactate;
  NADPH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; Pyr, pyruvate; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; IMM, inner mitochondrial
  membrane. HKII was rendered in Pymol using structure 2nzt (RCSB Protein Data Bank).
