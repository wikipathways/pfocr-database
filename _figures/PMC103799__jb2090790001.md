caption: 'The ECA biosynthetic pathway and genes of the wec gene cluster. (A) Current
  status of our knowledge concerning the enzymatic reactions involved in the biosynthesis
  and assembly of ECA. The genetic determinants of the various enzymes are indicated
  next to the reaction catalyzed by each of the respective enzymes. Abbreviations
  are as follows: Und-P, undecaprenylmonophosphate; Und-PP, undecaprenylpyrophosphate;
  Glc, glucose; GlcNAc, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; ManNAc, N-acetyl-d-mannosamine; ManNAcA,
  N-acetyl-d-mannosaminuronic acid; Glc-1-P, glucose 1-phosphate; FucNH2, 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose;
  Fuc4NAc, 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose; CoASH, coenzyme A; α-KG, α-ketoglutaric
  acid; PPi, inorganic pyrophosphate; ECAPG, phosphoglyceride-linked ECA polysaccharide
  chains. The structures of lipids I, II, and III are defined in the inset. (B) The
  wec gene cluster. Arrowheads designate the direction of transcription. The 14-kb
  scale below the gene cluster is provided for reference.'
