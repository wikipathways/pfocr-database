caption: Modulation of BMI1 expression by bTrCP, and its effect on cell proliferation,
  apoptosis, senescence, and oncogenesis. (A) BMI1 inhibits signaling through the
  IN K4A-ARF tumor suppressor locus through repression of p16 and p19, resulting in
  loss of p53 and RB cell cycle regulation, inhibition of senescence and reduced apoptosis.
  (B) Association of BMI1 with bTrCP results in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation
  of BMI1, senescence, inhibition of the cell cycle, and increased apoptosis. (C)
  Mutation of the βTrCP binding binding site of BMI1 results in increased protein
  stability and biologic activity, leading to increased cell proliferation, reduced
  senescence and invasiveness. *BMI1 regulates both p19ARF-MDM2-P53 and p16IN K4A-pRB
  pathways in mouse cells, while it primarily regulates the p16IN K4A-pRB pathway
  in human cells. The p19ARF- (p14ARF-in human) MDM2-P53 pathway regulation by BMI1
  in human cells may be cell type-specific.
