caption: Damaged or slow-growing disks signal to the other tissues to reduce their
  growth and prolong development. Damaged or slow-growing disks signal their status
  within the tissue by upregulating stress signaling via the JNK pathway and the apoptotic
  machinery protein p53. They signal their slow growth to the rest of the body, at
  least in part, through retinoid signaling and potentially through Neural Lazarillo
  (NLaz). This reduces ecdysone synthesis by the prothoracic gland (top tissue in
  box), reduces growth of another normally growing disks (leg disk in middle), and
  reduces PTTH (PTTH cells in yellow) and may reduce the production of insulin like
  peptides (dILP) from the insulin producing cells (in red) in the brain (bottom tissue).
  In this manner, growth-perturbed disks delay development although the larvae eventually
  metamorphose to produce normally sized adults.
