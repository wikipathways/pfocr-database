caption: 'Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) pathogenesis and treatment. Phase I: Inflammation.
  Pretransplantation conditioning and acute GVHD (aGVHD) cause thymus injury. Phase
  II: T and B cell dysfunction. The resulting thymic dysfunction impairs donor regulatory
  T cell (Treg) generation and the negative selection of autoreactive donor T cell
  clones that escape into the periphery. Balanced Treg/T effector cell reconstitution
  can be restored by low-dose IL-2 treatment. Donor T follicular helper (Tfh) cells
  expand in secondary lymphoid organs and promote germinal center (GC) reactions and
  survival, expansion, and differentiation of donor B cells into antihost-immunoglobulin-producing
  plasma cells via IL-21 secretion. T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells suppress Tfh
  cell:B cell interactions and antibody production. The Rho-associated coiled-coil
  kinase 2 (ROCK2) inhibitor, KD025, blocks Th17 differentiation and GC reactions
  by inhibiting Tfh cell generation. Donor B cells receive activating signals via
  multiple pathways during cGVHD. B cell receptor signaling activates the tyrosine
  kinase Syk, inhibited by fostamatinib and Entospletinib, and Bruton tyrosine kinase
  (BTK), inhibited by ibrutinib. IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) signals via the Jak1/2-STAT3
  pathway and can be targeted by Jak1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib or KD025. B cell-activating
  factor (BAFF) provides crucial prosurvival and mitogenic signals that can be blocked
  by anti-BAFF antibodies (e.g., belimumab). Donor B cell subsets can be depleted
  by the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. Differentiated plasma cells secrete affinity-matured,
  antihost reactive immunoglobulin. Phase III: Fibrosis. Plasma cell-derived immunoglobulin
  is deposited in host tissues and stimulates donor CSF1-R+ macrophages, putatively
  via Fc receptor (FcR) ligation, to secrete profibrotic mediators. These include
  TGF-β that stimulates fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix production
  via the tyrosine-kinase receptor TGF-βR and is inhibitable by nilotinib and imatinib.
  The Hedgehog pathway inhibitor glasdegib and ROCK2 inhibitor KD025 each can directly
  ameliorate fibrosis. Abbreviations: Ab, antibody; CSF1, colony-stimulating factor
  1; DC, dendritic cell; HSCT, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Mφ, macrophage;
  Th17, type 17 T helper. Figure adapted from images created with BioRender.com.'
