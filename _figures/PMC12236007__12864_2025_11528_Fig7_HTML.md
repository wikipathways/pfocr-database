caption: Hypothesis schematic models illustrates that Myh3 regulates the development
  of porcine intramuscular preadipocytes through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway to
  affect IMF content. The left dashed box shows the correlation between SNPs of Myh3
  and IMF traits of Beijing Black pigs (n = 413). The Myh3 gene promoted the development
  of intramuscular preadipocytes through inhibited the p38 MAPK signaling pathway,
  which led to the increase of IMF content in pigs (mechanism diagram on the right)
