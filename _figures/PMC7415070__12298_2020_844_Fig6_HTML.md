caption: Biosynthetic pathway of important redox-sensitive flavonoids and phenolic
  acids studied for the experimental rice cultivars raised from PISS highlighting
  differential utilization of cinnamic acid and chalcone synthase-related polyphenolic
  compound biosynthesis for the experimental rice cultivars (Cultivars Patnai & IR29).
  Color intensity within blocks under individual phenolic compounds represents their
  relative abundance
