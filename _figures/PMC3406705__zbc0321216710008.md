caption: Hypothetical model elucidating the regulation of phosphorylated FAK expression
  through an integrin α5 and β1-mediated MEK-ERK1/2-dependent pathway after ESWT.
  ESW directly stimulates integrin α5 and β1 mRNA expression inside the cell nucleus,
  and then the integrin protein expression is increased. Integrins induce MEK1/2 to
  phosphorylate ERK1/2, and then the activated ERK1/2 phosphorylates FAK and enhances
  its binding to the corresponding sites located in the adhesion sites, finally resulting
  in the enhancement of adhesion and migration. The Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway may
  also be involved in ESW-induced integrin-FAK signaling. The conformational activation
  of existing integrin α5/β1 complexes at the osteoblast surfaces may also be an additional
  potential mechanism that requires our further study.
