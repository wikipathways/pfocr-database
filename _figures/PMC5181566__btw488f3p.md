caption: '(A) Two sets of peripheral proteins (blue and red) with the same core proteins
  (green) are shown. In this example, most of the proteins were related to cancer
  development. However, the proteins that participate in blue peripherals and red
  peripherals had different functions. Genes in the clusters: AKT1: v-akt murine thymoma
  viral oncogene homolog 1; AR: Androgen receptor; BRCA1: Breast cancer 1, early onset;
  CREBBP: CREB-binding protein; CTNNB1: Catenin (cadherin-associated protein), beta
  1, 88 kDa; EP300: E1A-binding protein p300; ESR1: Estrogen receptor 1; JUN: Jun
  proto-oncogene; RB1: Retinoblastoma 1; RELA: v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral
  oncogene homolog A; SMAD1: SMAD family member 1; SMAD2: SMAD family member 2; SMAD3:
  SMAD family member 3; SMAD4: SMAD family member 4; SP1: Sp1 transcription factor;
  STAT3: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (acute-phase response
  factor); TP53: Tumor protein p53; UBE2I: Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2I (B) Most
  of the core-proteins (green) were involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is
  related to cancer, generally; however, peripheral-proteins involved specific cancer
  development pathways. Genes in the clusters: AKT1: v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene
  homolog 1; AR: Androgen receptor; BRCA1: Breast cancer 1, early onset; CREBBP: CREB-binding
  protein; CTNNB1: Catenin (cadherin-associated protein), beta 1, 88 kDa; EP300: E1A-binding
  protein p300; ESR1: Estrogen receptor 1; JUN: Jun proto-oncogene; MAPK1: Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 1; RB1: Retinoblastoma 1; SMAD1: SMAD family member 1; SMAD2: SMAD
  family member 2; SMAD3: SMAD family member 3; SMAD4: SMAD family member 4; SMAD9:
  SMAD family member 9; SP1: Sp1 transcription factor; STAT3: Signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3 (acute-phase response factor); TGFBR1: Transforming
  growth factor, beta receptor 1; TP53: Tumor protein p53; UBE2I: Ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme E2I'
