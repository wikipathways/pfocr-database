caption: 'CTGF Signaling in ChondrocytesCTGF interacts with (an) unknown receptor(s)
  on the surface of chondrocytes via binding of one or more of its four distinct modules.
  This interaction triggers various intracellular pathways. PKC plays an important
  upstream role in chondrocyte proliferation, maturation, and terminal differentiation
  via its activation of MEK, p38, and PKB, respectively. CTGF also activates the JNK
  pathway, which stimulates chondrocyte proliferation. CTGF-mediated activation of
  PI3K also stimulates chondrocyte terminal differentiation via PKB. (Note: This figure
