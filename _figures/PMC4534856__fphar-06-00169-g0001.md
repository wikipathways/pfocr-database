caption: Distinct PI3K isoenzymes control specific cardiovascular processes. Class
  I PI3Kγ is enriched in immune cells and primarily controls leukocyte infiltration
  in the myocardium and arteries, a key pathogenic event in both heart failure and
  atherosclerosis. Following receptor activation, PI3Kγ catalyzes the production of
  the lipid second messenger PIP3 which in turn promotes leukocyte migration and ROS
  production. On the other hand, cardiomyocyte PI3Kγ is a dual face enzyme which negatively
  regulates β-AR/cAMP signaling during the natural history of heart failure, via kinase-dependent
  and independent events. By serving as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP), PI3Kγ
  tethers major PDE isoforms near their activator PKA. PI3Kγ-bound PKA phosphorylates
  and activates PDEs, which in turn shape discrete microdomains of cAMP/PKA action,
  ultimately depressing cardiac contractility. In physiological conditions, PI3Kγ
  lipid kinase activity is inhibited by PKA, but escapes PKA-mediated blockade in
  failing hearts where it critically contributes to PIP3-dependent β-AR internalization.
  Conversely, the other major cardiac PI3K isoform, PI3Kα, is engaged by RTKs and
  provides positive control of myocardial contractility and hypertrophy via the PIP3/Akt
  classical pathway in response to diverse stimuli, such as pressure overload and
  myocardial infarction. Class I PI3Kβ instead appears to function not only as a kinase
  downstream GPCRs and RTKs, but also as a scaffold protein, which associates with
  Rab5 within the Rab5-Vps34-Beclin complexes to activate cardiac autophagy. Finally,
  the recently characterized class II PI3K-C2α governs local PtdIns(3)P production
  and likely participates to endosomal trafficking within the cardiovascular system,
  through yet unexplored mechanisms.
