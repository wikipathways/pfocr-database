caption: The effect of miR-135a on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The
  role of miR-135a on the EMT was contradictory. The miR-135a inhibited the EMT by
  decreasing KLF8 and N-cadherin, and increased the epithelial marker, E-cadherin.
  In contrast, miR-135a promoted the EMT via upregulating Snail and activating the
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
