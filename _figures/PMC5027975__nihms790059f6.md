caption: Illustration of key metabolic pathways that were altered in the hindbrain
  of twitcher, an authentic mouse model of Krabbe disease. For simplicity, not all
  biochemical steps or enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways are shown. We found
  that glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (A), the pentose phosphate pathway (B), membrane
  lipid homeostasis (C), and branched-chain amino acid metabolism (D) are all involved
  in the pathogenesis of the twitcher mice.
