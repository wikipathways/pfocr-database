caption: Schematic illustration of breakdown of AA through the nonenzymatic and enzymatic
  pathways. AA breaks down via the nonenzymatic pathways in the presence of elevated
  levels of oxidative stress to give rise to 8- and 5-isoprostanes. The enzymatic
  pathway of AA metabolism can occur via three categories. Cytochrome P450 (P450s)
  modify AA to result in epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and hydroxyeicosatetranoic
  acids (16–20 series of HETEs). The same metabolite (HETE) can also be achieved via
  the lipoxygenase pathways of AA modification (5, 12, and 15 HETE’s). The lipoxygenase
  metabolizes AA to the leukotrienes, in particular cystenyl leukotrienes, cys-LTD4
  and cys-LTE4. The cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway is subdivided to give AA breakdown
  products thromboxanes A2 (TXA2) and stable metabolite TXB2, prostacyclin (PGI2)
  and stable metabolite 6kPGF1α, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGF2α.
