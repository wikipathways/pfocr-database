caption: In healthy conditions, physiological levels of circulating AGEs bind to RAGE
  in the liver evoking a pro-inflammatory signaling. This effect is counteracted by
  the AGE-receptor-1 (AGE-R1) that competes with RAGE for AGEs binding and causes
  internalization and degradation of AGEs. The formation of endogenous AGEs is also
  inhibited by glyoxalase-1 (Glo-1) which detoxifies the AGE precursor methylglyoxal
  using reduced glutathione (GSH) as cofactor. In the liver of obese mice (RAGE+/+LeptrDb−/−)
  (left side of image) AGEs are produced in larger amounts and accumulate intracellularly.
  The expression of RAGE is greatly increased leading to activation of the NLRP3 inflammatory
  pathway. The presence of the alternative AGE receptor Gal-3 is enhanced, but the
  detoxifying systems are not induced. The excess of intracellular AGEs activates
  the de novo lipid synthesis by interfering with the activity of the sterol regulatory
  element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), contributing to hepatosteatosis. When RAGE
  is deleted in the obese background (RAGE−/− LeptrDb−/−) (right side of image), expression
  of galectin-3 (Gal-3) is further increased and is likely to be involved in a compensative
  AGEs trapping from the circulation and AGEs-induced NLRP3 inflammatory signalling.
  The lacking of RAGE is also associated in the liver with reduced AGE-R1 expression
  and Glo-1 activity that fail to detoxify intracellular AGEs, thus contributing to
  the maintenance of high hepatic AGEs levels, and prolonging SREBP1c activation and
  lipids accumulation. Thus, the deletion of RAGE fails to prevent AGE accumulation,
  hepatosteatosis and inflammation in obese mice, due to alterations of other AGE-receptors
  and impairment of AGE-detoxifying system.
