caption: T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) signaling pathway and mechanism
  of action. TIGIT, DNAM-1, CD96, and CD112R are mainly expressed on NK cells and
  T cells, including Tregs. Their ligands CD155, CD111, CD112, and CD113 are expressed
  on cancer cells and antigen-presenting cells such as DCs. Upon ligand binding, TIGIT
  and CD112R deliver negative signals (red arrows) to cells through their cytoplasmic
  regions, thereby either directly inactivating immune cell effector functions, or
  indirectly through Treg-mediated suppression. CD155 also delivers an inhibitory
  signal to cells when bound, resulting in another cell-extrinsic mechanism of immune
  suppression through increased anti-inflammatory and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine
  secretion. DNAM-1 delivers a positive signal to cells when bound to CD155 or CD112
  (green arrows), thus promoting anti-tumor immunity. However, this interaction is
  often outcompeted by TIGIT and CD112R which bind these ligands with higher affinity.
  CD96 has an inhibitory role in mice by negatively controlling NK cell cytokine responses
  []. However, the role of CD96 in humans remains ambiguous with both activating and
  inhibitory functions (orange arrows) having been reported []. Created with BioRender.com.
