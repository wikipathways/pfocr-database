caption: 'Simplified signal transduction of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway.
  The JNK pathway is activated by extracellular stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines
  and stress signals. The JNK signaling cascade consists of three kinases: MAP3K,
  MAP2K, and MAPK, which comprise JNK in this figure. A cascade of kinases forms a
  signaling complex with scaffold proteins, such as JIP1 or β-arrestin2, which enables
  efficient signal transduction. When JNK is activated by sequential phosphorylation
  of upstream kinases, it translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and regulates
  transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2. DUSPs regulate JNK pathway through
  dephosphorylation of MAP3K and MAPK, while DUSPs dephosphorylating MAP2K have still
  not been found. JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAP3K, mitogen-activated protein kinase
