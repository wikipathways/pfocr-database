caption: Illustration of the chondroprotective effects of sUA and the mechanisms underlying
  these effects. In joint inflammation involving both IL-1β and TNF-α, numerous signalling
  pathways and cartilage-damaging enzymes are activated. The inhibitory effects of
  sUA on the ERK-AP-1 signalling pathway were observed at a wide range of physiological
  concentrations of sUA. The ERK-AP-1 pathway targeted by sUA likely contributes to
  the activation of cartilage-damaging enzymes, such as MMP and ADAMTS, and inflammation-related
  molecules, such as iNOS and COX-2.
