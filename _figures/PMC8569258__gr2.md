caption: The molecular protective mechanisms of PG and its ginsenosides against chemotherapy-induced
  side effects. PG or its ginsenosides can regulate Nrf2/HO-1, P62/keap1/Nrf2, JNK/P53/caspase3,
  MEK/ERK, AMPK/mTOR, MKK4/JNK, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Nrf2/HO-1 and P62/keap1/Nrf2
  signaling pathways are classic antioxidant pathways. PG or its ginsenosides exert
  antioxidant effects by up-regulating P62, Nrf2, and HO-1 expressions and down-regulating
  keap1 expression. JNK/P53/caspase3 and MEK/ERK signaling pathways are related to
  cell apoptosis. PG or its ginsenosides show anti-apoptosis effects by inhibiting
  the activation of JNK, P53, and caspase3 and activating the expressions of MEK and
  EKR. AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the genesis and progression
  of autophagy. PG or its ginsenosides regulate AMPK/mTOR pathways by increasing mTOR
  expressions and suppressing AMPK expressions. MKK4/JNK is an essential pathway by
  which PG and its ginsenosides alleviate chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression.
  PG and its ginsenosides regulate MKK4/JNK pathways by promoting MKK4 and JNK expressions.
  The regulation of fatty acid synthase (FASN) is associated with immunomodulatory
  effects. PG or its ginsenosides regulate FASN by inhibiting the activation of PI3K,
  AKT, and SREBP-1.
