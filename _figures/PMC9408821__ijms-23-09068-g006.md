caption: Potential module of the UV-B signaling pathway for regulating nitrate reallocation
  from hypocotyls to leaves and roots. UV-B signaling is initiated by inducing gene
  expression of ACSs and ACOs in shoots, which results in ethylene/ACC biosynthesis
  in shoots and thus promotes ethylene/ACC movement from shoots to roots. Ethylene
  activates the ERFs-NRT1.8 signaling module in both shoots and roots via EIN2- and
  EIN3-dependent manners and thus promotes nitrate reallocation from hypocotyls to
  leaves and roots.
