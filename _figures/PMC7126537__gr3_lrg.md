caption: Modulation of Mitochondrial Apoptosis Pathway upon Infection.B cell lymphoma
  2 (Bcl-2) family proteins, including include Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and
  Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak), regulate the mitochondrial cell death
  pathway. Bax and Bak are proapoptotic proteins that localize to mitochondria and
  induce outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MOMP), leading to the release
  of proapoptotic factors, such as cytochrome C, into the cytosol, which induce cell
  death by activating Caspases 9, 3, and 7 via the apoptosome complex. Bacteria and
  viruses influence this pathway and modulate the host response. Helicobacter, Shigella,
  and Mycobacterium infections lead to mitochondrial disruption that stimulates the
  mitochondrial apoptotic machinery and causes cell death. By contrast, bacteria such
  as Chlamydia and Legionella block the mitochondrial cell death pathway to promote
  their intracellular proliferation. Different viruses also exert varied effects on
  the mitochondrial cell death pathway. Influenza A enhances cell death, which helps
  in its dissemination, while Zika virus blocks cell death. Created with BioRender
