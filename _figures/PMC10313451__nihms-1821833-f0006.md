caption: Model showing imipramine mechanism of action in breast cancers. Red boxes
  and lines indicate proteins/mechanisms that act to promote cancer growth and progression,
  while green boxes or lines represent proteins or pathways that inhibit breast cancer
  growth and progression. Based on our results, we propose that imipramine blocks
  breast cancer growth and progression by inhibiting cell cycle, DNA Repair, and ER-α
  signaling. We show that imipramine treatment leads to an increase in CDK inhibitors
  including p15, p21, and p27, which inhibit the activity of CDK4/6 and CDK2 (marked
  by X), consequently preventing the hyperphosphorylation and loss of activity of
  the RB protein. This leads to reduced E2F activity, reduced transcription of S phase
  genes, and increased G1/S cell cycle arrest. In addition to cell cycle progression,
  we show that imipramine treatment inhibits DNA Damage Response and DNA Repair pathway
  (marked by X), by inhibiting key players in the DNA Damage Response/DNA Repair pathway,
  including ATR, BRCA1, RAD51, and DNA-PKcs. We posit that reduced DNA repair leads
  to persistent/increased level of DNA damage and consequently apoptosis in imipramine-treated
  breast cancer cells. We propose that imipramine may block the growth and progression
  of ER + breast cancers by inhibiting ER-α signaling. Since effectors of DNA repair
  (such as FOXM1, RAD51 and BRCA1) and ER-a signaling functionally and physically
  crosstalk, our results suggest that imipramine inhibition of both DNA repair and
  ER-a signaling amplifies its anti-tumor effects on ER + breast cancers.
