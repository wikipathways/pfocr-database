caption: 'PRR signaling pathways associated with autoinflammatory diseases. Represents
  three of the main categories: NLR signaling‐mediated inflammasomopathies, NF‐κB
  signaling‐mediated relopathies, and RIG‐I signaling‐mediated type I interferonopathies.
  When NLRs recognize their ligands, the inflammasome is formed, which is responsible
  for the maturation of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, including IL‐1β and IL‐18. Since
  then, both cytokines are released into the extracellular space and recognized by
  IL‐1 receptors of other cells, triggering the NF‐kB signaling pathway; The NF‐κB
  signaling can be activated by diverse stimuli. This activation elicits the production
  of inflammatory mediators; The recognition of double‐stranded DNA or RNA‐DNA hybrids
  by cGAS activates the production of cGAMP, which binds to STING and subsequently
  triggers IKK signaling. On the other hand, the binding of single‐stranded or double‐stranded
  RNA to RLRs (e.g., RIG‐I) promote its association with MAVS within the mitochondria,
  leading to IRF3 phosphorylation and the production of IFN‐I. The released IFN‐I
  can further bind to IFNAR, leading to the upregulation of ISGs. cGAMP, 2′‐3′‐cyclic
