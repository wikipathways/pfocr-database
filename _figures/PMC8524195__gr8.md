caption: Pathways responsible for the generation of short-chain acyl-CoA precursors.
  Pyruvate (Pyr) arising from glycolysis is converted to C2-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (Pdh) and is the precursor for even-numbered straight-chain fatty acids. There are
  other sources of C2-CoA including C2-CoA synthetase and phosphotransacetylase that
  are not shown. Extracellular branched-chain amino acids are transaminated by IlvE
  giving rise to the respective ketoacids. Alternately, the ketoacids are generated
  by the de novo branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway. These ketoacids are
  decarboxylated to their respective acyl-CoAs by branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase
  (Bkd) to form 2-methyl-butyryl-CoA (aC5-CoA) and isobutyryl-CoA (iC5-CoA). Valine
  is a poor substrate for the Bkd pathway, whereas Ile is the major amino acid metabolized.
  The ratio of short-chain acyl-CoA primers available to FabH is a major determinant
  of fatty acid composition. The anteiso branched-chain odd-carbon fatty acids arise
  from aC5-CoA, iso branched-chain odd-carbon fatty acids are from iC5-CoA, straight-chain
  even-carbon fatty acids come from C2-CoA, and the trace of iso branched-chain even-carbon
  fatty acids are derived from Val.
