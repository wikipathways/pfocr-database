caption: 'MiR-146a is a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway.MiR-146a
  targets TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1 (IRAK1), two upstream adaptor proteins on the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB)
  pathway thus inhibiting synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly,
  NF-κB induces miR-146a transcription to control the miR-146a levels in the cells.
  This feedback mechanism may contribute to maintaining a delicate equilibrium of
  pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory states in normal physiological conditions,
  which is often disrupted in pathological conditions and under cellular stresses
  such as following TBI. Thus, manipulation of miR-146a levels may have therapeutic
  benefits in intervening undesirable inflammatory responses related to cellular stressors.
