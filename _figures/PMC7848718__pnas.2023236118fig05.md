caption: Temporal map of changes in EC function-relevant pathways in HAECs (A) and
  HUVECs (B). Color-filled boxes represent pathways. Pathways and genes in red are
  up-regulated (up) by OS vs. PS, while those in blue are down-regulated (down) by
  OS vs. PS. Some pathways such as TGF-β signaling pathway and angiogenesis are shown
  in “mixed” color (gradient) due to mixed response (both up- and down-regulated).
  Such mixed response is generally observed across the time course. For the cell cycle
  pathway, CCND3 is down-regulated strongly in HAECs, but only moderately in HUVECs.
  CDK4 is moderately up-regulated only in HUVECs. Inflammation-related processes and
  oxidative stress response pathway show overall similar response in both cell types,
  although there are some temporal differences in specific genes. NFκB is slightly
  and moderately up-regulated in HAECs and HUVECs, respectively, and JUNB and NQO1
  are down-regulated in both cell types. SOD2, one of the key genes related to oxidative
  stress, is up-regulated significantly in HUVECs, but only slightly in HAECs, although
  the response persists across time. HIF1α is slightly up-regulated in both cell types.
  While the angiogenesis pathway and its genes show mixed responses in both cell types
  and the responses are broadly similar, the changes appear earlier in HAECs than
  HUVECs. Autophagy and lysosome pathways are overall down- and up-regulated, respectively,
  in both cell types, although there are minor differences in the differential expression
  of several genes. Angiogenesis exhibits mixed response in both cell types.
