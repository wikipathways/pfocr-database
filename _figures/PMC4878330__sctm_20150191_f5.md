caption: 'Proposed mechanisms by which hypoxic-conditioned media (HCM) promotes regeneration
  and reduces inflammation and apoptosis of liver cells. After partial hepatectomy,
  the STAT3 signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating the proliferation
  of hepatocytes. Activated STAT3 also induces the expression of SOCS3, which terminates
  the STAT3 signaling cascade and forms a negative-feedback loop. We propose that
  HCM infusion could induce persistent and uninhibited expression of STAT3 by decreasing
  the expression of SOCS3 in the liver. Abbreviations: ASCs, adipose-derived stem
  cells; IL-6, interleukin-6; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT3, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3.'
