caption: A model explaining the role of porphyrins in plant responses to drought.
  Both drought and porphyrins trigger the accumulation of ROS, which activates plant
  responses to drought stress, while suppressing porphyrin levels. ROS initiate signaling
  cascades that stimulate gene activation. The possible association of drought responses
  with the SA signaling pathway is shown with dotted arrows, and the negative influence
  on porphyrin and ROS accumulation is shown with T-bars. The drought-mediated suppression
  of porphyrin biosynthetic pathway transcripts and intermediates is proposed as a
  mechanism leading to reduced damage during dehydration. Unbound hemes are used to
  supplement the level of ROS scavengers inside and outside of the plastids.
