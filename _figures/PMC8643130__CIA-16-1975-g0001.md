caption: The metabolic pathway of TMAO and its adverse effects on the body. Created
  by ScienceSlides Software and Microsoft Office PowerPoint Software. High-cholinergic
  foods are metabolized by intestinal microbes to form TMA, most of which enter the
  portal system through the blood circulation and are transferred into TMAO by the
  FMOs in the liver. Elevated TMAO has adverse impacts on various diseases.
