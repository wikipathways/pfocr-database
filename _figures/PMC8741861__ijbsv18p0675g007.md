caption: FSH- induced β-arrestin-dependent pathway. Initially, the perception of β-arrestins'
  role was restricted to the control of desensitization of FSHR and its recycling.
  This view has progressively evolved towards a more general role of β-arrestins as
  adapters and transducers leading to the activation of MAPK, ERK and rpS6 independent
  of G proteins upon FSH stimulation. GRK2/3 and GRK 5/6 control the fate of the activated
  FSHR (i.e., desensitization or signaling) presumably through phosphorylation of
  distinct serine and threonines within the receptor's C-tail. Solid lines represent
  facilitatory outcomes whereas, the dotted ones pertain to the inhibitory results.
