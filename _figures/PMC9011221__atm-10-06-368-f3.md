caption: Role of SLC7A11 in ferroptosis. SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake and GSH production
  play a pivotal role in inhibiting lipid peroxidation and protecting cells from ferroptosis.
  SLC7A11 is inhibited by P53, BAP1, ATF3, and BECN1 and activated by NRF2 and ATF4.
  Also, SLC7A11 promotes the synthesis of GPX4 protein by activating the mTORC1-4EBP
  signaling pathway. In addition, NRF2 inhibits ferroptosis by regulating a variety
  of molecules, such as GCL, GSS, and GPX4. NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2; GCL, glutamate cysteine ligase; GSS, glutathione synthase; GSH, glutathione;
  GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; ATF3, activating transcription factor 3; ATF4, activating
  transcription factor 4; BAP1, tumor suppressor BRCA1-associated protein 1; BECN1,
  beclin 1; HSPA5, heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5.
