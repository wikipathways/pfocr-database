caption: The pathway for alginate synthesis from fructose 6-phosphate has been described
  and the enzymes required for synthesis of the sugar-nucleotide precursor have been
  characterized biochemically (–). Many questions remain about the final stages of
  synthesis and secretion, although structural studies of the proteins involved and
  extensive microbiological studies have provided a wealth of information (reviewed
  in ()). The chemical steps that occur in the latter stages of alginate biosynthesis
  are shown in . The first polymeric species in the pathway is mannuronan, a homopolymer
  of β-(1→4)-D-mannuronic acid, which is formed from GDP-mannuronic acid that is present
  in the cytoplasm. Mannuronan formation requires Alg8 and Alg44, which are associated
  with the inner membrane. The newly synthesized mannuronan is found in the periplasmic
  space where the final steps in synthesis occur. AlgG catalyzes epimerization of
  some residues to form α-L-guluronic acid and AlgF, J and I are required for acetylation
  of some mannuronic acid hydroxyl groups at C2 and C3. Somewhat paradoxically, functional
  alginate biosynthesis requires AlgL, which is a periplasmic alginate lyase. Deletion
  of algL is lethal, and microscopic examination of the cells reveals that alginate
  or a precursor accumulates in the periplasmic space until the cells burst ().
