caption: 'Metabolic pathways and enzymes involved in NADH production using NAD+ as
  their cofactor.Notes: The enzymes are glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in
  the glycolytic pathway, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzing the formation
  of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate, and the isocitrate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase,
  and malate dehydrogenase in the Krebs cycle. Additionally, fatty acid oxidation
  that yields one molecule of NADH per one molecule of acetyl-CoA produced is also
  shown.'
