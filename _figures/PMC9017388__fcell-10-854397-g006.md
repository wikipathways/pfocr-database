caption: The response in mTOR pathway and amino acid regualtion following SLC38A10
  knockout. Complete transcriptomic data and changed gene list subjected to IPA software
  analysis. (A) Regulation in the mTOR pathway in response to SLC38A10 knockout in
  Basal condition, blue symbols indicate down regulation and red symbols up regulation.
  (B) Heatmap describing changes in transcript levels from the mTOR pathway during
  Basal, Starved and Refed conditions. (C) Heatmap describing changes in transcript
  levels from the p70S6 pathway during Basal, Starved and Refed conditions. (D) Regulation
  in the mTOR pathway in response to SLC38A10 knockout in Starved condition, blue
  symbols indicate down regulation and red symbols up regulation. (E) Regulation in
  the mTOR pathway in response to SLC38A10 knockout in Refed condition, blue symbols
  indicate down regulation and red symbols up regulation. (F) Neurological diseases
  predicted by Path Designer, in response to SLC38A10 knockout.
