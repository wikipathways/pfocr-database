caption: Genomic and transcriptomic methods. NGS and classical PCR can be employed
  to study genomic and transcriptomic metabolic signatures. For instance, NGS projects
  led to the identification of mutations in the IDH 1 and 2 genes as recurrent aberrations
  in AML, followed by the development of targeted therapies. Classical quantitative
  PCR can be employed to quantify the mitochondrial DNA in cells, which has been linked
  to leukemia aggressiveness. Finally, NGS studies of the transcriptome by bulk or
  single‐cell RNA sequencing provide information on gene expression that can improve
  the understanding of the biological function of metabolic pathways and serve as
  a basis for correlation with clinical outcomes. AML, acute myeloid leukemia; IDH,
  isocitrate dehydrogenase; mt, mitochondrial; NGS, next‐generation sequencing; PCR,
  polymerase chain reaction
