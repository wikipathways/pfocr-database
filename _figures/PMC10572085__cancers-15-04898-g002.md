caption: 'Signaling pathways of the CD44 intracellular domain (CD44-ICD) under hypoxia.
  CD44 is cleaved in two steps. The first cleavage is promoted via proteolysis of
  the ectodomain by matrix metalloproteinases, among others, followed by a second
  cleavage of the transmembrane domain by presenilin-dependent γ-secretase, resulting
  in the release of CD44-ICD. The released CD44-ICD fragments translocate to the nucleus
  and activate various genes as a co-transcription factor for Runt-related transcription
  factor 2 (RUNX2). CD44-ICD also binds to cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)
  to regulate the gene expression of cyclin D1 and oxidative glycolysis-related genes
  3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase
  4 (PFKFB4). Under hypoxic conditions, CD44-ICD binds to hypoxia-inducible factor
  (HIF)-2α and activates its expression, resulting in enhanced activation of HIF-2α
  target genes, including Sox2, NANOG, and OCT4, the genes of which are required for
  maintaining the stemness of GSCs. *: activated gene.'
