caption: 'Involvement of optineurin in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. Upon
  Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling the NF-κB pathway is activated, leading to expression
  of inflammatory cytokines. This is mediated via interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinases (IRAKs) and TRAF. NEMO binds to the I kappa B (IKB) complex, leading to
  its phosphorylation and consequent degradation, and translocation of p50/p65 to
  the nucleus. NEMO also interacts with receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and trans-activating
  transcriptional regulatory protein of HTLV-1 (TAX1). Overexpression of wild-type
  or ALS mutant optineurin blocks NF-κB activation. Depletion of optineurin or overexpression
  of the glaucoma mutants leads to failure to inhibit NF-κB, leading to activation
  of this pathway. Optineurin binds to TAX1, blocking its interaction with NEMO and
  further inhibiting the pathway. Interferon regulatory factors are activated during
  TLR activation. IRF3 and IRF7 activation is mediated by TBK-1, and TBK-1 undergoes
  phosphorylation and ubiquitination during its activation. Optineurin binds to TBK-1,
  targeting it to CYLD, which inhibits its enzymatic activity. Abbreviations: OPTN−:
  optineurin depletion, OPTN+: optineurin overexpression, OPTN ALS: ALS mutant optineurin,
  OPTN Glaucoma: glaucoma mutant optineurin.'
