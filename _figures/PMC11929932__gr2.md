  Signaling Pathways(a) MAPKi resistance coincides with a decline in activated DCs,
  including cDC1 and cDC2 subsets, and a concomitant increase in Tregs and Ccr2+ monocytes.
  This impaired DC maturation is driven by reactivated MAPK signaling within tumor
  cells, rather than selective pressure from the immune response. Additionally, factors
  released by resistant cells promote the accumulation of immunosuppressive CD163+
  M2 macrophages. (b) Resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors is associated with IRPS gene
  set, relating to aberrant IFN signaling and Treg presence. Mutations in genes involved
  in immunosuppression were observed. Other immunomodulatory effects include PD-L1
  elevation and SASP-induced MDSC recruitment.(CDK4/6: Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/6;
