caption: Implications of TLR4 in inflammation in pancreatic islets. TLR4 on the surface
  of β-cells and macrophages is activated by FFA and high glucose, which induces oxidative
  stress and ROS generation by upregulating expression of caspase-3 and PARP. The
  cytokine IL-1β is released via the TLR4-NF-κB signaling pathway in pancreatic β-cells
  and macrophages. Eventually, the generation of IL-1β and ROS induces the pancreatic
  β-cell dysfunction (decreased production and secretion of insulin) and the apoptosis/cell
  death of β-cells. Moreover, M2 macrophages from bone marrow or adipose tissue enter
  pancreatic-islet tissue and translate into M1 macrophages. Activated M1 macrophages
  increase the level of ROS and IL-1β to aggravate inflammation and further deteriorate
  dysfunction of β-cell in pancreatic islets.62
