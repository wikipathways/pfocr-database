  CpxR~P down-regulates genes encoding components of the Ysc-Yop system by binding
  directly to their promoters. It also inhibits expression of the gene encoding the
  master positive regulator of the ysc-yop genes, lcrF, by the same mechanism. CpxR~P
  also represses expression of the genes encoding invasin (inv) and its positive regulator
  RovA. This further inhibits the function of the Ysc-Yop system by compromising the
  attachment to host cells that is required for efficient Yop delivery. It is not
  yet known what drives the phosphorylation of CpxR in this situation. Some evidence
  supports a role for elevated acetyl phosphate generated by the phosphotransacetylase
  (Pta)—acetate kinase (AtkA) pathway under as yet unknown metabolic conditions. It
  is also possible that envelope stress caused by assembly of the Ysc-Yop T3SS is
  sensed by CpxA, which then phosphorylates CpxR. RpoE has been implicated in positively
  regulating the Ysc-Yop T3SS although the mechanism remains unexplored. OM, outer
  membrane; IM, inner (cytoplasmic) membrane.
