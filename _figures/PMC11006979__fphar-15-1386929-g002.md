caption: CDK8 regulates transcription by phosphorylating transcription factors directly.
  (A) Phosphorylation of R-Smads and Smad4 assembly occur in the cytoplasm, followed
  by their transfer to the nucleus. Then, CDK8 is further phosphorylated, which can
  activate transcription factor interactions to promote the phosphorylation of R-Smads
  that can be ubiquitinated and degraded. (B) NICD enter into the nucleus and stimulates
  CDK8 to control the function of NICD by phosphorylating NICD, followed by ubiquitination
  and degradation, thus terminating the NOTCH signaling pathway. (C) Tyr701-phosphorylated
  STAT1 forms a dimer, which is conveyed to nucleus for subsequent phosphorylation
  of STAT1a by CDK8/CCNC to promote transcription. (D) CDK8/CCNC induces increased
  ubiquitination and protein degradation of SREBP through phosphorylation of SREBP.
