caption: 'Mechanism of encoding the NSC modules. Two steps are sufficient for the
  description: the high ΔG pair would be stable enough to propitiate the transferase
  reaction and to accommodate the binding of the peptide product to itself; the five
  other pairs these triplets would also be involved with, of lower ΔG, become scarce,
  so that the two pairs left free to form are now in high concentration, which should
  facilitate the second round of encoding. Note that some of the present attributions
  in the homogeneous sector do not coincide with the constraints imposed by the metabolic
  pathway adopted in our scheme (see below) and require the proposition of concessions
  from an earlier occupier of the triplet (proposed by the metabolic scheme) to the
  present occupier. Three of these are related to the late entrance of the Glu family
  of amino acids (in red font), which does not belong to the proposed first metabolic
  pathway—the Glycine-Serine Cycle: in module 1 pair a, GGG-Gly conceded to Pro and
  in pair b YCU-Ser conceded to Arg; in module 2 pair a, CUC-Asp conceded to Glu.
  The other is Phe, whose biosynthesis requires a sugar (green) component. There are
  two pathways for the biosynthesis of Lys, involving either Asp or Glu derivations.
  After this stage of encodings, there are no more metabolic constraints.'
