caption: The potential mechanisms of acacetin in preventing DCM and drug-induced cardiotoxicity.
  Acacetin can promote glucose uptake and reduce oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation
  by activating the Ca2+-CaMKII-AMPK and PKCλ/ζ pathways, while increasing ROS production,
  thus exhibiting anti-diabetic properties. Besides, acacetin exerts antioxidant,
  anti-apoptotic, and anti-apoptotic effects by activating the PPAR-α/AMPK signaling
  pathway, thereby showing its therapeutic potential against DCM. In addition, acacetin
  can significantly alleviate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting
  oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis via the activation of Sirt1/AMPK/Nrf2
  signaling
