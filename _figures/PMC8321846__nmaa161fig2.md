caption: Multiple amino acids regulate insulin sensitivity in the skeletal muscle.
  (A) Leucine promotes protein synthesis and inhibits protein degradation through
  the activation of mTORC1, which, in turn, negatively regulates insulin sensitivity.
  However, a beneficial effect of leucine on insulin sensitivity is also observed.
  (B) Isoleucine enhances glucose utilization and lipid accumulation in the skeletal
  muscle through the inhibition of AMPK. (C) Arginine could stimulate glucose disposal
  and fatty acid oxidation in an NO-dependent manner and promote protein synthesis
  through the mTORC1-S6K1 pathway. (D) Methionine restriction is a feasible approach
  for improving insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle through regulation of the AMPK-mTORC1-S6K1-IRS1
  pathway and the coordinated increase in circulating concentrations of adiponectin,
  thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3). ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AKT, serine/threonine
