caption: 'Schematic diagram showing the central role of the BMP6-HJV-SMAD signaling
  pathway in hepcidin regulation and the proposed interaction with other hepcidin
  regulators. BMP6 binds to the BMP type I and type II receptors (BMPR) and the co-receptor
  HJV to increase phosphorylation of SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8 proteins (SMAD1/5/8),
  which translocate to the nucleus to increase hepcidin transcription. Numerous other
  hepcidin regulators have been identified, many of which are proposed to intersect
  with the central BMP6/HJV/SMAD pathway at various levels as shown. Proposed iron-mediated
  hepcidin regulators are shown in yellow, inflammatory mediators in blue, iron deficiency
  mediators in purple, and anemia mediators in red. Abbreviations: TFR2, transferrin
  receptor 2; IL6, interleukin 6, sHJV, soluble hemojuvelin, TWSG1, twisted gastrulation
  1, GDF15, growth and differentiation factor 15, TMPRSS6, transmembrane serine proteinase
  6, EGF, epidermal growth factor, HGF, hepatocyte growth factor, mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin.'
