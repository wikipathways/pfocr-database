caption: Strategies used for identification of plant metabolic clusters. (a) Biochemical
  characterization of one or more pathway steps in the pregenome era. The existence
  of clustering may then become apparent once genome sequence data for the species
  of interest is available. (b) Investigation of induced or natural variation in a
  trait provides genetic evidence for a multigene locus. The relevant region is then
  further defined by mapping. The underlying cluster is identified by assembly and
  sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contigs spanning the region
  (in the absence of genome sequence information) or by exploiting available genome
  sequence data in the region of the locus. (c) Discovery of metabolic clusters for
  new pathways by genome mining. Physical clustering of genes implicated in a specialized
  metabolic pathway in combination with transcriptomics data enables the delineation
  of new candidate metabolic gene clusters.
