caption: 'a: infection of virus can stimulate airway epithelium and produce antimicrobiota
  defense through IL-22/IL-22R signaling pathway. b: the colonization of bacterial
  pathogens could cause the release of IL-8/IL-6/TNF-α/IFN-γ. c1: cigarette smoking
  (CS) could induce the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs
  can activate the innate immune system by binding to pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs), such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9, and further induce CXCL8 release via TLR9
  activation. c2: CS increase the expression of both p50 and p65 subunits of NF-kappaB
  in neutrophils and reduce the spontaneous apoptosis of neutrophils. c3: CS could
  cause the degranulation of secondary granules. This contributes to the accumulation
  of neutrophils and inflammation within the airways of smokers. c4: the efferocytosis
  damage caused by CS can increase the release of proteases and elastases. It not
  only impairs the antimicrobial defense but also (d) promotes the pulmonary inflammation
  and tissue degradation.'
