caption: A schematic representation of the putative saxitoxin metabolic pathway in
  Alexandrium catenella. The transcriptional levels of the core genes sxtA4 and sxtG
  regulate STX biosynthesis and are altered by water temperature. Cold stress upregulated
  both sxtA4 and sxtG, leading to higher STX production, whereas heat stress downregulated
  sxtA4 to lower the toxicity. Various analogues were analyzed.
