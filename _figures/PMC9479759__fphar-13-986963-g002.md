caption: WKYMVm and cancer. Acting on FPRs, WKYMVm reduces the number of MDSCs, upregulates
  IL-2 and IFN-γ, and promotes NK cell migration and infiltration by activating ERK,
  thereby inhibiting the growth of melanoma cells. WKYMVm promotes mitosis and proliferation
  of breast cancer epithelial cells. WKYMVm increases c-Src expression, ROS production,
  and EGFR phosphorylation, triggers the STAT3 pathway, and promotes lung cancer cell
  proliferation. Combining with 5-FU and mature DCs, WKYMVm recruits CD8+ T lymphocytes
  and NK cells into tumors to induce the production of IFN-γ and IL-12, increases
  the expression levels of FAS and caspase-3, thereby inducing apoptosis and inhibiting
  metastasis of colon cancer cells. ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IL-2,
  interleukin-2; IFN-γ, interferon gamma; MDSCs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells;
