caption: The HER2/EGFR receptor is indicated in a blue figure. The downstream PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1
  pathway is regulated by Ras (indicated in green ovals), PTEN indicated in a black
  octagon, activated Src is indicated by a red oval, IRS1 is indicated by an orange
  oval. Sites where various small molecule inhibitors suppress this pathway are indicated
  by red octagons. Sites which stimulate proteins involved in autophagy are indicated
  by green octagons and ovals. The Serine/threonine-protein kinase ULK1 (ULK1) which
  is regulated by mTORC1 is indicated in a black oval. The downstream transcription
  factors regulated by this pathway are indicated in yellow diamond shaped outlines.
  The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway also interacts with key proteins involved in protein
  translation (indicated in green ovals). The two pathways aid in the assembly of
  the protein translation complex (indicated in purple ovals) responsible for the
  translation of “weak” mRNAs (indicated in a red line folding over on itself) important
  in the prevention of apoptosis. Other key proteins inactivated by PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1
  pathway (e.g., TSC, PTEN, GSK-3beta, beta-catenin, Foxo and 4E-BP1 are indicated
  by black ovals, diamonds and rectangles. Red arrows indicate activating events in
  pathways. Blocked black arrows indicating inactivating events in pathways.
