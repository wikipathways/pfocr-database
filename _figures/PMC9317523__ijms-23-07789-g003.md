caption: The molecular mechanisms of miRNAs for regulating autophagy in AD upon exercise,
  drug, natural product and traditional Chinese herb interventions. (A) Appropriate
  exercise can improve mitochondrial dynamics by inhibiting miR-34a and activate autophagy
  by inhibiting miR-34a and miR-130. (B) Sodium valproate can reduce the expression
  of LC3-II by up-regulating the expression of miR-34c-5p and reducing the stability
  of ATG4B mRNA. (C) Tiaoxinfang, Ampelopsin and urolithin A can delay brain aging
  through the activation of autophagy by inhibiting miR-34a/SIRT1/mTOR signaling pathway.
  The → and ┤ in black color represent the promotion and inhibition, respectively.
