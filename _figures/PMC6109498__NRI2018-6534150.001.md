caption: 'Signaling Pathway in ALS and Mechanism of Action of Current Therapies. The
  signaling pathway demonstrates that the neuronal cell death that occurs in ALS is
  triggered by several mechanisms and different therapy may target different mechanisms.
  Glutamate toxicity is targeted by Riluzole. Oxidative stress is targeted by Edaravone
  and mircoglia induced inflammation is targeted by masitinib. Stem cell therapy may
  target many of the above mechanisms. ROS: reactive oxygen species. EAAT2: excitatory
  amino acid transporter 2. NMDA: N‑methyl‑d-aspartate. SOD1: superoxide dismutase
