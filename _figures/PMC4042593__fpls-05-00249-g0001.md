caption: Schematic overview of some events occurring in apoplast during plant pathogen
  interactions. This illustration, based on studies described in this paper, presents
  some examples of apoplastic proteins regulated during biotic stresses. These proteins
  are secreted by the plant cell (green square) and/or pathogen (brown square). Some
  proteins, modulated in the apoplast after DAMP or MAMP perception, are involved
  in pathogen perception and signal transduction, leading to the activation of intracellular
  plant defense signaling pathways (blue arrows). The regulation of a large amount
  of proteins involved in redox homeostasis modulates the ROS signaling pathway leading
  to activation of extra- and intracellular plant defense responses (blue arrows).
  These proteins, such as peroxidases or oxalate oxidases participate also to the
  plant cell defense through plant cell wall reinforcement or direct pathogen attack
  (gray arrow). Plant cell wall is actively remodeled and/or reinforced through the
  regulation of numerous enzymes, such as polyglacturonases or glucanases, which are
  secreted by the pathogen or its host. Some of the cell wall degradation products
  can act as DAMP (green arrow) to stimulate plant defense signaling pathways. Most
  of the defense-related proteins, such as chitinases or glucanases, act directly
  against the pathogen (gray arrow), releasing degradation products that can be perceived
  as MAMP by the plant cell (brown arrow).
