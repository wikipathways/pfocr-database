caption: USP1 Domain structure and summary of the cellular functions of the USP1/UAF1
  complex. A. Shematic representation of USP1 protein showing the position of its
  amino-terminal Cys box and carboxy-terminal His box domains. The catalytic residues
  Cys90, His593 and Asp751 are indicated by arrowheads. B. Models illustrating the
  role of the USP1/UAF1 complex as regulator of three different cellular processes.
  In the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway (upper panel), the FA core complex monoubiquitinates
  FANCD2 and FANCI, which mediate the recruitment of other proteins that repair DNA
  interstrand crosslink (ICL) lesions. USP1/UAF1 antagonizes the FA core complex deubiquitinating
  FANCD2 and FANCI. In the process of translesion synthesis (TLS) (middle panel),
  monoubiquitinated PCNA recruits specific TLS DNA polymerases that may bypass DNA
  lesions, but have lower fidelity than replicative polymerases. USP1/UAF1 may prevent
  unscheduled recruitment of low fidelity TLS polymerases by deubiquitinating PCNA.
  Finally (lower panel), USP1/UAF1 contributes to the maintaince of the undifferentiated
  state of osteosarcoma cells by promoting deubiquitination and stability of ID proteins,
  which, in turn, negatively regulate differentiation-inducing bHLH transcription
  factors.
