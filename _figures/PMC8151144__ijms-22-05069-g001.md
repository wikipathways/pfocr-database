caption: The ABA biosynthesis pathway from zeaxanthin. Synthesis of violaxanthin is
  catalyzed by zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP). A reverse reaction catalyzed by violaxanthin
  de-epoxidase (VDE) contributes to energy dissipation in chloroplasts under high
  light. The formation of cis-isomers of violaxanthin and neoxanthin remains elusive.
  Two proteins, ABA-DEFICIENT4 and NEOXANTHIN-DEFICIENT1, are necessary for neoxanthin
  synthase (NSY) activity. Recent evidence suggests that ABA4 is also involved in
  ABA synthesis from 9-cis-violaxanthin. Cleavage of cis-xanthophylls is catalysed
  by a family of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCED). Xanthoxin is then converted
  by a xanthoxin dehydrogenase (XD) into abscisic aldehyde, which is oxidized into
  ABA by an abscisic aldehyde oxidase (ABAO). ABAO contains a molydenum cofactor activated
  by a MoCo sulfurase (MOCOS). Arabidopsis mutants are indicated for each enzymatic
  step.
