caption: 'Working model of PhoN-dependent PLP/PNP salvage pathway in S. enterica.
  (A) Expression of phoN requires that the PhoQ sensor kinase phosphorylates the PhoP
  response regulator. (B and C) The PhoN peptide is translocated to the periplasm
  via the Sec-dependent system (B), where it is processed to the mature form (C).
  (D and E) PLP enters the periplasm, possibly through a generic porin(s) (D), and
  PhoN dephosphorylates PLP to PL (E). (F and G) Via an unidentified mechanism, PL
  is transported into the cytoplasm (F), where PdxK/PdxY phosphorylates PL back to
  PLP (G). PNP salvage mirrors that of PLP but requires an additional step in which
  PNP is oxidized to PLP by PdxH (Fig. 1). Abbreviations: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate;
  PNP, pyridoxine 5′-phosphate; PL, pyridoxal. Image was created with BioRender (Toronto,
  ON, Canada).'
