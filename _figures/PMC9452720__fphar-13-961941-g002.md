caption: ZA can inhibit the mevalonate pathway. Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS),
  as a key regulatory enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, can promote the formation
  of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS)
  and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and GGPP can promote the prenylation of Rab GTPases,
  this pathway is closely related to the apoptosis of osteoclasts. ZA promotes osteoclast
  apoptosis by inhibiting the activity of FPPS. In addition, ZA can promote osteoclast
  apoptosis through reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent findings suggest that ZA
  may promote ferroptosis in osteoclasts through p53.
