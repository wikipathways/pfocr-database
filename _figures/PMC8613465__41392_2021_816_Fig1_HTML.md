caption: Cross-talks of signaling pathway in innate immune cells. At initiation of
  sepsis, innate immune cells are generally activated at recognition of DAMPs and
  PAMPs. Membrane-bound and intracellular receptors sense danger signals, which converge
  with multiple pathways related to activation and regulation of innate immune responses.
  In general, these converge toward IRF3 and NF-κB signaling pathway that are required
  to initiate early phase inflammatory responses. Besides, TLR4 agonist (i.e., LPS
  or HMGB1) provide essential priming signal for the first step of inflammasome activation—upregulation
  of pro-inflammatory genes. Another substantial group of pathogenic products and
  endogenous alarmins were required to provide signal 2 for AIM2/NLRP3 inflammasome
  assembly, which subsequently cleave caspase, GSDMD, and pro-IL-1β/18 to drive canonical
  inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. Acting as late-phase alarmin, HMGB1 interact
  with RAGE for delivery of cytosolic LPS, which further trigger pyroptosis via caspase-11-dependent
  pathway (equivalent to caspase-4 and caspase-5 in human, non-canonical pathway).
  Intracellularly, cytosolic DNA derived from apoptotic cells or intracellular pathogen
  could be sensed by AIM2 and cGAS-STING to induce inflammasome assembly and IRF3
  phosphorylation, leading to type I interferon responses and inflammasome activation.
  During sepsis, persisted stress stimuli result in mitochondria dysfunction, ROS
  production, and metabolism reprogramming that further enhance redox state modification
  and alarmin production (HMGB1). These cellular changes activate multiple signaling
  pathways that converge with NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Inflammasome plays a
  pivotal role in sepsis pathogenesis due to its cross-talk with stress signaling,
  immune cell activation, and cell homeostasis. Interaction between inflammatory and
  coagulation cascades serve as underlined mechanism for DIC pathogenesis. As a cytosolic
  LPS receptor, caspase-11 participated in initiation of coagulation by enhancing
  tissue factor (TF) activity, performed by GSDMD pore-mediated Ca2+ efflux that trigger
  PS externalization, while macrophage pyroptosis facilitate release of cellular contents
  including procoagulant products (TF) and alarmins to sustain systemic coagulation.
