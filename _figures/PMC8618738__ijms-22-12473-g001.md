caption: 'Schematic representation of the Notch signalling function. Notch pathway
  modulation strongly depends on the Notch receptor—DLL/JAG ligand interaction established
  between neighbouring cells. (a) Lateral induction triggers the expression of the
  Jag or Dll in the receiving cell. (b) Lateral inhibition reduces the expression
  of Dll or Jag in the neighbouring cell. (c) Cis-inhibition occurs when receptor
  and ligand expressed by the same cell, activates the pathway and sequesters active
  molecules on a single cell surface. Abbreviations: DLL, Delta-like; JAG, Jagged.'
