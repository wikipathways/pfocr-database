caption: Schematic diagram displays the function of FLJ in CRPC. Elevated androgen
  receptor (AR) levels in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stimulate the
  expression of a novel long non-coding RNA FLJ. FLJ inhibits AR translocation to
  the nucleus, disrupting the conventional androgen-dependent survival pathway. Concurrently,
  FLJ stabilizes AR protein in the cytoplasm by preventing its degradation. Additionally,
  FLJ induces autophagy through AR-mediated low-dose androgen stimulation, promoting
  CRPC cell proliferation and re-sensitizing these cells to castration-mimetic conditions
  and anti-androgen therapies in vitro
