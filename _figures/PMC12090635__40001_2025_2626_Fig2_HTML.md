caption: EMT and Notch signaling pathway. EMT refers to the transformation of epithelial
  cells into elongated cells with a mesenchymal phenotype. EMT is involved in pathogenic
  processes, such as metastasis and carcinogenesis, and is today considered one of
  the most important mechanisms driving cancer metastasis. The Notch pathway has been
  shown to significantly influence EMT regulation. MCUR1, Mitochondrial calcium uniporter
  regulator 1; SMAD7, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7; ACTL6, actin-like
  6A; SOX2, sex-determining region Y-box2; NCSTN, a fundamental component of the γ-secretase
  complex; KIAA1217, a macromolecular protein
