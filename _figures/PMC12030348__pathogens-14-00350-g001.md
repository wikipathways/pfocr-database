caption: Two-component regulatory system pathway in fungi. (A) The classic two-component
  system based on C. albicans, where HPK refers to membrane-bound histidine protein
  kinase, H is the histidine residue (H box), and RR corresponds to response regulators.
  (B) This is a variation of the two-component system phosphorelay present in some
  fungi (H. capsulatum, B. dermatiditis, among others), where HHK refers to hybrid
  histidine kinase transmembrane receptor, HH and D are the catalytic domains of HHK,
  HPT is a histidine phosphotransferase, and RR is also a response regulator. Details
  of the operation of this pathway can be found in the main text. Figure created with
