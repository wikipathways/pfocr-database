caption: Regulation of RhoA. RhoA functions as a molecular switch, cycling between
  an active GTP-bound conformation and an inactive GDP-bound conformation. Intrinsic
  phosphatase activity hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, deactivating RhoA function, and this
  process is accelerated by interaction with GAPs. Conversely, interaction with GEFs
  facilitates the exchange of GDP to GTP, which restores the activation of RhoA. RhoA
  is also regulated by GDIs, which can inhibit the exchange of GDP to GTP. Pro-angiogenic
  factors may activate RhoA by GEFs. GTP, guanosine triphosphate; GDP, guanosine diphosphate;
  GAPs, GTPase-activating proteins; GEFs, guanine-nucleotide exchange factors; GDIs,
  guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
