caption: 'Mitophagy pathway. In response to damaged stimuli or through mitophagy enhancer
  supplementation, cells activate mitophagy. This process can be divided into two
  different subprocesses depending on the participation of PINK1 and Parkin proteins.
  In the PINK1/Parkin-dependent cascade, PINK1 at the OMM is activated and phosphorylates
  Parkin. However, this phosphorylation is not sufficient to recruit Parkin to the
  OMM. On the contrary, PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin, which binds to Parkin, facilitating
  its recruitment to the mitochondria. Then, Parkin ubiquitinates several proteins
  on the mitochondrial surface, which are recognized by different receptors such as
  OPTN, p62, NDP52, TAX1BP1, or NRB1 that, in turn, interact with LC3 present in the
  autophagosome membrane and stimulate the formation of autophagosome. These autophagosome
  fuse with lysosomes, leading to the formation of autolysosomes, where mitochondrial
  degradation occurs. On the other hand, in PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagy, damaged
  mitochondria are recognized by other receptors such as AMBRA1, Nix/BNIP3, or FUNDC1
  that, as in the previous case, interact with LC3 to form the autophagosome, which
  again fuses with a lysosome to form the autolysosome, where complete degradation
  of the mitochondrion take place. Arrow: activation or induction of the subsequent
  process'
