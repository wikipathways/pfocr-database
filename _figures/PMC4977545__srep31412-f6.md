caption: Forward genetic approach begins with strain-specific quantitative trait.
  Linkage analysis identifies quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are responsible for
  the trait. Generation of congenic mouse strains in which the QTL are exchanged between
  parental strain will facilitate the confirmation of QTL and their functional effect.
  Gene expression profiles will identify the underlying quantitative train genes (QTGs).
  The regulatory role of QTGs in quantitative trait needs to be further confirmed
  by gain or loss of gene function. By following this pathway, our study identified
  Chr5 and underlying Slit2 as QTG that accounts for the natural variation in HSC
  number between C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA2 (D2) mouse strains. Slit2 expression level
  positively correlates with HSC number. Slit2 level is lower in B6 mice that have
  less HSC number whereas its level is higher in D2 mice that have more HSCs. Ectopic
  expression of Slit2 leads to the increased HSC number and function in B6 mice, further
  confirming Slit2 as a positive regulator of HSCs.

  description: Forward genetic approach begins with strain-specific quantitative trait.
    Linkage analysis identifies quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are responsible
