caption: 'Schematic illustration of human disk intracellular PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway. The mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase that integrates nutrient signals
  to promote drive cell growth and division. It operates within the following two
  primary complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2, which include RAPTOR and RICTOR, respectively.
  The downstream effectors of mTORC1, such as p70/S6K, are involved in controlling
  cell proliferation, mRNA translation, and protein synthesis, also associated with
  senescence and matrix catabolism. Autophagy is tightly suppressed by mTORC1 as well.
  The regulation of mTORC1 is mediated by the upstream class-I PI3K, with Akt serving
  as a crucial pro-survival mediator that prevents apoptosis. Furthermore, the negative
  feedback loop between p70/S6K and the class-I PI3K exists. To analyze the cascade-dependent
  functions of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, gene suppression was performed using both
  siRNA-mediated RNAi-based and CRISPR–Cas9-based methods to target mTOR for both
  mTORC1 and mTORC2, RAPTOR for mTORC1, and RICTOR for mTORC2'
