caption: Relationships between select heritable cancers and the hypoxia pathway. Inactivation
  of von Hippel–Lindau protein (pVHL), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), or fumarate
  hydratase (FH) leads to increased expression of genes in the hypoxia pathway. (A)
  Tricarboxylic acid cycle and its relationship to regulation of hypoxia-inducible
  factor. (B) Inactivation of pVHL in von Hippel–Lindau disease causes upregulation
  of genes expressed in the hypoxia pathway through decreased degradation of HIF1-α.
  (C) Inactivation of SDH in the SDHx hereditary paraganglioma–pheochromocytoma syndromes
  causes increase in succinate, which inhibits prolyl hydroxylases that would assist
  in the degradation of HIF. (D) Inactivation of FH in HLRCC causes increase in fumarate,
  which inhibits prolyl hydroxylases that would assist in the degradation of HIF.
