caption: Proposed novel signaling pathway by which PDE4 regulates BK channel activity
  in DSM cells. This diagram illustrates that the pharmacological inhibition of PDE4
  leads to activation of PKA (A), increase in Ca2+ spark and TBKC activities (B),
  and hyperpolarization of DSM cell membrane and a consequent decrease in global Ca2+
  levels (C). AC, adenylyl cyclase; BK, large conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated
  K+ channel; CaV, L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel; pPLB, phosphorylated phospholamban;
  RyR, ryanodine receptor; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; TBKC, transient BK current.
