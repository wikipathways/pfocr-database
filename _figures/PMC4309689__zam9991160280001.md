caption: Engineered functional reversal of the β-oxidation cycle. Core enzymes consist
  of thiolases (AtoB, FadA), hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (FadB), enoyl-CoA hydratase
  (FadB), and enoyl-CoA reductase (FabI, FadE). The enoyl-CoA reductase step is highlighted
  in gray. Thioesterases are shown as an example of termination enzymes that can act
  on CoA thioester intermediates of the core pathway to generate carboxylic acids
  as the products. Free energies were calculated as previously described () and assuming
  different redox partners for the enoyl-CoA reductase reaction. ΔrG values were calculated
  assuming standard conditions (298.15 K, pH 7) with minimum and maximum values (in
  parentheses) calculated using minimum and maximum metabolite concentrations set
  to 0.00001 M and 0.02 M, respectively.
