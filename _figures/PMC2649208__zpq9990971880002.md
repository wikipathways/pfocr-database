caption: A molecular interaction map displaying the functional interaction of genes
  in the MEK/ERK output profile with established roles in ERK signaling. A molecular
  interaction map was constructed for major constituents of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling
  pathway and downstream effectors. The genes in the output profile that have established
  functional relationships to ERK signaling are indicated by gray shading, with the
  nature of their relationship (i.e., direct phosphorylation, transcriptional activation)
  indicated by using the symbols described by Pommier and colleagues () and shown
  in the legend.
papertitle: V600EBRAF is associated with disabled feedback inhibition of RAFâ€“MEK signaling
  and elevated transcriptional output of the pathway.
