caption: 'Intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. As decisional checkpoint of entry in apoptosis,
  Bcl-2 homologs perform functions—among many—in the integrity of the mitochondrion
  and thus regulating the formation of the apoptosome. Anti-apoptotic suppressor homologs
  inhibit their pro-apoptotic effector counterparts, preventing their translocation
  to the mitochondrion in order to create pores (and thus releasing cytochrome c and
  IAP inhibitors such as Smac/Diablo). Additional pro-apoptotic sensitizer and activator
  homologs act to inhibit the suppressors, although activators can furthermore interact
  with effectors to activate or enhance the functions of the latter. When the balance
  of Bcl-2 homologs is in favor of pro-apoptotics, effectors are free at the mitochondrion
  to homo-oligomerize, or hetero-oligomerize, with fellow effectors, and/or with activators,
  thus affecting the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane. APAF-1 and released
  cytochrome c can cooperate to dimerize pro-CASP-9, thus forming the apoptosome,
  resulting in massive CASP-9 activation and subsequent amplifying activation cascade
  of executioner caspases. Note that only the general outlines are shown here, for
  the sake of clarity. PARP, poly(ADP Ribose) polymerase; scissors: caspase-mediated
  cleavage.'
