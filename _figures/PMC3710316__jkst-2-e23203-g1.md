caption: Figure 1. The combined action of EGFR and JAK-STAT signaling results in tumor
  progression. (A) Epithelial growth in tissues with normal apico-basal cell polarity
  is controlled by the balanced activity of EGFR, JAK-STAT and other signaling pathways.
  Negative regulators such as Socs36E control pathway activity by modulating signaling
  output. (B) When EGFR is over activated (shown in bold), the epithelium proliferates
  excessively without necessarily causing metastasis. (C) Over proliferation and metastasis
  are promoted by the combined misregulation of EGFR and high JAK-STAT expression
  when the signaling balance is broken by the downregulation of Socs36E by bantam
  miRNA expression or by JNK mediated JAK-STAT activation.
