caption: 'The molecular pathways involved in animal glaucoma models at the level of
  retinal ganglion cell. TGF-β signaling: The canonical TGF-β signaling pathway begins
  with its binding to the type II receptor (TGF-βRII), which leads to phosphorylation
  and activation of the type I receptor (TGF-βRI). This process activates intracellular
  SMADs proteins (Smad2, Smad3, Smad4). The Smad complex moves to the cell nucleus,
  where it activates gene transcription, leading to the production of extracellular
  matrix. In trabecular meshwork cells, studies have shown that another important
  regulator, involved in TGF-β2-induced IOP increase, is Src kinase; the use of a
  potent Src inhibitor, Desatinib, resulted in alleviation of TGF-β2-induced IOP increase
  in rat eyes. Neurotrophins: The neurotrophic pathways provide support and protection
  to RGCs, and the loss of this support can contribute to the death of RGCs in glaucoma.
  The action of neurotrophins is mainly manifested through activation of two types
  of transmembrane glycoproteins, tropomyosin receptor kinases (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC)
  and the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. Trk activation triggers intricate
  signaling cascades, activating the Ras/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)
  pathway and stimulating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPs). Simultaneously,
  the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway engages, and phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1 is activated (Mallone
  et al., 2020). The activation of p75NTR arises from the binding of immature precursor
  forms of neurotrophins (proNT), eliciting a dual effect on cell fate—either apoptosis
  or survival. This outcome is contingent upon the simultaneous expression of Trk
  receptors. Consequently, maintaining cellular homeostasis hinges on achieving equilibrium
  in the availability of proNTs and their mature counterparts, alongside the presence
  of both Trk and p75NTR receptors. Neuroinflammation: Microglia and astroglia are
  the cells involved in inflammatory mechanisms in the retina. Their function is to
  regulate ion concentration, metabolic support of neurons and neuroprotective activity.
  Microglia cells, once mature, can be activated by damage-associated molecular pathways
  (DAMPs), which are released by neuronal cells. In addition, increased IOP stimulates
  RGCs to produce and secrete heat shock proteins (HSPs). These factors stimulate
  microglial cells to secrete cytokines and chemokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha
  (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and complement factors, which promote the morphological
  transformation of microglia into M1 (proinflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory)
  macrophages. Inflammatory pathways are involved in the regulation of various genes
  that are upregulated in the retina. One of the regulatory factors is nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB)—it leads to upregulation of IL-1 cytokine family, IL-6 and TNF-α. TNF-α
  and another proapoptotic protein, FasL, have been implicated in the pathogenesis
  of glaucoma. Fas/FasL signaling: Fas ligand (FasL) is a protein that belongs to
  the TNF family. When bound to the Fas receptor, it causes induction of apoptotic
  and pro-inflammatory pathways. This pathway has been identified as involved in axonal
  degeneration, death of RGCs and induction of neuroinflammation in a chronic and
  induced mouse model of glaucoma. Another study used the small peptide molecule ONL1204,
  an antagonist of the Fas receptor, which was administered to mice by injection into
  the vitreous body. NADPH oxidase: Several recent studies have pointed to a significant
  role for NADPH oxidase (NOX) in oxidative stress during glaucoma. NOX has been identified
  as a major source of oxidative stress in many retinal eye diseases, such as age-related
  macular degeneration and ischemic retinopathy. Reactive oxygen species produced
  by NOX affect the regulation of various cellular processes such as proliferation,
  differentiation, and migration. Excitotoxicity: Glutamate plays an important function
  in regulating neurophysiological processes. However, increased stimulation of relevant
  receptors with glutamate leads to neuronal damage and death'
