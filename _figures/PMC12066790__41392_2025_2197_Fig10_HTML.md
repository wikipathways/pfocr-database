caption: 'Oncogenic mechanisms of HTLV-1 in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. a Progression
  of ATLL caused by HTLV-1. b HTLV-1 encoded proteins upregulate oncogenes and silence
  tumor suppressor genes via NF-κB-dependent and NF-κB-independent pathways, recruiting
  transcription factors to gene promoters. c The viral Tax protein increases genomic
  instability by promoting DNA damage and inhibiting DNA double-strand break repair.
  d HTLV-1 infection boosts cell proliferation through persistent activation of AKT/NF-κB
  and TGF-β/Smad pathways, and promotes YAP nuclear translocation. e HTLV-1 encoded
  proteins inhibit apoptosis by suppressing caspase signaling, activating the NF-κB
  pathway, and preventing FoxO3a nuclear translocation. f HTLV-1-infected host cells
  achieve immune escape by reducing Tax protein expression, generating Tax mutants,
  and suppressing Th1 cytokine production. g HTLV-1 mediates immune suppression by
  inducing inhibitory receptor expression on T cells and recruiting Treg cells. h
  HTLV-1 induces chronic inflammation by causing host cells to overproduce IL-10.
  i HTLV-1 infection enhances intracellular glycolysis, pyrimidine biosynthesis, and
  lipid synthesis. Fuchsia text: Components of HTLV-1; Black text: Components of host
