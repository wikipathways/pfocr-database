caption: 'The MRN complex activates possible (alternative) pathways at DSBs. The MRN
  complex can initially be recruited to a DSB by RAD17 and activates the ATM kinase.
  Once activated, ATM phosphorylates downstream substrates including MDC1, which in
  turn recruits MRN, and the ATM signal is further amplified at the DSB. ATM checkpoint
  signaling leads to cell cycle regulation through CHK2 activation ( far left). On
  the basis of the cell cycle phase and nature of the DSB ends, DSBs are channeled
  through either HR or NHEJ for repair (central paths). In HR, the MRN complex initiates
  the 5΄ resection followed by long-range resection by EXO1 or DNA2. The resulting
  3΄ ssDNA overhangs are loaded with ssDNA-binding protein RPA. The RPA-coated ssDNA
  can activate a second checkpoint pathway: ATR signaling. ATR is recruited to the
  RPA-coated ssDNA through ATRIP and RPA interaction. Then the RAD17–RFC clamp loading
  complex loads the 9–1–1 (RAD9–HUS1–RAD1) checkpoint clamp at the ssDNA and dsDNA
  junction on the RPA-coated ssDNA arms. The ATR activator TopBP1 is loaded by RAD9,
  leading to activation of CHK1 kinase and cell cycle regulation. For high-fidelity
  DSB repair, the BRCA2–RAD51 complex nucleates the formation of RAD51 nucleofilaments
  and displaces RPA from ssDNA. RAD51 nucleofilaments promote homology search and
  strand invasion in association with BRCA1–BARD1 for error-free HR repair through
  the resolution of repair intermediates. The two NHEJ pathways (right) depend upon
  DNA-PKcs and MRN–CtIP. In C-NHEJ, DSB ends are bluntly fused through Ku70/80–DNA-PKcs
  complex tethering, Artemis-mediated end processing, ligase IV, and XLF-XRCC4 scaffolding
