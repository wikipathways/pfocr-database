caption: Pivotal role of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) in regulating the
  metabolic switch between glucose and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle in
  physiological and pathological conditions. (a) In the physiological condition, insulin
  signaling‐mediated protein kinase B (AKT) and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) pathway
  regulates PDK4 expression. Low expression of PDK4 and optimal mitochondrial Ca2+
  entry through the inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1)–glucose‐regulated
  protein 75 (GRP75)–voltage‐dependent anion‐selective channel 1 (VDAC1) complex at
  mitochondria‐associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (MAM) stimulates pyruvate
  dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (PDP1), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), α‐ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase (αKGDH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase activity to enhance
  glucose oxidation, whereas a decline in insulin level induces PDK4 to activate fatty
  acid oxidation through inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). This
  signaling feedback loop plays a crucial role in controlling the metabolic switch
  and stability. (b) The pathological condition caused by defective insulin signaling
  or increasing fatty acid level upregulates PDK4 expression and stability. Prolonged
  induction of PDK4 suppresses pyruvate oxidation and enhances mitochondrial Ca2+
  flux through MAM to drive fatty acid oxidation, leading to metabolic instability.
  A constant increase of mitochondrial Ca2+ level promotes mitochondrial membrane
  potential (MMP) loss and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation results in opening
  of permeability transition pore (mPTP). In contrast, excessive mitochondrial ROS
  production induces ER‐stress and activates c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) which
  negatively affects insulin signaling through inhibition of insulin receptor substrate 1
  (IRS1). ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator; CD36,
