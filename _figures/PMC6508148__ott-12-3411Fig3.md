caption: 'Proposed models of CST1 participating in the signaling pathways.Notes: CST1
  was involved in GSK3, AKT, and IL-6 pathways. CST1 knockdown increased phosphorylation
  of GSK3, leading to induction of glycogen accumulation associated with cellular
  senescence and inhibition of tumor proliferation. CST1 knockdown reduced phosphorylation
  of AKT and inhibited cancer cell proliferation. CST1 knockdown led to IL-6 accumulation
  and regulated cell growth and proliferation (A). CST1 was involved in Wnt pathway
  as a target of TCF and contributed to cell proliferation (B).'
