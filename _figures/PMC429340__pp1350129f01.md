caption: Schematic diagram of amide amino acid metabolism (top), the Asp-family pathway
  (center), and the pathway of Lys catabolism (bottom). Dashed arrows with a “-” sign
  represent end-product feedback inhibition loops. GOGAT, Glu synthase; AAT, Asp aminotransferase;
  AS, Asn synthase; ASN, asparaginase; AK, Asp kinase; DHPS, dihydrodipicolinate synthase;
  HSD, homoserine dehydrogenase; LKR, Lys-ketoglutarate reductase; SDH, saccharopine
  dehydrogenase; 3-ASA, 3-aspartic semialdehyde; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; α-AASA, α-amino
  adipic semialdehyde. Broken arrow at the bottom indicates several enzymatic steps
  leading to the production of acetyl-CoA. The enzymatic steps manipulated in this
  report (DHPS and LKR) are circled.
