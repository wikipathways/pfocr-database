caption: TNF-induced canonical NF-κB and apoptosis pathways. Different linkage types
  of ubiquitin chains, Met 1-, Lys 11-, Lys 48- and Lys 63-linked ubiquitin chains,
  are involved in the TNF-induced canonical NF-κB signalling pathway and the TNFR
  complex II-dependent apoptosis pathway. Ubiquitin chains of different linkage types
  are generated by E3 ligases (shown in brown), such as cIAP, HOIP-containing LUBAC
  complex and SCF-βTrCP. These ubiquitin chains are hydrolysed by DUBs (in yellow)
  such as OTULIN and CYLD. A20 has a dual role as an E3 ligase and a DUB. Ubiquitination
  of the substrates including cIAPs, RIPK1, NEMO and IκB-α are critical for the signalling
  pathway. The TNFR complex II-mediated apoptosis pathway includes RIPK1, TRADD, FADD
  and Caspase 8. Activation of Caspase 8 leads to the Caspase 3-dependent cleavage
  of PARP and apoptosis. The LUBAC complex (HOIP, SHARPIN and HOIL-1L) and the CYLD-SPATA2
  complex regulates the TNFR complex II-induced apoptosis pathway. Involvement of
  OTULIN in this apoptosis signalling pathway is not yet determined.
