caption: Putative model of cold stress signaling networks toward freezing stress tolerance
  in Arabidopsis. The cold-induced calcium signature in the cytosol is recognized
  by the calcium sensor proteins, including CaM, CDPK, CBL1/CIPK7, and CAMAT3, as
  well as the bZIP transcription factor SGB1 pathway. In addition, CRLK1-MEK1-MKK1/2-MPK4/6
  cascade, ROS signaling, and phospholipid signaling work together to regulate cold
  stress signaling, and many ICE1-DREB transcription activators and repressors have
  been identified to regulate the COR gene expressions, finally leading to freezing
  tolerance in Arabidopsis.
