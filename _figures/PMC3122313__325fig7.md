caption: A model for hypoxic induction of PAU gene expression. During hypoxic growth,
  when heme and ergosterol levels are low, membrane fluidity is altered. This change
  is proposed to activate the Hog1 MAPK cascade via the Sln1/Ssk1 pathway. In turn,
  activated Hog1 may induce PAU transcription directly, by translocating to the nucleus
  and activating transcription factors, or indirectly, by influencing signaling events
  in the cytoplasm, such as activation of Upc2. In addition, a SAGA-dependent, Hog1-independent
  pathway induces UPC2 transcription. The induction of PAU and other genes by this
  pathway is important in maintaining the cell wall and membrane in the absence of
  oxygen. Solid arrows indicate parts of the model strongly supported by our results;
  dashed arrows represent speculative consequences of Hog1 activation. We have left
  Mga2 out of the current model, pending further information on its relationship to
  the factors shown.
