caption: A. A simplified illustration of the synergistic mechanisms through which
  harmine and TGFβSF pathway inhibitors cooperate to enhance human beta cell proliferation.
  Harmine, acting on DYRK1A, primarily activates cyclins, cdks and related cell cycle
  activators. In parallel, TGFβSF pathway inhibitors relieve expression of cell cycle
  inhibitors, including CDKN1A encoding p21CIP, CDKN1C encoding p57KIP, and CDKN2B
  encoding p15INK4. As suggested in , harmine also has direct or indirect effects
  on TGFβSF-SMAD signaling, and it is likely that DYRK1A has effects on other targets
  in addition to NFaTs. B. In the canonical TGFβ paradigm, ligands such as TGFβ, activins,
  inhibins, myostatin, GDF11, and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) bind to multi-subunit
  receptors that phosphorylate, and thereby activate, so-called receptor SMADs (SMADs
  2,3, and 1,5,8/9). These are then able to heteromerize with SMAD4, a common SMAD,
  and the SMAD4 heteromers translocate to the nucleus where, among other things, they
  are incorporated into the chromatin-modifying and DNA-methylating Trithorax Complex,
  and thereby influence expression of multiple gene families. Adapted from Brown and
  Schneyer ().
