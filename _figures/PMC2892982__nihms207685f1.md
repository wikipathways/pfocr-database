caption: (A) The architecture of KCa3.1 relative to the plasma membrane and the position
  of the 17 amino acid Bacillus licheniformis β-lactamase (BLAP) epitope tag between
  the third and fourth transmembrane domains. KCa3.1 is a six transmembrane domain
  K+ channel in which the N- and C-termini are cytoplasmic. The lysine within the
  BLAP sequence is specifically labeled with biotin via the co-expressed BirA-KDEL
  in the endoplasmic reticulum. Plasma membrane-expressed channels are then specifically
  labeled with streptavidin–Alexa555 such that only plasma membrane localized channels
  are tagged with fluorophore. (B) The labeling of KCa3.1 and the plasma membrane
  with unique fluorophores. Following labeling of plasma membrane channels with streptavidin–Alexa555
  (red) and the plasma membrane itself with WGA–Alexa488 (green) we can discriminate
  between plasma membrane-localized KCa3.1 and channels in either endosomes or lysosomes,
  as illustrated. Channels within the biosynthetic pathway are biotinylated, but not
  fluorescently tagged (shown in blue), and therefore not recognized in this assay.
  High-resolution images of individual cells are shown to further illustrate this
  protocol. As shown at time 0, KCa3.1 is localized exclusively to the plasma membrane.
  This colocalization is shown as yellow. By contrast, after 90 min at 37°C, KCa3.1
  has been endocytosed (red endosomes). By examining the loss of colocalization we
  can determine the amount of endocytosis and whether this is affected by small molecules.
  Cellular images were captured with an Olympus IX-81 epifluorescence microscope equipped
  with a 60× oil objective. Multiple z-planes were captured, the images deconvolved
  and shown as a projection image.
