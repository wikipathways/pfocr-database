caption: 'Differentiation pathway during a T cell immune response to a viral infection.
  During a viral infection we have the following events: (i) Naive cells, N, differentiate
  into effector cells with rate  when presented with VDPs they recognize. (ii) Effector
  cells, E, proliferate with rate . (iii) Memory cells, M, differentiate into effector
  cells with rate  when presented with VDPs they recognize. Naive cells are homeostatically
  maintained by survival stimuli from self-pMHCs with rate . Memory cells are homeostatically
  maintained by survival stimuli from cytokines with rate . Naive, effector and memory
  cells die at (per cell) rates ,  and , respectively. Once infection is cleared,
  effector cells differentiate into memory cells at a rate . We assume  is such that
  , with  a fraction in the range of 5–10 % [].'
