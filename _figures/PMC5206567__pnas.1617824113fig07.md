caption: The locus coeruleus (LC) pathway to cortex and its involvement in stress.
  Many neurons in the locus coeruleus coexpress NA and GAL. In rats, under normal
  circumstances these neurons fire spontaneously in a slow and regular fashion (),
  but in response to stress they react with increased activity and burst firing ().
  NA is stored primarily in synaptic vesicles and is released at low activity and
  more so after stress (, ), acting on adrenoreceptors (ARs). GAL is stored only in
  large, dense core (LDC) vesicles and is released extrasynaptically () in response
  to increased/burst firing () from these vesicles in nerve endings in the forebrain.
  In humans (this study), GAL may, e.g., activate inhibitory postsynaptic GAL1 receptors
  (GalR1) on neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate
  cortex (ACC). Presumably, release also can occur from dendrites/soma in the locus
  coeruleus, activating inhibitory GAL3 autoreceptors (GalR3). It is hypothesized
  that under excessive/chronic stress GAL induces a long-lasting inhibition of NA
  neurons and thus of NA release in forebrain regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal
  cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, contributing to the development of MDD. Not
  included are changes in GAL, GALR1, and GALR3 mRNA levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal
  cortex.
