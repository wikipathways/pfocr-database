caption: 'a Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, in particular from the EIF2AK3-EIF2A-ATF3
  pathway, plays a dual role in ferroptosis. ATF4 inhibits ferroptosis by promoting
  HSPA5-mediated GPX4 protein stabilization or SLC7A11 expression, whereas it induces
  ferroptosis by upregulation of CHAC1 to degrade GSH. In addition, ER stress induces
  Ca2+ influx to trigger ESCRT-III–mediated membrane repair, which prevents membrane
  damage during ferroptosis. b STING1, a transmembrane protein on the ER, is activated
  by oxidized 8-OHG or CTSB-mediated DNA damage. STING1 then promotes ferroptosis
  by autophagy or an MFN1/MFN2 mediated-mitochondrial fusion pathway. c The ER enzyme
  SCD, a target gene of SREBP1, is essential for the biosynthesis of MUFA. ACSL3 is
  responsible for the activation of MUFA, which competitively inhibits PUFA-induced
  ferroptosis. SREBP1-SCD can be activated by the PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway, a double
  mutation of STK11 and KEAP1, or the FBW7-NR4A1 pathway. d Zinc ions (Zn2+) can induce
  ferroptosis. The inhibition of zinc transporter SLC39A7 on the ER can trigger the
  expression of the ER stress-associated gene HERPUD1, which drives ferroptosis resistance.
