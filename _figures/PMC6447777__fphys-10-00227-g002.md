caption: 'Potential candidates of miRNA-based therapy against perinatal hypoxic-ischemic
  brain injury. Listed are miRNAs and their downstream targets supporting potentially
  beneficial outcomes after perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Supporting citations
  are reviewed in text and summarised below. In-vitro evidence: Downregulation of
  miR-9 and miR-200b mediates serum response factor (SRF) induced oligodendrocyte
  progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation (). miR-29c (Yi Zhang et al., 2015) and miR-17-92
  cluster () attenuates the inhibitory effect of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans
  (CSPG) on axonal regrowth by stimulating ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and
  phosphate and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein levels. miR-592 attenuates the activation
  of pro-apoptotic signalling and neuronal death by targeting the prostaglandin D2
  receptor (PTGDR) and neurotrophin receptor (NTR) p75 (; ). In-vivo evidence: miR-27a
  reduces TLR4-mediated inflammation (Li et al., 2015). Downregulation of miR-15a
  expression promote vasculogenesis by stimulating neurotrophic factors, fibroblast
  growth factor 2 (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (), which can
  further support late stage oligodendrocyte (OL) proliferation/migration () and neural
  progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation/proliferation (), respectively. Mesenchymal
  stem cell (MSC) derived exosomal transfer of miR-133b enhanced neurite outgrowth

  mediated neuronal delivery of miR-124 induces neurogenesis () speculatively via
  Usp14-dependent REST degradation () and inhibition of the JAG/Notch signalling pathway
