caption: Regulation of fatty acid synthase by O-GlcNAcylation, Terra incognita. FAS
  expression and O-GlcNAcylation levels are dependent on glucose concentrations. Following
  its entry into the cell, glucose can engage in different metabolic pathways depending
  on the cell type and the physiological context (glycolysis, glycogenogenesis, pentose
  phosphate pathway, etc.). HBP converts a fraction of glucose into UDP-GlcNAc, the
  donor for O-GlcNAcylation processes. Either for storing energy or for the biosynthesis
  of membranes of proliferating cells, a large pool of glucose can be used for making
  fatty acids of which FAS (fatty acid synthase) is a key enzyme. FAS forms a head-to-head
  X-shaped homodimer. Each 273 kDa-subunit of FAS is an assembly line of fatty acids
  endowed with seven different catalytic activities. First, the acetyl moiety provided
  by acetyl-CoA is transferred to the thiol group of the phosphopantetheine part of
  ACP (acyl carrier protein) that transports the growing fatty acid chain from one
  catalytic domain to another via the acetyltransferase (AT); it is presented to ketoacylsynthase
  (KS). Then, malonyl transferase (MT) transfers the malonyl moiety from malonyl-CoA
  to ACP, and KS condensates the malonyl and acetyl groups. The β-ketoacyl-ACP is
  modified by a succession of three reactions. Ketoreductase (KR) reduces β-ketoacyl
  to a β-hydroxyl intermediate; a dehydratase (DH) produces a β-enoyl-ACP, which is
  reduced by the enoyl reductase (ER) to supply a saturated acyl chain elongated by
  a two-carbon unit. This product is the substrate for the condensation with another
  malonyl-ACP in the next sequence of elongation. This cycle is repeated until a C16:0
  is reached; the end product is finally released by the thioesterase activity (TE).
  Since there is a close Relationship between intracellular glucose, O-GlcNAcylation
  levels, and activation of glucido-lipidic metabolism, a link between OGT, O-GlcNAcylation
  level, expression, and activity of FAS should exist. In cancer cells, the increased
  expression of OGT might lead to an increase in FAS expression. FAS participates
  in the production of phosphoinositides found in lipid rafts; these lipid microdomains
  can recruit OGT in the close proximity of FAS increasing its activity and, thus,
  to an expansion of membrane surface necessary for cell proliferation.
