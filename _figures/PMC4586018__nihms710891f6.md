caption: 'Besides its role as a GPCR kinase, GRK2 inhibits insulin signalling and
  may also control the GPCR-mediated transmodulation of the insulin pathway. A reduction
  in GRK2 abundance after obesity and insulin resistance have been established leads
  to: (i) an increased adrenergic-dependent lipolytic capacity in eWAT that provides
  BAT with free fatty acids. In turn, BAT displays an enhanced expression of oxidative
  and thermogenic markers, and consequently both tissues may contribute to the concerted
  protection against excessive fat mass accretion; (ii) improved insulin signalling
  in muscle which can underlie the enhanced insulin-induced glucose clearance; (iii)
  increased insulin signalling in liver associated with a decrease in triacylglyceride
  accumulation and inflammation within this tissue. All these processes may mediate
  the protective effects of lowering GRK2 abundance against excessive body weight
  gain and HFD-induced insulin resistance.'
