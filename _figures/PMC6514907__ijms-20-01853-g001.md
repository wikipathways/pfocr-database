caption: Enhancement of SUMOylation in glioblastoma contributes to alterations in
  multiple cellular processes leading to an increased malignant phenotype. Glioblastoma
  displays an increase in E1 (SAE1), E2 (Ubc9), and E3 (PIAS1 and PIAS3) enzymes leading
  to global enhancement of SUMOylation and a resultant increase in the SUMOylation
  level of target proteins. Further, increased expression of SUMO-specific protease
  (SENP1) has been reported in glioblastoma. Presently, studies have implicated CDK6
  and HIF-1α as important loci downstream of these effects that together contribute
  to cell cycle dysregulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and heightened glycolytic
  metabolism. DNA double-strand break repair has additionally been associated with
  perturbations in SUMOylation. Together, these altered cellular processes give rise
  to an enhanced malignant phenotype in glioblastoma including uncontrolled growth,
  increased invasion and aggressiveness, a malignant bioenergetics profile with Warburg
  effect, and resistance to ionizing radiation. Targeting SUMOylation may represent
  a therapeutic approach to reverse the pathologic consequences of enhanced SUMOylation
  in glioblastoma. Available therapeutic agents known to inhibit SUMOylation are identified
  along with their targets in the SUMOylation pathway.
