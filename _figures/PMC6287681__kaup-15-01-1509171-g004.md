caption: Autophagy signaling pathways induced by NPs. During autophagy, specific intracellular
  cargo is sequestered by phagophores. Autophagy is initiated by the activation of
  ULK1 and subsequent induction of a nucleation complex, including the class III PtdIns3K.
  Maturation and elongation require conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5, and of Atg8-family
  proteins including LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine. The completed phagophore forms
  an autophagosome; subsequent fusion with the lysosome, releases its contents into
  the lumen where the cargo is degraded and the resulting macromolecules are released
  back into the cytoplasm. Autophagy induction may lead to cell survival or cell death,
  depending on the cell content or type of stimuli. NPs can induce autophagic cell
  death through modulation of the MTOR pathway or may trigger autophagy blockage via
  lysosomal impairment.
