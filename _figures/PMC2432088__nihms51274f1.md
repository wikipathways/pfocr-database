caption: A representative schematic for the canonical and non-canonical pathways is
  shown. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is referred to as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  since it can regulate β-catenin. All Wnt signaling pathways are initiated by interaction
  of Wnt proteins with Frizzled (FZD) receptors. The Wnt signaling pathway will only
  be activated if the binding of the Wnt protein to the FZD receptor takes place in
  the presence of the co-receptor LRP-5/6 resulting in the formation of a Wnt-FZD-LRP-5/6
  tri-molecular complex. Once Wnt protein binds to the FZD receptor and the co-receptor
  LRP-5/6, this is followed by recruitment of Dishevelled (DVL). DVL is phosphorylated
  by casein kinase Iε to form a complex with Frat1 and inhibit glycogen synthase kinase
  (GSK-3β) activity. The non-canonical or atypical Wnt signaling pathway has two intracellular
  signaling cascades that consist of the Wnt/Ca2+pathway and the Wnt/PCP pathway.
  In the Wnt/Ca2+pathway, Wnt protein binds to FZD receptors on the cell surface resulting
  in several cellular processes that involve stimulation of heterotrimeric G proteins,
  increased intracellular Ca2+ release, decreased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)
  levels, and activation of the two kinases Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
  II (CamKII) or calcineurin (CaCN) and protein kinase C (PKC). Activation of these
  pathways can stimulate several transcription factors. In the Wnt/PCP pathway, Wnt
  proteins bind to FZD receptors on the cell surface followed by activating Rho/Rac
  small GTPase and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to assist with cytoskeletal organization
  and gene expression.
