caption: 'A UVB-induced inherent cellular responses. UVB radiation leads human dermal
  fibroblasts to apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. UVB treatment induces in parallel
  the EGFR-Akt signaling pathway and the JNKs MAPKs which intervene with the phosphorylation
  of p53, part of the ROS-independent DNA damage response of the cells towards UVB
  genotoxicity. EGFR-Akt, JNKs, and ATM-p53 pathways seem to co-operate for the protection
  towards UVB radiation and the retention of a sufficient percentage of viable cells
  in the exposed population. This is evidenced by the increased loss of viability
  after Akt inhibition or siRNA-mediated knocking-down and the unmitigated cell death
  when directly (or indirectly through JNKs inhibition) impeding the activation of
  the ATM-p53 pathway. B Interplay of exogenously supplied photoprotective molecules
  with the intrinsic UVB-induced machinery to amplify the resistance of human skin
  fibroblasts against UVB radiation. Whereas the known anti-oxidant Trolox does not
  increase cell survival rate after UVB exposure, extra protection is conferred by
  other exogenously supplied molecules: suramin acts as a UV shield; EGF activates
  EGFR; SC79 enhances inherent cellular response (i.e., it activates further Akt and
  JNKs) and triggers Nrf2 activation downstream of Akt; sulforaphane induces Nrf2
  activation independent of the Akt or JNKs signaling pathways. Nrf2-mediated protection
  by SC79 and sulforaphane is not based on ROS-scavenging and can be attributed to
  the transcription factor’s ability to safeguard genome integrity or to produce a
  protective extracellular matrix.'
