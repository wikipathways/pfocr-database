caption: FSH signaling. Activation of FSHR by FSH leads to increase in intracellular
  cAMP through Gs-adenylate cyclase. Increased cAMP leads to PKA activation, which
  regulate expression of several genes through phosphorylation of transcription factors
  like CREBP. FSH also causes increase in Ca2+ by depolarization of Ca channels. Increased
  Ca2+ can upregulate calmodulin kinase leading to modulation of downstream effectors.
  In addition to cAMP, FSH has also been shown to modulate PLA, Erk, p38 MAPK, and
  PI3Kinase pathways. Activated FSHR is phosphorylated by BARK, which in turn recruits
  β-arrestin to the receptor and lead to down regulation of FSHR, in addition, β-arrestin
  independently can activate Erk pathway.
