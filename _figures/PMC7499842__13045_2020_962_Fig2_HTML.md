caption: 'BCMA signaling pathway. BCMA has two agonist ligands: a proliferation-inducing
  ligand (APRIL) and B cell activating factor (BAFF), which are mainly secreted by
  the bone marrow (BM) stromal cells, osteoclasts, and macrophages in a paracrine
  manner in the BM. APRIL exhibits a much higher binding affinity to BCMA than BAFF,
  and it also binds to TACI, while BAFF endorses more selectivity to BAFF-R. Multiple
  growth and survival signaling cascades are subsequently activated in the multiple
  myeloma (MM) cells, most frequently through NF-κβ, leading to upregulation of anti-apoptotic
  proteins and production of cell adhesion molecules, angiogenesis factors, and immunosuppressive
  molecules. These lead to increased survival of MM cells. Membrane BCMA can be cleaved
  by γ-secretase and released to the plasma as soluble BCMA (sBCMA). sBCMA can bind
  to APRIL and BAFF, which may interfere with the activation of BCMA signaling pathways'
