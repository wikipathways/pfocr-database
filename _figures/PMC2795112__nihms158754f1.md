caption: 'Fate of mischarged tRNAs in protein synthesis: Misactivated amino acids
  can be edited prior to their transfer to the tRNA either in a tRNA independent or
  dependent fashion (pathways 1 and 2 respectively). Following transfer mischarged
  aa-tRNA can be edited in cis (pathway 3) or trans (pathway 4) by the aaRS editing
  site. Free-standing editing factors such as YbaK and AlaXps can also hydrolyze mischarged
  aa-tRNAs (pathway 4). Mischarged Glu-tRNAGln or Asp-tRNAAsn are converted to Gln-tRNAGln
  or Asn-tRNAAsnvia the transamidase reaction (tRNA-dependent amino acid biosynthesis,
  pathway 5).'
