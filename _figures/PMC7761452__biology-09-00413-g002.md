caption: Metazoan MOB proteins present extensive regulation between isotypes. The
  canonical Hippo pathway is activated by upstream signals resulting in MST1/2 phosphorylation
  (which may be mediated by SAV1) and MOB1-LATS1/2 activation, causing YAP/TAZ phosphorylation
  and cytoplasm retention. The lack of YAP/TAZ transcriptional signaling results in
  a tumor suppressing effect. However, MOB proteins present several activities beyond
  canonical Hippo signaling. These include non-canonical Hippo signaling through different
  interactions with GCKII STE20 or NDR kinases, direct MOB stimulation by upstream
  signals and direct stimulation by MOBs of non-Hippo proteins. This intricate network
  results in direct and indirect MOB to MOB regulation. PLK1 regulates mitotic spindle
  orientation through NDR1 phosphorylation which results in NDR1 binding shifting
  from MOB1 to MOB2, favoring canonical Hippo activation []. NDR1/2 also regulate
  P21 and RABIN8 [,]. MOB3 is a MOB1 antagonist by inhibiting MST1 []. MOB4/Phocein-MST4,
  part of the STRIPAK complex, also antagonizes MOB1, by disrupting MOB1-MST1/1 binding
  []. MOB1 interacts in a HsMOB1-PPP6R1/2/3-ANKRD28 complex which appears to inhibit
  MOB1 mediated Hippo activation and in a DOCK6/7/8-CRLF3-LRCH3/4 complex, in a phosphorylation
  dependent manner [,]. Both PP6 phosphatase and DOCK6-8 promote actin cytoskeleton
  polarization signaling via RAC1. The FERMT2-PRAJA2 complex inhibits Hippo signaling
  by promoting MOB1 ubiquitin-proteasome degradation []. MOB1 is stimulated by GSK3β,

  description: Metazoan MOB proteins present extensive regulation between isotypes.
    The canonical Hippo pathway is activated by upstream signals resulting in MST1/2
    phosphorylation (which may be mediated by SAV1) and MOB1-LATS1/2 activation, causing
    YAP/TAZ phosphorylation and cytoplasm retention. The lack of YAP/TAZ transcriptional
    signaling results in a tumor suppressing effect. However, MOB proteins present
    several activities beyond canonical Hippo signaling. These include non-canonical
    Hippo signaling through different interactions with GCKII STE20 or NDR kinases,
    direct MOB stimulation by upstream signals and direct stimulation by MOBs of non-Hippo
    proteins. This intricate network results in direct and indirect MOB to MOB regulation.
    PLK1 regulates mitotic spindle orientation through NDR1 phosphorylation which
    results in NDR1 binding shifting from MOB1 to MOB2, favoring canonical Hippo activation
    []. NDR1/2 also regulate P21 and RABIN8 [,]. MOB3 is a MOB1 antagonist by inhibiting
