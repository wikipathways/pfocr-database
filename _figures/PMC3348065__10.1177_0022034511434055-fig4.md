caption: 'TGFβ and FGF signaling pathways in tongue development. (A) Schematic diagram
  of the mouse tongue at E13.5, showing the expression of CNCC-derived mesenchyme
  markers Scleraxis (green) and FGF10 (blue), and the muscle differentiation marker
  MHC (pink). Arrows indicate influences from CNCC-derived mesenchyme to myoblasts.
  (B) Model for the mechanism of TGFβ signaling pathway regulation of tongue development.
  TGFβ signaling controls the expression of Scx and Fgf10 in the CNCC-derived mesenchyme.
  In turn, FGF10 is necessary for the induction of proliferation of myogenic progenitors
  and muscle organization (see also arrows in A), which highlights the relevance of
  tissue-tissue interactions in tongue morphogenesis. (C) Schematic diagram of the
  mouse tongue at E13.5, showing the expression of two MRFs involved in myogenic differentiation
  (myogenin and MyoD), which is coincident with the expression pattern of FGFR (pink).
  (D) Model for the activity of FGF in myoblasts of the tongue. Previous work and
  our unpublished observations suggest that FGF signaling controls differentiation
  and fusion of myoblasts in a cell-autonomous manner via the regulation of myogenin
  expression during tongue development. Abbreviations: PS, palatal shelves.'
