caption: Effect of S. indica colonisation on the expression of genes involved in the
  biosynthetic pathway of sterol precursors and glycoalkaloids in tomato leaves and
  roots. Changes in gene expression between tissues from inoculated plants and tissues
  from endophyte-free plants are represented as log2 of the fold change in the form
  of a heatmap. Data derived from RNA sequencing of leaves and roots from S. indica-colonised
  and endophyte-free plants. Asterisks (*) indicate FDR-corrected p ≤ 0.05. HMGR1,
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; SQS, squalene synthase; CAS, cycloartenol
  synthase; SSR2, sterol side-chain reductase 2; C5/SD, Δ(7)-sterol-C5-desaturase;
