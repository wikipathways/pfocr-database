caption: Schematic Diagram of CYP3A5′s Dual Role in the Regulation of Hypertension.
  Environmental factors (e.g., diet, chemical exposure, and stress) and homeostatic
  signaling mechanisms (i.e., Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System (RAAS)) can alter
  renal and adrenal gland function to promote hypertension in humans. There is increasing
  evidence that renal CYP3A5 activity plays a dual role in modulating vitamin D- and
  glucocorticoid-hormone signaling cascades that drive HBP pathology. First, CYP3A5
  activity can convert stress-related glucocorticoids (corticosterone and cortisol)
  to mineralocorticoids via 6β-hydroxylation, which enhances MR signaling and triggers
  sodium retention (via several transporter related mechanisms) and increased ROS
  production. This activity also silences glucocorticoid signaling (via ACTH and NFkB)
  and increases inflammation. Second, CYP3A5 can hijack endogenous vitamin D hormone
  signaling cascades by shunting 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 metabolism from CYP27B1 (1α-hydroxylase)
  towards a 4β-hydroxylation pathway that limits 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3signaling
  via the VDR, reducing renin production that suppresses systemic RAAS activity. Thus,
  CYP3A5 appears to play a pathological endogenous role in many human polymorphs by
  regulating positive feedback loops that drives the accumulation of stress hormones
  and sodium in the renal proximal tubule cells. Sodium cationic-stabilization of
  G4-like elements in CYP3A5 intron 3 may exacerbate this hypertensive signaling arc
  in CYP3A5 *1/*3 and *3/*3 polymorphs, who may conditionally express the gene. This
  salt-sensitive positive feedback loop may mask any adaptive effects of the 6986A/G
  polymorphism (rs776746) by promoting stress- and dietary-sensitive expression of
  CYP3A5, complicating any GWAS studies focused on the *1/*3 or *3/*3 genotypes.
