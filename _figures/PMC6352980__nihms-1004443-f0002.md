caption: Self-renewal and differentiation are tightly balanced by opposing signals
  received from cell surface receptors. Self-renewal is promoted by WNT ligand binding
  to Frizzled–low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 (LRP5) or LRP6 complexes
  or by ligand engagement of receptor complexes signalling through signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), including receptors containing the GP130
  subunit or the interleukin-21 (IL-21) receptor. Activation of these signalling pathways
  leads to the transcription of target genes that favour self-renewal and that withhold
  differentiation, including STAT3 and Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family members and
  inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins. Conversely, pro-mitotic cytokines such as
  IL-2 and growth factors can drive cellular differentiation by triggering the PI3K–AKT–mTOR
  pathway, as well as the RAS–RAF–MAPK pathway. The pro-differentiating influence
  of the RAS–RAF–MAPK pathway can be counteracted by SMAD signalling that is induced
  by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) or bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family
  members through the induction of dual specificity phosphatase 9 (DUSP9) and the
  E protein regulators, ID molecules. Finally, activation of the Hippo pathways through
  a poorly characterized ligand–receptor interaction causes inactivation of Yes-associated
  protein (YAP), resulting in enhanced cellular differentiation. Between these self-renewal
  and pro-differentiation pathways exists a significant amount of crosstalk such that
  the net influence of each pathway is finely balanced and tuned. The dashed arrows
