caption: A schematic presentation of the miRNAs biogenetic mechanism. This pathway
  starts with the DNA transcription of microRNAs coding genes by RNA polymerase II
  which results in the formation of primary miRNA (pri-miRNA). The latter is cleaved
  by ribonuclease complex Drosha (ribonuclease III)-DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region
  8 (DGR8), resulting in the formation of premicroRNA. The pre-miRNA is transferred
  into the cytoplasm via Ran-GTP6 and Exportin 5 and then is cleaved by the Dicer
  (RNase III endonuclease)–TRBP complex. By this cleavage mature miRNA (duplex miRNA)
  is formed, which is double-stranded. Then, the latter is unwound with one of the
  strands being degraded and the other being integrated to the Argonaut protein. Then,
  miRNA interacts with the targeted mRNA sequence(s), which either has a repressed
  translation or it could be silenced or degraded. This figure was created with BioRender.com
