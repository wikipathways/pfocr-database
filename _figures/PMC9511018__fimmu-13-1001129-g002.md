caption: 'Cytotoxic functions of CD8 T cells: (A) Direct cytotoxicity: CD8 T cells
  release perforin and granzyme B through MHC-I/TCR axis in order to activate the
  apoptotic pathway in the target cells. Further, the interaction between FasR and
  FasL results in activation of caspases and eventually apoptosis (B) Indirect cytotoxicity:
  (a) In response to activation by antigen re-exposure and cytokine release, antigen-specific
  memory CD8 T cells release a wide range of cytokines and chemokines such as IFNγ,
  CCL3, and MCP1 that would help (b) recruit innate cells such monocytes and NK cells
  that in turn secrete CXCL9/10 in order to further (c) amplify the recruitment of
  memory CD8 T cells, activate of B cells, and DCs (not shown in the figure).'
