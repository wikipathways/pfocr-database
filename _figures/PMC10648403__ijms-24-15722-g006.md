caption: Expression profiles of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
  pathway. The heat map provides differential gene expression profiles in control
  (Con-1, Con-2, Con-3) and 4-CPA-treated (4-CPA-1, 4-CPA-2, 4-CPA-3) plants. PAL,
  phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; HCT, shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase;
  C3H, coumarate-3-hydroxylase; CCOAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferas; COMT, caffeic
  acid 3-O-methyltransferase; HCALDH, coniferyl-aldehyde dehydrogenase; F5H, ferulate-5-hydroxylase;
  CAD, cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase; POD, peroxidase. The dot lines represented
  uncertain reaction processes in rice. The red arrows indicated the heatmap of each
  gene.
