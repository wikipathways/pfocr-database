caption: Schematic overview of the molecular mechanisms related to microglia activation
  by the SARS-CoV-2 and S protein. Microglial cells can mainly be activated by SARS-CoV-2/S
  spike protein through the TLR4-signaling pathway. In addition, the S protein enhances
  activity of the ATP+ ion channel, and PANX1 and purinergic receptor P2X7/K+, which
  together with calcium influx can lead to ADAM17 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction.
  Both TLR4 and PANX1/P2X7 activation can lead to activation of NF-Kb transcription
  factor and inflammasome system activation. These mechanisms together lead to the
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, RIL-6, IL1-β and IL-18,
  involved in the cytokine storm and the increase of viral infection. Figure created
