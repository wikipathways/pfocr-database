caption: Proposed scheme for transcriptome stress response to APS. APS triggers the
  activation of targets within the JNK signaling pathway, including transcriptional
  activation of genes such as Dpp, Mmp1, upd1, upd2 (which are AP-1 transcription
  factor targets), as well as GADD45, Thor, Fas1, Fas2, Fas3 (targets of the Foxo
  transcription factor). Additionally, APS induces ER stress, activating transcription
  of the GstD family genes (targets of the Xrp1 transcription factor) and the Hsp70B
  family genes (targets of the Hsf transcription factor). However, in flies with Gagr
  gene knockdown, this transcriptional activation of the aforementioned genes is not
  observed
