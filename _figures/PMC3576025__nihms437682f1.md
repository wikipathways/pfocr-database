caption: Improvement of anti-tumor immune responses by preventing immunosuppressive
  effects from the adenosine-A2AR pathway. Extracellular levels of adenosine in tumors
  are higher than in normal tissues due, at least in part, to hypoxia. Extracellular
  adenosine binds to A2AR and/or A2BR on the surface of anti-tumor effector cells
  and subsequently increases cAMP levels. To break this potentially immunosuppressive
  sequence, therapeutic targets will include the accumulation of extracellular adenosine,
  binding of adenosine to A2AR/A2BR and cellular expression of A2AR/A2BR. Inhibitor
  of ectonucleotidases (e.g. CD73) can diminish metabolic production of adenosine
  from adenosine phosphates. Antagonists of A2AR/A2BR can block interaction of adenosine
  with the cell surface receptors. In adoptive immunotherapy, anti-tumor effector
  cells may be pretreated to be insensitive to adenosine by elimination of the receptor
  expression with siRNA or by simply culturing the cells with adenosine receptor agonist.
  Such treatment is expected to abolish adenosine-mediated immunosuppression in tumor
  microenvironment and promote tumor eradication by immune cells.
