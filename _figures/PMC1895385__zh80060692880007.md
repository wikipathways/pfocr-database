caption: 'Model of pro-αIIb interactions with the calnexin cycle. (A) The core N-linked
  glycan, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, is attached to the Asn at position 15 (N15) of pro-αIIb
  during translocation into the ER.(B) The glucosidases I and II (Gluc I + II) cleave
  off the glucose moieties, forming Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, which is the glycan form recognized
  by calnexin (CNX). (C) Pro-αIIb remains bound to calnexin until the third glucose
  moiety is cleaved off by glucosidase II. (D) The glycan formed by removal of the
  third glucose, Man9GlcNAc2, is a substrate for UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase
  (UGGT), which then reattaches a glucose moiety, recreating the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2.
  Because incompletely folded glycoproteins (shown as squiggle) are substrates for
  UGGT, partially folded pro-αIIb subunits cycle between calnexin and UGGT, which
  provides additional time to achieve its native fold. There are 2 exits from the
  cycle: (E) Pro-αIIb may achieve its native fold (shown as spiral), at which point
  it is no longer a substrate for UGGT, and thus continues on the biogenesis pathway
  to complex formation with β3, or (F) the slowly active mannosidase I (Man I) may
  cleave the terminal mannose from the middle branch of the glycan, creating the structural
  signal that targets pro-αIIb to the proteasome for degradation via binding to the
  mannosidase-like protein EDEM and retrotranslocation out of the ER (not shown).
  Of note is the finding that proteasomal degradation of pro-αIIb continues at the
  normal rate in the presence of glucosidase inhibitors; thus pro-αIIb may proceed
  directly from step A to step F, without interaction with calnexin.'
