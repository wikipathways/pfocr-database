caption: The mechanism schematic illustration of DLL4 can induce THP neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  in patients with HER2+ BC. DLL4-high tumor cells can secrete more DLL4 and autoactivate
  the Notch signaling pathway in tumor cell and promote cell stemness. The soluble
  DLL4 can also induce Notch signaling pathway in neutrophils and promote RBPJ bind
  to the promoter of NETosis key genes. The NETs formation induce T cell infiltration
  reduce, which further hampered the effects of THP therapy in HER2+ breast cancer.
  BC, breast cancer; CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; DLL4, delta-like ligand 4; HER2,
  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; NET, neutrophil extracellular trap; THP,
