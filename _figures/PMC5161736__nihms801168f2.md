caption: Resveratrol has been demonstrated to be an allosteric activator of SIRT1.
  (Price et al, 2013). Resveratrol may also act through phosphodiesterase (PDE) leading
  to AMPK activation, increased NAD+ and phosphorylation of Pgc-1α (). SIRT1 deacetylates
  Pgc-1α. Phosphorylated and deacetylated Pgc-1α augments mitochondrial biogenesis
  and function. The pathway of action of resveratrol has been suggested to be dose-dependent
  (Price et al, 2013). Among other functions of SIRT1 include deacetylation and inactivation
  of Nfkb and p53. P= phosphate group, Ac= acetyl group.
