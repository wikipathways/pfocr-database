caption: The proposed pathways of how cAMP and Ca2+ interact and result in increased
  AQP4 expression via Gs and Gq/11 in the pathology of HE during ALF. In the first
  pathway (red arrows), Gs binds to ACT and consequently activates AC, which produces
  cAMP as a secondary messenger. Subsequently, cAMP activates PKA. The activated cAMP-PKA
  signaling pathway may increase the intake of Ca2+ through TRPV-4 as the second pathway
  (amber arrows). The Ca2+ intake activates AC and results in the production of more
  cAMP. Afterward, PKA engages in numerous reactions, including the activation of
  AQP4 expression. In the third pathway (blue arrows), Gq/11 binds to AVP and consequently
  activates phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), which hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol
  (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two secondary messengers, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds to IP3 receptor on the ER, inducing Ca2+
  release. The released Ca2+ activates AC, thereby causing AQP4 upregulation. (For
