caption: Summary of the fate of key metabolites (arginine, proline, urea, and ornithine)
  in the arginine and proline metabolism (urea cycle). Catabolism of dietary amino
  acids leads to the production of ammonia. Ammonia further undergoes conversion to
  urea via the urea cycle. In mammals with conventional gut microbiota, urea is broken
  down to ammonia and CO2 by bacterial urease. The ammonia produced by microbiota
  is released into the GI tract and is taken up by host cells and serves as a substrate
  to synthesize arginine in the urea cycle. Within the urea cycle, arginine is then
  converted into urea and ornithine. Simultaneously, ornithine can also be synthesized
  by gut bacteria. Ornithine produced from the two mentioned pathways, can enter the
  arginine biosynthesis pathway to synthesize more arginine; nevertheless, the bacterial
  inhibition of arginine biosynthesis can be inhibited by some bacteria. This excess
  amount of arginine can either enter the arginine and proline biosynthesis pathways
  or the urea cycle.
