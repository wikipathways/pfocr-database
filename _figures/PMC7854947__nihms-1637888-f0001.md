caption: 'In response to cerebral ischemia, arachidonic acid (AA), a 20-carbon fatty
  acid, is released from the membrane-bound phospholipids by phospholipase A2 (PLA2)
  and then converted to an intermediate prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) by COX, which has
  two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. The COX-1 isozyme is constitutively expressed in
  most mammalian cells and tissues to maintain normal homeostasis, whereas COX-2 is
  usually undetectable under normal physiological conditions but quickly and robustly
  induced by cerebral ischemia at the injury sites. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
  drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, act as nonselective COX
  inhibitors, whereas the COXIBs selectively inhibit the COX-2 isoform. Short-lived
  PGH2 is then quickly converted to five different types of prostanoids, i.e., prostaglandin
  D2 (PGD2), PGE2, and PGF2α, prostacyclin PGI2, and thromboxane TXA2 by tissue-specific
  prostanoid synthases. As such, PGE2 is synthesized from PGH2 by three isozymes:
  microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), mPGES-2, and cytosolic PGES (cPGES).
  Among these three PGES isoforms, mPGES-1 is inducible, membrane-bound, and functionally
  linked to COX-2 in preference to COX-1. PGE2 elevation leads to the activation of
  four G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), namely, EP1-EP4. Specifically, the EP1
  receptor is associated with Gq; both EP2 and EP4 are linked to Gs; EP3 is mainly
  coupled to Gi, but some variants can stimulate Gs or G12/13, which activates the
  Rho pathway. These EP receptors together regulate neuronal inflammation and degeneration
  following ischemic stroke presumably through G protein-dependent pathways that are
  mediated by cyclic AMP (cAMP), inositol trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG)
  and Rho factor. Correspondingly, cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange
  protein activated by cAMP (EPAC); IP3 increases the cytosolic Ca2+ levels and thereby
  regulate Ca2+-sensitive pathways; DAG activates certain isoforms of protein kinase
  C (PKC); Rho leads to the activation of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). On
  the other hand, the activation of these GPCRs also can lead to G protein-independent
  pathways mediated by β-arrestin, which can be upregulated by cerebral ischemic stress.
  The activation of β-arrestin signaling coordinates the Beclin-1-dependent autophagy
  and is neuroprotective following cerebral ischemia. Note that only the major pathways
  are shown.'
