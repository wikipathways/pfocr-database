caption: The biosynthetic pathway that leads to the generation of ergosterol (in yeast
  and fungi) and cholesterol (in higher organisms). The ergosterol and cholesterol
  biosynthetic pathways are catalyzed by a cascade of enzymes, including those shown
  as well as others that were not highlighted in the text. Select examples of feedback
  loops are also shown. Key enzymes regulated by ERAD in yeast (ergosterol biosynthetic
  pathway, in blue) and mammals (cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, in orange) are
  also noted. Two factors (ApoB and ACAT2) that act after cholesterol synthesis in
  mammals are also highlighted. Where studied, select examples of proteins that facilitate
  substrate degradation by the ERAD pathway and that act on specific enzymes in these
  pathways are displayed in bold.
