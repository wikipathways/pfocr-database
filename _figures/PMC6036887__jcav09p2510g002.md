caption: The mechanisms that butyrate suppresses CRC development. Fermentation of
  fiber in the lumen leads to production of short-chain fatty acids including butyrate.
  Butyrate can inhibit the development of CRC and promote intestinal health through
  various mechanisms. For example, butyrate can decrease the NRP-1 expression by inhibiting
  the transactivation of Sp1 to suppress the angiogenesis, metastasis and survival
  of CRC cells, and butyrate can promote the apoptosis of CRC cells by hyper-activating
  Wnt signaling pathway. In addition, butyrate can restrict cell proliferation, colony
  formation, cell invasion, and induce cell apoptosis in CRC cells through upregulating
  the expression of miR-203, P21waf1 and bax, and promoting endocan expression. Meanwhile,
  butyrate can increase p57 mRNA and protein levels by inhibiting c-Myc expression,
  which reduces miR-17-92a cluster transcription and the level of miR-92a. Collectively,
  the interactions between butyrate, NRP-1, Wnt, endocan, P21waf1 and bax, miR-203
  and miR-92a mediate the anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effect of butyrate
  in CRC cells.
