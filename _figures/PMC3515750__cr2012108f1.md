caption: AMPK is phosphorylated and activated by LKB1 in response to an increasing
  cellular AMP:ATP ratio (which reflects a decrease in energy supply). AMPK in turn
  phosphorylates and inactivates ACC1/2, promoting a shift from fatty acid synthesis
  (FAS) to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). FAS depletes NADPH that is required for H2O2
  detoxification. FAO, by contrast, produces metabolites that are used by the TCA
  cycle, resulting in increased NADPH and enhanced cell survival. This pathway may
  only be transiently activated in glucose-deprived cells since ATP, produced by the
  coupling the TCA cycle with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), will eventually
  inhibit AMPK. In addition to the role of the LKB1-AMPK pathway in facilitating tumor
  cell survival, LKB1 is a context-specific tumor suppressor, which acts to control
  cell polarity and restrict cell growth via mTOR inactivation and induction of other
  AMPK-related kinases.
