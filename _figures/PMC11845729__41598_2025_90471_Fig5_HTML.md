caption: The expression pattern of differentially expressed genes involved in the
  Wnt signalling pathway, an ancient and evolutionarily conserved pathway regulates
  the cell migration, polarity, neural patterning and organogenesis during embryonic
  development. Although there was an overall activation of the Wnt signalling pathway,
  the Wnt11 gene and the Knypek gene in the Wnt/PCP pathway and a few Wnt/Ca2+ channel
  genes (PKC, CaM, CaMKII) were found to be downregulated in cremaster muscle of cryptorchid
  piglets. The DEGs were mapped by R package pathview. The box colour represents the
  different regulations of genes with log FC value (red; upregulation, green; downregulation).
  Pathway data was sourced from the KEGG database41
