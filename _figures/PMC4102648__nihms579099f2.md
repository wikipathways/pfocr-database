caption: Secreted α-MSH from keratinocytes binds MC1R on melanocytes, leading to upregulation
  of cAMP, which stimulates expression of MITF. MITF then transcriptionally activates
  expression of enzymatic machinery including tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein
  1 (Tyrp1), which are critical in the synthesis of melanin within melanosomes. Tyrosinase
  catalyzes the initial conversion of tyrosine to DOPA and dopaquinone. Dopaquinone
  may then combine with cysteine to form the pheomelanin precursor cysteinyldopa,
  or it may enter a separate pathway catalyzed in part by Tyrp1 to produce the eumelanin
  precursor. The matured melanin is then transported in vesicles called melanosomes
  to the overlying epidermal keratinocytes. Strategies such as MC1R activators, adenylate
  cyclase activators, Phosphodiesterase 4D3 inhibitors, and MITF regulators are shown
  to regulate the UV tanning response by targeting different components of this pathway.
