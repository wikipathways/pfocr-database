caption: Effect of prenylation inhibition on receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway.
  Distinct classes of prenylation inhibitors act on different levels of the mevalonate
  pathway. Statins and N-bisphosphonates shut down farnesyl-PP synthesis, leading
  to—besides inhibition of prenylation—depletion of dolichols and cholesterol. Dolichols
  are involved in N-glycolysation that is essential for proper ligand binding of certain
  RTKs, like EGFR. Cholesterol is a major compound of lipid rafts, specific microdomains
  of the plasma membrane functioning as signalization hubs in many major signaling
  pathways (e.g., EGFR and HER2). Prenylation inhibition concerns many major cellular
  process, like proliferation, survival, migration (K-Ras, Rheb Rho), vesicular transport,
  and autophagy (Rab). Interference with this metabolic pathway likely leads to pleiotropic
  effects
