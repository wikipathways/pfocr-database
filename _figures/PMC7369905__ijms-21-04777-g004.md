caption: NRF2 regulates inflammation and immunity. The activation of NRF2 may alter
  the differentiation, expansion, and survival of the immune cells as well as the
  cytokine release. NRF2 activation shifts Th1/Th2 balance in disease models by impairing
  Th1-driven response and skews them towards Th2 differentiation. NRF2-mediated antioxidant
  defense in Treg cells leads to their expansion and survival. Nfe2l2-deficiency leads
  to elevated oxidative damage that exacerbates the differentiation of Th17 cells.
  Nfe2l2 deletion in dendritic cells augments expression of MHC class II and the cells
  surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD86 and CD80 to influence the behavior
  of Th cells. Increased NRF2 expression in leukocytes such as macrophages inhibits
  the expression of pro-inflammatory genes through down-regulation of the NF-κB pathway.
  NRF2 activation in MDSCs regulates metabolism that leads to expansion of suppressive
  MDSCs. However, Nfe2l2-deletion in MDSCs have higher levels of intracellular ROS
  that suppress CTLs proliferation and induces T-cell anergy.
