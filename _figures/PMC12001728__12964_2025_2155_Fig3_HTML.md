caption: The intricate regulatory mechanisms of programmed death 1 in tumor cells.
  (a) Tumor cell-intrinsic PD-1 intracellular signaling. The immunoglobulin-like domain
  of extracellular PD-1 interacts with the immunoglobulin-like extracellular domain
  of PD-L1, trigger downstream signaling pathways, including mTOR signaling, Ras/MAPK
  signaling, AKT/ERK signaling, Hippo signaling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These signaling
  pathways play a crucial role in multiple biological processes, such as proliferation,
  apoptosis, cell cycle progression, EMT, Metastatic spread, generation of mROS, development
  of radio/chemotherapy resistance, and maintenance of cancer stemness. For example,
  the activation of PD-1 signaling in tumor cells can lead to increased phosphorylation
  of downstream molecules in the mTOR pathway, such as ribosomal S6 protein (p-S6).
  This phosphorylation of key molecules within these signaling pathways can have a
  range of effects on the behavior and characteristics of tumor cells, contributing
  to tumor progression, aggressiveness, and resistance to therapeutic interventions.
  (b) Post-translational regulation. One key aspect of post-translational regulation
  highlighted is the role of FBW7 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for the PD-1 protein.
  FBW7 promotes the K48-linked polyubiquitination of PD-1 at the Lys233 residue, marking
  it for degradation by the proteasome. This process is crucial for controlling the
  levels of PD-1 protein in tumor cells. Another important post-translational regulatory
  mechanism involves MDM2, which enhances the association between glycosylated PD-1
  and the glycosidase NGLY1. This interaction facilitates the deglycosylation and
  ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PD-1 by NGLY1. Additionally, the fucosylation
  of specific residues on PD-1 (N49 and N74) mediated by FUT8 is essential for the
  functional localization of PD-1. Loss of core fucosylation has been linked to enhanced
  degradation of PD-1 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. (c) Transcriptional regulation.
  The transcription of PDCD1 is regulated by various transcriptional factors include
  p53, YB-1, NF-κB, CYY61/CTGF and P300/CBP
