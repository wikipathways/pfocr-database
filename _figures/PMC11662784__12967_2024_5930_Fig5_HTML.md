caption: 'The Role of DEAD-Box Helicases in Colorectal Cancer: DDX27: DDX27 promotes
  the gene expression of known CSC markers (CD44, CD133, EpCAM, LGR5), stabilizing
  the self-renewal phenotype of CRC cells and contributing to tumor initiation and
  development. DDX39B: DDX39B protein directly binds to the first exon of CCND1/CDK6
  and upregulates their expression by assisting in their splicing and export, thereby
  promoting the G1/S phase transition in CRC cells and enhancing CRC proliferation.
  DDX39B also binds to the splicing site of FUT3 pre-mRNA, significantly increasing
  the mature FUT3 mRNA. Furthermore, as part of the mRNA export complex (EJC or TREX
  complex), DDX39B binds to the first exon of FUT3 mRNA, promoting its export. High
  expression of FUT3 facilitates the fucosylation of TGFβR-I, activating the TGFβ/SMAD2
  signaling pathway, and upregulating the expression of MMPs and EMT transcription
  factors (Snail, Slug, ZEB1), driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition and advancing
  CRC progression. Additionally, DDX39B directly interacts with the N-terminus of
  PKM2 and enhances its stability by competitively inhibiting Stub1-mediated ubiquitination
  and degradation of PKM2. DDX39B recruits importin α5, forming a complex with PKM2
  and importin α5 to accelerate PKM2 translocation to the nucleus. Nuclear PKM2 then
  functions as a protein kinase and transcriptional co-activator, activating the Warburg
  effect in colorectal cancer, regulating the expression of oncogenes and metabolic
  genes, and promoting tumor progression. DDX46: DDX46 mediates the reduction of apoptosis
  markers caspase-3 and PARP-1, decreasing apoptosis in CRC cells, while promoting
  the G0/G1 phase transition in CRC cells, thereby enhancing cell proliferation. DDX56:
  DDX56 selectively splices the tumor-suppressing gene WEE1, leading to an increase
  in WEE1 mRNA with abnormal intron retention. Conversely, the amount of intronless
  WEE1, a key component of the normal G2-M cell cycle checkpoint, is reduced, diminishing
  its role in preventing mitosis upon DNA damage in cells. This promotes CRC cell
  cycle progression and cell proliferation'
