caption: Regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in the canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling
  pathways. In the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway (blue), active TGF-β is first
  isolated from the latent TGF-β complex in the extracellular space and then binds
  to the TGF-β type II receptor (TGF-βRII), which in turn binds and phosphorylates
  TGF-β type I receptor (ALK5), causing its activation. ALK5 continues to phosphorylate
  intracellular SMAD-2 and SMAD-3 proteins, which constitute a complex with SMAD-4
  and finally accumulate in the nucleus and further regulate fibrosis-related gene
  expression. In addition, the inhibitory function of SMAD-7 competes with SMAD 2/3
  to bind with phosphorylated ALK5, thereby inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway.
  The noncanonical TGF-β signaling pathway (orange) most commonly includes the TGF-β/Smad1/5,
  TGF-β/PI3K/AKT/mTOR, TGF-β/MAPK (ERKs, JNKs, and p38), TGF-β/JAK2/STAT3, and TGF-β/RhoA/ROCK
  signaling pathways. Their functions are also listed in the figure. Numerous miRs
  have been implicated in the regulation of the canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling
  pathways. miRs are grouped to have the direct (solid line) or indirect (dotted line)
  effect as well as the promotion (arrowhead) or inhibition (flathead) effect.
