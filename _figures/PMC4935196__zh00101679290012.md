caption: Role of LRRC8A in cell signaling to apoptosis/cell cycle arrest via the intrinsic,
  volume sensory, and extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Induction of apoptosis and cell
  cycle arrest via the intrinsic cell death pathway is generally elicited by cellular
  stress as DNA damage (adducts and cross-links). Induction of apoptosis by Cisplatin
  involves activation of the kinases ATM/ATR (not shown) and activation/increased
  protein expression of LRRC8A. The dashed line between DNA damage and LRRC8A activation
  indicates that the precise signaling event is unknown. Activation of LRRC8A causes
  cell shrinkage (apoptotic volume decrease), which directly signals to the transcription
  factor p53. Increased stability and activation of p53 increase the gene expression
  of both p21 and Bax. Increased expression of p21 leads to G1/S and G2/M cell cycle-arrest
  through blockage of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and 2 (CDK-1 and -2), and increased
  expression of Bax leads to increased mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization,
  cytochrome c release, activation of Caspase-9, and thus activation of executer caspases
  (e.g., Caspase-3 and -7).
