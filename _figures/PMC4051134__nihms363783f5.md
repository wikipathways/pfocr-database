caption: Signaling through JAK2V617F requires a functional interaction of the kinase
  with a cytokine receptor, such as the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR). Activation
  of the JAK2 target STAT5 is sufficient for increased cell growth (in part through
  Pim1 and Pim2) as well as increased metabolism (indicated by increased glycolytic
  flux or elevated ROS and NADPH levels).
