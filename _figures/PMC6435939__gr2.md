caption: Proposed molecular Wnt signaling pathway in lung fibrosis during ARDS. Wnt
  signaling begins when a Wnt protein binds to a Frizzled family receptor. To facilitate
  Wnt signaling, coreceptors such as lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and
  others may be required. On activation of the receptor, Axin is removed from the
  receptor complex and activates β-catenin. β-Catenin moves into the nucleus, binds
  to a transcription factor on DNA, and activates transcription of target genes. Wnt =
  wingless-related integration site.
