caption: (A) An overview of the oxaloacetate (OAA) cycles and glycine recycling paths
  (along with their overall reactions) that when combined allow conversion of two
  molecules of CO2 into acetyl-CoA. (B). Detailed steps in the OAA cycles and glycine
  recycling pathway. Abbreviations of tetrahydrofolate derived metabolites (10fthf,
  methf, mlthf) are consistent with those used in iJO1366.
