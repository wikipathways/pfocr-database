caption: 'Notch canonical and non-canonical signaling. Notch signaling via the canonical
  pathway is on the left portion of the figure. Membrane-bound Notch receptor is activated
  by binding with ligand on a neighboring cell, which results in cleavage by ADAM
  metalloproteases, followed by cleavage with γ-secretase. These cleavage events release
  the NICD, which then enters the nucleus to affect the gene transcription. The non-canonical
  signaling pathway is on the right portion of the figure and illustrates that non-canonical
  signaling may occur either in the presence or absence of ligand. Further, the signaling
  may occur via the membrane-bound, uncleaved Notch receptor or via the NICD. Non-canonical
  Notch signaling is independent of CSL and allows for interaction with PI3K/AKT/mTORC2,
  Wnt/β-catenin, IKKα/β, NFκB, YY1, and HIF1α pathways at the cytoplasmic and/or nuclear
  level. Abbreviations: ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease; NEXT, Notch extracellular
  truncation; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; Co-R, corepressor; Co-A, coactivator.'
