caption: Immune system and nociceptor activation. (A) Cytokines released in the vicinity
  of the cell body of nociceptors can induce specific receptor activation and signaling
  cascades. Upon activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK)/Janus kinase (JAK), and Smad transcription factors present in the cytoplasm
  are phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus, leading to the expression of
  target genes, resulting in biological responses. Alternatively, downstream modulators
  like protein kinase C (PKC) can sensitize neurons through effects on ion channels
  (e.g., TRPV1 or Na+ channels). (B) In the peripheral terminus, there are additional
  cytokines that signal through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway
  and the AKT/mTOR pathways leading to phosphorylation of eIF4E, which can regulate
  local protein synthesis in the peripheral processes of sensory afferents. It remains
  unknown how these pathways directly intersect with the activities of ion channels.
