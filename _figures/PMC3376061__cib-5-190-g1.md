caption: 'Figure 1. Role of the Orai1-driven Ca2+ entry in T lymphocytes challenged
  with the different forms of CD95L. When exposed to the two forms of CD95L, cleaved
  and membrane-bound, activated T lymphocytes, target cells (infected or transformed
  cells) or bystander cells undergo an Orai1-driven Ca2+ entry that modulates differently
  the CD95-mediated signaling pathway. The Ca2+ traces obtained with cells exposed
  to cleaved-CD95L (1) or membrane-bound CD95L (2) are depicted. MHC: Major Histocompatibility
  Complex.'
