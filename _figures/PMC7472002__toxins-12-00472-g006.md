caption: Scavenging intracellular ROS attenuates PCS triggered osteogenesis through
  pERK signaling pathway and NF-κB activation in HASMC. The exposure to PCS directly
  trigger intracellular ROS, phosphorylation of ERK/p38/pJNK and nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB that drive context-specific gene/protein expression (Runx2 and ALP) in
  HASMC. Notably, intracellular ROS scavenger NAC attenuated pERK MAPK cascade and
  downstream osteogenic differentiation. Thus pERK/NF-κB pathway may act as the key
  signaling transduction in the mechanism of HASMC osteogenesis. In light of this,
  PCS may act as a pro-osteogenic and pro-calcific toxin. From the perspective of
  translation to humans, PCS and intracellular ROS serve as potential therapeutic
  targets for uremic vascular calcification in CKD patients. ALP, alkaline phosphatase;
