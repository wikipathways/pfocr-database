caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of SERPINF1, SHBG and LECT2. (A) IPA investigated
  the molecular pathways of SERPINF1 involved in NAFLD and NASH. All identified pathways
  of SERPINF1 were screened individually. Representative canonical pathways of SERPINF1
  are associated with other related genes and molecules of NAFLD and NASH. Functional
  relationships of these genes, molecules and SERPINF1 are depicted using straight
  lines with arrows. SERPINF1 is functionally related to 1. FXR/RXR signaling; 2.
  NF-κB signaling; 3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus signaling; 4. Hepatic fibrosis signaling;
  5. Adipogenesis signaling; 6. LXR/RXR signaling; 7. PPARα/RXRα signaling and 8.
  AMPK signaling (Right). (B) IPA investigated the molecular pathways of SHBG involved
  in NAFLD and NASH. All identified pathways of SHBG were screened individually (left).
