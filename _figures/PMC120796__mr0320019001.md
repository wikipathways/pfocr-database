caption: Formal genetic model of pH regulation in A. nidulans. PacC is synthesized
  as an inactive form whose activation requires a signal transduced under alkaline
  pH conditions by the pal signaling pathway. The active form of PacC is a transcriptional
  repressor of acid-expressed genes, such as pacA and gabA, and a transcriptional
  activator of alkaline-expressed genes, such as ipnA, prtA, and palD. Mutations inactivating
  pacC (pacC− or pacC+/−) or the pal signaling pathway lead to absence of expression
  of alkaline genes and derepression of acidic genes, which results in acidity mimicry.
  Gain-of-function pacCc mutations bypassing the pal signaling pathway (i.e., leading
  to active PacC at any ambient pH) result in permanent activation of alkaline genes
  and superrepression of acidic genes, which leads to alkalinity mimicry.
