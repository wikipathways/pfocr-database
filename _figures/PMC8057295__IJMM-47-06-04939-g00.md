caption: Overview of the SHH pathway in the (A) absence or (B) presence of the SHH
  ligand. Negative signaling regulators are presented in red and positive regulators
  in green. Transmembrane proteins are shown as rods or trails, SHH pathway elements
  and proteins forming complexes with them as ovals, kinases as rectangles and proteolytic
  proteins as hexagons. Yellow rectangles represent drugs inhibiting/blocking the
  specific cellular components. Activated proteins are surrounded by red borders.
