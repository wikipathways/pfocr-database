caption: The signaling pathway of NOD1. NOD1 specifically recognizes the peptidoglycan
  fragment iE-DAP in pathogens. In addition to peptidoglycan, NOD1 has also been reported
  to be activated by parasite, certain viruses, and danger signals. Activated NOD1
  undergoes self-oligomerization and recruits downstream effector proteins. NOD1 recruits
  RIP2, which undergoes multiple ubiquitination and phosphorylation to mediate downstream
  activation of the NF-KB and MAPK pathways. In epithelial cells, this pathway mediates
  type 1 IFN signaling. Additionally, ATG16L1 and Caspase-1 have been reported to
  be activated through NOD1 recruitment, promoting apoptosis and inflammation respectively.
