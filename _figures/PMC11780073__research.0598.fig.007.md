caption: Proposed mechanism of astrocyte-derived IL11 mediating astrocyte–microglia
  crosstalk via the NF-κB signaling pathway in SAE. In SAE, decreased astrocyte-derived
  IL11 results in microglial activation with enhanced M1 polarization and increased
  migration, which is medicated by the NF-κB signaling pathway. Astrocyte-derived
  IL11 decreases, which causes the activation of the IKK complex and degradation of
  IκBα. This results in the translocation of the NF-κB complex (p50, p65) into the
  nucleus, triggering gene expression changes associated with inflammation, including
  microglia polarization and migration-related genes, while IL11 administration can
  inhibit the microglial activation caused by the decrease of astrocyte-derived IL11
  and ameliorate the neuronal injury in SAE
