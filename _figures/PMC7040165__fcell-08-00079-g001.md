caption: Extrinsic signaling pathways governing stemness of pluripotent stem cells.
  Pluripotency and self-renewal characteristics of stem cells modulated by positive
  or negative regulation of SOX2, NANOG, and OCT3/4 by various signaling pathways
  in the nucleus of both mouse and human. (A) Mouse naïve pluripotency mainly controlled
  by LIF/STAT3, BMP4, Wnt/β-Catenin, and FGF4/ERK signaling pathways. LIF maintains
  pluripotency through binding to its receptor, gp130/LIFR, followed by activation
  of JAK/STAT3. Phosphorylated STAT3 interacts with KLF4 and maintains the pluripotency
  through OCT3/4. BMP4/SMAD signaling controls core transcriptional TFs through interaction
  with KLF4. FGF4/ERK signaling promotes differentiation of mESCs through JNK/c-JUN
  and MEK/ERK pathways as downstream regulators. (B) Primed state of pluripotency
  in mEpiSCs, hESC, and hiPSCs is mainly controlled by FGF2/ERK and TGFβ/Activin/Nodal
  pathways. FGF2 acts through PI3K/AKT, PLCγ and MEK/ERK. TGF/SMAD pathway directly
  controls pluripotency through interaction with NANOG. IGF2 binding to IGF1R activates
  PI3K/AKT pathway and regulates stemness by interaction with SOX2. Inhibitors and
  activators of signaling pathways showed by red blunt-headed and dark blue arrows,
  respectively.
