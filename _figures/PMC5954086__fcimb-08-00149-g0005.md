caption: Proposed pathogenesis model of Kyasanur Forest Disease. Virus enters (1)
  in body on tick bite or through contact with an infected animal. Virus initially
  targets macrophages and dendritic cells. Multiplication of virus (2) in these host
  cells yields high viremia, leading to systemic spread of the virus to spleen, liver,
  and other replication sites to produce disease symptoms. The infected antigen presenting
  cells (APCs), that present viral antigens to T cells, could release large amounts
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines early after infection and also modulate host immune
  response (3) via type 1 interferon production. Antigen positive (activated) T cells
  could also produce IFN-1. Subsequent activation of the JAK-STAT signaling induces
  an antiviral state for alleviating virus burden. Humoral immune response via production
  of antibodies by activated B cells might also assist in viral clearance from the
  body. To counter the host immune response, KFDV employs its NS5 non-structural protein
  to antagonize IFN response (4) by inhibiting JAK-STAT pathway, possibly bringing
  about uncontrolled viral replication and poor immune response. The multi-systemic
  illness might be attributed to the pro-inflammatory cytokine storm that could contribute
  to immunosuppression and disease progression (5) by inducing disseminated intravascular
  coagulation (DIC), neurological complications and vascular dysfunction that leads
  to hemorrhagic manifestations, multi-organ failure and shock. These complications
  altogether finally result in death.
