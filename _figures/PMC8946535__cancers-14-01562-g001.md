caption: Pivotal signaling pathways in lymphoproliferative diseases. On the left side,
  TLR signaling is shown. Upon recognition of PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns) by TLR (toll-like receptors), MYD88 is recruited to the cell membrane,
  binds the serine-threonine kinase IRAK proteins (IL-1R associated kinase), TRAF
  (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor) and TAK1 (transforming growth
  factor beta-activated kinase 1) [], which activate the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein
  kinase) cascade and IKK (inhibitor of the NF-κB kinase). IKK complex is made up
  of IKKα and IKKβ, with kinasic activity, and the regulatory IKKγ subunit. Once activated,
  IKK phosphorylates IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB), leading to its ubiquitylation and proteasomal
  degradation, thereby, the release of the NF-κB (RELA p65–p50 in the classical pathway
  and RELB-p52 in the alternative pathway). Then, NF-κB subunits translocate into
  the nucleus and modulate the proliferation and survival of B lymphocytes []. In
  the middle is shown the BCR signaling. After antigen binding to the B-cell receptor
  (BCR), the Src kinase LYN is activated, phosphorylating CD79A/B and recruiting SYK
  (spleen tyrosine kinase) []. LYN and SYK activate by phosphorylation BTK [], and,
  subsequently, the phospholipase PLCγ2, activating NF-kB pathway, MAPK and PI3K pathways.
  On the right is shown the CXCR4 signaling. After binding of CXCL12 to the seven
  domains trans-membrane CXCR4 receptor coupled with trimeric G protein, the Gα subunit
  dissociates from the Gβ/Gγ dimer and inhibits adenyl cyclase (AC), causing the reduction
  of intracellular cAMP (cyclic AMP) levels and switching off PKA (protein kinase
  A). Meanwhile, the Gβ/Gγ dimer actives PI3K, modulating lymphocytes migration, and
  phospholipase PLC, which acts on PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) releasing
  IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate), favoring the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular
  stores, and diacylglycerol, promoting the activation of PKC (protein kinase C) and
  MAPK cascade [].
