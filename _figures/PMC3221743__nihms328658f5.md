caption: Working model describing how in HIV+ macrophages constitutively activated
  PI3K elicits blunting of lipid A-induced increases in TNFα release through sustained
  mTOR activation. PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway is constitutively active in HIV+
  macrophages and inhibits the expression of TNFα by 1) direct mTOR-dependent inhibition
  of MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. 2) IL-10 production through the activation
  of mTOR. 3) destabilization a pan specific MAP kinase phosphatase,(MKP-1) expression
  through declines in its phosphorylation status, Inhibition of MKP-1 elicited negative
  feedback on ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation prolongs ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 activation
  by declines in its dephosphorylation.
