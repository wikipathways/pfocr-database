caption: 'In the case of the canonical TGF–β signaling pathway, this results in the
  activation of SMAD family transcription factors SMAD–2 and –3 which, upon phosphorylation,
  form complexes with SMAD–4 and translocate to the nucleus, where they act in transcriptional
  complexes as regulators of pro–fibrotic down–stream genes []. In our assay, TGF–β1
  signaling involved ALK5 and SMAD3, but also all three mitogen–activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathways: e,g, the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), p38
  MAPK, and c–Jun–N–terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. In addition, TGF–β1 effect was
  mediated by PI3 kinase / Akt and Rho GTPase pathways. Binding of alprostadil to
  the G–protein coupled receptors EP2 and EP4, which are linked to G–αs proteins,
  induced the adenylate cyclase–mediated cAMP second messenger formation from ATP.
  It is well established that cAMP acts by activating protein kinase A (PKA) [, ],
  resulting in dissociation of the regulatory (R) and the catalytic (C) subunits of
  the kinase. The catalytic subunits translocate to the nucleus and initiate the activation
  of the cAMP response element binding (CREB) transcription factor, and, as a consequence,
  transcription of downstream genes. Cardiac glycosides concentration–dependently
  increased the intracellular [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio, which led to an increase in COX2
  expression and PKA activation and decreased α–SMA, COL1 and FN []. To which extent
  this effect was mediated by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration through
  activation of the reverse mode of an Na+/Ca2+ exchanger warrants further clarification.'
