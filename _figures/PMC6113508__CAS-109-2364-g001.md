caption: Biogenesis of exosomes. First, endocytosis could be mediated by either a
  clathrin‐dependent pathway or a clathrin‐independent pathway, which often actively
  occurs at the lipid raft containing a variety of tumor‐specific receptors and signaling
  proteins (eg, growth factor receptors, oncoproteins) in addition to common membrane
  proteins, such as tetraspanins (eg, CD9, CD63, CD81), MHC I and II, and adhesion
  molecules (eg, integrins, cadherins). Using the endosomal network, the biogenesis
  of exosomes is achieved in an endosomal sorting complexes required for transport
  (ESCRT)‐dependent or ESCRT‐independent method. Accordingly, intraluminal vesicles
  (exosomes) show inward budding of the multivesicular bodies (MVB). Indeed, numerous
  cytoplasmic (eg, ubiquitin‐related proteins, heat shock proteins, microRNAs [miRNAs],
  mRNAs, cytoskeleton proteins etc.) and nuclear molecules (eg, transcriptional factors,
  longnoncoding RNAs [lncRNAs], DNAs etc.) can be selectively loaded into MVB in a
  cancer type‐specific and/or stage‐specific way. Furthermore, multivesicular bodies
  are fused with the plasma membrane, leading to the release of exosomes toward the
  extracellular space in an exocytic way. Several Rab GTPases, including Rab11/35,
  Rab7, and Rab27, have been reported to be involved in exosome secretion. Finally,
  tumor‐derived exosomes are transferred to the local tumor microenvironment and distinct
  organs to regulate tumorigenesis or metastasis, respectively. rER, rough endoplasmic
  reticulum; sER, smooth endoplasmic reticulum
