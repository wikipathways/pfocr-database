caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanisms of bioactive materials and cytokines
  in regulating inflammation and maintaining pulp equilibrium through various signaling
  pathways involving the nucleus [70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78]. The illustration shows
  how signaling pathways control gene expression through transcription factors, affecting
  inflammation, cell growth, death, and matrix formation in endodontitis. (A) The
  Notch signaling pathway can be activated by MTA, IL-1β, and IL-6. The Notch receptor
  binds to ligands (e.g., Delta and Jagged) and releases Notch intracellular structural
  domains (NICDs) in the cytoplasm via ADAM/TACE-mediated ligand shearing. The NICDs
  then bind to transcription complexes in the nucleus, thereby regulating gene expression.
  The Notch signaling pathway regulates the inflammatory response, influences multiple
  pathway interactions, and modulates cell differentiation and apoptosis. (B) MAPK
  signaling pathway can be activated by Biodentine, MTA, iRoot BP Plus, Zn, Mg, Ag,
  complement C3a, C5a fragments, and various cytokines. Activation of the pathway
  is initiated by MAP3K, MAP2K, and MAPK family members (e.g., ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3, p38)
  via progressive signaling by kinases such as leucine-zipper and sterile-α motif
  kinase (LZK), Apoptosis Signal Regulating Kinase 1 (ASK1), Transforming Growth Factor-β-Activated
  Kinase 1-v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (TAK1-B-Raf), and others.
  The MAPK pathway promotes inflammatory processes, modulates extracellular matrix
  formation, regulates angiogenesis, and controls apoptosis. (C) The NF-κB signaling
  pathway can be activated by MTA, Zn, IL-1β, and IL-6. Upon activation, IκB is degraded,
  releasing NF-κB subunits (e.g., p65/p50), which promote the transcription of target
  genes upon transfer to the nucleus. This pathway exerts robust pro-inflammatory
  effects, regulates extracellular matrix formation and angiogenesis, mediates cell
  proliferation and necrosis, and modulates the immune response. (D) The WNT signaling
  pathway can be activated by MTA, Li, Zn, and IL-1β. WNT proteins bind to Frizzled
  and LRP receptors, inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) activity and
  preventing the degradation of β-catenin, which accumulates and translocates to the
  nucleus. WNT regulates inflammatory responses, promotes angiogenesis, and modulates
  cell proliferation and differentiation. (E) The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway can be
  activated by MTA, Biodentine, iRoot BP Plus, Sr, and IL-6. Upon triggering, PI3K
  activates and generates PIP3, which, in turn, activates downstream AKT and mTOR
  signaling molecules. The PI3K/AKT pathway plays a role in anti-inflammatory processes
  by regulating apoptosis and proliferation and also promotes angiogenesis, cellular
  proliferation, and differentiation through interactions with other pathways
