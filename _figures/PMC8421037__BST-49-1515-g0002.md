caption: Cell migration requires the coordination of various plasma membrane components
  that link extracellular matrix to the cell cytoskeleton. (A) YAP/TAZ influence the
  dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton through the expression of Rho GTPase-activating
  proteins (ARHGAP18, ARHGAP29) and Rho guanine exchange factor (ARHGEF17), which
  in turn modulates RhoA activity. (B) LAT1/CD98 is a disulfide-linked heterodimer
  composed of SLC3A2 and SLC7A5 that promotes cell migration and survival by coupling
  nutrient availability and integrin activity. LAT1/CD98 exports glutamine in exchange
  of importing amino acids, such as leucine, isoleucine and arginine. SLC3A2 of the
  LAT1/CD98 heterodimer binds integrins and amplifies integrin-mediated signalling.
  (C) At the leading edge of the cell, activation of integrin receptors through binding
  of extracellular matrix (ECM) components promotes focal adhesion complex assembly
  and the contractile forces generated by the actin cytoskeleton enables movement
  of the cell. (D) Plasma membrane subdomain caveolae expression is regulated by YAP/TAZ
  and plays a mechanoprotective role by flattening in response to mechanical forces,
  such as cellular stretching and osmotic swelling. In migrating cells, caveolae frequently
  localise to the rear due to low membrane tension. (E) YAP/TAZ-TEAD-mediated transcriptional
  activity promotes the production of matricellular proteins, such as CYR61 and CTGF.
  These signalling factors promote cell adhesion, migration and proliferation.
