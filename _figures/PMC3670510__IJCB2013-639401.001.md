caption: 'Targetable metabolic actors by natural compounds. A summary of the most
  relevant compounds affecting metabolic pathways of cancer cells. Many of these molecules
  correspond to natural compounds; alternatively, they are chemical structures found
  as active that may act as a template for the identification of promising natural
  compounds with similar activity. Molecules indicated in blue affect enzymatic activity
  (+ or − stands for activators or inhibitors, resp.); the ones in green affect the
  expression level of the targeted enzyme; the ones in brown affect nonmetabolic activities.
  Abbreviations: ATP citrate lyase, ACL; gallocatechin gallate, GCG; epigallocatechin
  gallate (EGCG); fatty acid synthase, FAS; fructose-6-phosphate, F6P; fructose-1,6-biphosphate,
  FBP; hypoxia-inducible factor 1, HIF-1; glucose-6-phosphate, G6P; glutamine synthetase,
  GS; hexokinase II, HK2; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, G3P; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, GAPDH; glucose transporter, GLUT; glutamate dehydrogenase, GDH; α-ketoglutarate
