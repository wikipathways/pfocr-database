caption: 'The GGIN identified by IPA software. The input was the list of 23 mTOR-related
  genes described in . Imported gene identifiers were mapped to corresponding gene
  objects and overlaid onto the global molecular network identified by the IPA algorithm.
  Edge relationship and node type symbols illustrate the nature of the relationship
  among genes, considering the functionality of each gene supplied. Solid lines: direct
  interaction. Dashed lines: indirect interaction. Shaded nodes: the genes present
  in the input list. Empty nodes: the genes inserted after high confident prediction
  by the IPA algorithm. Fold changes and changes in expression pattern were calculated
  based on A151 treatment.'
