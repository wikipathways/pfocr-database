caption: FXR signaling in diabetic nephropathy. In the DKD mouse model and high-glucose-stimulated
  tubular epithelial cells, the expression of FXR and its target genes is decreased
  while the expression levels of SREBP-1 and fatty acid synthase (FAS) are elevated.
  This results in an increased accumulation of triglycerides, cholesterol, and fatty
  acids, along with reduced oxidation. Additionally, there is an increase in the expression
  of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins, leading to the promotion of caspase-12
  expression and exacerbating cell apoptosis and oxidative stress. Furthermore, this
  process activates the β-catenin/TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway, intensifying the inflammatory
  response
