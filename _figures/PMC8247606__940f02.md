caption: Metabolic mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in PDA. (A) Cell-autonomous
  mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. PDAC cells enhance the production of nucleic
  acids from glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to promote resistance
  to gemcitabine. Macropinocytosis and autophagy provide nutrients (e.g. Fe2+, amino
  acids) to support biosynthesis and survival. Autophagy also removes MHC-I from the
  cell surface to impair recognition by the antitumor immune system. Malic enzyme
  1 (ME1)-derived NADPH and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)
  pathway promote resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS). NRF2 is transcriptionally
  activated by mutant KRAS and post-translationally stabilized by the ataxia-telangiectasia
  group D-associated protein (ATDC)-mediated binding and inhibition of Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). (B) Tumor microenvironment-mediated mechanisms
  of therapeutic resistance. Deoxycytidine (dC) derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promotes resistance to gemcitabine.
  Pyruvate derived from CAFs and circulating asparagine (Asn) promote resistance to
  mitochondrial inhibitors.
