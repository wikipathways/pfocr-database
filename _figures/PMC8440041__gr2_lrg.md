caption: DRUGS TARGETING POTENTIAL SIGNALLING PATHWAYS REGULATING MUCIN SYNTHESIS,
  MUCUS SECRETION AND MUCOCILIARY CLEARANCE. The flowchart represents the various
  pathways that can be targeted to decrease mucus accumulation in the airway and reduce
  mortality in COVID-19 patients. Mucus hypersecretion may occur due to increased
  mucin synthesis. Aberrant expression of mucin synthesizing genes and mucus hypersecretionoccur
  as a result of cytokine storm in the hyperinflammatory phase of COVID-19 infection.
  This will further lead to the activation of various signallings such as IDO dependent
  KYN AhRsignalling pathway and EGFRmediated MAPK pathway. This flowchart represents
  important signalling pathways involved in mucus production and suggests the drugs
  targeting various signalling molecule, which helps to modulate mucus hypersecretion
  in COVID-19 patients.
