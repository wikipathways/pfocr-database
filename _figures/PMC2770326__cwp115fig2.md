caption: Overview of mammalian sialic acid metabolism. (A) The hexosamine pathway
  converts glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6P) into the nucleotide sugar UDP-GlcNAc,
  which in turn is converted into ManNAc by GNE (pathway details are provided elsewhere
  (Hanover )). (B) ManNAc is the dedicated metabolic precursor for the sialic acid
  biosynthetic pathway that produces Neu5Ac in the cytosol and then enters the nucleus
  where CMP-Neu5Ac is synthesized (in most nonhuman species, a proportion of CMP-Neu5Ac
  is converted to CMP-Neu5Gc). (C) These two nucleotide sugars are transported into
  lumen of the Golgi where they are used by several sialyltransferases (up to 20 in
  human cells, dependent on cell- and tissue-dependent expression patterns) to produce
  α2,3-, α2,6-, or α2,8-linked sialoglycoproteins or gangliosides. (D) Finally, sialosides
  are recycled by one of four neuraminidases, thereby regenerating sialic acid monomers
  that can be re-used by a cell. The full names of enzymes are given in Table S1 available
  online in the Supplementary Data.
