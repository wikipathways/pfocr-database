caption: Overview of the shikimate pathway leading to the synthesis of phenolic acid
  compounds, including soluble (or hydrolysable) tannins, phenylpropanoids and phenylalanine-derived
  volatiles. Main classes of phenylpropanoids are shown in yellow. Primary pathways
  are indicated in blue, while secondary pathways are in red. Enzymes involved in
  the accumulation of primary metabolite precursors and possible targets for metabolic
  engineering are indicated in bold. Transcription factors involved in the regulation
  of carbon flux toward phenylpropanoid synthesis are shown in green (ODO1 from Petunia
  and MYB12 from Arabidopsis), and are located next to the pathways they controlled.
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; DHAPS, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase;
  AroG, bacterial feedback insensitive DAHPS; PheA, bacterial feedback insensitive
  chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydratase; AADC, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase;
  ArAT, aromatic amino acid aminotransferase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase.
