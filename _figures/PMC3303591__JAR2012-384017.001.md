caption: Stimulation of PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway after activation of IR/IGF-1R
  mediates insulin neuroprotection against damaging conditions. For example, insulin
  administration under oxidative stress phosphorylates IR and/or IGF-1R, which in
  turn activate the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway, regulating the expression of “candidate”
  proteins, namely, glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), hexokinase-II (Hxk-II), and
  also the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and the proapoptotic caspase-3. Thus, oxidative stress,
  impaired glucose metabolism and, neuronal apoptosis are counterbalanced. Insulin
  also interferes with GSK-3β signaling, decreasing its activated form and inhibiting
  apoptotic neuronal death under oxidized conditions.
