caption: Acylglucose biosynthetic pathway. Fatty acids are activated by means of UDPglucose-dependent
  transglucosylation to form the high-energy acyl donor molecule, 1-O-acyl-β-glucose.
  Two equivalents of the activated 1-O-acyl-β-glucose intermediate then undergo enzyme-catalyzed
  disproportionation to form 1,2-substituted diacylglucose and glucose. In this figure,
  isobutyrate represents the acyl group; however, branched and straight short (C4–C5)
  to medium (C10–C12) chain fatty acids are used in acylglucose biosynthesis and are
  activated by chain length-specific UDPglucose:fatty acid transglucosylases.
papertitle: An acyltransferase catalyzing the formation of diacylglucose is a serine
  carboxypeptidase-like protein.
