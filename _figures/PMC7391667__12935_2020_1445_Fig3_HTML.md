caption: 'Direct pathway of m6A to regulate transcriptome a Two possible mechanisms
  of eIF3 regulating mRNA translation initiation. ①: m6A directly promotes the recruitment
  of eIF3 and then induce translation initiation. ②: m6A delivers eIF3 to the 5′UTR
  through METTL3–eIF3h mediated mRNA circularization and induce translation initiation.
  b Approach of YTH-domain proteins(except YTHDC1) regulating mRNA stability and metabolism.
  ③: YTHDC1 reads MAT2A m6A, which induces SAM-mediated MAT2A mRNA degradation. ④ → ⑤/⑥:
  YTHDC2 binds m6A and unpacks the target m6A-mRNA to enhance the translation efficiency
  and degradation. ⑦: YTHDF1 binds to the m6A site surrounding the stop codon, then
  cooperates with the translation initiation machinery to enhance the translation
  efficiency of target RNAs. ⑧: YTHDF2 accelerates the degradation of m6A-modified
  RNA by directly recruiting CCR4-NOT deadenylase complexes. ⑨⑩: YTHDF3 can accelerate
  the degradation of mRNA by directly interacting with YTHDF2 while Prcc2a can decelerate
  this degradation. ⑪: YTHDF3 can synergize with YTHDF1 to promote the translation
  of m6A-RNA'
