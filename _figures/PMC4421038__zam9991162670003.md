caption: Proposed HA biosynthetic pathway in S. albulus. The pathway is based on the
  reported pathway in streptococci (). To constitute the entire HA pathway in S. albulus,
  the refactored hyaluronic acid synthase (hasAm) was coexpressed with UDP-glucose
  dehydrogenase (UdgA), UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (GlmU), and UDP-glucose
  pyrophosphorylase (GtaB) from S. avermitilis, which are homologous to HasB, HasD,
  and HasC in streptococci, respectively.
