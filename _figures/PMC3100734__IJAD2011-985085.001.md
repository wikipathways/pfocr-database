caption: 'Induction of the Nrf2-ARE pathway under normal and pathological conditions:
  potential role of GSK-3β as a negative regulator of Nrf2. (a) In normal conditions,
  actin-associated Keap1 sequesters Nrf2 in the cytosol and targets it for degradation.
  (b) Endogenously and exogenously generated ROS alter the interaction between Nrf2
  and its repressor, resulting in the accumulation of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. Nrf2
  translocates into the nucleus. (c) An abundance of Nrf2 in the nucleus results in
  the binding of Nrf2 to the ARE and the increased expression of protective, Nrf2-controlled
  genes. (d) In conditions of prolonged oxidative stress, GSK-3β is activated. (e)
  Activated GSK-3β phosphorylates Fyn, causing nuclear translocation. (f) Nuclear
  Fyn phosphorylates Nrf2, leading to nuclear export of Nrf2 and degradation in the
  cytosol.'
