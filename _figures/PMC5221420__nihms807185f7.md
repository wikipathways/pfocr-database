caption: Microglandular adenosis, atypical microglandular adenosis and acinic cell
  carcinoma likely constitute a low-grade triple-negative breast neoplasia family
  (middle pathway), characterized by recurrent TP53 mutations, 5q losses and 8q gains,
  and high levels of genetic instability, hallmark features of conventional high-grade
  triple-negative breast cancers (top pathway). Despite the lack of a myoepithelial
  cell layer, microglandular adenosis and atypical microglandular adenosis are not
  considered invasive lesions; therefore the progression from ductal carcinoma in
  situ to microglandular adenosis/atypical microglandular adenosis remains hypothetical
  as indicated by the dashed lines. Nevertheless, evidence favoring clonal relatedness
  between ductal carcinoma in situ and microglandular adenosis/atypical microglandular
  adenosis has been documented (, ). A second group of low-grade triple-negative neoplasms
  of the breast is underpinned by specific/pathognomonic genetic alterations, display
  low to intermediate levels of genetic instability and can be broadly categorized
  as salivary gland-like tumors of the breast, encompassing, most likely among others,
  secretory and adenoid cystic carcinomas. These special histologic types of triple-negative
  breast cancer are underpinned by ETV6-NTRK3 and MYB-NFIB fusion genes, respectively.
  *In their salivary gland counterparts, distinct genetic alterations but with likely
  similar functional effect have been described, such as MYBL1-NFIB fusion gene in
  adenoid cystic carcinomas () and ETV6 rearrangements with an unknown partner (ETV6-X)
  in mammary-analogue secretory carcinomas (), which theoretically also occur in the
  breast lesions. ACC, acinic cell carcinoma; AMGA, atypical microglandular adenosis;
  MGA, microglandular adenosis; TN, triple-negative; TNBC, triple-negative breast
  cancer. Solid lines, associations between lesions supported by molecular evidence;
  dashed line, hypothetical evolutionary associations.
