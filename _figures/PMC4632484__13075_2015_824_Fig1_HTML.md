caption: NF-κB pathway activation in a RA synovial fibroblast cell. Proinflammatory
  cytokines, including IL-1β, activate the cell signaling pathway associated with
  NF-κB, including activation of IκK, phosphorylation and inactivation of Iκβ, and
  translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. NF-κB decoy ODNs can prevent translocation
  of the transcription factor, as well as subsequent transcription of NF-κB-dependent
  genes. IκB inhibitor of NF-κB, IL interleukin, NF-κB nuclear factor kappa-light
  chain enhancer of activated B cells

  coated polysaccharide based nanoparticles in rheumatoid arthritis in vitro models.
