caption: The overall molecular mechanisms of cisplatin cytotoxicity in APL cells involve
  many steps. In brief, cisplatin enters into the cell and interacts with DNA to form
  DNA adduct and also inhibits DNA synthesis. It produces ROS and creates oxidative
  stress inside the cell. DNA adduct formation and oxidative stress in APL cells cause
  the activation of p53 signaling and AP-1 phosphorylation leading to a change in
  mitochondrial membrane potential and cell cycle arrest in cells. This leads to cytochrome
  C release from the mitochondria, which activates caspase 9 and a series of complexes
  leading to activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis. Cisplatin cytotoxicity also modulates
  MAPK signaling pathway and overall leads to cancer cell death [].
