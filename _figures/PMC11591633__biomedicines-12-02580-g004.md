caption: 'Physiological stimuli that modulate NCC activity. The key signaling pathways
  involved in NCC regulation by various hormones are illustrated. Arginine vasopressin
  (AVP, blue) binds to the V2 receptor (V2R) on the basolateral membrane, activating
  adenylate cyclase 6 (AC6), which increases cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Elevated cAMP
  stimulates protein kinase A (PKA), leading to: (a) stimulation of WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC
  cascade through WNK kinase phosphorylation; (b) inhibition of protein phosphatase
  1 (PP1) by phosphorylating its inhibitor, I-1, maintaining the phosphorylated state
  of the NCC; (c) phosphorylation and inactivation of Kelch-like protein 3 (KLHL3),
  diminishing WNK ubiquitination and consequent degradation. Aldosterone (ALDO, orange)
  enhances the NCC in both a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-dependent and MR-independent
  manner. Binding to MR, it could stimulate serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase
  1 (SGK1), which activates WNKs and simultaneously inhibits NEDD4-2-mediated ubiquitination.
  On the other hand, aldosterone stimulates ENaC-mediated potassium secretion, eventually
  inducing hypokalemia. Low extracellular K+ levels are sensed by DCT cells through
  Kir4.1/Kir5.1 K+ channels, which, once active, lead to a drop in K+ intracellular
  concentration, stimulating basolateral Cl− transport through ClC-Kb. A decrease
  in intracellular Cl− levels releases the inhibition of WNK kinases, enabling their
  autophosphorylation and thus stimulating WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC pathway. Cortisol (CORT,
  red) may exert the same effect as aldosterone, likely through the interaction with
  the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Angiotensin II (ANGII, purple) binds to the angiotensin
  II type 1 receptor (AT1R), activating protein kinase C (PKC), which catalyzes both
  WNK and KLHL3 phosphorylation. Angiotensin II activates the NCC via AngII receptor
  type 1 (AT1R), stimulating the WNK4-SPAK kinase cascade and the phosphorylation
  of KLHL. Angiotensin II can also induce aldosterone and ENaC-mediated hypokalemia,
  thereby triggering potassium sensing through Kir4.1/Kir5.1 K+ channels. Insulin
  (INS, green) activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, leading to
  the activation of protein kinase B (AKT). AKT stimulates NCC activity through the
  phosphorylation of both WNK kinases and KLHL3. Figure created in BioRender.com [6]'
