caption: 'The Non-canonical NF-κB pathway and its regulation: The non-canonical signaling
  pathway may be initiated through the binding of a variety of exogenous ligands to
  their cognate receptors (top right). This ligand receptor interaction leads to the
  recruitment of TRAF2, TRAF3 and cIAP1/2, forming a complex, which allows for the
  release and phosphorylation of NIK. Phospho-NIK is able to in turn phosphorylate
  IKKα, which leads to the ubiquitination of the p100/RelB complex and p52 production.
  P52 subsequently translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription. This cascade
  may be positively regulated (left) or negatively regulated (right) by a variety
  of intracellular proteins'
