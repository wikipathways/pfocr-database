caption: Drosophila Toll pathway. Drosophila Toll pathway is a cytokine receptor pathway
  that responds indirectly to microbial infection. Distinct circulating receptor proteins
  recognize different microbial structures or activities and activate a protease cascade,
  which culminates in the processing of Spätzle. Lys-type PGN, from bacterial cell
  walls, is recognized by PGRP-SA/PGRP-SD and GNBP1, while GNBP3 detects β-(1, 3)-glucan
  from fungal cell walls. These upstream recognition events trigger a proteolytic
  cascade which proceeds through the serine proteases ModSP and Grass to activate
  Spätzle Processing Enzyme (SPE) which in turn cleaves pro-Spätzle to release the
  mature Toll ligand, Spätzle. In addition, virulence-associated proteases, released
  by pathogens, cleave and activate another pathway that requires the protease Persephone
  and converges on the activation of SPE. The intracellular Toll signaling pathway
  is very homologous to the mammalian MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. It signals
  through an upstream complex containing the adaptor proteins dMyD88, Tube and the
  kinase Pelle (an IRAK homolog). Pelle triggers the phosphorylation, K48-ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation of the IκB protein, Cactus, thereby releasing the Drosophila
  NF-κB/Rel factors DIF/Dorsal to translocate into the nucleus and transcribe target
  AMP genes, such as Drosomycin
