caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was conducted to identify the top canonical
  signaling pathways affected in male and female offspring born to GRP or SIR mothers
  with or without concomitant FLX treatment. Orange color = positive activation Z-score
  (pathways) and increased expression (individual genes), blue color = negative activation
  Z-score (pathways) and reduced expression (individual genes). For IPA-generated
  overview of the main biological themes, the most significant entities (canonical
  pathways, upstream regulators, biological functions and molecules) are shown, with
  connecting lines representing specific relationships (solid lines represent a direct
  relationship, slashed lines an indirect relationship and dotted lines and inferred
  relationship). Arrows represent directionality and activation, while blunt-ended
  lines represent inhibition. a Top 5 canonical pathways annotated with DEGs in SIR-VEH
