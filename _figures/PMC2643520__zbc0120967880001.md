caption: Proposed functions of thioesterase II proteins. A, chain  elongation by a
  PKS module. The chain elongation intermediate is transferred  from the ACP of the
  upstream module to the ketosynthase (KS) domain.  The acyltransferase (AT) domain
  transfers an acyl group building  block from CoA to the ACP within the module. The
  KS domain catalyzes  condensation of the new building block with the intermediate,
  releasing  CO2. B, production of a decarboxylated acyl unit by the  ketosynthase
  domain and the subsequent hydrolysis by a TEII. C,  mispriming of a PKS by transfer
  of an acyl-phosphopantetheine arm by a  promiscuous phosphopantetheinyl transferase
  (Pptase) and the  subsequent hydrolysis by a TEII. D, hydrolysis of an amino acid  derivative
  by a TEII from an NRPS module comprising an adenylation domain  (A) and a peptide
  carrier protein (PCP) domain.
