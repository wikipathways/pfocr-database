caption: The role of mouse LrNK cells in other liver diseases (except for liver viral
  infection and liver cancer). a. In liver injury, the release and increase of DNAM-1
  ligand, IL-7, IL-12, ATP could stimulate mouse LrNK cells to secrete IFN-γ, which
  protected hepatocytes from apoptosis by upregulating Bcl-xL. b. And the cGAS-STING
  signaling pathway within cDC1s was also activated and cDC1s secrete IL-12, which
  could promote the secretion of IFN-γ by mouse LrNK cells. c. In alcoholic liver
  injury, mouse LrNK cells were stimulated to secrete IL-17A and exacerbated liver
  injury. While the cNK cells could secrete IFN-γ, which inhibited the activation
  of mouse LrNK cells. d. In liver fibrosis, γδT cells could activate mouse LrNK cells
  via the CD137L-CD137 axis to kill HSCs. So, the liver fibrosis improved. e. In portal
  vein hypertension, increased IL-33 could activate the Akt-FoxO and MAPK signaling
  pathways within mouse LrNK cells and decreased the expression of TRAIL on mouse
  LrNK cells. Thereby, the anti-tumor activity of mouse LrNK cells was diminished.
  f. In the mouse model of islet transplantation, the IBMIR-induced TNF-α could activate
  mouse LrNK cells to kill grafted islet by CXCR3-CXCL10 and TRAIL-TRAIL DR5 axes.
  g. In PBC, the CD4+ T cells were inhibited by mouse LrNK cells, which improve the
  immune injury. h. Partial hepatectomy could decrease the expression of TRAIL on
  mouse LrNK cells and attenuate the anti-tumor activity. Meanwhile, FICZ, the AhR
  agonist, could activate the AhR-FoxO1 within mouse LrNK cells, increased the expression
  of TRAIL and anti-tumor activity. i. In obesity, the mouse LrNK cells could secrete
  OPN, which promoted hepatic ER stress and IR. Abbreviations: LrNK cells liver-resident
  natural killer cells, DNAM-1 DNAX accessory molecule-1, IL interleukin, ATP adenosine
  triphosphate, IFN-γ interferon-γ, cGAS cyclic GMP-AMP, STING stimulator of interferon
