caption: 'Schemes of metabolite 13C labeling patterns as a result of [U13C]glucose
  (Panel A) or [U13C]AcAc (Panel B) infusions. Schemes do not account for compartmentation
  of glutamine-glutamate cycling between glial cells and neurons and pyruvate recycling.
  All positional carbons are noted from left to right (C1–C6), and 13C are noted by
  filled black circles. The major entrance pathways of labeled 13C to citrate acid
  cycle (CAC) are noted in filled black arrows; the minor pathways are note by gray
  arrows. Pathways that do not contributes to first turn of CAC 13C labeling were
  marked with cross. Panel A: labeling patterns of brain metabolite isomers (M+2)
  from [U13C]glucose, only considering pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) pathway and first
  turn of CAC from citrate to oxaloacetate. Panel B: labeling patterns of brain metabolite
  isomers (M+2) from [U13C]AcAc as a result of the first turn of the CAC. ASP: aspartate;
  AAT, aspartate aminotransferase; α-KG, α –ketoglutarate; BHB:β-hydroxybutyrate;
  GAD :Glutamate acid decarboxylase; Glu : glutamate ; Gln : glutamine; PC, pyruvate
  carboxylase.'
