caption: Prostaglandins (PGs) mediate cellular and humoral immune responses through
  specific receptors (PGRs). PGs are synthesized from arachidonic acid (AA), which
  is released from phospholipids by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and is activated by immune
  challenge via cytokines or nitric oxide (NO). Oenocytoid cell lysis is mediated
  by PGR through a PKC pathway to activate a sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter
  (NKCC), which generates an osmotic gradient that pulls water into the cell. Prophenoloxidae
  (PPO) is released from oenocytoid into hemolymph, where it is activated to phenoloxidase,
  which leads to melanin formation. In plasmatocyte, PGR activates cytoskeletal rearrangement
  via a small G protein Cdc42 and change cell volume via aquaporin (AQP) for hemocyte-spreading
  behavior. PGs also mediate antimicrobial peptide (AMP) synthesis via Toll/IMD immune
  signaling components.
