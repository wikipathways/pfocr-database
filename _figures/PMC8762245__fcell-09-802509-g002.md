caption: Different sources-derived exosomes regulate the NLRP3 pathway in various
  patterns. Exosomes from plasma, macrophages, and mesenchymal stem cells suppress
  the activation of the NLRP3 pathway or the expression of the key molecule from the
  related signaling axis to regulate the progression of diseases. Otherwise, cancer
  cells and some pathogens may behave in another way. They release particular exosomal
  antigens and morbid substances to model a favorable environment for their own survival.
  Several pathogenic patterns were found. lncRNA, long non-coding RNA; miRNA, microRNA;
  PKC, Protein Kinase C. The figure was constructed with BioRender (https://biorender.com/).
