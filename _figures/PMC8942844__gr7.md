caption: The role of ubiquitination in tau oligomer pathogenesis in AD. In physiological
  condition, tau protein, an axonal microtubule-associated protein, accumulates both
  intracellularly and extracellularly. Ubiquitin signaling regulates the fate of tau
  protein by linking lysine (K) 48-, K11- or K63-linked ubiquitin chains for degradation
  through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) or the autophagy-lysosomal pathway
  (ALP). In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and other tauopathies, abnormal accumulation
  of misfolded tau aggregates is observed. Tau protein undergoes several posttranslational
  modifications (PTMs), including K48-, K11-, and K6-linked ubiquitination, and hyperphosphorylation,
  etc., initiating the formation of degradation-resistant paired helical filaments
  (PHFs), a key pathological hallmark of AD. We propose that K63-linked ubiquitin,
  but not K48-linked, selectively binds to soluble tau oligomers to enhance its secretion
  and spread the pathology as well as attenuate the UPS and ALP pathways. On the other
  hand, K48-, K11-linked ubiquitin bind to insoluble tau aggregates and subsequently
  translocate to UPS for degradation.
