caption: BMSC leptin receptor levels decline with age and reduce sensitivity to leptin.
  Caloric restriction increases leptin sensitivity, potentially via increasing the
  expression of Leptin receptor, as well as mediating affects on nutrient signaling
  pathways that can interact with the SDF-1 axis, such as HIF-1 and mTOR. The addition
  of peripheral leptin is permissive for BMSCs to move down the osteogenic pathway
  and reduces BM adiposity, while increasing bone formation. The addition of Leptin
  enhances CXCR4 downstream signaling.
