caption: 'Schematic overview of the pyruvate/isocitrate cycle and OGC, important components
  of the pathway regulating glucose- and glutamine-stimulated insulin secretion. The
  enzymes and transporters involved in pyruvate/isocitrate cycling are shown: pyruvate
  carboxylase (PC), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Glutamate dehydrogenase (Glud1)
  is also shown, along with the metabolic entry points for glucose, glutamine, and
  dimethyl-2-oxoglutarate (dm-2OG).'
