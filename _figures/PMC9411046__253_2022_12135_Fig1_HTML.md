caption: 'Schematic representation of the Crispr-Cas-adaptive immune response pathway
  in Prokaryotes. A Crispr locus showing crispr array, leader sequence, and Cas genes.
  B Three stages of Crispr-Cas pathway: as the viral genetic material is injected
  into the cell, cas1-cas2 complex identifies the PAM (protospacer adjacent motif)
  site and cleaves the protospacer sequence on the genetic material and integrates
  it into the host genome as spacer in Crispr loci (spacer acquisition). Pre-crRNA
  is transcribed from the Crispr array (expression) and processed to form mature crRNA,
  which binds to the Cas proteins forming an effector complex. When the same virus
  invades the cell, the crRNA-Cas protein recognizes and binds to the complementary
  sequence on the viral genome thereby cleaving it'
