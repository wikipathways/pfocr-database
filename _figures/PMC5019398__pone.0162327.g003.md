caption: The above schematic presents a summary of the findings and our current understanding
  of the relationship between the three different conditions, cold, senescence, and
  drought, with ATAF1 and PAO gene expression and chlorophyll (Chl) levels in plants.
  Pointed arrows represent direct relationships between the entities while blind-ended
  arrows represent inverse relationships between the entities.
