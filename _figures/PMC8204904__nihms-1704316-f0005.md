caption: Schematic representation of the signaling events at the growth cone plasma
  membrane in response to slit2 is shown. From the data presented here, we propose
  that slit2-Robo2 interaction at the surface of RGC growth cones could initiate a
  signaling pathway that leads to activation of Nox2 via cytosolic subunits such as
  p47phox or Rac. Cytosolic subunits are translocated to the plasma membrane, where
  gp91phox-p22phox resides for a full activation of the enzyme complex. Once active,
  Nox2 transfers an electron from NADPH to molecular oxygen to produce superoxide,
  which is almost immediately converted to H2O2 either spontaneously or by extracellular
  dismutase enzyme (SOD3). H2O2 can either enter the cell through aquaporins to post-translationally
  modify redox-sensitive proteins such as actin or oxidize receptor proteins extracellularly.
  The exact target(s) of H2O2 in this signaling pathway are not known in RGCs; however,
  there are multiple candidate redox-sensitive proteins that are involved in growth
  and guidance regulation. Upon target oxidation, a change in cytoskeletal dynamics
  cause growth cone collapse and repel the growth cone from slit2.
