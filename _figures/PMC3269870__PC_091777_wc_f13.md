caption: Working Model of PCN Functions in Embryo Development and Meristem Organization
  via the Auxin Signaling Pathway.This model summarizes key findings of this study.
  As shown in the top panel, PCN likely functions first as a repressor along with
  TPL and BDL to regulate known (i.e., DRN and ARR15) and potential (i.e., ARR7 and
  PLT) MP target genes during embryo development and later during meristem organization
  and maintenance. The middle panel shows polar localization of PIN1 in the wild-type
  (WT) embryo (orange lines) followed by patterning events that establish the embryonic
  SAM via the CLV-WUS–mediated regulatory loop and the embryonic RAM with auxin maxima
  and WOX5 in the QC. As shown in the bottom panel, disruption of PIN1 polarity in
  the pcn mutant embryo and auxin maxima in the enlarged pcn SAM results in ectopic
  expression of DR5-GFP, MP, and BDL in the SAM that likely affects the CLV-WUS loop
  (indicated by the broken line); in pcn, RAM is defective with expanded WOX5 expression
  and disrupted auxin maxima. Orange lines indicate PIN1 localization; orange arrows
  show the direction of auxin flow; green highlighted regions indicate auxin maxima
  as shown by DR5-GFP expression; and blue highlighted regions show WOX5 expression.
  Heterozygous mutations in TPL, PIN1, PID, MP, and WUS genes and homozygous recessive
  drn in the pcn background are able to progress through embryogenesis and produce
  viable seeds with the 29°C treatment; however, postembryonically their inflorescence
  meristems terminate in pin-like structures.
