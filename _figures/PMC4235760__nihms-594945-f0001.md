caption: Several microRNAs have recently been described to play a role in the cell
  fate outcome, survival or apoptosis, under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  stress. The three canonical unfolded protein response sensors, Activating Transcription
  Factor 6 alpha (ATF6α), Inositol Requiring Enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α) and Protein kinase-like
  ER Kinase (PERK) are activated under ER stress. ATF6α inhibits miR-455, which inhibits
  calreticulin, and mir-702 is an inhibitor of ATF6α. Mir-30c-2-3p antagonizes the
  IRE1α target mRNA X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1). IRE1α directly cleaves several
  microRNAs, including miR-17, miR-34a, miR-96 and miR-125b. In itself, IRE1α is repressed
  by the microRNA, miR-199a-5p. IRE1α-dependent degradation of these microRNAs derepresses
  caspase 2 and thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), thus, promoting apoptosis.
  PERK induces the XBP-1 inhibitory miR-30c-2-3p. It also induces miR-211, which inhibits
  Chop transcription via hypermethylation of its promoter. CHOP-dependent microRNA
  miR-708 promotes cell survival by inhibiting the ER folded protein, Rhodopsin.
