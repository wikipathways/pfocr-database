caption: A unifying model of Wnt signaling with regard to cardiomyogenesis. Illustrated
  at the left is the canonical pathway, similar to that in , with the presence of
  Dkk-1. Dkk-1 can promote cardiac differentiation via canonical inhibition as well
  as by activating JNK via unclear mechanisms. The G-proteins have also been linked
  to the canonical pathway. The illustration to the right provides an alternative
  portrayal of the noncanonical signaling pathway as a single entity. In this model,
  activation of the heterotrimeric G-protein-linked Fz receptor by Wnt ligand initiates
  a multifaceted signaling cascade that includes activation of phospholipase C, which
  generates inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). IP3 mediates cytoplasmic
  Ca2+ accumulation via its entry from the extracellular space and its release from
  the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This Ca2+ influx activates PKC (also activated
  via DAG) and CaMKII. Activation of Frz receptor also activates Dsh responsible for
  activation of Ca2+-dependent PKC and CaMKII signaling via direct interaction with
  the βγG-protein subunits, and/or by forming a Dsh/PKC protein complex that drives
  PKC-dependent JNK signaling. Rho/Rac may also activate JNK via PKC. Although PKC
  phosphorylates and activates JNK, cardiogenic signaling is incompletely inhibited
  with JNK inhibition, suggesting other (unknown) transducing elements downstream
  from PKC, perhaps ultimately involving (ATF/CREB)-mediated transcriptional regulation.
