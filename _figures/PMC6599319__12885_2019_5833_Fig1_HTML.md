caption: Simplified schematic illustration of pathways for Wnt/β-catenin, ERK/MAPK
  and PI3K/Akt and PGE2-metabolism. A) Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The engagement
  of the Wnt receptor, Frizzled, leads to the inhibition of the β-catenin destruction
  complex, composed of APC, axin and GSK3β. β-catenin thereby avoids ubiquitination
  and subsequent degradation, thus allowing it to translocate to the nucleus to activate
  an array of regulatory genes. B) The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK MAPK pathway. Stimulation of
  the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) leads
  to sequential activation of RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK causing modification of substrates
  promoting cell survival and proliferation. C) In the PI3K/Akt pathway, activation
  of the RTK or GPCRs leads to sequential modification of phosphatidyl inositol residues
  of the phospholipid bilayer. In this process, PI3K generates PIP3. PIP3 in association
  with PDK1 activates Akt. Akt then modulates the activity of downstream substrates
  including mTOR, thus promoting proliferation and cell survival. D) PGE2-metabolism.
  PGE2-synthesis begins with catalytic hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids by cytoplasmic
  phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), thus releasing arachidonic acid (AA). By the action of
  the COX-1 and COX-2, AA is converted to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). PGH2 is then converted
  to PGE2 by prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES). The main exporter of PGE2 is thought
  to be multi-drug resistance related polypeptide 4 (MRP4). Removal of PGE2 from the
  extracellular compartment around target cells occurs by diffusion to the blood stream
  and subsequent uptake and degradation in lung, liver or kidney endothelial cells
  or by import to colonic epithelial cells through the prostaglandin transporter (PGT)
  and subsequent degradation by 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). Through
  autocrine and paracrine signaling, extracellular PGE2 stimulates the prostaglandin
  receptors EP1–4. The EPs are GPCRs with EP1 being Gαq-coupled while EP2 and EP4
  are Gαs-coupled. EP3 is capable of coupling with different G-proteins including
  Gαi, Gαs and Gαq
