caption: Schematic illustration depicting cross-talk of autophagy process and NF-κB
  (Relish) pathway in response to pathogens in T. molitor. The intracellular Gram-positive
  bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes is recognized by PGRP-LE and the signaling cascade
  activates the NF-κB transcription factor, Relish. Subsequently, Relish regulates
  activation of autophagy by direct or indirect stimulation of nucleation step in
  hemocytes and AMP production in fat body. In addition, the Atg genes related to
  the nucleation (TmVPS34), recycling (TmAtg9), and elongation and recycling (TmAtg5
  and TmAtg8) were significantly regulated by silencing of TmRelish in hemocytes.
