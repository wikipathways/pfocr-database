caption: Model of the hypothetical estrogen-induced signaling pathway in neurons.
  (1) mGluR5 is a primary target for drug development in FXS. (2) Cell stimulation
  causes clustering of mGluR5 receptors and altered interactions with scaffolding
  proteins such as ER, caveolin and Homer, which likely alter downstream signaling
  events. Daidzein or other estrogenic compounds act as ER agonists. (3) mGluR5 is
  known to signal through FMRP, a translational repressor. The absence of FMRP in
  Fmr1KO cells results in constitutive, unregulated protein synthesis in response
  to mGluR5 stimulation. (4) Altered mGluR5/FMRP signaling modulates the synthesis
  of numerous synaptic proteins including APP, microtubule-associated protein 1B (Map1B),
  and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). Excessive production and accumulation
  of these synaptic proteins contributes to elevated epileptiform activity and FXS
  pathology.
