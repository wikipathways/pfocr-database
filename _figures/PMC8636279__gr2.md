caption: 'Helminth EVs and myeloid cells.Helminth extracellular vesicles are taken
  up by myeloid cells, interfering with innate defense pathways. (1) EVs from H. polygyrus
  are able to downregulate the IL-33 receptor subunit ST2, reducing their ability
  to respond to this cytokine. (2) EVs from B. malayi contain miRNAs that target components
  of the mTOR signalling pathway, downregulating it. These effects, as well as others
  yet characterised, combine to alter the activation state of macrophages. (3) EVs
  from S. japonicum and B. malayi induce M1 polarisation, whereas H. polygyrus EVs
  inhibit both M1 and M2 polarisation. (4) Helminth EVs interfere with the expression
  of components involved in antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation. E. granulosus
  EVs cause a decrease in MHC II in dendritic cells. E. granulosus and F. hepatica
  EVs both increase the costimulatory marker CD86 in dendritic cells. (5) Antibodies
  raised against helminth EVs prevent their action, either by preventing uptake altogether,
