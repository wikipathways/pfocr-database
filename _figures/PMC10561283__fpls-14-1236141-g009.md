caption: Model of paradormancy release hypothesis. According to the model, decapitation
  leads to the conversion of the sixth node winter bud into apical meristem tissue,
  resulting in the establishment of a polar auxin transport canal through the upregulated
  expression of VvPIN3 and VvTIR1. This process leads to a reduction in auxin levels.
  Mechanical wounding caused by short pruning induces the production of extracellular
  ROS by Rboh. The ROS signaling facilitated by Calmodulin (CaM) crossing the plasma
  membrane, triggers respiratory stress and oxidative stress in the cytoplasm, leading
  to mitochondrial dysfunction and an increase in ROS production. This elevation in
  ROS levels activates the cellular antioxidant machinery, including the ascorbate-glutathione
  cycle (AsA-GSH) pathway and catalase system, which helps mitigate the oxidative
  burst. The MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of plant hormones
  such as GA, ethylene, auxin, and cytokinins, resulting in alterations in their levels.
  Consequently, response genes or transcription factors are activated, inducing continued
  growth of the winter bud meristem. In contrast, hydrogen cyanamide directly disrupts
  the mitochondrial electron transport chain (m-ETC), leading to ROS generation and
  establishing a more direct signaling pathway.
