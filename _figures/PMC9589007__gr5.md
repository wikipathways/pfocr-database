caption: Detail on the increase of the biological pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis
  in liver(A) Pathway visualization based on Reactome and complemented with details
  from KEGG and the literature. Tiles illustrate log-fold change values of T2D compared
  with CTRL in liver. Proteins leading the increase of the pathway are marked as driving
  and are shown in black font and colored tiles. Proteins participating in the pathway
  and identified from MS proteomics, but not marked as leading edges, are in white
  tiles, whereas those in gray were not identified in this analysis.(B) Detailed comparison
  of the abundance of driving proteins between T2D and CTRL in liver.
