caption: The critical roles of β3GalT5 and the globo-series GSLs in regulating the
  apoptosis and survival of breast carcinoma cells. A schematic diagram suggesting
  that in the absence of β3GalT5, the expressions of SSEA3, SSEA4, and Globo-H are
  down-regulated, leading to the dissociation of RIP from the FAK complex. The released
  RIP is then associated with FADD to facilitate the FAS-mediated cell apoptosis through
  caspase-8 and -3 activation and FAK degradation. On the contrary, in the presence
  of β3GalT5, SSEA3, SSEA4, and Globo-H are up-regulated and associated with CAV1/FAK/AKT/RIP
  to form a complex on membrane microdomain and prevent the activation of caspase-3
  leading to breast carcinoma cell survival and metastasis. As indicated in the experiment,
  SSEA3/SSEA4 is more associated with CAV1, while SSEA3/Globo-H is more associated
  with FAK.
