caption: Proposed model for the nitrate regulatory genes in the nitrate signaling.
  NLP7 regulates nitrate signaling upstream of NRT1.1 when NH4+ is present and may
  regulate an NRT1.1-independent pathway in the absence of NH4+ in nitrate signaling.
  NLP7 interacts with NRG2 and NRG2 works upstream of NRT1.1 when NH4+ is present
  and/or absent. NRT1.1 regulates CIPK8 and CIPK23 at the transcript level. CIPK23
  can phosphorylate NRT1.1. These genes are all involved in regulating the expression
  of nitrate responsive genes.
