caption: 'Macrophage polarization-related signaling pathway (by Figdraw). (1) The
  JAK/STAT signaling pathway: IFN-γ binds to its receptor, activates Janus kinase
  (JAK), and then induces the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 1 (STAT1), leading to macrophage polarization to M1; however, the
  stimulation of IL-4 and IL-6 induces the phosphorylation of STAT6 and STAT3, respectively,
  which inhibits M1 polarization and promotes M2 polarization. Suppressors of cytokine
  signaling (SOCS) is a feedback inhibitor of the JAK/STAT signaling. Therefore, the
  regulation of SOCS can affect M1/M2 polarization through the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway. (2) The TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway: LPS binds to TLR4 and activates NF-κB
  through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) or interferon-regulating factor
  3 (IRF3), which promotes M1 polarization. (3) The TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway:
  TGF-β binds to its receptor, forms a receptor complex and phosphorylates it, and
  then activates the phosphorylation of its downstream signaling molecules (Smad2
  and Smad3) to inhibit M1 polarization and promote M2 polarization. In addition to
  their synergistic effects, TGF-β and Smads can separately mediate macrophage polarization.
  (4) The Notch signaling pathway: Notch signaling is closely related to miRNAs, such
  as miR-125a, miR-99b, and miR-148a-3p, which are the mediators of Notch promoting
  M1 polarization. (5) The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) signaling
  pathway: PPARγ often regulates macrophage polarization by interacting with other
  signaling pathways. For example, PPARγ can depend on the upregulation of fatty acid
  oxidation, which mediates M2 polarization'
