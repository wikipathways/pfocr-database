caption: Summary of Energy Metabolism Pathways Involved in Microglial Reprogramming.
  This figure summarizes the metabolic switch of microglia in the transition from
  homeostatic towards reactive phenotype. Homeostatic microglia rely on the TCA cycle
  and oxidative phosphorylation as energetic supply while reactive microglia shift
  metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis. HKs, PFKs, and PKs are traditionally considered
  the rate-limiting steps of this metabolic pathway leading to quick production of
  ATP. PFKFBs are bifunctional enzymes that regulate glycolysis by controlling the
  levels of F2,6BP, which acts as an allosteric activator of PFKs, thereby enhancing
  glycolytic flux. The glycolytic end product, pyruvate, can either be processed into
  acetyl-CoA to enter the TCA cycle or converted into lactate to complete aerobic
  glycolysis. Specifically, the increased transcription and activity of HK1, 2, and
  3, PFK1, PKM2 and PFKFB3 has been associated with the metabolic rewiring in microglia,
  though, differences between human and mouse microglia have been observed, adapted
  from Sabogal-Guáqueta et al. (2023). F1,6BP = fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; F2,6BP
  = fructose-2,6-bisphosphate; F6P = fructose-6-phosphate; G6P = glucose-6-phosphate;
  HK = hexokinases; LDHA = lactate dehydrogenase A; PEP = phosphoenol pyruvate; PFK
  = phosphofructokinases; PFKFB3 = 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase
  3; PK = phosphoenolpyruvate kinases; TCA = tricarboxylic acid
