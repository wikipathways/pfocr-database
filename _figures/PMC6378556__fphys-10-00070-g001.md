caption: Intracellular hyperglycemia results in increased production of mitochondrial
  ROS. ROS cause DNA damage releasing PARP-1 which inhibits G3PDH. This results in
  the accumulation of upstream glycolytic intermediates. Other pathways are activated
  as a result of the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates upstream of G3P which
  have detrimental effects on the cell; these pathways are; (1) Polyol pathway which
  depletes the cell of its antioxidant GSH system due to scavenging of NADPH, thereby
  augmenting ROS production, (2) Methylglyoxal which is a precursor to AGEs/RAGEs
  which activate pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant molecules, (3) DAG/PKC which impairs
  insulin signaling and eNOS activity, activates pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant
  molecules, (4) Hexosamine pathway with the resultant activation of pro-inflammatory
  molecules, inhibition of eNOS at the Akt activation site and activation of TGF-β
  with increase in ROS. All these pathways increase ROS in a positive feedback loop.
