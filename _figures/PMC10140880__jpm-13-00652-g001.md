caption: Schematic illustration of pro-BDNF/mBDNF ratio in normal brain and in Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD). (A) In a physiological condition, BDNF-TrkB signalling exerts protective
  effects, improving hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic plasticity
  and promoting neuronal survival. (B) In AD, the alteration of pro-BDNF/mBDNF ratio
  and the accumulation of pro-BDNF leads to the activation of p75NTR signalling pathway
  involved in programmed cell death, activation of long-term depression (LTD), and
  the biogenesis of Ab amyloid protein (amyloidogenesis), promoting neuronal damage.
