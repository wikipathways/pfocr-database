caption: 'A summary of the mechanisms through which statins attenuate pulmonary fibrosis.
  Inflammatory cells release inflammatory factors and the profibrotic factor TGF-β,
  which promote ROS release and activate ROS-related signaling pathways. Statins inhibit
  inflammation and act on ROS-related signaling pathways. In addition, statins upregulate
  PPAR-γ expression, which inhibits the activity of TGF-β, as well as YAP activity
  through the mevalonate pathway. Statins inhibit TGF-β and CTGF expression in fibroblasts
  by inhibiting the cholesterol synthesis pathway, which is associated with the inhibition
  of Rho prenylation. Abbreviations: CGTF: connective tissue growth factor; ECM: extracellular
  matrix; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GGPP: geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate;

  adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; p38: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase;
