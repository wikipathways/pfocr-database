caption: The key proinflammatory pathway induced by enteric pathogens results in nuclear
  factor κB (NFκB) mediated transcription of interleukin 8 (IL-8). Secreted IL-8,
  in addition to factors such as pathogen elicited epithelial derived chemoattractant
  (PEEC), stimulates the transepithelial migration of neutrophils. Intraluminal neutrophils
  target the pathogens for destruction. The precise bacterial components involved
  in evoking the inflammatory response and the details of the signalling pathways
  involved have not been determined in all cases. The mitogen activated protein kinases
  (p38, c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK), and ERK1/2) play a central role in many of
  these pathways. Pathogen associated molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) and flagellin, bind to cognate toll-like receptors (TLRs) to elicit a response.
  Finally, non-IL-8 mediated proinflammatory pathways also exist in epithelial cells.

  protein κB; IKK, IκB kinase; NIK, NFκB inducing kinase; AP-1, activating protein
