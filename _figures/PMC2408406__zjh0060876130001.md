caption: 'The role of microvasculature in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
  1. Leukocyte-endothelium interaction: The chronically inflamed endothelium displays
  enhanced leukocyte binding capacity and up-regulation of adhesion molecules. 2.
  Innate immunity: Pattern recognition receptors contribute to the activation of intestinal
  endothelium, increasing leukocyte adhesion and transmigration and contributing to
  the cytokine network of the gut mucosa. 3. Hypercoaguability: In IBD, a hypercoagulable
  state and a prothrombotic condition exist; in particular, the impairment of expression
  and function of the PC pathway and the overexpression of tissue factor suggest the
  biological importance of coagulation cascade and its alterations in intestinal inflammation.
  4. Platelet activation: The intimate adherence of platelets to the endothelium is
  characteristic of IBD, and it is well established that platelets behave aberrantly
  in both UC and CD. 5. Endothelial dysfunction: Intrinsic alterations in the chronically
  inflamed and remodeled microcirculation underlie vascular dysfunction that seems
  to play a fundamental role in chronic, deregulated inflammation, which characterizes
  IBD. 6. Angiogenesis: The enhancement of angiogenesis in IBD highlights neovascularization
  as a major contributor to the initiation and perpetuation of chronic intestinal
  inflammation.'
