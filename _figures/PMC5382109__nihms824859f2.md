caption: 'The activation modes of NF-κB in the pathogenesis of B cell lymphoma. There
  are three main modes: BCR, PI3K/AKT, and MYD88. (1). BCR is activated by antigen
  binding or cell autologous interaction, resulting in ITAMs phosphorylation in the
  cytoplasmic domains of CD79A and CD79B. Then SYK amplifies the initial activation
  signal by autophosphorylation and further ITAMs phosphorylation, which activates
  BTK and BLNK, leading to subsequent activation of PKCβ and CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 complex.
  (2). CD19 provides a docking site for the p85, followed by subsequent activation
  of BTK and BLNK. (3). MyD88 mutations are bound to IRAK kinase forming a helical
  protein, which activates the complex of CARD11-BCL10-MALT1. (4). A20 is a negative
  regulator of NF-κB. (5). IKK is phosphorylated to activate NF-κB transcription factors
  that regulate gene expression of several survival factors. The arrows indicate direction
  of signaling from plasma membrane toward effectors and bars indicate inhibitory
  steps.'
