caption: '(Created with BioRender.com) Signalling pathways, genetic mutations and
  potential targeted treatment involved in CNS germinoma development. Tumourigenesis
  in germinoma is stimulated through various mechanisms. Activating KIT mutations
  promote cell proliferation via PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. Molecular aberrations
  involving the PI3K/AKT pathway result in increased proliferation via mTORC1 and
  cell survival by apoptosis inhibition via mTORC2. MAPK pathway mutations promote
  cell proliferation. Potential targeted treatment (KIT inhibitors, immune checkpoint
  inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors) are presented. Gene mutations identified in CNS germinomas
  are depicted alongside each gene. Abbreviations: KIT: tyrosine kinase receptor;
  CBL: casitas B-lineage lymphoma; KRAS: Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue;
  NRAS: neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog; RAF: rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma
  kinase; MEK: mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase;
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; PDK:
  pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; AKT: v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog;
  mTOR: the mechanistic target of rapamycin; mTORC—mTOR complex; PD-1: programmed
  cell death protein 1; PD-L1: programmed death-ligand 1; CTLA4: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
  protein 4.'
