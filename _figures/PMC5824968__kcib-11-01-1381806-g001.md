caption: A model depicting NMJ structural organization mediated by dICA69 through
  its interaction with the actin regulatory proteins in the Cdc42-Cip4-Wasp pathway.
  Cdc42 activates localization of dCIP4 which in turn control the levels of Wasp at
  the postsynapse. The Cdc42-Cip4-Wasp pathway negatively regulates Drosophila NMJ
  development. Hence, ICA69 could be a positive regulator of this pathway at the postsynapse.
  Wasp machinery interacts with the Arp2/3 complex for the polymerization and organization
  of the actin-Spectrin cytoskeleton. dICA69 may associate with any of the components
  of this pathway to regulate the underlying cytoskeleton. Analysis of loss-of function
  alleles of ICA69 and genetic epistatic interactions with the components of actin-Spectrin
  cytoskeleton will help test this model.
