caption: Model for eEF1A-mediated protection of tRNAVal(AAC) from RTD degradation.
  Mature, hypomodified tRNAVal(AAC) pool is aminoacylated by valyl-tRNA synthetase,
  bound by eEF1A, and delivered to ribosomes. A shift to restrictive conditions results
  in degradation of hypomodified tRNAVal(AAC) by RTD pathway. It is unknown whether
  hypomodified tRNA can be efficiently charged and if it could be degraded prior to
  aminoacylation. Nevertheless, elevated population of eEF1A molecules favors their
  binding to tRNAVal(AAC) and prevents tRNAVal(AAC) interacting with nucleases. Increased
  availability of tRNA-free eEF1A molecules may be achieved by increased expression
  of TEF1 gene or decreased global tRNA synthesis by Pol III inhibition.
