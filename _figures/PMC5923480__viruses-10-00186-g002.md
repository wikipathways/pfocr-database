caption: Feline restriction factors and FIV counteraction mechanisms. In the absence
  of viral antagonists, several cellular proteins called restriction factors inhibit
  different stages of viral replication cycle. Monkey tripartite motif-containing
  protein 5α (TRIM5α) interacts with FIV capsid and inhibits an early infection step.
  Felines expresses a truncated TRIM5 gene that appears to have no antiretroviral
  activity, while the artificial fusion protein of feline TRIM5 with feline cyclophilin
  A (CYPA) displays potential inhibition against FIV. Feline apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing
  enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) induce hypermutations of FIV genomes
  by its cytidine deamination activity. It is still unknown whether feline expresses
  serine incorporator protein 3/5 (SERINC3/5) and whether they contain antiviral activity.
  Cats have mutation in the MxB genes resulting in a very short transcript not encoding
  a functional protein. Feline tetherin prevents FIV release from cell surface. The
  restriction factors are counteracted by FIV encoded proteins. FIV Vif interacts
  with feline APOBEC3s and induces their degradation by the proteasome pathway. FIV
  Env counteracts the restriction of tetherin.
