caption: Involvement of P4HB in potential signaling pathways affecting chemosensitivity,
  invasion and migration in HepG2/ADR cells. P4HB influences chemosensitivity, invasion
  and migration of HepG2/ADR cells via EMT, which is regulated by the β-catenin/Snail
  pathway. P4HB, prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta polypeptide; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition.

  pathway influencing chemoresistance in liver cancer cells.
