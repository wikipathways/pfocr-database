caption: A new branch of TLR3 signaling. The Src-dependent branch of TLR3 signaling
  pathway is distinct from the gene induction branch. DsRNA-stimulated dimerization
  of TLR3 leads to Src recruitment, its auto-phosphorylation leading to transient
  functional activation, followed by sequestration in the lipid rafts as an inactive
  pool, causing inhibition of cell migration, proliferation and adhesion.
