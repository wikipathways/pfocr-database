caption: Schemes for nanoparticles loaded with specific agents to target TAM signaling
  pathways. Nanoparticles target TAMs in the TME via two mechanisms, TAM depletion
  and TAM reprogramming. The former includes the inhibition of recruitment by blocking
  the CCL2-CCR2 signaling pathway and survival interference via inhibiting the CSF1-CSF1R
  signaling pathway. The latter mainly involves cellular re-education to change TAMs
  into M1 macrophages.
