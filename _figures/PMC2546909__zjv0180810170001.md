caption: Model of signal transduction pathway elicited by Env interaction with CCR5
  required for Rac-1 activation and membrane fusion. This study establishes the roles
  of various signaling molecules during HIV-1-induced membrane fusion by examining
  the effects of selective inhibitors and siRNA targeting the Gαq pathway using Rac-1
  activation, virus entry, and infection assays. Signaling molecules previously shown
  to be activated by gp120 are shown in bold, and confirmed pathways are shown with
  a solid line (, , , , ). Suspected factors that may be involved are shown in lightface
  font, and potential pathways are shown with dotted lines. Ras is shown in black
  because it was shown to be activated by Env in this study. Open boxes represent
  siRNA or selective small-molecule inhibitors used to inhibit Gαq and molecules downstream
  of Gαq.
