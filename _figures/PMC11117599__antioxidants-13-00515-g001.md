caption: The anti-fibrosis and fibrogenesis mechanisms of NO/NOS system. Nitric oxide
  (NO) has demonstrated its ability to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels
  by forming peroxynitrite, thereby inhibiting the activation of the ERK signaling
  pathway and subsequently suppressing the expression of genes associated with fibrosis
  and inflammation. Additionally, NO can downregulate the activity of transforming
  growth factor-beta (TGF-β), thus attenuating its downstream signaling pathways.
  Within the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) system, inducible NOS (iNOS), which produces
  high levels of NO, is associated with pro-inflammatory effects, whereas endothelial
  NOS (eNOS), which generates lower levels of NO, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties
