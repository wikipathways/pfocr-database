caption: Dual role of IL-6 in modulating insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. IL-6
  per se increases GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane by activating the LKB1/AMPK/AS160
  pathway. A dual effect on insulin action is observed when myotubes are exposed to
  this cytokine. Short-term IL-6 treatment has an additive effect with insulin on
  glucose uptake, mimicking the positive effect of IL-6 on insulin sensitivity when
  released from muscle after exercise. However, chronic exposure (such as when secreted
  by obese adipose tissue) produces insulin resistance, with impaired GLUT4 translocation
  and defects in insulin signaling. Accordingly, IL-6 impairs insulin signaling at
  the level of IRS-1 by three mechanisms that involve 1) serine phosphorylation by
  JNK, 2) impairment on tyrosine phosphorylation by SOCS3, and 3) tyrosine dephosphorylation
  by PTP1B. LXR agonists and SP600125 overcome such resistance by producing downregulation
  of SOCS3 and PTP1B expression and inhibition of JNK, respectively.
