caption: Cell surface and endosomal signaling pathway of TLRs. TLR4, TLR5, and heterodimers
  TLR1/2 and TLR2/6 sense bacterial invasion and initiate intracellular TLR-signaling
  pathway. Following the activation, each of them recruits several adaptors in the
  cytoplasm and activate MyD88-downstream. That means the activation of IRAK4 and
  phosphoryl IRAK1 that then bind to TRAF6 (not shown). TRAF6 then recruit MKK4 and
  IKKα/β pathway, where MKK4 initiate JNK and activate c-FOS and JUN, and push into
  the nucleus. While IKKα/β activates NFκB and its pro-inflammatory subunits and moves
  into the nucleus, similarly, endosomal TLRs (TLR3, 7–9) triggers the NFκB and MAPK
  pathways via involving MyD88 and IRAK4. Additionally, TLR3, MyD88 independently,
  recruit TRIF-pathway leading to the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF7. Both,
  surface and endosomal pathway ultimately result in a production of type I interferon
  and release of proinflammatory cytokines. MyD88, myeloid Differentiation primary
  response 88; IRAK4, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4; TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated
  factor-6; MKK4, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4; IKKα/β, IκK kinase; JNK,
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase; TIRF, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β;
  IRF3/7, interferon regulatory factor-3/7.
