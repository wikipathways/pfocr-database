caption: A schematic diagram illustrating miR-185 and ATR function in radiation response.
  ATR is activated by DNA damage resulting from exposure to ionizing radiation in
  combination with a series proteins such as replication protein A (RPA), ATR-interacting
  protein (ATRIP), DNA topoisomerase II-binding protein 1 (TOPBP1), RAD17 and the
  9-1-1 complex (Flynn and Zou). Activated ATR phosphorylates its effector kinase
  Chk1. Consequently, the ATR-Chk1 pathway has an important role in detecting DNA
  damage, initiating DNA repair and coordinating with other cellular processes, and
  serves as a central safeguard of the genome. However, elevation of miR-185 represses
  the ATR-Chk1 pathway and sensitizes cancer cells to ionizing radiation by promoting
  apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation
