caption: Schematic illustration of mechanisms inducing autoimmune diseases following
  COVID-19 vaccination. A. Following vaccination, vaccine antigens can trigger an
  immune response in the body. However, due to the presence of a heptapeptide that
  is shared between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and human proteins, vaccine
  antigens may also attack human proteins with similar structures via the molecular
  mimicry pathway. B. Adjuvants in vaccines can act as ligands for pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs), such as toll-like receptors (TLR), bind to them to mobilize innate
  immune cells and secrete massive cytokines, and induce an innate immune response.
  Additionally, adjuvants also enhance the induction of adaptive immune responses
  to vaccine antigens. Upon binding to T-cell receptors (TCRs), antigens activate
  naive T-cells, which differentiate into Th1 or Th2 cells under the influence of
  different cytokines. Th1 cells primarily stimulate cellular responses, including
  the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that can eliminate infected cells,
  while Th2 cells promote humoral responses, such as B-cell proliferation, differentiation,
  and secretion of neutralizing antibodies. C. During the innate immune response following
  vaccination, the immune system produces a large number of cytokines, which may induce
  autoimmunity through the bystander activation pathway. This includes the activation
  of bystander CD8+T cells primarily under the action of IL-15 and the activation
  of CD4+T cells primarily under the influence of IL-2. PRRs, pattern recognition
  receptors; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TCR, T cell receptor; CTL, Cytotoxic T lymphocyte.
