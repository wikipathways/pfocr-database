caption: A,  of the expression of 11 genes of the flowering pathway measured after
  3 weeks of vernalization at late collection time. The gradation from light to dark
  indicates the altitudinal gradient from high to low. Altitude of origin strongly
  correlated with the first principal component (PC1; r = 0.814) and weakly with the
  second principal component (PC2; r = 0.059). B,  of 21 edges (correlation between
  gene pairs) of the vernalization pathway of all gene expression data combined (i.e.
  all vernalization treatments and collection times). The gradation from light to
  dark indicates the altitudinal gradient from high to low. Altitude of origin strongly
  correlates with the first principal component (PC1; r = −0.514) and the second principal
  component (PC2; r = −0.333).
