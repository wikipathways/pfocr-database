caption: 'Schematic illustration of key steps in angiogenesis and multicellular interactions
  during new vessel development. (a) In rapidly growing tumours, severe hypoxia leads
  to the stabilisation of HIF proteins (HIF-1α and HIF-2α), triggering the synthesis
  and release of proangiogenic factors like VEGFs. These factors are initially sequestered
  by the basement membrane (BM) and cannot reach their target receptors on endothelial
  cell (EC) membranes. Cancer cells recruit macrophages and mast cells from the nearby
  stroma, which release matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that start degrading BM.
  (b) Degradation of BM releases sequestered proangiogenic factors, allowing them
  to bind to their receptors and activate the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway. Phosphorylated
  ERK translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription, promoting EC proliferation
  and migration. Additionally, increased endothelial permeability releases more MMPs
  and urokinase plasminogen activators (UPAs), participating in activating pericellular
  proteolysis and releasing additional proangiogenic factors (e.g., bFGF, TGF-β, PDGF,
  angiogenin and angioprotein). Activin receptor-like kinases (ALK1/5) work together
  to regulate angiogenesis, with ALK1 promoting the formation of new vessels and ALK5
  contributing to their maturation and stabilisation. VEGF-DLL4/Notch signalling regulates
  the formation of tip and stalk cells: VEGF induces DLL4 expression in tip cells,
  activating Notch1 signalling and suppressing tip cell formation in adjacent stalk
  cells. Tip cells adhere to the extracellular matrix via integrins, start to form
  lamellipodia and filopodia and migrate toward guidance signals like semaphorins
  and ephrins. (c) Stalk cells proliferate behind the tip cell, elongating the sprout
  along the VEGF gradient towards the tumour microenvironment and initiating lumen
  formation. Growth factors also decrease the levels of antiangiogenic molecules (e.g.,
  thrombospondins, angiostatin, endostatin), while eNOS and NO synthesis in endothelial
  cells under shear stress enhance blood flow, vascular permeability, and endothelial
  cell proliferation and migration. NO also interacts with VEGF, amplifying its angiogenic
  effects. (d) Proangiogenic signals recruit endothelial progenitor cells from the
  bone marrow, accelerating vascularisation. As sprouting continues, stalk cells deposit
  BM and recruit pericytes, stabilising the forming vessel. Pericyte precursors are
  attracted by endothelial cell-expressed PDGF and differentiate into mature pericytes
  in response to TGF-β, reducing endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and vascular
  leakage, leading to vessel stabilisation and the formation of mature vasculature.
