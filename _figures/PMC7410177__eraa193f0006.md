caption: Proposed model for autoregulation of mycorrhization (AOM) (A) compared with
  autoregulation of nodulation (B). (A) Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and high
  phosphorus (P) induce expression of MtCLE53 and MtCLE33 compared with low P expression
  levels. MtCLE53 and MtCLE33 are only expressed in roots. The mature MtCLE53 and
  MtCLE33 peptides could be root–shoot ascending signals initiating the systemic AOM
  mechanisms. AOM is dependent on the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase SUPER
  NUMERIC NODULES (SUNN) and CLAVATA2 (CLV2). MtCLE53 is further dependent on the
  hydroxyproline O-arabinosyl transferase (HPAT) enzyme ROOT-DETERMINED NODULATION
  1 (RDN1), while the requirement for post-translational modification of MtCLE33 is
  unknown. Signaling events downstream of SUNN possibly reduce strigolactone biosynthesis.
  (B) Rhizobia induce MtCLE12 and MtCLE13 in infection sites and developing nodules.
  Both peptides require tri-arabinose modification, MtCLE12 by RDN1 and MtCLE13 by
  an unknown HPAT. The mature MtCLE12 and MtCLE13 peptides ascend to the shoot to
  activate SUNN. SUNN signaling represses the shoot-to-root mobile miRNA miR2111,
  which in turn releases expression of the Kelch-repeat F-box protein TOO MUCH LOVE
  (TML). TML inhibits further nodulation.
