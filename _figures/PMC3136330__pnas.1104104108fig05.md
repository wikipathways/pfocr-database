caption: Model for the synthesis and selection of antigenic peptide substrates during
  the pioneer round of translation that precedes NMD. mRNAs are checked for PTCs during
  the initial quality control translation that follows newly synthesized and spliced
  mRNAs. This translation is initiated by the CBC, including CBP20/80, and produces
  PTPs that are instantly degraded and selected for antigenic peptide processing for
  the MHC class I pathway. mRNAs found to contain PTCs are targeted for the NMD pathway
  (), and those mRNAs that pass the quality control mature into mRNP complexes that
  bind the eIF4E cap-binding factor and initiate canonical translation complexes that
  govern the synthesis of full-length proteins (). Degradation of full-length proteins
  plays only a minor role as a source of antigenic peptides for the MHC class I pathway.
