caption: Generalized schematic of checkpoint molecule structure and expression, and
  the balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signaling. (A) The net balance of
  inhibitory (−, blue) and stimulatory (+, red) signals regulates antitumor immune
  responses. The tumor microenvironment is dynamic and is molded by inhibitory and
  stimulatory signals both in the microenvironment and distant tissues (i.e., lymph
  nodes). Development of cytotoxic effector T cells and NK cells is regulated by the
  balance between inhibitory and stimulatory signaling, including both receptor:coreceptor
  interactions and cytokines. Both receptor and cytokine expression are also regulated
  by that balance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals, creating feedback loops that
  evolved to eliminate pathogens and cancer while simultaneously limiting collateral
  damage. (B) Expanded view of potential receptor:coreceptor interactions between
  T cells, NK cells, antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and tumor cells. The graphic
  here demonstrates some of the best characterized pathways, with a particular focus
  on T cell and NK cell interactions with tumor cells and APCs. Note that many of
  the ligands depicted here are expressed on several cell types and interactions with
  coreceptors and ligands can result in different functional outcomes depending on
  the cell types and microenvironment. For example, CD47 is expressed on all cells,
  but the pathway of primary interest for transmissible tumors is for the ability
  of tumor cell-expressed CD47 to inhibit phagocytosis via binding to SIRP-α on APCs.
  In addition to binding to SIRP-α, CD47 also binds to SIRP-β, SIRP-γ, THBS1, and
  THBS2, but we have only shown the CD47:SIRP-α interaction here to keep the figure
  relatively simple. Both V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) and
  B7-H4 have unknown coreceptors (labeled as “?” in the diagram) whose function has
  been studied using fusion proteins, but the genes for the coreceptors have yet to
  be identified.
