caption: A proposed model for the biosynthetic pathway of S‐TeA in A. alternata. The
  precursor threonine is initially converted to the AMHA intermediate by reactions
  catalyzed by eight enzymes belonging to branched‐chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway
  in mitochondrion. AMHA is then transported to the cytosol, where acetyl groups are
  incorporated before being cyclized by NRPS. Finally, S‐TeA is released outside the
  cell. For comparison, the biosynthetic pathway of TeA is included. Carbon atoms
  are shown in black, nitrogen in blue, oxygen in red and hydrogen in gray. Each enzyme
  is displayed as molecular surfaces that can be distinguished by shape and color.
  The common enzyme reaction to the S‐TeA and TeA biosynthetic pathway is marked by
  an indigo arrow. The unique enzyme reactions of S‐TeA and TeA biosynthesis are marked
  as blue and purple arrows, respectively. Thr, threonine; OBA, 2‐oxobutanoic acid;
