caption: All proteins shown have been implicated in the CWI pathway or in control
  of Rho1. All three known Rho1 GEFs (Rom1, Rom2, and Tus1) and all four known Rho1
  GAPs (Lrg1, Bem2, Bag7, and Sac7) are shown. Underlining indicates proteins found
  in the screen. Proteins drawn in red are those which when mutated cause sensitivity
  to C16:1 but not C18:1. Sac7 is drawn in blue because sac7Δ instead causes C16:1R
  C18:1S.
