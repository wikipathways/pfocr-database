caption: Visual representation of the network generated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA). The network included the 5 identified/validated proteins and PPARg with direct
  and indirect interactions (EZR, LMNA, ENOA, PHB, and RUVBL2 orange stained) with
  PPARg (red stained) and localized to a specific cell compartment. Network proteins
  are visualized by proper symbols, which specify the functional nature of the protein.
  Each node represents a protein, the solid and dotted lines represent the direct
  and indirect associations among proteins, respectively. Proteins with no background
  color were undetected in the study but were inserted by IPA to produce a highly
  connected network.
