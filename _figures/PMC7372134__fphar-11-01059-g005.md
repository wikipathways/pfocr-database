caption: CO beneficial effects in cystic fibrosis (CF). CO may have several beneficial
  effects in CF. In addition to transcriptional induction of HO-1, CO helps to rebalance
  ion transport in bronchial epithelial cells by modulating the activity of BKCa channels,
  ENaC, and, possibly, CFTR. It has direct bactericidal activity and also primes the
  macrophages. It thus improves the host defense mechanisms by modulating autophagy,
  phagocytosis, the inflammasome, and immunometabolic responses. CO reduces cellular
  oxidative stress and improves cell survival by activating/inducing NO, GSH, NADPH,
  HO-1, PI3K/AKT, and Nrf2. CO also decreases hyper-inflammation by increasing levels
  of anti-inflammatory mediators, HO-1 and SPMs.
