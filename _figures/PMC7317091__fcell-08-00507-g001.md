caption: Summary of osteoclast differentiation induced by integration of CSF-1R, RANK,
  immunoreceptor-like and integrin receptor signaling. CSF-1 and its receptor CSF-1R
  activate the MAPK cascade pathway leading to the survival and proliferation of preosteoclasts.
  RANKL and its receptor RANK transduce signals via the adaptor molecule TRAF6, which
  activates the NF-κB and MAPK pathways leading to the differentiation of osteoclasts.
  The expression of the master regulator of osteoclastogenesis, NFATc1, is driven
  by NF-κB and NFATc1. The activation of NFATc1 is also regulated by the costimulatory
  signaling pathways, where FcRγ, DAP12 and their associating partners (OSCAR and
  TREM2, respectively) recruit Syk, which further activates PLCγ2, resulting in the
  activation of calcium signaling. The calcium signaling activates then calcineurin,
  which in turn promotes NFATc1 expression. The calcium signal also induces Vav3 activation
  involved in αvβ3 integrin signaling, which leads to cytoskeletal reorganization
  and osteoclastic bone resorption.
