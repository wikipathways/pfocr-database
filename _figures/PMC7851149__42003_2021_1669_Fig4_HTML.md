caption: In red, genes used in this work. In bold, enzymes catalyzing each reaction.
  Dashed arrows indicate more than one enzymatic step. This diagram was constructed
  according to “glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism” (cel00630), “glycine, serine
  and threonine metabolism” (cel00260) and “one-carbon pool by folate” (cel00670)
  from the KEGG pathway database and the metabolic network of glycolate, glycine,
  and serine in WormFlux,. GOX-1 glycolate oxidase 1, LDH-1 lactate dehydrogenase
  1, GHPR-1 glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase 1, AGTX alanine-glyoxylate
  transaminase, Ala l-alanine, Pyr pyruvate, GCS glycine cleavage system, MEL-32 serine
  hydroxymethyl transferase, MTHFD methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, GR glutathione
  reductase, 5,10-CH2THF 5,10-methylen tetrahydrofolate, 10-forTHF 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate,
  THF tetrahydrofolate.
