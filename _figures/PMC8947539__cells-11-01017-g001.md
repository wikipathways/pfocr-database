caption: Scheme of NK cell signaling after formation of immunological synapse (IS).
  Interaction of activating receptor with cognate ligand leads to phosphorylation
  of cytoplasmic tail and recruitment of PI3K [,]. Pathway (A) activation of PI3K
  and PLC lead to downstream signaling via MAPK and NFκB pathways, respectively, thus
  facilitating the production and secretion of cytokines, such as IFN-γ. Activation
  of MAPK signaling also contributes to MTOC migration and the polarization of lytic
  granules. Pathway (B). Conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  to phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate (PIP3) allows for subsequent generation
  of the secondary messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP3) via phospholipase C (PLC)
  []. IP3 contributes to the release of internal calcium stores from the smooth endoplasmic
  reticulum [], which in turn facilitates mitochondrial migration to IS and influx
  of extracellular calcium via the ORAI1 transporter [,]. Additionally, the microtubule
  organization center (MTOC) migrates towards the IS and allows for efficient transport
  of lytic granules (secretory lysosomes) to travel to the IS [,]. Lastly, lytic granules
  fuse with the NK cell membrane in a calcium-dependent manner and release perforin
  and granzymes into the IS []. These proteins form holes in the target cell membrane
  and induce apoptosis.
