caption: Hypothetic models for the role of F-CPE and ΔN-CPE in Wnt signaling. (a)
  Following binding of the Wnt ligand to its receptor, a complex containing different
  Wnt signaling components forms in cytoplasmic endosomes resulting in sequestration
  of GSK-3β and signalosome formation. The ‘β-catenin degradation complex’ is disassembled
  and β-catenin accumulates and translocates into the nucleolus. (b) Binding of F-CPE
  to Wnt and Fz affects signalosome formation and β-catenin can be efficiently degraded.
  (c) The ΔN-CPE splice variant expressed in cancer cells translocates into the nucleus
  and upregulates β-catenin mRNA transcription and protein levels to promote Wnt signaling.
