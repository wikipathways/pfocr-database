caption: The regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP, pink).
  SCAP (SREBP-cleavage-activating protein, blue) functions as a sensor for sterol.
  In the presence of high lipid/cholesterol/oxycholesterol, Insigs (Insulin-gene induced
  proteins, light green) are tightly attached to a SCAP and SREBP complex that remains
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Under low lipid/cholesterol/oxycholesterol conditions,
  Insigs are ubiquitinated and degraded, leading to the release of the SCAP and SREBP
  complex. The SCAP and SREBP complex is transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus
  and is sequentially processed by cleavage by site-1 protease (S1P, purple) and site-2
  protease (S2P, brown). The nuclear domain of SREBPs (N-SREBPs) are moved to the
  nucleus. Homodimers of N-SREBPs bind to SREs (sterol regulatory elements) in the
  promoter regions of genes encoding lipid pathway genes and other target genes.
