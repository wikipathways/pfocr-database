caption: Mechanisms of intestinal inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and CRC development.
  (A) Progression from normal epithelium to CRC, including hyperplasia, formation
  of small and large adenomatous polyps, progression to severe dysplasia, adenocarcinoma,
  and ultimately cancer. (B) Role of metabolic dysfunction in CRC. Adipose tissue
  releases leptin and insulin, activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in intestinal
  cells. This activation promotes tumor cell survival and proliferation, leading to
  CRC development. (C) Impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on CRC incidence.
  Inflammation induces activation of p53 and other key genes related to polyp formation.
  Chronic inflammation disrupts the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory
  substances, promoting DNA damage and resistance to apoptosis. (D) Changes in gut
  microbiota associated with IBD and metabolic diseases. IBD is associated with increased
  Bacteroides and Proteobacteria, while metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes
  are linked to changes in Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium
  populations. These changes enhance pro-inflammatory conditions, reduce butyrate
  production, and facilitate the formation of a cancer-prone environment
