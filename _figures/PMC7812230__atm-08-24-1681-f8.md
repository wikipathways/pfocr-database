caption: A schematic diagram illustrating the proposed mechanism by which peripheral
  nerve injury induces skeletal muscle atrophy. Denervation-induced skeletal muscle
  atrophy is associated with the activated inflammatory signaling pathway, IL-6/JAK/STAT3.
  The inhibition of IL-6 through tocilizumab (an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody), inhibition
  of JAK through ruxolitinib (a JAK1/2 inhibitor), or inhibition of STAT3 through
  C188-9 (a STAT3 inhibitor) alleviated denervation-induced skeletal muscle atrophy
  by reducing proteolysis.
