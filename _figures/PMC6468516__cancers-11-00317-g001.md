caption: The energy metabolism of normal differentiated tissues and tumor or proliferating
  tissues. (A) In normal differentiated tissues, under aerobic condition, a molecule
  of glucose is first converted to two pyruvates via glycolysis in the cytosol, followed
  by undergoing TCA cycle to produce CO2 in the mitochondria. A total of 30 or 32
  ATP molecules are generated during this process. Under anaerobic condition, glycolysis
  is preferential and less pyruvate is shifted to the oxygen-consuming mitochondria,
  only 2 ATP molecules are produced per molecule of glucose. (B) In tumor or proliferating
  tissues, mitochondrial function is still normal, but little mitochondrial oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) continues in tumor cells. In order to satisfy the metabolic
  requirements of both energy and materials for rapidly proliferating cells, ~85%
  of the glucose is processed to lactate via glycolytic pyruvate even in the presence
  of oxygen and ~5% of the glucose is metabolized by OXPHOS. In addition, ~10% of
  the glucose is diverted into the upstream of pyruvate production for biosynthesis
  (e.g., pentose phosphate pathway, PPP).
