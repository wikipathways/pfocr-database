caption: Scheme showing the intersections between energy metabolism and H2S oxidation.
  Reducing equivalents generated in the cytoplasm are moved to the mitochondrion via
  the malate–aspartate shuttle comprising a neutral α-ketoglutarate–malate and an
  electrogenic aspartate–glutamate transporter (pink). Conversion of malate to oxaloacetate
  in the mitochondrion regenerates NADH, which enters the electron transport chain
  (purple) at the level of complex I (CI). The purple arrows denote proton translocation.
  The sulfide oxidation pathway (blue) converts H2S to thiosulfate and sulfate with
  electrons from the oxidation catalyzed by SQOR entering at the level of complex
  III (CIII) and from sulfite oxidase (SO) at the level of complex IV (CIV). At higher
  concentrations, H2S inhibits CIV. α-KG, MDH1/2, GOT1/2, and IMS denote α-ketoglutarate,
  malate dehydrogenase 1 and 2, glutamate-oxoglutarate transaminase 1 and 2, and inter
  mitochondrial membrane space, respectively.
