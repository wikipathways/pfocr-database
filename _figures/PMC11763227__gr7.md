caption: 'FGF19 working model. Intestine-derived FGF19 enters the liver via the portal
  vein, and FGF19 possibly binds to β-Klotho and FGFR4 on the membrane of hepatocytes,
  consequently inhibiting the expression of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 to suppress the bile
  acid synthesis. During sepsis or in response to LPS, decreased FGF19 leads to failure
  in feedback of bile acid synthesis and exportation resulting in bile acids accumulation
  in hepatocytes, which induces oxidative stress-induced decreased ΔΨm and ROS overproduction.
  In addition to the role of FGF19 in maintaining bile acid homeostasis, FGF19 can
  directly resist LPS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production via activating
  the AMPK signaling pathway in hepatocytes.αMCA: α-muricholic acid; ωMCA: ω-muricholic
