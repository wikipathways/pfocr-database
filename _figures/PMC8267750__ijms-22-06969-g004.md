caption: Molecular mechanisms by which fructose induces nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
  Increased intestinal permeability (“leaky gut”) and dysbiosis produced by high fructose
  intake promote lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation from the intestine to the
  portal blood to reach the liver. Then, LPS activates the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4/MyD88
  signaling pathway, inducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) through the nuclear
  translocation of transcription nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which reinforces
  the inflammatory process through NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the subsequent
  maturation of interleukin (IL)-1 beta (β), caspase 1, and IL-18. Additionally, TNF-α
  and caspase 1 promote sterol-responsive element-binding protein 1 c (SREBP1c) activation
  and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) inhibition, while IL-6 drives hepatic
  stellate cell (HSC) activation, an orchestrated interaction of various molecular
  factors, leading to oxidative stress, inflammation, steatosis, and fibrogenesis,
  which pave the way to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) development.
