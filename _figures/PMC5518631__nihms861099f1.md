caption: Agrin signaling and YAP in neuromuscular junction formation (NMJ) and liver
  cancer development. A, Agrin is released from motor nerve terminals to induce AChR
  clusters and to direct NMJ formation. YAP and β-catenin in muscles regulate both
  post- and pre-synaptic differentiation. B, Agrin serves as a mechanotransduction
  signal to activate YAP by suppressing the Hippo pathway and by stimulating integrin-focal
  adhesion (FA) and thus to promote liver cancer development.
