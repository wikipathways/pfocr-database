caption: 'A grouping of M. longifolia essential oil constituents based on structure
  and biogenetic origin, primarily based on Başer et al., 1999 [], and Llorens-Molina,
  2015 []. Solid lines indicate frequent components or groups, broken ones symbolize
  those which are rather rare or detected only once. Individual compound names next
  to the arrows are important intermediates of the pathway between the initial and
  the final compound group, based on []. ‘No data found for Mentha spp.’: the description
  of the branches of the metabolic pathway of α-terpinyl cation to thujane-backbone
  monoterpenes and to γ-terpinene derivatives was not found in the literature on Mentha
  spp., although the steps of these pathways are known from other Lamiaceae plants
  [,].'
