caption: Schematic representation of the yeast Snf1/Mig1 signaling pathway. Shown
  is the Snf1/Mig1 pathway in the presence of high and low glucose levels in the growth
  medium. At high glucose levels, hexokinase PII (Hxk2) phosphorylates glucose, and
  glycolysis is fully active. The Glc7 phosphatase keeps Snf1 and Mig1 dephosphorylated,
  and, hence, Mig1 is located in the nucleus and, in complex with Cyc8 and Tup1, represses
  gene expression. At low glucose levels, hexokinase PI (Hxk1) and glucokinase (Glk1)
  also participate in glucose phosphorylation, but glycolysis is running at lower
  rate. ADP/AMP protect the SNF1 complex from dephosphorylation, and SNF1 phosphorylates
  Mig1, mediating its dissociation from Cyc8 and Tup1 and its nuclear exit. Snf1 is
  phosphorylated by three upstream kinases (Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1). Only Sak1 is shown.
  Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; Hxt, hexose transporter.
