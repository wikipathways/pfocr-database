caption: Model for NLRP12-mediated inhibition of canonical NF-κB and ERK signaling
  pathways in response to Salmonella infection. Salmonella infection of host macrophages
  leads to the activation of TLRs, which induces signal transduction via MyD88 and/or
  Toll or interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (Trif)
  to activate NF-κB and ERK. Phosphorylation of IκBα and subsequent degradation of
  IκBα (an inhibitor of NF-κB) enables the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus.
  ERK, as part of the MAPK pathway, is also phosphorylated. Both NF-κB and ERK activation
  lead to transcription of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial
  molecules, including iNOS, TNF-α, IL-6, and KC. During S. typhimurium infection,
  NLRP12 responds to an unknown activator and mediates the inhibition of IκBα and
  ERK phosphorylation, which results in a reduction in the levels of proinflammatory
  cytokines and antimicrobial molecules and a decreased capacity to control the replication
  and spread of S. typhimurium in the host cell. LRRs, leucine-rich repeats; NBD,
  nucleotide-binding domain; PYD, pyrin domain; SCV, Salmonella-containing vacuole.
