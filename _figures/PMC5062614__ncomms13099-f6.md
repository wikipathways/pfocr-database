caption: Activation of an NB-LRR immune receptor in plants by a pathogen effector
  leads to induction of multiple signalling pathways. A major event of the induction
  is the accumulation of SA at the infection site. At the high level of SA, NPR3 can
  interact with its substrate NPR1 to remove its repression on ETI and on crosstalk
  inhibition of the JA signalling pathway. Both NPR3 and NPR4 can also interact with
  JAZ proteins in an SA-enhanced manner leading to the degradation of JAZs. This results
  in activation of de novo JA synthesis of JA and amplification of the JA signalling
  through the canonical pathway. Activation of both SA- and JA-signalling pathways
  during ETI enables plants to use this PCD-associated defence strategy against biotrophic
  pathogens without making them vulnerable to necrotrophic pathogens. The blue triangle
  shape in the graph represents an unknown signal that may affect the degradation
  of JAZ1 through NPR3 and NPR4.
