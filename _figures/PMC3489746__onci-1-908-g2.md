caption: Figure 2. Transcriptional regulation of MHC Class II genes. The binding of
  interferon γ (IFNγ) to its receptor at the cell surface leads to the transcriptional
  activation of the Class II transactivator (CIITA). This transcription factor binds
  to the promoters of the invariant chain and MHC Class II genes. BLIMP-1 can block
  the transcription at such promoters by directly inhibiting CIITA upregulation. The
  expression can of the invariant chain can also be modulated by NF-κB in response
  to various pro-inflammatory signals. On the other hand, the binding of interleukin-10
  (IL-10) to its receptor at the cell surface triggers the upregulation of MARCH1.
