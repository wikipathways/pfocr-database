caption: Overview of SNX27/retromer pathway in metazoan cells. Metazoan retromer is
  implicated in three distinct endosomal pathways through direct interactions with
  SNX proteins to form elongated tubules. The SNX27/retromer pathway is specific to
  metazoans and mediates cargo recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane. In
  this pathway, cargoes including β2 adrenergic and glutamate receptors contain PDZ
  binding motifs recognized by SNX27. In addition, the SNX27 FERM domain binds NPxY
  motifs found in transmembrane cargoes. SNX-BAR/retromer and SNX3/retromer pathways
  occur in both yeast and metazoans. SNX-BAR/retromer retrieves cargoes from endosomes
  to the TGN, while SNX3/retromer is implicated in sorting receptors like Wntless
  (WLS) from endosomes to the TGN.
