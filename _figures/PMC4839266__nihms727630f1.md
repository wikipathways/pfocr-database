caption: A) Conserved biosynthetic steps in pathway, with CPAS gene (red) serving
  as a sequence tag. B) CPAS sequencing of various soil samples (orange dots) in America,
  leading to AZ25 soil sample (red dot) that likely contains novel clusters. C) Phylogenetic
  tree of known CPAS gene sequences, alongside with the hys and red sequences (boxed)
  that were amplified from AZ25.
