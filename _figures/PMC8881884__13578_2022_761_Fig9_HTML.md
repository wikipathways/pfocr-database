caption: The mechanism of anoikis resistance induced by SiO2-mediated pulmonary inflammation
  in fibroblasts. In fibroblasts exposed to SiO2, adhesion to the ECM was weakened,
  and detachment occurred. In addition, the prosurvival PI3K/MAPK signaling pathway
  was activated, which subsequently led to increased ZC3H4 expression, enhancing anoikis
  resistance in fibroblasts. Apoptotic resistance of fibroblasts and activation of
  differentiated myofibroblasts resulted in increased proliferation, migration, and
  collagen synthesis
