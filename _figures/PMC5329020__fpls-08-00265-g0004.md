caption: Three major pathways potentially in conflict between the host metabolism
  and pathogen virulence. Adapted from Seifi et al. (). Differential expression in
  RNA-seq at 2 dpi are represented by colored squares for each gene coding for key
  enzyme. The patterns refer to categories described in Figure . The main enzymes
  implicated in the nitrogen remobilization away from infected tissues are GS, Gln
  Synthetase; GOGAT, Glutamate synthase; GDC, glycine decarboxylase; ASN, Asn synthetase.
  The main enzymes implicated in the cell death pathway linked to GS/GOGAT are ProDH,
  Proline dehydrogenase; ARGAH, P5C reductase, arginase; OAT, Ornithine carbamoyl
  transferase; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; PAO, polyamine oxidase; GSHS, glutathione
  synthetase; OsOXO1-4, Oxalate oxidases; OsGLO1, glycolate oxidase. The main enzymes
  for TCA cycle and GABA-shunt pathways are AST, Asp transaminase; GDH, glutamate
  dehydrogenase; GAD, glutamate decarboxylase; GABA-T, and SSADH.
