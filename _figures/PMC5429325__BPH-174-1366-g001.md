caption: Mechanisms of action of branch‐chained amino acids (BCAAs). As energy substrate
  (orange box) BCAAs can be directed either to oxidation (through AMPK signalling
  in catabolic conditions) or to protein synthesis (through mTOR signalling in anabolic
  conditions). BCAAs act as nutrient signals to specific nutrient‐sensing systems
  (purple box). In particular, they may interact mostly with the general amino acid
  control non‐derepressible 2 (GCN2) pathway, specific leucyl‐tRNA synthetase and
  Sestrin2. Leucine inhibits the Sestrin2‐GATOR2 interaction and allows GATOR2 to
  activate mTOR signalling. BCAAs function also as nutrient modulators (blue box),
  by fine‐tuning the secretion of nutrient‐related hormones, such as leptin, adiponectin,
  GLP‐1 and pro‐opiomelanocortin (POMC). BCAAs increase the expression of PGC‐1α and
  sirtuin 1(Sirt1), thus promoting mitochondrial biogenesis (green box), partly through
  eNOS activity.
