caption: It is a diagrammatic representation of the circadian rhythm for providing
  a clear idea on the same. It has three different stages, such as (i) input pathway
  that contains light and temperature, which is then followed by (ii) central oscillator,
  in the presence of photoreceptors, such as PHY and CRY; further leading to the (iii)
  output pathway, which consists of many different physiological and developmental
  processes, such as (A) protein phosphorylation, (B) gene expression, (C) flowering,
  (D) petal opening, (E) cotyledon and leaf movement, (F) stomatal opening, (G) chloroplast,
  (H) calcium levels, and (I) biotic and abiotic stress. All these processes indicate
  the step-by-step variations that take place in every plant during the changes in
  photoperiodic rhythm.
