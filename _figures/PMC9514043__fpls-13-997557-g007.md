  1-dehydrogenase; PFK, 6-phosphofructokinase; FBA1, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase;
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; GOT1,
  aspartate aminotransferase; mdh, malate dehydrogenase. The different protein expression
  levels changes were represented by log2(FC) in expression. Red and blue indicate
  upregulated and downregulated proteins, respectively,* indicates a significant difference.
