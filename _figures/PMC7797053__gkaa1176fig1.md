caption: Distinct pathways for the formation of butyryl-CoA and isobutyl-CoA and their
  consequences in leading to protein lysine butyrylation. Lysine butyrylation was
  discovered in 2007 () and was recognized as n-butyrylation. In this study, we found
  that lysine butyrylation also exists in the form of isobutyrylation in histones.
  Endogenous n-butyryl-CoA is derived from fatty acid metabolism while isobutyryl-CoA
  is derived from valine metabolic pathway. Exogenous butyrate and isobutyrate can
  be converted to their acyl-CoA by the action of cellular short-chain acyl-CoA synthetases.
