caption: 'Activation and downstream signaling of class III RTKs. In the inactivated
  state, RTKs are auto-inhibited by the JMD (purple line) in cis. Ligand binding occurs
  in the ED indicated by orange, purple, green, and blue circles. Ligands of RTKs
  discussed in this review are specified in the upper left box and the ligand is depicted
  as a grey double-hexagon. Ligand binding induces the oligomerization of the receptor.
  Thereby, the IgG-like domains of the ED rotate to form an efficient receptor–ligand
  complex. This induces transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the TKD (purple
  circles) and JMD (purple line). Phosphorylation of the JMD leads to the release
  of the inhibitory conformation and to the swing out of the tyrosine side chains.
  The phosphate is generated through transformation of ATP to adenosine diphosphate.
  Thereby, the conformational change (into trans) of the RTK processes from a transactivated
  to a fully activated state. In the activated state, the titling angle of the ligand
  shifts when the ternary complex is generated with the exception of PDGF. In addition,
  the activation loop (red line) establishes an active conformation enabling the binding
  of substrates (turquoise hexagon) and ATP. Downstream signaling is achieved by phosphorylation
  (indicated as orange circles with P) of signaling molecules described in the right
  part of the figure. This includes PLCγ, JAK/STATs, PI3K, and the MAPK signaling
  pathway. These signaling pathways regulate the transcription of various genes implicated
  in cell proliferation, migration, survival, angiogenesis, and cell cycle progress.
  Constitutive activation of RTKs by different mutations would lead to constitutive
  phosphorylation of downstream effectors and deregulation of the transcription of
  genes implicated in cell proliferation and others. Adapted by permission from Macmillan
