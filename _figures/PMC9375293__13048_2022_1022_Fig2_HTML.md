caption: 'CD39 and CD73 in TME of OC. CD39 and CD73 localized on the surface of OC
  cells inhibit immune responses mediated by T cells, MDSC, and TAM in TME, and also
  induce cisplatin resistance. CD39 and CD73 dephosphorylate eATP to eAMP, ultimately
  converting it to eAdo. STAT3 induces cell surface acquiring CD39 in TME to promote
  immunosuppression. Metformin facilitates AMPKα phosphorylation and inhibits the
  HIF-α pathway to block the immunosuppression caused by high expression of CD39 and
  CD73 on MDSC. MDSC: myeloid-deriver suppressor cell; TAM: tumor-associated macrophage;
  TME: tumor microenvironment; eATP: extracellular ATP; eAMP: extracellular AMP; eAdo:
  extracellular Ado'
