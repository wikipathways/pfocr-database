caption: 'Crosstalk between Wnt, PTH and BMP signalling in cartilage and bone cell
  lineages. Wnt ligands mediate canonical signalling through β-catenin and BMP signalling
  can be mediated by SMAD1, SMAD3 and SMAD5. The LRP5 and LRP6 antagonists sclerostin
  and DKK1 are a central focus of targeted antibody-based therapeutics. The primary
  stages in the lineage progression of cartilage and bone cells as they differentiate
  from skeletogenic stem cells are depicted. Major stimulatory and inhibitory effects
  on the differentiation and proliferation of the two lineages are denoted. Primary
  effects of the BMP, PTH and Wnt pathway on osteoclast differentiation are indirectly
  mediated by differing pathway activities that regulate paracrine factor expression
  in osteocytes, which in turn regulate osteoclast differentiation and function. Abbreviations:
  BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; BMPR, bone morphogenetic protein receptor; DKK1,
  Dickkopf-related protein 1; LRP, LDL receptor-related protein; MSC, mesenchymal
  stem cell; PTH, parathyroid hormone; PTH1R, parathyroid hormone 1 receptor; PTHrP,
  parathyroid-hormone-related protein; RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear factor
  κB ligand; SMAD, mothers against decapentaplegic homologue.'
