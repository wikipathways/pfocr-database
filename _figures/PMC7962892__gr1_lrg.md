caption: TNFα-induced signaling pathway of cell survival, apoptosis and necroptosis.
  The combination of TNF-α and TNFR1 on the cell membrane stimulates different signaling
  pathways, including NF-κB, RIA, RDA and necroptosis. TNFR1 exists in the cell membrane
  and its subunits can spontaneously trimerize and bind to ligands, allowing their
  cytosolic tails to recruit multiple proteins and generate a complex (complex I).
  Ubiquitylation of RIP1 could stabilize complex I and contribute to NF-κB release.
  Additionally, deubiquitylated RIP1 cooperates with its cognate kinase RIP3 for recruitment
  of another complex (complex II). The formation of complex Ⅱa and Ⅱb is followed
  by the activation of caspase-dependent cell death via apoptosis, while complex Ⅱc
  induces necroptosis. When activated RIP1 combines with RIP3 and thus leads to the
  formation of complex Ⅱc, cell death shifts to a caspase-independent way, followed
  by the phosphorylation and oligomerization of MLKL, which marks the beginning of
  necroptosis.
