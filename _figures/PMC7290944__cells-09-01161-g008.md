  with glycolysis enzymes hexokinase 2 (HKII) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase

  (SDH), respiratory complex II, which oxidizes succinate to fumarate (3) [], which
  can lead to disruption of ATP synthesis and the electron transport chain causing
  electron leakage and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (4) [,]. 3-BP reacts
  with the cysteine moiety in glutathione (GSH) (4), the main ROS scavenger, leading
  to its depletion and increase of ROS levels (5) [,]. In addition, 3-BP can cause
  inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) due to hindrance of glucose-6-phosphate
  formation (6), which in turn can lead to a fall in NADPH and further GSH depletion.

  repair and cell survival [,].'
