caption: 'The predicted flavonoid pathway and the expression patterns of flavonoid-related
  genes in leaves of E. sagittatum. Enzyme abbreviations: 4CL, 4-coumarate: CoA ligase;
  ACT, acyl transferase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase;
  C3H, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; CA3OMT, caffeic acid
  3-O-methyltransferase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase;
  F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; FNS II, flavone synthase II;
  3GT, 3-glucosyl transferase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; RT, rhamnosyl transferase.
  The blue and red arrows indicate the catalysis steps by enzymes negatively and positively
  contributing to bioactive component (BC) accumulation in E. sagittatum, respectively.
  The black arrow represents that the first step of the phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzed
  by the PAL enzyme (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) is not included for analysis in
  this study. In both the HN3 and JX3 lines, the genes in blue and red are negatively
  and positively responsible for BC accumulation, respectively. In either the HN3
  or JX3 lines, the genes in light blue and purple are negatively or positively involved
  in BC biosynthesis, respectively. The genes in black indicate no correlation with
  BC accumulation. For gene expression, the expression levels of flavonoid-related
  genes are normalized from 0 to 2 as shown in the lower-right-corner bar and displayed
  by the BAR HeatMapper Plus Tool (http://bar.utoronto.ca/ntools/cgi-bin/ntools_heatmapper_plus.cgi).
  For the heat map, the upper-row and bottom-row indicate the expression pattern of
  genes in the HN3 and JX3 lines, respectively. The six dots in each row correspond
  to an expression profile of gene obtained at six different developmental stages
  of leaves.'
