caption: 'Model for how insulin signaling within adipocytes regulates the GSC lineage.
  Our previous published work showed that insulin signaling within the ovary (grey
  arrows) controls GSC maintenance (through the niche) and proliferation, follicle
  growth, and vitellogenesis (reviewed in ). In this study, we show that insulin signaling
  within adult adipocytes controls multiple steps of oogenesis through distinct effectors:
  1) GSC maintenance is modulated by the InR/Akt1/GSK-3β axis (red); 2) early germline
  cyst survival downstream of Akt1 (blue) and Akt1-independent progression through
  vitellogenesis (purple) are controlled by as-yet-unidentified downstream effectors
  of the insulin signaling pathway. As reported previously (), the InR/Akt1/FOXO axis
  controls adipocyte growth (orange).'
