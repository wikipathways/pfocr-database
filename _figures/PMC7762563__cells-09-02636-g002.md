caption: Angiopoietin–TIE signaling pathway in the vascular endothelium. (a) The schema
  indicates Ang-TIE signaling in vascular ECs. Ang1 promotes endothelial cell survival,
  vessel stability and barrier function via activation of signaling receptor TIE2
  and its downstream targets, PI3K/AKT and Rho family GTPases. Ang1-TIE2-PI3K/AKT
  signaling inhibits NF-kB, FOXO 1 and FOXO 1-induced Ang2. Ang2 is a weak agonist
  or antagonist which modulates Ang1-TIE2 pathway. Upon inflammation and vascular
  injury, Ang2, stored in Weibel-Palade bodies, are released in circulation, antagonizes
  Ang1-TIE2 signaling and then increases FOXO1 and Ang2. Unlike signaling receptor
  TIE2, TIE1 is an orphan receptor homolog of TIE2, and mostly does not react to ligands.
  In some cases, TIE2 signaling is stimulated by phosphorylation due in part to the
  TIE receptor complex with TIE1. TIE2 activation is also achieved by the inhibition
  of a VE-PTP, which dephosphorylates and deactivates TIE2. Note that ‘P’ next to
  the intracellular part of TIE2 indicates phosphorylation. (b) The left upper panel
  shows transmission EM images with schematic indication of vascular ECs and pericytes.
  The right upper panel indicates that abundant Ang1 enhances endothelial barrier
  function and stabilizes vessels. In contrast, abundant Ang2 decreases endothelial
  barrier function and increases vascular permeability, leading to the formation of
  leaky vessels (Right lower panel).
