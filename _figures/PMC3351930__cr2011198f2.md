caption: Anti-angiogenic signaling by Sema3E-plexin D1 in endothelial cells. The activation
  of plexin D1 by Sema3E induces the association of the Ras GAP domain of plexin D1
  with R-Ras. This inactivates integrins and enables their subsequent internalization
  by the plexin D1-mediated activation of Arf6, thus inhibiting endothelial cell adhesion
  to the extracellular matrix (ECM) by disrupting integrin-mediated adhesive structures,
  and causing filopodial retraction in endothelial tip cells. The pathway by which
  Sema3E stimulation of plexin D1 leads to Arf6 activation involves phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinase
  β activation, which generates PI(4,5)P2 locally. PI(4,5)P2 then binds to the PH
  domain of an Arf6 GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange protein 100, resulting in Arf6
  activation. Sema3E-induced Arf6 activation induces rapid focal adhesion (FA) disassembly,
  integrin internalization, and endothelial cell collapse, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis.

  description: Anti-angiogenic signaling by Sema3E-plexin D1 in endothelial cells.
    The activation of plexin D1 by Sema3E induces the association of the Ras GAP domain
    of plexin D1 with R-Ras. This inactivates integrins and enables their subsequent
    internalization by the plexin D1-mediated activation of Arf6, thus inhibiting

    adhesive structures, and causing filopodial retraction in endothelial tip cells.
    The pathway by which Sema3E stimulation of plexin D1 leads to Arf6 activation
    involves phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinase β activation, which generates
    PI(4,5)P2 locally. PI(4,5)P2 then binds to the PH domain of an Arf6 GEF, guanine
    nucleotide exchange protein 100, resulting in Arf6 activation. Sema3E-induced
    Arf6 activation induces rapid focal adhesion (FA) disassembly, integrin internalization,
    and endothelial cell collapse, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis.
