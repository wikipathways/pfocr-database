caption: '(A) HptB is activated (i.e. phosphorylated) via either one of three orphan
  sensor kinase hybrids: PA1611, ErcS’ (PA1976) or SagS (PA2824) [–]. When phosphorylated,
  HptB transfers a phosphoryl group to the HsbR receiver domain (HsbR-P), thus repressing
  HsbR kinase activity while activating its phosphatase activity. HsbR-P dephosphorylates
  the anti-anti-sigma factor HsbA. Dephosphorylated HsbA leads to dissociation of
  the HsbA-HsbR complex and a subsequent stable sequestration of the anti-sigma factor
  FlgM by HsbA []. The interaction HsbA-FlgM induces flagellar genes expression, by
  allowing the release of the FliA sigma factor (σ28) []. When HptB is inactive (dephosphorylated
  or in an hptB mutant), swimming and swarming are no longer supported. Instead, the
  HsbR kinase phosphorylates HsbA (HsbA-P) and HsbA-P interaction with HsbD leads
  to an increase of c-di-GMP and RsmY levels. The activation of HsbD strengthens swarming
  repression and results in hyper-biofilm and hyper-twitching phenotypes. This cascade
  of events is in agreement with the waves of regulatory actions that cause bacteria
  progression from an early surface attachment and colonization (swimming and swarming)
  to the development of mature sessile biofilms [, , ]. The symbol ➔ indicates positive
  regulation, while -¦ repression and de–P (de)phosphorylation. Dashed lines suggest
