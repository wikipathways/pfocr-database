caption: Stress signalling to fungal SAPK pathways. Relay of stress signals to the
  SAPK pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida
  albicans. Core components of the SAPK pathways are shown in red. Proteins involved
  in two-component-related signalling are shown in blue and those involved in Sho1-branch
  signalling in green. Candida albicans homologues of proteins that are involved in
  SAPK activation in S. cerevisiae, but not in C. albicans, are shown in grey. Only
  those pathways that have been shown to regulate SAPK phosphorylation are shown,
  with the exception of the second, uncharacterized, osmotic stress-signalling pathway
  in C. albicans, which is indicated by a dashed line. It is currently unknown how
  TORC1 and Gad8 regulate Pyp2 levels and hence this is also represented by a dashed
  line. As, arsenite stress; Hs, heat stress; Os, osmotic stress; Ox, oxidative stress;
  Wa, weak acid; MG, methylglyoxyl; Hm, heavy metals and Ns, nutrient stress.
