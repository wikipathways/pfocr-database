caption: Hepatitis C virus life cycle. Hepatitis C virus enters cells by stepwise
  binding through host receptors low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), glycosaminoglycans
  (GAGs), scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SRB1), CD81, and the tight junction
  proteins claudin 1 and occludin. Interaction between CD81 and claudin 1 facilitates
  viral uptake by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Endosomal low pH triggers membrane
  fusion and release of genome into the cytoplasm. The positive-sense (+), single-stranded
  RNA is translated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element at its 5' untranslated
  region (UTR) into a single polypeptide, which is then cleaved into the core, E1,
  E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B by host signal peptidase (purple scissor)
  and signal peptide peptidase (pink scissor) and viral autoprotease (NS2-3) (fluorescent
  green scissor) and serine protease (NS3-NS4A) (dark green scissor). Replication
  is catalyzed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, assisted by the helicase
  activity of NS3, via a negative-sense (−) intermediate RNA (red arrows). Replication
  takes place in the membranous web, which consists of single, double and multiple
  membrane vesicles. Formation of the membranous web is induced by NS4B and NS5A.
  Assembly of virion is initiated on core-coated lipid droplets (LD) followed by budding
  into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is coated by the ER-resident envelope
  proteins E1 and E2. Egress follows the secretory pathway to release the virion to
  extracellular space. The viroporin, p7, forms ion channels to equilibrate pH gradients
  during trafficking through the secretory pathway to protect the virion.
