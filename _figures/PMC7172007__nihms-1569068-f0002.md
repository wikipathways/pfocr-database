caption: 'Acute injury to the kidneys results in death and injury to tubular epithelial
  cells. These damaged cells secrete both Wnts and pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting
  in recruitment of macrophages, which further contribute to Wnt pathway activation.
  Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tubular epithelium has many downstream
  effects which primarily result in proliferation or prevention of apoptosis. Apoptosis
  is prevented through the inhibition of pro-apoptotic Bax, mediated by β-catenin-dependent
  phosphorylation of Akt and/or inhibition of p53. Wnt/ β-catenin signaling also promotes
  cell survival through increased expression of survivin. The target genes activated
  by Wnt/β-catenin signaling include cyclin D and cMyc, both of which are pro-proliferative
  proteins. Proliferation helps to replace cells killed during the injury and differentiation
  of these injured and replacement cells leads to recovery. This figure was created
  with Biorender.com. Abbreviations: Bax, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) associated X protein;
  Akt, protein kinase B; TCF, T-cell factor.'
