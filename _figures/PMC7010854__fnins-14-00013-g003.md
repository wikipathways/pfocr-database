caption: Cross-talk between peripheral and central immune system on neurodegenerative
  susceptibility. (A) Peripheral immune system regulates neurodegeneration. Under
  a physiological scenario, Foxp3 + T cells are released from the liver to circulation
  reaching the central nervous system (CNS) positively modulating neuronal survival,
  whereas soon after a chronic activation Foxp3 + T cells become overactive promoting
  neuronal death. Likewise, activation of the inflammasome pathway in the liver produces
  IL-1β and TNF-α which exacerbate neurodegeneration. (B) Central immune system regulates
  neurodegeneration. Astrocytes secrete extracellular vesicles (EV) to the circulation
  reaching the liver and positively modulating the NF-κB transcriptional activation
  program, which includes IL-1β, TNF-α and CCL2 synthesis and release. This pro-inflammatory
  profile has been reported to contribute centrally to neuronal damage.
