caption: Signaling pathways of inflammasome forming NLRs. PAMPs interact with inflammasome
  forming NLRs (NAIP-NLRC4, NLRP1, NLRP3) as well as non-inflammasome forming NLRs
  such as NLRP6 which then activates procaspase-1 leading to inflammatory response.
  In non-canonical pathway, NAIP-NLRC4 interact with caspase-8 whereas NLRP6 and NLRP12
  interact with caspase-4,5,11 to induce pyroptosis. In addition, in teleost, NLRP3rel
  has also been shown to follow similar inflammasome signaling pathways (denoted in
  red lines). (LTA- lipoteichoic acid, ATP- adenosine triphosphate, S. aureus- Staphylococcus
  aureus NAIP- neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein, ASC- apoptosis-associated speck-like
  protein containing a CARD).
