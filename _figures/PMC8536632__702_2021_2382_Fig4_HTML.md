caption: A model of genetically driven contributions to the coupling of action and
  valence during learning. DA neurons signal positive reward prediction errors by
  phasic bursts and negative prediction errors by dips below baseline firing rate.
  While the first reinforces the direct pathway via activation of D1 receptors and
  thereby facilitates the future generation of go choices, the second reinforces the
  indirect pathway via reduced activation of D2 receptors and thus facilitates the
  future generation of no-go choices in comparable situations. A1 carriers would be
  assumed to have reduced D2 receptor-binding capacity decreasing autoinhibition of
  dopaminergic signaling after negative prediction errors in the indirect pathway
  and a shift to a more action-oriented behavioral pattern mediated by the direct
  pathway. COMT Val108/158Met Met carriers would be assumed to have higher frontal
  DA availability facilitating working memory and attentional processes. Moreover,
  indirect downstream effects on striatal DA regulation may add on improving performance
  under Pavlovian conflict in Met compared to Val homozygotes. The MNI template brain
  from MRIcroGL (“mni152”) was used in this illustration.Figure adapted from Richter
