caption: The proteasome contains a 20S multicatalytic core and one or two 19S regulatory
  caps. IκB–α, a proteasome substrate traps the active form of NF-κB (a dimer of RelA
  and p50, or of RelB and p52) in the cytosol. NFκB p50 or p52 are generated from
  the inactive precursor p105 or p100, respectively, through proteasome partial cleavage.
  After phosphorylation by IKK, a polyubiquitin chain (red square, ubiqutin) is attached
  to IκB-α with the help of β-TrCP E3 ligase. Then IκB-α is recognized and degraded
  by the proteasome, setting NF-κB free. The free, active NF-κB complex then enters
  into nucleus to transactivate target genes required for tumor proliferation. The
  selected terpenoids could target the ubiquitin-proteasome and NF-κB pathways at
  indicated specific steps, resulting in apoptosis induction and tumor growth inhibition.
