caption: Model for α-arrestin-mediated regulation of hexose transporter abundance
  and localization. (A) In response to 2DG, Rod1 ubiquitination increases, suggesting
  increased binding between Rod1 and Rsp5 through their respective PPXY motifs and
  WW domains. Rsp5 membrane association is mediated by the Ca2+-dependent lipid/protein
  binding (C2) domain. The Rod1-Rsp5 complex directs the ubiquitination and endocytosis
  of Hxt1/3. Hxt1/3 are subsequently trafficked to the vacuole, where they are degraded.
  (B) Rod1 regulation and posttranslational modifications. In response to 2DG, Snf1
  is modestly activated and Rod1 phosphorylation increases (gray arrows). Under high-glucose
  conditions, the phosphorylation of Rod1 by Snf1 inhibits its trafficking function.
  In response to 2DG, Rod1 ubiquitination increases, promoting the internalization
  of hexose transporters, suggesting that an alternative, Snf1-counterbalancing pathway,
  such as the Reg1/Glc7 phosphatase, must also be activated by 2DG (black arrows).
  (C) Rog3 regulation and posttranslational modifications. In response to 2DG, Rog3
  protein levels, and possibly Rog3 ubiquitination, are increased. In the absence
  of Reg1, Snf1 kinase hyperactivation promotes Rog3 degradation.
