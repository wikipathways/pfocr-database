caption: TCF7L2 ChIP-seq in HCT116 cells. The orange color genes in the ‘Type II Diabetes
  Mellitus Signaling’ pathway represents TCF7L2 binding sites candidate target genes
  that were the closest gene transcription start site to TCF7L2 binding sites regardless
  of the direction from the binding site. Data were analyzed through the use of Ingenuity
  Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, http://www.ingenuity.com, Redwood) City, California,
  USA) specified for ‘Human’. The genes that contain at least one function or pathway
  annotation in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base were eligible for the analysis. ChIP,
  chromatin immunoprecipitation; TCF7L2, transcription factor 7-like 2; VDCC, voltage-dependent
  calcium channels; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinases; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PKC,
  protein kinase C; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; SUR, sulfonylurea receptor; TNFα, tumor
  necrosis factor α; INS, insulin; INSR, INS receptor; TRAF2, TNF receptor-associated
  factor 2; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; SMPD, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; GK, glucokinase;
  PYK, pyruvate kinase; GLUT, glucose transporter; ADIPOR, adiponectin receptor.
