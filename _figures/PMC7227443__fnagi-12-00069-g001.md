caption: A central pathway through which sleep disturbance and AD pathology is connected
  is through neuroinflammation caused by Aβ deposition (). Microglia and astrocytes
  are both activated and release inflammatory factors in response to Aβ (). Additionally,
  disruption of internal clock gene function in microglia causes an increase in their
  release (). AD pathology may damage neural pathways and lead to calcification within
  the pineal gland (, ). This leads to a reduction in the amount of melatonin which
  in turn causes sleep disturbance (). This relationship is bidirectional, as sleep
  disturbance is linked to disruptions of melatonin release (). Melatonin has anti-inflammatory
  properties, reducing the release of these factors by attenuating the release of
  NF-κB (). Additionally, melatonin reduces amyloid precursor protein (APP), thus
  protecting against Aβ creation (). However, Aβ, by binding toll-like receptors of
  the pineal gland, may block melatonin release, leading to sleep disturbance in AD
  (). Noradrenaline, released from the locus coeruleus (LC) also plays an anti-inflammatory
  role, as the neurotransmitter can reduce the release of inflammatory factors ().
  Low adrenergic input from the LC to the extracellular space (ECS, location of astrocytes)
  during sleep is required to allow Aβ and other metabolite clearance to occur ().
  The LC-noradrenergic system activates with cortico-hippocampal neuronal replay during
  NREM EEG slow oscillations, suggesting a prominent role in sleep dependent memory
  consolidation (; ). Thus, inappropriate activation of the LC may compromise its
  role in memory consolidation during sleep and reduce Aβ clearance, leading to AD
  pathology. Finally, sleep disturbance has been independently linked to the release
  of inflammatory factors and increased blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability (;
  ). Sleep disturbance is correlated with increased Aβ deposition and may be occurring
  through any of the above pathways (; ; ).
