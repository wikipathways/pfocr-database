caption: NK cell ‘third signal’ occurs via IL-12 family cytokines and their receptors.
  Schematic of downstream signaling of the IL-12 family cytokines with their respective
  transcriptional outcomes. IL-12 consists of p35 and p40 subunits, that activate
  the IL-12 receptor leading to JAK2/Tyk2 phosphorylation and phosphorylation of Stat4,
  which can then dimerize and enter the nucleus. IL-23 is composed of p19 and p40
  subunits, which activate the IL-23 receptor leading to phosphorylation of JAK2/Tyk2
  and signaling via STAT. IL-27 is composed of p28 and Epstein-Barr Virus-Induced
  3 (EBI3) subunits and activates the IL-23 receptor leading to phosphorylation of
  JAK1/2 and Tyk2 and signaling via STAT. IL-35 is composed of p35 and EBI3 subunits
  and activates the IL-35 receptor leading to phosphorylation of JAK1/2 and Tyk2 and
  STAT signaling. IL-39 is composed of p19 and EBI3 and activates the IL-35 receptor
  leading to STAT signaling. Finally, IL-18R does not belong to the IL-12R family
  but plays a vital role in activating NK cells when co-stimulated with IL-12. Activation
  via IL-18R leads to the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway.
