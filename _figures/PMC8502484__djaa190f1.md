caption: Innate viral sensing and cellular response to viral infection and host response
  to radiation-induced inflammation. A) The presence of viral nucleic acids within
  different cellular compartments activates PRRs. RIG-I and MDA-5 are cytosolic PRRs
  that sense viral dsRNA in association with the MAVS complex that interacts with
  TBK1-IKKε. IRF3 and IRF7 are phosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus to initiate
  transcription of type I IFNs and ISGs. A subset of endosomal TLRs detect nucleic
  acid species. TLR9 senses unmethylated CpG-DNA, and TLR7 and TLR8 recognize ssRNA.
  TLR7, 8, and 9 signal through a pathway dependent on the adapter, MyD88. TLR3 senses
  dsRNA and triggers the TRIF-dependent pathway. Both MyD88 and TRIF-dependent signaling
  converge to activate TRAF6, whereas TRIF-dependent signaling also involves TBK1-IKKε.
  Collectively, endosomal TLR signaling leads to Nuclear factor kappa B (NFĸB) activation
  and transcriptional activation of type I IFN via IRF7 and IRF3. Cytosolic dsDNA
  can activate the AIM2 inflammasome to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and caspase-1–mediated
  pyroptosis. Cytosolic viral dsDNA is also recognized by cGAS, which catalyzes production
  of cGAMP. cGAMP activates the endoplasmic reticulum-localized adapter, STING, causing
  STING to dimerize and translocate to nucleus where it activates TBK1, leading to
  IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. NF-ĸB signaling is also activated
  downstream of STING via IKKε. B) Radiation-induced DNA damage results in double-stranded
  DNA breaks (DSBs) and micronuclei carrying fragmented dsDNA rupture in the cytoplasm,
  triggering cGAS-STING signaling and a type I IFN response. Exosomes loaded with
  radiation-induced dsDNA fragments as well as extracellular cGAMP activate the cGAS-STING
  pathway and type I IFN signaling. Type I IFNs bind cognate IFNAR complexes leading
  to phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2. This promotes the recruitment of STAT1 and
  STAT2 and IRF9 to form the ISGF3 complex, which translocates to the nucleus and
  binds ISREs, leading to transcription of ISGs. AIM2 = absent in melanoma 2; cGAMP
  = 2’3’-cyclic CMP-AMP; cGAS = cGAMP synthase; dsDNA = double-stranded DNA; dsRNA

  protein 5; PRR = pattern recognition receptor; RIG-I = retinoic acid-inducible gene-I;
