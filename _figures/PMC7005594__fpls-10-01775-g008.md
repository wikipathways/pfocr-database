caption: Interlinked coherent and incoherent type 1 feed-forward loops (FFLs) in ETI-responsive
  specialized metabolism. (A–B) Three FFLs identified in this study form a composite
  hierarchical network motif (A) that is likely responsible for the expression dynamics
  and metabolic flux changes through the camalexin and 4OH-ICN pathways (B). Blue
  and red directed lines indicate activating and inhibitory direct (solid) and indirect
  (dashed) interactions, respectively, between TFs (orange and blue circles in A,
  rectangles in B) and pathway genes (purple circles in A, arrows in B).
