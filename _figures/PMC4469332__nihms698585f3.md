caption: The production of BH4 within the DRG plays a critical role in pain signaling.
  In basal states (A), the de novo synthesis pathway exhibits weak activity and BH4
  levels are relatively low but physiologically normal. Here the recycling pathway
  plays an important role in maintaining adequate levels of BH4. After peripheral
  nerve injury (B), there is a major upregulation of GCH1 mRNA, protein and consequent
  enzyme activity and an increase in SPR and QDPR levels but to a lesser extent, which
  results in very high levels of BH4. In chronic inflammatory states (C), the protein
  levels of these enzymes are not increased, but there is nonetheless an overproduction
  of BH4 in the DRG caused by an increase of enzyme activity. Therapeutic strategies
  that block the de novo synthesis pathway but not the recycling pathway (D) in the
  peripheral nervous system should allow a reduction of BH4 to non-pathological levels.
