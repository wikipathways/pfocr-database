caption: Schematic representation of how oncometabolites can modulate radiosensitivity.
  The indicated oncometabolites (orange) can accumulate as a consequence of mutations
  of TCA cycle enzymes or environmental cues, such as hypoxia and even without oncogenic
  mutations e.g. by pharmacologic inhibition of SLC25A1. 2-HG, succinate and fumarate
  induce metabolic reprogramming and a “pseudo-hypoxic phenotype” via stabilisation
  of HIF1α. Moreover, indicated oncometabolites are competitive inhibitors of the
  αKG-dependent KDM and TET families of epigenetic enzymes, thereby modulating DNA
  repair and pathway choice and offer novel therapeutic opportunities with IR. αKG = α-Ketoglutarate,
  C = cytosine, K = Lysin, L/D-2-HG = L/D-2-hydroxyglutarate, mt = mutant, Orange
  colour represents increased metabolite levels
