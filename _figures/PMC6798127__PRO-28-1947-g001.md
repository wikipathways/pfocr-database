caption: The KEGG metabolic pathway map for arginine biosynthesis (map00220), where
  rectangles and circles represent enzymes and chemical compounds (substrates and
  products), respectively. Enzymes are identified by functional orthologs called KOs,
  although EC numbers and gene names are displayed. The KEGG pathway module is a functional
  unit in the metabolic pathway defined by a set of KOs. Two modules M00028 (upper)
  and M00763 (lower) are shown by pink‐colored rectangles
