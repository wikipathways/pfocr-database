caption: a | In normal conditions, insulin binds to the α-subunits of the insulin
  receptor (IR) in cardiomyocytes, which induces the phosphorylation of the IR β-subunits.
  This phosphorylation triggers the activation of the docking protein IR substrate
  1 (IRS1), which subsequently activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and
  RACβ serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (AKT2), which has a critical role in glucose
  metabolism. PI3K and AKT2 activation promotes the translocation of glucose transporter
  4 (GLUT4) and the free fatty acid (FFA) transporter CD36 from intracellular stores
  to the plasma membrane, thereby leading to increased glucose and FFA uptake. FFAs
  can activate the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α
  (PPARα), which induces the expression of multiple genes related to lipid metabolism.
  Increased glucose and FFA uptake increases mitochondrial oxidative metabolism to
  generate ATP via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and β-oxidation, which supports
  myocardial contractile function. Insulin-mediated activation of AKT2 leads to inhibitory
  phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which increases glycogen
  synthesis by glycogen synthase (GS). b| In type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin signalling
  in cardiomyocytes is impaired. Signalling through the insulin-dependent glucose
  intake pathway is diminished, leading to increased FFA intake via CD36 and to eventual
  lipid accumulation. However, the excessive amount of FFA exceeds the capacity of
  mitochondrial respiration to generate ATP, leading to cardiomyocyte death, impaired
  cardiac function and lipid accumulation and toxicity. Potential therapeutic targets
  for metabolic disturbances that have been tested in preclinical models or in clinical
  studies are marked with an asterisk. HK, hexokinase; P, phosphorylation; PDK, pyruvate
