caption: The canonical and non-canonical inflammasome pathways in pyroptosis. In the
  canonical pyroptosis pathway, active NLRP3 binds Pro-caspase-1 via ACS to form NLRP3
  inflammasome, followed by activation of Caspase-1. Active Caspase-1 mediates the
  maturation and cleavage of IL-18 and IL-1β from the GSDMD, which forms membrane
  pores and releases cytoplasmic inflammatory contents, leading to cellular pyroptosis.
  In the non-canonical pyroptosis pathway, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Gram-negative
  bacteria directly activates Caspase-4/5/11. Activated Caspase-4/5/11 cleaves the
  GSDMD to induce pore formation, while activating the NLRP3 inflammasome through
  K efflux, leading to pyroptosis. Created in BioRender. Xia, S. (2024) https://BioRender.com/y83o292
