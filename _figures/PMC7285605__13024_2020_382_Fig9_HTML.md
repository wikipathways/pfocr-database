caption: Summary of the Ca2+signaling alterations in APOE4 astrocytes. a) Ca2+signaling
  pathway of APOE3 (a) and APOE4 (b) astrocytes in the presence (left) or absence
  (right) of extracellular lipids. The name of  channels and receptors that increase
  cytosolic Ca2+ are in blue rectangles, whereas pathways decreasing cytosolic Ca2+
  are in green rectangles. The size of the arrows indicates if the process is increased
  with respect to APOE3 astrocytes in the presence of extracellular lipids. Plasma-membrane
  lipids and lipoproteins are shown in different colors in APOE3 and APOE4 astrocytes
  to reflect their different lipid composition. Organelle and plasmatic membrane graphs
  were obtained from Smart Servier Medical Art (https://smart.servier.com/)
