caption: Overview of the N and C fluxes within the rhizobium–legume holobiont using
  symbiotic nitrogen fixation as the sole source of nitrogen. Atmospheric N2 is fixed
  into NH3/NH4+ by nitrogenase in the bacteroids of the root nodule. The resulting
  NH4+ is delivered to the plant cells where it is assimilated into amino acids (AAs).
  In temperate legumes, asparagine (Asn) is the main form of transport of nitrogen
  from the root to the shoot through the xylem flux, whereas in some tropical legumes,
  this transport involves ureides. Photosynthesis allows the plant to capture light
  and CO2 to produce sugars that are either distributed as sucrose within the plant
  through the phloem to the “sink” organs or stored as starch. Sucrose is delivered
  to the roots together with AAs enabling nodule development and symbiotic activity.
  Nitrogen fixation is energy costly and requires intense fueling by the plant to
  the symbiont. Malate and succinate are the main sources of carbon and energy provided
  by the plant to the bacteroid, where they are used through the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle to generate reducing power and ATP. Despite the fact that nitrogen fixation
  produces large amounts of NH4+, the assimilation of NH4+ is repressed in bacteroids,
  and therefore amino acids are acquired by the bacteroid from the plant. Nodule sucrose
  also fuels the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) regenerating the reducing
  power required to maintain redox homeostasis under the microoxic conditions of nodules.
  The plant growth determines the N and C nutritional requirements of the plant. ETC,
  electron transfer chain; NO, nitric oxide; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
