caption: The current working hypothesis of PBC development is illustrated. The primum
  movens of the proposed mechanisms is based on the peculiar apoptotic features of
  biliary epithelial cells (BEC). Secondary to a reduced glutathiolation (I), apoptotic
  BEC release an intact PDC-E2 (II) which also includes lipoic acid (III). Lipoic
  acid in turn becomes the ideal target for xenobiotic-induced modifications with
  2-octynoic acid as the best candidate (IV) and with N. aromaticivorans possibly
  influencing this pathway (V). The modified or substituted lipoic acid residue is
  then uptaken by antigen presenting cells (VII) and is capable of breaking immune
  tolerance (VIII) in the presence of a permissive genetic background. Female predominance
  of PBC may be explained by major sex chromosome defects such as X monosomy (IX)
  or by the increased exposure to specific xenobiotics (X). Indeed, individual susceptibility
  may be based on on a direct putative impact of a specific set of genes on disease
  development or progression (XI), as suggested by association studies, or by epigenetic
  changes of sex (XII) or somatic (XIII) chromosomes that remain to be investigated.
  The ultimate result of a permissive genetic background and an undertermined environmental
  exposure is the development and perpetuation of the PBC liver injury (XIV).
