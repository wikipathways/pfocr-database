caption: Overview of the STAT3 signaling pathway. A cytokine (here IL-6) binds to
  its cognate receptor, which leads to phosphorylation of Janus Kinases (JAKs). Activated
  JAKs phosphorylate STAT3, which allows it to form dimers, shuttle to the nucleus
  and act as a transcription factor. The three main negative regulators of STAT3 activity
  are shown in red. SOCS3 inhibits the catalytic activity of JAKs preventing STAT3
  phosphorylation, PTPs (phosphotyrosine phosphatases) dephosphorylate STAT3 dimers
  and PIAS3 prevents DNA binding of STAT3 dimers. In STAT3 GOF disease, the signaling
  cascade can be influenced at different levels leading to a variable combination
  of (1) increased phosphorylation or decreased dephosphorylation, (2) altered dimer
  formation (including heterodimers), (3) changes in nuclear translocation of the
  dimer, (4) altered DNA binding kinetics and motives and (5) changes in the target
  gene expression. The effect on non-canonical functions (6) and heterodimerization
  of different STAT molecules remains to be fully characterized.
