caption: Schematic diagram showing the pathways involved in the pathogenesis of vascular
  calcification (VC) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). As CKD progresses, secreted
  frizzled-related protein 5 (sFRP5) and Wnt5a levels decrease, while Wnt3a levels
  increase. Wnt3a can activate the canonical or noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway.
  With regard to the pathogenesis of VC, Wnt3a activates noncanonical (ROCK/JNK) Wnt
  signaling, which leads to the trans-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells
  (VSMCs) into osteoblast-like cells. sFRP5 inhibits Wnt3a-mediated activation of
  the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, leading to the attenuation of the osteoblastic
  trans-differentiation of VSMCs. Wnt5a inhibits canonical Wnt signaling, which leads
  to the suppression of osteoblast activation following bone loss in CKD. The solid
  arrows indicate activation, the dashed lines with blocked ends indicate inhibition,
  and the dashed arrows indicate reductions in the CKD environment.
