caption: MSn fragmentation scheme defining the major fragmentation Pathways I and
  II, of Francisella lipid A species and isobaric lipid A species featuring heterogeneous
  acyl chain distribution. Francisella major tetraacyl lipid A at m/z 1665 consists
  of one isoform only (blue). Further minor isobaric lipid A species featuring acyl
  chain distribution on the disaccharide backbone are indicated in red for m/z 1693
  (heterogeneous isoforms A-D) and in green for m/z 1637 (heterogeneous isoforms E-G).
  Major MSn lipid A fragmentation pathways are attributed to which O-linked acyl group
  is cleaved first, i.e., either loosing the O-linked acyl group on the 3-position
  (pathway I, “3-cleavage”) or the O-linked secondary acyl chain attached the primary
  N-linked acyl group on the 2′-position (pathway II, “2′-O-cleavage”). Fragment ions
  are annotated with one or more asterisks or cross-hatch to denote the MS cycle and
  the fragmentation pathway it was derived from.
