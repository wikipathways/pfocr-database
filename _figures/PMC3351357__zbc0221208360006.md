caption: Schematic model of the regulatory mechanism of Ksp1 in autophagy. Ksp1 may
  be positively regulated by PKA phosphorylation, and Ksp1 may, in turn, activate
  TORC1. The TORC1 activation by Ksp1 allows hyperphosphorylation of Atg13, resulting
  in down-regulation of autophagy. Ksp1 might have a TORC1-Atg13-independent mechanism
  that suppresses autophagy, and Ksp1 may be subject to feedback regulation by TORC1
  (shown here as activating, but there are no data that address this point).
