caption: Metabolic pathway of honokiol in cells that use a ras signaling schema. Honokiol
  acts on the ras-Rhoa complex to inhibit PLD expression. The inhibition of PLD expression
  then causes consequential apoptosis in cells. Honokiol can also act on cyclophilin
  D, via a loss of the p16ink4a pathway, which can induce necrosis or autophagy via
  two distinct pathways. The first is the cyclophilin D effect to upregulate Jnk1,
  causing bcl2 to phosphorylate, causing autophagy. The second is the effect on WT
  p53 and bcl2, which leads to mitochondrial permeability via the transition pore.
  The second route leads the breakdown of the cellular system and necrosis.
