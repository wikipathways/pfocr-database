caption: 'Scheme for triacylglycerol (a) and cholesterol ester synthesis (b). For
  the synthesis of triacylglycerols, note that there is an alternative monoacylglycerol
  pathway for TAG synthesis in addition to the glycerol phosphate pathway shown in
  a []. In addition, fatty acids from diet are utilized for production of fatty acyl-CoAs
  as well as endogenously synthesized fatty acids. Abbreviations are as follows: ACAT,
  acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol transferase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACS, long-chain
  acyl-CoA synthetase; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase; FAS, fatty acid synthase;
  FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; GPP, geranyl
  pyrophosphate; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate;
  LPAAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase; PPH-1, phosphatidate phosphohydrolase-1.'
