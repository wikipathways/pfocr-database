caption: 'Acquisition of cysteine from extracellular cystine through xCT and de novo
  production of cysteine through the transsulfuration pathway. (Left) Extracellular
  cystine is transported into the cell through xCT while glutamate is exported. Thioredoxin
  or glutathione reduce cystine to cysteine, which is subsequently used for the synthesis
  of proteins, glutathione, and other sulfur-containing molecules. (Right) The de
  novo cysteine synthesis pathway (transsulfuration) requires the sulfur group from
  methionine. In the methionine cycle, methionine is adenosylated to produce SAM.
  SAM donates a methyl group to a methyl acceptor (protein, RNA, or DNA) to generate
  SAH. SAH hydrolase (not shown) generates Hcy from SAH. Hcy can regenerate methionine
  by accepting a methyl group from betaine or 5-MTHF from the folate cycle. Hcy can
  alternatively exit the methionine cycle via its condensation with serine by CBS
  in the first step of the transsulfuration pathway to produce Cth. Cth is subsequently
  hydrolyzed by CSE to ammonia (not shown), α-ketobutyrate (not shown), and cysteine.
  5-MTHF: 5-tetramethylhydrofolate, 5-THF: 5-tetrahydrofolate, Cth: cystathionine,
  CBS: cystathionine β-synthase, CSE: cystathionine γ-lyase, CysSH: cysteine, CysSSCys:
  cystine, DMG: dimethylglycine, GSH: glutathione, Hcy: homocysteine, Met: methionine,
  SAH: S-adenosylhomocysteine, SAM: S-adenosylmethionine, TXN: thioredoxin.'
