caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways to the starter and extension units of proanthocyanidins.
  A, Structures and labeling patterns of 4 to 8-linked procyanidin dimers. Procyanidins
  B1 to B4 represent the four possible combinations arising from dimerization of 2,3-cis-(−)-epicatechin
  and 2,3-trans(+)-catechin, with procyanidins B2 and B3 being the homodimers of epicatechin
  and catechin, respectively. The percentage values represent the approximate percent
  of known structures with that particular unit as starter (lower) or extension (upper)
  unit. The large black arrows signify radiolabel incorporation from trans-cinnamic
  acid; the upper units incorporate 3 to 5 times more label than the lower units,
  and labeled epicatechin only labels lower units in procyanidin B2. B, Scheme for
  separate origins of starter and extension units in plants with the LDOX/LAR pathway.
  Green highlighting indicates potential extension units, and the central green box
  shows the reactive species thus derived (carbocation and quinone methide) and the
  nucleophiles that can trap them (light blue ovals). Flav-2-en-3,4-diol is proposed
  as a potential substrate for generation of 2,3-cis-leucocyanidin for epicatechin
  extension units. In species that possess LAR, expression of this enzyme can determine
  chain length by converting Epi-cys (extension unit) to epicatchin (starter unit).
  Brown highlighting indicates starter units. Enzymes are as follows: CHS, chalcone
  synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3H, flavanone
  3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; UGT, uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase;
  LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyandin dioxygenase. Not all
  species (e.g. Arabidopsis) possess the LAR/LDOX route to epicatechin starter units.'
