caption: Schematic of Fas death signalling pathways. Fas, the prototypic member of
  the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) death receptor family, binds to its cognate ligand.
  Recruitment of the adapter molecule FADD and pro-caspase 8 results in activation
  of the latter. Caspase 8 activation directly activates downstream caspases, (3,
  6, and 7) which results in DNA fragmentation and cleavage of cellular proteins.
  This pathway is thought to occur in type I cells and does not involve mitochondrial
  pathways. Caspase 8 activation also results in cleavage of Bid, which translocates
  and interacts with other Bcl-2 family members (see fig 3).
