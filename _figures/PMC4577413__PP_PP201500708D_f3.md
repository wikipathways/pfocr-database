caption: Ethylene (ET) could regulate different nutrient deficiency responses through
  two distinct signal transduction pathways. One pathway is CTR1-EIN2 dependent, and
  the other is CTR1-EIN2 independent (instead, using Arabidopsis His Phosphotransfer
  [AHP] proteins and Arabidopsis Response Regulators [ARRs]; ). This model is supported
  by data showing that ctr1 and ein2 mutants respond to both  and ET inhibitors for
  some physiological responses (, , ; ). It is possible that both pathways can act
  independently (A) or that both can interact and converge downstream through EIN3/EILs
  (B) depending on the responses (). ─╢, Inhibition; →, promotion.
