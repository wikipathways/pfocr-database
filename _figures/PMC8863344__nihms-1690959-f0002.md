caption: Intracellular mechanosensation pathways that accelerate glycolysis. (a) Cytoskeleton
  filaments and their dynamics. (b) Cell-cell adhesion forces are sensed through E-cadherin,
  which forms a complex with and activates liver kinase B1 (LKB1) as well as AMPK.
  AMPK and the membrane-cytoskeletal protein vinculin are phosphorylated by LKB1 and
  tyrosine-protein kinase Abl, respectively. Vinculin activity enhances actin remodelling
  through the Rho/ROCK pathway, whereas AMPK promotes glucose uptake and ATP production
  in order to maintain energy supply to adhesions. (c) Stimulation of receptor tyrosine
  kinases by growth factors activates PI3K, resulting in generation of PIP3, and recruitment
  and activation of GTP-Rac, which promotes actin fibre remodelling. (d) Cell-matrix
  forces are sensed through integrins in focal adhesion complexes, which promote actin
  remodelling through Rho/ROCK and JNK/p38 signaling. Actin fibre remodelling, integrates
  all three signaling pathways, and enhances transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ as
  well as release of glycolytic enzymes in the cytosol. The cytoskeleton also sequesters
  TRIM21 from the cytosol, preventing proteasomal-mediated degradation of PFK. These
  processes culminate in acceleration of glucose metabolism.FAK, focal adhesion kinase;
