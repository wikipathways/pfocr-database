caption: 'Overview of the coenzyme Q biosynthetic pathway. The key step in the pathway
  is the condensation reaction of the polyisoprenoid side-chain from the mevalonate
  pathway with 4-hydroxybenzoate, which is the product of a separate multi-step pathway
  starting from the precursors tyrosine or phenylalanine. Since these precursors are
  in excess compared to the polyisoprenoids, the rate of ubiquinol synthesis is determined
  by the availability of the polyisoprenoid: the conversion of Farnesyl-PP to polyprenyl-pp
  that is catalyzed by enzyme trans-prenyl transferase is the rate limiting step in
  the synthesis of ubiquinol. Ubiquinol consists of a modified benzoquinone ring attached
  to hydrophobic isoprenyl tail that contains 6-10 isoprenyl units depending on species.
  Doted lines represent additional enzymatic steps in the pathway.'
