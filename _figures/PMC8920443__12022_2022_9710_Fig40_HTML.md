caption: Molecular risk triaging of adrenal cortical carcinoma. By recent pan-genomic
  analyses, carcinomas in general adhere to one out of three main clusters (“Cluster
  of Clusters; CoC”) I-III. While CoC I tumors are clinically more indolent and display
  low levels of Wnt/P53 pathway mutations and a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)
  low phenotype, CoC III tumors are considered high risk lesions, and associate to
  a different expressional cluster and carry frequent Wnt/P53 signaling pathway mutations,
  a hypermethylated genome and frequent chromosomal aberrancies, including whole-genome
  doubling. Created with BioRender.com
