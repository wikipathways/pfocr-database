caption: 'Organic nitrates must undergo biotransformation to release a vasoactive
  molecule via one of two pathways: a high potency pathway mediated by ALDH-2, or
  a low potency pathway mediated by other enzymes or low-molecular-weight reductants.
  The high potency pathway is important at clinically relevant nitroglycerin concentrations
  (< 1 μM) and is localized to the mitochondria. The mitochondrial isoform of aldehyde
  dehydrogenase, ALDH-2, was found to be a key enzyme in the biotransformation of
  nitroglycerin via this pathway as it generates inorganic nitrite (NO2−) and 1,2-glyceryl
  dinitrate from nitroglycerin. There are three proposed mechanisms for the release
  of the vasoactive molecule via this pathway: nitrogen oxide(s) is(are) formed via
  reduction of inorganic nitrite; nitric oxide is formed directly in response to interaction
  with ALDH-2; and inorganic nitrite released from mitochondria may be reduced by
  xanthine oxidase in the cytoplasm to form NO. The low potency pathway is important
  at suprapharmacological nitroglycerin concentrations (> 1 μM), is found in the smooth
  endoplasmic reticulum, and leads to formation of measurable amounts of NO in vascular
  tissues. In this pathway, nitroglycerin is biotransformed by proteins such as deoxyhemoglobin,
  deoxymyoglobin, cytrochrome P450, xanthine oxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, or other ALDH isoforms; and by low-molecular-weight reductants such
  as cysteine, N-acetyl-cysteine, thiosalicylic acid, and ascorbate. GTN, glyceryl
