caption: (A) The genetic architecture of epistatically interacting genes shared ppk23
  as a more central node. (B) Whole genes and minSNP genes were not identified in
  more than three analyses, while roughly half or more genes were unique to each analysis.
  (C) Flight performance has a complex genetic architecture, with the key developmental
  gene Egfr and BMP signaling pathway contributing to wing and neurodevelopment. These
  processes are both important for structuring the sensory organs that enable the
  fly to use mechanosensory channels for proprioception. Signals from the sensory
  organs on the wing, head, and body travel to the brain and thoracic ganglion, which
  sends signals through the motor neurons to the direct and indirect flight musculature
  that is also differentially assembled and innervated to generate power and control
  the wing angle during flight.
