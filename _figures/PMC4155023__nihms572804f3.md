caption: 'Growth factor- and cytokine-regulated pathways are activated during liver
  regeneration. A. The growth factor-mediated pathway. Vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF) binds to endothelial cells, which triggers the release of the hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF) precursor, pro-HGF, from stellate cells. The urokinase-type
  plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen proteases cleave pro-HGF, which releases
  HGF. HGF binds to the Met receptor on hepatocytes to activate the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and S6 kinase signal-transduction pathways. HGF signaling releases
  transforming growth factor (TGF) α and other downstream signals that are shared
  with the cytokine-mediated pathway, such as AP1, Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK),
  phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (pERKs), CCAAT-enhancer-binding
  protein (C/EBP) β and insulin-like-growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP) 1. These
  factors are proposed to activate target of rapamycin (TOR), although this remains
  to be established, and this leads to cell-cycle transition by increasing the expression
  of cyclins D and E and reducing p27 levels. B, The cytokine-mediated pathway. Molecules
  that are crucial for innate immunity, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), complement
  factors C3a and C5a and intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), activate Kupffer
  cells, which produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α. This, in turn, up-regulates the
  expression of interleukin (IL)-6 by Kupffer cells. TNFα and IL-6 activate neighboring
  hepatocytes, which causes signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
  3 activation and the expression of stem-cell factor (SCF) and several proteins that
  are shared with the growth factor-mediated pathway. Various inhibitory proteins
  that are important for terminating liver regeneration are also activated (shown
  in orange), including TGFβ (which is produced by stellate cells), plasminogen activator
  inhibitor (PAI), suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) and p27 and other cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitors, and their effects on the two pathways are shown. Cell-surface
  receptors are shown in red. Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Limited:
