caption: Expression levels of differentially expressed genes related to galactose,
  starch and sucrose metabolism. (a) The biosynthetic and metabolic pathway for galactose,
  starch and sucrose. (b) Regulatory network of galactose, starch and sucrose biosynthesis
  and metabolism. The pink circle shows the top 10 genes identified by the CytoHubba
  algorithm. (c) Determination and characterization of DEMs content implicated in
  galactose, starch and sucrose biosynthesis and metabolism. The color scale from
  green to orange demonstrates expression values ranging from low to high. The column
  diagram depicts the mean metabolite content, with error bars reflecting the standard
  deviation (SD) of the means at n = 3. Different lowercase letters denote significant
  differences between months (p < 0.05)
