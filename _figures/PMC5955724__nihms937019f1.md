caption: A working model for Eph receptor function in tumor promotion and tumor suppression.
  In normal cells, engagement of Eph receptors with ephrins on adjacent cells in trans
  induces receptor forward signaling, leading to inhibition of Ras/mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) activity, or suppression of Crk activation via Abl kinase
  activity, and tumor suppression. In tumor cells, disruption of cell-cell junctions
  inhibits Eph receptor interaction with endogenous ephrins in trans. In addition,
  Eph receptors are often upregulated whereas ephrins are downregulated. Crosstalk
  between Eph receptors and other receptor tyrosine kinases such as ErbB2 and epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) results in increased activity of the Ras-MAPK pathway
  and the RhoA GTPase, and enhanced tumor malignancy ().
