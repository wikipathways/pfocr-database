caption: Sphingomyelinases cleave sphingomyelin (represented as small circles around
  the membrane) to ceramide in response to different extracellular insults. Once ceramide
  is generated, different downstream targets including death-associated protein kinase
  (DAPK), kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), protein kinase C (PKC) ζ, Rac, inducible
  nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (CAPP), and
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are activated and the release of cytochrome C is augmented.
  On the other hand, the anti-apoptotic Akt - Bcl2 pathway is down-regulated. All
  these events eventually lead to apoptosis.
