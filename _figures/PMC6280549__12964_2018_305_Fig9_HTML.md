caption: Model of the functions of Jumu in filopodium formation and circulating hemocyte
  phagocytosis. a Normal expression of Jumu maintains the levels of NimC1, Enabled
  and Fascin in a direct or indirect manner. Enabled and Fascin participate in filopodium
  formation. The phagocytosis receptor NimC1 is involved in the recognition of pathogens
  and the subcellular localization of Ena. b Deficiency of Jumu reduces the protein
  levels of NimC1, Enabled and Fascin and consequently inhibits filopodium formation
  and hemocyte phagocytosis. c Severe deficiency of jumu can inhibit normal hemocyte
  mitosis and result in enlarged multinucleated hemocytes. The loss of jumu may control
  the cell cycle and mitosis process by affecting the expression of the Cyclin genes
  png and piwi. Severe deficiency of jumu also induces the generation of lamellocytes
  through the activation of the Toll signaling pathway
