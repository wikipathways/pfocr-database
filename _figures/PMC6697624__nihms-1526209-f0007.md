caption: Drug-paired cues (tone and light) increase MMP-9 activity through spillover
  of synaptic glutamate and increased nitric oxide production (not shown, see(, )).
  MMP-9 catalytically exposes RGD binding domains during 15 min of cued cocaine seeking.
  RGD binds to and stimulates β3 integrin subunit to phosphorylate FAK, which initiates
  spine head expansion (dh) and increases in AMPA:NMDA. How FAK signals to t-SP was
  not studied (indicate by ?), but FAK promotes LIMK phosphorylation() to inactive
  cofilin via Ser3 phosphorylation and thereby promote elongation of F-actin to increase
  spine dh. Also β3 integrin-dependent increases in AMPA currents may arise from stabilizing
  GluA2 subunit containing AMPA receptors through a protein complex between β3 and
  GluA2 ().
