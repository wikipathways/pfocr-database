caption: The mechanism for TgSAG1 regulating T. gondii invasion and host immunityAs
  a surface antigen, TgSAG1 could bind host protein S100A6 for attaching to and invading
  host cells. During T. gondii invasion, TgSAG1 could regulate the interaction between
  S100A6 and vimentin, then for cytoskeleton organization. In addition, as an immunomodulatory
  factor, TgSAG1 could regulate the expression of TNFα through S100A6-vimentin/PKCθ-NF-κB
  signaling pathway.
