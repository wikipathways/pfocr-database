caption: Eicosanoid metabolism is preferentially increased in MIBC as compared to
  NMIBC. The de novo pathway of NAD+ synthesis is enhanced, whereas the salvage pathway
  is repressed in more advanced urothelial carcinoma. Increased activity of COX and
  LOX pathways suggests a potential role for inflammatory mediators in MIBC.
