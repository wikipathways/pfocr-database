caption: Similarities of genes or signaling pathways critical in embryonic mammary
  gland development and processes in breast cancer. (A) Key stages in embryonic mammary
  gland development and genes and their associated pathways involved in the respective
  stages. For MR-specific developmental processes that are regulated by relevant genes
  and signaling pathways, please refer to main text. (B,C,D) Processes that are linked
  to tumorigenesis and metastasis and mediated by the same genes or signaling pathways
  important for embryonic mammary gland development. Genes in the same signaling pathway
  are coded in the same colour. Figure created with BioRender.
