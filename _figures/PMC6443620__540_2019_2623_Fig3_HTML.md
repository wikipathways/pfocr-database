caption: The hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway. Volatile anesthetics
  has been shown to activate or suppress HIF-1 system. HIF-1 is a heterodimer that
  consists of HIF-1α (120 kDa) and HIF-1β (91–94 kDa), HIF1β is expressed constitutively
  in all cells and remains stable regardless of oxygen tension. At normoxia conditions,
  HIF-1α combines with the tumor-suppressor Von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) protein through
  a hydroxylated proline residue and is then hydroxylated by prolyl-4-hydroxylases
  (PHD) in the cytoplasm, and this interaction causes HIF-1α to be ubiquitinated and
  to be targeted by proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Under hypoxic conditions,
  oxygen deficiency inhibits the activity of prolyl hydroxylases and leads to the
  accumulation of HIF-1α. Production of HIF-1α is controlled by PI-3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  and partially influenced by MAPK pathway, phophorylation of AKT and mTOR leads to
  translation of HIF-1α. HIF-1α is translocated into the cell nuclear and together
  with HIF-1β bind to hypoxia-response elements (HREs). A broad range of protective
  pathways is activated, which regulate several aspects of cellular activities, such
  as angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, cell proliferation, cell survival and energy metabolism.
