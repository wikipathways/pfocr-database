caption: Anaplerosis pathway via PC and ATP citrate lyase and the acetoacetate pathway
  via succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase of acyl
  group transfer from mitochondria to the cytosol for (phospho)lipid synthesis in
  the beta cell. ACAA1 and -2, acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 and 2, respectively; ACAT1
  and -2, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 and 2, respectively; PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex; SCOT, succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase; PC, pyruvate carboxylase
  (left) and phosphatidylcholine (right); CDP-DAG, cytidine diphosphide-diacylglycerol;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Gly-3-P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  PA, phosphatidic acid. The intracellular locations of steps of synthesis of individual
  phospholipids occur in several organelles. The intracellular locations of phospholipid
  syntheses are not depicted in this figure.
