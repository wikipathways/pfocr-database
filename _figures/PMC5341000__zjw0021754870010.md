caption: 'Proposed scheme for the role of male sex on energy metabolism in the diabetic
  kidney. By integrating our proteomic findings with previous transcriptomics data
  using bioinformatics tools, and supported by the corresponding in vitro and in vivo
  validation studies, we propose a model of interconnected enzymes, metabolites, biological
  processes, and pathophysiological events increased by male sex hormones and diabetes
  within the renal tubule. Red arrows indicate effects of DHT or male sex relevant
  to diabetes and demonstrated in the present study. Gray arrows depict hypothetical
  connections that have not been investigated in the present work. Green boxes indicate
  validated proteins in our study. Gray and blue boxes indicate significantly enriched
  biological processes and cellular components in our gene ontology analysis, respectively.
  Yellow boxes indicate processes that emerged from our functional enrichment analysis.
  Orange boxes indicate physiological events triggered by impaired energy metabolism
  observed in DKD and accentuated by androgens in the present study. FFA, free fatty
  acids; α-KG, alpha-ketoglutarate; OAA, oxaloacetate; HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway: FAO, fatty acid beta-oxidation.'
