caption: Mechanism of insulin resistance induced by HFSD plus agents. HFSD may render
  toxic accumulation by promoting excessive production of FFA and removal of glucose
  in the blood, triggering the p38 inflammation signaling pathway to release TNFα
  and IL6, which may interfere with IRS regular phosphorylation, reduce PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway activity and failure of GLUTs expression. Otherwise, HFSD is able to induce
  compensated secretion of insulin, as its function has been impaired, which may lead
  to insulin deficiency. In addition, STZ and AON are able to destroy some islet β
  cells which may result in a deficiency of insulin. IP, intraperitoneal; IM, intramuscular;
  ND, normal diet; AON, alloxan monohydrate; STZ, streptozotocin; HFSD, high fat and
  sugar diet; GLU, glucose; FFA, free fatty acid; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; IL6, interleukin 6; IRS, insulin receptor
  substrate 1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; GLUTs, glucose transporters; IR, insulin
  resistance.
