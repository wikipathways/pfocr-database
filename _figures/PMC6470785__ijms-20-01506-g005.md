caption: 'Metabolic and signaling pathway crosstalk in tissues of animals with high
  inherent aerobic capacity (HIAC) and animals with low inherent aerobic capacity
  (LIAC). (A) Greater fatty acid oxidation is upregulated by activity of AMPK and
  SIRT1 at the expense of glucose metabolism. Acetyl-CoA from TCA and β-oxidation
  activate PDK and impedes glycolysis from glucose oxidation by inhibiting PDH, whereas
  post TCA citrate inhibits HK and PFK attenuating glycolysis and undergoes ACLY-mediated
  conversion into acetyl-CoA. Further carboxylation of cytosolic acetyl-CoA into malonyl
  CoA is impeded by AMPK-induced inhibition of ACC. AMPK also downregulates lipogenesis
  (FASN, ACC) by inhibiting mTOR-SREBP-1 pathway and induces glucose uptake by upregulating
  GLUTs. SREBP-1 is also downregulated by SIRT1 which is in crosstalk with AMPK. In
  addition, inactive SRC, STAT3, AKT and PKA-CREB factors and corresponding signaling
  pathways are associated with HIAC tissues. Altogether, such metabolic and signaling
  pattern leads to cell cycle arrest (via p21 and p27), induction of apoptosis (via
  increase in BAX and decrease in BCL-2 levels), as well as increase in mitochondrial
  function (via PGC 1α); (B) glucose metabolism is upregulated in LIAC tissues at
  the expense of fatty acid oxidation leading to production of ROS and anabolic metabolism:
  AKT signaling induces glycolysis via GLUTs, HK, PFK; GLUTs are also induced by AKT-mTOR-mediated
  upregulation of HIF-1α and c-MYC factors; AKT-mTOR-SREBP1-stimulated ACLY and ACC
  promotes conversion of malonyl-CoA which inhibits CPT-1 and subsequent β oxidation
  of fatty acids. In turn, AKT-mTOR-SREBP1-stimulated FASN utilizes malonyl-CoA and
  increases lipogenesis. AKT is downstream target of SRC and FAK which can affect
  activity of one another. SRC also activates STAT3 and ERK1/2. cAMP, produced from
  stimulation of β2-AR stimulation, activates EPAC-1, which also activates ERK1/2.
  cAMP also activates PKA. Common downstream target of AKT, ERK1/2, and PKA is CREB.
  All of these as well as Notch signaling pathway induce angiogenesis (via VEGF),
  cell cycle progression (via stimulation of cyclin D and inhibition of p21 and p27)
  and downregulate apoptosis (by inducing BCL-2 and lowering BAX). Factors detected
  in our experimental analyses are depicted in orange, whereas those obtained from
  literature analyses are in gray.'
