caption: 'Molecular interactions between Wnt/β-catenin and PPARγ signaling in colorectal
  cancer cells. The Wnt/β-catenin and PPARγ signal transduction pathways likely act
  in a coordinated manner to ensure epithelial cells a balance between growth and
  differentiation. In this condition, β-catenin is targeted by PPARγ for phosphorylation
  and subsequent degradation. In CRC, the Wnt pathway is generally overactive and
  β-catenin is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus to activate Wnt target genes.
  In a “Wnt on” state, PPARγ protein is generally elevated likely due to high β-catenin
  levels. The selective inhibition of PPARγ target genes expression may be ascribed
  to different mechanisms: interaction of β-catenin with PPARγ-associated transcriptional
  complexes recruited on the DNA that results in transcription inhibition or in squelching
  of critical PPARγ coactivators through the alternative binding with β-catenin. Our
  data and those already published suggest a hypothetical model whereby a ligand-bound
  PPARγ suppresses Wnt/β-catenin signaling in a cancer-cell context dependent manner
  by: (1) activating transcription of its own target genes; (2) facilitating the GSK3β-dependent
  degradation of β-catenin; and (3) competing in the nucleus with transcription factors
  such as LEF/TCFs in blocking prosurvival β-catenin target genes also in cells harboring
  a mutated APC.'
