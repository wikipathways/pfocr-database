caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) in liver cancer
  development. A: Signaling pathways related to FGF19 activation in liver cancer development.
  Binding of FGF19 to its co-receptor β-Klotho and FGFR4, FGF19-FGFR4 activated downstream
  signaling, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mechanistic target
  of rapamycin (mTOR), RAS/extracellular signal–regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway,
  leading to cell growth and proliferation, and had an effect on protein and glycogen
  synthesis, which are often activated in liver cancer. The blue arrow indicates activation,
  and the red blunt line indicates inhibition. B: The network between FGF19 and EGFR
  was analyzed with LENS. The nodes in the network were taken from the pathway involved
  in FGF19 and EGFR in the patient analysis with cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org):
