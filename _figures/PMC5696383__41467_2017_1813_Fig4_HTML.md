caption: Complete biosynthetic pathway of helvolic acid. Biosynthesis of helvolic
  acid includes nine steps from the universal triterpenoid progenitor (3 S)-2,3-oxidosqualene.
  Following the cyclization to the tetracyclic protosta-17(20)Z,24-dien-3β-ol (2)
  by HelA, HelB1-mediated and HelB2-mediated oxidation at C-4 and C-16, HelD2-dependent
  acetylation of 16-OH, oxidation of C-21 by HelB4, and HelC-dependent oxidative decarboxylation
  yield the fusidane skeleton 14, which is further modified in three additional steps
  mediated by HelB3, HelD1, and HelE to give helvolic acid. The premature decarboxylation
  (or dehydrogenation) by HelC prevents HelB1-mediated, HelB2-mediated, HelD2-mediated,
  and HelB4-mediated tailoring
