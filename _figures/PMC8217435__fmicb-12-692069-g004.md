caption: Interference of BTV gene products with the IFN response. (A) BTV uses multiple
  gene products to impair IFN induction. NS3 has been shown to impair TBK1 activation
  by targeting the ubiquitin-binding protein Optineurin responsible for TBK1 translocation
  to the Golgi apparatus, where TBK1 activation by trans-autophosphorylation takes
  places. NS4 has been shown to impair IFN promoter gene activity in reporter assays.
  VP3 has been shown to interact with MAVS and IKKε to interfere with IFN induction.
  VP4 has been reported to interfere with IFN induction, but the mechanism has yet
  to be clarified. Finally the putative NS5 has been shown to interfere with the activity
  of multiple promoters including the IFN-β promoter. (B) BTV also uses multiple gene
  products to interfere with IFN signaling. NS3 can target STAT2 for degradation through
  an autophagic/lysosomal pathway. NS3 can also interfere with STAT1 phosphorylation.
  NS4 and NS3 appear to coordinately impair STAT1 phosphorylation by binding to STAT1
  SH2 domain. NS4 can also interfere with the ISRE and GAS promoter activity. Finally,
  the putative NS5 can impair the activity of multiple promoters and thus possibly
  impair ISRE and GAS promoter activity. (?) denotes unknown or speculative mechanisms.
