caption: Plausible mechanism meditating RIPC effect in H1-receptor-expressing DMV
  neuronsSchematic of histamine 1 receptor (H1)-expressing neuron highlighting potential
  mechanism based upon differential gene expression of receptors, intracellular effectors,
  and neuropeptides. Genes that are uniquely expressed in the H1-expressing neurons
  of the RIPC cohort compared with non-H1-expressing neurons from the RIPC group and
  compared with the H1 neurons of the naive and sham cohorts. Brain regions likely
  acting on the receptors shown are shown along the top above the brackets. All pathway
  information was derived from literature inferences with several pathway connections
  representing multiple steps and intermediaries. The combination of genes expressed
  suggests an increase in calcium influx that Gq signaling that drive the production
  and release of norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic peptide, and tachykinins from
  DMV efferent neurons to contribute to cardioprotection derived from remote ischemic
  preconditioning (RIPC). 5-HTR 6, serotonin receptor 6; M3, muscarinic acetylcholine
