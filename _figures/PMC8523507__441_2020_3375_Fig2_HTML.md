caption: 'Lysosomal biogenesis is thought to occur through four different routes.
  In the maturation pathway, endocytosed cargo is first delivered to early endosomes,
  which progressively mature to late endosomes, endo-lysosomes, and subsequently into
  lysosomes. Thereby, endocytosis starts with the invagination of cargo-bound plasma
  membrane by either clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent mechanisms. In the
  vesicular transport pathway, endosomal carrier vesicles/multivesicular bodies (MVBs)
  transfer cargo from early to late endosomes to lysosomes or directly from the matured
  late endosomes to lysosomes. In the fusion and fission pathway, the limiting membrane
  of late endosomes/MVBs and lysosomes fuses to form hybrid organelles, where the
  degradation of endocytosed macromolecules commences. These hybrid organelles subsequently
  reform to lysosomes. In the “kiss and run” pathway, late endosomes form a contact
  site (“kiss”) with lysosomes, transfer cargo and subsequently dissociate (“run”)
  again. Resident lysosomal proteins are synthesized in the ER. Sorting to lysosomes
  occurs through multiple pathways. 1. Most acid hydrolases are delivered to lysosomes
  via a mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) dependent ER-to-lysosome trafficking pathway. M6P
  modified proteins are recognized by M6P receptors (MPRs) in the trans-Golgi network
  (TGN), which forms small vesicles that carry lysosomal resident proteins. These
  vesicles fuse with late endosomes, the acidic environment of which causes dissociation
  of MPR from the cargos. While the MPRs recycle back to the TGN, lysosomal proteins
  continue their journey to lysosomes. 2. Lysosomal transmembrane proteins are either
  sorted directly from the ER-TGN to endosomes and lysosomes or indirectly, i.e.,
  they are first sorted to the cell surface from where they enter the endocytic pathway.
  Both these direct and indirect routes rely on clathrin-coated vesicles to carry
  the proteins from the TGN or plasma membrane to the endosomes. Abbreviations: EE = early
