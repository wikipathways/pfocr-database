caption: Interactions between proteins, cells, and lentiviral infection for the GIMAP2
  gene in PBNCs, as analyzed by the Pathway Studio program []. Blue highlights upregulation
  in SRLV-SP goats vs. SRLV-SN goats; GIMAP2—GTPase, IMAP family member 2; GIMAP7—GTPase,
  IMAP family member 7 (GIMAP7 -> GIMAP2 can stimulate both its own GTPase activity
  and that of GIMAP2 by dimerization and the provision of a catalytic arginine finger);
  DNM1L—dynamin-1-like protein (gene encodes a member of the dynamin superfamily of
  GTPases); SLC7A7—solute carrier family 7 member 7 (regulates 11 gene expression
  signature genes, including GIMAP2, IL10RA, and IL18as); IL7R—interleukin 7 receptors
  (->Regulation IL7R->GIMAP2; the signal given by IL-7/IL-7R affects the regulation
  of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and differentiation, cell type CD4+ T cell);
  GDP—guanosine diphosphate; GTP—guanosine triphosphate; IL7—interleukin 7; CD4+ T-cell—T-cell
  surface glycoprotein CD4 precursor (this gene encodes a membrane glycoprotein of
  T lymphocytes that interacts with major histocompatibility complex class II antigens
  and is also a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus).
