caption: Proposed Model for a SAL1-PAP Retrograde Signaling Pathway.PAP levels are
  negatively regulated by the chloroplastic SAL1 phosphatase ( to ). Upon environmental
  stresses, such as HL and drought, PAP levels increase (). PAP can move between cellular
  compartments as evidenced by the complementation studies (). Elevated PAP levels
  likely inhibit XRNs in the cytosol and nucleus. Nuclear XRN inhibition causes similar
  changes in expression to sal1 mutants, such as ELIP2 and APX2, and a degree of drought
  tolerance ( to , ).[See online article for color version of this figure.]
