caption: Schematic representation of important metabolism-related cellular signaling
  cascades where FKBP51 was shown to play a decisive role (see main text for further
  details). (A) FKBP51 interacts with HSP90 and several steroid receptors (SR), including
  the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and thereby
  modulates SR ligand sensitivity, translocation and function. Among the genes that
  are regulated by glucocorticoids (GCs) via MR/GR activation is Fkbp5, thereby forming
  an ultra-short feedback loop. At the same time, FKBP5 has been shown to interact
  with other signaling pathways, thereby affecting cellular function in a cell-type
  specific manner , , . (B) In fat tissue, FKBP51 was shown to affect PPARγ signaling
  and adipogenesis (not depicted) , . In addition, an effect of UCP1 and consequently
  browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) has been postulated , . (C) In muscle cells,
  FKBP51 interacts with AKT2 in the insulin signaling pathway, ultimately modulating
  cellular glucose uptake . (D) In the brain, FKBP51 was shown to regulate autophagy
  via interaction with Beclin1 .
