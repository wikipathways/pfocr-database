caption: The PPI network of HT consists of 43 nodes, 234 edges, an average node degree
  of 17, and a high-confidence interaction (0.7; ). Furthermore, hub proteins were
  selected from the PPI network based on their degree score () including one DTP (PPARG).
  These results indicated that the biological effect of hesperetin is strongly correlated
  with PPARG. GO analysis of HT was classified into three groups, consisting of biological
  process, cellular component and molecular function (). HT was found to participate
  in the biological processes of cell cycle and cell proliferation. The HT is located
  in the nucleoplasm, cytosol extracellular matrix, and cytoplasm. Moreover, the HT
  has a molecular function in cyclin-dependent protein kinase regulator and inhibitor
  activity. KEGG-pathway enrichment analysis showed 21 pathways regulated by HT (),
  including the cell cycle, and TGF-beta, PPAR, Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways.
