caption: Exogenous LPS directly leads to an increase in the production of white adhesion
  molecules and other cytokines such as ICAM-1 and vWF. In addition, LPS activates
  MAPK, PI3K/Akt and other downstream signaling pathways, producing IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α
  and other inflammatory factors, and excessive oxidative stress leads to a significant
  amount of NO production. Activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway produces
  the same effect. Conversely, NRG-1/ErbBs may attenuate or inhibit these processes.
  It serves a protective role in myocardial cell structure, inhibits apoptosis and
  oxidative stress and decreases inflammation. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ICAM-1, intercellular
  adhesion molecule 1; vWF, von Willebrand factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; IL, interleukin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor; NO, nitric oxide; NRG-1,
  neuregulin-1; rhNRG-1, recombinant human NRG-1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLR4,
  toll-like receptor 4; rhNRG-1, recombinant human NRG-1; RhoA/ROCK, transforming
  protein Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase.
