caption: Network analysis visualization for mycorrhizal effects on the JA and ET pathways
  in response to herbivory. Tomato leaves from non-mycorrhizal (Nm) and F. mosseae
  mycorrhizal (Fm) plants, uninfested (No herb) or infested for 24 h by S. exigua
  or M. sexta (S. exigua, M. sexta). Insight into the network of physical interactions
  between the signaling network components. Nodes represent tomato protein-coding
  genes, and the node color shows regulation after the applied treatment, without
  significance filtering (red=up-regulation, blue=down-regulation). Connection type
  is shown as different line types (dashed=transcriptional regulation; solid=binding
  or synthesis); line arrows show the mode of action (arrow=activation; T=inhibition;
  half-circle=unknown)
