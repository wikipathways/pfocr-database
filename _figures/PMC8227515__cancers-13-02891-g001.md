caption: 'General metabolism of serine, glycine, glutamate, and glutamine. Overview
  of the possible metabolic pathways relevant to anabolism, redox and nitrogen homeostasis,
  and energy production. Metabolites specific to the brain, relevant to this review,
  are also included in red. For clarity, only two enzymes are reported: phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase (PHGDH), responsible for the serine synthesis pathway (SSP), a branch
  of glycolysis and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), responsible for the reversible
  conversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) into glycine and 5,10-methylene-THF;
  SHMT isoforms are present in mitochondria (SHMT2) and cytosol (SHMT1), respectively.
  These enzymes fuel one carbon metabolism (1C in the figure), which is closely connected
  to the folate and methionine cycles. Glutamine also contributes to the production
  of purines, pyrimidines and amino sugars, as well as of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH, not shown) [,], which, in turn, is used to maintain glutathione
  in its reduced state, thus keeping oxidative stress under control. As a carbon source,
  glutamine plays a fundamental role in mitochondrial metabolism, supplying the TCA
  cycle with anaplerotic carbons, accounting for ATP and macromolecules synthesis.
  The indications “Protein” refer to protein biosynthesis. Serine-derived metabolites
  include sphingosine and phosphoserine; glycine-derived metabolites include bile
  acids, heme and creatine; glutamate-derived metabolites include amino acids and
  polyglutamylate folates (only most relevant metabolites are listed, not necessarily
  populated in the same cell).'
