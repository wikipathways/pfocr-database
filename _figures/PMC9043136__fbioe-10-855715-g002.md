caption: 'Overview of the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H dependent reactions in central carbon metabolic
  modules (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, and Entner-Doudoroff
  pathway) and heterologous redox cofactor regeneration systems commonly used to fuel
  redox-intensive production processes. Green arrows and red arrows indicate reactions,
  which have been upregulated and downregulated/deleted, respectively, to promote/improve
  redox intensive production schemes. Enzyme names are accompanied by their abbreviations
  as cited in the text. Respective genes are: the PPP genes zwf (glucose 6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, G6PDH) and gnd (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, 6PGD) both encoding
  NADPH forming enzymes (; ; ); the glycolytic genes pgi (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase,
  GPI), pfkA/B (phosphofructokinase I/II, PFK), and gapA (G3P dehydrogenase, GAPDH);
  the TCA cycle genes maeA/B (malic enzyme, ME) and icd (Isocitrate dehydrogenase,
  IDH). The symbol (* ) denotes enzymes that can be exchanged with functionally equivalent
  isozymes but with different cofactor preference (i.e., NADP+-dependent variants
  of aldehyde dehydrogenase and GAPDH). The symbol (** ) denotes reactions that have
  been either activated or deactivated depending on the envisaged redox related metabolic
  engineering target, as in the case of isocitrate lyase and succinyl-coA synthetase.
  With activated glyoxylate shunt, more malate is formed which in turn can be converted
  to pyruvate by the ME involving NADPH formation. In order to promote α-KG dependent
  redox biotransformations, the glyoxylate shunt has been deactivated forcing metabolic
  flux through the introduced enzyme (e.g., proline or isoleucine dioxygenases). Succinyl-CoA
  synthetase activity significantly promotes NADPH allocation (via IDH) for NADPH-dependent
  syntheses (e.g., xylitol production). On the other hand, deletion or reduction of
  this activity promotes α-KG-dependent redox biotransformations.'
