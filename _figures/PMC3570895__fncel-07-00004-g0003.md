caption: Typical signal transduction from the ErbB4:ErbB1 and ErbB4:ErbB4 complex.
  Once ErbB1 is phosphorylated by the partner ErbB, the following signal cascades
  are activated; (1) In the PLCγ-PKC pathway, phosphorylated ErbB1 recruits and associates
  with PLCγ. As a result, PLCγ itself is phosphorylated to activate DAG/IP3 signaling
  (Chen et al., ). (2) In the Ras-MAPK pathway, phosphorylated ErbB1 associates with
  Shc and interacts with Grb2/Sos1. Activated Sos1 triggers GDP/GTP exchange in Ras
  and activates Ras, driving the sequential kinase reactions of Raf(MAPKKK), MEK(MAPKK),
  and Erk(MAPK). (3) In the PI3K-Akt pathway, the activated ErbB dimer interacts with
  Grb2/Gab1 and forms complexes with activated PI3Kinase, leading to the conversion
  of PIP2 to PIP3 and Akt activation. (4) In the JAK-STAT pathway, ErbB kinase phosphorylates
  and induces JAK to bind to ErbB1. Activated JAK phosphorylates STAT and allows STAT
  to homodimerize and translocate into the nucleus. Once ErbB4 is phosphorylated by
  ErbB4, the signaling cascades linked to differentiation become activated, notably
  the PI3K-Akt pathway and the Ras-MAPK pathway with longer durations.
