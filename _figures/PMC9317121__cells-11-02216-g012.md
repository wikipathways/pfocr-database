caption: BMP signaling is inhibited by BMP antagonists during tooth development. The
  antagonists include noggin, gremlin, chordin, chordin-like 1, chordin-like 2, and
  others. Noggin interacts with BMPs or Wnt ligands and prevents the binding of BMPs
  to their receptors and Wnt-Frizzled receptors, consequently blocking their signaling
  and impairing dentin development and formation. Gremlin and chordin, chordin-like
  1, and chordin-like 2 also bind to BMPs and interfere with dentinogenesis via canonical
  Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways. →, activation; ┤, inhibition. Wnt, wingless
