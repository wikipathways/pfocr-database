caption: 'Perspective model of regeneration-competent adult mammalian central nervous
  system axons.Manipulation of mTOR pathway, centrally involved in protein synthesis,
  results in one of the most robust effects on axon regeneration. Several transcription
  factors (TFs) that control the cell differentiation/de-differentiation status are
  pivotal in axon regeneration. In addition to these two kinds of well-known players,
  direct modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane traffic has been shown to
  play critical roles in axon regrowth after injury, including TC10 signal (shown
  in red) and Rab11 signal (shown in blue). A complex of TC10 and Exo70 (a component
  of the exocyst tethering complex) is essential for membrane addition at the growth
  cones. TC10 also limits axon retraction through microtubule stabilization at the
  growth cone neck. We presume that PAK, one of TC10 effectors, could phosphorylate
  and inactivate the microtubule destabilizing protein stathmin there. Active Rab11
  binds to kinesin through FIP adaptor molecules and regulates anterograde transport
  of recycling endosomes. Black lines: microtubules. Orange two-way arrows: microtubule
  bunding and stabilization. Gradient orange lightning: axon injury. TFs: Transcription
  factors.'
