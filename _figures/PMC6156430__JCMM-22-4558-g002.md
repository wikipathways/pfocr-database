caption: A schematic diagram of the molecular mechanisms underlying K63‐linked polyubiquitination
  and cardiac hypertrophy. In TNF‐α pathway, TNFR recruits its adaptor protein TRADD
  in response to binding of TNF‐α. TRADD further recruits TRAF2, TRAF5 and RIP1 to
  the receptor complex. TRAF2/5‐mediated K63 polyubiquitination of RIP1 further recruits
  TAB2 and TAK1 in the cytoplasm, which activates TAK1 by phosphorylation. The activated
  RIP1‐TAK1‐TAB2 complex subsequently promotes activation of MEKKs, which in turn
  activates the MAP kinase kinases, culminating in MAPK activation (JNK, ERK and p38),
  and activates p38 and JNK. These terminal kinases then proceed to phosphorylate
  transcription factors within the nucleus, as well as other regulatory proteins in
  the nucleus. And also K63 polyubiquitination chains of NEMO increases the activity
  of IKK complex which leads to IκBα‐dependent activation of NF‐κB pathway. The TNF‐α
  pathway is regulated by deubiquitinases A20 and CYLD
