caption: BCM evokes superoxide formation through the TCA cycle or envelope stress
  response pathway, which is converted to hydroxy radicals through the Fenton reaction.
  Hydroxyl radicals and the collision between TEC and replisome cause DSBs in the
  E. coli genome. At the DSBs, RecA protein is recruited and SOS response is induced.
  Because of the SOS response, cell division is halted and cells become filamented.
  kil expression after Rho inhibition inhibits FtsZ function, leading to cell filamentation
