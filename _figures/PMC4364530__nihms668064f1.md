caption: 'Mouse models with defects in OXPHOS complexes subunits, electron carriers
  and assembly factors are summarized in the figure. In light green are represented
  the mouse models related to subunits of the electron transport chain (ND6, NDUFA5,
  NDUFS4, NDUFS6, SDHD, UQCRFS1, COX1, COX4, COX6a and COX7a), the electron carriers
  ubiquinone (UQ) or CoQ and cytochrome c (Cytc). In light blue are the mouse models
  of enzymes of the CoQ biosynthetic pathway (PDSS2 and CoQ9). In light pink are represented
  those mouse models of assembly factors for CIII and CIV (BCS1L, SURF1,SCO2, COX10,
  COX15, and COX17) and in red the mouse models of IF1, the natural inhibitor of CV.OMM:
