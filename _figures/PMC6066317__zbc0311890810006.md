caption: Potential role of PtkA and their unusual IDD in the M. tuberculosis virulence.
  Left, role of the MptpA in the Mtb virulence. MptpA interacts with the host endogenous
  signaling pathway upon binding to the H subunit of the vacuolar proton pump (V-H+ATPase)
  and dephosphorylation of human VPS33B, being a part of the homotypic fusion and
  protein-sorting (HOPS) complexes. Dephosphorylation of VPS33B suppresses the phagosome–lysosome
  fusion and promotes Mtb persistency. The mechanism of migration of MptpA from the
  cytosol of Mtb to the macrophage cytosol trough the mycobacterial cell wall is unknown.
  Right, schematic representation of Mtb, including its complex cell wall structure
  (according to Ref. ) and the role of PtkA and its unusual IDD. IDD of PtkA regulates
  the accessibility of the autophosphorylation site, which is located in the KCD.
  Long-range transient interactions between those domains generate an open and closed
  state of PtkA, which control the protein autoactivity. PTM of IDD promotes the open
  state of PtkA, increasing its ability to autophosphorylate. High active PtkA regulates
  the phosphorylation of MptpA, thereby modulating MptpA activity () and possibly
  contributing to its translocation trough the mycobacterial cell wall. On the other
  hand, the presence of IDD in the PtkA structure can play a role in the subcellular
  relocalization of PtkA to the cell membrane. The translocation of PtkA can be triggered
  by the autophosphorylation of the KCD or post-translational multisite phosphorylation
  of IDD. Right corner, the dynamic behavior of IDD in response to change in pH ().
