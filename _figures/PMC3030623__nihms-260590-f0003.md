caption: 'The functions of four proteins, TcsA, TcsB, TcsC and TcsD, are deduced to
  be, respectively: an acyl transferase (AT) and acyl carrier protein (ACP) complex,
  a β-keto-acyl synthase (KS), a 2-pentenoyl-ACP carboxylase/reductase, and an acyl-ACP
  dehydrogenase. Bold lines indicate the biosynthetic steps characterized in vitro.
  Propylmalonyl- and allylmalonyl-ACPs are presumed to be converted to 8 and 9, respectively,
  by an unidentified ACP:CoA transacylase-like enzyme. The previously proposed biosynthetic
  pathway to 8 from odd-chain fatty acids is shown in dashed lines. KSN and KSC represent
  the N-terminal and C-terminal KS domains of TcsB, respectively.'
