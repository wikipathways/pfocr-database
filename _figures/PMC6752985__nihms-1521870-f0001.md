caption: Upon activation by growth factors, PI3-K recruitment to a receptor tyrosine
  kinase leads to a transient increase in PIP3 levels. This phospholipid serves as
  an anchor point to recruit Akt1 to the plasma membrane where it undergoes phosphorylation
  at residues Thr308 and Ser473 by PDK1 and mTORC2, respectively. In addition, the
  more recently identified dual phosphorylations at residues Ser477 and Thr479 by
  Cdk2 that may occur in the cell nucleus can be an alternative mechanism for activating
  Akt1. Once activated, Akt1–3 phosphorylate downstream substrates that are involved
  in a diverse of cellular functions. Several of the well-characterized Akt1–3 substrates
  including FoxO, GSK3, TSC2 and PRAS40 are shown. P indicates phosphorylation.
