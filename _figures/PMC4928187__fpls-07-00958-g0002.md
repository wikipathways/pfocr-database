caption: 'A map of lipid metabolic pathways in C. merolae based on the results of

  of subcellular localization analysis (Figure , Supplementary Figures ). Enzyme name
  is indicated in blue. Locus tag of the genes encoded in the nuclear and the plastid
  genomes are shown in red and green, respectively. Fatty acids are represented by
  a combination of the number of carbon atom [X] and the number of double bonds [Y],
  such as X:Y. The number in the parenthesis indicates position of double bonds. Dashed
  line indicates flow of transport of substrates. In the plastidic fatty acid synthesis,
  it is possible that acetyl-CoA:ACP acetyltransferase (ACAT) converts acetyl-CoA
  to acetyl-ACP in the initial condensation reaction (see Discussion), although putative
  ACAT was not detected from the genomic data in C. merolae. Some enzymes related
  to mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis, mitochondrial enoyl-CoA reductase (mtEAR),
  mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (mtHAD), and mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl-ACP
  reductase (mtKAR), have not been identified either in plants or in C. merolae. In
  the synthesis of glycolipids and PG, phosphatidylglycerolphosphate phosphatase was
  not detected in the genomic data of C. merolae. No PAP candidates were localized
  in the plastid in C. merolae. Putative FAD4 enzyme is included in this figure, although
  its localization could not be experimentally determined. In C. merolae, linoleoyl-CoA
  is synthesized in the ER, and then is transferred to the plastid, but this transport
  system is largely unknown (dotted lines). Abbreviations: acyl-ACP, acyl-acyl carrier
