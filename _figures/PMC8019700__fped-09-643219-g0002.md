caption: Human rhinoviruse (HRV) replication and inflammatory response. Depending
  on the serotype, HRVs use intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), cadherin-related
  family 3 (CDHR3), or low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) for endocytosis. After
  binding, HRV upregulates ICAM-1 and other receptors expression (). A pH drop leads
  to viral uncoating after the loss of the capsid protein VP4 and externalization
  of hydrophobic N-terminal of VP1 (). In the endosome, viral RNAs are recognized
  by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR7/8, while receptors are recycled to apical
  plasma membrane (). Nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B pathway and the pattern recognition
  receptors ([RIG-1] and [MDA-5]) in the intracellular compartment are activated,
  leading to the production of interleukin 8 (IL8), IL1b, IL6, IL12, and interferon
  (IFN) beta and gamma. The cascade leads in fine to the increased production of T
  cells and neutrophil cytokines.
