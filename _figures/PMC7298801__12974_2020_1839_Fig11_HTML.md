caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the possible mechanisms of serum IgG-induced
  cytolysis of neurons. As we previously demonstrated, serum IgG from children with
  OMS and NB directly enhances the cytolysis of cultured cerebral cortical and cerebellar
  neurons. On the other hand, serum IgG also increases the activation of cultured
  microglias, leading to the upregulation of NO, which subsequently activate sGC and
  PKG in neurons, thereby inducing neuronal cytolysis. Although at the same time IGF-1/PI3K
  signaling may be activated to alleviate neuronal lysis, the impact of the NO/sGC/PKG
  pathway may be more predominant
