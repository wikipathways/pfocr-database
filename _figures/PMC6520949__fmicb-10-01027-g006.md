caption: Central carbon metabolic pathways, including key differences in the transcriptomes
  of ΔphaR_CAD versus both WT_101 and WT_CAD. Experiments were performed in the HM
  medium with 240 mM methanol as the carbon source. Asterisk (∗) denotes ITA production
  by the heterologous Cad (pink color), while the phaR mutation causes deficiency
  in PHB accumulation (magenta color). The color of the arrows in the pathway indicates
  the level of differential gene expression according to the legend where the + and
  – signs denote up- and down-regulation, respectively, while black arrows represent
  genes in pathways that were not differentially expressed. Blue lines indicate possible
  inhibition or reduction of enzyme activities by a metabolite or as a result of diminished
  co-factor biosynthesis. PQQ, pyrroloquinoline quinone; XoxF1, lanthanide- and PQQ-dependent
  methanol dehydrogenase; Mxa, calcium- and PQQ-dependent methanol dehydrogenase;
  MtdA, methylene-dH4MPT/H4F dehydrogenase; MtdB, methylene-dH4MPT dehydrogenase;
  Fdh1, tungsten- and NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase; Fdh3, cytochrome-linked
  formate dehydrogenase; Fdh4, molybdopterin-binding oxidoreductase-like formate dehydrogenase;
