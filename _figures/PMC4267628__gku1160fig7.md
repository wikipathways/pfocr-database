caption: A proposed protective mechanism mediated by the H19/let-7 axis. Under normal
  conditions in non-diabetic muscle there exists a homeostasis with high H19 and low
  let-7 availability. During acute hyperinsulinemia, the PI3K/AKT pathway is activated,
  causing let-7 level rise and rapid H19 degradation. Such H19 depletion and release
  of let-7 leads to temporal impairment of insulin signaling at later time points,
  thus preventing muscle cells from overdrawing glucose from the circulation.
papertitle: The H19/let-7 double-negative feedback loop contributes to glucose metabolism
  in muscle cells.
