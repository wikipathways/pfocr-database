caption: 'Putative biosynthetic pathway of diosgenin saponins in D. zingiberensis.
  The diosgenin saponin biosynthetic pathway can be divided into the following stages:
  synthesis of squalene, generation of cholesterol/sitosterol, biosynthesis of diosgenin,
  and biosynthesis of diosgenin saponins. Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) is synthesized
  through the mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathways. Three
  enzymes (GPPS, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase; FPPS, farnesyl diphosphate
  synthase; and SQS, squalene synthase) involved in the synthesis of squalene are
  depicted in gray. Eleven enzymes [SQE, squalene epoxidase; CAS, cycloartenol synthase;
  SMT, sterol C-24 methyltransferase; SMO, C-4 sterol methyl oxidase; CPI1, cyclopropylsterol
  isomerase; CYP51, sterol C-14 demethylase; C14-R, sterol C-14 reductase; 8,7 SI,
  sterol 8;7 isomerase; CD-SD, sterol C-5(6) desaturase; 7-DR, 7-dehydrocholesterol
  reductase; and DWF1, δ-(24)-sterol reductase] that participate in plant sterol (cholesterol
  and β-sitosterol) biosynthetic pathways are marked in salmon, and four key enzymes
  (CYP90B, sterol 22-α-hydroxylase; CYP72A/CYP94, sterol 26-α-hydroxylase; S3GT, sterol
  3-β-glucosyltransferase; and F26G) involved in the synthesis of diosgenin saponins
  are marked in green. Dashed arrows indicate multiple steps in the pathway.'
