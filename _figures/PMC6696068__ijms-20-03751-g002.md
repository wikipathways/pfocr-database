caption: The crucial role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in multiple steps of
  bone sarcoma progression and metastatic dissemination. (a) The canonical Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway is able to enhance bone sarcoma cells proliferation, to induce
  an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like through secretion of fibulin-3 and
  to promote the acquisition of stem cells properties of bone sarcoma cancer stem
  cells (CSCs). (b) The Wnt/β-catenin pathway participates to the hijacking of the
  bone microenvironment by the bone sarcoma cells, leading to the establishment of
  a vicious cycle between bone remodeling and tumor cells proliferation associated
  with the release of pro-tumoral factors including Wnt ligands from the bone matrix.
  (c) The Wnt/β-catenin pathway promotes the modulation of the extracellular matrix
  (ECM), increasing secretion of extracellular matrix components such as tenascin
  C, fibronectin 1 or collagens and stimulates the ECM degradation by upregulation
  of proteolytic enzymes such as MMPs. (d) The Wnt/β-catenin pathway induces an over-expression
  of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the most important pro-angiogenic
  factor and is also able to modulate endothelial cell migration, leading to an increase
  in tumor-associated angiogenesis. (e) The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway participates
  to the establishment of an immune tolerance in the TME, enhancing pro-tumoral M2
  macrophages polarization and inhibiting cytotoxic T cell infiltration and functions
  and inducing resistance to anti-PD1 or anti-PDL-1 therapy. The activation of the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in dendritic cells leads to up-regulation of interleukin-10
  (IL-10) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO) secretion leading to an inhibition
  of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) cytotoxic properties. By targeting both
  osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma cells and the bone TME, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway participates to the disease progression and the establishment of lung metastases.
