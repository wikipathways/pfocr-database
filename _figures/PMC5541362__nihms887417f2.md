caption: A) Schematic showing the mouse adrenal gland (inset) and an adrenal chromaffin
  cell. SERT can exert multiple effects indicated by the red numbering. 1) SERT is
  expressed in the adrenal medulla (blue) but not the adrenal cortex. 5-HT is found
  in the adrenal gland largely due to SERT-mediated uptake. Levels of 5-HT are approximately
  1/750th of epinephrine levels. 2) Following SERT-mediated uptake into chromaffin
  cells 5-HT is packaged into secretory vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter
  (VMAT). 3) Chromaffin cells also express 5-HT1A receptors providing for potential
  autocrine regulation by 5-HT. 4) SERT constrains the ability of 5-HT to recruit
  the 5-HT1A receptor signaling pathway. 5) The 5-HT1A receptors reduce catecholamine
  secretion but this does not involve the typical mechanisms used by inhibitory GPCRs
  that target chromaffin cell voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC), K+ channels, or
  Ca2+signaling. 6) Other effects of SERT and/or intracellular 5-HT are also possible.
  B) Known and potential effects of SERT knockout on adrenal chromaffin cells. 1)
  The adrenal catecholamine content is unaltered in glands from SERT-/- mice, but
  the 5-HT content is reduced by ≈80%. 2) 5-HT1A receptors are still present and functional,
  but the loss of cellular 5-HT content presumably prevents autocrine inhibition via
  these receptors. Conversely, other sources of 5-HT might be expected to more efficiently
  recruit the 5HT1A receptors as the opposing action of SERT is no longer present.
  3) The sympathoadrenal response to acute restraint stress (increase in plasma epinephrine)
  is exaggerated in SERT knockout mice. 4) There is a failure to upregulate expression
  of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors in response to
  acute stress in SERT knockouts. 5) The quantal size of unitary vesicular fusion
  events detected using carbon fiber amperometry is reduced in cells isolated from
  SERT-/- mice.
