caption: 'The levels of related differential metabolites identified in the NS, CDDP,
  and CDDP+ High Fas Groups are showed in the histogram. The different metabolites
  in the colored square frame refer to the same species of LysoPC, PC, and PE. The
  red squares represent metabolites found in the study, whereas the gray squares represent
  metabolites not found in the study, which were predictable metabolites in the pathway
  network. The solid arrows indicate the direct production of downstream or upstream
  metabolites and dotted arrows indicated the indirect production of downstream or
  upstream metabolites, * means statistic differences (P < 0.05) between CDDP Group
  versus NS Group, # means statistic differences (P < 0.05) between CDD+ High Fas
  Group versus CDDP Group.'
