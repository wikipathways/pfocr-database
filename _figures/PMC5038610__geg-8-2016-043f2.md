caption: Crosstalk between cell metabolism and epigenetics. As glucose comes into
  glycolytic reactions, a minor portion involves in hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  to produce GlcNAc, which can act as the substrate for histone GlcNAcylation by O-GlcNAc
  transferase. The majority of glucose is converted to acetyl-CoA and passed into
  TCA cycle with the alteration of NAD+/NADH pair. NAD+ is a key cofactor for reactions
  catalyzed by sirtuins. Acetyl-CoA is used as an acetyl group donor for histone acetylation
  catalyzed by HATs. Other intermediates from TCA cycle, such as α-KG, can function
  as cofactors for DNA and histone demethylation reactions by TET proteins and JHDM,
  respectively. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is proposed to catalyze demethylation
  using FAD.
