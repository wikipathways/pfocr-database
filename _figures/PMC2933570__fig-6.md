caption: Nrf2 activation and enhanced metabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons.
  Primary cortical neuronal cultures were infected with Ad-GFP (50 MOI) before treatment
  with tBHQ. Cells were lifted, sorted, and RNA was isolated from the sorted pools
  and analyzed with microarray analysis [Kraft et al., 2004 ()]. A hypothetical diagram
  of some of the pathways changed with tBHQ treatment in the astrocytes (GFP-positive)
  and the neurons (GFP-negative) based on microarray analysis is shown above. The
  protective cellular shield reflects genes that are consistently changed with activation
  of Nrf2 to combat oxidative stress and toxicants. The majority of these genes change
  in the astrocyte. Other genes involved in energy metabolism also were changed. Solid
  arrowheads, pathways with one or more enzymes upregulated by tBHQ treatment (e.g.,
  more than five enzymes converting glucose to pyruvate are increased by tBHQ in the
  astrocyte population). Hollow arrowheads on solid lines, known interactions that
  are not changed by tBHQ. Arrows with stippled lines, a proposed interaction between
  neurons and glia that is not yet proven. Files containing all of the microarray
  data are available for download at http://www.pharmacy.wisc.edu/facstaff/sciences/JohnsonGroup/microdata.cfm
