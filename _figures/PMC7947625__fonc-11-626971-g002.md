caption: 'Main mechanisms involved in mevalonate (MVA) pathway dysregulation and different
  cancers associated. MVA pathway is upregulated in several cancers including breast,
  prostate, pancreatic, lung, esophageal, hepatic, and leukemia. Main mechanisms involved
  in the dysregulation of MVA pathway include: abnormal regulation of the enzyme hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA
  reductase (HMGCR) by different transcription factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor
  1 (HIF-1); mutations or abnormal activation of sterol regulatory element-binding
  proteins (SREBPs); mutations on tumor suppressor proteins such as tumor protein
  (p53); decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation; increased activation
  of signaling pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)—protein kinase B
  (AKT)—mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), Janus Kinase (JAK)/Signal
  Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) or Hippo signaling pathway (YAP-TAZ).'
