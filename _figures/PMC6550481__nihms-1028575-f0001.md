caption: In wild-type and mutant N-RAS cells, B-RAF and C-RAF are recruited to the
  plasma membrane and associate with activated RAS (RAS-GTP). Formation of B-RAF/C-RAF
  heterodimers or C-RAF/C-RAF homodimers leads to activation of the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway.
  Treatment with ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors promotes the formation of RAF dimers.
  In one scenario, binding of the RAF inhibitor to B-RAF leads to the formation of
  B-RAF/C-RAF heterodimers that contains an inactivated B-RAF and a hyperactivated
  C-RAF. In the second scenario, binding of the RAF inhibitor to C-RAF results in
  the formation of C-RAF/C-RAF homodimers that contain one inactivated C-RAF and one
  hyperactivated C-RAF. In either scenario, MEK/ERK1/2 signaling is hyperactivated.
  We note that some experiments with PLX4032/4720 indicate RAS-independent mechanisms
  of activation, adding further complexity to this model.
