caption: Interaction of stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), Hmox1, and endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase (eNOS) in response to vascular injury. Vascular injury, e.g., wounding
  or ischemia (), results in the release of SDF-1 and subsequent induction of the
  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein
  kinase/eNOS (PI3K/Akt/eNOS) pathway in bone marrow stromal cells. NO and Hmox1 (,
  , ) are critical for the mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) from
  the bone marrow to the circulation. In circulating EPC, Hmox1 and eNOS release CO
  and NO, respectively, which induce phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein
  (VASP) and its redistribution to the leading edge of the cells (). This promotes
  migration and vascular repair. In addition, there is also evidence suggesting that
  Hmox1 regulates SDF-1 expression (, ).
