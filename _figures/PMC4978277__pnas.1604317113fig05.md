caption: Our model of HCMV nuclear translocation in infected monocytes. HCMV enters
  monocytes via an endocytic pathway and is initially retained in early endosomes
  until ∼45 mpi. If the viral binding-induced signaling between gH/gL/UL128-131 and
  appropriate integrins is activated, then HCMV translocates to the TGN after 45 mpi.
  If not, then HCMV translocates to late endosomes and is then degraded. With appropriate
  signaling, HCMV in the TGN then moves to recycling endosomes before nuclear translocation
  can occur. Deenvelopment of HCMV begins at ∼2 dpI, and this likely occurs in recycling
  endosomes. The free capsid then temporally translocates to the nuclear membrane,
  and viral DNA enters the nucleus starting at ∼3 dpi.
