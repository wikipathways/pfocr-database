caption: 'Genes involved in hedgehog, Wnt, TGF‐β, and p53 signaling pathways were
  differentially expressed during developmental BA. Hepatobiliary transcriptomes at
  four landmark stages during developmental BA (M0, M2, M5, and JV) were analyzed
  with KEGG pathway mapping. Genes up‐regulated are highlighted in red, whereas genes
  down‐regulated are highlighted in green. Genes showing both red and green are up‐regulated
  or down‐regulated at different developmental stages. Dashed lines represent intermediate
  signaling steps omitted in the diagram. Abbreviations: APC, adenomatous polyposis
  coli protein; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; Dvl, disheveled; GSK‐3β, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β; LEF, lymphoid enhancer binding factor; M0, larval stage; M2,
  metamorphic stage 2; M5, metamorphic stage 5; +p, phosphorylation; PTCH, patched;
  SHH, sonic hedgehog; SMO, smoothened; TCF, transcription factor.'
