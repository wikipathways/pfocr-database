caption: a, Schematic of the visual cycle pathway. Absorption of light (hν) by visual
  pigments (11c-RAL-opsin) results in their conversion to an active state capable
  of initiating phototransduction (atRAL-opsin). After a period of time activated
  pigments lose their retinoid chromophore by hydrolysis which generates free all-trans-retinal
  (atRAL). This molecule is reduced by retinol dehydrogenases (RDH), mainly RDH8,
  to form all-trans-retinol, which is then esterified by lecithin:retinol acyltransferase
  (LRAT) to produce all-trans-retinyl esters (atRE). RPE65 is the essential retinoid
  isomerase of this pathway that catalyzes the conversion of atRE into 11-cis-retinol
  (11c-ROL). 11c-ROL is oxidized, primarily by RDH5, to form 11-cis-retinal (11c-RAL),
  which recombines with opsins to complete the cycle. b, Ester cleavage/isomerization
  reaction catalyzed by RPE65. Unlike typical biological ester hydrolysis reactions
  isotope labeling experiments have demonstrated that ester dissociation occurs by
  O-alkyl cleavage rather than acyl cleavage. Notably, the prochirality of C15 inverts
  during the reaction.
