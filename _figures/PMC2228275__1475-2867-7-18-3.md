caption: 'A signaling network links genes regulated by GCs in CEM cells. Ingenuity®
  bioinformatics pathway analysis tool was used to connect a subset of 35 genes from
  the CEM signatory list (Table 1, and symbol, closed diamond in Additional file )
  based upon a database of published observations. Symbols for genes representing
  specific categories of cellular molecules as well as interactive relationships are
  depicted in the legend. Color gradations are based upon gene regulation at the fold-change
  level. Red color: induced gene; green color: repressed gene. Fold-change data from
  CEM-C7–14 cells treated with Dex are presented as representative of the CEM signature.'
