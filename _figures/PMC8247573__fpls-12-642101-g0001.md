caption: Schematic representation of biosynthesis and catabolism of polyamines (PAs),
  their role in the activation of defense response in plants and cross-talk with stress-defensive
  metabolites. The enzymes involved in the metabolic processes are shown in green
  color. Putrescine (Put), the central molecule of PA biosynthesis, can be synthesized
  either by arginine (by ADC) or by ornithine (by ODC) derived pathway. Synthesis
  of diamine spermidine (Spd) and tetramine spermine (Spm) is brought about by the
  subsequent addition of aminopropyl groups (furnished from the decarboxylated penultimate
  precursor of ethylene, dcSAM) to the Put skeleton, and is catalyzed by SPDS and
  SPMS, respectively. Degradation of Put is catalyzed by DAO and that of Spd and Spm
  by PAO. PAs, along with their catabolic by-products (GABA, H2O2, and NO), serve
  as stress messengers and participate in the reinforcement of antioxidant machinery.
  Production of GABA from PA further boosts the production of compatible osmolytes
  (such as sugars) under stress. Put and Pro are linked by the common precursor glutamate
  and share precursor–product relationship regulated by DAO and GABA. Through possibly
  unknown mechanisms, both PA and NO are found to increase production of each other
  during stress. Spd possibly intensifies NOS activity that boosts NO production.
  Put and abscisic acid (ABA) are invested in a positive feedback circuit; Put activates
  NCED gene that triggers ABA accumulation, which further activates TFs that in turn
  regulate the ADC gene. ODC, Ornithine Decarboxylase; ADC, Arginine Decarboxylase;
