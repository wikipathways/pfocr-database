caption: Identification of subnetwork and core genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection
  and platelet activation. A The subnetwork associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and
  platelet activation in modules-2, -8, -15 and -16. The red round border indicates
  mRNAs only in the ‘COVID-19 pathway’; blue round border indicates mRNAs only in
  ‘platelet activation pathway’; gray round border indicates mRNAs both in ‘platelet
  activation’ and ‘COVID-19’ pathways. B Pearson’s correlation analysis was estimated
  among the core mRNAs. The size of the circle scales with the correlation magnitude
  and the darker the color, the larger the magnitude of the correlation coefficient.
  Red and blue represent positive and negative correlations, respectively. The upper
  triangular matrix and the lower triangular matrix represent the correlation coefficients
  in healthy and COVID-19 samples, respectively. C Protein–protein interaction network
  analysis among the core mRNAs. D Schematic diagram illustrating the SARS-CoV-2-induced
  activation of platelets and subsequent enhanced occurrence of thrombosis in COVID-19
  patients. The red and black arrows indicate the pathways of SARS-CoV-2 infection
  and platelet activation, respectively. The dashed line indicates the indirect action
  and the solid line indicates the direct action. SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019
