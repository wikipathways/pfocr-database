caption: Expression profiles of selected genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic
  pathway in the incompatible (white triangles) and compatible (black circles) P.
  pachyrhizi-soybean interactions. P. pachyrhizi infection leads to up-regulation
  of genes in the major flavonoid pathways, as highlighted by the accompanying differential
  expression profiles of selected genes whose encoded enzymes catalyze reactions in
  these secondary metabolite pathways.
