caption: Regulation of Cdc25A by Chk1. Throughout the cell division cycle, Cdc25A
  is continually being phosphorylated by Chk1 to promote its turnover. Ionizing radiation
  activates a pathway that targets phosphorylated Cdc25A for complete destruction.
  The anticancer agent UCN-01 abrogates G2 checkpoint function by inhibiting Chk1
  to deregulate the Cdc25A pathway and by inhibiting kinases other than Chk1 to deregulate
  the Cdc25C pathway ().
