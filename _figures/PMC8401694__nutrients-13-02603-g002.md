caption: A simplified schematic representation of the processes under investigation
  leading to the osteogenic differentiation of VICs in vascular calcification. Iron
  (Fe) acts at the intracellular level via ferritin, which prevents phosphate uptake
  and inhibits VICs osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, ferritin promotes the production
  of anti-calcific pyrophosphate (PPi) from ATP by activating the enzyme ENPP2. Zinc
  (Zn) induces VICs apoptosis through the activation of the GPR39-ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway. Vitamin K promotes the carboxylation and activation of matrix Gla protein
  (MGP), which avoids the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals and prevents the
  pro-calcific action of BMP-2. Phytate acts as crystallization inhibitor by binding
  to HA crystals. The regular arrow denotes “activation”, and the T-shaped arrow stands
  for “inhibition”.
