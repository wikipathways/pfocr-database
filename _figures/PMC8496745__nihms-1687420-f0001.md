caption: 'Autophagy mediates the crosstalk of oxidative stress with the Keap1-NRF2
  antioxidative response, the DNA damage response, and the cGAS-STING-mediated antitumor
  immune response.ROS are produced by various stresses, such as viral infections,
  cancer chemotherapeutic drug treatments, and cancer hypoxia, as well as by signaling
  pathways triggered by oncogenic viral proteins. Different levels of ROS result in
  distinct outcomes, through the activation of: 1) DDR. p62-mediated selective autophagy
  is induced by ROS and promotes DNA repair in cancer cells, conferring to drug resistance.
  massive DNA damage that cannot be repaired causes cell death;2) antioxidative response.
  The master antioxidant transcription factor NRF2 remains at low protein levels.
  ROS promote the accumulation and activation of NRF2 in an autophagy-dependent manner.
  Activated NRF2 induces the expression of a pool of target genes, including p62 that
  is required for the induction of p62-mediated selective autophagy; and 3) DNA sensing
  pathways, with the cGAS-STING pathway being the major one. p62-mediated selective
  autophagy suppresses the cGAS-STING-mediated signaling, and in turn, the cGAS-STING
  pathway promotes p62-mediated selective autophagy.'
