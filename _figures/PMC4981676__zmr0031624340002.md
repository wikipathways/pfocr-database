caption: Structure and function of JIP1 acting within the JNK pathway. (A) The domain
  architecture of the JIP1 protein. The N-terminal regulatory “tail” is largely disordered,
  while the C-terminal half of JIP1 contains three folded domains as well as a kinesin
  light chain (KLC)-binding linear motif. The precise function of the intrinsically
  disordered N terminus (with its conserved acidic motifs) is unknown, yet it is highly
  phosphorylated by JNK in a D-motif-dependent manner. Currently, only two target
  sites (T103 and S421) are known to have a role in JNK-dependent physiological regulation
  of JIP1. This model was built by combining domain signature searches (PFAM), folding
  tendency predictors (IUPRED), and conservation analyses (multiple alignments among
  vertebrate proteins) as well as curated data from the literature. The lower line
  shows the results of conservation analyses (red, highly conserved sequence; blue,
  nonconserved sequence), when sequences of vertebrate JIP1 and the closely related
  JIP2 proteins are aligned with each other. Structural domains and key motifs are
  preserved in both proteins (including the JNK-binding D-motif), while most regulatory
  phosphorylation sites differ between JIP1 and JIP2. (B) A model of JIP1 actions
  on the microtubule-dependent transport processes in neurons. The JIP1/2 dimers (turquoise)
  are capable of transporting a diverse set of membrane-associated proteins (e.g.,
  β-APP, APoE2-R) as well as certain MAP2Ks (MKK7 [red]) and inactive MAP3Ks (MLK3,
  DLK [magenta]). These complexes are moved along the microtubule filaments with the
  help of kinesin 1-kinesin light chain 1 motors (blue). At the end of their journey,
  the transport complexes are uncoupled by a JNK-dependent phosphorylation of JIP1.
  Since this step also results in the release of upstream components and activators
  belonging to the JNK pathway, it leads to a positive feedback loop and helps to
  maintain subcellular compartments with high local JNK activity. The JIP1/2 proteins
  uncoupled from their cargo are also transported in a reverse direction (likely through
  a dynein-driven process), although the structural details of the latter complex
  are poorly known.
