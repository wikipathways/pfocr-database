caption: Proposed signaling pathway by which the stimulatory effect of ANG II on ROMK
  channel activity in HK-fed rats is mediated via AT2Rs. AT2Rs and AT1Rs cooperate
  in the renal regulation of K+ excretion. The pathway by which ANG II inhibits ROMK
  channels in low-K+ (LK)-fed rats was previously reported (). PTK, protein tyrosine
  kinase; PLC, phospholipase C.
