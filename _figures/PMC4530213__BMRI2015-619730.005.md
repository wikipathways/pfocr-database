caption: Functional connections brought by the active clusters between T2D and obesity.
  (a) The connecting pathways in the obesity (orange ellipse) and T2D (blue ellipse)
  cluster 1. The enriched pathways of the immune response, signaling, and disease-related
  groups were highlighted by the colored triangles (blue, red, and grass green). (b)
  The graph of T2D cluster 1 and obesity cluster 1. The genes involved in insulin
  signaling pathway were highlighted in green.
