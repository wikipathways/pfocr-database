caption: The HPV oncogene E6 inhibits DNA damage response and DNA damage repair via
  inhibition of TP53, Tip50 and XRCC1. E7 inhibits RB1 to impair the non-homologous
  end joining repair pathway as well as to activate p16 which impairs homologous repair.
  Genes colored in orange represent HPV viral oncogenes. Genes colored in yellow represent
  cellular genes/pathways involved in DNA repair that are direct HPV oncogene targets.
  Genes colored in green represent cellular genes/pathways involved in DNA repair
  that are indirect HPV oncogene targets. Created with BioRender.com.
