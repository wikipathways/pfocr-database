caption: 'Conversion of glucose to pyruvate (glycolysis) and oxidation of amino acids
  to carboxylic acids (Stickland metabolism) generate NADH. Proline reductase (1),
  glycine reductase (2) and the succinate-acetyl CoA pathway to butyrate (3, 4) generate
  NAD+. Solid lines indicate single enzyme steps, whereas dotted lines indicate multienzyme
  steps in the pathways. Specific pathways and genes that encode the relevant enzymes
  are denoted as follows: (1) D-proline reductase (CD3236–3244, prd); (2) glycine
  reductase (CD2348-CD2358, grd); (3) succinate reduction (CD2344–CD2338); (4) conversion
  of acetyl CoA to butyryl CoA (CD1054–CD1059); (5) ethanolamine utilization (CD1906-CD1925,
  eut); and (6) alcohol dehydrogenase (CD2966, adhE). In the prdR mutant, the prd
  genes were underexpressed, but the other indicated pathways were all overexpressed
  at least 5-fold compared to the wild-type.'
