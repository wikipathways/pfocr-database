caption: Redox regulation of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is driven by lipid peroxidation,
  which is catalyzed by redox-active iron. Cysteine availability, which is regulated
  by cystine uptake via system xc- or through the transsulfuration pathway, is essential
  for efficient synthesis of GSH. GPX4 utilizes GSH to reduce lipid hydroperoxides,
  thereby suppressing ferroptosis. GSSG is reduced to GSH by GR using NADPH. In addition,
  reduced coenzyme Q (CoQH2) acts as a lipophilic radical-trapping antioxidant that
  halts the propagation of lipid peroxidation. The CoQ oxidoreductase ferroptosis
  suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) maintains CoQH2 levels and acts parallel to GPX4 to
  inhibit ferroptosis. FSP1, ferroptosis suppressor protein 1; GSH, glutathione; GPX4,
  glutathione peroxidase 4; GSSG, glutathione disulfide; GR, glutathione reductase.
