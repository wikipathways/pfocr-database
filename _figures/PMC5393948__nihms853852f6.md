caption: Isl1 conditional mutants are deficient in Foxo signaling. Isl1 conditional
  mutants show reduced expression of Foxo6 at E15 (compare B to A) and E18 (compare
  D to C). Foxo3 is also reduced in the Isl1 conditional mutant striatum at E18.5
  (compare F to E). The Foxo1/Foxo3 target gene Bach2 is expressed in the developing
  striatum at E13 (I), E15 (G), and E18.5 (K). Double labeling with in situ for Bach2
  and IHC for tdTomato show that Bach2 expression is observed in Isl1 fate-map (Isl1cre/+;
  RosaCAG−tdTomato/+) tdTomato+ neurons at E15.5 (red arrows in J). Isl1 conditional
  mutants show reduced Bach2 expression in the striatum at E15.5 (compare H to G).
  Bach2 is modestly reduced in the E15.5 Foxo1 cKO striatum (M) as compared to control
  (L). Note that the level of expression in the Foxo1 cKO striatum (M) appears higher
  than that observed in the Isl1 cKO striatum (H).
