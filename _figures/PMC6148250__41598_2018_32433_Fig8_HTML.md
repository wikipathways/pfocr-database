caption: S100A10 and PAI-1 are regulated by Smad4-dependent TGFβ1-mediated signaling
  and FOXC2-mediated PI3K signaling. The model proposes that the treatment of epithelial
  cells with TGFβ1 increases S100A10 and PAI-1 mRNA and protein levels through canonical
  Smad-dependent TGFβ1 signaling. S100A10 and PAI-1 are also affected by the pro-growth
  PI3K pathway. Serum starvation, PI3K inhibition or mTOR inhibition upregulate S100A10
  expression suggesting an inhibitory effect through this pathway. The transcription
  factor FOXC2, which is downstream of PI3K, mediates the repression of S100A10 expression
  and induction of PAI-1.
