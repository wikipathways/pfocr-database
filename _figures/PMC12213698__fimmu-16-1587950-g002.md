caption: Basics of the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway. (A) In the presence of
  Wnt ligands, Wnt/PCP signaling involves the binding of Wnt to ROR-FZD receptor complex
  and results in the activation of DVL. The activated DVL generates the activation
  of Rho by the de-inhibition of cytoplasmic protein DAAM. Rac1 and Rho together provoke
  ROCK and JNK and advocate polarized cell migration (B) In the presence of Wnt ligands,
  Wnt/Ca2+ pathway involves the activation of PLC to produce DAG and IP3, which lead
  to intracellular Ca2+ flux that recruits PKC, calcineurin and CAMKII to form transcription
  factors such as NFκB and NFAT. Created with BioRender.com
