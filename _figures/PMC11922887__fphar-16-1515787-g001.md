caption: Schematic diagram of the potential mechanisms of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in microglial
  activation and/or neuropathic pain. Tnc can stimulate HDAC1 expression and activity
  in microglia, at least partly in a TLR4-dependent manner. Specificity protein 1
  (Sp1) seduces histone deacetylation in the PGC-1α promoter and inhibits PGC-1α expression
  with the help of HDAC2, leading to neuropathic pain and inflammation as well as
  mitochondrial dysfunction. T-LAK-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) can bind
  to HDAC1 and HDAC2 and regulate their phosphorylation and degradation, thereby shifting
  microglia/macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype. This action can inhibit
  microglial inflammation. LPS can induce neuroinflammation through the HDAC2/TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
  pathway. Additionally, TLR4 activation by LPS downregulates the expression of α7
  nAChR mRNA through histone H3 deacetylation mediated by HDAC2 and HDAC3
