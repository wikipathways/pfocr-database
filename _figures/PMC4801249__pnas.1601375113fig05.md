caption: Model of MlaA*-mediated death. The mlaA* allele increases LPS levels, and
  we hypothesize that this increase is caused by the cell’s response to the activation
  of PldA caused by MlaA* transferring PLs from the inner to the outer leaflet (the
  reverse of its wild-type activity). Because of this change in composition, OM material
  is lost through vesiculation at cell-division sites when cations are depleted. Because
  the area of the OM is constrained to be larger than the rigid cell wall, this loss
  is compensated by lipid flow to the OM from the IM in an energy-independent manner,
  possibly through sites of membrane hemifusion. Starved cells cannot synthesize fatty
  acids, and consequently the IM shrinks away from the cell wall (white arrow) and
  eventually ruptures because of the increase in turgor pressure. Cells die through
  slow leakage of cytoplasmic contents out of the envelope rather than through rapid
  lysis.
