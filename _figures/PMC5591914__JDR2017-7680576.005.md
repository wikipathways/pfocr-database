caption: Mechanisms of 5-HT2A receptor antagonist contributing to DM-induced cardiovascular
  complications. Sarpogrelate, a 5-HT2AR antagonist, has been shown to attenuate diabetes-induced
  cardiovascular complications, which decrease the blood glucose level, inhibit the
  release of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion
  molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and reduce 5-HT-induced contraction in aortas through the PI3K
  and Rho kinase pathway.
