caption: The MHC class I antigen processing and presentation pathway Proteins targeted
  to the proteasome through ubiquitination are cleaved into peptide fragments. A small
  proportion of these peptides are transported into the ER through TAP which forms
  part of the protein loading complex (PLC). In the ER the peptides are loaded onto
  MHC class I molecules (MHC I) which is facilitated by the macromolecular PLC including
  calreticulin (CRT), ERp57, tapasin (Tpn), TAP and MHC I. Peptides that are too long
  for binding are further trimmed by the aminopeptidases ERAP1 and 2. Once loaded
  with peptide, MHC I are released from the PLC and are exported to the cell surface
  for presentation to circulating CTL.
