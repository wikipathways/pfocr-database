caption: 'mTOR signaling network. The serine/threonine kinase mTOR is found in two
  multiprotein complexes: mTORC1 is composed of RAPTOR, PRAS40, mLST8, and DEPTOR,
  which has an inhibitory function on mTORC1. The mTORC1 is activated by growth factors,
  chemokines, nutrients (glucose, amino acids), and the cell energy status (i.e.,
  a high ATP/AMP ratio). mTORC1 stimulation is activated by growth factors through
  the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway. AKT phosphorylates tuberous
  sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2 or hamartin) at multiple sites. TSC2 is a GTPase-activating
  protein (GAP) that associates with tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1 or tuberin) for inactivating
  the small G protein Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain). Once AKT phosphorylates
  TSC2, the GAP activity of the TSC1/TSC2 complex is repressed, allowing Rheb to accumulate
  in a GTP-bound state. Therefore, Rheb-GTP upregulates mTORC1 protein kinase activity.
  AKT also phosphorylates PRAS40 (at Thr246), which dissociates from mTORC1 in response
  to growth factors, or glucose and nutrients, thereby releasing the inhibitory function
  of PRAS40 on mTORC1. mTORC1 activates S6K1 through phosphorylation, and S6K1 in
  turn phosphorylates or binds proteins such as eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase
  (eEF2K), which targets eEF2 and regulates the elongation step of protein translation,
  ribosomal protein S6 (S6RP), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), ultimately
  promoting translation initiation and elongation. mTORC1 also phosphorylayes and
  inactivates the translation inhibitor 4E-BP1, which has a role in inhibiting cap-dependent
  translation through the binding of the translation initiation factor eIF4E. mTORC1
  is a repressor of autophagy, through phosphorylation of Unc-51 like autophagy activating
  kinase 1 (ULK1), and positively controls lipid synthesis and glycolytic metabolism.'
