caption: Schematic representation of the metabolic pathways at the pyruvate branching
  point in S. cerevisiae engineered for conversion of glucose and xylose to l-lactic
  acid. Pathways are indicated with dashed arrows. Single enzyme reactions are represented
  in full arrows with the participating enzymes specified in brackets. ADH1-5 alcohol
  dehydrogenase 1 to 5, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, PDC1; 5; 6 pyruvate decarboxylase
  1, 5 and 6, PPP pentose phosphate pathway
