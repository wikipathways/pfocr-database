caption: Proposed model of SREBP modulation of cellulase secretion in N. crassa. Genes
  encoding cellulases, including the LPMO genes, are induced by CLR-2 in response
  to the presence of plant biomass. The IRE-1/HAC-1-mediated UPR is triggered to meet
  the demand for protein folding in the ER during the trafficking of cellulases through
  the secretion pathway. The SREBP pathway is activated when the cells sense a low-oxygen
  environment, perhaps partially due to the demands of cellulase trafficking and contributed
  by oxygen-consuming extracellular enzymes, such as LPMOs. The ER-bond SAH-2-SCP-1
  complex is transported to the Golgi apparatus, where SAH-2 is processed by the Dsc
  complex and rhomboid protease Rbd-2 to release the activated N-SAH-2, which enters
  the nucleus and activates genes required for ergosterol biosynthesis. Meanwhile,
  activated SAH-2 blocks the expression of genes (at some level) encoding extracellular
  oxygen-consuming enzymes (CDH-1 and LPMOs) and genes associated with an IRE-1/HAC-1-independent
  UPR pathway to limit the consumption of oxygen in surrounding cells. The green arrows
  indicate the UPR pathway, the purple arrows indicate cellulase enzyme trafficking
  and secretion, and the light blue arrows indicate the SAH-2 (SREBP) pathway.
