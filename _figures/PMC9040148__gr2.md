caption: Canonical β2 adrenergic receptor signalling. Binding of norepinephrine secreted
  by the sympathetic nerve stimulate the β-adrenergic receptor. Due to conformation
  change by replacement of GDP with GTP, αs, and βγ subunits of G protein separates
  from each other, and then αs activates the enzyme adenylate cyclase, which converts
  ATP to cAMP, which further phosphorylates GRK2; which in turn activates protein
  kinase A (PKA). Activated PKA then activation of ERK1/2, MAPK pathway leading to
  transcription regulation of several important genes.
