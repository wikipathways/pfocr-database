caption: In the cytoplasm, PI3K is activated downstream of receptors that include
  receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein–coupled receptors, cytokine receptors, and
  integrins. PI3K activation converts PIP2 to PIP3, thereby leading to AKT activation,
  which enhances cell growth, proliferation, and survival. PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3
  and consequently suppresses the PI3K pathway. NEDD4-1 is an E3 ligase of PTEN that
  mediates PTEN ubiquitination. Polyubiquitination of PTEN leads to its degradation
  in the plasma, whereas monoubiquitination of PTEN increases its nuclear localization.
  PTEN can translocate into the nucleus through various mechanisms, including passive
  diffusion, Ran- or major vault protein–mediated import, and a monoubiquitination-driven
  mechanism. In the nucleus, PTEN promotes p300-mediated P53 acetylation in response
  to DNA damage to control cellular proliferation. Nuclear PTEN is also involved in
  maintaining genomic integrity by binding to centromere protein C (CENPC) and in
  DNA repair by upregulating RAD51 recombinase (RAD51).
