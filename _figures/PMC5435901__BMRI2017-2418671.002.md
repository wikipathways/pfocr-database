caption: Nrf2 signaling pathway. Nrf2, as a transcription factor, resides within cytoplasm
  binding to the actin-associated Keap1 protein and is normally degraded. Upon oxidation
  stress, the association will be disrupted, resulting in the translocation of Nrf2
  to nuclei and then increased expression of cytoprotective enzymes (HO-1, SOD, etc.).
