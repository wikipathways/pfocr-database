caption: (A) Biosynthetic pathway of UDP-GlcNAc formation in mycobacteria. GlmU (Rv1018c)
  is a bifunctional enzyme which has glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyl transferase and
  N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridylyl transferase activities. (B) The reactions
  of MurA and MurB which act on the UDP-GlcNAc product of GlmU and are used in the
  linked assay in which the loss of NADPH is monitored. In the bacterium, the product,
  UDP-MurNAc, is then converted to peptidoglycan.
