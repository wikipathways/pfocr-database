caption: Irradiation-induced retraction and death of endothelial cells. Ionizing radiation
  exposure is able to decrease PECAM-1 expression, redistribute VE-cadherin, and produce
  actin stress fibers leading to endothelial retraction. Depending on the radiation
  dose, radiation quality, and inherent radiation sensitivity, ionizing radiation
  can activate the caspase pathway by ceramide formation and persistent p53 signaling,
  causing endothelial cell death. As a consequence of endothelial retraction and cell
  death, the physiological endothelial barrier is compromised
