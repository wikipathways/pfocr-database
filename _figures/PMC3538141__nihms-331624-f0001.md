caption: L. pneumophila translocates a large number of effectors into host cytosol
  via the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system to facilitate its intracellular replication.
  Host protein synthesis inhibition by 5 effectors, including three glucosyltransferases
  (Lgt1-3), SidL and SidL led to inefficient resynthesis of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB
  and NFκB activation. LegK1 and LnaB activate NF-κB, most likely by initiating the
  kinase cascade that ultimately causes phosphorylation and subsequent degradation
  of IκB. Nuclear translocation of NF-κB leads to cytokine production and the induction
  of anti-apoptotic genes. A yet unidentified set of effectors induces the MAP kinase
  pathway, leading to similar effects. Undefined effectors or DNA/RNA released by
  the Dot/Icm transporter induce expression of type I interferon, a process which
  is inhibited by the effector SdhA. Membrane remodeling of the bacterial phagosome
  (I) is achieved by a set of effectors, some of which are well-characterized, including
  RalF, SidM/DrrA, LepB, SidD, AnkX, SidJ and LegK2. Inhibition of phagolysosomal
  fusion (II) probably is mediated by AnkX, and very likely other yet unidentified
  effectors. Dashed lines indicate undefined effectors involved in the specified pathway.
  For clarity, pyroptotic cell death caused by flagellin, which reaches the cytosol
  probably via the Dot/Icm transporter is not shown. CREB, cAMP response element-binding
  protein; EE, early endosome; LE, late endosome; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases; N, nucleus; PM, plasma membrane.
