caption: In bladder cancer, YAP1 activity is regulated by YAP1 gene expression, post-transcriptional
  mRNA modifications, and the activity of the Hippo signaling pathway. YAP1 protein
  modifications also affect its activity and function. 4-HNE regulates YAP1 activity
  through phosphorylation, accelerating its degradation, while MINDY enhances its
  stability through deubiquitination. Activated YAP1 will enter the nucleus and bind
  to TEAD to regulate downstream target genes. 4-HNE, 4-hydroxynonenal; YAP, Yes-associated
  protein; LATS1/2, large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2; DUB, deubiquitination; TEAD,
  TEA domain
