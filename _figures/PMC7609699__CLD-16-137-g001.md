caption: (A) In stable cirrhosis, it has now been established that the hemostatic
  pathway is mostly rebalanced because of a deficit of the liver‐derived anticoagulant
  factor protein C, which interacts with endothelial‐derived thrombomodulin to inhibit
  factor V and factor VIII. (B) The net balance may be hypercoagulable with contributions
  from elevated factor VIII and vWF, and especially within the portal vein vascular
  bed, slow flow caused by increased resistance and endothelial injury inherent to
  the underlying liver disease. These changes constitute Virchow’s triad of hypercoagulability,
  stasis, and vascular endothelial injury. (C) Other factors favor failure of hemostasis
  in these patients and result in bleeding. These include most importantly portal
  hypertension and pressure‐driven rupture of the mesenteric vascular bed. Infection
  and renal failure also contribute to a bleeding diathesis. The former contributes
  by causing release of endothelial‐derived “heparinoid” substances, which act like
  heparin, and renal failure, which contributes both by causing uremic platelet dysfunction
  and exacerbation of volume expansion with exacerbation of portal pressure. Premature
  clot dissolution (hyperfibrinolysis) is clinically apparent by diffuse mucosal and
  puncture wound oozing, as well as delayed postprocedure bleeding. It is best treated
  by antifibrinolytic agents but remains a clinical diagnosis because laboratory measures
  have proved to be challenging.
