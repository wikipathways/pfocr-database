caption: IL-6 signaling pathways. IL-6 can mediate its intracellular signal by using
  both membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6 classical signaling) or soluble IL-6 receptor
  (IL-6 trans-signaling). In the classical IL-6 signaling, IL-6 binds to membrane-bound
  IL-6R (non-signaling receptor) and gp130 (signaling arm of IL-6 receptor) to form
  a complex. A complete functional complex consists of dimers of IL-6, IL-6R and gp130.
  IL-6 trans-signaling occurs in cells that lacks IL-6R. In this pathway, IL-6 first
  binds to soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) to form a complex and then this complex binds to
  gp130 at the cell surface to mediate the intracellular signaling. A soluble form
  of IL-6 is released from cell surfaces by proteolytic cleavage (ADAM 17) or splicing
  of IL-6R mRNA. In both types of signaling, JAKs binds to Box1 and 2 of gp130 which
  leads to activation of JAKs. STATs also binds to gp130 but are phosphorylated by
  JAKs. IL-6 also activate PI3K/Akt pathway via JAKs. Both SOCS and SHP2 bind to gp130
  via tyrosine 759. SOCS negatively regulate IL-6/STAT3 signaling by inhibiting both
  JAKs and STATs. SHP2 plays an important role in relating IL-6-mediated MAPK signaling.
