caption: Essentials of TGFβ signaling pathway. TGFβ is secreted by different cells
  and stored in ECM as a latent form, which interacts with latency-associated peptide
  (LAP) and latent TGFβ-binding protein (LTBP). Following their activation, TGFβ receptors
  transmit signals via the SMAD-dependent canonical pathway or SMAD-independent non-canonical
  pathway, thereby regulating gene and protein expression and cellular function.
