caption: 'De novo synthesised or imported serine and glycine refuel one-carbon metabolism.
  One-carbon metabolism comprises two interconnected metabolic cycles: the folate
  cycle and the methionine cycle. Different de novo or imported inputs (red boxes),
  including glycine derived from serine and vitamin B12, converge in this bimodular
  metabolic pathway. The. complex process produces multiple outputs (blue boxes),
  including substrates for methylation reactions, proteins, lipids, nucleotides, and
  reducing power against reactive oxygen species (ROS).'
