caption: 'TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In type-I cells, DISC-activated caspase-8 is sufficient
  to directly cleave and activate the downstream effector caspase-3. In type-II cells,
  activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, mediated by caspase-8-dependent
  cleavage of Bid, is required to achieve effector caspase activation. Truncated Bid
  (tBid) translocates to the mitochondria where it induces Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). MOMP releases pro-apoptotic factors such
  as cytochrome-c and Smac/DIABLO into the cytosol. Cytosolic cytochrome-c aggregates
  with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 to form the apoptosome, the activation platform for
  caspase-9. Active caspase-9 cleaves, and thereby activates, downstream effector
  caspases including caspase-3. The TRAIL-induced apoptosis cascade is inhibited at
  various levels: (i) at the DISC, cFLIP competes with caspase-8 for binding to FADD;
  (ii) at the mitochondria, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members like Bcl-2, Bcl-xL
  and Mcl-1 inhibit pro-apoptotic Bax- and Bak-mediated MOMP and (iii) at the level
  of effector caspases, XIAP inhibits them by direct interaction. Hence, together
  with the extent of DISC-generated caspase-8 activity, the ratio of the expression
  of caspase-3 to XIAP is crucial for categorization of a particular cell line as
  type-I or type-II'
