caption: STRING analysis of pathway enrichment and interaction in the altered mRNA
  in rat ARDS. Eight mRNAs, Lct, Mdh1, Akr1b1, Alad, Ces3, Aco2, Prdx6, and Acaa2
  were involved in the metabolic pathways (pink color). Eleven interactions were observed
  in the protein products of altered mRNAs (connected node).
