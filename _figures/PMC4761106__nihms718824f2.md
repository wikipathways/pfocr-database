caption: (a) In the BAP1 pathway, the deubiquitinase activity of BAP1 removes ubiquitin
  groups (Ub) from transcriptional regulators and histone 2A (H2A) thereby regulating
  gene expression. Inactivating mutations in BAP1 leads to loss of nuclear BAP1 activity.
  (b) Both telomerase (TERT) and the shelterin complex maintain normal telomeric structure.
  Inherited or somatic variants in the TERT promoter region recruits GABP transcription
  factor to the TERT promoter thereby stimulating TERT transcription. Inactivating
  mutations in other shelterin complex genes (e.g. POT1) can be inherited, disrupt
  normal telomere structure and predispose individuals to melanoma. (c) Lastly, the
  E318K mutation in MITF removes a normal sumoylation (Su) site in MITF thereby altering
  the occupancy and transcription of MITF target genes. Presumably, changes in the
  expression pattern of MITF target genes, which can regulate the survival and the
  pigment synthetic genes in melanocytes, increase melanoma risk.
