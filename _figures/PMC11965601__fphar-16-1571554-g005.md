caption: Mechanism of anti-inflammatory regulation in Lycium barbarum L. Quercetin
  can inhibit the activation of NF-κB and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, reduce the
  production and release of inflammatory factors, and thus alleviate the damage of
  inflammatory response to retinal cells. Luteolin can interfere with the binding
  of cytokines to their corresponding receptors, thereby preventing receptor dimerization
  and JAK recruitment, thereby inhibiting JAK activation. Kaempferol can inhibit the
  phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine by activating JAK, blocking the formation of
  STAT docking sites and inhibiting signal transduction By Figdraw
