caption: 'Inset I: molecular chaperones, including HSP, regulate protein folding and
  ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-mediated degradation, while disaggregase could
  return misfolded proteins to their natively folded and functional state. Inset II:
  dysfunction in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway could underlie accumulation of pathogenic
  protein aggregates and damaged mitochondria. Inset III: impairment of mitochondrial
  quality control through mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics results in reduced
  energy production and dysfunctional proteostasis network. Inset IV: transcellular
  propagation and seeding of protein aggregates could underlie the disease progression.
  Inset V: abnormal stress granule dynamics that favor aggregation and aberrant incorporation
  of misfolded proteins contributes to toxicity. Inset VI: soluble forms of protein
  assemblies induce both pre- and postsynaptic impairments, leading to network dysfunction.
  HSP; heat shock protein.'
