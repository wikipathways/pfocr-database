caption: Schematic illustration of molecular mechanisms for endocannabinoid-mediated
  retrograde suppression of synaptic transmission. When intracellular Ca2+ concentration
  is elevated after the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) or NMDA receptors,
  2-AG is produced by diacylglycerol lipase α (DGLα) and released from postsynaptic
  neurons (Ca2+-driven endocannabinoid release; Ca-ER). The enzyme producing diacylglycerol
  (DG) in response to Ca2+ elevation has not been identified yet. When PLCβ is stimulated
  by the activation of mGluR1/5 or other Gq/11-coupled receptors, DG is produced from
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), DG is then converted to 2-AG by DGLα,
  and 2-AG is released from postsynaptic neurons (Receptor-driven endocannabinoid
  release; RER). When the activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors and the elevation
  of intracellular Ca2+ concentration occur concurrently, the production of 2-AG is
  accelerated through PLCβ-dependent pathway (Ca2+-assisted receptor-driven endocannabinoid
  release; Ca2+-assisted RER). 2-AG released from postsynaptic neurons activates presynaptic
  CB1 receptors. 2-AG also activates CB2 receptors and is reported to potentiate agonist-mediated
  GABAA receptor activation postsynaptically. Activation of CB1 receptor induces transient
  suppression of transmitter release through inhibition of VGCC and activation of
  K+ channels through Gβγ protein. Gα is responsible for the long-term suppression
  of transmitter release through inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling.
