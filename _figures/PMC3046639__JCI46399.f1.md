caption: Schematic diagram showing the RAS/MAPK cascade and affected disease genes
  in                         the RASopathies. The genes for which mutations are known
  and their                         associated phenotypes are indicated near the cartoon
  representation of the                         proteins they encode. Positive regulatory
  interactions are indicated with                         black arrows, and the negative
  regulatory interaction is indicated with a                         red blunted arrow.
  PD0325901 is an ATP-uncompetitive inhibitor of MEK                         (discussed
  in the text) and is also indicated with a blunted red arrow.                         CFCS,
  CFC syndrome; CS, Costello syndrome; NF1, neurofibromatosis type 1;                         NFLS,
  neurofibromatosis type 1–like syndrome (also termed Legius                         syndrome);
  NFNS, neurofibromatosis-NS; NS/LAH, Noonan-like syndrome with                         loose
  anagen hair; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; WS, Watson syndrome.
