caption: PPAR-γ transduction pathway. PPAR-γ has several extracellular and intracellular
  ligands that include dietary and bioactive lipids. Given its antidiabetogenic role,
  some PPAR-γ ligands include antidiabetic drugs such as thiazolidinediones. PPAR-γ
  is also modulated by several growth factor transduction pathways such as Jnk/Erk/MKP.
  It is known that the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) bond to p25 (a product of
  the cleavage of p35 in an obesity environment) inhibits the PPAR pathway via its
  phosphorylation. As a transcriptional factor, PPAR binds to RXR (retinol X receptor)
  to transcribe several genes related to adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage
  in adipose tissue and that increase insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues by
  an indirect increase of AMP kinase activity, as well as several other antidiabetogenic
  effects. Moreover, PPAR blocks NFB signaling, thus reducing proinflammatory cytokines
  and inflammation. (https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/401274 (accessed on 15 January 2022)—A.
