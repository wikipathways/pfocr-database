caption: Possible integrated mechanism of cell injury and its relationship with microcephaly
  ZIKV-induced and cell death. Cell injury is determined by a complex physiopathological
  response, in which apoptosis, necrosis, necroptotic cell death pathway, pyroptosis,
  paraptosis, and autophagy can directly impact on the development of microcephaly
  during ZIKV congenital infection or in the death of glial cells or neurons. Classic
  apoptosis, associated with the progression of extrinsic and intrinsic pathways,
  results in the activation of caspase 3, which is responsible for programmed cell
  death in cells of the neural parenchyma and thereby aggravates microcephaly. The
  cell stress and neuroinflammatory responses promote activation of the necroptotic
  cell death pathway which triggers an antiviral response in neurons regulated by
  actuation of ZBP1, RIPK1/RIPK3, IRF1, IRG5, and itaconate. In the neural parenchyma,
  with a loss of tissue architecture, intense cellular damage aggravated by neuroinflammation,
  and extravasation of the enzymatic content, can result in the destruction of neurons
  and glial cells by necrosis induced by ZIKV in microcephaly cases. Another type
  of cell death associated with microcephaly, which is dependent on inflammasome activation,
  is pyroptosis. In the inflammasome, receptors (e.g., NLRP3 and AIM2) recognize ZIKV
  PAMPs and release caspase 1, which, once activated, promotes IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-33
  maturation; these cytokines enhance the neuroinflammatory response and promote the
  development of microcephaly. In addition, caspase 1 provokes pyroptosis and cell
  death in the neural parenchyma during ZIKV-induced microcephaly. Regarding mitochondrial
  damage, a new type of cell death known as paraptosis causes massive cytoplasmic
  vacuolization in neuronal and glial cells mainly astrocytes. This relationship intensifies
  the response to PIK3, IRE1, PERK, and ATF-6, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ROS.
  Finally, during autophagy, two ZIKV proteins (NS4A and NS4B) modulate the PIK3/AKt1
  pathway, inhibiting neurogenesis and AKt1 and mTOR responses, increasing autophagic
  activity, and resulting in deleterious effects in vitro in neurosphere leading human
  fetal neural stem cells (fNSCs) to cell death.
