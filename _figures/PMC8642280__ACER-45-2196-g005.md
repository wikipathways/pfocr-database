caption: 'Schematic drawing showing the effects of insulin‐like growth factor‐1 (IGF‐1)
  and ALC on prepubertal kisspeptin (Kp) synthesis and release. (A) IGF‐1 activates
  the IGF‐1 receptor (IGF‐1R) / insulin receptor substrate‐1 (IRS‐1) complex, which
  subsequently initiates critical phosphorylation within the Akt‐mediated pathway
  to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), hence resulting in increased Kp synthesis
  and release. (B) ALC blocks the activation of IGF‐1R/IRS‐1 complex by inhibiting
  the phosphorylation of IRS‐1 resulting in the inhibition of key downstream phosphorylation
  within the Akt pathway to mTOR, thus suppressing Kp synthesis and release. The detrimental
  effects of ALC on the IGF‐1/IRS‐1 complex and subsequent suppression of the Kp synthesis
  pathway are shown in red. Phosphorylated site, p; ras homologue enriched in brain,
  Rheb; tuberous sclerosis complex 2, TSC2. (With permission, © 2018 by, Hiney JK,
