caption: Jasmonate singaling pathway map was constructed by CellDesigner4.4 using
  systems biology graphical nonation (SBGN). A total number of 37 reactions and 44
  species were included. The process diagrams, explicitly displaying unknown molecule,
  receptors, proteins, protein in phosphorylated forms, simple molecules and different
  cellular compartment. The active state of the molecules is indicated by a dashed
  line surrounding the molecule and defense response in the form of phenotype symbol
  with different colors and shape.
