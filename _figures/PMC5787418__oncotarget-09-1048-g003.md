caption: (A) Enrichment analysis was performed for genes in the turquoise module.
  For the Gene Ontology BP terms, the Cytoscape app, Enrichment Map was used to identify
  the most correlated terms for genes in the turquoise module. One node represents
  one biological process. The node size increased with number of genes. The thickness
  of the edges between two terms is proportional to the similarity coefficient of
  the associated terms. (B) The enriched KEGG pathway of the genes in the turquoise
  module. (C) The overlapped genes between ribosomal protein-coding genes and those
  in the turquoise module. The p-value was calculated using the hypergeometric test.
