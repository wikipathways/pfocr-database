caption: Relationship between the regulation of TFPI2 expression in cancer cells and
  host cells. The signaling pathway constituents numbered 1 to 21 in the figure are
  described in sections of the text labeled as Figure 2(1,2), and so forth. Arrows
  denote activation, while T-shaped symbols represent inhibition. ACTN4, actinin 4;
  AP-1, activator protein 1; AP-2α, activator protein 2 alpha; CLIP1, CAP-Gly domain-containing
  linker protein 1 (CLIP1); COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; DNMT1, DNA methyltransferase
  1; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HGF,
  hepatocyte growth factor; IL-10, interleukin-10; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase; MBD3, methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 3; MMP,
  matrix metalloproteinase; MYH9, myosin 9; MITF, melanocyte-induced transcription
  factor; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma; PSAP, prosaposin; SLUG, snail family transcriptional repressor 2;
  TAM, tumor-associated macrophages; TFPI2, tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2; TGF-β,
  transforming growth factor beta; TGFBI, transforming growth factor beta-induced;
  TIRAP, TIR domain containing adaptor protein; TMPRSS4, transmembrane protease serine
  4; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; VEC, vascular endothelial cells; VEGF,
  vascular endothelial growth factor; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells
