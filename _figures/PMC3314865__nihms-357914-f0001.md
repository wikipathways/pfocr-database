caption: Inhibition of BRAF prevents proteasomal degradation of FOXO3a and BIM by
  blocking MEK/ERK mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3a at Ser294, Ser344 and Ser425
  as well as phosphorylation of BIM at Ser69. However, in some melanomas with constitutive
  PI3K/AKT activity, increased AKT signaling leads to phosphorylation and nuclear
  exclusion of FOXO3a resulting in decreased expression of BIM. Both the MAPK pathway
  and AKT pathways can also regulate the activity of BAD through direct phosphorylation.
