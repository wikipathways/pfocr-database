caption: Summary and proposed working model for the role of the stress polarity signaling
  (SPS) pathway in the gut barrier. Genetic, epigenetic, or dysbiosis-induced inhibition
  of the SPS-pathway leading to stress-induced tight junction-collapse and loss of
  cell polarity. Loss of the SPS-pathway (in aging and during cancer initiation) is
  accompanied by collapse of epithelial tight junctions and loss of cell polarity,
  which is permissive to a gene expression signature that promotes leakiness of the
  gut barrier (high claudin-2) and inflammation (MCP1, IL8). Pharmacologic augmentation
  of the SPS-pathway with AMPK agonists may resist and reverse the above.
