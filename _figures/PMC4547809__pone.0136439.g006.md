caption: 'Each graph is composed of columns for each of the seven developmental stages,
  from left (S1) to right (S7), and rows representing each candidate gene. CHS: chalcone
  synthase; CHI: chalcone isomerase; F3H: flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3’H: flavanoid
  3’-hydroxylase; DFR: dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS/LDOX: anthocyanidin synthase/
  leucocyanidin oxygenase; F3GT: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase; FLS: flavonol
  synthesis; LAR: leucocyanidin reductase; ANR: anthocyanin reductase; 5GTs: 5-glucosyltransferases;
  RTs: rhamnosyltransferases; ATs: acyltransferases; MTs: methyltransferases. Expression
  level was represented by a color scale ranging from saturated green for RPKM = 0
  to saturated red for RPKM = 100. Insert broken line graphs are the verification
  through qRT-PCR from three biological replicates. Error bars represent SE. Asterisks
  indicate significantly different (**P<0.01) from value at 110 DAA (S5).'
