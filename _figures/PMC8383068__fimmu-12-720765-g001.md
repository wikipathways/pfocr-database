caption: The three functions of ISG15. (A) The ISGylation pathway during infection.
  After detecting the presence of an intra- or extracellular pathogen, several antimicrobial
  signaling pathways lead to the expression of ISGs, including ISG15 and its conjugation
  machinery. The covalent attachment of ISG15 to substrate proteins, also called ISGylation,
  relies on the activities of an E1 (UBA7) (1), E2 (UBE2L6) (2) and E3 (hHERC5/mHERC6)
  (3) enzyme. The product of the ISG15-conjugation pathway is an ISGylated host or
  viral protein (4). Target modification by ISG15 has a widespread negative effect
  on the replication, growth, egress and infectivity of four major classes of pathogens,
  including viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa (). Deconjugation is catalyzed by
  USP18 which releases ISG15 from its substrate (5) (). (B) Intra- and extracellular
  functions of free ISG15. Apart from its activity as a ubiquitin-like conjugate,
  ISG15 also exists in a free form with functions both inside and outside the cell.
  (1) Type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is the main pathway for induction of ISG15
  and the ISGylation machinery, including the deISGylase USP18. Binding of IFN-I to
  the dimeric IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1/2) results in recruitment and activation of Janus
  activated kinases (JAKs) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). Consequently, the JAKs phosphorylate
  STAT1 and STAT2 which dimerize and form a three-protein complex with IRF9. This
  complex translocates to the nucleus where it binds to IFN-responsive regulatory
  elements (ISRE) to initiate transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Among
  these genes is Usp18, which, in addition to its enzymatic activity, also functions
  as a negative regulator of IFN-I signaling by binding to IFNAR2 (). There, it prevents
  dimerization of the receptor and blocks recruitment of JAKs which puts a brake on
  IFN-I-signaling (). There, it prevents dimerization of the receptor and blocks recruitment
  of JAKs which puts a brake on IFN-I-signaling (). In humans, this function depends
  on direct interaction with ISG15 which protects USP18 from proteasomal degradation
  (). Apart from its role in IFN-I signaling, free ISG15 also blocks the activity
  of certain enzymes, impairs viral functions by sequestering viral proteins, regulates
  autophagy (). (2) When ISG15 is not conjugated to other proteins, it also becomes
  secreted through an unknown non-canonical secretion pathway (, ). In the extracellular
  space, it acts as a cytokine for NK and T cells where it binds to LFA-1 and induces
  the secretion of IFN-γ and IL-10 from secretory granules (). The mechanism relies
  on a synergy between IL-12 and ISG15 where IL-12 triggers the expression of IFN-γ
  and ISG15 promotes the secretion of IFN-γ through downstream activation of SRC kinases.

  such as CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-1 and IL-6 (, ). Figure created with BioRender.com.
