caption: Metabolic reprogramming in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC upregulates
  several key glycolytic enzymes and transporters such as GLUT, HK, LDH, and MCT,
  therefore displaying high rate of glycolysis and glycolytic branched pathways, including
  serine synthesis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for NADPH generation, and hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP) for protein glycosylation. Other pathways such as fatty
  acid oxidation (FAO), glutaminolysis and cystine uptake are also induced in TNBC
  to meet its bioenergetic or biosynthetic demands, and mitigate reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) that is generated from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Enzymes that are
  upregulated in TNBC are shown as light-yellow ovals, and enzymes downregulated in
  TNBC are shown as gray ovals.
