caption: Molecular pathways are altered due to modulation of signaling pathway in
  skin cancer. Skin carcinogens lead to higher level of DNA adducts formation, ROS,
  lipid perioxidation, and 8-oxoG. Afterwards, major events like inflammation, angiogenesis,
  immunosuppression, higher proliferation, lesser apoptosis, enhanced DNA damage,
  and cell survival take place. Upregulated and downregulated molecules are depicted
  by arrows represented in upper and lower direction, respectively.
