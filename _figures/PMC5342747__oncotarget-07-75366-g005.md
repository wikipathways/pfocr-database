caption: IGF-1-induced IGF1R pathway activation might promote TAM polarization. EGFR
  inhibition in colon cancer cells altered the secreted cytokine profile. Secreted
  IGF-1 concentrations decreased when EGFR was inhibited in colon cancer cells, and
  IGF-1-induced TAM polarization was inhibited; experiments using the IGF1R inhibitor
  AG1024 and IGF-1 neutralizing antibody confirmed this effect. In conclusion, EGFR
  signaling pathway activity promoted IGF-1 secretion, which in turn induced TAM polarization.
