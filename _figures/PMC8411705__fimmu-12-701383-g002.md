caption: Neutrophils in tumor microenvironment. TANs participate in different stages
  of tumorigenesis, and are polarized into N2 (pro-tumor) in the presence of TGF-β,
  and polarized into N1 (antitumor) in the presence of IFN-β in the TME. (A) APC-like
  neutrophils from immature neutrophils with presence of GM-CSF and IFNγ express MHC
  I/II and the co-stimulatory molecules CD86, 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) and OX40 ligand
  (OX40L), which enhance T cell immunity. UTCαβ, essential for effective antitumor
  immunity, can be polarized to a type 1 immune response and IFNγ production through
  IL-12 production from macrophage which was amplified by neutrophils. Different stimuli
  (G-CSF) and chemokines of CXCL5/8, and CCL2, LPS, and IFNβ promote an oxidative
  burst and the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as well as blocking TGFβ pathway.
  Collectively, H2O2 triggers the activation and opening of TRPM2, and further leads
  to a lethal influx of calcium (Ca2+) into tumor cells. (B) N2 phenotype promoted
  the tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression. Neutrophils express immune
  check point receptor of PDL1 and VISTA. They also have been shown expression of
  ARG1, ROS, and NO in the presence of G-CSF and TGFβ in TME, which inactivate T cells.
  HMGB1 from the release of NETs can activate TLR9-depedent pathway which sustain
  tumor cells proliferation. NE and MMP9 cleave laminin-111, and then cleaved laminin-111
  triggers the proliferation of tumor cells through activation of integrin signaling.
  Neutrophils promote angiogenesis through the release of the pro-angiogenic factors
  BV8, S100A8/9, and MMP9 that activate VEGFA. TANs, tumor-associated neutrophils;
