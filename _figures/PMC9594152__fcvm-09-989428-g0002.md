caption: Sex-specific gene expression patterns and sexual hormones influence EC response
  to stimuli and EC-HDL cross talk. ECs derived from female donors (left) display
  reduced sensibility to stress and inflammation thanks to the activation of sex-specific
  pathways involved in stress response. Estradiol is able to reduce inflammation by
  reducing MCP-1 release and VCAM-1 expression. Furthermore, estradiol bound to HDLs
  is able to strongly activate SR-BI pathway increasing the NO production (, , , ).
  On the contrary, ECs derived from male donors (right) display a stronger susceptibility
  to inflammation, increased levels of oxidative stress and autophagy (–). Testosterone
  also contributes to create a pro-inflammatory environment by favoring the transformation
  of macrophages into foam cells (). Estrogens stimulate NO production in both sexes
  through the activation of ER receptors (). In contrast, androgen receptors are able
  to increase the expression of genes involved in cell viability, proliferation and
  angiogenesis/repair both in men and women ECs ().
