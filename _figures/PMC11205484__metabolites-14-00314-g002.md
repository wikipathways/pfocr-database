caption: 'Biosynthetic Pathways of Protectins and Maresins in Macrophages and MaR-2
  in Brown Adipose Tissue Activation. Right Side: The biosynthetic pathway of both
  Protectins and Maresins as derived in macrophages. Lower Left Corner: In obesity,
  thermogenesis activates brown adipose tissue (BAT) via cold-induced stimulation
  of β3-adrenergic receptors and triggers the upregulation of ALOX12 (12-lipoxygenase)
  and soluble epoxide hydrolase enzymes, leading to the biosynthesis of MaR-2. Bottom
  Right: In the liver, MaR2 significantly increases levels of both infiltrating CD45+CCR2-Ly6Clo
  monocytes, triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2)+ Kupffer cells
