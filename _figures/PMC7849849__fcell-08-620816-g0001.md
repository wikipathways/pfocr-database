caption: CHCHD2 and role play. CHCHD2 in mitochondria under stress or under external
  stimulus controls apoptosis in cancer. Among the numerous proteins and protein complexes
  that control apoptotic pathways, IAP (inhibition of apoptosis) proteins play an
  important role. There are two predominant ways by which IAP proteins regulate apoptosis.
  c-IAP proteins do not bind caspases at a physiologically meaningful level. Instead,
  they regulate caspase activation indirectly through their E3 ligase activity and
  modulation of TNF-mediated cell death as well as Toll signaling, innate immunity
  and NF-κB pathways. Anti-apoptotic activity of XIAP stems primarily from its direct
  binding to and inhibition of caspase-3,−7, and−9. On the other hand, IAP's are negatively
  regulated by IAP-antagonists like second mitochondrial derived activator of caspases
  (SMAC). Upon triggering of intrinsic pathway, SMAC is released into cytosol where
  caspase activation is initiated leading to programmed cell death. It is believed
  that CHCHD2 drives this principal cell fate interplay thereby acting as a vital
  switch in regulating mitochondrial mediated apoptosis.
