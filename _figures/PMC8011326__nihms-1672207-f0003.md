caption: A) MID1 is involved in the proteasome-dependent cleavage of the Fu kinase
  domain, leading to GLI3A (activator) translocation into the nucleus. This process
  activates Shh target genes expression increasing Shh signalling. Silencing of MID1
  (red writings) impairs Fu cleavage thus reducing Shh signalling. B) In Xenopus,
  an overlapping expression of mid1 (in pink) and pax6 (in yellow) is observed in
  the optic stalk, in early stages during the development of the visual system. mid1
  is expressed within the forming optic stalk under the control of Shh. Here, mid1
  regulates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Pax6 protein that is
  cleared from the optic stalk region, setting the border between the optic stalk
  and the retina via Mid1. C) In chicken development, both Shh (dark red) and cMid1
  (pink) are initially expressed bilaterally in the Hensen’s node (black) until stage
  5. cMid1 then induces the expression of Bmp4 (green) on the right side of the node.
  Bmp4 represses right-sided Shh expression, thus restricting Shh to the left side
  of the node. Left-sided Shh represses cMid1 expression on the left, restricting
  it to the right side of the node, together with Bmp4. (For interpretation of the
  references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
