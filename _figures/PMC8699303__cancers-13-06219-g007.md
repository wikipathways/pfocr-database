caption: Spectrum, or phenotypic continuum of dynamic, cancer-relevant processes promoted
  by Notch signalling that result in various aspects of tumour cell plasticity. The
  transgression between epithelial and mesenchymal states, also towards increased
  stemness, represents a dynamic process that is influenced by a plethora of internal
  (genetic, epigenetic) and external (ECM, TME, growth actors, and cytokines) factors.3.3.
