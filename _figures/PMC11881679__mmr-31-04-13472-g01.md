caption: AAT is involved in the regulation of the cell signaling pathways and the
  pathogenesis of disease. AAT is involved in four main signaling pathways. (A) LPS
  binds to the ligand TLR4 and induces the release of cellular inflammatory factors
  due to the TLR signaling pathway. By contrast, AAT inhibits membrane TLR4 levels
  and IκBα phosphorylation, thereby reducing the release of cellular inflammatory
  factors. Tak1-tab1/2 is a protein kinase complex. TARF6 activates TAK1 kinase, TAK1
  protein phosphorylates Mkk4/7, and MKK4/7 activates the JNK pathway by double-phosphorylating
  the JNK TPY domain. Eventually, inflammatory factors are produced. AAT inhibits
  the phosphorylation of MKK4/7, thereby inhibiting the production of inflammatory
  factors. (B) TNF-α binds to the receptor TNFR1 and induces the release of cellular
  inflammatory factors due to the NF-κB signaling pathway. AAT reduces TNFR1 levels
  and inhibits IκBα phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting the production of inflammatory
  factors. (C) STS binds to the receptor RTK/GPCR and induces the Akt signaling pathway.
  AAT blocks apoptosis induced by STS. (D) STS binds to receptor RTKs and induces
  the MAPK signaling pathway. AAT blocks the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P90RSK
  by STS, thereby inhibiting apoptosis. The figure was drawn using Adobe Illustrator
