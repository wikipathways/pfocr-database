caption: The Liver X Receptor (LXR) pathway as the result of the integration between
  transcriptomic and metabolomic data. The scheme was generated using the Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Upregulated and downregulated molecules detected
  by RNA-Seq are shown in red and green, respectively. Functionally activated or inhibited
  molecules are shown in orange or blue, respectively, together with their interactions
  (arrows).
