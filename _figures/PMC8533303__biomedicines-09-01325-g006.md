caption: Modulation of the cMyc-HIF1α pathway by BRT. The compound downregulates expression
  of both cMyc and HIF1α, presumably via an interference with upstream effectors,
  such as mTOR and Rs/RAF. BRT also inhibits the direct interaction between cMyc and
  HIF1α. These different actions lead to a reduction in expression of specific proteins,
  including PD-L1, of which membrane expression is massively attenuated by BRT. These
  effects lead to inhibition of angiogenesis and cancer cell proliferation (adapted
  from []).
