  Analysis. Differentially expressed proteins are color coded as unique to b23 (gray),
  upregulated in b23 (shades of red), and upregulated in b1 (yellow). The upregulated
  proteins are labeled with the abundance fold change relative to the CAN stage with
  the lowest abundance. Colored rectangular boxes next to identified proteins represent
  correlation coefficient (from −1 [green] to +1 [red]) between the protein and gene
  expression across the three stages of CAN.
