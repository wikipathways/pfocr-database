caption: The upregulation and downregulation of Hes1 in the Notch signaling pathway.
  After the TBI in mice, the RNAi downregulated the expression of Hes1, and the NSCs
  in the DG differentiated into neurons heavily (the blue arrows). The extracts from
  the injured spinal cord upregulated the expression of Notch1 and Hes1, activated
  the Notch signaling pathway, and promoted the proliferation of NSCs (the gray arrows).
