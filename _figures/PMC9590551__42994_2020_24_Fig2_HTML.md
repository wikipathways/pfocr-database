caption: RLK-mediated pathway regulates distal root meristem homeostasis. CLE40 generated
  from the differentiated columella cells and diffused into the columella stem cells
  is recognized by ACR4 and CLV1 to restrict the expression of WOX5 in the quiescent
  center. PP2A-3 is phosphorylated by ACR4 and can also dephosphorylate ACR4 to facilitate
  the membrane localization of ACR4. Arrows indicate positive interactions; barred
  arrows indicate repressive interactions
