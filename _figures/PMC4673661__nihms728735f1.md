caption: (A) Activation of Wnt/βcatenin in osteoblasts/osteoblast precursors increases
  bone mass by increasing OPG production, which reduces bone resorption, without apparent
  effect on osteoblast production. (B) Activation of Wnt/βcatenin signaling in osteocytes
  increases both bone formation and bone resorption, with a positive balance that
  results in bone gain. (C) Activation of Wnt signaling in all osteoblastic cells
  induced by neutralizing antibodies to sclerostin increases bone formation and initially
  decreases the serum levels of the bone-resorption marker CTX in both mouse and clinical
  models, that eventually come back to control levels. These findings suggest that
  osteocytes, rather than less-differentiated cells in the osteoblastic lineage, might
  mediate anabolism induced by systemic activation of the Wnt/βcatenin pathway, with
  neutralizing antibodies of sclerostin.
