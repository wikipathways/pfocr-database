caption: TGF-β-mediated induction of the NUAK kinases and their opposing effects on
  TGF-β signaling output. (A) TGF-β ligand binding to its respective receptor leads
  to the activation of SMAD2/SMAD3, as well as subsequent SMAD2/SMAD3/SMAD4 complex
  formation and nuclear translocation, and ultimately results in the transcriptional
  induction of NUAK1 and NUAK2. (B) Upon their induction, the opposing effects of
  the NUAK kinases on the TGF-β pathway are depicted, with NUAK1 inhibiting and NUAK2
  enforcing various established TGF-β signal outputs.
