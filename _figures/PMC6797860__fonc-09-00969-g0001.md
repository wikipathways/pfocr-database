caption: 'Receptor composition of IL-12 family members and related cytokines. (A)
  The IL-12 family members are heterodimeric in composition and signal via heterodimeric
  receptors. IL-27, composed of p28 and EBI3, shares common subunits with IL-35 (p35
  and EBI3) and IL-39 (p19 and EBI3). The p28 subunit has also been shown to have
  biological activity in the absence of EBI3, known as IL-30. In addition to subunit
  sharing with IL-27 and IL-39, IL-35 shares the p35 subunit with IL-12. p28 is also
  known to form complexes with CLF and sIL-6Rα. Signaling of all IL-12 family members,
  IL-30, and other known p28 complexes, predominantly activate the JAK/STAT pathway.
  Each cytokine preferentially activates specific STATs to achieve its functional
  role, although other phosphorylated STATs have been observed. (B) Amino acid sequence
  overlays for human p28 (accession number: NP_663634.2) with p35 (accession number:
  NP_000873.2) and EBI3 (accession number: NP_005746.2) with p40 (accession number:
  NP_002178.2) were aligned using the T-COFFEE-espresso program (). Shared amino acids
