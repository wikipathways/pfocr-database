caption: A scheme for the role of ADD-1/SREBP-1c in insulin action. Insulin signaling
  through insulin receptors on responsive cells induces, by an as yet uncertain pathway,
  increased transcription of the ADD-1/SREBP-1c gene. Insulin also may affect this
  protein by phosphorylation and by altering processing. ADD-1/SREBP-1c then acts
  on promoters in insulin target genes to increase (and possibly decrease in other
  cases) gene expression. ADD-1/SREBP-1c also may influence insulin action by affecting
  the function and/or expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ),
  which may then also influence insulin action.
papertitle: ADD-1 provides major new insight into the mechanism of insulin action.
