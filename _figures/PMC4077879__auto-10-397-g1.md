caption: Figure 1. Relevant nodes of the canonical autophagic pathway that are specifically
  engaged in different modalities of unconventional autophagy against membranous compartments.
  The canonical autophagic pathway flows from the ULK1-MTOR-RB1CC1 complex to LC3-II
  synthesis (horizontal arrows). The BECN1-PIK3C3-ATG14 complex is directly or indirectly
  activated during LAP and entosis (A). NODs and TMEM59 (and perhaps CLATHRIN) induce
  the ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1 complex by interacting with ATG16L1 (B). BNIP3L/NIX and PARK2
  (through ubiquitination, UB) engage the pathway at the level of LC3 (C). The end
  result in all cases is LC3 labeling of the targeted membranous structure.
