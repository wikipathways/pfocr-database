caption: Protein regulatory network of AcMYBs protein in kiwifruit. (a) Protein regulatory
  networks of MYBs and structural genes of phenylpropanoid pathway. (b) Protein regulatory
  networks of MYBs and structural genes of lignin metabolic pathway. The purple line
  represents that interaction of the experimental results. Yellow-green, black and
  blue lines represent text mining, co-expression and protein homology, respectively.
