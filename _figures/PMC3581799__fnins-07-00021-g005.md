caption: 'Cell-to-cell signaling network generated by ingenuity pathway analysis of
  differentially expressed genes: Molecules are represented as nodes, and the biological
  relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line). All edges are supported
  by at least one reference from the literature, from a textbook, or from canonical
  information stored in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The intensity of the node color
  indicates the degree of up- (red) or down- (green) regulation. Nodes are displayed
  using various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product. Edges
  are displayed with various labels that describe the nature of the relationship between
  the nodes. Top: the nicotinamide treated injured animals compared to vehicle treated
  injured animal. Bottom: the vehicle treated injured animals compared to sham controls
  highlighting only the genes affected by nicotinamide treatment shown in the top
  figure.'
