caption: Extended compartmentalized lignin pathway model in B. distachyon. Conversion
  of p-coumaric acid to p-coumaroyl CoA by 4CL and diffusion flux D9 are necessary
  to explain label incorporation into H-lignin in experiments with labeled phenylalanine.
  Conversion of p-coumaric acid to caffeic acid by C3H and the diffusion flux D10
  are necessary to explain label incorporation into ferulic acid in the same labeling
  experiments with phenylalanine. The metabolic channel in the ER compartment keeps
  some of the 13C-label from being diluted by the cytosol diffusion fluxes and permits
  preferential incorporation of phenylalanine and tyrosine in S- and G-lignin
