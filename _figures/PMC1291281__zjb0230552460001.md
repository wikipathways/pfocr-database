caption: '(A) The two different benzoate pathways in LB400. The benzoyl-CoA pathway
  is present in two copies: one on the chromosome (boxC) and one on the megaplasmid
  (boxM). Proteins that have been linked with a particular reaction are indicated.
  For proteins identified in this study, molecular weight-corrected normalized volumes
  are given for each of five physiological states: Succ-ML; Benz-ML; Benz-TP; Biph-ML;
  and Biph-TP. A value of 0 means the protein spot was not detected in that condition.
  LR indicates poor resolution in the area where that spot was expected. (B) The biphenyl
  pathway in LB400. The full protein names are as follows: BCL, benzoate-CoA ligase;
  BoxBA, benzoyl-CoA oxygenase/reductase; BoxC, benzoyl-CoA-dihydrodiol lyase; ADH,
  aldehyde dehydrogenase; BenABC, benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase (large, small, and reductase
  subunits); BenD, cis-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate dehydrogenase;
  CatA, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase; CatB, muconate cycloisomerase; CatC, muconolactone
  δ-isomerase; PcaD, 3-oxoadipate enol-lactonase; PcaIJ, 3-oxoadipate CoA-transferase
  subunits A and B; PcaF, β-ketoadipyl-CoA thiolase; BphAEFG, biphenyl dioxygenase
  (large, small, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin reductase subunits); BphB, biphenyldihydrodiol
  dehydrogenase; BphC, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase; BphD, 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate
  hydrolase; BphH, 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate hydratase; BphI, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate
  aldolase; and BphJ, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.'
