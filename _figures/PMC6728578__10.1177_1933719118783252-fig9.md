caption: Key proteins involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) following DNA double-strand
  breaks (DSBs). A simplified representation of the key protein involvement in the
  DDR that is initiated, amplified, and propagated in response to DNA DSBs and the
  outcomes of each signaling pathway. Color identifiers correspond to proteins categorized
  by the type (eg, gold indicates DNA damage mediators), while “P” designates a phosphorylated
  protein. Magenta “P” is indicative of ATM/ATR-mediated phosphorylation; light blue
  “P,” CHK2/CHK1-mediated phosphorylation.
