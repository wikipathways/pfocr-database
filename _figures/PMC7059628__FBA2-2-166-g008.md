caption: Comparison between wild‐type and gas7‐knockout neurons of mitofusin regulation
  by the PINK1 and parkin‐mediated mitophagy pathway. Comparison of the mitochondrial
  distribution between wild‐type and gas7‐knockout neurons and differences in the
  regulatory pathway, as well as summarized results of biochemical analyses, differences
  in mitochondrial morphology as observed by microscopy, and metabolic differences
  for wild‐type and gas7‐knockout mice
