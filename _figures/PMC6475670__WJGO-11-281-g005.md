caption: Tumor necrosis factor-α signaling in gastric cancer. Up-regulation of TNFR2
  and anti-apoptotic mediators results in predominance of cell survival pathway gene
  expression. After tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/TNFR2 interaction, TRAF2, TRAF1 and
  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) bind to the receptor, which results in NF-κB
  activation and consequent transcription of anti-apoptotic genes, such as cFLIP.
  Down-regulation of TNFR1 and CASP3 indicate impairment of the apoptotic pathway.
  Interaction of TRAF2 with TNFR1 through TRADD disturbs formation of the death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC) or also called Complex II, which cleaves and activates
  caspase-8 and caspase-3. In addition, cFLIP induced by NF-κB inhibits activity of
  the DISC, rendering cells resistant to apoptosis. miRNAs regulate several genes
  of this pathway by interfering with cellular processes that contribute to gastric
  carcinogenesis.
