caption: In contrast, dynamin 3 has tumor suppressive role. Inhibition or depletion
  of the Akt/GSK3β signalling pathway will prevent the function of dynamin 1 in lung
  cancer cells. Moreover, inhibition of dynamin 2 interaction with Vav1 will stop
  the activation of Rac1, and a method that prevents phosphorylation of PDGFRα-PI3K/SHP-2
  will reduce the increased tumor growth and cancer cell invasion in certain types
  of cancer. Blockage of hypermethylation of DNM3 by some genetic approach or increase
  of expression of dynamin 3 protein will prevent the tumor development.
