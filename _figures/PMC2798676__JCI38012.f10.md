caption: The physiological function of SCARA5 is to inhibit the activity of the FAK
  signaling pathway by physically associating with FAK. In this way, downregulation
  of SCARA5 due to epigenetic and genetic events in HCC may contribute to tumorigenesis
  and progression, possibly by activating the FAK signaling pathway via initiation
  of the FAK-Src-Cas complex tyrosine phosphorylation cascade, along with increased
  MMP-9 activity. Based on the published data (, , –), the activating FAK-Src-Cas
  complex leads to tumor growth and metastasis, by promoting cell motility, invasion,
  cell cycle progression, survival, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition,
  possibly through the secondary signaling pathways (indicated in bold). Cdc42, cell
  division cycle 42; CRK, v-crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog (avian); DOCK180,
  dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (also known as DOCK1); Grb2, growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2; PKL, paxillin kinase linker.
