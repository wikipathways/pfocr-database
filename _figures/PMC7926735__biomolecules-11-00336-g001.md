caption: 'Schematic representation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling
  regulation by actin remodeling induced by extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness.
  Activation of Rho GTPase by mechanical cues promotes F-actin assembly and actin
  cytoskeleton contractility, which activates TGFβ signaling by: (a) Inducing TGFβ
  ligand release and activation. The ECM-integrin-actin cytoskeleton linkages allow
  integrin to shift toward an active configuration that favors TGFβ release from LTBP/latent
  TGFβ complex. Active TGFβ initiates signaling via TGFβ receptors, which ultimately
  drives the phosphorylation-dependent formation of SMAD2/3-4 complex. This complex
  translocates to the nucleus and facilitates the transcription of TGFβ-dependent
  genes; (b) Accumulating at the front of the nucleus of the lamin-binding protein
  Nesprin-2, which induces SMAD nuclear localization; (c) Inhibiting the formation
  of both cytosolic and nuclear LEMD3-SMAD2/3 complexes, resulting in the relief of
  LEMD3 negative regulation; (d) Activating YAP/TAZ pathway, which regulates both
  SMAD2/3 shuttling and SMAD-dependent transcriptional activity; (e) Controlling myocardin-related
  transcription factor A (MRTF-A) localization to mediate the SMAD-dependent transcriptional
  activity.'
