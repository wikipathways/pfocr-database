caption: The diseases and functions analysis by integrated pathway analysis using
  20 MeDEGs. (a) The top interaction networks involved by 15 MeDEGs. (b) Canonical
  pathway analysis of 20 MeDEGs in PBMC from SSc patients as compared with normal
  controls. Statistically significant pathways were shown. (c) Most genes (12/20)
  are involved with cell movements of leukocytes, cell movement of antigen presenting
  cells, migration of phagocytes, chemotaxis of granulocytes, homing of leukocytes,
  and chemotaxis of neutrophils. (d) The network from 10 DEGs is involved with adhesion
  of vascular endothelial cells, immune response of leukocytes, activation of leukocytes,
  immune response of macrophages, and response of myeloid cells. (e) Most genes (12/20)
  are involved with proliferation of blood cells, cell proliferation of tumor cell
  lines, and proliferation of epithelial cells. (f) The network from 8 genes is involved
  with immune response of cells and inflammatory response.
