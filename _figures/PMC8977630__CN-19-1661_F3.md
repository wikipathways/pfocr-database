caption: Mechanisms implicated in inflammation after TBI. Following a brain insult,
  BBB disfunction and cerebral blood vessels alterations are frequent. Tight junction
  proteins are altered like as pial and intracerebral blood complex. Changes in expression
  of the tight junctions are accompanied with up-regulation of matrix metalloproteases
  (MMPs), involved in BBB alteration. Astrocytes become reactive and start proliferating
  while providing astrogliosis. Cytokines and chemokines are then released by astrocytes,
  altering the BBB and increasing the expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)
  and expression of the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) that is altered after TBI
  and may contribute to cerebral edema and disruption of the BBB. Meanwhile, innate
  and adaptive immune responses are activated, converging in element of the complement
  pathway with the release of proteolytic enzymes. The innate immune response is mainly
  mediated by the interaction between antigen-presenting cells (APC) and damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPS) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by
  a large variety of immune cells including polymorphonucleates, natural killer lymphocytes,
  macrophages, and dendritic cells. After interacting, APC product chemokines and
  cytokines. Particularly after TBI, among DAMPS, high-mobility group box 1 chaperone
  protein (HMGB1) that regulates DNA transcription, adenosine triphosphate (ATP),
  heat-shock proteins (HSP), and chemokines are liberated promoting inflammation and
  oxidative stress. Microglia can be polarized into M1 and M2. M1 microglia is associated
  with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and typically
  involves a tolle-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) signaling after binding to tumor necrosis
  factor-α (TNF-α), and involving MyD88 and the transcription of NF-kB, thus producing
  cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-18),; while M2 activated
  microglia express insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF) promoting oligodendrogenesis and neurogenesis, suppressing inflammation
  and contributing to tissue repair. Microglia activation causes nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide (NADPH) oxidase, inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase
  (COX-2) synthasis, resulting in reactive product of oxygen (ROS), nitric oxide (NO),
  prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2). (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure is
  available in the electronic copy of the article).
