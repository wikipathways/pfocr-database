caption: Interaction of FXR signaling and pathways relevant for zileuton-induced hepatotoxicity.
  DEGs as identified by RNA-seq analysis of transcriptomic data from DO mice were
  analyzed using IPA to discover top enriched pathways relevant for ZILI. The molecular
  relationships of the FXR signaling pathway, which was the most significant canonical
  pathway, and pathways relevant for the liver toxicity outcomes are depicted.
