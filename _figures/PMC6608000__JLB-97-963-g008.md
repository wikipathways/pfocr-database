caption: EtOH metabolism pathway regulates KLF4 expression and function. (A) ADH and
  CYP2E1 convert EtOH to acetaldehyde, which is metabolized by ALDH to form acetate
  and NADH. (B) ADH and CYP2E1 enzyme inhibitor, 4‐MP, inhibits the conversion of
  EtOH to acetaldehyde. Inhibition of acetaldehyde formation led to increased protein
  levels and activity of KLF4. Increased KLF4 leads to decreased M1 marker and increased
  M2 marker expression (C) Cyanamide, which is an ALDH inhibitor, causes increased
  accumulation of acetaldehyde. In the presence of cyanamide, KLF4 expression and
  activity are reduced, which in turn, leads to up‐regulation of M1 macrophage phenotype
  and lowers M2 gene expression.
