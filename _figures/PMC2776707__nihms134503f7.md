caption: A positive feedback interaction with ins-7 and the DAF-2 pathway is featured.
  SKN-1 upregulates many genes that promote detoxification and stress resistance,
  and also downregulates genes that decrease stress resistance, lifespan, or both.
  Among the SKN-1-downregulated genes are both ins-7 and pdk-1 (not shown), each of
  which promotes DAF-2 pathway signaling (see text). The DAF-2 pathway in turn inhibits
  SKN-1 ().
