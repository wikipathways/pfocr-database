caption: 'A. A feed-forward pathway governs maturation of human telomerase RNA (Wild-type
  cells): hTR extended precursors mature directly or are fed into a side pathway and
  oligoadenylated by PAPD5. Oligoadenylated precursors may be deadenylated by PARN
  to form mature hTR, or destroyed by the RNA exosome. Final trimming of hTR precursor
  is achieved through a 3’-5’ RNA exonuclease.(PARN-KO cells): In the absence of PARN,
  oligoadenylated intermediates cannot robustly convert to mature hTR. There is a
  relative increase in oligoadenylated hTR precursors, and a loss of mature hTR.(PAPD5-KO
  cells): In the absence of PAPD5, fewer hTR precursors are fed into the cycle of
  adenylation and deadenylation, leading to rapid maturation of hTR molecules.B. The
  hTR H/ACA domain and dyskerin constitute a 3’ end formation module. The H/ACA domain
  in the presence of dyskerin promotes transcriptional termination and oligoadenylation
  of an extended precursor.'
