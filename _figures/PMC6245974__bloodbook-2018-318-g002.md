caption: 'Updated model of iMCD pathogenesis. Three hypothesized mechanisms may be
  responsible for the iMCD cytokine and chemokine storm: first, the autoimmune/autoinflammatory
  hypothesis involves (1a) auto-antibodies triggering proinflammatory cytokine release
  by antigen-presenting cells that induce the as-yet-unknown hypercytokine-secreting
  cell to release IL-6 or other pathologic cytokines; (1b/c) dysregulated signaling
  in an antigen presenting cell or other as-yet-unknown hypercytokine-secreting cell
  releasing IL-6 or other pathologic cytokines, or (1d) a defect in the regulation
  of activated inflammatory cells. The cytokine and chemokine storm is perpetuated
  by positive feedback of IL-6, other pathologic cytokines, and/or possibly further
  auto-antibody stimulation. Second, the paraneoplastic syndrome hypothesis involves
  a somatic mutation in benign or malignant cells inside or outside of the lymph node
  that causes constitutive cytokine release. Preliminary data suggest these may be
  lymph node stromal cells. Third, the pathogen hypothesis involves either infection
  with HHV-8 that is clinically undetectable, a novel virus, or another pathogen signaling
  proinflammatory cytokines. An active infection by a single virus is less likely
  based on preliminary data generated from pathogen discovery studies. Regardless
  of the etiology, the cytokine and chemokine storm is the common pathway that results
  in the subsequent clinical and histopathological features of iMCD. AAB, autoantibodies;
  AIHA, autoimmune hemolytic anemia; AIT, autoimmune thrombocytopenia; LAD, lymphadenopathy;
