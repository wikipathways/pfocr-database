caption: Metabolic pathway of propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA. Methylmalonic acidemia
  (MMA, MIM#251000) is caused either by a defect in methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase
  (MUT, encoded by the mut gene, on chromosome 6p12.3) or by a defect in the uptake,
  transport or synthesis of 5’-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). A disruption of the
  synthesis of AdoCbl is attributable either to a defect in cblA (251100), which is
  caused by a mutation in the MMAA gene located on chromosome 4q31, or to a defect
  in cblB (251110), which is caused by a mutation in the MMAB gene located on chromosome
  12q24. Combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria occurs in individuals
  with mutations in cblC (277,400, MMACHC gene, located on chromosome 1p34), cblD
  (277,410, MMADHC gene, located on chromosome 2q23), and cblF (277380). Propionic
  acidemia (PA MIM#606054, is caused by deficiency in propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC),
  a biotin-dependent carboxylase that is present in the mitochondrial matrix. This
  enzyme is composed by two subunits, which are encoded by pccA, located on chromosome
  3q22. 3 and pccB, located on chromosome 13q32.3
