caption: Canonical pathway for the endogenous synthesis of catecholamines and possible
  additional pathways involving ethanol. This pathway was described over 70 years
  ago, and posits that there is a single, principal biosynthetic pathway in mammals
  that converts the amino acid tyrosine to dopamine (via L-DOPA), and subsequently
  to norepinephrine and epinephrine (A). The middle portion of the figure (B) shows
  the structure of C12 unlabeled ethanol (left) and the C13 labeled ethanol (right)
  proposed to be used here. The * indicates where the C13 is located within the molecule.
  (C) Various plant-derived phenylic molecules that may combine with ethanol in vivo
  to produce catecholamines. Yellow boxes highlight an ethanol-like moiety already
  present within the flavonoids quercetin and catechin, that could lead to biotransformation
  to catecholamines even in the absence of ethanol.
