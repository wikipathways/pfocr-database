caption: The classic endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathway. In response to
  stress or physiological conditions, the endoplasmic reticulum molecular chaperone
  GRP78/Bip binds to three transmembrane ER resident pressure sensors (A) PERK, (B)
  IRE1, and (C) ATF6. When endoplasmic reticulum stress occurs, misfolded or unfolded
  proteins accumulate in the lumen of the ER, GRP78/Bip dissociates from these three
  pressure sensors and binds to misfolded or unfolded proteins, triggering the UPR.
  The extent to which ER stress and the UPR contribute to the NAFLD process may depend
  on the ability of the UPR to mitigate the damage that leads to disrupted ER homeostasis.
  (A) PERK phosphorylates eIF2α. To alleviate protein overload in the ER, phosphorylation
  of eIF2α reduces translation of mRNAs but can increase translation of some specific
  mRNAs, such as ATF4.(B) Accumulation of unfolded protein in ER induces oligomerization
  of IRE1α on ER membrane and autophosphorylation of IRE1α cytoplasmic structural
  domain, and autophosphorylation of IRE1α can further activate ribonuclease activity;
  and IRE1 has endonuclease activity, which will splice XBP1 mRNA into XBP1s, encoding
  transcription factors and activating expression of UPR target genes.(C) ATF6 moves
  as a vesicle from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where it is cleaved by S1P and
  S2P then migrates to the nucleus to activate XBP1 and genes involved in ER protein
  folding and secretion, such as CHOP. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein
  response; S1P, site 1 protease; S2P, site 2 protease.
