caption: Altered iron metabolism in leukemia includes dysregulation of the ferroportin-hepcidin
  regulatory axis. (A) Typhaneoside treatment of AML cells resulted in ferroptosis
  in AML cells by activating AMPK signaling, accompanied by ferritin degradation and
  ROS accumulation. (B, C) RSL3 and erastin treatment of ALL and DLBCLs resulted in
  ferroptosis, accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation, which was inhibited by
  antioxidant and DFO. (D), Expression of SLC7A11 in CLL cells was down-regulated,
  and the system xc- transporter cystine ability was decreased, leading to the increase
  of intracellular ROS and the promotion of cell ferroptosis. (E), p53 inhibits System
  xc- and promotes ferroptosis in Eμ-Myc lymphoma cells, while the deletion of TP53
  gene accelerates the formation of Eμ-Myc lymphoma model. (F), Artesunate can induce
  ferroptosis in Burkitt lymphoma cells by activating ATF4-CHOP-CHAC1 pathway and
  degrading GSH.
