caption: Schematic illustration of disulfidptosis mechanism. (A) In condition of high
  glucose, glucose enters cells and produces sufficient NADPH via the pentose phosphate
  pathway. Cystine is reduced by NADPH to convert it to cysteine. (B) Cancer cells
  overexpressing cystine transporter SLC7A11 showed high cystine uptake coupled with
  the depletion of NAPDH under the circumstance of glucose starvation, inducing excessive
  accumulation of intracellular disulfide molecules and subsequent cell death. (C)
  The application of disulfidptosis.
