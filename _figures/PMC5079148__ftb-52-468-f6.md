caption: 'Summarized biological effects of curcumin in rescuing the PC12 cell apoptosis
  induced by glutamate: curcumin protective activity against glutamate-induced injury
  through two pathways: the GSH-dependent NO-ROS pathway and the mitochondria-dependent
  NO-ROS pathway, which actually involves the enhancing of GPX cycle (reaction 1 and
  2) to restore the reduced glutathione, increasing the antioxidant defensive capability,
  and protecting the mitochondrial damages by inhibiting calcium ion influx (reaction
  3) and subsequent cyt c release (reaction 4), the NO production (reaction 5), downregulating
  the Ca2+-induced complex I inhibition (reaction 6), the ratio Bax/Bcl-2 (reaction
  10) and cleaved caspase-3 (reaction 11) to avoid apoptosis. In parallel with this,
  curcumin alleviated the NO- -ROS-caspase-independent pathway (reaction 5→14→15→16)
  and oxidative lipid peroxidation (reaction 20→21→12→(13)→22→23→24) to protect PC12
  cells from apoptosis. CAT=catalase, Cur= curcumin, Cyt c=cytochrome c, l-glu=l-glutamate,
  GSH=glutathione, GPX=glutathione peroxidase, GR=glutathione reductase, GSSG=oxidized
  glutathione, MDA=malondialdehyde, NOS=nitric oxide synthase, NO=nitric oxide, PT
  pore=permeability transition pore, ROS=reactive oxygen species, SOD=superoxide dismutase'
