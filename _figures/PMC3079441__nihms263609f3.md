caption: (a) Pharmacological activities of cardiotonic steroids such as ouabain. Pharmacological
  levels of ouabain inhibit the Na,K-ATPase to such an extent that intracellular Na+
  increases, which, in turn, raises intracellular Ca2+ through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.
  The increase in Ca2+ then increases vascular muscle contraction. Physiological levels
  of endogenous ligands, which raise the concentration of intracellular Na+ and thus
  Ca2+, would be expected to act similarly. These concentrations of ouabain would
  also activate Na,K-ATPase-mediated signaling pathways. (b) Stress, volume, pregnancy.
  The effect of physiological levels of endogenous ouabain or ouabain-like compounds.
  With physiological levels of endogenous ligand such as endogenous ouabain or marinobufagenin,
  only the signaling pathway may be activated, as only a few molecules of Na,K-ATPase
  are needed to bind to the ligand as signaling responses are amplified. As only a
  few molecules of Na,K-ATPase are inhibited, this binding is unlikely to raise intracellular
  Na+ levels sufficiently to increase intracellular Ca2+ and activate vascular contraction.
  Still possible is that local concentrations of Na+ increase sufficiently with low
  levels of endogenous Na,K-ATPase ligands to alter vascular tone, as described (–).
