caption: 'Phenyllactate metabolism pathway. The heatmap shows the accumulation of
  metabolites and the copy number of genes among the seven species. Left corner there
  is a scale bar. The circles represent the accumulation levels of metabolites, and
  the data are represented by the average values of three biological replicates and
  normalized with z score standardization. Shades from blue to red represent increasing
  metabolite levels. The rectangular heatmap represents the copy numbers of genes,
  with green representing a high copy number and white representing a low copy number.
  The rectangular box indicates the key enzyme, and the abbreviations are as follows:
  GOT2, aspartate aminotransferase, mitochondrial; TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase;
  hisC, histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase; tyrB, aromatic-amino-acid transaminase;
  ARO9, aromatic amino acid aminotransferase II; fldH, aromatic 2-oxoacid reductase;
  HPPR, hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate reductase; fldA, cinnamoyl-CoA:phenyllactate CoA-transferase;
  UGT1, phenyllactate UDP-glycosyltransferase. Wo, M, R, Wh, S, G and T represent
  wolfberry, maize, rice, wheat, soybean, grape and tomato, respectively'
