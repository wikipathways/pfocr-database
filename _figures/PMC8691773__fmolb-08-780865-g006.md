caption: 'A schematic summarizing the results and illustrating potential mechanisms
  underlying effects of glucose deprivation on O-GlcNAc and ER stress and how they
  might be regulated by NAD+ and its metabolites: 1) In response to glucose deprivation
  there is a decrease in HBP flux, which is supported by the observation that glucosamine,
  which is metabolized to UDP-GlcNAc via the HBP, attenuates the responses to glucose
  deprivation. 2) While the downstream effector of the decreased HBP flux has yet
  to be identified, a likely candidate would the loss of O-GlcNAc from specific site(s)
  on a protein(s) subsequently triggering a release of Ca2+ from the ER/SR. This is
  supported by observations that interventions that decrease ER/SR Ca2+ levels attenuate
  the responses to glucose deprivation. 3) Inhibition of TRPM2 or loss of TRPM2 blocked
  the glucose deprivation responses, suggesting that its activation via glucose deprivation
  resulted in an influx of extracellular Ca2+. In addition, ER/SR Ca2+ release has
  been shown to be sufficient to activate TRPM2 channels. This is supported by earlier
  observations that extracellular Ca2+ was required for the glucose deprivation induced
  increase in O-GlcNAc () and that inhibition of downstream Ca2+signaling pathways
  blunted the increase in ER stress and O-GlcNAc in response to glucose deprivation.
  In addition, SKF96365 a SOCE inhibitor, which also attenuates the response to glucose
  deprivation, is reported to inhibit members of the transient receptor potential
  family including TRPM2 channels (). 4) The TRPM2 mediated influx of Ca2+ activates
  Ca2+/CaM-dependent pathway, which potentially via activation of calcineurin leads
  to increased ER stress and O-GlcNAc levels. This is supported by the observation
  that KN93 a CaMKII and Ca2+/CaM inhibitor and CN585, a calcineurin inhibitor, attenuated
  the responses to glucose deprivation. The links between Ca2+/CaM and the increase
  in ER stress and O-GlcNAc following glucose deprivation are currently not known,
  although calcineurin has been associated with activation of ER stress (). 5) The
  NAD+ metabolites, cADPR and ADPR, are known to activate the RyR releasing ER/SR
  Ca2+ and caffeine a RyR agonist all attenuate the cellular responses to glucose
  deprivation. The SERCA inhibitors thapsigargin (Thg) and CPA, which decrease ER/SR
  Ca2+ levels also blunt the response to glucose deprivation.'
