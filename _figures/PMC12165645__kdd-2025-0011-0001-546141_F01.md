caption: Simplified overview of ISGs and their actions in kidney diseases. ISGs play
  a crucial role in kidney diseases. dsRNA, a common viral signature, triggers the
  activation of ISGs through pathways such as JAK/STAT and PKR. This activation cascade
  leads to a series of pathological events in the kidney, including tubular injury,
  fibrosis, and ER stress. Among the ISGs, ISG15 stands out for its significant contribution
  to fibrosis promotion and cellular proliferation. Additionally, ISG56 and OAS1 have
  been implicated in glomerular damage. The intricate interplay between these ISGs
  and their downstream effects underscores the complex nature of kidney pathology,
  suggesting that ISGs may serve as novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of
  kidney injury
