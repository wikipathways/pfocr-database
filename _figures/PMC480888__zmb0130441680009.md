caption: Role of B-Raf/ERK in regulating Rho-activated pathways leading to actomyosin
  contraction. Actomyosin contraction is regulated by Rho, which acts via the Rho
  kinases (ROCKs). On the one hand, ROCK activates LIMK, which phosphorylates and
  inactivates the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin. On the other hand, ROCK phosphorylates
  and inactivates MLCP, leading to increased MLC20 phosphorylation and myosin ATPase
  activity, contraction of actin stress fibers, and cell movement. The points at which
  Raf/ERK may collaborate with Rho to enhance contractility are shaded. Klemke et
  al. () showed that ERKs activate MLCK, leading to enhanced MLC20 phosphorylation.
  Our data are consistent with a role for B-Raf, through MEK/ERK, in specifically
  regulating the levels of ROCKII and thereby influencing signaling through the LIMK/cofilin
  axis but not through the MLCP/MLC20pathway.
