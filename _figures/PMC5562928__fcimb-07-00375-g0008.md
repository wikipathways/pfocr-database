caption: Mechanistic model of metabolic modifications induced by A. phagocytophilum
  infection in tick ISE6 cells. Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection increases the
  protein levels of PKM2 and PEPCK-M in ISE6 cells. TPI is overrepresented in nymphs,
  midguts and salivary glands, but was not found in ISE6 cells. PEPCK-M transforms
  mitochondrial OAA into PEP. When the tyrosine degradation pathway (i.e., the enzyme
  HPPD) was inhibited using Nitisinone, the levels of PEP did not increase in response
  to A. phagocytophilum infection. This strongly suggested that the A. phagocytophilum-induced
  increase in PEP levels is due to activation of the tyrosine/OAA/PEPCK-M/PEP node.
  Simultaneously, A. phagocytophilum infection inhibits glyceroneogenesis (leading
  to glycerol-3-phosphate), de novo serine synthesis pathway (leading to serine) and
  gluconeogenesis (leading to glucose). PEP is an allosteric inhibitor of TPI and
  the increase in the levels of PEP may contribute to the inhibition of glyceroneogenesis.
  Despite that de novo serine synthesis pathway is inhibited the levels of serine
  increased which may be explained by the upregulation of serine transporters located
  at the cell membrane. Serine is an allosteric activator of PKM2 and the increase
  in the levels of serine may contribute to the activation of glycolysis. During A.
  phagocytophilum infection, the levels of lactate decrease suggesting that the end
  product of glycolysis (i.e., pyruvate) is not transformed into lactate, but enters
  the mitochondria. By this metabolic rearrangement, A. phagocytophilum infection
  increases the cytoplasmic PEP pool which may facilitate the transport of this metabolite
  inside the parasitophorous vacuole, but at the same time controls the bacterial
  burden. Name of enzymes were abbreviated as in Table .
