caption: The lipoate-requiring enzymes. (A) The general 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase reaction.
  ThDP, thiamine diphosphate. (B) The glycine cleavage system (GCV, called glycine
  decarboxylase in plants). The synthesis of serine from N5,N10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate
  and a second molecule of glycine by serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) is not
  part of the glycine cleavage system but plays an important role in some organisms
  and may be a key factor in the first role of lipoic acid in metabolism. The E2 subunit
  of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and the L protein of the glycine cleavage system
  are the same protein. (C) Structure of the LD of Bacillus stearothermophilus PDH
  E2 subunit (PDB code 1LAB).
