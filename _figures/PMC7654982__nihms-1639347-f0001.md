caption: 'Left panel: With the absence of HH ligand, PTCH1 inhibits SMO activity.
  GLI activity is phosphorylated, converting GLI full- length (GLIFL) to repressor
  form (GLIR). GLIR translocates into the nucleus, which binds to HH target gene promoters
  and suppresses their expression. Right panel: The activation of the signaling occurs
  when HH ligands bind to PTCH, HH relieves the inhibition of PTCH to activate the
  signal transduction. SMO transmits a signal to the cytoplasm in a phosphorylation
  cascade leading translocation of GLI activator (GLIA) to the nucleus and binding
  to the target gene promoters and activates the transcription of the target genes.'
