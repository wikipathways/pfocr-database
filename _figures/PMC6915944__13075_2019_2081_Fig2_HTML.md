caption: Metabolic polarisation of macrophages. Circulating monocytes are recruited
  into the synovium whereby they differentiate into non-activated macrophages. Hyperglycaemia,
  insulin resistance, and pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibit AMPK activity resulting
  in HIF-1α stabilisation and increases in aerobic glycolysis. Increases in glycolysis
  are accompanied by increased PPP activity, and both are involved in M1 macrophage
  polarisation. Succinate stabilises HIF-1α. Citrate promotes aerobic glycolysis and
  inflammatory cytokine expression. Obesity and nutrient excess hyperactivate mTORC1
  resulting in Akt inhibition and defective M2 polarisation. M2 polarisation is promoted
  by AMPK activity. AMPK is stimulated by nutrient deprivation, metformin, and adiponectin.
  Resolvin D1 promotes the re-polarisation of macrophages to the M1 phenotype. AMPK,
  5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor
  alpha; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex
