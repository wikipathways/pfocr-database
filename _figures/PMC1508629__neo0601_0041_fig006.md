caption: Proposed model for the role of 15-LO-1 enzyme metabolite, 13-(S)-HODE interaction
  with the IGF-1R, and downstream signaling pathway in proliferation of the prostate
  cancer cells. Cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activity releases plasma membrane-bound
  LA into the cytoplasm (or LA is available by high-lipid diet). Increased 15-LO-1
  activity releases 13-(S)-HODE. 13-HODE (15-LO-1/LA activity) upregulates IGF-1R.
  Stromal growth factor IGF-1 interacts with IGF-1R that in turn activates MAP kinase
  (Erk1/2/MAPK) signaling. Further MAPK-dependent IGF-1R phosphorylation is increased,
  leading to another round of an increased activation of MAPK signaling; this process
  ultimately contributes to increased cellular proliferation. Thus, overexpression
  of 15-LO-1 leads a normal prostate epithelial cell to undergo neoplastic progression
  to a tumor cell.
