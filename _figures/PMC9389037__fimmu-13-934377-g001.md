caption: Cellular alteration and signaling pathway of macrophage-to-myofibroblast
  transition (MMT) in renal fibrosis. The macrophages derived from bone marrow differentiate
  to myofibroblasts, which produce excessive extracellular matrix and progressively
  cause structural and functional impairment of the kidney. Macrophage-to-myofibroblast
  transition plays a crucial role in renal fibrosis through multiple mechanisms, including
  triggering the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smad3 signaling pathways and
  natural killer T cells (NKT)/IL-4 signaling pathways. Activated NKT cells produce
  excessive IL-4, which subsequently combines with IL-4 receptor α and triggers the
  JAK3/STAT6 signaling to enhance the transformation of myofibroblasts. TGF-β binds
  to the TGF-β receptor complex and then phosphorylates the Smad family complex and
  finally activates the Src-centric gene network in bone marrow-derived macrophages
  to promote the MMT process. .
