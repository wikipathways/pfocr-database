caption: Fate of glutamine (Gln) and the origin of ornithine (Orn) in the enterocyte.
  A small portion (14%) of the Gln carbon is incorporated into protein or other acid-insoluble
  material, whereas most of the Gln is deamidated to glutamate (Glu) and ammonia by
  action of mitochondria glutaminase (). Glutamate can be transaminated (2a) or oxidized
  by glutamate dehydrogenase (2b) to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and ammonia. Since this
  is a reversible reaction, glutamine may exchange its amino group. α-KG is further
  metabolized to ketoacids and CO2 and accounts for 18 and 57% of the glutamine carbon,
  respectively. Glu is converted to glutamate-semialdehyde (GSA) by pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  (P5C) synthase (), which is the substrate for Orn transaminase (OAT; 4), generating
  Orn. Proline (Pro) can be oxidized to P5C by action of proline oxidase (); P5C spontaneously
  interconverts to GSA (). Ornithine can be generated directly by hydrolysis of arginine
  (Arg) by arginase (). Carbamyl phosphate (CP), which is synthesized from CO2 and
  ammonia by action of carbomyl phosphate synthase (), condenses with Orn by action
  of Orn carbomyl transferase () to generate citrulline (Cit). Cit accounts for 6%
  of glutamine carbon. Other enzymes involved in this pathway are P5C dehydrogenase
  () and P5C reductase (). Based on Windmueller and Spaeth () and Smith et al. ().
