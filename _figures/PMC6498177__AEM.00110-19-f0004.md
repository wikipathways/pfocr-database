caption: 'Metabolic reconstruction of candidate phylum LCP-89 as predicted by collectively
  analyzing 3 SAGs and 1 MAG belonging to the phylum. All possible substrates potentially
  supporting growth are shown in blue, while predicted final products are shown in
  purple. The inner membrane is depicted as a phospholipid bilayer interrupted by
  membrane proteins color coded as follows: components of the predicted respiratory
  chain are shown in green, the ATPase complex is shown in red, transporters of the
  phosphotransferase system are shown in orange, ABC transporters are shown in brown,
  and secondary transporters are shown in gray. The bacterial microcompartment (BMC)
  is depicted by an octahedral structure showing all reactions predicted to occur
  inside the BMC. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; Amt, ammonium channel transporter; Asp, aspartic
  acid; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; E-I, enzyme I of the PTS; E-IIA-C, subunits
  A, B, and C of enzyme II of the PTS; Fru, fructose; Fru-1,6-PP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
