caption: (A) Schematic diagram of signaling pathways in the epithelial cells at the
  transitional zone of the lens. FGF and integrin signaling promote cell proliferation
  and survival, whereas Notch signaling induced by adjacent lens fiber cells suppresses
  cell differentiation. In addition, Wnt signaling transmitted by Lrp5/6 and Fzd receptors
  converges with cadherin and Yap to regulate cell differentiation, polarity and adhesion.
  (B) In differentiating fiber cells, FGF signaling through the Ras-MAPK pathway activates
  ETS and AP1 family transcription factors to induce expression of lens differentiation
  factors such as Prox1 and c-Maf. FGF also synergizes with Smad-mediated BMP signaling
  in cell differentiation and cooperate with Cx50 in p27-mediated cell cycle exit.
  Cell adhesion molecules integrin and N-cadherin act with Eph/Ephrin receptors to
  induce small GTPases and Src family kinases to promote actin assembly and cell elongation.
