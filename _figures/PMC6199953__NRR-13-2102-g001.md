caption: Drug transport from the nasal cavity to the brain primarily through the neuronal
  pathway via olfactory and trigeminal sensory neurons and secondly through the systemic
  circulation.The neuronal pathway is a direct route of drug transfer to the brain
  while the drug entered into the systemic circulation needs to cross the blood-brain
  barrier (BBB) (Adapted with permission from Agrawal et al., 2018a).
