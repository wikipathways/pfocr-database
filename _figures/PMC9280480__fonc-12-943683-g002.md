caption: Schematic representation of the SUMOylation on the components of Wnt/β-catenin
  pathways. Nuclear translocation of β-catenin is regulated by SUMO. The SUMOylation
  of TCF-4 increases the activity of TCF-4. SUMOylated TCF promotes the binding of
  β-catenin to RanBP2 of the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus. SUMOylation of
  GSK-3β improves kinase activity and protein stability. The SUMOylation of LEF1 and
  its co-expression with PIASy resulted in effective inhibition of LEF1 activity.
  The SUMOylation of Axin had no effect on Wnt signaling. Axam acts as deSUMOylated
  enzyme to downregulate β-catenin and implicates the negative regulation of Wnt signaling
  pathway. SUMO modification negatively regulates CBP transcriptional activity by
  recruiting Daxx. The CBP may act as the SUMO E3 ligase enzyme, which promotes intramolecular
  SUMOylation of adjacent CRD1 domains. Binding of CtBP1 to SUMO increases nuclear
  accumulation. Smad3 SUMOylation is enhanced in the presence of PIASy, resulting
  in translocation to the cytoplasm. Under the influence of PIASy, PIAS1, PIASxα,
  and PIASxβ, SUMOylation reduces the stability and transcriptional activity of Smad4,
  but the effect on Wnt/β-catenin is not clear.
