caption: The regulatory mechanism of bone injuries induced by fluoride. The Bcl2,
  Col1a1, and Fgfr1 genes were involved in the apoptosis of osteoblasts via the PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway, inhibiting bone formation. The Mmp13 and Mmp9 genes caused the
  inflammation of osteoclasts by activating the IL-17 signaling pathway, promoting
  bone resorption. The Bmp2 and Bmp7 genes caused the inflammation of chondrocytes
  by activating the TGF-beta signaling pathway, resulting in bone necrosis
