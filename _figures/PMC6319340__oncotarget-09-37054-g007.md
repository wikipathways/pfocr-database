caption: '(A) SIRT1 is overexpressed in PCa [] (black thick arrow). Metformin treatment
  down-regulates the Sirt1/Pgc-1α/Nrf2 [] and hence the levels of SIRT1 (blue arrow)
  which results in an increase in H2A.Z (black arrow)[] and a restriction in tumor
  growth. (B) Androgen receptor (AR) is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and
  up-regulates the expression of AR-dependent genes (1). During the process histone
  variant H2A.Z is released from promoters and enhancer regions (2) []. Upon metformin
  treatment, the occupancy of H2A.Z observed at the promoter regions and in different
  regions of these genes increases (3-4) and results in a reduction of their expression
  (5). The increase in H2A.Z particularly observed at promoter regions (3) is surprising
  and we suggest that this is the result of an antagonistic mechanism with androgen
  (6) which represses the expression of these genes (7). Hence, H2A.Z plays an important
  role in restricting tumor growth (8). The black arrows indicate the pathway involved
  in AR response and the blue arrows and triangles denote the alterations resulting
  from metformin treatment. Abbreviations: A, androgen; ARE, androgen responsive element.'
