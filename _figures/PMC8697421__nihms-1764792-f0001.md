caption: 'Inborn errors of immunity underlying severe α/γ-HPV infection (red), β-HPV
  infection (blue), or both (in red/blue) are shown. Mutations impairing T-cell activation
  confer a predisposition to infections with α/γ-HPVs, which can underlie common warts
  or giant horns, and with β-HPVs, which can underlie flat warts or tinea versicolor-like
  lesions, and can progress to non-melanoma skin cancer. Inborn errors of immunity
  that impair the T-cell CD28 costimulation pathway (CD28, CARMIL2, CARD11, MAGT1)
  result in a predisposition to α/γ-HPV infections. EVER-CIB1 mutations impair keratinocyte-intrinsic
  immunity and confer a specific predisposition to infection with β-HPVs. GATA2 is
  not shown here because it is expressed by hematopoietic progenitors, and its deficiency
  can confer predisposition to both α/γ− and β-HPV infections due to progressive leukopenia.
  Inborn errors of immunity partially impairing TCR rearrangement (RAG1, RAG2, LIG4,
  NHEJ1, ATM, DCLRE1C, SMARCAL1) or T-cell differentiation (IL7, IL2RG, JAK3) are
  not shown, but can also underlie both α/γ- and β- HPV infections. APCs: antigen-presenting
  cells.'
