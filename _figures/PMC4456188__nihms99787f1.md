caption: The mechanisms by which β-cell failure an apoptosis occur are complex, not
  completely unraveled and involve the interplay of numerous factors and conditions.
  These factors are summarized in Figure 1. Glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity lead to
  the production of ROS, which activate JNK. JNK activity leads to a decrease in IRS
  signaling and may directly be involved in decreased Pdx-1 activity by nucleus to
  cytoplasmic translocation []. In addition, glucose and FA have both been found to
  induce ER stress. Chronic glucose elevation inhibits FA oxidation and favors the
  generation of ceramide and lipid partitioning which ultimately results in β-cell
  dysfunction and apoptosis. AMPK activation promotes fatty acid oxidation by phosphorylation
  and inhibition of acetyl-Coa carboxylase or via down regulation of the transcription
  factor sterol-regulatory-element-binding-protein-1c (SREBP1c) and subsequent decreases
  in acetyl-Coa carboxylase. Glucose and FA also activate the UPR response and induce
  ER stress. The ER stress response and its effectors are activated in response to
  misfolded proteins in order to protect β-cell from apoptosis; however, activation
  of these processes under conditions of long-term elevation of FFA and glucose can
  lead to β-cell dysfunction and ultimately apoptosis. Activation of ER stress leads
  to inhibition of insulin mRNA and protein expression and may also be pro-apoptotic.
  The mechanisms for induction of apoptosis by ER stress are not completely known
  but induction of CHOP is an important component. In addition, induction of ATF3
  and SREBP can downregulate IRS signaling by repressing IRS2 transcription. One interesting
  finding is that inhibition of IRS signaling seems to be a common pathway induced
  by the majority of the mechanisms described for β-cell failure. On additional event
  is the increase in mTOR signaling by nutrient excess (glucose). This results in
  negative feed back inhibition on IRS1 and possibly IRS2 by activation of S6K signaling.
  The decrease in IRS signaling induces GSK3β and FoxO1 function. Activation of these
  molecules ultimately reduces Pdx1 levels and increases the levels of the cell cycle
  inhibitor p27.
