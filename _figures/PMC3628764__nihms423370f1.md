caption: Alternate routes of endocytic traffic of activated tyrosine kinase coupled
  cell surface receptors and the role of Cbl-family protein dependent ubiquitination.
  The schematic shows the EGF-induced activation and endocytosis of EGF receptor (EGFR)
  as a prototype; for simplicity, only clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway is shown.
  EGF activation leads to receptor dimerization, auto-/trans-phosphorylation and recruitment
  of signaling proteins including Cbl proteins. The activated receptors accumulate
  in clathrin-coated pits followed by internalization into early endosomes (EE) and
  traffic to sorting endosomes (SE), late endosome/multi-vesicular body (MVB) and
  finally lysosomes (degradative pathway). Alternatively, internalized receptors can
  be sorted into recycling pathway and returned for further ligand binding and activation
  (Recycling Pathway). Cbl-dependent ubiquitination is thought to serve as an internalization
  signal and as a sorting signal at the level of MVBs. The latter role involves the
  recognition of the ubiquitin modification on the receptor by components of the ESCRT
  complexes to facilitate the sorting of ubiquitinated receptors into internal vesicles
  of the MVB, an event required for lysosomal degradation of activated receptors.
  Non-ubiquitinated receptors or those from which ubiquitin species have been removed
  by deubiquitinases (DUBs) are thought to enter the recycling pathway. Signaling
  proteins that interact with Cbl proteins and are ubiquitinated may also be targeted
  for an alternate mode of degradation in the proteasome.
