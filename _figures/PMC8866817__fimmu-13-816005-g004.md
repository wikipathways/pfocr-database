caption: Mechanisms of DN T cells in cancer treatment. (A) The killing effect of DN
  T cells toward AML cells can be perforin/granzyme B-dependent; IFN-γ enhances the
  effect of NKG2D and DNAM-1 in the DN T cell-mediated inhibition of AML cells. (B)
  NKG2D, DNAM-1 and soluble TRAIL participate in DN T cell-mediated lysis of NSCLC
  cells. (C) DN T cells eliminate pancreatic tumor cells through the Fas/FasL pathway.
