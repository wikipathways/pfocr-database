caption: A representation displaying the two different signaling pathways, RET-dependent
  (A) and RET-independent (B).In RET-dependent, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
  factor (GDNF) binds directly to GDNF family receptor alpha (GFRα)1. Shc is a mediator
  and is a soluble adaptor that “will recruit Ret to lipid rafts and trigger raft-specific
  signaling”. PI3-kinase and phospholipase (PLC-γ) are involved in neuronal transmission.
  The RET-independent pathway has GDNF bound specifically to GFRα1 and p140NCAM, which
  activates the SRC-like kinase Fyn and focal adhesion kinase FAK (Paratcha et al.,
  2003). Both pathways lead to reduced lesion size and increased axon growth and regeneration,
  which in turn leads to increase functional recovery.  is adapted from Rosich et
  al. (2017).
