caption: Following ischemic injury, ROS production is increased in entire BM in a
  Nox2-dependent manner, which is required for increasing hypoxic niche and its downstream
  HIF-1α and VEGF expression throughout the BM. Ischemic injury-induced Nox2-derived
  ROS also increase Akt phosphorylation and its downstream MT1-MMP expression and
  MMP-9 activity in BM. It is possible that ROS and Akt pathway are involved in HIF-1a
  expression through hypoxia-independent mechanism (dotted arrows). These Nox2-dependent
  alterations of BM microenvironment promote progenitor cell survival and expansion,
  thereby promoting their mobilization, leading to reparative neovascularization and
  tissue repair. (ROS; reactive oxygen species, BM; bone marrow, HIF-1α; hypoxia inducible
  factor-1α, MMP; matrix metalloproteinase and MT1-MMP; membrane type1-MMP also known
  as MMP14)
