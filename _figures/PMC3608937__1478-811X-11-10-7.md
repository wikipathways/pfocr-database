caption: 'Proposed mechanism: 1: Under physiological conditions, extracellular ATP
  regulates several intracellular signaling pathways, which involves also calcium
  compartmentalization. 2–3: Acetaminophen incubation directly causes hepatocyte necrosis,
  calcium imbalance and further ATP release. 4: In parallel, challenged viable hepatocytes
  up-regulate several purinergic receptors, probably as a regulatory homeostatic strategy,
  causing ATP hyper-responsiveness. Binding of extracellular ATP to purinergic receptors
  increases intracellular Ca2+ and pulses, which accounted to additional cell necrosis,
  reverberating APAP-induced death. Dampening of extracellular ATP signalling or reducing
  intracellular Ca2+ availability significantly reduced hepatocyte necrosis. Data
  from FHF patients suggest that a similar necrosis-amplification pathway may be involved
  in organ injury progression.'
