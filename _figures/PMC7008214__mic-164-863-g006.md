caption: Schematic diagram depicting VdCmr1-dependent DHN melanogenesis in V. dahliae.
  Key proteins involving the DHN melanogenesis pathway are depicted from the initial
  acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA precursors through production of DHN melanin [4]. The
  Ssk2-Pbs2-Hog1 signalling cascade is a regulator of melanin biosynthesis in V. dahliae
  [14]. The transcription factor VdMcm1 and the polyketide chain shortening enzyme
  Vayg1 also modulate DHN melanogenesis. Our work identified several key genes that
  contribute to DHN melanin biosynthesis and that are regulated by VdCmr1. Some of
  these genes are found within the cluster enriched in DHN melanin biosynthetic genes
  within the V. dahliae genome. The non-melanin synthesis-related genes, up or downregulated
  during microsclerotial development [7], are regulated by VdCmr1 as demonstrated
  in this study; these genes VDAG_03079 (catalase) and VDAG_08741 VDECH (endochitinase,
  VDAG_08741) also reside outside of the gene cluster enriched in melanin biosynthetic
  genes. aVDAG_03665 may catalyse both T4HN and T3HN reductase steps based upon the
  strong homology of VDAG_03665 to the THR1 protein of Colletotrichum lagenarium,
  which can catalyse both T4HN and T3HN reductase steps [41].
