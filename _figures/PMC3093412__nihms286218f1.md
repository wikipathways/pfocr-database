caption: Detection of DNA and RNA in the lumen of endosomes by TLR9 and TLR7, respectively,
  triggers signal transduction cascades leading to the production of type-I interferons
  (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines. Distinct endosomes are formed during the process
  of endosome maturation, which accompanies the process of TLR activation (e.g., TLR9
  is activated by proteolytic processing in acidified endosomes), and the recruitment
  of signaling proteins including MyD88, IRAK4, IRAK1, TRAF6 and TRAF3. Recruitment
  of these proteins to distinct endosomes leads to the activation of NF-κB and IRF7,
  which in turn govern the production of inflammatory cytokines and IFN, respectively.
  Secreted IFN binds to IFN receptor and activates the JAK-STAT pathway to induce
  many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). One of these ISGs is Viperin, which is localized
  on the cytosolic surface of lipid bodies. Viperin assembles a signaling complex
  on lipid bodies, greatly facilitating IRF7 activation, thereby contributing to high
  levels of IFNα production in pDCs.
