caption: A. Origin of nucleotide metabolism ∼3.8 Gy ago; ndFF  = 0). B. Emergence
  of the nucleotide interconversion (INT), catabolism and salvage (CAT) and biosynthetic
  (BIO) pathways ∼3.5 Gy ago (ndFF  = 0.061–0.073). C. Fully connected INT, BIO and
  CAT pathways ∼3 Gy ago (ndFF  = 0.187). Pathways mediated by prebiotic chemistries
  that are plausible and most parsimonious are depicted in red and enable the growth
  of the emergent protein enzyme-mediated pathways of purine metabolism by structural
  and functional innovation and piecemeal recruitment (recruited FFs are indicated
  with numbers). Unknown candidate or withering prebiotic pathways are indicated with
  dashed lines. We note that primordial reactions of the BIO pathway (top of metabolic
  diagram) in B could have been non-operational in the absence of suitable prebiotic
  chemistries until later in evolution. FF structures associated with individual enzymatic
  activities (described in EC nomenclature) are painted according to their age, in
  a scale of node distance (ndFF) that ranges from 0 (the oldest enzymes; ∼3.8 Gy
  ago) to 0.2 (∼3.0 Gy ago).
