caption: 'A model depicting systemic inhibition of canonical TGF-β signaling in the
  fibrotic liver by pirfenidone, pirfenidone derivatives, and the TGF-β trap AVID200,
  as well as the localized inhibition of latent TGF-β activation in the fibrotic niche
  by Bexotegrast (A,B), and PLN-1474 (A). Systemic and localized inhibition of canonical
  TGF-β signaling both attenuate the synthesis of profibrotic genes, such as COL1A1,
  COL3A1, and ACTA2. This affects HSC activation and transdifferentiation, as well
  as ECM remodeling, tissue stiffness, and invasive properties of myofibroblasts.
  Bexotegrast acts as a dual αVβ6 (present on activated HSCs) and αVβ1 (present on
  injured cholangiocytes) integrin inhibitor that attenuates integrin-dependent activation
  of latent TGF-β. PLN-1474 is a specific αVβ1 integrin inhibitor that also prevents
  latent TGF-β activation. Pirfenidone globally blocks the synthesis and activation
  of TGF-β. Only the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway is depicted. Abbreviations:
  ACTA2, smooth muscle actin (SMA); COL1A1, collagen type I alpha 1; COL3A1, collagen
  type III alpha 1; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; ECM, extracellular matrix;

  receptor type I; TGF-βRII: transforming growth factor beta receptor type II. The
  inhibitory compounds that can influence some stages of TGF-β activation and signaling
