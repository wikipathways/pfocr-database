caption: The schematic diagram on how P311 enhances the wound healing capabilities
  of MSCs via the up-regulation VEGF expression mediated by mTOR signalling pathway.
  (A) P311-mediated anti-inflammatory effects attenuate the inflammatory status of
  wound tissues for wound healing. (B) Neo-vascularization of new blood vessels by
  the release of VEGF from MSCs with increased P311 levels that enhances their pro-angiogenesis
  function to accelerate skin wound healing. (C) Increased collagen deposition and
  elevated production of hydroxyproline by MSCs with increased P311 levels. (D) Increased
  P311 levels in MSC activates the mTOR signalling pathway, which in turn up-regulate
  the expression of VEGF, leading to their release from the MSCs to aid in enhanced
  wound healing process by MSCs. Collective functions of these processes mediated
  by P311 enhanced MSCs contributes to the overall quality of wound healing. Created
