caption: 'Translocations affecting the NF-κB activation pathway. (a) Signaling from
  the TLR, IL-1R, and antigen receptor activates the canonical NF-κB pathway, which
  is characterized by activation of the IKK complex, phosphorylation, and degradation
  of IκB. TNFAIP3 is a negative regulator. (b) t(1;14)(p22;q32) results in the nuclear
  overexpression of the BCL10 protein. It is believed to form oligomers through its
  CARD domain and so it triggers MALT1 oligomerization and aberrant NF-κB activation.
  (c) t(14;18)(q32;q21) causes overexpression of MALT1. It is thought that it oligomerizes
  through interaction with BCL10 causing NF-κB activation. (d) t(11;18)(q21;q21),
  the BIR domain of the BIRC2-MALT1, mediates self-oligomerization leading to an activation
  of NF-κB. TLR: Toll-like receptor; IL-1R: interleukin-1 receptor; BCR: B cell receptor;
  TCR: T cell receptor; RIP1: receptor interacting protein 1; TRAF: TNF-associated
  factor; TAK1: transforming growth factor beta activated kinase 1; TAB: TAK binding
  protein; IKK: inhibitor of NF-κB kinase; IκB: inhibitor of NF-κB.'
