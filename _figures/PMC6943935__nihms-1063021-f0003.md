caption: A) Integration of IL-17 signaling with EGFR. In Lrig1+ stem cells in the
  skin, IL-17 stimulation leads to the recruitment of EGFR to the IL-17 receptor complex
  by TRAF4. The close proximity of IL-17R and EGFR allows the adaptor protein Act1
  to recruit c-Src for IL-17A–induced EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent activation
  of MEKK3-MEK5-ERK5 axis. Activation of this axis instigates the Lrig1+ cells to
  produce progenies for wound healing and tumorigenesis. B) IL-17 cross-talk with
  FGF signaling. In colonic epithelial cells, the IL-17 receptor adaptor Act1 constitutively
  binds to GRB2, suppressing FGF2-induced ERK1/2 activation. Upon IL-17 stimulation,
  Act1 is recruited to the IL-17 receptor, releasing GRB2 to associate with guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor SOS1 for RAS-RAF dependent ERK1/2 activation. The cooperativity
  between IL-17 and FGF2 plays a crucial role in the repair of damaged colonic epithelium
  during intestinal inflammation. C) Integration of IL-17A signaling with NOTCH1.
  In oligodendrocytes progenitor cells (OPCs), IL-17 stimulation induces the interaction
  between the extracellular domains of IL-17 receptor and Jagged1-bound NOTCH1, facilitating
  the cleavage of NOTHC1 intracellular domain (NICD1). The released NICD1 forms a
  complex with Act1 and translocates into the nucleus, promoting the assembly of RBP-J-
  and MAML-containing transcriptional machinery that mediates the expression of IL-17-induced
  NOTCH1 target genes for inflammation and cell proliferation. D) Integration of IL-17
  signaling with C-type lectin receptor components. In keratinocytes, multiple signaling
  proteins that functions in C-type lectin receptor pathway have been implicated in
  IL-17 signaling. Both Syk and CARD14 can form complexes with Act1 and TRAF6 in response
  to IL-17 stimulation for NFκB activation.
