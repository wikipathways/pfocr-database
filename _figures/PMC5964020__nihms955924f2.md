caption: 'Cortisol and catecholamine metabolism. (A) Steroidogenesis takes place in
  mitochondria. The first step involves the rate-limiting import of cholesterol into
  mitochondria by the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, followed by the
  side chain cleavage to pregnenolone by P450SCC, three enzymatic reactions in the
  endoplasmic reticulum, and the final 11-β-hydroxylase reaction catalyzing cortisol
  synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria are particularly enriched in
  the adrenal cortex where glucocorticoids are synthesized in response to ACTH. Also
  shown is the catecholamine pathway which mostly occurs in other cell types, including
  tyrosine hydroxylase, which may become associate with mitochondrial membranes under
  some conditions (see text for discussion), and the mitochondria-anchored monoamine
  oxidases A and B, which degrade catecholamines in specific tissues. Degradation
  products are not shown. (B) Electron micrograph of the zona fasciculata of the hamster
