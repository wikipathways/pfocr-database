caption: A vicious cycle of translation dysregulation. Expression of ALS-linked mutant
  FUS (mFUS) leads to the accumulation of prematurely terminated proteins through
  a mechanism that has not been fully elucidated but that may involve the sequestration
  of translation eIFs within cytoplasmic FUS inclusions. Premature translation termination
  is thought to activate the NMD pathway. Aberrant binding and sequestration of NMD-associated
  factors by mutant FUS is thought to further exacerbate NMD activation and interfere
  with autoregulatory features of this pathway. The blue line represents an mRNA transcript
  that is being translated into protein (linked hexagons). The mRNA has a 5’ cap (denoted
  by black star) and poly-A tail. AAA, poly-A tail; P, phosphorylation; Ub, ubiquitination.
