caption: (a) Vertebrate mucin-type O-glycan synthesis originates from the hydroxyl
  group of a serine or threonine (S/T) amino acid by the addition of GalNAc by GalNAcT2
  to form the Tn antigen structure. C1GalT1 adds β1,3-linked Gal to the initial GalNAcα-S/T
  to generate the T antigen. The Tn and T antigens can be further elaborated with
  GlcNAc and NeuNAc in a variety of ways, with a few illustrative examples shown here.
  (b) Representative schematic of engineered pathway for orthogonal O-glycoprotein
  synthesis in E. coli. CjGne maintains a pool of UDP-GalNAc that serves as the activated
  nucleotide sugar donor for AbPglC, which catalyzes the formation of Und-PP-linked
  GalNAc. EcWbwC extends Und-PP-GalNAc by a single Gal residue, yielding lipid-linked
  Gal-β1,3-GalNAc. Following flipping of the LLO to the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic
  membrane by the native E. coli flippase Wzx, the preassembled T antigen glycan is
  transferred en bloc to a serine amino acid on a Sec pathway-exported acceptor protein
  by an O-OST such as NgPglO or NmPglL. It should be noted that the absence of EcWbwC
  enables generation of Tn-modified acceptor proteins while the further elaboration
  of Gal-β1,3-GalNAc with additional sugars such as NeuNAc followed by transfer to
  protein is also possible.
