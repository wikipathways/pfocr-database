caption: Part I) the FA proteins (FANCA, B, C, E, F, G, L, M, T and possibly I) along
  with FAAPs (FAAP 20/24/100 and MHF1/2) and other known proteins, assure the activity
  of ubiquitin E3 ligase for the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI. Part II)
  FANCD2 and its paralog FANCI, as a central axis to connect or orchestrate the entire
  FA signaling pathway. Part III) downstream of Part-II, the remaining FA proteins.
  Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 and FANCI can be deubiquitinated by USP1, thereby inactivating
  the pathway. Red arrows indicate the canonical FA pathway. Ub indicates ubiquitination.
  Part I & III may include many others proteins, which have yet to be recognized.
  As such, the indefinite nature of FA signaling presents a particular challenge to
  translational studies utilizing the basic knowledge of FA to promote clinical understanding
  such as tumor resistance.
