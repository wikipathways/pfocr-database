caption: Putative site of action of PKCɛ in the amplification pathway of GSIS. Pyruvate,
  derived from glycolysis, undergoes two metabolic fates in mitochondria that together
  regulate GSIS. In the initiation pathway, it is subjected to oxidative phosphorylation
  to generate ATP, which leads to closure of ATP-dependent K+ channels, depolarization,
  and the gating of Ca2+ influx. In the amplification pathway, pyruvate augments Krebs
  cycle intermediates (anaplerosis), some of which can be exported to the cytosol
  to generate malonyl-CoA. This results in an inhibition of the β-oxidation of LCACs
  derived from exogenous fatty acids or mobilization of endogenous lipid stores. This
  favors the formation of esterification products di- or triacylglycerol (DAG or TG,
  respectively). PKCɛ, potentially activated by LCACs or DAG, appears to promote oxidation
  of lipid fuels at the expense of esterification pathways that are implicated in
  the amplification pathway. Whether PKCɛ acts directly at this site, or upstream
  at a step in anaplerosis, remains to be determined. For further explanation, see
  the text and Ref. .
