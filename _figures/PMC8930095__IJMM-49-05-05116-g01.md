caption: Talin-1 interaction network in cellular mechanotransduction. (A) Kindlin
  is recruited to the plasma membrane via its interaction with membrane PIP2, reveals
  its autoinhibited conformation, binding to the integrin tail and promoting more
  stable active integrin conformation and enhanced ligand binding. The tail of the
  Kindlin recruits FAK via paxillin binding to its tail domain. Completely unfolded
  Talin-1 tail begins to interact with its various binding partners, R3 binds to the
  RIAM, and R8 interacts with DLC1, subsequently regulating the RhoA and paxillin
  activity. DLC1 and paxillin form a competitive interaction network, since both bind
  to the R8 domain. Talin-1 R13 binds to the actin. (B) With the exertion of medium
  intensity force, Talin-1 R3 unfolds, causing the dissociation of RIAM and exposure
  of the cryptic VBS, culminating in vinculin binding to unfolded R3, and actin binding
  to the vinculin tail. Increased protein levels of cytoskeleton-associated vinculin
  result in an increase in nuclear-localized YAP/TAZ levels. (C) In the presence of
  higher intensity force, unfolding of Talin-1 R8 causes the dissociation of DLC1
  and promotes RhoA activity, consequently affecting the MLC-2 signaling pathway and
  YAP nuclear translocation. R3 domain unfolds completely at high intensity force
  and becomes a polypeptide chain that cannot bind vinculin. PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate;
  FAK, focal-adhesion kinase; RIAM, rap1-GTP interacting protein; DLC-1, deleted in
  liver cancer 1; RhoA, ras homolog family member A; VBS, vinculin binding site; YAP,
  yes-associated protein; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif;
  MLC-2, myosin light chain-2.
