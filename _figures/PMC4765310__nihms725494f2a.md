caption: Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (e.g. LPS, Flagellin, bacterial peptidoglycan)
  bind to their specific TLR and mediate downstream effects, signaling through MyD88
  and subsequently inducing proinflammatory cytokines. TLR3 and sometime TLR4 can
  also signal through TRIF upon binding to their ligand within the endosome, inducing
  proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons to protect further cells from infection.
  In addition TLR7, 8 and 9 can also bind their ligand in the endosome and induce
  type I interferons. To help regulate these signaling pathways, molecules such as
  IRAK-M are present to inhibit MyD88 signaling and prevent or down-regulate the level
  of inflammation.NLR signaling is believed to induce an additive response to the
  TLR signaling pathway. Similarly to the TLR signaling pathway, bacterial pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns can enter the cell and activate the cytosolic NLR signaling molecules
  such as NOD1/2, NLRP3 and NLRC4 (IPAF). These NLR molecules require the formation
  of inflammasomes (multi-subunit proteins interacting) in order to mediate their
  effects. While these pathways promote proinflammatory cytokines mediated through
  NF-KB, they also induce the activation of caspase 1, which in turn cleaves pro-IL1beta
  and pro-IL18 into their activated forms.
