caption: Cisplatin suppresses tumor growth but also induces cellular stress. At the
  peripheral nerve-epidermis interface in the mouse footpad, cisplatin-induced RhoA
  activation increases NF-κB hyper-activation, which led to peripheral neuropathy.
  Functional inhibition of RhoA signaling pathway by Y-27632 can promote cancer cell
  apoptosis, decrease NF-κB-induced chemoresistance, and prevent the loss of ENFs
  in the mouse footpad.
