caption: Hypothetical model for understanding the molecular mechanism of SmsHSP24.1-mediated
  plant abiotic stress response. Overexpression of SmsHSP24.1 might interact with
  mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) which leads to increased ROS. A set
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes of the glutathione (GHS) pathway
  also upregulated and maintains ROS below lethal dose which might act as a transcriptional
  activation signal of several stress-induced transcription factors and ultimately
  lead to change in global transcription.
