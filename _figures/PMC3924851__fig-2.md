caption: 'Activation of JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways by type I interferons
  (IFNs). Type I IFNs bind to type I IFN receptor, which comprises 2 subunits on the
  cell surface, interferon receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) and 2 (IFNAR2). Two kinases
  associate with the IFN receptor: Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2).
  The binding of type I IFN to its receptor leads to the activation of JAK1 and TYK2,
  which subsequently mediate phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2, which in turn is necessary for the formation
  of a complex with IRF9 (ISGF3). This complex translocates to the nucleus, where
  it binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), resulting in the transcription
  of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Additionally, IFN activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway. Activation of this pathway is dependent on JAK1/TYK2, which phosphorylate
  insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and 2 (IRS2). Phosphorylation of IRS1 and IRS2
  leads to the activation of PI3K, which subsequently activates mammalian target of
  rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). MTORC1 activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KB,
  also known as p70S6 kinase), which then phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6),
  leading to initiation of mRNA translation. Additionally, mTORC1 also regulates phosphorylation
  of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (EIF4EBP1, also
  known as translation repressor 4EBP1). Phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 causes inactivation
  of EIF4EBP1, which then dissociates from eukaryotic translation–initiation factor
  E (EIF4E), leading to initiation of cap-dependent mRNA translation. Type I IFN also
  activates rapamycin-insensitive complex (mTORC2), which is required for phosphorylation
  of RPS6KB, RPS6, and EIF4BP1. Although upstream signals leading to the activation
  of mTORC2 complex by type I IFN remain unclear, mTORC2 can activate AKT (Ser437),
  which plays a role in cell survival and has multiple targets, for example, forkhead
  box transcription factors (FOXO3). Interestingly, FOXO3 is considered a regulator
  of the transcription of some IFN-stimulated and autophagy genes. Inhibition of mTORC1
  leads to the induction of autophagy. Ubiquitin-like conjugation systems composed
  of a variety of autophagy-related proteins (Atg) are involved in the process of
  vesicle expansion and completion. Bafilomycin A1 blocks fusion between autophagosomes
  and lysosomes.'
