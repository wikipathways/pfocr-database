caption: 'This figure shows a schematic diagram of the molecular mechanism of neutrophil
  suicidal NETosis. Black upward arrow indicates the expression of this substance
  is upregulated; indigo arrow indicates the substance binds to the corresponding
  receptor or reaches the corresponding location through inteacellular/extracellular
  movement; black arrow indicates the former promotes the upregulation of expression
  or cell behavior of the latter; red star symbol next to the text indicates that
  this influencing factor is difficult to display with symbols. The process is principally
  divided into four stages: i. Stimuli from PMA activate the downstream second messenger
  protein PKC through the Raf-MEK-ERK signalling pathway, which in turn triggers mitochondrial
  NADPH oxidase to produce a large amount of ROS. Simultaneously, calcium ion influx
  promotes the release of azurophilic granules. ii. CDK4/6 phosphorylates and destroys
  nuclear envelope proteins, while NE is activated by MPO, which in turn promotes
  an increase in GSDMD expression, thereby destroying the nuclear and plasma membrane
  structure. iii. Histone citrullination caused by the PAD4 pathway, NE cleavage of
  histone H1/H4, and increased entropic pressure, leading to chromatin depolymerisation
  and expansion; iv. Subsequent to the plasma membrane rupturing due to various pathways
  such as GSDMD and NE, NETs are released in large quantities; their main components
  are histones, MPO, NE, and DNA networks. Abbreviations: PMA (12-myristoyl-13-acetoxy-phorbol),
  FcγRII (Fcγ receptor II), Raf-MEK-ERK (Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase pathway), PKC (protein kinase C), ROS (reactive oxygen species),
  MPO (myeloperoxidase), NE (neutrophil elastase), CDK4/6 (cyclin-dependent kinase
  4/6), F-actin (fibrillar actin), PAD4 (peptidylarginine deiminase 4), GSDMD (gasdermin
  D), NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps)'
