caption: Schematic representation of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. Under basal condition,
  the DLG and ETGE motifs of Nrf2 interact with the BTB domain contained within Keap1,
  which brings Nrf2 to the Cul3-based ubiquitin E3 ligase and targets the 26S proteasome
  for degradation in cytoplasm. Under stressed condition, the modified cysteine residues
  disturb the binding between Keap1 and Cul3, which protect Nrf2 from proteasomal
  degradation. The accumulated Nrf2 subsequently translocates into the nucleus, dimerizes
  with sMaf, and binds to the ARE which is located in the promoter of the target cytoprotective
  genes, ultimately driving their robust expression.
