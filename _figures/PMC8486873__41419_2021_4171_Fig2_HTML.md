caption: In response to ER stress, ER stress transducers (IRE1 and PERK) facilitated
  the MVBs formation and boosted the EVs-mediated release of HMGB1, HPSs, ceramide,
  and miRNA. And HMGB1 has been reported to suppressed anti-tumor immune response
  by promoting the N2 polarization of neutrophils via activating the NF-κB pathway.
  Moreover, HMGB1 has an inhibitory effect on CD8+ T cells by stimulating the expansion
  of the TIM-1+Breg cells and increasing the expression of IL-10 through the MAPK
  and TLR 2/4 pathways. Exosomal HSP90, HSP70, and HSP60 have been indicated to promote
  the chemotherapy resistance of cancer cells. Nevertheless, Hsp72 activates the effect
  of NK cells, simultaneously promoting the release of inflammatory factors in APCs
  to stimulate the anti-cancer response. C24:1 and C18:0 ceramides promote chemoresistance
  in multiple cancer while alpha-galactosylceramide enhances T-cell-mediated anti-cancer
  response through the activated effect of dendritic cells. miR-23a-3p decreases the
  production of IL-2 and recedes the function of CD8+ T cells by inhibiting PTEN and
  then increasing the AKT-mediated PD-L1 expression in macrophages.
