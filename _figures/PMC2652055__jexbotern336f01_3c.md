caption: 'Simplified overview of flavonol and anthocyanin biosynthesis within the
  phenylpropanoid pathway and its regulation in grape by characterized MYB genes (flavan-3-ols
  are not shown in this pathway). The repressor MYB4 is shown in red, while all MYB
  activators are shown in green. Abbreviations: CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone
  isomerase; F3H/F3′H/F3′5′H, flavonoid hydroxylases; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase;
  ANS/LDOX, anthocyanidin synthase/leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; UFGT, UDP glucose:flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; and OMT, O-methyltransferase. (This figure is available
  in colour at JXB online.)'
