caption: ASHD treatment can induce apoptosis through one of the following pathways.
  First, the DNA damages induced by ASHD could lead to the activation of p53, which
  can block the expression of BCL2. Downregulation of BCL2 probably leads to loss
  of mitochondrial membrane permeability and further to the activation of the initiator
  caspase 9. This results in the activation of the apoptotic protein cascade wherein
  caspase 3 gets cleaved and activated which can further either induce PARP cleavage
  or cleave the inhibitor of the caspase-activated DNase which finally results in
  fragmentation and degradation of the cellular DNA. In addition, ASHD activates p38
  MAPK pathway, upregulation of proapoptotic proteins and BAD, which can directly
  result in apoptosis.
