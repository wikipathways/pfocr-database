caption: Schematic overview of the molecular mechanisms triggered by the interplay
  between SARS-CoV-2 S protein, ACE2, and integrin β1 receptors. Binding of the SARS-CoV-2
  S protein to ACE2 or integrin β1 receptors can disrupt the balance of the renin–angiotensin
  system (RAS) and activate the Ang II/AT1R axis. Activation of AT1R and viral infection
  itself can initiate several intracellular signaling pathways, including Ca2+ influx,
  activation of TMEM16F scramblase, and externalization of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer)
  to the outer cell membrane, ultimately leading to ADAM17 activation. The sheddase
  activity of ADAM17, in combination with AT1R-induced RAGE activation, may significantly
  contribute to the inflammatory process by activating inflammatory factors such as
  Notch and NF-kB proteins, which, in turn, promote the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines like TNF-α, IL-6, R-IL6, and IL-1β. Created in BioRender. de Melo, M.P.
