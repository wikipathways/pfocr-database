caption: Direct and indirect RAS inhibitors. RAS proteins are synthesized in the cytosol,
  and different covalent inhibitors of KRASG12C are currently in clinical trials (1).
  RAS functioning requires membrane anchorage, which can be achieved through farnesylation
  by farnesyltransferase (FTase) or geranylation by geranylgeranylprenyltransferase
  (GGTase). By inhibiting FTase or GGTase, RAS membrane anchoring is prevented and
  RAS function blocked (2). Inhibition of PTPN11 (3) or SOS1/2 (4) prevents RAS activation
  through upstream signaling.
