caption: Schematic representation of major pathways producing and consuming acetyl-CoA
  in M. extorquens AM1 during growth on different substrates. (A) Methanol. The main
  source of acetyl-CoA is the malyl-CoA lyase reaction (, ). The main fate of acetyl-CoA
  is its conversion to β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, which is partitioned roughly equally
  between PHB synthesis and the glyoxylate regeneration pathway (, ). Very little
  acetyl-CoA is oxidized via the TCA cycle during methylotrophic growth. (B) Succinate.
  The main source of acetyl-CoA is the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. The main fate
  of acetyl-CoA is oxidation through the TCA cycle, with a lesser flux into PHB. (C)
  Ethylamine. Acetyl-CoA is made directly from the C2 substrate, and acetyl-CoA is
  partitioned between the TCA cycle and β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. A significant flux occurs
  into both PHB and the glyoxylate regeneration cycle, which generates the C4 acceptors
  for acetyl-CoA oxidation via the TCA cycle (, , ).
