caption: A) Transcriptional activity of PGC-1α is tightly linked to its acetylation
  status. GCN5 and PCAF were shown to acetylate PGC-1α, which decreases its activity.
  TIP60, p300 and SRC-1/3 are other acetyltransferases known to interact with PGC-1α,
  without any evidence that they influence the acetylation of PGC-1α. B) In the fed
  state, insulin signaling inactivates PGC-1α through the AKT pathway. In the fasted
  state, glucagon signaling induces PGC-1α via the CREB pathway. Activation of PGC-1α
  results in upregulation of its target genes which are involved in mitochondrial
  biogenesis, gluconeogenesis in the liver, and glucose uptake in other tissues.
