caption: Network displaying key genes involved in apoptosis, DSB repair, Fanconi anemia
  pathway and homologous recombination. Each node is clickable and linked to a pathway
  in ZFIN (write to the corresponding author for a hyperlinked version of the figure).
  Gray lines indicate which pathway a certain gene belongs to. Blue lines indicate
  pathway associations between genes. Multiple blue lines indicate data from multiple
  sources. Network was constructed using GeneMANIA.
