caption: Ras/Rac1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway seems to be regulated by and regulates
  superoxide anion production during melan-a anchorage blockade and its activation
  could be responsible for the high Dnmt1 protein level and changes in global DNA
  methylation during the loss of cell adhesion. Anchorage blockade might promote an
  epigenetic reprogramming in order to adapt the cells to the new microenvironmental
  condition and contribute to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype.
