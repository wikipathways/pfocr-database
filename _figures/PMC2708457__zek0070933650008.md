caption: Modeling the interaction between translating ribosomes and Gcn2, Gcn1, Rbg1,
  and Gir2. (A) Gcn1 interacts with Gcn2 on the ribosome for detecting uncharged tRNAs
  under amino acid starvation. This leads to the stimulation of the Gcn2 kinase domain,
  subsequent phosphorylation of its substrate eIF-2α, and finally to the activation
  of the general amino acid control (see references  and ). (B) On the ribosome, Gir2
  binds simultaneously Rbg1 via its C-terminal domain, and Gcn1 binds via its N-terminal
  domain. In a manner analogous to the general amino control pathway described in
  panel A, the Rbg1 pathway may receive a signal from Gcn1 that is relayed through
  Gir2. It is possible that this signal alters the guanine nucleotide bound state
  of Rbg1 to elicit an as-yet-undefined biological response.
