caption: Activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The accumulation of misfolded
  proteins in the ER leads to the dissociation of BiP from the three ER-stress sensor
  PERK, IRE-1 and ATF6 and activates the coordinated unfolded protein response. ATF6
  is translocated to the Golgi where it undergoes sequential cleavage and migrates
  to the nucleus. IRE-1 and PERK are activated by oligomerization and trans-phosphorylation.
  The IRE-1 endoribonuclease activity splices out an intron on XBP1 mRNA to generate
  XBP1s. IRE-1 also triggers the JNK pathway. PERK phosphorylates eIF2α (not shown)
  and enhance the translation of ATF4 which upregulates CHOP. The integrated signaling
  of this three sensor regulates mRNAs decay, attenuates translation, increases chaperon
  sintesis, upregulates the antioxidante response, and promotes ERAD and reticulophagy.
  Sustained hyperactivation leads to apoptosis.
