caption: 'AKEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the virus–host PPI network was conducted,
  and RNA transport‐related proteins were highly enriched. The color of a node corresponds
  to the frequency of occurrence of the prey that has been detected in the virus–host
  interactome.BIn total, 693 proteins were connected by both viral baits and host–receptor
  baits in the combined interactome. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of these 693
  proteins was conducted, and three pathways, namely, RNA transportation, endocytosis,
  and protein processing in the ER, were highlighted.C, DEnriched proteins were illustrated
  by the schematic diagram relevant to endocytosis (P‐value: 5.84 × 10−15) (C) and
  protein processing in ER (P‐value: 1.80 × 10−22) (D). The color of each slice in
  a node corresponds to the frequency of occurrence of the prey that was detected
  in virus–host interactome (left half slice) and host–receptor interactome (right
  half slice).'
