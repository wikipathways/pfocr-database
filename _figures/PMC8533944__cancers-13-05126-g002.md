caption: Opposite effects of SFK-mediated phosphorylation on KRAS and YAP function.
  SFK-mediated KRAS phosphorylation on Tyr32 and Tyr64 inhibits KRAS signaling by
  decreasing affinity for the RBD of effectors (e.g., RAF). Concomitantly, SFK activates
  YAP via Hippo-dependent pathway by repression of LATS1/2 and/or Hippo-independent
  direct tyrosine phosphorylation, including phosphorylation of YAP at Tyr357. SFK-mediated
  YAP activation leads to nuclear import and complex formation with the transcription
  factors of the TEAD family, leading to increase expression of many genes that regulate
  cell survival, proliferation, EMT, mitosis, adaptation to hypoxia and release of
  factors that induce autocrine/paracrine stimulation of EGFR, including amphyregulin
  (AREG). The tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 opposes SFK-mediated phosphorylation, thereby
  reactivating KRAS but inactivating YAP. RAS dimers lead to RAF/MEK/ERK activation.
  In turn, ERK phosphorylates multiple substrates, leading to increased expression
  of c-FOS, stabilization of c-MYC and activation of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinases
  (RSK). MYC inhibits the transcription factor PTF-1A, which controls the expansion
  of pancreatic progenitor cells and the acinar cell lineage. ERK and RSK lead to
  mTORC1 activation (omitted in the scheme for clarity). ERK also phosphorylates and
  inhibits upstream elements of the pathway (e.g., RAF and SOS), thus mediating feedback
  regulation that fine-tunes the activity of the pathway. Blue lines represent stimulation.
  Red lines represent inhibition. Please also see the main text for additional details.
