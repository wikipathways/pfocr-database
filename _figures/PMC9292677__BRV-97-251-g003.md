caption: Sphingosine 1‐phosphate (S1P) signalling in bone morphogenesis. (A) Bone
  morphogenesis involves a highly dynamic regulation of bone resorption and formation
  by osteoclasts (OCs) and osteoblasts (OBs). Extracellular S1P secreted from osteoclast
  precursor cells promotes circulation of OCs between blood and bone through S1P receptor
  1 (S1PR1)‐directed OCs migrating away from bone and S1PR2‐mediated OCs migrating
  towards bone. (B) Osteoclastogenesis is inhibited by both extracellular S1P signalling
  [through S1PR2/wingless‐related integration site (Wnt)/lipoprotein receptor‐related
  protein 5 (Lrp5) and S1PR2/glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)/β‐catenin‐induced
  osteoprotegrin upregulation] and intracellular S1P signalling [through negative
  regulation of the p38/FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (c‐Fos)/nuclear factor of activated
  T cells 1 (NFATc1) pathway]. Extracellular S1P secreted from OCs [negatively regulated
  by calcitonin (CT) and calcitonin receptor (CTR)] promotes the migration and survival
  of OBs by cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)‐induced receptor activator
  of NF‐κB ligand (RANKL) upregulation through modulating activities of p38 and extracellular
  signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) in OBs. RANKL secreted from OBs binds with RANK in
  OCs and activates SPHK1, which, together with S1P lyase (S1PL), in turn regulates
  S1P metabolism. In addition, S1PR1‐ and S1PR2‐mediated S1P signalling stimulates
  osteoblastogenesis by regulating osterix/peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor
  γ (PPARγ) and cathepsin K, respectively. MEK, mitogen‐activated protein kinase kinase;
