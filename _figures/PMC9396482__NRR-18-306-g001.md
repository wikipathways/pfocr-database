caption: 'Schematic representation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the CNS (A) and
  multiple strategies of targeting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cellular and pharmacological
  therapies for PD (B).(A) In intact midbrain, Wnt/β-cat signaling functions as a
  microenvironmental sensor that balances cell survival and death. Wnt ligands (Wnt1,
  Wnt2, Wnt3, Wnt3a, Wnt8, and Wnt8a), upon the binding to the Fzd receptor and the
  LRP5/6 co-receptors, activate the pathway (Wnt-ON) by blocking the GSK-3β-induced
  phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin at the proteasome. Stabilized β-catenin
  accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus where, by acting
  as a co-activator for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription, it triggers the expression
  of target genes involved in neuroprotection, neuron survival and plasticity, and
  neural differentiation. Conversely, negative regulators of Wnt signaling, such as
  SFRPs or DKK, oxidative stress, inflammation, neurotoxic agents, growth factor deprivation,
  or aging antagonize the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in neurons. In this state of Wnt-OFF,
  the β-catenin excess is rapidly phosphorylated by GSK-3β at the APC/axin/GSK-3β
  destruction complex, and then subjected to ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. As
  a consequence, the transcription of Wnt target genes involved in neuron survival
  is inhibited. The main pharmacological approaches targeting the signaling for achieving
  beneficial effect in PD are highlighted in dotted rectangles. (B) In cell-based
  therapies, Wnt/β-catenin signaling activators can improve in vitro the differentiation
  of pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs towards dopaminergic neurons before cell transplantation,
  or regulate the maturation and functions of transplanted dopaminergic progenitors/neurons.
  Activation of the signaling in stem cells and glial cells by drugs modulating the
  signaling might increase the content of neurite growth-promoting factors in the
  released secretome both in vitro, useful for exogenous secretome administration,
  and in vivo. In the pharmacological approaches, molecules able of selectively modulating
  different events of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling can be neuroprotective, by acting
  on both neurons and glial cells, and promoting dopaminergic differentiation of endogenous
  neural stem cells, thus improving neuro-restoration in PD. APC: Adenomatous polyposis
