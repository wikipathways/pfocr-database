caption: S. enterica Kentucky growth in M9 medium containing cecal contents as a carbon
  and energy source affects TCA/glyoxylate pathways (A) and anaerobic respiration
  (B). Salmonella genes expressed in response to growth in M9 medium with cecal contents
  versus glucose were mapped to metabolic pathways and individual steps within each
  pathway. Each solid arrow represents a gene, and presumably also an enzyme, that
  is expressed for that step when cells are grown in M9 medium with cecal contents.
  The arrows created with dashed lines represent pathway steps where gene expression
  was not detected. Transporters (arrows drawn across parallel lines) and peripheral
  pathways that feed into the TCA cycle (A) are also presented. Asterisks indicate
  several dehydrogenases and likely substrates identified that complement reductases
  expressed when Salmonella is grown in the presence of cecal contents (B).
