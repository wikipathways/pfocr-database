caption: Ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of IκBs. The E3 protein-ubiquitin
  ligase SCFβ-TrCP complex consists of β-TrCP, an F-box protein with a WD repeat region
  that serves as the docking subunit for the SCFβ-TrCP complex, the adaptor proteins
  Skp1 and Cul1, and the RING protein Roc1 that recruits the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme UbcH5. The precursor proteins p100 and p105 are partially degraded to yield
  functional p52 and p50, respectively. p105 contains a glucine-rich region (GRR),
  which separates the functional from inhibitory portions of the protein and is essential
  for its processing. After being marked for ubiquitination by the SCFβ-TrCP complex,
  the proteasome degrades p105 and p100 until it hits the GRR region signaling the
  completion of processing and the functional subunit is released, or the proteasome
  is unable to properly unfold the GRR region, forcing it to complete processing prematurely
  and release p50/p65. Additionally, the SCFβ-TrCP complex processes IκB after IKKβ
  phosphorylates IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε. β-TrCP recognizes the degradation signal and
  UbcH5 and the SCFβ-TrCP complex polyubiquitinate lysine residues on IκBα, which
  marks it for degradation by the 26S proteasome
