caption: 'Signaling by TGF-β family members through the Smad-dependent and Smad-independent
  pathways: TGF-β induces its response by multimerization of TGF-β receptor II (TβRII)
  and TGF-β receptor I (TβRI). Both the receptors have the same overall domain structure—an
  extracellular cysteine rich domain (ED), a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular
  serine-threonine kinase domain (KD). TGβRII activates TβR1 by transphosphorylation
  of its glycine- and serine-rich (GS) domains. The Smad-dependent signaling is initiated
  by the binding of the Mad homology (MH) 2 domain of R-Smad to an adaptor protein
  (SARA). Eventually R-Smad dissociates from TβRI and oligomerizes with Smad 4 to
  form a heterodimeric complex which translocates into the nucleus thereby regulating
  the cellular response. The Smad-independent signaling is initiated by activation
  of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways—the p38 MAPK, c-Jun amino
  terminal kinase (JNK) and p44/42 or the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2.
  The MAPK pathways may or may not be regulated by the binding of MAPK kinase kinase
  (MAPKKK), TGF-β-associated kinase (TAK) 1 with TAK1-binding protein (TAB) 1 leading
  to the activation of transcription factors—ATF, cJun and STAT proteins. Depending
  upon the type of TGF-β signaling pathway initiated, the cell is directed to undergo
  either proliferation or differentiation or apoptosis'
