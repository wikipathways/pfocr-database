caption: (A) Functional involvement of USP13, miR-10b, miR-9, and LIFR in different
  stages of breast cancer progression. (B) Therapeutic silencing of miR-10b as an
  antimetastatic strategy. (C) Antimetastatic therapeutic strategies that target the
  miR-9–LIFR-Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. miR-9 antagomirs and LIFR ligands (such
  as LIF) could be used for tumors with down-regulation but not complete loss of LIFR,
  whereas agents targeting the functional YAP targets (such as CTGF) may be useful
  for LIFR-negative tumors. LIF (rhuLIF, AM424, emfilermin) is a therapeutic agent
  tested in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials to treat neuropathy. A CTGF-neutralizing
  antibody (FG-3019) has been tested in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials to treat
  fibrosis and metastatic pancreatic cancer. (D) DUBs or their downstream signaling
  components as druggable targets.
