caption: Overview of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway. The HH ligand binds to
  a transmembrane receptor complex formed by the proteins PTCH and Smoothened (SMO).
  When not bound by the HH ligand, PTCH acts as a regulatory molecule, inhibiting
  translocation of SMO cilia thereby reducing HH signaling. When HH ligand binds to
  PTCH, the HH-PTCH complex is degraded by lysosomes which de-represses SMO, upregulating
  the pathway’s downstream signaling cascade via several proteins including suppressor
  of fused (SUFU). This ultimately results in release of members of the GLI protein
  family, such as GLI1, which are ordinarily sequestered in the cytoplasm [,]. GLI1
  acts as a transcription factor, which upon release can translocate to the cell nucleus
  and trigger transcription of genes involved in cell renewal, fate, and survival,
  as well as angiogenesis [].
