caption: Role of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in melanoma cells
  and targets of BRAF and MEK inhibitors. In normal cells, external growth stimuli
  trigger receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), activating the MAPK pathway kinase cascade.
  In BRAF-driven melanoma, mutant BRAF (BRAF V600E) can start signaling independently
  of growth factor signal to hyperactivate cellular growth. BRAF mutated melanoma
  responds to BRAF/MEK inhibitors-targeted therapy. However, various intrinsic or
  adaptive resistance mechanisms attenuate response to targeted BRAF inactivation,
  deregulating signaling and rewiring cell metabolism.
