caption: Summary of the cellular proteostasis network. The fate of misfolded proteins
  arising from oxidative stress (ROS)-induced cascades varies depending on the nature
  of the protein and extent of damage. As depicted, adduction by reactive carbonyl
  species (RCS) such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) can elicit protein misfolding and
  necessitate the engagement of a panoply of cellular defense mechanisms designed
  to prevent propagation of protein damage and/or directly eliminate misfolded proteins.
  Among these mechanisms, the sensing of redox state and subsequent induction of heat
  shock response (HSR) by sirtuins (SIRT) leads to the upregulation of heat shock
  protein (Hsp) expression. The HSPs, or chaperone proteins are capable of directing
  misfolded targets toward pathways of protein refolding or targeted degradation via
  the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (UPS). As a more direct, but less selective route
  of degradation, misfolded proteins can also be recycled via autophagy/lysosomal
  machinery. Alternatively, misfolded proteins can be compartmentalized into insoluble
  protein deposits (IPOD) or sequestered into juxtanuclear quality control compartments
  (JUNQs) via shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus directed by nucleocytoplasmic
  transport machinery. Elements of this figure were made in BioRender.
