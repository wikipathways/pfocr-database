caption: Underlying mechanisms of several potential PC therapeutics via proteomic
  approaches. On the one hand, for compounds with established antitumor activity but
  undefined mechanisms in PC, deep-coverage proteomics enables systematic screening
  of differential protein signatures. This approach facilitates the precise identification
  of molecular targets and associated mechanistic pathways. On the other hand, for
  candidate compounds with therapeutic potential in PC with unknown targets, proteomic
  profiling provides a powerful platform to delineate pharmacodynamic biomarkers and
  elucidate the underlying mode of action. Some potential drugs and their related
  mechanisms of action are currently being explored in the context of PDAC and are
  shown in the figure. “↑” indicates activation, stimulation or promotion, whereas
  “⊥” indicates inhibition, suppression or decrease. The figure was created with BioGDP.com
