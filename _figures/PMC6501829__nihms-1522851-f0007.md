caption: Inhibition of CXCR4 with AMD3100 prevents gp120-induced changes in GABAAR
  signaling. Because gp120IIIB binds to CXCR4 (; ) we propose that the signaling cascade
  starts with this receptor. While multiple cell types including neurons, astrocytes,
  and microglia express CXCR4, LME treatment to remove microglia prevented gp120-induced
  changes in GABAAR signaling in neurons. Thus, gp120 does not act directly on neurons
  to evoke the inhibitory current and microglia are necessary and upstream from the
  neuronal response. Additionally, because IL-1ra blocked the gp120-induced increase
  in tonic inhibition and microglia release IL-1β in response to gp120 (Lisi et al.,
  2011), we placed microglia upstream from the neuron. Finally, p38 signaling in neurons
  is necessary for the gp120-induced increases in tonic inhibition as shown by RapRp38
  expression in neurons. P38 activation is a canonical downstream effector of the
  IL-1R (), consistent with IL1Rs on neurons mediating the response. P38 activation
  in other cell types may contribute to upstream steps in the pathways such as IL-1β
  release from microglia (), although these roles were not tested in this study. Activation
  of p38 increased α5-containing GABAARs on the neuronal cell surface without the
  need for protein synthesis; the final steps through which p38 regulates GABAAR trafficking
  are not known. Selective inhibitors are shown in red.
