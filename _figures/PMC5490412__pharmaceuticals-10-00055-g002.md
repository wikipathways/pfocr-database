caption: Overview of the proposed computational systems biology method. The network
  construction is performed through the selection of input genes (shown with red diamonds)
  involved in the wound healing process. The knowledge about Protein-Protein Interaction
  (PPI) (STRING repository []) is then used to build the network. Next, the topological
  network analysis selects candidate nodes (i.e., cluster hubs and bridge nodes) and
  identifies other key genes in the wound healing process. Finally, the simulation
  of the Rigenera® autologous micro-graft action is performed in the TNF signaling
  pathway from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [] through Boolean
  networks.
