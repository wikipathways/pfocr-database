caption: Promotion of cancer development and progression by NFAT. In various cancers,
  NFAT can activate downstream targets to cause enhanced cell proliferation, inflammation,
  metastasis, and angiogenesis. However, the NFAT activity is cell-type and context
  dependent and is responsive to the external stimuli such as the activation of receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTKs), integrin, and Wnt pathway. Endogenous inhibitors of calcineurin–NFAT,
  such as DSCR1 and CABIN1 also block activation of NFATs in endothelial cells and
  are potent inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis. NFAT controls angiogenesis via negative
  regulation of VEGF. In normal endothelial cells (ECs), activation of β1 integrin
  leads to NFAT-dependent transcription of VEGFR1. VEGF levels are kept in check and
  normal angiogenesis takes place. This pathway can be inhibited by complex formation
  between β1 integrin, VEGFR2, and tumor endothelial marker-8 (TEM8). In hemangioma
  endothelial cells (HemECs), VEGF signaling is constitutively activated due to enhanced
  complex formation in HemECs versus normal endothelial cells, which then leads to
  decreased VEGFR1 transcription. In the normal cell, VEGFR1 inhibits VEGF expression,
  normalizing vascular growth. TEM8 and VEGFR2 negatively regulate β1 integrin activation
  and in turn suppress NFAT transcriptional activity. VEGF can activate NFAT signaling
  via increased Calcium influx and via activation of RTKs. TF, transcription factors;
