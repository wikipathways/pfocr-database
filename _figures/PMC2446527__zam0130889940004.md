caption: Putative pathway for degradation of DTDP in T. mimigardefordensis. Initially,
  DTDP is cleaved into two molecules of 3MP, which are then oxygenated by a dioxygenase,
  thereby yielding 3SP. After linkage to CoA by a thiokinase, the sulfur moiety is
  putatively removed by a desulfinase, resulting in propionyl-CoA, which is then metabolized
  via the methylcitric acid cycle toward intermediates of the central metabolism.
  Whereas most enzyme reactions are based on experimental data and on general predictions
  of the respective enzymes, the desulfination reaction is hypothetical and is based
  on theoretical considerations and indirect experimental evidence.
