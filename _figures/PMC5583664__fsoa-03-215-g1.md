caption: The DrkA and other histidine sensor kinases respond to the environment signals
  including stress from osmotic, oxidation and heat. The signal is transferred to
  the MAP kinase, SakA. After phosphorylation, SakA translocates into the nucleus
  where it interacts with the downstream effector AtfA or other unidentified transcription
  factors which activate the transcription of stress response genes. In addition to
  nuclear translocation, phosphorylated SakA may activate other molecules in the MAPK
  cascade in response to the stimuli.
