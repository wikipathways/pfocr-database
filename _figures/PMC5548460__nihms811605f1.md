caption: In addition to activating its downstream transcription factors such as signal
  transducer and activator of transcription factors (STATs) the receptor-associated
  Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) can also affect chromatin structure via direct and indirect
  mechanisms. In response to extracellular stimuli, both wild type and JAK2-V617F
  (shown as JAK2VF) can shuttle into the nucleus and phosphorylate histone H3 at Y41.
  This leads to exclusion of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) from chromatin and activation
  of gene transcription at JAK2 target genes such as LMO2. In contrast, oncogenic
  JAK2-V617F, but not wild type JAK2, can phosphorylate the arginine methyltransferase
  PRMT5, resulting in the dissociation of the PRMT5-MEP50 complex, the downregulation
  of PRMT5 methyltransferase activity, and a decrease in symmetric dimethylation of
  histones H2A and H4 at R3. Me, methyl; P, phosphate.
