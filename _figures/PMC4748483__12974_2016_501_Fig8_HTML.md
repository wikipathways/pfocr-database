caption: Schematic of signaling pathways involved in cocaine-mediated induction of
  microglia TLR2 expression and activation. Cocaine induces NAPDH oxidase-mediated
  accumulation of ROS with downstream activation of the ER-stress PERK/eIF2α/ATF4
  pathways which, in turn, leads to ATF4 translocation, with the subsequent induction
  of TLR2. Additionally, cocaine also activates the phosphorylation-dependent signaling
  of the TLR2 pathway leading ultimately to microglial activation
