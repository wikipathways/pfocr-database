caption: This signaling pathway was drawn by the Pathway Builder Tool 2.0. Hypoxia
  can induce the expression of γ-H2AX via cleavage of the DNA double-strand. The induced
  γ-H2AX could promote EGFR to translocate into the cell nucleus from the cell membrane
  through regulate COX2 expression. Nuclear localized EGFR was found to induce HIF-1α
  expression which resulted in VEGF expression and angiogenesis.
