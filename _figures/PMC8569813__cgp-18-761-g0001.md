caption: Bipartite network with the resulting monotonically expressed genes (MEGs)
  and the corresponding candidate repurposed drugs that are predicted to influence
  their expression. Monotonically over- and under-expressed genes are presented as
  circular nodes with red and green color respectively and drugs with grey rhombus-shaped
  nodes.
