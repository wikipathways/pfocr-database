caption: Current understanding of the mechanism of action of T-oligos. T-oligos accumulate
  in the nucleus and forms an intermolecular G-quadruplex structure. It is hypothesized
  that T-oligos then interact in some way with the shelterin complex, causing these
  proteins to dissociate from the telomere. DNA damage responses are then induced
  by either shelterin dissociation (as in the shelterin dissociation model) or mimicry
  of an exposed telomere (as in the telomere mimicry model), activating the ATM pathway
  and resulting in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and possibly reduced expression of
  hTERT through activation of the JNK pathway, which may be mediated by ATM activation.
