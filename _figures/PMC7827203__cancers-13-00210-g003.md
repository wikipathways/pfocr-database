caption: Crosstalk of MDSC and Treg. MDSC and Treg interactions are enhanced by soluble
  mediators, a close metabolic cooperation, and cell–cell interactions. Particularly,
  MDSC-derived IL-10 and TGF-β promote Treg induction, proliferation, and activation.
  The secretion of TGF-β and IL-10 by Treg enhances the generation of these cytokines
  in MDSC, establishing a positive feedback loop. IL-10 and TGF-β promote the expression
  of immunosuppressive receptors (e.g., PD-L1) and enzymes (e.g., Arg-1, iNOS, and
  CD73) on MDSC. Autocrine IL-35 secretion by Treg, which is promoted via the PD-L1-PD-1
  pathway, contributes to enhanced IL-10 secretion. The cooperative generation of
  adenosine (ADO) via the CD39/73 axis and the IDO-mediated accumulation of kynurenines
  (Kynu) further serve as important mechanisms of the bidirectional crosstalk. First,
  ADO prevents the maturation of MDSC via A2B-receptor (A2BR) stimulation. A2A-receptor
  (A2AR) stimulation augments the proliferation and immunosuppressive potential of
  Treg. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated depletion of tryptophan (Trp) and
  the Kynu accumulation in the TME add up to the induction of Treg and the recruitment
  of MDSC to the tumor site. Checkpoint molecules contribute to the crosstalk between
  MDSC and Treg via PD-L1/PD-1, CD80/CTLA-4, MHC-II/LAG-3, V domain-containing immunoglobulin
  suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA)-Ligand/VISTA, Gal-9/TIM-3 (not shown), or
  CD155/TIGIT (not shown) interaction, promoting the suppressive activities of MDSC
  and Treg. Notably, CD80 expression is upregulated after direct MDSC–Treg interaction.
  In addition, CD40–CD40L interaction is involved in MDSC-mediated immunosuppression
  and Treg expansion at the tumor site. Lastly, the interaction of CD11b/CD18 on MDSC
  with intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expressed by Treg might enhance MDSC-derived
  ROS generation. Here, it seems plausible that the engagement of other β2 integrins
  might also be involved in the crosstalk between MDSC and Treg, e.g., lymphocyte
  function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on Treg with ICAM-1 on MDSC. The inflammatory
  and hypoxic TME further enhances MDSC/Treg interaction via mediators, such as IL-1β,
  IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, or VEGF, which enhance the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β
  or promote STAT-3 signaling, contributing to the upregulation of cell surface molecules
  (e.g., PD-L1, CD80, Mac-1) and enzymes (CD39, Nox-2 or Arg-1) involved in the bidirectional
  positive feedback loops.
