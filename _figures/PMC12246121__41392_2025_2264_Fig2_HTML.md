caption: 'Structure of different PRRS in the cell membrane and the extracellular.
  a The structure of TLRs. TLRs featured an ectodomain adorned with LRRs that mediate
  signal recognition, transmembrane regions, and the cytoplasmic TIR domains that
  activate downstream signaling pathways. Upon recognizing PAMPs or DAMPs, TLRs interact
  with MYD88 or TRIF and trigger downstream signaling cascades, ultimately leading
  to the release of inflammatory cytokines, IFN-Is, chemokines, and antimicrobial
  peptides. b The structure of RLRs. RLRs family encompasses three members: LGP2,
  MDA-5, and RIG-I. Structurally, RLRs consist of two N-terminal CARDs, a central
  DDX/ATPase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. In RIG-I, the C-terminus
  comprises the RD and the CTD, while MDA-5 lacks the RD, thus being devoid of self-inhibitory
  capabilities. In contrast to other RLR family members, LGP2 lacks the CARD domain,
  precluding its ability to recruit homologous molecules for signal transduction.
  However, researches showed that LGP2 could regulates RIG-I and MDA-5 signaling.
  c The structure of CLRs. CLRs including CLEC4E (MINCLE), CLEC7A (Dectin-1), Dectin-2,
  CLEC8A, CLEC9A (DNGR1), CLEC12A and MRs. Dectin-1 features an extracellular CTLD
  and an intracellular tail linked to an ITAM, while Dectin-2 lacks the ITAM sequence
  and does not possess signal transduction capabilities. MRs’ extracellular segment
  comprises two parts: the proximal membrane end with eight consecutive CTLDs, responsible
  for ligand endocytosis and transport, and the distal membrane end with a cysteine-rich
  lectin domain that recognizes sulfated carbohydrate conjugates. d The structure
  of Extracellular soluble PRMs. Extracellular soluble PRMs include diverse molecular
  families, primarily pentraxins, collectins, and ficolins. Pentraxins are categorized
  into two families: short and long molecules. These molecules are predominantly synthesized
  in the liver in response to inflammatory signals and interleukins. The long pentraxin
  family, represented by PTX3, uniquely features an extended N-terminal domain. Collectins
  and ficolins are both oligomers composed of basic subunits, each consisting of three
  polypeptide chains with four domains: an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, a collagen-like
  sequence, an α-helical neck region, and a functional pattern recognition domain
  at the C-terminus. The functional domain differs between collectins and ficolins;
  collectins feature a globular CRD, while ficolins possess a fibrinogen-like domain.
