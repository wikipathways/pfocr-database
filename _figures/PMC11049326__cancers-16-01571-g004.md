caption: Some of the possible mechanisms of resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.
  (A) Silencing of MAPK signaling pathway using BRAF/MEK inhibitors can lead to the
  activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, resulting in circumvention of the inhibitors’
  effect. (B–D) Mechanisms of BRAF signaling activation in the presence of a BRAF
  inhibitor and different levels of RAS. Some elements of the figure were created
  with BioRender
