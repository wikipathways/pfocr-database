caption: An overview of the cholesterol synthesis from squalene. Intermediate reactions
  from lanosterol to desmosterol and lathosterol in the Bloch pathway and Kandutsch-Russell
  pathway respectively are not shown. Sterol-C5-desaturase-like (SC5DL) converts lathosterol
  into 7-dehydrocholesterol. The 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) catalyzes
  the reduction of the delta-24 double bond of sterol intermediates in the Bloch pathway
  forming a sterol which is part of the Kandutsch-Russell pathway. DHCR24 also catalyzes
  the formation of cholesterol from desmosterol.
