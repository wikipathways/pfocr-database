caption: Cdc42 is capable of regulating both mesenchymal migration and amoeboid migration
  due to the selective activation of Cdc42 by different GEF proteins. In melanoma
  cells, DOCK10 activates Cdc42, which can then interact with its downstream effector
  PAK2 to promote amoeboid migration through MLC2. The other well characterized signalling
  pathway which promotes amoeboid migration is RhoA activation of ROCK kinase. Mesenchymal
  migration is regulated by Rac1, via activation of WAVE2. Additionally, Cdc42 is
  proposed to regulate Rac1 activation via a currently uncharacterized GEF. Cdc42
  mediated activation of MRCK proteins is also known to drive mesenchymal migration.
  Rac1 signalling to NFκB induces transcription of the IL-6 gene. IL-6 binds to IL-6R
  to activate JAK2, which phosphorylates Stat3, allowing it to dimerize and translocate
  to the nucleus, where it is transcriptionally active.
