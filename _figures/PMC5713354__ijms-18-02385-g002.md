caption: 'The current possible strategies to bypass AVPR2 mutations responsible for
  X-linked NDI. The most recurrent mutations of AVPR2 responsible for X-linked NDI
  are class II mutations producing full-length misfolded proteins trapped in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), although retaining intrinsic functionality. A lack of AVPR2 basolateral
  expression prevents AVP signaling and AQP2 exocytosis (grey dotted lines). Possible
  therapeutic strategies (full lines) for treating X-linked NDI are focused on: (1)
  the use of chemical chaperones aiding protein folding and inducing export from the
  ER; nonpeptide AVPR2 antagonists, like vaptans, that stabilize receptor conformation
  in the ER, thus allowing it to bypass the ER quality control mechanism; and nonpeptide
  AVPR2 agonists that promote interaction with adenylyl cyclase, thus increasing cAMP
  concentration (+). (2) Activation of the cAMP pathway by stimulating other G proteins-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs) coupled to Gs/adenylyl cyclase expressed in collecting duct principal
  cells such as secretin (SCT), calcitonin (CT), E-prostanoid receptors (EP2/EP3/EP4)
  and β3-adrenoreceptor; the inhibition of phosphodiestherases (PDE) to increase basal
  cAMP levels (+). (3) The activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)
  pathway, promoting AQP2 exocytosis either by stimulating guanylyl cyclase or by
  inhibiting PDE. (4) The inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which
  counteracts AVP-mediated AQP2 exocytosis by a not fully elucidated mechanism. (5)
  The activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) promoting AVP-independent
  AQP2 phosphorylation. (6) Thiazolidinediones (Rosiglitazone) likely promotes Ca2+
  influx that triggers AQP2 exocytosis at the plasma membrane in the absence of AQP2
  phosphorylation. (7) Statins treatment that inhibits RhoA, promotes cortical actin
  depolymerization, and facilitates the constitutive exocytosis of AQP2 at the apical
  membrane.'
