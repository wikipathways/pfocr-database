caption: 'Polyamine biosynthetic pathway in B. thetaiotaomicron. The pathway is shown
  with the corresponding enzymes, which were predicted by BLASTP analyses in our previous
  study [45]. NCPAH, the enzyme analyzed in this study, is indicated by red characters,
  while the enzyme analyzed in our previous study is shown by blue characters. The
  other predicted enzymes are shown by orange characters. The abbreviations are as
  follows. SpeA: arginine decarboxylase; AIH: agmatine deiminase/iminohydrolase; NCPAH:
  N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase; CASDH, carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase; CASDC:
  carboxyspermidine decarboxylase; PotABCD: ATP-binding cassette transporter for spermidine.'
