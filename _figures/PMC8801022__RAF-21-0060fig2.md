caption: Mitochondrial quality control pathways. Mechanisms governing mitochondrial
  turnover can be subdivided into six major pathways (see Box 1 for further detail).
  Representative cellular cues that stimulate each pathway are at the top and examples
  of the process and the proteins required for each pathway are listed at the bottom.
  Pathways 1–5 ultimately result in the mitochondrion engulfed in an autophagosome
  membrane (green) that will fuse with the lysosome, destroying the organelle. The
  source of this membrane differs depending on the pathway (pathways 3 and 4) and
  in some instances has not yet been identified (pathways 1 and 2). Mitochondria are
  also turned over by non-selective autophagy (pathway 5). Mitochondrial derived vesicles
  turn over small portions of the mitochondrion () by transporting them to the lysosome,
  arguably distinct from mitophagy because autophagosomes are not involved (pathway
  6). RAB9-dependent alternative/non-canonical mitophagy involves autophagosomes but
  not ATG5 or 7 (). Figure created with BioRender.
