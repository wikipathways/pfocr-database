caption: Ginsenosides can affect the activity of PI3K/AKT, GSK-3β, and AMPK pathways
  resulting in decreasing oxidative stress [], inflammation, gluconeogenesis, glucose
  production, lipid accumulation, as well as insulin resistance []. There are three
  types of AKT substrates, GSK-3β, FOXO1, and PGC-1α, that could be involved in liver
  glucose production. The activated PI3K/AKT pathway could participate in insulin
  metabolism and glucose uptake improvement via translocating GLUTs (glucose transporters,
  especially GLUT4) to the cell membrane and/or through enhancing glycogen synthesis
  that happens by phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3β) [, ]. On
  the one hand, FOXO could regulate insulin responsiveness and glucose homeostasis
  []. Moreover, AMPK could decrease fat and cholesterol synthesis. Ginsenosides can
  also decrease insulin resistance. In addition, ginsenosides can inhibit ROS production
  via activating Nrf-2, HO-1, and AKT [–]. They can also inhibit the NF-кB signaling
  pathway and decrease inflammation via blocking the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory
  mediators as well as cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, and COX-2 []
