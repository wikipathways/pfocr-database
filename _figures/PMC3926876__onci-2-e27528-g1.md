caption: Figure 1. Interferon α signaling interferes with the TCR-dependent production
  of cAMP in regulatory T cells. (A) T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling causes an increase
  in the intracellular pool of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) of regulatory
  T cells, as well as the transmission of cAMP via gap junctions to responder cells.
  In natural killer (NK) cells or effector T lymphocytes targeted by Tregs, cAMP limits
  effector functions by a hitherto undefined mechanism. (B) The binding of interferon
  α (IFNα) to its receptor activates the MEK-ERK signaling pathway, probably via the
  JAK-STAT axis. Activated ERK in turn stimulates the enzymatic activity of short
  phosphodiesterase 4 isoforms predominantly expressed in T cells, namely, PDE4B and
  PDE4D, resulting in a decrease in intracellular (and hence transmittable) cAMP.
  (C) Blocking the MEK-ERK signaling pathway or the enzymatic activity of PDE4 with
  specific inhibitors counteracts the ability of IFNα to repress cAMP production and
  hence restores the immunosuppressive functions of Tregs.
