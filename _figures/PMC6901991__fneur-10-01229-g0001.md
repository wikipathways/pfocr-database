caption: 'Schematic diagram of a cell with insulin/IGF signaling cascades depicted.
  Insulin may exert its effects through one of three transmembrane kinase receptors:
  IR, IGF1R or the IGFR/IR hybrid receptor. The IGF2R/M6P receptor has an unknown
  signaling potential. IGF1 can act alone or complexed with IGFBP3 or IGFBP5 and ALS
  and interacts with IGF1R and IR. IGF2 when bound to IGFBP2 or IGFBP6 interacts with
  the IGF2R (M6PR), IR or IGF1R. Insulin signaling is also regulated by IGFBP7, which
  can bind both IGF1 and insulin and bind with their receptors. IGFBP7 can also bind
  to the IGF1R which leads to the blockade of the IRS1 intrinsic pathway. Following
  ligand-receptor interaction, signal transduction to the cytosol is via the kinase
  domains of the IR, IGF1/IR and IGF1R receptors. The main targets for phosphorylation
  are the IRSs, which further transduce the signals through divergent messenger cascades,
  eventually leading to the various metabolic effects of insulin and IGFs. These effects
  can be metabolic or mitogenic and include lipid synthesis via PI3K/SREBP pathway,
  glycogen synthesis and protein synthesis and apoptosis regulation via the PI3K/AKT/GSK3/eIF2B
  pathway; and transcription and translation, cellular proliferation and synaptic
  plasticity via the RAS/MAPK/ERKS/RSK/Elk1 pathway. For an excellent review and more
  detail, see (). IGF2 binds to the IGF2R (also known as the M6P receptor) and lacks
  intrinsic kinase activity but has been reported to regulate AKT activity. AKT acts
  to regulate multiple downstream targets including GSK3 and MTOR but is also involved
  in glucose uptake and the expression of GLUT4 which is a key player in glucose uptake.
