caption: Role of apolipoproteins during early steps of hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry.
  The first step of HCV entry consists of the interaction between lipo-viro-particle
  (LVP)-associated ApoE, the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), and the low-density
  lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Subsequently, the LVP interacts with the scavenger
  receptor class B type I (SR-BI) through ApoE and ApoB (not illustrated). The cholesterol
  transfer activity of SR-BI allows E2 exposure and binding of E2 to SR-BI and the
  tetraspanin CD81. Binding on CD81 activates the epithelial growth factor receptor
  (EGFR) signaling pathway and interaction between CD81 and claudin 1 (CLDN1) that
  triggers HCV entry.
