caption: Schematic representation of the influenza viral suppression of the host immune
  response by upregulating cellular proteins. During influenza virus infection, RIG-I
  is primarily activated by the recognition of viral RNA (vRNA). The downstream adaptor,
  mitochondria-anchored protein MAVS, is then engaged, followed by the recruitment
  of IκB kinase ε (IKKε) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), both of which are able
  to activate interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7 by phosphorylation. Phosphorylated
  IRF3/7 then enters the nucleus, driving the production of IFN-β and variant IFN-α.
  After being secreted, IFN-I binds to the cognate receptor (IFNAR) and activates
  the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, involving the Janus kinase (JAK) family and the
  transcription factors STAT1/2. Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 form a complex, leading
  to the induction of hundreds of ISGs that limit influenza viral replication. RIG-I
  signaling can also activate NF-κB, promoting the expression of a series of genes.
  Besides type I IFNs, there is type III IFN (IFN-λ) signaling, which is also proven
  to display antiviral activity by inducing the expression of type III IFN-stimulated
  genes. Influenza virus is reported to increase the expression of a batch of cellular
  proteins (orange) which regulate the NK cell and interferon-mediated innate immune
  response in many ways (red arrows and suppression symbols)
