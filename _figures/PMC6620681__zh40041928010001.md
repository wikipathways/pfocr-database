caption: Schematic representation of de novo and salvage pathways for NAD+ biosynthesis.
  The figure summarizes the key features of both the de novo pathway, whereby l-tryptophan
  (Trp) is metabolized to NAD+, and the salvage pathway, whereby NAD+ is synthesized
  from the NAD+ precursors nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (Nam) riboside (NR),
  and Nam. The de novo biosynthesis of NAD+ starts from Trp, which is enzymatically
  converted in a series of reactions to quinolinic acid (QA). QA is converted by quinolinate
  phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) to NA mononucleotide (NaMN), which is then converted
  to NA adenine dinucleotide (NaAD) by Nam mononucleotide (NMN) adenylyltransferase
  (NMNAT) enzymes. NAD synthase (NADS) generates NAD+ by the amidation of NaAD. In
  the salvage pathway, NMN is synthesized from Nam by the rate-limiting enzyme, Nam
  phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). NMN is also synthesized from NR via phosphorylation
  by NR kinase (NRK). NMN is converted into NAD+ by NMNATs. NA, the other substrate
  of the NAD+ salvage pathway, is converted by NA phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT)
  to NaMN, which is then converted into NaAD by NMNATs and lastly into NAD by NADS.
  Multiple enzymes break down NAD+ to produce Nam and ADP-ribosyl moiety, including
  silent information regulator-2-like enzymes (sirtuins) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
  1 and 2 (PARP-1/2). NMN is a substrate of ectoenzyme CD73, with generation of NR.
