caption: S1PR function in osteogenic cells. Schematic representation of the downstream
  signalling from S1PRs in osteoclast precursors (OCPs), osteoclasts (OCs), osteoblast
  precursors (OBPs), and osteoblasts (OBs). S1PRs are G-protein coupled receptors
  that activate various pathways and are present at different stages of OB and OC
  differentiation [17]. Within OCPs, S1PR1 and S1PR2 alter OC maturation via activation
  of Rho and Rac signalling pathways [24]. S1P can increase OCPs differentiation via
  Cox2, although the mechanism is not fully understood [24]. Although S1PR1-4 are
  expressed in OCs, the role of S1PR3 and S1PR4 are not currently understood [30].
  S1PR1/2 can alter OC migration but the mechanisms underpinning this remain unclear.
  S1PR2 appears to be essential for OC activation. Within OBs, S1PR1 mediates OB differentiation
  via PI3K/AKT signalling and regulates migration via JAK/STAT signalling [31], resulting
  in chemoattraction in response to S1P [31], whereas S1PR2 increases OB differentiation
  via RhoA/ROCK/Smad signalling [30] and can also act through FAK/PI3K/AKT signalling
  to promote chemorepulsion. In OBs, S1PR1 increases OB proliferation [32] and survival
  via MAPK and PI3K signalling. S1PR1-3 are involved in mediating OB maturation through
  as of yet unknown signalling pathways. Activation of SphK1 in OBs promotes osteoblast
  maturation via autocrine S1P signalling through S1PR3 [23]. The function of S1PR4
  in OBs is currently unknown. Created in Biorender.com.
