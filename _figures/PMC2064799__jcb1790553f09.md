caption: A new calpain-dependent switch that controls cell spreading and retraction.
  This schematic illustrates the calpain-dependent switch that controls the direction
  of integrin signaling. In this model, ligand binding to integrins induces not only
  Rac- and cdc42-dependent cell spreading signals, but also phosphorylation of the
  cytoplasmic domain of β3 and elevation of intracellular calcium levels that activate
  calpain. Tyrosine phosphorylation at Y759 of β3 protects the c-Src binding site
  in the C-terminal domain of β3 from calpain cleavage. The β3-associated c-Src facilitates
  cell spreading by inhibiting RhoA-dependent cell retraction signals. In spread cells,
  Y759 of β3 becomes dephosphorylated, allowing β3 cleavage by calpain. Removal of
  the c-Src binding site in β3 by calpain relieves the local inhibitory effect of
  c-Src on the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway, activates RhoA-dependent cell retraction,
  and thus switches the outcome of local integrin signaling from mediating cell spreading
  to retraction. However, the possible involvement of additional pathways is not totally
  excluded.
