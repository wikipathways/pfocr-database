caption: 'Noncanonical Wnt signaling.Notes: (A) Noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway.
  Wnt ligand binding to frizzled receptors activates Dsh and trimeric G-proteins (Gα,β,γ),
  leading to the generation of IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate) and DAG2 (diacylglycerol)
  by PLC (phospholipase C)-mediated conversion of PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol biphosphate)
  and triggering release of calcium ions (Ca2+). Subsequent calcium release activates
  CAMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II), TAK-1 (TGF-β activated kinase 1)
  and NLK (nemo-like kinase). Calcium release also activates PKC (protein kinase C)
  and Cdc42 (cell division control protein 42), and, thereafter, actin cytoskeleton
  is rearranged. In addition, calcium release results in activation of calmodulin,
  calcineurin, and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cell), which is critical for
  control of tissue polarity. Arrows indicate activation, blunt ended lines indicate
  inhibition/blockade. (B) Noncanonical Wnt/PCP (planar cell polarity) pathway. Wnt
  ligand binding to frizzled receptors leads to activation of dishevelled (Dsh), triggering
  stimulation of GTPases RAC (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate), Profilin
  and RHOA (Ras homolog gene family member A) through activation of DAAM1 (dishevelled
  associated activator of morphogenesis 1). Subsequently, actin cytoskeleton is rearranged.
  In addition, Dsh activates RAC and finally activates JNK (c-Jun-N-terminal-kinase)
  and AP1, which has been implicated in cell migration.Abbreviations: RYK, receptor
  tyrosine kinase; ROR, receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor; ROCK, Rho-associated
  protein kinase; MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein kinases; MAPKK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinases and AP1, activator protein 1.'
