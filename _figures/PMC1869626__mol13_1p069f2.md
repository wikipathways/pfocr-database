caption: 'Pathway analysis was performed using PathwayStudio software by importing
  three of the 32–up-regulated genes in our list. The key to color identification
  of network components is as follows: yellow, cell processes; orange, functional
  class; red, protein; red with blue border, genes up-regulated; red connection lines,
  negative regulation; green connection lines, positive regulation; grey lines, unknown
  regulation type.'
