caption: 'In the neuron, shown in a dotted square, BDNF induces three TrkB dimers:
  TK+ homodimer, TK+-T1 heterodimer, and T1 homodimer. The signaling cascade of TK+
  homodimer has been well studied. Activation of PLCγ results in the activation of
  PKC, which promotes synaptic plasticity. Activation of Shc protein induces activation
  of the PI3K-Akt and Ras-MAP kinase signaling cascades, which regulate cell survival
  and differentiation, respectively. It is unclear whether TK+-T1 heterodimer can
  transduce the signals. Furthermore, T1 plays an important role in synaptic transmission,
  although the mechanism is not understood. Since T1 homodimer has not yet been observed
  in neurons, further investigation is needed. In the astrocyte, which is shown in
  a gray square, T1 is a major isoform of TrkB receptors. The binding of BDNF to  T1
  induces T1 homodimer, which results in the release of Rho GDI1 and the morphological
  changes of astrocytes. Moreover, T1 is involved in a Ca2+ influx in astrocytes.
  On the other hand, TTIP (truncated TrkB-interacting protein) is a binding protein
  of T1, but it is not clear whether it transduces the signals.'
