caption: 'Priming effects of stress on NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia. The mechanism
  of stress-induced microglial priming involves a 2-hit process: (1) In the first
  hit, stress increases the levels of glucocorticoids, and induces the alarmin HMGB1
  to be translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and then released to the extracellular
  space. Once released, HMGB1 binds its receptors (e.g., toll-like receptors, TLR)
  and induces upregulation of the NOD-like receptor NLRP3 expression in primed microglia,
  likely through the TLR/NFκB signaling pathway. (2) In the epileptic brain, seizures
  (second hit) activate primed microglia. The inflammasome complex is assembled and
  caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β, resulting in secretion of mature IL-1β. (3) Besides
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation, seizures increase key inflammatory mediators, such
  as COX-2, PGE2, chemokines (CCLs), TNFα, and IL-6. (4) These inflammatory mediators
  act in concert with the subsequent activation of neighboring cells and the recruitment
  of myeloid cells, leading to a potentiated inflammatory response that worsens the
  brain injury. HMGB-1, high mobility group box-1; NLRP3, nucleotide-binding domain
  and leucine-rich repeat containing family, pyrin domain containing 3; TLR, Toll-like
  receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells;
  COX-2, cyclooxygenase 2; PGE2, Prostaglandin E2; CCLs, C-C motif chemokine ligands;
  TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alpha.'
