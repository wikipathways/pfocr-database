caption: 'The mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction in chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease (COPD) lead to increased oxidative stress and inflammation, drivers
  of carcinogenesis. In COPD, there is an increase in mitochondrial damage as a result
  of the release of mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Damaged mitochondria should undergo
  physiological degradation, mitophagy. However, in COPD, the Pink1/Parkin mitophagy
  pathway is disrupted and therefore mitophagy is impaired. The persisting damaged
  mitochondria are a source of oxidants and can induce the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.
  IL: interleukin; DAMPs: damage-associated molecular patterns.'
