caption: Renin angiotensin system enzymatic cascade depicting primary receptor systems,
  biological actions of Angiotensin 2 and Ang-(1–7) and balance between ACE and ACE2.
  a) RAS system demonstrating metabolic pathway of angiotensin peptide, as an initiator
  compound, cleaved to form Ang 1, by renin (kidney). This is followed by cleavage
  of Ang 1 to Ang 2, by ACE, followed by ACE2 mediated cleavage of Ang 2 to Ang-(1–7).
  Ang 2 acts on AT1 and AT2 receptors, while Ang-(1–7) acts on Mas receptors, and
  antagonizes the actions of Ang 2/AT1R axis. b) Curbed levels of ACE2 results in
  shifting of balance, in the RAS, towards Ang 2/AT1R axis (activator), facilitating
  infection progression. Enhanced ACE2 levels, by rhACE2, ACE2 activators or gene
  therapy, shifts the balance towards Ang-(1–7)/MasR axis (inhibitor), resulting in
  protection from the viral infection.
