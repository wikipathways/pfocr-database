caption: 'Model of Wing Polyphenism in the Brown PlanthopperDietary glucose concentration
  above a threshold level activates the insulin signaling pathway, which represses
  the transcription factor FOXO. If the insulin signaling pathway is not activated,
  FOXO is active. FOXO directly or indirectly acts on cell cycle progression in wing
  pads: if FOXO is active cell-cycle progression is arrested (at G2/M) and short-winged
  adults develop. If FOXO is not active cell-cycle progression continues past G2/M,
  cells continue through multiple rounds of mitosis, and long-winged adults develop.'
