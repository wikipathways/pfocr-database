caption: 'This graph demonstrates the possible mechanism of kansui-liquorice enhances
  the efficacy of GBD. kansui-liquorice in GBD could: (1) enhance the activation of
  the NPs signalling pathway, which plays a direct water-expelling (diuretic) effect;
  (2) increase the proportion of CD8CD28 T cells in the PB and TME, and decrease the
  proportion of immune-suppressing cells in the PB (Treg cells) and TME (CD8 Treg
  cells), and promote the development of T cells to enhance the cellular immune, which
  exerts an indirect water-expelling effect. Created with BioRender.com'
