caption: Altered signaling for endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial
  cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in pulmonary hypertension.
  ET-1 is synthesized as preproendothelin (pp-ET-1), which is cleaved to big–ET-1
  by the enzyme furin convertase and then to ET-1 (). ET-1 is released to extracellular
  space in response to various stimuli (). ET-1 exerts its actions on VSMCs via endothelin
  A receptor (ETA) or endothelin B receptor (ETB), predominately the former. It may
  cause sustained vasoconstriction by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration
  resulting from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate–induced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum and by sensitizing the myofilaments to Ca2+ through the Rho kinase (ROCK)
  pathway. It also promotes vascular remodeling through the activation of the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. ET-1 also causes the release of NO from ECs after
  binding to the ETB receptor (). The formation and release of ET-1 is inhibited by
  NO (–). Such action is diminished in pulmonary hypertension, in part because of
  reduced production of NO by uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) ().
  The uncoupled eNOS generates superoxide anions, which reduce the bioavailability
  of NO (). NO can counteract the vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling caused
  by ET-1 action through the stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and the
  elevation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Such effects are impaired in
  pulmonary hypertension (, ). The thick and thin arrows denote enhanced and suppressed
  activity, respectively. The red and green arrows denote stimulatory and inhibitory
  effect, respectively. l-Arg, l-arginine; O•−, superoxide anion.
