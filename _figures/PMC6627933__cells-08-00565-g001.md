caption: 'Dual loop between autophagy lysosomal pathway and α-synuclein. (a) In physiological
  conditions, autophagy machinery participates in α-synuclein degradation through
  both macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy. The intracellular α-synuclein
  levels are maintained at basal conditions and exosomal α-synuclein release is low.
  (b) In pathological conditions, autophagy impairment leads to decreased α-synuclein
  clearance. Intracellular α-synuclein accumulates in the cells and participates in
  the α-synuclein aggregative process. To compensate for this defect, the cell attempts
  to eliminate α-synuclein through the exosomal pathway, inducing increased released
  α-synuclein amounts and cell-to-cell propagation of the protein. Reciprocally, accumulated
  pathological α-synuclein induces cell toxicity mediated in part by autophagy impairment,
  diving the cell into an endless cycle of dyshomeostasis. Hsc70: cytosolic chaperone
  heat-shock cognate 70kDa protein; CatD: Cathepsin D; CatB: Cathepsin B; GCase: β-glucocerebrosidase.'
