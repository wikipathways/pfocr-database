caption: Aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway behaviour under different oxygen
  conditions. The metabolite level bars in the graphs are the average and the standard
  error from at least 4 measurements. The control and the Fab-expressing strain are
  represented by black-grey and yellow bars respectively. Oxygenation conditions from
  normoxic to oxygen-limited conditions are represented as light to dark color scale.
  The mRNA data are indicated as m plus the specific reaction name. Each graph has
  its own scale.
