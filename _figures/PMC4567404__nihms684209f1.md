caption: In lean adipose tissue (left), immunologic elements associated with a type
  2 immune response dominate. These include group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2),
  regulatory T cells (Treg), eosinophils (Eos), and alternatively activated macrophages
  (AAM). IL-33, helminth infection, and possibly exposure to cold can each promote
  these adipose tissue type 2 associated immune cells. In mice and humans, obesity
  is associated with decreases in each of the type 2 immune cells while promoting
  type 1 immune cells associated with classical inflammatory responses (right), including
  neutrophils (PMN), CD8 T cells, CD4 type 1 helper (Th1) T cells, and pro-inflammatory
  M1 macrophages. We speculate that type 1-associated bacterial and viral infections,
  which promote systemic insulin resistance, may also promote this pathway in white
  adipose tissue. Similarly, natural age-related alterations in the immune system,
  including accumulation of virus-reactive CD8 T cells, may also contribute to this
  pathway.
