caption: 'Mechanisms of fibrosis resolution: apoptosis. Activated HSC could undergo
  apoptosis as a part of the mechanism of fibrosis resolution. They transition from
  a survival phenotype that is characterized by enhanced expression of TIMP-1, activation
  of the Bcl-2/NFκB pathway and phosphorylation of C/EBPβ to an apoptotic phenotype,
  exhibiting reduction of TIMP-1 expression, and an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio
  that leads to activation of caspases. FXR leads to SHP-mediated down-regulation
  of TIMP. In response to ROS generation and ER stress, cannabinoids stimulate the
  CB2 receptor, promoting HSC apoptosis. NK cells interact with RAE1 in HSCs via the
  NKG2D receptor and trigger a TRAIL-mediated apoptotic response in HSC. C/EBPβ, CCAAT
  enhancer binding protein β; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FXR, farnesoid X receptor;
  NK, natural killer; SHP, small heterodimer partner.'
