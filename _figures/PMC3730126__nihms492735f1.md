caption: Molecular mechanisms of cellular insulin resistance in muscle and liver.
  Increased intracellular diacyglycerols lead to activation of PKC-θ and PKC-ε in
  skeletal muscle and liver, respectively, which, in turn, decreases insulin-stimulated
  IRS-1/IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, PI3K activation and downstream insulin signaling.
  (a) In the muscle, this results in decreased muscle glycogen synthesis, owing to
  reduced insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. (b) In the
  liver, this results in decreased hepatic glycogen synthesis, owing to decreased
  activation of glycogen synthase, and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis. The use
  of transgenic and knockout mice, as well as antisense oligonucleotides to knock
  down specific proteins, has allowed the validation of the diacylglycerol-mediated
  insulin hypothesis of insulin resistance through the manipulation of key proteins
  in the pathway. KO, knockout; GLUT4, glucose transporter type 4; TAG, triacylglycerol;
