caption: A model of the molecular cascade downstream of Nodal and Activin A signalling
  in EpiSCs. Nodal activates Mixl1 activity via Smad and Foxh1 transactivation to
  induce mesendoderm progenitors in the PS. Mixl1 in turns represses Nodal expression.
  Foxh1 and Gsc cooperatively repress Mixl1 expression. Nodal signals via the TGF-β–Smad2/3/4
  pathway and activates MAPK/RhoA/PI3K signalling. The downstream activity of these
  pathways dismantles the epithelial phenotype of the epiblast cells, and promotes
  the acquisition of a transitory mesenchymal cell state during gastrulation. Smad
  factors, along with Eomes, promote expression of endoderm genes (Sox17, Foxa2, Cxcr4,
  Gata). It is postulated that the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype is a pre-requisite
  step of the allocation of cells to the endoderm lineage in the embryo, which can
  be enhanced by Wnt/β-catenin signalling activity. Activin A, in contrast to Nodal,
  upregulates some components of the Smad-mediated cascade that promote via Id proteins
  the maintenance of an epithelial cell state. The omission of the mesenchymal state
  during Activin A induced differentiation may hamper the generation of competent
  endoderm cells that can differentiate into more advanced cell types. Genes identified
  as differentially expressed by microfluidic qPCR are shown in red. (Online version
  in colour.)
