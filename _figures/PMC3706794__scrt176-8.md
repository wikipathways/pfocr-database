caption: Proposed mechanism demonstrating the interplay of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1)
  and the Wnt canonical pathway in the modulation of adipogenesis in mesenchymal stem
  cells (MSC)-derived adipocytes. HO-1 suppresses adipocyte differentiation by increasing
  expression of key regulators including Wnt10b, p-glycogen synthase kinase (GSK),
  β-catenin and Sonic hedgehog (shh) and decreasing expression of adipogenic transcription
  factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a (CEBP)α, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor (PPAR)γ and fatty-acid-binding protein (aP2). These effects led to decrease
  in lipid accumulation and increase of pre-adipocytes and healthy adipocytes that
  produce cytoprotective adipokines, such as adiponectin.

  adipocytes decreases differentiation and lipid accumulation via upregulation of
  the canonical Wnt signaling cascade.
