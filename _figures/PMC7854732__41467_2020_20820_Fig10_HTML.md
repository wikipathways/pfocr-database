caption: On the left side, SPOP mutant prostate cancer tumorigenesis is depicted.
  SPOP mutant tumors impair the degradation of substrate proteins such as AR activators
  (e.g, TRIM24) and ZMIND11, which ultimately triggers the AR pathway and dampens
  the ERG signaling. In this context, SPOP mutant tumors are more susceptible to ADT
  therapy. On the right side, TMPRSS2-ERG mutant tumorigenesis is depicted. ERG binds
  to the promoter of wild-type SPOP, upregulating its protein expression. Consequently,
  AR activators and ZMYND11 substrate proteins get degraded, leading to the AR pathway
  downregulation and unleashing the ERG signaling pathway. TMPRSS2-ERG mutant tumors
  are thus sensitive to high-dose androgen therapy or SPOP inhibition.
