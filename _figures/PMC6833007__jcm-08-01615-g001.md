caption: 'Mechanisms involved in activation and regulation of NLRP3 canonical pathway.
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires two signals. The “priming” signal is triggered
  by PAMP/DAMP recognition by PPRs (e.g. TLRs) and certain cytokines (e.g. TNF-α,
  IL-1β) and activates NF-κB in the cell nucleus. This leads to NLRP3, pro-IL1-β and
  pro-IL-18 gene transcription. The second signal induces the assembly of NLRP3, ASC,
  and caspase-1 to form an active NLRP3 inflammasome and ultimately leads to the release
  of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Gasdermin D is cleaved and becomes inserted into the
  cell membrane, forming pores and inducing pyroptosis. The mechanisms proposed for
  the second NLRP3 activating signals are shown and include: a) changes in cytosolic
  levels of ions, such as K+, Cl- and Ca+2, b) lysosomal destabilization and the release
  of cathepsins, c) mitochondrial dysfunction-derived signals such as mtROS, mtDNA
  and d) metabolic changes. PtdIns4P on dTGN drive NLRP3 activation. Aerobic glycolysis
  pathways and the TCA cycle also activate NLRP3. Autophagy and mitophagy inhibit
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation. IFNs also inhibit NLRP3 activation through NO production.
