caption: A working model for redox signaling in light-regulated translation. The redox
  state of the regulatory VDS of RB60 controls the RNA-binding capacity of psbA 5′PC,
  which binds the RNA through the RB47 protein. Oxidation of the regulatory VDS inactivates
  and reduction activates binding of the PC to the 5′UTR of psbA mRNA and consequently
  psbA mRNA translation. Light regulates translation via a prerequisite (priming)
  redox-independent pathway and a redox-dependent pathway. The priming pathway probably
  involves dephosphorylation and specific oxidation of the pool of RB60 (either by
  autooxidation or by an RB60-specific oxidizing factor), rendering RB60 receptive
  to the reductive signal transduced by the redox-dependent pathway. In the redox-dependent
  pathway, light energy is captured by the thylakoid-associated photosynthetic complexes
  to produce reducing potential. Photosynthetic reducing equivalents are transduced
  by ferredoxin (Fd), ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (FTR), and thioredoxin (Trx)
  to reduce the regulatory VDS of RB60. Hence, in the light, a counterbalanced action
  of reducing and oxidizing activities modulates the redox state of the pool of RB60
  and consequently the translation of psbA mRNA, in parallel with fluctuating light
  intensities. Transfer to the dark activates phosphorylation and inactivates the
  oxidation of RB60, resulting in an inactive form of psbA 5′PC that is not redox
  responsive. The encircled P denotes an inorganic phosphate.

  description: A working model for redox signaling in light-regulated translation.
    The redox state of the regulatory VDS of RB60 controls the RNA-binding capacity
    of psbA 5′PC, which binds the RNA through the RB47 protein. Oxidation of the regulatory
    VDS inactivates and reduction activates binding of the PC to the 5′UTR of psbA
    mRNA and consequently psbA mRNA translation. Light regulates translation via a
    prerequisite (priming) redox-independent pathway and a redox-dependent pathway.
    The priming pathway probably involves dephosphorylation and specific oxidation
    of the pool of RB60 (either by autooxidation or by an RB60-specific oxidizing
    factor), rendering RB60 receptive to the reductive signal transduced by the redox-dependent
