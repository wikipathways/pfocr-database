caption: Acquisition of IDH mutant results in substantial metabolic reprogramming.
  Neomorphic activity depletes the Krebs cycle by exhausting α-KG for D-2-HG production.
  Metabolites such as glutamine, glutamate and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) serve
  as compensatory sources to fuel cellular metabolism. D-2-HG further impacts cellular
  metabolism such as the biosynthesis of glutamate and NAD. D-2-HG affects the biological
  function of PHD2, whereas the alterations in hypoxia-sensing pathway remain unclear.
