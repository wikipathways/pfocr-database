caption: A schematic representation of three biosynthetic pathways of interest in
  chicory. Question marks indicate enzymes that have been characterized biochemically
  but are not supported by molecular data. (A) Sesquiterpene lactone (STL) biosynthetic
  pathway in chicory based on the studies of De Kraker et al. [], Cankar et al. [],
  Testone et al. [], and Bogdanovic et al. []; (B) putative metabolic pathways involved
  in hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) biosynthesis in plants and the two main enzymes HCT
  and HQT according to Legrand et al. []; (C) model of inulin metabolism, proposed
  by Van Laere and Van Den Ende [] and Shoorideh et al. [].
