caption: A model depicted that FBW7 was a novel E3 ligase for GSK-3β-induced degradation
  of NFAT1, and NFAT1 increased TNF expression to upregulate PD-L1 expression in RCC
  cells. Then, overactivation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway stabilized
  NFAT1 in sunitinib-resistant RCC cells. Furthermore, we found that downregulation
  of SETD2 and FOXA1 expression contributed to the decrease in FBW7 expression in
  sunitinib-resistant RCC cells. Thus, the FBW7/NFAT1 axis played a role in the RCC
  response to TKIs and ICIs
