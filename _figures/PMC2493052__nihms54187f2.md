caption: 'De novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids is initiated in the ER, followed by
  transport of ceramide to the Golgi (vesicular or via CERT). In the Golgi, ceramide
  is used as precursor substrate for glycosphingolipid and sphingomyelin biosynthesis.
  Sphingomyelin is then transported to the cell membrane, where it can be hydrolyzed
  to ceramide (sphingomyelin cycle). In endosomes, ceramide can be hydrolyzed to sphingosine
  and is then recycled in the ER, which is mediated by the ‘salvage pathway’ (dashed
  arrows). Ceramide generated in the ER can be transported to the nucleus (via perinuclear
  ER cisternae) and the mitochondria (via mitochondrial-associated ER membrane). Ceramide
  can also be converted to C1P or S1P.C1P: Ceramide-1-phosphate; CERT: Ceramide transport
  protein; CK: Ceramide kinase; ER: Endoplasmic reticulum; S1P: Sphingosine-1-phosphate;
  SK: Sphingosine kinase; SMase: Sphingomyelinase; SMS: Sphingomyelin synthase; SPT:
  Serine palmitoyltransferase.'
