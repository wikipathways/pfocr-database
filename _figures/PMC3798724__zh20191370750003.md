caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway in the primary cilia. In the absence of Hedgehog,
  Smo is suppressed by an unclear mechanism. After Hedgehog binding to Patched1, Smo
  is activated and subsequently facilitates the formation of active form of Gli, which
  enters the nucleus to regulate target genes. SuFu and Spop are all involved in Gli
  trafficking and stability.
