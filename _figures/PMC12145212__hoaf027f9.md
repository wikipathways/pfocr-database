caption: Mechanisms by which hypoxia impairs spermatogonial proliferation. Hypoxia
  exposure impairs spermatogonia proliferation via the SEPT2–PP2A/B56γ–AKT signaling
  pathway. Hypoxia inhibits the binding of POLR2A to the Septin2 (Sept2) promoter,
  thereby suppressing Sept2 transcriptional activity. This downregulation of SEPT2
  reduces its competition with the deubiquitinase responsible for PP2A/B56y degradation,
  leading to enhanced PP2A/B56y stability. As a result, PP2A-mediated AKT dephosphorylation
  triggers G1–S phase cell cycle arrest, ultimately impairing the proliferative capacity
  of spermatogonia
