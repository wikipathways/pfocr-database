caption: 'Itaconate-induced cell protective anti-stress responses. Inflammatory stimulus
  such as LPS upregulates the expression of CAD (also known as IRG1), an enzyme converts
  cis-aconitate to itaconate in the mitochondria []. LPS-induced cellular activation
  leads to glycolytic flux and the transition towards an anaplerotic TCA cycle with
  high production levels of itaconate []. High itaconate levels suppress SDH, blocking
  succinate-mediated inflammatory processes and inducing the anti-inflammatory proteins
  NRF2 and cyclic ATF3 []. Succinate may enhance proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β pathway
  through SUCNR1 []. Those blue labels indicate the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative-stress
  responses; those red labels indicate proinflammatory responses. LPS: Lipopolysaccharide,
  CAD: Cis-aconitate decarboxylase, IRG1: Immune-responsive gene 1, SDH: Succinate
  dehydrogenase, NRF2: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, ARF3: AMP-dependent
  transcription factor 3, SUCNR1: Succinate receptor 1, IDH: Isocitrate dehydrogenase'
