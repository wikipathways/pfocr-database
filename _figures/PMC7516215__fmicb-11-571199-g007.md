caption: The possible mechanism by which the growth of Marine Group II Euryarchaeota
  is stimulated by carbon flow affected by mesoscale eddies. Particulate organic matter
  (POM) produced in the upper ocean enters the ocean interior by sedimentation and
  physical mixing and releases NH4+ under the action of heterotrophic microorganisms.
  MGI Thaumarchaeota couples the oxidation of ammonia with carbon fixation in HCO3–
  through the 3HP/4HB pathway, and the intermediate acetyl-CoA can act as a precursor
  of the TCA cycle and participate in the metabolism of MGII. Much organic matter
  produced by ammonia-oxidizing archaea stored in mesopelagic water is brought into
  the DCM layer by the mesoscale process. This new organic carbon provides a carbon
  source for heterotrophic MGII members and rapidly stimulates the growth of specific
  MGII taxa. The CO2 produced during degradation is released into the atmosphere by
  sea–air exchange or supplied to plankton of the DCM layer.
