caption: Applied and experimental bacterial vaccines. Today, established bacterial
  vaccines that are in use are the immunizations with WCA, recombinant proteins including
  toxoids, polysaccharide/protein conjugates, live attenuated vaccines (LAV), and,
  since the last few years, also bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Vaccination
  with WCA, bacterial ghosts (BGs), and recombinant proteins/toxoids predominantly
  results in the processing of protein components for the presentation via MHCII and
  the activation predominantly of CD4+ T cells. In addition, antigen-specific activated
  B cells produce high-affinity IgG antibodies with the help of CD4+ T cells, and
  a memory response is induced. In the case of polysaccharide/protein conjugates,
  the carrier protein serves as the protein component that can be recognized by CD4+
  T cells. This enables B cells to produce high-affinity IgG antibodies against the
  polysaccharide instead of the production of low-affinity IgM without T cell help.
  Immunization against intracellular bacterial pathogens requires the activation of
  cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which is usually not efficiently achieved with these methods.
  Antigens recognized by CD8+ T cells predominantly derive from cytosolic proteins
  that are degraded by the proteasome and further processed for the presentation via
  MHCI. A major difficulty of efficient vaccination against intracellular bacterial
  pathogens lies in the introduction of immunogens into the cytosol of host cells.
  This can be achieved by the use of OMVs, LAV, viral vectors, bacterial vectors,
  immunization with DNA or mRNA, and the use of the T3SS translocation system of bacteria
  such as Salmonella. Immunization with OMVs and LAV results in both antigen presentation
  by MHCII and MHCI molecules for the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whereby
  the mechanisms of MHCI presentation in the case of OMV immunization are not well
  understood and may be a result of cross presentation, either by the release of proteins
  from the lysosome into the cytosol or by fusion of lysosomes with MHCI-containing
  vesicles. LAV may release proteins into the cytosol. In addition, surface proteins
  may be accessible to the proteasome for processing via the MHCI presentation pathway.
  The most frequently used viral vectors for vaccination are adenoviruses and modified
  vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA). Adenoviruses translocate their double-stranded (ds)
  DNA genome into the nucleus of non-dividing cells for replication. Viral mRNA transcription
  products are exported into the cytosol of the infected cells where ribosomal translation
  occurs. In contrast, MVA, which also carries a dsDNA genome, has a unique replication
  cycle that is restricted to the cytosol. In both cases, proteins are expressed in
  the cytosol of infected cells, which has also been shown for bacterial vectors that
  carry plasmid DNA with eukaryotic expression cassettes for the expression of immunogens.
  Cytosolic protein expression is also achieved by the direct transfection of target
  cells with either DNA or mRNA. While mRNA is transferred directly into the cytosol
  for protein translation, DNA has to enter the nucleus of the target cell for transcription,
  which is usually more efficiently achieved with viral vectors. Finally, a rather
  experimental approach to the introduction of antigens into the cytosol of target
  cells is the use of recombinant attenuated bacteria such as Salmonella that possess
  a T3SS translocation system. This system allows active and direct injection of proteins
  into the cytosol of target cells. In contrast to the use of WCA and LAV, all other
  methods generally require knowledge of the immunogenic determinants of the pathogen
  to prepare recombinant vaccines.
