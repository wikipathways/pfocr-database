caption: GTF3B differentially expressed genes pathway developed by MetaCore. Experimental
  data from TCGA were linked to and visualized on pathway maps as thermometer-like
  figures. To study the gene networks and signaling pathways that could be affected
  by the chosen genes, we exported genes expressed with GTF3B and then uploaded them
  to the MetaCore platform for a path analysis. The MetaCore pathway analysis indicated
  that the “chemotaxis lysophosphatidic acid signaling via GPCRs”-related pathway
  was correlated with colorectal cancer development.
