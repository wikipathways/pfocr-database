caption: The Diagram illustrates how Fasn inhibition improves erectile dysfunction
  in spontaneously hypertensive rats. By conducting transcriptomic sequencing and
  metabolomic sequencing of penile corpus cavernosum tissues, the lipid metabolism
  pathway and hub gene Fasn were identified. Fasn is involved in the pathological
  process of hypertension-induced ED through inhibition of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway,
  leading to ROS accumulation and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. The Fasn
  inhibitor C75 improves erectile function through reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting
  NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway
