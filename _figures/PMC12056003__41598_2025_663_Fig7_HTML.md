caption: Proposed mechanism of IFITMs on CHIKV infection in human dermal cells. IFITMs
  expression in response of viral infection downregulated the expression of LGP2 and
  upregulated the expression of TLRs resulting in increasing type I interferon expression.
  IFITMs also upregulated the expression of STAT1 in IFNs signaling pathway which
  could further induced ISGs expression that can act against viral infection. Moreover,
  IFITMs in corresponding with cholesterol could inhibit the fusion step of viral
  replication restricted the viral infection. Figure was created using Keynote version
  9.1 (https://www.apple.com/keynote/)
