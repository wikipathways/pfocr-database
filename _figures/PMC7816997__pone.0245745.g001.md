caption: (A) A schematic representation of an example of the Nitrogen cycle in prokaryotes
  is shown. Different prokaryotic organisms are able to catalyze each of the reactions
  depicted. Figure adapted from []. (B) Nitrate assimilation pathway in M. smegmatis.
  Genes encoding proteins for each step of the pathway are shown. *MSMEG_4206 is annotated
  as a pseudogene due to a frameshift. ¥Five additional homologues of unknown function
  are present in the genome. Gene annotations were obtained from Mycobrowser and reference
  [].
