caption: 1. Lactate from skeletal muscle and intracellular cardiomyocytes provide
  substrate for ATP generation during anaerobic glycolysis.2. NRG-1 levels increase
  binding to erbB2/erbB4, activating the PI3K/Akt pathway that inhibits MPTP opening
  during cellular hypoxia.3. Intracellular calcium load is decreased, leading to decreased
  activation of calpain.4. Decreased levels of MAO-A and increased SOD activity through
  activation of Nrf2 activation.5. Endothelial eNOS and intracellular NO levels rise,
  inhibiting caspase 3 activity.6. Decreased circulating sCD40L and increased production
  of IL-10.7. Increased levels of miRNAs such as miR-222 and MiR-17–3p lead to inhibition
  of transcriptional and translation responses deleterious to cardiomyocyte function.8.
  Genetic modification leads to de novo synthesis of effector proteins during second
  window of protection.
