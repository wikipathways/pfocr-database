caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway of LPS-induced apoptosis. LPS,
  as well as inflammatory factors, activate MYD88 by acting on the membrane receptor
  TLR4, thus mediating the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Activated NF-κB
  moves to the nucleus and exerts the role of a transcription factor to regulate the
  expression of genes. It is also involved in regulating the expression of genes such
  as Bax, Bcl-2, etc., and up-regulating the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins
  such as Bax and down-regulating the expression level of anti-apoptotic proteins
  such as Bcl-2. Bax and Bak form a pore-like structure at the mitochondrial surface,
  which leads to the loss of structural integrity of the mitochondrial membrane and
  the release of contents. This results in the activation of the intracellular caspase
  family and the apoptosis of the cellular mitochondrial pathway
