caption: Hedgehog ligand receptor (Ptc) is a transmembrane protein. (A) When there
  is no binding of Hh ligand to Ptc, Ptc represses the downstream protein Smo. Smo
  represses the downstream Gli family. (B)When Hh ligand binds to Ptc, Ptc activates
  Smo, which subsequently activates Gli family and induces transcription of Hh targeted
  genes.
