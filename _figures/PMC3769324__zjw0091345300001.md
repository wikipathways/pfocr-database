caption: Overall strategy to trace UDP-GlcNAc metabolism by LC-MS. A, For isotopomer
  analysis of nucleotide sugars, cells were cultured in medium containing 5.5 mm 13C6-glucose
  and nucleotide sugars fractions were then extracted as described in the experimental
  procedures. The resulting isotopomer ratios of 13C-UDP-HexNAc (UDP-GlcNAc plus UDP-GalNAc)
  and 13C-CMP-NeuAc allows the measurement of the UDP-GlcNAc synthesis and use pathway,
  respectively. B, For isotopomer analysis of N- or O-glycans, cells were cultured
  in medium containing 5.5 mm glucose and 1 mm 13C2-glucosamine, and the glycan alditols
  were analyzed by LC-MS. The resulting isotopomers of each glycan reflect UDP-GlcNAc
  use in each step of glycan biosynthesis.
