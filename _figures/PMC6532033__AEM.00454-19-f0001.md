caption: (A and B) The hybrid pathway of nicotine oxidative degradation by A. tumefaciens
  S33 (A) and the arrangement of pno, etfAB-I, and euo genes in the genome of A. tumefaciens
  S33 (B). NdhAB, nicotine dehydrogenase; Paz, pseudoazurin; Hno, 6-hydroxynicotine
  oxidase; Pno, 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine oxidase (renamed 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine
  dehydrogenase in this study); EtfAB-I, electron transfer flavoprotein; Euo, electron
  transfer flavoprotein:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; ETC, electron transport chain;
  Ald, predicted aldehyde dehydrogenase; Hsh, 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine hydroxylase;
  mfs, predicted major facilitator superfamily transporter gene; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; tetR, predicted TetR family transcriptional regulator gene. Purple arrows,
  genes encoding key enzymes in nicotine degradation characterized in this study;
  red arrows, genes encoding enzymes characterized previously; orange arrow, predicted
  gene encoding key enzyme for nicotine degradation; green arrows, predicted transporter
  and regulatory genes; and gray arrows, genes with unknown function.
