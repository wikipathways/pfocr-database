caption: Signaling Pathways and Cellular Processes Regulated by Keratins, Vimentin,
  and Nestin. Proteins and cellular processes activated (arrows) or inhibited (bar-headed
  lines) by (A,C) keratins, (B) nestin, and (D) vimentin. (A) Keratins in blue are
  involved in either activation or inhibition of proteins in black, and upregulate
  pro-tumorigenic processes in red. For example, K19 enables activation of multiple
  signaling molecules, including HER2, Src, and Notch for cell proliferation. Alternatively,
  multiple keratins may converge on a same cellular process as illustrated by regulation
  of cell migration by K8, K14, K17, K19, and K80 through various signaling molecules,
  including STAT3, hnRNP K, p38, Erk, and Akt. Processes, such as chemoresistance,
  that are directly linked to keratins indicate lack of known mediators. (B) Downstream
  factors and pro-tumorigenic processes in red regulated by nestin. Some of the better-known
  roles of nestin include maintaining cell stemness through CDK5 inhibition. (C) Keratins
  in red inhibit proteins in black and downregulate pro-tumorigenic processes in blue.
  For example, K6 inhibits cell migration by inactivating Src. Interestingly, K19
  activates Notch signaling pathway to promote cell proliferation in hepatocellular
  carcinomas but inhibits Notch signaling to suppress proliferation of breast cancer
  cells. Such a difference exemplifies context-dependent functions of keratins. (D)
  Downstream factors and pro-tumorigenic processes in red regulated by vimentin. Vimentin
  is upregulated in cells that have gone through the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition,
  and it promotes invasion and migration via activation of Erk and Rac1 signaling
  pathways.
