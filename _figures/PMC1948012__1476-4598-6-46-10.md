caption: Proposed mechanism of action for AICAR in human leukemia ALL cells. After
  crossing the cell membrane, AICAR is metabolized by the adenosine kinase (AK) to
  its active mono-phosphorylated form ZMP (AMP analogue) which activates AMPK. The
  activated AMPK will signal to multiple downstream targets impinging on cell growth,
  cell proliferation, and cell survival. In ALL cells, induction of AMPK by AICAR
  increases the levels of p53, the cdk inhibitor p27, and the p38-MAPK leading to
  inhibition of cell proliferation, cell arrest in G1-phase, and apoptosis. In addition,
  P-AMPK activates TSC2 reducing the level of mTOR, an important regulatory factor
  of the PI3K/Akt pathway necessary for cell proliferation [24]. As a cell survival
  mechanism, the level of Akt is increased to overcome the reduction in mTOR attempting
  to restore or promote cell growth. AICAR, 5-Aminoimidazole-4-Carboxamide-1-β-4-Ribofuranoside;
  AK, adenosine kinase; AMPK, AMP activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; Akt, proteinase kinase B; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
