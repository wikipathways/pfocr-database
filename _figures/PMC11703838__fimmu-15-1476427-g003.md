caption: TCSCs ecological niche. (A) immune microenvironment. Through paracrine signaling
  or direct cell-to-cell contact, TCSCs communicate with immune cell cells in a variety
  of complex ways. This interaction influences the TME immune landscape’s formation
  and evolution and, to some extent, shapes the TCSCs’ capacity for self-renewal and
  multidirectional differentiation. (B) hypoxic microenvironment. Rapid tumor growth,
  pathologic angiogenesis, and stromal fibrosis all contribute to the TC’s inadequate
  oxygen supply in some areas. HIF-1α mediates hypoxia to suppress anti-tumor immunity
  and enhance the dryness of cancer cells, promoting the stem cell-like properties
  of thyroid cancer. (C) metabolic microenvironment. Through metabolic reprogramming,
  TCSCs effectively use scarce nutritional resources, such as glucose and glutamine,
  to satisfy the need for fast multiplication. However, the metabolic wastes they
  generate, including lactate and ROS, can also impair immune cell function. (D) acidic
  microenvironment. TCSCs accelerate the advancement of TC by increasing the production
  of lactic acid and the glycolytic pathway. This, in conjunction with protons and
  carbonic acid, creates an acidic milieu that supports TCSCs survival and impair
  immune cell function and provide an immunosuppressive environment that promotes
  the growth of tumors
