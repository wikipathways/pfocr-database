caption: Glycerophospholipid metabolism is induced in parasitized A. gossypii. Pathway
  of select glycerophospholipid metabolites from the KEGG database with indications
  of quantified lipid classes and genes significantly regulated in parasitized aphids.
  Red and green colored boxes indicate increased and decreased expression levels of
  genes in parasitized aphids, respectively. Yellow boxes indicate decreased lipid
  classes and blue boxes indicate high expression of glycerophospholipids. In the
  fat synthesis pathway, acetyl CoA is an intermediate between the TCA cycle and the
  fat synthesis pathway. Besides, G3P is the intermediate between glycolysis and the
  fat synthesis pathway. TAGs are produced by G3P and acyl-coenzyme A; while G3P is
  converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) via glycolysis, and acyl CoA is converted
  to palmityl coenzyme A and acyl-coenzyme A. Some genes in the glycolytic pathway
  and TCA cycle that are believed to stimulate the phospholipid metabolic pathways
  are also shown. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Lpgat1, lysophosphatidylglycerol
  acyltransferase 1; gk, glycerol kinase.
