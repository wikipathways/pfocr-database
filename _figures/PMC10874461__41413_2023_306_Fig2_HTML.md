caption: X-linked osteoporosis in males. X-linked osteoporosis is most likely more
  common in males, given the higher rates of mutation in genes, such as PLS3 and factor
  VIII (FVIII), that are located on the X chromosome. PLS3 deficiency induces an imbalance
  between bone resorption and formation, resulting in insufficient mineralization
  in osteoblasts, increased bone resorption in osteoclasts, and dysregulation of mechanosensing
  in osteocytes. A missing or defective clotting protein, factor VIII (FVIII), may
  directly disrupt bone homeostasis via the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway in hemophilia A
  (HA) patients. The FVIII/VWF complex inhibits RANKL and increases the activity of
  OPG, thereby promoting osteogenesis. Activated FVIII detaches from VWF, binds to
  FIX, and then activates FX to FXa, which is responsible for the conversion of prothrombin
  into thrombin. Thrombin binds to PRL-1 to increase the production of IL-6, which
  further enhances the expression of RUNX2 and osteocalcin, decreasing the expression
  of RANKL. FVIII or FIX regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduces the production
  of sclerostin to further inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway. OPG osteoprotegerin,
  RANKL receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand, TNF-α tumor necrosis
  factor α, IFN-γ interferon-γ; IL-1β, interleukin-1β, IL-6 interleukin-6, MAPK mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, COX-2 cyclooxygenase 2, PGE2 prostaglandin E2, EP4 PGE2 receptor
  4, RUNX2 runt-related transcription factor 2
