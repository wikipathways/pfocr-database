caption: Mammary cell involution in response to stretch. Mechanical stretch imposed
  on mammary alveolar cells by milk stasis secondary to weaning activates the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and induces expression
  of the mechanosensitive transcription factor STAT3. Downstream of these molecules,
  increased expression of the transcription factor c-fos and its association into
  AP-1 dimers results in the expression of proapoptosis genes. One such gene is leukemia
  inhibitory factor (LIF), which feedbacks on the cell to promote further activation
  of STAT3, thereby perpetuating the apoptotic signaling pathway. Moreover, STAT3
  activates 2 regulatory subunits of PI3K (p50-α and p55-α), which in turn inhibits
  AKT phosphorylation. Phosphorylated AKT provides a critical cell survival signal
  that must be silenced during mammary cell involution. AKT indicates protein kinase;
  STAT3, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3.

  description: Mammary cell involution in response to stretch. Mechanical stretch
    imposed on mammary alveolar cells by milk stasis secondary to weaning activates
    the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
    (ERK1/2) and induces expression of the mechanosensitive transcription factor STAT3.
    Downstream of these molecules, increased expression of the transcription factor
    c-fos and its association into AP-1 dimers results in the expression of proapoptosis
    genes. One such gene is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which feedbacks on the
    cell to promote further activation of STAT3, thereby perpetuating the apoptotic
    signaling pathway. Moreover, STAT3 activates 2 regulatory subunits of PI3K (p50-α
    and p55-α), which in turn inhibits AKT phosphorylation. Phosphorylated AKT provides
    a critical cell survival signal that must be silenced during mammary cell involution.
    AKT indicates protein kinase; STAT3, signal transducers and activators of transcription
    3.
