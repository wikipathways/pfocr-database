caption: PDGFC gene expression in the signaling cell is regulated by the Egr-1 and
  Sp1 transcription factors. SNP rs28999109 disrupts the consensus binding sequence
  for Egr-1 and Sp1 and decreases promoter activity. In the extracellular matrix the
  inactive PDGF-CC homodimer containing the CUB domains is cleaved by tPA to release
  the active dimer consisting of growth factor domains. PAI-1 is a tPA inhibitor in
  plasma fibrinolysis and Neuroserpin inhibits tPA in the CNS parenchyma. PDGFR-α
  is present in the responding cell together with LRP1, a co-receptor that facilitates
  efficient cleavage of PDGF-CC by tPA. Upon ligand binding PDGFR-α becomes phosphorylated
  and activates intracellular signaling pathways including PI3K, Ras MAPK, p38 MAPK
  and Plc-γ.
