caption: Proposed pathway of Hx (↓Po2)/EL-induced cell death. Hx/EL increased HIF-1α
  accumulation and activation, leading to increased transcription of HIF-1α-directed
  genes BNIP3 and Nix (–7). Hx/EL also enhanced activation of p38 (). Inhibition of
  p38 reduced BNIP3 expression () and protected cells from Hx/EL-induced cell death
  (). Deficiency in HIF-1α signaling attenuated BNIP3 expression () and protected
  cells from Hx/EL cytotoxicity (). Hx/EL resulted in enhanced lipid peroxidation,
  which is involved in cell death ().
