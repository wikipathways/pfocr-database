caption: Regulation of C/EBPβ in MDSCs. Stimulation by G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, or other
  factors strongly induces C/EBPβ expression in MDSCs. The JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway
  may function as an upstream regulator of C/EBPβ. Three isoforms of C/EBPβ are generated
  from its mRNA through a ribosomal scanning mechanism. In addition, C/EBPβ cooperates
  with p-STAT3 or NF-κB by sharing the same target genes. On the one hand, C/EBPβ
  LAP* and LAP function as transcriptional activators of the expression of immunosuppressive
  genes such as Arg-1, NOS2, NOX2, or COX2, whereas LIP attenuates function by blocking
  LAP and LAP* signaling. On the other hand, C/EBPβ affects the differentiation and
  expansion of MDSCs by regulating IL-6, CSFs, CSFRs, MMPs, or other factors.
