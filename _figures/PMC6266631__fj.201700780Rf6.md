caption: KDM5A function and its expression control in proliferating NPC and differentiating
  astrocyte. A) NPCs proliferate in the presence of EGF and FGF2. The growth factors
  activate MEK/ERK/MNK signaling pathway that facilitates the phosphorylation of eIF4E,
  resulting in translation of KDM5A in NPCs. High levels of KDM5A demethylate H3K4
  at transcription start site of Gfap promoter and repress astrocytogenesis and maintain
  cells as NPCs. B) CNTF induces astrocyte differentiation via JAK/STAT3 signaling
  in NPCs and inhibition of eIF4E mediated translation. During CNTF-induced astrocytogenesis,
  although Kdm5a transcription is up-regulated, its translation is reduced. In the
  absence of EGF and FGF2, ERK and MNK are no longer activated and subsequently eIF4E
  phosphorylation is reduced. The KDM5A translation is reduced and consequently, H3K4
  methylation retained on Gfap promoter promotes transcription of Gfap and results
  in astrocytogenesis from NPCs.

  and regulated by the translational machinery in neural progenitor cells.
