caption: 'Metabolic modules added to S. oneidensis to enable electrode-dependent conversion
  of glycerol to ethanol. The glycerol utilization module from E. coli (section outlined
  in green [top]) and the ethanol production module from Z. mobilis (blue section
  [bottom]) were combined with native metabolic pathways (red section [middle]) for
  stoichiometric non-redox-balanced conversion of glycerol to ethanol. Metabolic substrates,
  intermediates, and products are denoted in black. The genes from E. coli and Z. mobilis
  engineered into S. oneidensis are represented by the proteins that they encode:
  GlpF, glycerol transporter; GlpK, glycerol kinase; GlpD, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  Pdc, pyruvate decarboxylase; and AdhB, alcohol dehydrogenase. Phosphotransacetylase
  (Pta) is shown from native metabolism. Electrons not redox balanced within the cell
  are subsequently transferred through the Mtr pathway to the electrode. Yellow dots
  represent flavins secreted naturally from cells to accelerate extracellular transfer
  of electrons (e−) to the electrode.'
