caption: A working model for the roles of MKK6 in plant immunity. MKK6 functions in
  parallel with MKK1 and MKK2 to form a MAPK cascade to prevent activation of SUMM2-mediated
  immunity. MKK6 also functions together with ANP2/ANP3 and MPK4 in a separate MAPK
  cascade that inhibits a PAD4-dependent defense pathway. Arrows indicate activation
  and dashed lines with perpendicular lines indicate repression.
