caption: Pathway of S1P synthesis and influence on cDC migration. S1P is synthesized
  through the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, a major sphingolipid in the plasma membrane,
  into ceramide. Ceramide is then metabolized by ceramidase into sphingosine, which
  is subsequently phosphorylated by SphK1/2 to produce S1P. S1P can be exported from
  cells via membrane transporters and acts through G-protein-coupled receptors, S1PR1-5.
  When S1P binds to S1PR1 on immune cells (such as T cells, B cells, and cDCs) residing
  in LNs, it promotes their exit from the LNs by overriding retention signals mediated
  by CCR7. This process involves S1P-driven migration of these cells through efferent
  lymphatics into the thoracic duct, ultimately reaching the bloodstream. Notably,
  cDC2s, but not cDC1s, migrate out of the LNs. This difference is likely due to variations
  in CCR7 expression, with cDC1s exhibiting higher CCR7 levels, leading to their retention
  in the LNs. In situations where CCR7 is not strongly upregulated on tissue cDCs,
  S1P/S1PR interactions may also facilitate the migration of cDCs from peripheral
  tissues to dLNs. Figure created with Biorender
