caption: Different nutrients and metabolic pathways are supporting the nesting of
  metastasizing cancer cells in the lung (part a), lymph node (part b), peritoneum
  (part c) and brain (part d). In the lung, breast cancer cells take up extracellular
  pyruvate via monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) to generate α-ketoglutarate (αKG)
  from glutamate to activate the enzyme collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4HA), which
  is essential for extracellular matrix deposition and remodelling (part a). Uptake
  of glutamine via ASCT2 is important for the growth of prostate cancer cells and
  their metastatic seeding to the lung (part a). Elevated fatty acid metabolism is
  associated with a higher propensity of several cancer cell types to metastasize.
  Inhibition of CD36 and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), which both import fatty
  acids into the cell, as well as inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN) to block
  de novo fatty acid synthesis has been shown to restrain lung metastases (part a).
  In lymph nodes, melanoma and breast cancer cells undergo a metabolic shift towards
  fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Transcriptional co-activator yes-associated protein
  (YAP) is selectively activated in lymph node metastatic tumours, leading to the
  upregulation of genes in the FAO signalling pathway (part b). In the peritoneum,
  visceral adipocytes promote ovarian cancer progression and metastases in the peritoneal
  cavity by providing fatty acids and increasing CD36 expression in cancer cells (part
  c). Salt inducible kinase 2 (SIK2)-mediated ACC and SIK2 phosphorylation and overexpression
  promote fatty acid oxidation required for effective metastasis formation (part c).
  In the brain, acetate was discovered as an alternative energy source to glucose
  for human and mouse brain glioblastoma and lung and breast cancer-derived brain
  metastases (part d). As the brain exhibits low serine levels, inhibiting serine
  production by genetic phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) silencing or PH-755
  treatment in mice impairs breast cancer-derived brain metastases. *The metabolism
  of monounsaturated fatty acids can have a pro-metastatic or anti-metastatic function
  (part a). Fatty acid metabolism is depicted in light indigo. Lactate and pyruvate
  metabolism are depicted in green. Glutamine metabolism is depicted in dark indigo.
