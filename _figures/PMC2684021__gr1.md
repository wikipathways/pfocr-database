caption: Schematic representation of the fungal cell wall and downstream cellular
  responses following engagement of Dectin-1 and TLRs on antigen presenting cells
  (APC). At the top, the interaction between the yeast cell of a fungus, such as C.
  albicans, is shown as well as the general architecture of the fungal cell wall,
  consisting of overlapping layers of highly mannosylated proteins, beta glucans (structure
  within the insert to the right) and chitin. Antigen presenting cells (APCs), including
  monocytes, macrophages and DCs, engage fungi and activate host responses via several
  PRRs including the Toll-like receptors (TLR) and Dectin-1. Dectin-1 is alternatively
  spliced into two functional isoforms, which differ by the presence or absence of
  a stalk region (shown in dark blue). Dectin-1 recognises linear or branched 1,3-linked
  β-glucan, which triggers intracellular signalling through at least two pathways,
  involving Syk kinase and Raf-1, inducing the production of several cytokines, including
  IL-10, TNF, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-23. TLRs, on the contrary, which recognise various
  mannosylated and other fungal cell wall structures, signal through the MyD88-Mal
  mediated NF-κB pathway and induce the production of both pro and anti-inflammatory
  cytokines, including TNF, IL-10, IL-12 and TGFβ. Co-stimulation of both receptors
  can amplify the production of cytokines, including TNF, IL-23, IL-10 and IL-6 while
  downregulating the production IL-12, influencing the resultant generation of adaptive
  immunity.

    Dectin-1 is alternatively spliced into two functional isoforms, which differ by
