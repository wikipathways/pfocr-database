caption: 'The intact Fas–FasL-mediated apoptosis pathway is shown. Elevated levels
  of the soluble form of Fas or FasL contribute to apoptotic resistance in leukemic
  LGLs by acting as receptor or ligand decoys. MMP inhibitors are proposed for therapeutic
  intervention. Other contributing signaling pathways that are essential in LGL leukemia
  pathogenesis include the signals that are mediated by IL-15, PDGF and NF-κB. IL-15
  promotes LGL survival either by activating the JAK–STAT3 signaling pathway to upregulate
  gene expression of antiapoptotic factor or by targeting Bid to the proteasome for
  degradation. IL-15 signaling can be inhibited by a Mikβ1 monoclonal antibody targeting
  the IL-15R. PDGF functions through PI3K–Akt and Ras–MEK1–ERK signaling cascades,
  leading to cell proliferation and growth. PDGF signaling can be inhibited by RTK
  inhibitors such as imatinib. PI3K–Akt signaling can be blocked by using pan-PI3K
  inhibitors. Ras–MEK1–ERK signaling can be targeted using farnesyltransferase inhibitors
  to prevent farnesylation of Ras or by using MEK1 inhibitors such as PD98059 and
  U0216. NF-κB complex upregulates the transcription of survival genes resulting in
  survival of leukemic LGLs. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, can be used to prevent
  NF-κB signaling. FasL: Fas ligand; IκB: Inhibitor of NF-κB; IKK: IκB kinase; IL-15R:
  IL-15 receptor; LGL: Large granular lymphocyte; MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase; RTK:
  Receptor tyrosine kinase.'
