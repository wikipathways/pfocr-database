caption: (A) Domain structure of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I). RIG-I belongs
  to the DExD/H-box family of helicases and is comprised of helicase domains 1 (Hel1)
  and 2 (Hel2) with a Hel2i insertion, N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment
  domains, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) or repressor domain. RIG-I CTD is responsible
  for recognizing a plethora of RNA viruses with short 5′ triphosphate (5′ppp) RNA
  and 5′-diphosphate-bearing RNA structures. RIG-I also detects 5′ppp RNA species
  synthesized through the transcription of viral DNA by RNA polymerase III. (B) The
  cytoplasmic pattern-recognition receptor RIG-I is essential for recognizing RNA
  viruses with a 5′ppp signature. Upon viral RNA recognition, RIG-I recruits the adaptor
  protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein to activate the TBK1–IKKϵ complex
  and IKKα–IKKβ complex, which are responsible for the activation of transcription
  factors interferon regulator factor (IRF) 3, IRF7, and nuclear factor-κB. These
  transcription factors then translocate to the nucleus and coordinate the induction
  of type I interferons (IFNs). This is followed by the binding of the IFNs α and
  β to their cognate receptor, which will lead to the transcriptional activation of
  interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The products
  of ISGs are key factors in limiting pathogen spreading.
