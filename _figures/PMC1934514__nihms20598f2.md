caption: A schematic drawing outlining the main signaling pathways activated in response
  to ligand engagement with the GLP-1R and their major downstream effects on acute
  insulin secretion, insulin synthesis, preservation of β cell function and mass and
  regulation of proliferation. Pathways are glucose dependent hence the inclusion
  of glucose metabolism. GLP-1/Ex-4 bind to GLP-1R causing an increase in cAMP ();
  this leads to activation of both PKA () and EPAC (). Localized low concentrations
  of cAMP lead to preferential activation of PKA. Higher cell-wide increases of cAMP
  by the AC stimulator forskolin (FSK) or the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor IBMX
  favor the EPAC pathway. cAMP is compartmentalized by PDEs most notably the PDE3B
  isoform as shown (). PKA anchoring proteins (AKAPs) influence the specificity of
  cAMP response by anchoring the PKA to specific intracellular sites (). Shown here
  also is the Ca2+/calmodulin binding protein IQGAP1 which co-immunoprecipitates with
  PKA and AKAP79 (). cAMP levels are increased as a consequence of ATP activation
  of AC consequent upon glucose metabolism. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory units
  of PKA results in release of the catalytic units from PKA and its activation. Sustained
  oscillatory increases in cAMP by GLP-1R activation lead to translocation of PKA
  to the nucleus (; ) where it regulates PDX-1 () and CREB activation and subsequently
  insulin transcription (; ; ). Downstream targets of PKA and Epac in acute insulin
  secretion, include the KATP and Kv channels, the insulin secretory vesicles and
  the IP3 Ca2+ channels on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). P38 MAPK, although activated
  by GLP-1R agonists (; ) is not included as the exact mechanism of activation has
  not been described. Activation of the MEK/ERK pathway is coordinated through both
  the Epac moieties and the Ca2+/calmodulin kinases (; ). The effect of PKA on CREB
  mediated induction of the IRS2 gene is shown, this is a prolonged effect of GLP-1R
  activation (). Acutely PI3 kinase is also stimulated by transactivation of the EGF
  receptor by cSrc-activated betacellulin (BTC; ). Downstream of PI3 kinase are PKB
  and PKCζ both of which are implicated in β cell proliferation and PKB in prevention
  of β cell death (; ). FoxO1 is regulated by phosphorylation by PKB which results
  in its exclusion from the nucleus thus permitting the nuclear translocation of PDX-1
  (). Finally enhanced ATP production due to increased mobilization of Ca2+ which
  in turn upregulate mitochondrial dehydrogenases leads to upregulation of mTOR activity
  and its downstream effector S6K1 (). mTOR is implicated in increased β cell mitosis
  and may also be activated by PKB. GLP-1R activation also leads to stabilization
  of the insulin transcript by stimulating nucleocytoplasmic translocation of polypyrimidine
  tract binding protein (PTB) which binds to the U-rich polypyrimidine tract of insulin
  and insulin secretory vesicle mRNA transcripts thereby stabilizing them (). Mechanisms
  that have not been clearly demonstrated are shown by broken arrows.
