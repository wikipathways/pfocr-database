caption: Folate-Mediated One-Carbon Metabolism (FOCM). This figure illustrates both
  the folate and methionine interdependent cycles and supports the importance of the
  methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as well as demonstrating the importance
  of the essential B vitamins. Importantly, note that methionine and tetrahydrofolate
  (THF) are derived primarily through dietary intake to supply the methionine and
  folate cycles and that the enzyme methionine synthase (MS) and its essential cofactor
  vitamin B12 are placed in a central position of the interconnected folate and methionine
  cycles. FOCM comprises a network of interconnected folate-dependent metabolic pathways
  responsible for serine and glycine interconversion, de novo purine synthesis, de
  novo thymidylate synthesis and homocysteine remethylation to methionine as well
  as providing antioxidant defense via glutathione (GSH) production via the transsulfuration
  pathway. Note that the encircled methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme
  plays and important role in the folate cycle. The most common genetic variant in
  MTHFR gene to date is the 677C > T polymorphism, which results in elevated levels
  of Hcy especially if there is deficient folate. Once Hcy is synthesized through
  multiple steps in the methionine cycle, it may then undergo remethylation to methionine
  or be eliminated through the transsulfuration pathway. Additionally, thymidylate
  synthase (TYMS) converts deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate
  (dTMP) (not shown) in a 5,10-methylene-THF-dependent reaction. Importantly, cystathionine
  beta synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma lyase (CSE-CGL) do not only contribute
  to generate GSH (antioxidant) in the transsulfuration pathway but also are important
  for endothelial cell generation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a known gaso-transmitter
  and vasodilator. Elevation of Hcy from the methionine cycle may result in hyperhomocysteinemia,
  which is an independent risk factor for cerebro-cardiovascular diseases, accelerated
  atherosclerosis, thromboembolism, hypoxemia and stroke. CBS = cystathionine-beta-synthase;
  GCS = glutamate cysteine ligase (gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase); GS = glutathione
  synthase; GSH = glutathione; MTHFR = methylenetetrahydrofolate; MS = methionine
  synthase; THF = tetrahydrofolate.
