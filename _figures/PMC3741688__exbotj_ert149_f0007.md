caption: Schematic representation of the proposed compensatory and synergistic modes
  of NIA/NR/NOA1-dependent NO production and HY1 expression in salt-tolerance signalling
  pathway. The relay of short-term signalling and long-term salt adaptation was mediated
  by unknown mechanisms/factors (question mark). The ZAT10/12-mediated antioxidant
  defence might be involved in the overlapping. The mutation of NIA/NR/NOA1 or HY1
  was accompanied with the compensated upregulation of HY1 expression or NIA/NR/NOA1-associated
  NO production. However, the short-term compensatory mode followed by the downregulation
  of antioxidant defence system (cAPX1/2 and FSD1, etc.) was not sufficient for long-term
  salt tolerance. Hypersensitivity and corresponding parameters could be partially
  reversed by NO- (in particular) or CO-releasing compounds, a synergistic mode. In
  the NO/CO-deficient quadruple mutant, the application of NO- (in particular) or
  CO-releasing compounds could differentially trigger ZAT10/12-mediated long-term
  antioxidant defence, thus leading to the salt-tolerance phenotype.
