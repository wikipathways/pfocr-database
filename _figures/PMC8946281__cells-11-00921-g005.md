caption: 'Biosynthetic and endocytic traffic routes to vacuoles/lysosomes. The color
  code of each arrow corresponds to that of the vesicle type involved. Traffic pathways
  are as follows. Blue, COPII mediated: BFA-sensitive ER to GC; anterograde intra
  GC cisternae; BFA insensitive ER to MVBs. Gray, COPI mediated: BFA sensitive GC
  to ER; retrograde intra GC cisternae. Wine, clathrin mediated: AP1-, AP3-, AP4-,
  GGA-mediated TGN to MVBs (plant cells) or TGN to EEs (animal cells); AP3-mediated
  GC to VAC (plant cells); AP2-mediated PM to TGN (plant cells) or EEs (animal cells).
  Notice that the TGN in plant cells also plays the role of animal EEs. Green, secretory
  vesicles: GC to TGN; TGN to PM. The TGN to MVBs/LEs indirect pathway could involve
  secretory vesicles from TGN to PM, followed by a possible AP2-mediated clathrin-coated
  vesicle internalization from PM to MVBs/LEs. Pink, retromer vesicles: MVBs/LE to
  TGN. Yellow: AP5-mediated traffic involved in maintaining lysosome integrity. Its
  exact role has to be elucidated, both in animals and plants. Violet: MVBs/LEs to
  VAC/LYS. Notice that this pathway seems to be a direct fusion event that does not
  require specific vesicles or coats. Abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GC,
  Golgi complex; TGN, trans-Golgi network; EEs, early endosomes; MVBs/LEs, multivesicular
  bodies/late endosomes; VAC/LYS, vacuole/lysosome; PM, plasma membrane; AP, adaptor
  protein complex; GGA, GGA adaptor-related proteins; BFA, Brefeldin A.'
