caption: Mechanisms of endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells. (A) Mechanisms
  of tamoxifen (TAM) resistance may involve the loss of oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha
  expression, which can be achieved by methylation of CpG islands or histone deacetylase
  activity in the ESR1 promoter. Tamoxifen‐resistant growth is also stimulated by
  the upregulation of growth factor signalling pathways (HER2, IGF‐IR and FGFR) and
  subsequent activation of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade or
  phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K) pathway. Finally, tamoxifen has even been shown
  to stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells when bound to certain coactivators,
  such as AIB1, and this is especially true in HER2‐expressing cells. (B) The mechanisms
  of aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance share similarities with tamoxifen resistance,
  especially in terms of growth factor pathway upregulation. The enhanced activity
  of growth factors such as MAPK can result in oestrogen‐independent phosphorylation
  and activation of ERα. In addition to growth factor signalling, interferon response
  genes and anti‐apoptotic proteins have also been shown to have increased expression
  in AI‐resistant cells. AIB1, amplified in breast cancer 1; FGFR1, fibroblast growth
  factor receptor 1; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; IGFR1, insulin‐like
  growth factor receptor 1. Reprinted from []. Copyright © 2015 Breast Cancer Research
