caption: The architecture of INDRA consists of three layers of modules (1–3). In layer
  (1), interfaces collect mechanisms from natural language processing systems (e.g.,
  TRIPS Interface) and pathway databases (e.g., Pathway Commons Interface) and Processors
  (e.g., TRIPS Processor, BioPAX Processor) extract INDRA Statements from their outputs.
  Statements, the internal representation in INDRA, constitute layer (2). In layer
  (3), INDRA Statements are assembled into various model formats by Assembler modules
  (e.g., PySB Assembler, Graph Assembler).A Python script is used to assemble and
  simulate a model from the text “MEK1 phosphorylates ERK2 at threonine 185 and tyrosine
  187”. The process_text method of INDRA's TRIPS Processor is called to send the text
  to the TRIPS NLP system (1) and then process the output of TRIPS to construct INDRA
  Statements (2). Then, a PySB Assembler is constructed, the Statements are added
  to it, and an executable model is assembled using the PySB Assembler's make_model
  method with a “two‐step” policy (3). Finally, the model is simulated for 300 s using
  PySB's odesolve function.User input, INDRA modules, and external tools form a sequence
  of events to turn a natural language sentence into a model and simulation. The natural
  language description from the user is passed to INDRA's TRIPS Interface, which sends
  the text to TRIPS (1). The TRIPS system processes the text and creates an Extraction
  Knowledge Base graph (Results column; yellow box). INDRA receives the results from
  TRIPS and constructs two INDRA Statements from it, one for each phosphorylation
  event (Results column), which are returned to the user (2). The user then instantiates
  a PySB Assembler and instructs it to assemble an executable model (3) from the given
  INDRA Statements (a schematic biochemical reaction network shown in Results column).
  Finally, the user calls an ODE solver via PySB's odesolve function to simulate the
  model for 300 s (simulation output shown in Results column).
