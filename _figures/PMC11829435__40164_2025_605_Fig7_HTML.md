caption: Proposed model showing the mechanism of combined HDAC and FLT3 inhibition.
  In FLT3-ITD/TKD AML cells, HDACi (IHCH9033) and FLT3i (quizartinib) synergistically
  inhibit FLT3 and DNA repair pathways, impairing the cellular DNA damage response,
  triggering cell apoptosis, and resulting in tumor regression in FLT3-ITD/TKD AML
  xenografts, as well as nearly complete eradication of AML burden in patients-derived
  xenografts. Created in https://BioRender.com

  and rescues quizartinib resistance in FLT3-ITD AML via enhancing DNA damage response
