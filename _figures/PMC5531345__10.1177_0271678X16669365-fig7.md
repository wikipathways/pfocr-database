caption: Scheme of the pathway mediating the VEGF-induced disassembly of adherence
  junctions and its regulation by NDPK-B. As reported by Gavard and Gutkind, the activation
  of the VEGFR-2 in ECs induces c-Src activation, which triggers a signaling cascade
  finally leading to the phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, its internalization and thus
  opening of AJs. Our data show that the phosphorylation of Cav-1 by c-Src in caveolae
  is essential for the functionality of this pathway. From our findings, NDPK-B ensures
  a correct Cav-1 transport to the plasma membrane, caveolae formation and VEGF-induced
  Cav-1 phosphorylation.
