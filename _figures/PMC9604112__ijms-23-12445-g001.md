caption: 'Pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). The dysbiosis of gut
  microbiota is a cause of exacerbation of the disease and determines the severity
  of the mucous inflammation. It causes the imbalance in the integrity of epithelium
  barrier and promotes infection of, i.e., C. jejuni, S. typhi, enteroadherent or
  serotypes enteroinvasive of E. coli (EIEC). By stimulating membrane Toll-like receptors
  (TLR) and intracellular NOD receptors (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
  proteins, NOD1, NOD2) in immune cells, including antigen-presenting ones (APCs),
  the cytokine pathway of the cellular immune response and tissue secondary remodeling
  is activated. The important role is played by Th17 lymphocytes derived from naive
  Th0 lymphocytes under control of IL23 and IL12. The cytokine mediated signal transmission
  through JAKSTAT pathway ultimately activates Th17 cells, which are the source of
  several pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL17A, IL17F, IL22, IL26, and the chemokine
  CCL20. In addition, the IL-10 affects the activity of Th17 lymphocytes inhibition
  which are donors of IL17, IL23, IL6. As well as the IL10 has the ability to inhibit
  the APCs by reducing the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and
  to control another level of adaptive immune answer. The IL17, IL23, IL6 and TGF-β,
  INF-γ are involved in the recruitment of neutrophils in inflamed tissue and in the
  activation of mesenchymal cells that play a major role in fibrosis in IBD.'
