caption: A modular gradient-sensing network. (A) Molecular view of the chemotaxis
  network. The linear path from input to output begins with the input ligand concentration,
  [L], being sensed by the membrane-associated receptor–kinase complex, A, to regulate
  its autophosphorylation-activity, a. A then transfers phosphate to the response
  regulator, CheY (Y), the phosphorylated form of which (Y-P) interacts with the flagellar
  motor (M), to control swimming behavior. The feedback loop is closed by the methyltransferase
  CheR (R) and the methylesterase/deamidase CheB (B), by regulation of the receptor
  methylation level, m. CheZ (Z), the phosphatase for CheY-P, decreases the signal
  lifetime, thus accelerating the response of the pathway. (B) Modular view of the
  network. Focusing on the functional modules, rather than the variables, of the network
  yields this block diagram, in which the variables are viewed as inputs or outputs
  (represented along wires) of two discrete signal processing modules (represented
  as boxes). The input–output relation of the receptor module is described by the
  function G, which takes [L] and m as inputs to produce an output a, which connects
  to the downstream linear pathway toward motor output. The adaptation module constitutes
  the feedback loop of the network, in which the output a is converted through F(a)
  to dm/dt and integrated over time.
