caption: Figure depicts the autophagy regulators in regard to lung injury. Various
  conditions like hypoxia, starvation, environmental stress and cigarette smoke leads
  to autophagy that in turn causes lung injury. Activation of Class I-PI3K/mTOR pathway
  takes place under hypoxic and starvation conditions. While environmental stress
  results in provoking Beclin 1/Vps34 pathway that induces the sequestration of the
  phagophore formation. Cigarette smoke induces ROS accumulation which in turn causes
  EGR-1 & E2F signalling to activate LC3-II along with SQTM1/p62 and ATG5/12 conjugation
  system. The ROS generated may also leads to apoptosis. The autophagosome fuses with
  lysosomes and forms autophagolysosome that causes pulmonary arterial hypertension
  and lung injury.
