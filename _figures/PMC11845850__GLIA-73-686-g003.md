caption: 'The possible impacts of microglial depletion using CSF‐1R inhibitors on
  neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The inhibition of the CSF1 signaling pathway
  by CSF‐1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors leads to the depletion of up to 99% of microglia.
  The depletion of these cells could prove to be deleterious on other cell types in
  the CNS through the arrest of key homeostatic and neurodevelopmental functions of
  these cells or through the rupture of homeostasis the accumulation of microglia
  debris could cause. Moreover, CSF‐1R is expressed by NPCs, where its signaling is
  important to their differentiation and proliferation. Finally, like other tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors, the specificity of PLX3397, PL5622, and GW2580 is not directed
  towards the active site of the CSF‐1R but rather towards the intracellular tyrosine
  kinase domains. These molecules could therefore show inhibitory capabilities on
  other tyrosine kinase receptors such as PDGFRα, a receptor involved in the differentiation
  of OPCs. Abbreviations: NPC, neural progenitor cell; OPC, oligodendrocyte progenitor
  cell'
