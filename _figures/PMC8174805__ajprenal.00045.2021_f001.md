caption: 'Retinoic acid (RA) metabolism and signaling. A: vitamin A obtained from
  diet is metabolized into β-carotene, which is absorbed by intestinal epithelial
  cells and esterified into retinyl esters by the enzyme lecithin retinol acyltransferase
  (LRAT). B: retinyl esters are carried together with chylomicrons in the bloodstream;
  they are then captured by hepatocytes and hydrolyzed into retinol. C: retinol binds
  to retinol-binding protein (RBP) in the bloodstream and transported into the cytosol
  via the stimulated by retinoic acid 6 (STRA6) receptor. D: in the cytosol, RA is
  generated from retinol by two sequential reactions. Retinol is first oxidized into
  retinal by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and then retinal is oxidized by the enzyme
  retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH) to generate RA. E: the function of RA depends on the
  type of RBP that RA binds. If the fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5)/cellular
  retinol-binding protein II (CRABPII) ratio is low, RA binds mostly to CRABPII, which
  delivers it to the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) complex
  to regulate the transcription of target genes (proapoptotic genes) by binding to
  retinoic acid-responsive element (RAREs). When the FABP5-to-CRABPII ratio is high,
  all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) binds mostly to FABP5, which targets RA to other
  receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ, activating mostly
  survival genes. F: the retinol-RBP4 complex is filtered by the kidneys and is reabsorbed
  in proximal tubule cells by the megalin-mediated pathway. CYP, cytochrome P-450.
  PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor.'
