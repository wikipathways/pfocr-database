caption: NFATc1 plays a central role in regulating the expression of downstream genes
  and proteins, including CTSK, MMP9, DCstamp, integrin β3, ATP6v0d2, and ACP5. The
  NF-κB signaling pathway bridges between RANK-RANKL activation and NFATc1 expression.
  ArcyA downregulated (arrows pointing down) the gene encoding RANK and inhibited
  the NF-κB signaling pathway. This was mediated in part by a downregulation of IκB
  degradation. In addition, ArcyA reduced the expressions of cFos and NFATc1, thereby
  suppressing the downstream genes involved in OC formation and resorption. The molecular
  structure was generated using the InDraw software V6 (https://www.integle.com/static/indraw;
