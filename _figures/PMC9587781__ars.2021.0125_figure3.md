caption: 'NLRP3 inflammasome signaling via complement. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
  requires a priming signal and an assembly signal. Signal 1: The priming signal is
  induced by PAMP/DAMP recognition by pattern recognition receptors (e.g., TLRs) and
  pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α) and promotes nuclear translocation of NF-κB,
  with subsequent NLRP3 and IL-1B gene transcription. Signal 2 promotes the assembly
  of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 complexes to form an active NLRP3 inflammasome, where
  active caspase-1 processes proIL-1β/proIL-18 into mature IL-1β/IL-18. Complement
  components C1q and C5aR1 potentiate Signal 1. C5aR1 act as a priming signal to sustain
  inflammasome activation during the uptake of DAMPs, using a mechanism that involves
  lysosomal damage and release of cathepsin B. Direct activation of C5aR1 promotes
  Signal 2 for NLRP3 inflammasome activation via changes to mitochondrial metabolism
  and ROS production. C3aR is believed to regulate ATP efflux via P2X7 engagement,
  and sublytic MAC formation enhances intracellular Ca2+. Figure adapted from Arbore
  and Kemper (). ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase
