caption: 'mTOR transcriptional activity. Maternal PRKAA1 SNP rs1345778 genotype was
  associated with the transcriptional activity of 12 genes belonging to the mTOR pathway
  as defined by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). A: transcripts
  that differed during the 3rd trimester in women with TT vs. GG/GT PRKAA1 SNP rs1345778
  genotypes as white rectangles, those that did not differ as shaded rectangles, and
  functional pathways implicated as rectangles with rounded corners. Specifically,
  PIK3R3, EIF4EBP1, RHEB, PDPK1, RRAGA, RRAGB transcripts were downregulated, and
  PIK3CB, PRKAA2, IGF1R, RPS6, VEGFA, PRKCG transcripts were upregulated in women
  with TT vs. GG/GT rs1345778 genotypes using a nominal P value of <0.05; the hypergeometric
  probability for 12 genes in the mTOR pathway being differentially expressed is P
  = 0.002. B: the Affymetrix probe set ID, fold change, direction of change, average
  expression value, t score, and P value for transcriptional differences for each
  mTOR pathway gene. The combined P value for transcriptional differences between
  maternal TT vs. GG/GT rs1345778 genotypes after accounting for the observed correlation
  among genes is 7.51e-09.'
