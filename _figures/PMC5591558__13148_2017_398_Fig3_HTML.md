caption: EGFR cell signaling and lncRNAs relationship in lung cancer therapy resistance.
  The binding of the EGF ligand to the EGFR receptor causes the autophosphorylation
  of the tyrosine residues located in the terminal COOH-domain, allowing the activation
  of multiple downstream signaling cascades through the recruitment of signaling proteins
  to the intracellular portion of the receptor including Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt,
  JAK/STAT and PLC, which ultimately drive to proliferation, survival, and/or tumor
  cell invasion. Growth factor-stimulated "IGF-1R" also induces the activation of
  AKT and ERK signaling pathways. Likewise, the probable participation of lncRNAs
  along the EGFR cell signaling pathway has been indicated, as a new likely lncRNAs
  therapy targets in lung cancer
