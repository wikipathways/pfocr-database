caption: Summary of the suggested mechanism for the regulation of MMPs and TIMPs in
  the paracrine interplay between SCC-25 cells and fibroblasts. MMP-9 showed a tumor
  specific expression, regulated presumably by the fibronectin ITGA5B6 pathway. The
  ITGA5 was inducible in both SCC-25 and PDL fibroblasts in co-culture, but ITGB6
  expression was tumor (SCC-25) specific. Based on a previous report , MMP-9 might
  be activated in interaction with CD-44, and according to our gelatinase assay results,
  it remains bound with the tumor cells (A). The results of this study suggest that
  MMP-2 is secreted in its pro- (inactive-) form by CAFs surrounding the tumor cells,
  and at a lower extent also by the tumor cells themselves. Activation of MMP-2 either
  requires MT1-MMP localized on the SCC-25 cancer cells , or integrins, where the
  involvement of αv integrins (ITGA5) is expected (A).MMPs-1, -3 and TIMPs-1, -3 are
  produced in the PDL fibroblasts, and their expression might be regulated by inflammatory
  cytokines, including IL1-β produced by SCC-25 cells. The gene expression of MMP-1,
  MMP-2, TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 was reduced by dexamethasone (DEX) (B).
