caption: 'Stimulation of the IL-33/ST2 system might activate a cardioprotective programme
  in the context of ventricular biomechanical stress, and a number of approaches could
  be taken to modulate IL-33/ST2 signalling to capitalize on this cardioprotective
  activity. The IL-33 system may be activated by exogenous administration of IL-33
  or by promoting IL-33 release from resident cardiac fibroblasts. Alternatively,
  availability of IL-33 to its receptor complex could be increased by inhibiting the
  IL-33 decoy receptor soluble ST2 (sST2). The system could also be activated by pharmacotherapeutics
  designed to directly stimulate the IL-33 receptor. Intracellular targeting may also
  be possible: Sequestration of the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) by exogenous
  compounds might mimic the cardioprotective effects of IL-33 administration. If further
  clarity could be obtained regarding the nature and means by which IL-33 modulates
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity, or with regard to the contribution of NF-κB-independent
  effects (such as direct stimulation of adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) or extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) to overall cardioprotection, these may also prove
  to be points along the IL-33 signalling cascade that are amenable to manipulation.
  Precisely how the nuclear and non-nuclear effects of IL-33 result in downstream
  cardioprotection is unclear. Further study into these processes could help identify
  novel methods of cardioprotection. Due to the involvement of the IL-33/ST2 system
  in a variety of processes, activation of this pathway may have unintended consequences.
  The involvement of IL-33 in Th2-mediated inflammation suggests that such a strategy
  might result in exacerbation of arthritic, asthmatic, rheumatologic and gastrointestinal
  inflammatory conditions. Conversely, inhibition of the IL-33/ST2 system to modulate
  these inflammatory conditions could result in increased cardiovascular injury in
  the face of ventricular strain. Care must be taken if the IL-33/ST2 system is to
  be manipulated for potential clinical gain.'
