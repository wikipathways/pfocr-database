caption: Proposed signaling pathways of H2S during angiogenesis. H2S activates Akt
  signaling pathways and simultaneously enhances vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) production and VEGFR2 phosphorylation, leading to downstream Akt activation.
  H2S also exerts angiogenic effects through activation of ATP-sensitive potassium
  channels (KATP channels), which in turn facilitate activation of MAPK (ERK1/2 and
  p38) pathways, leading to new blood vessel formation. VEGF may activate CSE activity
  and H2S release that contributes to VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis-related properties
  of endothelial cells. H2S promotes VEGF synthesis and angiogenesis by inducing matrix
  metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, while it suppresses MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase
  (TIMP)-3 levels, thus inhibiting anti-angiogenic factors. (To see this illustration
