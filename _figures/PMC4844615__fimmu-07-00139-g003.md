caption: Pathogens-induced TLR signaling cascade in innate immune cells may exacerbate
  autoimmune diseases. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binds to TLR4 and peptidoglycans bind
  to TLR2, which initiates signaling by recruiting the adaptor proteins myeloid differentiation
  primary response protein 88 (MYD88), the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP),
  TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-β (TRIF), and TRIF-related adaptor
  molecule (TRAM). MYD88 associates with IL-1R-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and IRAK4
  and recruits TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). This complex recruits TGFβ-activated
  kinase 1 (TAK1), leading to phosphorylation of NF-κB inhibitor (IκB), activation
  of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and consequent transcription of a range of genes coding
  for proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6
  (IL-6), pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18. In addition, TLR agonists activate the interferon
  regulatory factor (IRF) pathways, leading to the production of IL-12p35 and type
  I IFNs. TLR-induced activation of TAK1 also results in phosphorylation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK). Phosphorylation of ERK promotes the transcription of the gene encoding IL-23p19
  and subsequent IL-23 synthesis. Phosphorylation of p38 activates cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB), leading to IL-10 production. IL-1β activates its own receptor, which
  also signals via the same TLR pathway components to produce IL-1β. Adapted from
  Ref. ().
