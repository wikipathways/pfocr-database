caption: Solute carrier (SLC) expression is associated with cell death. (A) Inhibition
  of PTGR2 suppresses the expression of the SLC7A11/SLC3A2 complex (system Xc−), resulting
  in the activation of ROS‐dependent apoptosis. The suppression of SLC7A11 (xCT) also
  induces ferroptosis via lipid ROS production. (B) Cyt‐C, which is released as a
  result of mitochondrial damage caused by Bax and Bak, binds to Apaf1 to activate
  the caspase‐9/caspase‐3/caspase‐7/PARP pathway and induce cell apoptosis. Overexpression
  of SLC39A4 increases zinc levels and represses the expression of Bax and Bak, subsequently
  conferring cell apoptosis resistance. Conversely, the use of TPEN to reduce zinc
  levels induces apoptosis by inhibiting the antiapoptotic genes Bcl‐2, Bcl‐W, and
  Bcl‐XL. Paradoxically, the use of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) to increase
  zinc levels also induces apoptosis through ROS‐induced mitochondrial damage mediated
  apoptosis‐inducing factor (AIF), resulting in cell apoptosis instead of caspase
  pathway activation. (C) The inhibition of SLC31A1 to block copper absorption leads
  to the suppression of pancreatic cancer progression by increasing ROS‐induced autophagy,
  which also promotes the resistance to cell apoptosis. (E) Blockade of SLC6A14 induces
  tumor cell autophagy
