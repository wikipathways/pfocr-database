caption: Brief schematic representation of how oxidative stress, inflammation, and
  cancer development may be correlated. After the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inflammatory
  activation pathway in a macrophage cell, secretory lysosomes () secrete or degrade
  inflammatory cytokines in regulating cytokines released by immune cells through
  a feedback mechanism. Phosphorylation of NF-κB activates several enzymes, e.g.,
  cyclooxygenase(COX-2), oxidase, and iNOS, thus inducing the release of prostaglandins
  (PGE2), O2•− and other molecules like anti-apoptotic factors, cell cycle regulators,
  adhesion molecules that are likely to be related to tumorogenesis, cancer cell growth
  and proliferation. The unbalanced increase of the former may lead to tumorogenesis
  and (among other events) cancer growth and proliferation.
