caption: Overview of the Notch pathway in Drosophila. The Notch pathway is a paracrine
  communication pathway involving Delta (red), the transmembrane ligand expressed
  and localized at the plasma membrane of the so-called signal-emitting cell, depicted
  in red. Delta interacts in trans with the Notch receptor (blue), localized at the
  plasma membrane of the signal-receiving cell, depicted in blue. Following ligand
  binding, Notch undergoes two successive proteolytic cleavages. The first cleavage
  at S2 is ligand-induced and generates an activated membrane form of Notch, which
  is then processed at S3 by the γ-secretase complex. This leads to the release of
  NICD, its translocation into the nucleus, and association with the transcriptional
  co-activator Mastermind and the DNA-binding transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless
  (Su(H)), resulting in transcriptional activation
