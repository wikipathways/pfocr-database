caption: 'All of the composite HLA-D haplotypes within the risk clade (highlighted
  in red) contain eQTL variants reported to impact 72 genes in the publicly available
  eQTL datasets utilized in this study. The patterns of increased or decreased transcription
  associated with all of these haplotypes is modeled on the left, with red indicating
  increased expression and green indicating decreased expression relative to the protective
  haplotypes shaded in blue. All of the HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP class II molecules,
  along with a variety of gene products involved in the APP pathway are upregulated
  in all SLE risk haplotypes. A variety of other genes in the immune system, including
  some with known associations with SLE susceptibility (C2, C4A) are also modulated.DOI:
