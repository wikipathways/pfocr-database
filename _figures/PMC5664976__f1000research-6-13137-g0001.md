caption: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sequesters ER resident chaperone binding
  immunoglobulin protein (BiP) away from luminal domain of PERK, leading to PERK activation.
  Activated PERK contains lipid kinase activity and converts diacylglycerol to phosphatidic
  acid (PA). PA is instrumental in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex formation.
  mTOR activation can inhibit insulin receptor substrates via phosphorylation and
  block PI3K-Akt activation. Alternatively, mTOR complex can activate Akt and downstream
  pathways via phosphorylation. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-dependent
  expression of SESTRIN2 and regulated IRE1-dependent decay 1 (RIDD1) can indirectly
  suppresses mTOR activity (indirect regulation illustrated by dashed lines). Akt-mediated
  downstream signaling pathways can have both pro-survival and pro-death impacts on
  cell fate. mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; PERK, protein kinase RNA-like
  endoplasmic reticulum kinase.
