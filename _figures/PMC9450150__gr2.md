caption: GPR35 surface expression and project overview.A, sequence alignment of the
  variable, N-terminal regions of GPR35 short and long. B, comparison of receptor
  expression of both GPR35 isoforms at the surface of HEK293 cells. Data shown present
  mean ± s.e.m. of four independent experiments. Statistical significance was tested
  using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison; p < 0.05. ∗∗∗p < 0.001;
  ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001. The negative control (pcDNA transfection) was normalized to 0, and
  the expression of GPR35 short was set to 1.0 for each individual experiment. C,
  overview of the employed GPR35 ligands and intracellular signaling pathways monitored
  in the present study. The signaling components highlighted in red were detected
  in living cells using different optical biosensors. HEK293, human embryonic kidney
  293A.
