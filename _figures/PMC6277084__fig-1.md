caption: Putative relationship between changes in tryptophan catabolism and de novo
  NAD+synthesis in ADC neuropathology. Immune-activated oxidative l-tryptophan catabolism
  can contribute positively to the maintenance of cell viability through increased
  metabolism of NAD+ in astrocytes and mononuclear phagocytes. However, chronic activation
  of this pathway may also enhance neuronal excitotoxicity through the production
  of QUIN and possibly 3-HK. 3-HK, 3-hydroxykynurenine; ADC, AIDS dementia complex;
