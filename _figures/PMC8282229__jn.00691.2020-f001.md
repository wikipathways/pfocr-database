caption: 'Working model of sAIH-induced pLTF. pLTF can be regulated by Gq (5-HT2A/B)
  or Gs (A2A) protein-coupled metabotropic receptors (the Q and S pathways, respectively).
  Following severe AIH, we hypothesize that activation of A2A receptors activates
  adenyl cyclase (AC) and cAMP, with subsequent activation of EPAC, PI3K/Akt, mTORC,
  and iTrkB. Activation of EPAC drives PI3K activation, phosphorylating Akt to cause
  pLTF. In contrast, following moderate AIH, both 5-HT2 isoforms are activated, with
  5-HT2A receptor activation increasing MEK/ERK activity. Both 5-HT2 isoforms then
  utilize downstream signaling via BDNF, TrkB and PKCθ, although this convergence
  has not been verified. We further hypothesized that the S pathway is constrained
  by NADPH oxidase (NOX), whereas the Q pathway is constrained by PKA activity. We
  intrathecally delivered the inhibitors to key enzymes in this working cellular model,
  including: 1) ESI-05 (targeting EPAC), 2) PI828 (targeting PI3K/Akt), 3) KT-5720
  (targeting PKA), 4) UO126 (targeting MEK/ERK), and 5) apocynin (targeting NADPH
  oxidase). AIH, acute intermittent hypoxia; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
  EPAC, exchange protein activated by cyclic AMP; mTORC, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  PI3K/Akt, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt; pLTF, phrenic long-term facilitation;
  sAIH, severe AIH.'
