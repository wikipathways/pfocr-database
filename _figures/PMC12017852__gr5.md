caption: The signaling pathways of RGS12 in tumor. (i) RGS12 negatively regulates
  the level and activity of AKT protein to inhibit the expression of MNX1. (ii) RGS12
  interacts with PTEN through the PDZ domain, up-regulating phosphorylation and sumoylation
  of PTEN, thereby inactivating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and suppressing OSCC
  growth. (iii) RGS12 enhances the phosphorylation of MYCBP2 to degrade the ciliary
  protein KIF2A. (iv) RGS12 binds to YAP and inhibits the nuclear translocation of
  YAP and the expression of Ezrin. RGS12, regulator of G protein signaling 12; AKT,
  protein kinase B; MNX1, motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tension homolog; PDZ, PSD-95/Discs large/ZO-1 homology; mTOR, mammalian target
  of rapamycin; OSCC, oral squamous cell carcinoma; MYCBP2, Myc-binding protein 2;
  KIF2A, kinase family member 2A; YAP, Yes-associated protein. This figure was drawn
