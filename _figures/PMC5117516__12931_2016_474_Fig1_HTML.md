caption: Viral sensing pathways that trigger host immune responses. PRR signalling
  is triggered by viral proteins and nucleic acids (PAMPs) and host-derived DAMPs.
  All TLRs except TLR3 signal through the adapter molecule Myd88. TLR3 signals through
  TRIF, and TLR4 signals via both Myd88- and TRIF-dependant pathways. RIGI, MDA5 and
  NOD2 signal through the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein MAVS (or IPS1).
  These signalling pathways converge on IRF3/IRF7 and NFkB to activate their respective
  type I/III interferons and proinflammatory gene programs. Type I (IFN-α, IFN-β)
  and III interferons (IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, IFN-λ3 or IL-29, IL-28A, IL-28B) bind to distinct
  receptor complexes, which activates STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation. IRF9 binds
  to STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers forming the ISGF3 complex, which translocates to the
  nucleus to induce transcription of ISGs that contain ISRE elements in their promoters.
  Type II interferon signalling activates STAT1, which translocates to the nucleus
  to induce transcription of ISGs containing GAS elements in their promoters. Some
  proinflammatory cytokines (pro-IL-1B, pro-IL-18) are produced in an inactive form.
  The processing of these cytokines into their bioactive form is mediated by Capase-1,
  which is activated by the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway
