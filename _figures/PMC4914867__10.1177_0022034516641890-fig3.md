caption: This figure describes the molecular pathways involved in microbiota-host
  interactions and the development of oral mucositis. The detection of microbial components
  (PAMPs) and endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs and HMGB1) by
  pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors triggers a cascade of
  cellular signals, resulting in activation of NF-κB (among other pathways) that contribute
  to amplify proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis. The use of probiotic bacteria
  has the ability to activate pathways that are involved in the reduction of inflammatory
  signaling and apoptosis through the downregulation of the innate immune response
  of the epithelial cells by way of inactivation of the NF-κB pathway. DAMP, damage-associated
  molecular pattern; HMGB1, high-mobility group box-1; IL, interleukin; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor-κB; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.
