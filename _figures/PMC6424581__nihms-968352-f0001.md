caption: Panel A. Trabectedin is metabolized by Cyp3a and both parent and metabolites
  are substrates for P-gp, Mrp2 and Mrp3. Pretreatment with dexamethasone, a CYP3a
  inducer, reduced hepatotoxicity, suggesting that CYP3A was protective. Hepatoprotection
  from trabectedin-mediated cytotoxicity in rat sandwich-cultured hepatocytes by dexamethasone
  treatment was attributed to enhanced metabolism and biliary excretion due to protein
  induction of Cyp3a and Mrp2, respectively, although the anti-inflammatory effect
  of dexamethasone could have contributed to the effect as well (). Panel B. In Mdr1a/1b/Mrp2−/−
  mice, hepatotoxicity was severe, with liver transaminase levels >100-fold relative
  to the wild-type treated mice (). This finding suggested that transporters are pivotal
  in protecting the cell by removing hepatotoxicant(s). Panel C. Only mild hepatotoxicity
  was observed in Cyp3a/Mdr1a/1b/Mrp2−/− mice, highlighting the importance of Cyp3a-generated
  metabolites as hepatotoxicants and not trabectedin itself. Loss-of-function of two
  transporters (e.g., Mrp2 and Mrp3; P-gp and Mrp2) caused severe hepatotoxicity,
  whereas the loss of one efflux pathway only produced a modest insult ().
