caption: Fungal induction of necroptosis. Canonical necroptosis occurs through the
  recognition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). In the absence
  of caspase-8, receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIPK)-1 is allowed
  to phosphorylate RIPK3 which in turn phosphorylates mixed-lineage kinase domain-like
  (MLKL). Phosphorylated MLKL oligomerizes and translocates to the cell membrane forming
  pores leading to lytic death, and therefore, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP). Necroptosis can be induced in response
  to fungi through recognition by the main fungal pattern recognition receptor dectin-1.
  In this pathway, caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) downstream
  of dectin-1 interacts with RIPK1, allowing it to phosphorylate RIPK3 and in turn
  the phosphorylation of MLKL, leading to necroptotic death through the specific recognition
  of fungi. Of note, germination of phagocytosed A. fumigatus conidia can lead to
  calcineurin-dependent lateral transfer from the infected macrophage undergoing necroptosis
  to a healthy macrophage to aid in fungal control, a process termed metaforosis.
