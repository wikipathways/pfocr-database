caption: The alteration of gene networks is caused by the ionizing radiation. The
  gene networking of the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed the gene networks
  in response to the ionizing radiation in (A) female reproductive cells and (B) male
  reproductive cells. Red color represented upregulated genes and green color represented
  downregulated genes. The purple arrow showed the direct transcriptional regulation.
