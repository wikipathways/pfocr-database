caption: 'Mitochondrial apoptotic pathway involving p53 and ceramide in response to
  stress: Ceramide activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) which dephosphorylates
  Bcl-2 and inhibits its antiapoptotic activity. Ceramide generated in the endoplasmic
  reticulum translocates to the mitochondria. Additionally, another pool of ceramide
  can be generated in the mitochondria. On the other hand, nuclear p53 activates the
  transcription of proapoptotic genes (Puma, Noxa, Bax and Bak). Bak elevates the
  activity of ceramide synthase in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Mitochondrial
  ceramides form large stable barrel-like channels either alone or with Bax. These
  channels are used to release cytochrome c to the cytoplasm resulting in activation
  of caspases and execution of apoptosis. Cytoplasmic p53 interacts with Bcl-xL in
  the mitochondria preventing it from disassembling ceramide and Bax channels. Puma
  and Noxa bind to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins freeing Bax and/or Bak from
  them. Noxa is also involved in the mitochondrial p53 and ceramide-dependent apoptosis
  but the specific pathway is still unclear.'
