caption: 'Metabolic and morphologic engineering of E. coli strains for polylactic
  acid production. Exogenous vectors expressed the genes of key enzymes which are
  involved in the biosynthesis pathway of polylactic acid. The gene of ackA was deleted
  in the engineered strains to reduce the competitive by-product of acetic acid. The
  gene of sulA was expressed in engineered stains for larger cell space. Full names
  of abbreviations are as follows: PLA, polylactic acid; PhaC, PHA synthase; PCT,
  propionyl-CoA transferase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; Glu, glucose; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PYR, pyruvate; Ac-CoA, acetyl co-enzyme A; AA, acetic acid; LA, lactic acid.'
