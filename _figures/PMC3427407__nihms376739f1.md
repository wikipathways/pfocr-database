caption: Aβ oligomers stimulate oxidative/nitrosative pathways involving NMDA receptor,
  nNOS and NADPH oxidase leading to production of ROS and activation of cPLA2. cPLA2
  has multiple actions; besides the release of AA and synthesis of eicosanoids, it
  can also produce DHA and lysoPL. These products have been shown to disturb mitochondrial
  function and modulate ROS production by NADPH oxidase. Dotted arrows are pathways
  not yet clarified. Note that besides the NO/cGMP/PKG pathway, many proteins in these
  pathways can undergo post-translational modifications through S-nitrosylation.
