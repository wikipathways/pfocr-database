caption: Models for GSH degradation in animals and plants. The solid lines are experimentally
  confirmed pathways, and the dashed lines are proposed pathways. A, The γ-glutamyl
  cycle as proposed for animals. GSH is degraded in the extracellular space by GGT,
  and the constituent amino acids are transported back to the cytoplasm to resynthesize
  GSH. The GSH hydrolase activity of GGT predominates over the transpeptidase reaction.
  B, GSH metabolism proposed in Arabidopsis. GSH degradation occurs in the cytoplasm
  by GGC, with only minor GGT involvement in total GSH turnover. Roles of the GGTs
  are limited to the extracellular space, such as the degradation of oxidized GSH
  (GSSG) by GGT1 in the apoplast and the degradation of GSH conjugates by GGT4 in
  the vacuole.
