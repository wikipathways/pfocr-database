caption: 'Graphical model illustrating the complex roles of Cytokinin Response Factors
  (CRFs) in the trade-off between abiotic stress response and plant developmental
  processes. Coloured boxes highlight the role of specific CRFs in stress responses
  (yellow box), CK/IAA hormonal crosstalk (light blue and pink boxes) and senescence
  (green box). The blue box focuses on the involvement of CRFs in cytokinin homeostasis
  and signalling. The pink box depicts the regulation of auxin transport exerted by
  CRFs. Lastly, the green box emphasizes the trade-offs between photosynthesis and
  senescence regulated by CRFs. This model provides a comprehensive view of the multifaceted
  roles of CRFs in integrating endogenous and exogenous signals to regulate plant
  development. YELLOW BOX: Under various stress conditions, specific CRFs are transcriptionally
  regulated and have a role in regulating the specific stress response (Table 1).
  OS is a common outcome of various abiotic stress responses. During OS response,
  ANAC017 is released from the mitochondrial membrane and binds to the promoters of
  CRF5 and CRF6, activating their transcription. ANAC017 also interacts with PIF4
  at the protein level, showing a diurnal expression pattern, and repressing circadian
  regulators LHY and CCA1. CRF5 is also involved in pathogen resistance. LIGHT BLUE
  BOX: CKs are perceived by membrane-localized histidine kinase receptors (CHKs) and
  are transduced through histidine phosphotransferase proteins (HPTs) to activate
  response regulators (RRs) in the nucleus (Kieber and Schaller, 2014). Type-A RRs
  act as negative regulators of CKs signalling whereas type-B RRs act as transcription
  factors and are positive regulators in this pathway. CRF5 represses UGT76C2, responsible
  for cytokinin N-glucosylation, and CRF6 represses genes responsible for CK signalling
  (ARR6, ARR9, ARR11), biosynthesis (LOG7), and transport (ABCG14). The CRFs exhibit
  protein-level interactions with HPT, among themselves in various combinations, and
  with specific RRs, providing contextual flexibility and response specificity to
  the CK signalling pathway. CRFs 2, 5, and 6 are transcriptionally activated by CKs
  in a manner dependent on AHK receptors and specific RRs (ARR1 and ARR12). PINK BOX:
  AtCRF2 and AtCRF6 positively regulate PIN1 and PIN7, while AtCRF3 acts as a negative
  regulator. AtCRF2 is also auxin-responsive, downstream of MONOPTEROS/ARF5, and participates
  in root embryogenesis and shoot formation together with SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM).
  CRF2, 3 and 6 are positive regulators of ovule density, pistil length, and placenta
  length. CRF9 is a negative regulator of silique and seed development and shoot apical
  meristem floral transition. CRFs are involved also in other auxin-regulated processes
  such as hypocotyl elongation and vascular patterning. GREEN BOX: CRF2 is under the
  epigenetic control of SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex. CRF2 is a positive
  senescence regulator, PDV2 is downstream of CRF2 and promotes chloroplast division.
  CRF6 positively regulates photosynthetic activity and delays senescence by repressing
  ARR6, a negative regulator of chlorophyll retention. Conversely, crf1/3/5 knockout
  lines show reduced expression of the senescence regulator SAG12, increased expression
  of the photosynthesis regulator CAB1, and an early onset of senescence'
