caption: The developmental stages plotted in relation to time, are indicated as bipotential
  when both sexes are indistinguishable from one another (except for their karyotype),
  sex determination as the decision determined by several factors to develop into
  a male or a female gonad, and sex differentiation, the step determining the actual
  sexually dimorphic phenotype. In blue, the male and in pink the female factors.
  The framed factors were found to be related to human disease. Solid lines between
  CBX2 and its targets indicate a direct interaction (binding of CBX2 on target's
  DNA sequences). Green arrows indicate stimulatory effects of CBX2 on the indicated
  target; the red “t” indicates inhibitory effects. Broken lines indicate a functional
  but not physical interaction (changes in expression without direct binding). A black
  solid line indicates direct binding of CBX2 on the target without any effect on
  expression. Because all these effects were abolished when the mutated CBX2 was tested,
  the hypothesized role of CBX2 as both a stimulator of male and inhibitor of female
  pathway might help to explain the apparent presence of ovarian tissue in the gonads
  of our CBX2 46, XY patient ().
