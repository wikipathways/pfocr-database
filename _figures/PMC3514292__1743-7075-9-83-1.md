caption: A schematic representation depicting A; the protein synthesis pathway in
  skeletal muscle involving the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).
  Insulin, and amino acids (including leucine) initiate activation of a cascade of
  protein and lipid kinases ultimately resulting in enhanced mTOR activity, facilitating
  the phosphorylation of S6K1 and hyper-phosphorylation of 4E-BP, resulting in enhanced
  availability of eIF4E for binding eIF4G and forming an active eIF4F complex resulting
  in increased protein synthesis [adapted from Layman [], Anthony et al.[], Drummond
  et al.[], Um et al.[] and Kimball [,] and B; our proposed mechanism whereby high
  protein calorie restricted weight loss increases IGF-1 activating the PI3K/Akt pathway,
  thereby phosphorylating (P) FoxO transcription factors and down-regulating the expression
  of E3 enzymes atrogin-1 and MuRF-1, leading to a reduction in protein degradation
  in skeletal muscle cells. PGC-1α, SIRT1 and AMPK are also proposed to inhibit the
  expression of FoxO transcription factors and therefore suppress protein breakdown
  [adapted from Lecker et al.[], Bodine et al.[], Anthony et al.[] and Blagosklonny
  et al.[]. Dashed lines indicate an interaction with an unknown mechanism. Red lines
  indicate an inhibitory signal to the pathway, and C; Summarisation of protein biosynthetic
  and degradation events following standard protein, high carbohydrate compared to
  high protein, calorie restricted weight loss.
