caption: 'aGVHD (acute GVHD) pathogenesis and treatment. Phase I: GVHD initiation.
  Pretransplantation conditioning causes barrier integrity loss, gut lumen pathogen-associated
  molecular pattern (PAMP) translocation, and dying host cell release of damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate host antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Host
  mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells produce IL-17A, which prevents intestinal
  dysbiosis. Activated APCs secrete IL-12, inducing host type 1 innate lymphoid cells
  (ILC1s) and T cells to release IFN-γ, which upregulates MHC-II on nonprofessional
  APCs (epithelial and stromal cells). APC activation is suppressed by IL-13-producing
  ILC2s, or by regulatory T cells (Tregs) utilizing secreted (IL-10) or contact-dependent
  (CTLA4, granzyme B, CD39) mechanisms, and modified by Siglec G-CD24 pathway agonists
  (e.g., CD24-Fc) or IL-12 inhibition (ustekinumab). Histone deacetylase inhibitor
  vorinostat and α−1-antitrypsin inhibit PAMP/DAMP-induced APC proinflammatory cytokine
  production and costimulation. Phase II: Donor T cell priming. Donor T cell activation
  follows interaction with recipient hematopoietic APCs [e.g. dendritic cells (DCs)]
  or nonhematopoietic APCs activated during phase I. Reconstituting donor CD103+ DCs
  migrate to draining lymph nodes, where they further prime donor T cells. Abatacept
  (CTLA4-Ig) disrupts Tcell:APC costimulation to inhibit aGVHD. Alloreactive donor
  T cell expansion is curtailed by early posttransplantation cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy).
  Phase III: effector responses. Primed T cells differentiate to type 1 T helper (Th1)/type
  1 CD8+ T (Tc1) or Th17/Tc17 cells, directed by IL-12 or IL-6, respectively, and
  are susceptible to the Jak1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, IL-12/23p40 (ustekinumab),
  or IL-6R (tocilizumab) blocking monoclonal antibodies. Th1/Tc1 cells secrete IFN-γ,
  which is intestinal stem cell cytotoxic, while augmenting the negative regulatory
  indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and PD-L1/PD-L2 pathways to restrain aGVHD. Th17/Tc17
  cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines that mediate tissue pathology both directly
  and by recruitment of secondary effectors [e.g., neutrophils, Mφs (macrophages)].
  IL-22-secreting ILC3s or exogenous IL-22 supplementation support intestinal stem
  cell regeneration. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) suppress T effector
  functions via an arginase-1-dependent mechanism. Tregs [supported by IL-4-producing
  natural killer T (NKT) cells and regulatory DC cells (DCregs)] and regulatory type
  1 T cells exert multiple pathways to control T effector cells. Abbreviations: cGVHD,
  chronic GVHD; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; Tfh, T follicular
  helper; Tr1, regulatory type 1 T cell. Figure adapted'
