caption: Two hypotheses may be arisen in regards to the non-antioxidant protective
  role of α-tocopherol against the action of preclinical and clinical protein kinase
  inhibitors. The vitamin may either act outside the cells by preventing the different
  drugs to enter within the cell (extracellular effects) or inside by blocking the
  signalling pathway leading to death (intracellular effect). In the first case, we
  could imagine that α-tocopherol directly binds to the cytotoxic compounds or change
  the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane to render it impermeable to this kind
  of inhibitors. In the second case, α-tocopherol would either directly act on (i)
  the kinase inhibitor, (ii) their targets or (iii) a common signalling partner engaged
  upon kinase inhibitors treatment and supposedly leading to death ( = “x” protein).
