caption: DEGs involved in plant hormone signaling pathway summary of the maize plant
  response under fertilization. A Auxin (B), Cytokinin (C), Gibberellin (D) Abscisic
  acid, (E) Ethylene, (F) Brassinosteroid (G) Jasmonic acid, and (H) Salicylic acid
  signaling pathway. The absolute values of log2 ≥ 1 and FDR < 0.001 were used as
  the criteria for DEGs. The colour of the box had key enzymes, it also represents
  up (yellow) and down (green)-regulated genes, and the value in the box is the log2
  of the genes in the ear leaf under fertilization
