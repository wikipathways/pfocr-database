  treatment. The increase of [Ca2+]cty in response to receptor-mediated agonists or
  increased shear stress results in activation of NOS in ECs. Activated NOS converts
  L-arginine in the presence of oxygen to NO and L-citrulline. These processes also
  require BH4. NO released from ECs diffuses into PASMCs and binds to its intracellular
  receptor sGC, which produces cGMP from GTP. The increase in intracellular cGMP concentration
  results in activation of PKG. Activation of PKG leads to the decrease of [Ca2+]cty
  and relaxation of smooth muscle via several mechanisms. cGMP are also determined
  by activity of type PDE5. There are several therapeutic strategies for targeting
  NO signaling in PAH including increasing NO formation or direct inhalation of NO,
  stimulating sGC activation, and preventing the breakdown of cGMP. Compounds, such
  as L-arinine, S-(2-boronoethly)-l-cysteine, L-citrulline, statins, polyphenols,
  Nebivolol, and BH4 can increase substrates or NOS activation leading to increase
  of NO formation. NO inhalation can also enhance NO signaling. Therapeutics also
  takes advantage of enhancing NO downstream pathways including stimulators or activators
  of sGC such as Riociguat and PED5 inhibitors, such as Sildenafil and Tadalafil.
