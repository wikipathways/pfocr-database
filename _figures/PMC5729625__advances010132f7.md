caption: Schematic representation of the proposed signaling mechanisms involved in
  HNE-induced TF decryption. Oxidative stress causes lipid peroxidation and produces
  reactive aldehydes, such as HNE. HNE induces ROS generation in mitochondria, and
  ROS increase PS levels in the outer leaflet. Increased PS levels at the outer leaflet
  contribute to TF decryption. At present, the mechanism by which ROS increase PS
  levels is unknown. HNE, in addition to generating ROS, also inactivates the TrxR/Trx
  system by inhibiting its activity or forming adducts. Inhibition of Trx leads to
  dissociation of the Trx–ASK-1 complex, leading to ASK-1 activation. ASK-1 activation
  promotes the activation of MKK3/MKK6 and the upstream activation of p38 MAPK. p38
  MAPK activation leads to inhibition of flippase activity and a resultant increase
  in PS levels at the outer leaflet, which contributes to TF activation. HNE-induced
  TF decryption can be inhibited using specific inhibitors that target different steps
  in the HNE-induced signaling pathway.
