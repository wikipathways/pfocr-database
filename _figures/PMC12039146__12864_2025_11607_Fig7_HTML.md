caption: A schematic diagram of lipid metabolism and its crosstalk with other metabolism
  pathways. The blue boxes represent lipid metabolism-related pathways; the red boxes
  represent the crosstalk signal pathway; the yellow boxes refer to metabolites in
  various signaling pathways; and the green boxes represent the enzymes (ACY, Acyl-CoA
  Synthetase; MCD, Malonyl-CoA Decarboxylase; ACC, Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase). Genes
  implicated in various signaling pathways were shown in italics. By Figdraw
