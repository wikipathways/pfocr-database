caption: Schematic representation of the human 42 Kb INK4-ARF (CDKN2A/B) locus (not
  to scale) and its participation in two pathways controlling cell-cycling and differentiation.
  Two pathway branches leading to tumor suppression originate from the locus, influencing
  E2F1 transcription factor availability (large blue arrow) and the p53 protein stability
  (large red arrow). Suppressive chromatin states and/or DNA methylation (red Xs)
  can silence gene expression from the locus. Expression of p16 and p15 is controlled
  by a collection of activating and repressive transcription factors (not shown).
  When expressed, p16 and p15 bind to cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6) which
  inhibits their phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB)
  (small bule arrows). Hypophosphorylation of pRB and its homologues (p107, p130)
  due to lack of cyclin-dependent kinase activity allows them to sequester E2F1 transcription
  factor and prevent its transport to the nucleus, where it would otherwise activate
  a battery of genes involved in cell proliferation and stem cell renewal. Expression
  of p14/ARF inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 (mouse double minute
  2) thereby stabilizing p53 transcription factor, resulting in up-regulated expression
  of its target genes promoting apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation. One p21 inhibitor
  of CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) which targets pRB. One important cross connection
  between the two branches is indicated, operating through the cyclin-dependent kinase
  inhibitor, p21/CIP1/WAF1. Normal inhibitory interactions between components within
  the two pathways are indicated by black Xs. Not indicated are many other interconnections
  between the two signaling circuits that provide both complexity and redundancy to
  the pathways, a topic covered more thoroughly by references provided herein.
