caption: A model of infectious tolerance that depends on a nutrient depleted microenvironment
  maintained by Treg cells within tissues. This model proposes that immunological
  tolerance is maintained within tissues by the localized depletion of nutrients,
  particularly the essential amino acids (EAA), which are required for the proliferation
  and effector function of conventional T cells (Tconv). Amino acid depletion is primarily
  as a result of regulatory T cells (Treg) inducing (1), in dendritic cells (DC) and
  macrophages (Mϕ), a range of enzymes that catabolize (2) or utilize EAA (examples
  are shown). This lack of EAA is sensed via the mTOR pathway which, in the presence
  of TGFβ, encourages the expression of FOXP3, and the induction of further Treg (3).
  Under conditions of tolerance the intact vasculature maintains a barrier between
  the blood and the tissues, but if there is inflammation or damage to the vasculature,
  causing edema, then EAA can leak into the tissues (4) and contribute to a breaking
  of the tolerant microenvironment.
