caption: Figure 1. Diagrammatic representation of transcription regulation in response
  to IFN stimulation. (A) Binding of type I or type III IFN to their cognate receptors
  initiates a signaling cascade that results in phosphorylation and heterodimerization
  of STAT1 and STAT2 and association with IRF9 to form the active transcription factor
  complex ISGF3. (B) STAT1 and STAT2 primarily associate to form ISGF3, but have also
  been reported to form other transcription factor complexes in response to IFN stimulation.
  These include AAF/GAF, U-STAT1, a STAT2/IRF9 complex, and ISGF3II. AAF/GAF has been
  widely reported to form in response to IFNα stimulation but the other complexes
  are less well understood. Accumulation of U-STAT1 has been shown to regulate ISG
  transcription; however, the structure and composition of the active transcription
  factor are not yet known. A STAT2/IRF9 complex has been reported to be transcriptionally
  active when overexpressed and ISGF3II has been identified in a single cell line.
  (C) ISGF3, the canonical transcription factor, regulates the transcription of many
  ISGs. However, the co-regulators necessary for gene expression vary from gene to
  gene. Three ISGs, ISG54, 9–27, and ISG15, are depicted here along with their gene-specific
  co-regulators as examples of the differential regulation in the IFN pathway.
