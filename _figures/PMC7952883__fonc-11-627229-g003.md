caption: 'General mechanisms of sildenafil in different types of cancer. The different
  types of cancer are highlighted in colors. Breast cancer (light blue). Three mechanisms
  may decrease tumor progression: Combined therapy sildenafil + DOX, estrogen reduction
  by aromatase blockage or decrease secretion of CXCL16 in fibroblasts with sildenafil
  or tadalafil. Tadalafil can block tumor growth and promote apoptosis. The same effect
  is caused by combined therapy sildenafil + sulindac sulfide through PKG activation.
  Sildenafil can promote PKD2 degradation and decrease proliferation and viability,
  and enhance antitumoral effects of cisplatin. Leukemia (dark green). Sildenafil
  + EGCG promote activity of acid sphingomyelinase increasing apoptosis. Lung cancer
  (light green). Sildenafil may decrease tumor growth through cGMP and enhance cytotoxicity
  of carboplatin to promote apoptosis. Combined therapy of sildenafil + radiotherapy
  reduces activity of MSCS and promotes immune response of CD8+T cells. Colon cancer
  (yellow). Sildenafil prevents inflammation of intestinal epithelium decreasing the
  risk of cancer. Combined therapy sildenafil + curcumin, enhance efficacy of 5-fluorouracil
  to promote apoptosis. Combination of neratinib, regorafenib and sildenafil affects
  mutant KRAS expression to increase sensitivity of cancer cells to immunotherapies
  through MHCA. Prostate cancer (orange). Blocking ABC transporters. Sildenafil disrupted
  the efflux of chemotherapeutics promoting their activity. Sildenafil can promote
  caspase activity and ROS to produce apoptosis and sensitize hypoxic cancer cells
  to chemotherapeutics through NO/cGMP pathway restoring. Brain cancer (deep blue).
  Sildenafil + DOX, improves survival of cancer patients.'
