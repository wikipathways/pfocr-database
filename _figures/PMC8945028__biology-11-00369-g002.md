caption: A simplified view of pathways for repairing Meiotic Chromosomal Double-Strand
  Breaks (DSB) and their modulation by altering key regulatory genes. Meiotic recombination
  is initiated within the mother cells of microspores and megaspores by the self-induction
  during the prophase of the first division of meiosis of several hundreds of DNA
  DSBs by the SPO11 complex. Occurrence DSBs trigger the pairing of homologous chromosomes
  (blue and red bars). In the current model of DSB-associated DNA synthesis, the CO
  formation pathway proceeds mainly in repairing the DSB by homologous recombination
  using an intact chromatid of the paired homologous chromosome as a template. This
  pathway is initiated by the invasion of the 3′ end of a single end of the DSB which
  initiates DNA synthesis on the homologous DNA molecule. The capture of the second
  end of the double-stranded break facilitates further synthesis using the 3′ end
  on the other side of the break. A specific joint molecule structure linking the
  4 strands of the 2 homologous chromosomes, the double Holliday junction (dHJ) is
  formed. The resolution of this structure usually leads to a reciprocal exchange
  of large DNA segments between two chromatids of the homologous chromosomes, the
  cross-over. This major pathway (class I) accounting for 90% of CO formation is called
  the ZMM (ZIP1-4, MSH4/5, and MER3) pathway. Other repair pathways pass through a
  variety of recombination intermediates that may mature in a minority way (10% in
  Arabidopsis) in so-called class II COs through MUS81 but mainly form non-COs, which
  can lead to gene conversions. Neosynthesized DNA appears in pink.
