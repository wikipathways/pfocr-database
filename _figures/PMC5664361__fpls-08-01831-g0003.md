caption: KEGG pathway map of the diterpenoid biosynthesis pathway (map 00904). All
  enzymes performing the steps of the linear main pathway (highlighted green) were
  found present in at least 19 plant species. By contrast, the orange-highlighted
  pathway branches were found present in only one or two species each, and the dark-red
  highlighted branch was found present in 13 species. Permission to reproduce this
  pathway map image was kindly granted by the KEGG curators.
