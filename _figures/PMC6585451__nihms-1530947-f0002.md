caption: Members of the gut mycobiota, such as C. albicans and S. cerevisiae, are
  protective against systemic bacterial and fungal infections via trained immunity
  and/or activation of adaptive Th17 immunity. Fungal cell wall constituents such
  as b-glucan and chitin can enhance aerobic glycolysis in monocytes through the activation
  of dectin-1/ AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α pathway, leading to pro-inflammatory cytokines production,
  such as IL-6 and CSF1. In addition, S. cerevisiae derived mannans can initiate systemic
  protection against DSS induced intestinal inflammation in mice in the absence of
  commensal bacteria. Thus, mycobiota mediated trained immunity provides systemic
  immune-protection against systemic infection with bacterial and fungal pathogens.
  Gut commensal C. albicans also provides protection against systemic C. albicans,
  A. fumigatus and S. aureus by priming adaptive Th17 mediated-immune responses.
