caption: Organophosphonate utilization pathways are enriched in low P soils. (A) The
  core C-P lyase pathway and detection of particular components across both data sets.
  We note that phnP was not classified under phosphorus metabolism in the SEED subsystems,
  so we did not test for responsiveness to P availability; however, we did detect
  phnP in both data sets. (B) The phosphonotase pathway and detection of components
  across both data sets. For all gene categories, red indicates that a category is
  significantly enriched in low P soils. Squares and circles refer to detection in
  the Australian and Panamanian soils, respectively.
