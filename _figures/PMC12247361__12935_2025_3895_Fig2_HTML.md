caption: miR-1303 regulates cancer progression through targeting multiple genes across
  distinct cancer types. In prostate cancer, miR-1303 downregulates DKK3, relieving
  inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby promoting tumor progression.
  In liver cancer, miR-1303 suppresses TLN1, leading to enhanced proliferation, migration,
  and invasion of cancer cells. In gastric cancer, miR-1303 targets CLDN18, reducing
  cell adhesion and increasing tumor invasiveness. In neuroblastoma, miR-1303 inhibits
  both GSK3β and SFRP1, facilitating cancer cell proliferation. This figure illustrates
  the oncogenic role of miR-1303 via its tissue-specific molecular targets
