caption: (A) center vs. margin comparison in SCC. Connective tissue disorders, post-translational
  modification, protein folding is presented together with HIF 1α signaling canonical
  pathway; (B) center vs. control comparison in SCC. Cell morphology, embryonic development,
  hair and skin development and function is presented together with glucocorticoid
  receptor signaling canonical pathway and (C) margin vs. control comparison in SCC.
  Cell morphology, embryonic development, hair and skin development and function is
  presented together with glucocorticoid receptor signaling canonical pathway.
