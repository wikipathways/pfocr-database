caption: 'TGF-β signaling. TGF-β signaling comprises two groups of a set of intracellular
  transduction pathway: SMADs signals and Non-SMADs signals. When the active TGF-β1
  binds to its cell surface type II receptor (TBR2), it induces the activation of
  TGF-β type I receptor (ALK5 or TBRI) and forms a heterotetrameric complex. (a) SMADs
  signals: active ALK5 in the complex phosphorylates SMAD2/3 which in turn promotes
  the SMADs release from complexes with SARA from the inner face of the plasmatic
  membrane. Phosphorylated SMADs interact with co-SMAD4 forming a heteromeric complex
  to be translocated into the cell nucleus, where, by interacting with other transcription
  factors and/or co-repressors or co-activators, they modulate gene expression. (b)
  Non-SMAD signals: active TGF-β receptors complex interacts with ubiquitin ligase
  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) which in turn recruits
  TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) to activate p38, JNK, and NFκB pathways. Additionally,
  TGF-β binding provokes the phosphorylation of ALK at tyrosine residues which enable
  the formation of Shc-Grb2/SoS complex to activate Ras-Raf1-MEK1,2-ERK1,2 signaling.
  On the other hand, receptor-activated complexes can activate PI3K provoking the
  activation of AKT and the small Rho GTPases. The activation of Non-SMAD signals
  pathways in turn initiates transcriptional or nontranscriptional activities to regulate
  cellular responses.'
