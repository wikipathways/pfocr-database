caption: a | Overview of inflammatory processes. At the early stages of atherosclerosis,
  activated platelets secrete chemokines (such as C-C motif chemokine 5 (CCL5)) that
  promote adhesion of monocytes and neutrophils. Neutrophils themselves secrete chemotactic
  granule proteins (including cathelicidin, cathepsin G and CCL2), thus paving the
  way for arterial monocyte infiltration. The chemokine milieu is supplemented by
  chemokines secreted by activated smooth muscle cells (SMCs), such as CCL2 and CCL5.
  In progressing atherosclerotic lesions, medial SMCs migrate towards the developing
  fibrous cap where they undergo clonal expansion. SMC lipid loading triggers phenotype
  switching towards SMCs that express α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA+ SMCs), macrophage-like
  SMCs and smooth muscle foam cells. Heightened lipid loading of SMCs induces SMC
  apoptosis and — if not cleared quickly — necrosis. SMCs also undergo cell death
  after interaction with histone H4 presented in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).
  NET-associated cytotoxicity is observed during plaque erosion when NETs released
  at sites of disturbed flow induce endothelial cell desquamation. In systemic infections
  with Gram-negative organisms, which produce lipopolysaccharide (LPS), NET-associated
  histones promote the adhesion of monocytes, hence contributing to accelerated plaque
  growth under these conditions. Monocyte-derived macrophages ingest modified lipids
  and, in response, secrete inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Excessive lipid
  uptake triggers macrophage proliferation or even cell death. b–d | Core inflammatory
  processes fuelled by SMCs (part b), macrophages (part c) and neutrophils (part d).
  b | Cholesterol uptake induces cell death in SMCs. SMC death, in turn, reduces the
  amount of extracellular matrix that is produced, which further fuels SMC death.
  Senescent SMCs release pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading enzymes,
  including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). c | Priming and activation of the NACHT,
  LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Priming by cholesterol
  crystals, modified lipids such as oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) or impaired
  cholesterol efflux triggers the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling pathway, promoting
  the transcription of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. Assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome induces
  activation of caspase 1, which cleaves pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β. d | Release
  of NETs is licensed by cholesterol crystals, LPS, modified lipids and chemokines
  such as CCL7. NETs exert cytotoxicity by means of NET-resident histones, prime the
  NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages and induce coagulation by cleavage of factor XII
  and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and by direct platelet activation.
