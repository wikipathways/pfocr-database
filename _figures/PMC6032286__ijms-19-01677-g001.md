caption: 'Schematic of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and the main molecules involved
  in congenital myasthenic syndromes. CMS result from presynaptic (ChAT, ChT, MUNC13-1,
  MYO9, PREPL, SYT2, VAChT, and VAMP1), synaptic basal lamina (COLQ and COL13A1),
  and postsynaptic defects (AChR subunits: α, β, δ and ε, AGRN, DOK7, MUSK, LRP4,
  and rapsyn). An increasing number of presynaptic CMS is being reported due to abnormalities
  in the synthesis, recycling or release of acetylcholine (normal arrows). The Agrin-LRP4-MuSK
  signaling pathway (bold arrows) is crucial for the clustering of the AChRs at the
  postsynaptic muscle membrane. Novel genes encoding for ubiquitous molecules (GFPT1,
  DPAGT1, ALG2, ALG14, and GMPPB) are represented in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  in a simplified view of the N-glycosylation pathway. Post-translational modifications
  of the saccharide structure of the AChR and other NMJ proteins take place at the
  ER and Golgi apparatus (dashed arrows), before reaching the muscle cell surface
  as mature proteins. ACh, acetylcholine; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; AcCoA, acetyl
  coenzyme A; Ch, choline; VGNa + C, voltage-gated sodium channel.'
