caption: Schematic representation of putative molecular mechanism by which different
  inflammatory stimuli regulate P4 withdrawal and myometrial activation. 20α‐HSD expression
  is up‐regulated in myometrium in response to 1) infection (LPS), which activates
  the NF‐кB transcription factor and mediates its nuclear translocation through phosphorylation
  and subsequent degradation of IκBα in TLR4/MyD88/TRAF‐dependent pathway, or 2) inflammatory
  stimuli (TPA), which mediate phosphorylation, activation and translocation of AP‐1
  factors via PKC/PI3K pathways. Up‐regulation of 20α‐HSD expression causes decrease
  of P4 levels and induces transcription of CAPs (such as GJA1/Cx43), resulting in
  enhanced myometrial cell connectivity through the formation of gap junction channels,
  activation of myometrium and labour onset. The inflammatory signals (LPS and TPA)
  generate a secondary response via secretion of multiple cytokines and chemokines
  by myometrial cells to elicit autocrine and paracrine positive feedback loop, thereby
  amplifying the inflammatory response. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 12‐O‐tetradecanoylphorbol‐13‐acetate
  (TPA), 20alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20α‐HSD), nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐кB),
  activator protein 1 (AP‐1), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (IкBα), Toll‐like
  receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88), tumour
  necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)–associated factor 6 (TRAF6), protein kinase C (PKC),
  phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K), progesterone (P4), contraction‐associated proteins
