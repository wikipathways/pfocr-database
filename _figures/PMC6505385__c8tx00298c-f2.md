caption: . Molecular mechanisms of arsenic-induced lung cancer. 1. The arsenic biotransformation
  consumes GSH, which indirectly increases the levels of ROS and RNS in the cells;
  2. During the transformation from MMA to DMA, the reaction of the arsenic species
  with the functional proteins also could directly cause the up-regulation of ROS
  and RNS; 3. The depletion of the methyl group donor SAM causes the endogenous gene
  and protein's epigenetic changes, such as global hypo-methylation, CpG islands hyper-methylation,
  and histone modification. 4. Numbers of microRNA have been reported to deregulate
  in arsenic-transformed cells as well. 5. Arsenic inhibits autophagy degradation,
  which caused the extra accumulation of dysfunctional proteins and complexes in the
  cells; 6. Arsenic exposure disrupts the chromosome structure and affects its stability,
  causes the DNA double-strands breakage directly or impairs DNA repair; 7. Long-term
  arsenic exposure dysregulates a series of signaling pathways, such as the EGFR pathway,
  NRF2 and Hedgehog Pathway, which lead to changes in the cell's survival, proliferation
  and differentiation.
