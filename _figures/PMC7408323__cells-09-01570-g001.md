caption: Diagram representing the role of mitochondrial mutations, near haploid genome
  and somatic mutations in Hürthle cell thyroid cancer development. Mitochondrial
  mutations, leading to the inactivation of complex I of the respiratory chain, are
  associated with the decreased OXPHOS and increased glycolysis. Near haploid genome,
  associated with the inactivation of several tumor suppressors, leads to the overactivation
  of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, enhancing cell proliferation and glycolysis.
  Somatic mutations in nuclear DNA are associated with abnormal protein translation,
  overactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways and altered
  cytoskeleton, leading to enhanced proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and metastatic
  potential.
