caption: Proposed S clerotinia sclerotiorum eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) involved
  in response to nutrients and environmental stresses. Kinases are shown in ovals
  and named according to the most closely related S accharomyces cerevisiae orthologue.
  Colours indicate ePK groups as in Fig. . Full lines indicate established kinase
  reactions, whereas proposed reactions are indicated by ‘?’. Non‐kinase pathway components
  are shown in boxes with interactions indicated by broken lines.
