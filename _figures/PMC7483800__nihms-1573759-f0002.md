caption: A. SARM1 contains an auto-inhibitory N-terminus, two tandem SAM domains and
  a C-terminal TIR domain. B. The crystal structure of SARM1’s SAM domains, which
  form an octomer (Image of PDB ID:6QWV[], created with EzMol[]). The side-view shows
  that the tandem SAM domains form two stacking rings in the octomer. C. A schematic
  of SARM1 at rest, where the N-terminus interacts with the TIR, preventing its dimerization,
  and after injury-induced activation, where the N-terminus-TIR interaction is disrupted
  and the TIR’s multimerize, leading to enzymatic degradation of NAD+. D. SARM1 cleaves
  NAD+ into Nam and ADPR, and can also cyclize ADPR into cyclic ADPR.
