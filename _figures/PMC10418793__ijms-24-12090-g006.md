caption: Major pathways involved in retinal inflammation. (A) JAK/STAT3/SOCS3 pathway.
  Cytokines (such as IL-6) bind to their cognate receptors, the receptor-associated
  tyrosine kinases (Janus kinases) lead to phosphorylation and dimerization of signal
  transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), which then translocate to the
  nucleus to induce expression of proinflammatory genes. As the target gene of this
  pathway, SOCS3 acts as a negative feedback loop to inhibit JAKs and block the signaling
  pathway. (B) Growth factors, cytokines, and pathogens induce activation of members
  of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family, followed by
  sequential phosphorylation of MAP2K and JNK. Activated JNK phosphorylates Jun/Fos
  result in the expression of target genes. (C). Canonical and alternative NF-κB pathways.
  Toll like receptors (TLRs) and proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α and IL-1)
  activate canonical pathway. Upon stimulation, TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) phosphorylates
  IKKβ in the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex, followed by phosphorylation of
  IκBα, which sequester NF-κB members in the cytoplasm. The phosphorylated IκBα is
  degraded by the proteasome, leading to the translocation of the NF-κB dimers p65/p50
  complex to the nucleus where it activates the transcription of target genes. In
  noncanonical pathway, NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK) activates IKKα after stimulation,
  followed by the phosphorylation of p100. The phosphorylated p100 is processed in
  proteasome, generating the subunit p52. Finally, the p52/RelB NF-κB complex is able
  to translocate to the nucleus and induce gene expression. (D) In endothelial cells,
  binding of VEGF to its receptor activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Raf/MERK/ERK, and src/FAK
  pathways, leading to cell proliferation, survival, vascular permeability, and inflammation,
  therefore, promoting angiogenesis. Angiopoietin (Ang) binds its receptor Tie. Ang1
  binds to Tie2 to activate the signaling pathway, while the Ang2 binding or Tie2/VE-PTP
  interaction blocks pathway. (This figure was partly generated using Servier Medical
