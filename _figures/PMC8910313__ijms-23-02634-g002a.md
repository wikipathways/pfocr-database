caption: (a). Schematic representation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. CHS,
  chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H,
  flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; UFGT, flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase. The “*” means multiplication. After Liu et al. [] (thanks
  to Frontiers in Chemistry). (b). Glucosides of other anthocyanidins. Shown are peonidin
  made from cyanidin while delphinidin is converted to petunidin, which in turn is
  converted to malvinidin (thanks to Dr. Tahira Fatima for help with this figure.
  See above text for details).
