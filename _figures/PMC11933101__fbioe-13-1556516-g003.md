caption: The production of malic acid can be increased by overexpressing enzymes in
  the rTCA pathway (yellow arrow), oTCA pathway (green arrow), glyoxylic acid pathway
  (dark green arrow), and one-step pathway (pink arrow). Genes that may inhibit or
  delete the metabolic flux are indicated by red arrows, while transmembrane transport
  is shown with dotted arrows. C4t318, C4-dicarboxylate transporter; mstC, glucose
  low-affinity transporter; hxkA, hexokinase A; pckA, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
