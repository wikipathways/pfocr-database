caption: Schematic diagram showing the main components of the TGF-β signaling pathway.
  TGF-β signals through a pair of transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors
  known as the type I (TβRI, also known as ALK5) and type II (TβRII) TGF-β receptors.
  TGF-β binds TβRII, a constitutively active kinase, which then associates with ALK5
  resulting in the formation of a ternary signaling complex. TβRII phosphorylates
  ALK5 resulting in activation of the ALK5 kinase activity. Activated ALK5 then phosphorylates
  intracellular Smad2 and Smad3 proteins, which form a complex with Smad4 and enter
  the nucleus where they regulate gene transcription in co-operation with various
  coactivators or corepressors. Smad7 expression is induced by TGF-β and acts in a
  negative feedback loop to inhibit TGF-β signaling by binding to activated ALK5 and
  preventing Smad2/3 phosphorylation. ALK5, activin receptor-like kinase 5; TGF-β,
  transforming growth factor beta. To see this illustration in color, the reader is
