caption: The PI3Kα complex is recruited to the plasma membrane by phosphorylated RTKs.
  Inhibition of PI3Kα by a non-mutant selective PI3K inhibitor (left panel) causes
  initial inhibition of PI3K pathway activity, however, feedback leads to increased
  RTK expression, which results in maintained PI3K signaling. For the p110α-mutant
  selective-degrading PI3K inhibitors inavolisib and taselisib (right panel), binding
  of the inhibitor to mutant p110α/p85β causes proteasome-mediated degradation downstream
  of activation by HER2/3. Degradation of p110α prevents feedback-mediated reactivation
  of the pathway, leading to sustained inhibition of mutant PI3K signalling. Shown
  is the binding of p85 to the HER2/HER3 RTK dimer, with the pYXXM motifs in HER3
  functioning as docking sites for the SH2 domains of p85 (note that HER2 lacks such
  pYXXM motifs).
