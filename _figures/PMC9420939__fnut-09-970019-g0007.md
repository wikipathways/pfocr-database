caption: Co-regulated metabolic pathways in PTX and MBL extract treated MCF-7 xenograft
  mice. (A) Altered unsaturated fatty acids metabolic pathway. (B) Altered purine
  metabolism. Boxes represented for the level of metabolites identified in NC (green),
  NT (blue), PTX (red), LSD (purple), and HSD (orange) group. Data represent means
  ± standard deviation. * is represent statistical significance with P < 0.05 when
  compared to NT group.
