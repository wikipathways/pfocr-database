caption: EMT in fibrosis. In mouse models of renal and hepatic fibrosis, up to 40%
  of α-SMA–positive, collagen-secreting myofibroblasts have been shown to arise from
  the differentiation of local epithelial progenitors via EMT. Repression of the transcription
  factors Snail1, Snail2, Zeb1 and Zeb2 are important for the maintenance of epithelial
  morphology. Several factors that are upregulated in the context of inflammation,
  including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), TGF-β1, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs),
  Wnt and Notch signaling proteins, can activate the Snail-Zeb pathway, leading to
  mesenchymal differentiation in these cells. Rx, pathways being targeted for therapy,
  either preclinically or in clinical trials; HA, hyaluronic acid; FSP-1, fibroblast-specific
  protein-1.
