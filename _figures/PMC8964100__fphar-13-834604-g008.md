caption: 'Mechanism of DHM on pulmonary fibrosis. (A) Schematic presentation of the
  mechanism in pulmonary fibrosis affected by DHM: TGF-β1 could induce fibroblasts
  to differentiate into myofibroblasts and overexpress fibronectin, Col1a1, and α-SMA
  in vitro, while DHM could suppress this differentiation progress by inhibiting the
  STAT3/p-STAT3/Glut1 signaling pathway; DHM could also alleviate pulmonary fibrosis
  induced by BLM via suppressing the differentiation of fibroblasts in the mouse model.
  (B) Intracellular signaling pathway of DHM: phosphorylation of STAT3 could promote
  the expression of GLUT1 and enhance the production of ATP, which eventually lead
  to the differentiation, proliferation, and migration of fibroblasts; DHM could regulate
  these functions by inhibiting the phosphorylation of STAT3. DHM might also regulate
  the respiratory chain directly and lead to the suppression of differentiation, proliferation,
  and migration of fibroblasts.'
