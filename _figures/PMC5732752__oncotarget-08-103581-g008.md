caption: (A) Schematic showing the KGFR downstream signalling pathway including the
  KGFR substrate FRS2a and downstream kinases AKT and GSK3β. (B) Lysates of NHK, WT
  and E5KO keratinocytes subjected to high calcium differentiation were analysed for
  p-AKT, total AKT and p-GSK3β. GAPDH served as a loading control. Western blots are
  representative of three independent experiments in two donor lines
