caption: 'Larval muscle guidance during embryogenesis and tendon development of leg
  muscles. (A) Known molecular actors controlling myotube guidance/arrest toward tendon
  cells during embryogenesis. Slit is cleaved by Amontillado protease () into a rapidly
  degraded Slit-C fragment and a Slit-N that remains tethered to the membrane of the
  expressing cell by binding to the robo2 receptor. Slit-N is interpreted as a short-range
  repulsive and/or arrest signal by approaching myotubes through its interaction with
  Robo1/3 and Syndecan co-receptors (). Later, it was proposed that Robo1/3 functions
  in the muscle arrest through its interaction with the LRT protein. Other molecules
  also impact muscle guidance: the complex Kon/Ed/Grip accumulates at the tip of some
  myotubes and interacts with LanB1to promote their migration. Wnt5 protein is secreted
  by both muscle and tendon cells and acts through Drl and Dnt transmembrane receptors
  to regulate muscle migratory behavior. FGF signaling is also an essential regulator
  of myotube guidance through the regulation of cytoskeletal regulatory proteins.
  Figure is adapted from . (B) Terminal differentiation of tendon larval muscles.
  Myotubes reaching their site of attachment release the vein ligand. Vein accumulates
  at the MTJ and binds to its receptor (EGFR) at the tendon cell membrane. EGF pathway
  activation triggers a switch between How (L) and How (S) isoforms. Both How isoforms
  can bind sr mRNA, How (L) isoform represses the sr mRNA nuclear export and leads
  to its degradation and How (S) favors the splicing of the srA isoform, leading to
  upregulation of the srA protein that triggers tendon terminal differentiation. (C)
