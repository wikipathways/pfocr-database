caption: 'Abnormalities in IRS1 interaction in the KEGG PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
  (PI3K-AKT). GRB2, PI3KR1, PI3KR2, PPP2R1A, PPP2CA/B, and RPS6 were identified as
  IRS1 interaction partners in the study, and, except for PIK3R1, interactions between
  IRS1 and other identified interaction partners were previously unreported in human
  skeletal muscle. The KEGG PI3K-AKT pathway was exported from www.kegg.jp as a diagram.
  A: The exported diagram was color-coded for identified IRS1 interaction partners
  according to their differences in IRS1 interaction among LCs, OCs, and T2D patients.
  If a protein has altered interactions with IRS1 in more than one comparison, it
  may be highlighted in more than one color. The KEGG representation of this signaling
  pathway highlights the important processes that are regulated by insulin (e.g.,
  protein synthesis, glucose uptake, and glycogen synthesis) and the relationship
  of identified IRS1 interaction partners within the KEGG PI3K-AKT insulin pathway
  and associated abnormalities in OCs and T2D patients. Please note that currently
  there is no comprehensive pathway database and some proteins known to be involved
  in the PI3K-AKT pathway may not be included in the KEGG PI3K-AKT pathway. B: The
  interaction between PP2Ac (also known as PPP2AC) and IRS1 was increased in OCs and
  T2D patients compared with LCs. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. White bar,
  basal; black bar, 2-h insulin-stimulated. *P < 0.05 compared with lean basal; @P
  < 0.05 compared with lean 2-h insulin.'
