caption: The diagram represents the molecular cross-talk between TLR2 heterodimers
  with TLR6/TLR1 and GR through the participation of PI3K. Upon TLR2 agonist sensing,
  TIR domain phosphorylation in Tyrosine (P) recruits PI3K activating an atypical
  signalling pathway that promotes Akt activation through membrane phospholipids.
  Akt seems to repress NF-κB and AP-1 related genes that are classically induced by
  the MyD88-dependent TLR pathway. Upon dexamethasone treatment Tyr phosphorylation
  in position 598 and 663 promotes also PI3K recruitment through p85 subunit. Both
  receptors might compete the binding of the kinase (see dotted line) resulting in
  activation or repression of inflammatory genes, such as TNF-α.
