caption: 'NF-ĸB signaling pathway. In PCNSL, activation of NF-ĸB signaling pathway
  can be mediated through the gain of 18q21.33-q23, activating the mutation of CARD11
  and stimulation of the B-cell receptor (BCR), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or toll-like
  receptor (TLR) pathway. MYD88 mutations, which are frequently seen in PCNSL, lead
  to spontaneous assembly of a protein complex containing IRAK1 and IRAK4, ultimately
  resulting in NF-ĸB signaling pathway activation, Janus kinase (JAK) activation of
  STAT3 pathway, and the secretion of IL-6, IL-10, and interferon-β. TNF-R: TNF receptor,
