caption: 'Proposed Src involvement in HCEC wound healing. This scheme summarizes the
  pathway from wounding to HCEC wound closure and includes EGFR transactivation and
  its downstream signaling. Wounding activates Src, which leads to the release of
  HB-EGF. The soluble form of HB-EGF then binds EGFR, which transduces the signals
  into the intracellular signaling pathways, including the activation of Src. After
  EGFR activation, HCEC migration, proliferation, and wound healing are induced through
  PI3K, ERK, and other intracellular signaling pathways. Activation of PI3K, but not
  ERK, pathway in HCECs after EGFR (trans)activation requires Src activation. Light
  solid arrows: novel findings reported in the present paper. Dash lines: remain to
  be determined.'
