caption: Type 2 cytokines show diverse effect of NK cells activation. Two outcomes
  in response to IL-4, (A) Alone or combines with 1 cytokines IL-4 mediates NK cells
  activation which resulted in increased expression of IFN-γ, potentially via STAT5
  and STAT4. (B) Suppressive effect of IL-4 resulted in reduced IFN-γ and granzyme
  B expression suggested by the inhibition of Tbet and STAT4 signaling pathway. (C)
  IL-6 shows similar suppressive effect via STAT3 signaling pathway.
