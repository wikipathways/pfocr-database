caption: Activation of AHR signaling in canonical and non-canonical manners. Upon
  ligand binding, AHR translocates into the nucleus in the canonical pathway, where
  it forms a heterodimer with ARNT. This complex then interacts with Xenobiotic Response
  Elements (XRE) on target gene promoters, initiating downstream gene transcription.
  Conversely, in the non-canonical pathway, ligand-bound AHR interacts with alternative
  transcription factors such as KLF6, ERα, and NFκB, leading to the activation of
  gene transcription or degradation of transcription factors independent of XRE interaction.
