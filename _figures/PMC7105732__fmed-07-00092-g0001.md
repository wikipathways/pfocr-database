caption: “Four Hits” Hypothesis of IgA Nephropathy. In individuals with a genetic
  predisposition to IgA nephropathy, infection, or other events destroy the mucosal
  barrier defense function. Chronic stimulation such as pathogenic microbial or alimentary
  antigens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells, thereby activating B cells, and
  differentiating into plasma cell secreted IgA in T-cell-dependent or non-dependent
  manners. Due to the abnormal regulation of mucosal-bone marrow axis, the mis-expression
  of homing receptors on the surface of B/plasm cells leads to increased synthesis
  of poorly glycosylated IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) and self-aggregation to form aggregated Gd-IgA1
  (Hit 1). The aberrant exposure of GalNAc of Gd-IgA1 as antigen stimulates B cells
  to differentiate into plasma cells and synthesizes anti-Gd-IgA1 autoantibodies (Hit
  2). The Gd-IgA1 immune complex (Gd-IgA1-IC) is formed by anti-Gd-IgA1 autoantibodies
  binding to Gd-IgA1 along with soluble sCD89 (Hit 3). Macromolecular Gd-IgA1-IC binds
  to the IgA receptor (CD71) expressed on mesangial cells and deposits on the glomerular
  mesangium. Subsequently, the mesangial cells release various inflammatory factors
  (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, etc.) under the stimulation of ICs, attracting
  and recruiting multiple subsets of T cells, macrophages, neutrophils infiltration,
  and activating the lectin pathway and alternative pathway of the complement system.
  Synergistic effects lead to glomerular injuries such as mesangial hyperplasia, matrix
  expansion, and interstitial fibrosis (Hit 4). DC, Dendritic cell; TLRs, Toll like
  receptors; APRIL, a proliferation-inducing ligand; DAMPs, damage-associated molecular
  patterns; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; Gd-IgA1, poorly glycosylated
  IgA1/Galactose-deficient IgA1; AP, The alternative pathway; LP, The lectin pathway.
