caption: Candidate antiviral agents for SARS-CoV-2 in relation to the viral replication
  cycle. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells either through an endosomal pathway or by virus–cell
  fusion mediated by spike (S) glycoprotein binding to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2). Viral genomic RNA is unveiled in the cytoplasm, and the single-stranded
  positive-sense genome is transcribed to produce the viral proteases papain-like
  protease (PLpro) and 3C-like serine protease (3CLpro), which cleave the two large
  polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (NSPs), including
  two replicase polyproteins (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase (Hel)).
  Mature NSPs and the RdRp and Hel proteins are gathered into replication–transcription
  complexes (RTCs) for viral replication and transcription. RTCs synthesize negative-strand
  guide RNA (gRNA) and a set of subgenomic RNAs for viral replication and transcription.
  The newly produced subgenomic RNAs are translated into viral structural proteins
  such as the S, membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins. These proteins are inserted
  into the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transported to
  the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to assemble with the N protein-encapsidated
  RNA to form viral particles. Virions are then released from the cell through exocytosis.
