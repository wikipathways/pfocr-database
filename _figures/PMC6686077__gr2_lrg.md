caption: Roles of Glycosylation in Viral Pathogenesis. The roles contributing to viral
  pathogenesis and host-cell strategies used to respond to viral infection are coloured
  blue and red, respectively. Green and pink indicate oligomannose and complex-type
  N-linked glycan processing states, respectively. (A) Glycoprotein Folding and Trafficking.
  As with all glycoproteins, glycans on viral glycoproteins aid in folding and trafficking
  through the host secretory pathway. (B) Glycosylation in Viral Release. Glycosylation
  of infected host cell proteins can influence viral spread. (C) Immune Evasion Using
  Secreted/Shed Glycoproteins. Viruses can shed or secrete glycoproteins to act as
  immune decoys. (D) Immune Evasion by Molecular Mimicry and Glycan Shielding. Extensively
  glycosylated viral proteins shield themselves from the host immune response by occluding
  the immunogenic proteinous surface with a dense coat of host-derived glycans. (E)
  Glycans as Attachment Factors and Enhanced Uptake by Immune Cells. Some virus envelope-displayed
  glycoproteins contain under-processed oligomannose-type glycans that function as
  host-cell attachment factors to augment or facilitate infection of immune cells.
  (F) Host Glycans as Attachment Factors. Viruses can recognise glycans presented
  on host cell-surface proteins to facilitate host cell attachment. (G) Soluble Lectins
  of the Innate Immune System and Complement Activation. As under-processed glycans
  are rarely presented on mature host cell glycoproteins [,], the innate immune system
  is able to recognise these glycans as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
  using soluble lectins. (H) Glycans as Antibody Epitopes. Where glycan shielding
  is conserved on viral glycoproteins, it is possible for the humoral immune response,
  in rare cases, to elicit neutralising antibodies that target sugars as part of their
  epitopes.
