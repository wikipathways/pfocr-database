caption: Macrophage metabolic reprograming. (A) Alternatively activated macrophages
  have an induced fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and produce pyruvate from glycolysis
  and this is converted in acetyl-CoA, which is then used by the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle to give electrons in the form of NADH and FADH2 to the mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes to produce ATP. (B) When macrophages
  polarize to classically activated macrophages, metabolic reprogramming takes place
  and lactate is produced instead of pyruvate, and the TCA cycle is broken at two
  points, after citrate, and after succinate, resulting in the accumulation of these
  three metabolites. Citrate accumulates due to lower expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase
  (IDH) and can either be transported to the cytosol through solute carrier family
  25 member 1 (SLC25a1), where it can be converted in acetyl-CoA by ATP citrate lyase
  (ACLY), or to the nucleus where the same conversion can take place. Acetyl-CoA can
  then be used for lysine acetylation or for lipogenesis. (C) Other changes in classically
  activated macrophages include succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibition by itaconate,
  which is produced by upregulated cis-aconitate decarboxylase (CAD), and this results
  in succinate accumulation. Succinate levels can also increase as a consequence of
  augmented levels of glutamine anaplerosis, either through an upregulated GABA (γ-aminobutyric
  acid) shunt or through glutaminolysis. SDH is also part of the mitochondrial respiratory
  chain and its inhibition will lead to decreased mitochondrial respiration and increased
  ROS (reactive oxygen species) production. Succinate inhibits prolyl hydroxylase
  domain (PHD) proteins, resulting in less hydroxylation of hypoxia-inducible factor
  1-alpha (HIF-1α), which circumvents its degradation and allows its binding to hypoxia
  response elements (HRE) on target genes (). HIF-1α also promotes the switch to glycolysis
  by inducing glycolytic enzymes like hexokinase 2 (1st reaction of glycolysis), pyruvate
  kinase M2 (PKM2, 10th reaction), and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI, 2nd reaction).
  The enzyme product of the latter is used in the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), which is also upregulated in classically activated macrophages. HIF-1α
  also upregulates the enzymes lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
  1 (PDK1) leading to higher lactate production and lower acetyl-CoA synthesis, respectively.
