caption: Data presented in this study show a protective role for Xist under acute
  inflammation by decreasing the nuclear migration of NF-kB in J774A.1 cells. The
  reciprocal regulation between Xist and the NF-κB pathway may explain, at least in
  part, a key function for XIST in the regulation of acute inflammatory responses
  in women.
