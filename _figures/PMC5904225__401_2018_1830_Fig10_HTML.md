caption: Schematic summary of the findings. Molecular and histological relationships
  between ACP pathogenesis and tooth development. The enamel knot and the β-catenin-accumulating
  clusters, which both have similar expression profiles and comparable histology,
  act as signalling hubs through the secretion of a several growth factors acting
  in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner on the surrounding cells, i.e. the enamel
  epithelium/dental mesenchyme in the forming tooth or the palisading epithelium,
  stellate reticulum and glial reactive tissue in ACP. Reciprocal signalling from
  surrounding tissues to the enamel knot and clusters is indicated by double-headed
  arrows. In the glial reactive tissue, cholesterol crystals activate the inflammasomes
  resulting in the secretion of IL1B, which in turn acts on the local immune effector
  cells to drive an inflammatory response

  and odontogenic programmes in human adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma and identifies
  the MAPK/ERK pathway as a novel therapeutic target.
