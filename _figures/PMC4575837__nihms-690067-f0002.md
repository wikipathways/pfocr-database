caption: A complex crosstalk exists between the energy-sensing pathways in mammals.
  The complexes of the mTOR pathway, TORC1 and TORC2 are activated by signals of high
  nutrient availability. TORC1 is stimulated by the presence of amino acids, growth
  factors including insulin, ATP, and glycolysis metabolites. TORC2 is also activated
  by growth factor signaling including insulin and EGF and further activates TORC1
  through Akt. Together, TORC1 and TORC2 stimulate cell growth and proliferation through
  the inhibition of cell maintenance pathways such as autophagy, and the stimulation
  of global protein synthesis. Conversely, AMPK inhibits TORC1 and is activated by
  a low energy status in the cell. AMPK also contributes activate the sirtuins, including
  SIRT1 and SIRT3, and is in turn further activated by SIRT1. SIRT1 leads to the activation
  of PGC-1α. PGC-1α activation induces the transcription of many important genes involved
  in mitochondrial biogenesis and regulation, including Nrf-1, and Nrf-2, which induce
  expression of TFAM, and also further transcriptionally activates itself and SIRT3.
  Meanwhile, SIRT3 activates FoxO3, which induces the expression of key ROS antioxidants
  such as SOD2 and catalase as well as key genes involved in autophagy. SIRT1 further
  activates autophagic machinery by deacetylation of key atophagic components. Activation
  of autophagy can consequently activate mitophagy, leading to selective clearance
  of damaged or unfit mitochondria. In the mitochondria, SIRT3 also deacetylates many
  proteins including complexes of the electron transport chain, MPTP component cyclohpilin
  D, and SOD2, resulting in greater respiratory efficiency, apoptotic resistance,
  and ROS protection. Arrows indicate activation. T bars indicate suppression.
