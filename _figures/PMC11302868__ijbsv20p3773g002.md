caption: Four main defense pathways in ferroptosis. The GPX4-GSH signaling pathway
  is primarily located in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. The DHODH-CoQ signaling
  pathway is primarily located in the mitochondria. The FSP1-CoQ signaling pathway
  and the GCH1-BH4 signaling pathway are primarily located in the cytoplasm
