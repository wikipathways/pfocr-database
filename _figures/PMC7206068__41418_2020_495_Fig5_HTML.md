caption: cGAS senses cytosolic DNA and generates the second messenger cGAMP, which
  binds to STING, promoting its oligomerization. STING is therefore able to interact
  with protein kinases TBK1 and IKK and stimulate the expression of type I IFN and
  inflammatory cytokines. TRIM14 recruits the deubiquitinase USP14, which cleaves
  polyubiquitin from the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS and promotes its p62-mediated autophagic
  degradation. TRIM38 is required for the sumoylation of the downstream effector STING,
  preventing its degradation by the chaperone-mediated autophagy. Auto-ubiquitination
  of TRIM23 stimulates the STING activated protein kinase TBK1, promoting its ability
  to phosphorylate the selective autophagy cargo receptor p62. In response to interferon
  γ stimulation (IFNγ), TRIM21 inhibits STING signaling pathway by promoting the autophagic
  degradation of IRF3 dimers. In HTLV-1-infected cells, the viral protein TAX promotes
  monoubiquitination of IKKs by TRIM21 which allows their interaction with the autophagy
  receptor p62 and the sequestration into the autophagosome. TRIM32 inhibits Toll-like
  receptors 3/4 activity. TRIM32 mediates the autophagic degradation of TRIF, a critical
  adaptor protein of Toll-like receptors 3/4, by interacting with the selective autophagy
  receptor TAX1BP1.
