caption: 'Stimuli for degranulation of mast cells and basophils and interplay/overlap
  with type II-IV reactions. Beside the canonical IgE-mediated true allergic pathway,
  activation of the complement system and the direct interaction with IgE-receptor
  can lead to degranulation. Changes in the the metabolism and signaling of various
  arachidonic acid-derivatives, e.g., cysteinyl leukotrienes, or in the histaminergic
  system, as well as changes to the kallikrein-kinine-system are believed to aggravate
  any reactions. Light red: proteins/genes involved in hypersensitivity with known
  genetic associations; Dark red: example of drugs leading to primarily non-allergic
  hypersensitivity ADR. ACEi, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor; ALOX5, 5′-lipoxygenase;
  ASA, acetylsalicylic acid (USAN: aspirin); C3a/C5a, activated components 3 and 5
  of the complement system; DAO, diaminooxidase; Fc    R, IgE-receptor; HLA, human
  leukocyte antigen; HRH, histamine receptor; LTC4S, cysteinyl leukotriene synthetase;
  NAT, N-acetyl transferase; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; RCM, radio
  contrast media; TBXAS1, thromboxane synthetase; TCR, T-cell receptor; TXA2R, thromboxane
  receptor; XPNPEP2, aminopeptidase P.'
