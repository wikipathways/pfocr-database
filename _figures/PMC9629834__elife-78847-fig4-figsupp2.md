caption: (A) Proposed relationship between epilepsy (EP) risk genes and cluster 5
  biological functions. STRING-DB analysis of EP risk genes in cluster 5 and proteins
  found in the Reactome pathway for AMPA receptor trafficking and plasticity. (B)
  Temporal changes in protein abundance in the NTN1-DCC signaling subnetwork between
  early postnatal and adult, annotated by gene name. Node color, Log2 fold change
  normalized to the neonate condition. Edges, solid and blunt arrows for activation
  and inhibition, closed and opened circles for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation,
  respectively.
