caption: 'Cell signalling events that mediate the switch between self-renewal and
  differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells. (A) LIF binds to the LIF receptor
  (LIFR) resulting in heterodimerisation with glycoprotein-130 (gp130). Downstream
  JAK proteins become phosphorylated, and in this active state phosphorylate tyrosine
  residues on the receptor complex. STAT3 can then dock to the receptor, is then phosphorylated
  at Y705, and homodimerises before translocating to the nucleus where it induces
  the transcription of self-renewal genes. LIF also activates the PI3K pathway, in
  which PIP2 is converted to PIP3 resulting in the downstream phosphorylation of AKT
  at S473 and T308. This enhances self-renewal by upregulating the expression of Nanog,
  and by promoting cell cycle progression. (B) BMP4 binds to its cognate BMP receptor
  (BMPR) resulting in the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8. Once phosphorylated, SMAD1/5/8
  forms heterodimers with SMAD4, which translocate to the nucleus resulting in transcription
  of inhibitor-of-differentiation (Id) genes. SMAD signaling also results in the upregulation
  of the phosphatase DUSP9 which acts as a negative regulator of ERK, thereby inhibiting
  differentiation. (C) LIF also activates the MAPK/ERK pathway to promote differentiation
  in the face of maintaining self-renewal. The balance can be tipped toward differentiation
  by the presence of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF4), which upregulates the activity
  of the MAPK/ERK pathways, as does (D) L-proline. L-proline enters the cell via the
  Sodium-coupled Neutral Amino Acid Transporter (SNAT)-2 where it activates mTOR to
  induce the differentiation of mESCs to early primitive ectoderm-like (EPL) cells.
