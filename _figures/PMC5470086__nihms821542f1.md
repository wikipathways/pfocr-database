caption: Two bile acid synthesis pathways exist in the liver. The classic pathway
  is initiated by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), while the alternative pathway
  is initiated by sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). In humans, two primary bile acids
  are synthesized, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). For synthesis
  of CA, sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) is needed. Mitochondrial CYP27A1 catalyzes
  the steroid side-chain oxidation reaction. In the alternative pathway, oxysterol
  7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) is involved in the synthesis of oxysterol intermediates,
  which are converted to bile acids, mainly CDCA, in hepatocytes. In mice, CDCA is
  converted to tauro-α-muricholic acid (TαMCA) and then TβMCA as primary bile acids.
  Bile acids are secreted through the bile salt export pump (BSEP), stored in the
  gallbladder, and secreted into the gastrointestinal tract and reabsorbed through
  apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT) in the ileum. In the colon,
  TCA and TDCA are first de-conjugated by bacterial bile salt hydrolases (BSH), and
  dehydroxylated by bacterial 7α-dehydroxylases to form the secondary bile acids,
  deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), respectively. In the ileum, the
  bile acid efflux transporter, sinusoidal organic solute transporter α/β (OSTα/β)
  effluxes bile acids and circulates bile acids to the liver via the portal vein to
  inhibit bile acid synthesis. Two mechanisms have been suggested to inhibit CYP7A1
  and CYP8B1 gene transcription. In the liver, bile acids activate nuclear receptor
  farnesoid X receptor (FXR) to induce a negative nuclear receptor, small heterodimer
  partner (SHP) to inhibit CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 gene transcription. In the intestine,
  FXR induces fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15, or FGF19 in humans), which is circulated
  to the liver to activate plasma membrane FGF receptor 4 (FHFR4)/βKlotho signaling
  to inhibit CYP7A1 gene transcription. TGR5 (Gpbar-1) is expressed in the ileum and
  colon. TGR5 activates cAMP signaling to stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
  secretion in enteroendocrine L cells. GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion in pancreatic
  β cells to improve insulin sensitivity. Decreasing BSH activity in gut microbiota
  increases TβMCA, which antagonizes FXR activity to reduce FGF15/19 and stimulates
  bile acid synthesis in hepatocytes. Increasing BSH activity in gut microbiota reduces
  TMCA antagonism of FXR and stimulates FGF15/19 production to inhibit bile acid synthesis.
  Thus, the gut-to-liver axis plays a critical role in regulation of bile acid synthesis
  and metabolic homeostasis.
