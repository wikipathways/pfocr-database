caption: Schematic representation of HLRCC pathway. HLRCC, marked by defective oxidative
  phosphorylation, undergoes a metabolic transition to aerobic glycolysis to produce
  ATP required for the energetic requirements of proliferating cells. Enhanced glycolysis
  represses AMPK expression and activation, resulting in increased S6 and ACC activity,
  fostering anabolic growth and proliferation. Decreased AMPK yields decreased p53
  and iron transporter DMT1. Cytosolic iron concentrations will suppress prolyl hydroxylase,
  which is susceptible to iron levels, stabilizing HIF1α. Fumarate, which rises in
  FH-deficient cells, has been shown to suppress prolyl hydroxylase, which will contribute
  to more stabilization of HIF1α, enhancing the transcription of factors such as VEGF
  and GLUT1. Enhanced fumarate was shown to succinate KEAP1, thereby altering its
  conformation and affecting its capacity to cause Nrf2 degradation. Nrf2 transcription
  activates anti-oxidant reactions and protects against oxidative stress. Increased
  HIF1α will stimulate LDHA, increase lactate development, and stimulate PDK1, which
  inhibits PHD and decreases pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle. HLRCC utilizes glutamine-dependent
  reductive carboxylation to form citrate. HLRCC, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal
  cell carcinoma; FH, fumarate hydratase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; PHD,
  prolyl hydroxylase; PDK1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1.
