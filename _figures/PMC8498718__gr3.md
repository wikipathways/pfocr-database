caption: The networks involving 45 RNA expression of AAs in CINJ cohort by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IPA identified two significant molecular pathways
  using 45 RNA expression of AAs in CINJ cohort. Red represents genes were the higher
  expression in AAs than CAs, and green represent genes were the lower expression
  in AAs than CAs. Solid lines represent the direct relationship, and dashed lines
  represent the indirect relationship, and arrows represent acts on. AAs, African
  Americans; CA, Caucasian.
