caption: 'mRNAs differentially expressed across tissues under well-watered and water-deficit
  stress within a simplified flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Color codes correspond
  to those used in Figure 1: Purple (skin-specific), green (pulp-specific), and brown
  (seed-specific). Letters in parentheses following the Unigene name correspond to
  the cluster assignment. Intermediates colors indicate genes expressed equally within
  two tissues. The three genes that lack color-coding were not differentially expressed.
  Yellow and blue squares indicate mRNAs over-expressed under water-deficit and well-watered
  tissues, respectively, with in tissue type indicated inside the square (P: pulp;
  SK: skin; SD: seed).'
