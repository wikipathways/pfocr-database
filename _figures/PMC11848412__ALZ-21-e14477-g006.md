caption: 'A, Schematic illustration of how calcium dysregulation in the aging association
  cortex leads to activation of calpain‐2 and an exacerbation in sporadic AD pathology.
  Calcium regulatory mechanisms that constrain feedforward cAMP–calcium signaling,
  for example, PDE4, calbindin, mGluR3, are lost with age and/or inflammation (shown
  in gray). Activated calpain‐2 leads to tau hyperphosphorylation by disinhibiting
  GSK3β and cdk5. Disinhibited cdk5 also increases β‐secretase production of Aβ. Calpain‐2
  cleavage of hsp70.1 leads to cathepsin‐induced cellular necrosis, identical to the
  pattern by which neurons degenerate in sporadic AD, as well as increased fibrillation
  of p‐tau. Furthermore, activated calpain mediates synapse loss through activation
  of the p38‐MK2‐LIMK1 signaling pathway and cleavage of ROCK1. As APOE ε4 exacerbates
  calcium dysregulation, and rhesus monkeys are all APOE ε4 homozygotes, they may
  be particularly susceptible to sporadic AD‐like neuropathology. B, The rhesus monkey
  model provides the opportunity to test treatments that restore calcium regulation
  that act upstream of Aβ and tau pathology, and that may be especially involved in
  the etiology of sporadic AD. This includes: (1) 2‐MPPA and 2‐PMPA that reduce GCPII
  expression to potentiate mGluR3‐mediated regulation of calcium signaling within
  postsynaptic compartments to attenuate tau pathology, including p‐tau217 in brain
  and blood plasma; (2) S107, which stabilizes pS2808‐RyR2 with downstream effector
  protein calstabin‐2 to prevent excess calcium “leak” from the SER to the cytosol;
  (3) guanfacine, a selective noradrenergic α2A‐AR agonist that can strengthen network
  connections and improve cognitive functioning by regulating cAMP–calcium signaling;
  (4) NA‐184, a highly selective calpain‐2 inhibitor, which is currently under investigation
  in aged rhesus macaques as a potential therapy. Our hypothesis posits that administration
  of NA‐184 early in the aging process will prevent tau and amyloid pathology prior
