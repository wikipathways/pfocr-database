caption: Top networks associated with lipid metabolism identified in PIEs infected
  with G5P[7]. IPA generates pathways using the most significant entities from the
  experimental data sets and connects to create a comprehensible synopsis of the analysis.
  In the graphical representation of a network, genes/gene products are represented
  as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an
  edge (line). The intensity of the node color indicates the degree of upregulation
  (red) or downregulation (green), and more confidence predicted activation (blue)
  or inhibition (brown) of a given gene. The intensity of the edge color indicates
  the degree of confidence of predicted activation (orange) or inhibition (blue).
  G5P[7] infection was primarily associated with significant inhibition of the ERK/MAPK
  and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling, both of which are notable cell
  proliferation and survival pathways, in response to extracellular signaling. The
  ERK pathway serves as a “superhighway” between cellular surfaces to the nucleus
  of cells, where information is rapidly delivered in response to signals regarding
  environmental impacts and can mediate apoptosis [43]. ERK pathway degradation is
  associated with increased apoptosis effects [44]. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway is associated with the induction of apoptosis [45]
