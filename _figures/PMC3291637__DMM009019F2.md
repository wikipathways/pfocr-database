caption: Proposed differences in the localization of Fe-S cluster biogenesis proteins
  in S. cerevisiae versus mammalian cells. (A) Yeast mitochondria contain the basic
  Fe-S cluster biogenesis proteins, whereas cytosolic Fe-S cluster biogenesis has
  been proposed to depend on the export of a sulfur compound from mitochondria through
  the transporter Atm1 (ABCB7 in human cells). Further biogenesis in the cytoplasm
  depends on a distinct set of proteins, including Tah18, Dre2, Nbp35, Cfd1, Nar1
  and Cia1, which are collectively referred to as CIA (cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly)
  proteins. (B) By contrast, in mammalian cells, it seems that most of the basic Fe-S
  cluster biogenesis proteins are expressed in mitochondria as well as in the cytosolic
  and/or nuclear compartment (nuclear localization of these proteins not represented
  in the figure). In addition, there are human counterparts to the proteins implicated
  in cytosolic Fe-S cluster biogenesis in yeast, including NDOR1 (homolog of Tah18),
  CIAPIN1, (homolog of Dre2), NUBP1 and NUBP2 (homologs of Nbp35 and Cfd1, respectively),
  and NARFL and CIAO1 (homologs of Nar1 and Cia1, respectively). To explain mitochondrial
  iron overload (which occurs as a consequence of disrupted Fe-S cluster biogenesis),
  it is possible that mitochondria depend on Fe-S cluster biogenesis to synthesize
  a molecule that functions as a regulatory signal. In the absence of this signal
  (i.e. when Fe-S cluster biogenesis is impaired), remodeling of nuclear transcription
  leads to mitochondrial iron overload, as the cell attempts to compensate for possible
  mitochondrial iron deficiency. Because mitochondrial iron overload probably contributes
  to disease pathogenesis in FRDA, ISCU myopathy and possibly several other diseases,
  elucidation of the details of this pathway might pave the way to new therapeutic
  interventions.
