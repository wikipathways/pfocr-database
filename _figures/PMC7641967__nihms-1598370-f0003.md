caption: 'Dopamine effects on basal ganglia circuitry. The basal ganglia have parallel
  circuits for the control of movement, cognition, and emotion. The basal ganglia
  regulate the output of the thalamus, and its ability to excite the cortex. There
  are two major pathways emanating from the striatum: a Direct pathway that overall
  excites thalamocortical projections (by inhibiting the inhibitory effects of Gpi/SNr
  on thalamus), and an Indirect pathway that overall inhibits thalamocortical projections
  (by a still more complex series of connections). Dopamine facilitates movements,
  thoughts, and emotions by exciting the Direct pathway via D1R, and inhibiting the
  Indirect pathway via D2R. DA: dopamine; Thal-Cort: thalamo-cortical; GPe: globus
