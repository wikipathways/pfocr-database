caption: De novo synthesis of ceramide and the degradation pathway. (A) The de novo
  pathway produce ceramide from the condensation of palmitate and serine, which is
  catalyzed by the serine palmitoyl-Co A synthase/serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT).
  This reaction is known to be the rate-limiting step of the de novo pathway, and
  selective inhibitors for the SPT, Myriocin, L-cycloserine and ARN14494, reduce the
  biosynthesis of ceramide. The product of SPT, 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine/3-keto-sphinganine,
  is reduced to dihydrosphingosine/sphinganine, which is followed by an acylation
  reaction to produce dihydroceramide. Finally, ceramide is produced by the catalysis
  of dihydroceramide desaturase. Ceramide is inactivated by the enzyme ceramidase,
  an enzyme that is selectively inhibited by the compound ARN082. (B) Chemical structure
  of the myriocin, L-cycloserine and ARN14494.
