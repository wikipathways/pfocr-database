caption: Schematic of dysregulated TGF-β/BMP expression in AVM endothelial cells.
  Levels of both circulating and intracellular TGF-β1 were elevated in AVM patients
  when compared to controls while intracellular BMP-9 levels were lower in AVM patients.
  Protein levels of components of the ALK1 → Smad1/5/8 → Smad6 pathway were decreased
  in AVM patients despite an increase in mRNA levels while Smads downstream of TGF-β1 → ALK5
  activation demonstrated normal mRNA expression and elevated protein levels.
