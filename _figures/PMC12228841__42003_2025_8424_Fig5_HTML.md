caption: Both TLR2 and TLR4 utilize the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, leading
  to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibitors such as SOCS and
  A20. These inhibitors modulate MyD88 signaling and contribute to the regulation
  of the immune response. Additionally, TLR1 and TLR6 influence both the TLR2 and
  TLR4 systems, playing a role in their interplay and coordination. The figure has
  been created using BioRender.com software
