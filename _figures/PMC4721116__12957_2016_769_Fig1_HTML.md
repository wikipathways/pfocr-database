caption: Reprogramming of the glycolytic pathway in cancer cells. Cancer cells rely
  on increased glycolytic flux, increasing glucose uptake, and producing large amounts
  of lactate. The expression of the PKM2 isoform allows for flexibility in that the
  dimeric form will exhibit decreased activity, promoting accumulation of glycolytic
  intermediates that can be shunted into the pentose phosphate pathway and nucleotide
  synthesis. Decreased oxidative phosphorylation in normal cells would lead to decreased
  energy charge and increased AMP, activating AMPK. Cancer cells often harbor mutations
  in the upstream AMPK kinase LKB1, without whose phosphorylation activity, AMPK cannot
  be activated and therefore cannot inhibit anabolic pathways such as nucleotide synthesis
