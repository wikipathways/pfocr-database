caption: When partially ionized at pH 7, trimethoprim is seen to impact on metabolism
  directly associated with the dihydrofolate pathway, as well as off-target effects
  upon nucleotide, sugar and amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and
  up-regulation of osmoprotectants. When trimethoprim is in a poorly ionized state
  (pH 5), it appears to have a profound effect upon the up-regulation of amino acid
  metabolism.
