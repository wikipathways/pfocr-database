caption: 'Proposed model for signal integration during shade avoidance syndrome (SAS)
  responses of Arabidopsis rosettes to increased canopy density (indicated by increased
  leaf area index, LAI). At low LAIs, only the phyB pathway is triggered in response
  to far-red radiation reflected from neighboring plants. At high LAIs, when mutual
  shading among neighbors becomes intense, the reduction in blue light activates the
  cry1 response pathway, which converges with the phyB pathway at the level of BR,
  PIF4 and PIF5, thereby boosting the SAS response. The mechanisms and signaling elements
  (BR-RE: BR-response elements) connecting BR with SAS are not known.'
