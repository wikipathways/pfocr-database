caption: β-Glucan enhances glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and glutathione synthesis in UK021
  CA tissue slices. Slices of freshly resected UK021 CA and NC lung tissues were treated
  with 0 or 100 µg/mL whole glucan particle (WGP) for 24 h in the presence of 13C6-glucose
  (Glc) with n = 1 for each treatment because of limited tissue availability. Tissue
  slices were processed, extracted for polar metabolites, and analyzed by ion chromatography–Fourier
  transform mass spectrometry (IC-FTMS), as described in Methods. The 12C (0) and
  13C (1–5) isotopologues of glycolytic, Krebs cycle, and glutathione (GSH) synthesis
  pathway metabolites are shown as bar graphs in A–I along with the atom-resolved
  tracing of these pathways. Not all possible 13C isotopologues are shown. PDH, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; PCB, pyruvate carboxylase; ME, NADP+-dependent malic enzyme; F1,6P,
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; •, 12C; •,•,•, 13C derived from PDH-, PCB-, and ME-mediated
  Krebs cycle reactions, respectively. In the WGP-treated CA tissue slice, accelerated
  glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and GSH synthesis were evident, respectively, from the
  accumulation of 13C6-F1,6P (B)/13C3-pyruvate (C)/13C3-lactate (D)/medium 13C3-lactate
  (cf. Supplemental Fig. S2), 13C-citrate (E)/13C-αketoglutarate (αKG, F )/13C-succinate,
  and 13C-Glu (J)/13C-GSH (K), as compared with control (Ctl) CA tissues. In contrast,
  the response of these metabolites in the NC tissue slice to WGP was opposite to
  that in the CA tissue slice.
