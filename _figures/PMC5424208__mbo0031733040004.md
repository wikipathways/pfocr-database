caption: Metabolic mechanism of MCR-2-mediated colistin resistance. (A) Schematic
  representation for LPS-lipid A modification by MCR-2 in E. coli. In the cytoplasm,
  bacterial LPS-lipid A is synthesized using UDP-GlcNAc as the primer substrate. The
  fatty acid intermediates (C12 and C14) from the bacterial type II fatty acid synthesis
  (FAS II) pathway enter into the conservative 10-step route of lipid A synthesis
  involving nine enzymes (LpxA, LpxC, LpxD, LpxH, LpxB, LpxK, LpxL, LpxM, and KdtA).
  The nascent lipid A from the cytoplasm is translocated by the ABC transporter MsbA,
  a lipid flippase (), across the inner membrane into the periplasm. The integral
  membrane protein MCR-2 is supposed to be localized on the periplasm side of inner
  membrane and catalyzes the chemical modification of the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic
  acid (Kdo2)-lipid A, giving Kdo2-PEA-4′-lipid A. The modified form of Kdo2-lipid
  A, Kdo2-PEA-4′-lipid A, then is exported by LptABCFG and LptDE into the outer leaflet
  of the outer membrane (), thus reducing the negative membrane charge. That is the
  reason for the low/decreased affinity of bacterial surface to the cationic antibiotic
  polymyxin. (B) Chemical reaction in which MCR-2 catalyzes the modification of lipid
  A with 4′-phosphatidylethanolamine. MCR-2 catalyzes the addition of phosphatidylethanolamine
  to position 4′ of lipid A, giving the final products of both PEA-4′-lipid A and
  diacylglycerol. This was adapted from our model proposed for MCR-1 () with minor
  modification. The molecular structures were drawn using the ChemDraw software.
