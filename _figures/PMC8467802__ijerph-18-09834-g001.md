caption: The estrogen signaling pathway. The estrogen signaling mainly includes activation
  of intracellular estrogen receptor (ER) that, upon ligand binding and dimerization,
  translocates to the nucleus, where it directly binds responsive elements of target
  genes involved in the cell growth, inflammation, proliferation, survival, and protein
  synthesis. Differently, estrogens mediate non-genomic effects and activate intracellular
  signaling through the binding of the plasma membrane receptors, ER variants and
  the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR30). This binding induces the rapid activation
  of protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), renin-angiotensin system
  (Ras) and rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (Raf), as well as the transcription factors
  nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), which regulate the gene expression of estrogen target genes.
