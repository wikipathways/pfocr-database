caption: 'The expression of genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathways of J. mandshurica
  under shade. Reconstruction of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway with the differentially
  expressed structural genes and the differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs)
  in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. The color scale from Min (blue) to Max (red)
  refers to the metabolite contents from low to high. The cluster marker on the right
  side of the heatmap represents the names of each metabolite. N: natural sunlight.
