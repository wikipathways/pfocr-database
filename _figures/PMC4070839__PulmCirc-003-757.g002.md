caption: 'Pulmonary vasodilation is a synchronized process. A variety of substances,
  shear stress, and membrane stretch work together to increase prostacyclin, nitric
  oxide (NO) production, and other pathways defined broadly as endothelial-derived
  hyperpolarizing factors that collectively cause vascular dilation. The signaling
  molecules released from the endothelium and activated pathways work in conjunction
  with epinephrine and other neurohumoral substances to increase the activity of protein
  kinases A and G (PKA and PKG, respectively). As discussed in the text, these kinases
  phosphorylate many targets that reduce the level of vascular contraction, pathways
  that have not been fully examined in the fetus. A dashed green arrow indicates an
  activation pathway; a dashed red line with a bar indicates an inhibition pathway;
  a dashed blue arrow indicates movement of calcium. AC: adenylate cyclase; ACh: acetylcholine;

  protein kinase II; cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate; cGMP: cyclic guanosine
