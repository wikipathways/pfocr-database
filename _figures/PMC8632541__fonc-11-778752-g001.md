caption: 'Illustrative representation of the HS biosynthetic pathway and the disaccharide
  structural changes that occur during each modification reaction. HS biosynthesis
  comprises the stepwise transfer of different sugar residues that leads to the elongation
  of HS chains. In the last stage of this biosynthetic pathway, polymerized HS chains
  undergo multiple modification reactions: i) NDSTs 1-4 catalyse the removal of the
  acetyl group from GlcNAc residues and the transfer of a sulfate group to free amino
  groups to form GlcNS; ii) GLCE epimerizes GlcA residues into IdoA; iii) these residues
  are then targeted by 2OST1, that transfers sulfate groups to the C2-position of
  IdoA (more rarely GlcA),thereby preventing further epimerization; iv) lastly, 6OSTs
  1-3 and 3OSTs 1-7 add sulfate groups to the C6- and C3-positions of GlcN residues,
  respectively. Chains non-reducing termini are to the right of the saccharide’s sequences.
  Glycan structures are represented according to the Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans
  (SNFG) ().'
