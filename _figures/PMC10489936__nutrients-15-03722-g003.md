caption: 'Polysaccharides modulate bile acids (BAs) metabolism through microbiota
  in the intestines. Polysaccharides promote the conversion of primary BAs to secondary
  BAs by the structural transformation effect of microbiota, which leads to a decrease
  in the binding of primary BAs to the FXR, following a lessened production of FGF15/19
  in the gut. Correspondingly, the activation of the TGR5 by secondary BAs is enhanced,
  stimulating the production of GLP-1 by intestinal L cells, strengthening the activation
  of RXR in intestinal epithelial cells, thereby blocking the NF-κB-TJs inflammatory-related
  signaling pathway and enhancing intestinal barrier function, This also results in
  a downregulation of specific transporter such as ASBT, reducing the influx of conjugated
  bile acids into the bloodstream and promoting their excretion from the gut. Abbreviations:
  BAs, bile acids; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; TGR5, Takeda
  G protein-coupled receptor 5; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B; FGF15/19, fibroblast
  growth factor 15/19; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide 1; ASBT, apical sodium-dependent
  bile acids transporter; OSTα/β, organic solute transporter alpha-beta; TJs, tight
  junctions. ↓, down-regulation after administration of polysaccharides; ↑, up-regulation
  after administration of polysaccharides'
