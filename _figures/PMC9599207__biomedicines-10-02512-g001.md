caption: Core components of the Hippo pathway in human cells. When the Hippo pathway
  is ON, MST1/2 and SAV1 in complex phosphorylate LATS1/2 and MOB1/2. Activated LATS1/2
  then phosphorylate YAP1 and TAZ, leading to YAP1/TAZ cytoplasmic retention or ubiquitin-mediated
  proteasomal degradation. On the other hand, when the Hippo pathway is OFF, dephosphorylated
  YAP1/TAZ translocate into the nucleus, where they bind with TEADs to induce the
  transcription of downstream target genes involved in cell growth and survival.
