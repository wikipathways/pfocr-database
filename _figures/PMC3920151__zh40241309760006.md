caption: Schematic overview of the role of macrophage-localized Alox15/PPARγ pathway
  in the development of l-NAME-induced hypertension. In WT mice (left), Alox15 (12/15-LO)
  generates endogenous PPARγ agonists 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (15-HETE) or
  13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (13-HODE) from arachidonic acid (AA) or linoleic
  acid (LA), respectively, which activate PPARγ, increasing the expression of PPARγ-regulated
  genes such as CD36 and l-NAME-induced hypertension. Hypertension develops. Genetic
  disruption of the Alox15 gene (middle) eliminates the synthesis of these PPARγ agonists,
  which downregulates PPARγ and PPARγ-regulated genes like CD36. Hypertension does
  not occur with l-NAME. In Alox15−/− mice (right), externally added PPARγ agonists
  such as thioglycollate, 15-HETE/13-HODE, or other unknown compounds dramatically
  upregulate both PPARγ and PPARγ-regulated genes like CD36, restoring the development
  of l-NAME hypertension. NO, nitric oxide; LO, lipoxygenase.
