caption: Highlighting the neuroprotective role of neuropeptide Y in Parkinson’s disease.
  NPY exhibits its significant nerve cell protective action upon interacting with
  DA-forming cells by means of Y2R. NPY stimulates the two, namely the Akt signaling
  pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway and contributes to the enhanced viability
  of DA-forming nerve cells of the nigral area of the encephalon. In addition, NPY
  exerts its nerve cell protective action by suppressing the microglia, which in turn
  suppresses the NO formation and IL-1β liberation, and finally results in the suppression
  of inflammation. Furthermore, NPY, via stimulating the PI3K-XBP1s-Bip/GRP78 signaling
  pathway, suppresses the ER stress-provoked nerve cell demise, and ultimately contributes
  to neuroprotection. Moreover, therapy with the assistance of NPY de-escalated the
  stimulation/operation of caspase-3 and caspase-4, which consequently suppressed
  the programmed cell death and ER stress-triggered nerve cell demise and contributed
  to nerve cell protection in PD. Subtraction symbol indicates inhibitory/suppressing
  action, while addition symbol indicates stimulatory action. NPY, neuropeptide Y;
