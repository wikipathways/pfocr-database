caption: An overview of the mechanisms of pyroptosis. In the canonical pathway, PAMPs
  and DAMPs receive signaling molecule stimulation and assemble with pro-caspase-1
  and ASC to form inflammasomes and active caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 cleaves
  GSDMD into GSDMD-N and GDSMD-C and lyses the precursors of IL-1β and IL-18 (pro-ILβ
  and pro-IL-18, respectively). GSDMD-N perforates the cell membrane by forming non-selective
  pores, further causing water influx and cell swelling and bursting. In addition,
  IL-1β and IL-18 are secreted from the pores formed by GSDMD-N. In the noncanonical
  pathway, LPS activates caspase-4/5 and caspase-11, triggering pyroptosis by cleaving
  GSDMD. In addition, the cleavage of GSDMD results in efflux of K+, ultimately giving
  rise to the assembly of an NLRP3 inflammasome. In the caspase-3-mediated pathway,
  active caspase-3 cleaves GSDME to form GSDME-N, inducing cell pyroptosis. In the
  caspase-8-mediated pathway, inhibiting TAK1 induces the activation of caspase-8,
  which cleaves GSDMD or GSDME and results in pyroptosis.
