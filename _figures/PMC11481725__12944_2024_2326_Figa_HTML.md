caption: 'The protective effect of brown adipose tissue on cardiomyocytes after myocardial
  infarction: in I/R injury, BAT secretes BMP3B protein and miRNA to regulate the
  TGF-β pathway in cardiac muscle cells to exert myocardial protective effects; in
  myocardial remodeling, cardiac muscle cell could receiving the signal communication
  from batokines like 12,13 diHOME and FGF21. These Batokines all have been proven
  to be produced by BAT in animal models of chronic myocardial remodeling'
