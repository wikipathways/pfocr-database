caption: Model for the meiotic elimination of the M-pal by the MRN and Rec12-dependent
  pathways. (A) MRN-dependent pathway. During premeiotic S phase, the M-pal extrudes
  on the lagging DNA strand, generating a hairpin (). The MRN complex recognizes and
  cleaves the hairpin. Cleaveage by the MRN complex could happen at the base of the
  stem, thus generating a homologous 3′-end ready for strand invasion. Alternatively,
  the MRN complex could cleave inside the hairpin, generating a heterologous 3′-end
  that needs to be removed by Rad16/Swi10 to allow the subsequent steps of recombination.
  In the presence of the rad50S allele at 25°, cleavage of the hairpin is severely
  impaired but subsequent processing of the DSB is active. In the presence of the
  rad32-D65N allele, cleavage of the hairpin is eliminated, and it is unknown whether
  DSB end processing is inhibited. These MRN-dependent DSBs are likely the lesions
  responsible for generating the Rec12-independent Ade+ recombinants. The MRN-dependent
  DSBs may also recombine with the newly synthesized sister chromatid, as indicated
  by the dashed arrow, and therefore may not generate an observable recombinant. (B)
  Rec12-dependent pathway. DNA in the vicinity of the M-pal is devoid of nucleosomes
  (cross-hatched circles) perhaps upon extrusion of the M-pal. This allows Rec12 to
  introduce DSBs in the vicinity of the hairpin after premeiotic DNA synthesis. The
  rad50S allele at 25° has negligible effects on this pathway as observed in crosses
  involving either the SI control allele or the M26 hotspot (, , and ). In the presence
  of the rad32-D65N allele (or the rad50S allele at 34°), processing of Rec12-generated
  DSBs in ade6 and elsewhere in the genome is blocked and spore formation is severely
  defective.
