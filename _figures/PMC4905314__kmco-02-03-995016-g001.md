caption: ER stress induced by oncogenic BRAF and modulation of basal autophagy in
  melanoma. Oncogenic serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf carrying the V>E mutation
  (BRAFV600E) stimulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through the involvement
  of at least 3 major factors, glucose-regulated protein 78kDa (GRP78), eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 14
  (p38). Through direct interaction with GRP78, mutant BRAF relieves its inhibitory
  activity toward the 3 stress sensors, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6),
  inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1), and double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase
  (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and thus inducing the unfolded protein
  response (UPR). Stimulation of the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathway drives
  phosphorylation of the translational factor eIF4E, hyperstimulating the translational
  signaling pathway and resulting in protein accumulation in the ER compartment; activation
  of p38 (through protein phosphorylation) drives the activation of the above mentioned
  ER stress sensors, resulting in UPR. ER stress in turn enhances the activity of
  the autophagic process through the PERK/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)/mammalian
  homolog of Drosophila tribbles (TRB3) and the IRE1/TNF receptor-associated factor
  2 (TRAF2)/apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
  axes. In the first signaling pathway (B), active PERK phosphorylates the eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), a factor controlling the initiation of
  cap-dependent protein translation, thus stimulating the IRES-dependent translational
  process. This favors accumulation of the transcription factor ATF4 that in turn
  stimulates the synthesis of TRB3, which induces the autophagic process through inhibition
  of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. In parallel (A), active IRE1 recruits
  and activates the cytosolic kinase ASK1 through the adapter molecule TRAF2, which
  in turn activates JNK. The latter phosphorylates the BECLIN 1 (BECN1) inhibitory
  partners B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and BCL2-like 1 isoform 1 (BCL-XL), resulting
  in BECN1 release and subsequent autophagy induction. Therefore, mutant BRAF-mediated
  dysregulation of prosurvival pathways such as ER stress and autophagy sustains tumor
  development and progression, and desensitizes cancer cells to therapy-induced apoptosis
  (CHEMOs).
