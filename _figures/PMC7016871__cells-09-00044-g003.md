caption: Mechanisms of calcium- and calcineurin-mediated podocyte injury. The podocyte
  protein synaptopodin is an actin associated protein that plays a role in stabilizing
  the podocyte cytoskeleton. Synaptopodin is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA)
  and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which promotes 14-3-3
  binding and protects synaptopodin from degradation by cathepsin L. Calcineurin dephosphorylates
  synaptopodin, which permits its degradation by cathepsin L and, in turn, destabilizes
  the actin cytoskeleton and promotes proteinuria. Calcineurin also causes podocyte
  apoptosis. The mechanisms of calcineurin-induced apoptosis are incompletely understood,
  but both BAD (Bcl-2-associated death promoter) and Drp1 (dynamin-related protein
  1) play a role in preclinical disease models. Similar to synaptopodin, BAD is phosphorylated
  at a 14-3-3 docking site by Akt, which inhibits its activity. Calcineurin dephosphorylates
  BAD and induces apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway. Drp1 is phosphorylated and
  inhibited by PKA. Dephosphorylation of Drp1 by calcineurin promotes apoptosis by
  inducing mitochondrial fragmentation. Lastly, recent studies suggest that the calcium-activated
  cysteine protease calpain plays a key role in promoting podocyte injury. Calpain
  degrades numerous cytoskeletal proteins including the large cytoskeletal protein
  talin-1. Calpain-induced talin-1 degradation destabilizes the podocyte cytoskeleton
  and impairs glomerular filtration barrier integrity.
