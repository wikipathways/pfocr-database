caption: 'Effects of sulforaphane on Nrf2 and NF-κB pathways. After sulforaphane enters
  the cell, it can interact with many different proteins, directly modulating numerous
  cellular pathways. Nrf2 pathway: Keap1/Nrf2 pathway is one of the most important
  pathways affected by sulforaphane that is responsible for antioxidant response and
  xenobiotic metabolism (left panel). Nrf2 is repressed by Keap1 and degraded by the
  proteasome under basal conditions, but when Keap1 regulatory cytosines are oxidized,
  Nrf2 is released and post-translationally modified to be translocated into the nucleus
  and dimerize with small Maf proteins. Nrf2 can then bind to antioxidant response
  elements, namely AREs. Also, sulforaphane can oxidize some important regulatory
  cytosines from Keap1, allowing Nrf2 cytosolic accumulation and nuclear importing.
  NF-κB pathway: NF-κB is also an important pathway regulated by sulforaphane. It
  is in charge of inflammatory response regulation. Under basal conditions, NF-κB
  is sequestrated into the cytosol by IκB, but when pro-inflammatory ligands bind
  to its receptors, the IKK protein family phosphorylates IκB to degrade it via proteasome,
  so NF-κB is able to translocate into the nucleus and transcript several inflammatory
  mediators. Sulforaphane is capable to inhibit IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB nuclear
  translocation, although the exact mechanism of action is not fully known'
