caption: 'The astounding assortment of MIAs found in some prominent medicinal plants.
  MIAs are mainly derived from a single common intermediate, strictosidine, which
  is the product of the condensation reaction between tryptamine (derived from the
  decarboxylation of tryptophan by TDC) and secologanin (derived from the iridoid
  pathway). TDC: tryptophan decarboxylase, STR: strictosidine synthase.'
