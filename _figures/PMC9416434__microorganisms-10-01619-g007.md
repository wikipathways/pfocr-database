caption: Genome-based pathway prediction for PS degradation in Exiguobacterium sp.
  RIT 594. (a) PS is presumably depolymerized to styrene and then metabolized via
  phenylacetic acid (PAA). The initial steps are unknown (question marks) and the
  genes corresponding to the enzyme activities predicted from the genome annotations
  are shown in bold italics. (b) The paa gene cluster showing the arrangement of genes
  and the location in the genome (114,849–125,256 nt). * = alternate start at 114,872
  nt. paa1 = phenylacetate-CoA ligase, paa2 = 1,2-phenylacetyl-CoA epoxidase subunit
  A, paa3 = 1,2-phenylacetyl-CoA epoxidase subunit B (paaH), paa4 = phenylacetate-CoA
  oxygenase subunit (paaI), paa5 = phenylacetate-CoA oxygenase subunit (paaJ), paa6
  = EthD family reductase, paa7 = enoyl-CoA hydratase, paa8 = aldehyde dehydrogenase,
  paa9 = 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, paa10 = acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase, paa11
  = enoyl-CoA hydratase, and paa12 = paa degradation operon negative regulatory protein
  (paaX). The thioesterase is located separately at 114,128–114,523 nt. The gene names
  in parentheses indicate the nomenclature used for E. coli K12. The enzymes for styrene
  epoxide/phenylethanol generation and oxidation to phenylacetaldehyde are missing
  (indicated by “?”).
