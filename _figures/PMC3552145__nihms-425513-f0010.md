caption: PGN-induced miR-132 and miR-212 in TLR signaling. (A–B) A schematic summary
  of PGN-mediated induction of miR-132 and miR-212 targeting IRAK4 in tolerized and
  untolerized THP-1 monocytes. (C) LPS, PGN, and flagellin from bacterial infection
  bind to their respective TLRs and activate the MyD88-dependent pathway. This eventually
  leads to gene transcription with the production of TNF-α and other cytokines. The
  MyD88 pathway leads to activation of NF-kB and production of miR-146a whereas activation
  of CREB leads to miR-132/-212 production. miR-132/-212 targets IRAK4 whereas miR-146a
  targets IRAK2/1 and TRAF6. IRAK4 and IRAK2/1 are critical components of the myddosome
  which is in turn critical for activation of the MyD88-dependent pathway.
