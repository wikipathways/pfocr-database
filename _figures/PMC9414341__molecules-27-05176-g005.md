caption: A possible biosynthetic pathway starting from tryptamine and secologanin
  leads on the one hand in a Pictet Spengler reaction to strictosidine, which is not
  accumulated in the plant (step b) and then quantitatively converted in step c to
  accumulated strictosamide (1). Alternative to step a, an oxidation of position 2
  in tryptamine can lead to the biosynthesis of paratunamide C (8), which can subsequently
  react further to nauclealomide B (6) and nauclealomide C (7) as described by [].
  Furthermore, starting from strictosamide (1), on the other hand, epi-pumiloside
  (5) (step d) and subsequently 10-hydroxy epi-pumiloside (4) can arise according
  to []. A comparable oxidation of 1 leads to 10-hydroxy strictosamide (2) as well
  as to the epimeric 10-hydroxy vincoside lactam (3) in step f. The other alkaloids
  can be formed by deglucosylation. In this pathway, compound 1a is probable intermediate
  within step f, which is, however, not accumulated due to its reactivity. In the
  isolated secondary follow-up products 9 to 13 have a pyridine moiety present, which
  maybe formed in a cyclization, likely similar to those in the Kröhnke reaction [].
  In particular, structural variations can be seen in the bonds C-3—C-14 and C-18—C-19,
  which can result from dehydrogenation (step h) and addition of H2O (step g). Possible
  epimerization leading to inversion at position 3, hence leading to the stereochemistry
  of compounds 3, 4, and 5, which is discussed in .
