caption: Metabolic pathway map indicating the steps of end product formation by L.
  monocytogenes (based on data from the KEGG database). End product compounds that
  may be formed during the growth of L. monocytogenes are indicated in boxes. Genes
  coding corresponding enzymes conducting biochemical transformation are indicated.
  Thick, black-arrowed lines indicate that the expression of gene(s) for the given
  enzymatic step was increased by SD treatment. Arrowed lines in gray indicate that
  the expression of gene(s) that was increased by SD treatment for the given enzymatic
  step was strain dependent (Table ). The dashed line indicates an enzymatic process
  suppressed by SD treatment; thin lines indicate processes unaffected or only weakly
  affected by SD treatment. BCAA, branched-chain amino acids.
