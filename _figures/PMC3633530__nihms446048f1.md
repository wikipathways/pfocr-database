caption: Generic schematic of siderophore-mediated iron uptake and genetic regulation
  in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Iron metabolism in bacteria is under
  genetic control by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) transcription factor protein.
  During times of iron abundance, the Fur protein complexes Fe(II) and adopts a conformation
  that binds to a region of DNA known as a ‘Fur box’ which represses the expression
  of siderophore-related proteins, including biosynthetic enzymes. During times of
  iron deficiency, the apo-Fur protein dissociates from the ‘Fur box’ allowing expression
  of siderophore-related genes. The siderophore system is now fully functional and
  begins with siderophore biosynthesis and efflux to the extracellular environment.
  For Gram-negative bacteria, after the siderophore chelates Fe(III) to form a soluble
  complex it is transported into the periplasm by a high affinity outer membrane transport
  protein (OMT; formerly called OMR). This transport is driven by the proton motive
  force with energy transfer mediated by the membrane-spanning TonB-ExbB/D protein
  complex. The Fe(III)-loaded siderophore is then bound by a siderophore periplasmic
  binding protein (SPBP) and trafficked to an ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC)
  that moves the siderophore-Fe(III) complex into the cytoplasm. The iron nutrient
  is then removed from the siderophore, typically via reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II)
  by an iron reductase enzyme (Red), and is distributed to parts of the cell in need
  or stored in bacterioferritin. In most cases, the siderophore is then recycled for
  further use. Gram-positive bacteria lack the outer membrane found in Gram-negative
  bacteria and therefore also lack the OMTs and TonB complex. Instead, extracellular
  siderophore-Fe(III) complexes are recognized and transported by membrane-anchored
  SPBPs. The remaining steps of the siderophore pathway in Gram-positive bacteria
  are analogous to those described for Gramnegative bacteria. This figure was inspired
  by a variety of siderophore transport diagrams reported in the literature which
  also describe these pathways in great detail.(–)
