caption: Regulated fatty acid synthesis and metabolism during cell differentiation.
  A, IPA links ceramide synthesis with the fatty acid metabolic pathway from differential
  protein expression analysis data. B, an outlined pathway of the fatty acid synthesis
  and metabolism induced by PMA. C, ceramide levels in U937 cells treated with a series
  of concentrations of PMA for 72 h. PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen.
