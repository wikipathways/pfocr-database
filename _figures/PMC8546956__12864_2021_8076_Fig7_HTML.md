caption: Biosynthesis of anthocyanins and glucosinolates in three Brassicaceae vegetables
  under shade. a Schematic pathway of anthocyanins biosynthesis and the expression
  of genes (CHS and CHI) involved in this pathway in response to shade treatments
  (1 and 6 h). b Schematic pathway of glucosinolates biosynthesis and the expression
  of genes (IPMI2, CYP79B2, CYP83A1, SUR1, and UGT74B1) involved in this pathway in
  response to shade treatments (1 and 6 h). CS, Choy Sum; KL, Kai Lan; PC, Pak Choy;
  CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; IPMI2, isopropylmalate isomerase
  2; CYP79B2, cytochrome p450 79B2; CYP83A1, cytochrome p450 83A1; SUR1, superroot
  1; UGT74B1, UDP-glucosyltransferase 74B1. c A graphical overview indicates the general
  and distinguished SAS in three Brassicaceae vegetables. This highlights that auxin,
  BR, and ethylene function as common SAS hormones in these vegetables. In addition,
  Kai Lan also activates its unique auxin-related genes while Pak Choy quickly induces
  GA-signaling genes in response to shade. HFR1, LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED 1; KDR,
  KIDARI. Scale bar color corresponds to row Z-score
