caption: BRAF-mediated signaling in normal and cancer cells. In normal cells, external
  growth stimuli activate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and RAS, which relays growth
  signals to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway kinase cascade. In
  BRAF-driven cancers, mutant BRAF (BRAF *) can either act RAS independently as a
  monomer (Class 1) and as a dimer (Class 2) or act RAS dependently (Class 3) to hyperactivate
  cellular growth. Class 1 and Class 2 tumors respond to BRAF inhibitor-targeted therapy.
  However, various intrinsic or adaptive resistance mechanisms attenuate response
  to targeted BRAF inactivation. For example, preexisting NF1 loss, CDK4 mutations,
  and increased COT and YAP expression may specify intrinsic resistance. Therapy-induced
  HGF secretion and PI3K-AKT pathway activation are examples of some of the adaptive
  resistance mechanisms. On the other hand, EGFR-amplified population gives rise to
  acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.
