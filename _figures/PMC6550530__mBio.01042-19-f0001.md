caption: Csr system in V. cholerae. (A) The two-component system VarS and VarA regulates
  the activity of CsrA. The inner membrane protein VarS is a sensor kinase that activates
  VarA via phosphorylation. Activated VarA binds to the promoters of three small RNAs,
  namely, CsrB, CsrC, and CsrD (CsrB/C/D, or the Csr sRNAs), to induce their transcription;
  the portion of the Csr sRNA promoters indicated in green represents the VarA recognition
  sequence. When expressed, CsrB/C/D act to sequester CsrA, antagonizing the activity
  of CsrA. The data determined in the present study indicate that CsrA directly binds
  to varA mRNA to positively regulate protein expression, introducing a regulatory
  feedback loop in the Var/Csr pathway in V. cholerae. (B) The RNA folding program
  mFold was used to generate the secondary structures of CsrB/C/D. The GGA CsrA-binding
  sites are highlighted by the red lettering.
