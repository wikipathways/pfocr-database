caption: Summary diagram showing the proposed mechanism by which nitric oxide (NO)
  generated by NO donors or neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) increases the heart
  rate response to vagal nerve stimulation. NO stimulates presynaptic soluble guanylyl
  cyclase (sGC) to produce cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP) which inhibits phosphodiesterase
  3 (PDE 3). This elevates intracellular cyclic adenine monophosphate (cAMP, synthesized
  by adenylyl cyclase, AC) levels and increases the protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent
  phosphorylation of N-type calcium channels. Both N- and P-type calcium currents
  (ICa,N and ICa,P) control the exocytotic release of acetylcholine (ACh). Postsynaptically,
  ACh binds to muscarinic cholinergic (M2) receptors on sino-atrial node pacemaker
  cells and via several second messenger pathways reduces the L-type calcium current
  (ICa,L) and hyperpolarization-activated current (If), and increases the acetylcholine-dependent
  potassium current (IK,Ach) to decrease heart rate.
