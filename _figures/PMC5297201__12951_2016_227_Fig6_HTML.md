caption: Schematic representation of intracellular uptake of anthocyanin loaded PEGylated
  NPs by SH-SY5Y cell via endocytosis; inside the cellular cytoplasm, the endosome
  is broken down by lysosomal enzymes and the drug is released in the cytoplasm and
  reverts the Aβ1–42-induced Aβ pathology by abrogating ROS generation via the P38-MAPK/JNK
  pathways accompanied by induction of endogenous nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1)
