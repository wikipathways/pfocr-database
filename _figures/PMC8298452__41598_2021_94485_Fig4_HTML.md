caption: Functional annotations of AS events. (A) A KEGG enrichment analysis of the
  genes that were significantly related to overall survival. The AS events, such as
  ES, AP, RI, and ME, were the top 4 AS events that showed significant correlation
  with genes related to overall survival prognoses. (B) The KEGG enrichment results
  for the AS genes with the highest values for gene significance. AS events are closed
  linked to various biological functions. The results indicated that the ES and ME
  events are involved in complex pathway interactions, such as those related to nuclear,
  cancer, and immune cell pathways, among others.
