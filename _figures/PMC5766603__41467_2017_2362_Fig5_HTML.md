caption: Phenylephrine synthesis. a–c Three routes are depicted for the synthesis
  of the phenylephrine from benzoate derivatives. Each route is color coded to differentiate
  the route by choice of precursor and overall conversion. In addition, the precursor
  and target molecules are colored to depict moiety translocation. Known reactions
  are indicated by solid lines while reactions suggested using reaction rules are
  denoted with dashed lines. Every hypothetical reaction step is indexed with a reaction
  rule id (see Table  for description). The structure for pyruvate (pyr), acetaldehyde
  (acald), acetate, carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), formate
  (fma), S-adenosyl-l-methionine (adm), S-adenosyl homocysteine (adh), ascorbic acid
  (asc), dehydroascorbic acid (dhasc), tetrahydrobiopterin (tdh), and 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin
  (dhb) are not shown for clarity purpose
