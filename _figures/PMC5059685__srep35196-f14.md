caption: 'ER stress response could effectively sensitize human esophageal cancer to
  TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via TRAILRs and AMPK pathway. Details are as follows: ①
  Induction of ER stress with thapsigargin increases the CHOP expression, and then
  CHOP upregulates DR5 by combining to CHOP-binding site. Upregulation of DR5 improves
  the receptor number which could bond more TRAIL in ESCC cells. ② TRAIL/DR5 binding
  induced ESCC cells apoptosis mediated by ROS via AMPK phosphorylation. ③ Induction
  of ER stress can directly activate AMPK phosphorylation, which play an efficient
  role against ESCC cells. ESCC, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; THA, thapsigargin;
  ERS, endoplasmic reticulum stress; CHOP, C/EBP-homologous protein; DR5 (i.e., Apo2),
  death receptor 5; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand; AMPK, adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species.'
