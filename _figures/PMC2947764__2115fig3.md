caption: Lymph nodes are the most common site for the metastatic spread of tumor cells,
  and tumor propagation to lymph nodes is one of the main prognostic indicators. As
  tumor cells reach the sentinel lymph node, they will spread into distant lymph nodes
  and other organs. (A) One of the mechanisms of tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis
  involves the release of VEGF-C or VEGF-D by tumor cells or TAMs, stimulating the
  growth of additional peritumoral (and, in some cases, also intratumoral) lymphatic
  vessels and the dilation of pre-existing lymphatic vessels. This in turn facilitates
  the entry of tumor cells into the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, possibly via interactions
  between tumor cells and LECs. Therefore, inhibition of tumor lymphangiogenesis by
  blocking the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling pathway could be an efficient approach aimed
  to suppress lymph node metastasis. (B) Lymph node lymphangiogenesis has also been
  shown recently to promote tumor metastasis. In this case, growth factors such as
  VEGF-C or VEGF-A produced by the primary tumor can act at a distance by inducing
  lymphangiogenesis in the sentinel lymph node prior to the arrival of the first metastatic
  cells and, eventually, promoting additional cancer metastasis to distant lymph nodes
  and organs.
