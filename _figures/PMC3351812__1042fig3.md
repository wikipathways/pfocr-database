caption: 'Scenario for seipin function. A: Wild-type cells. Seipin regulates droplet
  formation by coupling TAG synthesis to droplet filling. This may involve interaction
  with DGAT or upstream enzymes in the pathway. In preadipocytes, the ER probably
  generates a ligand that activates adipogenesis through PPARγ. B: Seipin-deficient
  cells. In the absence of seipin, neutral lipid accumulates in the ER and has pleotropic
  effects on ER membrane function: lipid biosynthetic enzymes are dysregulated and
  the PPARγ ligand fails to be produced in sufficient amounts, or a receptor toxin
  such as PA is produced. Overproduced TAG leads to ectopic LDs that are functionally
  defective.'
