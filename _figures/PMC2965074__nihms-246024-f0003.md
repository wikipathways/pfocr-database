caption: 'Distinct modes of IKK complex activity transduce TNF and IL-1 signaling
  to NF-κB: Our findings verify that TNF-induced IκBα degradation and classical NF-κB
  activation is critically dependent upon NEMO and IKKβ (left). Similarly IL-1 signaling
  absolutely requires intact NEMO (right). However, IL-1-induced IκBα degradation,
  NF-κB nuclear translocation and NF-κB transcriptional activity occurs in the absence
  of IKKβ demonstrating that NEMO and IKKα can form a signaling complex capable of
  activating the classical NF-κB pathway in response to certain pro-inflammatory stimuli
