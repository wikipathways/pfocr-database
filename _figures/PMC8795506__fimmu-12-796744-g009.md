caption: Schematic representation of MSCs overexpressing ACE2 favorably ameliorate
  LPS-induced inflammatory injury in mammary epithelial cells (Charting with BioRender.com
  software). 1 µg/mL of LPS concentration treated with EpH4-Ev for 9 h caused significant
  cell injury, activated MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, promoted the release of inflammatory
  factors TNF-α, IL-Iβ, IL-6, iNOS, inhibited cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis,
  disrupted blood-milk barrier and aggravated mammary epithelial cells injury. Co-culture
  with MSC, MSC-GFP or MSC-ACE2 reversed LPS-induced mammary epithelial cells injury,
  inhibited MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, activated IL-10/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway,
  promoted cells proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, promoted tight junction protein
  expression and promoted blood-milk barrier repair, and MSC-ACE2 showed better anti-inflammatory
  and anti-injury effects than MSC and MSC-GFP.
