caption: Schematic of therapeutic targets of the AR pathway. 1) AR is bound to the
  molecular chaparonin HSP90 which prevents its degradation. HSP90 inhibitors, such
  as 17-AAG, cause AR degradation and decrease AR levels. 2) In men treated with GnRH
  agonists to shut down testicular androgen synthesis, residual serum androgens are
  synthesized by the adrenal glands. In additional, evidence suggests intratumoral
  androgen synthesis. Both can be inhibited by the non-specific p450 inhibitor ketoconazole
  and the 17-lyase inhibitor abiraterone. 3) Testosterone is converted to the more
  potent dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5α-reductase, which is inhibited by finasteride
  and dutasteride. 4) Ligands, such as DHT bind to AR and this is inhibited by antiandrogens
  such as bicalutamide and novel agents MDV-3100 and BMS641988. Mutation of AR as
  well as AR overexpression can convert endogenous steroids (e.g., progestins, estrogens,
  corticosteroids) and some antiandrogens into agonists. MDV-3100 was designed to
  suppress AR function even when AR is overexpressed. 5) Activation of receptor tyrosine
  kinases, in particular HER2, can lead to downstream AR activation. Two downstream
  kinases that directly phosphorylate AR on tyrosine are Ack1 and SRC. Other downstream
  pathways of receptor tyrosine kinases, including the AKT and MAP kinase pathways,
  are also implicated. Antibodies such as trastuzamab and pertuzumab and small molecular
  TKI inhibitors such as erlotinib and lapatinib target HER2. Dasatinib target SRC.
  6) Proper transcription mediated by AR requires the proper chromatin state. HDAC
  inhibitors inhibit transcription of AR target genes by disruption of chromatin structure
  and inhibition of recruitment of coactivators and RNA polymerase II.
