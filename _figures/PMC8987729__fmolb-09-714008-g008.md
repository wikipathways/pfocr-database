caption: 'An inferred cardiac gene regulatory network underlying the transcriptomic
  differences between differentiation protocols. Two sets of regulators are displayed,
  miRNAs (miR-200c in rectangle) and cardiac TFs (in diamonds). The proposed regulatory
  relationships between miR-200c or TFs and target genes are indicated by blue and
  green edges, respectively. Oval nodes correspond to target genes involved in various
  cardiac biological processes: Orange—contraction; White—mitochondria/metabolism;
  Yellow—electrophysiology and calcium handling. Up-regulated genes are shown with
  red borders.'
