caption: 'Proposed mechanism of action of 20-HETE.Notes: Mitogens and ligands of G-protein-coupled
  receptors activate PLA2 and induce release of arachidonic acid, which is converted
  by CYP4A/F to 20-HETE. Then, 20-HETE, acting presumably via Src, promotes tyrosine
  phosphorylation of EGFR and consequently activates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade,
  which leads to the proliferation of cancer cells. One of cytoplasmic targets of
  ERK is I-kappaB kinase-alpha, which phosphorylates I-kappaB-alpha, resulting in
  the degradation of I-kappaB-alpha by the proteosome and the translocation of NFκB
  to the nucleus, where it positively regulates the transcription of a number of genes
  involved in immune and inflammatory responses including vEGF. In addition, 20-HETE
  also activates cAMP-dependent PKA-phosphorylase kinase-GP (glycogen phosphorylase
  pathway) to induce hyperglycemia. Besides, 20-HETE stimulates NADPH oxidase-derived
  superoxide production, which activates L-type Ca2+ channels via a PKC-dependent
  mechanism. Inhibitory interactions are shown by red lines with bars. Stimulatory
  interactions are shown by green lines with arrows. Activation of the principal signaling
  cascade is shown by +.Abbreviations: 20-HETE, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; GPCR,
