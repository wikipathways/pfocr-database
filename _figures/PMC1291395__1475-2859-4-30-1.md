caption: Metabolic network of the central cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism of
  S. cerevisiae investigated in the present work. The network comprises glycolysis,
  pentose phosphate pathway, anaplerotic carboxylation, fermentative pathways, inter-compartmental
  transport of acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, and oxaloacetate, respectively, TCA cycle, malic
  enzyme and anabolic reactions from intermediary metabolites into anabolism.
