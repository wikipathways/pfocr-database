caption: Lipophagy promotes spermatogenesis in Sertoli cells and regulates the synthesis
  of testosterone in Leydig cells. (A) During spermatogenesis, apoptotic germ cells
  (AGCs) and residual bodies (RBs) are phagocytosed by Sertoli cells by the SR-BI/PS
  (Class B scavenger receptor type I / Phosphatide) system or TAM/Gas 6 (Translocation
  and assembly module/Growth arrest-specific 6) system. The lipid droplets can release
  from the breakdown of engulfed AGCs and RBs. In this condition, most LDs fused with
  the lysosome to form phagolysosome to generate energy for Sertoli cells, which further
  supports germ cell and spermatogenesis. While, minor LDs can have an LC3 accumulation
  signal and then fuse with the lysosome to produce ATP for energy support. PS, a
  type of phospholipid. LD, lipid droplet. Bigger arrow, a major pathway to degrade
  LDs in Sertoli cells. Smaller arrow, a minor pathway to degrade LDs in Sertoli cells.
  (B) LDs are composed of cholesteryl ester and triglycerides, which are localized
  in the Leydig cells. In normal conditions, lipophagy can degrade cholesterol esters
  into free cholesterol, an essential substrate for testosterone synthesis. When autophagy
  deficient, the substrate of testosterone will decrease due to the failure of lipophagy.
