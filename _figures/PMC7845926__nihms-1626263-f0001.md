caption: 'JAK/STAT pathway involving receptors lacking intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity:
  Upon ligand binding, transmembrane cytokine receptors multimerize, bringing receptor-associated
  JAKs into close physical proximity. Once activated via transphosphorylation, JAKs
  phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor to provide a docking site for
  STAT. The bound STATs are then phosphorylated and activated by JAKs. Activated STATs
  dimerize and translocate into the nucleus where act as transcription factors. Suppressors
  of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of proteins inhibit JAK activation; cytokine-inducible
  SH2-containing protein (CIS) blocks the STAT docking site on the receptor; Protein
  inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) proteins inhibit STAT binding to promoter regions
  of target genes; and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptors (PTPRs) dephosphorylate
  STATs. JAKs: Janus kinases; STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription'
