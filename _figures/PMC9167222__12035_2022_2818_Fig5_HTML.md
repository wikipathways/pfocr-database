caption: Graphic representation of the results. The activity-dependent signaling between
  the nerve terminals that are in competition through several metabotropic receptors
  can result in the modulation of the downstream effector kinases, specifically cPKCβI,
  nPKCε, and PKA. Changes in kinases activity can allow the coordinate phosphorylation
  of the L-type CaV1.3 and P/Q-type VGCC. The high calcium entry through these operative
  channels present in immature nerve endings can result in their final loss. Also,
  muscle CaV1.1 and contractile activity can contribute to the synapse elimination.
  A component of this mechanism may be mediated by a retrograde influence from the
  postsynaptic site, via the BDNF-TrkB pathway, on the presynaptic calcium channels
