caption: Arrows show the known and predicted steps for glucosinolate biosynthesis
  with the gene name for each biochemical reaction within the arrow. For compounds
  that are undetected intermediates, chemical names only are provided. For detected
  compounds, both the structure and chemical name are provided. The position of known
  genetic loci controlling biosynthetic variation is shown in italics.(A) The pathway
  and genes responsible for the production of the core glucosinolate structure from
  tryptophan (indolic glucosinolates) and methionine (aliphatic glucosinolates).(B)
  The chain elongation cycle for aliphatic glucosinolate production. Each cycle of
  these reactions adds a single carbon to a 2-oxo-acid, which is then transaminated
  to generate homo-methionine for aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis. The GSL.Elong
  QTL alters this cycle through variation at the MAM1, MAM2, and MAM3 genes that leads
  to differential glucosinolate structure and content [].(C) The enzymes and genetic
  loci controlling aliphatic glucosinolate side chain modification within the Bay-0
  × Sha RIL population. Side-chain modification is controlled by variation at the
  GSL.ALK QTL via cis-eQTLs at the AOP2 and AOP3 genes. The Cvi and Sha accessions
  express AOP2 to produce alkenyl glucosinolates. In contrast, the Ler and Bay-0 accessions
  express AOP3 to produce hydroxyl glucosinolates. Col-0 is null for both AOP2 and
  AOP3, producing only the precursor methylsulfinyl glucosinolates []. The GSL.OX
  QTL appears to be controlled by cis-eQTLs regulating flavin-monoxygenase enzymes
  that oxygenate a methylthio to methylsulfinyl glucosinolate [].
