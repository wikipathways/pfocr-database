caption: 'Schematic representation of the proposed model of Gm28309 role in inflammation
  response. The recognition of Brucella by TLRs located on the host cell membrane
  repressed the expression of lncRNA Gm28309. The decrease of Gm28309 has two effects,
  both resulting in the activation of the NF-κB pathway: On one side, expression of
  TGF-β is promoted, leading to a cascade of TAK1 and IKK kinases promoting p65 phosphorylation.
  On the other side, miR-3068-5p, which is normally sponged by Gm28309, is released
  in the cytoplasm, where it targets κB-Ras2 for degradation, thereby inducing p65
  phosphorylation. The activation of the NF-κB pathway promotes the assembly of the
  NLRP3 inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 to intracellular bacterial
  infection.'
