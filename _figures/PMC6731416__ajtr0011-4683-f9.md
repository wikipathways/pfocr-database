caption: Proposed model for the roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulated by quercetin
  in protection of BBB breakdown. In ischemic stroke, quercetin preteatment activates
  the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Quercetin increased the expression of β-catenin.
  Improved interaction of nuclear β-catenin then leads to the downregulation of GSK-3β
  and upregulation of Axin. Then LEF1, which is a downstream target gene of β-catenin,
  was upregulated resulting in alleviation of BBB breakdown and, concomitantly, MMP-9
  was downregulated resulting in tight-junction opening inhibition, which also leads
  to the alleviation of BBB dysfunction.
