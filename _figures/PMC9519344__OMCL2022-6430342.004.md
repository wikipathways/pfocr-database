caption: Work together to coordinate cardiomyocytes mitochondrial homeostasis, interaction
  of UPR with autophagy and mitophagy. The unfolded protein response (UPR) interacts
  with mitophagy and autophagy. Autophagy can form autophagosomes through the separation
  membrane initiated by wrapping cytoplasmic components (proteins and organelles)
  in cardiomyocytes inside the cell. These damaged or redundant proteins and organelles
  eventually fuse with lysosomes, which in turn are degraded. This process induces
  the activation of eIF2a and ATF4.Moreover, the accumulation of useless or damaged
  mitochondria in organelles also removes redundant or dysfunctional mitochondria
  by activating nonreceptor-mediated (PINK/Parkin) or receptor-mediated (FUNDC1) mitophagy.
  UPR can also coordinate with FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy under the activated state
  to jointly protect the mitochondria of cardiomyocytes under inflammation and maintain
  mitochondrial homeostasis. Mechanistically, deletion of autophagy genes may also
  induce UPR, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism. When the synergistic effect
  of mitochondrial UPR and mitophagy is dysregulated, it leads to dysregulation of
  cardiomyocyte homeostasis, activates cardiomyocyte mitochondrial dysfunction and
  mediates mitochondrial pathway apoptosis.
