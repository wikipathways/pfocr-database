caption: 'Pathways and networks enriched with cancer driver genes. A. Table of KEGG
  pathways enriched with genes with top 10% WVPR, which are classified into three
  groups: known cancer pathways, cell survival pathways and novel pathways. B. The
  core network of cancer driver genes. All genes are represented as circles. They
  are linked by lines with different colors representing interactions and regulation
  among them. C. A novel pathway of cancer, the members are location on mitochondrial
  inner membrane and involving oxidative phosphorylation (Pathway 2).'
