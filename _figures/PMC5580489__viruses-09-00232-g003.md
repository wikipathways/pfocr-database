caption: Host DNA damage response pathways. The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)
  and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) pathways are activated in response to damaged DNA
  signals, leading to cell cycle checkpoint arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis. ATM is
  activated by DNA double-strand breaks and initiates downstream response pathways
  through the phosphorylation of effector proteins, including CHK2 and DNA repair
  proteins BRCA1 and pSMC1. In addition to the repair of double-strand breaks, ATM
  is involved in G1/S, intra-S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoint controls, in part through
  its phosphorylation of p53. ATR responds to replication stress in the form of bulky
  lesions and the presence of single-stranded DNA at stalled replication forks. It
  also signals through the activation of specific effector proteins, such as CHK1
  and components of the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway. The ATM and ATR pathways facilitate
  DNA repair through the high-fidelity homologous recombination (HR) pathway. DNA
  double-strand breaks may also be repaired by the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK),
  which coordinates repair through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway.
