caption: Protein ubiquitination requires the sequential action of three classes of
  enzymes. First, ubiquitin (Ub) is activated in an ATP-dependent manner by ubiquitin-activating
  enzyme (E1). In this step, the C-terminus of ubiquitin is linked by a thioester
  bond to the active site Cys of E1 (E1~Ub). Ubiquitin is then transthiolated to the
  active site Cys of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), generating an E2~Ub thioester.
  Ubiquitin protein ligases (E3) interact with both E2~Ub and the substrate to which
  ubiquitin is to be transferred, thus providing much of the specificity in the ubiquitin
  system. HECT-type E3s function as covalent intermediates in the ubiquitination pathway
  as ubiquitin is first transferred to the active site Cys of E3 via a transthiolation
  before conjugation to substrate. RING-type E3s instead mediate the transfer of ubiquitin
  directly from E2~Ub to substrate. Ubiquitination generally occurs on primary amines
  (Lys, and, less frequently, a free N-terminus) as a consequence of nucleophillic
  attack on the E2~Ub linkage, resulting in stable isopeptide (or peptide) linkages
  with the C-terminus of ubiquitin. Monoubiquitination plays diverse roles in processes
  such as DNA repair, protein trafficking, and transcription [], and recent findings
  have demonstrated that multi-monoubiquitination can also target proteins for proteasomal
  degradation [, ]. Alternatively, ubiquitin can be transferred to one of the seven
  Lys (K) or the N-terminal Met of ubiquitin molecules [] (PDB 1UBQ) that are already
  substrate-linked, generating multi- or poly-ubiquitin chains. To a large extent,
  the nature of the ubiquitin linkages specifies the fate and function of the modified
  protein. For example, chains of four or more ubiquitins linked through K48 efficiently
  target proteins for proteasomal degradation []. Similarly, K11-linked chains are
  integral to proteasomal targeting of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)
  substrates [] and chains linked through other lysines may also play a role in proteasomal
  targeting [, ]. K63-linked and linear ubiquitin chains are implicated in non-proteasomal
  aspects of NF-κB signaling []. K63-linked chains and mono-ubiquitination are also
  implicated in DNA repair and the targeting of cell surface and endocytic proteins
  for lysosomal degradation [, ].
