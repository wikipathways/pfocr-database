caption: MiR-449a is induced in LNCaP cells following exposure to ionizing radiation.
  Elevated miR-449a represses c-Myc expression by by directly targeting the 3′-UTR
  of c-Myc mRNA. Cdc25A, as a mediatior of Myc function, is suppressed or degraded
  in response to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation, resulting in dramatical
  inhibition of pRb phosphorylation and reduced E2F1 expression. Upon Rb phosphorylation,
  E2F proteins are released to activate downstream gene Cdc2. Cdc25A itself is a direct
  target of miR-449a and is capable of binding to cyclinB1 and activate Cdc2/cyclinB1
  complexes. Consequently, miR-449a enhanced radiation-induced G2/M phase arrest and
  sensitizes cancer cells to ionizing radiation by downregulating c-Myc/Cdc25A pathway
  or directly repressing Cdc25A to modulate the Cdc2/cyclinB1 complexes.
