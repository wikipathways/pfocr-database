caption: TUBB8 is a β‐tubulin isotype and plays an important role in human oocyte
  spindle assembly. Most TUBB8 pathogenic variants cause the phenotype of oocyte MI
  arrest. Certain heterozygous or bi‐allelic variants in TUBB8 have been shown to
  result in early embryonic arrest (EEA). Previous articles have reported that bi‐allelic
  variants in genes encoding proteins of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC),
  including NLRP2, NLRP5, TLE6, PADI6, and KHDC3L, are responsible for EEA. MOS activates
  the ERK signaling cascade to maintain oocyte MII arrest. Bi‐allelic pathogenic variants
  in MOS inactivate the MOS‐ERK pathway and therefore cause disruption of cytoskeleton
  assembly, mRNA clearance, and mitochondrial homeostasis, which accounts for the
  phenotype of human EEAF.
