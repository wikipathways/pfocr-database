caption: Citrate is generated from glucose-derived pyruvate through tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle in the mitochondria, and transported into cytoplasm. After being
  phosphorylated by IGF1/AKT signaling, ACL converts citrate into acetyl-CoA, which
  is utilized for p300-mediated histone acetylation. This acetylation induces muscle-specific
  gene expression, resulting in SC differentiation.
