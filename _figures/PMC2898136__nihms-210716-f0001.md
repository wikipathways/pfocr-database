caption: 'Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that constitutes the phospholipid
  domain of most cell membranes and is liberated from the cellular membranes by cytoplasmic
  phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Free arachidonic acid can be metabolized to eicosanoids
  through three major pathways: the cyclooxygenase (COX), the lipoxygenase (LOX) and
  the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase pathways. In the COX pathway, the key step is
  the enzymatic conversion of arachidonic acid to the intermediate prostaglandin G2
  (PGG2), which is then reduced to an intermediate PGH2 by the peroxidase activity
  of COX. PGH2 is sequentially metabolized to prostanoids, including prostaglandins
  (PGs) and thromboxanes (TXs) by specific prostaglandin and thromboxane synthases.
  LOXs convert arachidonic acid into biologically active metabolites such as leukotrienes
  and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs); P450 metabolizes arachidonic acid into
  epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), HETEs and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs).
  In the 5-LOX pathway, arachidonic acid is converted to an intermediary 5-HPETE,
  which is further metabolized to form the unstable leukotriene A4 (LTA4). LTA4 is
  subsequently converted to 5-HETE, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4. Each of the prostaglandins
  and leukotrienes exerts its biological effects by binding to its cognate G protein-coupled
  receptor. PGI2 can transactivate the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ
  (PPARδ), and a PGD2 dehydration product, 15dPGJ2, is a natural ligand for PPARγ.
  The multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) gene family is comprised of efflux
  transporters for both prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and PGT is an influx transporter
  for prostaglandins. Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15-(NAD) (15-PGDH) mainly
  metabolizes intracellular PGE2 and PGF2α to a stable 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2
  and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2α. The red boxes indicate the signalling pathways
  that are discussed in this Review. CysLT, cysteinyl leukotriene; NSAID, non-steroidal
