caption: 'Schematic representation of the major pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis.
  The monosialoganglioside GM3, derived from lactosylceramide, is the common precursor
  for both ‘a’ and ‘b’ pathway gangliosides. Each ganglioside species consists of
  a ceramide backbone (CER), and a carbohydrate chain (Glc, glucose; Gal, galactose;
  GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine) containing one or more sialic acid (SA) residues.
  ‘a’ and ‘b’ pathway gangliosides downstream of GD1b/GM1a synthase were designated
  complex ‘a’ (CaG) and complex ‘b’ (CbG) gangliosides, respectively. Parallel steps
  in both pathways are catalysed by the same glycosyltransferases of the Golgi apparatus:
  GD3 synthase (α-2,8-sialyltransferase), GM2/GD2 synthase (β-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase);
  GD1b/GM1a synthase (β-1,3-galactosyltransferase); GT1b/GD1a synthase (β-2,3-sialyltransferase);
  GQ1b/GT1a synthase (α-2,8-sialyltransferase). Adapted from []. The letter refers
  to the number of sialic acids present in the glycan motif (M, mono-; D, di-; T,
  tri-; Q, quad-).'
