caption: KEGG pathway analysis of the differentially regulated genes demonstrates
  enrichment of components of the MAPK, Focal adhesion and TGF-β signaling. The annotated
  relationship between the regulated gene products is illustrated as activation (↓)
  or inhibition (⊥). Genes that are up- and down-regulated in TPPII knockdown cells
  are indicated by thick and dash-line boarders, respectively.
