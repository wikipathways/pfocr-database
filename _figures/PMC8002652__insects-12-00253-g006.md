caption: 'G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) through activation of ROS mediates the
  balance between PTP1B and PTK, influencing the diapause incidence of migratory locusts
  through the insulin-like signaling pathway. (A) and (B) show that antagonism between
  PTP1B and PTK mediates adults’ insulin-like signal regulating eggs’ diapause of
  migratory locusts under short photoperiod conditions. Generally, (A) RNAi Prx V
  gene of female adults, will promotes ROS production and NADPH-OX activity, then
  activates PTK, and increases the relative expression of important genes in the ISP,
  including IR, IRS, PI3K, and AKT gene under short photoperiod, finally promoting
  locust development. While (B) infection of the Prx V protein to female adults will
  inhibit ROS production and NADPH-OX activity, then activates PTP1B, and decreases
  the relative expression of important genes in the ISP, including IR, IRS, PI3K and
  AKT under short photoperiod, finally induce locust diapause. (C) Proposed model:
  the possible new mechanism wherein GPCR regulation of locust diapause. GPCR agonist
  (the role contrary with the Prx V) can combine the ligand p47 phox (a ligand of
  oxidase) to mediates the NADPH oxidation reaction [], perhaps controlling the balance
  between PTP1B and PTK in the cell, then induces the PTK expression and increases
  expression of the IR, IRS, PI3K and AKT gene, also promotes the phosphorylation
  levels of IR, IRS in the insulin-like signaling pathway and finally promotes the
  embryo developmental biochemical processes under short photoperiod conditions.'
