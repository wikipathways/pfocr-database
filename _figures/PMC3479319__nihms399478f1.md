caption: Overview of Wnt signaling cascadesWnt signals can be transduced either through
  the canonical pathway (colored in pink) or different non-canonical pathways. Canonical
  Wnt signals are mediated by Frizzled (Fzds) receptors and their LRP co-receptors.
  In the absence of Wnt stimulation, β-catenin forms a degradation complex with APC
  (adenomatous polyposis coli), Axin and GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase-3) (dashed
  pink line). Phosphorylation of β-catenin by CK1 (casein kinase I) primes β-catenin
  and GSK-3 for proteasome-mediated degradation. The presence of Wnt ligand results
  in the activation of Dsh (dishelleved), which leads to a phosphorylation-dependent
  recruitment of Axin to the LRP co-receptor and disassembly of the β-catenin degradation
  complex. This leads to an accumulation and stabilization of β-catenin in the cytoplasm
  and the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. β-catenin complexes with TCF/LEF (T-cell
  factor/lymphoid enhancer factor) transcription factors and acts as a transcriptional
  co-activator to induce context-dependent Wnt/β-catenin target genes. Non-canonical
  Wnt signals are mostly transduced through Fzd receptors without involvement of LRPs.
  Stimulation of Fzd through Wnt can lead to the activation of PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase), which then activates the AKT/mTOR pathway resulting in increased protein
  synthesis (shown in green). Other G-protein mediated pathways are the PCP (planar-cell
  polarity) pathway (shown in blue) leading to the activation of Rac/Rho, JNK (c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase) and/or ROCK (Rho associated kinase). JNK can induce Jun, which
  together with Fos, forms the AP-1 early response transcription factor. Both PCP
  pathways have been implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangements. The Wnt/Ca2+signaling
  pathway (colored in yellow) is defined by the activation of PLC (phospholipase C)
  through Wnt/Fzd resulting in an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, which activate
  PKCs (protein kinase C) and CamKII (calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II) or CN
  (calcineurin), a phosphatase that activates the transcription factor NFAT (nuclear
  factor of activated T cell).

  description: Overview of Wnt signaling cascadesWnt signals can be transduced either

    Canonical Wnt signals are mediated by Frizzled (Fzds) receptors and their LRP
