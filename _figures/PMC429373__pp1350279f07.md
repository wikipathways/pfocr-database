caption: 'Schematic illustration of the signaling networks involving IAA, NO, and
  cellular messengers that regulate ARF in cucumber. The auxin IAA triggers a transient
  NO accumulation (). In turn, NO regulates the activation of a MAPK signaling cascade.
  This pathway could be mediating both mitotic process and the expression of auxin-responsive
  genes (). In parallel, a cGMP-dependent pathway is also present leading to ARF ().
  NO-mediated signaling pathways that regulate ARF in cucumber: light gray, cGMP-independent;
  dark gray, cGMP-dependent.'
