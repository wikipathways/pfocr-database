caption: The inositol pyrophosphate (PP-InsP) metabolic pathway. This graphic incorporates
  a proposal [,] that the pathway for 1,5-InsP8 turnover principally comprises a cyclical
  interconversion of InsP6, 5-InsP7, 1,5-InsP8, and 1-InsP7. ITPK1 = inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate
  1-kinase; IP6K = inositol hexakisphosphate 5-kinase; PPIP5K = diphosphoinositol
  pentakisphosphate 1-kinase (in addition to hosting a self-contained kinase domain,
  this class of enzyme also contains a phosphatase domain that possesses 1,5-InsP8
  1-phosphatase activity [,,]); DIPP = diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphatase.
