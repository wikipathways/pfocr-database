caption: 'Biosynthesis pathway for two essential amino acids. (i) Phenylalanine pathway
  involving chor (Chorismate), pphn (Prephenate), phpyr (Phenylpyruvate) and (ii)
  Tryptophan pathway consisting of the following metabolites: 3ig3p (C′-(3-Indolyl)-glycerol
  3-phosphate), anth (Anthranilate), pran (N-(5-Phospho-D-ribosyl) anthranilate),
  indole and 2cpr5p (1-(2-Carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxy-D-ribulose 5-phosphate). Reactions
  with asterisks (**) represent reactions mediated by horizontally transfered gene.
  Genes highlighted in red colour are the essential genes while those highlighted
  in black are non-essential genes'
