caption: (A) Schematic representation of the aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic
  pathway showing genes involved in various steps. The numbers beside the AGI identifiers
  indicate the change in expression of these genes in bp er fil-10 suppressor vs.
  the parent bp er line as gauged by microarray analysis. Question marks indicate
  uncertainly about the involvement of these genes in the indicated steps. The green
  text identifies specific glucosinolate metabolites that are products of the enzymatic
  steps and for which quantitative analysis was performed (see ). (B) QRT-PCR analyses
  of selected GSL biosynthetic genes, confirming down regulation of these genes in
  bp er fil-10 verses the bp er parent. The GSTF11 gene (At3g03190) was selected for
  analysis as its expression pattern is very similar to that of FIL (eFP browser data)
  and the gene has been implicated in GSL biosynthesis. The relative expression ratio
  of the bp er fil-10 mutant is shown and error bars are the standard error of the
  mean. Pair-wise t-tests on linear transformed ΔCT values revealed that all differences
  are statistically significant (p<0.034).
