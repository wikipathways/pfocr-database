caption: Map of arachidonic acid (AA) cascade. Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the first enzyme
  in the pathway for producing prostaglandin (PG) and thromboxane (Tx) from arachidonic
  acid. COX-1 is present in most tissues and involved in the physiological production
  of PGs for maintaining normal homeostasis. COX-2, which is induced by mitogens,
  cytokines, and growth factors, is primarily responsible for PGs produced in inflammatory
  sites. Lipoxygenase (LOX) is the first enzyme in the pathway for producing leukotrien
  (LT) from arachidonic acid. Isoenzymes of LOX include 5-LOX, 12-LOX, and two 15-LOX
  isoforms (15-LOX-1, 15-LOX-2).
