caption: 'Ligand binding to inactive monomeric Her receptors is followed by dimer
  formation and kinase activation. Upon recruitment into heterodimers, the ligandless
  coreceptor Her2 enhances and prolongs signaling through several pathways, including
  the indicated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) route, leading to activation of the Akt/PKB kinase. Points of intervention
  by current drugs targeting Her2 receptors (Herceptin, tyrosine kinase inhibitors)
  are indicated. The abbreviations used are as follows: PDK-1 phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1, TK tyrosine kinase.'
