caption: Outline of the basic metabolic pathway of glucose. The molecule is imported
  inside the cells and depending on the metabolic status might be used either for
  the synthesis of nitrogen bases through the pentose phosphate pathway or converted
  to trioses and from there to pyruvate. The last metabolite may either feed mitochondria
  or be converted to lactate and secreted in the extracellular medium. High rate of
  pyruvate conversion to lactate despite the presence of oxygen is called the “Warburg
  effect.” For some of the metabolites depicted in the figure, existing fluorescent
  reporters are described in the main text. Those metabolites are embedded in a light
  green frame. (Figure prepared by modifying a Biorender.com template).
