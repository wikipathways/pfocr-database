caption: '(A) In response to IL-1β and/or LPS stimulation, A20 expression is induced
  and inhibit the NF-κB signaling in a negative feedback loop. ① A20 directly target
  the E3 ligase TRAF6 by disassembling the K63-Linked polyubiquitin chains of TRAF6
  via its OTU domain; ② A20 disrupt the interactions between TRAF6 and its E2 enzymes
  Ubc13 and UbcH5 cooperating with the ubiquitin-binding adaptor molecule TAX1BP1
  in the first step; ③ then at later times A20 conjugate K48-Linked polyubiquitin
  chains on Ubc13 and/or UbcH5c via its ZnF4 domain to trigger their proteasomal degradation.
  (B) In response to TNF stimulation, A20 is reported to inhibit the NF-κB signaling
  by the following mechanisms: ① A20 hydrolyze the K63-Linked polyubiquitin chains
  of RIPK1 via its OTU domain to supress the downstream activation of IKK complex,
  as well as the NF-κB signaling; ② A20 conjugate K48-Linked polyubiquitin chains
  on RIPK1 via its ZnF4 domain to trigger its proteasomal degradation; ③ A20 bind
  to the M1-Linked polyubiquitin chains of RIPK1 and/or NF-κB essential modulator
  (NEMO) through its ZnF7 structural domain, to stabilize the M1-Linked polyubiquitin
  chains and protect them from proteasomal degradation, thus affecting the activation
  of the IKK complex in a non-catalytic pathway; ④ A20 bind to the K63-Linked polyubiquitin
  chains of RIPK1 through the ZnF4 domain, which is largely dispensable for restricting
  NF-κB signaling.'
