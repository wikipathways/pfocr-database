caption: Model for the regulation of DmdB activity in Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3. During
  carbon and energy limitation, DmdB1 overcomes DMSP inhibition as ADP concentrations
  increase as a result of decreasing cellular energy charge. The resulting stimulation
  of the demethylation pathway increases the energy charge and lowers ADP concentrations
  until DMSP inhibition is restored. A different chain of events may explain the role
  of DmdB2. The levels of DmdA activity and MMPA are likely set by the availability
  of free THF. During rapid growth, methyl-THF is oxidized, yielding high intracellular
  levels of free THF and MMPA. The increased levels of MMPA reverse the DMSP inhibition
  of DmdB2 and lead to rapid production of acetaldehyde and MeSH. These additional
  energy sources spare the pools of methyl-THF, leading to a depletion of free THF
  and a decline in MMPA production. In addition, the oxidation of MeSH leads to H2O2
  production, resulting in oxidative stress and slowing DMSP-dependent growth. The
  slowdown in growth reduces the demand for methyl-THF, causing a depletion of free
  THF. Alternatively, both enzymes may be active during growth on methionine when
  MMPA is produced in the absence of DMSP.
