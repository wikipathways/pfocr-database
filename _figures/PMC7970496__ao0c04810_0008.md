caption: Potential mechanisms of curcumin involved in improving cognitive dysfunction
  in ApoE4-Tg mice. ApoE4 may trigger ER stress and then activate the inflammatory
  signaling pathway to trigger neuroinflammation in the nervous system, leading to
  the occurrence of AD. However, curcumin effectively inhibited the neuroinflammation
  caused by ApoE4 by inhibiting the occurrence of ER stress and inhibiting the activation
  of the inflammatory signaling pathway and finally protected the learning and memory
  ability of ApoE4-Tg mice.
