caption: Enteroviruses have demonstrated the capacity to escape host antiviral defense
  by affecting NK cell effector response through unclear mechanisms. It has also been
  suggested that defects in folate pathway and a genetic background can play a role
  in reduction of number and activation of NK cells in T1D patients but the mechanisms
  are not fully understood. Therefore, a defective viral clearance by NK cells may
  play a role in the persistent enteroviral infection of pancreas which could induce
  a prolonged inflammatory response, beta cell antigen presentation and destruction
  of beta cells by preexisting antigen-specific CD8 cytotoxic T cells leading to T1D.
