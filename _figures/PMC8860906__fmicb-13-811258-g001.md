caption: The colonization and reproduction of Helicobacter pylori (HP) are closely
  related to its chemotaxis, adhesion, colonization, virulence, inflammation, and
  host immune tolerance. It mediates the inflammatory response in the gastric epithelium
  through pathological processes such as oxidative stress, DNA methylation, and cell
  proliferation, which subsequently cause DNA damage, autophagy, apoptosis, and abnormal
  cell proliferation, to ultimately provide a pathological basis for cancer development.
  (1) Cytotoxin-associated gene (cag) pathogenicity island (CagPAI) can contribute
  to the opening of the type-IV secretion system (T4SS) channels and assist in the
  release of cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) from HP into gastric mucosal epithelial
  cells, thereby promoting the breakdown of β-catenin/a-catenin and actin filament
  complexes, leading to β-catenin accumulation. In addition, vacuolized cytotoxin
  (VacA) enters the gastric epithelial cells and further promotes β-catenin accumulation
  by inactivating GSK-3. When β-catenin enters into the nucleus, it forms a complex
  with LEF and TCF, thereby activating the expression of genes encoding cyclin D1
  (cyclin-D1) and c-Myc, which leads to abnormal cell proliferation. In addition,
  CagA mediates the NF-kB/ERK/FOXO4 pathway to regulate the apoptotic and autophagic
  processes in gastric epithelial cells, which is in concert with other pro-inflammatory
  responses involved in the regulation of physiological processes of cell proliferation
  that leads to the malignant transformation of gastric mucosal epithelial cells to
  cancer cells. (2) Hrta secreted by HP, can cut E-calmodulin, disrupt intercellular
  adhesion, and lose cell polarity, providing conditions for HP colonization. Meanwhile,
  BabA, SabA, and HopQ can bind to their corresponding receptors on the mucus layer
  (LewisB, Stalyl–Lewlsx, and CEACAM, respectively), while the receptors of OipA,
  HopZ, and Hom remain uncleared. These outer membrane proteins (OMPs) promote the
  HP adhesion to host cells, and in combination with lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-binding
  complex, lead to the activation of NF-kB and other chemokines [IL-2 and interleukin-8
  (IL-8)]. (3) VacA released by HP, can also bind to the receptors of tyrosine kinase,
  and cause Src to phosphorylate CagA, which triggers SHP2 to bind to PI-3 kinase,
  allowing the activation of Ras, Raf, and ERK. Phosphorylated ERK translocates to
  the nucleus with the activation of ELK1 and SRF complexes and induces c-Fos and
  c-Jun gene expressions. In addition, VacA also increases the activity of spermidine
  oxidase (SMO); both of these pathways can lead to DNA damage with a high expression
  of inflammatory factors. (4) NapA, another virulence factor of HP, is recruited
  by neutrophils that exert a significant role in releasing exogenous reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) in an attempt to clear the infection of HP, which in turn causes more
  damage in the gastric mucosa.
