caption: Sphingolipid metabolic pathways. The sphingolipid modulators (in red) and
  affected tumor processes (processes by which molecules promote tumor growth are
  indicated with red arrows, whereas those that inhibit tumor growth are indicated
  with green arrows) are shown. Ceramide is the central molecule that is synthesized
  through the de novo pathway or other catabolic pathways through conversion from
  ceramide-1-phosphate, sphingomyelin, sphingosine, glycosphingoplidis, or sulfatides
  (glucosyl or galactosyl-ceramide). Figure created with BioRender.com.
