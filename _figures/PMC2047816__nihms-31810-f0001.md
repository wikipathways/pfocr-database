caption: Neuroactive steroids are endogenous neuromodulators that can be synthesized
  de novo in the brain as well as adrenal glands, ovaries and testes (for review,
  see (). The biosynthetic pathway for these steroids is shown in . The inhibitory
  neuroactive steroids with potent GABAA receptor positive modulatory effects are
  highlighted in green, while the excitatory neuroactive steroids with weak GABAA
  receptor antagonist effects are highlighted in orange. Among these compounds, the
  3α,5α- and 3α,5β- reduced metabolites of progesterone (; ), deoxycorticosterone
  (DOC) (; ), dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (; ; ) and testosterone (; ) enhance GABAergic
  neurotransmission and produce inhibitory neurobehavioral effects such as anxiolytic,
  anticonvulsant and sedative actions. The excitatory neuroactive steroids include
  the sulfated derivatives of pregnenolone and DHEA () as well as the 3α,5α- and 3α,5β-
  reduced metabolites of cortisol ().
