caption: miR-21 targets are shown in green. A, the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Signals
  within the cell induce Bax, a BH123 domain containing protein, to permeabilize the
  mitochondrial membrane, allowing the release of cytochrome C. Cytochrome C binds
  and activates Apaf1, which in turn activates the initiator Caspase 9 by cleavage
  and formation of the apoptosome (not shown). This allows cleavage and activation
  of the effector caspases 3, 6, and 7, leading to apoptosis. TAp63 acts in a compensatory
  role in p53-deficient cells to activate Pro-apoptotic genes in response to DNA damage.
  Fak is a scaffolding protein that activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to avoid apoptosis.
  Inhibition of this by Pten allows for anoikis. Spy1 expression is associated with
  the inhibition of DNA damage signal cascades that initiate apoptosis. hMsh2 is a
  member of the mismatch repair complex that can signal within the DNA damage-induced
  apoptosis pathway. High levels of TGFBR2 stimulate apoptosis, potentially through
  stimulation of the Mapk pathway. B, the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Death ligands
  such as TNF or FasL bind their cell surface receptors, causing them to tri- or oligomerize,
  causing recruitment of the adaptor proteins Fadd or Tradd, leading to the formation
  of the death inducing signaling complex (DISC, not shown) comprised of the intiator
  caspases 8, 10, or 2. These can then activate the effector caspases 3, 6, and 7,
  causing apoptosis. These death ligands can also signal the mitochondrial apoptotic
  pathway by activating BH3 domain containing proteins such as Bid and Bad, which
  inhibit the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. Bcl2 then releases BH123 domain containing
  proteins such as Bax, allowing release of cytochrome C, formation of the apoptosome
  by Apaf1, and induction of the Caspase cascade through the initiator Caspase 9.
  TAp63 induces apoptosis by activating signaling via death receptors and mitochondria.
  Pten inhibits TNF activation of NF-κB, which in this context would ordinarily activate
  transcription of anti-apoptotic genes. Ligands specific to PPARα induce apoptosis
  through up-regulation of PP2A, which positively affects Bad levels. FasL is an apoptosis
  inhibitor that signals through Fas, a death receptor. Anp32A is a tumor suppressor
  that regulates apoptosis through activation of Caspase activity. Pellino-1 is involved
  in activating NF-κB which prevents apoptosis during the proliferation phase of hepatocytes
  after hepatectomy. Pdcd4 is involved in TLR4 signaling and signals apoptosis through
  IL-6 and NF-κB.
