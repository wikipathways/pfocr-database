caption: Schematic model of how TG NPs ameliorate CKD progression. TG NPs could induce
  the UPR pathway in kidney cells. Furthermore, TG NPs protected kidney cells against
  oxidative stress-induced cell death through the activation of Nrf2 and FoxO1. In
  addition, TG NPs induced autophagy that may inhibit CKD progression.
