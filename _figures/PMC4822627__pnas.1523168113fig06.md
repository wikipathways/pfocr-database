caption: A proposed model describing the metabolic remodeling in SL biosynthetic pathways
  during viral infection. The metabolic basis for the interactions between the bloom-forming
  alga E. huxleyi (blue) and its specific virus EhV (red) is mediated by the expression
  of several virus-encoded enzymes (red, italics) involved in the SL biosynthesis
  pathway acting orthogonal to the host encoded enzymes (blue, italics). The viral-encoded
  SPT induces a shift in substrate specificity which allows the efficient utilization
  of C15-CoA to produce C17 sphingoid bases (compared with C18 LCB produced by non-infected
  host cells). These virally induced odd carbon chain sphingoid bases are subsequently
  hydroxylated, possibly by a virus-encoded sphingoid base hydroxylase (LCB hydroxylase)
  and further metabolized to synthesize unique vGSLs. These vGSLs, combined with the
  host GSLs, are required for virus assembly and are enriched in the virion, suggesting
  a structural role for these molecules. vGSLs are also involved in inducing the host
  PCD, likely affecting a timed cell lysis to allow proper viral egress. KSR, 3-ketodihydrosphingosine
  reductase; DHCer, dihydroceramide; DCD, dihydroceramide desaturase; PhytoCer, phytoceramide.
