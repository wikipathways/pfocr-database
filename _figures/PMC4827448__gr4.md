caption: Activation of the Wnt/Ca2+pathway triggers the release of intracellular calcium
  stores. In the Wnt/Ca2+pathway, binding of Wnt ligand to Fz activates G-proteins,
  which in turn activate Dsh. Activated Dsh binds phosphodiesterase (PDE), which inhibits
  Protein Kinase G (PKG) and causes an increase in intracellular calcium, as well
  as the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC). Activated PLC produces inositol triphosphate
  (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) from the membrane-bound phospholipid phosphatidyl
  inositol 4,5-bisphosphate. IP3 triggers release of intracellular Ca2+ from stores
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which activates a number of downstream targets,
  including CamKII, calcineurin, and protein kinase C (PKC). Activation of PKC by
  Ca2+ requires DAG, and leads to phosphorylation and activation of cell division
  control protein 42 (Cdc42), a GTPase. Activation of calcineurin by Ca2+ and calmodulin
  (not pictured), dephosphorylates and activates the nuclear factor associated with
  T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors, thereby facilitating transcription
  of their target genes and linking intracellular Ca2+signaling to gene expression.
  Target genes of the NFAT family include genes critical for the immune response,
  but have also been shown to influence ventral cell fates in vertebrate embryos.
  Finally, CamKII activation has a downstream effect that includes antagonizing β-catenin/TCF
  regulated transcription.
