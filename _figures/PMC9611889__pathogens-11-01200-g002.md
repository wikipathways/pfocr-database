caption: Multiple viruses regulate TJs expression through the innate immune pathway.
  HIV infection can activate MAPK, thereby upregulating NF-κB, and disrupting TJs,
  and the NF-κB and MAPK pathways involved by IL-17 participate in the repair process
  of the barrier. ZIKV infection can over activate the ERK/MAPK pathway and destroy
  BTB. Inflammatory cytokines/chemokines caused by JEV infection, such as IP-10 can
  regulate the expression of TJs, which is considered as the main cause of BBB destruction.
  Early JEV infection leads to significant upregulation of IP-10, which induces TNF-α
  via the JNK-c-Jun signaling pathway, and TNF-α directly contributes to BBB decomposition
  by inhibiting the expression of ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN-5. DENV infection downregulates
  the ex-pression of TNF-α, cause a significant decrease in ZO-1 expression and peripheral
  localization in epithelial and endothelial cells. In the process of RABV infection,
  IFN-λ maintains the integrity of ZO-1 in the BBB to reduce neuroinflammation. Meanwhile,
  the downregulation of ZO-1 and OCLN is resulted from the activating JNK/MAPK pathway
  by PCV2 infection.
