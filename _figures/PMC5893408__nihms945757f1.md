caption: 'Sphingosine is produced from the sphingolipid pathway by the action of ceramidase
  on ceramide. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is produced by phosphorylation of sphingosine
  by Sphingosine Kinases 1 or 2. S1P can be converted back to sphingosine by S1P phosphatases
  or irreversibly degraded by S1P lyase. S1P binds to S1P receptors 1–5 (S1PR1–5),
  which are coupled to G proteins that affect cellular pathways. Shown in this figure
  are proposed downstream pathways of the G alpha subunits Gi, G12/13, and Gq which
  interact with the S1PRs. These pathways may not be active in all cells that express
  any given S1PR at the same time, but is shown for illustration purposes. New potential
  mechanisms discussed in this review are outlined in red.Abbreviations: Ras: Ras
