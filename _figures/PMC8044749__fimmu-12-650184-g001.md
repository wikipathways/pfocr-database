caption: Proposed immunopathological roles of circulating histones in sepsis. In sepsis,
  inflammatory mediators including pathogen associated molecule patterns (PAMPs, namely
  bacteria and LPS etc.) and damage associated molecule patterns (DAMPs, namely IL-18,
  TNF-α and high mobility group box 1 etc.) activate innate immune cells (neutrophils
  and macrophages) and endothelial cells through pattern recognition receptors (toll-like
  receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and NOD-like receptors), initiating transcription
  of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines and triggering highly inflammatory
  programmed cell death such as NETosis/ETosis, necroptosis, necrosis and pyroptosis.
  Rupture of the plasma cell membrane of these cells contributes to the release of
  histones into extracellular spaces. Histones trigger innate immunity by activating
  Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/4/9 or NLPR3 inflammasome pathways, leading to the release
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-α etc.) that not only
  cause neutrophils to release extracellular traps in return but also upregulate tissue
  factor (TF) expression by blood monocytes. Histones bind to endothelium cells and
  cause cell permeabilization, calcium influx and endothelium injury. Endothelium
  injury further induces barrier dysfunction, leakage of plasma-protein-rich fluid
  into the tissues, alteration of blood flow dynamics, recruitment and activation
  of circulating leucocytes and release of excessive cytokines, which are characterized
  by increased TF, prostacyclin (PGI2) and superoxide expression, decreased thromboxane
  A2 (TXA2) and nitric oxide release. Increased TF can trigger the activation of prothrombin
  through extrinsic coagulation pathway and finally cause disseminated intravenous
  coagulation (DIC). Besides, histones can directly activate thrombin formation by
  binding to prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 to form histone-prothrombin-FXa complex.
  Histones also induce platelet aggregation, activation and subsequent platelet-dependent
  thrombin formation through TLR2 and TLR4 pathways. Finally, dysregulated inflammation
  response, impaired endothelial barrier, immunothrombosis and DIC collectively cause
  multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) including circulatory failure, acute respiratory
  distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure and liver failure, resulting in death in
  most severe form of sepsis.

  description: Proposed immunopathological roles of circulating histones in sepsis.
    In sepsis, inflammatory mediators including pathogen associated molecule patterns
    (PAMPs, namely bacteria and LPS etc.) and damage associated molecule patterns
    (DAMPs, namely IL-18, TNF-α and high mobility group box 1 etc.) activate innate
    immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) and endothelial cells through pattern
    recognition receptors (toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and NOD-like
    receptors), initiating transcription of type I interferons and proinflammatory
    cytokines and triggering highly inflammatory programmed cell death such as NETosis/ETosis,
    necroptosis, necrosis and pyroptosis. Rupture of the plasma cell membrane of these
    cells contributes to the release of histones into extracellular spaces. Histones
    trigger innate immunity by activating Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/4/9 or NLPR3
    inflammasome pathways, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1,
    IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-α etc.) that not only cause neutrophils to release extracellular
    traps in return but also upregulate tissue factor (TF) expression by blood monocytes.
    Histones bind to endothelium cells and cause cell permeabilization, calcium influx
