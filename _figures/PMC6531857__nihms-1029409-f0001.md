caption: Binding of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) to its cognate receptor TNFR1 triggers
  the assembly of complex I, which comprises TNFR1, TNFR1-associated death domain
  (TRADD), receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), TNFR-associated
  factor 2 (TRAF2), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1/2 (cIAP1/2), and linear
  ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC),,. Complex I provides the platform for
  Lys63-linked ubiquitylation (grey circles) or linear ubiquitylation (green circles)
  of RIPK1 by cIAP1/2 or LUBAC, respectively. This ubiquitylation is implicated in
  the decision between nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or survival signalling and cell death
  signalling. Ubiquitylation leads to the recruitment of other factors such as transforming
  growth factor-β (TGFβ)-activated kinase (TAK1), TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) and
  TAB2, or NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) and the inhibitor of the NF-κB kinase-α
  (IKKα)–IKKβ complex, usually triggering canonical NF-κB signalling. In the presence
  of cycloheximide (CHX), a translational inhibitor, TNF stimulation leads to the
  formation of a cytosolic complex IIa in which RIPK1 disappears, whereas TRADD and
  FAS-associated death domain (FADD) interaction leads to the activation of caspase
  8 and effector caspases such as caspase 3 and caspase 7 and apoptotic cell death.
  With cIAP1/2 inhibitors (SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase)
  mimetics), knockdown of cIAPs,– or inhibition or depletion of TAK1 or NEMO, complex
  IIb is formed. Complex IIb consists of RIPK1, RIPK3, FADD and caspase 8, and favours
  RIPK1-kinase-activity-dependent apoptosis. Heteromeric pro-caspase 8–FLICE-like
  inhibitory protein long isoform (FLIPL) inhibits necroptosis, probably by cleaving
  RIPK1, RIPK3 and cylindromatosis (CYLD)–. With sufficient expression of RIPK3 and
  concomitant inhibition or reduced expression of pro-caspase 8 and FLIPL (REF. ),
  complex IIc (also known as the necrosome) is formed,,. The formation of complex
  IIc entails the association of RIPK1 and RIPK3 followed by a series of auto-and
  transphosphorylation events of RIPK1 and RIPK3. Activated RIPK3 phosphorylates and
  recruits mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL),, eventually leading to
  the formation of a supramolecular protein complex at the plasma membrane and necroptosis–,.
  SMAC mimetics are being developed to impair survival signalling and to sensitize
  cells to the triggering of cell death in the context of tumour treatment. Z-VAD-FMK
  is a bona fide pan-caspase inhibitor. Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and the more-specific
  Nec-1s, Cpd27 (REF. ) and, more recently, a hybrid molecule consisting of Nec-1s
  and ponatinib called PN10 (REF. ) all inhibit the kinase activity of RIPK1 and thus
  inhibit necroptotic signalling. Additional necroptosis inhibitors include the RIPK3
  inhibitors GSKʹ840, GSKʹ843 and GSKʹ872 (REF. ), as well as the MLKL inhibitors
  necrosulfonamide (NSA) and compound 1 (REF. ). However, the specificity of these
  MLKL inhibitors is not restricted to inhibition of MLKL, and their efficacy is probably
  also due to effects on other steps in the necroptosis pathway. ActD, actinomycin
