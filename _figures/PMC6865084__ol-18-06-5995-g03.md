caption: PPI network, pathway crosstalk and gene-pathway analyses of the DEGs from
  the GSE9116 dataset. (A) PPI network of candidate genes. Red, core genes. Orange,
  top three up-regulated genes. Blue, other DEGs. (B) Subnetwork of PPI network for
  hub genes of which nodal degree > average. Red, core genes. Orange, top three up-regulated
  genes. Blue, other DEGs. (C) Pathway crosstalk analysis of DEGs. Edge thickness
  represents the average value of Jaccard and Overlapping Coefficient. (D) Subnetwork

  arrow direction between gene and pathway was determined from Kyoto Gene and Genome
  Encyclopedia database and BioCarta. Red circle, core genes. Blue circle, other DEGs.
  Green square, pathways. (F) Subnetwork of gene-pathway collected according to the
