caption: Post-transcriptional gene suppression mediated by miRNAs is involved in the
  fine-tuning of epithelial anti-Cryptosporidium defence. Cryptosporidium parvum infection
  alters expression profile of miRNA genes in infected epithelial cells. A panel of
  miRNA genes is transactivated or transsuppressed through the activation of the NF-κB
  pathway. These NF-κB-responsive miRNAs may modulate epithelial anti-parasite responses
  at every step of the innate immune network, including feedback regulation to TLR/NF-κB
  signalling, post-transcriptional regulation of many NF-κB-regulated immune or inflammatory
  genes, release of epithelial exosomes and production of antimicrobial effector molecules.
