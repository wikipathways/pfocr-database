caption: 'Variants of the Notch-Wnt crosstalk. (a) Co-operative and synergistic regulation
  of gene transcription when both pathways are active. (b) Sequential signaling is
  initiated when one active pathway promotes transcription of the ligand of the other
  pathway (top: active Notch signaling promotes expression of Wnt ligands; below:
  active Wnt signaling promotes expression of Notch ligands). (c) Examples of direct
  molecular crosstalk (top: both pathways are activated, but β-catenin is inhibited
  by NICD (inhibitory crosstalk); below: the Notch pathway is activated and co-activates
  intracellularly the Wnt cascade (activating crosstalk).'
