caption: 'Main aspects of folate receptor signaling and C1 metabolism discussed during
  the meeting. Three types of folate transporters/receptors are known to exist in
  humans to facilitate the uptake of folate: Folate Receptors (FRs), Reduced Folate
  Carrier (RFC) and Proton-Coupled Folate Transporter (PCFT) []. Left side: Folate
  binding to FRs can induce STAT3 activation via a GP130 co-receptor mediated JAK-dependent
  process. Folate can also bind FRs undergoing endocytosis and upon released FRs are
  set free to act like transcription factors []. Right side: Folate, through an interlinked
  set of mitochondrial and cytosolic reactions, support the C1 metabolism and the
  main pathway reactions are depicted [, ]. THF: tetrahydrofolate; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase; SHMT1/2, serine hydroxymethyl transferase in cytosol (1) and mitochondrial
  (2); MTHFD1, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1; MTHFD2, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase 2; 10-f-THF: 10-formyl- tetrahydrofolate; GARFTase: glycinamide ribonucleotide
  formyltransferase; AICARFTase: 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase'
