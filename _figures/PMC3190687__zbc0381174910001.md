caption: IPMDH pathways. A, overview of the methionine chain-elongation pathway of
  aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in A. thaliana. Note that an elongated 2-oxo
  acid can serve as a substrate for MAM1 and MAM3 in subsequent rounds through the
  pathway to yield longer side-chain products. B, IPMDH catalyze the conversion of
  3-isopropylmalate to 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate in leucine synthesis and the conversion
  of 3-(2′-methylthio)ethylmalate to 5-methylthio-2-oxopentoate in glucosinolate synthesis.
