caption: Model of damage-based tissue communication. Schematic representation of the
  tissue communication network that is activated following disruptions to muscle homeostasis.
  Muscle health depends on muscle integrity and the strong attachment of muscle (red)
  to tendon (green, asterisk) via ECM interactions. Muscle hypercontraction (Damage
  1) and weakened MASs that progress to detachment (Damage 2) generate stress responses
  that activate local and systemic immune responses. Muscle damage prompts a series
  of cellular immune responses including hemocyte recruitment and melanization. Locally,
  JAK-STAT signaling is activated in muscle tissue through the binding of Upd ligands
  to the Domeless (Dome) receptor to induce expression of immune-responsive genes.
  Toll signaling is activated in conjunction with the JAK-STAT pathway in a reciprocal
  network. Upon Toll signal transduction, Dl moves into the nuclei of fat body cells
  to activate Toll-responsive genes such as the AMP, drosomycin. Other forms of cellular
  stress in muscle tissue or possibly in coordinating tissues such as epithelium (Damage
  3) may coincide with destabilization of muscle attachment and contribute to further
  loss of muscle maintenance.
