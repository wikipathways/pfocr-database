caption: (1) Stimulation of various PRRs results in activation of transcription factors
  such as IRF3 and NF-κB. To activate ISGs or proinflammatory genes expression, NF-κB
  and IRF3 translocate to the nucleus via the classical Karyopherin-α/β-dependent
  nuclear import pathway. (2) Nuclear import of a plasmid transfected into cellular
  cytoplasm is essential for gene expression. Transcription factors such as IRF3 and
  NF-κB bind to their cognate response elements present in the promoter of the plasmid
  and allow nuclear import via the classical karyopherin-α/β-dependent pathway ()
  as well as transcription. (3) HIV-1-based vectors deliver genes to the nucleus in
  a karyopherin-α/β-independent manner. Vpr localizes to the nuclear pores and targets
  karyopherin-α-dependent nuclear import in a DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase-dependent
  manner. This inhibits nuclear translocation of transcription factors such as IRF3
  and NF-κB and subsequent antiviral ISG expression. This also inhibits IRF3 and NF-κB-dependent
  plasmid expression or nuclear import but does not impact lentiviral gene delivery.
