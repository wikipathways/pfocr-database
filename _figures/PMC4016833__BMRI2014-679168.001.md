caption: Signaling events in murine heart development and cardiac ESC differentiation.
  In both systems, mesodermal induction from the epiblast is regulated by Wnt/β-catenin,
  Nodal/Activin, and BMP signaling pathways and correlates with Brachyury upregulation.
  Further commitment of mesodermal progenitors to cardiac mesoderm and consequent
  first heart field (FHF) formation require the inhibition of Wnt signaling and expression
  of BMPs. Similarly, in ESCs system, Notch pathway inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  and activates BMP to specify cardiac fates. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is then activated
  to allow proliferation and maintenance of the SHF, both in embryo and ESCs. Further
  differentiation from the cardiac crescent stage to the following morphogenic phases
  of embryonic heart development and, in parallel, the expression of cardiomyocyte
  differentiation genes in ESCs require inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin. In the embryo
  and ESCs, this is achieved by Notch and noncanonical Wnt signaling, which inhibit
  the effect of Wnt/β-catenin and instruct progenitor cells within the SHF to leave
  the proliferative state and start differentiating. ⊣ represents inhibitory effect;
  ⤾ represents maintenance of a proliferative state.
