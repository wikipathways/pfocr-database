caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for the production of MYFR in bacteria. The
  conversion of tyrosine to tyramine only takes place in strains that produce MYFRTyramine
  and thus carry the mfnA gene. Note that the types of the linkages between the glutamates
  are unknown; here, they are shown arbitrarily as γ-linkages. F1-PP, 5-(aminomethyl)-3-furanmethanol-pyrophosphate.
