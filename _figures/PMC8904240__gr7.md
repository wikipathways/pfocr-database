caption: Schematic of the pathways involved in punicalagin-induced autophagic degradation
  of E6 and E7. In human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected cervical cancer cells, the
  binding of BCL2 to BECN1 blocks its interaction with other components of the PIK3C3
  complex that regulates autophagosome nucleation for membrane formation. Treatment
  with punicalagin promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which
  leads to the activation and phosphorylation of JNK. Activated JNK directly phosphorylates
  BCL2. Phosphorylated BCL2 promotes the dissociation of the BECN1/BCL2 complex. BECN1
  binds to the PIK3C3 complex and initiates autophagy. Accelerated autophagosome formation
  and autophagosome-lysosome fusion lead to the lysosomal degradation of its targets
  E6 and E7. This results in the suppression of cervical cancer cell proliferation
  and survival and the inhibition of tumor growth.
