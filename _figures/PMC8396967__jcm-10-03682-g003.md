caption: 'A model to demonstrate the metabolic vicious cycle whereby hyperglycemia-mediated
  stimulation of NOGPs fuels oxidative stress and further NOGP activation. The ROS
  produced by activation of the various NOGPs play a central role in fueling this
  vicious metabolic cycle. ROS produced by each pathway will further stimulate the
  respective NOGP as indicated, while also fueling the other NOGPs. The ROS produced
  will inhibit flux through the glycolytic pathway to further increase NOGP activation.
  In addition, higher ROS levels will deplete glutathione (GSH) and thus increase
  polyol pathway flux. Greater ROS availability will result in glucose autoxidation
  and lipid peroxidation that will generate increased AGEs. Increased ROS such as
  H2O2 can also directly cause activation of PKC. In addition, the polyol pathway
  plays a key role by activating other NOGPs. Here, it can generate fructose that
  can be further metabolized to produce AGEs and fructose-6-phosphate, which can lead
  to activation of the HBP, PKC, and AGEs. Mapanga, R.F., Essop MF. Am J Physiol Heart
  Circ Physiol 2016; 310: H153–H173 (Ref. []).'
