caption: Can respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-dependent necroptosis be targeted for
  therapeutic benefit? Simpson and colleagues demonstrate that RSV infection readily
  induces necroptosis in RSV-infected airway epithelial cells. The subsequent release
  of HMGB1 into the extracellular space results in the recruitment of proinflammatory
  and type 2–skewed immune responses, exacerbated disease, and an ensuing heightened
  susceptibility to asthma. This newly described pathway could potentially be targeted
  at multiple levels for therapeutic intervention during RSV bronchiolitis, as depicted
  by the red inhibitory arrows. GATA3 = GATA3 binding protein; HMGB1 = high mobility
  group box 1; IFNaR = IFN-α receptor; ILC2 = group 2 innate lymphoid cell; MLKL = mixed
  lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase; Nec1s = 7-Cl-O-Necrostatin 1; NS1 = nonstructural
  protein 1; NS2 = nonstructural protein 2; NSA = necrosulfonamide; P = phosphorylated;
  RAGE = receptor for advance glycation end products; RIPK1 = receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine-protein kinase 1; RIPK3 = receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase 3; TLR4 = Toll-like receptor 4; TNFR = tumor necrosis factor receptor; TSLP = thymic
  stromal lymphopoietin.
