caption: Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) manipulates cell apoptosis. CVB3 infection can markedly
  induce myocardial apoptosis via death receptor–mediated and mitochondrial-mediated
  signaling pathways. Viral infection induces abnormal expression of Fas antigen in
  the myocardium and cross-links with FasL of active cells. Activated CTL binds to
  target cells via Fas/FasL and causes apoptosis. The PI3K and mTOR-signaling pathways
  participate in the CVB3-induced VMC by mediating the proapoptosis factor Bim, Bax,
  caspase-9, caspase-3, and viral replication. The inhibition of HDAC activity increases
  CVB3 replication by enhancing autophagosome formation and ensuing increased myocardial
  apoptosis. IL-17A mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis by regulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.
  miR-133 targets caspase-9 and promotes cardiac cell apoptosis. miR-15 could suppress
  cell viability and promote CVB3-induced cell apoptosis by modulating the NLRX1-mediated
  NLRP3 inflammasome. miR-21 alleviates CVB3-induced myocarditis by protecting myocardial
  apoptosis and repressing PDCD4 expression. CVB3-stimulated cytotoxicity can be inhibited
  by kinase ERK5, coupled with p38 kinase activity. However, p38 promotes apoptosis
  through ERK1/2 inhibition indirectly. c-Fos can compose AP-1 with c-jun gene products
  that regulate the transcription of apoptosis-related genes. Picornavirus protease
  2A in CVB3 induced apoptosis through multiple converging pathways. ER-initiated
  apoptosis was induced by CVB3-infected cardiomyocytes and caused myocardial apoptosis
  through ER stress by the PERK pathway. CP, which is located within the endoplasmic
  reticulum Ca2+ binding proteins, can relieve ERS-initiated apoptosis in VCM. CVB3,
