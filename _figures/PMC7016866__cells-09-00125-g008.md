caption: A model for the activation of Notch2 signaling in renal tubular epithelial
  cells under high glucose conditions and the possible actions of LE or LE/GC-KO in
  suppressing the Notch2 signaling cascade. Under high glucose conditions, multiple
  Notch signaling components including Delta-like 1, Jagged-1, cleaved Notch2 (NICD2),
  nicastrin (a component of the γ-secretase complex), and MAML-1 exhibit marked upregulation
  in renal tubular epithelial cells. In the nucleus, the activated Notch2 interacting
  with the transcription factor CSL and the co-activator MAML-1 results in the transcriptional
  activation of downstream target genes including HES/HEY family members, which are
  probably required for the modulation of renal tubular EMT and fibrogenesis. As shown
  in the study, licorice or de-glycyrrhizinated licorice may have different attenuation
  mechanisms for the activated Notch2 signaling pathway.
