caption: A schematic illustration of the oncogenic role of BANCR in modulating the
  RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in papillary thyroid carcinoma. The MAPK-signaling
  cascade is generally triggered via the activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase
  that could play an important role in activating RAS, which in turn, facilitates
  homo- or heterodimerization of wild-type BRAF. Activated BRAF could have a potential
  role in phosphorylating MEK (which is bound to KSR) that could phosphorylate ERK,
  and thereby leading to various cellular effects including proliferation and survival.
  Mutant BRAF could trigger dimerization and activation of MEK without Ras activation
  (). Growing evidence has demonstrated that lncRNA BANCR could play a crucial role
  in enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in papillary thyroid carcinoma via
  up-regulating the expression levels of CRAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 in tumor cells (,).
  Green arrows indicate the up-regulation of target genes modulated via lncRNA BANCR.
