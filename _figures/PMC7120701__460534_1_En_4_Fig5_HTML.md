caption: Collectin receptors on immune cells. Collectins have been shown to bind a
  number of receptors and putative receptors, which lead to immunomodulatory responses.
  Binding of collectins to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), TLR-4, SP-A receptor 210
  (SP-R210), CD91-calreticulin, and signal inhibitory regulatory protein-α (SIRP-α)
  alters production of pro-inflammatory mediators. For example, SP-A and SP-D binds
  to SIRP-α via their collagenous tails, and stimulates pro-inflammatory chemokine
  production via calreticulin/CD91 interaction. Furthermore, bacterium bound collectins
  induces the conformational changes of calreticulin/CD91 interaction, which then
  activates P38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, leading
  to transcriptional activation of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells), and expression of pro-inflammatory cykines, including tumour
  necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). SIRP-α is abundantly expressed in macrophages, and
  ligation of SIRP-α by lung collectins are crucial in preventing damage to the airways
  caused by the production of pro-inflammatory responses. Thereby, phosphorylated
  cytoplasmic region of SIRP-α recruits SHP-1 (Src homology region 2 domain-containing
  phosphatase-1), which in turn dephosphorylates protein substrates involved in mediating
  physiological effects. Thus, the interaction between SIRP-α and SHP-1 negatively
  regulates P38-MAP kinase signalling, and stimulates NF-κB activity, and cells become
  resistant to TNF-mediated effects, such as apoptosis
