caption: Transductional pathways associated with 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) activation
  in neuronal and neuronal cell lines. In neurons, receptor activation releases βγ
  and promotes an increase in AC II activity, with concomitant increase in AMPc levels
  and PKA activation. The βγ complex also participates in the activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase
  (PI3K)-Akt pathway, which triggers an increase in phospho-ERK levels. Moreover,
  the PI3K-Akt-GSK-3β pathway increases mitochondrial transport in axons. Additionally,
  stimulation of the receptor increases Ca2+ levels, which also contributes to the
  activation of PKCα and ERK, reducing caspase-3 levels. Release of the βγ complex
  also activates a K+ rectifier channel (GIRK), allowing cell hyperpolarization. According
  to that described in cell lines, the association between receptor activity and the
  reduction in AC I activity is only valid in the case of the autoreceptor, such as
  in neurons of the raphe nucleus.
