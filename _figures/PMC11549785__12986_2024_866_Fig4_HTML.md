caption: 'LncRNAs orchestrate MR in solid tumor cells by influencing interactions
  between tumor and non-tumor cells in TME. LncRNAs directly impact the functions
  of tumor and non-tumor cells within the TME and establish intercellular signaling
  pathways that modify it, regulating tumor cell MR and ultimately promoting the malignant
  progression of tumors. In this figure, we mainly summarize that: (A) TAMs secret
  EVs which containing lncRNA HISLA to stabilize and upregulate HIF-1α in tumor cells.
  Enhanced HIF-1α expression mediates AG alterations to sustain the malignant growth
  of tumors by activating the transcription of GLUT1 and LDHA mRNAs. This process
  is further augmented by a reciprocal interaction where substantial lactate production
  by glycolytic tumor cells induces HISLA expression in macrophages, thus activating
  TAMs and creating a forward feedback loop that reinforces tumorigenic activities.
  (B) The chemokine CXCL14, produced by CAFs, has been identified to upregulate the
  expression of lncRNA LINC00092. Further, LINC00092 activates glycolysis in tumor
  cells by binding the PFKFB2 to facilitate MR of tumor cells'
