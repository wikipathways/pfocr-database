caption: Schematic images representing mammalian ovaries and the experimental design.
  (A) Different developmental stages of follicles are shown from primordial follicles
  to ovulation and formation of the corpus luteum. The PTEN–AKT–FOXO3 signaling pathway
  is represented in higher magnification of one primordial follicle, showing its role
  in the primordial–primary follicle transition. Dimerization and autophosphorylation
  of RPTK molecules result in the generation of PIP3 from PIP2. PTEN is a negative
  regulator of PI3K, which converts PIP3 to PIP2. Akt is activated by binding to PIP3
  and phosphorylated by PDK1. Activated AKT leads to phosphorylation of Foxo3a and
  its localization in the cytoplasm, preventing relocation of unphosphorylated Foxo3a
  to the nucleus to induce apoptosis. Activated AKT can also activate mTOR and induce
  cell survival and growth. (B) The experimental design of the study is shown for
  both the in vivo and in vitro groups. Created with BioRender.com.
