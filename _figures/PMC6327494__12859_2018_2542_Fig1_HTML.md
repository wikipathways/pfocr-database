caption: Schematic view of the CoMetGeNe model linking metabolic reactions and their
  encoding genes. a The undirected graph G′ represents the gene order of a given species.
  The reactions that gene products catalyze are indicated above each gene. b The directed
  graph D represents a metabolic pathway of the same species as in a. c The correspondence
  between reactions in D and genes in G′. d G is an undirected graph with the same
  vertex set as D built using the correspondence between reactions and genes. G represents
  gene neighborhood with respect to the reactions that the gene products catalyze.
  e L(D) is the line graph of D. By definition of the line graph, vertices of L(D)
  are arcs in D. Strongly connected components (SCCs) of L(D) are shaded in gray and
  assigned a label Si. f C is the condensation graph of L(D), obtained by replacing
  every SCC of L(D) with a single vertex
