caption: Our model about the pathophysiology of sporadic TAA, the model of the pathway
  from the double-face. The major risk factors, hypertension, age, and smoking, induce
  an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [–] and an upregulation
  of local renin-angiotensin system [] and the tissue injury, initially involving
  ECs and subsequently VSMCs. This determines the release of some damage-related products
  and proteins (i.e., heart shock proteins (HSPs), high-mobility group box-1, low
  molecular hyaluronic acid, fibronectin fragments, and others), called danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) []. DAMPs alert innate/inflammatory immune system interacting
  with TLR4 mediated signaling pathway, able to recognize both pathogens and endogenous
  ligands [, ]. Originally described as part of the first-line defense against Gram-negative
  bacteria, the best known member of TLRs, the TLR4, expressed on leukocytes and a
  large array of tissue and cell types, such as all aortic wall cells (particularly
  ECs and VSMCs), responds to these signals []. As a consequence, TLR4 activates and
  triggers an inflammatory response [–]. In turn, this determines a typical phenotypic
  switching of EC and VSMC cells due to activation of stress and stretch pathways
  accompanied by their dysfunction and senescence [, ]. In particular, it implies
  a differential change in their gene expression profile due prevalently of activation
  of Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factor and followed by production and
  release of the so-called arterial-associated senescence secretor phenotype (AASSP)
  characterized by numerous inflammatory mediators, mitotic and trophic factors, proteoglycans
  and metalloproteinases (MMP)s, such as MMP-2 and -9, and vasoactive molecules [,
  –]. In addition, this also induces the reduction of nitric oxide (NO) []. This complex
  scenario results in modifications of vascular tone and permeability and degradation
  of components of extracellular matrix (ECM) and elastic fragmentation. VR and MD
  are, hence, evocated, which can evolve in aneurysm, dissection and rupture of aorta
  wall [].
