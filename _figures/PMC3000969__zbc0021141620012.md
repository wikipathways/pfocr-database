caption: Activation of LOX from ferrous to the active ferric species by reaction with
  fatty acid hydroperoxide (LOOH). The initial fatty acid alkoxyl radical intermediate
  rearranges to an enzyme-associated epoxyallylic radical intermediate, Fe(III)-OH[L(O)•].
  This enzyme-intermediate complex can cycle back to the free ferrous LOX giving epoxyalcohol
  product via the hydroperoxide isomerase “oxygen rebound” pathway or dissociate,
  resulting in the free ferric LOX available for dioxygenase catalysis. Dissociation
  is facilitated by reaction with O2, giving an epoxyallylic peroxy radical L(O)-OO•
  that cannot react with Fe(III)-OH, will thus leave the enzyme, and will be reduced
  in the solution to the epoxyallylic hydroperoxide products we identified (products
  I and II in ). Spontaneous dissociation, almost absent with eLOX3, but more prominent
  with soybean LOX-1 or A451G eLOX3, under anaerobic conditions can also lead to enzyme
  oxidation, with the dissociated epoxyallylic radical undergoing nonenzymatic transformations
  in the solution to various products, including fatty acid dimers.
