caption: Functional variations in actionable pharmacogenes. (A) Eight actionable pharmacogene-drug
  pairs in COVID-19 treatment. (B) The mechanisms of G6PD in the occurrence of drug
  toxicity. The box with the gene name indicates the crucial pharmacogenes involved
  in the pathway. The arrow in the pathway indicates stimulation or conversion, while
  the “T”-type arrow indicates an inhabitation instead. (C) Frequency analyses for
  functional variants in G6PD. (D) The mechanisms of IFNL3 and IFNL4 in facilitating
  drug efficacy. The box with gene name indicates the crucial pharmacogenes involved
  in the pathway, and the box with a “P” mark on the upper left side indicates a phosphorylated
  protein. The arrow in the pathway indicates stimulation or conversion, while the
  “T”-type arrow indicates inhibition instead. The large yellow ellipse indicates
  the nucleus of cells, and the process in the ellipse indicated that this process
  occurred inside the cell nucleus and vice versa. (E) Frequency analyses for functional
  variants in IFNL3. (F) Frequency analyses for functional variants in IFNL4. For
  (C), (E) and (F), the Y-axis indicates the frequency of variations, while the X-axis
  indicates the fold change of variations. For fold change computation, the mean frequency
  of each functional variation among all populations was utilized as the standard.
