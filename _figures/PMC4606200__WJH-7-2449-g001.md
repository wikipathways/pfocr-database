caption: 'Programmed death-1 causes T cell exhaustion. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibits
  the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway through src homology 2-containing protein-tyrosine
  phosphatase 2 (SHP2). PD-1 is located in the immune synapse at the T cell-antigen
  presenting cell (APC) interface. When its physiological ligand (PD-L1 or PD-L2)
  binds, PD-1 suppresses the activation and function of T cells through the recruitment
  of SHP-2, which dephosphorylates and inactivates ZAP70, a major integrator of TCR-mediated
  signaling. In chronically activated (“exhausted”) T cells, interferon (IFN)-α causes
  overexpression of PD-1 through the binding of the transcription factor IRF9 to the
  signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT2 promoters. PD-1
  also results in accumulation of p27kip1, which is an inhibitor of cyclin dependent
  kinases to block cell cycle and proliferation[]. ZAP70: Zeta-chain (TCR) associated
  protein kinase 70 kDa; IRF9: Interferon regulatory factor 9; JAK1: Janus kinase
