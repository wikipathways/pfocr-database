caption: Loss of LKB1 drives the tumor immune escape. The loss of LKB1, the second
  most commonly altered tumor suppressor in NSCLC, promotes the production of SAM,
  a substrate for the DNA and histone methyltransferases DNMT1, EZH2 and other epigenetic
  silencing enzymes. This downregulates the expression of STING, impairing dsDNA sensing,
  and thereby the expression of immune checkpoint regulating proteins like PD-L1 and
  T cell chemokines. Therefore, the LKB1-deficient tumors are characterized by a so-called
  “cold” immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (blue), which shows the striking
  infiltration of immunosuppressive cells (TAN; tumor-associated neutrophil; Treg,
  T lymphocyte regulator, blue) and the exclusion of inflamed immune cells (CD8 T
  cells, NK, CD4 T cells and M1; Macrophage type 1, red). Epigenetic therapies that
  reactivate LKB1 or the STING pathway may boost an anticancer immune response in
  LKB1-deficient cancers with the resistance to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICI, immune
  checkpoint inhibitor).
