caption: Pathogen Effector Proteins Enhance Susceptibility by Interfering with PRR-Mediated
  Signaling or Mimicking Peptide Hormones.Different effectors and molecular patterns
  are colored in purple. The fungal apoplastic effectors ECP6 and SLP1 compete with
  plant receptors for chitin binding. Bacterial cytoplasmic effectors can block PRR-mediated
  signaling by physically inhibiting (AvrPto and AvrPtoB) or dephosphorylating (HopAO1)
  PRR kinases, proteolysis of coreceptors (HopB1), proteolysis (AvrPphB) or uridylylation
  (AvrAC) of RLCKs, ADP-ribosylation of MAPKK or BAK1 (HopF2), or dephosphorylation
  of MPKs (HopAI1). AvrB induces phosphorylation of RIN4 to stimulate plasma membrane
  proton ATPase activity. Fungal apoplastic effector F-RALF mimics plant RALF peptide
  to induce the FER-mediated signaling pathway, which inhibits PRR-specified immunity
  through crosstalk. The bacterial protein RaxX may mimic plant peptide PSY1 to stimulate
  PSY1R-mediated signaling, which is known to inhibit PRR-mediated immunity.
