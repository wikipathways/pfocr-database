caption: CVB3-induced the PI3K-Akt-mTOR-apoptosis signaling pathway. This example
  shown is CVB3 stimulating Akt at T308 site, and then phosphorylating mTORC1. Thereby,
  4EBP1 and p70S6K are activated and the mRNA translation and protein synthesis are
  continued, which further promotes the CVB3 replication. Finally, the viral-induced
  apoptosis is exacerbated. The point in the pathway that continued fully activation
  of the mTORC1 signal may lead to the feedback inhibition of mTORC2, and thereby
  the phosphorylation of Akt is blocked and then the activation of mTORC1 is inhibited,
  which breaks that circle
