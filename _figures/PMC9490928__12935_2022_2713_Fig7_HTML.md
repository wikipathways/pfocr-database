caption: Hypothetical overview of multiple actions of β-escin on cancer stem-like
  features, HER2/HER3/Akt pathway and trastuzumab resistance within HER2-positive
  breast cancer. β-escin exerts antitumor activity via the intrinsic mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathway and suppression of cancer stem-like properties including CD44high/CD24low
  stem-like population and ALDH1 activity. Mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis was accompanied
  by elevated oxidative stress and a marked increase in active p18Bax fragment levels,
  leading to the release of cytochrome c as well as consequent activation of caspase-3
  and caspase-7. β-escin impairs the HER2/HER3/Akt pathway coinciding with downregulation
  of truncated-p95HER2 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells that are both trastuzumab-sensitive
  and –resistant
