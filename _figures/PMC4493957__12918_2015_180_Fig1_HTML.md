caption: The pathway topology proposed in []. We used this model as our true model
  and generated data based upon it. The black lines with small arrow tips depict the
  transition between different species in the model like production, degradation or
  complex formation. The black lines with open circle tips depict the phosphorylation
  process by kinases. The lines with open triangle tips show activating regulatory
  interactions whereas lines with blunt ends show deactivating regulatory interactions.
  The red colored double arrow denotes the post translational regulation of glycerol
  production by the active phosphorylated Hog1 protein. We did not consider this regulatory
  interaction in our simplified model. The dotted ellipses in the upper left hand
  corner indicate the two different upstream activation routes important in our study.
  Parts of the pathway whose parameters were affected by the choice of the partitioning
  scheme were highlighted yellow and gray. We explained the changes in the parameters
  of those regions in our results section. (Figure adopted from [])
