caption: Although distal 11q copy number loss, from band 11q14 to 11qter has been
  reported in many types of tumors, its significance had not been investigated until
  our previous study (). Copy number loss appears to be centered around 11q22 to 11q23,
  in the vicinity of the ATM gene. We showed copy number loss of the region from 11q21
  to 11q24 in about 25% of OSCC, breast and ovarian primary tumors and a high frequency
  of loss in OSCC cell lines (). The Broad Institute TCGA and Tumorscape websites
  support our observations, showing ATM copy number loss in about 20–25% of all cancers
  and frequencies of loss as high as 54% in cutaneous melanomas and 48% in invasive
  breast adenocarcinomas and HNSCC. We showed previously that distal 11q loss is associated
  with resistance to radiation therapy and our current results confirm and extend
  this finding (). AT cells, lacking a functional ATM protein, are radiosensitive
  because the presence of ATM protein 1 h post-irradiation is essential for the survival
  of cells (). In contrast, tumor cells with distal 11q loss retain some ATM expression
  that based on our results, is sufficient to provide the cells the ability to ‘repair’
  their DSB and survive IR treatment. AT cells that lack ATM protein upregulate the
  ATR-CHEK1 pathway resulting in a prolonged G2M arrest (). Similarily we observed
  upregulation of the ATR-CHEK1 pathway and cell cycle arrest in the S and G2M phases
  after IR treatment of tumor cells with distal 11q loss. S/G2M arrest and subsequent
  repair prevents the entry into mitosis of cells with DNA damage, which would lead
  to mitotic catastrophe. Instead, these cells seem to ‘repair’ the damaged DNA, enabling
  survival and resulting in decreased sensitivity to IR. Knockdown of the ATR-CHEK1
  pathway using siRNA or the Pfizer CHEK1 inhibitor resulted in resensitization of
  the cells with distal 11q loss to IR, which led to cell death by mitotic catastrophe
  (). Since CHEK1 inhibitors are being developed by several companies, our results
  suggest that distal 11q loss (with particular emphasis on ATM copy number loss)
  may be a useful companion diagnostic biomarker to select the subgroup of OSCC patients
  expected to respond poorly to radiation therapy, but better to combined radiation
  therapy and CHEK1 or ATR inhibition.
