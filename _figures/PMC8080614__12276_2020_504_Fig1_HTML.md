caption: Glutamine enters through several plasma membrane glutamine transporters and
  is then utilized in the cytosol in processes such as the biosynthesis of nucleotides,
  asparagine, and UDP-GlcNAc. For glutaminolysis, glutamine is transported into the
  mitochondrial matrix through the SLC1A5 variant and subsequently converted to glutamate
  by GLS. Next, GLUD1 or several aminotransferases catalyze the deamidation of glutamate,
  producing α-KG. Glutamine-derived α-KG supplies metabolites for the TCA cycle and
  fuels the generation of 2-HG under conditions of IDH2 mutation or hypoxia. Citrate
  derived from glutamine via reductive carboxylation supports fatty acid synthesis
  under conditions of hypoxia or HIF-2α transcription factor stabilization. Glutamine-derived
  α-KG also activates the mTORC1 pathway. Α-KG and 2-HG affect epigenetic modification
  through α-KG-dependent dioxygenases. Gln glutamine, Glu glutamate, Asn asparagine,
  Cys cystine, Asp aspartate, αKG α-ketoglutarate, PRA 5-phosphoribosyl-1-amine, CP
  carbamoyl phosphate, GFAT glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase, ASNS asparagine
  synthetase, PPAT phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase, CPS carbamoyl phosphate
  synthetase, GLS glutaminase, GLUD glutamate dehydrogenase, GOT glutamic-oxaloacetic
  transaminase, GPT glutamic-pyruvate transaminase, IDH isocitrate dehydrogenase,
  2-HG 2-hydroxyglutarate, Me methylation.
