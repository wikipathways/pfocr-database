caption: Brief diagrammatic representation of radiation injury and the mode of action
  of radiation countermeasures at advanced stages of development. This simplified
  response pathway of a subject's irradiation shows that radiation exposure induces
  free radicals, DNA breaks and apoptosis. The various radiation countermeasures reduce
  the injurious effects of irradiation through different pathways as indicated by
  colored arrows. Only the drugs with well-understood mechanism of action are included
  and may have been indicated at multiple points, as several drugs work through several
  pathways. Red arrows indicate inhibition of deleterious effects of radiation injury
  and green arrows indicate enhancement of recovery.
