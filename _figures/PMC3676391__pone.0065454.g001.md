caption: (A) The components of the AdipoR1 signaling pathway of mammalian cells are
  shown in black font and their S. cerevisiae homologs, if known are shown in red
  font. In mammalian cells, adaptor protein containing pleckstrin homology domain,
  phosphotyrosine binding domain and leucine zipper motif 1 (APPL1) interacts directly
  with AdipoR1. Interaction of adiponectin (ADPN) with AdipoR1 stimulates AdipoR1-APPL1
  interaction. This results in release of Ca2+ from the ER to the cytosol and also
  increases export of LKB1 kinase from the nucleus. Influx of extracellular Ca2+ to
  the cytosol is also stimulated by adiponectin, although the mechanism by which this
  occurs remains to be clarified. Increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration activates
  Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) which in turn activates
  AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) by phosphorylating its α subunit. However, phosphorylation
  of AMPK α subunit by the cytosol-localized kinase LKB1 is the major pathway for
  activation of AMPK. Adiponectin-AdipoR1 interaction also increases cellular ceramidase
  activity which in turn leads to phosphorylation of AMPKα subunit. The details of
  this pathway are not clear yet. Activation of AMPK is required for many of the anti-diabetic
  and anti-atherosclerotic effects of adiponectin. In vascular endothelial cells,
  interaction of AdipoR1 with adiponectin activates protein kinase A (PKA) which has
  the effect of lowering accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby
  reducing inflammation. (B) Subunit structure of S. cerevisiae AMPK (ScAMPK). Like
  mammalian AMPK, ScAMPK is a trimer composed of an α, β, and γ subunit. The genes
  encoding the β subunit isoforms as well as the sole α and γ subunits are indicated.
  (C) Components of the IZH2-mediated signaling pathways in S. cerevisiae are shown
  in red font. Interaction of IZH2 (homolog of AdipoRs) with osmotin (OSM) activates
  PKA via a RAS2-cAMP pathway. Overexpression of IZH2, overexpression of AdipoR1,
  treatment of S. cerevisiae cells expressing AdipoR1 with adiponectin and treatment
  of S. cerevisiae cells expressing various levels of IZH2 with thaumatin (THN, a
  homolog of osmotin) has been shown to activate PKA by increasing cellular ceramidase
  activity. Activation of PKA leads to decreased transcription from a stress responsive
  promoter element (STRE) and increased cellular ROS content. Activated PKA promotes
  export of ScAMPK from the nucleus which leads to decreased transcription from the
  ferroxidase (FET3) promoter. Activated PKA also represses FET3 transcription via
  the stress-responsive transcription factors MSN2/4. Mutational analyses show that
  genes encoding the APPL1-lke protein Sip3, the LKB1-like protein Sak1, the ScAMPK
  β subunit Sip1 and the ScAMPK γ subunit Snf4 are components of the pathway leading
  from IZH2 (or AdipoR1) to FET3 repression in S. cerevisiae.
