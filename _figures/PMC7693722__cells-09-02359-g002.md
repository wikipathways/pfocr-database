caption: 'The hypoxic signaling pathway. The hypoxic signaling pathway: Under normoxia
  HIFα is hydroxylated by PHD and FIH hydroxylases in an oxygen dependent manner.
  Hydroxylation by PHD leads to pVHL and E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment, ubiquitination
  of HIFα and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by FIH leads to transcriptional
  inactivation. Low O2 inactivates both PHD and FIH hydroxylases, HIFα is stabilized,
  enters the nucleus, dimerizes with HIF-1β (ARNT), binds to specific DNA elements
  (hypoxia responsive elements) and, in association with transcription coactivators
  such as CBP/p300, stimulates the transcription of hypoxia target genes.'
