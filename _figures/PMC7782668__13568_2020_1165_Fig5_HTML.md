caption: Expression levels of pigments biosynthetic genes in proposed biosynthetic
  pathway of MPs. The expression levels of 13 genes on the 3rd, 5th, and 7th day of
  fermentation of the control and AN treatment samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR. The
  control samples were 1 (3 days), 3 (5 days), 5 (7 days), and the AN samples were
  2 (3 days), 4 (5 days), 6 (7 days). The transcriptional levels were normalized to
  those of the actin gene. The mRNA levels on the 3rd day of control were used as
  the reference value. The assay was repeated by three times
