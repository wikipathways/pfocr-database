caption: Proepicardial cells, likely a heterogeneous population (as indicated by shading),
  differentiate down the cardiomyocyte lineage in response to BMP signaling or down
  a non-cardiomyocyte cardiac lineage in response to FGF signaling. Further, the FGF
  signaling pathway is dominant over the BMP pathway as FGF signaling through ERK
  can block BMP-induced cardiomyocyte differentiation.
