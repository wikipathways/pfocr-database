caption: Model pathway. Cs+ induces the JA pathway and inhibits plant growth. Cs+
  also induces HAK5 expression. Whether this expression is due to Cs+-induced K+ deficiency
  or the direct effect of Cs+ is not yet clear. An antagonistic effect of the JA pathway
  on HAK5 expression is also suggested.
