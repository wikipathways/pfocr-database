caption: 'Loss of Treg-mediated immune homeostasis and increased risk of psychosisTregs
  are the “guardians” of immune homeostasis; they control the balance between the
  innate and adaptive immune systems, regulate neuron-glial interactions and limit
  inappropriate inflammation. Middle: There are two main populations of Tregs (light-green
  cells) based on their developmental origin, thymus-derived (tTregs, pink box) and
  peripherally-induced (pTregs, blue box). tTregs develop from CD4+CD8− T cells (grey
  cell), while pTregs are generated extrathymically from naïve CD4+T-cells (marsala
  cells). FoxP3, a Forkhead family transcription factor, is the master regulator of
  Tregs, critical for their development and suppressive capacity. Tregs may be more
  prone to FoxP3 destabilisation in psychosis due to polygenic risk variants influencing
  the cell suppressive capacity directly (pink box) or indirectly via enhanced IL-6
  trans-signalling pathway from innate immune cells (light-purple cells, blue box).
  IL-6 trans-signalling interferes with the generation of newly immunosuppressive
  pTregs (faint grey arrow with negative sign), generating instead pathogenic effector
  T (Teff) cells (bold black arrow with a positive sign) (see  for mechanism). Thus,
  both IL-6 and Teffs-produced pro-cytokines contribute to or sustain a polygenic
  hypofunctional Treg state (black inhibitory signs). Top: Symptoms of psychosis may
  arise from aberrant hypofunctional Treg-glial dysregulation. Tregs in the meninges
  and brain lymphatic system influence glial function through various immune signals;
  hypofunctional Tregs fail to maintain a balanced interaction between microglia and
  astrocytes, which together fail to prevent or adapt to dysfunctional neural development
  and neurotransmission. Bottom: Genetic and epigenetic predisposition to a hypofunctional
  Treg signature releases the gain of function of myeloid and effector T cells generating
  a low-grade inflammatory state that sustains an impaired Treg capacity. Breakdown
  of the Treg homeostasis is associated with several comorbidities of psychosis. For
  more information, see the main text and . (For interpretation of the references
