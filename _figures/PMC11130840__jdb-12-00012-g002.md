caption: Cilial PCP signaling pathway. Fuzzy arbitrates the relative activity of canonical
  and noncanonical (PCP) Wnt pathways and transports Dvl to the cilium via Rab8(+)
  vesicular traffic. Rab8 and Dvl2 must be recruited by Fuzzy to the polarized trafficking
  route in ciliated cells for both molecules to reach the primary cilium. Dvl2, which
  is intracellularly accessible for canonical Wnt signaling, is reduced by sequestering
  it into vesicles. Dvl2 orchestrates basal body polarization and promotes PCP signaling
  at the cilium of wild-type cells. Without Fuzzy, ciliogenesis is hampered, Dvl2
  recruitment to the basal bodies is impaired, and the Rab8-trafficking route is interfered
