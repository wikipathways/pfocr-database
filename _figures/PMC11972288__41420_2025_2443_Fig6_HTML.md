caption: We identified the key target gene, CHI3L1, which was significantly upregulated
  in the intestinal tissues of both affected children and model mice from the GEO
  database. We conducted validations at both the cellular and animal levels, demonstrating
  that the inhibition or knockdown of CHI3L1 significantly reduced the severity of
  NEC. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the knockdown of CHI3L1 inhibited
  the PI3K-Akt-FoxO1 signalling pathway, alleviating excessive autophagy in intestinal
  epithelial cells, and subsequently reducing injury and inflammatory responses. Moreover,
  clinical studies indicated that high serum levels of CHI3L1 in children correlate
  with increased incidence and severity of NEC, as well as with DAAS, CRP, PCT, RDW,
  and LDH
