caption: 'Oncogene-induced senescence begins with activation of an oncogene in a primary
  (normal) mammalian cell. This upregulates the repressive E2F7, which inhibits transcription
  of the RRM2 gene. Inhibition of RRM2 leads to a significant decrease in dNTP levels.
  This leads to two outcomes: 1) replication stress and accumulation of DNA damage;
  and 2) upregulation of p16 through an unknown mechanism. Replication stress and
  DNA damage accumulation activates the DNA damage response (DDR), in particular p53.
  p53 activation positively feeds back by further increasing E2F7 activity. Sustained
  activation of p53 induces high expression of p21, which helps facilitate cell cycle
  arrest. DNA damage can also lead to cell cycle arrest independent of p53 and p21
  status. Upregulation of p16 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which relieves
  their inhibition of pRb. pRb can then repress E2F1 activity, which leads to more
  E2F7 binding to repress RRM2 transcription. Decreased E2F1 also leads to a cell
  cycle exit through a decrease in transcription of numerous cell cycle-related genes.
  These pathways all act in concert to establish and maintain the stable senescence-associated
  cell cycle exit.'
