caption: Immunopathology of COVID-19. (A) Pathway by which SARS-CoV-2 induces expression
  of cytokines, chemokines, and interferons. SARS-CoV-2 binds to host ACE2 and TMPRSS2
  to gain entry into cells and then releases its RNA to the cytoplasm. This RNA is
  then recognized by the innate immune pathway via PAMP receptors including RIG-I
  and MDA-5, which then bind to MAVS that activates NF-κB through a signalling cascade
  involving E3 ubiquitin kinases. Activated NF-κB can then translocate into the nucleus,
  where it induces transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The
  E3 ubiquitin kinases and ligands also phosphorylate IRF3 and IRF7, which enter the
  nucleus to initiate transcription of IFN I. (B) Mechanisms of evasion of the innate
  immune response by SARS-CoV-2. Although IFNs play a key role in the initiation of
  the innate immune response, SARS-CoV-2 induces delayed IFN I secretion, particularly
  in older patients and those with comorbidities, which reduces chemotaxis resulting
  in a weaker innate immune response. This weakened response allows enhanced viral
  replication, which results in hyper-activation of Th1 cells that, in turn, activate
  macrophages by releasing IFN-γ. This activation leads to the production and secretion
  of IL1, IL6, IL8, and TGF-β, the latter of which activates Th17 cells to secrete
  IL17, which, collectively, produces the cytokine storm.
