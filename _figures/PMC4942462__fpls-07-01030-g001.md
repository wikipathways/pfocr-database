caption: General pathway for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and derived products.
  The shikimate pathway connects central carbon metabolism (glycolysis and pentose
  phosphate pathways) with the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and derived products.
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate; CM, chorismate mutase; AS,
  anthranilate synthase.
