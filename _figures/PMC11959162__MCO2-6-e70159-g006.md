caption: 'Phosphorylation in signaling pathways involved in osteoblast differentiation.
  Note: In the regulation of osteogenesis, phosphorylation is implicated in some pathways
  indispensable for osteoblastogenesis. (A) Smad proteins are phosphorylated to bind
  to SMAD4, which further signifies commitment to osteoblast. (B) SMO is phosphorylated
  after HH ligand binds to Ptc, which leads to Cos2 phosphorylation and Ci dephosphorylation
  that causes elevated transcription of RUNX2. (C) Phosphorylation of GSK‐3β is suppressed
  when Frizzled is activated by WNT ligand, which results in increased RUNX2 and OSX
  expression and promotes osteoblast differentiation. Phosphorylation of GSK‐3β is
  conversely promoted by sclerostin that inhibits commitment to osteoblast. (D) FGFR
  is phosphorylated after interaction with FGF, which leads to activation of several
  signaling pathways and osteoblastogenesis'
