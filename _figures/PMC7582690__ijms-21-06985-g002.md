caption: The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway converges to facilitate the progression OS.
  Most factors directly activate PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to promote the migration
  and invasion of OS. For example, overexpression of Fibulin-4, Fractalkine/CX3CR1,
  ZIC2, LINC0096, and lncRNA H19 promote the osteosarcoma metastasis through the activation
  of PI3K/Akt signal pathway. Meanwhile, GPNMB and DANCR/miR-33a-5p activate the PI3K/Akt
  pathway by promoting the expression of IGF-1 and AX, respectively. TSSC3 inhibits
  the phosphorylation of Src to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Conversely,
  overexpression of LINC00628 inhibits the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt. The solid
  lines refer to protein molecules and the dotted lines refer to non-coding RNAs in
  this figure. Black arrows show the promotion of molecules, while red dots show the
  inhibition of molecules.
