caption: Metabolite changes were visualized in KEGG pathway maps. Purple and yellow
  circles represent metabolites upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in response
  to VE-821 treatment. Left and right halves of the indicated metabolites show changes
  6 and 12 hours after irradiation, respectively. Enzymes containing phosphorylation
  sites affected by VE-821 treatment are indicated by red and blue rounded rectangles.
