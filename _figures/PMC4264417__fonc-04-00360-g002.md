caption: 'The Notch receptor and pathway. (A) The Notch receptor is composed of several
  domains that can be divided between the extracellular domain (NECD) and the transmembrane
  and intracellular domain (NTMICD). The NECD begins at the N-terminus (NH3) end of
  the Notch receptor and contains ligand binding epidermal growth factor-like (EGF)
  repeats and the negative regulatory region (NRR). Fringe proteins target the EGF
  repeats for glycosylation, which can augment their ligand binding ability to the
  Notch receptor. The NRR is composed of Lin12-Notch repeats (L) and the heterodimerization
  domain (HD), which aid in maintaining a closed conformation of the Notch receptor
  until ligand binding. The NTMICD contains: the transmembrane domain (T, TMB), the
  RBP-Jκ associating module (R) or RAM domain, one of two nuclear localization signals
  (N), the ankyrin domain, a second nuclear localization signal, the cysteine response
  region (NCR), the transactivating domain (TAD), and a proline/glutamic acid/serine/threonine-rich
  motif (PEST) at the C-terminal (COOH) end of the Notch receptor. Ligand bound Notch
  is cleaved at a series of scissile sites (S1, 2, 3, 4), which are represented just
  outside of (S1) and inside the transmembrane domain (S2, 3, 4) (TMB enlargement).
  Furin-like convertase cleaves immature Notch at S1 to create the mature, heterodimeric
  Notch receptor, which is stabilized by a non-covalently bound calcium ion (Ca).
  The RAM domain facilitates core binding factor-1 (CBF-1) binding, the ankyrin domain
  binds mammal-like mastermind-1 (MAML-1) and p300 (p300), which are necessary components
  of the Notch transcriptional activating complex. The PEST domain is responsible
  for degradation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). (B). There are four Notch
  receptor paralogs, each similar in overall composition but with slight structural
  differences that facilitate their diverse attributes. From top to bottom are Notch-1,
  -2, -3, and -4. Notch-1 is the most studied Notch receptor containing all of the
  above mentioned domains with 36 EGF-like repeats. Notch-2 is similar to Notch-1
  except for differences in its EGF-like repeats as well as the ability of Notch-2
  to bind to Jagged-1 upon fringe modification (). Notch-3 has a slightly truncated
  EGF-like domain with 34 repeats and lacks a transactivating domain. Notch-4 is the
  smallest of the Notch receptor paralogs with 29 EGF-like repeats, a shorter NICD
  due to a lack of a transactivating domain and cysteine response region, as well
  as the addition of a PDZ-Domain [Post-synaptic Density Protein (PSD)-95] (PDZ) that
  plays a critical role in proper neuronal development (). (C) The Notch pathway is
  activated by a Notch-ligand (jagged-1, -2, DLL-1, 3, 4) expressed on a signal sending
  cell binding to a Notch receptor (Notch 1, 2, 3, 4) on a signal receiving cell.
  Ligand bound Notch undergoes a series of cleavages, first by a disintigrin and metalloproteinase/tumor
  necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (ADAM/TACE) at the S2 cleavage site to form
  the Notch extracellular truncation (NEXT) fragment. The NEXT fragment is targeted
  by the γ-Secretase complex for cleavage. The γ-secretase complex is composed of
  nicastrin, anterior PHarynx-defective 1 (APH-1), presenilin ENhancer 2 (PEN-2),
  and the active component of the complex, presenilin-1. γ-Secretase is inhibited
  by γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), which prevent Notch cleavage and transcriptional
  activation. Proper cleavage of the Notch receptor releases NICD, allowing NICD to
  travel to and enter the nucleus where NICD binds to promoter bound CBF-1, allowing
  CBF-1 to release negative co-regulators (NCoR) and recruit transcriptional co-activators.
  NICD-mediated transcription cannot occur without the recruitment of mammalian mastermind-like-1
  (MAML-1) and the histone acetyltransferase, p300, to unwind the compressed DNA allowing
  transcription of the Notch targeted genes. Notch activates the transcription of
  canonical target genes such as: hairy enhancer of split-1 (HES-1), hairy/enhancer
  of split with an YRPW motif-1 (HEY-1), and non-canonical Notch target genes such
  as survivin.'
