caption: Schematic representation of the plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) molybdenum cofactor
  (Moco) biosynthesis pathway. The catalyzing enzymes and reaction intermediates are
  given. In the first step of the pathway, GTP is converted into 3′,8-cH2GTP,, which
  is subsequently turned over into cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). cPMP
  is the substrate of the MPT-synthase complex (Cnx6 + Cnx7) catalyzing the formation
  of a hemisulfurated intermediate and finally molybdopterin (MPT). After each reaction
  cycle, the MPT synthase needs to be re-sulfurated, which is catalyzed by Cnx5 in
  Arabidopsis. MPT is a substrate of the molybdenum insertase (Mo-insertase) Cnx1.
  Here, the Cnx1-G domain catalyzes the formation of adenylated MPT (MPT-AMP,), which
  is used as the substrate for the E-domain catalyzed molybdate insertion, and results
  in the formation of physiologically active Moco. Both the reaction mechanism describing
  molybdate insertion into the MPT dithiol and the first coordination sphere geometry
  of Moco following this last step in cofactor biosynthesis are unknown.
