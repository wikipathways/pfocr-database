caption: Irisin has pleiotropic effects, as it exerts multiple, diverse biological
  actions in different tissues and organ systems, meaning its effects are not limited
  to one specific function but span several physiological processes that impact metabolism,
  muscle function, fat storage, bone health, and brain activity. In particular, in
  skeletal muscle, irisin triggers the (MAPK)-PGC-1α pathway, thus improving oxidative
  phosphorylation and consequently mitochondrial respiration, together with an increase
  in GLUT4 translocation. At the same time, in cardiac tissue, GLUT4 translocation
  appears downstream of the activation of the PI3K/PKB/Akt pathway, with the final
  result of improving glucose uptake. In relationship to the liver, downstream, the
  PI3K trigger Akt/GSK3 is then activated, leading to gluconeogenesis reduction and
  the concomitant induction of glycogen synthesis. Altogether, with the stimulation
  of all the aforementioned pathways, irisin can promote sensitization to glucose
  in insulin-dependent tissue, like the heart, skeletal muscle, and the liver (pink
  lines). This adipo-myokine plays a crucial role in the hepatic metabolism, as AMPK
  phosphorylation exerts anti-inflammatory potential by decreasing NLRP3 inflammasome
  and NFKβ (green lines). Through AMPK phosphorylation, irisin also participates in
  autophagic-related mechanisms via mTOR inhibition promoting osteoblastogenesis by
  the parallel activation of Wtn/β catenin signaling. Furthermore, irisin is involved
  in osteogenesis involving ERK signaling via p38 MAPK, the same pathway mediating
  GLUT4 translocation in muscle tissue (blue lines). Irisin plays a crucial role not
  only in muscle–bone crosstalk but also acts on many other peripheral organs. Moreover,
  irisin shows antioxidant effects in the intestine and pancreas, as it can upregulate
  UCP2, reducing both oxidative stress and ER stress in intestinal cells, additionally
  increasing mitochondrial function and biogenesis (violet lines). Interestingly,
  irisin exerts a protective action on pancreatic β-cells to stimulate insulin synthesis
  and glucose-induced insulin secretion. Specifically, irisin can block the apoptotic
  effects induced by selective saturated fatty acids in β-cells via the Akt and Bcl-2
  signaling pathway (red lines). Lastly, irisin acts as antihypertensive hormone,
  since it reduces blood pressure by activating the hypothalamic factor Nrf2, having
  a more selective effect on PVN nuclei for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
  action. Thus, this hormone cannot be simply identified for its single effects on
  specific organs, since its beneficial activity is provided by the synergistic combination
  of its action on multiple organs and systems
