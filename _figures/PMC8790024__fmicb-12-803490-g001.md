caption: Process for whole-cell bioconversion of baccatin III by wild-type DBAT (WT)
  and DBATS189V in E. coli. (1) Producing baccatin III using glucose as a carbon source.
  Glucose is metabolized to produce pyruvate, which in turn, produces acetyl-CoA,
  which provides acetyl groups for 10-DAB to produce baccatin III. (2) Producing baccatin
  III using glycerol as a carbon source. Glycerol is metabolized to produce DHAP,
  then metabolized by glycolysis to produce pyruvate, which in turn, produces acetyl-CoA,
  which provides acetyl groups for 10-DAB, and produces baccatin III. The dotted arrow
  indicates that the multi-step reaction process is omitted in this metabolic pathway
  diagram. The gray arrow points to the direction of the enzymatic reaction to produce
  baccatin III. DBAT and DBATS189V were overexpressed in E. coli by recombinant plasmids.
  Glc glucose, GY glycerol; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; 10-DAB, 10-deacetylbaccatin III; TAC, tricarboxylic acid cycle; DBAT,
