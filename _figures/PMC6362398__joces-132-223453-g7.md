caption: Model of how EMC-mediated protein biogenesis influences cholesterol homeostasis.
  (A) The EMC promotes the post-translational insertion of SQS into the ER membrane
  (i) and maturation of SOAT1 co-translationally (ii). The correct insertion and/or
  maturation of EMC-dependent proteins maintain cholesterol metabolic pathways by
  ensuring sufficient expression of enzymes essential for cholesterol biosynthesis
  and storage in the form of cholesteryl esters (iii, iv). These activities enable
  the biosynthetic and import pathways to maintain sufficient free cholesterol in
  cells. Additionally, the EMC is involved directly (or indirectly) in the biogenesis
  of other putative membrane-bound ‘clients’ with a variety of cellular roles (v).
  (B) Absence of the EMC precludes SQS insertion, resulting in its premature degradation
  via the proteasome (vi). Similarly, SOAT1 expression is also reduced co-/post-translationally
  due to defective biogenesis (vi, vii). The reduction of steady-state levels of both
  enzymes (depicted in grey) leads to increased utilisation of the mevalonate pathway
  intermediate FPP for non-sterol isoprenoid biosynthesis (viii), decreased cholesterol
  biosynthesis and reduced capability to store cholesterol as cholesteryl ester (ix),
  while at the same time maintaining sufficient free cholesterol to support viability
  (x). The consequential loss of other EMC clients may be manifest as non-lethal impairments
  detectable only when targeted or monitored directly.
