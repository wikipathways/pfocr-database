caption: The hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG; yellow), thyroid/metabolic (HPT;
  green), and adrenal (HPA; purple) axes are highly integrated via the activity of
  gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) and its receptor (GnIH-R). As part of the
  HPG axis, GnIH neurons elicit an inhibitory effect on gonadotropin-releasing hormone
  I (GnRH-I) neurons (hypothalamus) and gonadotroph cells (pituitary gland) in all
  species, in addition to suppressing the activity of kisspeptin (Kiss-1) neurons
  in mammalian species (hypothalamus). Additional GnIH-Rs on GnRH-II neurons in the
  midbrain contribute to the inhibition of sexual behaviors. In seasonal breeders,
  photoperiod influences the expression of GnIH, with short day (SD) lengths elevating
  GnIH and inhibiting reproduction, while long day (LD) lengths diminish GnIH expression
  and permits the progression of sexual maturation, via gonadotropin production. Acting
  at the level of the gonads (ovary and testis), the production of sex steroids further
  downregulates GnIH-R expressed in the pituitary gland. Simultaneously, GnIH neurons
  stimulate the orexigenic peptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide
  (AgRP), and downregulate the anorexigenic peptide pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). Overall,
  this results in an increase in feed intake, promoting an upregulation of the HPT
  axis. Ghrelin from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) also contributes to this elevation
  in feed intake and knockout (KO) of the GnIH-R can downregulate this pathway. Active
  conversion of thyroid hormones (T4 → T3) stimulates the release of GnRH from the
  hypothalamus, thus activating the HPG axis. Finally, the HPA (stress) axis also
  provides input to GnIH neurons. While GnIH can bind to pituitary corticotropes and
  the adrenal cortex to promote an elevation in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
  and glucocorticoids, respectively, elevations in glucocorticoids positively feedback
  on GnIH neurons. This results in an inhibitory effect on reproductive activity,
  hypothesized to shift resources away from this energetically expensive process and
  towards managing the stressor.
