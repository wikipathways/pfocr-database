caption: 'Cellular signaling pathways involved in cell senescence in renal ageing.
  In renal ageing, cell senescence signaling pathways are activated not only by stress
  factors or diseases, such as AKI, hypertension, diabetes, and cytotoxic drugs, etc,
  but also by ageing per se. The key signaling cascades implicated in renal cell senescence
  are p53/p21CIP1 and p16INK4a/Rb pathways, which in turn inhibit CDK complexes and
  Rb phosphorylation. Ultimately, these signals execute cell senescence via Rb suppression
  of the activity of E2F, characterized by cell proliferation arrest, apoptosis/proliferation
  imbalance and secretion of SASP factors. Hence, the repair capacity declines and
  the ageing kidney becomes more susceptible to injury. Klotho and SIRT1 have been
  shown as main modulators of cell senescence and inhibit cell senescence through
  regulating p53/p21CIP1pathway. Whereas, Wnt9a accelerates renal fibrosis via promoting
  cell senescence signaling pathways, so does GSK3β. Abbreviations: AKI, acute kidney
  disease; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; Rb, retinoblastoma
  protein; SASP, senescence-associated secretory phenotype.'
