caption: 'The potentially achieved biosynthetic bypasses of photorespiration in plants.
  Two glycolate decarboxylation bypasses are marked by orange (; ; ). GDH, glycolate
  dehydrogenase; HDH, hydroxyacid dehydrogenase; ODC, oxalate decarboxylase; FDH,
  formate dehydrogenase; AGODH, CoA-acylating glyoxylate dehydrogenase; OXC, oxalyl-CoA
  decarboxylase; FRC, formyl-CoA transferase. Two different hypothetical bypasses
  to recycle glycolate without CO2 release are marked by green () and blue (), respectively.
  Tartronyl-CoA pathway (purple; Scheffen et al., 2021): GCS, glycolyl-CoA synthetase;
  GCC, glycolyl-CoA carboxylase; TCR, tartronyl-CoA reductase. The bypass converting
  glycolate to pyruvate (black and red; ): MCL, malyl-CoA lyase; MCH, mesaconyl-C1-CoA
  hydratase; MCT, mesaconyl-CoA C1:C4 CoA transferase; MEH, mesaconyl-C4-CoA hydratase;
  ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; MCR, malonyl-CoA reductase; PCS, propionyl-CoA synthase.
  The bypass converting glycolate to acetyl-CoA (black and dark red; ): GCL, glyoxylate
  carboligase; TSR, tartronic semialdehyde reductase; GK, glycerate kinase; ENO, enolase;
  PPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; MTK, malate thiokinase.'
