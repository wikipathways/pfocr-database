caption: 'Panel (A): Suppressor receptor Tim-3 and its ligand transmit inhibitory
  signals upon binding; Panel (B): Suppressor receptor LAG3 and its ligand transmit
  signals that inhibit T lymphocyte activation upon binding; Panel (C): CD244 binds
  to its ligand CD48, which is based on the immunoreceptor tyrosine switch motif (ITSM)
  that transmits stimulatory signals when bound to EST-2 and inhibitory signals when
  bound to SAP, and CD48 transmits stimulatory signals to T lymphocytes when bound
  to CD2, thus making CD48 a bidirectional switch; Panel (D): In the CD160/BTLA/LIGHT/LTα/HVEM
  signaling complex, HVEM transmits inhibitory signals when bound to BTLA or CD160,
  and HVEM transmits inhibitory signals when bound to LIGHT or LTα. Panel (E): TIGIT
  competitively binds CD155 and CD112 with CD226 and transmits inhibitory cell signaling.
  Also binding to CD155 and CD112 and then transmitting inhibitory signaling is CD96,
  but TIGIT is dominant among them. In addition to transmitting inhibitory signaling
  on its own, TIGIT also directly inhibits the TCR signaling pathway. (Created with
