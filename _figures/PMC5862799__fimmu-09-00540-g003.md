caption: The metabolic pathways utilized by T cells in nutrient replete versus metabolically
  challenging environments. Under homeostatic conditions, glucose enters the cytosol
  of activated T cells and is converted into pyruvate via glycolysis (). Pyruvate
  can either be further metabolized into lactate and secreted or entered into the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to generate ATP via the electron transport chain
  (ETC) in the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (). Moreover, the glucose
  breakdown intermediates produced during glycolysis can be metabolized via the pentose
  phosphate pathway donating important building blocks for nucleotide and amino acid
  synthesis (). Activated Teff cells rapidly augment fatty acid synthesis while concomitantly
  decreasing fatty acid oxidation (FAO). In comparison, regulatory T (Treg) cells
  actively take up exogenous fatty acids to sustain their proliferation through FAO
  (). In addition, Teff cells rely on glycolysis and glutaminolysis to proliferate
  and obtain the necessary cofactors for survival while Tregs differentiation is enhanced
  in glutamine-deprived environments (, ). Foxp3 plays a major role in regulating
  the metabolic pathways necessary for Treg cells function by upregulating OXPHOS
  activity (, ), blocking mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling (), and
  glycolysis (). In the inflamed tissue, in low oxygen conditions, Teff cells upregulate
  survival mechanisms including the oxygen-sensitive transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF)-1α. HIF-1α promotes anaerobic metabolism through increased expression
  of glucose transporters, as well as induction of glycolytic enzymes (, ). However,
  glucose supply is limited in the inflamed tissue while lactate is abundant; therefore,
  T cells favor the conversation of lactate to pyruvate. Tregs are able to sustain
  the use of lactate-derived pyruvate as a source of energy through the generation
  of NAD+ during OXPHOS ().
