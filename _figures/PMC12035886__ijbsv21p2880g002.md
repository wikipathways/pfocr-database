caption: 'Histone modifications drive neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.
  AR pathway: lncRNA H19 activates AR signaling by binding to the PRC2 complex and
  regulating H3K27me3 and H3K4me3; lncRNA-p21 binds to EZH2 while interfering with
  PRC2 formation, and enhances methylation of STAT3; ENZ enhances the H3K4me3 and
  H3K9me2 in the promoter region of AR'
