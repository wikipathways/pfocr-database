caption: SETD8 inhibition is of therapeutic interest in MM independently of p53 status
  and could overcome melphalan resistance. High SETD8 expression is associated with
  a poor outcome in MM and represent a therapeutic target independently of p53 status.
  In p53 WT patients SETD8 inhibition results in MM cell cytotoxicity mediated by
  p53 pathway activation. In p53 deficient MM cells, SETD8 inhibition increases replicative
  stress in association with MM cell death. Furthermore, SETD8 inhibition overcomes
  melphalan resistance in MM
