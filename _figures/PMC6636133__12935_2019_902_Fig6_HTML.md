caption: The molecular mechanism by which BMAL1 regulates the expression of MMP9.
  BMAL1 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of
  IκB in the cytoplasm. And then in the nucleus BMAL1 recruit CBP to promote the acetylation
  level of p65, further activating the transcriptional activity of p65, resulting
  in the up-regulating the expression of MMP9

  by up-regulating matrix metalloproteinase9 expression.
