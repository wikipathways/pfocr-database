caption: 'Epigenetic regulation throughout the S. mansoni cycle: The figure shows
  some epigenetic marks enriched in the different stages of S. mansoni and some miRNAs
  involved in parasite-host interaction. Larval stage mucins (SmPoMuc) interact with
  snail immunity proteins. The intermediate host has downregulation of several miRNA
  and piRNA biogenesis pathway proteins during miracidium penetration and also during
  the subsequent stages of development. The most enriched epigenetic marks in cercariae
  are characteristics of gene silencing. In schistosomes, miRNAs 277 and 4989 may
  be related to adult worm development. In adults there is an enrichment of epigenetic
  marks associated with eucromatization. There are miRNAs from the parasite that have
  already been found in human serum and have been proposed as possible diagnostic
  biomarkers.'
