caption: DmrtA subfamily members contribute to the patterning of the telencephalon.
  Regulatory networks of telencephalic patterning molecules related to the contribution
  of DmrtA subfamily members (DmrtAs). DmrtAs are involved in subdivision along the
  dorsoventral axis of the telencephalon. Dmrta1 is a direct target of the transcription
  factor Pax6, which exhibits a rostral-high/lateral-high gradient expression. Dmrta1
  represses Ascl1 expression in the ventral telencephalon, while Dmrt3 and Dmrta2
  directly repress the expression of Gsx2. Therefore, DmrtAs are essential for determining
  the dorsoventral identity of progenitor cells by repressing ventralization. DmrtAs
  play roles in mediolateral patterning of the dorsal telencephalon. The caudal-medial
  signaling center secretes Wnts that are required for the formation of the medial
  telencephalic structure. Wnts and DmrtAs mutually regulate each other. Dmrt3 and
  Dmrta2 mainly determine the proper patterning of the caudal-medial telencephalon.
  Dmrta1 supports medial telencephalic development. The rostral factor Foxg1 represses
  Dmrt3 and Dmrta1 expression, and this molecular pathway may be needed to acquire
  the caudal-medial fate specification. Furthermore, Dmrta2 modulates the expression
  of transcription factors such as Pax6, Emx2, and Lhx2, leading to the proper patterning
  of the neocortex. C, caudal region; D, dorsal region; L, lateral region; M, medial
