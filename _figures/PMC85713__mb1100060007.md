caption: Model of the secretory signaling pathway mediating transcriptional repression
  of ribosome and tRNA synthesis. Turgor pressure generated by ongoing protein synthesis
  and a reduction or blockage in the delivery of secretory vesicles to the plasma
  membrane is proposed to activate the pathway. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor
  Rom2 and the Rho1 GTPase are possible upstream components of the secretory signaling
  pathway (between Wsc and Pkc1) based on studies of actin depolarization (). The
  number of steps downstream of Pkc1 is unknown. Arrows indicate activation; bars
  indicate repression.
