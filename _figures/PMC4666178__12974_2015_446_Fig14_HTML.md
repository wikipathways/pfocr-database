caption: 'The possible intracellular route of TDZ in human astrocytes. Schematic overview
  of the possible TDZ/ERK/AKT/JNK signalling pathways in our experimental model is
  depicted. In astrocytes, the 5-HT1AR is coupled to Gαi/o proteins []; its activation
  by TDZ decreases ERK phosphorylation via Gαi/o protein ([a]) [, ], and increases
  AKT phosphorylation ([b]) [, ]. The PI3K/AKT pathway may contribute to deregulate
  JNK. Moreover, AKT phosphorylates GSK3, blocking in turn its activity, leading to
  alteration of astrocyte metabolism ([c]) [, ]. TDZ enhances CREB and BDNF transcription
  via a PI3K/AKT pathway ([d]). 5-HT2A/CRs may couple to Gαq proteins []; TDZ, showing
  an antagonistic activity on 5HT2A/CRs, may reduce ERK activation ([e]). TDZ antagonizes
  α-ARs ([f]), contributing to reduce JNK phosphorylation. Abbreviations: AC: adenylyl
