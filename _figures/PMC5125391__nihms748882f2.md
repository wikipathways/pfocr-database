caption: HDAC1 and HDAC2 reportedly activate p53 by deacetylating its K381 and K382
  residues, where it leads to an increase in the expression of genes involved in apoptosis,
  including, Bbc3 (PUMA), and Bim [–]. These BH3-only activator proteins then facilitate
  the activation of BAX, leading to caspase activity and the activation of an endonuclease
  that digests DNA. HDAC2 may have an additional function in silencing other p53-target
  genes, such as p21. In this mechanism, HDAC2 is associated with FOXO3a, which recruits
  it to the p21 promoter site, where it deacetylates histones in this region and represses
  transcription []. HDAC3 plays a primary role in histone deacetylation, and heterochromatin
  formation [, ]. In neurons, HDAC3 is activated by phosphorylation from GSK3β serine/threonine
  kinase, which becomes active when the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is attenuated by
  loss of trophic factor support [].
