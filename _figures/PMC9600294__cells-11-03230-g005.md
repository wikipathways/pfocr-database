caption: Regulatory mechanism of autophagy as determined by adiponectin and its different
  effects on cancer cell malignancy. Adiponectin deficiency reduces autophagy-related
  protein expression in primary tumor cells. A reduction in autophagy explains the
  increased cholesterol, LDL, and LDLR associated with accelerated tumor development
  in adiponectin deficiency conditions. This mechanism highlights autophagy as a possible
  pathway by which adiponectin deficiency might favor obesity-associated malignancies,
  especially breast cancer. On the other hand, supplying adiponectin has been proposed
  as a cancer therapy, particularly in obesity-associated cancer, since the addition
  of high levels of adiponectin to tumor cells induced autophagy and apoptosis. In
  this sense, it has been shown that adiponectin-induced autophagy negatively regulates
  apoptosis via the downregulation of Bax. Because autophagy inhibits adiponectin-induced
  apoptosis, it was suggested that the inhibition of autophagy would be an important
  therapeutic approach for enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment with adiponectin.
  Additionally, it has been demonstrated that adiponectin-induced autophagy contributes
  to adiponectin-induced cancer cell death. Adiponectin inhibits ERK phosphorylation,
  which negatively regulates STK11/LKB1-AMPK activation. STK11/LKB1 leads to AMPK
  activation, which in turn increases ULK phosphorylation and induces autophagy. Adiponectin-induced
  autophagy was associated with the cleavage of PARP1 driven by adiponectin.
