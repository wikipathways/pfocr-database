caption: Routes of the complement system with its inhibitors currently studied in
  kidney transplantation. Damps released upon I/R are able to activate all three pathways
  via binding to C1q (classical pathway), C3 (alternative pathway) or pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs) of the lectin path. All activating routes converge and lead to
  the formation of the complement component (C) 3 (C3) convertase (C4b2b, C3bBbP).
  C3 convertase cleaves and activates additional C3, creating C3a and C3b. C3b together
  with C4b2b forms the C5 convertase, which will cleave C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b together
  with C6–9 will then form the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC, C5b-9). The formed complement
  effectors will lead to opsonisation (C3b), chemotaxis of neutrophils and macrophages
  (C3a, C5a). The formed MAC inserted into the cellular membrane is associated with
  a proinflammatory response via noncanonical NF-ΚB signalling. C1-inhibitors (C1-INH),
  Cinryze® and Berinert® target complement initiation and APT070 complement amplification.
  Eculizumab and Tesidolumab inhibit complement activation at the level of C5.
