caption: 'The metabolic network of tomato cells. The system is a cell with symbolic
  subcellular compartments. Each colour indicates a pathway: green for the TCA cycle;
  blue for glycolysis; orange for the pentose phosphate pathway; pink for sucrose
  and starch synthesis; and yellow for the fluxes towards external metabolites, which
  are in presented in blue boxes. Imported metabolites are in red boxes. The compartmentation
  indicated in the figure is reminiscent of the physiological situation, and for the
  sake of clarity co–factors were omitted. Irreversible reactions are indicated by
  unidirectional arrows. The illustration was designed with omix (Droste et al., ).'
