caption: L. japonica regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway. The figure depicts the
  regulatory mechanisms of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which plays a pivotal role
  in inflammation and immune responses associated with IBD. Bioactive components from
  L. japonica, such as luteolin, cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), and quercetin, inhibit
  NF-κB activation. This inhibition leads to a reduction in inflammatory responses
  and alleviation of IBD symptoms
