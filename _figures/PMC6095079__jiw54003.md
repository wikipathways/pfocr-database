caption: Findings of network and pathway analysis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was
  performed with the list containing the 27 differentially expressed genes capable
  of segregating patients with moderate chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) from those
  with severe CCC on the basis of their respective fold changes and P values. The
  most significant network generated was related to cell death and survival, hematological
  disease, immunological disease (P = 10–39). Genes upregulated in moderate as compared
  to severe CCC are depicted in red, while downregulated genes are depicted in green.
