caption: Schematic overview of the proposed inhibitory signaling pathway of IL-32θ
  (A94V) on the production of COX-2, GM-CSF, and CYP1A1, mediated by targeting AhR
  and integrin for the treatment of skin inflammatory diseases. Upon binding to ligands
  such as PMs (PAHs), AhRs translocate to the nucleus and bind to ARNT. This complex
  then attaches to XREs on DNA, upregulating the expression of COX-2, GM-CSF, and
  CYP1A1. Additionally, PMs (PAHs) induce the expressions of COX-2 and GM-CSF by stimulating
  the ERK/p38/ NF-κB/AP-1 pathways in HaCaT cells. IL-32θ (A94V) inhibits the expression
  of COX-2, GM-CSF and CYP1A1 by targeting both the AhR/ARNT pathway and the ERK/p38/NF-κB/AP-1
  pathways mediated through integrin signaling
