caption: Within a peptide backbone, non-enzymatic deamidation of an asparagine-Xaa
  linkage or dehydration of an aspartic acid-Xaa linkage can give rise to a five-carbon
  succinimide (indicated by the dashed arrows). Succinimide hydrolysis (OH−) yields
  an isoaspartate residue (major product, indicated by the dashed arrow), or an aspartic
  acid (minor product, indicated by the right solid arrow). PIMT utilises SAM to carboxyl-methylate
  the isoaspartate forming a methyl ester that readily hydrolyses under physiological
  conditions to liberate methanol and reform the five-carbon succinimide (lower solid
  arrow). Subsequent succinimide hydrolysis will again yield isoaspartate or ‘repaired’
  aspartate products (right solid arrow). PIMT activity is influenced by the levels
  of SAM and SAH, which are likewise governed by the enzyme and metabolite levels
  of the methionine metabolic pathway.
