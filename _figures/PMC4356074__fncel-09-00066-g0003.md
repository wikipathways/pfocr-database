caption: Canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. The Wnt pathway can be
  classified broadly as canonical and non-canonical. Both pathways are activated by
  a Wnt ligand to the Frizzled receptor. The active canonical pathway is mediated
  by β-catenin, which translocates into the nucleus and it acts as a co-activator
  of the TCF/LEF transcription factor, leading to the upregulation of Wnt target genes.
  The two major non-canonical pathways are Wnt/calcium and Planar Cell Polarity (PCP)
  pathways. In the Wnt/calcium pathway, Wnt binding to Frizzled activates Dvl, which
  stimulates calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, activating calcium-binding
  proteins including protein kinase C (PKC) and calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKII),
  and in turn, the transcription factor NFAT. The Wnt/calcium pathway has been shown
  to regulate cell movement and axis formation during embryogenesis. The Wnt/PCP pathway
  is mediated by the GTPases RhoA and Ras, which, via the activation of the RhoA-Rho-associated
  kinase (ROCK) axis or JNK, can exert effects on the cytoskeleton.
