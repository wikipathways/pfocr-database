caption: 'Epistasis network for WTCCC GWAS of bipolar disorder. Network inferred following
  ECML feature selection and regression-based genetic association interaction network
  (reGAIN) for the WTCCC GWAS of bipolar disorder, annotated by top enriched pathways.
  An edge threshold (0.575) was chosen as described in Materials and methods; interactions
  below this threshold are hidden. The 146 nodes are colored based on membership of
  the genes in the pathways with evidence of enrichment replication ( and ): red diamond
  (membership in both Wnt signaling pathway and cadherin signaling pathway), green
  square (Wnt signaling pathway only) and magenta triangle (Neuroactive ligand-receptor
  interaction pathway). The weight of an edge is proportional to the gene–gene interaction
  strength. The 183 edges are colored based on connection of a gene node to a gene
  in the given pathway using the scheme above (red squiggle, green dashed, magenta
  solid). The size of a node is proportional to its degree (number of edges). Note,
  ANK3 in the middle is the most connected.'
