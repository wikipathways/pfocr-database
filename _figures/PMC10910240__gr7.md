caption: The mechanism of aerobic exercise combined with canagliflozin therapy against
  ISO-induced CHFCanagliflozin combined with aerobic exercise therapy modulates protein
  kinase activity. The combination therapy inhibited the activation of AKT/ERK signaling
  pathway, thereby improving myocardial fibrosis. Canagliflozin combined with aerobic
  exercise improved cardiac energy metabolism in CHF rats mainly through the retinol
  metabolic pathway. The combination significantly upregulated CYP1A1 levels to promote
  the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid, and it also improved myocardial fibrosis
  by regulating ALDH1A2 and CYP26B1 to maintain retinoic acid homeostasis. Meanwhile,
  the combination treatment reduced heart failure by downregulating CYP4A3 and CYP4A8
  levels to reduce the production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
