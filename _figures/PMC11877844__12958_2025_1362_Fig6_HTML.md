caption: Model of possible signaling pathways that are partially stimulated by hCG
  and induce the synthesis of proteins with cell fusion-activating properties. Involved
  proteins identified in the proteomic analysis of BeWo cell lysates are shown in
  bold, with those classified as calcium-dependent in red and those classified as
  calcium-independent in blue. Activation of Gs protein-coupled protein receptors
  (e.g. LH/hCG) induces PI3K-AKT-mTor signaling pathway via the Gs-beta-subunit [58],
  which in turn activates cell fusion [87] and receptor activation also induces adenylyl
  cyclase via the alpha subunit of the Gs protein. In this context, cAMP -PKA signaling
  can upregulate transcription factors SP1 [27] and CREB-1 [28] as well as the kinase
  ERK1/2 [28]. PKA can stimulate WNT ligands [88] and the p38 kinase [48] as well.
  SP1 can induce synthesis of HSD11B2, and CREB-1 can activate the synthesis of GCM1
  transcripts [89], steroid genesis [28] and the synthesis of syncytin-1 [90]. The
  synthesis of GCM1 can also be induced by the WNT-β-catenin signaling pathway [71],
  which can also activate the synthesis of SDC1 [1]. P38-induced OASIS synthesis [48,
  71] can also increase GCM1 synthesis. In turn, GCM1 induces PGF synthesis [72] and
  that of syncytin-2 (ERVFRD1), whose synthesis and that of its receptor MFSD2A can
  also be activated by p38 [48]. Transcript synthesis of syncytin-1 is also induced
  by ERK1/2 [1] and by GCM1. ATF3 may also be part of the Wnt signaling pathway in
  trophoblasts via miR-27 a-3p [91, 92]. S100P-activated YAP1/TEAD4 signaling pathways
  can also be part of placental development [79], as can adiponectin-ADIPOR-1-activated
  signaling pathways, and calcium itself can also act via the activation of PKC and
  thus induce trophoblastic cell fusion [71]
