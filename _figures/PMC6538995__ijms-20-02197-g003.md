caption: The effects of abnormal DA release and stimulation of DA receptors on proteasome
  and autophagy. An abnormal amount of intracellular DA may foster the loss of compartmentalized
  physiological oxidative deamination of DA, which readily undergoes auto-oxidation
  to produce toxic quinones and highly reactive chemical species such as reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). In turn, these react with sulfhydryl groups and promote the
  structural modifications of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids within the DA axon
  terminals and surrounding compartments. Structural modifications of proteins translate
  into the formation of insoluble aggregates overwhelming both the SP and autophagy
  degradative potential. At the same, the abnormal release of DA produces an abnormal
  stimulation of post-synaptic DA receptors, which are coupled with intracellular
  cascades such as protein kinase A and C (PKA/PKC). The non-canonical activation
  of these cascades promotes the hyper-phosphorylation and activation of glutamate
  (GLUT) receptors and ion channels, which foster GLUT hyper-responsivity and Ca2+
  uptake converging in the increase of oxidative stress. Again, the intracellular
  cascades placed downstream of the DA receptors (mostly D1-like) converge on activating
  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, thus promoting SP and autophagy
  downregulation. Red arrows in bold indicate increased levels. Plain red arrows indicate
  the formation of DA-derived toxic quinones and oxidized/misfolded proteins up to
  insoluble aggregates, and the progression of the various metabolic cascades that
  arise from abnormal stimulation of DA receptors.
