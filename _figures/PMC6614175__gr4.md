caption: Antioxidant mechanism of the NRF2 pathway. Under basal conditions, the NRF2
  transcription factor is sequestered and polyubiquitinated by the KEAP1/CUL3 complex,
  ensuring its degradation. ROS are able to inhibit this association, leading to NRF2
  stabilization and accumulation. NRF is then translocated into the nucleus where
  it upregulates a series of genes involved in the antioxidant response. The NRF2-KEAP1/CUL3
  complex can also be destabilized by antioxidant molecules, metabolites (e.g. itaconate),
  and even by autophagic mediators, whereas NO production may induce the NRF2 pathway
  as an adaptive response.
