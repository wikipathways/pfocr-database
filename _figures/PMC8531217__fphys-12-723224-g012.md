caption: Model of coronavirus entry via the early pathway. Upper panel, virus binds
  to the cell surface ACE2 receptor. The membrane-bound TMPRSS2 enzyme triggers the
  early fusion pathway by proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein to induce the
  fusion-competent state of the protein. Membrane fusion proceeds and results in release
  of viral RNA into the cytoplasm. Membrane fusion is dependent on sufficient accessible
  cholesterol in the plasma membrane. Lower panel, 25-HC inhibits membrane-fusion
  and replication. This is achieved by reducing accessible cholesterol in the plasma
  membrane. Data from  indicate that this is achieved by activating the endoplasmic
  reticulum enzyme ACAT/SOAT which esterifies cholesterol. An alternative explanation
  is 25-HC binding to INSIG and reducing cholesterol biosynthesis and up-take.
