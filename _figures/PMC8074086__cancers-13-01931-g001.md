  signaling pathways frequently deregulated in MF/SS cases that can drive the pathogenesis
  and progression of the disease and its potential targeted inhibitors. TCR/PLCγ1–NFAT/AP-1:
  upon stimulation with the antigen (a), TCR activates PLCγ1, which catalyzes the
  formation of IP3 and DAG. IP3 promotes Ca2+ release, which activates calmodulin
  (CaM), which, in turn, activates calcineurin (CaN). CaN dephosphorylates and activates
  the transcription factor NFAT, which can associate with the transcription factor
  complex AP-1 to induce gene expression. DAG activates PKCs (including PKCθ), which,
  in turn, induces the activation of MAPKs (and the AP-1 complex) and NF-κB signaling
  pathways. CCR4/CCR7-MAPKs/NF-κB: CCL17/22 and CCL19/21 activate CCR4 and CCR7, respectively,
  which can trigger the activation of downstream effectors such as MAPK–ERK, mediating
  gene transcription via AP-1 and NF-κB, and RhoA, which regulates cytoskeletal dynamics.
  TNFR–NF-κB: NF-κB can also be activated downstream of membrane receptors such as
  TNFR. IL-R/JAK–STAT: JAK–STAT signaling pathway can be activated downstream of transmembrane
  receptors such as interleukin receptors. JAK kinases are constitutively associated
  with the intracellular tails of the receptor. Upon activation of the receptor, JAKs
  are tyrosine-phosphorylated, making them catalytically active and capable of recruiting
  members of the STAT family and phosphorylating them at tyrosine residues. Upon phosphorylation,
  STATs form dimers that translocate to the nucleus, where they act as transcription
  factors for inducing gene expression. All of these pathways converge in inducing
  the expression of genes involved in the pathophysiology of malignant T-cells, such
  as IL-2, IL-4, L-17, FOXP3, GATA3, and CCR4. Created with BioRender.com (accessed
