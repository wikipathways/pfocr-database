caption: Interstrand crosslink (ICL) recognition by FANCM and associated proteins
  leads to the recruitment of the Fanconi anaemia (FA) core complex and monoubiquitylation
  (Ub) of FANCD2–FANCI. Retention of FANCD2–FANCI in the chromatin is followed by
  the recruitment of nucleases and polymerases that are required for the repair process.
  FANCM also recruits the Bloom’s syndrome complex (BTR), and is involved in activating
  cell cycle checkpoints through the replication protein A (RPA)–ataxia telangiectasia
  and Rad3-related (ATR)–CHK1 signalling cascade. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 complexes initiate
  and regulate homologous recombination leading to the stabilization of the stalled
  replication fork. FAN1, Fanconi-associated nuclease 1; Pol ν, DNA polymerase ν;
  RMI, RecQ-mediated genome instability; TOPOIIIα, topoisomerase IIIα.
