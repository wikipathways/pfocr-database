caption: 'Overexpressed HOTAIR is involved in the pathogenesis of CNS disorders by
  sponging miRNAs, inducing apoptosis, promoting microglia activation and neuroinflammation,
  enhancing oxidative stress, and inhibiting Bdnf transcription. (i) Parkinson’s disease:
  HOTAIR acts as competing endogenous RNA by sponging miR-211-3p, miR-874-5p, miR-326,
  and miR-126-5p. HOTAIR also induces apoptosis by inhibiting SSTR1 or promoting LRRK2
  expression. (ii) Ischemic stroke: Overexpressed HOTAIR acts as competing endogenous
  RNA by sponging miR-148a-3p to upregulate STAT3; promoting microglia activation
  and the release of pro-inflammatory factors; and upregulating EZH2, also a pathway
  regulated by HOTAIR to activate microglia. HOTAIR promotes apoptosis by upregulating
  Bax, Caspase-3, and NOX2, as well as by downregulating Bcl-2 expression. (iii) Alzheimer’s
  disease: Overexpressed HOTAIR acts as competing endogenous RNA by sponging miR-15/107,
  miR-130a-3p, and miR-129-5p to promote apoptosis, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation.
  HOTAIR is also involved in the pathogenesis of AD by inhibiting Bdnf transcription.
  (iv) Multiple sclerosis: Overexpressed HOTAIR sponges miR-136-5p to promote microglia
  activation, release of TNF-α and IFN-γ, and upregulate c-Myc expression. (v) Traumatic
  brain injury: Overexpressed HOTAIR inhibits MYD88 ubiquitination to repress microglial
  activation. Red and green fonts represent high and low expression, respectively.'
