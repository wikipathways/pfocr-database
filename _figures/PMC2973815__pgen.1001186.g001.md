  pgi, a Major Metabolic Gene

caption: A. The gene pgi catalyzes the isomerization of glucose 6-phosphate to fructose
  6-phosphate in upper glycolysis. Removal of this gene forces glycolytic flux through
  the pentose phosphate pathway, creating a redox imbalance due to excess NADPH production.
  B. The genes udhA and pntAB catalyze the interconversion of NAD/NADH and NADP/NADPH.
  UdhA is a soluble protein whereas PntAB is membrane-bound.
