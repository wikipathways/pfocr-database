caption: Under normoxic condition, ATP production comes from fatty acids and glucose
  oxidation. Fatty acids is the privileged substrate (70%) used by the heart, its
  β-oxidation inhibiting glucose oxidation via the Randle cycle. Under ischemic condition,
  glycolysis becomes the sole ATP-providing pathway. AMPK plays the role of fuel gauge
  during this phase. Being activated by the resulting increase in AMP/ATP ratio, AMPK
  is able to promote Glut-4 translocation and PFK-1 stimulation via PFK-2 activation.
  By stimulating glycolysis, AMPK is expected to be protective for the heart during
  ischemia. During early reperfusion, the still existing activated AMPK phosphorylates
  and inactivates ACC, inducing fatty acid entry into mitochondria. This favors fatty
  acid oxidation to become again the principal source for ATP production (80–90%).
  The concomitant stimulation of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation should induce
  the uncoupling of glycolysis and glucose oxidation, and, so, the detrimental production
  of protons.
