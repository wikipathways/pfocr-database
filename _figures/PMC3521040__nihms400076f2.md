caption: Molecular mechanisms of activation, amplification, regulation, and evasion
  of the AP C3 convertase. (A) Convertase-mediated activation of C3 on unprotected
  surfaces. After the initial deposition of C3b by various routes, FB binds to the
  opsonin to form a pro-convertase that converts from a closed to an open form and
  allows binding of FD. Bound FD gains the ability to cleave FB and releases the Ba
  fragment, thereby creating the final AP C3 convertase (C3bBb). C3 appears to bind
  the convertase and gets cleaved by the Bb protease. Conformational changes expose
  the thioester and bring it close to the target surface to allow covalent deposition.
  The C3a/ANA domain is depicted as a pale blue polygon in the cartoon of C3. (B)
  Convertase regulation by RCA on self-surfaces. Decay acceleration activity (DAA)
  is mediated by binding of CD35, CD55 or FH to the convertase and competitive replacement
  of Bb. In the case of cofactor activity (CA), the regulators CD35, CD46 and FH form
  a binding platform for factor I (FI) and mediate the cleavage of C3b to iC3b (or
  C3dg). In the RCA cartoons, red and pink circles reflect regulatory and recognition
  domains, respectively. (C–E) Convertase-targeted evasion strategies by human pathogens.
  While most pathogens either attract RCA to their surface or express RCA mimics (C),
  Staphylococcus aureus secretes at least two direct inhibitors that either allosterically
  impair formation of the convertase (Efb; D) or trap it in a state where it is unable
  to cleave C3 or participate in any other downstream events (SCIN; E).
