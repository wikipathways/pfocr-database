caption: The proposed pathway of 20HE includes activation of a putative membrane bound
  GPCR. This leads to PLC activation producing IP3. IP3 activates IP3R in the SR releasing
  intracellular stores of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. 20HE may also elicit the opening
  of extracellular Ca2+ channels. The total Ca2+ flux leads to phosphorylation of
  Akt which leads to increase protein synthesis. Hypothetical signaling is described
  with dashed arrows.
