caption: 'GSK3β transcriptionally regulates pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.
  (1). All TLR and TNFR1-associated intracellular signaling promote transcriptional
  activation of NF-κB. (2a-c) Wnt3/5/Dvl2/Akt signaling also promotes activation of
  NF-κB. (3) The active state of phosphorylated GSK3β at Tyr216(GSK3β pTyr216) promotes
  the activation of NF-κB and at the same time it promotes the inhibition of AP1,
  CREB, STAT1/3, Nrf2, and β-catenin, leading to proinflammatory cytokines production.
  (4a, b) During viral infection, TLR3/TRIF/GSK3β signaling pathway positively regulates
  both pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN-β production through NF-κB and AP-1 activation
  and IRF3 activation, respectively. (5a, b) Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway enhances activation of GSK3β, thus influencing β-catenin degradation and
  NF-κB activation (6). Overexpression of GSK3β inhibits NF-κB transcriptional activity.
  (7) Upon the activation of TLR (2, 4, 5, or 9)/MyD88/PI3K/Akt signaling, GSK3β is
  inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser9 (pSer9), leading to an anti-inflammatory response.
  GSK3β is also phosphoinhibited by S6K, PKA/C, and Dvl3 proteins. (8) TNF induces
  an increase in the nuclear expression of GSK3β and GSK3β promotes anti-inflammatory
  responses by mediating expression of the signaling inhibitors that terminate TLR4-induced
  NF-κB signaling, and by suppressing chromatin remodeling. Lines in red denote a
  proinflammatory response, while lines in blue denote an anti-inflammatory response.
