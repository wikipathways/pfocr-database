caption: MALAT1 and lncRNA-p21 were supposed to promote cell proliferation, invasion
  and migration by activating Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway. CCAL enhanced cell proliferation
  by activated AP-2α-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. CASC11 and CCAT2 activated
  Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway by directly targeting hnRNP-K and TCF7L2, respectively.
  CTD903, Loc285195 and H19 promoted proliferation through sequestering miR-204-5p,
  miR-211 and miR-675, respectively. Besides, the binding of eIF4A3 to H19 decreased
  the recruiting of eIF4A3 to the cell-cycle gene mRNA, resulting in the promotion
  of cell proliferation.
