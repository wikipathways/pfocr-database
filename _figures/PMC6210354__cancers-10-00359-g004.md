caption: Calcium-ROS connection in controlling ER-mitochondria cross-talk. ER-resident
  NADPH oxidase (NOX) produce ROS, which induces calcium release and ER stress, leading
  to the unfolded protein response (UPR). This response can subsequently cause apoptosis.
  Calcium release also leads to mitochondrial ROS production and this second pathway
  can also lead to apoptosis through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
  (MOMP). The mechanism of IB-induced cell death has previously been shown to involve
  calcium release from the ER, MOMP, and caspase-induced cell death. In contrast,
  TG-induced cell death involves calcium release via inhibition of the sarco(endo)plasmic
  reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) as well as potent induction of ER-stress and UPR.
  It will be important to understand how IB and TG differ mechanistically in regard
  to their anti-leukemic properties.
