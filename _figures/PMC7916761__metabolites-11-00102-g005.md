caption: Summary of IPL-elicited morphological and metabolic changes in E. coli. IPL
  covers ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) light. IPL-treated E. coli cells
  underwent changes in size, shape, and structures, especially in the nucleoid. Metabolic
  changes occurred in the inner plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleoid of E. coli
  after the IPL treatments, affecting the metabolites in ETC, oxidative stress, Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas
  glycolytic pathway (EMP), pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), amino acid, and nucleotide
  metabolism. Among them, the degradation of quinone electron carriers, especially
  the depletion of MK-8, is the earliest and most dramatic metabolic event induced
  by the IPL.
