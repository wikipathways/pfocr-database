caption: CREB plays crucial roles in the innate immune system that involves Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) and their activation. As part of NF-κB signaling pathway that induces
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and
  tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), phosphorylated CREB directly inhibit NF-κB activation
  by interfering with the binding of CREB-binding protein (CBP) to the RelA/p50 complex.
  On the other hand, TLR signaling leads to the activation of MSK1/2, which induces
  phosphorylation of CREB and then production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.
  This CREB-induced IL-10 production can be negatively regulated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ).
  CREB, cAMP responsive element-binding protein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide.
