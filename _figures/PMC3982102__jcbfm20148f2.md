caption: 'The major overall metabolic changes in the ipsilateral and contralateral
  hemispheres of animals subjected to hypoxia-ischemia (HI) (n=9) compared with sham-operated
  animals (n=8) (ipsilateral versus ipsilateral and contralateral versus contralateral)
  based on results presented in  and . Results are presented as the percent change
  relative to sham. The measure of variance is the s.e.m. as the percent of control.
  The values are based on the sum of amounts of several labeled metabolites except
  from the values for glucose, which are only based on changes in amounts of [1,2-13C]glucose.
  Glycolysis: sum of [2,3-13C]lactate and [2,3-13C]alanine. PPP: sum of [4-13C]glutamate,
