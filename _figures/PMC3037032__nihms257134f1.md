caption: (A) The histone acetyltransferase, Gcn5, as part of the SAGA complex, is
  recruited to genes by a variety of transcriptional activators such as the sequence-specific
  binding protein Gal4. Acetylation of histone H3 through recruitment of Gcn5 by Gal4
  synergizes with nucleosome remodeling activities leading to the recruitment of RNA
  Pol II. (B) The histone deacetylase HDAC1 can be recruited to genes as part of the
  SMRT/NCOR complexes by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins such as Retinoic acid
  receptors (RXR/RAR). Deacetylation of histones facilitates reassembly of compact
  chromatin for transcriptional repression.
