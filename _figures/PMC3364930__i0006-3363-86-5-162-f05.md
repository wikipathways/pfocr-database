caption: 'Subcellular localization of components of the PIWI-piRNA pathway and the
  proposed mechanism of TE suppression by this pathway. MILI associates with TDRD1
  and other cofactors localized to pi-bodies, whereas MIWI2 binds TDRD9 and several
  other P body components localized to piP-bodies. Sense and antisense piRNAs produced
  from both granules can exchange through the presumptive ping-pong cycle to enhance
  piRNAs production. MIWI2 can enter the nucleus by recruiting other epigenetic modifiers
  such as DNMT3L, CBX5 (HP1a), and HMTs (histone methyltransferases). The resulting
  secondary antisense piRNAs can presumably function to suppress transposons via two
  mechanisms: 1) degradation of the retrotranscripts by recognizing complementary
  RNA in an RNA:RNA hybrid at the posttranscriptional level and 2) recruiting epigenetic
  repressors responsible for DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation via an
  unidentified mechanism.'
