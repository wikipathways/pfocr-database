caption: Structures of the PNQ polyketides analyzed in this study and a simplified
  representation of their biosynthetic origin, starting from the polyketide chain
  synthesized by a minimal polyketide synthase. The numbering of the atoms of the
  aglycone unit is shown for prealnumycin, and the positions C-6 and C-8 are marked
  for all tested compounds. R = CH3 on the kalafungin/medermycin and granaticin pathways,
  and R = CH2CH2CH3 on the alnumycin pathway.
