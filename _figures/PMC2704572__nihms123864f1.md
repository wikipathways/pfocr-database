caption: Complement effectors generated during activation contribute to various mechanisms
  that limit tumor growth. The complement system can be activated through several
  distinctive pathways. The classical pathway is initiated when C1q binds to its various
  targets. The lectin pathway begins with the binding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL)
  or ficolins to pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or apoptotic host
  cells. This binding activates MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs). Finally,
  the alternative pathway is initiated by low-grade cleavage of C3 in plasma and the
  generation of small amounts of C3b. The C3b cleavage product iC3b binds to tumor
  cells and through the interaction with complement receptor 3 (CD11b/CD18) on mononuclear
  phagocytes and natural killer (NK) cells enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
  (ADCC). C5a inhibits growth of tumors in a mammary sarcoma model in mice. The terminal
  complement complex (TCC) is thought to contribute to complement-dependent cytotoxicity
  (CDC), which is one of the mechanisms for eliminating tumor cells by therapeutic
  antibodies. C3a, which contributes to the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor
  cells, probably contributes to tumor immune surveillance. Unbroken lines connect
  complement proteins to functions which inhibit tumor growth, whereas broken lines
  connect complement proteins to functions that can currently only be hypothetically
  linked to inhibition of tumor growth.
