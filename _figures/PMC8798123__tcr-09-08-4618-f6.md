caption: 'Schematic diagrams illustrating the complex activities and interactions
  contributing to a chronic state of inflammation in benign prostatic hyperplasia
  (BPH), and interleukin-27 (IL-27)/IL-27 receptor, alpha subunit (IL-27RA) signaling
  in modulation of inflammatory responses in BPH-1 cells and chronic inflammation
  in BPH progression. (A) Exogenous factors, such as LPS, activate the TLR4 pathway
  in BPH epithelial cells and induce production of inflammatory cytokines, which stimulate
  prostatic stromal and immune cells, and develop complex activities and feedback
  interactions that contribute to a chronic state of inflammation in BPH. (B) Left:
  In epithelial cells of BPH with less or absent expression of IL-27RA, Lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS)-activated toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathways induce production
  of proinflammatory and proliferative cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, which
  lead to increased chronic inflammation and progression of BPH. Right: In epithelial
  cells of BPH with more or prominent expression of IL-27RA, activated IL-27/IL-27RA
  signaling suppresses production of IL-6 and IL-8 induced by the LPS/TLR4 pathway
  and attenuates chronic inflammation and progression of BPH.'
