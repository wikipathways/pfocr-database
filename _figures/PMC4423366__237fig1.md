caption: 'Biosynthesis, regeneration and utilization of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4),
  and functions of BH4-dependent enzymes in C. elegans. Enzymes catalyzing pathway
  reactions are indicated by Roman numerals (). (I) GTP cyclohydrolase I (E.C. 3.5.4.16);
  (II) 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (E.C. 4.2.3.12); (III) sepiapterin reductase
  (E.C. 1.1.1.153), (IV), pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (E.C. 4.2.1.96); (V)
  [quinoid] dihydropteridine reductase (E.C. 1.6.99.7); (VI) phenylalanine hydroxylase
  (E.C. 1.14.16.1); (VII) tyrosine hydroxylase (E.C. 1.14.16.2); (VIII) tryptophan
  hydroxylase (E.C. 1.14.16.4); and (IX) alkylglycerol monooxygenase (E.C. 1.14.16.5).
  Names of C. elegans genes encoding these enzymes are shown in boxes adjacent to
  Roman numerals; gray boxes indicate genes for which knockout mutants are described
  for the first time in this work. Although cat-4 mutant phenotypes have been described
  previously, we demonstrate here that the gene encodes GTPCH1. Top left: Pathway
  for de novo BH4 synthesis. The gene encoding the enzyme catalyzing the final step(s)
  in BH4 synthesis is unknown. Bottom left: Pathway for BH4 regeneration. Right: Four
  enzymes that use BH4. Mutants in cat-4 and ptps-1 genes (BH4-deficient) have all
  phenotypes listed in the box at bottom. Mutants in individual BH4-dependent enzyme
  genes have the indicated subset of BH4-deficiency phenotype (dashed line).'
