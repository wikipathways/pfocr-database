caption: Hedgehog pathway overview. In vertebrates, the response of cells to Hh ligands
  is coordinated at the primary cilium (PC), a finger-like projection on the cell
  surface. (a) In the absence of ligand, the Hh receptor Patched localizes to the
  PC, keeping membrane targeted Smoothened out and in an inactive state. In the absence
  of Smoothened activity, Protein Kinase A (PKA) localized at the base of the PC promotes
  the cleavage of the Gli transcription factor into a repressor form that enters the
  nucleus and represses target gene expression. (b) On binding to Hh, Patched is internalized
  and targeted to the lysosome. Released from its Patched-mediated inhibition, Smoothened
  moves into the primary cilium where its activity attenuates the PKA-dependent cleavage
  of the Gli transcription factors, allowing their full-length forms to enter the
  cilium. Here they are activated by Smoothened before moving to the nucleus to activate
  target gene transcription.
