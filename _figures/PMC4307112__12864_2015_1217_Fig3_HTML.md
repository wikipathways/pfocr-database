caption: 'Differentially expressed genes in cell proliferation and differentiation
  pathway between grass carp before and after food habit transition from transcriptome
  analysis. The most important pathways are cell proliferation and differentiation
  (A), MAPK signaling (B). The colors of ellipses or rectangles were shaded according
  to the different expression (red: the mRNA expression levels of fish in Group C
  were significantly higher than those in Group A (FDR ≤ 0.001, the absolute value
  of log2[Ratio] ≥ 1); green: the mRNA expression levels of fish in Group C were significantly
  lower than those in Group A (FDR ≤ 0.001, the absolute value of log2[Ratio] ≥ 1)).
  All of these genes were not differentially expressed between Groups A and B.'
