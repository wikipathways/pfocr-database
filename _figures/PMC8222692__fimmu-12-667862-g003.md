caption: Regulatory mechanisms of Treg cells recruitment, proliferation, and function
  in oral diseases. Macrophages and antigen-presenting cells upregulate the release
  of cytokine C-C motif ligand 22 (CCL22) in an inflammatory environment and recruit
  more Treg cells to local tissues in a CC-chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) dependent manner.
  Similarly, tumor cells are involved in the release of CCL22 in head and neck cancer.
  In addition, the binding of IL-2 and its receptor CD25 activated the JAK/STAT5 signaling
  pathway to induce FOXP3 expression. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) also has
  a positive effect on FOXP3 expression by activating mothers against decapentaplegic
  homologue 3 (SMAD3) transcription factors. Besides, IL-33 binds to the IL-1 receptor-like
  1 (ST2) and further promotes the expression of FOXP3 and proliferation of Treg cells.
  The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activated by inflammatory Toll-like receptor (TLR) or
  T cell receptor (TCR) signals may be involved in the FOXP3 expression inhibition
  and the regulation of Treg proliferation, while FOXP3 can negatively feedback on
  Akt activation. Post-translational modification of mature FOXP3 protein, such as
  acetylation, enhances both stability and activity of FOXP3. FOXP3 can endow Treg
  with typical characteristics, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen
  4 (CTLA-4) and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor family-related
  protein (GITR). APC, antigen-presenting cells; CNS, conserved non-coding sequence;
