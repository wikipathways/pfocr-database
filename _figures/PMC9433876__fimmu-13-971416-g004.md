caption: The role of Hippo-YAP pathway regulating inflammation response during atherosclerosis.
  Disturbed flow promotes YAP nuclear translocation and activates the JNK signaling
  without affecting the Hippo kinases, thereby accelerates monocyte-endothelial cell
  adhesion and pro-inflammatory cytokines production to increase the formation of
  atherosclerotic lesion. Several upstream regulators such as JCAD, BACH1, Integrin
  β3 and c-Abl affect endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis through interacting
  with YAP. Moreover, statins exert anti-atherosclerosis function partly through YAP.
  In bone marrow derived macrophage, YAP undergoes TRAF6-dependent ubiquitination
  and translocate into nucleus in response to IL-1β. Macrophage-specific overexpression
  of YAP promotes macrophage accumulation and pro-inflammatory cytokines production,
  thereby aggravates atherosclerosis. BACH1, BTB domain and CNC homolog 1; Gα13, guanine
  nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha 13; JCAD, junctional cadherin 5 associated;
  TRIOBP, TRIO and F-actin binding protein; TRAF6, TNF Receptor Associated Factor
  6.
