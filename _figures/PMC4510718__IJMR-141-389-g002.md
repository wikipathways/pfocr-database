caption: Survivin (SVN) pathways to apoptosis. Activation of cell death pathways can
  be initiated through different mechanisms, including through ligand binding (FasL,
  TNF) to a death receptor on the cell surface (extrinsic pathway) or via direct mitochondrial
  signaling (intrinsic pathway). The mitochondrial pathway is initiated by activation
  of the Bax/Bcl-2 pathway leading to the release of apoptotic factors such as cytochrome
  c (cyt c) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondrial intermembrane
  space into the cytoplasm. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria results
  in caspase-3 activation through formation of the cytochrome c/Apaf-1(apoptotic peptidase
  activating factor-1)/caspase-9 apoptosome complex. Caspase-3 cleaves a number of
  substrates including cytoskeletal proteins and DNA. Caspase-activated DNase (CAD)
  and inhibitor of CAD (ICAD) initiate cleavage and fragmentation of DNA. The inhibitors
  of apoptosis (IAPs) inhibit cell death by physically interacting with caspases.
  Survivin has been shown to inhibit apoptosis through caspase-dependent and independent
  pathways.
