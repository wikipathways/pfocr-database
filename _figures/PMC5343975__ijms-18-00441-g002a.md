caption: Alternative metabolic pathway of the glucosylceramide (GlcCer) accumulation
  due to the glucocerebrosidase (GCase) deficiency. The expression of GCase varies
  from one cell type to another and depends on the tissue. (A) In a mouse model of
  GCase deficiency (red cross), GlcCer is transformed via an alternative ceramidase
  pathway into glucosylsphingosine (red arrow), which is degraded by cytoplasmic GCase2
  (GBA2 gene), active at a neutral pH, to S1P, a very active metabolite []. (B) Protein
  maturation takes place in the Golgi apparatus; the transport and delivery of GCase
  to lysosomes require a particular molecule, LIMP-2, which allows GCase to reach
  the lysosome where the acidic pH breaks the molecular link []. (C) LIMP-2 is a lysosomal
  membrane protein (LMP) whose highly glycosylated intra-lysosomal part protects the
  lysosome’s membrane. LIMP-2 anomalies can induce a phenotype rather than GD3 [].
