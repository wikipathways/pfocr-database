caption: The cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway, a signaling cascade that is critical for memory
  formation, induces expression of the genes encoding NR4A nuclear receptors. Newly
  translated NR4A proteins translocate into the nucleus to drive transcription of
  NR4A target genes. MAPK signaling is capable of activating NR4A-mediated transcription
  or reducing this activity by nuclear export of these proteins, depending on the
  cellular context. Nuclear export is opposed by PKA signaling. Several NR4A target
  genes, including BDNF, c-REL, and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs),
  have been previously implicated in memory formation.
