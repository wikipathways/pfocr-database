caption: Figure-Schematic illustration depicting the role of Phosphodiesterases in
  Endocrine system and associated diseases. Adenylate cyclase (AC) activated by external
  stimuli such as hormones and insulin generate cAMP from ATP molecule. Activation
  of guanylate cyclase (GC) by ANP/BNP/CNP results in the synthesis of cGMP from GTP.
  The level of cAMP and cGMP second messengers in the cellular system is maintained
  by group of enzymes named phosphodiesterases (PDE). PDE enzymes are grouped based
  on their substrate specificity to cyclic nucleotides. PDE 4,7 and 8 exclusively
  hydrolyze cAMP, whereas PDE 5 ,6 and 9 are unique to cGMP degradation and PDE 1,2,3,10
  and 11 are dual substrate specific that can catalyze the conversion of both cAMP
  and cGMP to AMP and GMP respectively. cAMP acts through protein kinase A (PKA),
  while cGMP executes the function predominantly via downstream target protein kinase
  G (PKG). Inhibition of PDE5 enhances the level of cGMP and offers cardioprotection
  and improves vasodilation in pulmonary arterial hypertension. PDE5 maintains blood
  pressure and fluid balance in the body through regulation of renin angiotensin-aldosterone
  system (RAAS). Induction of PDE5 results in tumor progression and PDE5i promotes
  apoptosis and impedes cell proliferation and enhances anti-inflammation. Abundant
  expression of PDE8 was noted in Leydig cell tumors (LCTs) and was involved in spermiogenesis
  and Leydig cell transformation. Germ line mutations in PDE 8 and PDE11 causes disruption
  in cAMP-PKA signaling pathway causing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adrenal
  gland adenomas
