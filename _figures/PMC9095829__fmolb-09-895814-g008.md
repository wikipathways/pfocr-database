caption: Regulation of TRP Channels on breast cells at different temperatures. The
  activity of TRPV4 increased at 39 °C. Activation of TRPPV4 by GSK1016790A leads
  to Ca2+ influx, promotes Ca2+ release from the ER, and depletes Ca2+ stores, at
  which point the UPR is initiated to upregulate transcript levels of Xbp1s via the
  PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 signaling pathways. This increased the expression of Zo-1,
  occln and Cldn3 mRNA and enhanced the expression of β-casein and TJ protein-coding
  genes. The presence of a certain TRP channel up-regulates the apoptosis transcription
  factor CHOP and promotes apoptosis through the UPR pathway at 41 °C.
