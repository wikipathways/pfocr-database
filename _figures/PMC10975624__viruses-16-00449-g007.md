caption: This schematic illustrates how PLA buildup hinders the replication of ASFV
  by blocking glutamine and its associated metabolic pathways. During the initial
  phase of infection, ASFV stimulates an increase in glutamine and glucose metabolism
  in the host, leading to an enhanced flow of metabolic activity in the purine metabolism,
  pyrimidine metabolism, and amino acid biosynthesis pathways. During the period following
  infection that occurs after 24 h, the buildup of PLA metabolite hinders ASFV replication
  by diminishing the function of glutamine transporter and GLS1, the pivotal enzyme
  in the glutamine metabolic pathway. This, in turn, reduces the metabolic flow of
  associated purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and amino acid biosynthesis
  pathways, as well as the bioprecursor substances utilized for the production of
  ASFV progeny viruses
