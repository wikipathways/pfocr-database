caption: Figure 2. Metabolic pathway of TMA conversion deduced from genomic data from
  species of the 7th order of methanogens. The pathway of TMA conversion involves
  a trimethylamine:corrinoid methyltransferase (MttB) which contains a pyrrolysine,
  an unusual amino-acid. The synthesis of this amino-acid and its transfer on a tRNAPyl
  to form a pyrrolysyl-tRNAPyl, and its insertion during the translation of mttB are
  presented in the green part. The pathway of trimethylamine (TMA) conversion, involving
  the pyrrolysine containing MttB, is presented in the orange part. Steps in the pathway
  between named compounds are indicated by blue arrows. The purple arrow indicates
  the transcription and translation of mttB. The dotted arrows indicate steps that
  are not detailed for the clarity of the scheme. Recognized enzyme names (see KEGG
  map 00680) are provided, flanked by the corresponding protein accession numbers
  in the “Ca. M. alvus” (blue) and “Ca. M. intestinalis” (red) genomes. Only accession
  numbers of enzymes specifically involved in the depletion of TMA are presented,
  some being shared with dimethylamine (DMA) and monomethylamine (MMA) depletion (not
  shown here).
