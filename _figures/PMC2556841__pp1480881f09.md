caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathway involving auxin, the HO/CO
  system, and NO during the adventitious rooting process in cucumber. Basipetal transport
  of auxin induces a CO burst synthesized by HO in the basal region of hypocotyls,
  thus leading to adventitious root formation. This pathway might be mediated by the
  expression of DnaJ-1 and CDPK genes (question mark). Meanwhile, IAA triggers a local
  and transient generation of NO. This NO production might activate a CDPK-dependent
  transduction pathway, thus leading to adventitious rooting. Additionally, the possibility
  of cross talk between endogenous HO/CO and NO during adventitious rooting could
  not be ruled out. Dashed lines denote indirect or still undescribed pathways. T
  bars, Inhibition.
