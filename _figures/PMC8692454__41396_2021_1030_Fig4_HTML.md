caption: Reconstructed carbohydrate metabolic pathways of R. frigidialcoholis based
  on the KEGG gene annotations and their relative differential gene expression profiles
  of each triplicate culture. The genes with a significant (p < 0.05) differential
  expression of ≥ 1.5 log2FC are indicated with an arrow (pathway) and a star (heatmap)
  in blue (overexpressed at 0 °C), red (overexpression at 23 °C), or purple (different
  homolog overexpressed at both 0 and 23 °C). The numbers in the pathways correspond
  to the numbers in the heatmaps. For the heatmaps, blue indicates an overexpression
  of the gene at 0 °C, red indicates and overexpression of the gene at 23 °C, and
  white indicates genes that are not differentially expressed between the two temperatures.
  A list of the abbreviations is included in the Supplementary material (Supplementary
  Table ). .
