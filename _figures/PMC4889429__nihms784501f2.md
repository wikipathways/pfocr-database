caption: 'The role of miR-155 on virulent (green) and avirulent (yellow) Mycobacterium
  species infection in macrophage. Avirulent Mycobacterium species infection upregulates
  of miR-155 by triggering the TLR2/PI3K/PKCδ/MAPK signaling pathways then recruit
  of NF-κB and c-ETS to miR-155 promoter. miR-155 induces apoptosis of infected macrophage
  by targeting PKI-α 3′UTR thus increases PKA signaling and finally activates of apoptotic
  effectors, caspase-3, cytochrome c translocation. miR-155 also increases TNF production
  by increasing TNF mRNA stability. To meet this role, miR-155 directly targeting
  SHIP1 3′UTR, a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway, a pathway involves in
  TNF biosynthesis and enhances MK2 phosphorylation which is a key molecule for TNF
  mRNA stability. Conflict results come from virulent Mycobacterium infections. Infection
  in murine macrophage induces miR-155 expression then attenuates the SHIP1 and Bach1
  expressions therefore promote mycobacterium dormancy and survival in macrophages.
  Moreover, upregulation of miR-155 inhibits the expression IL-6 and cyclooxygenase-2.
  However, virulent Mycobacterium infection in human macrophage downregulates miR-155.
  Briefly, this condition decrease TNF production by decreasing TNF mRNA half time
  and decreases PI3K/Akt pathway. Abbreviation. 3′UTR: 3′ -untranslated region, Cox-2:
  cyclooxygenase-2, CREB: cyclic AMP response element binding protein, MAPK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, MK2: MAPK activated protein kinase 2, MSK1: mitogen and stress-activated
  protein kinase-1, NF-κB: nuclear factor κ beta, PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,
  PKCδ: protein kinase Cδ, PKI-α: protein kinase inhibitor alpha, SHIP1: SH2-containing
  inositol 5-phosphatase, TLR: Toll-like receptor. (For interpretation of the references
