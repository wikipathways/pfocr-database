caption: Suggested pathway. Advanced glycation end product (AGE) molecules such as
  Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine-bovine serum albumin (CML-BSA) activate STAT3 through their
  receptor advanced glycation endproducts receptor (RAGE). STAT3 is responsible for
  enhancing Survivin, Pim1, and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) expressions.
  Pim1 is responsible of NFAT activation and NFAT stimulates proliferation through
  a decrease in Kv channel, which causes cell membrane (Em) depolarization. This depolarization
  causes a calcium intake through opening voltage-gated calcium channel known as long-lasting
  voltage-gated Ca channel ICaL which stimulates proliferation. On the other end,
  NFAT inhibits apoptosis by mitochondria membrane hyperpolarization. Survivin helps
  maintain resistance to apoptosis. Enhanced proliferation and resistance to apoptosis
  are responsible of vascular remodeling disease phenotype.
