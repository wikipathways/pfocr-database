caption: Schematic representation of mechanisms underlying endosulfan-induced autophagy
  and apoptosis. Exposure to the environmental neurotoxicant endosulfan instantly
  induces autophagic processes as an early response, followed by apoptotic cell death
  after prolonged treatment via activation of caspases and the mitochondrion-dependent
  pathway. Caspase-2, as an initial caspase, is a key upstream factor mediating endosulfan-induced
  cell apoptosis. Caspase-2 activates the executioner caspase-3. We clearly demonstrate
  that autophagy is a protective process that retards endosulfan-mediated cell death.
  Interestingly, we also provide evidence to show that Beclin-1 can be cleaved by
  caspases during endosulfan-induced cell apoptosis, suggesting a potentially important
  role of Beclin-1 in dopaminergic neuronal cell death. The autophagic response assumes
  a protective role against endosulfan-mediated neurotoxicity and dopaminergic neuronal
  cell death. We also show that endosulfan-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent
  with caspase-2, as the initiator caspase, acting upstream of the mitochondria pathway,
  being of central importance. We also suggest a potentially essential role of Beclin-1
  cleavage in endosulfan-induced neuronal cell loss.
