caption: Several key factors/signaling pathways in CSCs that are targets of phytochemicals.
  Notch signaling pathway activation results in cleavage of Notch by γ-secretase into
  Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that translocates to nucleus, a process that is
  known to be inhibited by multiple phytochemicals. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
  such as PDGFR, IGFR, EGFR etc., activate PI3K–Akt–mTOR signaling pathway, and this
  pathway is also known to be regulated by phytochemicals at different steps. Binding
  of wnt ligand to its receptor Frizzled activates Dishevelled (DSH) leading to attenuation
  of GSK-3β-mediated repression of β-catenin. β-Catenin also translocates to nucleus
  resulting in induction of downstream signaling molecules, and this pathway is modulated
  by phytochemicals as well. Inhibition of these multiple signaling pathways represents
  a mechanism by which phytochemicals influence the phenotype of CSCs
