caption: PI3K in immune system. The PI3K signaling pathway is activated via specific
  receptors, including the BCR and CD19 expressed by B cells, TCR, CD28, or ICOS expressed
  on T cells, NK cell receptors but also cytokine and chemokine receptors and TLRs.
  This pathway regulates many cellular process involved in immune cells development,
  survival, proliferation, and functions. Akt, serine/threonine protein kinase, also
  known as protein kinase B; BCR, B cell antigen receptor; ICOS, inducible costimulator;
  IL, interleukin; NK cells, natural killer cells; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;
  TCR, T cell antigen receptor; TLR, toll-like receptor.
