caption: Designs for the co-utilization of methanol and carbon dioxide towards (A)
  3-hydroxybutyrate (B) 2-ketoisovalerate and (C) phloroglucinol. The biosynthetic
  network for acetyl-CoA (accoa) from methanol and carbon dioxide is shown in . Metabolic
  pathways explored in previous studies are highlighted in blue, while proposed ones
  are highlighted in green. Existing pathway for phloroglucinol production with lower
  energy efficiency is highlighted in red.
