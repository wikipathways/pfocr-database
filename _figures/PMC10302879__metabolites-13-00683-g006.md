caption: Synthetic pathway of coconut fatty acid. The pathway was constructed based
  on KEGG and the literature. The left color block to the right of each gene transcript
  level represents the log2 (fold change) between GD and HT. The right color block
  to the right of each gene transcript level represents the log2 (fold change) between
  YD and HT
