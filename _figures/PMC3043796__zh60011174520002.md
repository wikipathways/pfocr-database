caption: Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Enzymes involved in the synthesis
  of uridine-diphosphate-O-GlcNAcylation (UDP-O-GlcNAc) from glucose and glucosamine
  and the O-GlcNAc modification of proteins are shown. Depicted in the figure is the
  interplay between O-GlcNAc and O-phosphorylation.
