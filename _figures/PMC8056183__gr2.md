caption: Indirect effects of viruses on the autophagy pathway through deregulation
  of cellular miRNAsAutophagy involves the spatially and temporarily coordinated activation
  of multiple molecular components, including the ULK1 (UNC-51-like kinase 1), FIP200
  (FAK family kinase-interacting protein of 200 kDa), and ATG13–ATG101 complex, which
  is functionally coupled to the negative autophagy regulator, mTOR complex 1, and
  initiates autophagy. The lipid kinase vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34)-Beclin-1
  complex is usually inactivated by anti-apoptotic proteins from the BCL-2 family,
  but when it is activated it drives the nucleation of the isolation membrane. The
  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
  pathway is well known to be associated with autophagy, and AMPK can promote the
  initiation of autophagy. Activation of AMPK can result in the inhibition of mTOR,
  which is commonly activated in malignant cells. miR-106a is upregulated by the HPV-16
  E7 oncogene and stimulates cell proliferation and suppresses autophagy by targeting
  LKB1 via the AMPK-mTOR pathway in HPV-16-associated cervical cancer. Autophagy contributes
  to HBV replication, as confirmed by observations that autophagy inhibition strongly
  impaired replication of HBV in liver cells. The expression level of miR-155 was
  upregulated in HBV-infected cells, and miR-155 reinforced HBV replication by affecting
  the SOCS1/Akt/mTOR-autophagy axis. HBV also promoted autophagy through the miR-192-3p-XIAP
  axis, which is important for HBV replication in vitro and in vivo. Beclin-1 is a
  key autophagy-promoting gene in the early phase of autophagosome formation. It has
  been shown that EV71 infection induced autophagosome formation through the reduction
  of cellular miR-30a, which led to the inhibition of Beclin-1.
