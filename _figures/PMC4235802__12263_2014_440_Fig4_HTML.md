caption: Potential zinc-mediated pathways by which external stimuli (such as systemic
  glucose, cytokines and zinc) may act on cellular function. External stimuli such
  as systemic IL-6, glucose and extracellular zinc bind to respective receptors on
  the plasma membrane (1). This triggers intracellular signalling events (ERK 1/2,
  Akt and JAK/STAT pathways; 2), resulting in modulation of zinc transporters and
  MT gene expressions (3). Changes in intracellular zinc concentration can influence
  NF-κB activation (4) and subsequent expression of cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β
  (5). Eventual cytokine secretions may be related to the expression of zinc transporters
  implicated in the secretory pathway (6)
