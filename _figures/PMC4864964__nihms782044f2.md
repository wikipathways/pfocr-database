caption: Model for how tumor-intrinsic β-catenin signaling mediates exclusion of T
  cells from the tumor microenvironment. Activation of the β-catenin pathway in tumor
  cells results in induction of ATF3, which serves as a transcriptional repressor
  for CCL4 gene expression. Lack of CCL4 accounts for failed recruitment of CD103+
  and CD8α+ DCs into the tumor microenvironment, thereby preventing cross-priming
  of host CD8+ T cells.
