caption: The MSC-EV effect on bone regeneration. MSC-EV can regulate bone formation
  and regeneration. These include inflammation, angiogenesis, differentiation, and
  cell migration. Their cargos contain varying levels of biologically active molecules
  (e.g., growth factors, cytokines, miRNA, lncRNA). They activate or inhibit several
  signaling pathways involved in these processes. MSC cultures can be preconditioned
  with various molecules (TNFα, PTH 1-34, TUDCA, DMOG), nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NP, BGN),
  or culture conditions (osteoblast differentiation, hypoxia) to encourage high-regenerative
  EV secretion. Using biomaterials as vehicles and delivery systems, MSC-EV can treat
  bone defects. Scaffolds facilitate cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation,
  enabling bone regeneration. Hydrogels, porous scaffolds, and hybrids are promising
  biomaterials for bone damage treatment. Reproduced with permission from the ref.
