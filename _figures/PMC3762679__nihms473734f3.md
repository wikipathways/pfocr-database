caption: Scheme representing physiological and maladaptive regulation of amyloid b
  precursor protein (APP) signaling and processing. In physiological conditions, the
  formation of cis and trans homo- and heterodimers of APP is modulated by interactions
  with transmembrane proteins (e.g., integrins, APLP1), extracellular secreted proteins
  (e.g., sAPP), or matrix components (e.g., heparan sulfate proteoglycans). These
  events regulate metabolic processing of APP (preferentially through the nonamyloidogenic
  pathway) and trigger signaling cascades that functionally modulate synaptic and
  neuritic plasticity. Binding of amyloid β (Aβ) fibrils to APP abrogates the interaction
  of APP with physiological ligands and promotes aberrant APP multimerization. These
  events shift the metabolic processing of APP to the amyloidogenic pathway, spreading
  Aβ deposition, and trigger dysfunctional signaling cascades leading to synaptic
  and neuritic degeneration.
