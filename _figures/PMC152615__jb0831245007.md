caption: CpxRA two-component signal transduction pathway. Components of the Cpx pathway
  reside in each compartment of the bacterial cell. The Cpx pathway can sense inducing
  cues that enter the signaling pathway at three distinct points. The mechanism by
  which growth is sensed remains unclear. X represents the second, as yet unidentified,
  negative regulator of the Cpx pathway. Note that X could be the periplasmic domain
  of CpxA. OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane.
