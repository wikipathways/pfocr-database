caption: Pyruvate metabolic pathway. The PA pathway for the catabolism of lactate
  generates a single molecule of ATP for each molecule of lactate consumed. The PE
  pathway recycles NAD+ but does not directly produce ATP. The conversion of pyruvate
  to acetyl-CoA can be achieved through either pyruvate formate lyase or pyruvate
  dehydrogenase. The enzymes are boxed, and the shaded arrow represents the direction
  of the pathway.
