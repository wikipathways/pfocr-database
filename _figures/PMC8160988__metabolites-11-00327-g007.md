caption: Curated metabolic pathway of key metabolism changes in a SARS-CoV-2 ferret
  model during post- shedding. Note, red-colored metabolites are identified features
  that are upregulated during post-shedding relative to viral shedding events; blue-colored
  metabolites are identified features that are downregulated during post-shedding
  relative to viral shedding events. Key metabolic pathways of interest identified
  from the pathway enrichment and impact analysis are annotated green. The data for
  individual pathway metabolites is presented in the .
