caption: The role of DGAT2 in the synthesis pathway of triacylglycerol. Triacylglycerol
  is (1) synthesized de novo by sequential addition of fatty acyl moieties to a glycerol
  3-phosphate (the G3P pathway) or (2) formed through the re-esterification of partial
  glycerides that results from either the hidrolysis of pre-existing triacylglycerol
  or via the monoacylglycerol (MAG) pathway. De novo transformation of diacylglycerol
  to triacylglycerol is catalyzed by DGAT2 (1) but re-esterification of partial glycerides
  is done by either DGAT2 (2a) or DGAT1 (2b). However, while DGAT1 specifically incorporates
  pre-formed fatty acids, DGAT2, which is able to form protein complexes with MGAT2,
  FATP1 and SCD, can use both endogenous and pre-formed fatty acids as substrates.
  DGAT1 diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1, DGAT2 diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase
  2, ELOVL fatty acid elongase, FATP1 fatty acid transport protein 1, MGAT2 monoacylglycerol
  acyltransferase 2, SCD stearoyl-CoA desaturase.
