caption: Mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies. a. Example of a drug-sensitive
  tumor. Downstream signaling is decreased upon addition of a targeted inhibitor.
  b–e. Examples of mechanisms promoting drug-resistant tumors. b. On-target mutations
  block the ability of the drug to bind to and inhibit the target oncoprotein, allowing
  continued signaling to promote tumor survival. c. Upregulation of a distinct receptor
  tyrosine kinase sustains signaling through a critical signaling pathway despite
  continued inhibition of the primary oncoprotein with the targeted drug. d. Mutational
  activation of a protein involved in a critical downstream signaling pathway reactivates
  the pathway below the level of inhibitor blockade. e. Activation of pro-survival
  signaling networks can prevent inhibitor-mediated apoptosis
