caption: Model integrating calcium mobilization into the Fas signaling pathway. Fas
  receptor stimulation causes rapid formation of the DISC complex, minimally comprising
  Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and initiator caspases 8/10. Our results
  suggest a rapid activation of PLC-γ1, leading to IP3 generation and calcium release
  from IP3R channels (indicated in red). Calcium release from IP3R stores combined
  with increased mitochondrial permeability further amplify cytochrome c release.
  A temporally distinct chronic elevation of cytoplasmic calcium also occurs over
  the course of hours, mediated by cytochrome c binding to IP3R.
