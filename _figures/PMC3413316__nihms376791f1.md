caption: (a) Physiologic activation of protein C (PC) by the thrombin (IIa)-thrombomodulin
  (TM) complex occurs on the surface of endothelial cells. IIa bound to TM activates
  PC, especially when PC is bound to the endothelial receptor (EPCR). Since protein
  C and APC have a similar affinity for EPCR, after activation APC can either dissociate
  from EPCR to exert anticoagulant activity or remain bound to EPCR where it might
  express multiple direct cellular activities (b). Dissociation of APC from EPCR allows
  expression of APC’s anticoagulant activity on cell membrane surfaces, various microparticles,
  or lipoproteins (e.g., High Density Lipoprotein). As an anticoagulant, APC cleaves
  the activated cofactors Va (fVa) and VIIIa (fVIIIa) to yield inactivated cofactors,
  fVi and fVIIIi. This proteolytic inactivation is enhanced by protein cofactors (e.g.,
  protein S, factor V) and lipids cofactors (e.g., phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin,
  glucosylceramide, or HDL).(b) PAR1 mediates multiple cytoprotective effects of APC.
  In most, but not all, reported studies of APC’s beneficial effects of on endothelial
  cells, the cellular receptors EPCR and PAR1 are required. These cytoprotective effects
  include anti-apoptotic activities, anti-inflammatory activities, protection of endothelial
  barrier functions, and favorable alteration of gene expression profiles. This paradigm
  in which EPCR-bound APC activates PAR1 to initiate signaling is consistent with
  many in vitro and in vivo data. Localization of APC signaling in the caveolin-1
  rich microdomains (caveolae) may help differentiate mechanisms for cytoprotective
  APC signaling versus proinflammatory thrombin signaling. Additional mechanisms for
  APC effects on cells may involve other receptors. These effects include APC anti-inflammatory
  effects on leukocytes or cytoprotective effects on dendritic cells and neurons.
  Other receptors may include PAR3, various integrins (e.g., Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), β1
  integrins, β3 integrins), S1P1, or apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (LRP8). This scheme
