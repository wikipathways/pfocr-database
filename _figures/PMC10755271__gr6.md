caption: Compound-Target-Disease network for PF leaf extract on asthma treatment.
  The size of a node is proportional to its degree value. Bright yellow represents
  key targets, the size of a circle is related to its – Log(p) of targets. Having
  a more multilateral target indicates that there are more compounds and targets connected
  with it, thus suggesting the target has a more central role within the network.
