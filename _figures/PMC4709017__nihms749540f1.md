caption: Exercise stimulates the kinase activity of AMPK and the expression of Sestrins
  in muscle, leading to increased molecular interaction between Sestrins and AMPK.
  Subsequently, AMPK rapidly stimulates ULK1/Atg1 activation either by suppressing
  mTOR signaling which results in dis-inhibition of ULK1/Atg1, or by phosphorylating
  ULK1/Atg1 directly. AMPK-mediated activation of ULK1/Atg1 induces autophagy via
  yet unidentified mechanisms. As a result, muscle insulin sensitivity is increased.
