caption: Summary of genes and proteins identified in this study that affect RA signaling
  in the human lung. Retinoid chaperones include retinol binding proteins (RBP)-1,
  2, 4, and 7. Retinoid pathway enzymes include (1) Retinol dehydrogenase (RDH)-5,
  and 10, and Dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member (DHRS)-9 which catalyze the
  reaction from retinol to retinaldehyde, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of RA,
  (2) DHRS3, DHRS4, and RDH11 are reductases of retinaldehyde to retinol, (3) Aldehyde
  dehydrogenase (ALDH)-1A1, 1A2, 1A3, and 8A1 that convert retinaldehyde to RA, (4)
  Fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) which delivers RA to its alternative pathway
  receptor PPAR β/δ, and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2 (CRABP2) which delivers
  RA to the classical retinoic acid receptors (RAR)-α, -β, and -γ, and (5) Cytochrome
  P450 (CYP)-26B1 which catabolizes RA into its various metabolites. Select RAR targets
  include BTG2, CASP9, GJA1, and VEGFA, CCND1, and TP53 which are all downstream targets
  of RA signaling
