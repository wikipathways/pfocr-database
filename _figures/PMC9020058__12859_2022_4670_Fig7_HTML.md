caption: 'Global upregulated subgraph for TCGA-LIHC reconstructs transcriptional activation
  of WNT signaling. The Color of nodes indicates the average  fold change of tumor
  samples compared to controls as represented in the color bar. The color of rims
  around nodes indicates genes contained in the integrin pathway (blue), the WNT pathway
  (yellow) and diverse other pathways (no rim). The color of edges indicates following
  interactions: activation (red), inhibition (dark blue), compound (brown), binding/association
  (yellow), indirect effect (dashed grey), phosphorylation (pink), dephosphorylation
  (light green), expression (green) and ubiquitination (light purple). See also Additional
