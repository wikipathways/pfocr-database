caption: Crystalline Silica (CS) promotes lung tumor progression through LTB4-BLT1
  pathway. Exposure of CS leads to production of LTB4 predominantly from mast cells
  and macrophages. In lung epithelial cells exposure of CS leads to production of
  CXC chemokines. The sterile inflammation initiated by the mast cell produced LTB4
  is perpetuated by autocrine loop of neutrophil produced LTB4. CS-induced cell death/phagocytosis
  loop of macrophages also contributes to production of LTB4. Altogether, CS-induced
  LTB4, IL-1β and CXC chemokines result in increased inflammation and recruitment
  of tumor promoting N2 neutrophils leading to enhanced tumorigenesis.
