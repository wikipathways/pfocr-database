  In NPCs, hypoxia condition enhances the expression of HIF1α and further up-regulate
  CLDN7➁, which consequently stimulates the expression of P18 ➂ and other downstream
  effectors. HIF1α also down-regulates CLDN1 ➀ potentially through CLDN7. There could
  be a feedback regulation between CLDN1 and CLDN7: CLDN7 positively regulates CLDN1
  ➃, whilst CLDN1 negatively modulates the expression of CLDN7 as a negative feedback
  loop ➄. B-M. RT-PCR and western bloting analysis to reveal the interactions between
  HIF1α, CLDN1, CLDN7 and P18. (B) Quantification analysis showed that knock down
  HIF1α could down-regulate the mRNA expression of CLDN7 but promote CLDN1 up-regulation.
  Si-HIF1α can not directly affect the expression of P18. (C) Silencing CLDN1 enhanced
  the expression of CLDN7 and did not affect P18. In comparison, silencing CLDN7 down-regulated
  the expression of CLDN1 and P18. (D) Western blotting result showed that silencing
  HIF1α triggered down-regulation of HIF1α protein (D&L), up-regulation of claudin1
  (E&L), and down-regulation of claudin7 (H&L). Silencing CLDN1 triggered down-regulation
  of claudin1 (I&M), and at the same time an up-regulation of claudin7 (F&M). In contrast,
  silencing CLDN7 greatly reduced claudin7 protein expression (J&M), and triggered
  a much reduced claudin1 (G&M) as well as P18 expression (K&M). Si-NC is the negative
  control of silencing the relative genes in CNE2. *: P<0.05, all data were compared
  to the control.'
