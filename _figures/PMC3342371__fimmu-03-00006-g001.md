caption: Heterotypic adhesion-induced mast cell activation. Mast cells can be activated
  by physical contact with activated, but not resting, T cells and/or by microvesicles
  released from the latter. This contact involves adhesion molecules such as integrins,
  lymphotoxin β receptor, and other yet unspecified surface molecules. Contact with
  membranes, derived from activated T cells, stimulate ERK1/2 activation, causing
  the expression of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. On contact with T cell
  membranes, adenosine is formed and released. By binding to its specific A3 receptors,
  adenosine initiates a complex signaling cross-talk, whereby the A3R, by coupling
  to the G-protein Gi3, eventually contributes to ERK1/2 signaling. N-Ras but not
  K Ras may be involved in this pathway or be directly activated by a yet undisclosed
  pathway and results in sustained ERK activation that is associated with increased
  dwell time at the nucleus and with cytokine release. Adhesion to activated T cells
  also results in an early (preformed) TNF-α release that affects in an autocrine
  manner the expression and production of the granule-associated enzyme MMP-9.
