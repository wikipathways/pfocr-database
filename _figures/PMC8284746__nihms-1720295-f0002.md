caption: Sphingolipid metabolism in astrocytes activates a novel signaling pathway
  involving cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling
  protein (MAVS). Lactosylceramide (LacCer) produced by sphingolipid metabolism binds
  to and activates cPLA2, which then activates MAVS inducing nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB)-driven proinflammatory transcriptional programs. MAVS
  activation also triggers metabolic remodeling that reduces lactate production and
  limits the metabolic support of neurons by astrocytes, boosting neurodegeneration
  []. B4GALT6, beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6; CCL2, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand
  2; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; NO, nitric oxide; TNF,
