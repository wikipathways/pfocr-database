caption: A. Upon upstream activation, RAS becomes activated, resulting in signal transduction
  through RAF, MEK and ERK. The MAPK pathway can turn itself off via negative feedback
  loops at multiple nodes to prevent hyperactivity. Inhibitory function shown as red
  arrows; activating functions are shown as black arrows. B. Characterized oncogenic
  mutations in the MAPK pathway are shown in yellow. C. A simplified schema of adaptive
  MAPK signaling following pathway inhibition.
