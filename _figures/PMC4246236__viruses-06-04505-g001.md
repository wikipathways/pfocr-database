caption: Cholesterol metabolism, lipid rafts and cellular prion propagation. (I) Cellular
  cholesterol, an essential component of lipid rafts, is synthesized from cholesterol
  precursors, with HMGCR as the rate limiting enzyme in the ER membrane; (II) Synthesized
  Cholesterol is secreted in an ABCA1 dependent process to form lipoprotein particles,
  or it is incorporated into membranes of the secretory pathway, where lipid rafts
  are assembled in the trans-Golgi network; (III) Uptake of extracellular cholesterol
  is mediated by ApoE/HDL interaction with the LDL-receptor. Cholesterol dissociates
  from the lipoprotein, is de-esterified and exported from late endosomes in a NPC
  protein dependent manner. It is then either transported to the plasma membrane or
  adds to the regulatory pool which prevents cleavage and nuclear translocation of
  SREBP. Once the capacity of cells to absorb cholesterol is exceeded, cholesterol
  is, in a small part, esterified by ACAT and accumulated as cytosolic lipid droplets
  (IV); The major pool of excess cholesterol is hydroxylated by CYP46 and converted
  to 24S-hydroxycholesterol, crosses the BBB and diffuses into the blood circulation
  (V). The red dotted lines represent examples for interference in cholesterol metabolism
  that resulted in a reduction or clearance of cellular PrPSc accumulation.
