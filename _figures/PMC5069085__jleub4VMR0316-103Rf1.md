caption: Selected roles for cholesterol, oxysterols, and oxPLs in the macrophage innate
  immune response are depicted. IFN-β induced by virus or LPS feeds back through autocrine/paracrine
  signaling, upregulating Ch25h and also inhibiting the cholesterol (CHOL) synthesis
  pathway. 25HC, the product of Ch25h, exerts several effects, inhibiting viral fusion
  and proliferation, inhibiting inflammasome-dependent IL-1β production, but also
  augmenting induction of select proinflammatory genes, such as IL-6. IFN-β-dependent
  inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis augments antiviral defense by enhancing stimulator
  of Ifn genes–dependent IFN-β induction and also possibly by depleting lipid rafts,
  through which several viruses bud from host cells. OxPL induced in the inflamed
  lung and not cleared by scavenger receptors such as macrophage receptor with collagenous
  structure may induce TLR4-dependent proinflammatory cytokines via the adaptor protein
  TIR-domain–containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (Trif), aggravating lung injury. Ifnar,
  Ifnα/β receptor.
