caption: mTORC1 in apoptosis and pyroptosis. (A) mTORC1 in apoptosis regulation. Intracellular
  metabolic and bioenergetic homeostasis is maintained through coordinated actions
  of multiple metabolic processes, including nutrient uptake, glycolysis, pentose
  phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, and mitochondrial respiration. mTORC1 participates
  in the regulation of a variety of these metabolic pathways. Disruption of metabolic
  homeostasis can promote the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, where activation
  of BAX and BAK facilitates the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the
  cytosol. Cytochrome c then forms apoptosome with Apaf-1, which in turn activates
  downstream caspases to promote apoptosis. RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase. PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase. Apaf-1, apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1. BAX, BCL2 associated
  X, apoptosis regulator. BAK, also known as BAK1, BCL2 antagonist/killer 1. (B) mTORC1
  in pyroptosis regulation. Inflammasome assembly stimulated by a variety of pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) recruits caspase 1, which in turn proteolytically activates
  IL-1β and IL-18. Activated caspase 1 also leads to GSDMD cleavage required for pyroptosis.
  Components of the Ragulator-Rag-mTORC1 pathway are required for GSDMD oligomerization
  and plasma membrane pore formation during pyroptosis, in a manner dependent on the
  production of mitochondrial ROS. Independent of mTORC1, Ragulator-Rag also promotes
  caspase 8-dependent GSDMD cleavage to facilitate pyroptosis in the presence of the
  pathogenic bacteria Yersinia. ROS, reactive oxygen species. GSDMD, gasdermin D.
  NT-GSDMD, N-terminus of gasdermin D. ASC, also known as PYCARD, PYD and CARD domain
  containing.
