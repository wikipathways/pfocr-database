caption: (A) The chaperone VMA21 (red circle) binds to the c′ subunit of the vacuolar-ATPase
  (V-ATPase; dark green) in the endoplasmic reticulum and initiates assembly of the
  proton-translocator domain (V0; pale green) (). VMA21 chaperones V0 in COPII vesicles
  to the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC). VMA21 is not present
  in the Golgi apparatus, but it is here that V-ATPase assembly is completed by addition
  of the ATP-hydrolytic domain (V1; turquoise). Proton pumping by the V-ATPase is
  critical for regulating the pH of lysosomes. Fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes
  generates autolysosomes that degrade target proteins and organelles.(B) In the disease
  X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA), deficiency of VMA21 leads to
  failure of V0 assembly, reduced levels of V-ATPase, and a decrease in lysosomal
  pH that impairs lysosomal and autophagic digestion of cellular proteins and organelles.
  Decreased protein degradation in XMEA may lower intracellular levels of amino acids
  that modulate the mTOR signaling pathway, which, in turn, upregulates macroautophagy.
  This leads to excessive accumulation of autophagosomes, autolysosomes, and autophagic
  vacuoles and a muscle-specific disease phenotype.
