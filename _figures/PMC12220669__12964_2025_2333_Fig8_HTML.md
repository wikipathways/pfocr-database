caption: 'The Tip60-H2Av module regulates Notch signaling pathway in a two-tier fashion.
  The Tip60-H2Av module plays a dual role in the Notch pathway: (i) In the Notch signal
  receiving cells, the Tip60 complex acetylates H2Av (H2Avac) and facilitates its
  integration into nucleosomes within the enhancer region of Notch target genes. H2Avac
  promotes an open chromatin state on the enhancer region of Notch targets, leading
  to increased transcription of target genes such as Cut, Wg, and E (spl)-complex.
  (ii) The Tip60-H2Av module promotes the expression of transcription factor Su(H),
  thereby further enhancing Notch signaling pathway activity'
