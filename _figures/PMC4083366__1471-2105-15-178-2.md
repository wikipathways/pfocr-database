caption: General network scheme of the virtual planaria. (a) Depiction of a regulatory
  model based upon a competitive development pathway initiated by a regeneration signal
  and repressed by active long-range morphogen gradients. (b) Representation of the
  principal components of the network as described in the Cellsim architecture. (a)
  Overview of general network scheme. (b) Regulatory network defined in Cellsim modeling
  platform.
