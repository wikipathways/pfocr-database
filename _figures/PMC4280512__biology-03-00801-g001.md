caption: (a) Biosynthetic pathway of TAG and glycerophospholipids. GPAT (i) and AGPAT
  (ii) are involved in the common biosynthetic pathway of TAG and glycerophospholipids.
  After the de novo synthesis of phospholipids, individual phospholipids are subjected
  to fatty acid remodeling. Acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase (iii) reactions
  are involved in the fatty acid remodeling pathways of glycerophospholipids. The
  reactions of GPAT/AGPAT and acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase are shown
  in (b) and (c).
