caption: Once ingested by the host, both the choline component of phosphatidylcholine
  (lecithin) and l-carnitine can be metabolized by gut microbiota to generate trimethylamine
  (TMA). The resulting bacterial metabolite TMA can then be converted to trimethylamine-N-oxide
  (TMAO) by the flavin monooxygenase family of enzymes (FMOs) in the host's liver.
  Elevated circulating TMAO levels are associated with increased risk of incident
  major adverse cardiovascular events including heart attack, stroke, and death in
  humans. Studies in mice have demonstrated that TMAO promotes atherosclerosis by
  dually increasing foam cell formation in the artery wall and decreasing reverse
  cholesterol transport. Collectively, this sequential nutrient metabolism pathway
  represents a new pathway for cardiovascular disease drug discovery efforts.
