caption: The involvement of oxidative stress in the greying process. In young and
  healthy subjects, melanocytes in pigmented hair follicles can deal with the low
  endogenous oxidative stress caused by the melanin biosynthetic pathway. This is
  due to the adequate presence of endogenous antioxidant levels and the high DNA repair
  activity. In old subjects, however, reduced production of endogenous antioxidants
  and repair enzymes induce deleterious oxidative stress damage in pigment-producing
  cells. This results in the accumulation of senescent inactive melanocytes around
  the dermal papilla and at the outer root sheath, no melanocyte stem cells at the
  bulge area, and consequent a non-pigmented hair shaft.
