caption: Simplified model of signaling pathway governing acquired thermotolerance
  in plants. Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs), including heat shock transcription
  factor A2 (HSFA2), modulated by a network of ROS, Ca2+, and NO signaling, might
  function as master regulators of this pathway. HSFA2 might be also regulated by
  small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation via the function of SUMO E3 ligase (SIZ1).
  Basic leucine zipper protein 28 (bZIP28) might act as a downstream signal of HSFA2
  activated by ROS signaling. Rectangles indicate proteins; the gray diamond indicates
  microRNA (miRNA); ellipses indicate other signaling molecules, e.g., Ca2+ ions,
  ABA, ROS, and NO; black arrows indicate positive regulation; T-shaped lines indicate
  negative regulation; blue dotted arrows indicate activation of gene expression;
  yellow circle indicates the nucleus; orange ovals indicate the endoplasmic reticulum.
  Heat stimuli and key signaling molecules (Ca2+, ROS and NO) are indicated in red
  characters. Names of cellular components are indicated in underlined characters.
  The pathways that can be hypothesized but not clearly evidenced in previous studies
  are marked with “?”.
