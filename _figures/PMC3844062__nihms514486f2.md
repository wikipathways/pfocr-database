caption: Proposed pathway for NLRP3 inflammasome activation during viral respiratory
  tract infection. Respiratory tract viruses can trigger both signal 1 and signal
  2 for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Sensing of viral pathogen–associated pattern
  molecules induces the transcription of pro–IL-1β/pro–IL-18 and NLRP3 along with
  additional proinflammatory cytokines. The purinergic receptors, such as P2×7 receptor,
  an ATP-gated ion channel that causes potassium (K+) efflux when activated, are partially
  required for M2-induced inflammasome activation. In the case of influenza virus
  infection, virus-encoded M2 ion channel protein transports protons (H+) out of the
  lumen and triggers M2-mediated inflammasome activation. Phagolysosomal maturation
  and the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cathepsin B also play a role
  in virus-induced inflammasome activation, although the underlying mechanisms remain
  to be explored. The activation of the inflammasome in DCs and macrophages leads
  to the activation of caspase-1, which mediates the processing of pro–IL-1β/pro–IL-18
  to mature IL-1β/IL-18 and its subsequent release into the extracellular space. RAGE,
  Receptor for advanced glycation end-products.
