caption: Role of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway in long-term facilitation in Aplysia.
  When sensory neurons are stimulated with the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT),
  which induces long-term facilitation, R subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) are ubiquitinated
  and degraded by the proteasome, making the kinase persistently active. The catalytic
  subunit of PKA (blue circle) translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates cAMP
  response element binding protein 1a (CREB1a), the activator form of CREB. Concomitantly,
  the repressor form of CREB, CREB1b, is degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway.
  Protein kinase C (PKC), which is also activated by 5-HT-mediated signaling, stimulates
  ubiquitin conjugation to CREB1b and subsequent degradation. AC, adenylyl cyclase;
  PLC, phospholipase C.
