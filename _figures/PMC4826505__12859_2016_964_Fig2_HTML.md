caption: 'CyTRANSFINDER software architecture. CyTRANSFINDER processes three inputs:
  (1) the source list of genes (SRL), (2) the destination list of genes (DGL), and
  (3) the STP pattern (STPP) to be reconstructed. Its fusion engine connects to several
  on-line repositories to collect regulatory information used to infer STPs connecting
  source and destination genes according to the selected STP pattern. The identified
  STPs are then purged to remove duplicated nodes and arcs and the result is returned
  to the user as a Cytoscape network or exported in the form of a tab separated text
  file'
