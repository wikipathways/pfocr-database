caption: Schematic of signaling pathways driving PASMC proliferation via hypoxia-induced
  glycolysis. High levels of lactate promote HIF production by increasing PFKFB3 expression,
  leading to PAECs dysfunction. After injury, PAECs secrete growth factors and proinflammatory
  cytokines through the paracrine pathway to promote PASMC proliferation. At the same
  time, PFKFB3 promoted PASMCs proliferation by activating calpain-2 and phosphorylating
  ERK1/2. In addition, hypoxia promotes HIF release, promotes glycolysis, and inhibits
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle, thereby increasing lactate levels, and the increase
  in lactate can also enhance HIF expression. Hypoxia may also promote the onset and
  development of PAH by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway.
