caption: Inhibition of the l-mevalonate pathway for immunomodulation. Statins interfere
  with 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting
  enzyme of the l-mevalonate pathway which causes reduction of farnesylated and geranylgeranylated
  downstream proteins. Besides others, the GTPases Ras, Rho-B and Rap-1 that play
  a role in the process of activation and proliferation of T cells are not prenylated,
  which affects their binding to the T-cell membrane. This shift in active GTPase
  signalling is connected to a blockade of T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine production.
