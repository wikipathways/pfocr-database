caption: Model describing crosstalk between the HSF/HSP and ROS pathways in the heat
  stress response. In addition to directly activating HSFs, high temperature leads
  to the accumulation of ROS. This, in turn, leads to a further activation of HSFs,
  either directly or indirectly via activation of a MAPK pathway. The HSFs bind to
  HSE in the promoter region of HSF, HSP, miRNA398, and ROS scavenging genes. The
  miRNA398-dependent down-regulation of a subset of SOD scavengers might play a role
  in the rapid ROS accumulation upon exposure to heat. This would support the activation
  of HSFs and thereby boost the induction of the heat-stress response in the short
  term. In the longer term, the induction and stabilization of other scavengers would
  start to suppress ROS levels to avoid excessive cellular damage.
