caption: 'Connecting the circadian clock and the time-compensated sun compass to the
  brain of Danaus plexippus. (a) Top left: molecular mechanism that underlies the
  circadian clock in the Monarch within neurons of the Pars lateralis (PL). The positive
  transcription factors CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) bind to E-boxes (CACGTG) on the
  promoters of the period (per), and probably timeless (tim) and cryptochrome 2 (cry2)
  genes and activate transcription. In the evening, the PER/CRY2/TIM (P/C2/T) proteins
  form a complex in the cytoplasm, with PER being phosphorylated during the night
  phase. Further phosphorylation leads to PER/CRY2 entering the nucleus late at night
  and CRY2 repressing CLK-CYC mediated transcription. At dawn, light activates the
  CRY1 blue light photoreceptor with resulting degradation of TIM in the cytoplasm.
  It is not known whether TIM enters the nucleus in these neurons as CRY1-mediated
  TIM degradation would also provide a derepression mechanism at dawn. However, CRY2
  also cycles and is at low levels during the day so it is conceivable that CRY1 also
  acts in the nucleus to send a degradation signal to CRY2 at dawn. Top right: light
  stimulates receptors to UV polarized light in the dorsal rim (DR) of the retina.
  A CRY1 expressing pathway (double headed, orange) connects the DR to the circadian
  clock in the PL (and perhaps vice-versa), which in turn uses a CRY2 pathway (blue
  arrow) to connect with the central body (CB), which may house the sun compass that
  mediates navigation. There may also be a direct pathway (pink arrow) between the
  DR and the compass. (b) Schematic representation of neurons and fibers expressing
  different circadian clock proteins in monarch butterfly brain. Regions expressing
  TIM, PER, CRY1 and/or CRY2 are highlighted in red. In these areas the four clock
  proteins partially colocalize. Areas expressing TIM or CRY1 are indicated in green.
  In these regions the two clock proteins do not colocalize. CRY1 positive fibers
  are represented by continuous orange lines. Projections of dorsal rim area photoreceptors
