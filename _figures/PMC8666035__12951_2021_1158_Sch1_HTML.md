caption: An injectable gel system co-loaded with MnP@Lip nanoparticles and OXA for
  MR imaging and enhanced immunochemotherapy. MnP@Lip nanoparticles exert the MR imaging
  capability and can activate STING pathway in macrophage and DC. OXA can induce immunogenic
  cancer cell death and synergistically elicit the immune system with MnP@Lip nanoparticles
  to prevent tumor recurrence
