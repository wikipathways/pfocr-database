caption: Molecular components and mechanisms involved in herbivore induced resistance
  (HIR). Herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMP), initiates the herbivore-induced
  resistance signaling pathway. Since insect-derived effector molecules can suppress
  host defense, plants may have evolved resistance (R) genes like PRR and NB-LRRs
  against herbivore effectors. Herbivory-derived elicitors result in rapid release
  of jasmonate (JA) which is released in the form of jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile),
  recognized by a co-receptor complex comprised of the F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE
  1 (COI1) and JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins. These binding results play important
  roles in proteasome-mediated degradation of the JAZ proteins. This binding leads
  to proteasome-mediated degradation of the JAZ proteins. In un-induced cells, it
  suppresses positive regulators of JA-mediated defense responses, such as the transcription
  factors MYCs (MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4). A local tissue injury results in membrane depolarization
  by ion fluxes, which mediates rapid biosynthesis of JA that further leads to the
  expression of many JA-responsive genes. In the case of systemic resistance, abscisic
  acid (ABA) acts as a regulator. Accumulation of ABA triggers herbivore-induced resistance
  by activating the expression of defense responses.
