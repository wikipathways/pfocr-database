caption: 'Relationship between methyl donors and mediators in the methylation of substrates.
  Methylation is a methyl-group transfer reaction from a methyl donor to a substrate,
  which is mediated by the methionine (Met) cycle. The deep red-arrow lines indicate
  the flow/transfer of methyl groups/one-carbon units from dietary sources to substrates.
  In this regard, methylation can be considered as a reaction between betaine and
  substrates (dashed line). An increase in the levels of substrates will increase
  the demand for betaine rather than for methylation mediators, e.g., folate and vitamin
  B12 (B12), because betaine is a non-renewable resource, while the mediators can
  be recycled if there is an adequate supply of methyl donors. Pathway 1: Betaine-dependent
  homocysteine (Hcy) remethylation; Pathway 2: Folate-dependent Hcy remethylation.
