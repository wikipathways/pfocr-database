caption: OTUD5 stabilizes βTrCP1 through its DUB activity. In turn, the stabilized
  βTrCP1 degrades phosphorylated DEPTOR, an inhibitory subunit of mTOR complexes.
  The active mTOR directly phosphorylates and activates OTUD5 and promotes OTUD5-βTrCP1-DEPTOR
  pathway. The positive feedback loop between OTUD5 and mTOR plays a role in regulating
  cell growth, cell proliferation, and autophagy.
papertitle: Deubiquitinase OTUD5 is a positive regulator of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling
  pathways.
