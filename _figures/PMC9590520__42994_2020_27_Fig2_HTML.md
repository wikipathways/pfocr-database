caption: Nitrate signaling in the integrative regulation of N metabolism and plant
  growth. In response to low N concentrations, NPF6.3 can switch to high-affinity
  status after the phosphorylation by CBL1/9–CIPK23 complex, which is inhibited by
  phosphatases ABI2. In response to high external N level, the dephosphorylated NPF6.3
  tend to form a dimer with low-affinity activity. The dual-affinity nitrate transporter
  NPF6.3 also act as a nitrate sensor to trigger calcium signals. The calcium-dependent
  protein kinase CPK10/30/32 can phosphorylate NLP7 and cause its nuclear retention,
  then consequently regulates N-responsive N assimilation and plant growth. In rice,
  the NPF6.3 ortholog OsNRT1.1B could recruit NBIP1 (an E3 ligase) and degrade SPX4
  via 26S proteasome, thereby releasing the rice ortholog OsNLP3 protein into the
  nucleus. TCP20 is a key component in regulating root foraging progress. The interaction
  between TCP20 and NLP6/7 plays key roles in the expression regulations of target
  genes. In addition, G protein is also required for nitrate sensing and responses.
  Some a receptor like kinase (RLK) interact with Gα subunit and then release the
  freely Gβγ dimer, which can modulate the downstream effectors (i.e., MADS family
  transcription factor). miR393-AFB regulatory module integrate auxin signaling pathway
  into nitrate responsive plant growth. Besides that, NLP7 transcription factor can
  directly induce the expressions of auxin biosynthetic gene TAR2 and auxin efflux
  gene PIN7, consequently leading to changes of cellular auxin levels. In the absent
  of nitrate, NPF6.3 facilitates auxin away from the lateral root primordium tip and
  inhibit the lateral root outgrowth
