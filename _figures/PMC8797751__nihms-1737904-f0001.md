caption: Key signaling pathways in asbestos-induced chronic inflammation and mesothelioma
  pathogenesis as well as related therapeutic approaches. Asbestos fibers cause necrotic
  mesothelial cell death and the consequent release of HMGB1 into the extracellular
  space. Extracellular HMGB1 initiates inflammatory response. It induces the accumulation
  of immune cells, as well as activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB pathway,
  which causes secretion of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β.
  These factors bind to their respective receptors on neighboring mesothelial cells
  and promote the survival and transformation of mesothelial cells. Moreover, HMGB1
  also induces autophagy in mesothelial cells following asbestos exposure that further
  promotes the cell survival and malignant transformation. The accumulation of survived
  mesothelial cells carrying DNA defects induced by asbestos and asbestos-generated
  ROS and RNS eventually leads to mesothelioma development. Many potential targets
  have been identified to interfere with the above carcinogenic process. For example,
  HMGB1 antagonist BoxA, anti-HMGB1 and anti-RAGE monoclonal antibodies can efficiently
  inhibit HMGB1 activities; Ethyl pyruvate reduces HMGB1 translocation and release
  by down-regulating the HMGB1-RAGE axis; IL-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra prevents
  the activity of IL-1β; and anti-inflammatory drug aspirin was also found to have
  anti-HMGB1 function. Created with Biorender.com.
