  neutrophils, macrophages, and platelets. Macrophages are among the primary cells
  that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which leads to the maturation and secretion
  of pro-IL-1β. IL-1β, as a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, further activates other
  immune cells, including neutrophils and endothelial cells. Macrophages can express
  TF, a critical initiator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, which activates the
  downstream coagulation cascade, thus promoting clot formation. Once activated, neutrophils
  release NETs, which can trap pathogens and aggregate clotting factors, enhancing
  thrombus formation. Neutrophils are also capable of expressing the NLRP3 inflammasome
  and can release IL-1 via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, thereby further amplifying
  the local inflammatory response. The adhesion molecules expressed by neutrophils,
  such as LFA-1 and Mac-1, bind to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells, facilitating
  neutrophil adhesion and migration to the site of inflammation. Activated platelets
  release a variety of granules containing pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant factors,
  such as P-selectin, fibrinogen, and vWF. Platelets can also expose TF on their surface,
  further promoting the coagulation cascade. Additionally, platelets provide a phospholipid
  surface that enhances the activity of clotting factors. Endothelial cells, under
  inflammatory stimuli, can express the NLRP3 inflammasome and secrete IL-1β, thereby
  contributing to the local inflammatory response. This process induces endothelial
  dysfunction and increases endothelial permeability. During inflammation, endothelial
  cells upregulate various adhesion molecules to promote leukocyte and platelet adhesion
  and migration. Moreover, endothelial cells can enhance the expression of pro-coagulant
  factors such as TF and vWF during the inflammatory process. PAMPs, pathogen-associated
