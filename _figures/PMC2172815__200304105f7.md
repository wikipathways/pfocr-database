caption: bFGF/αvβ3 and VEGF/αvβ5 signaling pathways. A summary of the signaling pathways
  outlined in this report as it relates to EC cell survival as recently described
  in . Evidence presented here reveals that bFGF/αvβ3 and VEGF/αvβ5 differentially
  activate Ras-Raf-ERK signaling. This, together with our recent work (), allows us
  to propose a model whereby each of these signaling pathways accounts for protection
  of EC from distinct mediators of apoptosis. The αvβ3 pathway promotes an ERK-independent
  survival mechanism preventing stress-mediated death based on Raf coupling to the
  mitochondria, whereas the αvβ5 pathway prevents receptor-mediated death in an ERK-dependent
  manner. In addition, ERK is likely playing a general role in both pathways of angiogenesis
  because it regulates gene transcription, cell cycle progression, and cell migration,
  which are critical to the growth and differentiation of new blood vessels.
