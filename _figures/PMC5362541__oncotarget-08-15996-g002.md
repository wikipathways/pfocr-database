caption: Under basal conditions, cytosolic repressor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1 (Keap1), a substrate adaptor protein for Cullin 3 (Cul3)/Rbx1 ubiquitin ligase,
  holds Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and promotes its ubiquitination followed by 26S proteasomal
  degradation [,]. In the presence of electrophilic and/or oxidative stimulus, Nrf2
  is released from Keap1 and translocates to the nucleus where it recruits small Maf
  protein (sMaf) and binds with response element (ARE) in the promoter regions of
  its target genes, inducing their expression. Activation of Nrf2 pathway allows for
  cell adaptation and survival by regulating expression of antioxidans, anti-inflammatory
  and phase II detoxification enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), gluthatione
  S-transferase (GST), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1),
  UDP-glucuronosyl transferases (UGT), γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γGCS) and efflux
  pumps like multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and breast cancer resistance
  protein (BCRP). Proteins transcriptionally controlled by Nrf2 take part in biosynthesis,
  utilization and regeneration of glutathione, thioredoxin, and NADPH resulting in
  restoration of cellular redox homeostasis.
