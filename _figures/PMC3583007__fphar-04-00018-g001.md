caption: Mechanisms of resistance to PARPi in cancer therapy. The principle explanation
  for the efficacy of PARPi as synthetic lethal therapy in DNA double strand break
  (DSB) repair defective cancer cells or as a combination therapy with other agents
  for other cancers rests on the role of PARP-1 in BER and SSBR. As shown in the series
  of A–E steps, the inefficient repair of DNA single strand breaks by PARP-1-mediated
  BER in the presence of PARPi would lead to DSB. An inefficient repair of DSB by
  HR-deficient cancer cells will kill these cells, whereas normal cells with proper
  DSB repair capacity will survive. The resistance to PARPi can occur in cancer cells
  by alteration of various parameters, which influence different steps in this pathway.
  The changes in these factors, i.e., upregulation or downregulation as pointed by
  the direction of red arrows, is associated with resistance to PARPi. The solid or
  dashed arrows indicate known or hypothesized mechanisms of resistance to PARPi,
  respectively. The numbers within square bracket next to the arrows refer to the
  explanation in the text for this mechanism of PARPi-resistance.
