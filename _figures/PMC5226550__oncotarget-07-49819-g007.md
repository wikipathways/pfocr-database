caption: Our results showed that the region of Cx43 that comprises amino acids 266-283
  (in red), located in one of the intrinsically disordered regions of Cx43CT, serves
  as a docking platform for the active form of c-Src (c-Src phosphorylated at tyrosine
  416, shown in yellow), Csk and PTEN. The proximity of these proteins facilitates
  the phosphorylation of c-Src at tyrosine 527 (green) catalyzed by Csk and the removal
  of phosphate at tyrosine 416 (yellow) catalyzed by PTEN with the subsequent inhibition
  of c-Src activity. c-Src inhibition prevents PTEN degradation creating a positive
  feed-forward loop to guarantee the long-term regulation of this process. As a consequence
  of increased PTEN, Akt activity decreases. This signaling pathway contributes to
  a reduction in the oncogenic activity of these proteins in glioma cells.
