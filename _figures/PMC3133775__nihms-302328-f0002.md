caption: (a) Netrin-1-induced attraction involves Ca2+ influx through transient receptor
  potential type C1 (TRPC1) and L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (L-VDCC) and
  Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through ryanodine
  receptors (RyR). Upon netrin-1 binding to the receptor deleted in colorectal cancer
  (DCC), the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase FK506-binding protein 52 (FKBP52) mediates
  the isomerization-elicited opening of TRPC1 (). The activated TRPC1 triggers membrane
  depolarization leading to further Ca2+ entry through L-VDCC (). This Ca2+ entry
  most likely triggers CICR that causes growth cone attraction. Gating of L-VDCC and
  RyR requires the activity of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway,.
  A sufficient cAMP level is maintained possibly by the action of soluble adenylate
  cyclase (sAC) (), although conflicting results have been reported. The cAMP effector
  Epac has also been implicated in netrin-1-induced attraction. (b) Netrin-1-induced
  repulsion is probably mediated by Ca2+ influx through TRPC1 only, because the cyclic
  GMP (cGMP)-protein kinase G (PKG) pathway inactivates L-VDCC () and RyR (). The
  DCC-uncoordinated 5 (UNC5) receptor complex, which mediates netrin-1-induced repulsion,
  has been postulated to stimulate the production of cGMP via the lipid mediator 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid (12-HPETE) (). (c) Nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced attraction involves the
  receptor tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) and its downstream effector, phospholipase
  C (PLC) () that catalyzes the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in
  the cytosol. NGF also increases cAMP levels via sAC (), facilitating IP3-induced
  Ca2+ release (IICR) upon IP3 binding to the IP3 receptor (IP3R) (). (d) Myelin-associated
  glycoprotein (MAG) binds the Nogo-66 receptor complex (NgR complex) and repels growth
  cones via low-amplitude Ca2+ release from the ER () and potentially Ca2+ influx
  through TRPC1 (). The TRPC1 may also participate in maintaining ER-stored Ca2+.
  MAG antagonizes neurotrophin-induced cAMP elevations in postnatal rat neurons under
  conditions in which MAG inhibits axon growth, suggesting that MAG has a bias toward
  inhibiting the cAMP pathway during repulsive guidance. (e) Brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF)-induced TrkB-mediated attraction requires IICR together with Ca2+
  influx through TRPC3/6, in which TRPC3/6 may participate in store-operated Ca2+
  entry for replenishment of the ER with Ca2+ (). BDNF also increases cAMP levels
  via inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) (). (f) Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) binds
  a complex of neuropilin 1 (Npn1) and plexinA1 (PlexA1) and repels growth cones by
  elevating cGMP levels via soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which in turn triggers
  Ca2+ influx through cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) (). Whether RyR is inactivated
  downstream of cGMP remains unclear.
