caption: AMPK-activating drugs that reduce cellular ATP levels, such as the antidiabetic
  metformin, promote tumor suppressive actions in a LKB1-dependent manner. Positive
  AMPK-dependent signals converge at the tumor suppressor complex TSC1/TSC2 to ultimately
  prevent the mitogenic and prosurvival activities driven by the mTOR C1 pathway.
  Inhibition of mTOR C1 signaling may also result from a direct negative phosphorylation
  of raptor, an associated regulatory protein within the mTOR C1 complex. In many
  human cancers, mTOR C1 activation is sustained via the PI3K/Akt pathway. This is
  triggered through an Akt-dependent negative phosphorylating event that leads to
  TSC2 inhibition. Statins have been shown to deactivate Akt, activate AM PK and potentiate
  mTOR C1 inhibition when used in combination with metformin. These effects lead to
  increased tumor cell apoptosis and reduced clonogenicity as shown by the Woodard
  study.
