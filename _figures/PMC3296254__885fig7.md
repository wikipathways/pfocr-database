caption: Lysine biosynthetic pathway. LYS gene expression is controlled in response
  to the levels of α-AAS. This pathway intermediate binds and activates the pathway-specific
  transcription factor Lys14. As a consequence of a pathway intermediate controlling
  Lys14, conditions that increase or decrease the flux through the pathway, positively
  or negatively, affect LYS gene expression, respectively. The pathway is stimulated
  by the precursor α-ketoglutarate and consistently activated in cells lacking MKS1.
  Conversely, due to feedback inhibition of the first step of the pathway (catalyzed
  by either Lys20 or Lys21), excess lysine reduces the production of α-AAS and causes
  apparent repression of the LYS genes. LYS14 is subject to GAAC regulation, which
  suggests that derepression of all eight LYS genes under amino acid starvation conditions
  is mediated through Gcn4-induced LYS14 expression ().
