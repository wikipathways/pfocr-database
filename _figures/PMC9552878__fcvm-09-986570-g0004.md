caption: Example of TRK induced by different ligand yields different response in VC
  – the dual roles of TRK in vascular calcification. FGFR1 activated by FGF21 suppresses
  the calcification, in part, through the inhibition of p38 MAPK. The p38 MAPK induces
  the increase of RUNX2 which is considered as master regulator of osteoblast-like
  differentiation. The decrease of RUNX2 eventually affects the VSMC to osteoblastic-like
  cell reprogramming leading to calcification suppression (upper panel). In contrast,
  FGFR1 activated by FGF23 results in different responses. The FGF23-FGFR1 coupling
  stimulates ERK1/2 which is common activated pathway in promoting calcification.
  This pathway leads to increase of MSX and OSX which promote osteogenic differentiation
  (bottom panel).
