caption: Energetic and biosynthetic functions of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in the
  control of metabolic homeostasis. (A) DNL produces lipids by disposing of glucose
  and calories. Whereas lipids can be directly incorporated into intracellular stores
  in an energetically efficient manner, the conversion of glucose into intracellular
  lipids via DNL is a costly process. Glucose enters the cell via specific glucose
  transporters. It is converted to pyruvate via glycolysis and, in this form, enters
  the mitochondria where it is converted to acetyl-CoA in order to enter the Krebs
  cycle. In the presence of excessive glucose and calories, citrate from the Krebs
  cycle is exported to the cytoplasm via the citrate carrier (CIC). The latter is
  the first committed step of DNL. Indeed, citrate is a powerful inducer of acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (ACC) activity, which produces malonyl-CoA, a major intermediate of
  fatty acid synthesis and an inhibitor of the fatty acid transporter CPT-1. However,
  it is important to consider that fatty acid synthase (FAS) consumes malonyl-CoA,
  limiting its accumulation and consequent inhibition of CPT-1. Because DNL and β-oxydation
  of fatty acids are distinct pathways, fatty acid synthesis and β-oxidation can occur
  simultaneously, creating futile cycles as described during brown adipose tissue
  activation and browning of white adipose tissue. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  is an important intracellular source of NADPH, which provides energy for DNL. Altogether
  DNL is an energetically inefficient way to form intracellular lipids and, in specific
  circumstances, can act as a considerable sink for calories and glucose. (B) DNL
  was also proposed to support the synthesis of several signaling molecules implicated
  in the control of metabolic homeostasis. These include specific lipids of the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum (SR) membrane controlling SERCA function and intracellular calcium; secreted
  lipids with cytokine-like activity supporting metabolic homeostasis “lipokines”,
  such as palmitoleic acid (PAO) and branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids
  (FAHFA); endogenous ligands of nuclear receptors including PPARα (16:0/18:1-GPC),
  PPARγ (alkyl ether lipids), and possibly LXR. DNL was also implicated in the palmitoylation
  and acetylation of specific proteins.
