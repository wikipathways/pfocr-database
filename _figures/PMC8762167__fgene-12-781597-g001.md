caption: The regulatory mechanisms of USCs and their secreted products. USCs and their
  secreted products, such as exosomes, extracellular vesicles, and USC-iPSCs, play
  an important role in disease the pathogeneses. USCs exert negative immunoregulatory
  functions and serve as antioxidants, as manifested by their increased SOD-1 levels
  and reduced HO-1 levels. USCs exert an antiautophagic effect, characterized by increased
  p62 levels and decreased levels of LC3-II and Beclin1. Furthermore, USCs promote
  angiogenesis mediated by VEGF, angiogenin, and PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Interestingly,
  their effect on apoptosis remains controversial, as they exhibit increased levels
  of the apoptotic protein Bax and decreased levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2.
