caption: Signaling pathways of LDL on cancer progression. The accumulation of LDL
  can damage the anti-tumor effects of T cells. Through up-regulating the expressions
  of stemness genes (Sox2, Bmi 1, Oct4, Nanog), LDL supports cancer metastasis. LDL
  activates p38 and MAPK as well as PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways, leading to cancer
  proliferation and metastasis. Besides, through activation of PI3K/Akt signaling,
  LDL compromises the TKI anti-tumor efficacy against cancer cells. LDL decreases
  adhesion molecules (CD226, Ocludin, Claudin 7, CDHR3), which help cell migration.
  Moreover, LDL can activate HER2/Akt/ERK signaling pathway and up-regulate STAT3
  target genes (including anti-apoptotic genes and MMP-9, Cyclin D1, COX-2) expression,
  which promote the survival and invasion of cancer cells.
