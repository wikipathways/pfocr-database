caption: 'The mechanisms involved in CAAs differentiation in CRC. Tumor-derived Il-6
  activates the lipolysis cascade in peritumoral white adipocytes through AMPK signaling
  pathway that increases the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and the free fatty
  acids (FFAs) release in TME. ZAG released by cancer cells stimulate lipid decomposition
  by ATGL and HSL-increased expression via MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, ERK1/2
  and JNK mediated pathways induce PDE3B- and PLIN-decreased expression that promote
  CAAs differentiation. Tumor-derived TNF-α induces metabolic remodeling in adipose
  tissue by increasing iNOS/NO through cAMP/cGMP pathway signaling activation. PAI-1
  activates LRP 1-dependent PI3K/AKT signaling axis and promotes the activation of
  PLOD2 in CAAs. Tumor-derived miRNAs are also involved in metabolic remodeling and
  CAAs differentiation through AMPK, NK-kB, and MAP3K8-Erk1/2-PPARγ signaling axis
  activation. Moreover, active recruitment of adipocytes by TME is another potential
  mechanism of CAAs differentiation in CRC. AMPK—AMP-activated protein kinase; ATGL—adipose
