caption: Model of T2R signaling in M0 MΦs. a Pathway diagram of T2R signaling investigated
  in this study, showing T2R inhibition of cAMP via Gαi and/or Gαgust isoforms. Gαi
  inhibits adenylyl cyclase while Gαgust activates phosphodiesterase (based on prior
  studies; not elucidated in this study), both of which inhibit cAMP production. As
  cAMP inhibits phagocytosis, the T2R pathway may promote phagocytosis when MΦs are
  co-stimulated with a cAMP elevating agonist by keeping cAMP levels reduced. Gβγ
  activation of phospholipase C (PLC), production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3),
  and elevation of calcium (Ca2+) activates eNOS and/or nNOS to produce nitric oxide
  (NO). NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) to produce cyclic-GMP (cGMP),
  which directly enhances phagocytosis. b Activation of MΦ T2Rs increases Ca2+, lowers
  cAMP, activates eNOS and nNOS, increases cGMP, and enhances phagocytosis. Acute
  increases in phagocytosis may also be activated by airway epithelial cell NO production.
