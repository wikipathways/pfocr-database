caption: A theoretical model for the host-parasite interaction between Neoparaomoeba
  perurans candidate genes and Atlantic salmon during the pathogenesis of amoebic
  gill disease (AGD). The pathway was generated from the differential gene expression
  and network analyses together with the key KEGG pathways mapped and visualized (sasa04310,
  sasa05168, sasa05132, hsa04151, hsa05146) for the host and the parasite. Pathogen
  invasion is facilitated by degradation of host mucus and epithelia. To maintain
  a pathogen friendly environment on the gill N. perurans releases factors to decrease
  ammonia and reactive oxygen species released by the host. Actin rearrangement of
  the pathogen and the host facilitates attachment. Virulence factors are modulated
  by the pathogen master two component PhoPQ virulence regulatory system. Downregulation
  of the host wnt, Ap-1 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways supports pathogen immune evasion,
  proliferation, and survival. The Th1/17 cell differentiation pathway is upregulated
  inducing innate and adaptive immune responses in the host. NP signifies N. perurans
