caption: Intracellular Ca2+ and CaM level is upregulated in leukemia cells. The activated
  CaMKII will further activate different oncogenic signaling in leukemia cells, such
  as p42/44, NF-kB, Stat3/5, b-catenin. The signaling will translocate to the nuclear
  by their downstream transcription factors, such as TCF, CREB. CaMKII has also been
  reported to inhibit the activation of RAR to block the differentiation. ITIM containing
  receptors can recruit CaMKI/IV directly or indirectly by phosphatase SHP-1. CaMKI/IV
  can be activated by classical CaMKK pathway. The coordinated regulation of CaMKI/IV
  by Ca2+signaling and ITIM containing receptor signaling is unknown. The activated
  CaMKI/IV then induce phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB. Finally,
  these signaling pathway will activate downstream genes to initiate the regulation
  of self-renewal, survival and differentiation of leukemia cells.

  description: Intracellular Ca2+ and CaM level is upregulated in leukemia cells.
    The activated CaMKII will further activate different oncogenic signaling in leukemia
    cells, such as p42/44, NF-kB, Stat3/5, b-catenin. The signaling will translocate
    to the nuclear by their downstream transcription factors, such as TCF, CREB. CaMKII
    has also been reported to inhibit the activation of RAR to block the differentiation.
    ITIM containing receptors can recruit CaMKI/IV directly or indirectly by phosphatase
    SHP-1. CaMKI/IV can be activated by classical CaMKK pathway. The coordinated regulation
    of CaMKI/IV by Ca2+signaling and ITIM containing receptor signaling is unknown.
    The activated CaMKI/IV then induce phosphorylation of the transcription factor
    CREB. Finally, these signaling pathway will activate downstream genes to initiate
    the regulation of self-renewal, survival and differentiation of leukemia cells.
