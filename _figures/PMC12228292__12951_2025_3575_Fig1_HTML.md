caption: Schematic illustration of the design and therapeutic mechanism of CeO2-Ac2-26@MM-LPs
  for ischemic stroke treatment. (A) Fabrication of macrophage-mimetic liposomal vesicles
  (CeO2-Ac2-26@MM-LPs). Macrophage membranes are extracted via hypotonic lysis and
  fused with synthetic lipid membranes composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
  (POPC) and cholesterol to form macrophage-mimetic liposomes (MM-LPs). For ischemic
  stroke treatment, cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2) and Ac2-26 peptides are loaded
  into MM-LPs during the hydration step. (B) Following systemic administration in
  a tMCAO mouse model, CeO2-Ac2-26@MM-LPs effectively accumulate in the ischemic brain
  tissues, utilizing the inflammation-targeting properties of macrophage membranes.
  Upon reaching the ischemic brain, CeO2-Ac2-26@MM-LPs can be taken up by neurons
  and endothelial cells, further releasing CeO2 and Ac2-26. CeO2 can scavenge ROS
  and improve mitochondrial function by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway and
  upregulating antioxidant defense genes (HO-1 and Nrf2) to prevent neuronal apoptosis.
  Simultaneously, Ac2-26 enhances BBB integrity by suppressing NF-κB activation and
  upregulating tight junction proteins. This dual-targeted approach provides synergistic
  neuroprotection to address key pathophysiological mechanisms of ischemic stroke
