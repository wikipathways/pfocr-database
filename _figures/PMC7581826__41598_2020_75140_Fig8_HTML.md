caption: A proposed model of the EEDK-induced cell death pathway. EEDK could activate
  the PDGFR-Rac-JNK signaling axis. In cancerous cells, which have high basal JNK
  activity, enhanced JNK activity exceeds a normal range of JNK activation, leading
  to JNK-AP-1/p53 mediated cell death. However, the same amount of EEDK is not sufficient
  to exceed the normal range of JNK activity in normal cells, which has low basal
  JNK activation, resulting in cell proliferation. Besides, EEDK could suppress Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway by promoting βTrCP expression and intracellular Ca2+ concentration. This
  figure was created using BioRender (https://biorender.com/).
