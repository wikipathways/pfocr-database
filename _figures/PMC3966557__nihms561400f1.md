caption: RGS proteins in the regulation of GPCR, PTH, and Wnt signaling pathways during
  bone remodeling. Binding of Wnt to the FZD receptor induces β-catenin accumulation,
  which translocates to the nucleus to activate target gene transcription, which is
  important for osteoblast differentiation. Axin2, a member of the RGS family, is
  found to form a stable complex with β-catenin to prevent its activation without
  Wnt. In osteoblasts, binding of PTH to its G-protein-coupled receptor (PTHR/PTHrPR)
  induces the expression of RGS proteins such as RGS2 and RGS5 via activation of the
  cAMP/PKA- pathway. RGS2 predominately binds to the Gq-subunit of the G-protein complex
  and inhibits activation of the PKC/Ca2+ dependent signaling cascade, which is involved
  in osteoblast differentiation. RGS5 likely regulates osteoblast differentiation
  through the regulation of PTH levels. In osteoclasts, PKC/Ca2+-induced NFATc1 is
  crucial for osteoclast differentiation. PLC is suggested to regulate the NFATc1
  expression through IP3/DAG. RGS10 and RGS12 regulate the activity of Gαq and Gαi/o
  to activate PLC, which is critical for calcium oscillation and the activation of
  NFATc1. NFATc1 activation leads to osteoclast differentiation. RGS18 negatively
  regulates osteoclast differentiation through acidosis-induced osteoclastogenic OGR1/NFAT
  signaling pathway.
