caption: Nanomaterials modulating TAM polarization for the treatment of HCC via the
  STAT signaling pathway.(1) IL-12 and DOX in TNPs inhibit STAT3, thereby inhibiting
  M2 TAM polarization. DOX in TNPs promoted apoptosis in HCC cells. (2) CNs promote
  STAT1 and inhibit STAT6, thereby promoting TAM polarization to the M1-type. (3)
  Man@pSiNPs-erastin targets M2 type TAMs through the MR and released erastin. Erastin
  inhibits xCT, thereby weakening STAT6 and reducing TAM polarization to the M2-type.
  In addition, the inhibition of xCT can promote TAM ferroptosis, thereby inhibiting
  PD-L1 expression. TAMs, Tumor-associated macrophages; HCC, Hepatocellular carcinoma;
  STAT, Signal transducer of activators of transcription; TNPs, Therapeutic nanoparticles;
  IL-12, Interleukin-12; DOX, Doxorubicin; CNs, chitosan-based nanoparticles; Man@pSiNPs-erastin,
  Mannose encapsulated to functionalized porous silicon nanoparticles-erastin; MR,
  Mannose receptor; xCT, Cysteine/glutamate transporter; PD-L1, Programmed cell death-ligand
