  about the downstream targets of YAP involved in a given step of cancer development

  correlations with poor prognosis in human patients. Steps of cancer development
  (indicated in bold uppercase) are proliferation, survival, invasion, migration and
  immunosuppression. They are linked to a given pathway by black bold arrows. Thin
  black arrows indicate either YAP-dependent protein overexpression (if the protein
  is reported in black) or protein downregulation (if reported in red). If the molecular
  pathway involves the contribution of additional YAP-dependent proteins expression,
  they are reported close to the arrows and preceded by “+”. Otherwise, red lines
