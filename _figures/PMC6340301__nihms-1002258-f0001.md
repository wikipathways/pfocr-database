caption: (A) Mode of action of Gin A and two other S6K1 inhibitors, PF-4708671 and
  A77 1726. Overnutrition with high concentrations of fatty acids and amino acids
  leads to constitutive S6K1 activation, which phosphorylates IRS-1S1101, leading
  to poor AKT activation. S6K1 inhibitors such as Gin A inhibit S6K1 activity and
  subsequently inhibit IRS-1S1101 phosphorylation, resulting in better interaction
  with the p85 subunit of PI3K and AKT activation. Activated AKT stimulates GLUT4
  membrane translocation and glycogen synthesis but decreases gluconeogenesis. Chronic
  use of rapamycin leads to inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, thus exacerbating
  hyperglycemia. (B) Chemical structure of Gin A.
