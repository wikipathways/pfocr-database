caption: Schematic diagrams of CERT and the ceramide metabolism in response to hyperosmotic
  stress. (A) The enhanced ER-tethering of CERT via the S315-phosphorylation under
  hyperosmotic conditions. Under isosmotic conditions, a major population of CERT,
  multiply phosphorylated in the SRM, localizes to the ER or the cytosol, while a
  minor population of CERT, which is de/hypo-phosphorylated in the SRM, may localize
  at the ER–Golgi MCSs. Under hyperosmotic conditions, a majority of CERT are phosphorylated
  at the S315 residue with SRM-hyperphosphorylation resulting in enhancement of tethering
  to the ER, rather than localization at the ER–Golgi MCSs, via the increased binding
  of CERT to VAP-A. (B) A hypothetical model that may account for the increased VL-SM
  synthesis under hyperosmotic conditions in a CERT-independent manner. Ceramide synthesized
  in the ER is transported to the trans-Golgi, where SM synthase 1 (SMS1) locates,
  via a CERT-dependent (solid line) or -independent (dotted line) pathway. In wild-type
  HeLa cells under isosmotic conditions, long-chain ceramides (L-ceramides), which
  are mainly catalyzed by CERS5, are delivered from the ER to the distal Golgi regions
  preferentially via the CERT-dependent pathway, whereas very-long-chain ceramides
  (VL-ceramides), which are mainly catalyzed by CERS2, are presumably transported
  to the proximal or more broad Golgi regions via a CERT-independent pathway(s), of
  which the entity remains elusive. Under hyperosmotic conditions, the synthesis of
  VL-ceramides is enhanced, and therefore, a greater amount of VL-ceramides is delivered
  to the Golgi via the CERT-independent pathway, thereby enhancing the synthesis of
  VL-SM.
