caption: Overlapping canonical pathways map representing shared biology among the
  identified 17-gene set. The network of overlapping canonical pathways shows each
  pathway as a single “node” colored proportionally to the Fisher’s exact test p value,
  where darker shading means greater significance. A line connects any two pathways
  that share at least one gene in common.
