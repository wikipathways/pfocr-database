caption: Necroptosis molecular pathway. Necroptotic cell death can be triggered by
  numerous factors, including death receptors, TLRs, and intracellular receptors.
  The ligation of TNF to its receptor (TNFR1) recruits TNFR type 1-associated via
  death domain (TRADD) and RIPK1 via their death domain (DD) (pink ellipse). TRADD
  recruits TNF receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and cellular inhibitors of apoptosis
  (cIAPs) to collectively form complex I, together with the linear ubiquitin chain
  assembly complex (LUBAC). In complex I, RIPK1 is ubiquitylated to induce nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) nuclear translocation
  and signaling. This signaling results in the expression of inflammatory cytokines
  and pro-survival proteins, such as c-FLIP. When complex I activity is impaired,
  or following TNFR1 endocytosis, the assembly of a RIPK1/caspase-8/FADD/c-FLIP cytosolic
  complex, complex II, can occur. Caspase-8, in complex with c-FLIP, cleaves and inactivates
  RIPK1 and RIPK3. When caspase-8 activity is blocked, phosphorylation and oligomerization
  of RIPK3 leads to necroptosis by inducing phosphorylation of MLKL followed by its
  translocation to the cell membrane. The cellular contents released from necroptotic
  cells can serve as DAMPs to further induce inflammation. Similarly, when caspase-8
  activity is blocked, necroptosis can also be induced by interferons (IFNs) (green
  ellipse), TLRs (blue ellipse), and DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors
  (DAI) (purple ellipse). IFNs stimulate Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and
  activator of transcription (STAT) signaling upon ligation of IFN receptors (IFNRs)
  resulting in RIPK1 and/or RIPK3 activation. TLRs can recruit RIPK3 via TIR-domain-containing
  adaptor-inducing interferon- β (TRIF) upon ligation by lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
  (for TLR4) or dsRNA (for TLR3). DAI directly interacts with RIPK3 via a RHIM-RHIM
  interaction upon sensing of dsDNA
