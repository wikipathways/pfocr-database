caption: Retinoic acid (RA) synthesis pathway in the gut. CD103+ DCs are major RA
  producers in LP, Peyer's patch, and MLN. Epithelial cells in the small intesine
  produce RA spontaneously. Intestinal epithelial cell-derived RA enhances CD11bc−F4/80+
  macrophages to produce GM-CSF, which in combination with RA promotes CD103+ DCs
  in LP to produce more RA in SI-LP. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for RA production
  in LP CD103+ DCs. TLR2/5 ligands derived from dietary digestion products enhance
  RA synthesis in CD103+ DCs. In contrast, PGE2 inhibits RA production. 4-1BB l is
  required for MLN-DCs to produce RA. In addition, in MLN, stromal cells also produce
  RA, which in turn drives RA production by CD103+ DCs.
