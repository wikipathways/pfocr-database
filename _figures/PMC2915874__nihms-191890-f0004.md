caption: Effect of estrogen on endothelium-dependent pathways of vascular relaxation.
  E2 causes upregulation of COX-1 expression and PGI2synthesis in endothelial cells
  and also increases endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) production.
  Estrogen binds to endothelial surface membrane ER and activates phospholipase C
  (PLC), leading to the generation of inositol 1,4,5- triphosphate (IP3) and DAG.
  IP3 stimulates the release of stored Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, followed
  by influx of extracellular Ca2+. Ca2+ forms a complex with calmodulin (CAM), which
  causes initial activation of eNOS, its dissociation from caveolin-1, and its translocation
  to intracellular sites. Estrogen also activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
  leading to transformation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates Akt. ER-mediated activation of Akt or
  MAPK pathway causes phosphorylation of cytosolic eNOS and its second translocation
  back to the cell membrane where it undergoes myristoylation and palmitoylation to
  become fully activated. Fully activated eNOS promotes the transformation of L-arginine
  to L-citrulline and the production of NO, which diffuses through the endothelial
  cell and causes VSM relaxation.
