caption: The proposed mechanism of action involves the cellular uptake of the drug-loaded
  NPs followed by synergistic photo窶田hemo-degradation, which leads to enhanced drug
  liberation and endosome photo-disruption via HP activation and hydrophobization;
  cell death is augmented by the combination of the CPT-topoisomerase I interaction
  and the phototoxic pathway via ROS accumulation in the cytoplasm.
