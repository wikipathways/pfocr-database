caption: Proposed pathway of TGFβ2–TLR4 signaling crosstalk in the glaucomatous TM.
  TLR4 is activated by endogenous ligands known as DAMPs, which are produced in response
  to cell damage and increased ECM production and accumulation. TLR4 signals through
  the MyD88/NFκB signaling pathway, leading to downregulation of BAMBI and uninhibited
  TGFβ2 signaling. The increased TGFβ2 signaling leads to an increase in DAMP and
  ECM production, which can further activate TLR4. The feed-forward loop produced
  by TGFβ2-TLR4 signaling leads to progressive fibrosis in the TM.
