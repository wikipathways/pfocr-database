caption: The ability of HEDS to interfere with thiol redox homeostasis and elicit
  loss of protein function and cell death occurs in glucose-deprived cells where HEDS
  detoxification is inefficient (Pathways 1–6). (A.) HEDS effect on non-protein thiols
  (NPSH). Bioreductive/detoxification pathways are similarly active in cells receiving
  adequate glucose independent of p53 status. HEDS may react spontaneously with GSH
  or in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) may produce non protein
  disulfides (RSSR including GSSG and/or mixed disulfide (MESSG) of glutathione (GSH))
  and mercaptoethanol (ME) (Pathway 1). MESSG, if produced, may also react with GSH
  to produce ME and oxidized GSH (GSSG) through the catalytic action of glutaredoxin
  (GRX) (Pathway 2). In contrast, glucose-deprived cells convert HEDS into ME with
  poor efficiency, demonstrating that reductants needed to detoxify HEDS require intracellular
  glucose (Pathway 3). GSH loss in glucose-depleted cells is likely caused by reduced
  activity of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle, a crucial factor in GSH homeostasis
  by recycling oxidized GSSG back to GSH via glutathione reductase (GRase) and NADPH
  (Pathway 4). (B). HEDS effect on protein thiols. HEDS, GSSG and/or HEDS-glutathione
  mixed disulfide (MESSG) produced by HEDS can react with protein thiols (PSH). Oxidation
  of PSH and loss of Ku function in glucose-depleted cells argues that oxidative pentose
  phosphate cycle (Pathways 3 and 4) is a crucial pathway for repair of oxidized protein
  thiols, either through the action of thioredoxin reductase (TRase)/thioredoxin (TRx)/NADPH
  (Pathway 5) or glutaredoxin (GRx) and GSH (Pathway 6).
