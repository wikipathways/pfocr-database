caption: Protective effects of cold-induced saccharides at the subcellular level.
  The figure highlights the (putative) action sites of sugars accumulating during
  CS responses in higher plants cells. The grey dotted line refers to the proposed
  vesicular transport mechanism of fructans from the vacuole to the plasma membrane
  in fructan accumulating species (Valluru et al., ). The green dotted line refers
  to the possible roles of anthocyanins in CS protection. Anthocyanins are also imported
  in the vacuole through ABC class transporters (Francisco et al., ), where they can
  contribute in alleviating CS. The blue arrow represents the signaling pathway leading
  to the activation of CBFs. The biosynthesis and metabolic conversions of the sugars
  involved is oversimplified and represented by grey arrows. CBFs, C-repeat binding
  factors; GAs, gibberellins; GAox, GA oxidase; GolS, galactinol synthase; βAM, β-amylase;
  Suc, sucrose. Specific effects of different sugars/anthocyanins are highlighted
  in italic. Readers are referred to the figure legend and the text for further details.
