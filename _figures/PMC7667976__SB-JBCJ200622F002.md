caption: Pharmacologic targeting of the IRE1 UPR signaling pathway. A, simplified
  mechanism of ER stress–dependent activation and downstream signaling of the IRE1
  UPR signaling pathway. B, domain architecture of IRE1, including the luminal domain,
  transmembrane domain (TM), and the cytosolic kinase and RNase domains. Enzymatic
  activities of key domains are as shown in A, where the cytosolic kinase domain of
  IRE1 participates in trans-autophosphorylation, and, upon activation, the RNase
  domain functions through both XBP1 mRNA splicing and RIDD. C, image showing the
  binding of ADP to the nucleotide-binding pocket of human IRE1 (). D, structures
  of the IRE1 RNase active site inhibitors 4µ8c and STF-083010. E, structures of the
  Type II IRE1 kinase inhibitors Compound 3 and KIRA6 that inhibit both IRE1 kinase
  activity and RNase activity. F, structures of Type I IRE1 kinase inhibitors that
  inhibit IRE1 kinase activity while allosterically activating the IRE1 RNase. G,
  structures of the new IRE1/XBP1s-activating compounds IXA1, IXA4, and IXA6 identified
  through an HTS that prioritized transcriptional profiling.
