caption: Mechanisms of the anti-apoptotic action of MSCs in the hepatocyte–MSC co-cultures.
  MSCs inhibit stress-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in hepatocytes through
  the secretion of the hepatotrophic factors IL-6, HGF, and PGE2, as well as through
  the production of the miRNA-loaded exosomes. In stressed hepatocytes, MSCs downregulate
  the expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bax, cleaved caspase 3, and BID and
  upregulate the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. MSC-produced PGE2
  activates two interconnected signaling pathways involved in liver regeneration.
  YAP activation is mediated through p-CREB and leads to the suppression of PTEN by
  miR-29a-3p and subsequent activation of mTOR signaling, ultimately leading to the
  inhibition of apoptosis and an increase in hepatocyte proliferation. MSCs reduce
  the miR143 level in hepatocytes subjected to oxidative stress and, accordingly,
  increase the levels of HK2 and ADRB1. This results in decreased oxidative phosphorylation
  and a switch to glycolysis, ultimately leading to hepatocyte proliferation and protection
  from apoptosis. MSCs attenuate damage caused by oxidative stress in hepatocytes
  by inhibiting miR-486-5p, upregulating PIM1, and blocking TGF-β/Smad signaling.
  MSCs activate PTEN/AKT signaling pathway in damaged hepatocytes by upregulating
  miR-20a-5p, thus enhancing their proliferation. MSC-derived exosomal miR-124 promoted
  liver regeneration by enhancing hepatocyte proliferation through the downregulation
  of Foxg1. IL-6—interleukin-6; HGF—hepatocyte growth factor; PGE2—prostaglandin E2;
  YAP—Yes-associated protein; p-CREB—p-cAMP-responsive element binding protein; PTEN—phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; mTOR—mammalian target of rapamycin; HK2—hexokinase 2; ADRB1—beta-1-adrenergic
  receptor; PIM1—proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus kinase
  1; TGF-β—transforming growth factor-β.
