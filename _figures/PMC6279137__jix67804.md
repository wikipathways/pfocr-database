caption: Diagnostic landscape to detect Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV)
  infections and the pathway to adoption. The Zika public health emergency triggered
  significant efforts toward the development of new diagnostic assays. Commercial
  kits and in-house laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) are available to detect ZIKV
  and DENV infections. Multiplex assays that simultaneously detect ZIKV and other
  arboviral infections (DENV, CHIKV and others) are also available. Target product
  profiles (TPP) are used to define the desired technical and operational characteristics
  of a test. Quality-assured clinical laboratories can develop, validate, and then
  implement their in-house LDTs. Commercial kits require clinical validation, scale
  production, distribution, and regulatory approval to be adopted for wide use. Two
  DENV commercial kits (1 nucleic acid amplification test [NAT] and 1 immunoglobulin
  M [IgM]–capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) have been cleared by
  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Emergency use authorization mechanisms by
  the FDA (the Emergency Use Authorization [EUA] authority) and the World Health Organization
  (the Emergency Use Assessment and Listing [EUAL] procedure) were put into place
  to accelerate adoption of ZIKV commercial kits in response to the Zika public health
  emergency. In bold are the types of assays that are currently in the pipeline (most
  assays are stuck at the evaluation stage because of the lack of access to well-characterized
  clinical specimens). BOB, blockade of binding; CDC, Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention; IgG, immunoglobulin G; PRNT, plaque-reduction neutralization test;
  RT-PCR, reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction; R&D, research and development.
  aAssays that require laboratory infrastructure. bNo rapid diagnostic test (RDT)
  has been cleared by the FDA nor received EUA/EUAL approval to date.
