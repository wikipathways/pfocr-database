caption: Under cardiomyogenic conditions, Nkx2.5 resides in the nucleus and activates
  cardiac gene expression. In response to Wnt3a signalling, Mypt1 is phosphorylated
  at Thr853 by ROCK, causing MP to translocate into the nucleus, where it can engage
  Nkx2.5 and form a complex, which is then exported from the nucleus in a Crm1-dependent
  pathway.
