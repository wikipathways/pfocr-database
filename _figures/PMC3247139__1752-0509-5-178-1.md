caption: 'Topological scheme of modeled cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways. Main
  components of cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways and their cross-talk and downstream
  effects are depicted: Major signaling components of the simplified cAMP signaling
  pathway are shown in yellow, pivotal components of cGMP signaling in green and the
  three central cyclic nucleotide degrading phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are depicted
  in blue. Both, cAMP and cGMP signaling share in downstream effects on VASP (brown),
  which is phosphorylated at both, Ser157 and Ser239 differentially upon cyclic nucleotide
  dependent activation of their corresponding protein kinases (PKA, PKG). Levels of
  cAMP and cGMP react sensitively to pathway modulating compounds such as inhibitors
  of PDEs (Cilostamide, Milrinone) as well as adenylyl cyclase (AC) stimulating drugs
  (Iloprost, Forskolin) shown in red rectangles. This direct activation (green dashed
  arrow) and/or inhibition (red arrow) leads to an elevated cAMP level which subsequently
  feeds back on PDE3 (positive feedback) as well as on AC (negative feedback), as
  indicated by bold green and red colored arrows.'
