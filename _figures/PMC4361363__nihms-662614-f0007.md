caption: SNX5 (bound to Mib) moves to the site of Delta activation, where it binds
  to the membrane as Mib ubiquitylates Delta. SNX5 then facilitates membrane curvature
  and Delta endocytosis, which is required for cleavage of the Notch extracellular
  domain (NECD). Cleavage of the NECD frees the Notch intracellular domain (NICD)
  which is translocated to the nucleus to co-activate downstream target genes with
  the CSL transcription factor.
