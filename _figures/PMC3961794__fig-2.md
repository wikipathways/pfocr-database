caption: Mechanisms of substrate acquisition for HO-1 in macrophages and monocytes.
  Hemoglobin (Hb) released by erythrocyte lysis is rapidly bound by the acute-phase
  protein, haptoglobin (Hp). Free extracellular heme is bound by the acute-phase protein,
  hemopexin (Hx). The Hp:Hb and Hx:heme complexes bind to the CD163 and CD91 surface
  receptors, respectively, and are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
  The mechanism of myoglobin (Mb) clearance is currently unknown and may involve either
  a cell surface receptor such as CD163 or Hx-mediated clearance of heme after it
  is liberated from Mb by oxidation. In the early endosome, the CD163 or CD91 receptor
  is recycled to the cell membrane. In the late endosome, Hp and Hx and the globin
  chain of Hb are degraded, liberating the heme molecule. Heme is transported to the
  cytosol by HRG1 (or HCP-1 if it is liberated in the early endosome) for degradation
  by HO-1, producing equimolar quantities of CO, Fe2+, and biliverdin. CO has anti-inflammatory
  properties. Due to its ferroxidase activity, ferritin oxidizes ferrous iron (Fe2+)
  to ferric iron (Fe3+) for safe storage. Iron can also be exported from the cell
  by ferroportin. Biliverdin is rapidly converted to bilirubin, a potent antioxidant,
  by the enzyme biliverdin reductase. As depicted, this pathway is subject to control
  by immunological mediators such as cytokines and TLR receptor agonists (see text
  for discussion). CO, carbon monoxide; Hx:heme, hemopexin complexed with heme.
