caption: Classical MAS Organ Pattern versus COVID-19 Related Picture.Panel A). The
  MAS/sHLH picture is associated with viral and other infections that does not have
  a special tropism for pulmonary tissues. The hyper-activation of T-cells is associated
  with lymphoid organ hyperplasia with hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy. The resulting
  excessive reticuloendothelial system activity manifests as bone marrow haemophagocytosis
  and deranged liver function tests, deranged lipid profiles as a result of liver
  Kupffer cell dysfunction. Systemically circulating activated macrophages contribute
  to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A similar picture can develop in
  primary HLH that represents a rare group of immunodeficiency, linked to impaired
  cytolytic activity due to perforin pathway loss of function, with expansion of immune
  cells and the lymphoid organs that house them. In primary HLH, cytokine antagonism
  used with anti-microbial therapy may temporarily help prior to definitive bone marrow
  transplantation. Pulmonary involvement may be a feature of both pHLH and sHLH.Panel
  B). There is evidence for MAS/sHLH emerging in the COVID-19 setting that is supported
  by the abnormal laboratory parameters without reporting of the classical organomegaly
  pattern described in A. Hyperactivation and over-zealous immune activity appears
  to be more confined to the lung parenchyma and immediately adjacent bronchial alveolar
  lymphoid tissue and is associated with ARDS development. Pulmonary haemophagocytosis
  has has been occasionally reported in human coronavirus infection but not yet been
  reported in COVID-19 associated pneumonia [].It is proposed that severe widespread
  alveolar and interstitial inflammation extends to the closely juxtaposed pulmonary
  vasculature. The normal circulatory fibrinogen levels and regional fibrinolysis
  with elevated D-dimer formation seen in early COVID-19 pneumonia is not a feature
  of typical acute onset MAS/HLH. This MAS-like intra-pulmonary inflammation might
  influence a propensity towards severe local vascular dysfunction including micro-thrombosis
  and haemorrhage resulting in a lung centric pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy
  (PIC) presentation rather than a DIC presentation
