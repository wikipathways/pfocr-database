  systems in medullary collecting duct principal cell under normal conditions (left),
  and how they are deranged in acquired NDI (right). (−) and (+) signs denote inhibition
  and stimulation, respectively. X marks indicate blocked pathways. Thicker arrows
  indicate accentuation of pathways. Thinner arrows indicate attenuation of pathways.
  Black arrow stands for the pathway already known in the literature. Red arrows stand
  for the pathways deciphered and reported by us. For the details of the pathways
  marked by A, B, C, D and E, please refer to the relevant section of the text. (reproduced
