caption: (a) The biochemical pathway of melanin synthesis occurs within melanosomes
  or pheomelanosomes, directing to the production of eumelanin or pheomelanin, (b)
  The developmental stages of melanosomes (I-IV) during melanin synthesis. Stage I
  and II comprise immature, unmelanized premelanosomes, structural proteins, as well
  as melanin synthesizing enzymes transported from other organelles to immature, non-pigmented
  Stage II premelanosomes. Melanin deposition begins at Stage III melanosomes and
  the organelle is fully melanized by mature Stage IV melanosomes
