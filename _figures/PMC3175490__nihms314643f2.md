caption: Intracellular signaling pathways integrate dopamine and glutamate signals.
  D1 receptor activation increases adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation, cAMP formation,
  and PKA activation. PKA phosphorylates DARPP-32 at Thr-34 residue, making it a potent
  inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1). Inhibition of PP-1 indirectly increases
  extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) activation, by preventing PP-1 from
  dephosphorylating striatal-enriched phosphatase (STEP), which, when dephosphorylated,
  inhibits ERK. NMDA and AMPA receptor activation increases ca++ influx, whereas mGluR1
  activation causes release of intracellular calcium through the phospholipase C (PLC),
  inositol trisphosphate (IP3) pathway. Ca++ activates a number of signaling pathways,
  including calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKII), and protein phosphatase
  2B (PP-2B). PP-2B activation results in Thr-75 DARPP-32 phosphorylation, through
  casein kinase (ck) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5). When phospohrylated at
  Thr-75, DARPP-32 becomes an inhibitor of PKA. PP-2B also dephosphoryltes DARPP-32
  at Thr-34. These effects negatively regulate ERK activation. CamKII activates ERK
  via the ras-raf-mek cascade. Thus ERK activation depends on the phosphorylation
  state of DARPP-32, which itself is sensitive to the relative activation of glutamate
  and DA receptors. ERK regulates gene expression through its phosphorylation of transcription
  factors, such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and regulates neural
  excitability through its phosphorylation of the Kv4.2 channel. Red arrows indicate
  negative regulation of ERK, green arrows indicate positive regulation of ERK.
