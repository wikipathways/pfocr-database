caption: 'Schematic diagram of HDL metabolic pathways and current drugs under development.
  Numbers in circles refer to . Pathway influencing HDL cholesterol metabolism, flux,
  and potential targets of therapeutic interventions. Both liver and intestine synthesize
  apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) secreted as lipid-poor particles. These particles are
  lipidated with phospholipids and cholesterol via the hepatocyte ATP-binding cassette
  A1 (ABCA1) transporter to form nascent HDL. In peripheral tissues these HDL particles
  obtain free cholesterol via the macrophage ABCA1 and ABCG1 transporters, which are
  regulated by LXRs and miR-33. Free cholesterol transferred via ABCA1 and ABCG1 onto
  HDL is esterified by lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) to form cholesteryl
  esters (CE). Mature HDL thus formed exchange CE trough cholesteryl ester transfer
  protein (CETP) onto apoB-containing lipoproteins, (VLDL and LDL) with subsequent
  uptake in the liver via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). PLTP mediates
  transfer of phospholipid from triglyceride from VLDL into HDL, which promote HDL
  remodeling. The resulting HDL3 particles can be either taken up by the liver via
  SB-B1 or modified by hepatic lipase (HL) and endothelial lipase (EL), which hydrolyze
  HDL phospholipids and triglycerides. Metabolism by EL releases lipid-poor apoA-I,
  which can be catabolized in kidney. Targets of HDL-directed therapeutic interventions
  are indicated by red arrow.'
