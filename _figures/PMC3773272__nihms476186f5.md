caption: Scopolamine rapidly increases the number, maturation, and function of spine
  synapses in pyramidal neurons in the medial PFC. This could occur via increased
  glutamate transmission, or a glutamate burst resulting in a long-term potentiation
  (LTP) like synaptogenic effect. The induction of glutamate could occur via blockade
  of muscarinic receptors located on GABAergic interneurons, acetylcholine (Ach) terminals,
  or even glutamate terminals. In addition, postsynaptic muscarinic receptors that
  couple to protein kinase C (PKC) can produce long-term depression (LTD), and blockade
  of these receptors could enhance the synaptogenic response to glutamate. Scopolamine
  also increases mTORC1-p70S6K (S6K) signaling resulting in increased translation
  of synaptic proteins, including AMPA receptors, which are required for the expansion
  and stabilization of spines. The antidepressant behavioral responses to scopolamine
  require activation of the mTORC1 pathway (demonstrated by blockade with rapamycin).
  The actions of ketamine, another rapid acting antidepressant, require BDNF-TrkB-Akt
  signaling, and we hypothesize that scopolamine-induction of mTORC1 signaling also
  requires release of this neurotrophic factor, although this has not yet been tested.
  The model also shows that depression relapse, as well as stress, are associated
  with a reduction in spine synapses, due to failure of synaptic homeostasis. This
  could result from genetic mutations or environmental factors such as sustained stress,
  and decreased expression of BDNF.
