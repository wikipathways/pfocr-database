caption: Molecular mechanism(s) underlying the abnormal GABAAergic system in HD. (a)
  In the normal condition, adult neurons express high KCC2 and few NKCC1 to maintain
  the lower intracellular chloride concentration, which results in an inward flow
  of chloride when GABAA receptors are activated. Astrocytes function normally for
  the homeostasis of glutamate, potassium and glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle. (b)
  In Huntington's disease, reduced GABAA receptor-mediated neuronal inhibition is
  associated with enhanced NKCC1 expression and a decreased expression in KCC2 and
  membrane localized GABAA receptors. The dysregulated GABAAergic system might be
  caused by mutant HTT, excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation or other factors. Mutant
  HTT in neurons alters the transcription of genes (GABAAR and KCC2) through interactions
  with transcriptional activators (SP1) and repressors (REST/NRSF). Mutant HTT in
  neurons also disrupts the intracellular trafficking of GABAARs to the cellular membrane.
  HD astrocytes have impaired homeostasis of extracellular potassium/glutamate (due
  to deficits of astrocytic Kir4.1 channel and glutamate transporters, Glt-1) and
  cause neuronal excitability, which might be related to the changes of KCC2, NKCC1
  and GABAAR. The activity of KCC2 could be affected through its interacting proteins,
  such as CKB and mHTT. Neuroinflammation, which is evoked by the interaction of HD
  astrocyte and microglia, enhances NKCC1 expression in neurons at the transcriptional
  level through an NF-κB-dependent pathway. HD astrocytes also have compromised astrocytic
  metabolism of glutamate/GABA–glutamine cycle that contributes to lower GABA synthesis.
