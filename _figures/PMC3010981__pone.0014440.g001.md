caption: Stimulation with Ragweed pollens, allergens, growth factors, or cytokines
  cause increased ROS production inside the cells. The ROS could oxidize membrane
  lipids to form lipid aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), which readily reacts
  with glutathione and form GS-conjugates such as GS-HNE. AR catalyzes the reduction
  of GS-HNE into GS-DHN. The latter is known to activate various downstream protein
  kinases such as PKC, PI3K and MAPK activating transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1
  which transcribe various inflammatory markers, including IL-13 which in paracrine
  fashion induces more ROS formation. The GS-DHN could also phosphorylate JAK-1 and
  MAPK such as ERK1/2, eventually phosphorylating and activating STAT-6 which translocate
  to the nucleus and transcribe genes including mucin genes leading to goblet cell
  metaplasia. The continuously formed GSDHN may amplify the signaling loop by increased
  ROS production via PKC/NOX pathway. Inhibition of AR blocks the initial as well
  as the amplification loop and prevents ROS-induced pathological changes , .
