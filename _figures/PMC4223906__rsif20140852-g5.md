caption: A condensed illustration of the main metabolic pathways in this study. Galactose
  is converted to glucose via the Leloir pathway, which requires ATP. Glucose is broken
  down to pyruvate with a net yield of ATP. Pyruvate proceeds into the Krebs cycle,
  producing ATP and reduced electron carriers for oxidative phosphorylation. Glutamine
  feeds into the Krebs cycle as α-ketoglutarate.
