caption: Approved clinical uses of PDE5 inhibitors. Nitric oxide (NO) is produced
  by neurons and endothelial cells. Inside smooth muscle cells, NO activates soluble
  guanylyl cyclase (sGC), promoting the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)
  to the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Thereafter, cGMP
  activates protein kinase G (PKG), whose phosphorylation mediates activities of various
  membrane channels/pumps, leading to decreased intracellular calcium levels resulting
  in smooth muscle relaxation (SMR). Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) regulates cGMP levels
  by degrading it into inactive 5′ guanosine monophosphate (5′ GMP). PDE5-Is can thus
  enhance the cGMP/PKG pathway, boosting the relaxation of various smooth muscles.
  In the penis corpus cavernosum, SMR favors erection due to increased penile arterial
  inflow, and thus PDE5-Is are approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.
  In the lungs, PDE5-Is lead to vasodilation of pulmonary vasculature, which, along
  with other mechanisms, such as suppressed DNA synthesis and proliferation and enhanced
  apoptosis of pulmonary artery cells, increased endothelial progenitor cell number,
  and enhanced release of vasodilating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from erythrocytes
  culminate in effectiveness in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
  In the lower urinary tract (LUT), PDE5-Is mediate prostate and bladder SMR, vasodilation
  and increased LUT oxygen perfusion. In addition, PDE5-Is could suppress prostatitis,
  bladder afferent nerve activity and prostate stroma cell proliferation, and thus
  indicated in the treatment of LUT symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia
  (BPH).
