caption: Schematic illustration. HGF is a very important cytokine derived from ADSCs
  by paracrine function. The interaction of ADSCs and tumor cells could promote the
  HGF secretion in ADSCs and tumor cells. When co-cultured with ADSCs, the HGF/c-MET
  pathway could be activated in cervical cancer cells, resulting in a more proliferative
  and invasive phenotype of cervical cancer. Once treated with c-MET siRNA to inhibit
  the c-MET protein expression, the tumor proliferative and invasive ability induced
  by ADSCs could be repressed.
