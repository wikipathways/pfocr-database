caption: Carcinoembryonic antigen‐related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) as a
  central mediator of vascular aging. In the course of vascular aging, CEACAM1 expression
  is increased. CEACAM1 promotes aortic upregulation of the pro‐inflammatory cytokine
  TNF‐α that, in turn, further contributes to an enhanced CEACAM1 expression. This
  mutual influence establishes a feed‐forward loop maintaining a chronic pro‐inflammatory
  milieu within the vessel wall. Upregulated TNF‐α may induce expression of pro‐oxidative
  enzymes, that is, NOX2, that contribute to an oxidative stress‐mediated stabilization
  of HIF‐1α. HIF‐1α that induces VEGF/VEGFR‐2 signaling thus promotes endothelial
  hyperpermeability of aged vessels. Beside this pathway leading to age‐related endothelial
  dysfunction, upregulated TNF‐α may also account for the age‐dependently increased
  arterial fibrosis via enhanced TGF‐β/TGF‐βR1 signaling. In the presence of additional
  risk factors, these CEACAM1‐mediated age‐dependent vascular alterations may transform
  into the development of vascular disorders, that is, atherosclerosis
