caption: 'Neddylation activates ubiquitination of E3 ligase CRLs. A typical SCF complex
  (purple) is used as an example of a CRL. The activity of CRL is controlled by two
  major pathways: 1) ubiquitin (Ub) is activated by E1 and transferred to Cul1 by
  E2, and 2) Cul1 is covalently modified by Nedd8 (N8) via the BP1-activated neddylation
  pathway. Neddylation changes Cul1 into its active conformation for ubiquitination
  of the target protein β-catenin, which binds to the substrate receptor βTrCP1. Skp1
  is the adaptor that bridges Cul1 and βTrCP1. The neddylation pathway is also regulated
  by COP9, CAND1, and ASPP2. Green arrows indicate recycling of the components.'
