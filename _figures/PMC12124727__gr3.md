  biplot derived from the PCA model performed on SKM pol ar metabolome data including
  three studied groups and eight metabolites involved in the H2S pathway. Keys: Wild
  type mice (WT, green, squares; n = 5), obese mice (db/db, pink, stars; n = 5), 3-mercaptopyruvate
  sulfurtransferase knock-out mice (Mpst−/−, red, diamonds; n = 5), metabolites (grey,
  dots). b In mammalian cells, the transsulfuration pathway (TSP) is a metabolic pathway
  that converts the amino acid l-methionine into l-cysteine. This pathway is crucial
  for the synthesis of sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), taurine, glutathione
  and 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP). The 3-MP is converted into H2S and pyruvate by the
  action of MPST. The reaction catalyzed by MPST comprises two successive sulfur transfer
  steps. In the first one, the sulfur atom is transferred from 3-MP to MPST, resulting
  in a cysteine persulfide intermediate (MPST-cys-S-SH) in the active site. In the
  second step-reaction, the sulfane sulfur is transferred to a thiophilic acceptor
  (depicted as R–SH), resulting in the regeneration of the MPST enzyme and a new persulfide
  product (RS-SH) from which H2S can be liberated. Similarly, the persulfidated MPST
  can react with reduced (thioredoxin) Trx realizing H2S and oxidized Trx. Abbreviation:
  CAT, cysteine aminotransferase; CBS, cystathionine beta-synthase; CDO cysteine dioxygenase;
  CSAD, cysteine sulfonic acid decarboxylase; CSE, cystathionine-γ-lyase; GS: glutathione
  synthase; HDD, hypotaurine dehydrogenase; MPST, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase;
  γ-GCS: Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase'
