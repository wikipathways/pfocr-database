caption: The glucose–fatty acid cycle. A simplified diagram showing the interactions
  of products of glucose metabolism with free fatty acids (FFA) uptake and vice versa.
  ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; F16BP, fructose 1,6 bisphosphate; G6P, glucose 6 phosphate;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; LCFAcyl CoA, long-chain fatty
  acyl CoA; MDC, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase; ECF, extracellular fluid. Malonyl-CoA
  is a by-product of glucose oxidation and inhibits carnitine palmitoyl transferase,
  an enzyme controlling fatty acid entry into the mitochondria. Malonyl-CoA concentrations
  in the steady state are a balance between the activity of ACC and MDC. When FFA
  is more abundant, metabolites favour activity of MCD via inhibition of the protein
  kinase A signalling pathway. When glucose is in excess, this pathway is stimulated,
  malonyl-CoA levels increase and FFA metabolism is inhibited.
