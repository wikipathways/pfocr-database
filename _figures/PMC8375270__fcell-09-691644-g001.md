caption: Overview of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway and modulation by oncoviruses.
  On the left, in the absence of HH ligands (SHH, IHH, and DHH), the HH receptor Patched
  (PTCH) keeps the pathway off (OFF) by inhibiting Smoothened (SMO), and keeping the
  glioma-associated oncogene (GLI) transcription factors in an inactive form (GLI-R).
  In the middle, binding of HH ligand to HH receptor, PTCH, turns the pathway on (ON),
  and inhibits its activity, relieving the repression of SMO, which converts full-length
  GLI (GLI-FL) into a transcriptional activator (GLI-A). In vertebrates, cilia are
  required for production of GLI-repressor (GLI-R) and/or GLI-activator (GLI-A). On
  the left, viruses hyperactivate HH signaling with multiple mechanisms (VIRUS MEDIATED).
