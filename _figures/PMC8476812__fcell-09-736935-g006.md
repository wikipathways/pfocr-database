caption: Molecular insights into EZH2-driven BC tumorigenesis. (A) In BC cells, EZH2
  expression is upregulated by several factors and loss of microRNAs. Upregulated
  EZH2 elevate the H3K27me3 and transcriptional repression of several TSGs, such as
  RUNX3, CDKN1B, CDKN1C, which promote the proliferation, invasion, migration, EMT,
  CSCs, drug resistance and inhibit apoptosis, immunogenicity and HR repair. EZH2
  promotes activation of oncogenes in a PRC2-independent manner, such as IL-6, CXCL-8,
  NOTCH1, MMP2/7, etc. EZH2 suppresses invasion, migration, EMT, and bone metastasis
  via inhibiting LOX, SNAIL, and SOX4. (B) EZH2 executes context-dependent activation
  which can be either dependent or independent on its methyltransferase activity.
  In ER-positive BC, ER recruits PRC2 complex to the promoter of NF-κB target genes
  (IL-6, IL-8) to inactivate transcription. In ER-negative basal-like BC, EZH2 acts
  as a co-activator of RelA and RelB to promote the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and
  IL-11 which in turn activates NF-κB signaling pathway through a positive feedback
  leading to constitutive activation of these genes and anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis,
  metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance. In TNBC, upon normoxia, PRC2 inactivates
  matrix metalloproteinase gene (MMPs) by catalyzing H3K27me3 at the promoter region.
  Upon hypoxia, HIF1-α inhibits PRC2 activation by repressing protein expression of
  SUZ12 and EED, leading to functional switching to EZH2/FOXM1-depedent induction
  of MMPs expression.
