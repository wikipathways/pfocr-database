caption: Hepatic ketogenesis and cardiac ketolysis. Free fatty acids in circulation
  are transported into the liver via a carrier protein-assisted transport pathway.
  These fatty acids undergo fatty acid oxidation in the hepatic mitochondria to produce
  acetyl-CoA, which after a series of enzymatic reactions produces ketone bodies,
  acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate. Ketones are transported to the heart and other
  extrahepatic organs via blood portal by the monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 1
  (MCT1/2). β-hydroxybutyrate is converted to acetoacetate by β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase
  1 (BDH1), one of the key enzymes for ketone utilization. Acetoacetate is activated
  to acetoacetyl-CoA by succinyl-CoA:3 ketoacid-CoA transferase (SCOT), the rate-limiting
  enzyme for ketolysis. Acetoacetyl-CoA undergoes a final thiolysis reaction to be
  separated into 2 molecules of acetyl-CoA. Adapted from Selvaraj et al. ().
