caption: BR inhibits ethylene synthesis by activating the transcription factors BZR1
  and BES1 to repress the transcription of ACSs under low levels. While high levels
  of BR induce ethylene biosynthesis either through increasing the stability to ACSs
  or influencing auxin signaling regulated ethylene. At the same time, BR inhibits
  the synthesis of O2- via the peroxidase pathway, but not NADPH oxidase pathway,
  which serves to regulate the growth of the A. thaliana seedling root.
