caption: Second generation RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib are BRAF-selective
  and cause paradoxical activation of ERK (panel (a)). The inhibitor-blocked BRAF
  forms a heterodimer with active CRAF and complexes with activated RAS. MEK inhibitors
  transiently block ERK activation. Since high ERK activation can be deleterious for
  cell proliferation, ERK activation stimulates negative feedback mechanisms that
  dampen upstream signaling through the pathway (panel (b)). Kinome reprogramming
  results in rewiring of the signaling networks to increase flux through non-RAF-MEK-ERK
  pathways such as PI3K-AKT-mTOR.
