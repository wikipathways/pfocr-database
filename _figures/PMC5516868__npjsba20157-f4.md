caption: The steady state of the Snf1 bBM under glucose deprivation is a point attractor.
  The end state of the bBM simulation under glucose-deprived conditions visualised
  on the regulatory graph of the updated network. The bBM was generated automatically
  based on the final network after validation, and the simulation initiated from the
  starting states defined in the Methods section. The pale nodes are inactive and
  the filled nodes are active. The Boolean model is attached in the BooleanNet and
  BoolNet formats as  and , respectively.
