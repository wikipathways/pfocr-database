caption: Figure 2. Canonical and non-canonical functions of STAT2 and IRF9 in the
  antiviral response. Cells respond to virus infection through the activation of multiple
  signaling pathways, leading to the activation of AP-1 (ATF-2/c-jun), NFκB and interferon
  regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). These transcription factors regulate the expression
  of various proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines and chemokines, including IFNβ
  and TNFα. Binding of IFNβ to its cognate receptor activates the “classical” antiviral
  pathway through activation of Tyk2 and JAK1 kinases ultimately leading to the formation
  of ISGF3. ISGF3 regulates the expression of multiple interferon stimulated genes
  (ISGs). Additionally, the synergism between IFNβ and TNFα induces late gene expression
  through a non-canonical antiviral STAT2- and IRF9-dependent, but STAT1-independent,
  pathway. This pathway is dependent on Tyk2 kinase activity and requires phosphorylation
  of STAT2 on Tyr690. This pathway triggers the delayed expression of an alternative
  ISG panel and, at least in airway epithelial cells, of the DUOX2/DUOXA2 genes encoding
  for a functional NADPH oxidase enzyme.
