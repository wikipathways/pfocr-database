caption: '(A) General hydroxamate siderophore synthesis pathway. L-ornithine is hydroxylated
  by SidA, followed by acetylation by SidL. The peptide is synthesized by peptide
  synthetase SidC, yielding, in this example, desferri-ferricrocin. (B) Chemical structures
  of key iron-chelating agents and related compounds: deferoxamine (also called desferrioxamine
  B), a trihydroxamic acid siderophore; deferiprone, a bidentate hydroxypyridinone
  chelator; deferasirox, a tridentate chelator; and protoporphyrin, a precursor in
  heme biosynthesis'
