caption: The signaling pathways of TLR4. MyD88-dependant signaling is common to most
  TLRs including TLRs 1,2,4 (shown) and 5,6,7,8,9,11 (not shown). TRIF-dependant signaling
  results from TLR4 and TLR3 activation only. Note that TLR3 resides in endosomal
  vesicles, shown here responding to engulfed foreign RNA. The pentagon shapes denotes
  proteins that interact through a TIR domain. The TRAM adaptor (lime green) is exclusive
  to TLR4 and coordinates the TRIF response through TLR4’s TIR domain. TRIF-dependant
  signaling primarily results in IFN-β production (red adaptors), but the TRIF pathway
  also induces “late stage” NF-κB activation through RIP 1 (white) and TRAF 6 (seafoam
  green). The MyD88-dependant cascade initiates “early stage” NF-κB activation through
  the IKKs (IKKs α,β,λ) and/or the MAPK pathway, leading to proinflammatory cytokine
  expression and subsequent amplification through additional immune pathways.
