caption: Cytosolic DNA‐sensing immune response via cGAS/STING. A schematic of the
  cytosolic DNA‐sensing immune response via the cGAS/STING pathway. Upon DNA virus
  infection, the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS directly recognizes viral DNA and catalyzes
  cGAMP, which utilizes cellular GTP/adenosine triphosphate, thereby triggering activation
  of the signal adaptor STING via direct interaction with cGAMP. cGAS may also recognize
  the transfected dsDNA or viral DNA that is produced by HIV‐1 through reverse‐transcription
  of viral RNA. Following the binding of cGAMP, STING is translocated from the ER
  to perinuclear‐Golgi and may form a signaling complex with kinase TBK1 (phosphorylation
  of STING at Serine[S]‐366 occurs here after translocation), thus inducing production
  of IRF3‐mediated type I IFNs. STING may also activate production of NF‐κB(p65)‐mediated
  pro‐inflammatory cytokines. cGAS may also recognize self‐DNAs, such as the released
  nucleosome and micronuclear DNA in the cytoplasm during DNA damage or cellular senescence,
  promoting STING‐dependent signal activation. Missense mutation of a number of cellular
  DNases may induce aberrant inflammatory responses via the cGAS/STING axis as a result
  of failure of self‐DNA digestion in necrotic or inappropriately apoptotic cells.
