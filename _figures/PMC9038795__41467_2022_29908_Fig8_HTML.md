caption: a Schematic diagram of divergence times in Apiales. The black points indicate
  the divergence-time nodes. b The pink and blue boxes represent the metabolites of
  Panax and A. elata, respectively. Genes involved in the alaroside biosynthetic pathway.
  The black arrow shows the cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene to β-amyrin catalyzed
  by BAS, the purple arrow shows the hydroxylation at the corresponding site catalyzed
  by P450, the blue arrow shows the glucuronosylation at the corresponding site by
  CSL, and the green arrows show the glycosylation reactions by the corresponding
  UGTs. The blank arrows indicate the pseudogenes in the tandem repeat that are not
  involved in the alaroside biosynthetic pathway. The compounds in dashed boxes represent
  the specific triterpenoids in Panax and A. elata. TTs tetracyclic triterpenoids,
  PTs pentacyclic triterpenoids.
