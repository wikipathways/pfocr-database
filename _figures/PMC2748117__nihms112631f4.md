caption: The de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate
  (PRPP) to AMP is shown. There are two folate-dependent reactions in which 10-formyl
  tetrahydrofolate serves as the one carbon donor, GARFTase and AICAR formyltransferase.
  AICA can be metabolized to AICAR thus circumventing the reaction catalyzed by GARFTase.
  For the in situ GARFTase assay, incorporation of [14C]glycine into formyl GAR (FGAR)
  in the presence of azaserine is used as a direct measure of GARFTase activity.
