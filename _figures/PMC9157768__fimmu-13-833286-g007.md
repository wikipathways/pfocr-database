caption: (A) Proposed model of RBC-EVs driven monocytes activation. (1) RBC-EVs enriched
  in heme are endocytosed by macrophages, triggering HO-1 expression, possibly culminating
  in Bach1 repression leading to Spic expression. (2) RBC-EVs release heme content
  near the plasma membrane of macrophages; free-heme crosses the membrane triggering
  HO-1 expression, probably culminating in Bach1 repression leading to Spic expression.
  (3) Heme contained in RBC-EVs membrane activates TLR4 directly, triggering intracellular
  ROS production, probably activating NF-kB. (4) RBC-EVs release heme content near
  the plasma membrane of macrophages; free-heme activates TLR4, triggering intracellular
  ROS production, activating NF-kB. (B) Simplified representative scheme for changes
  caused by blood storage. Blood storage leads to red cell insults, causing hemolysis
  and releasing heme, hemoglobin, and MPs into the bloodstream. Heme activates the
  expression of the Spic transcription factor, which signals the differentiation of
  monocytes/macrophages into an M2-like phenotype, expressing increased CD206 and
  CX3CR1 mRNA levels. Heme is degraded by HO-1 generating Fe (II), CO, and Biliverdin
  in the monocytes. Fe (II) is captured by ferritin, avoiding oxidations. Additionally,
  when in very high concentrations, heme seems to activate the NF-κB proinflammatory
  signaling pathway, increasing IL-6 mRNA levels. (This scheme does not represent
  the dimensions and sizes in your reality). Created with BioRender.com.
