caption: Model for the regulation of lifespan and innate immunity. The daf-2 (A) and
  germline (B) pathways both regulate lifespan and innate immunity in C. elegans.
  The effect of daf-2 on both lifespan and innate immunity depends on the DAF-16 transcription
  factor (A). Similarly, the effect of the germline on lifespan also requires daf-16.
  However, depending on the growth conditions of the pathogen and the nematodes, the
  effect of the germline on innate immunity may or may not depend on DAF-16 (B). The
  germline also acts in parallel to a p38 MAPK pathway to regulate innate immunity.
  This figure was originally published in Alper et al. “The Caenorhabditis elegans
  germ line regulates distinct signaling pathways to control lifespan and innate immunity.”
