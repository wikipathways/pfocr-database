caption: Relationship between AMPK signaling pathway and lipid metabolism in laying
  hen hepatocytes. The figure shows the ways and methods of activating the AMPK signaling
  pathway (indicated by the blue arrows). Activated AMPK may ameliorate hepatocytes
  steatosis by upregulating the mRNA levels of fatty acid oxidation–related genes
  such as CPT1 and PPARα and downregulating the mRNA levels of lipid synthesis-related
  genes such as SREBP1, ACC, FAS, HMGR, GPAT, and HNF4α (green arrows indicate promotion,
  red lines represent inhibition).
