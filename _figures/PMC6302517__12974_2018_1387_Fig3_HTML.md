caption: Schematic illustrating the role of cav-1 in different cell. In endothelial
  cells, after exposure to LPS, cav-1 interacts with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),
  and then TLR4 promotes activation of MyD88, leading to NF-κB activation and the
  generation of proinflammatory cytokines. Under normal condition, cav-1 inhibits
  eNOS. If eNOS is activated, NO will nitrate IRAK4 which is a signaling factor required
  for NF-κB activation. And cav-1 in microglia can induce the internalization of SVCT2
  which is the primary mediator of vitamin C uptake in neurons, triggering a proinflammatory
  phenotype in microglia and inducing microglia activation. Whereas in macrophages,
  cav-1decreases proinflammatory cytokine production and augments anti-inflammatory
  production through the TLR4/MKK3/p38 MAPK pathway. Besides, TLR4 activation by LPS
  also stimulates HO-1 transporting to the caveolae and producing CO which has anti-inflammatory
  effects and augments the cav-1/TLR4 interaction in murine macrophages. Toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR4), interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), heme oxygenase-1
  (HO-1), carbon oxide (CO), plasma membrane sodium-vitamin C cotransporter 2 (SVCT2)
