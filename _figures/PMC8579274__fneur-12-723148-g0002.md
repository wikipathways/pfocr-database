caption: Comparison of glucose metabolism in normal and TBI physiology. (1) A TBI
  triggers a transient increase in glucose uptake followed by a prolonged decrease
  in glucose metabolism. (2) Following a TBI, a larger portion of glucose-6-phosphate
  is shunted to the Pentose Phosphate Pathway to generate protective and reparative
  molecules. (3) Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is slowed, decreasing tricarboxylic
  acid cycle intermediates. (4) Lactate production increases in astrocytes so that
  lactate can be shuttled to energy-deficit neurons. (5) The pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex is inhibited, decreasing tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. (6) The
  function of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation is impaired,
  resulting in less ATP production. GADPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
