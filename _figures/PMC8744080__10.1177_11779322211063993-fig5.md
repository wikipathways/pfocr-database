caption: In ClueGO, metabolic pathways were predicted from KEGG as a network with
  the terms of the enriched pathways visualized using Cytoscape’s ClueGo/CluePedia
  plugin where several proteins share common functions. The size of the nodes corresponds
  to the importance of the metabolic pathway.
