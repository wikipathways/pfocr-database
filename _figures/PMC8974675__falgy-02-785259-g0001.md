caption: Possible mechanisms involved in the appearance of the converter phenotype.
  1 Interleukins released after antigen presentation and lymphocyte differentiation
  to CD4+ Th1 and Th2 may be related to the occurrence of non-immediate reactions.
  2 Th1 polarization. 3 Th2 polarization. 4 The pathway by which macrophages and monocytes
  are activated in cytokine release reactions is not entirely clear. On the one hand,
  it could be a non-predominant activation of Th1 that would allow these cells to
  discharge a large amount of cytokines responsible for the symptoms and, on the other
  hand, mast cells would establish a bridge with these and other cells of the innate
  immune system by releasing more cytokines that would amplify the immune response
  and contribute to symptoms.
