caption: 'Crosstalk between dormant cancer cells and immune components. The mechanism
  and effect of tumor-associated macrophage, tumor-associated neutrophil, NK cells,
  and T cells on dormancy varies. (1) Crosstalk with Macrophage: CCL2 and CCL5 in
  TME recruit macrophages and polarize them into tumor-permissive M2 TAM, leading
  to dormancy awakening via upon TNF-α/NF-κB axis. (2) Crosstalk with TAN: TANs have
  been revealed to release neutrophil extracellular trap to activate dormant cancer
  cells into proliferation state either through integrin α3β1 receptor or CCDC25.
  (3) Crosstalk with NK cell: NK cell-secreted perforin and IFN-γ restrain cancer
  cells in dormant state; DKK1-expressing dormant cancer cells adopt similar strategies
  as CSCs to attenuate NKG2D expression to escape killing. (4) Crosstalk with T cell:
  T-cell-mediated dormancy induction is predominantly achieved via IFN-γ secretion
  and the downstream IDO-Kyn-AhR-p27 axis. Abbreviations: CCDC25, coiled-coil domain
  containing 25; DKK1, dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MLCK, myosin light-chain kinase;
  YAP, Yes1-associated transcriptional regulator; ILK, integrin linked kinase; IDO,
  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; Kyn, kynurenines; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptors;
  NE, neutrophil elastin; MMP9, matrix metalloproteinase-9.'
