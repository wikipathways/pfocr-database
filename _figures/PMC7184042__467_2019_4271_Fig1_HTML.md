caption: a Remodelling of bone is controlled by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Bone
  formation happens through organic matrix formation (osteoid), that gets mineralised
  to form bone, and finally undergoes remodelling by resorption and reformation. Calcium
  and phosphate form hydroxyapatite that deposits in the extracellular compartment,
  between collagen fibres. Osteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption, removing
  bone minerals and matrix. Certain biochemical markers reflect bone turnover and
  bone cell activity. Bone regulators can be grouped broadly into bone turnover factors
  (e.g. PTH, sclerostin) and bone cell activity indicators (bone formation, e.g. bone-specific
  alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), osteocalcin (OC), procollagen type I N propeptide (PINP),
  procollagen type I C propeptide (PICP); bone resorption, e.g. carboxyterminal cross-linking
  telopeptide of bone collagen (CTX), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5b)).
  b Bone resorption is activated by the RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway, which regulates osteoclast
  differentiation and activation. Osteoclast precursors express RANK, which is activated
  by its ligand, RANKL, produced by osteoblasts and osteocytes. Osteoprotegerin (OPG),
  also a product of osteoblasts and osteocytes, is a decoy receptor for RANKL, neutralising
  the osteoclastic function activated by the RANKL-RANK complex. Thus, the RANKL/OPG
  ratio is an important determinant of bone mass as it affects mineralisation, alkaline
  phosphatase, Runx2 and osteocalcin which reflect osteoblast differentiation and
  bone formation rate. Figure adapted from Charoenphandhu et al. []

  description: a Remodelling of bone is controlled by osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
    Bone formation happens through organic matrix formation (osteoid), that gets mineralised
    to form bone, and finally undergoes remodelling by resorption and reformation.
    Calcium and phosphate form hydroxyapatite that deposits in the extracellular compartment,
    between collagen fibres. Osteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption, removing
    bone minerals and matrix. Certain biochemical markers reflect bone turnover and
    bone cell activity. Bone regulators can be grouped broadly into bone turnover
    factors (e.g. PTH, sclerostin) and bone cell activity indicators (bone formation,
    e.g. bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), osteocalcin (OC), procollagen
    type I N propeptide (PINP), procollagen type I C propeptide (PICP); bone resorption,
    e.g. carboxyterminal cross-linking telopeptide of bone collagen (CTX), tartrate-resistant
    acid phosphatase (TRAP5b)). b Bone resorption is activated by the RANK-RANKL-OPG
    pathway, which regulates osteoclast differentiation and activation. Osteoclast
    precursors express RANK, which is activated by its ligand, RANKL, produced by
