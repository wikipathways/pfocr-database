caption: Simplified overview of the plant fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. The first
  step of fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis in the plastid is the conversion of Acetyl‐coenzyme
  A (CoA) to malonyl‐CoA by acteyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACCase) which is then further
  converted to malonyl acyl‐carrier protein (ACP) by malonyl coenzyme A:acyl carrier
  protein transacylase (MCAMT). From there, fatty acid synthase (FASII complex, a
  multi‐enzyme complex made up of several fatty acid biosynthesis genes) catalyzes
  several elongation steps to produce 16:0‐ACP. Ketoacyl‐synthase II (KASII, often
  considered a component of the FAS complex) further elongates 16:0‐ACP into 18:0‐ACP.
  SAD then removes the first double bond from these molecules to form a 16:1‐ACP and
  18:1‐ACP (SAD exhibits a strong substrate preference for 18:0‐ACP over 16:0‐ACP).
  FatB and FatA remove the acyl‐carrier protein to form palmitic, stearic, and oleic
  acid. Long‐chain acyl‐CoA synthetase (LACS) converts free FAs into acyl‐CoAs which
  are then transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum where lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase (LPCAT) removes the CoA and replaces it with phosphatidylcholine
  (PC). FAD2 then desaturates 18:1‐PC into 18:2‐PC before FAD3 further desaturates
  that into 18:3‐PC. Those polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)‐PC molecules are then
  converted into PUFA‐CoA by the combined activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and
  LACS4/9 before finally being converted into linoleic and alpha‐linoleic acid. PUFA‐PC,
  PUFA‐CoA, and free PUFAs in the ER can all be used to produce other lipid‐based
  molecules. Oleic acid can also be converted into linoleic and alpha‐linoleic acid
  in the plastid through the activity of FAD6 and FAD7/8 respectively, but this is
  not the primary pathway for FA desaturation (Bates et al., ; Jung et al., ; Ohlrogge
  et al., ).
