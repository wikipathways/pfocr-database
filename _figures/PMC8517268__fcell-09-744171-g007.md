caption: A model of METTL3/14 target MNK2 via m6A modification and then modulate ERK
  signaling pathway during skeletal muscle differentiation and regeneration. Tissue
  renewal and muscle regeneration largely rely on the activation and proliferation
  of muscular satellite cells, the expression of METTL3 and METTL14 is increased on
  the early stage of regeneration after injury, then promotes MNK2 expression and
  favors to accelerate regeneration. In differentiating myoblasts, m6A modification
  and core methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 are down-regulated, METTL3/14 target
  MNK2 directly then regulate ERK signaling to block myogenesis, so decreased expression
  of METTL3/14 is essential for skeletal muscle differentiation. Additionally, the
  m6A modified Mnk2 is recognized by YTHDF1.
