caption: 'The TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. (A) Ligand binding: A heteromeric complex
  is formed with an interaction of type II, type I receptors, and TGF-β ligands. (B)
  Activation of receptor: Ligand binding stimulates the type II receptor to phosphorylate
  and activate the type I receptor. (C) Activation of R-SMADs: Once the type I receptor
  is activated, it initiates phosphorylation and activation of the receptor-activated
  SMADs (R-SMADs, SMAD2, and SMAD3 for TGF-β signal). (D) Inhibition of R-SMAD activation:
  Inhibitory SMADs, SMAD7, and SMAD6 compete with R-SMADs to intervene with the type
  I receptor. As a result, R-SMAD activation and transmission of the SMAD signaling
  is prevented. (E) The complex of R-SMADs and CO-SMAD formation: Activated R-SMADs
  dissociate from type I receptors to form a complex with the common mediator, CO-SMAD,
  SMAD4. (F) The complex of R-SMAD and SMAD4 can translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus
  and bind to transcription factors, resulting in the transcription of target genes.
  Here, SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8 are shown for BMP signal. Adapted from Molecular Biology
