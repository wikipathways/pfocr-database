caption: 'Schematic representation of insulin signaling pathway with highlighted proteins
  found to be altered in DS brain.Under physiological conditions, binding of insulin
  to the insulin receptor (IR) leads to IR autophosphorylation on Tyr residues (e.g.,
  Tyr1158/1162/1163), which regulate IR activation. In turn, once activated, IR promotes
  the phosphorylation of its substrate (insulin receptor substrate-1, IRS1) on specific
  Tyr residues (e.g., 632). This event drives the activation of the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase/Akt (PI3K-Akt) pathways downstream from IRS1. Akt promotes the phosphorylation
  of several targets, among which are: (1) Akt substrate of 160 (AS160) (on Thr642,
  activating site) that together with the atypical protein kinase C zeta (PKC), are
  responsible for the translocation of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4)-containing vesicles
  to the plasma membrane to mediate glucose uptake; (2) Hexokinase-II (HKII) a rate-limiting
  enzyme involved in glucose metabolism and mitochondrial functions; (3) Glycogen
  synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3) (on Ser9, inhibitory site), which has a role in energy
  production; and (4) the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (on Ser2448, activating
  site), which regulates protein synthesis and autophagy. Under pathological conditions,
  IRS1 can be phosphorylated on Ser residues (e.g., Ser307 and Ser636) and this event
  is responsible for the uncoupling between IR and IRS1. This molecular event is at
  the base of the insulin resistance phenomenon and means that even if insulin can
  bind to IR, this latter is not able to promote IRS1 activation. Hence, pathways
  downstream from IRS1 cannot be activated in response to insulin. Brain insulin resistance
  is further associated with an impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics. Mitochondrial
  failure leads to increased oxidative stress as well as favors the amyloid precursor
  protein (APP) amyloidogenic cleavage, responsible for APP C-terminal fragment 99
  (APP-C99) and eventually beta amyloid (Aβ) accumulation. Increased production of
  APP-C99 and Aβ can be sustained by the hyperactivation of mTOR, which inhibits autophagy.
  Finally, among the proteins known to regulate insulin signalling both biliverdin
  reductase-A (BVR-A) and NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin (Sirt1) are known to favor
  the correct activation of IRS1 and thus the consequent activation of the insulin
  signalling pathway. Dotted arrows: decreased activity in young Down syndrome (DS);
  plain arrows/lines: increased activity in DS; red arrows highlight proteins/pathways
  upregulated or downregulated in DS brain and Ts65dn mice.'
