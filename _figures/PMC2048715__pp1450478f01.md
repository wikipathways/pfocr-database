caption: 'The Arabidopsis flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. The Arabidopsis mutants
  in the early part of the pathway are bracketed. The mutants used in these experiments
  are in bold type. The insets show the chemical structures of N (a flavanone) and
  Q (a flavonol). Enzyme abbreviations: CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; F3H, flavonol 3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase.
