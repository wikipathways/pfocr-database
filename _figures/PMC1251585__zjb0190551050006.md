caption: Model of the Rcs signaling pathway. The schematic diagram is not to scale
  but shows the signaling flow through the Rcs cascade. Question marks indicate experimentally
  unresolved issues. RcsF localization to the outer membrane is according to in silico
  predictions based on the amino acid sequence and A. Jacq (personal communication;
  see Discussion). Amino acids involved in the phosphorelay are indicated. The shaded
  areas of RcsA and RcsB indicate the DNA-binding domains of these proteins. A dashed
  arrow points to genes that are RcsB dependent but RcsA independent. A blocked line
  indicates a gene repressed by an RcsA-RcsB heterodimer, and a solid arrow points
  to genes that require RcsA and RcsB for activation (see the text for details).
