caption: Possible circuit level mechanisms for expression of extinction versus context-induced
  reinstatement. When rats are tested in the extinction context, alcoholic beer seeking
  is inhibited but when tested in the training context, alcoholic beer seeking is
  reinstated. Extinction expression is associated with activated projections from
  ilPFC to MDH. Activation of this pathway is proposed to inhibit alcoholic beer seeking
  via two pathways. First, prodynorphin projections from MDH to PVT are recruited
  during test in the extinction context, and signaling via PVT KORs may reduce glutamatergic
  PVT output to plPFC, BLA, and accumbens shell (Shell). Second, projections from
  shell to LH are also recruited when rats are returned to the extinction context
  (). MDH may also modulate shell via direct projections as indicated; however, the
  functional significance of this pathway remains to be shown.
