caption: Hedgehog signaling pathwayPTCH1 inhibits SMO in the absence of HH signaling
  ligand; when ligand is present, it binds to the transmembrane protein PTCH1, and
  the membrane spanning receptor SMO rescinds the PTCH1-mediated inhibition, leading
  to activation of the Gli transcription factor and entry into the nucleus to stimulate
  cell division and tumorigenesis. Several HPIs, such as vismodegib and sonidegib,
  bind SMO and inhibit reactivation of the HH pathway, available for cancer therapy.
