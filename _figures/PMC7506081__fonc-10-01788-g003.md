caption: Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBPs) is involved in the activation
  of M1-type macrophages. M1 macrophages use glycolysis as the main way of energy
  supply. The tricarboxylic acid cycle is disrupted in M1 macrophages, leading to
  the accumulation of citrate and succinate. Succinate can activate HIF1α, which in
  turn leads to the release of proinflammatory factors. LPS induces the activation
  of NF-κB through TLR4 dependent and independent pathways. Activation of NF-κB induces
  the expression of SREBPs, promoting lipid synthesis and accumulation. ACLY, as a
  downstream gene of SREBP, participates in lipid synthesis and drives the release
  of ROS, NO, PGE2. SREBPs also activate Nlrp1a and Nlrp1c, which lead to the release
  of proinflammatory factors.
