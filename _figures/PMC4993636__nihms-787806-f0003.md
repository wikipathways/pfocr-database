caption: Hippo activation appears to require the participation of multiple scaffolds
  that assemble multi-protein complexes. A) In Drosophila, both Sav and Ex can interact
  with both Hpo and Wts. B) Ex is partially redundant with Merlin and Kibra (depending
  upon the tissue), which can interact with Wts and Sav. C) In mammals, Merlin (NF2)
  and Motins play key roles in Hippo pathway activation. Merlin and Kibra can each
  interact with SAV1 and LATS, and Motins can interact with LATS, Merlin, and Kibra.
