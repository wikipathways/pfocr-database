caption: Possible origin of the TIF-pathway branch in the current Drosophila sex-determination
  regulatory gene pathway from a time when tra was the master autoregulating sex-determination
  gene with Sxl under its sex-specific control. (A) It is proposed that an early step
  in the switch from tra to Sxl as the positively autoregulating target of the female
  sex-determination signal was the acquisition by Sxl of a gene target with a female-specific
  function, with Sxl then becoming a regulatory target of tra. (B) Siera and Cline
  () suggested that redundancy in positive feedbacks involving tra and Sxl might have
  led to the present-day regulatory arrangement with tra downstream rather than upstream
  of Sxl. After the switch from A to B, female-specific targets of Sxl that originally
  were part of the TSF pathway would stand out as part of a TIF pathway. (C) Redrawing
  of B that presents the same regulatory relationships in a more conventional way.

  description: Possible origin of the TIF-pathway branch in the current Drosophila
    sex-determination regulatory gene pathway from a time when tra was the master

    autoregulating target of the female sex-determination signal was the acquisition
    by Sxl of a gene target with a female-specific function, with Sxl then becoming
