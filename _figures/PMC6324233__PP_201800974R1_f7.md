caption: Potential relationships among nine candidate genes (plus ga20ox) and their
  functions in inflorescence development. Kn1 is a key regulator of floral transition
  (; ) that is essential for meristem maintenance and is involved in the initiation
  of spikelet and floral meristems in rice and maize (; ). Analyses of maize mutants
  demonstrate that Kn1 regulates the cytokinin (CK) pathway, perhaps via interactions
  with Td1, a suppressor of the WUS gene (; ). Kn1 also participates in regulating
  GA levels in the SAM through ga20ox and various KNOTTED1-like homeobox proteins
  (). In sorghum, the expression of Kn1 is strongly correlated with DCL-3, which is
  involved in the production of 24-nucleotide siRNAs that target genes (e.g. ga20ox)
  involved in homeostasis of the GA and brassinosteroid pathways to alter branch meristems
  in rice (). In addition, GWAS on panicle area identified one WUS-related homeobox
  transcription factor, DWT1, which in rice is associated with GA signaling, participates
  in panicle meristem elongation, and is potentially downstream of ga20ox (). In maize,
  tsh4 regulates the establishment of lateral meristem boundaries followed by meristem
  initiation and is regulated via the expression of Kn1 and Bd1 (). In rice and maize,
  Kn1 participates in spikelet meristem initiation and floral meristem initiation,
  which are positively regulated by Bd1 and MADS3 (; ; ).
