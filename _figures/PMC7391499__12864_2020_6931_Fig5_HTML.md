caption: Lignin biosynthesis pathway and monolignol biosynthesis related gene expression
  in P. armeniacum. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol
  dehydrogenase; C3H, 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate
  hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; CSE, caffeoyl shikimate esterase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA
  3-O-methyltransferase; COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; F5H, ferulate-5-hydroxylase;
  CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; POX/LAC, peroxidases/laccase. Gene expression
  was scaled using the Z-score of FPKM (mean value of three biological replicates)
  in the heatmap. For each heatmap, the key is located at right side with FPKM values
  increasing from green to red
