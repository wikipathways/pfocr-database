caption: (A) Interplay between VEGF and Notch signaling is important for tip and stalk
  cell differentiation in physiological angiogenesis. The tip cell is characterized
  by high VEGF and low Notch levels, inducing sprouting. The stalk cell expresses
  low VEGF and high Notch, leading to activation of B catenin that stabilizes junctions
  and enables mural cell recruitment (Gavard and Gutkind, ; Reis et al., ). High Notch
  signaling also enables polarization of the stalk cell, a process important for lumenization
  (Phng et al., ); (B) The balance between VEGF and Notch signaling is lost in tumor
  endothelium. High VEGF and low Notch makes the tumor endothelium invasive and unstable.
  Loss of Notch downregulates Wnt canonical and non-canonical pathway, disrupting
  junctional integrity and vessel coverage (Fan et al., ; Chatterjee et al., ). High
  VEGF promotes sprouting and formation of podosomes at the basal side of the cell,
  a structure important for degradation of the extracellular matrix and cell motility
  (Seano et al., ).
