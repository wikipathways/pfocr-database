caption: S1P plays an essential role in bone turnover and osteoporosis. One of the
  early signs of osteoporosis is obstacles to bone turnover, and the whole process
  of bone turnover can be divided into four stages. In the first stage, OCPs and OBPs
  recruit to bone marrow via S1PR2 signal pathway (these cells are mobilized into
  blood through S1PR1 signalling). And osteoclastic cell‐secreted S1P can stimulate
  the differentiation of osteoblasts. In the second stage, RANKL, cooperating with
  S1P, acts as a coupling factor for osteoclast‐osteoblast crosstalk, which facilitates
  bone turnover and maintains bone haemostasis. The differentiation of osteoblasts
  and the expression of RANKL are induced by S1P (released from osteoclastic cells),
  while the dissolution of bone matrix will release TGF‐β. In the third stage, the
  rapid proliferation of osteoblasts (induced by S1P in an autocrine manner) and the
  apoptosis of osteoclasts lead to the increase of OB/OC ratio, which eventually refill
  the dissolved bone matrix. In the last stage, the formation of new bone is complete
  and bone turnover will resume from the first stage
