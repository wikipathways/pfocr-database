caption: Deuterium label flow through glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Using [6,60 −2H2]-glucose
  as metabolic substrate results in 2H label transfer, via the glycolytic pathway,
  to the methyl groups of pyruvate, lactate and acetyl-CoA. Several glycolytic conversion
  and exchange reactions (see text for details) lead to loss of 2H label to the large,
  non-specific water pool, resulting in a non-stoichiometric relation between 2H-labeled
  substrate and product (i.e., 0 < x < 2). Following entry into the TCA cycle additional
  2H label loss occurs after which the 2H label ends up in the H4/40 position of glutamate
  and glutamine and the H2/H20 position of GABA (0 < y < x). Continuing down the TCA
  cycle will lead to complete 2H label loss (see also ). The substrate [2H3]-acetate
  enters the metabolic pathways at the level of acetyl-CoA, thus bypassing glycolysis
  and the associated 2H label losses. Note that the amount of 2H label, y, in downstream
  products is generally not the same when using [6,60 −2H2]-glucose or [2H3]-acetate
  as substrate.
