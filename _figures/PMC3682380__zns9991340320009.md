caption: A model for the role of APPL-Goα signaling in the control of neuronal migration
  within the developing ENS. Transmembrane APPL is expressed in the motile processes
  of migrating EP cells, where it colocalizes with Goα. When exploratory filopodia
  extend off the band pathway (b) onto the adjacent interband regions (ib), they encounter
  ligands (as yet unidentified; black octagons) that induce APPL-dependent activation
  of Goα. In turn, local activation of Goα within the leading process induces Ca2+
  influx via voltage-independent channels (), resulting in filopodial retraction,
  thereby restricting inappropriate outgrowth and migration into these regions.
