caption: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transduces extracellular signals
  by activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which in turn facilitates the conversion
  of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3). Presence of PIP3 ultimately results in cell survival and proliferation via
  several downstream mediators, notably the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR).
  EGFR can also activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3),
  which is a transcription factor for genes involved in cell survival and proliferation.
  Monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics include cetuximab, panitumumab, nimotuzumab,
  zalutumumab, Sym004, ABBV-221, and imgatuzumab, which all target the EGFR extracellular
  domain. Erlotinib, gefitinib, dacomitinib, and afatinib are small molecule tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors that are directed toward the EGFR intracellular domain. PI3K is
  targeted by small molecules that include buparlisib, SF1126, alpelisib, INCB050465,
  copanlisib, and IPI-549. Sirolimus, everolimus, and temsirolimus are related compounds
  that inhibit mTOR. In addition to small molecule inhibition, therapeutic oligonucleotide
  decoys can bind to STAT3, and antisense oligonucleotides like AZD9150 can silence
  STAT3 mRNA.
