caption: A PIM1 activates AKT signaling in ovarian cancer. PIM kinases are responsible
  for the activation of mTOR and its upstream effectors, such as AKT. The activation
  of both PIM1 and AKT contributes to the proliferation of OC cells by inhibiting
  apoptosis (through the phosphorylation of BAD) and preventing cell cycle arrest
  by hindering the nuclear translocation of p53 and p27. Additionally, PIM1 plays
  a crucial role in regulating OC metabolism. It phosphorylates c-Myc at S62 and controls
  aerobic glycolysis by upregulating several key glycolytic genes, ultimately leading
  to tumor growth and metastasis. Green and red arrows represent activating and inactivating
  pathways, respectively. B miR-33a directly targets PIM1 in gastric cancer cells.
  In gastric cancer tissues, the downregulation of miR‑33a correlated with the upregulation
  of CDK‑6, CCND1, and PIM1, leading to the suppression of gastric cancer cell growth
  by inducing G1 phase arrest. C PIM1 signaling in glioblastoma. EGFR is involved
  in promoting PIM1 expression in GBM cells. The regulatory mechanisms of PIM1 may
  vary depending on whether EGFR is wild-type or mutant. EGFRwt mainly activates MAP/ERK
  kinase (MEK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling, whereas
  EGFRvIII triggers both the MEK and the PI3K-Akt1 cascade. As a result, it is conceivable
  that PIM1 is more highly expressed in GBM with EGFRvIII due to the combined stimulation
  of PIM1 expression by MEK/ERK and PI3K-Akt1 pathways. Green and red arrows represent
  activating and inactivating pathways, respectively
