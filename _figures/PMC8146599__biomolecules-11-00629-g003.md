caption: Chromosome instability in cancer and inflammatory responses. (A) Pro-inflammatory
  cytokines activate the IKKα/Nucleophosmin (NPM) hexamer formation and centrosome
  interplay in mouse and human cells []. IKKα activation and increased NPM levels
  (red) allow NPM-Centrosome interaction, which allows the maintenance of normal centrosome
  number and genome integrity. Right, IKKα or NPM loss (green), decreases the levels
  of NPM hexamers and the association of NPM with centrosomes, thereby promoting centrosome
  amplification and genome changes that predispose to cancer []. (B) Exposure to LPS
  induces the axis MLK-p38-JNK which is critical for interphase centrosome maturation
  and secretion of inflammatory cytokines by immune and non-immune cells. (C) Centrosome
  amplification facilitates the release of proinvasive factors (ECASP) to induce non-cell-autonomous
  invasion. Although it remains undetermined how the additional centrosomes promote
  the ECASP, it is dependent on elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in cells
  with amplified centrosomes. The release of proinvasive factors is required for invadopodia
  formation in cells with normal centrosomes. Chronic NF-κB activation mediates the
  ECASP through the regulation of proteins, including IL-8, to shape the immunosuppressive
  microenvironment. (D) Loss of centrosome integrity activates p38-p53-p21 pathway
  resulting in cell-cycle arrest or senescence acting as a cell-cycle checkpoint pathway.
  In cancer cells, centrosome dysfunction leads to the generation of cytosolic dsDNA,
  which in turn, activates the cGAS–STING and alternative inflammatory pathways such
  as NF-κB signaling leading to ECASP. Centrosome abnormalities in cooperation with
  p38 and p53 dysfunction can also lead aneuploidy tolerance and adaptation to hypoxia.
