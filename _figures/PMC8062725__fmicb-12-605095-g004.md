caption: Predicted reactions of the overexpressed genes in the general metabolic pathway
  for FFA production in the ΔfaaA strain. The 16 genes that were subjected to overexpression
  modification in addition to faaA disruption were designated with numbers from 1
  to 16. These numbers are overlaid on the metabolic pathway map and marked by a corresponding
  color to indicate the FFA secretory productivity change as a ratio compared to the
  ΔfaaA strain. Increasing FFA secretory productivity is shown by the color of the
  gene number, shifting from yellow to red. The degree is based on the color key in
  the top right of the figure.
