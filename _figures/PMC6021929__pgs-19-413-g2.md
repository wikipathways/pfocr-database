caption: 'The same lithium pathway discovered by both manual and pharmacoepigenomics
  informatics pipeline (PIP) experiments. The ten genes discovered by both experiments
  (ANK3, ARNTL, CACNG2, CACNA1C, CDKN1A, CREB1, GRIA2, GSK3B, NR1D1, SLC1A2) are in
  red; two genes (HTR1A, TNIK) discovered by the PIP experiment only are in purple.
  The PIP discovers 78 candidate variants including 61 not discovered in the original
  lithium experiment. Gene classes and relationship types are designated with line
  types and gene glyphs as shown in the legend and described in the IPA® documentation
  [].IPA®: Ingenuity®Pathway Analysis.'
