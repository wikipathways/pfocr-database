caption: 'Role of DUBs in the Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo pathways in urologic cancers.
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway: The Wnt ligand is a glycoprotein that forms a complex by
  binding to the Frizzled receptor and LRP5/6. ZNRF3 and RNF43 ubiquitinate Frizzled
  receptors, whereas Respondin inhibits their activity and enhances the sensitivity
  of cells to Wnt. Upon Wnt activation, GSK-3β dissociates from the APC/axin/GSK-3β
  complex. In the absence of Wnt, β-catenin acts as a cell adhesion protein and transcriptional
  co-regulatory molecule that is degraded by β-TrCP/c after phosphorylation by CK1
  and the APC/Axin/GSK-3β complex. In the presence of Wnt, LRP5/6 forms a complex
  with Frizzled to activate DVL, leading to the displacement of GSK-3β from APC/Axin.
  Stable β-catenin translocates into the nucleus, binds to LEF/TCF transcription factors
  and activates target gene transcription. USP34 promotes activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway, but the specific mechanism has not yet been reported. Hippo pathway: Under
  normal circumstances, protein kinases such as MST1/2 and LATS1/2 exert inhibitory
  effects on the activity of YAP and TAZ in cells through phosphorylation, leading
  to their downregulation or absence. The upregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway
  promotes the activation of LATS kinase, which regulates gene expression by suppressing
  the activities of the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ. When Hippo signaling
  is attenuated or molecules upstream of the pathway are mutated, the enhanced expression
  of YAP and TAZ facilitates uncontrolled cell proliferation. The CYLD protein can
  inhibit the ubiquitination of YAP and activate the expression of downstream ferroptosis-related
  factors ACSL4 and TFRC, thereby inhibiting the progression of PCa by promoting ferroptosis.
