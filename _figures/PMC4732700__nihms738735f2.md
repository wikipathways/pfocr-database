caption: 'A: The EGFR-dependent signaling pathway. The receptor-specific ligand binds
  to the extracellular domain of the single-chain EGFR or EGFR-related receptors such
  as HER2. Then, the ligand-bound EGFR forms activated homodimers or heterodimers
  leading to ATP-dependent phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on the in-tracellular
  domain. This phosphorylation triggers downstream signaling to the cytoplasm and
  then nucleus. The two major pathways activated by EGFR are (1) the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK
  pathway that regulates gene transcription, cell-cycle progression from the G1 to
  the S phase, and cell proliferation, and (2) the PI3K-Akt pathway that activates
  a cascade of anti-apoptotic and prosurvival signals. B: Monoclonal antibodies bind
  to the extracellular domain of EGFR or EGFR-like receptor and block ligand binding,
  receptor activation, and downstream signaling. C: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors compete
  with ATP binding sites on the intracellular tyrosine kinase catalytic domain blocking
  phosphorylation and subsequent downstream effects. mAb = monoclonal antibody; EGFR
  = epidermal growth factor receptor; HER2 =human epidermal growth factor receptor
  2; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor;
  PI3K = phosphatidylinositol 3,45-kinase.'
