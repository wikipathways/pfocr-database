caption: Overview of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. (A) In the absence of Wnt ligands, a
  degradation complex composed of the kinases, GSK3β, and CK1α, and the scaffolding
  proteins APC and Axin, is formed. Phosphorylated β-catenin is targeted for proteasomal
  degradation after ubiquitination by β-TrCP. (B) Wnt ligands bind to the Frizzled/Lrp5/6
  receptors, leading to the phosphorylation of Dvl. Dvl recruits Axin and GSK3β, inhibiting
  the interaction with other components of the degradation complex. Then, β-catenin
  accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts
  with transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family and co-activators such as CBP and
  P300, promoting the transcription of Wnt target genes.
