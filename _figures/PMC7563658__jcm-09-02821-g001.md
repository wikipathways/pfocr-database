caption: Canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor κ (kappa)-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB) signalling pathways. The canonical NF-κB pathway starts
  with the activation of innate and adaptive immune receptors in response to various
  ligand molecules, which transfers the signal across the cell membrane causing the
  activation of the trimeric IκB kinase (IKK) complex, composed of catalytic (IKKα
  and IKKβ) and regulatory (IKKγ) subunits. The IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα and
  phosphorylated IκB undergo ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, allowing
  nuclear translocation of the RelA/p50 dimer of the NF-κB heterodimer. The non-canonical
  NF-κB pathway selectively responds to a subset of TNFR members that induce the activation
  of the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). NIK phosphorylates and activates IKKα, which
  in turn phosphorylates carboxy-terminal serine residues of p100, triggering selective
  degradation of the C-terminal IκB-like structure of p100, and mediates the persistent
  activation of the RelB/p52 complex.
