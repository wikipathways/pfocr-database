caption: Divergent pathways responsible for cerebral hypoperfusion in dementia. Our
  observations on human post-mortem brain tissue suggest that (A) in AD, cerebral
  hypoperfusion is mediated in part by elevated ECE-1/-2 and ACE in the cerebral cortex
  in AD in response to accumulating Aβ, whereas (B) in DLB, cerebral hypoperfusion
  is mediated by reduced vessel density in association with a reduction in VEGF expression,
  possibly in response to α-syn accumulation mediated by ischemia. In each pathway
  a vicious cycle ensues that accelerates disease progression.
