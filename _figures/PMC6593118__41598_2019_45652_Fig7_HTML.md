caption: Effect of nitrite on the metabolic pathways of MTB. Nitrite affects the metabolic
  pathways of MTB. Nitrite treatment given for one (), three (), and six () days alters
  the metabolic pathways, which is shown in the figure. The figure shows the upregulation
  and downregulation of genes involved in the marked pathway.
