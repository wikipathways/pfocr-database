caption: (A) In cyst cells of wild-type testes, E(Pc) represses CySC-enriched factors
  (for example Zfh-1, Yan) and JAK-STAT signaling pathway to promote cyst cell differentiation
  cell-autonomously. E(Pc) also acts in synergy with the EGF signaling pathway. Under
  this condition, both cyst cell and germ cell differentiate properly. (B) When E(Pc)
  is knocked down in cyst cells, ectopic expression of Zfh-1 and Yan, as well as hyperactivation
  of the JAK-STAT signaling but compromised EGF signaling activity lead to germ cell
  tumors including both GSC- or GB-like tumor and spermatogonial tumor. In addition,
  the excess germ cells turn on early-stage cyst cell markers.
