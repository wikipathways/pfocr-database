caption: Cytokine signaling and activation of TNFR and TLR is propagated through adaptor
  molecules such as TRADD, TRAFF, IRAK and MyD88 leading to phosphorylation and activation
  of the IKK kinase complex. The IKK complex phosphorylates the NFκB Inhibitory protein
  IκB which promotes polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. NFκB will subsequently
  translocate to the nucleus and bind its DNA response elements known as κB sites,
  thus leading to mRNA expression of target genes. Anti-Inflammatory therapeutic interventions
  in SCD that inhibit the phosphorylation of IκB have proven efficacious at inhibiting
  NFκB activation. (TRAFF, TNF receptor-associated factor 1; TRADD, Tumor necrosis
  factor receptor type 1-associated DEATH domain protein; IRAK, Interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1; MyD88, Myeloid differentiation primary response protein).
