caption: 'A comprehensive scheme for the complex regulation of cardiac non-selective
  autophagy in HFD-induced metabolic cardiomyopathy. LT-HFD (long-term high-fat diet)
  consumption not only activates the mTOR signaling pathway but also suppresses the
  AMPK signaling pathway in the heart, which impairs the initiation of phagophore
  nucleation. Vesicle expansion and autophagosome formation guided by ATG5-ATG12 and
  ATG7-LC3 was inhibited in HFD-induced metabolic cardiomyopathy. Metabolism-related
  enzymes included aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) and NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) are involved
  in the regulation of autophagy in metabolic cardiomyopathy. Short-term high-fat
  diet (ST-HFD) consumption prior to I/R promoted autophagy by the NF-kB-dependent
  signaling pathway. Otherwise, autophagy was activated by ST-HFD consumption in mouse
  hearts by inactivation of Mst1. Solid lines represent proven mechanisms, dotted
  lines represent unknown mechanisms. Targeted agents enclosed in yellow oval boxes
  are connected to therapeutic targets by blue lines. Red dots indicate LC3 II. The
  rest of diverse color dots indicates non-selective components involved. (↓: stimulatory
  modification, ⫰: inhibitory modification). (Not to scale)'
