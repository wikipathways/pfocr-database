caption: Feedback loop between peroxisome and mitochondria is shown in red. Fatty
  acids (FA) uptake and its β-oxidation produce NADH equivalents and acetyl-CoA. However,
  the peroxisome membrane is impermeable to large hydrophilic solutes, including NAD+,
  NADH, NADP+, and NADPH, as well as ATP and acylated or unacylated coenzyme A (CoA)
  (). Consequently, NADH-shuttling proteins, working together in the peroxisomes,
  cytosol, and mitochondria, deliver NADH to mitochondria to feed oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS; ). Acetyl-CoA produced in peroxisomes is delivered to mitochondria via
  acetyl-carnitine produced in peroxisomes, and mitochondria use the TCA cycle and
  OXPHOS for full oxidation to CO2 and H2O (). The SNF1/AMP-activated protein kinase
  (AMPK) complex, which is sensitive to the cellular AMP:ATP ratio, maintains the
  balance between ATP production and consumption (; ; ). Glucose deprivation, which
  reduces ATP production, activates Snf1 (by phosphorylation) via the action of the
  Sak1 kinase, and in P. pastoris, the nuclear translocation of the SNF1–Gal83 complex
  requires OXPHOS and ATP production. Peroxisome-associated proteins, such as the
  division protein, Pex11, and the matrix proteins, Pot1 and Aox1, are regulated negatively
  by transcriptional repressors, that compete with transcriptional activators, such
  as Mit1 and Mxr1 (equivalent to ScAdr1). Snf1 activation in the cytosol and SNF1–Gal83
  entry into the nucleus removes, by phosphorylation of the appropriate proteins,
  the repression of expression of the peroxisome-associated proteins, while also activating
  the transcriptional activators. This simultaneous action of SNF1–Gal83 turns on
  the biogenesis of peroxisome-associated proteins, peroxisome proliferation, as well
  as division. In the ΔnugM, Δndufa9, Δgal83, Δpot1, Δaox1 Δaox2, and Δpex5 mutants
  of P. pastoris, or in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), peroxisome proliferation,
