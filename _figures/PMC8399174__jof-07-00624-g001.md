caption: H2O2 induces the activation of stress (SakA/MpkC), pheromone (MpkB), and
  cell wall integrity (MpkA) MAPK signaling pathways. H2O2 induced the phosphorylation
  of nearly all components of the stress SakA/MpkC MAPK pathway (indicated in magenta).
  Histidine kinases PhkA, PhkB, and FphA, phosphotransfer protein YpdA, and response
  regulators SskA and SrrA are components of a stress sensing phosphorelay system.
  SskA transmits stress signals to the MAPK module composed by MAPKKK SskB, MAPKK
  PbsB and MAPKs SakA, and MpkC. H2O2 induced SakA activation through phosphorylation
  of its TGY activation loop. SakA, MpkC, kinase SrkA, and phosphatase PtpA show physical
  interaction. Very likely, SrkA and transcription factor AtfA are SakA (and possibly
  MpkC) substrates. Phosphatase NimT, mRNA-binding protein FabM, and Histone H2B are
  proposed as SrkA substrates, based on previous physical interaction results. Transcription
  factors SrrA and NapA, directly involved in the antioxidant response, presented
  H2O2-specific phosphorylation. H2O2 also affected the phosphorylation of multiple
  components of the pheromone MpkB (indicated in green) and cell wall integrity MpkA
  (indicated in gray) pathways and the corresponding MAPKs were activated by H2O2.
  The pheromone pathway, composed by kinases SteC, MkkB, and MpkB, and by SteD adaptor
  and HamE scaffold proteins, forms a cytoplasmic pentameric complex. The phosphatase
  and kinase STRIPAK complex regulates MpkB and MpkC phosphorylation, development,
  and secondary metabolism. Activated MpkB is translocated to the nucleus, where it
  could phosphorylate VeA and interact with transcription factor SteA. VeA, VelB,
  and LaeA methyltransferase form a complex. In the MpkA pathway, mechanosensor WscA
  transduces the stress signal to GTPase RhoA, which activates protein kinase C PkcA,
  triggering the MAPK cascade composed by BckA, MkkA, and MpkA. As a critical regulator
  of cell physiology, RhoA is regulated by GEF Rom2 (AN4719) and GAPs Lrg1 (AN7576),
  Bem3 (AN5787), and Bag7 (AN11994). Rom2 binds to PI(4,5)P2, generated by Mss4 (AN2766),
  to activate RhoA. PkcA is also activated by the kinase PkhA. Once activated, MpkA
  phosphorylates transcription factor RlmA, required for the expression of cell wall
  biosynthesis genes. The Cdc42 Rho GTPase ModA module (indicated in purple) regulates
  effector proteins that control the cytoskeleton, membrane-trafficking, and polar
  growth, and is linked to MAPK regulation. Scaffold protein BemA (AN7030) is critical
  to localize GEF protein Cdc24 (AN5592), the source of active Cdc42. Bud3 is another
  ModA GEF and Cla4 (AN8836) and Ste20 (AN2067) PAK kinases are ModA effectors. Membrane
  proteins Sho1 and MsbA, which were dephosphorylated in H2O2, could also mediate
  protein interactions linked to the activation of all three MAPK pathways. H2O2 affected
  the phosphorylation of Cdc24, BemA, GAPS Bem2 (AN3746) and Bem3 (AN5787), GEF Bud3,
  and kinase Cla4. Protein names correspond to S. cerevisiae, except when A. nidulans
  protein has been described. Proteins in white background were not detected to be
  phosphorylated. Yellow P circles indicate phosphosites not affected by H2O2. Blue
  phosphosites were dephosphorylated in H2O2 and red phosphosites correspond to H2O2-specific
  phosphosites. Plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nuclear compartments are indicated.
  Continuous arrowhead lines indicate positive interaction, T-lines indicate negative
  interaction, continuous lines indicate interaction, and dotted arrows indicate protein
  translocation. Relevant references are indicated in the corresponding sections.
