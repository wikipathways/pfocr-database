caption: Merged network pathway analysis of proteins involved in cellular assembly
  and organization, cellular compromise, and protein folding that were identified
  in cytoplasmic fraction. Proteins shaded in green indicate a 2-fold or greater decrease
  in abundance, and proteins shaded in red correspond to a 2-fold or greater increase
  in the cytoplasmic fraction of HRSV-infected cells. The color intensity denotes
  the degree of abundance. Proteins in white are those identified through the Ingenuity
  Pathways Knowledge Base. The shapes denote the molecular class of the protein. A
  solid line indicates a direct interaction, and a dashed line indicates an indirect
  interaction. The yellow lines denote the linkage between the pathways through NF-κB
  and STAT1 signaling. A full explanation of lines and relationships is provided in
  supplemental Fig. 3.
