caption: Molecular interactions between p53 and Wnt signaling in cancer. (A) Effects
  of Wnt pathway components on p53 function. These include β-catenin-dependent upregulation
  of P14ARF, an inhibitor of MDM2, the main negative regulator of p53. Other interactions
  include the modulation of p53 function by direct interaction with GSK3β, Wnt-dependent
  repression of p53 transcription via miR-52, and stabilization of p53 by WNT5A. Interacting
  Wnt pathway components are colored in red. (B,C) Biological effects of wild-type
  (blue symbol) and mutant p53 on different Wnt pathway components (colored in red).
  Inhibitory (B) and activating (C) interactions are shown. Arrows indicate activation
  and T-shaped arrow heads indicate inhibitory interactions. The main inhibitory effects
  of p53 on Wnt signaling include GSK3β and SIAH1-dependent ubiquitination of β-catenin,
  miRNA and lncRNA-mediated repression of Wnt target genes, and induction of secreted
  Wnt antagonists such as DKK1 (B). p53 stimulates Wnt signaling by increasing the
  expression of different WNT ligands and Fzd receptors (C).
