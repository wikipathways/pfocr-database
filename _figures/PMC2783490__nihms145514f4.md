caption: Conceptually, the main difference between CYP74 (left, using fatty acid hydroperoxide)
  and the conventional P450 CYP3A (right, using the antiepileptic drug valproic acid)
  is the activation of substrate and enzyme. In CYP74 this occurs via reaction of
  hydroperoxide with the ferric enzyme giving a substrate radical and Compound II
  (FeIV-OH). In CYP3A reaction proceeds via the conventional route involving molecular
  oxygen (O2), utilization of NADPH to reduce [O] to H2O, formation of Compound I
  (FeV=O, not shown), and hydrogen abstraction from the alkane giving the substrate
  radical and Compound II. From that point forward, Compound II catalyzes either “oxygen
  rebound” (the hydroxylation pathway) or a second hydrogen abstraction resulting
  in net desaturation of the original substrate. Allene oxide synthesis is the usual
  outcome for CYP74, hydroxylation is the usual outcome for the conventional P450
  CYP3A, but occasionally with either enzyme, a substrate will take both pathways
  to products.
