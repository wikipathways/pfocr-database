caption: 'Cytoplasmic PI3K signaling can regulate HR pathway via mTOR-mediated protein
  synthesis and gene transcription of HR repair while nuclear PI3K signaling can regulate
  both HR and NHEJ pathways via active AKT. Upon PI3K pathway activation, mTORC1 increases
  protein synthesis of HR repair proteins e.g., BRCA1, RAD50, RAD51 and FANCD2 by
  phosphorylating 4E-BP1 and S6K. mTORC2 also increases FANCD2 transcripts by phosphorylating
  NF-κB which consequently increases its loading onto the promoter region of FANCD2.
  In addition, PI3K can indirectly downregulate the BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcriptions
  through compensatory MEK/ERK/EST1 pathway activation. Separately, DNA damage sensors
  including ATM and DNA-PK induce nuclear AKT activation in response to DSBs. Active
  AKT blocks nuclear translocation of BRCA1 from cytoplasm leading to impaired HR
  repair. It also indirectly inhibits BRCA2 via EMSY phosphorylation, resulting in
  the downregulation of HR pathway. For NHEJ repair, active AKT enhances NHEJ pathway
  by promoting autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs. It also stabilizes UBE2S thereby enhances
  its association with Ku70. Active Ku70 then recruits DNA-PKcs to DSBs sites leading
  to activation of DNA-PKcs kinase to initiate NHEJ repair process. White boxes represent
  cytoplasmic proteins, gray boxes are nuclear proteins and black boxes indicate DNA
  repair proteins. Abbreviations: 4E-BP1 = eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding
