caption: '(A) The proposed concept on the role of SOCE–mediated Ca2+ signal in the
  regulation of G1/S cell cycle transition. The activation of SOCE controls the expression
  level of cyclin E and the interaction between cyclin E and phospho-CDK2 that regulate
  G1/S cell cycle transition. (B) Inhibition of SOCE activation results in the excursive
  expression of cyclin E that leads to cell autophagy and apoptosis. CM: calmodulin.'
