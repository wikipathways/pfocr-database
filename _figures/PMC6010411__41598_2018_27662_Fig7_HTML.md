caption: Paradigm describing how differences in MAPK signaling lead to inter-individual
  variability in phBEC ozone-mediated IL-8 induction. Previous studies have suggested
  that ozone exposure leads to the activation of the MAP Kinases ERK1/2 and p38 by
  various mechanisms including the activation of the EGFR receptor. The activation
  of both kinases is important for full ozone-mediated IL-8 induction, yet the magnitude
  of ozone-induced IL-8 expression is only correlated with the level of ERK1/2 activation.
  Based on these observations, we propose a ‘dimmer switch’ model describing how p38
  and ERK1/2 act in concert to regulate IL-8 expression. A basal level of p38 activation
  is required to achieve full IL-8 expression (acting as an ‘on/off’ switch), while
  the level of ERK1/2 pathway activation modulates the magnitude of expression (the
  ‘dimmer’). These kinases both activate effector proteins and kinases such as RSK
  and MK2, in addition to other transcription factors and stress-associated proteins.
  These ultimately converge on the IL-8 promoter and regulate gene transcription.
