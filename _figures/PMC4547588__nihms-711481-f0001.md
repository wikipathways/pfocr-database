caption: Interferons and other inflammatory cytokines control HBV infection of hepatocytes
  via multiple, distinct mechanisms. The viral replication cycle and cytokine-induced
  molecular pathways in hepatocytes are illustrated and explained in detail in the
  text. Sequential replication steps are highlighted with red lines. IFNs bind to
  their receptors on hepatocytes to trigger the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and induce
  the expression of ISGs (green lines), which control HBV replication via inhibition
  of pgRNA encapsidation and cccDNA transcription, as well as the elimination of cccDNA
  (black lines). TNF-α and IL-1β bind to their cognate receptors to activate the NF-κB
  pathway, inducing expression of AID (blue lines), which restricts HBV entry into
  hepatocytes and suppresses viral replication (black lines).
