caption: (A) Anatomy of an mRNA. mRNAs are typically capped (black ball). Immediately
  afterwards is a 5’ untranslated region (UTR) rendered here with a secondary structure
  that can modulate translation efficiency or mediate bypass of general translation
  factors. The coding sequences (CDS) contain the primary sequence of the polypeptide
  that results from translation. This is followed by a 3’ UTR rich in regulatory elements
  decoded by trans-acting RNAs (e.g. miRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Most
  mRNA have a poly(A) tail at the 3’ end. (B) Regulation of cap-dependent translation
  initiation. The eIF4F complex containing eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G recruits eIF3 and
  ribosomes to scan the mRNA for a suitable start codon. This process is controlled
  by MAPK kinases such as ERK that act via MNK to phosphorylate eIF4E. A second pathway
  controls eIF4E activity through mTORC1 which phosphorylates 4EBPs preventing their
  association and sequestration of eIF4E. Additionally, the association of eIF4G and
  the poly(A) binding protein (PAB) stimulates the efficiency of translation initiation.
  (C) An overview of eIF2α-dependent translation. Upstream kinases control the activity
  of eIF2. Phosphorylation of the α subunit inhibits the guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor eIF2B, resulting in bulk translational inhibition.
