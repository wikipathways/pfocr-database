caption: Two kinases are required to promote mitotic entry. Cyclin B-Cdk1 and Gwl
  are both required for mitotic entry. Cyclin B-Cdk1 is activated at G2-M by dephosphorylation
  of the inhibitory residues of Cdk1 threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 by the dual phosphatase
  Cdc25. Once activated, cyclin B-Cdk1 promotes phosphorylation of mitotic substrates.
  In contrast, Gwl activation at mitotic entry promotes the inhibition of PP2A-B55,
  the phosphatase responsible for mitotic substrate dephosphorylation. Dotted lines
  represent inactive pathways during mitosis. Dotted red lines symbolize indirect
  regulation.
