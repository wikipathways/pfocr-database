caption: Schematic diagram of PEDV nsp14 targets IKK complex and p65 to inhibit NF-κB
  activity. PEDV nsp14 negatively regulates NF-κB signaling pathway by interacting
  with IKKα/β and p65, which inhibits the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and p65, and nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB, leading to the decreased expression of early production
  of proinflammatory cytokines
