caption: The GO function and KEGG pathways enrichment analysis for the up- and down-regulated
  mRNAs. a the network constructed by the up-regulated mRNAs; b the network constructed
  by the down-regulated mRNAs; GO represents Gene Ontology; KEGG represents Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; the red point represents a certain name of GO
  function or KEGG pathway; the green line represents the interaction between two
  points; the thickness of the line indicates the number of overlapping genes between
  the different gene sets
