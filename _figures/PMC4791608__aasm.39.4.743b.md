caption: NPR2 and cGMP signaling pathway enriched in patients with OSA of the discovery
  cohort. In comparison between patients with OSA and healthy subjects, the significantly
  hypomethylated genes were highlighted with a blue-colored barometric bar. The changes
  represent the differences between the median M values of healthy patients and those
  with OSA. For example, the median M value for healthy patients and those with OSA
  is 1.27 and 0.37, respectively, for NPR2. Therefore, there is a lower methylation
  level (−0.9) in patients with OSA, which was shown as a blue bar alongside the NPR2
  gene.
