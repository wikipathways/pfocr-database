caption: 'The regulation of cysteine metabolism in ferroptosis. Cysteine regulates
  ferroptosis through multiple pathways. In the H2S oxidation pathway, cysteine can
  be degraded into compounds which are used to synthesize fatty acids. PUFAs that
  undergo lipid peroxidation are involved in ferroptosis. The continuous supply of
  Fe-S clusters by mitochondrial NFS1 stopped the iron-starvation response. GCL can
  catalyze cysteine to form the antioxidant GSH. CDO, which catalyzes the conversion
  of cysteine to taurine, can compete with GCL for cysteine, thereby limiting GSH
  synthesis and promoting ROS. In addition, Cyst(e)ine could regulate ferroptosis
  independently of GSH by activating Rag-mTORC1-4EBPs signaling axis and promoting
  GPX4 protein synthesis. Abbreviations: system Xc-: cystine-glutamate antiporter
  transport system; ASCT1: solute carrier family 1A4 transporter: EAAT3: excitatory
