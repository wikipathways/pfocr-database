caption: TGF-β signaling and resistance to immunotherapy; As an immunosuppression
  cytokine, TGF-β is secreted by both tumor and stromal cells. TGF-β signaling pathway
  directly inhibits T cell function by up-regulating the expression of FoxP3, converting
  cytotoxic T cells to Treg cells to restrain immune response. Besides, TGF-β impairs
  NK function by down-regulation of NKG2D and NKp30, two surface receptors directing
  NK cells to eliminate abnormal cells. TGF-β impairs antigen presentation in DC cells
  by decreasing MHCII expression. TGF-β signaling pathway polarizes macrophages to
  the pro-tumorigenic M2 phenotype by increasing Snail, converts N1 neutrophils to
  an N2 phenotype by up-regulation of arginine, CCL2, CCL5, and facilitates expansion
  of MDSCs leading to enhanced immune tolerance.
