caption: Evolutionary conservation of the RAS/MAPK signalling pathway from yeast to
  mammals. The RAS/MAPK signalling pathway, which responds to extracellular cues such
  as growth factors and nutrients to control cell survival, proliferation and metabolism,
  is highly conserved from yeast to mammals. (A-D) In this summary schematic, showing
  yeast (A), Drosophila (B), C. elegans (C) and mouse (D), orthologous downstream
  signalling components are positioned in comparable locations within the pathway
  and colour coded. In multicellular organisms, signalling initiates with the binding
  of growth factors and/or nutrients to an RTK. Across species, association of the
  GEF SOS with RAS promotes GDP to GTP exchange on the RAS small GTPase, activating
  the signalling cascade. The key downstream effector of signalling is ERK, which
  enters the nucleus upon activation to regulate the activity of RAS-responsive transcription
  factors, including members of the ETS family. Aop, Anterior open; ELK1, ETS domain-containing
