caption: '1: De novo synthesis occur in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the activation
  several enzymes such as SPT: Serine Palmitoyltransferase; CERS: Ceramide synthases;
  DES: Dihydroceramide desaturase. 2: Salvage pathway is the synthesis of ceramide
  from sphingosine that occur in endo/lysosomes by the action of SMPD1: Sphingomyelinase
  1 and ceramidase. 3: catabolic pathway occur on the cellular membrane by the hydrolysis
  of ceramides in the presence of Sphingomyelin synthases (SMS) sphingomyelin is formed,
  by Sphingomyelinase 3(SMPD3), ceramides is formed. 4: Transposrt and metabolism
  occur in Golgi apparatus. CERK: ceramide kinase; SMPD2: Sphingomyelinase2; SMS:Sphingomyelin
  synthases; CERT1: ceramide transfer protein; ACER: alkaline/neutral ceramidase;
  SK sphingosine kinase.'
