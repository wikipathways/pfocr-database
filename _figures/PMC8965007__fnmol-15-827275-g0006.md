caption: 'The cross-talk between BMP and Wnt signaling pathways in neural differentiation.
  (1) Wnt signaling initiation results from the interaction of Wnt ligand with the
  N-terminal extra-cellular cysteine-rich domain of a Frizzled (Fz) family receptor
  that activates disheveled. (2) Activated disheveled changes the destructive protein
  complex containing axin, APC, GSK3, and CKIα, resulting in GSK3 suppression. (3)
  Normally, the destructive complex inhibits β-catenin via the degrading effects of
  GSK3. Wnt-induced alteration of this complex increases the stability of β-catenin.
  (4) Stabilized β-catenin is translocated into the nucleus and activates TCF/LEF
  transcription factors that regulate the expression of Wnt target genes such as neurogenin
  1, Emx2, and Max2, which induce neural fate determination. (5) Probable mechanisms
  for synergistic effects of Wnt and BMP: (a) Wnt inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation effects
  on specific sites of Smad1 in the linker region that stabilizes Smad1 and enhances
  BMP signaling. (b) Smads can directly collaborate with the β-catenin/TCF/LEF transcription
  complex that synergistically regulates the transcription of target genes such as
  neurogenin 1, Emx2, and Max2. (6) In the absence of any ligands, Smad1 binds and
  inhibits disheveled-1. The presence of BMP2 increases phosphorylated Smad1, which
  increases the inhibitory interaction between disheveled-1 and Smad1 that finally
  suppresses Wnt signaling pathway.'
