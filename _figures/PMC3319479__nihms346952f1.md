caption: PD-1 and CTLA-4 play distinct roles in regulating T cell immunity. CTLA-4
  modulates the early phases of activation of naïve or memory T cells in response
  to TCR stimulation by MHC-peptide complexes displayed by antigen presenting cells
  (“signal 1”). In contrast, PD-1 is expressed on antigen-experienced T cells in the
  periphery, and serves to limit the activity of T cells at the time of an inflammatory
  response, thereby protecting normal tissues from collateral destruction. DC, dendritic
  cell.
