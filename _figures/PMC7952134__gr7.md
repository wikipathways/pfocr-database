caption: PPP2R5D E420K-variant signaling. Diagram of pathway regulation by PPP2R5D
  containing PP2A-holoenzymes altered in E420K variant HEK-293 cells based on the
  data presented. Phosphorylation sites shown in blue (hyperphosphorylated) and green
  (hypophosphorylated) differ in the E420K variant cells as compared with wild-type
  cells.
papertitle: A disorder-related variant (E420K) of a PP2A-regulatory subunit (PPP2R5D)
  causes constitutively active AKT-mTOR signaling and uncoordinated cell growth.
