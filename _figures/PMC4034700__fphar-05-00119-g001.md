caption: Proposed pathways contributing to the maternal syndrome of preeclampsia and
  the mechanism of action of antioxidants, ER chaperones, NO, and H2S donors and statins.
  Deficient conversion of spiral arteries leads to fluctuations in O2 concentration
  and triggers ischemia-reperfusion type injury of the placenta and consequent oxidative
  stress and ER stress. ROS activate various stress pathways, including proapoptotic
  p38 and inflammatory NF-κB pathway. These pathways promote increased shedding of
  microparticles, anti-angionenic factors and inflammatory cytokines, which lead to
  development of the peripheral maternal symptoms. Antioxidants, ER chaperones, NO
  and H2S donors and statins all display pleitrophic effects, targeting inflammatory,
  stress, antioxidant pathways, as well as VEGF and NO signaling.
