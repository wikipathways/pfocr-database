caption: Fructose metabolism in the body. The fructose ingested by the body will be
  first transported to the enterocyte via GLUT5, and then absorbed and metabolized
  in an insulin-independent manner. Through all the processes of metabolism in the
  small intestine, uric acid is produced. The rapid phosphorylation of fructose into
  fructose 1-phosphate requires ATP to provide a phosphate molecule, which reduces
  intracellular levels of ATP, GTP, and phosphate, leading to the accumulation of
  AMP and activation of AMP deaminase. AMP generates IMP under the action of AMP deaminase.
  IMP levels are elevated, which is metabolized with GMP to produce uric acid. Uric
  acid, in turn, inhibits AMP-activated protein kinases, which promotes more AMP metabolism
  through AMP deaminase, resulting in more uric acid production. The extent to which
  fructose enters the liver through the small intestine depends on the amount of fructose
  ingested. Fructose metabolism appears to be a saturation process in the intestinal,
  with only high doses of dietary fructose spreading to the portal circulation through
  the transporter GLUT2 and further extracted by the liver. Fructose and eventual
  metabolism in the liver produce pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, leading to adipogenesis,
  and the metabolic processes accompanied by rapid depletion of intracellular ATP
  and Pi and the production of corresponding uric acid. Renal proximal straight tubule
  expression of fructokinase and aldolase B is the main site of fructose metabolism
  under physiological conditions, continuous intake of large amounts of fructose leads
  to renal metabolism exceeding the threshold, resulting in a large amount of ATP
  depletion and inflammatory response, and finally a large amount of uric acid production
  and tubular damage. In addition, endogenous fructose obtained by the polyol pathway
  in the kidneys may be another potential mechanism for causing kidney damage and
  uric acid production.
