caption: Possible neuroprotective mechanisms of mild mitochondrial uncoupling and
  caloric restriction in neurodegenerative diseases. (A) Compromised bioenergetics
  in stroke (ischemia), Alzheimer's disease (reduced cerebral blood flow perfusion),
  or hyperglycemia in diabetic conditions results in an energy defect in neurons.
  (B) The interventions of mild mitochondrial uncoupling and caloric restriction cause
  a mild metabolic stress. Through a compensatory response, brain energy metabolism
  is stimulated. Glucose uptake is accelerated with increased expression of the brain
  glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and BDNF in the brain. NAD(P)H oxidation in mitochondria
  is enhanced with increased respiration, which modulates cellular NAD+ levels and
  the NAD+/NADH redox state, and activates SIRT1/sirtuin–PGC1α signaling pathway.
