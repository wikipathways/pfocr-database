caption: Molecular mechanisms of Keap1-dependent and Keap1-independent modulation
  of Nrf2. The regulation of Nrf2 involves both the Keap1-dependent and Keap1-independent
  pathways. Under normal physiological conditions, dimers of Keap1 exist in the cytoplasm
  and are substrate adapters protein for Cul3 E3 ubiquitin ligases. Nrf2 is ubiquitinated
  by E3 ubiquitin ligase, and degraded by the 26S proteasome. During oxidative stress,
  ROS can modify the reactive cysteine residues within Keap1, such as Cys151 in the
  BTB domain and Cys273, Cys288 in the IVR domain. This interaction disrupt the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1
  ubiquitin ligase complex and Nrf2 interaction, leading to the dissociation of Nrf2
  from Keap1. When Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1, it translocates into the nucleus where
  it forms heterodimers with Maf proteins within the Neh1 domain. In promoter regions,
  Nrf2 forms a complex with the ARE, thereby enhancing the antioxidant capacity by
  facilitating transcription of downstream antioxidant genes. Nrf2 can also be activated
  via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The protein p62 serves as a selective autophagy
  receptor, facilitating the targeting of ubiquitinated substrates to autophagosomes
  for degradation. This interaction facilitates the integration of Keap1 into the
  autophagosome for degradation through the autophagy pathway, resulting in the separation
  of Nrf2 and Keap1 and thereby promoting the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes.
  miRNA plays a key role in the regulation of Nrf2 and contributes to its antioxidant
  capacity
