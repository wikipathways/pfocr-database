caption: 'Post-transcriptional manipulation of the host cell metabolism by the RNA
  virus rhinovirus. Rhinovirus (RV) orchestrates an anabolic reprogramming of the
  host cell metabolism: RV induces PI3K-dependent trafficking of GLUT1-containing
  vesicles to the cell membrane, ultimately leading to increased glucose uptake. Subsequently,
  RV increases both glycolysis and glycogenolysis, providing TCA intermediates needed
  for anabolic lipogenesis. Additionally, RV infection activates the pentose phosphate
  pathway, resulting in elevated nucleotide levels that support viral replication.
  GLUT, glucose transporter; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RV, rhinovirus;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
