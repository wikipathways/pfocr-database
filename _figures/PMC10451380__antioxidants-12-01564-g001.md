caption: Scheme of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Dual-regulation model of NRF2 signaling.
  Neh2 and Neh6 domains of NRF2 participate in NRF2 degradation in response to redox
  and electrophile changes (KEAP1) and to signaling kinases, respectively. The Neh2
  domain binds to the E3 ligase adapter KEAP1, which presents NRF2 for ubiquitination
  to the CUL3/RBX1 complex. The Neh6 domain requires previous phosphorylation by GSK-3β
  to bind to the E3 ligase adapter β-TrCP and subsequent ubiquitination by the CUL1/RBX1
  complex. NRF2 signaling is activated in the presence of xenobiotics, reactive oxygen
  species (ROS)/electrophiles, or compounds like sulforaphane (SFN) or dimethyl fumarate
  (DMF) by the release from KEAP1 or β-TrCP binding and is translocated to the nucleus
  and binds to ARE consensus sequences, which allows for the activation of NRF2-dependent
  genes
