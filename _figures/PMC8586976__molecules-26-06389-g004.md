caption: Anticancer mechanism of AuNPs. Entry of AuNPs into the cell’s endocytosis
  or cellular internalization through a lipid bilayer. AuNPs induce the apoptosis
  of cancerous cells through ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation.
  AuNPs causes ER stress through the activation of caspase 4 and stress-related proteins,
  which also results in apoptosis. Damaged mitochondria release AIF, ENDO-G into the
  nucleus, which causes the final execution of cell death. AuNPs increases the expression
  of P53 and decreases the expression of CDK2, Cyclin E. It also elevates the expression
  of apoptotic gene bid, bax/bcl2, which ultimately leads to G0/G1 phase cell-cycle
  arrest. AuNP induces PCD and apoptosis through the interfering NF-κB signalling
  pathway.
