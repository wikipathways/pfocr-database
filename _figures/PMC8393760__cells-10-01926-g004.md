caption: The urea cycle includes five reactions localised at mitochondria of hepatocytes
  and cytoplasm. The first step involves the CO and ammonia conversion into carbamoyl
  phosphate via carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I). Carbamoyl phosphate and
  ornithine (whose elevated plasma level and decreased urine level are observed in
  patients with nephrolithiasis) combine to citrulline via ornithine transcarbamoylase
  (OTC). Then ornithine translocase transports citrulline from hepatocyte mitochondria
  into the cytoplasm. Citrulline reacts with aspartate and argininosuccinate forms.
  This reaction is catalysed by argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). Argininosuccinate
  is converted into arginine via argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). Finally, arginase
  (ARG1) hydrolyses arginine into urea and ornithine. On the other hand, L-arginine
  may be oxidatively degraded by NOS into L-citrulline and nitric oxide (NO). In the
  course of nephrolithiasis, a decrease in eNOS expression has been observed. Moreover,
  ornithine from the urea cycle may be converted by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)
  in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. ODC polymorphism may be associated with an
  increased risk of kidney stones [].
