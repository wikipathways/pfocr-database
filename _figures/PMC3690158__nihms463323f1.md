caption: Wnt signaling pathways. Canonical vs. non-canonical Wnt signaling is dependent
  on ligand, receptor and co-receptor interactions. Wnt ligands can activate both
  canonical pathways by binding to Fzd receptors and non-canonical pathways through
  co-receptors such as Ror and Ryk. Ror can inhibit β-catenin activity while activating
  Jnk. R-spondins directly bind to Lgr and Lrp co-receptors that interact with Fzd
  to stimulate/augment β-catenin signaling. Norrin can also activate the canonical
  pathway, independent of Wnts. Wnt Inhibitors such as sFRP/Wif also regulate Wnt
  signaling by sequestering Wnt ligands, while Dkk interacts with Lrp to inhibit Wnt
  signaling. The Notch and Fgfr signaling pathways have been found to act both, upstream
  and downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Figure modified from [].
