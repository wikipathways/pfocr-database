caption: Furin in development, homeostasis and disease. a | Furin-mediated cleavage
  of pro-β-nerve growth factor (NGF) produces the 13-kDa β-NGF neurotrophin that binds
  to Trk receptors to promote synaptic innervation. By contrast, inhibition or sequestering
  of furin results in the secretion of pro-β-NGF that binds to the 75-kDa neurotrophin
  receptor (p75NTR) to promote cell-death pathways. b | Ectodysplasin-A (Eda-1) is
  a trimeric tumour necrosis factor family member that stimulates morphogenesis of
  ectodermal structures by activation of its receptor, EDAR, on target cells. Eda-1
  can signal in a juxtacrine manner by binding to EDAR on adjacent cells. However,
  cleavage of membrane anchored Eda-1 by furin releases the ligand and enables it
  to signal through EDAR on distant cells in a paracrine manner. c | In synoviocytes,
  furin and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β participate in a positive feedback
  loop that results in elevated levels of ‘a disintegrin and metalloprotease with
  thrombospondin motifs-4’ (ADAMTS-4, or aggrecanase-1). Furin cleaves both pro-TGF-β
  and pro-ADAMTS-4 to yield the active growth factor and protease, respectively. The
  secreted mature form of TGF-β then binds to its receptor and, through a SMAD2 and
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) convergent pathway, increases furin expression.
  The increased levels of furin lead to an increase in TGF-β, which creates a positive-feedback
  loop. In synoviocytes, TGF-β also stimulates the expression of pro-ADAMTS-4. So,
  because furin and TGF-β are in this positive loop, the levels of active ADAMTS-4
  are greatly elevated, which leads to destruction of the cartilage protein aggrecan
  and hence to rheumatoid arthritis. d | Furin activates several membrane-type matrix
  metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) that are involved in tumour formation and metastasis.
  Furin-activated MT-MMP1 activates MMP2 (gelatinase), which degrades the extracellular
  matrix, and MT-MMP1 also directly degrades extracellular matrix itself.
