caption: 'The EGFR roles in liver regeneration and fibrosis. This figure illustrates
  the multifaceted role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in both liver
  regeneration after injury and the development of liver fibrosis. A, B, C: EGFR Activation
  Promotes Liver Regeneration. A The ZBTB20 gene promotes the activation of EGFR and
  AKT signalling pathways, contributing to liver regeneration. B P2Y2R, a G protein-coupled
  receptor, activates EGFR upon binding to extracellular ATP. This activation increases
  phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) levels and promotes cellular proliferation. C During
  liver regeneration, various ligands such as HB-EGF, TGF-α, AREG, and epiregulin
  become elevated. These ligands bind to EGFR, leading to the activation of downstream
  signalling pathways that promote cell proliferation and ultimately liver regeneration.
  D, E: EGFR and Liver Fibrosis. D Accumulation of bile acids (BAs) triggers EGFR
  transactivation, which in turn activates the MAPK/ERK and JNK signalling pathways.
  These pathways are involved in repressing Cyp7a1, a gene that regulates BA synthesis.
  Additionally, BAs activate the FXR-SOCS3 pathway, leading to STAT3 inhibition. This
  allows for the transcription of AREG and other genes by nuclear EGFR. E EGFR activation
  can induce the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, a process that contributes
  to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic
  steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma'
