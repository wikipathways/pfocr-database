caption: a) The known branched pathway from d-Glucose 1-phosphate to 2-Phospho-D-glycerate
  in KEGG. er1 and er2 are two sub-branched pathways in this known pathway. b) The
  found pathway of BPAT-M. c) The found pathway of BPAT-S. d) The found pathway of
  Retrace. e) The found pathway of BPFinder. fr1 and fr2 are two sub-branched pathways
  in the found pathway of BPFinder. The compounds circled with dashed ellipses are
  the branched compounds in the pathways. In the found pathways, the reactions that
  appear with the same substrates and products in the known pathway are drawn in green.
  In the sub-branched pathways er1 and fr1, the conserved atom groups from d-Glucose
  1-phosphate in the branched compounds are drawn in blue and orange in the dashed
  rectangles respectively. In the sub-branched pathways er2 and fr2, the conserved
  atom groups from d-Glucose 1-phosphate in the branched compounds are drawn in red
  in the dashed rectangles.
