caption: 'Emerging signaling pathways in HCC: chromatin remodeling: restricting transcriptional
  and DNA condensation occurs as a result of histone deacetylation catalyzed by HDACs
  in nucleosome. In contrast, transcriptional activation also occurs using chromatin
  remodeling complexes by allowing access to transcription machinery via nucleosome
  restructuring. Notch signaling: NOTCH receptor is cleaved photolytically when protein
  ligand binds to its extracellular domain. This binding releases its intracellular
  domain (NOTCH-ICD) that enters into nucleus to modify target gene expression (such
  as SOX9, HEY, and HES). Hedgehog (Hh) signaling: nuclear translocation of the transcription
  factor (TF) GLI occurs as a result of PTCH inhibitory effect on SMO and this event
  takes place in the presence of Hh signaling. Hippo signaling: kinase complexes Lats1/2-Mob1
  and MST1/2-SVA1 are activated with phosphorylation of the transcription factor YAP
  resulting in prevention of its nuclear translocation. This event involves the use
  of upstream regulators of hippo pathway (i.e., FDM6, NF2, and FAT). Microbiota and
  lymphotoxins: NF-kβ signaling activates and produces proinflammatory molecules such
  as TNF-α and cytokines due to recognition of microbial ligands (LPS/PAMPs) by TLKRs
  (e.g., TLK4) on the hepatic stellate cells [].'
