caption: Potential HIV-related neuropathic pain pathway. Peripheral nerve inflammation
  after HIV infection, promotes the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides
  that stimulate glial cells in the spinal cord. The activated glia induce release
  of pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, nerve growth factors, chemokines,
  glutamates, etc., which bind their receptors on the neurons to induce a massive
  Ca2+ influx into neurons. Ca2+ is rapidly sequestrated by mitochondria. This consequently
  damages MnSOD activity and increases mitochondrial ROS production, which in turn
  results in synaptic plasticity of the dorsal horn neurons. It is possible that ROS
  injures the production of GABA through GAD67 synthesis inhibition. CaM = calcium-calmodulin;
  Chemo=chemokines; Cyto=cytokines; glu = glutamate; NMDA-R = N-methyl-D-aspartate
  receptor; NO = nitric oxide.
