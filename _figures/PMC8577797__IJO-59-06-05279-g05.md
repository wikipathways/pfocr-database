caption: Potential mechanisms through which shikonin regulates ADAM17 and IL-6/STAT3
  signaling. IL-6 binds to membrane IL-6R to activate classical signaling and binds
  to sIL-6R to transduce trans-signaling, both of which result in STAT3 phosphorylation
  and contribute to cancer development. ADAM17 mRNA is translated to the precursor
  form of ADAM17, which is modified to mature ADAM17 mediated by RHBDF2. RHBDF2 also
  stabilizes mature ADAM17, enabling substrate cleavage. PACS-2 plays an important
  role in ADAM17 recycling, and PACS-2 deficiency leads to the degradation of mature
  ADAM17 by endosomes. ADAM17 cleaves mIL-6R to enable IL-6 trans-signaling by releasing
  more sIL-6R and cleaves EGF, allowing EGFR signaling, to promote cancer. Shikonin
  decreases p-STAT3 and suppresses the expression of ADAM17 by inducing ROS-mediated
  p-eIF2α. Translational inhibition by increased p-eIF2α results in ADAM17 defects
  in HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cells. Concurrent inhibition of ADAM17 and IL-6/STAT3
  signaling may synergistically contribute to the suppression of colon cancer cells
  in response to shikonin. STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription
