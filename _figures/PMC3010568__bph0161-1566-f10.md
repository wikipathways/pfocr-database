caption: Scheme of the JEV-mediated signalling pathways linked to matrix metalloproteinase
  (MMP-9) expression in brain astrocytes. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-induced
  MMP-9 expression is mediated through NADPH oxidase/reactive oxygen species (ROS)/MAPKs
  leading to NF-κB activation. This signalling pathway might contribute to sustained
  expression of MMP-9 which is implicated in brain inflammation. Moreover, JEV may
  induce expression of some cytokines, including IL-1α, IL-β, TNF-α and IFN-γ in rat
  brain astrocytes-1 cells.
