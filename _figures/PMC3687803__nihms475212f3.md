caption: The canonical wnt signaling pathway. Wnts bind to their frizzled receptors
  (FZ) and coreceptors LRP in the membrane. This binding can be blocked by dickkopf
  (Dkk) or soluble frizzled related proteins (sFRP). Activation of FZ by wnt results
  in phosphorylation of disheveled (Dvl), which induces the disruption of the axin/APC/
  GSK-3β complex and recruitment of axin to the membrane. This complex when active
  phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its proteosomal degradation. However, following
  wnt stimulation β-catenin is no longer degraded and can enter the nucleus where
  in combination with members of the LEF/TCF family can induce expression of its target
  genes such as cyclin D1. β-catenin also binds to the E-cadherin complex in the plasma
  membrane, a complex stabilized by calcium and induced by 1,25(OH)2D
