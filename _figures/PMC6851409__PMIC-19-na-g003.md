caption: Increased (m+5) glutamate in patient‐derived pancreatic cancer (JHU094) orthotopic
  tumors after treatment with GLS1 inhibitor, BPTES‐NP. Patient‐derived pancreatic
  tumors were surgically implanted into the pancreas of mice to generate orthotopic
  tumors. Four weeks after orthotopic tumor implantation, mice received either GLS1
  inhibitor, 54 mg kg−1 BPTES‐NP, or vehicle control, Blank‐NP, via intravenous injection
  every 3 days for 16 days. Tumors were then excised and subjected to metabolomics
  analysis. A,B) Comparison of (m+5) glutamate intensities between vehicle control
  and BPTES‐NP‐treated tumors. (A) Intensity relative to vehicle control and (B) extracted
  ion chromatograms of (m+5) glutamate isotopologue in patient‐derived pancreatic
  orthotopic tumors treated with vehicle control, shown in blue, or BPTES‐NP, shown
  in red. Ion chromatograms are shown as the peak area denoting the total signal intensity
  of (m+5) glutamate in the respective tumor groups. All data is shown as mean ± SEM
  (n = 6 per group). This experiment was replicated twice with similar results. **p
  < 0.01 (Student's t‐test) where indicated. C) Illustration of the formation of (m+5)
  glutamate via the glutaminase II pathway coupled to an α‐ketoglutarate‐linked aminotransferase
  or the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) reaction. The glutaminase II pathway (purple
  arrow) consists of the GTK catalyzed conversion of glutamine to α‐ketoglutaramate
  (KGM) followed by hydrolysis of KGM to α‐ketoglutarate by ω‐amidase. This pathway
  then acts as a source of glutamate via transamination of α‐ketoglutarate by an α‐ketoglutarate‐linked
  aminotransferase or by reductive amination catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase
  (GDH) (orange arrow). For comparison, the glutaminase 1 (GLS1) reaction for the
  formation of (m+6) glutamate from (m+7) glutamine (blue arrow) and GLS1 inhibition
  by BPTES‐NP (pink arrow) are shown. Enzymes are shown in purple (glutaminase II
  pathway), orange (α‐ketoglutarate‐linked aminotransferase or GDH), or blue (GLS1).
  Metabolites are shown in black. Red circles indicate 13C labeling, and green circles
  indicate 15N labeling.
