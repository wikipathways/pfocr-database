caption: 'The pathway with solid bold arrows was functionally characterized by the
  identification of novel genes, and intermediate compounds were also identified and
  estimated. Pathways with dashed bold arrows were proposed accordingly based on the
  feeding test with IAM and TAM. Solid thin arrows denote pathways proposed in green
  plants but not known in fungi including N. crassa. Unidentified homologues of the
  genes in N. crassa for the respective biosynthetic steps are indicated by question
  marks. IAN, with bracketed lines, has not been identified in the N. crassa culture.
  All other indoles without any brackets (except IAM and TAM) were identified from
  the culture upon tryptophan feeding. Indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) and indole-3-acetaldehyde
  (IAAld) are very unstable compounds and spontaneously convert into indole-3-lactic
  acid (ILA) and indole-3-ethanol (TOL), respectively. ILA and TOL can be readily
  identified in culture as a proxy for IPA and IAAld, respectively. Numbers in the
  figure reflect different enzymes: 1—tryptophan aminotransferase, 2—pyruvate decarboxylase,
  3—aldehyde dehydrogenase, 4—flavin monooxygenase, 5—L-amino acid oxidase, 6—N-acylethanolamine
  amidohydrolase, 7 –aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase and glutamate decarboxylase.'
