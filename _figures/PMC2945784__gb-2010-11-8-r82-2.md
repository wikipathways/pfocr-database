caption: 'Cancer signaling pathways affected within the tumor. (a) Pre-treatment:
  overall, the down-regulation of PTEN and up-regulation of the RET signaling pathway
  appear to be driving tumor proliferation. Increased signaling independent of EGFR
  is consistent with the observed erlotinib insensitivity of the tumor. (b) Post-versus
  pre-treatment: after treatment with the RET inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib,
  there is a marked increase in the signaling of pathway constituents, increasing
  tumor proliferation. Black and red pathway arrows represent activation and inhibition,
  respectively. Dotted arrows represent indirect interactions. The number of arrows
  denoting significantly over- or under-expressed genes are quantified using fold
  change of tumor versus compendium in (a), and primary tumor versus the tumor recurrence
  in (b): 1 arrow is FC ≥2; 2 arrows is FC ≥10; and 3 arrows is FC ≥50. CNV, copy
  number variation.'
