caption: Interaction map of the Notch signaling pathway. Arrows and blunt headed lines
  indicate activation and inhibition, respectively. Dotted arrows suggest the expression
  of a protein from a gene and dashed lines indicate the formation of a complex. Proteins
  and genes are shown by rectangles and ovals, respectively. The dark shaded regions
  signify cells and the big white oval is the nucleus.
