caption: Cellular signal pathway diagram of hypothermia at 4 h after temperature intervention.
  Under the condition of OGD/R, hypothermia inhibited Parkin recruitment to mitochondria
  and magnified mPTP opening via the high expression of VDAC3, and then aggravated
  the release of Cyt C through mPTP. Hypothermia also increased the expression of
  SQSTM/p62 and Beclin-1, but did not change the ratio of LC3B II/LC3B I. Finally,
  hypothermia induced apoptosis but did not promote mitophagy. The recruitment of
  Parkin from cytoplasm to mitochondria might be relevant to the overexpression of
  Bcl-2. (Cleaved PINK1, cPINK1; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; IMS, inner mitochondrial
  stroma; IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane). Red represents the different effects
  between 2 h and 4 h after hypothermia intervention
