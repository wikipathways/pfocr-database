caption: Cell-based studies have identified specific membrane and signaling events
  associated with increased extracellular Pi availability including the coordinated
  requirement of sodium dependent Pi-transporters/sensors as well as FGF receptor
  signaling. Downstream signaling proteins include the FGF receptor associated factor
  FRS2, as well as N-ras, c-raf, Mek and ERK1/2, leading to activation of transcription
  factors such as AP-1, Srf, Nrf2, and Egr-1 and expression of genes associated with
  cell growth and metabolism. A second pathway identified as Pi-responsive includes
  Akt, ERK1/2, Mnk ultimately resulting in the regulation of eIF4E-BP1, a key component
  of the protein translation machinery. A third Pi-stimulated and required cellular
  event is changes in energy metabolism including an increase in oxidative phosphorylation.
  Stimulation of these pathways have been identified in varying cell types in response
  to elevated extracellular Pi. Inhibitor studies suggest that the three pathways
  are required for different aspects of the Pi-induced alterations in cell functions
  related to altered gene expression, increased proliferation and metabolism, and
  angiogenesis.
