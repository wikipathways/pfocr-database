caption: 'a Polyamine metabolic pathway with key enzymes highlighted and the downstream
  effects on trophoblast function. Spermine regulates cellular energy metabolism to
  increase acetyl-coA availability for histone acetylation and gene expression. Inhibition
  of ODC with DFMO, silencing of SMS via siRNAs, or activating SSAT using DENSPM decreases
  spermine levels leading to dysregulation of energy metabolism, histone acetylation,
  and gene expression. b Model of the effects of sex-biased polyamine metabolism on
  trophoblast function. Top panel: under physiological conditions, the female-biased
  SMS expression results in modest changes to spermine synthesis which are unlikely
  to result in sex-biased effects of polyamines on trophoblast function. Middle panel:
  Under polyamine limiting conditions the female bias in spermine synthesis buffers
  the effects of polyamine depletion leading to marked sex differences in spermine
  levels and sex-specific regulation of trophoblast function. Bottom panel: Upon spermine
  depletion, the effects on metabolism and gene expression become apparent but the
  sex-dependent effects are not observed because the source of the sex-bias is no
  longer present. Spermine levels are represented by the pie-charts.'
