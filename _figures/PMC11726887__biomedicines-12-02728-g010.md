caption: The effect of echinacoside in HepG2 cells. ECH was observed to upregulate
  the levels of Nrf2 and its downstream HMOX-1, GPX4, and SLC7A11 while inhibiting
  the expression of ACSL4 in a MASLD cell model. The imbalance of redox reactions
  in MASLD was regulated through the Nrf2/HMOX-1/SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway, and the massive
  release of intracellular ROS was inhibited, which protected the mitochondria, inhibited
  lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane structure, and ultimately inhibited the
  occurrence of ferroptosis. ECH alleviates MASLD by inhibiting ferroptosis via the
  Nrf2/HMOX-1 pathway. The schematic diagram was drawn by figdraw
