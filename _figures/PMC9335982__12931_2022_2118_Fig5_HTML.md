caption: Diagram of the potential regulatory mechanism of PTPRO in HS-induced lung
  inflammation. PTPRO is up-regulated in the lungs after HS, which may contribute
  to NF-κB P65 phosphorylation and the translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm into
  the nucleus. Activated NF-κB in the nucleus likely initiates the transcription of
  proinflammatory genes including cytokine and chemokine, thus inducing lung inflammation
  following HS. PTPRO knockdown alleviates the HS-induced inflammation in the lungs
  by reducing the NF-κB pathway activation
