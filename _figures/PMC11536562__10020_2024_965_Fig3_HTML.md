caption: m6A modifications in fetal hematopoiesis and HSC maintenance. A Mammalian
  HSCs are first formed in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region from hemogenic
  endothelial cells (HECs) as a result of the trans-differentiation process of endothelial-to-hematopoietic
  transition (EHT). Due to interactions with different readers, m6A-modified transcripts
  contribute to EHT by promoting pro-EHT, meanwhile suppressing anti-EHT programs.
  B Nascent fetal HSCs migrate to the fetal liver, undergoing rapid and drastic proliferation.
  (C) Adult HSCs are maintained in the niche microenvironment of the bone marrow.
  The schematics of the principal m6A-regulated pathways occurring at these sites
  are shown in the bottom panel
