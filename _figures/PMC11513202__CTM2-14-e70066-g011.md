  description: Relationships between DNA methylation and sorafenib resistance in HCC.
    DNA methylation is obviously involved in sorafenib resistance for patients with
    HCC. Microrchidia 2 (MORC2) interacts with DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3A) at
    the promoters of neurofibromin 2 (NF2) and kidney and brain protein (KIBRA) genes,
    leading to DNA hypermethylation and transcription inhibition. The expression silence
    of NF2 and KIBRA significantly inactivates the Hippo pathway, thereby causing
    sorafenib resistance. Meanwhile, DNA hypermethylation also significantly reduces
    the expression of BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19
    kDa interacting protein 3‐like (BNIP3L). However, menstrual blood‐derived stem
    cells (MenSCs) effectively upregulate the expression of BNIP3 and BNIP3L by mediating
    significant DNA promoter demethylation through ten‐eleven translocation methylcytosine
    dioxygenase 2 (TET2), thereby reversing sorafenib resistance in HCC cells. Besides,
    DNA hypermethylation of long non‐coding RNA (LncRNA) H19, HDAC11, cytochrome P450
    1A2 (CYP1A2) and inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1)‐induced transcription inhibition
    also affect sorafenib resistance of HCC. Simultaneously, in sorafenib‐resistant
    HCC cells, PD‐L1 activates the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) via
    STAT3 and induces the DNA methylation of downstream genes. Furthermore, DNMT3A‐TET2
