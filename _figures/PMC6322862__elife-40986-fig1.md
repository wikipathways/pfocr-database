caption: (a) Myelinated axonal region, with glucose entry localized at the nodes of
  Ranvier. Mitochondria accumulate at nodes due to the higher glucose concentration
  (b) Unmyelinated axonal region, subject to a linear glucose gradient. Glucose permeability
  is uniform throughout, with mitochondrial accumulation occuring at the region of
  high external glucose (c) Key steps of the metabolic pathway linking glucose availability
  and mitochondrial halting. (d) Mitochondrial transport states and rates of transition
  between them ( represents retrograde and anterograde motion,  represents the stationary
  state).
