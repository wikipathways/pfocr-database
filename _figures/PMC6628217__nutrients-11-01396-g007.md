caption: A schematic illustration of the effects of SSE on insulin signaling and the
  suggested mechanism. SSE induced a low level of IR phosphorylation (1). This phosphorylation
  might be the result of phosphatase inhibition or a direct binding and activation
  of the receptor by SSE. SSE activates MAPK pathway in a similar time course as induced
  by insulin (2). SSE activates the PI3K-Akt pathway (3); although a low level of
  Akt phosphorylation is detected, Akt is translocated to the membrane and the nucleus
  (4). Metabolic effects of the PI3K-Akt pathway are regulated by SSE, similar to
  insulin effects; glucose uptake (5) is increased via Glut4-facilitated transport,
  while GSK3β is phosphorylated, indicating increased glycogen synthesis (6) and lipolysis
  inhibition as well (7). In addition, FoxO is phosphorylated and is excluded from
  the nucleus (8). PRAS40 is also phosphorylated following insulin and SSE stimulation
  in a PI3K-dependent, Akt-independent mechanism. The scheme is based on results of
  this study and on our previous data [,].
