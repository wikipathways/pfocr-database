caption: Enzymatic synthesis of hydrogen sulfide. The physiological production of
  H2S in mammalian systems has been attributed to three enzymes that are part of the
  cysteine biosynthesis pathway. Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) is predominantly found
  in the brain, nervous system, and liver. It produces H2S through a reaction involving
  the generation of cystathionine from homocysteine, serine, and cysteine. Cystathionine
  γ-lyase (CGL or CSE) is found in the vasculature and live. It produces H2S through
  a reaction involving the generation of L-cysteine, pyruvate, and ammonia from L-cystathionine
  and cysteine. 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (3MST) has been reported to
  be localized in the mitochondria and can be found in the brain and vasculature.
  It produces H2S through a reaction involving the generation of pyruvate from 3-mercaptopyruvate
  (3MP). The 3MP is provided through the metabolism of cysteine and α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG) by cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). These enzymes regulate the physiological
  levels of H2S observed in the bloodstream and tissues and are critical for H2S homeostasis.
