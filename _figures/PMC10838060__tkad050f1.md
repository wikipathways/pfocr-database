caption: Molecular mechanism of the cGAS-STING pathway. Bacteria and viruses, or some
  DAMPs, produce abnormal DNA that activates cGAS, producing cGAMP. cGAMP binds to
  STING transmembrane protein on the endoplasmic reticulum, a process inhibited by
  spongy cGAMP-STING-TBK1. After being activated by cGAMP, STING forms dimers and
  recruits TBK1 for ubiquitination. However, this ubiquitination is blocked by nitro-fatty
  acids, hERK2 and Mtp53. After activation, the connection of STING to STIM1 is cut
  off, and STING is transferred to the ERGIC together with TBK1, which in turn undergoes
  trans-autophosphorylation activation of TBK1, followed by tetramerization of STING
  to provide a phosphorylation site for IRF3 and subsequent phosphorylation of IRF3
  by TBK1, producing IFN. Additionally, the NF-κB pathway is also activated by TBK1.
  Some inflammatory factors produced by these processes can lead to the production
  of senescence phenotype and the infiltration of inflammatory cells. cGAS cyclic
