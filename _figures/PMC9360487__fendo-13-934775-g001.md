caption: Proglucagon-derived products signal through the beta-cell glucagon-like peptide
  1 (GLP-1) receptor and glucagon receptor to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin
  secretion (GSIS). The triggering pathway for beta-cell insulin secretion is activated
  by ATP generation following the influx of glucose. The increase in intracellular
  ATP induces closure of ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) channels, resulting in membrane depolarization
  and the subsequent opening of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The rise in intracellular
  Ca2+ concentrations triggers exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. Stimulation
  of the beta-cell GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucagon receptor (GCGR) results in
  activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to increase cAMP production, and the activation
  of EPAC and protein kinase A (PKA). EPAC and PKA further increase intracellular
  Ca2+ concentrations, allowing for the potentiation of GSIS.
