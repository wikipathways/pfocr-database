caption: (A) Autophagy prevents p62/NRF2 pathway prosurvival, proangiogenic, and proinflammatory
  signaling. During hypoxia, p62 binds to and sequesters KEAP, thereby preventing
  ubiquitination of NRF2. NRF2 can then promote transcription of prosurvival, proangiogenic,
  and proinflammatory genes that enhance tumor growth. When autophagy is active, p62
  is degraded by sequestration within the autophagolysosome, thereby allowing ubiquitination
  and degradation of NRF2. (B) Autophagy prevents necrosis and inflammation by promoting
  survival in stressed cells. Tumor cells with decreased autophagy (AΦ) are more prone
  to necrosis following stress, which recruits macrophages, promotes inflammation,
  and fuels tumor growth. (C) Autophagy promotes oncogene-induced senescence by enhancing
  the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). (D) Autophagy suppresses reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and genomic damage, which helps prevent genomic
  instability—an important driver of tumorigenesis. The mitochondria produce ROS under
  normal metabolic conditions and may increase the production of ROS when damaged.
  Mitophagy is upregulated in response to ROS and clears excess and damaged mitochondria,
  which then mitigates ROS production.
