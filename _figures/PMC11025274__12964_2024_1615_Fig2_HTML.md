caption: 'The mechanisms by which the gut microbiota promotes CRC metastasis by targeting
  seeds. (1) Promote the EMT process: F. nucleatum induces the formation and release
  of NETs from neutrophils by activating TLR4-ROS signaling and NLR1/2, and with consequent
  reduced expression of E-cadherin as well as increased expression of N-cadherin and
  vimentin in CRC cells captured by NETs. F. nucleatum also activates the downstream
  effector kinases AKT and ERK via EGFR. Fn-Dps, a novel virulence molecule produced
  by F. nucleatum, stimulates macrophages to secrete CCL2/7, thereby regulating the
  expression of related factors involved in EMT. F. nucleatum upregulates EVADR levels,
  which guide the RNA-binding protein YBX1 to recruit Snail, Slug, and Zeb1, to polysomes.
  F. Nucleatum infection decreases the level of the miR-122-5p, resulting in the overexpression
  of FUT8 to activate TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway, inducing a decrease in E-cadherin
  levels and an increase in N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail and Slug levels. (2) Promote
  the self-renewal of CSCs to enhance the stemness: F. nucleatum binds to CEACAM-1
  on CSCs via CbpF to cause the dissociation of CEACAM-1 from SHP-2, triggering Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling. The gut microbiota metabolite IVA inhibits the enrichment of the NuRD
  complex on the Tph2 promoter to initiate Tph2 transcription, leading to the synthesis
  of 5-HT in the gut, which subsequently promotes the interaction of HTR1B/1D/1F with
  Axin1 to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. (3) a few CTCs that undergo EMT can survive
  the blood circulation, and these CTC subpopulations have the CSCs phenotype. Of
  note, treatment with metronidazole significantly reduced F. nucleatum load and inhibiting
  mCRC, while vancomycin is ineffective against F. nucleatum and can even increase
  its proportion in the intestines of healthy people, destroying the original intestinal
  environment. The Figure was created with BioRender.com. Abbreviations: 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine;
