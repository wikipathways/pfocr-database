caption: Neurons can utilize either astrocyte-derived or transsulfuration-derived
  cysteine for GSH synthesis; however, higher levels of cystathionine in human brain
  indicate impaired transsulfuration, increasing the importance of the former cellular
  uptake pathway. GSH levels are a primary determinant of cellular redox status, and
  oxidative stress can inhibit MS activity by multiple mechanisms, as described herein,
  including oxidation of Cbl(I), down-regulation of transcription, or alternative
  mRNA splicing with deletion of the cap domain. Oxidative stress restricts dopamine-stimulated
  phospholipid methylation, since it is dependent upon MS activity.
