caption: Golgi proteins roles in tumor dissemination and invasion. Golgi proteins
  are involved in multiple processes linked to tumor aggressiveness, such as the secretion
  of MMPs, cell migration and regulation of apico-basal polarity, and their roles
  have been assessed in different tumors. This picture summarizes the different Golgi
  signaling proteins involved in regulating specific MMPs secretion, the Golgi-localized
  proteins that are part of the CDC-42 complex for directed cell migration, and finally
  the PKD signaling pathway that promotes the maintenance of apico-basal polarity.
