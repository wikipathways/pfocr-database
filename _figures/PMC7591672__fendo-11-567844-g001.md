caption: Schematic illustration of tumor microenvironment in the bone. At the left
  side of the panel is the osteocyte and the right side is the breast cancer cell.
  These cells interact in a bone catabolic environment. The numbers indicate the steps
  of events that may happen during breast metastasis described in the review. ① The
  vicious cycle; cancer cells interact with monocytes to increase the osteoclast number
  and activity in order to release growth factors embedded in the bone. ② RANKL expressed
  by osteocytes and cancer cells increases the recruitment of monocytes and stimulates
  the osteoclast differentiation. ③ Under this condition osteocytes increase the release
  of Sost and DKK1 that inhibit osteoblast activity and increase the expression of
  RANKL. ④ Notch signaling pathway induces apoptosis in the osteocytes and increases
  the proliferation of cancer cells. ⑤ Osteocytes apoptosis signals promote osteoclasts
  for bone resorption. ⑥ eATP is hydrolyzed to adenosine through CD39/CD73 enzyme
  activation, and generated adenosine activates adenosine receptor in cancer cells,
  leading to increased proliferation, migration, and metastasis. ⑦ Extracellular adenosine
  increases osteoclast activity, ⑧ also promotes Treg activity, and increases immune
  tolerance.
