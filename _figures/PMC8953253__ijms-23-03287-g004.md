caption: Schematic representation of OSM-induced signaling pathways in osteoblasts.
  OSM binding to the type I receptor complex activates STAT3 and JNK and regulates
  RANKL and sclerostin (SOST) expression. In addition to the gp130-mediated pathways
  common for LIFR and OSMR, the OSM receptor binding to the type II complex phosphorylates
  OSMR on Tyr861, resulting in docking and phosphorylation of the adapter molecule
  Shc1. The activated pShc1 is recruited to the Grb2:Sos complex, which in turn induces
  a Ras/Raf/MAPK cascade that ultimately activates ERK. The Shc1-mediated signaling
  pathway (right) is suggested to explain the stronger effects of OSM on expression
  of osteoclastogenic factors, osteoclast formation and bone resorption in comparison
  to activation of the LIFR:gp130 complex by LIF (left). This pathway also regulates
  Wnt16 expression that suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Figure slightly
