caption: 'The transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-dependent signalling pathway depends
  on Type I and Type II serine-threonine kinase receptors and transcription factors
  known as SMADs. The dimeric bioactive ligand binds to a Type II receptor, which
  in turn phosphorylates and activates a Type I receptor. Once the Type I receptor
  is activated, it phosphorylates the receptor SMADs (R-SMADs: SMAD2 and SMAD3), which
  promotes their interaction with the common mediator SMAD (SMAD4) and translocation
  to the nucleus. The inhibitory SMAD7 negatively regulates TGFβ signalling by competing
  with R-SMADs for interaction with the Type I receptor or SMAD4. Current TGFβ signalling
  inhibitors (listed in  ans shown in scheme) include ligand, receptor and SMAD antagonists.
  However, additional SMAD-independent pathways have been reported to be induced in
  response to TGFβ, including the activation of MAPK, Rho-like GTPase and phosphatidylinositol
  3-Kinase (PI3K) signalling pathways; a complete understanding of these alternative
  pathways could potentially offer additional downstream molecules that could be targeted
  in future therapeutic approaches. (Figure adapted from )'
