caption: Molecular mechanism of combined treatment-induced growth inhibition in MPNST
  cells. Combination of cordycepin and FT895 reduces protein levels of TEAD1 and TAZ,
  which may further downregulate the transcription of α-tubulin, KIF18A, p53, Sp1
  and even TEAD1 itself. Suppression of p53 and Sp1 causes apoptosis, and reduction
  of α-tubulin and KIF18A leads to abnormal number of chromosomes (aneuploidy). Self-regulation
  of TEAD1 can further reduce the expression of α-tubulin, KIF18A, p53 and Sp1.
