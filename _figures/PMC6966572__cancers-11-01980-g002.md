caption: 'PARP inhibitors in combination with other therapeutics. Abbreviations: C
  = chemotherapy; R = radiotherapy; cGAS = cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; cGMP=cyclic guanosine
  monophosphate; STING = stimulator of interferon genes; IRF3 = interferon regulatory
  factor 3; TBK1 = TANK binding kinase 1; NF-κB = nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; IFN = interferon. (Upper panel): PARP inhibitors in combination
  with chemotherapy and radiation therapy (A) Chemotherapy agents like platinum containing
  compounds and topoisomerase inhibitors and radiation therapy lead DNA damage. (B)
  DNA breaks lead to upregulation of PARP enzymes. (C) In normal healthy cells, PARP-1
  binds to DNA damage site leading to poly ADP-ribose formation, recruitment of DNA
  repair proteins. This process leads to successful repair of DNA and cell survival.
  (D) PARPi binds to catalytic site PARP enzyme and traps PARP-1 at the NA damage
  site. This leads to defective DNA repair and eventually, cell death. (Lower Panel):
  (1) PARPi lead to double strand (ds) DNA breaks, (2) dsDNA breaks lead to generation
  of cytosolic DNA fragments, (3) Cytoplasmic dsDNA activates cGAS, (4) Activation
  of cGAS catalyzes production of cGMP, (5) cGMP activates STING pathway, (6–8) STING
  pathway in return activates either NF- κB or TBK1- IRF3-Type I IFN pathway. (9)
  Activation of Type I IFN pathway alters tumor immune microenvironment through upregulation
  of PDL-1 and MHC and increased CXCL9, 10, CCR7 leading to enhanced cytotoxic T cell,
  helper T cells and dendritic cell function. (10) Homologous recombinant deficient
  tumors secrete a higher neoantigen load that is associated with an increased number
  of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.'
