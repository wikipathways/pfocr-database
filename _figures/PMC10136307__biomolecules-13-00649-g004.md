caption: Proposed ER-related mechanisms in the induction of autophagy and UPR in β
  cells. The ER stress can induce autophagy through PERK, IRE1α, and the ATF6α signaling
  pathway. The ER stress pathway is caused by hyperglycemia and upon accumulation
  of misfolded and unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Activation of IRE1α results
  in the generation of active sXBP1. The ATF6α is transported to the Golgi apparatus,
  where it is activated. sXBP1 and the activated ATF6α cause decreased protein burden
  in the ER. Activation of IRE1α also triggers the JNK signaling cascade, which in
  turn leads to disruption of the Bcl-2/Beclin-1 interaction through phosphorylation
  of Bcl-2 and, therefore, induces autophagy. The IRE1α branch of UPR activation of
  JNK causes phosphorylation of Bcl2, which results in the dissociation of Beclin-1
  and, thus, autophagy induction. Another arm of UPR-activated PERK induces autophagy
  via expression of ATG12 and ATG16L via ATF4 transcription factor; similarly, CHOP
  activates TRIB3, which blocks the activity of AKT/mTOR pathway-induced autophagy.
  ATF6α branch of UPR can also induce autophagy by inhibiting phosphorylation at AKT
  and mTOR pathways.
