caption: Possible pathways of apoptosis inhibition by Brucella. VceC triggers ER stress
  and activates the PEPK metabolic pathway to induce apoptosis; in addition, the activated
  IRE1 pathway inhibits apoptosis. BspJ interacts with host proteins NME2 and CKB
  to inhibit apoptosis. BspG interacts with host proteins PCBP1, KMT5C, NDUFS6, PCNA,
  CIAO2B, and SDHB to inhibit apoptosis. BspF inhibits apoptosis by affecting P53
  expression. The outer membrane protein Omp31 inhibits the TNF-α-CytC-Caspase9 mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathway and the TNF-α-Caspase8-Caspase3 classical apoptotic pathway. Brucella
  infection leads to increased calcium ion concentration, activation of the E3 ubiquitin
  ligase Nedd4, promotion of calpain ubiquitination and degradation, and inhibition
  of the Caspase-3 apoptotic pathway. The outer membrane proteins Omp25 and LPS-O
  polysaccharide inhibit apoptosis; zinc finger protein A20 is involved in apoptosis
  but is not the only factor
