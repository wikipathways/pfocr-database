caption: 'Function and location of MESD in the WNT signaling pathway (in bone cells)(A)
  Canonical WNT signaling involves binding of WNT proteins to the frizzled receptor
  (FZD) and to the co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6. Formation of this complex leads to
  the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), which phosphorylates β-catenin.
  Unphosphorylated β-catenin is safeguarded from proteosomal degradation, accumulates,
  and moves into the nucleus where it triggers lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)/T cell
  factor (TCF)-mediated gene transcription. MESD is thought to play a role in the
  folding of the WNT co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 and in chaperoning their transit to
  the cell surface; the C-terminal REDL ER-retention sequence of MESD allows for retrieval
  from the Golgi.(B and C) Close-up views of aberrant MESD signaling in mice and humans.
  LRP5/6 do not fold properly in Mesd knockout mice and appear to aggregate in the
  RER (B). We hypothesize that the mutant MESD proteins described in this report have
  (residual) chaperone activity to signal LRP5/6 to the cell surface but fail for
  retrieval from the Golgi since they lack the REDL sequence (C). This leads to disturbed
  WNT signaling in bone (LRP5) and tooth development (LRP6).(D) Legend of most important
  protein structures in MESD-related WNT signaling: KDELR receptor, red; wild-type
  (WT) and mutant MESD proteins with/loss of REDL, blue/green; LRP5/6, gray/green/cyan/orange.'
