caption: RNAi pathways in Drosophila. (a) The antiviral siRNA pathway. Dicer-2 cuts
  dsRNA into siRNAs, which are loaded into an Argonaute-containing RISC that targets
  RNA for degradation. (b) The miRNA pathway. Primary miRNAs are transcribed from
  the genome, processed by Drosha and Dicer-1 into mature miRNAs. These are loaded
  into the Argonaute-containing effector complex (RISC), which binds mRNAs and recruits
  additional factors to inhibit translation. (c) The ‘ping-pong’ model of TE silencing
  in the Drosophila germ line. Aubergine and Argonaute-3 (Piwi family Argonautes)
  alternately cleave sense (red) and antisense (blue) transcripts from TEs, guided
  by piRNAs generated in the other half of the cycle. Cleavage both inactivates the
  transcript and generates the 5′ end of a new piRNA. The new piRNA-precursor is bound
  by the partner Piwi family member and the 3′ end degraded and then modified by the
  addition of a methyl group (Me). The nuclear localization of Piwi suggests that
  it might mediate heterochromatin assembly (). It is unknown how this occurs, but
  one possibility is that the active Piwi complex binds nascent TE transcripts to
  recruit heterochromatin factors (). Recently, a fourth pathway has been identified,
  which targets TE transcripts in both the soma and the germ line, using Dcr-2 and
  Ago-2 from the antiviral pathway, but Loqs from the miRNA pathway (; ).
