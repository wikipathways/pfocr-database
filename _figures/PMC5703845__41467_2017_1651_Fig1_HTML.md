caption: Schematic to illustrate how dual delivery of OX and IND may impact the anti-PDAC
  immune response. We hypothesized that nano-enabled co-delivery of a chemotherapeutic
  agent, which provides an ICD stimulus, and IND, which interferes in the IDO pathway,
  may combine to trigger a robust PDAC immune response. OX (#1) induces an ICD response
  (#2) in which CRT expression on the dying tumor cell surfaces provides an “eat-me”
  signal for DC uptake, as well as the release of HMGB-1 and ATP that deliver adjuvant
  stimuli to DC (#3). Following uptake of the dying tumor cells by DC, their maturation
  and cross-presentation of endogenous tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) (#4), the
  recruitment and activation of CD8+ T cells (#5) will lead to granulysin and perforin
  mediated killing of primary (#6) and metastatic cancer cells (#7). The concomitant
  delivery of IND-PL (#8) interferes in the IDO metabolic pathway, which can lead
  to strengthening the ICD effect by interfering in Treg development and overcome
  other immunomodulatory effects (#9). The ICD pathway also allows the activation
  of helper and memory T cells, which prevent disease recurrence (#10). Following
  proof-of-prinipal testing of this scheme, we also discovered that IND syngergistically
  enhances the ICD effect, providing more than just an additive outcome  (#11)
