caption: TOLLIP-mediated regulation of IL-1R signaling. In resting cells, TOLLIP forms
  a complex with IRAK-1, and upon stimulation with IL-1β, this complex translocates
  and binds to the TIR cytoplasmic domain of IL-1R. Co-recruited adaptor proteins
  induce the phosphorylation of IRAK-1, dissociation from the complex, and binding
  to TRAF6, which activates the NF-κB signaling, as described in Figure 1. TOLLIP
  decreases IL-1R-induced inflammation by promoting the endosomal degradation of ubiquitinated
  IL-1R. Overexpression of TOLLIP inhibits the NF-κB pathway and the expression of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRAK-1. IL-1β, interleukin
  1β; TOLLIP, Toll-interacting protein; IRAK-1, interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1; TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated factor 6; NEMO, nuclear factor-κB essential
  modulator; IKKα/β, inhibitory kappa B kinase α/β; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB. Created
