caption: Upon encountering RS, the replicating fork has two basic response pathways
  to choose from – the RSR and TLS. Ideally, in RSR, the replicating fork slows replication
  and reverses into a reversed “chicken foot” conformation. The reversed fork structure
  can then (A) recruit nucleases to initiate DNA repair and/or contribute to replication
  restart or (B) due to excessive nuclease coupled fork degradation can lead to a
  “hyper-resected” fork that ultimately results in fork collapse. Another possibility
  is that the stressed fork can avoid fork reversal and (C) continue with replication
  despite stress by either firing new replication origins or by initiating re-priming
  few bases downstream all of which can result in the formation of ssDNA gaps which
  can contribute to reduced cell fitness and trigger cell death pathways. On the contrary,
  the replicating fork may activate the TLS pathway to overcome the RS barrier by
  either (D) promoting unrestrained replication without ssDNA gaps by the virtue of
  its gap suppression (GS) function or may choose to (E) bypass any stress induced
  lesion to favor continued replication which is then (F) revisited post replication
  to perform repair and fill in the gap left near the site of DNA lesion. TLS thus
  acts as an alternative pathway to the RSR that aids replication and favors cell
  survival.
