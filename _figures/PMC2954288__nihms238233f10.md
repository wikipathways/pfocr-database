caption: Hypothetical model for SWAP-70 function in mast cell FcεRI signaling. For
  more discussion see text. Several of the processes indicated here occur at the cytoplasmic
  membrane, and there are certainly levels of crosstalk between these processes that
  are not illustrated. The LAT-Ras-ERK pathway is adopted from Gu et al., 2001. The
  Akt-mediated inhibitory effect of SWAP-70 on ERK cannot be less potent than the
  stimulatory effect of SWAP-70 through LAT on ERK, for ERK becomes hyperactivated
  in the absence of SWAP-70. It cannot be excluded that SWAP-70 also acts directly
  on PLCγ, ERK, Akt, and/or PI3K. SWAP-70 inhibition of the negative effect of IL4
  on PI3K supports PI3K activity. Based on our earlier reports, we hypothesize that
  many or all of the effects of SWAP-70 shown here are exercised through control of
  RhoGTPases and F-actin rearrangements of membrane-proximal cytoskeletal structures
  and their associated signaling molecules.
