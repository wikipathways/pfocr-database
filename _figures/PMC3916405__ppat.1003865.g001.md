caption: In most differentiated cells, PRRs (e.g., RIG-I, OAS-1/RNaseL, PKR) recognize
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns and stimulate the protein-based interferon
  response. The RNAi pathway functions, through miRNAs, to temper the expression of
  cytotoxic transcripts, but is inhibited in response to stress and antiviral signaling
  pathway activation. In undifferentiated/pluripotent cells, the interferon response
  is attenuated through reduced expression and activity of numerous components. In
  these cells, the RNAi pathway can function directly as an antiviral defense, using
  longer, virally derived dsRNA to generate siRNAs that target and silence viral transcripts.
