caption: The brief interactions between blood circulation and the liver are depicted.
  The gut microbiota might contribute to the systemic metabolic disorder. PTX administration
  could upregulate the expression of genes and proteins related to fatty acid β-oxidation
  and thereby ameliorate the fatty liver in the mice with combined NAFLD and T2D.
  Furthermore, the glycolysis pathway and BCAA-related pathways could be upregulated
  by PTX. The red and yellow arrows represent significant (P < 0.05) and moderate
  (P > 0.05) changes induced by PTX. The arrow direction indicates PTX-induced upregulation
  or downregulation.
