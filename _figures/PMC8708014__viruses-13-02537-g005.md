caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of genes regulated in the bronchial mucosa model
  developed at air–liquid interface (bro-ALI). bro-ALI was exposed to 10 nM recombinant
  SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 for 24 h. Genes associated with significantly enriched
  functions and disease terms (a) COVID-19; (b) anti-viral response; and (c) interferon
  signaling. Significantly regulated genes are highlighted in red/green for up- or
  downregulation. Legend for network shapes is provided in .
