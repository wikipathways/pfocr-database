caption: The potential mechanism of action of miR-145 and miR-210 in cancer cells.
  PI3k/AKT signaling is often constitutively activated in cancer. Inactivation of
  FOXO1 and subsequent inhibition of miR-145 expression by the PI3K/AKT pathway favors
  cell survival, proliferation, and expansion of the CSC population and increases
  self-renewal and tumorigenic capacity. Activation of STAT3 induces cancer cell survival
  by inducing the expression of c-Myc. miR-210 inhibits SOCS1 and activates the STAT3
  pathway favoring cell survival.
