caption: The metabolism of amino acids and lipid. (A) Cysteine is transported into
  the cell, and glutamate is transported out of the cell by system Xc- at the same
  time. Cysteine is used to synthesize GSH to maintain the balance of redox states.
  Besides, cysteine can be synthesized by the transsulfuration pathway, which is blocked
  by CARS. (B) Glutamate is converted into α-KG by transaminase or GLUD1 pathway and
  participates in TCA, which results in ROS production. (C) PUFAs which mainly stem
  from the cellular membrane are catalyzed into PUFA-PE by ACSL4 and LPCAT. PUFA-PE
  is peroxided by the LOX family. (D) FSP1 depends on the balance of redox. CoQ is
  synthesized by the mevalonate pathway and plays an important role in the CoQ antioxidant
  system.
