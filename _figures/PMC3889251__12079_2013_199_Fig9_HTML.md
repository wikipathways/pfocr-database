caption: New proposed model of BMP2-induced C2C12 cells differentiation. Release of
  CK2 from different CK2-BMPRIa interaction sited regulates differentiation into osteoblasts
  (release from CK2.2, aa 324–328) via activation of Smad4 and mTor signaling pathways
  or via ERK/MEK signaling pathway (release from CK2.3, aa 213–217), and adipocytes
  (release from CK2.2, aa 324–328) by activation of Smad4, p38, and MEK signaling
  pathways
