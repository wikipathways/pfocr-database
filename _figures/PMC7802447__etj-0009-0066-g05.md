caption: Biased positive allosteric modulators (agonists) of the TSHR. Schemes of
  biased interaction in the allosteric binding pocket (blue). a C2 [] activates only
  cAMP and not the β-arrestin pathway. b D3 [] recruits only β-arrestin 1 and thereby
  activates the MAPK-ERK1/2 pathway. Gαs is not activated. c BSM1 [] activates only
  Gαq and neither Gαs nor Gα12–13. d Extracellular bound TSH activates all 3 pathways.
  In conclusion, different intramolecular signaling pathways are present in the TSHR,
  which could be blocked individually by small molecules.
