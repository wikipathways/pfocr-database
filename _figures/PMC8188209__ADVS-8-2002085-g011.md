caption: A schematic depiction of the glymphatic pathway. This diagram shows that
  CSF arrives in the brain through paravascular paths, by passing the glia limitans,
  washes the brain parenchyma, mixes with ISF, leaves the brain parenchyma through
  the opposite‐side glia limitans, and is cleared from the brain via paravenous paths.
  In this diagram, two different sizes of NPs are shown (small and large). Large NPs
  will stay within the arteriole paravascular path, while small NPs will cross the
  glia limitans and reach the brain parenchyma. The small NPs may leave the brain
  by following the convective flow of ISF. In addition, large NCs may release their
  cargo in the basement membrane due to degradation by enzymes such as MMP‐9. The
  cargo would be distributed within the brain by the convective flow of the ISF in
  the brain.
