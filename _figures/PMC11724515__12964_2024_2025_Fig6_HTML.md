caption: 'SIRT1 regulates the balance between lipogenic and osteogenic differentiation
  of mesenchymal stem cells. Quercetin up-regulated SIRT1 through AMPK/SIRT1 signaling
  pathway, ucOC activated SIRT1 through PKA/ AMPK/SIRT1 axis, and APN activated SIRT1
  through AdipoR1/AMPK pathway to promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. In the
  ROS/GAS5/SIRT1 pathway, GAS5 inhibited adipogenesis and promoted osteogenesis through
  the miR-23b-3p/SIRT1 pathway. After being activated by melatonin, SIRT1 restores
  the balance between osteogenic differentiation and adipogenesis by inhibiting PPARγ
  signaling pathway and activating RUNX2 signaling pathway. atECM could inhibit the
  expression of Runx2. Abbreviation: MSCs, marrow mesenchymal stem cells; ucOC, undercarboxylated
  osteocalcin; atECM, extracellular matrix of adipose tissue (https://gdp.renlab.cn/#/)'
