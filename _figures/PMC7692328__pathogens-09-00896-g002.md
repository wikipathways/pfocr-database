caption: The induction and the pathway for the potential contribution of Cav-1 to
  the establishment of HIV latency. The presence of Caveolin-1 increases in HIV-1
  infected and in latently infected cells by the generation of ROS. This increase
  in Cav-1 interferes with the cell cycle regulation that adds to the HIV latency.
  Simultaneously, increased Cav-1 alters cholesterol trafficking and thus the lipid
  raft composition, which directly and indirectly interferes with the interaction
  with Cav-1 and the virus’ envelop. Changes at the lipid raft that recruits signaling
  components alters the overall cellular signaling and initiates transcriptional suppression
  that further adds to the latency process.
