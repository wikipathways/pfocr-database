caption: (A) Detailed scheme of the modeled metabolic pathways. The numbered arrows
  correspond to reactions from . Extensions to the original model of glycolysis are
  indicated by colored shapes. Boundary metabolites are in bold, glycosomal Rib-5-P
  is a boundary metabolite in model C and D. (B) Schematic overview of the different
  models, each consisting of a unique combination of the colored modules described
  in (A) and . Model C and D can alternatively utilize fructose (model Cfru and Dfru),
  but this branch is switched off unless specifically mentioned.
