caption: Model of the effects of gambogic acid (GBA) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated
  raw 264.7 cells. LPS triggers multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including
  the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
  pathways. Activation of the NF- κB signaling pathway increases inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS), which produces nitric oxide (NO) and promotes pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Pro-inflammatory genes, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6
  (IL-6) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), are upregulated upon activation of the MAPK signaling
  pathway. Low concentrations of GBA suppresses phosphorylation of p38; however, high
  concentrations of GBA has broader effects on both the MAPK and NF- κB signaling
  pathways, attenuating the release of pro-inflammatory factors.
