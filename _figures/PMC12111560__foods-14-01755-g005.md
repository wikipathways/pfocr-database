caption: The expression profile of candidate genes involved in the organic acid metabolic
  pathway in pomegranate. The heatmap of each DEG was constructed based on log2 (TPM)
  and the values were rowscaled. The color range from red to blue represents the log2
  (TPM) value, in which red color denotes genes with high expression levels, and blue
  color means low expression. ACO, aconitase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; CS, citric
  acid synthase; GABP, γ–aminobutyric acid transport; ICL, isocitric acid lyase; ME,
  malic acid enzyme; OAA, oxaloacetate; PDC, pyruvate Decarboxylase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
  The probable direction of reversible reactions is indicated by the large arrow
