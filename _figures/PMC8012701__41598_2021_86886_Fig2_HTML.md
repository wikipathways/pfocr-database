caption: Lipid metabolisms change in dormant cancer cells. (a) Cholesterol metabolism
  involved in 3D cultured S500 and S125 spheroids. S500 spheroids displayed higher
  cholesterol metabolism than S125 spheroids. Genes were selected from the “Cholesterol
  metabolism (includes both Bloch and Kandutsch–Russell pathways) (Homo sapiens)”
  pathway according to Wikipathways. Red indicates increased expression, and green
  denotes decreased expression. (b) The mRNA expression of acyl-CoA synthetase medium
  chain family member 3. (c) The mRNA expression of acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain
  family member 2. All mRNA expression analyses were conducted using Transcriptome
  Analysis Console ver. 4.0.1.36. Genes with changes in expression exceeding 1.5-fold
  and significant at p < 0.05 genes were extracted. n = 2.
