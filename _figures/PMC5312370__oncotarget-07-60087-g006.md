caption: The schematic shows the signaling cascade from a receptor tyrosine kinase
  to the nucleus. We have highlighted some of the key proteins that were directly
  inhibited by small molecules and where they ranked in order of efficacy with RAD51
  depletion. Due to a K-RAS mutation in MDA-MB-231 cells PI3K is highly active, however
  RAD51 depletion resulted in ERK1/2 activation. This is why the PKC and MEK were
  lowly ranked targets compared to S6K and p38 (Ranking obtained from Table 1). We
  suggest that the ability of RAD51 to bind c/EBPβ can increase expression of key
  components of the signaling pathway. This is supported by the observation of RAD51-mediated
  changes in actin dynamics via p38 signaling to HSP27.
