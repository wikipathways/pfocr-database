caption: The proposed EET mechanism of C.i when cocultured with G.s; C.i catabolized
  ethanol for the generation of acetaldehyde by ethanol dehydrogenases (ADHs) and
  further oxidized to acetate by acetaldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), and electrons
  were released and accumulated as NADH during this process simultaneously; in the
  coculture, G.s fused its cell with C.i by which the cytochrome-based EET pathway
  of G.s integrated with the energy metabolic pathway of C.i and thereafter discharged
  the C.i cell for NADH oxidation; such process contributed to the formation of proton
  motive force for the energy generation of C.i; at the same time, the electrons transferred
  into G.s and finally used for the reduction of extracellular electron acceptors
  with the energy generated in G.s concomitantly; here, the two species formed an
  energetic coupling that enabled both ethanol oxidation and extracellular electron
  acceptor reduction synchronously; Cyts is cytochromes
