caption: Alterations in the steroid biosynthesis pathway in congenital adrenal hyperplasia
  (CAH). Deficient enzymes are shown in the coloured boxes. Deficiencies in 21-hydroxylase
  (CYP21A2) (pink box), 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) (maroon box) and 11β-hydroxylase
  (CYP11B1) (light pink box) result in CAH. In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which causes
  about 95% of cases of CAH, production of cortisol and synthesis of aldosterone are
  reduced and accumulation of precursors such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone leads to increased
  androgen production, which cause virilisation of female genitalia. Steroids produced
  in excess in 21-hydroxylase deficiency are shown in italics. CAH = congenital adrenal
  hyperplasia. Adapted with permission from Auchus et al.
