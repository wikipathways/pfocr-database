caption: Figure 3. Models illustrating TDY function in promoting symplastic trafficking
  of SHR during phloem development. (A) TDY1/2 function is hypothesized to regulate
  SHR protein trafficking through PD from its site of synthesis in vascular procambium
  cells into phloem initial cells. In the phloem initial cells, SHR promotes APL expression
  leading to phloem differentiation. (B) Mutations in Tdy genes may reduce dose-dependent
  trafficking of SHR protein, leading to the tdy green and yellow leaf variegation
  phenotype. We hypothesize that a threshold of SHR protein in phloem initial cells
  is required during a limited developmental window for normal development. The amount
  of SHR protein in phloem initials varies in response to the environment and genotype.
  Wild-type cells exceed the threshold and develop green leaf tissue. tdy1; tdy2 double
  mutant plants restrict SHR movement, which results in a SHR concentration below
  the threshold and the formation of yellow leaves. Single mutants in tdy1 or tdy2
  or plants doubly heterozygous for tdy1/+; tdy2/+ result in a SHR concentration close
  to the threshold. Environmental and genotypic fluctuations in SHR concentration
  result in some cells exceeding the threshold and developing as green leaf tissues,
  whereas other cells have a SHR concentration below the threshold and develop as
  yellow leaf tissues. The threshold of SHR activity is only meaningful during early
  phloem development, and once past this time, the leaf variegation phenotype is fixed.
