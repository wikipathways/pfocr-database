caption: 'The influence of the iron uptake system on both nematodes and the associated
  microbiome is a topic of considerable interest and importance in the field of biological
  research. This system plays a crucial role in the interactions between these microscopic
  organisms and their surrounding microbial communities, ultimately affecting their
  growth and development. Bottom figure: The pathways for Hem and ferrous iron absorption
  operate independently but are closely regulated together. Elevated intracellular
  iron causes the Holo Fur complex to bind to iron uptake gene regulators, effectively
  silencing their expression (1). If the iron concentration inside cells is low, Holo
  Fur liberates Fe2+ iron, resulting in the formation of Apo Fur (2). When Apo Fur
  can’t bind to regulatory sites, it leaves them available, which in turn supports
  the expression of genes that are crucial for iron uptake (3, 4). To capture ferric
  iron, bacteria create and secrete siderophores, which are specialized compounds
  that chelate iron, into the extracellular space (5). The receptors located in the
  outer membrane, which depend on TonB, recognize the Fe3+-siderophore complex, resulting
  in a shift in the configuration of the channel’s plug domain to enable its internalization
  (6). The TonB system is energized by ExbB and ExbD through an electrochemical charge
  gradient along the cytoplasmic membrane, allowing the Fe3+ -siderophore complex
  to be discharged into the periplasm (7). Additionally, binding proteins located
  in the periplasm facilitate the transfer of the complex to the corresponding ABC
  transporter, which then moves it into the cytoplasm (8). Below figure: The nematode
  C. elegans faces threats from various pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa, while
  maintaining essential immune responses such as the p38 MAPK pathway (1). C. elegans’
  adaptation to food and pathogens can result in compromises (2), such as diminished
  reproductive output, accelerated growth, immune system engagement, and depletion
  of body lipids. Various pathogens attack specific cellular mechanisms and organelles
  in the host, especially those rich in iron like mitochondria. Acting as the energy
  factories of cells, mitochondria are key contributors to the generation of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) (3). ROS play a role in signaling at physiological levels,
  but when present in excess, they can damage biomolecules and disturb iron balance
  (4). This figure was generated using BioRender software version 04'
