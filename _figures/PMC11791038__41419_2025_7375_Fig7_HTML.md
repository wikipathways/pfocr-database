caption: When FAM210B is overexpressed in LUAD cells, it interacts with TOM70, leading
  to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. This activation of IRF3
  enhances the expression and secretion of IFN-α/β, which then binds to its receptor
  and activates the STAT1/IRF9 pathway. As a result, the expression of ISGs like IFIT3,
  MDA-5, and RIG-I is induced, which in turn suppresses LUAD cell proliferation, migration,
  and invasion. Elevated levels of MDA-5 and RIG-I further stimulate the innate immune
  response, with FAM210B playing a role in amplifying IFN-α/β expression

  to impede the progression of lung adenocarcinoma
