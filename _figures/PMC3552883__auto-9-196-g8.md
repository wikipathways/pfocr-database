caption: Figure 8. Signaling pathways underlying UA-induced cytoprotective autophagy
  in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. UA at relatively low concentrations induced
  autophagy which in turn led to activation of UPR including EIF2AK3 pathway. Activation
  of EIF2AK3 suppressed UA-mediated apoptosis through upregulation of MCL1. UA-induced
  cytoprotective autophagy was attributed to MAPK1/3 activation but not associated
  with MTOR inhibition.
