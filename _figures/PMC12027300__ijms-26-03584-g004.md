caption: Schematic representation of the upregulation of cellular proteins that control
  influenza viral pathogenicity. Influenza viruses directly promote the expression
  of many cellular proteins (red arrows) that are involved in diverse signaling pathways.
  Viral HA induces the expression of ICAM-1 as well as proinflammatory cytokines such
  as IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α in a TLR4 signaling-dependent manner. Cellular
  trypsin is increased upon IAV infection, which cleaves HA0 into functional structures.
  IAV infection increases the expression of OPN, resulting in aggravated brain damage.
  IAV elevates the expression of eotaxin, which mediates airway inflammatory disease.
  IAV activates the expression of TAK1, leading to the activation of JNK. JNK is also
  activated by NS1, resulting in apoptosis. IAV induces the expression of WNK4 and
  inhibits ENaCs, impairing fluid transport in the respiratory system. The levels
  of CXCR4 on CD4+ T cells are increased during IAV infection, which affects HIV infection.
  IAV induces the expression of MMP-13 and MMP-9 and causes atherosclerotic plaque
  and tissue damage, respectively. H5N1 IAV induces the phosphorylation and methylation
  of HIST1H1C. Viral NS1 directly induces the expression or activation of several
  cellular proteins such as iNOS, p53 (p-p53), CTHRC1, and TGF-β, resulting in different
  cellular effects that benefit the viruses. Viral PA and NA from the swine influenza
  virus elevate MIP-2, causing pulmonary neutrophilia. Black arrows and graphics indicate
  regulatory effect that are not directly caused by viral component
