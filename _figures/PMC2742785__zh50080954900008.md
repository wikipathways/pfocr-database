caption: Cluster 2 genes significantly overlapped with those in the eicosanoid signaling
  pathway (P = 4.6E-05). The significance is calculated using IPA software based on
  the likelihood measurement for a given pathway associated with the dataset by random
  chance. After 24-h hyperoxia challenge, genes increased in CebpαΔ/Δ mice are indicated
  by up arrows; genes decreased in CebpαΔ/Δ mice are indicated by short down arrows.
papertitle: C/EBPα is required for pulmonary cytoprotection during hyperoxia.
