caption: ROS-responsive targeted micellar system (TT-NM/Rapa) for improving neuronal
  proteostasis by upregulation of autophagic flux. TT-NM/Rapa can effectively penetrate
  through BBB and further target neurons in AD lesions mediated by selective GT1b
  binding of TPL. Upon endocytosis, the designed micelles consisting of ROS-sensitive
  thioketal moiety exhibit enhanced release of rapamycin to exert autophagy-modulating
  efficacy. TT-NM/Rapa efficiently regulate the entire autophagy-lysosomal pathway
  (initiation, elongation, and lysosomal fusion and degradation), thereby accelerating
  neurotoxic protein clearance and displaying superior neuroprotective effects for
  AD treatment.
