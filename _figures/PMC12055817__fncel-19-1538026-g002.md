caption: Possible mechanisms underlying crosstalk between microglia and astroglia.
  Interleukin-1α (IL-1α), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C1q secreted by activated
  microglia induce transcription of astrocytes to produce neurotoxic factors. Microglia
  can regulate the expression of CCl2, IL-1β and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) by
  regulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) and transforming
  growth factor-β (TGF-α) through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Microglial TNF-α
  promotes the release of glutamate from astrocytes and produces neuronal excitotoxicity.
  The NF-kB pathway in microglia activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, which in turn activates
  caspase-1 and induces the activation of A1 astrocytes. A1 astrocytes secrete CCL2,
  CX3CL1, CXCL10, GM-CSF, and IL-1, which in turn activate proinflammatory microglia.
  The deficiency of sigma-1 receptors in astrocytes leads to the activation of the
  NF-κB pathway, thereby amplifying the interaction between reactive astrocytes and
  activated microglia
