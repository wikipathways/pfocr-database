caption: (A) Id2−/− mice, under conditions of 12:12 LD or a short-day photoperiod
  exhibit a delayed phase angle of entrainment (Ψ) relative to wild-type (WT) mice.
  Long bright-light exposure during the delay portion of the phase-response curve
  (PRC) (parametric entrainment) or a short duration/dim light (nonparametric entrainment)
  produces a larger phase delay of the clock (Δϕ) and faster entrainment. These properties
  of the clock cannot be explained by standard models of parametric and nonparametric
  entrainment, tested in various ways. The timing of the LD cycles is indicated by
  the white/black bars. The delay portion of the PRC is highlighted in gray to signify
  the phase of the cycle with a change in photic response. (B). The SCN is the likely
  locus of the Id2−/− photic responsiveness phenotype. The retina and retinal hypothalamic
  tract (RHT) structure/function are normal in Id2−/− mice, as is the phase, period
  length, and amplitude of SCN clock gene expression. The tick mark signifies a “normal”
  anatomy or function in the photoentrainment–circadian clock pathway, although a
  retinal contribution to the phenotype cannot be entirely excluded. In the Id2−/−
  mouse, short duration/dim light activates the SCN cells and increases activity of
  the period 1 clock gene promoter, as demonstrated by the elevation of light-induced
  per1 expression compared with WT mice. Likely targets for ID2 modulation of photoentrainment
  are CLOCK and BMAL1 via direct protein interaction with and inhibition by ID2 ()
  and/or altered intracellular signaling that culminates in E-box and/or Ca2+/cAMP
  response element (CRE) activation at the per1 gene promoter. As per1 is a light-inducible
  state variable of the clock, a change in per1 expression produces a phase shift
  of the clock (; ). Thus, an enhanced responsiveness of this input pathway in Id2−/−
  mice results in increased photic-induced phase changes of the circadian pacemaker.

  Ca2+/cAMP response element-binding protein. Color version of the figure is available
