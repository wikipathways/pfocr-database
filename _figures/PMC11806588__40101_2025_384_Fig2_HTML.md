caption: Summary of the potential pathways and mechanisms of genes associated with
  skin colour-related phenotypes. (i) AFG3L1P is in strong linkage disequilibrium
  with MC1R, a gene critical for melanin synthesis; (ii) ASIP promotes the synthesis
  of darker eumelanin over lighter pheomelanin; (iii) CPNE7 and (iv) TUBB3 contribute
  to melanosome organisation through its role in microtubule expansion; (v) DPEP1
  and (vi) DEF8 inhibit melanocyte cell division via the negative regulation of the
  leukotriene D4 signalling pathway and autophagy, respectively; (vii) IRF4 upregulates
  TYR expression, a gene essential for melanin synthesis; (viii) SPG7 levels inversely
  correlate with melatonin, which negatively regulates melanin synthesis, linking
  SPG7 to melanin production; and (ix) TYR catalyses the conversion of tyrosine to
  melanin
