caption: Schematic diagram of BCSCs and TME. (1) PROCR is a marker of BCSCs for stratifying
  TNBC into subgroups. (2) NOTCH4 is also a marker for BCSCs, driving ML-BCBCs into
  a quiescent state via GAS1 and inducing EMT via SLUG. (3) TAMs with elevated LSECtin
  expression interacts with BTN3A3, promoting the stemness of breast cancer cells.
  (4) The following pathways increase cell stemness. IL1R2 interacts with USP15 to
  induce deubiquitination and stabilization of BMI1. SGCE stabilizes EGFR. TSPAN-8
  enhances stemness genes, including NANOG, OCT4, and ALDHA1. SH3RF3 activates PTX3
  via the JNK-JUN pathway. (5) BCSCs are divided into e-BCSCs and q-BCSCs. SETD4 is
  important in the maintenance of qBCSCs. (6) A positive feedback loop between CCL5-CCR5
  and CCL18-PIPTNM3 is shown. TAMs secret CCL18, binding to PIPTNM3 on breast cancer
  cells. Then breast cancer cells secret CCL5, inducing macrophages to a TAM-like
  phenotype CCR5. (7) Alisertib eliminates tumor-promoting MDSCs and TAMs to reshape
  the immune microenvironment.
