caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the mechanism whereby A‐FABP potentiates liver
  fibrosis. In response to chronic liver injury, the expression and the subsequent
  secretion of A‐FABP from LSECs are induced. Elevated A‐FABP potentiates LSEC capillarization
  through activating Hh signaling pathway thus initiates HSC activation. On the other
  hand, LSEC‐derived A‐FABP acts in a paracrine manner which diffuses into HSCs and
  stimulates the transactivation of TGFβ1 gene through activating the JNK/c‐Jun signaling.
  Enhanced TGFβ1 perpetuates HSC activation and facilitates the fibrogenic events
  such as fibrogenic cytokine expression and deposition of scar matrix, therefore
  exaggerating liver fibrosis.
