caption: Graphical abstract and proposed pathway of rhMFGE8 administration attenuate
  hippocampal injury by improving neurogenesis in SAH models. SAH caused hippocampal
  injury and neurogenesis interruption. Administered exogenous MFGE8, recombinant
  human MFGE8(rhMFGE8), could ameliorate hippocampal injury and improve neurological
  functions after SAH. Mechanistically, MFGE8 bind to the receptor integrin β3, which
  activated the PI3K/Akt pathway to increase the mTOR expression, and further promote
  the expression of cyclin D1, HPCA and DCX. rhMFGE8 could attenuated hippocampal
  injury by improving neurogenesis after SAH, however, know down integrin β3 or pharmacological
  inhibited PI3K/Akt by ly294002 or MK2206 reversed the neuro-protective effect of
  rhMFGE8
