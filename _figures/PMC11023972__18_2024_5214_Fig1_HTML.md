caption: Schematic diagram of DNA-damage response pathways. The integrity of the genome
  is constantly challenged by genotoxic factors (e.g., inheritance, endogenous reactive
  oxygen species, DNA replication stresses, or topoisomerase poisons) or exogenous
  insults (e.g., genotoxic drugs, irradiation, environmental pollutions, or pathogens
  invasion) that inducing DNA-damage. Accumulation of damaged DNA consequently induces
  genomic instability. The intricate pathways have been characterized for identifying
  and repairing DNA damage, summarized as the DNA-damage response (DDR). Overall,
  at least six distinct pathways may be activated solely or combinedly to repair DNA
  damage depending on the types of broken DNA, which are base-excision repair (BER),
  nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), double-strand breaks (DSBs)
  repair including homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ),
  interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair and direct repair pathways. Intriguingly, although
  numerous genes are involved in the multiple complex processes of DDR, some common
  schedules are shared among diverse repair pathways
