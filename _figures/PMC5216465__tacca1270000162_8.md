caption: 'Four possible pathways (circles) by which CNP could activate CFTR. Experiments
  in the SRG establish pathway 1 as dominant (). CNP binds to and activates a CNP-selective
  receptor GC at the basolateral membrane (designated NPR-B), resulting in marked
  cGMP elevation. Endogenous cGMP, but not membrane-permeable and non-hydrolyzable
  cGMP analogs, compete with cAMP for degradation by a type 3 PDE (PDE3A). PDE 3A
  is the only PDE inhibited by cGMP resulting in a local rise of cAMP levels. cAMP
  in the apical compartment, through activation of cAMP-dependent PKA, causes phosphorylation
  of the R domain of CFTR and opening of the CFTR chloride channel (pathway 1, solid
  lines). Activation of CFTR by CNP is dependent on basal cAMP production by AC, which
  is inhibited by somatostatin through a specific receptor coupled to the inhibitory
  G protein Gαi. The three other potential cGMP signaling pathways (dotted lines)
  were excluded by the experiments, identifying pathway 1 as the predominant signaling
  pathway operating in the SRG epithelia and likely other epithelia. Abbreviations:
