caption: 'Utilization of three generations of biorefinery materials based on the surface
  display system of C. glutamicum, including surface display, transporters, and metabolic
  reactions. Overview of the surface display, transporters, and metabolic reactions
  in C. glutamicum for uptake and conversion of three generations of biorefinery materials.
  Black represents the endogenous reaction of C. glutamicum, and * represents foreign
  proteins expressed by heterologous genes. Purple indicates the utilization path
  of the first-generation of biorefinery, blue indicates the utilization path of the
  second-generation of biorefinery, and orange indicates the possible utilization
  path of the third-generation of biorefinery. The solid line represents direct reactions,
  and the dashed line represents indirect reactions. Enzymes of the Cre pathway: CreHI,
  CreJEF, CreG, CreC, and CreD; enzymes of the Paa pathway: PaaK, PaaABCDE, PaaG,
