caption: JAK-STAT-SCOS cell model. In canonical JAK-STAT signaling, the binding of
  extracellular cytokines to their transmembrane receptors results in activation of
  the pathway in a JAK-mediated manner. Both JAK and cytokine receptors are transphosphorylated
  by JAKs in close proximity. Activated JAKs phosphorylate STATs, leading to STAT
  dimerization and eventual translocation into cell nucleus, where they regulate the
  expression of genes, including SOCS proteins that act as negative feedback inhibitors
  of JAK-STAT. In BN reconstruction, both BNrich and Ensemble removed all the negative
  feedback edges representing SOCS inhibition of JAK-STAK (edges in red), while Clipper
  retained around 1/3 of them. In addition, Clipper also removed some of the JAK-induced
  STAT phosphorylation (edges in purple). Proteins of the STAT family are present
  in homodimers or heterodimers. SOCS family can be merged in a single node.
