caption: '. Schematic representation of Notch signaling. A, Notch receptor is composed
  of extracellular and intracellular domains. The extracellular domain consists of
  EGFR and LNR. The intracellular domain contains RAM23, DTS, ANK, NLS, PPD, TAD,
  PEST, and S4. The red arrows indicate cleavage sites: S1 (Furin), S2 (TACE), and
  S3/S4 (γ-secretase). B, Notch ligands have DSL and EGFR domains. C, Notch signaling
  transduction pathway ligand-receptor interaction leads to two successive cleavages
  at S2 by TACE and S3/4 by γ-secretase to release NICD. NICD translocates to the
  nucleus and forms a transcriptional activation complex after binding to MAML-1 and
  CSL. Prototypic target genes include Hes and the HRT family members. EGFR: epidermal
  growth-like repeats; LNR: LIN12/Notch repeats; RAM: RBP-Jκ associated molecule;
  DTS: downregulation targeting sequence; ANK: ankyrin/cdc10 repeats; NLS: nuclear
  localization signals; PPD: potential phosphorylated domain; TAD: transcriptional
  activation domain; PEST: sequence rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine;
  S4: WSSSSP; TACE: TNF-α converting enzyme; DSL: Delta, Serrate, Lag2; NICD: Notch
  intracellular domain; MAML-1: Mastermind-like 1; CSL: C promoter-binding factor
  in humans, Suppressor of hairless in Drosophila, LAG in Caenorhabditis elegans,
  also called RBP-Jκ in mice; Hes: Hairy and enhancer of split; HRT: Hairy-related
  transcription; CoR: co-repressor; HDAC: histone deacetylase.'
