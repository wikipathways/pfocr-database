caption: 'The PKA-regulatory pathway. Biochemical, genetic and physiological data
  were used to describe a pathway that regulates PKA during Dictyostelium development.
  Gene expression data were not considered in the construction of this network. PufA
  is an RNA-binding protein that sequesters pkaC mRNA and prevents its translation.
  YakA is a protein kinase that indirectly inhibits PufA activity. PkaC catalytic
  activity is inhibited by the regulatory subunit PkaR. An extracellular cAMP signal
  is integrated through various cAMP receptors (Car), which result in the activation
  of the aggregative adenylyl cyclase AcaA. AcaA activation leads to production of
  cAMP, which binds PkaR and ends the inhibition of PkaC. Two proteins that contain
  response regulator domains control PkaR. The adenylyl cyclase AcrA functions after
  the aggregation stage of development and produces cAMP, and the cAMP-phosphodiesterase
  RegA degrades intracellular cAMP. These two response regulator proteins are regulated
  indirectly by histidine kinases (Dhk). The components that function downstream of
  PkaC are unknown (?). Nodes in the graph represent genes and edges represent regulatory
  relationships: positive (arrows) and negative (barred lines). Dashed lines indicate
  indirect interactions. The proteins in black are encoded by genes used in our analysis.'
