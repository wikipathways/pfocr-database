caption: 'Abnormalities in EPC Phenotype and Vascular Barriers in RA Synovium. (A)
  In RA, EPCs home to inflamed synovium, primarily through the CXCL13/CXCR5 axis.
  Then, this axis activates the downstream PLC/MEK signaling pathway, promoting VEGF
  release. Additionally, the VCAM-1/VLA4 interaction enhances the adhesion of EPCs
  to ECs, mediating the selective recruitment of EPCs to inflamed joint tissues. (B)
  In healthy, normal vessels are characterized by pericyte coverage, mature and homogenized
  BM barriers, and ECs arranged in a squared pattern (left). In the hypoxic and highly
  inflammatory RA microenvironment, in certain newly formed vessels display activated
  ECs, detachment of pericytes, and disrupted vascular barriers, resulting in immature
  vessels (right). EPC: Endothelial progenitor cell. EC: Endothelial cell. BM: Basilar
  membrane. RAM: Rheumatoid arthritis microenvironment'
