caption: The mechanisms of TGF-β signaling and the immunosuppressive effects of TGF-β
  signaling on the immune response. Cells with yellow nuclei refer to immune cells
  and CAFs regulated by TGF-β signaling pathway. Cells with purple nuclei refer to
  TGF-β-producing cells (mainly secreted by fibroblast). TGF-β is a widely distributed
  signaling molecule involved in the regulation of almost all kinds of immune cells
  in the tumor microenvironment. On the one hand, TGF-β limits the functions of T
  cell, NK, and dendritic cell (DC). On the other hand, TGF-β promotes the differentiation
  towards Treg and M2-like macrophage. Besides, TGF-β enhances cancer-associated fibroblast
  (CAF) to generate collagen, which hampers immune cell infiltration. Adapted from
  Yi et al, 2022 ().
