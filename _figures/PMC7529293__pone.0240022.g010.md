caption: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the cell membrane could be
  the upstream receptor sensing extracellular TC-HT stimulation and transmit the signal
  to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, which induces Nrf2 and CREB activations. The transcription
  factors entering the nucleus further enhance the expressions of HO-1 and other prosurvival
  proteins which decrease the ROS level and inhibit the apoptosis signal.
