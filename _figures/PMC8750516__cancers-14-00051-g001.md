caption: The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is tightly regulated by pro- and anti-apoptotic
  BCL-2 proteins which interact on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Pro-apoptotic
  BCL-2 proteins can be subcategorized as BH3-only ‘activators’ (BIM, BID, PUMA),
  BH3-only ‘sensitizers’ (BAD, NOXA, HRK, BIK, BMF) and pore-forming ‘effectors’ (BAK,
  BAX). Counteracting these are anti-apoptotic/pro-survival BCL-2 proteins including
  MCL-1, BCL-2, BCL-XL which sequester pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. BH3-only
  ‘activators’ promote apoptosis by directly engaging and activating BAX/BAK, as well
  as sequestering anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. BH3-only ‘sensitizers’ are unable
  to directly engage BAX/BAX and primarily function by sequestering anti-apoptotic
  members. The induction of BH3-only proteins in response to cell death stimuli can
  trigger BAX/BAK homo-oligomerization, the formation of macropores, mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), the release of cytochrome c and caspase
  driven apoptotic cell death.
