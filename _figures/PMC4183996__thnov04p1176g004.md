caption: 'Involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related
  metastasis. miRNAs can regulate EMT by acting on several EMT-related pathways, including
  transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated
  pathways, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. miR-140-5p can directly target TGF-β receptor
  1, miR-122 can target Ras homolog family member A (RHOA), and miR-192 and miR-200
  can negatively regulate zinc finger E-box 1 (ZEB1) and ZEB2, respectively, thus
  inhibiting TGF-β-mediated metastasis. The RTK-related pathways, including the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
  cascades and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway, are also regulated
  by miRNAs. miR-1, miR-23b, miR-34a, and miR-148a can target c-Met, a RTK for hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF). MiR-199a/b-3P can target p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated
  kinase 4 (PAK4), subsequently inhibiting Raf-MEK-ERK cascades. On the contrary,
  phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) can be negatively regulated by miR-21 and
  miR-29a, and miR-222 and miR-222 simultaneously target PP2A. miR-148a can also negatively
  regulate pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor-interacting protein (HPIP), an
  activator of both ERK and AKT. Moreover, miR-148a can target Wnt1 mRNA, thus blocking
  EMT mediated by Wnt/β-catenin-signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma. EGF: epidermal
  growth factor; FGF: fibroblast growth factor. Arrows indicate an activating effect
  of miRNAs on their targets, whereas the bars indicate an inhibitory effect. Green
  miRNA: upregulated; Red miRNA: downregulated.'
