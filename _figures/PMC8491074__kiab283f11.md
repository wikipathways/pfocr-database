caption: 'A model of JA-dependent and JA-independent signaling pathways in regulating
  the enzyme activity of myrosinase. When plants are attacked by diseases and insect
  pests, stressed plants could induce the expression of myrosinase genes to resist
  the stresses. There are two signaling pathways to mediate the expression of myrosinase
  genes: One is the JA-independent signaling pathway which regulates the expression
  of BGLU19, BGLU20, TGG4, and so on; the other one is the JA-dependent signaling
  pathway. For the JA-dependent signaling pathway in regulating the expression of
  myrosinase genes, when plants are attacked by diseases and insect pests, endogenous
  JA will be produced through inducing AOS expression. JA-Ile can be recognized by
  the receptor COI1 (SCFCOI1) and activate COI1. The activated COI1 can degrade the
  JAZ proteins, release the transcriptional activity of FAMA, and activate the downstream
  TGG1 gene expression to promote the synthesis of myrosinase, to promote the hydrolysis
  of glucosinolate. JA also mediates myrosinase activity by inducing or inhibiting
  the expression of other myrosinase genes. The final outcome of jasmonate regulation
  is the enhancement of myrosinase activity. Purple boxes represent the two types
  of myrosinases; the solid lines represent the pathways that have been clarified
  in this study; dashed lines represent the pathways that need further study; the
  question mark bubble represents the important unknown element in the regulation
  of TGG2 expression by JA, which needs further exploration.'
