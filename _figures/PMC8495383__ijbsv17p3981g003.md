caption: The schematic diagram illustrated that (A) ENO1 binding with TLR4, uPAR and
  Plg-Rs, and (B) MBP-1 (ENO1) mediated signal transduction. (①) ENO1 is able to activate
  the CD14-dependent TLR4 pathway via binding with TLR4 on monocytes involving in
  a dual mechanism firstly pro-inflammatory and secondly anti-inflammatory. (②) As
  a plasminogen receptor (PLGR), ENO1 could binding with Plg-Rs to promote invasion
  of monocytes into lungs in mice and humans (③) ENO1 interact with uPAR to activates
  serine/threonine kinase 1-2 (ERK) and Rac family small GTPase to accumulate ROS
  produce and senescence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. (④) alternative
  splicing of ENO1 mRNA could be controlled by the AKT/eIF2α axis. (⑤) MBP-1 regulates
  prostate cancer cell growth by inducing proteasome mediated degradation of the MEK5
  to inhibit the MEK5/MAPK7-mediated activation of MEF2C and NF-κB. (⑥) MBP-1 suppresses
  tumorigenesis and regulates the development and metastasis of cancer cells by regulating
  genes expression, including c-Myc, COX-2 and ERBB2.
