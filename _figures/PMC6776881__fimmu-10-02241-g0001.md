caption: Proposed working model of ω-3 PUFAs induced inhibitory effect on inflammation
  and autoimmunity. Elevation of ω-3 PUFAs can stimulate one of its major receptors,
  GPR120. GPR120 couples to β-arrestin2 and inhibit TAB1-mediated activation of TAK1,
  providing a mechanism for inhibition of NF-κB related pro-inflammatory signaling
  pathways in autoimmune disease (, ). ω-3 PUFAs and their metabolites suppress the
  activation of Th1 cells through inhibiting of mTORC1 (, , ), which in turn activates
  suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) (). ω-3 PUFAs can inhibit signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT) 4 which is essential for the development of
  Th1 cells from naive CD4+ T cells (). In another signaling pathway, ω-3 PUFAs can
  dictate the differentiation toward Th2 cells by activating 4E-BP1 through dephosphorylation
  and then stimulate STAT6 ().
