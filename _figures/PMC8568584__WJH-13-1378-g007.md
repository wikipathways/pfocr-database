caption: 'Scheme of iron-mediated blockage of hepcidin transcription via bone morphogenetic
  protein/small mothers against decapentaplegic but independent of signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 signaling. Iron (ferric ammonium citrate) primarily
  blocks hepcidin transcription via the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/small mothers
  against decapentaplegic pathway while no effect on signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 signaling was observed. The scheme also shows all studied hepcidin
  signaling pathways including BMP6, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, hypoxia or a complex
  co-culture model with macrophages. IL-1β: Interleukin 1β; IL-6: Interleukin 6; BMP6:
  Bone morphogenetic protein 6; FAC: Ferric ammonium citrate; IL-1R: IL-1 receptor;
  IL-6R: IL-6 receptor: NOX4: NADPH Oxidase 4; BMPR: BMP receptor; p-STAT3: Phosphorylated
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; p-SMAD1/5/8: Phosphorylated
  small mothers against decapentaplegic 1/5/8.'
