caption: Our data supports a model in which the Rim pathway is activated by neutral/alkaline
  pH. In this pathway, the newly discovered Rra1 membrane protein and the ESCRT complex,
  including Vps23 (ESCRT-I) likely Vps25 (ESCRT-II) and Snf7 (ESCRT-III), induce Rim23
  puncta formation and activate the Rim101-proteolysis complex. The Rim13 protease
  cleaves the Rim101 transcription factor, inducing its nuclear localization. Active
  Rim101 then transcriptional changes necessary for adapting to alkaline pH.
