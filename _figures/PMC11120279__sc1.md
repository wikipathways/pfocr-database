caption: Schematic illustration of FDT vaccine with the ability to activate systemic
  immunity for tumor inhibition. (A) FDT vaccines are prepared with X-ray-induced
  ICD effect and liquid nitrogen cryogenic freezing technology. (B) Benefiting from
  X-Ray-induced excessive dsDNA accumulation in the cytoplasm of FDT, this FDT vaccine
  can activate the STING signaling pathway and the maturation of DCs, thus eliciting
  robust adaptive immunity in the tumor microenvironment. (C) Furthermore, when combined
  with the inhibitor of efferocytosis (UNC2250), the immune-suppressive clearance
  of FDT by macrophages was largely decreased, which in turn reprogrammed pro-inflammatory
  activation of macrophages and finally resulted in double activation of adaptive
  immunity and innate immunity. The diagrammatic drawing was created by Figdraw
