caption: 'Specialized 1,4-naphthoquinone metabolism is widely distributed across vascular
  plants. Orders containing species in which specialized 1,4-naphthoquinones have
  been detected and reported () are shaded in gray. Examples of 1,4-naphthoquinones
  observed in ferns, magnoliids, monocots, and dicots are shown. Shaded arrows next
  to orders indicate experimentally supported metabolic origins (; ; ). Arrow colors
  depicting metabolic routes are the same as those in : yellow, OSB pathway; blue,
  homogentisate/MVA pathway; orange, 4HBA/MVA pathway; magenta, acetate–polymalonate
  pathway; gray, no experimental evidence for metabolic origin of detected 1,4-naphtoquinones.
  The phylogenetic reconstruction of plant evolution presented is from the Angiosperm
  Phylogeny Group (P.F. Stevens, Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, version 14, July 2017;
