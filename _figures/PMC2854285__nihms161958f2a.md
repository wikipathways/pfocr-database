caption: (A) S6K1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 triggers a number of feedback loops that
  negatively impact on PI3K signaling. S6K1 directly phosphorylates insulin receptor
  substrate 1 (IRS-1) at multiple sites, which leads a significant attenuation of
  insulin and and insulin-like growth factor effect at the cell membrane. S6K1 also
  inhibits PDGFR and the MEK/ERK signaling pathway through a not fully-understood
  mechanism. These 3 inhibitory loops ultimately dampen PI3K, Akt and mTORC1 activation
  and have likely evolved as a cellular response to buffer aberrant or excessive PI3K
  activity. (B) Deptor can have oncogenic and tumor suppressive properties. By blocking
  mTORC1 and mTORC2, Deptor inhibits protein synthesis, cell size increase and the
  proliferative and survival effects of Akt. However, under certain conditions, inhibition
  of mTORC1 by Deptor relieves the feedback inhibition from S6K1 to PI3K, boosting
  Akt activity. (C) The 2 most important tumor suppressors, namely Pten and p53, cooperate
  in the inhibition of mTORC1. p53 transactivates many negative regulators of mTORC1
  (TSC2, AMPKβ1, Sestrin 1 and 2), which oppose Akt activity. Akt favors degradation
  of p53 by phosphorylating and stabilizing MDM2. Importantly, Pten and AMPK directly
  stabilize p53. Collectively, these interactions imply the existence of a coordinate
  regulation of mTOR signaling pathway by energy, nutrients, growth factors, oncogenic
  stress and DNA integrity.
