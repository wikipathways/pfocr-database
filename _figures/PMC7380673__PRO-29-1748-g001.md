caption: β‐amyloid peptide (Aβ) oligomers (and not amyloid plaques) as the root cause
  of Alzheimer's disease. According to the classical amyloid cascade pathway, the
  amyloid precursor protein (APP) is successively cleaved by two proteases (secretases),
  resulting in the production of the Aβ in the extracellular milieu. Excess Aβ may
  self‐aggregate into various assemblies, from small oligomers to large fibers and
  plaques, or be degraded be degraded through several distinct pathways (microglial/hepatic/renal
  clearance). The neurotoxicity of Aβ has been matter of speculation for several decades.
  It is now established that the mere presence of amyloid plaques in the brain is
  not correlated with Alzheimer's disease, as amyloid plaques are nontoxic structures
  that can be found in the brain of healthy persons with no cognitive decline. In
  fact, the paradigm has shifted to small Aβ oligomers, now identified as the real
  root mechanism of Alzheimer's disease. Once embedded in the membrane, Aβ oligomers
  induce Ca2+ (•) signal and free radicals that, in combination, trigger toxic downstream
  events leading to cell death and Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and symptoms.
  Ca2+ ions activate GSK3 and CaMII kinases,  which catalyze the phosphorylation of
  tau, a microtubule stabilizing protein. Hyperphosphorylated tau proteins detach
  from microtubule, self‐aggregate and form neurofibrillary tangles. All these events
  induce neuronal dysfunction and death. Note that Aβ oligomeric pores can be either
  preassembled in the extracellular milieu and then inserted in the plasma membrane
  or formed in the membrane by Aβ monomers under a lipid‐assisted oligomerization
  process. The dosage of Aβ oligomers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be used
  as an early diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease but also as endpoint for assessing
  the efficiency of anti‐oligomer therapies. Any approach that could block the formation
  of Aβ oligomeric pores in the plasma membrane of brain cells could prevent and/or
  stop the progression of Alzheimer's disease
