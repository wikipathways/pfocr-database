caption: (a) Schematic diagram of the system. A system on a chip (SOC) drives 5 direct
  digital synthesis boards (DDS) to modulate 5 lasers which were combined and passed
  through a sample. An optical fiber collected the multiply scattered light, which
  was detected by an avalanche photo diode (APD). The APD signal was digitized by
  one channel of an analog to digital converter (ADC). The second channel of the ADC
  digitized a reference signal from the DDS boards. Each time the system was restarted,
  a measurement was taken on a calibration phantom (not shown) to calculate the instrument
  response. (b) Schematic diagram of the signal processing pathway. Items inside the
  blue box (solid line) were performed on the SOC. Items in the red box (dashed line)
  were performed on the host computer.
