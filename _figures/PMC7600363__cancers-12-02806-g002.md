caption: Biosynthesis and major signalling pathways activated by FLT3 wildtype (WT)
  (a) and FLT3 with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation (b). (a) Wildtype (WT)
  FLT3 is synthesized and processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the GOLGI
  and reaches the plasma membrane (PM) as inactive monomer. Binding of the FLT3 ligand
  (FL) induces dimerization, autophosphorylation and induction of downstream signalling.
  This comprises activation of the Ras/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
  and the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway from the PM and to some extent
  STAT5 phosphorylation from endosomes (not shown). Consequently, FLT3 WT signalling
  induces proliferation and differentiation of haematopoietic progenitor cells. FLT3
  WT is inactivated via dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)
  such as the transmembrane PTPRJ but also cytoplasmic PTPs such as SHP-1. (b) FLT3
  with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane region is
  constitutively and ligand-independently active at the PM and preferentially at endomembranes
  such as ER and endosomes (not shown). In particular, STAT5 is aberrantly activated
  at endomembranes. FLT3 ITD induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via
  activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) 4. As a consequence, PTPRJ gets inactivated via
  oxidation of catalytic active cysteine residues. Dimerization of PTPRJ also reduces
  its catalytic activity. FLT3 ITD signalling can be blunted by the use of specific
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that are in clinical use. However, secondary mutations
  in FLT3 can cause inhibitor-resistance. Potential novel therapeutics comprise inhibitors
  of STAT5, ROS quencher and peptides that prevent dimerization of PTPRJ, thereby
  enhancing its activity.
