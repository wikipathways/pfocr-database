caption: 1. 6-Hydroxydopamine-induced oxidative stress may upregulate DJ-1 through
  activation of ERK1/2 ()2. DJ-1, but not its L166P mutant, protects cells from oxidative
  injury by activating ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 ()3. DJ-1 mediates dopamine (DA) homeostasis
  through activation of ERK1/2 and the resulting nuclear translocation of the transcription
  factor Nurr1 (; )4. DJ-1 activates the non-canonical MEK/ERK-mTOR pathway to activate
  autophagy (; )5. DJ-1 promotes oncogenic potential by activating the SRC/ERK/uPA
  axis ()6. DJ-1 interacts directly with ERK1/2 and may enhance the nuclear translocation
  of ERK1/2, where it can phosphorylate Elk1, leading to increased SOD expression
  ()7. DJ-1, but not its C106S mutant, can bind directly to and phosphorylate c-Raf,
  which can then activate MEK and ERK1/2 ()8. DJ-1, but not its L166P mutant, suppresses
  the expression of PP2A, an inhibitor of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 family kinases ()9. DJ-1,
  but not its C106S mutant, may sequester p53 away from promoters in a DNA-binding
  affinity-dependent manner, resulting in downregulation of ERK1/2 inhibitor, DUSP1
