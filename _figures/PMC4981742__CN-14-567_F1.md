caption: 'Mitochondrial dysfunction in gliomas- Evasion of Apoptosis: Impaired mitochondrial
  function due to the genomic mutations in mtDNA leads to impaired function of electron
  transport chain thus enhancing generation of ROS. This elevated cellular oxidative
  stress leads to the damage of nuclear genome resulting in activation of p53. This
  process in turn promotes P53 mediated generation of apoptotic response through release
  of p53 up regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and Bcl-2 homology domain 3 proteins
  (BH3) which acts on Bcl2 family apoptotic proteins Bax, Bak and mitochondria mediated
  apoptotic events. However, gliomas with enhanced growth factor signaling through
  RTKs results in PI3K/ Akt pathway activation that causes MDM2 mediated degradation
  of P53. Glioma cells harboring P53 mutations are also resistant to the ROS mediated
  apoptotic pathway. As glioma cells preferentially generate energy through the glycolysis
  over krebs cycle, they generate large amounts of pyruvate, and it becomes lactate
  under hypoxic conditions generating chronic inflammatory state that leads to upregulation
  of TNF-alpha, TRAIL. These ligands trigger apoptosis through activating caspase
  8 by death receptor pathway. Enhanced PI3K/Akt activated signaling blocks this extrinsic
  pathway through mTOR mediated inhibition.'
