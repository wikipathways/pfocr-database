caption: 'Nitric oxide dose effect on mitochondrial function and endoplasmic reticulum
  stress. High NO activates an ER stress response that induces apoptosis, at least
  in some types of cells, such as β-cells and macrophages. Depletion of ER Ca2+ and
  activation of the ERS pathway, including ATF6 activation and CHOP induction, was
  also detected in these cell types after treatment with NO. The soluble protein CRIPTO
  (also known as TDGF1) and its cell-surface receptor, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein
  (GRP78), have crucial roles in promoting quiescence and in the maintenance of many
  cell types, including haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Under hypoxic conditions,
  HIF1α binds to hypoxia responsive elements (HREs) in the promoter region of CRIPTO
  and activates its expression. CRIPTO then binds to GRP78 and stimulates glycolytic
  metabolism-related proteins. This acts as a link between the ERS response and cell
  metabolism that finally controls stem cell fate. In addition, a low concentration
  of NO inhibits CcO and induces AMPK, which activates glycolysis. This can help to
  maintain pluripotency and cell proliferation. NO could have a protective effect
  under hypoxic conditions because the activation of AMPK inhibits CHOP expression
  and prevents apoptosis. This figure shows the relationship between NO, mitochondrial
  function and ERS and its impact on stem cell development. ERSE: Endoplasmic reticulum
