caption: Involvement of RANK-NF-κB signalling in the differentiation of osteoclasts
  in osteoporosis. RANKL secreted by mature osteoblasts binds to and activates RANK
  on osteoclast precursors, activating TRAF6 that in turn activates the NF-κB signalling
  pathway. As a downstream event, NFATc1 is activated and enters into the nucleus
  to regulate expression of genes related to osteoclast differentiation and maturation.
