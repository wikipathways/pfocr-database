caption: Our goal was to leverage our knowledge of carbene-catalyzed Michael reactions
  to produce an aldol-mediated desymmetrization of 1,3-diketones. In the proposed
  reaction pathway, β-lactone formation would then regenerate the catalyst followed
  by a decarboxylation to form enantioenrinched cyclopentenes (). The achiral symmetric
  substrates are readily available from simple palladium(0)-catalyzed alkylations
  of 1,3-diketones with butadiene monoepoxide followed by oxidation. In this manner,
  substitution in the 2-position can be varied and the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is
  easily appended.
