caption: Signaling-activated kinases regulate splicing factor activity. Various extracellular
  cues, like growth factors or stress stimuli, activate different signal-transduction
  cascades impinging on protein kinases that in turn phosphorylate RBPs, thereby modulating
  their splicing activity. SAM68 splicing activity is inversely regulated by ERKs
  and nRTKs, which, respectively, activate and inhibit its splicing activity. The
  PI3 K-AKT pathway regulates the activity of several SR proteins both directly or
  by phosphorylating and modulating the activity and localization of CLKs and SRPKs.
  Stress signal-activated kinases, like JNK or p38, can both modulate splicing factor
  localization, like for hnRNPA1, or activity, like for SPF45 (see text for details).
