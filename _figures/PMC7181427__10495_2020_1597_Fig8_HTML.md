caption: Possible mechanisms responsible for the effect of APD treatment on SAP. Once
  SAP occurs, toxic substances in PAAF can activate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in
  the pancreatic tissue during SAP, which subsequently regulate the expression of
  apoptosis-related genes via nuclear intervention of the downstream signal molecular
  NF-κB. These events inhibit cell apoptosis and aggravate the progression of acute
  pancreatitis. After APD treatment, toxic substances in PAAF were removed, resulting
  in a significant decline in the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The inhibiton
  of PI3K/AKT signaling will enhance cell apoptosis in pancreatic tissues, and ultimately
  exerts a protective role on pancreatic injury induced by SAP
