caption: COVID-19 immune dysregulation. (a) A node (or object) on the map could be
  a gene, protein or chemical compound. Query genes from experimental data which intersect
  with pathway objects are denoted by thermometers. Thermometer 1 represents DEGs
  in response to treatment with vaccine, applying thresholds of 5 and −5 on log2FC
  and FDR ≤ 0.05, respectively. Thermometer 2 represents DEGs in response to treatment
  with vaccine, applying thresholds of 2 and −2 on log2FC and FDR ≤ 0.05, respectively.
  (b) Direct interactions network map between DEGs enriching COVID-19 immune dysregulation
  pathways. Connections between network objects on the map are referred to as links
  (or edges). A link identifies an interaction or a logical relation between two nodes.
  The type of interaction or relation is reflected by an appropriate symbol placed
  in the middle of the link. B = binding; IE = influence on expression; TR = transcription
  regulation; red arrows = inhibition; green arrows = activation; grey arrows = unspecified
  action; light violet text box = normal process; pink text box = pathological processes;
  white text box with blue outline = notes; starred network objects = groups or complex
  processes; red thermometers on pathway map = network object is upregulated by vaccine;
  blue thermometers on pathway map = network object is downregulated by vaccine. The
  length of red and blue bars in the thermometers represent log2FC values (longer
  red bars represents larger upregulation of gene expression and longer blue bars
  represent larger downregulation of gene expression). Red circles on process network
  = network object is upregulated by vaccine; blue circles on process network = network
  object is downregulated by vaccine. Darker red circles indicate larger upregulation,
  darker red circles indicate larger downregulation.
