caption: 'Iron metabolic reprogramming in GBM cells. Iron is an essential contributor
  for metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells, supporting key processes such as DNA
  synthesis, energy production and cell proliferation. (1) In the hypoxic TME, the
  expression of HIF-1α is increased, leading to an upregulation of ferritin (FTL/FTH)
  and TfR1, which enhances iron uptake and storage to sustain GBM cell growth. (2)
  The accumulation of iron triggers the activation of AKT signaling pathway, which
  phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3β. (3) This inhibition prevents the degradation
  of β-catenin, (4) allowing β-catenin to accumulate and to translocate into the nucleus,
  where it binds to transcription factors and activates genes involved in cell proliferation.
  Additionally, the RTK/mTORC2 signaling pathway contributes to the metabolic reprogramming
  of GBM cells. (5-6) Activation of mTORC2 by the RTK promotes PDH activity in the
  mitochondria where, (7) by interacting with the transcription co-activator PKM2
  enhances the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. (8) In the nucleus, acetyl-CoA
  serves to histone acetylation, (9) a process that promotes the transcription of
  iron-related genes, such as TfR1, FTL and FTH1, further increasing iron uptake and
  driving tumor growth. TME: tumor microenvironment; HIF-1α: hypoxia-inducible factor
