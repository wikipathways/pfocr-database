caption: The RAS pathway. (A) Growth factor binding to RTKs, such as stem cell factor
  receptor (KIT), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or platelet-derived growth
  factor receptor (PDGFR), leads to receptor autophosphorylation and recruitment of
  the adaptor protein growth factor receptor bound 2 (GRB2). In turn, GRB2 recruits
  the guanine exchange factor SOS1/2, activating RAS. A main effector of the RAS pathway
  is the RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) cascade that leads to the transcription of different target
  genes (e.g. FOS, MYC, MDM2, MITF) implicated in cell proliferation, survival and
  cell cycle progression. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PI3K) pathway is another important effector
  of active RAS, promoting cell growth and implicated in melanoma development. Gray
  lines represent regulatory feedback loops. These include direct phosphorylation
  of SOS1/2 and RAFs by ERK, leading to dissociation of GRB2–SOS1/2 and RAS–RAF complexes,
  respectively, as well as the transcriptional induction of negative regulators, such
  as members of the DUSP, SPROUTY and SPRED families, i.e. DUSP4, DUSP5, DUSP6, SPRY1,
  SPRY2, SPRY3, SPRY4, SPRED1 and SPRED2. P, phosphate; SPRY, sprouty RTK signaling
  antagonists 1,2, 3 and 4. (B) Regulation of RAS activity by guanine nucleotide exchange
  factors (GEFs), such as SOS1 or 2, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), such as
  NF1. GEFs stimulate the formation of the GTP-bound active state, whereas GAPs catalyze
  GTP hydrolysis and favor reverting to the GDP-bound inactive state.
