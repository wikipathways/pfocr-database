  ABA and ethylene biosynthesis pathways, and regulatory mechanisms in D. chrysotoxum

caption: Increased gene expression during the four developmental stages of flowers
  is shown by thick green arrows, while decreased gene expression is shown by thick
  red arrows. The enzymes or genes are indicated alongside the arrows. The dashed
  lines suggest that there are multiple steps. Carotenes are shown in orange, and
  light gold indicates xanthophylls. ABA-related genes are shown in yellow, and ethylene-related
  genes are shown in light green. CCDs (orange arrows) regulate carotenoid accumulation.
  Plastoglobule-localized metallopeptidase 48 (PGM48) is hypothesized to regulate
  CCD4. The orange protein regulates PSY activity, acting as a chaperone. ClpB3 (red
  arrow) regulates the activity of DXS, acting as an enzyme in the MEP pathway
