caption: 'Routes of interaction between epoxyeicosanoid and endocannabinoid signaling
  pathways. In the canonical EETs signaling pathway, EETs are produced from arachidonic
  acid (AA) by cytochrome P450 epoxygenase (CYP EPOX) enzymes. EETs exert their cellular
  actions indirectly through a putative G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) or by directly
  stimulating ion channels such as the transient receptor potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4)
  cation channel or the peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR) nuclear
  receptors. The canonical endocannabinoid signaling pathway includes the synthesis
  of the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) or 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) which act
  as agonists at the CB-1 and CB-2 GPCRs. AEA also activates the TRPV1 cation channel.
  Both AEA and 2-AG can be hydrolyzed by fatty acid amido-hydroxylase or other enzymes
  to AA which feed directly into the CYP EPOX – EETs signaling cascade. Both AEA and
  2-AG can be epoxidized by CYP EPOX to produce EET glycerol esters (GEETs) and EET
  ethanolamides (EET-EAs). GEETs are high affinity CB-1 and CB-2 agonists while EET-EA
  activates CB2 with high affinity. PL: phospholipids; N-AT: N-acetyl transferase;
  PIP2: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PLC: phospholipase C; DAG: diacylglycerol;
  DAG-L: DAG lipase;'
