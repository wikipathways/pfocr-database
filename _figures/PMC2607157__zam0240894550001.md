caption: Overview of different pathways involved in FA synthesis and storage and degradation
  of neutral lipids. Synthesis of FA (Acyl-CoA) is catalyzed by the FA synthesis complex
  from the basic blocks acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. Acyl-CoA can be stored either
  as SE or as TAG. The synthesis of SE is catalyzed by SE synthases homologous to
  the human acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase and their mobilization by the SE
  hydrolases, releasing sterol and FFA. The synthesis of TAG require acyl-CoA and
  G3P. G3P could be produced from glycerol or from DHAP. GUT1 encodes a glycerol kinase
  that converts glycerol to G3P in the cytosol. The product of this reaction can be
  oxidized to DHAP by the G3PDH encoded by the GUT2 gene. DHAP can enter either glycolysis
  or gluconeogenesis. G3P could also be used as a skeleton for TAG synthesis. Three
  acyls are added to the G3P backbone to give TAG, and this process requires four
  enzymatic steps. First, an acyl is added at the sn-1 position of G3P by a G3P acyltransferase
  to produce LPA, and then a second acyl is added at the sn-2 position by a 1-acyl
  G3P acyltransferase to produce PA, which is then dephosphorylated by PAP, yielding
  DAG. Finally, the third acyl can be added at the sn-3 position either by the acetyl-CoA-dependent
  pathway (directly from acyl-CoA) or by the acetyl-CoA-independent pathway (from
  a glycerophospholipid). TAG can be mobilized by the conversion to FFA and DAG upon
  hydrolysis by TAG lipase. The FFA can then be degraded in the β-oxidation pathway.
  This pathway requires four enzymatic steps (for a review, see reference ). In Y.
  lipolytica, six genes (POX1 to POX6) that code for acyl-CoA oxidases are involved
  in the second step of β-oxidation (, ). Proteins encoded by the genes in parentheses
  were found to be associated with lipid particles (LB) in Y. lipolytica.
