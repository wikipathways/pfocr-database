caption: Feedback regulation system possibly existing in the Thermoplasma-type MVA
  pathway to control downstream isoprenoid metabolism in P. torridus.Dark and pale
  blue arrows indicate the enzyme reactions whose metabolic flux might be temporarily
  increased or kept constant through feedback activation of MBD by GGPP, respectively.
  The names of major enzymes involved are shown in boxes. GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate;
  GGPPsyn, GGPP synthase; IPPiso, IPP isomerase; MVA, mevalonate; PPPsyn, polyprenyl
  diphosphate synthase.
