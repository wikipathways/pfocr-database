caption: (a) One-carbon metabolism. Folic acid (FA) is reduced to dihydrofolate and
  tetrahydrofolate (THF) by dihydrofolate reductase. 5,10-methylene-THF is formed
  by serine hydroxymethyl-transferase through the transfer of one-carbon units from
  serine to THF, which is for thymidylate synthesis or reduced to 5-methyl-THF. Folate
  obtained through the diet can enter one-carbon metabolism as 5-methyl-THF. A one-carbon
  unit is transferred from 5-methyl-THF to homocysteine by methionine synthase using
  vitamin B12 as a cofactor to form methionine and THF. Homocysteine can also be remethylated
  in the liver by betaine homocysteine methyltransferase using betaine as the methyl
  donor. Methionine is activated to from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) by methionine
  adenosyltransferase enzymes. SAM serves as the methyl donor for numerous reactions
  including arsenic methylation and biosynthesis of creatine, generating the methylated
  products and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH, which serves as a product inhibitor
  for most methyltransferase enzymes, hydrolyzed to homocysteine, and can either be
  remethylated to methionine or be directed towards the transsulfuration pathway.
  Adapted with permission from []. (b) Major consumers of SAM. An estimated 50% of
  SAM is consumed by the final step of endogenous creatine synthesis by GAMT, and
  40% of SAM is consumed by phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. (c) Creatine metabolism
  and the methionine cycle. In the kidney, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT)
  produces guanidinoacetate (GAA). Dietary and/or supplemental creatine reduces GAA
  biosynthesis through the pretranslational inhibition of AGAT. GAA is released from
  the kidney and taken up by the liver where it is methylated using the methyl donor
  SAM to form creatine and SAH. SAH is hydrolyzed to homocysteine. 5-mTHF can regulate
  SAM and SAH levels through potent inhibition of GNMT. Creatine is transported to
  tissues and phosphorylated to phosphocreatine. Creatine and phosphocreatine are
  converted to creatinine and excreted in urine.
