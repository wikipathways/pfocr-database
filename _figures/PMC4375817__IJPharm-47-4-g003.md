  protein kinase/ERK kinases)/cyclic AMP response element-binding protein signaling
  is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and protection of neurons. BDNF
  signaling causes deactivation of C-jun N-terminal kinase, thereby inhibiting destabilization
  of microtubules and maintaining neuronal dynamic stability. DAG=Diacylglycerol,
