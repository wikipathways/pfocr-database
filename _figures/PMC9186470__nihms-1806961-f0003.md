caption: The pathway driving axonal death in neurodegeneration. An initial injurious
  stimulus directly or indirectly causes energetic decline and, subsequently, depletion
  of Nmnat2 and NAD+, which may be counteracted by the presence of the Wallerian degeneration
  slow protein (WldS) or inactivation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Phr1 (PAM, Highwire,
  Rpm1). These initial steps (depicted in light blue), occurring prior to overt axon
  loss, can largely be rescued (e.g., by enhancing axoglial metabolic coupling [AMC]).
  Once the damage progresses and SARM1 is fully activated, the execution phase (depicted
  in yellow) of pAxD is initiated and culminates in structural axon disintegration.
  Axons in this last stage are likely beyond repair, and approaches that suppress
  the final structural breakdown (such as chemical calcium chelation) merely structurally
  preserve axons that remain sick and energetically deprived.
