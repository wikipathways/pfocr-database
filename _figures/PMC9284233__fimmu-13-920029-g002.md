caption: Schematic illustration of glycolysis regulating innate immune cell function.
  Glycolysis is the main energy production pathway for neutrophils. Impairing glycolysis
  and PPP can destroy neutrophil function, including chemotaxis and ROS production,
  even phagocytosis. NETs formation is dependent on adequate glucose flux, G6P, NOX2,
  and NAD+/NADPH. The TLR/AMPK/mTORC1 regulates glycolysis-dependent antimicrobial
  activity in monocytes. TLR/AMPK/mTORC1 axis is also responsible for M1-type macrophage
  induction, expression of glycolytic enzymes (GLUT1 and PKM2) in these cells and
  their IL-12 secretion. Solute carrier family 15 member A4 (SLC15A4) is likely to
  maintain the interaction of AMPK and mTORC1 by acting as a scaffold. PKM2 in M1
  macrophages contributes to IL-1β transcription via STAT3 signaling. Both enhanced
  PPP and IDO-1 in M1 macrophages facilitate kynurenine accumulation, stimulating
  mTORC1 activity in T cells. Akt/mTORC1-mediated glycolysis also affects M2-like
  macrophage differentiation and gene profile expression (Arg1, Cdh1, YM-1, Mrc1,
  and resistin-like β) when OXPHOS in macrophages is inhibited. The interferon regulatory
  factor 4 (IRF4), which is downstream of the IL-4 receptor α/STAT6 and colony-stimulating
  factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)/mTORC2 signaling axis, promotes glycolysis (enhanced expression
  of LDHA, GAPDH and HK2) during M2 activation. DCs activated by TLRs depend on glycolysis
  flux to fulfill metabolic and functional requirements, including secretion of TNF-α,
  IL-6 and IL-12. TBK1/Ikkϵ-mediated Akt phosphorylation responds to lipopolysaccharide
  stimulation of TLRs on DCs. p-Akt/mTORC1 immediately promotes the transcription
  of HK2 and LDHA via HIF-1α. Cxc chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7)-mediated HIF-1α induction
  contributes to DC migration.
