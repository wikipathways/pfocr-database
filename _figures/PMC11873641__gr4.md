caption: Intricate signaling pathways linking obesity to cancer progression. This
  figure provides a detailed account of the multiple signaling pathways implicated
  in connecting obesity to cancer. Insulin and IGF-1, when bound to their respective
  receptors (IR and IGF-1R), trigger the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. This cascade
  promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Adiponectin, a hormone released
  predominantly by adipose tissue, interacts with ADIPO-R1 and ADIPO-R2. This binding
  initiates the LKB1/AMPK pathway which subsequently inhibits the mTOR pathway, acting
  as a counter-mechanism against tumor proliferation and metastasis. The insulin-driven
  PI3K/AKT pathway facilitates glucose uptake into cells via glucose transporters.
  Elevated glucose concentrations then amplify the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, further
  propelling tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Leptin, another hormone from adipose
  tissue, upon binding to its receptor OB-R, instigates the MAPK pathway. This cascade
  enhances cellular proliferation, augmenting tumor growth. Inflammatory cytokines
  IL-6 and TNFα, once bound to their receptors (IL-6R and TNF-R), activate the JAK/STAT/NF-kB
  signaling pathway. This cascade not only shields cells from apoptosis but also accentuates
  proliferation and metastasis. RAS and myc, being oncogenic proteins, modulate the
  expression of various metabolic enzymes. Their actions ramp up glycolysis, providing
  an energetic and metabolic advantage to tumor cells, leading to accelerated proliferation.
