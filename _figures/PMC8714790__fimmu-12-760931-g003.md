caption: KEGG Pathways enriched for differentially expressed genes in ileum (A) and
  jejunum (B) showing interactions between pathways. Each node represents a pathway
  and the color of the node represents the level of significance (the deeper the color
  of a node, the higher the level of significance). The size of the node represents
  the number of mapped genes (the bigger the node, the higher the number of mapped
  genes). Straight lines connects pathways.
