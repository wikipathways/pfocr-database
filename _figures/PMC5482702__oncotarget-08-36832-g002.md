caption: In well-oxygenated cells, the hydroxylation of HIF-α catalyzed by PHDs triggers
  VHL-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation into the proteasome. In contrast,
  low oxygen availability stabilizes HIF-α by compromising PHD activity. Moreover,
  activation of oncogenes, loss of tumour suppressors, growth factors, specific prevalent
  mutations found in HMs and factors involved in haematopoiesis are also able to upregulate
  HIF-α independently of oxygen availability. Once stabilized, HIF-α translocates
  to the nucleus, binds to HIF-β and regulates the expression of genes promoting tumour
  progression.
