caption: The effects of decreased ODC activity and spermine supplementation. (a) Decreased
  ODC activity increases decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM) concentrations,
  because the aminopropyl group from dcSAM is not required for polyamine synthesis.
  Increased dcSAM inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity, resulting in enhanced
  aberrant methylation of whole genome and enhanced demethylation of ITGAL (LFA-1
  promoter); (b) Increased spermine from extracellular sources suppresses adenosylmethionine
  decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) activity due to negative feedback to maintain intracellular
  polyamine concentrations. Decreased dcSAM concentrations induced by decreased AdoMetDC
  activity results in increased DNMT activity, resulting in recovery of the ability
  to maintain the methylation status of the entire genome and enhancement of ITGAL
  methylation. T-bar indicates the inhibitory activity. Black arrow indicates the
  metabolic pathway or flow of substances. Brown arrow indicates the increase (upward
  arrow) or decrease (downward arrow) of the amount of substance or the enzymatic
  activity.
