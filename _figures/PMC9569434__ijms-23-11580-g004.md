caption: DEGs involved in plant hormone metabolism and signal transduction pathways.
  (A) Pathway in auxin polar transport and signal transduction, (B) Pathway in GA
  metabolism and signal transduction, (C) Pathway in CTK metabolism and signal transduction.
  The expression data are the TPM values of the samples; red indicates upregulated
  expression, and blue indicates downregulated expression.
