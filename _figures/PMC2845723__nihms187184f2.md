caption: The bile salt synthetic pathway. The enzymatic pathways involved in bile
  salt synthesis have been elucidated only in humans and rodents The pathway depicted
  is the so-called ‘neutral’ pathway, as opposed to an ‘acidic’ pathway that modifies
  the side-chain first () and likely is a later evolutionary innovation. The ultimate
  production of C24 bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) require multiple
  changes to the cholesterol structure including 7α-hydroxylation, isomerization of
  the C-5–C-6 double bond to form a Δ4 compound coupled with oxidation of the 3β-hydroxy
  group to a 3-oxo group, stereospecific reduction of the 3-oxo group to a 3α-hydroxy
  group, hydroxylation of the terminal carbon of the side-chain, oxidation of the
  side-chain, and shortening of the side-chain. Animals using C27 bile alcohols or
  C27 bile acids as their primary bile salts presumably require fewer enzymatic steps
  than those synthesizing C24 bile acids. The enzymes involved in 5α-reduction leading
  to 5α-bile salts are unknown. The stem C27 bile alcohol would be 3α,7α,27-trihydroxy-5β-cholestane.
  The stem C27 bile acid would be 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholestan-27-oic acid, but this
  bile acid occurs very rarely in fish. Note that some steps in the pathway require
  more than one enzyme (e.g., isomerization of the 3-hydroxy group) whereas some enzymes
  (e.g., CYP27A1) can catalyze more than one reaction. Additional hydroxyl groups
  may be added to the nucleus or side-chain; hydroxylation may occur on an intermediate
  or on the completed stem bile acid.
