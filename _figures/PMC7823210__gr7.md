caption: 'Summary diagram. Left: After partial hepatectomy, Nox4 deleted mice show
  earlier liver/body weight recovery, concomitant with higher proliferation, up-regulation
  of Myc and down-regulation of the TGF-β pathway. Right: Primary hepatocytes from
  Nox4 deleted mice show higher proliferation in response to FBS, while maintaining
  TGF-β-induced growth inhibitory response.'
