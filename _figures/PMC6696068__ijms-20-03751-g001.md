caption: 'The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Left panel: in the absence
  of Wnt ligand, β-catenin is sequestered by a protein complex composed of dishevelled
  (Dvl), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), Axin1/2, Wilms tumor gene on X chromosome
  protein (WTX) and two kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of β-catenin,
  CK1α (casein kinase 1 alpha) and GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta). Then,
  YAP/TAZ (yes-associated protein/transcriptional co-Activator with a PDZ-binding
  domain) proteins recruit β-TrCP (beta-transducin-repeat-containing protein), a ubiquitin
  ligase responsible for the ubiquitination of β-catenin and its degradation by the
  proteasome pathway. In the nucleus, the transcriptional proteins of the TCF/LEF
  family (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor) interact with the transcriptional
  repressors groucho/TLE (transducin-like cnhancer of split), recruiting histone deacetylases
  (HDACs) responsible for repressing transcription. Right panel: Binding of the Wnt
  ligands to the frizzled (Fzd) receptor and low-density-lipoprotein-related protein
  5/6 (LRP5/6) co-receptor complex induces the recruitment of the scaffold protein
  Dvl to Fzd and leads to LRP5/6 phosphorylation (P) by CK1α and GSK3β kinases. The
  β-catenin destruction complex is then trapped to the membrane through Axin/Fzd interaction,
  leading to its inactivation. In parallel, Axin proteins are degraded following poly-ADP-ribosylation
  by tankyrases (TNKS). Newly synthesized β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and
  translocates into the nucleus where it interacts with the transcription factors
  of the TCF/LEF family and with histones modifying co-activators p300 or CREB binding
  protein (CBP), B cell CLL/lymphoma 9 (BCL-9), brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), and
  pygopus. These transcription complexes activate the transcription of target genes
  such as cMYC, AXIN2, BIRC5 or CCND1.'
