caption: Integrin-dependent adhesion and mechanotransduction pathways. Cells constantly
  sample the biochemical composition of the surrounding ECM using cell surface receptors
  such as integrins, discoidin domain receptors (DDRs) and syndecans and modulate
  intracellular signaling pathways accordingly. Integrins crosstalk with multiple
  transmembrane proteins including growth factor receptors (GFRs). The crosstalk between
  integrins and adJacent transmembrane molecules can synergize to potentiate Rho GTPase
  activity, focal adhesion assembly, kinase signaling and stimulate gene transcription
  to induce tumor cell growth, survival and motility and may even induce differentiation.
  (Left) When adhesion signaling is low, integrins remain in an inactive conformation.
  (Right) Binding of integrins to ECM ligands can trigger the recruitment and activation
  of talin and the subsequent association of molecules such as vinculin and paxillin
  and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
  that promote the assembly of adhesion complexes. For example, paxillin and FAK form
  a complex with Src kinase to activate the PI3K-Akt pro-survival signaling pathway.
  The crosstalk between integrins and GFR pathways can also potentiate Rho GTPase
  signaling. RhoA stimulates ROCK kinase activity, which increases the level of phosphorylated
  myosin light chain (MLC) to stimulate actomyosin contraction. Rac, Rho, and Cdc42
  GTPases also promote the formation of invasive cellular protrusions, such as lamellipodia,
  filopodia, and invadosomes. Upon ECM ligand ligation, DDRs and syndecans can recruit
  diverse signaling molecules such as myosin IIA to promote cell contractibility and
  migration. Cells additionally interrogate the mechanical properties of the ECM using
  integrins through a process termed mechanotransduction. Stiff substrates promote
  integrin clustering, adhesion signaling, and TWIST1 and YAP translocation into the
  nucleus to activate transcription programs that promote epithelial mesenchymal transition.
  In addition, a bulky glycocalyx on the plasma membrane can directly exert stress
  on integrins to enhance their activation and once ligated induces a kinetic trap
  that physically clusters integrins to promote their assembly into focal adhesions
  that enhance adhesion signaling.

  description: Integrin-dependent adhesion and mechanotransduction pathways. Cells
    constantly sample the biochemical composition of the surrounding ECM using cell
    surface receptors such as integrins, discoidin domain receptors (DDRs) and syndecans
    and modulate intracellular signaling pathways accordingly. Integrins crosstalk
    with multiple transmembrane proteins including growth factor receptors (GFRs).
    The crosstalk between integrins and adJacent transmembrane molecules can synergize
    to potentiate Rho GTPase activity, focal adhesion assembly, kinase signaling and
    stimulate gene transcription to induce tumor cell growth, survival and motility
    and may even induce differentiation. (Left) When adhesion signaling is low, integrins
    remain in an inactive conformation. (Right) Binding of integrins to ECM ligands
    can trigger the recruitment and activation of talin and the subsequent association
    of molecules such as vinculin and paxillin and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and
    the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that promote the assembly of adhesion
    complexes. For example, paxillin and FAK form a complex with Src kinase to activate
    the PI3K-Akt pro-survival signaling pathway. The crosstalk between integrins and
    GFR pathways can also potentiate Rho GTPase signaling. RhoA stimulates ROCK kinase
    activity, which increases the level of phosphorylated myosin light chain (MLC)
