caption: 'Sesquiterpenoid biosynthetic pathway. Intermediate products in the early
  canonic mevalonate pathway (Panel A) and the downstream juvenile hormone (JH) branch
  of insects (Panel B) are depicted together with the names of the genes encoding
  enzymes for their conversion: AACT (acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase), HMGS (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase), HMGR (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase), MevK (mevalonate kinase),
  MevPK (phosphomevalonate kinase), MevPPD (diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase), IPPI
  (isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase), GPPS (geranyl diphosphate synthase), FPPS (farnesyl
  diphosphate synthase), JHAMT (juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase). Dermatophagoides
  pteronyssinus (Dp) gene orthologs are shown in blue in brackets'
