caption: (A) KEGG analysis shows the list of DEGs involved in Toll-like receptor signaling
  pathway. The orange, green, and white colors indicate significantly increased, significantly
  decreased, and unchanged gene expression between normal vs UVA-treated S HDFs, respectively.
  (B) NS and S HDFs were irradiated with UVA (1 J/cm2) and cultured for the indicated
  time periods (0, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h). IL-6 and IL-8 production levels in the culture
  media were measured by ELISA. The results are expressed as mean ± SEM of three different
  experiments. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 vs. NS HDFs at each timepoints.
