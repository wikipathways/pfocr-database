caption: Diagram summarizes organization of the basal ganglia nuclei and their projections.
  (A) The substantia nigra pars compacta (Snc) sends excitatory and inhibitory projections
  to the striatum. Latter subsequently projects to the basal ganglia outflow nuclei—the
  globus pallidum internus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) via, parallel,
  direct and indirect pathways. The direct pathway neurons in the striatum receive
  excitatory projections from the SNc and sends direct inhibitory projections to GPi
  and SNr, while inhibitory projections from SNc are sent to the striatal indirect
  pathway. The indirect pathway, via globus pallidum externus (GPe) and subthalamic
  nucleus (STN), influences the SNr and GPi. As a result of these connections the
  dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, as seen in Parkinson's disease, leads to disinhibition
  of GPi and SNr. Such dysinhibtion leads to inappropriate inhibition of the superior
  colliculus (SC) (relative thickness of the arrows represents the strength of projection
  (B). [Figure and corresponding legend modified with permission from ()].
