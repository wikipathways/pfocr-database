caption: Following synaptic activity and postsynaptic neuronal excitation, the metabotropic
  glutamate receptors mGluR5 and the ionotropic glutamate receptors NMDAR will allow
  intracellular Ca+2 levels to be elevated either from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  or by directly entering from the plasma membrane. This Ca+2 elevation will activate
  the downstream protein kinase ERK1/2, which in turn will phosphorylate and activate
  CREB. 5HT2AR that share the same signaling pathway with mGluR5 (Gaq subunit) will
  also stimulate ERK1,2 and lead to subsequent CREB activation. In addition, the dopaminergic
  system via the D2R signaling pathway and regulation of PKA, can modulate the CREB-mediated
  transcription of activity dependent genes. Notably, the glutamatergic and the dopaminergic
  systems are well-known to be dysregulated in SCZ and BD subjects. Following the
  CREB-mediated neuronal activity dependent mRNA transcription of EIF4A3 and FUS,
  these mRNAs will be translocated to the cytosol for protein translation, will then
  enter to the nucleus, and act as RBPs promoting circHomer1 biogenesis. Conversely,
  the BDNF-TrkB pathway, that acts as a negative feedback loop for CREB modulation,
  is not shown to be implicated in circHomer1 biogenesis
