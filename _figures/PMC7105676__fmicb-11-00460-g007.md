caption: Hypothetical model for the regulatory pathway of FlhF in the C. jejuni flagellar
  system. C. jejuni flagellar genes are classified into three cascades, class I genes
  (red) are σ70 (rpoD) dependent, while class II (blue) and class III (green) genes
  require σ54 (rpoN) and σ28 (fliA) factor, respectively. The σ70 factor-dependent
  class I genes are constitutively expressed. FlhF acts before the flagella export
  apparatus (FEA) formation. The FEA formation will also be detected by the FlgSR
  two-component system (TCS) and activates the σ54 factor-dependent class II genes.
  After FlgM is secreted from the cell, the inhibition of the σ28 factor-dependent
  class III genes is relieved and they are expressed. In our study, we speculate that
  FlhF may directly regulate the synthesis of class I and III flagellar genes by binding
  to the rpoD and fliA promoters, activating σ70 and σ28 factor respectively. For
  the class II flagellar genes, FlhF may bind PflgS to stimulate flgS phosphorylation
  of flgR, cooperating with σ54 factor, indirectly to initiate class II gene transcription
  synthesis. In addition FlhF may also directly regulate the specific class II gene
  flgI by binding to its promoter. “PR” signifies “positive regulating” and is presented
  with a green arrow. The black curved arrow represents the physiological function
  and the dotted arrow indicates inhibition.
