caption: (i) Biogenesis and secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as MVs
  and exosomes. Sorting of cargo molecules in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) occur in
  an endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent manner. Exosomes
  are of endosomal origin and their secretion is mediated by Rab GTPase family proteins
  and the Wnt5a-Ca++ non-canonical pathway. In an alternative pathway, the release
  of MVs is governed by ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and membrane lipid microdomains.
  (ii) Uptake of EVs by recipient cells or binding of surface ligands of EVs to recipient
  cells is followed by downstream molecular cascades resulting in processes like angiogenesis,
  therapy resistance, immune modulation, and metabolic reprogramming, (A) angiogenesis;
  tumor-derived EVs modulate the formation of blood vessels, which supports glioma
  progression, (B) therapy resistance; exosomes or MVs carry cytokines, which may
  further activate STAT3 protein via cytokine receptors and ultimately leads to proneural–mesenchymal
  transition (PMT) and a radiation-resistant phenotype of glioma (). Activation of
  STAT3 signaling also promotes temozolomide resistance of glioma (). (C) Immune modulation;
  glioma-derived exosomes are able to inactivate immune responses by inhibiting T-cell
  maturation and changes in phenotypes of monocytes and (D) metabolic reprogramming;
  possible through transfer of metabolic enzymes to tumor-associated cells via EVs
  and in turn tumor cells acquire energy and nutrients, which support glioma growth.
