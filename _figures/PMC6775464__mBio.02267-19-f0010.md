caption: The proposed regulatory mechanism of melanin-regulating signaling pathways
  in C. neoformans. In response to nutrient (particularly glucose) starvation, expression
  of the LAC1 laccase gene, which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme for eumelanin production
  in C. neoformans, is induced in manners dependent on Bzp4, Usv101, and Mbs1. Hob1
  regulates nutrient starvation-mediated induction of BZP4 and basal expression of
  USV101 and MBS1. The RAM pathway, consisting of Cbk1 and Kic1 kinases, and Gsk3
  mainly control induction of HOB1, whereas the Pro1 kinase weakly regulates it. Pkh202
  suppresses nutrient starvation-mediated repression of MBS1. Bzp4 and Usv101 undergo
  nuclear translation upon nutrient starvation, but Mbs1 is constitutively localized
  in the nucleus. Both Gsk3 and Kic1 kinases regulate nuclear translocation of Bzp4,
  and Kic1 represses nuclear translocation of Usv101. BZP4 expression is also weakly
  regulated by Vps15, Met3, and Mps1 kinases. The HOG pathway negatively regulates
  BZP4 induction. However, the cAMP/PKA pathway and the Mec1 kinase promote LAC1 induction
  in a manner independent of Bzp4, Usv101, Hob1, and Mbs1 TFs. Both HOG and cAMP pathways
  promote induction of KIC1 in the RAM pathway upon nutrient starvation. The Vps15-Vps30-Vps34
  complex is likely to be involved in melanin (MEL) production through vesicle trafficking.
  The cAMP pathway is also involved in laccase localization.
