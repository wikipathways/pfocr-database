caption: Proposed mechanism for MAP4K3 cell death signaling. Activation of mTORC1
  by MAP4K3 modulates the activity of eIF4B and eIF4E. Of these, eIF4E is a component
  of the CAP-binding complex eIF4F whereas eIF4B promotes the RNA helicase activity
  of eIF4A (reviewed in ref. ). eIF4F is a modulator of eukaryotic mRNA stability
  (). MAP4K3 signaling leads to up-regulation of the BH3-only proteins PUMA and BAD
  in an mTORC1-dependent manner. PUMA and BAD, in turn, are capable of neutralizing
  anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, leading to BAX activation and caspase-dependent
  cell death. In parallel, MAP4K3 signaling through JNK induces BIM phosphorylation.
  The direct activation of BAX by BIM, together with the neutralization of BCL-XL
  by PUMA or BAD, results in activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.
