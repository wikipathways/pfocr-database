caption: Expression Profiles of the RNAs Encoding Enzymes of Met Metabolism.The REI
  of the Met metabolism genes represented on the arrays is mapped onto a representation
  of the pathways of Met metabolism. Three enzymes that are involved in the cycle
  of active methyl groups are shown on the left. Two other genes encoding enzymes
  on the pathway of Met synthesis are shown on the right. Each value represents the
  mean and standard deviation of three independent replicate experiments for each
  stage and all cDNAs on the arrays that encode the same enzyme.
