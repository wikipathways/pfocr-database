caption: Environment stress, including consuming high glycemic index diet, causes
  protein denaturation or unfolding, resulting in exposure of degradation signals
  (deg) and triggering their ubiquitination and degradation. Majority of ubiquitinated
  proteins are degraded by the proteasome, but some ubiquitinated proteins are degraded
  by lysosome via autophagy, particularly when the function of the proteasome is impaired
  or overburdened. The rapid degradation of damaged proteins by concerned action of
  the UPP and LPP prevents the accumulation of cytotoxic damaged proteins and maintains
  the homeostasis of the proteome, such as those observed in young and healthy tissues.
  When the levels of damaged proteins overwhelmed the capacity of the UPP and LPP,
  damaged protein will accumulate. Some of the damaged protein may cross link forming
  the higher mass aggregates noted in the figures above. Accumulated oligomerized
  damaged proteins may impair the proteolytic machinery, further compromising the
  proteome and resulting in diseases related to accumulation of damaged proteins,
  such in the retina/RPE of AMD patients.
