caption: Schematic overview of previously reported metabolic pathways of LCA and CDCA
  in the liver. The hydrophobicity indices also are presented if the data were available
  from the literature. Conjugation pathways are only shown for LCA and CDCA, but other
  bile acids are also subject to glycine-, taurine-, sulfate-, or glucuronide-conjugation.
