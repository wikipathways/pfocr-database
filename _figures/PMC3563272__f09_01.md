caption: 'Fatty Acid Elongation and Cuticular Wax BiosynthesisPathways for the formation
  in epidermal cells of very long chain fatty acyl-CoAs (VLCFAs) and cuticular waxes.
  Analogous FA elongation pathways occur in all cells to produce VLCFA for sphingolipids,
  and in seeds for elongation of 18:1 to 20:1 and 2:1. Saturated C16 and C18 fatty
  acids, produced in the plastid (FAS), are esterifed to coenzyme A (CoA) by LACS.
  16:0- and 18:0-CoA esters are elongated by reiteratively adding a two-carbon unit
  to the carboxy terminal to generate VLCFA wax precursors between 20 and 34 carbons
  in length. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated fatty acid elongase consists
  of four enzymatic activities (KCS, KCR, HACD, and ECR) that work sequentially to
  elongate the fully saturated acyl-CoA chains. Once the VLCFAs are synthesized, they
  are converted to cuticular waxes by the coordinated activities of a number of enzymes.
  A proportion of the elongated acyl-CoAs are hydrolyzed by a thioesterase to release
  free fatty acids. Conversely, free VLCFAs can be reactivated into CoA esters by
  LACS1. However, most of the elongated fatty acyl-CoAs enter one of two wax biosynthetic
  pathways: an alkane-forming pathway (also known as the decarbonylation pathway)
  that produces aldehydes, alkanes, secondary alcohols, and ketones, and a primary
  alcohol forming pathway (also known as the acyl reduction pathway) that produces
  primary alcohols and wax esters. The waxes are transported to the plasma membrane
  (PM) by an unknown mechanism, and transport across the PM is facilitated by ABC
  transporters (CER5 and ABCG). Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) may be involved in
  transport of waxes across the cell wall in order to reach the final destination
  at the cuticle. The elongase, decarbonylation, and acyl reduction pathways are localized
  to the ER or ER membrane, however the location of the LACS enzymes has yet to be
  established.Abbreviations: ABCG, ATP-binding cassette transporter G subfamily; ACC,
