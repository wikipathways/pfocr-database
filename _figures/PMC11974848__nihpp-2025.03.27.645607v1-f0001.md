caption: '(A) Representative HPLC chromatograms of methanolic extracts from eleven
  tomato organs and tissues, together with authentic standards of four 3-O-glucosylated
  flavonols (K3, K4, Q3, and Q4) and two flavonol 3-O-galactosides (K1 and Q1). The
  pollen extract shown in the chromatogram was extracted in 50% methanol at a concentration
  approximately 6.2 times more diluted compared to other organs. Peak 1 indicated
  with a blue dot is highly accumulated in pollen grains, while no peak 1 was detected
  in the rest of samples. Peak 1 characterized as K2 (kaempferol 3-O-glucosyl(1→2)galactoside)
  in Figure S1. Chlorogenic acid, a caffoylquinate, are marked in the chromatograms.
  (B) Quantification of three major flavonol glycosides (K2, K4 and Q4) across different
  tomato organs detected with HPLC. The data presented are the mean concentrations
  (pmol mg−1 fresh weight) of flavonol glycosides and their standard deviations (n
  = 4). Compounds that were below the detection limit in certain organs are marked
  as not detected (n.d.). (C) Simplified biosynthetic pathway of flavonol glycosides
  in tomato. Flavonol biosynthesis begins with the conversion of phenylalanine into
  dihydroflavonols, mediated by several enzymatic steps. Dihydroflavonols are then
  converted to flavonols (kaempferol and quercetin) by flavonol synthase (FLS). Kaempferol
  (K) and quercetin (Q) undergo glycosylation by flavonol 3-O-glycosyltransferases
  (F3GT), leading to the production of initial glycosylated intermediates, such as
  kaempferol 3-O-galactoside (K-gal; K1), kaempferol 3-O-glucoside (K-glu; K3), quercetin
  3-O-galactoside (Q-gal; Q1), and quercetin 3-O-glucoside (Q-glu; Q3). These intermediates
  are further modified by flavonol 3-O-glycoside: glycosyltransferases (F3GGT), generating
  secondary glycosides, including kaempferol 3-O-glucosyl(1→2)galactoside (K-gal-glu;
  K2), kaempferol 3-O-glucosyl(1→6)rhamnoside (K-glu-rha; K4), quercetin 3-O-glucosyl(1→2)galactoside
  (Q-gal-glu; Q2), and quercetin 3-O-glucosyl(1→6)rhamnoside (Q-glu-rha; Q4). Abbreviations
  used in chemical structures are K, kaempferol; Q, quercetin; gal, galactose; glu,
  glucose; rha, rhamnose'
