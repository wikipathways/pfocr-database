caption: DNA damage can lead to different outcomes depending on the cell cycle stage
  of the cell. (A) In cycling cells, IR activates p53 through the DDR pathway. The
  presence of an active CycB/Cdk1complex facilitates the binding of p53 to the proapoptotic
  genes and therefore the induction of apoptosis. (B) In induced cell cycle arrested
  cells p53 is initially activated by DDR pathway, however since these cells do not
  have active Cdk1, p53 fails to induce the expression of rpr and hid. (C) In embryonic
  post-mitotic cells, the epigenetic silencing of the IRER interferes with the ability
  of p53 to regulate the expression of the proapoptotic genes. (D) In endocycle cells
  even though the DDR pathway is active in response to IR, apoptosis is not induced.
  This is due to at least two mechanisms of control. On one hand, an epigenetic silencing
  at the regulatory region of the proapoptotic genes blocks the ability of p53 to
  induce their expression. Secondly, the levels of p53 in these cells are significatively
  lower that in mitotic tissues through p53 targeted degradation by the proteasome.
