caption: Agonist binding to opioid receptors induces pertussis toxin sensitive G protein
  coupling and activation, followed by rapid phosphorylation of the receptor by G–protein–coupled
  receptor kinases (GRKs). Subsequently, the Gα and Gβγ subunits dissociate to modulate
  ion channel conductance and several secondary messengers. Gα rapidly activates inwardly
  rectifying potassium channels resulting in hyperpolarization of the cell. The Gα
  subunit also inhibits adenylate cyclase activity and induces phospholipase C /protein
  kinase C (PLCβ/PKC) signaling. Inhibition of calcium conductance and the subsequent
  reduction in calcium dependent neurotransmitter release is regulated by the Gβγ
  subunit, which can also induce phosphatidylinositol–4, 5–bisphosphate 3–kinase (PI3K)/AKT
  pathway. Desensitization of phosphorylated opioid receptors is dependent on β–arrestin,
  which interferes with further G protein coupling. Following β–arrestin desensitization,
  the AP2 adaptor complex facilitates clathrin–mediated endocytosis into vesicles.
  Receptor internalization is then followed by recycling or lysosomal degradation.
  Agonist–stimulated β–arrestin also scaffolds mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  kinases, which effect robust activation of downstream signaling pathways including
  extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), c–Jun N–terminal Kinase (JNK) and p38.
