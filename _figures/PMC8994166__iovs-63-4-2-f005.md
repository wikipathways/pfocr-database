caption: Putative role of mitochondrial fission in early stages of corneal myofibroblast
  differentiation. TGF-β1 dimerization and ligand binding to its cognate receptor
  TGF-RII recruits TGF-RI into a heteromeric complex, initiating a signal transduction
  cascade that can act through canonical and noncanonical pathways. The canonical
  TGF-β1 signaling pathway requires SMADs, which are directly phosphorylated by TGF-R1,
  transit to the nucleus, and regulate gene transcription (including a pro-fibrotic
  repertoire of targets such as a α-SMA, COL1, and t-FN). In contrast, noncanonical,
  non-SMAD pathways are activated directly by ligand-occupied receptors to modulate
  downstream effectors, such as p38, AKT, ERK and JNK kinases. Our results suggest
  that non-canonical AKT, ERK and JNK signaling pathways can modify DRP1, the central
  mediator of mitochondrial fission, and that TGF-β1 signaling causes a necessary
  fragmentation of the mitochondrial network early in the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast
  transition. Moreover, mitochondrial fission appears to reinforce JNK activation.
  In contrast, p38—although part of the noncanonical TGF-β1 signaling axis—does not
  appear to influence mitochondrial fission. However, it is important to note that
  first, our results do not preclude fission-independent roles for AKT, ERK, and JNK
  in fibrotic decision-making, and second, that neither AKT, ERK, or JNK is absolutely
  required for TGF-β1–mediated fragmentation, suggesting functional redundancy.
