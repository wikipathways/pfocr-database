caption: In diploid yeast induced to undergo meiosis, Spo11 catalyzes double-strand
  breaks (DSBs) throughout the genome, which undergo 5’ to 3’ resection. The resulting
  3’ single stranded tail can invade the homologous chromosome to form a D-loop intermediate.
  In the ZMM-stabilized (Class I) pathway, the single end invasion intermediate (SEI)
  is stabilized by the actions of Msh4-Msh5 and Zip3 to promote D-loop extension through
  DNA repair synthesis. A double Holliday junction (dHJ) is then formed by second
  end capture that is asymmetrically cleaved in an Mlh1-Mlh3-dependent step to yield
  primarily crossover products. Note that in this model branch migration of Holliday
  junctions can occur but is not shown. Noncrossovers and a minority of crossovers
  (class II) are thought to occur through the other pathways shown (reviewed in ;
  ; ). Roles for the Mlh1-Mlh2 complex in limiting gene conversion tract length, and
  Mlh1-Mlh3 in biased resolution of double-Holliday junctions to form crossovers,
  are shown. Mlh1-Pms1 acts to repair DNA mismatches that form in heteroduplex DNA
  in all pathways. The distribution of the types of meiotic recombination events in
  baker’s yeast is approximate and was calculated based on studies showing that Spo11
  catalyzed DSBs produce equal numbers of crossovers and noncrossovers (; ; ). Of
  the crossovers, 85% are estimated to be class I, and 15% class II (; ; ). Of the
  noncrossovers, 15% are estimated to result from the resolution of dHJs in the class
  II pathway (DeMuyt et al., 2012), with the remainder occurring through other mechanisms
  such as synthesis-dependent strand annealing. See text for details and  and  for
  more detailed models.
