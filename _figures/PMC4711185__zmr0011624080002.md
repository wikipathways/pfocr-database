caption: Interacting sensing, signaling, and regulatory pathways important for the
  Vibrio cholerae sessile lifestyle. Diverse environmental cues such as chitin disaccharide
  and oligosaccharides, bile acids (not shown), nitric oxide, norspermidine (not shown),
  spermidine, carbon source depletion, and population size signals (such as the autoinducers
  cholerae autoinducer 1 [CAI-1] and autoinducer 2 [AI-2]) are sensed and processed
  by V. cholerae, which employs signal transduction sensor kinases (such as ChiS,
  VarS, LuxQ, CqsS, CqsR, VpsS, and HnoK) and response regulators (such as LuxO, VarA,
  HnoB, HnoD, TfoX, VpsR, and VpsT); the quorum-sensing master transcriptional regulators
  AphA and HapR; small RNAs (such as CsrB, CsrC, CsrD, Qrr1 to -4, and TfoR); and
  the RNA chaperone Hfq, cAMP, and c-di-GMP for signal relay and response regulation.
  The type IV pili are involved in initial surface attachment. The activated production
  of VPS (Vibrio polysaccharide) (the major component of the V. cholerae biofilm matrix)
  and biofilm matrix proteins contributes to biofilm formation. It is evident that
  most regulatory pathways converge on c-di-GMP, which plays a central role governing
  the microbial switch from the planktonic to the sessile lifestyle. There are some
  other surface- and biofilm-related sensing, signaling, and regulatory pathways,
  such as the CqsR and VpsS QS pathways that are functionally redundant to the CqsA/CqsS
  and LuxS/LuxPQ QS pathways, the chemotactic pathway that senses extracellular chitin
  disaccharide and oligosaccharides and modulates bacterial tactic movement toward
  chitin surfaces for efficient colonization and chitin utilization, the stringent
  response regulatory pathway that maximizes the use of available resources in response
  to various low-nutrient stresses, the nucleoside scavenging-and-signaling pathway
  for regulating natural competence, and the pathways mediated by H-NS and alternative
  sigma factors, which are not shown in order to avoid cluttering. LCD, low cell population
  density; HCD, high cell population density; LuxS, autoinducer-2 synthase; LuxP,
  autoinducer-2 periplasmic binding protein; LuxQ, autoinducer-2 membrane-bound sensor
  histidine kinase; CqsS, CAI-1 membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase; LuxU, autoinducer
  phosphorelay protein; LuxO, LuxU cognate response regulator; CBP, chitin-binding
  protein; NspS, periplasmic spermidine-binding protein; HnoX, NO sensor protein;
  OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane; CsrA, global posttranscriptional regulatory
  protein that activates LuxO via an unidentified regulatory factor (denoted “?”);
  Qrr, quorum regulatory small RNA; Hfq, RNA-binding and chaperone protein; cAMP-CRP,
  cAMP-cAMP receptor protein complex; Fis, factor for inversion stimulation, a small
  nucleoid protein; PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system; CyaA, adenylate
  cyclase that synthesizes cellular cAMP; VCA0939, CdgA, and the GGDEF domain of MbaA,
  diguanylate cyclases that synthesize cellular c-di-GMP; HnoB and the EAL domain
  of MbaA, phosphodiesterases that degrade c-di-GMP; HnoD, protein containing a degenerate
  phosphodiesterase functioning as an HnoB allosteric inhibitor; VpsR and VpsT, transcriptional
  regulators that modulate VPS synthesis, with VpsR also being a regulator of V. cholerae
  biofilm matrix protein synthesis; T2SS, type II secretion system; com, msh, rbm,
  and vps, gene operons for chitin-induced natural competence, type IV pilus production,
  biofilm matrix protein production, and VPS production, respectively. This figure
