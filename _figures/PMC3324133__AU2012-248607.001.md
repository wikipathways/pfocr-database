caption: Insulin receptor (INSR) belongs to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases
  that includes the receptor for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1R). Many tumour
  types have upregulated expression of IGF-1R, INSR, and potentially hybrid INSR/IGF-1Rs
  which facilitate increased activation of mitogenic, prosurvival and protein synthesis
  pathways following activation by of ligands insulin, IGF-1 or IGF-2. IGF-1 can bind
  the INSR with 2.5% the efficiency of insulin. Insulin, at physiological levels,
  will not activate the IGF-1R. Insulin and IGF-1 can activate signalling with varying
  potency through the hybrid INSR/IGF-1R. IGF2 is able to signal through each of the
  INSR, IGF-1R, and hybrid receptor (Hybrid R). Ligand binding to the INSR and IGF-1R
  activate numerous downstream pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt
  and Ras/MAPK pathways with many well-characterised downstream effects including
  increased glucose metabolism, inhibition of apoptosis (e.g., via FOXO and BAD-mediated
  pathways), and stimulation of cell proliferation (e.g., via mammalian target of
  rapamycin; mTOR). Reciprocal feedback regulation occurs in prostate cancer cells
  between the AR signalling and signalling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Unfettered
  activity through this pathway, associated with the common PTEN mutation, inhibits
  AR signalling and suggests a possible pathway to androgen-independent growth of
  prostate tumours. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a potentially bifunctional
  modulator in prostate cancer cells. Activation of AMPK modulates insulin signalling
  by negatively regulating mTOR control of protein synthesis and halting cell proliferation.
  AMPK activation also promotes fatty acid oxidation and downregulates expression
  of SREBP and activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) resulting in decreased fatty
  acid synthesis. However, AMPK has complex regulation in prostate cancer cells and
  may potentiate increased proliferation and migration when activated downstream of
  the AR under the control of AR responsive regulator calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2). AR directly regulates CAMKK2 and upregulates AMPK
  which mediates AR-induced migration and invasion in a CAMKK2-dependent manner. In
  studies where metformin activation of AMPK results in cessation of cancer cell growth,
  signalling is thought to be through LKB-1 tumour suppressor; therefore, competition
  for AMPK signalling via LKB1 stimulation versus AR-mediated CAMKK2 activation could
  result in altered functional outcomes. DHT, dihydrogen testosterone; AR, androgen
  receptor; ARE, androgen response element; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
