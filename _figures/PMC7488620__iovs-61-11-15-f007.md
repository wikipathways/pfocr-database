caption: Parental RHC reverses ischemia-induced changes in rod phototransduction pathway
  proteins. Displayed is the IPA version of the phototransduction canonical pathway
  for Comparison 1 (upper panel) and Comparison 2 (lower panel) (see  for Comparison
  3 for this same canonical). Proteins and their isoforms responsible for generating
  an electrical response to light are arranged anatomically relative to the rod outer
  segment (the section of the photoreceptor containing disks full of the photosensitive
  pigment rhodopsin and other molecules involved in the visual transduction process),
  as well as the channels and molecular mediators of the so-called dark current that
  maintain the rod in a depolarized state in the absence of light. The heat map shows
  the directional FC, by comparison, for each protein in the canonical, ranked by
  expression FC for C1. Note that many of the proteins that are downregulated (green)
  in the ischemic retinae of F1 mice from control parents (Comparison 1) are either
  no longer downregulated or even upregulated (red) in the ischemic retinae of F1
  mice from RHC-treated parents (Comparison 2). A tabulated version of this canonical
  is provided with the fold changes and P values for each protein in the canonical
  and each respective comparison.
