caption: Schematic representation of nitrogen-starvation response and phosphate-starvation
  responses explaining N/P interactions. PHR1 acts as a major transcriptional regulator
  of P-starvation response, which is accompanied by the activation of phosphate starvation-induced
  (PSI) genes followed by phosphate uptake and translocation by phosphate transporters
  (PHO1 and PHT1s). PHR1 is negatively regulated by SPXs through inositol polyphosphate
  (insP)-triggered Pathway. During P-starvation, PHR1 up-regulates the IPS1 and miR399
  expression. miR399 represses PHO2, which acts in association with NLA (an E3 ligase)
  to repress/degrade PHO1 and PHT1. OsSPX4 is degraded through 26S proteasome pathway
  in response to N supply (+N) via the action of OsNRT1.1B and an E3 ligase OsNBIP1
  (NRT1−NBIP). SPXs transcription is directly repressed in response to +N by NIGT1/HHOs.
  On the contrary, PHR is positively regulated by +N. PHO2 expression is down-regulated
  in response to +N by NIGT1/HHOs and CHL1/NRT1.1. Thus, the phosphate-starvation
  response is attenuated by N-starvation because of the accumulation of negative regulators
  (SPXs and PHO2) and a decrease in the positive regulator (PHR1).
