caption: 'The signaling pathways triggered by traditional medicine-derived SCFAs.
  Some decoctions/compounds in traditional Chinese medicines alleviate colitis by
  inducing the production of various SCFAs such as acetate, butyrate, and valerate,
  which target several signaling pathways such as GPRs to trigger the production of
  various barrier-supporting proteins such as the tight junction proteins, mucins,
  and immunomodulatory cytokines such as IL-22, which play a critical role in maintaining
  gut homeostasis. SCFAs also suppress pro-inflammatory pathways such as the TLR-NF-κB
  pathway, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and IL-6 mediated AKT pathway to down-regulate
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8, which
  may influence IBD by regulating the recruitment of multiple immune cells to the
  site of inflammation. SCFAs may promote PPARγ production via the NF-κB pathway,
  then suppress the level of RORγT to control Th17 cell differentiation and interfere
  with inflammation by regulating the balance of Th17/Treg cells. Regulation of the
  AKT/STAT3 signaling pathway through SCFA production is an important mechanism in
  the treatment of colon inflammation by some traditional drugs. Abbreviations: (1)
