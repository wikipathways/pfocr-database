caption: Model for Al-Dependent Stoppage of Root Growth.Based on our results from
  identification of als3-1 suppressors that increase Al tolerance, it is expected
  that Al acts as a genotoxic agent that in an unknown manner activates an ATR- and
  ALT2-dependent cell cycle checkpoint pathway to stop cell division following chronic
  Al exposure. Loss of ALS3 function is predicted to result in increased Al accumulation
  in root tip cells that likely would lead to greater impacts on DNA and consequently
  cause hyperactivation of the ATR- and ALT2-dependent response pathway (red arrows
  within the nucleus). At present, it is not clear what role the WD-40 protein ALT2
  plays in this active process, although it could be argued that ALT2 functions analogously
  to other WD-40 proteins involved in the mammalian DNA damage detection pathways
  of GGNER and TCNER. Regardless, both ATR and ALT2, but not ATM, function to halt
  cell division, trigger  differentiation, and promote endocycling at least in part
  through SOG1. This includes promotion of a transcriptional response to Al that is
  composed of a suite of genes that are related to two distinctly different functions.
  One set, as demonstrated by analyses of loss-of-function mutants for BRCA1 and PARP2,
  encodes products that are responsible for repair of the apparently limited DNA damage
  that occurs following treatment with Al. The other set, while still cryptic with
  regard to its members, represents factors that are responsible for transitioning
  from actively dividing root cells to terminal differentiation and endoreduplication
  following Al treatment. It could be argued that increased Al tolerance occurs following
  mutational loss of these cell cycle checkpoints because the negative consequences
  of cell cycle arrest far outweigh the actual genotoxic consequences of Al.
