caption: Schematic description of FGF15/19-mediated repression of Cyp27 and Cyp7a1
  in cholangiocytes and hepatocytes. In cholangiocytes or enterocytes, activated FXR
  induces expression of FGF15/19, which affects neighboring cholangiocytes and hepatocytes
  through paracrine signaling. FGF15/19 binds to FGFR4, initiating a signaling to
  repress Cyp27 expression in cholangiocytes through p38 kinase or Cyp7a1 expression
  in hepatocytes through JNK
papertitle: FXR-induced secretion of FGF15/19 inhibits CYP27 expression in cholangiocytes
  through p38 kinase pathway.
