caption: Schematic diagram of FAF1 action on the innate-immunity signaling pathway.
  Virus infection recruits the kinases TBK1 and IKKε to adaptor proteins MAVS and
  TRIF. These kinases phosphorylate (p) IRF3, and phosphorylated IRF3 forms dimers
  which translocate into the nucleus via interaction with IPO5 to produce IFN-β. However,
  FAF1 inhibits IFN-β activation and ISG induction by interfering with the IRF3-IPO5
  interaction and represses nuclear translocation of IRF3.
