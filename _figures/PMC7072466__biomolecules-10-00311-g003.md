caption: Expression profiles of key genes that are involved in the characteristic
  metabolite biosynthesis pathways in tea plants. The key genes involved in the caffeine
  biosynthesis pathway (A), theanine biosynthesis pathway (B), and catechin biosynthesis
  pathway (C) were identified, and their expression levels in the trichomes and tea
  leaves are represented by heat maps. The significantly upregulated and downregulated
  transcripts are shown with red and green asterisks, respectively. ASL, adenylosuccinate
