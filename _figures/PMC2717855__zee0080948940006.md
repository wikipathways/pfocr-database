caption: Proposed mechanism for Pio’s PPARγ-independent effects in the β-cell. Pio
  reduces the Δψm, possibly via complex I inhibition in the electron transport chain
  (ETC), thereby reducing the rate of ATP synthesis. Consequent increase in AMP to
  ATP ratio may be the cause of the AMPK activation and increased ADP to ATP ratio
  restrains the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) and therefore the
  triggering Ca2+pathway for GIIS. Reduced glucose oxidation could be the result of
  ETC inhibition coupled to reduced Krebs cycle activity or a consequence of AMPK
  activation [via inhibition of glucokinase translocation to plasma membrane ()] or
  due to the inhibition of PDH by Pio (). Inhibition of glucose oxidation is associated
  with reduced pyruvate cycling and mitochondrial metabolism that generate mitochondria
  (Mito.)-derived signals such as oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (reduced form; NADPH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), instrumental in the amplification
  pathways for GIIS (). AMPK activation and possibly reduced ATP to ADP and ATP to
  AMP ratios inhibit FFA esterification, and AMPK activation inhibits lipolysis (,).
  FFA incorporation into GL and their subsequent lipolysis are parts of the GL/FFA
  cycle that generates lipid signaling molecules such as free fatty acids (FA), long
  chain fatty acyl-CoA (LC-CoA), phosphatidic acid (PA), and DAG involved in the amplification
  pathways for GIIS (). At high glucose the substrate push counteracts the mild metabolic
  inhibition of Pio. It is likely that metformin (Metf) and berberine (BBR) affect
  the β-cell via the same processes stemming from reduced mitochondrial function.
