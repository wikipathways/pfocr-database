caption: The cAMP signalling pathway. Upon ligand binding to Gs‐coupled GPCRs, the
  Gαs protein activates adenylyl cyclases (AC) to catalyse the conversion of ATP to
  cAMP. The GαI protein inhibits AC, resulting in lower cAMP levels. cAMP primarily
  mediates its effects via PKA and/or Epac. PKA phosphorylates CREB which binds to
  CRE sites in the promoter of CREB‐responsive genes. A‐kinase anchoring proteins
  (AKAPs) localize enzymes to their signalling substrates in subcellular locations.
  cAMP is removed via degradation by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) or effluxed out by
  the transporter MRP4/ABCC4. Regulators of G protein signalling (RGS) proteins accelerate
  the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP of heterotrimeric G proteins and thus help terminate
  G protein activation. Numerous RGS proteins have been identified (O'Brien, Wilkinson,
  & Roman, ). The figure hypothesizes an as‐yet not definitively identified RGS protein
  for Gαs. Multiple transcription factors, including IRF4, are downstream of and regulated
  by the cAMP pathway
