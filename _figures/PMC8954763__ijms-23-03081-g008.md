caption: (A) A hypothetical framework (based on pilot data presented here) highlights
  four key immune processes which are possibly dysregulated. 1; higher expression
  of the NFAT pathway results in impaired antigen presentation capacity, through lowered
  CIITA and MHCII gene expression. 2; impaired Th1 differentiation which may lead
  to diminished IFNγ release, which normally controls macrophage subtype 1 (M1) migration
  and M2 activation which guide muscle tissue repair []. 3; diminished follicular
  helper T (Tfh) cell differentiation resulting in altered B memory cell expansion
  and altered plasma B cell expansion which may result in less antibody synthesis
  []. 4; Th2 expansion coupled with lowered IL4 expression with increased DM1 severity.
  Together these affected pathways may result in dysregulated immunity resulting in
  a more severe DM1 phenotype. (B) Schematic representation of the concept that increased
  DM1 severity is associated with accelerated cellular aging, muscle-wasting, and
  dysregulation of immunity.
