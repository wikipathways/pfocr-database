caption: 'The pathogenesis of DN is complex, and the possible mechanisms can be divided
  into oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions, etc. The possible mechanisms of GV
  causing CAN, DPN, and cognitive impairment are as follows: a GV increased ROS, which
  activated the NRLP3 inflammasome and inhibited autonomic ganglion synaptic transmission,
  thereby leading to CAN; b GV induces oxidative stress and inflammatory response
  by activating the NF-kB pathway or PKC, thereby causing DPN; c GV causes cognitive
  impairment by inhibiting Akt/GSK3β pathway to hyperphosphorylate Tau protein. GV
  glycemic variability, ROS reactive oxygen species, CAN cardiovascular autonomic
  neuropathy, DPN diabetic peripheral neuropathy.'
