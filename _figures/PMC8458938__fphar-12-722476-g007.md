caption: Schematic diagram illustrating possible interaction of BCP and METH in the
  mesolimbic DA system. METH promotes DA release from presynaptic DA terminals in
  the NAc and other projection regions via the membrane DA transporter (DAT) and intracellular
  type 2 vesicular monoamine transports (VMAT2, not shown). BCP binds to CB2 receptors
  on DA neurons and inhibits DA neuron activity by activation of M-type K+ channel
  via a Gi/o-cAMP-PKA signal pathway (; ), which subsequently attenuates NAc DA response
  to METH and DA-dependent addiction-related behavior. In addition, BCP may also bind
  to other non-CB2 receptors such as PPARα/β, which indirectly modulates DA neuron
  activity.
