caption: Vector Genome PAMP CpG Content Determines the Fate of rAAV-Transduced Hepatocytes(A)
  After systemic administration, AAV vectors containing DNA with high PAMP CpG content
  (a, red genome) transduce hepatocytes, leading to expression of the therapeutic
  (tx) protein but also cell surface presentation of capsid-derived peptides (red
  triangles) by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 molecules (b). A fraction
  of the vector dose enters proximal lymph nodes and is taken up by plasmacytoid dendritic
  cells (pDCs) (c), where vector DNA is processed in the lysosome and activates the
  TLR9-MyD88 pathway, and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) (d), where vector capsid-derived
  peptides (red ovals) are presented by MHC class 2 molecules, recruiting capsid-specific
  CD4+ T cell help. These events lead to licensing and maturation of cDCs and activation
  of capsid-specific CD8+ CTLs (e) that proliferate, migrate to the liver, and eliminate
  transduced hepatocytes (f). (B) AAV vectors containing DNA with low PAMP CpG content
  (g, green genome) similarly transduce hepatocytes but do not activate the TLR9-MyD88
  pathway. CTLs are not formed, transduced hepatocytes are not eliminated, and cell-surface
  capsid peptide presentation wanes (h). In both cases AAV vectors activate the humoral
  arm of the immune response (i), leading to capsid antibodies.
