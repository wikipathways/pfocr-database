caption: Visualization of a protein interaction network identified by Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis as being altered by adolescent brain development (p-score = 22). Proteins
  shown in red were up-regulated in the adult mPFC, proteins in green were up-regulated
  in the adolescent mPFC, and proteins in yellow indicate statistically significant
  interaction proteins identified by IPA network analysis. Solid lines indicate a
  direct interaction, and dashed lines indicate an indirect interaction mediated by
  additional, non-significant proteins. Asterisks denote proteins that were identified
  multiple times in the proteomic analysis that have been consolidated into a single
  point in the functional network. Focus molecule cofilin-1 (CFL1) is indicated in
  bold.
