caption: Resveratrol inhibits PDE activity and induces cAMP signaling via Epac1, which
  activates PLCε, resulting in Ca2+ release via the Ryr2 Ca2+ channel and, ultimately,
  the activation of the CamKKβ-AMPK pathway. CR increases cAMP levels by increasing
  glucagon and catecholamine levels, which activate AC activity and cAMP production.
  AMPK increases mitochondrial biogenesis and function by increasing PGC-1α expression,
  NAD+ levels, and Sirt1 activity. An additional pathway that may contribute to resveratrol
  action is indicated with dotted lines.
