caption: 'PMA affected pathways through IL2 are: Calcineurin-regulated NFAT-dependent
  transcription in lymphocytes, IL27-mediated signaling events, IL12-mediated signaling
  events, IL23-mediated signaling events, Glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network,
  IL2-mediated signaling events, IL2 signaling events mediated by PI3K, Calcium signaling
  in the CD4+ TCR pathway, Regulation of Telomerase, IL12 signaling mediated by STAT4,
  Downstream signaling in naïve CD8+ T cells and IL2 signaling events mediated by
  STAT5; PMA affected pathways through IGHE are: IL4-mediated signaling events and
  Fc-epsilon receptor I signaling in mast cells; PMA affected pathways through CEBPA
  are: E2F transcription factor network, Regulation of retinoblastoma protein, regulation
  of Androgen receptor activity, FOXA2 and FOXA3 transcription factor networks and
  C-MYB transcription factor network; PMA affected pathway through TPM3 is Muscle
  contraction.'
