caption: 'In E. coli, the salvage pathway (red) utilizes either guanosine (GUO), guanine
  (GUA), inosine (INO) and hypoxanthine (HPX) as substrates. Guanosine kinase (Gsk)
  converts nucleosides GUO and INO to GMP and IMP, respectively. The de novo pathway
  uses phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) as a starting compound for the multi-step
  synthesis of inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP), which is further converted to GTP.
  The transformation is achieved in four steps: IMP is first converted into xanthosine
  monophosphate (XMP) by the IMP dehydrogenase GuaB, and the GMP synthase GuaA then
  converts XMP into guanosine monophosphate (GMP). GMP is transformed into the final
  product, GTP, via sequential rounds of phosphorylation: the GMP kinase Gmk catalyzes
  the conversion of GMP into guanosine diphosphate (GDP), which is then converted
  to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by the nucleoside diphosphate kinase Ndk. Cellular
  GTP concentrations have dual effect on bacterial physiology. Until a certain threshold
  concentration, increasing the GTP level increases the growth rate. However, further
  increase leads to cytotoxic effects, and at high concentrations GTP inhibits growth,
  negatively affecting bacterial survival upon amino acid starvation. The specific
  targets of (p)ppGpp-mediated control vary according to species and differ in E.
  coli, _, B. subtilis and E. faecalis. In E. coli, (p)ppGpp inhibits the IMP dehydrogenase
  GuaB; in B. subtilis and E. faecalis (p)ppGpp inhibits hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
  (HprT, the enzyme that catalyzes both conversion of HPX to IMP and of GUA to GMP);
  in B. subtilis (p)ppGpp inhibits the GMP kinase Gmk.'
