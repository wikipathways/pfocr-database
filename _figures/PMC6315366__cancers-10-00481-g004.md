caption: Autophagy, Keap1 and p62 regulate Nrf2 in HCC. (A) Domain structure of p62/Sqstm1.
  The domains of p62 and their interacting partners. (B) Under normal physiology,
  Nrf2 is held by Keap1 and directs Nrf2 for proteasomal degradation. During deregulated
  autophagy, augmentation of p62 occurs through phosphorylation of p62. Upon phosphorylation,
  p62 sequesters Keap1 and disengages Nrf2 from Keap1, leading to the activation of
  the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway, which results in antioxidant defence, survival and metabolic
  reprogramming in HCC.
