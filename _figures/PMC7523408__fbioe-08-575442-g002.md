caption: Relationship between lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, inflammation, and
  insulin resistance. Lipid metabolism and energy metabolism disorder lead to inflammation
  and affect each other. These all contribute to insulin resistance. The underlying
  mechanisms include diacylglycerol (DAG), activate protein kinase C (PKC) and lipid
  accumulation, trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, and result in
  insulin signaling inhibition; UPR affects hepatokine secretion to induce insulin
  resistance; inflammatory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin
  6 (IL6), and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1) activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) and IκB kinase (IKK), which in turn impair insulin signaling; energy homeostasis
  disorder impairs β-cell functions, reduces PI3K signaling, and enhances gluconeogenic
  enzyme expressions, resulting in insulin resistance.
