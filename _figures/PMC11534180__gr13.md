caption: PPI subnetwork of DEGs from HC and EC tissue. Nodes represent genes. Edges
  represent the interactions between genes from the String database. The network shows
  a largest subnetwork. The color ring of each node highlighted the enrichment analysis
  of cellular component and key pathways including Oxidative phosphorylation and AD
  pathway
