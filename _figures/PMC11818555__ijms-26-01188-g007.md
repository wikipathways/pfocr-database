caption: 'DHEAS metabolic pathway and signaling. Cells were incubated with increasing
  concentrations of DHEAS and incubated over 24–72 h (see Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure
  5 and Figure 6). Steroid concentrations were determined in cell lysates and cell
  culture media for the DHEAS metabolites indicated. Whereas DHEAS and DHEA were detected
  in cell lysates and media from all cell lines, T, DHT, and E2 were only detected
  in the cell culture media of some of the cell lines and, thus, represent a cell-type-specific
  metabolic phenotype. The steroids T and DHT are potent activators of the AR, while
  E2 is an agonist of the ER. Black arrow: carrier-mediated uptake of DHEAS; red dotted
  arrows: passive diffusion of the lipophilic steroids DHEA, A4, T, DHT, and E2. Figure
