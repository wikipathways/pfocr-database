caption: Experimental evidence supporting the “proline-P5C Cycle” (Hagedorn and Phang
  ). Using preparations of isolated rat liver mitochondria and dialyzed supernatants
  of sonicated human erythrocytes, we incubated [1-3H] glucose and monitored the production
  of [3H]-proline. Unlabeled proline, NADP+, ATP and rotenone were included. If the
  amount of triated proline produced in the complete incubation system is defined
  as 1.000, the following were obtained when a specific reactant was omitted. Minus
  rotenone, 0 0.055; minus proline, 0.009; minus NADP+, 0.003; minus mitochondria,
  0.011; minus erythrocyte extract, 0.003. Tracing the tritium from [1-3H]-glucose,
  it is transferred to NADP+ to P5C produced from unlabeled proline to yield tritiated
  proline. No tritiated proline is formed ini the absence of NADP+ or unlabeled proline.
  In another study added P5C markedly increased the activity of the oxidative pentose
  phosphate pathway as well as the levels of R-5-P and PRPP. (Yeh et al. ) In a separate
  publication, we showed that in red cells with G6PD deficiency, the P5C-mediated
  increases in R-5-P and PRPP were mitigated. (Yeh et al. ) PRPP is used in the salvage
  pathways for both purine and pyridine nucleotides
