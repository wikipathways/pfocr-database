caption: A schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of action of BTZ on
  DprE1 inhibition and decaprenyl phosphate recycling. DPA synthesis is crucial for
  biosynthesis of arabinan components of LAM and AG and begins with transfer of ribose
  phosphate from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (pRPP) to decaprenyl phosphate and follows
  the pathway where DprE1/E2 generates DPA from DPR. Treatment with BTZ043 (star)
  results in accumulation of DPR (highlighted in a broken circle) stalling LAM and
  AG biosynthesis and a block in decaprenyl phosphate recycling. Overexpression of
  UppS, the prenyl synthase (highlighted in a broken circle) causes restoration of
  the recycling pathway by supplementing enough decaprenyl phosphate for synthesis
  of cell wall components.
