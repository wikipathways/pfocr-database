caption: A simplified model of Rac1 signaling and function in learning-induced adult
  neurogenesis. Loss of Rac1 function in the mature neurons of the granule cell layer
  changes synaptic plasticity and impairs activity-induced transcriptional changes
  such as the upregulation of Gadd45b and BDNF. These transient changes in the mature
  neurons lead to long-lasting modifications of adult neurogenesis. Neuronal activation
  of mature dentate granule cells induces Rac1 activity through the NMDA receptor
  and the TrkB receptor. Rac1 triggers activation of multiple downstream pathways
  including (1) the mitogen activate protein MAPK pathway, which induces expression
  of TGF-β1 and BDNF via c-Jun and CREB, respectively and (2) the STAT/NFκB-Gadd45b
  pathway (; ) leading to BDNF expression (). Loss of Rac1 in mature neurons lowers
  learning-induced increases of Gadd45b and BDNF expression, but increases TGF-β1
  expression. The secreted extrinsic factors from mature neurons in turn regulate
  several key aspects of adult neurogenesis over the long term. BDNF is known to promote
  proliferation, whereas TGF-β1 is known to upregulate p27 Kip1, which would lead
  to increased cell cycle exit within the NPC and reduce overall NPC proliferation
  (). NMDA receptor, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor; TrkB, tropomyosin-related kinase
  B; MAPK, mitogen activate protein kinase family; CREB, cAMP response element-binding
  protein, Gadd45b, growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible beta; p27 Kip1, cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor p27; NFκB, nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells.

  description: A simplified model of Rac1 signaling and function in learning-induced

    Neuronal activation of mature dentate granule cells induces Rac1 activity through
