caption: The region containing the HCC susceptibility locus rs73613962 inside the
  intronic region of PRMT7 is identified as an enhancer that can regulate PRMT7 expression
  through the interaction with its promoter. Transcription factor HNF4A prefers to
  bind to the risk allele G over the non-risk allele T, which leads to the upregulated
  expression of PRMT7. Under this condition, the H4R3me2s modification on the promoter
  region of the genes in the p53 signaling pathway is elevated; thereby, the RNA and
  protein level is reduced. As a result, cells are induced to have enhanced malignant
  phenotypes, with higher proliferation rate and migration and invasion abilities.
