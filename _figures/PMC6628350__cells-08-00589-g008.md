caption: Liraglutide attenuates diabetes-associated neointima formation and pathogenic
  EndMT via the AMPK pathway. (a) The proposed underlying mechanisms of the therapeutic
  effects of liraglutide on the attenuation of a diabetes-associated vascular injury.
  Upon diabetic conditions such as hyperglycaemia in combination with pro-inflammatory
  stimulation by IL-1β, endothelial cells undergo the pathogenic EndMT process with
  increased mesenchymal marker expression (vimentin and SM22α). Liraglutide, a GLP-1
  agonist, activates downstream AMPK signaling via GLP-1R and attenuates diabetic
  insult-induced EndMT in endothelial cells. (b) In vivo, endothelium-derived smooth
  muscle-like cells contribute to the progression of neointima formation after a wire-induced
  carotid artery injury. Reduced neointima formation in diabetic mice upon liraglutide
  treatment may be partially attributed to the reduced EndMT process.
