caption: Cyclization step of oxidosqualene in yeasts, mammals, and plants. Recently,
  lanosterol synthase genes were identified from several plants, Arabidopsis thaliana,
  Panax ginseng, and Lotus japonica (–). However, no clear data confirm the existence
  of that biosynthetic pathway of phytosterol via lanosterol in the plant kingdom.
  CAS, cycloartenol synthase; LAS, lanosterol synthase.
