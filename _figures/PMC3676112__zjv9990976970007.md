caption: Translation regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway and translation process.
  (A) Representation of the mTOR signaling KEGG pathway, significantly associated
  with translationally regulated genes. The translationally upregulated genes are
  shown in red and the translationally downregulated genes in green. The direction
  of transcriptional regulation (P < 0.05, fold change > 2) is indicated by arrows
  beside the gene names. (B) Representation of the network of interactions between
  the translationally regulated proteins related to translation (obtained with Cytoscape
  and the MiMI plugin). As for the KEGG pathway, the translationally upregulated genes
  are shown in red and the translationally downregulated genes in green, and potential
  transcriptional regulations are indicated by arrows beside the circles.
