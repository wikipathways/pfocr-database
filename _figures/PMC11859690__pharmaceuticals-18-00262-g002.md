caption: Mechanism of action of anti-HER2 drugs. The HER family includes HER1, HER2,
  HER3 and HER4, among which HER2 overexpression is the most common in breast cancer
  patients. HER is a typical cell membrane receptor tyrosine kinase, and due to HER2
  overexpression, heterodimerization of this receptor with other members of the EGFR
  family leads to autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic
  domain of heterodimeric and initiation of Akt, MAPK, and various other signaling
  pathways leading to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [24]. As early as the 90s
  of the last century, the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has achieved
  good clinical efficacy [25], and then the new monoclonal antibody Pertuzumab inhibits
  the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways by inhibiting HER2 dimerization and inhibiting
  the growth and development of tumor cells [26]. With the development of antibody-drug
  conjugates, HER2 antibody conjugates T-DM1 and T-DXd have also achieved good efficacy,
  both of which enhance the killing effect on tumor cells by attaching small molecule
  toxin drugs to HER2 monoclonal antibodies and then transporting the toxin drug into
  the cell [27,28]. Lapatinib, pyrotinib, and tucatinib, as TKIs, can also inhibit
  tumor development by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway [29,30]
