caption: 'Schematic illustration of the molecular interactions and signaling pathways
  involved in the association between TSC and renal cell carcinoma development (by
  Figdraw). In a mouse model with heterozygous deletion of TSC2 and spontaneous inactivation
  of the second allele, some cystadenomas developed into eosinophilic high-grade RCC
  as the mice aged. TSC2 gene deletion is a potential risk factor for the development
  of renal cystic lesions and renal cell carcinomas, especially in elderly patients.
  Activation of mTORC1 triggered by TSC2 deletion increases the activity of TFE3 and
  TFEB. At the molecular level, mTOR and TFE3/TFEB may be located in a mutually driven
  feed-forward signaling loop. In addition, GPNMB was highly expressed in TSC2-deficient
  mouse renal tumors and human renal cell lines, and GPNMB expression was regulated
  by mTOR kinase and TFEB/TFE3 in vitro. These findings provide new ideas for the
  diagnosis, typing and treatment of TSC1/2/mTOR-associated renal tumors. TSC1/2:
  Tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2; RCC: renal cell carcinoma; mTORC1: Mechanistic target
  of rapamycin complex 1; TFE3: Transcription Factor E3; TFEB: Transcription Factor
  EB; GPNMB: Glycoprotein nonmetastatic B'
