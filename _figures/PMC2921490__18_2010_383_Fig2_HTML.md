caption: Common signaling pathways in inflammation and cancer including those regulating
  ARE-gene expression and mRNA stability. Microbial stimuli, inflammatory and tumor
  inducers, and ARE-gene products themselves such as certain growth factors and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines trigger a number of signaling pathways. One of those  is the p38 MAPK
  pathway that leads to phosphorylation and inactivation of the activity of the RNA
  decay-promoting proteins such as TTP and KSRP. This results in stabilization of
  ARE-mRNAs that are involved in chronic inflammation and cancer. The RNA-binding
  stabilizing protein, HuR, is able to compete with the RNA-binding proteins such
  as TTP and AUF1  for the same mRNA targets; however, it can also act independently
  on mRNA targets  for promoting mRNA stabilization
