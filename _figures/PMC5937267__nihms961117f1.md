caption: Finally, expression of T-cell co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors
  can be modulated by hypoxia as well. In mice challenged with tumors, intratumoral
  hypoxia increased expression of the co-stimulatory receptor CD137 at the surface
  of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in an HIF-1-dependent manner. The ligation of
  CD137 by agonistic antibodies increased CD8+ T-cell activity based on in vitro increases
  in production of IFN-γ and TNF-α by CD137+ CD8+ T cells, and on decreased tumor
  growth in vivo. The beneficial effects of CD137 upregulation on tumor progression
  were found to be tumor specific; however, as some tumors, such as spontaneous breast
  carcinoma, were resistant to anti-CD137 immunotherapy. Moreover, antigenic stimulation
  of T cells was necessary for optimal upregulation of CD137 by hypoxia, implying
  that only in tumors that were already productively infiltrated by antigen-specific
  T cells could this benefit tumor immunity. Hypoxia, via a HIF-1a-dependent mechanism,
  has also been recently shown to induce PD-L1 expression on both tumors cells and
  myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)., Increasing the capacity of tumors and
  their surrounding stroma expressing PD-L1 to repress T cells via engagement of PD-1
  constitutes an additional pathway of T-cell suppression promoted by hypoxia ().
