caption: Opportunities for targeting OATP/Oatp isoforms to optimize CNS drug delivery.
  Results from our recent studies demonstrate that targeting Oatp transporters during
  pathophysiological stress can modify CNS drug delivery. Oatp1a4 facilitates brain
  delivery of drugs that may exhibit efficacy in treatment of peripheral inflammatory
  pain or cerebral hypoxia, such as statins and opioid peptide analgesics. The TGF-β
  signaling pathway enables control of Oatp isoforms by targeting TGF-β receptors
  (i.e., ALK5) with small-molecule therapeutics such as SB431542. Additionally, nuclear
  receptors (e.g., PXR, CAR) offer another potential opportunity to control Oatp-mediated
  drug delivery by the use of a small-molecule therapeutic such as dexamethasone or
  acetaminophen. In this scenario, a PXR or CAR ligand binds to the nuclear receptor
  in the cytoplasm, triggers movement of the nuclear receptor–ligand complex to the
  nucleus, and thereby increases Oatp expression by enhancing transcription of an
  Slco gene. Although P-gp is also a critical determinant of CNS drug delivery, caution
  must be exercised when targeting this transporter to enable greater uptake of therapeutic
  agents into brain parenchyma. This warning arises from evidence obtained from several
  laboratories, including our own, that has shown that enhanced brain delivery of
  drugs can lead to CNS toxicity and unexpected adverse drug reactions.
