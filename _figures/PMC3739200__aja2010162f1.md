caption: The activated TrkB receptor and the VEGF receptor recruit several specific
  small cytoplasmic signalling G proteins, including SHC, GRB2 and the Ras/Rho family;
  they are also involved in pathways regulated by MAPK, PI3K and ERK, evoking cellular
  responses that govern proliferation, migration and other processes. JAK activation
  occurs at cytokine-mediated receptors and subsequently results in the phosphorylation
  of STATs. To date, we have no evidence that BDNF and VEGF activate the JAK/STAT
  pathway by direct binding. Arrows indicate activation; T-shaped arrows indicate
  inhibition. Akt, serine/threonine protein kinase; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor; Cks, cytokines; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; DAG, diacylglycerol;
