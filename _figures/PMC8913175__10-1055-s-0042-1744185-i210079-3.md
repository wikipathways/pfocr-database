caption: 'Mechanism of CIC induced Thrombosis: The viral particles enter the host
  through ACE-2 receptors found on endothelial cells (EC) of respiratory pathway resulting
  in endothelial activation and dysfunction that leads to pyroptosis and cytokine
  storm. This in turn causes platelet activation and upregulation of tissue factor
  (TF) and fragment (1 + 2). The spiked inflammatory response along with downregulation
  of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic pathway leads to formation of thrombus.'
