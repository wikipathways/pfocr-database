caption: A network produced by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of spontaneous mouse hepatocellular
  carcinoma illustrating the interactome of fetal oncogenes, protooncogenes, and cell
  cycle mediators that are expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (red, upregulation
  of gene expression; green, downregulation). CMYC was upregulated by quantitative
  reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction but was not represented on the microarray.
