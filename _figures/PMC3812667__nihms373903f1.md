caption: Bcl-2 inhibition may act directly on tumor cells but may also target the
  nutrient supply to the tumor by disrupting the blood vessels that form around, and
  within, the tumor (). The effect of Bcl-2 on endothelial cells and angiogenic events
  is one that is becoming more recognized in recent years. Angiogenesis is the growth
  of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature and is an absolute requirement
  for tumor survival and expansion (). Over ten years ago Bcl-2 was shown to be upregulated
  in endothelial cells exposed to VEGF and that upregulation of Bcl-2 in these cells
  was sufficient to enhance tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth (; ). More recently,
  it was demonstrated that Bcl-2 functions as a pro-angiogenic signaling molecule
  in endothelial cells through a pathway that involves activation of the canonical
  NF-kB pathways resulting in upregulation of the angiogenic chemokines CXCL1 and
  CXCL8 (). Notably, Bcl-2 also activates the STAT3 signaling pathway in endothelial
  cells resulting in upregulation of VEGF secretion and induction of Bcl-2 expression
  in tumor cells via VEGFR1 (). Of the Bcl-2 family, Bfl-1/A1 has also demonstrated
  importance as a mediator for endothelial protection. However, this appears to be
  transient and related to inflammatory response rather than tumor angiogenesis (;
  ).
