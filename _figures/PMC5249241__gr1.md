caption: (A) The biosynthetic pathway to the first committed DHC (phloretin), flavonoid
  (naringenin), and stilbenoid (resveratrol) from phenylalanine and malonyl-CoA is
  shown. (B) Depicted are proposed biosynthetic routes to several hydroxylated, glycosylated,
  and methylated DHC derivatives. CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CPR, cytochrome P450 reductase; CYP, cytochrome P450; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  DBR, double bond reductase; OMT, O-methyltransferase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; STS, stilbene synthase; UGT, UDP-dependent-glycosyltransferase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase.
