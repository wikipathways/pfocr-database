caption: 'Model of d-xylose sensing and signaling in S. cerevisiae compared to known
  d-glucose signaling events. d-Xylose may be sensed by Snf3p, but not by Rgt2p or
  Gpr1p. d-Xylose metabolism has been shown to result in a decreased glycolytic flux
  when compared to d-glucose [,], which in turn will affect the concentration and
  signaling strength of the glycolytic intermediates G6P (glucose-6-phosphate), F6P
  (fructose-6-phosphate) and F1,6bP (fructose-1,6-bis-phosphate). Hxk2p is phosphorylated
  in two different positions depending on the origin of the signal: phosphorylated
  in Ser15 by SNF1, and autophosphorylated in Ser158, triggered by absence of d-glucose
  and presence of d-xylose, respectively []. Dashed purple arrows: d-xylose signaling;
  dashed orange arrows: d-glucose signaling; black dashed arrows: downstream signaling
  events (irrespective of sugar stimulus); arrows with arrowheads: induction or activation;
  arrows with hammerheads: repression or deactivation; solid arrows: metabolic or
  transport reactions; circles with P: phosphorylations (the color of the circle indicate
  which signaling pathway controls the phosphorylation); purple pentagons: d-xylose;
  yellow hexagons: d-glucose. Green shapes: Snf3p/Rgt2p pathway; blue shapes: cAMP/PKA
  pathway; orange shapes: cAMP/PKA pathway. Partially adapted from [].'
