caption: 'Lifestyles of intracellular bacterial pathogens. () F. tularensis escapes
  a late endosome (LE)-like vacuole in a T6SS-dependent manner. Following replication
  in the cytosol, F. tularensis may retranslocate to a membrane-bound compartment
  resembling an autolysosome. () L. monocytogenes escapes the phagolysosomal pathway
  using the T2SS (Sec) effectors LLO and PLCs. L. monocytogenes replicates rapidly
  in the cytosol and hijacks the host actin polymerization machinery to move within
  and between cells. () B. pseudomallei escapes into the cytosol in a T3SS-dependent
  manner. B. pseudomallei performs actin-based motility and promotes host cell fusion.
  () C. burnetii is adapted to the phagolysosomal pathway and resides in a spacious
  phagolysosomal-like compartment. The Dot/Icm system (T4SS) is required for recruiting
  the autophagosomal marker LC3 and for vacuole biogenesis. () M. tuberculosis arrests
  phagosome maturation at the early endosome (EE) stage in a T7SS-dependent manner.
  () L. pneumophila and B. abortus segregate from the endocytic route at the EE stage,
  recruit endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles, and form ribosome-studded specialized
  vacuoles in a T4SS-dependent manner. () C. pneumoniae segregates from the endocytic
  route and form a unique inclusion vacuole by recruiting Golgi-derived vesicles.
  C. pneumoniae effectors promote Golgi fragmentation and generate actin filaments
  around the inclusion. Chlamydia is found in two different forms: the non-replicating
  infectious elementary body (EB) and the intracytoplasmic replicative reticulate
  body (RB). T2SS and T3SS effectors are thought to be involved in the intracellular
  life cycle of Chlamydia. () S. enterica replicates in a late endosome (LE)-like
  compartment that excludes lysosomal degradation enzymes. The S. enterica containing
  vacuole migrates to the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC) and forms Salmonella-induced
  filaments (Sif) along microtubules in a T3SS-dependent manner.'
