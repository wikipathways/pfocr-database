caption: Genes subject to Tet1 regulation in human bronchial epithelial cells and/or
  EpCAM+ murine lung epithelial cells are shown in blue (downregulated) and red (upregulated).
  Upon ligand binding, components of PM2.5 activate the Aryl-hydrocarbon receptor
  signaling pathway and promote CYP and antioxidant genes with xenobiotic-responsive
  elements in their promoters, including Phase I (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, etc.) and Phase
  II enzymes (NQO1, GSTA2, UGT1A1, and UGT1A6). To limit oxidative stress (e.g., ROS),
  the Nrf2-mediated pathway is activated to upregulate target genes (Phase II detoxification
  enzymes such as GSTs, including enzymes downstream of AhR that also contain antioxidant-responsive
  elements). Activation of Nrf2 also results in the expression of cytokines (e.g.,
  IL-8) to promote neutrophil infiltration and Th17 responses. Excessive ROS results
  in the accumulation of misfolded proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which
  activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) that reduces protein translation and
  increases protein folding (IRE1-XBP1-ER chaperones). Failure to remove misfolded
  proteins results in apoptosis. This UPR may also activate NF-κB mediated inflammatory
  responses.
