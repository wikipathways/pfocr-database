caption: 'Biological Expression Language framework network of biological molecules
  that are causally linked to the T2DM molecular phenotype. Node color indicates molecule
  type and/or molecular process. Red links indicate molecular interactions, while
  gray links indicate process-molecule causal relationships. The network was constructed
  by extracting all nodes in the BEL knowledgebase containing the terms “insulin secretion,”
  “insulin receptor signaling,” “glucose transport,” “glucose import,” or “glucose
  homeostasis,” and extending to the first degree neighbors of these seed nodes. The
  result is a network containing both molecular nodes (e.g., PRKCZ) and biological
  process nodes (e.g., liver glucose import), as well as the causal relationships
  between them. Some molecular nodes in the network additionally contain a dynamic
  property, indicated in the node color. For instance, cell secretion (as indicated
  in red) of “CHEBI: Insulin” increases “GO: glucose transport.” Similarly, transcriptional
  activity (purple) of “HGNC: PPARG” increases “GO: Insulin receptor signaling pathway.”
  Abbreviations in the network nodes are as follows: CHEBI, Chemicals of Biological
  Interest names (); EGID, Entrez Gene IDs (); GO, Gene Ontology names (); HGNC, Human
  Genome Nomenclature Committee (); MESHD, Medical Subject Heading Disease names ();
  MESHCL, Medical Subject Heading Cellular Structure (); MGI, Mouse Genome Information
  gene symbols (); NCH, Human Molecular Complex names (); PFH, Human Protein Family
  names (); PFM, Mouse Protein Family names (); RGD, Rat Genome Database gene symbols
  (); SPAC, SwissProt accession numbers ().'
