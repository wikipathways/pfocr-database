caption: The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is regulated by Ras (indicated in green ovals),
  as well as various upstream growth factor receptors (indicated in purple) and non-receptor
  kinases. Sites where various small molecule inhibitors suppress this pathway are
  indicated by red octagons. The downstream transcription factors regulated by this
  pathway are indicated in purple diamond shaped outlines. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway
  also interacts with key proteins involved in protein translation (indicated in green
  ovals). The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway aids in the assembly of the protein translation
  complex responsible for the translation of “weak” mRNAs (indicated in a red line
  folding over on itself) important in the prevention of apoptosis. This drawing depicts
  a relative common, yet frequently overlooked phenomenon in human cancer, autocrine
  transformation. GF = growth factor, GFR = growth factor receptor.
