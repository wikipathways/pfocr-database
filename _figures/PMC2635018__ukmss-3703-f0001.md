caption: IIS has a key role in the normal development and physiology of multicellular
  organisms. Downstream of the insulin receptor (InR) or IGF receptor, the major human
  suppressor gene PTEN antagonises the effects of PI3-kinase on phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) to reduce the activity of the serine threonine kinase,
  Akt (pathway shown in blue). Akt regulates TOR kinase, which itself can feed back
  to negatively regulate Akt activity (pathway shown in pink). Cellular sensitivity
  to IIS is controlled by local nutrient sensing mechanisms acting on TOR that appear
  to involve a range of amino acid transporters (AATs), such as the proton-assisted
  amino acid transporters (PATs) and the CD98 family of heterodimeric amino acid transporters.
  Effective drugging of this pathway may have important therapeutic benefits in diseases
  such as cancer, Type 2 diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders.
