caption: Proposed model for the role of HDs in cellular tension regulation. Contractile
  forces generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton can prestress IFs, which can counterbalance
  a further increase in force generation. Binding of the prestressed IFs to β4 in
  HDs and F-actin–anchored FAs is mediated by plectin (situation on the left). When
  the HD constraint on actomyosin generated force is eliminated, force transduction
  across integrins will increase and FAs can further grow and reorganize into larger
  and more complex structures (situation on the right). Upon increased cellular tension,
  more FAK can be phosphorylated and subsequently trigger the activation of the PI3K–YAP
  signaling pathway.
