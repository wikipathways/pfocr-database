caption: 'Overlay of proteomic and metabolomic analysis for two metabolic pathways:
  (A) arginine biosynthesis, and (B) CTP biosynthesis. Proteins and metabolites identified
  by proteomics and metabolomics experiments which displayed a fold change greater
  than 1.5 between cultures are highlighted in color; red indicates a greater concentration
  in the I. hospitalis-only culture, while blue indicates a greater concentration
  in the I. hospitalis-N. equitans co-culture.'
