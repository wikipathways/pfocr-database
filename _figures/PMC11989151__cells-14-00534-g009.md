caption: The canonical MC1R signaling pathway. The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R),
  a G-protein-coupled receptor, plays a crucial role in regulating melanogenesis in
  human skin. Upon binding to its ligands, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)
  or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), MC1R activates two primary downstream signaling
  pathways. The cAMP-dependent pathway (left) involves the phosphorylation and activation
  of CREB and PGC1α. The latter is a coactivator of PPAR-γ. The activation of the
  canonical MC1R signaling pathway transcriptionally regulates the genes involved
  in melanogenesis, including TYR, TRP1, TRP2, PMEL, and MITF. Moreover, MC1R activates
  the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (right), which leads to phosphorylation of PPAR-γ
  by ERK (specifically, ERK2) and the following decrease in the expression of PPAR-γ-dependent
  genes. It also promotes cell cycle progression from the G0 to G1 phase. In addition,
  the MC1R signaling pathway promotes the terminal differentiation of melanocytes.
  The coordinated activation of these pathways enables MC1R to regulate melanin production
  and cell proliferation in melanocytes. In contrast, agonists of PPAR-γ prevent the
  transition of cells from the G1 to GS phase, causing a cell cycle arrest
