caption: 'Interplay between mtROS, ER stress, and Nrf2 signaling pathways to promote
  cardiometabolic health. Recent studies have demonstrated that ROS, in particular
  mtROS, play an important role in mediating signaling to the nucleus to activate
  adaptive/prosurvival pathways in the cell. In this review, we focused on the role
  of mtROS in inducing the Nrf2 signaling pathway and the interplay between mitochondrial
  stress and ER stress to activate the UPR and particularly the PERK arm of the UPR,
  which forms a nexus between the integrated stress response effector ATF4 and Nrf2
  signaling. Activation of these different stress response pathways provides cardiometabolic
  protection in at least two ways: (i) at the cellular level by attenuating oxidative
  stress and ER stress and improving mitochondrial function to promote cell survival
  and (ii) at the organismal level by leading to secretion of endocrine factors such
  as FGF21 and GDF15 to improve systemic and cardiovascular metabolic fitness. FGF21,
  fibroblast growth factor 21; GDF15, growth and differentiation factor 15.'
