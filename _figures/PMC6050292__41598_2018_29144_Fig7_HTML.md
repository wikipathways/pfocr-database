caption: The dynamics of S1P- and ceramide-synthesis pathway. The gene expression
  levels of substrates with red capitals were increased in biliary tract cancer compared
  to normal biliary tract tissue, those with blue capitals were decreased in biliary
  tract cancer compared to normal biliary tract tissue, and those with black capitals
  were equivalent between them according to TCGA cohort.
