caption: One of the pathways of the prototypic signaling network is illustrated. Here,
  solid black lines represent reactions that have non-zero fluxes, while dotted red
  lines represent reactions that have zero fluxes when the production of the activated
  transcription factor T1p is maximized as the pathway objective.
