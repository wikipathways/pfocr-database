caption: Major mechanisms linking obesity with impaired muscle regeneration. Obesity
  is associated with insulin and leptin resistance, elevated circulating and intramuscular
  fatty acids, diacylglycerols, ceramides and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Following
  muscle injury, satellite cells (depicted adjacent to muscle on left) are activated,
  proliferate, differentiate and form myofibers that grow and replace damaged tissue.
  Impairment of these processes underlies inefficient muscle regeneration in obese
  rodents. Defective leptin signaling can contribute to decreased satellite cell proliferation
  and impaired muscle hypertrophy, but the molecular mechanisms are not known. Fatty
  acids, diacylglycerols (DAG) and ceramides induce apoptosis and decrease myoblast
  proliferation and differentiation, possibly via activation of myostatin and inhibition
  of MyoD and myogenin expression and/or activity. Ceramides and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines inhibit muscle growth in part by inhibiting the IGF-1/Akt /mTOR pathway.
