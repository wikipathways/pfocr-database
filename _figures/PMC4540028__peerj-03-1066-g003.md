caption: 'Azadirachtin is the most prominent biopesticide belonging to organic molecule
  class called tetranortriterpenoids. Triterpenoids derived basically from squalene
  which in turn is derived from geranylpyrophosphate (GPP). GPP can be derived from
  mevalonate (MVA) or 2-C-methyl-D875 erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. Enzymes
  of MVA pathway are as follows: AACT, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  CoA synthase; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; MVK, mevalonate
  kinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; PMD, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase. Enzymes
  of MEP pathway are DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; DXR, 1-deoxy-D
  xylulose-5-phosphate reducto-isomerase; MCT, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate
  cytidylyltransferase; CMK, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase; MDS,
  2-C methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; HDS, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl
  diphosphate synthase; HDR, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase. Isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate isomerase (IPPI) catalyzes the isomerisation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate
  (IPP) to dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), whereas conversion of IPP to geranyl
  pyrophosphate (GPP) is catalyzed by geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPS). GPP is
  further converted to farnesyl-diphosphate (FPP) and squalene by farnesyl-diphosphatesynthase
  (FPS) and squalene synthase (SS) respectively. Solid arrows indicate known steps,
  whereas broken arrows represents unknown intermediates and enzymes. Numbers beside
  coloured blocks indicate tissue types (1, developing endosperm; 2, mature leaf;
  3, mature fruit; 4, seedling root; 5, fruit coat and pulp; 6, seedling shoot; 7,
  open flower and flower bud) and heatmap is represented as expression RPKM value.'
