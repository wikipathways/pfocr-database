caption: ABCA1, a major transporter that regulates HDL biogenesis and cholesterol
  efflux in macrophages accumulated in the artery wall, is regulated by a number of
  miRNAs including miR-33. miR-33 controls numerous steps of the reverse cholesterol
  transport pathway by regulating the expression of numerous genes associated with
  HDL biogenesis (ABCA1), cholesterol efflux in peripheral tissues including macrophages
  and cardiac fibroblasts [ABCA1 and ABCG1 (only in rodents)] and bile acid synthesis
  (CYP7A1) and secretion (ABCB11 and ATP8B1)in liver. In addition, miR-33 also promotes
  lipid accumulation in macrophages and favors Mtb survival by targeting the expression
  of key autophagy effectors ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, LAMP-1 and LIPA and controls macrophage
  polarization by regulating the expression of PRKAA1, AMPK and ALDH1A2. In addition
  to miR-33, ABCA1 is highly regulated at the post-transcriptional level in several
  tissues by numerous miRNAs including miR-148a, miR-144, miR-101, miR-128, miR-27a/b,
  miR-302a and miR-10b. Free cholesterol in nascent HDL is further esterified to cholesteryl
  esters by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) leading to the formation of
  mature HDL particles. HDL particles deliver cholesterol to the liver via the SRB1
  receptor, which is also regulated by several miRNAs including miR-185, miR-223,
  and miR-96. This figure was performed using the Servier Medical Art illustration
  resources.
