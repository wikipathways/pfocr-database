caption: Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage may stimulate the assembly of DNAPKsome
  formation and activation of Mps1, which phosphorylates c-Abl at Threonine 735 (T735),
  promoting its cytoplasmic translocation. c-Abl phosphorylates the Tyrosine 56 (Y56)
  in the PIM domain of OTULIN, disrupting its association with LUBAC. The released
  LUBAC interacts with SPATA2 and is involved in the TNF-R1-mediated signaling pathway,
  which could also be activated by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress may also directly
  activate ATM, which phosphorylate the scaffolding subunit of PP2A, PR65, at Serine
  401 (S401). This phosphorylation disassembles the holoenzyme, causing the translocation
  of phosphorylated PR65 to the cytoplasm and retention of the catalytic subunit,
  PP2A(C), in the nucleus. P2A(C) interacts with and dephosphorylates γ-H2AX. In case
  of severe DNA damage, nuclear ATM activation may lead to the phosphorylation of
  c-Abl at S465, which may interfere with DNAPKsome formation and facilitate apoptotic
  processes.
