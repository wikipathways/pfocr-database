caption: Models of DAMPs and PRRs in ferroptosis. (a) TLR4 pathway in ferroptosis.
  TLR4 plays a central role in innate immunity by signaling to adaptor MYD88 or TICAM1/TRIF
  to induce proinflammatory cytokines. The activation of TLR4 induces type I IFN signaling
  in vascular endothelial cells, triggering neutrophil recruitment and subsequent
  ferroptosis-mediated cardiac damage. TLR4-dependent NF-κB activation promotes ferroptosis-related
  inflammation through the production of proinflammatory cytokines (cytokines C-C
  motif chemokine ligand 2 [CCL2], TNF, and TGFB1) during rhabdomyolysis-associated
  kidney damage. Moreover, lipid oxidation products (e.g., 4-HNE and oxPLs) can trigger
  inflammation partly through activating TLR4 signaling. The interaction of TLR4 and
  NOX4 may enhance ferroptotic cell death–mediated inflammation. (b) AGER signaling
  in ferroptosis. AGER recognizes various DAMPs, leading to the activation of signaling
  pathways, including the protein kinase C [PKC], JAK-STAT, phophatidylinositol 3-kinase
  [PI3K]–protein kinase B, and MAPK–NF-κB pathways. In addition, AGER is responsible
  for HMGB1- or KRASG12D-mediated macrophage activation and polarization in response
  to ferroptotic cancer cells. (c) STING1 pathway in ferroptosis. In this pathway,
  4-HNE inhibits STING1 activity by the carbonylation of STING1, whereas the release
  of 8-OHG from ferroptotic cancer cells activates the STING1-dependent inflammatory
  pathway in macrophages by the DNA sensor CGAS. STING1 directly promotes ferroptosis
  by increasing MAP1LC3 lipidation, thereby activating autophagy-dependent cell death
  caused by zalcitabine-induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and CTSB-mediated
  genomic DNA damage.
