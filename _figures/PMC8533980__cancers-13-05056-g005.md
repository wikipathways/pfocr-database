caption: Graphical presentation of CX-5461-mediated activation of the cytosolic DNA
  sensing pathway. cGAS binding to the cytosolic DNA activates the secondary messenger
  2,3-cGAMP using cGAS as a catalyst. Activated STING buds off the ER moving to the
  perinuclear Golgi, where it is palmitoylated. STING brings together TBK1, IRF3,
  and IKK. TBK1 phosphorylates STING, which leads to phosphorylation of IRF3 and activation
  of NFκB signaling through RelA. Both pathways lead to type I interferon activation,
  senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and interferon-stimulated gene
  (ISG) transcription.
