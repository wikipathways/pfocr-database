caption: The roles of monocytes and polarized macrophages in HTS formation. We hypothesize
  that monocytes in the blood are recruited to the injured site via the SDF-1/CXCR4
  signaling pathway and differentiate into polarized macrophages. The polarized M1
  and M2 macrophages then exert their functions via various signaling pathways and
  involve in wound healing and HTS formation
