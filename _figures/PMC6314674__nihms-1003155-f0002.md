caption: Prior to recruitment to the atherosclerotic plaque, monocytes exhibit a ‘primed’
  inflammatory phenotype, characterized by enhanced inflammatory responses that correspond
  to increases in both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Within the plaque
  microenvironment, a variety of stimuli including lipids, cytokines, cell apoptosis
  and necrosis, hypoxia, and hyperglycemia can all regulate macrophage metabolic reprogramming
  and subsequent function. Distinct macrophage phenotypes have been identified within
  the plaque, including M[IL-4]-like, M(Ox), M[LPS+IFNg]-like, and hypoxia-associated
  macrophages. These different flavors of macrophages are each associated with distinct
  metabolic signatures and inflammatory functions. PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  FAO, fatty acid oxidation; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle, OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
