caption: Lactate enters P4 and P7 to produce glucose or to go into PPP. Similarly,
  glutamine is also used for glucose production (P470), aspartate (P358) or PPP (P12565).
  P43 shows the conversion of aspartate to urea. There are also pathways where conversion
  of lactate to cysteine and alanine (P41); and glutamine to glutamate (P21) take
  place. P2 includes arginine uptake, formation and secretion of ornithine and urea.
  P27933 are related to ketone bodies where conversion between acetoacetate and B-OH-butyrate
  by B-OH-butyrate dehydrogenise is seen. Note that external metabolites are given
  in bold boxes.
