caption: Maintenance of initiated cross bridge-cycling (by Ca2+/MLCK/phosphorylated-MLC20
  or p-MLC20) in the sustained smooth muscle contraction or the basal myogenic tone
  depends on the mechanisms that inhibit MLCP. (Reaction that represents lack or low
  level of p-MLC20 points towards the left, and the one for the higher levels of p-MLC20
  points towards right). MLCK drives the reaction towards right, and MLCP will change
  the direction to the left. Likewise, MLCP inhibition either by ROCK II or PKC will
  drive the reaction to the right. In this regard, as discussed in the text and in
  the  legend below, RhoA/ROCK pathway is predominant as compared with the PKC in
  the basal myogenic tone. In addition, as indicated, there appears to be a cross-talk
  between these pathways. In the phasic smooth muscles such as that of the esophageal
  body and the ASM in the basal state, MLCP may be unleashed (because of the subdued
  inhibitory RhoA/ROCK or PKC pathways), thus keeping these smooth muscles totally
  relaxed in the absence of any agonist or stimulus. In such phasic smooth muscles
  however, in response to an appropriate agonist or stimulus, the tissues respond
  to a phasic or transient contraction following an increase in p-MLC20 which is dephosphorylated
  immediately (in a matter of a few sec., depending upon the stimulus), by the leftward
  reaction by MLCP, returning it to its original relaxed state.
