caption: Model for possible sequence of genomic events in PCA progression. The acquisition
  of PTEN haplo-insufficiency in prostatic precursor results in a decrease in PTEN
  protein level, which could lead to genomic instability and the formation of high-grade
  prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). This genomic instability could facilitate
  ERG rearrangement, and together, synergistic co-operation between PTEN and ERG abnormalities
  is associated with early steps of PCA formation. Continuing genetic instability
  generates “PTEN null” subclones and allows the selective advantage for further tumor
  progression through activation of the Akt pathway. Modified from ().
