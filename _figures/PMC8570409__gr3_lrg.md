caption: 'Coronavirus immunity cycle. Following SARS-CoV-2 uptake in the endosome
  and virion degradation the viral antigens are presented in (1) the exogenous pathway,
  (2) cross-presentation pathway and (3) endogenous pathway; partial genome transcription
  may provide a source of antigen for priming T-cells by MHC class-1 antigen processing
  following endogenous pathway. Viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs),
  using endosomal or cytosolic PRRs, as well as the production of cytokines such as
  IFN-1, can promote potent cellular mediated immune responses. Structural or nonstructural
  proteins might be recognized by TLR-4 or inflammasome, leading to the activation
  of proinflammatory cytokines. Abbreviations: APC, antigen-presenting cells; IFN-1,
  interferon 1; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1.'
