caption: Schematic of the proposed signaling pathway. Under physiological conditions,
  nephrin is phosphorylated by the Src kinase Fyn to a certain degree in podocytes.
  Phospho-nephrin recruits c-Abl, resulting in autoinhibition of c-Abl activation.
  Phospho-nephrin is decreased in the presence of Ang II. After nephrin dephosphorylation,
  c-Abl is released from nephrin and activated. c-Abl activation results in the recruitment
  and phosphorylation of SHIP2. Phospho-SHIP2 dephosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(3,4)P2,
  which results in Akt dephosphorylation and ultimately podocyte injury.
