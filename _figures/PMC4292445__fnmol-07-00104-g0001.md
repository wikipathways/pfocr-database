caption: Prostanoid biosynthetic pathway. Arachidonic acid is converted via a two-step
  process (cyclooxygenation and hydroperoxidation) by cyclooxygenase enzymes COX-1
  or COX-2 into the unstable prostaglandin PGH2. COX-1 is constitutively expressed
  while COX-2 is mostly an inducible enzyme that is upregulated under stress conditions.
  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block the activities of both enzymes
  while Coxibs are selective COX-2 inhibitors. PGH2 is then converted to prostanoid
  products (PGE2, PGF2α, PGD2, PGI2, and TXA2) by specific prostaglandin synthases
  that differ in their cell type distribution. Of these products, PGD2 is highly unstable
  (estimated brain half-life of 1.1 min) resulting in the non-enzymatic formation
  of J2 prostaglandins.
