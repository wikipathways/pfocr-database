caption: The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway was inhibited by AGE,
  GTE, GO, and juçara pulp powder, attenuating the production of proinflammatory cytokines
  and suppressing obesity-induced inflammation [,,,]. NF-κB inhibition decreases the
  circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α
  (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6. IL-6 was decreased by AGE, BBT, a carob- and wakame-enriched
  snack, OPE, GTE, GO, juçara pulp powder, S. maxima extract, and flaxseed oil [,,,,,,,,].
  TNF-α was inhibited by AGE, BBT, artichoke extract, GSE, onion peel, GTE, GO, juçara
  pulp powder, S. platensis powder, and flaxseed oil [,,,,,,,,,]. Coffee and green
  tea, GO, and juçara pulp powder downregulated the expression of monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1 (MCP-1), inhibiting monocyte adhesion [,,]. Artichoke extract, GE, GSE,
  OPE, mangosteen extract, S. platensis powder, and flaxseed oil decreased high-sensitivity
  C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels [,,,,,,]. GO, canola oil, high-oleic-acid canola
  oil, and extra virgin olive oil reduced IL-1β [,,]. BBT increased IL-10 []. Artichoke
  extract regulated IL-1 and interferon (IFN) []. Melinjo seed activated the cGMP-AMP
  (cGAMP) synthase-cGAMP-stimulator of interferon genes pathway by activating disulfide
  bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DSBA-L) []. Onion peel decreased ferritin [].
  Watermelon decreased VCAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and P-selectin,
  which attracts immune cells to damaged areas of the endothelium []. Mangosteen extract
  inhibited the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by altering
  cyclooxygenase (COX) and COX2 gene expression []. IL-2 was decreased by S. platensis
  powder []. Canola oil and high-oleic-acid canola oils inhibited inflammasome-mediated
  caspase-1 (CASP1) activity []. Coconut, safflower, and chia oils upregulated cAMP-dependent
  signaling pathways, which produce antiadipogenic prostaglandins that function in
  the adaptive reactions of cyclooxygenases [].
