caption: NOD-like receptor (NLR) family and inflammasome. NOD1/2 sense peptidoglycan
  fragments (iE-DAP and MDP) respectively and activate signaling pathways via the
  serine/threonine RIP2 kinase through CARD-CARD homophilic interactions. Once activated,
  RIP2 mediates the ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ leading to the activation of NF-κB
  and the production of inflammatory cytokines. In addition to the NF-κB pathway,
  NOD2 stimulation induces the activation of MAPKs. Several NALPs, NALP1, NALP3, and
  IPAF, have been identified to sense various ligands and form a cytoplasmic mutiprotein
  complex called inflammasome. These NALPs recruit the adaptor protein ASC through
  their PYD domain, which in turn interacts with caspase-1 via a CARD-CARD interaction
  to form inflammasome. Consequently, inflammasome activation triggers the processing
  of pro-caspase-1 into a mature form, caspase-1 and active caspase-1 induces cell
  death and the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokine pro-IL-1β into IL-1β.
