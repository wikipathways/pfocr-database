caption: 'Cysteine metabolism as a source for biomass and bioenergetics. Cys catabolism
  generates several intermediates that are involved in several metabolic pathways.
  Through the action of CSE or MST and CAT, besides generating H2S, Cys generates
  pyruvate, which can supply the TCA cycle and consequently contribute to energy production.
  Pyruvate can also be converted into alanine and lactate. The products of Cys metabolism
  can also be deviated to the PPP, which is involved in both nucleotide and amino
  acid synthesis. In the kidney, the main source of energy is fatty acid β-oxidation,
  and since the pyruvate resulting from Cys catabolism can also originate acetyl-coA,
  this suggest Cys as an alternative acetyl-CoA supplier for oxidative phosphorylation
  and fatty acid synthesis. AA: amino acid; CAT: cysteine aminotransferase; CBS: cystathionine
