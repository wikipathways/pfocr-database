caption: Schematic representation of GCase inhibitions on microglia and neuron communication.
  Microglia, through actin-dependent structures, directly contact neurons and induce
  a detoxification response by increasing the NFE2L2 signaling pathway. Inhibition
  of GCase activity by CBE treatment produces a morpho-functional change in microglia
  which acquire a morphology and gene expression pattern reminiscent of Gaucher’s
  cells. This phenotype shift hampers the neuroprotective microglia-neuron communication
  thus inducing a phenotype in dopaminergic neurons characterized by increased susceptibility
  to oxidative stress or toxic insults
