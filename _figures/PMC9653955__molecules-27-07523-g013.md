caption: A suggested, simplified model for F7 and niraparib activity in OC cells in
  relation to the Wnt pathway. F7, niraparib or niraparib+F7 treatments significantly
  reduced FZD4 and FZD1 expression. This activity for F7 was partially dependent on
  CB2 activation. The expression of Wnt was altered by the treatments. Treatment with
  F7 also increased DKK1 expression in one of the examined cell lines. DKK1 inhibited
  the dimerization of FZD (with LRP5/6 receptor, not shown), directly preventing FZD
  activation. As a possible result of the alterations of the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway, mesenchymal phenotype was inhibited, DVL2 and RAD51 expression was reduced
  and cell apoptosis was induced. Wnt, wingless/int1; FZD, Frizzled; DKK, Dickkopf;
