caption: Receptors expressed by endothelial cells, such as PRRs, TAM, and major facilitator
  super family domain containing 2a (Mfsd2a), have the function of stabilizing the
  BBB. Endothelial cells express a variety of PRRs, and after recognizing PAMPs of
  viruses, they can activate the IFN signaling pathway and induce the production of
  type I IFN (IFN-1) and type III IFN in endothelial cells. The combination of IFN-1s
  and their receptor, IFNAR, can activate the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, and promote
  the expression of a series of antiviral gene IFN-stimulated genes. In addition,
  IFN-1 can activate Rac1 in endothelial cells to stabilize the integrity of the BBB.
