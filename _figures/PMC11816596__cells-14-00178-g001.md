caption: 'Canonical Wnt pathway (left): Wnt ligands (such as Wnt1, Wnt2, Wnt3, Wnt3a,
  and Wnt 8) bind to the frizzled (FZD) receptor and its coreceptors LRP5/6 (LDL-receptor-related
  proteins). This interaction recruits disheveled (DVL) and disrupts the destruction
  complex (AXIN, GSK-3β, CKIα, and APC), which normally degrades β-catenin. As a result,
  β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to
  TCF/LEF transcription factors, leading to gene activation. The target genes of this
  pathway include important regulators of cellular differentiation and proliferation,
  such as c-Myc and cyclin D. Non-canonical pathway (right): The non-canonical Wnt
  pathways (such as the Wnt/PCP and Wnt/Ca2+ pathways) are β-catenin-independent and
  involve different ligands (e.g., Wnt5a, Wnt4, and Wnt11). These ligands bind to
  FZD and other co-receptors such as ROR2. The signaling cascade activates proteins
  such as Rac1, RhoA, JNK, ROCK, and Ca2+-dependent effectors like CAMKII and NFAT.
  These pathways control processes like cytoskeletal remodeling, cellular migration,
  and polarization. Figure created on https://BioRender.com accessed on 16 September
