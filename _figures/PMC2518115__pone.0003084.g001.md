caption: (A) Diagram of dHV shuttle plasmids. The structure of pdHV differs from that
  of pdHV.68/5′3′ and pdHV.68/3′5′ in that the former construct only codes for eGFP
  whereas the latter plasmids have, in addition, a FLP-inducible AAV rep68 expression
  module (see below) inserted in between the Ad packaging signal and the AAV p5IEE
  in the 5′→3′ (pdHV.68/5′3′) or in the 3′→5′ orientation (pdHV.68/3′5′). Solid box,
  Ad ITR (hAd5 base pairs 1 through 103); Ψ, Ad packaging signal-containing sequence
  (hAd5 genome positions 104 through 454); shaded box with broken line, inducible
  AAV2 rep68 expression unit; shaded circle, p5IEE (AAV2 genome positions 153 through
  291); line with subscript “dystrophin”, stuffer DNA derived from human dystrophin
  cDNA; solid triangle, human growth hormone gene pA signal; open box, eGFP ORF; solid
  box with broken arrow, hEF1α promoter; shaded oval, AAV ITR (AAV2 nucleotides 1
  through 145); open circle, prokaryotic origin of replication. (B) Schematic representation
  of the rescue process of capsid-modified and rep68-positive dHV particles. Rescue
  of dHV DNA into hAd5 capsids containing chimeric fibers is initiated by releasing
  it from the plasmid backbone at the indicated PmeI restriction sites and transfecting
  the digestion products into the hAd5 E1-complementing PER.tTA.Cre76 cells. These
  cells are next infected with the E1-deleted helper Ad vector Ad.floxedΨ.F50, which
  supplies in trans all Ad DNA replication activities and Ad structural proteins (including
  chimeric fiber proteins) needed for the amplification and packaging of dHV DNA,
  respectively. Replication- and packaging-competent tail-to-tail dimers are assembled
  from input monomers due to Ad-dependent DNA replication and AAV ITR-mediated dimerization.
  The resulting dHV particles display on their surface hAd50 fiber domains and can
  be amplified by serial propagation in Ad.floxedΨ.F50-infected producer cells prior
  to purification in CsCl density gradients. The use of a helper Ad vector which has
  its packaging signal flanked by bacteriophage P1 loxP sites in combination with
  producer cells expressing the bacteriophage P1 cre gene strongly inhibits the formation
  of helper Ad particles. (C) Transduction pathway of rep68-positive dHVs. The FLP-inducible
  rep68 expression unit consists of a direct repeat of two FRT sequences flanking
  the AAV2 rep68 ORF followed by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene pA
  signal and the hGAPDH promoter. Since the transcription-promoting elements of the
  hGAPDH gene are positioned downstream of the Rep68-coding sequence, the rep68 ORF
  is not preceded by an active promoter and hence should not get expressed. To suppress
  rep68 activation by possible cryptic promoter elements located upstream of the rep68
  initiation codon, a transcriptional terminator from the murine metallothionine gene
  was introduced immediately upstream of the 5′ FRT site. The FLP-inducible rep68
  expression module is located between the Ad cis-acting elements (i.e., the Ad ITR
  and the Ad packaging signal [Ψ]) and the AAV p5IEE. Excision and circularization
  of the FRT-flanked DNA by FLPe will position the hGAPDH promoter in front of the
  rep68 ORF and lead to the synthesis of Rep68. Finally, Rep68-mediated interactions
  between the RBEs in the vector DNA (i.e., AAV p5IEE and AAV ITR) and in human chromosome
  19 (i.e. AAVS1 locus) will induce targeted chromosomal insertion of dHV DNA.
