caption: 'Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The OXPHOS metabolic pathway
  generates ATP by transporting electrons through a series of transmembrane complexes
  in the mitochondrial inner membrane, known as the electron transport chain (ETC).
  Electrons flow through complex I, complex II, coenzyme Q (Q), complex III, cytochrome
  c (C), and complex IV, with O2 acting as the terminal electron acceptor. Therapeutic
  agents that are OXPHOS inhibitors are shown in red boxes. 3-NPA: 3-nitropropionic
  acid; TTFA: 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone.'
