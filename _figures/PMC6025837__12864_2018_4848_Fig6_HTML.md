caption: A network of putative interactions between differently expressed miRNAs and
  target genes in the TH signaling pathway. The red box indicates the genes that were
  upregulated by T3 treatment, while the green box indicates the genes that were downregulated
  by T3. The blue line presented the relative expression of miRNAs targeting the gene
