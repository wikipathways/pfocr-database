caption: Molecular pathways regulating breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). Akt represents
  a central hub in the Wnt/β-catenin and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling
  pathways. Upstream of Akt is the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor.
  Loss of PTEN results in Akt activation and thus the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway through the Akt-mediated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta
  (GSK3-β) and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Through autocrine, juxtacrine,
  and paracrine mechanisms, secreted Hedgehog (Hh) interacts with the 12 trans-membrane
  Patched 1 (PTCH) receptor, de-repressing the 7 trans-membrane Smoothened (SMO) protein
  and allowing its translocation to the cilia. Activated SMO promotes a signaling
  cascade resulting in activation of the GLI transcription factors and thus in upregulation
  of genes that regulate cellular differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Four
  different Notch receptors (Notch 1, Notch 2, Notch 3, and Notch 4) interact with
  five ligands (Delta-like 1, Delta-like 3, Delta-like 4, Jagged 1, and Jagged 2)
  expressed on neighboring cells. The interaction between ligand and the extracellular
  domain of Notch receptor triggers the cleavage by gamma-secretase and the release
  of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates into the nucleus and
  associates with transcription factors regulating Notch target genes expression.
  The interaction between CXCR1/2 and interleukin (IL)-8 increases CSC self-renewal.
  HER2 regulates CSCs through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and loss
  of PTEN results in the downstream activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The
  activation of an inflammatory loop involving IL-6 and IL-8 has been shown to determine
  PTEN suppression and thus the resistance to HER2-targeting agents. IkB, kinase B
  inhibitor; p50, protein 50; Src, rous sarcoma oncogene cellular homolog; Stat3,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
