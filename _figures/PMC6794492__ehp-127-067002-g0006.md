caption: 'Schematic representation of parallel pathway in detoxifying environmental
  electrophiles. Transcription factor Nrf2 is a central coordinator for induction
  of detoxifying genes such as GCL, GST, MRP, and HO-1 (; ) and metabolic enzymes
  such as GBE (). Canonical pathway: Many in vitro and in vivo studies reported that
  Nrf2 contributes to detoxification of environmental electrophiles via GSH adduct
  formation and subsequent excretion into extracellular spaces (; , ). Noncanonical
  pathway: Our mouse model provided that RSS generation mediated by CSE contributes
  to detoxifying environmental electrophiles through sulfur adduct formation. Note:
  CSE, cystathionine ; E, environmental electrophile; GBE, glycogen branching enzyme;
  GCL, glutamate–cysteine ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HO-1, hemeoxygenase-1;
  MRP, multidrug resistance-associated protein; Nrf2, nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related
  factor 2; RSS, reactive sulfur species.'
