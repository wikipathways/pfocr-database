caption: Schematic representation of the effect of paclitaxel (PTX) and MG132 on the
  NF-κB signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. PTX phosphorylates and activates
  the IκK complex, leading to the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation
  of IκBα. This frees NF-κB, which is then activated and translocated to the nucleus,
  thereby activating transcription of multiple downstream genes. This leads to an
  increased expression of proteins related to cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and
  invasion, and decreases apoptosis. MG132 inhibits the degradation of IκBα, thereby
  inhibiting activation and output of NF-κB signaling, possibly by targeting IκBα
  and decreasing the nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of NF-κB. This leads to a decreased
  expression of proteins related to the cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion,
  and increases apoptosis. Stimulatory events are indicated with green arrows. Inhibitory
  events are indicated with red lines ending in bars.
