caption: 'Activation of TRPV1 in sensory nerves by NGF. TRPV1 is expressed by sensory
  afferents that have cell bodies in vagus nerve, trigeminal ganglia, and dorsal root
  ganglia. TRPV1 activation initiates downstream signaling of three major pathways
  including PI3K, TAK-1, and JAK signaling pathways. TRPV1 activation is required
  for release of neuropeptides such as SP and CGRP. Abbreviations: TRPV1, transient
  receptor potential vanilloid; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; TAK-1, transforming
  growth factor-activated kinase 1; JAK, Janus kinase; SP, substance P; CGRP, calcitonin
  gene-related peptide. Created in BioRender. Garajova, I. (2024). https://BioRender.com/z29w911
