caption: Models for the proposed function of PFT1 in light signaling during photomorphogenic
  seedling development and the regulation of flowering. A, Proposed function of PFT1
  in light signaling downstream of different photoreceptors. PFT1 may function mainly
  by up-regulation of the HY5 basic Leu-zipper transcription factor gene, a central
  positive regulator of early light signaling. COP1- function as negative regulators
  that target positively acting factors like HY5 to degradation in the proteasome
  until COP1 inactivation by Pfr- and/or cry1/2-dependent mechanisms. COP1- activity
  would act downstream of PFT1 by counteracting the protein accumulation of regulatory
  factors, for which transcription becomes up-regulated by the function of the respective
  subunit of a plant Mediator complex. PFT1 should also function as a negatively acting
  component in a phyA signaling cascade that inhibits phyB responses. PIFs, Phytochrome-interacting
  proteins. B, Proposed function of PFT1 in regulation of the floral transition. PFT1
  is thought to mainly function downstream of phyA. As a component of the Mediator
  complex, PFT1 seems to increase the expression of the CO gene, a central regulator
  of the photoperiod pathway that is also involved in the acceleration of flowering
  under high far-red conditions sensed by phyB. CO protein levels are also regulated
  by phyA and cry1/2, both of which block COP1-dependent ubiquitin ligase activity
  in the light. Additionally, PFT1 might inhibit expression of the FLC gene, an important
  repressor of the FT florigen. The model further proposes that PFT1 inhibits phyB-dependent
  inhibition of  in a phyA-dependent manner.
