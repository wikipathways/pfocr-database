caption: The cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA‐4) pathway is a target of immune
  checkpoint inhibitors. The CTLA‐4 pathway negatively regulates T cells in the early
  immune response. For initial T cell activation, two signals are required. Upon the
  delivery of signal 1 via T cell receptor–major histocompatibility complex (TCR–MHC)
  interaction, CTLA‐4 is up‐regulated on the cell surface, with peak expression at
  48–72 h post‐TCR stimulation. Signal 2 of T cell activation is attained via interaction
  of CD28 with the co‐stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. As a CD28 homologue, CTLA‐4
  also binds CD80 and CD86, but with a greater affinity than CD28. CTLA‐4 ligation
  with CD80/CD86 results in reduced CD28 binding, as well as negative downstream signalling
  through CTLA‐4, both of which result in inhibition T cell activation. This pathway
  has become a target of novel anti‐cancer therapies known as checkpoint inhibitors.
  Ipilimumab and tremelimumab are the two current CTLA‐4‐targeting monoclonal antibodies.
