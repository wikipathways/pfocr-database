caption: Mesenchymal stem cell–derived exosomes (MSC-Exos)–based regulation of T–regulatory
  cells (Tregs):Th17 cell ratio in inflamed eyes. MSC-Exos, in indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase
  (IDO)–dependent manner, promote expansion of immunosuppressive Tregs in inflamed
  eyes of patients with dry eye disease (DED). IDO, derived from MSC-Exos and tolerogenic
  dendritic cells (DCs), attenuates concentration of tryptophan (TRP) in inflamed
  microenvironment. Low levels of TRP induce activation of general control non-derepressible
  2 (GCN2) kinase which inhibits protein kinase B (PKB/Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR)2 signaling in Tregs and prevents their transdifferentiation in inflammatory
  Th17 cells. MSC-Exos–derived transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) suppresses
  activation of Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/Stat)
  signaling pathway in IL-17-producing Th17 cells, causing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest
