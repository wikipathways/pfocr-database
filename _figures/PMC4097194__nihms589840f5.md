caption: '(a) Schematic of major steps in the insulation of two pathways following
  a duplication event. The duplication of an ancestral pathway initially produces
  two identical pathways that cross-talk at the level of phosphotransfer. Through
  the accumulation of mutations in specificity-determining residues, the two pathways
  can become insulated. A similar process must occur, but is not shown, at the levels
  of kinase and regulator homodimerization. (b) Phosphotransfer specificity of EnvZ,
  RstB, and various RstB mutants. Each kinase was autophosphorylated and tested for
  transfer to each of three response regulators, RstA, OmpR, and CpxR. Data are from
  (). The wild-type RstB is shown at far left. The phosphotransfer specificity can
  be converted to that of EnvZ, shown at far right, by mutating three of its six specificity-
  determining residues to match those found in EnvZ (the other three sites are already
  identical between EnvZ and RstB; see ). This triple mutant of RstB as well as each
  single and double mutant intermediate are labeled based on the identity of the three
  specificity residues with blue text indicating identity with the wild-type RstB
  and red indicating identity with the wild-type EnvZ. Notably, some intermediates
  do not phosphorylate any of the regulators whereas some phosphorylate all three.
  (c) Schematic summarizing the distribution of histidine kinases in the sequence
  space defined by their specificity-determining residues. Each sphere represents
  the set of response regulators that a given kinase phosphorylates. With the exception
  of NarQ and NarX, these spheres are presented as non-overlapping to reflect the
  minimal cross-talk between pathways. The relative positions of spheres is based
  on the ability of individual kinases to phosphorylate the cognate response regulators
  of other kinases after extended times in vitro (; ). Positions are approximate and
  the diagram is only intended to convey a general sense of how kinases are distributed
  in sequence space. Spheres are colored according to the subfamily of each kinase’s
  response regulator: red, CheY/receiver domain only; pink, OmpR/winged helix-turn-helix;
  green, NtrC/AAA+ and FIS domains; blue, NarL/GerE helix-turn-helix; brown, LytR.
  Spheres with dashed outlines indicate kinases for which no data existed to infer
  relative positions. Note, hybrid histidine kinases are excluded.'
