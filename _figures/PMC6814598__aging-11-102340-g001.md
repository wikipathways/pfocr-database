caption: Damaged nuclear DNA export, sensing and clearance in aging-related inflammation.
  Left, schematic showing nuclear-autophagy-lysosome DNA clearance pathway in which
  nuclear DNA trafficked to cytosol is enclosed by autophagosomes and delivered to
  lysosomes for degradation by DNASE2A. Excess extranuclear DNA accumulated upon increased
  DNA damage (old cells), deficit repair (AT), deformed nuclear barrier (HGPS), or
  defective degradation (Dnase2a-/-), can activate innate DNA sensing cGAS-cGAMP-STING
  pathway and induce aging-associated IFN response and inflammation. Right, immunofluorescent
  images of anti-dsDNA staining (green) in replicative senescent (SEN), AT and HGPS
  human fibroblasts. Pseudo-colored (red) overlaid to enhance visualization of lobulated
  nuclear envelop and excess extranuclear DNA burden in forms of buds, speckles and
  large aggregates (asterisk in AT); N, nucleus.
