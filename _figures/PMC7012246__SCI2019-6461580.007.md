caption: Schematic representation of the ERK-mediated mechanisms of MG treatment.
  Upon MG treatment, healing-associated growth factors present in the soluble fraction
  of the micrograft activate the MAPK signaling pathway, resulting in the phosphorylation
  of ERK. c-Jun and Fra-1 undergo dimerization to form the transcription factor AP-1.
  Once phosphorylated by ERK, AP-1 stabilizes in the nucleus to bind promoter regions
  of Fosl1, establishing a feedback loop. Additionally, AP-1 also binds the promoter
  regions of wound healing-associated genes, such as those involved in the regulation
  of cell migration.
