caption: A working model to explain how CsERF31 mediates female flower development
  in cucumber. In this model, the upstream ethylene (C2H4 in black ovals) represses
  CsWIP1 in an unknown way and activates CsEIN3 in the ethylene signaling pathway
  to promote CsERF31 expression. CsERF31 stimulates CsACS2 to produce more ethylene
  (C2H4 in red oval, left part of figure), forming the “ethylene-CsERF31-CsACS” positive
  feedback loop (ACC, the precursor of ethylene). High expression of CsERF31 arrests
  the stamen and promotes complete pistil initiation of female bud development. However,
  in csacs2 mutants, loss-of-function CsACS2 could not form a positive feedback loop.
  Low expression of CsERF31 (the light red text) can barely arrested the stamen and
  partially promotes the pistil, producing a bisexual bud only (middle part of figure).
  When lacking upstream ethylene (right part of the figure), the whole pathway is
  turned off, and the expression of CsWIP1 induces exclusive male bud development.
  The red text represents the gene or the process was activated, gray represents the
  inactivation.
