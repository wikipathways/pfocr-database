caption: '(A) Metabolic reprogramming in chronic kidney disease (CKD) in tubular epithelial
  cells. CKD is characterized by a gradual and progressive shift of energy metabolism
  from oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) to glycolysis in the kidney. CKD
  triggers pathological mechanisms such as hemodynamic changes and hypertrophy. This,
  together with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, favors the activation
  of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), enhancing glycolytic flux and the
  accumulation of glycolytic metabolites such as pyruvate. Additionally, ROS overproduction
  decreases protein levels and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), reducing
  mitochondrial biogenesis in the kidney. The mitochondrial impairment induced in
  CKD is characterized by a decrease in the activity of the electron transport system
  (ETS) and OXPHOS, which reduces ATP production by decreasing mitochondrial membrane
  potential (↓ΔΨm). The ΔΨm drop and the oxidative stress in this organelle trigger
  mitochondrial fragmentation by fission-induction and the subsequent recruitment
  of the mitophagy machinery. However, the impairment in autophagy flux together with
  the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) derived from a dysfunctional β-oxidation
  trigger the accumulation of damaged mitochondria; thus, enhancing cellular death
  and pathological processes. (B) Extracellular vehicles (EVs) contribution to metabolic
  reprogramming in CKD. Ischemic condition or the increase in glucose concentration
  (↑[Glu]) in CKD triggers the activation of pathological factors such as HIF-1α.
  This factor promotes mitochondrial impairment by the ΔΨm, OXPHOS, ETS, and ATP production
  decrease. The ATP level reduction results in sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium
  (Ca2+) ATPase (SERCA) activity reduction, increasing Ca2+cytosolic levels and the
  formation and secretion of the EVs. Meanwhile, mitochondrial stress favors the formation
  of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs), which are loaded with mitochondria-damaged
  components and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolites under pathological conditions.
  These MDVs incorporate into multivesicular bodies to be secreted in the form of
  exosomes. HIF-1α also favors the increase in glycolytic enzymes and metabolites
  that are incorporated into EVs. In addition, HIF-1α and mitochondrial dysfunction
  promote the incorporation into EVs of messenger RNA (mRNA) and metabolic reprogramming
  microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miRNA21, miRNA-23a, and miRNA17. Once internalized,
  EVs’ cargoes activate the glycolytic pathway and mitochondrial damage in the recipient
  cell, triggering ROS production and amplifying cell damage to distant nephron segments.
