caption: The newly elucidated regulatory mechanisms relevant to RNA m6A modification
  (created in Figdraw). As shown, the novel m6A-associated mechanisms in radiobiology
  involve the chromatin remolding of m6A regulatory enzymes and the function of m6A-modified
  enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). A. Irradiation causes disassociation of poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerase 1 (PARP1) from the promoter of METTL3 and impairs the accessibility of
  the transcription factors nuclear factor I-C (NFIC) and TATA binding protein (TBP)
  to the promoter region. Subsequently, chromatin condensation and repressed transcription
  of METTL3 occur. Decreased expression of METTL3 abates the m6A levels of its target
  genes, such as Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 5 (LPAR5), whose degradation is consequently
  accelerated after radiation. B. Top, in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), METTL3 methylates
  the super enhancer (SE) RNA lncRNA succinate-CoA ligase GDP-forming beta subunit-antisense
  1 (SUCLG2-AS1), located in the SE region of sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2).
  The stability of SUCLG2-AS1 is enhanced by the recognition of the reader protein
  insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3), and the expression
  is elevated in an m6A-dependent fashion, thereby facilitating the formation of a
  complex comprising CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), SUCLG2-AS1, SOX2 promoter, and the
  SE region through a long chromatin loop; increasing SOX2 expression; and conferring
  radioresistance to NPC cells. Bottom, the bone-specific enhancer RNA MLXIPe, with
  an m6A site, along with the mRNA of its target gene PSMD9, with m6Am site on the
  5′-UTR, is recognized by, and interacts with, RNA-binding protein KH-type splicing
  regulator protein (KHSRP). The interaction protects against PSMD9 mRNA degradation
  by 5′-3′ exoribonuclease 2 (XRN2). Thus, the m6A-methylated eRNA MLXIPe facilitates
  radioresistance in metastatic prostate cancer (mPa). C. In lung cancer, the reader
  protein IGF2BP2 is upregulated and augments radioresistance. Mechanistically, the
  m6A-modified mRNA of solute carrier family 7 member 5 or LAT1 (SLC7A5), encoding
  a sodium-independent transporter of large neutral amino acids across the cell membrane,
  is stabilized by IGF2BP2, which is elevated in lung cancer. The upregulation of
  SLC7A5 promotes the transport of Met, the substrate for SAM synthesis, into cells.
  Increased intracellular SAM further serves as a substrate for the histone lysine
  methyltransferase SETD1A, thus leading to formation of trimethylated lysine 4 of
  histone H3 (H3K4me3) at the promoter region of the IGF2BP2 gene, and enhancing IGF2BP2
  transcription through formation of a positive feedback loop between IGF2BP2 and
  SLC7A5. Consequently, IGF2BP2 enhances lung cancer radioresistance via the AKT/mTOR
  pathway
