caption: A simplified schematic diagram of the neural circuitry underlying eyeblink
  conditioning. The cerebellar anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN) and Purkinje cells
  (Pc) in the cerebellar cortex (CTX) receive convergent input from the conditioned
  stimulus (CS, green) and unconditioned stimulus (US, red) neural pathways. The pathways
  for different CSs include subcortical sensory nuclei (SN), basilar pontine nuclei
  (PN), mossy fiber (mf) projection to the AIN and cortical granule cells (Gc), and
  the parallel fiber (pf) projection to Purkinje cells. The US pathway includes the
  trigeminal nucleus (TN), dorsal accessory division of the inferior olive (IO), and
  the climbing fiber (cf) projection to the AIN and Pc. The output pathway for performance
  of the conditioned response (orange) includes the AIN projection to the red nucleus
  (RN) and its projection to facial motor nucleus (FN) which causes eyelid closure.
  The unconditioned response is elicited by activation of the TN, which then activates
  the FN. Feedback projections from the AIN to the PN, SN, and IO regulate CS and
  US input to facilitate acquisition and maintain plasticity within the cerebellum.
  Inhibitory synapses are depicted by a minus sign. All other synapses are excitatory.
