caption: Steroid hormone conversion is shown by wide green arrows, with the converting
  enzymes written within the arrow. Red arrows show potential transport between organs
  in the fetal circulation. The blue double-headed arrow indicates that exchange is
  also taking place between the placenta and the maternal circulation. Most circulating
  progesterone in the fetal circulation is likely to come from the placenta, and this
  will be reduced to 5αDHP by SRD5A1 in the placenta, fetal liver, and fetal testis,
  with the fetal liver likely to be the major site. Allopregnanolone (AlloP5) production
  by AKR1C2 is also most likely to occur in the placenta and fetal liver because the
  substrate is present in those tissues, and they express the highest total levels
  of enzyme transcript. Some conversion may also occur in the testis. Significant
  levels of androsterone are only detectable in the placenta and adrenal, and thus
  they are a likely source of the circulating steroid, although, given sex differences,
  other tissues are probably involved. The adrenal lacks other intermediates in the
  backdoor pathway, and thus AlloP5 must come from other tissues. The placenta lacks
  CYP17A1, so androsterone production is likely to depend on adrenal DHEA as substrate.
  Testosterone from the fetal testes also acts as an essential substrate for DHT synthesis
  at the external genitalia. AlloP5, allopregnanolone; An, androsterone; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone;
  DHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone; P4, progesterone; P5, pregnenolone; T, testosterone;
  5αDHP, 5α-dihydroprogesterone.
