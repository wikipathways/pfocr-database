caption: The brief molecular mechanisms of the autophagy signaling pathway.Internal
  and external signals stimulate the mTOR and AMPK. mTOR inhibits the autophagy initiation
  complex, ULK complex, consisting of ULK1/2, ATG13, FIP200 and ATG 101a. Additionally,
  AMPK activation leads to ULK1 phosphorylation, promoting the assembly of the ULK
  complex. The ULK complex further phosphorylates Beclin1, promoting formation of
  the VPS34 complex, which initiates autophagy of pre-phagophore. The isolation membrane,
  or phagophore, is promoted by a series of enzymatic reactions involving ATG proteins
  and incorporation of ATG homologs (for example, LC3) into the growing membrane.
  After cargo selection, the maturated autophagosome fuse with lysosome to degrade
  the cargos by acid hydrolases in lysosomes and then released the nutrients and metabolites
  to the cytoplasm
