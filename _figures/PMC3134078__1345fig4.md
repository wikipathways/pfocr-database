caption: Role of Dot1 in DNA damage checkpoint response and repair. The yeast proteins
  are shown, and the steps in which Dot1 has been implicated are marked by red stars.
  (A) In yeast, the PI-3 kinases Mec1/Ddc2 (human ATR/ATRIP) sense exposed ssDNA formed
  during repair of UV-, oxidative-, and alkylating-damaged DNA as well as resected
  DSBs. The sensor PI-3 kinase Tel (human ATM) recognizes blunt-end DSBs. After recognition
  and binding of sensor proteins to the site of DNA damage, mediator proteins such
  as Rad9, Dpb11, and Mrc1 are recruited and activated by phosphorylation. Dot1-mediated
  H3K79 methylation is required for the recruitment and activation of Rad9 and phosphorylation
  of the downstream transducer protein Rad53. Dot1 is also required for proper checkpoint
  function at both G1 and G2. (B) Several different DNA repair mechanisms can be used
  by the cell in response to different types of DNA damage. Damage by UV radiation
  can be repaired by NER, RR, and PRR. Loss of H3K79 methylation impairs all three
  pathways, resulting in hypersensitivity to UV damage. Damage by alkylating agents
  can be repaired by the BER pathway. In rare instances where the damage cannot be
  repaired, the error-prone TLS pathway can be activated to bypass the DNA lesion.
  It was demonstrated that Dot1 maintains DNA integrity by inhibiting TLS. Finally,
  IR, which generates DSBs, can be repaired by NHEJ. Alternatively, the DSBs can undergo
  5′-to-3′ resection and be repaired by HR. Methylation of H3K79 and the subsequent
  recruitment of Rad9 are required for regulating resection. Additionally, H3K79 methylation
  is required for the recruitment of cohesin, which is important for maintaining chromosome
  structure and for efficient SCR to repair DSBs.
