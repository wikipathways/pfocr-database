caption: The regulatory network of the 32 DEMs and the 66 DEM-regulated DEGs was drawn
  by Cytoscape 3.7.2, where red squares represent DEMs which previously reported related
  to ESCC in literature; red triangles represent DEMs which were novel reported related
  to ESCC in our study, and yellow circles represent DEM-regulated DEGs in the cell
  cycle pathway. Light blue represents DEM-regulated DEGs in proteoglycans in the
  cancer pathway, and dark blue represents DEM-regulated DEGs in Transcriptional misregulation
  in the cancer pathway. Orange represents common DEM-regulated DEGs in the protein
  digestion and absorption pathway, purple represents DEM-regulated DEGs in the p53
  signaling pathway, and green represents DEM-regulated DEGs in the Oocyte meiosis
  pathway
