caption: 'High temperature- and cortisol-induced changes in gene expression. (A) Venn
  diagram showing the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Each value
  represents the number of DEGs, with the red numbers representing the number of up-regulated
  DEGs and the blue numbers representing the number of down-regulated DEGs. The numbers
  inside overlapping circles represent the number of common DEGs. (B) PPARα signalling
  pathway. Genes indicated by red boxes and text represent genes that match DEGs.
