caption: 'Simplified schematic of cholesterol biosynthesis starting from Acetyl-CoA.
  After 13 enzymatic steps, the intermediate Lanosterol can enter one of two parallel
  pathways designated Bloch and Kandutsch-Russel pathways, respectively, both of which
  employ an NADPH-dependent reduction step which can be catalyzed by sterol C14 reductases
  LBR or TM7SF2 (highlighted in magenta). Adapted, with modifications, from (). The
  inset on the upper right depicts distinct subcellular localizations of the human
  sterol reductases LBR and TM7SF2 localizing to the inner nuclear membrane and ER,
  respectively.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16011.003'
