caption: The hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis controls androgen synthesis as part
  of a negative feedback loop. Luteinising hormone (LH) is released from the pituitary
  following stimulation by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) and stimulates
  testicular androgen production while adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secreted
  by the anterior pituitary stimulates the adrenal production. Androgens or alternative
  ligands bind to wild-type or mutant AR, causing dissociation from heat shock proteins
  (HSP) and translocation of the AR to the nucleus. The AR binds to androgen response
  elements on androgen responsive genes including TMPRSS2:ERG and PSA and coregulatory
  proteins are recruited for transcriptional activation. The 3 main structural components
  of the AR, the N-terminal domain (NTD), DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding
  domain (LBD) are shown separately. Strategies with marketing approval or in late
  stages of clinical development involve targeting of the LBD or androgens; other
  potential ligands exist. Microtubules may also be essential to AR function and could
  be disrupted with taxanes. More novel strategies involve targeting of the NTD or
  chaperone proteins.
