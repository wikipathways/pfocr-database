caption: Functional gene sets associated with innate immunity and inflammation are
  enriched in resting HD monocytes. GSEA identified biologically relevant gene sets
  that are enriched in resting HD monocytes. A network diagram of significant biological
  themes among the upregulated genes is shown, indicating number of genes (node size),
  statistical significance (darkest shading = lowest P-value) and gene content similarity
  via the Jaccard coefficient (edge thickness). Nodes with similar gene content cluster
  more closely due to an edge-weighted layout (modified for readability). An FDR cut-off
  of < 0.05 was used to determine gene set inclusion in the diagram, before the Jaccard
  coefficient was used to filter out gene sets with similar gene content. The diagram
  was rendered in Cytoscape 3.3.0.
