caption: WNT/β-catenin signaling and the potential role of heterotrimeric G proteins.
  A, the scheme presents an overview of the main players in the WNT/β-catenin pathway.
  In the subsequent experiments, hallmarks of this pathway serve as immunoblotting–
  and reporter assay–based measures of pathway activation, including P-LRP6, PS-DVL,
  β-catenin stabilization, β-catenin dephosphorylation, and TOPFlash activity, a luciferase-based
  transcriptional reporter assay for TCF/LEF activity. B, the table summarizes information
  about the family of heterotrimeric G proteins and their PTX sensitivity and expression
  in parental HEK293 cells, the ΔG7 HEK293 cells and the Gα-depleted cells, which
  underwent extensive genome editing to create a cell system without heterotrimeric
  G proteins functionally coupling to their receptors.
