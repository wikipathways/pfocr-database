caption: Analysis of different miRNAs families and their target genes implicated in
  the regulation of flower induction. The accumulation of miR156 subsequently declines
  with an increase in plant age, other factors such as sugar (HXK1) accumulation and
  the ambient temperature gradually repress miRNA156 expression, resulting in rising
  levels of SPL family genes. MiR172 expression is positively regulated by GI, that
  leads to the down-regulation of AP2-type floral repressors, miR172 is also regulated
  by ambient temperature. The miR159 is regulated by the GA pathway and in turn, miR159
  regulates the MYB transcription factors. The DELLA protein represses the expression
  of miR159 and the SPL3/4/5 genes. The miR390-ARF3/4 module regulates floral transition
  indirectly by inducing the production of ta-siRNAs from the TAS3 locus, through
  putative control over SPL gene expression. The ambient temperature-induced miR399-PHO2
  module and stress-induced miR169-NF-Y module regulate floral induction by regulating
  the expression of floral meristem identity genes. Overall, miRNAs can either promote
  or inhibit the expression of the FMI (floral meristem identity genes) and/or FPI
  (floral pathway integrator), thereby promoting or delaying the onset of flowering,
  respectively. AP2, APETALA2; ARF, AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR; HXK1, hexokinase; GI, GIGANTEA;
