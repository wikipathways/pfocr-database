caption: Overview of the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway involved in cytokine
  production. Extracelluar stimuli activate receptor and receptor associated proteins,
  which then transduce the activating signal into cellular responses by a three step
  MAPK pathway (MAPKKK, MAPKK, MAPK) that leads to p38 activation. Activated p38 can
  directly activate transcription factors or can act indirectly via two downstream
  kinases MK2 and MSK1/2. The cellular response produced can have many paracrine functions
  but can also have autocrine functions leading to further activation or suppression
  of the p38 pathway.
