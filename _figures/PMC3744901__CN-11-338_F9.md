caption: Primary GBM is associated with mutations of genes, which regulate RB/E2F
  pathway. In normal cell cycle control, the presence of DNA irregularities suppresses
  the p16-CDK4-RB pathway to inhibit progression of cell cycle past GI restriction
  point while p53 is activated to commit the damaged DNA to apoptosis. Contrarily,
  in diseased state, the activation of p53 is inhibited while uncontrolled replications
  of damaged/mutated DNA occur at the same time. In addition, the mutation or over-expression
  of growth factors and their corresponding factors leading to subsequent activation
  of downstream signaling pathways are also responsible to GBM.
