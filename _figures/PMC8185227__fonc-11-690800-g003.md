caption: Signaling pathways associated with lncRNAs regulation of EMT. (A) The positive
  feedback loop and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. First, DLGAP1-AS1 () promoted
  EMT through a positive feedback loop. Mechanistically, 1) DLGAP1-AS1 sponged and
  sequestered miR-26a-5p and miR-26b-5p to upregulate IL-6. IL-6 stimulated the JAK2/STAT3
  signaling pathway, which conversely promoted DLGAP1-AS1. 2) DLGAP1-AS1 activated
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by upregulating the downstream CDK8 and LRP6 of miR-26a/b-5p.
  Second, HCCL5 () accelerated EMT by upregulating the expression of Snail, Slug,
  ZEB1, and Twist1. In turn, HCCL5 was transcriptionally driven by ZEB1. Third, lncRNA-NEF
  () was transcriptionally activated by FOXA2 and, in turn, activated its neighboring
  gene FOXA2. LncRNA-NEF interacted with β-catenin to increase the binding of GSK3β
  with β-catenin, leading to the suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Fourth, lncRNA
  FOXD2-AS1 () induced by EGR1 promoted the EMT process by binding with EZH2 to epigenetically
  silence the DKK1 gene and activating the Wnt/β-catenin axis. Fifth, CRNDE-promoted
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activity was inhibited by CRNDE () knockdown. Unfortunately,
  the paper did not clarify how CRNDE reduces the level of signaling pathway-related
  proteins. (B) The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. First, STAT3-induced lncRNA CASC11
  () promotes EMT by binding with the enhancer of EZH2 to epigenetically silence PTEN
  and activate the PI3K/AKT axis. Second, lncRNA PTTG3P () promotes EMT by upregulating
  PTTG1 and activating the PI3K/AKT axis. Third, TMPO-AS1 () upregulated the oncogene
  FOXK1 by sponging miR-329-3p to activate the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. (C) The
  JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and MEK/ERK signaling pathway. First, HOST2 () enhanced
  EMT by upregulating the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Second, FEZF1-AS1 () increased
  EMT via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Third, HOXA-AS3 () upregulated BMP1 by
  sponging miR-29c, thus activating the MEK/ERK signaling pathway to enhance EMT.
  Fourth, the DRHC/MYBBP1A/C-Myb () complex with C-Myb inhibited the MEK/ERK signaling
  pathway and finally inhibited EMT. The corresponding references were also indicated
  under the lncRNA names on the figure.
