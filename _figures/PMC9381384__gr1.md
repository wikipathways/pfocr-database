caption: The four clusters are defined according to the function and metabolic consequences
  of genes involved in inherited disorders of vitamin B12 metabolismThe cluster “B12
  bioavailability” includes gene defects involved in B12 absorption, blood transport,
  and cellular uptake, with an expected abnormal level of blood vitamin B12 and/or
  transport proteins and a combined increase of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid.
  Note that gene defects in lysosome export may also produce vitamin B12 deficit through
  impaired vitamin B12 absorption. The “cytoplasmic transport” cluster includes gene
  defects of cytoplasmic transport with an expected normal blood level of vitamin
  B12 and/or transport proteins and a combined increase of homocysteine and methylmalonic
  acid. The “remethylation” cluster includes gene defects of the remethylation pathway
  of homocysteine with an expected normal blood level of vitamin B12 and/or transport
  proteins and methylmalonic acid and an increased level of homocysteine. The “mitochondrion”
  cluster of the B12 mitochondrion pathway includes gene defects involved in the mitochondrion
  processing of B12 and conversion of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. The complementation
  groups corresponding to vitamin B12 metabolism defects are indicated in blue font
