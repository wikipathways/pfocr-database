caption: Therapeutic traits of mAbs for Notch interference. Notch interfering by mAbs
  is based on the therapeutic scaffold of immunoglobulin G (IgG, top left panel).
  The separate domains of IgG entail different capacities, linking antigen binding
  in the fragment variable (Fv) to the framework of fragment antigen binding (Fab)
  arms, which in turn are linked to the constant fragment crystallizable (Fc), containing
  effector molecule binding sites, via a disulphide-containing hinge. These domains
  constitute a modifiable scaffold and have been combined in various Notch-targeting
  moieties (top right panel) to create bispecific and T cell-based therapeutics. If
  incorporated into therapeutics, the IgG Fc facilitates binding to the neonatal Fc
  receptor (FcRn, bottom left panel), enabling cellular recycling and specific transcytosis.
  This may grant therapeutics a long circulatory half-life and affect their biodistribution.
  IgG Fc fragments may also engage Fcγ receptors and complement proteins (bottom right
  panel) to mark antigen-expressing cells for destruction via immune cells (antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or phagocytosis (ADCP) or complement-mediated lysis
  (complement-dependent cytotoxicity, CDC). The figure was made in BioRender (https://biorender.com).
