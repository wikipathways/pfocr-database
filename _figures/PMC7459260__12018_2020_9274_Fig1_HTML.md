caption: The RANK-RANKL-OPG system. Bone metabolism is the result of the balance between
  bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. RANK is a transmembrane
  protein expressed by osteoclast precursors that derive from the colony-forming unit
  for macrophages (CFU-M). The binding of RANKL, expressed by osteoblasts, stimulates
  the formation and the activity of the osteoclasts, favoring bone resorption. OPG,
  an additional soluble protein produced by osteoblasts, prevents the binding between
  RANK and RANKL, counterbalancing bone resorption. Immune cells such as activated
  T cells and inflammatory cytokines act synergistically promoting the RANK-RANKL
  pathway. SARS-Cov-2 could have an additive effect promoting the cytokine storm which
  promotes bone resorption, but a direct effect of the virus on osteoclastic activation
  cannot be excluded. From a pharmacological point of view, estrogens and tocilizumab
  can reduce inflammatory cytokine levels (specially IL-6), whereas denosumab directly
  inhibits the RANK-RANKL interaction and they all represent potential protective
  agents against bone resorption
