caption: 'Mitochondrial-mediated ferroptosis and its implication in diseases. Cancer:
  mtDNA stress in tumor cells affects lipid metabolism and ferroptosis via the cGAS-
  STING pathway, with cGAS also promoting DRP1 oligomerization, affecting ROS production,
  and inducing ferroptosis. Cardiovascular diseases: FUNDC2 interacts with SLC25A11
  to inhibit ferroptosis. Inflammatory disease: HIF in mitochondria affects a range
  of mitochondrial functions, which in turn affects ferroptosis. Neurodegenerative
  disease: FTH1 promotes ferroptosis by affecting mitochondrial function through ferritinophagy.
  Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome: Mutations in the DGUOK gene can lead to mitochondrial
  dysfunction and mtDNA damage, further causing ferroptosis. Novel coronavirus pneumonia:
  a viral liver infection resulting in iron transfer to cells via TfR1, inhibiting
  FPN, preventing iron flow out of cells and affecting intracellular iron levels.
  Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 reduces GPX4 expression, affecting intracellular ROS production
  and ultimately inducing ferroptosis. Diabetes: Ferroptosis of pancreatic beta cells
  emergency via the ROS-autophagy-lysosome pathway. Abbreviation used: TfR1, Transferrin
