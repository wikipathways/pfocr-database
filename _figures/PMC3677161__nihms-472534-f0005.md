caption: A module that correlates with multiple LOAD clinical covariates and is enriched
  for immune functions and pathways related to microglia activity (PFC module shown).
  [Inner networks] The PFC module is enriched in genes which can be classified as
  members of the complement cascade, ‘Complement’, toll-like receptor signaling, ‘Toll-like’,
  chemokines/cytokines, ‘Chemokine’, and the major histocompatibility complex, ‘MHC’,
  or Fc receptor system, ‘Fc’. The direction and strength of interactions between
  these pathways are collected across all gene-gene causal relationships that span
  different pathways. The minimum line width corresponds to a single interaction (MHC
  to toll-like) and scales linearly to a maximum of 17 interactions (Fc to Complement).
  [Outer networks] Each color-coded group of genes consists of the core members of
  the different families and genes that are causally related to a given family. Core
  family members of each pathway are shaded darkly, while square nodes in any family
  denote literature-supported nodes (at least two PubMed abstracts implicating the
  gene or final protein complex in LOAD or a model of LOAD). Labeled nodes are either
  highly connected in the original network, literature-implicated LOAD genes or core
  members of one of the five immune families. Node size is proportional to connectivity
  in the module. See also .
