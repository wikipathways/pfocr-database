caption: Overall scheme of hypothetical effect of endocannabinoid signaling in human
  melanocytes. A, low doses of AEA (∼1 μm) and other CB1-binding endocannabinoids
  stimulate melanogenesis through a p38- and p42/44-mediated pathway, which activates
  CREB and hence tyrosinase expression through the master regulator MITF. However,
  at higher doses (∼5 μm or above), AEA promotes programmed cell death through a TRPV1-dependent
  pathway that engages p53. B, stimulation of melanogenesis by endocannabinoids (triangles)
  via CB1 receptors can be a faster alternative compared with the classical route
  activated by α-MSH. In fact, the latter pathway requires proopiomelanocortin (POMC)
  expression and cleavage into an ACTH intermediate, which then matures into the final
  signaling molecule, α-MSH. Both routes might be triggered in keratinocytes by UV
  light or other stress factors to stimulate production by melanocytes of the protective
  agent melanin. β-LPH, β-lipotropic hormone.
