caption: Schematic diagram of EBV early protein BFRF1 inhibiting RLR-mediated IFN-β
  signaling pathway. RNA helicase RIG-I is activated by upstream stimulation, which
  signals through IPS-1 to activate the kinases TBK1 and IKKi, then TBK1/IKKi complex
  phosphorylates IRF3, this leads to the induction of phosphorylation, dimerization,
  and the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and subsequent IFN-I production. In this study,
  EBV-encoded early lytic protein BFRF1 is shown to repress IFN-β transcriptional
  activity by interacting with IKKi to inhibit the phosphorylation, dimerization,
  and nuclear accumulation of IRF3. The red line (↕) shows that BFRF1 interacts with
  IKKi, and red line (T) shows that BFRF1 suppresses the phosphorylation, dimerization,
  and nuclear translocation of IRF3.
