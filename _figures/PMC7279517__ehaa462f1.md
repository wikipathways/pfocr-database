caption: 'Life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and potential medical countermeasures. The positive-sense
  RNA genome of SARS-CoV2 is encapsulated in a viral envelope studded with four viral
  structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N).
  SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into the host cell via binding of the S protein to the cellular
  receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Spike glycoprotein rearrangement
  that primes fusion of viral and host membranes is driven by host proteases (TMPRSS2,
  cathepsins, HAT, furin, etc.), after which the genome is deposited into the cytoplasm
  and translation of ORF1a/b ensues. The polyproteins generated from ORF1a/b are cleaved
  by viral proteases liberating 16 non-structural proteins that guide virus replication.
  The replication complex is formed on double membrane vesicles, creating both genome-length
  RNA as well as subgenomic RNAs that encode structure genes S, E, M, and N as well
  as accessory ORFs that probably play roles in modulating the host response. New
  virus particles are assembled on membranes derived from the ER–Golgi complex and
  then transported out of the cell via the secretory pathway. Medical countermeasures
  are shown in italics adjacent to the viral function they are thought to attack.
  Convalescent sera and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies should inhibit virus binding
  to ACE2 and entry. Chloroquine is thought to interrupt entry and/or egress. Protease
  inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir are thought to prevent polyprotein proteolysis.
  Nucleoside analogues such as remdesivir and ribavirin are thought to prevent viral
  RNA synthesis. *Interferons induce the expression of antiviral and immunomodulatory
  genes that could affect multiple aspects of the virus replication cycle HCQ/CQ,
  hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine.'
