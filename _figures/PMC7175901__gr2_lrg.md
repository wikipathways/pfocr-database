caption: Pathway of melanogenesis.In melanin production, tyrosinase (TYR) is a rate-limiting
  enzyme that converts l-tyrosine to l-DOPA, and subsequently, to dopaquinone. In
  the absence of l-cysteine, dopaquinone is finally converted to eumelanin. TYRP1
  and TYRP2 (DCT) are tyrosinase-related proteins that contribute to the processes
  of eumelanin synthesis. Pheomelanin is synthesized under the presence of l-cysteine
  via several precursors.
