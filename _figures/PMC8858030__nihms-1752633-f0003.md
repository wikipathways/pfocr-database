caption: (Upper panel) In gas cluster ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry (GCIB-SIMS),
  clusters containing many thousands of ionized gas molecules (e.g., [CO2]n+, where
  n>10,000) are a fired at high velocity (primary ion beam) to liberate molecular
  ions from the surface of a frozen sample (e.g., a cell). These molecular ions are
  then extracted and focused into a secondary ion beam that travels into the detector.
  The primary ion beam is focused into a small spot (e.g., 1 μm × 1 μm × 400 nm) and
  raster scanned at different depths across the sample to create a 3D “image” where
  each voxel corresponds to a mass spectrum. (Lower panel) Pareek et al. used this
  technology to directly visualize the substrate-channeling behavior of the purinosome,
  a multi-enzyme condensate that controls de novo purine biosynthesis, in HeLa cells
  []. Based on their studies, the authors were ultimately able to conclude that active
  purinosomes comprise all 9 enzymes responsible for catalyzing the 14-step synthesis
  of AMP and GMP from PRPP in a highly channeled process, insulated from the bulk
  cytosol, and that localization near mitochondria further allows purinosomes to effectively
  channel necessary cofactors, produced via mitochondrial metabolism, directly into
  the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
