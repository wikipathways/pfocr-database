caption: Effect of plant-diet on the gut microbiome and intestinal homeostasis. A
  diet rich in plant-based foods results in high abundance of short-chain fatty acid
  (SCFA) producing bacteria in the gut lumen. High production of SCFAs by gut microbiome
  is strongly associated with pathogen suppression, mucus production, improved barrier
  function and immune tolerance (see Molecular Mechanisms of the Role of Plant-Based
  Diet in Cancer Protection). SCFAs induce a set of anti-inflammatory events via interaction
  with GPR41, GPR43, GPR109A receptors and MCT and SLC5A8 transporters that are expressed
  on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells. 1) SCFAs bind GPR109A
  on the epithelial cell which leads to increase in TGF- β production, enhancing the
  differentiation of Treg cells, which leads to increase of immune tolerance in the
  gut. 2) SCFAs also bind to GPR43 inhibiting HDAC and NF- κB, resulting in decreased
  inflammation. 3) SCFAs bind to GPR41, inhibiting HDAC and MAPK signaling pathway,
  resulting in inhibition of proliferation. 4) SCFAs cross the epithelial cell barrier
  and reach lamina propria, where they induce cascade of anti-inflammatory reactions,
  regulating immune homeostasis in the lower bowel. In the lamina propria, SCFAs bind
  to macrophage (MQ cell) inhibiting HDAC, facilitating polarization of macrophages
  to M2-anti-inflammatory type, and increasing production of antimicrobial peptides
  (AMPs). 5) SCFAs bind to dendritic (DC) cell enhancing retinoic acid production,
  further facilitating production immunoglobulin A (IgA) and differentiation of Tregs.
  6) SCFAs induce production of TGF- β and retinoic acid, causing B cells to stimulate
  production of IgA and facilitate plasma B cell differentiation. 7) SCFAs bind to
  GPR on T cells, initiating the production of IL-10, which increases Tregs pool,
  and inhibits expansion of T helper (Th) 17.
