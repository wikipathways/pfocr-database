caption: (A) Farnesol or related isoperinoids regulate Ras farnesylation and other
  GTPases like Rho and Ras, resulting in GTPase activation and p53-mediated induction
  of apoptosis and cell growth regulation. (B) Inhibition of squalene synthase (SQS)
  decreases raft-associated cholesterol levels, thus attenuates cancer cell proliferation
  and also induces death of cancer cell. (C) Suppression of cholesterol biosynthesis
  from lanosterol leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression and also cell differentiation.
  (D) AEBS ligands are associated with zymosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol, which
  can induce cancer cell differentiation and death through the production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and oxysterols. Suppression of ROS production by antioxidants
  leads to cell survival through an autophagic process by induction of AEBS ligands.
  (E) Cholesteryl esters of fatty acids (CEFA) is the product of intracellular cholesterol
  esterification that is catalyzed by the Acyl-coA:Cholesterol Acyl Transferase (ACAT)
  using cholesterol and fatty acyl-coenzyme A esters (RCoA). CEFA is the major lipid
  found in foam cells which plays important role in atherosclerosis. CEFA is also
  implicated in the stimulation of cancer cell proliferation, invasiveness and mitogenesis.
