caption: Regulation of cell movement and proliferation by nectins and Necl-5. (A)
  Necl-5, integrin αvβ3 and PDGF receptor form a complex at the leading edge of a
  moving cell and enhance cell movement by inducing c-Src and Rap1 activation, which
  leads to the activation of Rac together with the inhibition of RhoA. The ternary
  complex also enhances cell proliferation by inducing the activation of the Ras-mediated
  signalling pathway through inhibiting Necl-5-associated sprouty2 (Spry2). At this
  stage, nectins and cadherins are sparsely distributed on the cell surface. (B) The
  initial cell–cell contact is formed by the trans-interaction of nectin-3 with Necl-5.
  At this stage, the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton starts with the activation
  of Cdc42 and Rac. (C) The trans-interaction of nectin-3 with Necl-5 is transient,
  and Necl-5 is subsequently downregulated from the cell surface by endocytosis. Next,
  trans-interaction of nectins occurs. (D) Cadherins are recruited to nectin-based
  cell–cell adhesion sites and homophilically interact in trans to form adherens junctions
  (AJs). At this stage, integrin αvβ3 becomes inactive by the action of trans-interacting
  nectins. Due to the downregulation of Necl-5 from the cell surface, Spry2 is released
  from Necl-5 and is tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src and becomes active to inhibit
  the Ras-mediated cell proliferation signals. The intracellular signalling mediated
  by integrin αvβ3 and PDGF receptor is then suppressed, resulting in the inhibition
  of cell movement and proliferation (contact inhibition).

  description: Regulation of cell movement and proliferation by nectins and Necl-5.
    (A) Necl-5, integrin αvβ3 and PDGF receptor form a complex at the leading edge

    which leads to the activation of Rac together with the inhibition of RhoA. The
