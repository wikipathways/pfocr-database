caption: Potential mechanisms of NaCl stress mitigation by application of exogenous
  NO. Excessive NaCl causes osmotic and oxidative stresses in plants. Salt stress
  induces ABA accumulation, which promotes H2O2 generation through NAD(P)H oxidase.
  Stress-induced H2O2 triggers generation of endogenous NO by activating NR (nitrate
  reductase) and NOS (nitric oxide synthase)-like enzymes. Exogenous application of
  NO to plants may enhance the biosynthesis of endogenous NO, as well as that of antioxidant
  enzymes through MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and other unknown signaling
  pathways. Exogenous NO supplementation to plants can also up-regulate genes involved
  in proline synthesis, such as P5CS1, and other stress-related genes responsible
  for NaCl tolerance, whereas it might down-regulate ProDH that is involved in proline
  catabolism. Exogenous NO treatment may also help balance osmotic homeostasis in
  plants under salt stress via the SOS (salt overly sensitive) pathway, by increasing
  plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity. APX, ascorbate peroxidase; AsA, ascorbic acid;
  CAT, catalase; GR, glutathione reductase; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; P5CS1, δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
