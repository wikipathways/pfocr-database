caption: Related polyketide pigment pathways that synthesize T4HN, AT4HN, and/or YWA1
  in W. dermatitidis (A), C. lagenarium (B), A. fumigatus (C), and A. nidulans (D).
  Early PKSp enzymes for these fungi are designated WdPks1p, PKS1p, Alb1p, and WAp,
  respectively. The enzymes that convert AT4HN and YWA1 to T4HN are named WdYg1p in
  W. dermatitidis and Ayg1p in A. fumigatus. Chemical structures for the metabolites
  depicted are shown in Fig. . Note that A. fumigatus reportedly makes melanin from
  YWA1 via two pathways, as shown in panel C, and that AT4HN may similarly contribute
  to melanin production in W. dermatitidis via two pathways, as shown in panel A.
