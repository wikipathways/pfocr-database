caption: Patient tumors are exome sequenced and treatment is stratified based upon
  the mutational profile of each individual. Treatment options include novel pharmacological
  compounds to specifically inhibit driver oncogenes, and/or targeting the main downstream
  hyper-activated pro-proliferative signaling pathway, for example inhibition of MEK.
