caption: Spontaneous autophosphorylation of EGFR mutants may lead to transforming
  growth factor beta (TGFβ) activation to induce a lymphocyte depleted tumour microenvironment
  (TME). Tumour-associated EGFR mutations generate spontaneous autophosphorylation
  of tyrosine residues that facilitate downstream proliferation and survival signalling
  pathways. These include the RAS/RAF kinase which mediates the phosphorylation and
  subsequent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) cascade
  which in turn activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). In addition,
  these downstream signalling pathways also include a sustained activation of the
  phospholipase C (PLC) signalling pathway. The activation of the PLC signalling pathway
  induces the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt cascade as well as the activation
  protein kinase C (PKC), which leads to “inside out” activation of integrin complexes,
  locally inducing the convertion of latent TGFβ into released bio-active TGFβ. The
  dashed lines in the illustration represent the proposed mechanism leading to TME
  immune-suppression. According to the proposed mechanism, the bio-active form of
  TGFβ released within the TME could potentially exert numerous effects, for instance,
  leading to the generation of a “lymphocyte depleted” immune suppressive tumour microenvironment
  via exclusion of tumour killing CD8 T-cells, either directly or indirectly by acting
  on Tregs.
