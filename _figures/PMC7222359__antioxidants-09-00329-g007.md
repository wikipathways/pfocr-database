caption: Graphical representation of Prdx6 in the regulation of mechanism related
  to aging and sarcopenia. In skeletal muscle of Prdx6-/- mice, the related impairment
  in muscle mass turnover depending on the alteration of IGF-1/Akt-1/mTOR/FOXO1 signaling
  pathway has been described. Moreover, the inhibition of SIRT1 nuclear translocation
  and activation with subsequent reduction in telomeres length and the activation
  of the p53/p21 pro-aging pathway has been detected. The illustration was performed
  by using Bio Render and Photoshop programs.
