caption: Proposed model of the major ABA signaling pathway. PYR/PYL/RCAR, PP2C and
  SnRK2 form a signaling complex referred to as the ‘ABA signalosome’. (A) Under normal
  conditions, PP2C negatively regulates SnRK2 by direct interactions and dephosphorylation
  of multiple residues of SnRK2. Once abiotic stresses or developmental cues up-regulate
  endogenous ABA, PYR/PYL/RCAR binds ABA and interacts with PP2C to inhibit protein
  phosphatase activity. In turn, SnRK2 is released from PP2C-dependent regulation
  and activated to phosphorylate downstream factors, such as the AREB/ABF bZIP-type
  transcription factor or membrane proteins involving ion channels. (B) In contrast,
  the abi1-1-type mutated protein lacks PYR/PYL/RCAR binding, resulting in the constitutive
  inactivation of SnRK2, even in the presence of ABA, and strong insensitivity to
  ABA in the abi1-1 mutant.
