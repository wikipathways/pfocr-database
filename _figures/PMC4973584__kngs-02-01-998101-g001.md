caption: Model showing the potential role of Lmx1b and miR135a2 in modulating the
  Wnt pathway and influencing midbrain size, mDA progenitor specification and neurogenesis.
  The transcription factor Lmx1b, directly or indirectly, drives Wnt1/Wnt signaling
  and the Rmst/miR135a2 transcriptional unit. miR135a2, on the other hand, represses
  Lmx1b and Wnt pathway targets, among other factors. Thus, the levels of this transcription
  factor-microRNA pair influence the net levels of Wnt1/Wnt signaling during midbrain
  development, impacting overall size, patterning and expansion of the mDA progenitor
  pool, at least in part via modulation of downstream transcription factors like Lmx1a.
