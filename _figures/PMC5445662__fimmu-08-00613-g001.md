caption: 'The intracellular signaling pathways associated with IR-induced cell death
  modalities. IR induces cellular apoptosis by activating both the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway (through proapoptotic proteins-mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
  (MOMP)-Cytochrome c/SMAC/DIABLO release-caspase activation) and the extrinsic apoptotic
  pathway (through the upregulation of death receptors and the activation of downstream
  caspases). p53 also induces the expression of p53-inducible death domain (PIDD)
  protein in response to ionizing radiation, which acts as an effector of p53-dependent
  apoptosis. In addition, activated ATM following IR may activate the NF-κB pathway
  that in turn induces apoptosis. IR also leads to persistent DNA damages, which induce
  to p53 activation and p21 upregulation. p21 mediates cell cycle arrest and cellular
  senescence. Following IR, both activated ATM and p53 may trigger autophagic cell
  death to cells. ATM can activate AMPK and PTEN that suppress mTOR complex and induce
  autophagy. In addition, p53 upregulates the expression of autophagy-initiating kinase
  ULK1 and ULK2 and the damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM) that subsequently
  induce autophagy. Note that it is still not certain whether this IR-induced autophagy
  would systematically lead to autophagic cell death. How IR induces necroptosis is
  still not fully understood. Some studies suggest that, in absence of caspase 8 activation,
  activated ATM following DNA damages (such as those induced by alkylating agent treatment)
  might mediate necroptosis by activating RIPK1 and RIPK3. See the main text for details.
