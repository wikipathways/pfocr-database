caption: Immunologic response to uricase-based biologics in the presence and absence
  of immunomodulation [, , –]. (a) Uricase antigen uptake facilitates dendritic cell
  (DC) differentiation and maturation. In response to antigen presentation by DCs,
  T cells facilitate B-cell antidrug antibody production, followed by neutralization
  and proteolysis of uricase. (b) Exposure to a co-formulated system (e.g., PEGylated
  uricase enzyme encapsulated with SVP-rapamycin) induces DC tolerization to PEGylated
  uricase antigen. Tolerogenic DCs facilitate the production of anergic (or regulatory)
  T cells, dampening immunogenicity and prolonging PEGylated uricase activity. (c)
  Exposure to a PEGylated uricase enzyme with immunomodulation (IMM) co-therapy (e.g.,
  oral methotrexate) increases T-cell sensitivity to apoptosis, disrupting the pathway
  to immunogenicity. Figure adapted from Brunn et al. 2021 []. Molecular images of
  uricase and PEGylated uricase enzymes are not representative of molecule shape or
  structure and are for illustration purposes only
