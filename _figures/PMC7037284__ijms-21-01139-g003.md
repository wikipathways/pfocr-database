caption: Effects of altered gravity on cGMP signaling in melanocytes and non-metastatic
  and metastatic melanoma cells. (A) cGMP signaling under hypergravity condition (black
  color). Hypergravity induces an increase in sGCβ1-MRP4/MRP5-dependent cGMP efflux
  as well as in melanin content in human melanocytes/non-metastatic melanoma cells
  (NMMCs). The expression of iNOS/GC-A/GC-B expression in NMMCs and expression of
  e/iNOS/GC-A/GC-B/MRP4/MRP5 in metastatic melanoma cells (MMCs) were not altered.
  (B) cGMP signaling under simulated microgravity conditions (red color). Simulated
  microgravity down-regulates the eNOS-sGCβ1-MRP4/MRP5 pathway in NMMCs as well as
  the expression of e/iNOS, GC-A/GC-B/PKG/MRP5, and motility of highly metastatic
  melanoma cells (MMCs). The expression of iNOS/PKGI/PDE5A/Tyr in NMMCs was not altered
  under simulated microgravity condition.
