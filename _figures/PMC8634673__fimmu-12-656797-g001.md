caption: Immunopathobiology of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. (A) EBV is transmitted
  to the host through saliva from a carrier individual, and infects pharyngeal epithelial
  cells followed by naïve tonsillar B cells through interactions between gp350 and
  gp42 glycoproteins of the viral envelope with CD21 and MHC class II molecules (MHC-II),
  respectively. Lytic infection produces new viral particles that infect more epithelial
  cells. Subsequently, these EBV-infected B cells enter into a latency phase in the
  periphery, where they express a specific set of viral genes, including LMP1, LMP2A,
  EBNAs and EBER (latency III). These latent III B cells progress through the germinal
  center reaction into latency II and emerge as memory B cells with I/0 latencies
  that establish a lifelong latent infection. The immune response of the healthy host
  is sufficient to maintain control of the EBV infection. NK cells in tonsil produce
  high levels of IFN-γ that withhold the transformation of B cells by EBV during earlier
  stages of the infection. Both, type III and type II latent B cells are controlled
  by NK and T cells specific to latent proteins. By contrast, memory B cells with
  type I latency are only controlled by activated EBNA-1 specific CD4 T cells. EBV-infected
  plasma cells can periodically enter in lytic phase, but are controlled by CD4 and
  CD8 T cells with specificity for EBV lytic proteins. The programs of the viral latent
  cycle are expressed in various EBV-associated diseases. Latency I is found in Burkitt
  lymphoma, latency II in Hodgkin lymphoma and latency III in post-transplantation
  lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) and AIDS-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
  (DLBCL). EBV-latency I B cells escaping the surveillance of EBNA-1-specific CD4
  T cells could lead to autoimmunity by presenting EBNA-1 in MHC-II/gp42, which may
  cause cross-reaction with own antigens. (B) EBNA1 is presented to CD4 T cells on
  MHC class II molecules in EBV-infected B cells. Both, MHC-II bound gp42 and soluble
  gp42 facilitate immune evasion by preventing activation and recognition of T cell
  receptors (TCR) in CD4 T cells. In addition, some EBV miRNAs could directly reduce
  CD4 T cell cytotoxicity through the intercellular exosomal pathway or inhibit MHC
  class II-mediated antigen processing and presentation in the host cell. By contrast,
  activation of Th1 CD4 T cells, would favor co-stimulation of CD8 T cells, NK cells
  and macrophages. Increased levels of IFN-γ in response to EBV infection can induce
  expression of MHC class II molecules in other cells such as epithelial cells, endothelial
  cells, pancreatic beta cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes and glial cells, allowing
  them to act as non-professional antigen-presenting cells that can become infected
  by EBV through gp42/MHC-II interaction. If these cells also express low levels of
  CD21 (thymocytes, a subset of peripheral T lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells,
  astrocytes and some epithelial cells), they may further facilitate EBV entry by
  interacting gp350 with CD21. IFN-γ released by NK cells may withhold the transformation
  of B cells by EBV during the early stages of infection, but it fails to inhibit
  the proliferation of fully transformed EBV-infected B cells (latency). CD8 T cells
  do not recognize EBNA1 in EBV-transformed cells, since it is presented in MHC class
  II molecules. Only EBNA1-specific CD4 T cells have cytotoxic activity against EBNA1-expressing
  B cells, causing them to enter apoptosis and become phagocyted by macrophages. However,
  EBV transformed B cells release IL-10, TGF-β, CCL20 and exosomes (containing EBERs
  and CCL20), which attract T regulatory (Treg) cells to the site of infection inhibiting
  antigen-stimulated CD4 effector T cells. IL-10 released by EBV transformed B cells
  during EBNA1 presentation, favors a Th2 (over Th1) immune response that also inhibits
  CD8 T cells and NK cells. These EBNA1 specific Th2 cells further induce antibody
  secretion by plasma cells. EBERs released on exosomes can activate other cells such
  as eosinophils that degranulate and release the cationic eosinophilic protein (ECP).
  (C) EBNA1 is one of the main candidates in the generation of autoantibodies and
  EBNA1 specific self-reactive cytotoxic Th1 cells in genetically predisposed individuals.
  EBNA-1 is subjected to citrullination and presented in MHC class II molecules after
  macroautophagy in EBV-infected B cells. As gp42 binds peripherally to the β1 domain
  of the β chain of HLA-DR -DQ, it may confer greater susceptibility or resistance
  to this interaction, depending on the host DRB1* and DQB1* allele. Post-translational
  modifications, such as citrullination, may form neoantigens that can generate autoimmunity
  when recognized by CD4 T cells. If polarized into a Th2 phenotype, CD4 T cells will
  stimulate B cell differentiation into plasma cells that could secrete autoantibodies.
  Antigen-specific CD4 T cells with a Th1 cytokine pattern may have cytotoxic activity,
  apart from co-stimulating CD8 T cells, NK cells and macrophages. Together with autoantibodies
  produced by plasma cells, all these cell types would participate in the destruction
  of healthy cells and the development of autoimmunity.
