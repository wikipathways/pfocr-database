  The full biosynthetic pathway of lanosterol consists of endogenous and heterologous
  modules; B, Integration of heterologous S. cerevisiae terg9 gene, M. capsulatus
  smo gene with M1-93 artificial promoter into genomic DNA of E. coli MG1655 at the
  mgsA site and pta site, respectively. The M. capsulatus lss gene fused with NusA
  tag was integrated into genomic DNA of E. coli MG1655 at ldhA site with artificial
  promoter M1-12; C, based on b, wrbA gene with M1-93 artificial promoter was integrated
  into genomic DNA of E. coli MG1655 at poxB site. D, based on b, the native promoter
  of dxs was replaced with artificial promoter M1-37. E–F, GC-MS detection of lanosterol
