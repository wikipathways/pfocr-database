caption: Summary of events leading to the generation of cytosolic ROS (R1) and mitochondrial
  ROS (R2). Extra-mitochondrial cytosolic ROS generation occurs following increased
  glucose flux and activity of polyol pathway and AGEs:RAGE interaction and via NADPH
  oxidase system, such as NOX4. The mitochondrial matrix ROS and reactive nitrogen
  species (RNS) are generated via the well-characterized electron transport chain
  Complex I to IV redox carriers localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. During
  hyperglycemia there is an increased donation of electrons (e) by powerful NADH and
  FADH2 reducing agents of respective Complex I and II with pumping of protons (H+)
  into the inter-membrane space, giving rise to an increased mitochondrial membrane
  potential. As a result the electron transport at complex III is inhibited with consequential
  backing up of the system and prolonged half life of free-radical intermediates of
  Coenzyme Q (CoQ), leading to an increase in the reduction of O2 to superoxide (O2·−)
  and production of ROS. The generated ROS/RNS release Cytochrome C, activate caspases
  and induce apoptosis. They also modulate the activity of Ang II, PKC and TGF-β,
  which would ultimately affect the synthesis of ECM. Intriguingly, the PKC and Ang
  II via feedback loop lead to the generation of ROS/RNS (double headed arrow), and
  this sets up a vicious cycle resulting in perpetuation of renal injury.
