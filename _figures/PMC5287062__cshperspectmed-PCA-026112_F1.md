caption: Mechanisms of cellular senescence. DNA damage is caused by multiple means,
  including oncogene activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell division and
  replication, ultraviolet light (UV), and cancer therapies. These signals in turn
  can initiate p53 pathway signaling through increased ATM activity, causing Chk2-mediated
  phosphorylation of p53, which protects p53 from Mdm2-mediated degradation. Additionally,
  oncogene activation can induce ARF and p16 expression, which inhibit Mdm2 and cdk
  function, respectively. The resulting increased p21 and/or Rb activity can result
  in permanent cell-cycle arrest and senescence. Cellular senescence is marked by
  an enlarged, flattened morphology, increased lysosomal compartment, secretion of
  multiple cytokines and chemokines of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
  (SASP), and sometimes formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF).
