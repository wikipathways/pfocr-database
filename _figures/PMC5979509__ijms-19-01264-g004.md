caption: VEGFR2 signal transduction and trafficking pathways mediated by VEGF-A. Schematic
  representation of the signalling pathways elicited by the docking of adaptor proteins
  to major tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of Y951 residue leads to
  the recruitment of TSAd which in turns binds and activates Src. Substrates for Src
  include molecules related to cell adhesion, vascular permeability, and cell survival
  (via PI3K/AKT pathway activation). pY1175 mobilises SHB, which in turn activates
  FAK (cell attachment and migration). SHB is also one of the Src substrates that
  are involved in the activation of PI3K/AKT. Moreover, pY1175 residues recruit PLCγ,
  triggering Ca2+-dependent signalling, which in turn results in transcriptional control
  of proliferation and cell migration. Cell motility is also regulated by the recruitment
  of NCK to pY1214 leading to p38MAPK activation. VEGFR2 activation promotes its own
  internalization with signalling continuing within endosomal compartments. After
  being internalized to RAB5+ sorting endosomes, VEGFR2 can be recycled to the cell
  surface in RAB4+ (fast trafficking, persistent intracellular signalling) or Rab11+
  (slow trafficking, PTP1b-limited intracellular signalling) endosomes. Alternatively,
  VEGFR2 undergoes lysosomal degradation in Rab7+ endosomes. PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ;
  PIP2, phosphatidylinositol biphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol trisphosphate;

  additional elements to them (e.g., other adaptor proteins/non direct signaling routes)
  that have not been included due to space. The solid lines are for a direct signaling
  pathway. The blue arrows refer to the routes through which the receptor trafficked
  for either recycling or degradation.

  description: VEGFR2 signal transduction and trafficking pathways mediated by VEGF-A.
    Schematic representation of the signalling pathways elicited by the docking of

    VEGFR2 can be recycled to the cell surface in RAB4+ (fast trafficking, persistent
