caption: Schematic diagram depicting the possible relationship between ROS, NF-kB,
  and induction of MMP and TIMP following m-β-CoV-RSA59 infection. m-β-CoV-RSA59 induced
  the upregulation of Park7 (Parkinson's disease 7) in the brain of virus-infected
  mice compared with mock samples. Park7 is known to activate NADPH oxidase-dependant
  ROS production. In the downstream of the ROS pathway lies nuclear factor kappa B
  or NF-kB. m-β-CoV-RSA59 infection also upregulated the transcripts of RelA, a subunit
  of NF-kB. The transcription factor NF-kB can induce many inflammation-related genes,
  including MMPs. Additionally, m-β-CoV-RSA59 infection increased mRNAs of nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its dependant heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1)
  genes that are involved in the antioxidative pathway. The numbers indicate mRNA
  fold-change and its regulation (up or down) as detected in RT-qPCR in . Further,
  elevated levels of Timp1 provide for a host homeostatic mechanism to regulate the
  activities of upregulated MMPs.
