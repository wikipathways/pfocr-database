caption: Alteration of host signaling pathways by HIV-1. (A) The binding of HIV-1
  to its receptor and co-receptor triggers the activation of P2Y2 by releasing ATP
  from host cytosol through pannexin-1 (PNX-1). The activated P2Y2 promotes the ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation of NLRP3, facilitating the phosphorylation and activation of PYK-2,
  which subsequently enables the F-actin polymerization required for the fusion and
  entry of HIV-1 into the host cell (not shown). (B) Nef activates NFAT and NF-κB
  via PAK2, which triggers the expression of cytoskeletal remodeling genes. (C) Binding
  of the virus also activates the lipid-associated Lck protein by myristoylation at
  p56. Lck activates the PLC-γ that breaks PIP3 into IP3 and DAG. IP3 triggers the
  opening of calcium channels in the ER and increases the concentration of Ca2+ in
  the cytosol. Increased Ca2+ activates the NFAT signaling. The virally encoded Vpr
  can also trigger the NFAT signaling through Ca2+ efflux and interferes with cGSK3β
  kinase for NFAT export (not shown). On the other hand, DAG via PKC activates the
  MAPK pathway. The NFAT and MAPK then promote the transcription of genes required
  for cytokine production and T-cell proliferation and activation. (D) The gp120-CD4
  and CXCR4/CCR5 interaction upregulates the apoptotic receptor and ligand, Fas/FasL
  expression, which in turn activates the caspase 8 and caspase 3 for apoptosis of
  the infected cell via FADD/TRADD. (E) Additionally, the released viral Tat and Nef
  in the cytoplasm can also upregulate the Fas expression in the plasma membrane and
  can directly act on the caspase 8, promoting apoptosis.
