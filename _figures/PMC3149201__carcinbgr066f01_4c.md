caption: Inhibition of the KAI1 cancer metastasis suppressor pathway in African-American
  patients. KAI1 on tumor cells was shown to interact with DARC on the vascular endothelium,
  leading to metastasis suppression (). Loss of DARC expression on erythrocytes, which
  is common in populations of African ancestry, and reduced DARC expression in tumors
  may compromise this metastasis suppressor pathway. Other mechanisms of KAI1 suppression
  include the loss of KAI1 expression, which is commonly found in many human cancers,
  and overexpression of the autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR or gp78) which
  targets KAI1 for degradation (). AMFR was found to be overexpressed in prostate
  and breast tumors of African-American patients when compared with tumors from European-American
  patients (,,).
