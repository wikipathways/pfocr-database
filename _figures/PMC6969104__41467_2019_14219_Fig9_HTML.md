caption: MUC1-C activates the MYC gene, binds directly to the MYC HLH/LZ domain and
  contributes to induction of MYC target genes, including CDK4 with phosphorylation
  of RB,,. MUC1-C also promotes inactivation of RB by MYC/BMI1-mediated suppression
  of CDKN2A/p16 (ref. ). In the present studies, we found that MUC1-C induces MYC
  occupancy on the BRN2 promoter with induction of BRN2 expression. In turn, BRN2
  induces SOX2 expression. In addition to MYC and SOX2, we show that MUC1-C drives
  KLF4 and OCT4 (OSKM), which are collectively sufficient for inducing pluripotency
  and dedifferentiation of somatic cells. MUC1-C also suppresses the p53 signaling
  pathway and CDKN1A/p21. In addition to MYC, MUC1-C activates the inflammatory TAK1→IKK→NF-κB
  p65 pathway and, by binding directly to NF-κB p65, promotes activation of NF-κB
  p65 target genes, including (i) ZEB1 and thereby EMT and stemness, and (ii) EZH2
  with increases in H3K27me3 (refs. ,). In this way, MUC1-C integrates activation
  of the MYC and NF-κB p65 pathways with suppression of p53 and regulation of the
  RB-E2F axis to drive PC lineage plasticity with dedifferentiation and pluripotency.
