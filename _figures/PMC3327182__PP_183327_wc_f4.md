caption: MapMan overview of regulation showing the regulation (black arrows), protein
  modification (green arrows), regulation of transcription (red arrows), hormones
  (green dotted arrows), enzyme families (black dotted arrows), and transport pathway
  (red dotted arrows) genes that are preferentially expressed in MAMP-treated leaves
  from LD00-2817P (A), LDX01-1-65 (B), Ripley (C), and EF59 (D) genotypes. Individual
  genes are represented by small squares. The log2 (MAMP/mock) values for the differentially
  expressed genes (FDR < 0.05, ≥2-fold difference) were false color coded by using
  a scale of −3 to ±3. The intensity of blue and red colors indicates the degree of
  expression of the corresponding genes in MAMP-treated leaves. Color saturated at
  ±3 (8-fold difference or higher).
