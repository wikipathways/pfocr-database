caption: Schematic depiction of the antiviral RNA silencing pathway with differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) encoding proteins that function in antiviral defence. Genes
  significantly regulated in variety 60444 after inoculation are shown together with
  their mRNA fold change based on RNA‐sequencing (RNA‐seq) analysis. These genes were
  not regulated in variety KBH 18/2006. DCL2, DICER‐LIKE 2; AGO5, ARGONAUTE 5; AGO2,
  ARGONAUTE 2; RDR1, RNA‐DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 1; SGS3, SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING
  3; SDE5, SILENCING DEFECTIVE 5; RISC, RNA‐induced silencing complex.
