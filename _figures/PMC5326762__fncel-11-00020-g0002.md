caption: 'Pathways of HIF-1α and its target genes involved in retinal neuroprotection.
  The upper panel in yellow background is the schematic representation of HIF-1α degradation
  under normoxia. Note that the undegraded HIF-1α binds with HIF-1β to form the HIF-1α/β
  complex. The complex binds to HIF-responsive elements (HREs) in promoters that contain
  the sequence motif 5′-NCGTG-3′ and triggers transcription of more than 100 downstream
  genes. VHL: von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (E3 ubiquitin protein ligase).
  The lower panel in pale blue color represents the HIF-1α target genes and their
  acting pathways involved in retinal neuroprotection under hypoxia. Note that five
  main cellular signaling pathways mediating the effect of neuroprotection are highlighted.
  Firstly, EPO binds to EPO-R to promote ERK-1/2 signaling, and then activate the
  Akt pathway, resulting in cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation,
  and angiogenesis. Also, it can maintain mitochondrial membrane potential to prevent
  mitochondrial alteration. In particular, EPO can be pumped outside the cytoplasm,
  which leads to the autocrine and paracrine effects that further exert retinal neuroprotection.
  Secondly, VEGF, which binds to VEGF-R, can achieve the same effects as EPO through
  activating ERK-1/2 signaling. Simultaneously, it enhances the MEK-1/2 pathway, promoting
  angiogenesis and inhibiting caspase-3 to constrain cell death. Thirdly, the secreted
  multifunctional peptide ADM mainly plays roles in vasomotor regulation, and acts
  together with VEGF to promote angiogenesis. Fourthly, Glut-1 transports glucose
  to the cytoplasm, allowing normal metabolic activity. Fifthly, HO-1 is degraded
  by ARE/EpRE elements. While under hypoxia, HO-1 blunts reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  production and the toxic effect on mitochondria. More importantly, HO-1 retards
  retinal injury through the IRS1/PI3K/Akt2 and Keap1/Nrf2 pathways, which further
  activate mTOR, upregulate anti-apoptotic proteins, and eliminate ROS.'
