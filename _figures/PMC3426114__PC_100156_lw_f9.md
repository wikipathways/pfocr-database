caption: Two Possible Models Regarding the Role of CDT1 Proteins in Response to DNA
  Stress.(A) Downregulation of CDT1 upon DNA stress may be promoted by WEE1 and/or
  SOG1. This would result in a delay in S-phase progression, but how this would induce
  endoreduplication remains unclear.(B) CDT1 proteins, possibly via their ability
  to form complexes with DNA polymerase ε, may be at the top of a signaling pathway
  that could regulate cell cycle progression and endoreduplication in parallel with
  the WEE1- and SOG1-dependent pathway.
