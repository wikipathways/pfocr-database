caption: A model for the selective upregulation of Mcl-1 and HSP27 during HCMV infection
  of monocytes. HCMV gB binding to EGFR and gH binding to αvβ3 trigger the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. In addition, cross talk from the gH/αVβ3/Src signaling cascade contributes
  to the activation of EGFR, leading to Akt activity exhibiting a virus-directed substrate
  specificity. The induction of unknown transcription factors stimulates the transcription
  of Mcl-1 and HSP27. Concomitantly, HCMV-activated Akt rapidly phosphorylates mTOR
  to drive the translation of Mcl-1 and HSP27. The rapid synthesis of Mcl-1 and HSP27
  blocks the two proteolytic cleavages necessary for the formation of fully activated
  caspase 3 prior to the 48-h viability gate, thus allowing for the survival and differentiation
  of infected monocytes.
