caption: Transcription_P53 signaling pathway. It is the second highest scoring map
  (i.e., the map with the second lowest p-value). The Tumor protein p53, also known
  as p53 ortransformation-related protein 53 (TRP53), plays a significant role in
  shielding the genome integrity. While being activated, p53 will bind to the enhancer/promoter
  regions of downstream target genes. And then it regulates the transcription of these
  genes, through which it initiates cellular processes that responsible for lots of
  its tumor-suppressor related functions. It is not surprising that core network of
  4 cancers are related to the p53 signaling pathway.
