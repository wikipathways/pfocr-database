caption: A, chemical signalling between cone and cone horizontal cell (cHC) and electrical
  signalling between cone and rod are shown. Cones release the transmitter glutamate
  (Glu) to signal cHCs. In addition, cones and rods can electrically signal each other
  via rod-cone gap junctions, which are open at night in the dark and closed in the
  day in the dark and in the light. Both rods and cones express dopamine D4 receptors
  (D4Rs) and cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) although this is illustrated just for
  cones. Note also that we refer to ‘cone D4Rs’ and ‘cone CB1Rs’ throughout this paper
  as a shorthand for both rods and cones. B, schematic shows that endogenous activation
  of cone CB1Rs increases cAMP/PKA and rod-cone coupling via a Gs signal (shown in
  red) at night when cone D4Rs are not activated, but decreases cAMP/PKA and rod-cone
  coupling via a Gi/o protein signal (shown in red) in the day due to activation of
  cone D4Rs. Previous work has shown that a circadian clock in the retina decreases
  the release of dopamine from dopaminergic amacrine cells (not shown) sufficiently
  at night so that D4Rs on photoreceptor cells are not activated. In contrast, the
  retinal clock increases dopamine release in the day, resulting in volume diffusion
  of dopamine throughout the retina and activation of D4Rs on rods and cones. This
  decreases intracellular cAMP and PKA activity levels in photoreceptors, which lowers
  the conductance of rod-cone gap junctions so that rod input to cones is reduced.
  The diagram also shows a cannabinoid pathway that is parallel to and dependent on
  the dopamine system. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
