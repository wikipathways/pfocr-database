caption: Schematic representation of the signaling cascade activated by the CaSR that
  induces the arrival of ZO-2 to TJs. The presence of calcium in the extracellular
  media or of Gd3+ activates the CaSR present in the plasma membrane, which subsequently
  activates the Gαq/11 subunit that turns on a signaling cascade that leads to the
  activation of nPKCε. This kinase phosphorylates WNK4, which in turn phosphorylates
  ZO-2 triggering its disassembly from 14-3-3 and relocation to TJs. Residue S261
  of ZO-2, located within a NLS, binds to 14-3-3σ and ζ and facilitates the importation
  of ZO-2 into the nucleus. Red lines, signaling pathway that leads to ZO-2 recruitment
  to the cell borders; blue lines, effect of drugs used in this study.

  cascade induces incorporation of ZO-2 to tight junctions and its separation from
  14-3-3.
