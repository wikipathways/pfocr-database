caption: A model for Upc2p and Ecm22p regulation. Sterol depletion and the ECM22-1
  mutation caused decreased promoter occupancy by Ecm22p but increased transcriptional
  activation. In contrast, low sterol levels caused increases in Upc2p protein levels,
  an increase in the probability of each protein to be at a promoter, and greater
  potency of each bound Upc2p.
