caption: 'The HER receptor and pathway: (A) there are four members of the HER family
  of RTKs: EGFR/HER1, HER2, 3, and 4. Each HER receptor is composed of four functional
  extracellular domains (domain I, II, III, and IV) as well as a tyrosine rich (Tyr)
  intracellular domain. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), amphiregulin (AREG), heparin
  binding EGF (HB-EGF), and heregulin 1, 2, 3, 4 growth factor-ligands bind to domains
  II and III of EGFR/HER1 and HER3, HER4, respectively. Growth factor-ligand binding
  initiates HER conformational rearrangement causing exposure of the dimerization
  domain (DD), which is sandwiched between domains II and IV, as well as allowing
  the closed conformation of the HER receptor (portrayed by EGFR/HER1, HER3, 4) to
  assume an open conformation (displayed by HER2). It is important to note the truncated
  intracellular domain of HER3, which lacks kinase activity therefore, the HER3 receptor
  is the kinase dead member of the HER family of RTKs. (B) Ligand-mediated exposure
  of the dimerization domain enables the binding of two like HER receptors to form
  a homo-dimer (left, EGFR–EGFR) or two different HER receptors to form a hetero-dimer
  (right, HER2–HER3). It is important to note that the HER2 receptor is in a fixed,
  open conformation and does not require ligand binding to dimerize with a ligand
  bound HER receptor. (C) Upon HER dimerization, the HER receptors undergo auto-phosphorylation
  of their intracellular tyrosine residues. Auto-phosphorylation of the HER receptors
  primes the receptors to transphosphorylate the tyrosine residues of their binding
  partners (D) in preparation to initiate activation of downstream targets (E) activated
  HER receptors initiate the AKT (left) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  (right) pathways through a series of residue targeted phosphorylations, or a phosphorylation
  cascade. The Src homology domain 2 (SH2) of p85 (regulatory domain of PI3K) docks
  to the phosphotyrosine residue of the activated HER receptor (EGFR). p85 docking
  to EGFR enables Src homology domain 3 (SH3) of p110 (catalytic domain of PI3K) to
  join the proline rich region (Pro) of p85 to initiate PI3K 3′ phosphorylation of
  phosphatidylinositol (4, 5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) transforming PIP2 into phosphatidylinositol
  (3, 4, 5)-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 phosphorylation is aided by the Plekstrin homology
  domain (PHD) within the catalytic domain of phosphoinositide dependent kinase-1
  (PDK1). The lipid binding PH domain recruits AKT to the plasma membrane where it
  docks to PIP3 as the physical interactions and activations of PI3K, PTEN, PDK1,
  as well as AKT occurs at the surface of the cell. PDK1 is able to phosphorylate
  AKT at the Thr 308 residue as well as aid in PKCa activation. AKT phosphorylation
  disrupts the formation of the tuberous sclerosis 1/2 (TSC 1/2) dimer, inhibits hydrolyzation
  of the GTP binding protein, Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), to activate the
  mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) complex as well as the mTORC2 complex.
  The mTORC1 complex is composed of: G protein beta subunit-like (GβL), the metabolically
  sensitive regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Rptor), DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting
  protein (DEPTOR), and the serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR). The fully formed mTORC1 complex is able to promote cell growth, proliferation,
  and autophagy by directing protein translation by mediating the ability of Rptor
  to recruit the formation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F complex [eIF4F (eIF4E,
  G, B, etc.)] and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1). The mTORC2 complex is
  also involved in cellular metabolism but mainly facilitates fluctuations in cytoskeletal
  formation and degradation throughout the cell via serum and glucocorticoid-regulated
  kinase 1 (SGK1), for instance. In a similar fashion, the SH2 domain of growth factor
  receptor bound-2 (Grb2) protein docks to the phosphotyrosine residue of the activated
  HER receptor (HER2). SH2 interaction with the Grb2 scaffold protein initiates the
  binding of two SH3 domains to the proline rich region of the son of sevenless (SOS)
  protein. SOS is a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that acts on Ras-GTPases
  (Ras-GDP) (rat sarcoma). SOS facilitates the unbinding of guanosine diphosphate
  (GDP) from Ras, there by destabilizing Ras and enabling guanosine triphosphate (GTP)
  binding to form Ras-GTP, and initiate the MAPK phosphorylation cascade. A GTPase
  activating protein (GAP) hydrolyzes Ras bound GTP (Ras-GTP), forming GDP, and halting
  downstream phosphorylation of the MAPK pathway. Ras activation begins the MAPK phosphorylation
  cascade, which is a series of serine/threoinine specific protein kinases occurring
  on: rapidly accelerating fibrosarcoma/mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase
  (Raf/MAPKKK), mitogen/extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen activated protein
  kinase kinase (MEK/MAPKK), and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2/mitogen activated
  protein kinase (Erk1/2/MAPK). Activation of the MAPK pathway initiates the transcription
  of a host of genes including: c-Myc, c-Fos, and cyclins to orchestrate cell motility,
  invasiveness, and proliferation.'
