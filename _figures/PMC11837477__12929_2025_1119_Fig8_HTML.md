caption: 'The EGFR role in brain development. This image shows the different roles
  of EGFR in the brain, including neurogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases and
  glioblastoma development. A–C EGFR regulation: A The interplay between EGFR and
  Notch signaling regulates the balance between NSC and NPC. EGFR reprimes Notch through
  Numb expression, which interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases degrading Notch and promoting
  NPC proliferation and expansion. B EGFR regulates the expression of SOX2 that, in
  turn, binds with EGFR promoter leading to EGFR expression and signaling activation.
  C SHH promotes transactivation of EGFR influencing NPC pool proliferation. D–F EGFR
  in brain injuries: D Kainic Acid (KA) treatment and E HB-EGF ligand and zinc induce
  EGFR expression and MAPK-ERK signaling activation, resulting in the differentiation
  of NCP into reactive neural stem cells (React-NSCs) that contribute to astrocytes
  formation, impairing neurogenesis. F On the contrary, EGFR inhibition preserves
  NSC pool, stimulating the neurogenesis process through the migration of neurons
  towards injured regions and generation of new neurons. G EGFR role in neurodegenerative
  diseases: Pharmacological inhibition of EGFR leads to the decrease of oxidative
  stress and inflammation and to the increase of the autophagy process involved in
  the reduction of peptides accumulation. H EGFR role in glioblastoma: the inhibition
  of EGFR affects the downstream signaling pathway activation, decreasing the levels
  of pro-inflammatory chemokines, such as CCL2 levels, and the infiltration of tumor-associated
  macrophages involved in the glioblastoma development'
