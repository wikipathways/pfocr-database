caption: Nutrient oxidation in the mitochondria modulates adipogenesis. Branched-chain
  amino acids (BCAAs) and glucose catabolism within the mitochondria produce ATP and
  metabolic intermediates that promote adipogenesis. As such, leucine catabolism is
  an early regulator of adipogenesis that is initiated by a BCAA transaminase (BCAT)
  generating α-ketoisocaproic acid (a-KIC). a-KIC is irreversibly oxidized by the
  BCAA dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex forming isovaleryl-CoA. Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase
  (IVD) converts isovaleryl-CoA to methylcrotonyl-CoA. Sirtuin SIRT4 induction of
  methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCCC1) promotes the carboxylation of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA
  to 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, which can be further oxidized to produce acetyl-CoA.
  BCAA catabolism promotes the PPARγ-mediated transcriptional adipogenic program.
  While a portion of glucose is oxidized to generate acetyl-CoA, some glucose is diverted
  away from the mitochondrial oxidation to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to
  support the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), a
  required cofactor for lipogenesis. Glutaminolysis appears to oppose adipogenesis,
  although the mechanistic understanding of fuel switching that supports adipogenesis
  is limited.
