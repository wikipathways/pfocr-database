caption: Monolignol and ethylene biosynthesis pathways. Molecules and enzymes of the
  pathways are indicated. Met methionine; SAM S-adenosylmethionine; ACC 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
  acid; ACS ACC-synthase, ACO ACC-oxidase; Phe phenylalanine, PAL phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; C4H cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; C3H coumarate 3-hydroxylase; HCT hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; 4CL 4-coumarate ligase; CAD cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; CSE caffeoyl
  shikimate esterase; CCoAOMT caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase; CCR cinnamoyl CoA
  reductase; COMT caffeate O-methyltransferase; F5H ferulate 5-hydroxylase. Ethylene
  influences the activity of PAL (indicated as a lightning bold) and thereby affects
  monolignol biosynthesis. The enzyme CSE together with 4CL bypasses the second HCT
  reaction and appears to be important in the lignin biosynthetic pathway of M. truncatula
