caption: Summary of molecular basis on which epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) prevents
  chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal fibrosis based on preclinical evidence. The
  anti–oxidative stress properties of EGCG are exerted through its inhibition of mitochondrial
  dysfunction and its induction of antioxidant enzymes via activation of the Nrf2/HO-1
  signaling pathway. For its anti-inflammation property, EGCG inhibits NF-κB signaling
  and inflammasome formation resulting in inhibition of the inflammatory cascade.
  Moreover, EGCG exhibits an anti-EMT property through various signaling pathways,
  including TGF-β1/Smad, β-catenin, and Nrf2 pathways, to prevent fibrotic transdifferentiation
  by the EMT process. Shaded boxes (in light orange) represent molecular events that
  occur in CKD, which can be inhibited or prevented by EGCG. ARE, antioxidant responsive
