caption: EGFR has been shown to be able to directly phosphorylate PCNA at Y211. The
  current study demonstrates a new pathway in which stimulation of the Ron receptor
  induces Y211 phosphorylation through activation of c-Abl which subsequently catalyzes
  phosphorylation of PCNA at Y211. Given the fact that Ron, EGFR, and c-Abl are important
  targets in cancer therapy, combined inhibition of phospho-Y211 PCNA may be an efficient
  approach to enhance sensitivity and help overcome drug resistance.
