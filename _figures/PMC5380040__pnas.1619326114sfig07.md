caption: A proposed scheme of LM regulation during the reproductive cycle of female
  A. aegypti mosquitoes. The expression of LM genes was repressed by the HNF4-mediated
  JH/Met pathway during the PE phase and was activated through the HNF4-mediated 20E/EcR
  pathway as well as by amino acid/TOR signaling pathway during the PBM phase.
