caption: 'Interaction between PKCε and STAT3Ser727 in nociceptive regulation during
  inflammatory pain. PKCε and STAT3 engaged with IL-6-mediated neuronal and glial
  cell crosstalk during inflammatory nociceptive transmission. Under inflammatory
  conditions, upregulated PKCε and STAT3Ser727 phosphorylation interacted in the spinal
  cord and subsequently increased IL-6 promoter activity that manifested as IL-6 cytokine-mediated
  inflammatory pain. T-5224, Mino, and LAA inhibited the PKCε/STAT3/IL-6 signaling
  pathway and the activation of neurons, astrocytes, and glial cells during inflammatory
  pain development. IL-6: interleukin-6; LAA: L-2-aminoadipic acid; Mino: minocycline;
  PKCε: protein kinase C epsilon; STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription
