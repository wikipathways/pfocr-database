caption: Biosynthetic pathways for the major types of BIAs, including the associated
  enzymes. The powder blue box represents the shared upstream biosynthetic pathway
  and key branch points for the synthesis of BIAs. The flesh-colored box represents
  the tetrahydroprotoberberine and protoberberine types; the green apple-colored box
  represents the morphinan type; the Maldivian green box represents the aporphine
  type. Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS); norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase (6OMT);
  Coclaurine N-methyltransferase (CNMT); N-methylcoclaurine 3’-hydroxylase (NMCH);
  4’-O-methyltransferase (4’OMT); Berberine bridge enzyme (BBE); (S)-scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase
  (SOMT); Canadine synthase (CAS); (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase (STOX); Salutaridine
  synthase (SalSyn); Reticuline N-methyltransferase (RNMT); Reticuline epimerase (REPI)
