caption: Gene interaction network (a) and pathway enrichment summary of common micro
  (mi)RNA targets. In (a), input genes are indicated by stripes with green circles
  representing downregulated genes and red representing upregulated genes in oxaliplatin-resistant
  colorectal cancer (CRC), while in (b), a schematic summary shows possible interactions
  of miRNAs and their oxaliplatin-resistant targets. The red background represents
  upregulation, and the green background indicates downregulation in oxaliplatin-resistant
  CRC, revealing significant expression in the respective validation dataset. Thick
  dashed black lines represent significant interactions, and thin black lines represent
  nonsignificant interactions. Oxaliplatin is represented by a blue background.
