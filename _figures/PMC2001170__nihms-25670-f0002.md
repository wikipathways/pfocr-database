caption: ‘Bypass Sec14p’ mutants suppress sec14 defects. This schematic illustrates
  the various effects of ‘bypass Sec14p’ mutants on phospholipid metabolism. The identification
  of lipid metabolic/binding activities in the ‘bypass Sec14p’ collection demonstrate
  Sec14p regulates Golgi secretory function via control of lipid metabolism/membrane
  lipid content. One ultimate recipient of these regulatory effects is posited to
  be the adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation factor (ARF) cycle. Putative downstream
  targets of ‘bypass Sec14p’ mutants include the ARF-GAPs Gcs1p and Age2p. All ‘bypass
  Sec14p’ mutants require an active phospholipase D (PLD) to exert this distinguishing
  phenotype. Mutations in the structural genes for choline kinase (CKI1) and choline
  phosphate cytidylytransferase (PCT1) inhibit PtdCho production and reduce consumption
  of DAG into PtdCho biosynthesis. DAG and PtdCho are posited to represent ‘pro-secretory’
  and ‘anti-secretory’ lipids, respectively, on the basis of their opposing effects
  on the activity of the pro-secretory Gcs1p/Age2p ARFGAP activities. Genetic disruption
  of the SAC1 gene, which encodes a phosphoinositide phosphatase, results in accumulation
  of PtdIns-4-P. PtdIns-4-P is categorized as a pro-secretory phospholipid and its
  synthesis in the Golgi complex is primarily catalyzed by the PtdIns 4-OK kinase
  Pik1p. Accessory proteins that modulate PtdIns-4-P signaling are not well characterized.
  One candidate is Kes1p, an oxysterol binding protein homolog. Genetic data identify
  Kes1p as either an inhibitor of PtdIns-4-P synthesis, an activator of PtdIns-4-P
  degradation, or a binding protein that limits PtdIns-4-P accessibility for pro-secretory
  signaling. Thus, Kes1p is a negative regulator of the Sec14p pathway. That PtdIns-4-P
  also regulates Kes1p function is also plausible.
