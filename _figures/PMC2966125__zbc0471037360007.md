caption: Model for repressive effect of chromatin modifications on DNA damage survival
  in rtt107Δ mutants. During DNA damage response, Bre1-mediated H2B K123Ub and by
  extension, Dot1-mediated H3 K79Me3, are required for checkpoint function. In rtt107Δ
  mutants, the presence of H3 K79Me3 is inhibitory to the yeast survival in DNA damage
  conditions. Loss of Dot1 increases the activity of the TLS pathway that bypasses
  the requirement of Rtt107 for cell survival. Ub, ubiquitin.
