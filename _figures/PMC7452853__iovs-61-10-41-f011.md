caption: Proposed mechanisms associated with 10% XCDM-induced hTM cell stiffening
  and Wnt pathway activation-mediated rescue of cells from stiffening. (Left cellular
  compartment) Ten percent (10%) XCDM-induced cell stiffening is associated with increased
  active cytoplasmic TAZ, which may adversely interact with cytoplasmic β-catenin,
  thereby dysregulating the latter's nuclear shuttling and/or its regulation of OB-cadherin,
  important for maintaining aqueous homeostasis. Decreased pGSK3β suggests probable
  subsequent degradation of cytoplasmic β-catenin. Further, elevated active cytoplasmic
  TAZ may directly prevent interaction of nuclear YAP with TEAD, and this may worsen
  with no ROCK activity. Consequently, suppression of key target genes and proteins
  of Wnt/β-catenin and YAP/TAZ pathways ensue, suggesting 10% XCDM stiffens hTM cells
  by dysregulating these two major mechanotransduction pathways. (Right cellular compartment)
  Activating the Wnt pathway via inhibiting GSK3β may shield β-catenin from cytoplasmic
  TAZ's inhibition, increase nuclear levels of β-catenin to activate Wnt target gene
  expression in rescuing hTM cells from 10% XCDM-induced stiffening. Further, activation
  of the Wnt pathway may enhance β-catenin-dependent increase of OB-cadherin in regulating
  cell-cell contacts important for aqueous homeostasis. 10% XCDM, 10% genipin-induced
