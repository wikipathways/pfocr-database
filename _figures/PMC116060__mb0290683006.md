caption: Proposed signal transduction pathways involved in PKC-mediated SRE activation.
  Various external stimuli can lead to activation of the three indicated MAP kinase
  (MAPK) pathways (p38, ERK, and JNK) and also the rhoA pathway. These, in turn, lead
  to activation of the transcription factors TCF and SRF, which form a ternary complex
  with the SRE promoter element of the c-fos gene. The data presented in this paper
  provide evidence that PKC-α and PKC-ɛ play important roles in both the c-Raf-MEK1-ERK
  and MEKK1-SEK1-JNK pathways, leading to activation of the TCF transcription factor.
  PKC-α and PKC-ɛ also appear to act downstream of rhoA in the pathway leading to
  activation of the SRF transcription factor. The precise mechanism by which PKC-α
  and PKC-ɛ activate c-Raf and MEKK1 is not known, nor are the intermediate steps
  in the rhoA pathway.
