caption: Signaling pathways in serum-free and feeder cell-free culture systems (using
  MEF-CM on Matrigel). Matrigel includes laminin-111, collagen IV, fibronectin, and
  vitronectin and supports robust hPSC growth. Collagen IV binds to α2β1 integrin
  and transduces a RhoGAP function to activate PI3K binding to AKT; activation of
  the latter pathway promotes cell growth in hiPSCs. Vitronectin supports the maintenance
  of hPSCs through αVβ5 integrin. αVβ1 integrin is able to recognize vitronectin and
  fibrinogen. Fibronectin can also bind to αVβ1 integrin and α5β1 integrin to promote
  secretion of laminin-332, -511, -521, and collagen IV from hiPSCs. hPSC, human pluripotent
  stem cells; MEF-CM, MEF-conditioned medium.
