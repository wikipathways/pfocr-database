caption: Schematic diagram illustrating that increased osteoblast‐derived ECM1 from
  the bone microenvironment of BMPC patients induced by ENZ treatment, interacts with
  the ENO1 receptor on the prostate cancer cell membrane, further recruiting adapter
  proteins including GRB2 and SOS1, which activates the downstream MAPK signaling
  pathway to promote the proliferation of PCa cells and induce anti‐androgen resistance
