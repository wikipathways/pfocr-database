caption: Members of the sirtuin family are involved in the regulation of COPD. Briefly,
  SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT6, and SIRT7 are localized in the nucleus. SIRT1, SIRT2 and SIRT6
  inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway to improve inflammatory response, SIRT1 and
  SIRT6 inhibit the TGF-β1 signaling pathway to alleviate EMT. SIRT1 can also regulate
  autophagy through the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 are located
  in the cytoplasm. SIRT3 and SIRT1 improve oxidative stress response by interacting
  with PGC-1α, SIRT4 inhibits IκBα to improve pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, and
  SIRT5 and SIRT1 promote FOXO3a deacetylation to regulate apoptosis and autophagy
