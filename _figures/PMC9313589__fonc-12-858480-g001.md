caption: Survival programs in normal and tumor cells. (A) Under physiological conditions,
  normal cells maintain stable levels of death-executing proteins while maintaining
  a constant balance of nutrients and trace elements, promoting cell survival. (B)
  To avoid death, tumor cells activate various mechanisms, such as decreasing the
  expression of proapoptotic and necroptotic genes while increasing antioxidant defense
  by increasing GSH synthesis and GPX4 levels. In this way, ROS are efficiently eliminated,
  avoiding the damage produced by the accumulation of iron due to low FPN levels.
  This death evasion program makes many types of cancer highly difficult to treat,
  as classical apoptosis induction therapies fail because the machinery for the execution
  of this pathway is not available. FPN, Ferroportin; TfR1, Transferrin Receptor 1;
