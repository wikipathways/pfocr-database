caption: β-Glucan stimulates pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), NADPH production, and
  glycogen synthesis in UK021 CA tissue slices. PPP metabolite analysis by IC-FTMS
  is as described in . NADPH was analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-FTMS, whereas
  glycogen was quantified by 1H NMR, as described in Methods. 13C-ribose enrichment
  in NADPH was estimated from the enrichment sum of 13C5- + 13C10-isotopologues, whereas
  13C-ring (adenine) enrichment in NADPH was derived from the enrichment sum of the
  remaining 13C-isotopologues (). •, 12C; •, 13C; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; X5P, xylulose-5-phosphate;
  Sed7P, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate; Gly3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate;
  F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; G1P, glucose-1-phosphate; Glyc,
  glycogen; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; TK, transketolase; TA, transaldolase.
  The green dashed curves denote C–C bond break in TA reaction, and the green arrows
  delineate the addition of the 13C3- and 13C1-3 carbon fragment to the unlabeled
  E4P to form 13C3- and 13C1-Sed7P, which represent contributions from the nonoxidative
  branch of PPP. This contribution was minimal because of the very low level of 13C3-
  and 13C1-Sed7P species in E. Comparing WGP- versus control-treated CA tissue slices,
  WGP enhanced buildup of PPP-specific intermediates 13C7-Sed7P (E)/13C4-E4P (F) and
  NADPH (product of the oxidative branch, C) was evident. This supports stimulation
  of the oxidative branch of PPP. Likewise, enhanced buildup of glycogen precursor
  13C6-G1P (H) and 13C-glycogen (I) by WGP was observed in the CA tissue slice. In
  contrast, PPP metabolites, NADPH, and glycogen metabolites responded negatively
  to WGP in the NC tissue slice.
