caption: Pathological functions of LOX family oxidases during cancer progression and
  metastasis. LOX, as a potent chemokine, orchestrates FAK/Src, Rho GTPases and p130Cas/Crk/DOCK180
  signaling pathway and cytoskeleton rearrangement to regulate cell-matrix adhesion
  and cell motility. Cells sense the mechanical force from stiff extracellular matrix,
  resultant from increased LOX expression and collagen crosslinking, through cell
  surface integrin receptors and downstream activation of FAK and Src kinases and
  cytoskeleton rearrangement to acquire the invasion ability. LOX family oxidases
  are actively involved in the regulation of cell polarity and epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition, by interacting with Snail transcription factor and protecting Snail
  from GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation and degradation to induce mesenchymal-like
  morphological changes and enhanced cell motility. LOX and LOXL2 secreted by primary
  tumors accumulate at the premetastatic sites, crosslink basement membrane type IV
  collagen and generate chemotactic cue for bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) to form
  the premetastatic niche to facilitate tumor cell metastasis. LOXL2 regulates angiogenesis
  through assembling type IV collagen in the endothelial basement membrane, in concert
  with other proangiogenic factors, e.g. VEGF-A under hypoxia
