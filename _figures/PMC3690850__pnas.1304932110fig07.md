caption: Working model for rotavirus cell entry. (1) RVs attach to the cell surface
  through the VP8 domain of VP4. After this initial attachment, the VP5 domain of
  VP4, as well as VP7 of some RV strains, has been proposed to interact with integrins,
  and all strains seem to interact with HSC70 at lipid rafts. All known postattachment
  receptors, and potentially other so-far-unidentified cell molecules, are represented
  as a single large rectangle. (2) RRV is internalized into the cell by a clathrin-
  and caveolin-independent endocytic process. All other RV strains so far characterized
  enter cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The traffic of the RRV endocytic
  vesicle is probably driven by the actin cytoskeleton and regulated by proteins such
  as ACTN4, CDC42, and RHOA. The role of these proteins has not been tested for RV
  strains other than RRV. (3) Regardless the endocytic pathway used, the delivery
  of coated and uncoated primary vesicles to EEs depends on RAB5, EEA1, and probably
  on HRS and the v-ATPase (). (4) At the EE, the endocytic vesicle carrying RV as
  cargo interacts with components of the ESCRT machinery (specifically HRS, TSG101,
  VPS25, VPS24, and VPS32) and fuses with the membrane of the EE. At this stage, the
  virus probably begins to be internalized into the endosomal lumen through the action
  of VPS4A. (5) EEs progress to MEs by acquiring a lower pH and a lower intraendosomal
  calcium concentration through the function of the v-ATPase; during this process
  the formation of ILVs increases. (6) The virus-receptor complex continues to be
  internalized in domains rich in the phospholipid LBPA with the participation of
  the VPS4A ATPase; this internalization might cause a clustering of virus receptors
  or the inhibition/induction of signaling pathways (see text) that causes a conformational
  change in the spike protein that promotes its interaction with the endosomal membrane,
  causing a permeabilization of the membrane that leads to the exit of intraendosomal
  calcium (). In nanomolar calcium concentrations, the RV particle uncoats and a further
  and more drastic conformational change of VP4 occurs—referred to as a fold-back
  structure ()—that promotes the exit of DLPs from the MEs. (7) The cytosolic DLPs
  start transcribing the RV genome to continue the replication cycle of the virus.
  It is important to note that RV strains other than RRV might require to reach LEs,
  where a lower pH and lower calcium concentration exist, to uncoat and for a successful
  translocation of the viral DLPs into the cytosol.
