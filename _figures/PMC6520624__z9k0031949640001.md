caption: 'Schematic representation of the stomatogastric nervous system in the crab
  Cancer borealis. A: schematic of the stomatogastric nervous system, including the
  projection pathway of the bilaterally paired projection neuron MCN5. Electrodes
  indicate recording locations from the MCN5 soma in the CoG (MCN5CoG) or its axon
  near the entrance to the STG (MCN5STG). Circles on nerves indicate recording sites
  for traces shown in later figures. Breaks in inferior and superior oesophageal nerves
  (ion, son) indicate where nerves were bisected for bath-application experiments.
  B: schematic of the gastric mill and pyloric circuits in C. borealis. There are
  eight gastric mill circuit neuron types, one of which is present as four apparently
  equivalent copies (GM neurons). This includes seven motor neurons and a single interneuron
  (Int1). There are seven pyloric circuit neuron types, including six motor neurons
  and one interneuron (AB). Three of these neuron types are present as multiple, apparently
  equivalent copies (PD: 2; LPG: 2; PY: 5). These neurons exhibit pyloric rhythm-timed
  activity (red), gastric mill rhythm-timed activity (blue), or a combination of pyloric-
  and gastric mill rhythm-timed activity (purple). Both panels are modified, with
  permission, from ).'
