caption: Schematic illustration of DNA repair pathways and implicated proteins. Mismatch
  repair (MMR) functions in the repair of base substitution mutations as well as small
  insertions/deletions caused by replication errors. The heterodimeric complex of
  MSH2 and MSH6 recognizes base mismatches and single-base insertions/deletions, whereas
  the MSH2 and MSH6 complex (not described in this schema) detect larger insertions/deletions.
  These complexes recruit another heterodimeric complex made up of MLH1 and PMS2 to
  initiate the repair process by excision of mismatches and insertions/deletions and
  re-synthesis of the DNA strand. In base excision repair (BER), a damaged base is
  recognized by a DNA glycosylase enzyme. Of all DNA glycosylase, DNA glycosylase
  (MPG) [alkylpurine-DNA-N-glycosylase (APNG)] recognizes and removes alkylated bases
  before apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) recognizes the abasic sites and
  cleaves the 5′ end of the DNA. In the major BER pathway, as a short-patch pathway,
  DNA polymerase β (polyβ) excises the 3′ end of the DNA and fills the gap. Finally,
  the XRCC1-ligase III complex catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds and
  completes the repair process. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) recognizes single-strand
  breaks and initiates the repair process in an overlapping manner with BER. For DSB
  repair, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) are
  utilized in the repair mechanism. In NHEJ, DSB are recognized by the Ku70/80 proteins,
  which bind and activate the protein kinase DNA-PKcs, recruiting XRCC4 and DNA ligase
  IV (Lig IV) to seal the gap. In HR, the MRE-11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex act as a
  sensor of DSB and binds to the break ends. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is
  then recruited to the sites of the breaks where ATM is phosphorylated and activates
  H2AX, generating phosphorylated H2AX (γ H2AX). DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1)
  binds γ H2AX and the recombination process begins. Replication stress causes single-stranded
  DNA and induces subsequent DSB. In this case, single-stranded DNA is bound by replication
  protein A (RPA), which recruits ATR and ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) to the break
  site. Rad17 and 9-1-1 are subsequently recruited to ATR-ATRIP, which is finally
  activated with the aid of DNA topoisomerase II-binding protein 1 (TOPBP1). In the
  process of HR, the BRCA1 complex with MDC1 has an essential role in damage detection.
  The subsequent BRCA1-BRCA1-partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2)-BRCA2 complex
  is important in mediating HR. BRCA2-mediated Rad51 recruitment is crucial for HR.
  Rad52 is also needed for RAd51 to enable access to single-stranded DNA coated with
  RPA. The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway functions during translesion DNA synthesis
  (TLS) in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs). ICLs are recognized by
  FANCM and the FA core complex, which monoubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI, thereby
  recruiting nucleases and other mediator proteins to facilitate the repair process.
  Recent studies have shown that the FA pathway regulates not only ICL, but also HR,
  possibly mediating BRCA2 and Rad51 function. The MGMT and nucleotide excision repair
  (NER) pathways are not described in this schema.
