caption: Roles of miRNAs in key phases of diabetic wound healing. MiRNAs modulate
  key pathways to promote wound healing. The inhibition of NF-κB and activation of
  the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway are critical, with signal transducer and activator
  of STAT3 playing a pivotal role in promoting M2 macrophage polarization through
  pathways such as DYRK1A/STAT3 and JAK2/STAT3. VEGF regulation is crucial, involving
  pathways like HIF1A/VEGF, VEGF-AKT/eNOS, and VEGF-induced activation of the p38MAPK
  signaling pathway, which facilitates blood vessel formation. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  is essential for the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts,
  crucial for effective re-epithelialization of the wound. MMPs such as MMP-9 and
  MMP-1 play dual roles in diabetic wound healing. Their effects can be beneficial
  or detrimental depending on the healing phase. PDGFD is highlighted for its positive
  impact on fibroblast proliferation and migration, contributing to effective ECM
  remodeling. Blue denotes miRNAs promoting specific processes, while red indicates
  those impairing them. Micro RNAs (miRNAs); signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3); phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-AKT (PI3K-AKT); signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3); nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB); matrix metalloproteinase-1
  (MMP-1); matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9); platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGFD);
  extracellular matrix (ECM); vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); epidermal
  growth factor (EGF); fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
