caption: The HIF-1α pathway and creation of an HIF-1α knockout mouse model. (Above)
  HIF-1α is a critical mediator in the cellular and tissue response to hypoxia. The
  function of this transcription factor is impaired by chronic hyperglycemia and aging,
  leading to impaired neovascularization and ischemic tissue recovery in diabetic
  and aged patients. (Center) Exon 1 of the Hif1 gene, which is flanked by loxP sites,
  is excised in cells expressing Cre recombinase under the Col1a2 promoter. (Below)
  Recombination after tamoxifen induction results in a fibroblast knockout of HIF-1α,
  allowing the assessment of dermal-specific deletion of HIF-1α during cutaneous wound
  healing and ischemic flap survival. PHD, prolyl hydroxylase; HRE, hypoxia response
  element.
