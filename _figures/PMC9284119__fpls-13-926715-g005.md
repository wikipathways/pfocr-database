caption: The expression trends of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthetic pathway
  after overexpression of TwSQS, TwSE, and TwOSC based on . A black single arrow represents
  a one-step reaction, a black double arrow represents a multistep reaction, and a
  black dotted arrow represents unknown steps. The colored upward or downward arrows
  indicate corresponding increase and decrease in gene expression. Colored horizontal
  line represents no statistical significance between the overexpression group and
  the pH7WG2D control group. The SQS, SE, and OSC enzymes analyzed in this study are
  highlighted in red. OE, overexpression.
