caption: 'Signaling regulation in endothelial cells(A) the regulation mechanism of
  cardiac endothelial cell senescence and cardiac fibrosis. Dox-induced overactivation
  of autophagy and inhibition of mTOR degrades VEGFR2 in a short time and decline
  continuously, promoting endothelial cell senescence. EndMT is a phenotypic transformation
  process in which endothelial cells gradually lose their own characteristics and
  acquire interstitial characteristics. The activation of NF- κ B-nial pathway induced
  by ROS may be a potential way of EndMT, and autophagy obstacle is the cause of ROS
  accumulation.(B) The interaction between endothelial cells and fibroblasts inhibits
  endothelial cell proliferation. Irisin is a novel hormone-like myokine that ameliorates
  autophagy disorders and EndMT by regulating UCP2. NRG-1 is an active cardiac growth
  factor released by endothelial cells, which plays an anti-apoptotic effect by combining
  with ErbB2/ErbB4 heterodimer on the surface of cardiomyocytes.(C) the interaction
  between endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes induces apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis.
