caption: MicroRNAs in EMT process. A. In the lower parts of epithelial and endothelial
  tissues, there is a thin layer of extracellular matrix called basement membrane
  (BM). Cancer cells must invade the basement membrane of the extracellular matrix
  to metastasize. Laminins are the main components of the ECM, which are involved
  in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the basement membrane (BM) of
  cancer cells. Cells with (EMT) characteristics are degraded through the matrix metalloproteinase
  (MMP)-associated pathway. The increased expression of MMPs leads to increased destruction
  of the basement membrane and the entry of cells with EMT characteristics into the
  blood circulation, which leads to invasion and then metastasis.B.Increasing miR-345
  by targeting IRF1 mRNA and inhibiting the activation of the mTOR/STAT3/AKT triple
  pathway and reducing the expression of its downstream targets such as Slug, Snail,
  and Twist reduce EMT in HCC cells. Up-regulation of miR-1296 inhibits hypoxia-promoting
  effects on metastasis and EMT of HCC cells by targeting SRPK1 gene expression and
  inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation which both miR-345 and miR-1296
  could be used to control the EMT progression
