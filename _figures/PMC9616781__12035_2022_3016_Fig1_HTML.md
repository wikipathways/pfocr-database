caption: Environmental enrichment (EE) causes upregulation and activation of tissue
  plasminogen activator which converts plasminogen into plasmin. The increase in plasmin
  facilitates the conversion of inactive proBDNF to active mature BDNF. EE also upregulates
  expression of tyrosine kinase b (TrkB) in conjunction with the increase in mature
  BDNF. Binding of mature BDNF to TrkB causes activation of the multiple pathways,
  mainly the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3k-Akt) and the mitogen-activated
  protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways. Activation
  of the PI3k-Akt leads to multiple downstream effects. Phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt)
  inactivates FOXO3a protein, leading to cell survival. Besides that, p-Akt also phosphorylates
  glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) at serine 9 (ser 9), inactivating it. This
  causes the inhibition of BACE1 expression, which reduces expression of amyloid beta
  plaques and decreases tau hyperphosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of the GSK-3β
  pathway also promotes neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. p-Akt also causes activation
  of NF-κB protein complex and CREB protein, leading to increased neurogenesis and
  enhanced synaptic plasticity. BDNF binding also causes the activation of the MAPK/ERK/MSK
  pathway, which also regulates neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity via the phosphorylation
  and activation of the CREB pathway. This pathway could also potentially promote
  cell proliferation via regulation of ELK-1 and c-Myc genes
