  S1P pathway summary showing how ceramide (Cer) is formed de novo from conversion
  of serine and palmitate into 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine (3KD) via serine palmitoyl
  transferases (SPT). 3KD is then reduced to dihydrosphingosine (DHS) and converted
  to dihydroceramide (DHCer) by ceramide synthase (CerS). Finally DHCer is converted
  to Cer by dihydrogceramide desaturase (DEGS). Cer can also be produced from sphingomyelin
  (SM) in the salvage pathway through sphingomyelinase (SMase). Cer can then be used
  to generate ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and can impact apoptosis, senescence, and
  growth inhibition. Additionally, Cer can be converted to sphingosine (Sph) via ceramidase
  (CDase), this process can then be reversed via CerS. Sph can then be converted into
  S1P via sphingosine kinases (SphK), a process which can be reversed via S1P phosphatase
  (S1PPase). S1P then binds to S1P receptors (S1PR) on cells to induce proliferation,
  cell survival, and inflammation. Bottom: Sphingolipid rheostat showing how the balance
  between pro-survival S1P and pro-apoptotic ceramide influences a cells ability to
  survive and proliferate.'
