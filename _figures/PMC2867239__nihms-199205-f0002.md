caption: The vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) pathway in the absence (A) or presence (B) of
  Sonic hedgehog (Shh) ligand. (A) In the absence of ligand, the Shh receptor Ptch1
  prevents the activation of another transmembrane domain protein, Smo. In this state,
  full length Gli2 and Gli3 are proteolytically processed into a smaller repressor
  form. (B) Upon Shh ligand binding to Ptch1, the inhibition on Smo is relieved and
  activates full-length Gli proteins and blocks production of Gli repressors.
