caption: Regulation mechanisms of PBXs. PBXs are regulated by multiple mechanisms
  at different layers, including transcription, post‐transcription, and post‐translation.
  (A) RA promotes PBX1/2/3 expression at the transcription level in a RARs‐dependent
  manner, and inhibits their proteasome‐dependent degradation. (B) USP9x acts as a
  specific deubiquitinase of PBX1 to inhibit its degradation. (C) NICD3/CSL complex
  transcriptionally activates PBX1 expression via binding to its promoter. (D) MiRNAs
  promote the degradation of PBX1/2/3 by targeting the 3′UTR of their mRNAs. (E) CircRNAs
  and (F) lncRNAs regulate the expression of PBX1/2/3 by sponging miRNAs. (G) NANOG
  serves as a transcription factor to enhance the transcriptional activity of PBX1.
  (H) Leptin upregulates PBX3 expression by activating the JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway.
  (I) PKA promotes the nuclear import of PBX1 by phosphorylating the conserved serine
  residues in the PBC‐B domain of PBX1. PBX, pre‐B‐cell leukaemia transcription factor;
  RA, retinoic acid; RAR, nuclear RA receptor; USP9x, ubiquitin‐specific peptidase
  9 X‐linked; NICD3, notch intracellular domain 3; miRNAs, microRNAs; circRNAs, circular
  RNAs; lncRNAs, long ncRNAs; JAK2/STAT3, janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3; PKA, protein kinase A
