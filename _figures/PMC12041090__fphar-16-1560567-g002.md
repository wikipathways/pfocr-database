caption: TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway. TGF-β/Smads is one of the classic pathways
  of fibrosis. The canonical pathway refers to the TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway.
  Ligands such as TGF-β, activins, and nodal bind complexes of transmembrane receptor
  types I and II on the cell surface, p-Smad2, and p-Smad3. Then, these ligands form
  a complex with Smad4. The activated Smad complex is transferred to the nucleus and
  binds to site-specific recognition sequences in the promoter regions of target genes
  to directly regulate transcription. In noncanonical pathways, the TGF-β receptor
  complex signals through other factors—such as β-catenin, MAPK (ERK1/2, p38 and JNK),
  JAK1/3-STAT1/3/5/6, and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway—which are indirectly
  activated by TGF-β target genes and involved in EMT, proliferation, differentiation,
  and stroma formation. In addition, AMPK inhibits mTOR, thereby affecting the PI3K-AKT
  pathway, which is involved in the regulation of fibrosis
