caption: 'In a stable symbiosis, symbiont-produced carbohydrates are a main source
  of carbon backbones for the synthesis of nonessential amino acids in the cnidarian
  host (left side). In contrast, pathways using food-derived choline and betaine for
  amino acid biosynthesis are down-regulated (right side). During stress exposure,
  the stable state of the symbiosis shifts to a carbon-limited state, resulting in
  increased dependency of the host on external carbon sources. In response, the amino
  acid biosynthesis pathway using food-derived carbon sources is now up-regulated,
  while the pathway relying on symbiont-derived glucose is down-regulated. Colours
  represent the direction of expression change: dark red–significantly up-regulated,
  orange–up-regulated, dark blue–significantly down-regulated, light blue down-regulated
