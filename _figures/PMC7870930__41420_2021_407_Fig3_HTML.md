caption: Necroptosis is a newly-described form of programmed cell death. Activating
  MLKL plays an important role in this process. The most widely studied subtype involves
  the TNF-inducible cell signal. In TNF-activated cells, RIPK1 is activated, and then
  activated RIPK1 forms complex IIb with RIPK3. MLKL is then phosphorylated by RIPK3
  and recruited into the necrosome through interaction with RIPK3. By targeting organelles
  such as mitochondria and/or lysosomes, the cell membrane is destroyed, eventually
  leading to necrosis by cell lysis. LncRNA can regulate necroptosis by influencing
  this pathway. For example, the lncRNA NRF can directly downregulate miR-873, thereby
  reducing RIPK1/RIPK3 inhibition by miR-837, finally promoting necroptosis. In fibroblasts
  and macrophages, TLR3 or TLR4 interacts with RIPK3 through Total Recordable Incident
  Frequency (TRIF) to directly activate necrosis, independent from the RIPK1 signaling
  pathway. Cell swelling, mitochondrial dysfunction, membrane permeability, and cytoplasmic
  content release are observed.
