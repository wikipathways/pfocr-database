caption: Production of RAGE ligands during CKD and COVID-19. RAGE ligands are highlighted
  in red. (1) Advanced glycation end-products (AGE) accumulate in comorbidities associated
  with CKD and COVID-19. AGE are produced in response to SARS-CoV-2. AGE are also
  consumed in the diet. (2) Cells damaged in response to injury or SARS-CoV-2 infection
  undergo apoptosis. Apoptotic cells produce S100A8/S100A9 and HMGB1 and generate
  antigens that bind C1q. HMGB1 can also bind with C1q and form a complex with RAGE
  and CD305 to induce cell signals that form resolvins and an M2 macrophage phenotype.
  (3) C1q promotes macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, in part, through binding
  to RAGE. Myeloid cells release S100A8/S100A9 and HMGB1 in response to injury and
  infection. (4) plasminogen activators (PA; tissue, tPA; urokinase, uPA) are commonly
  released from endothelial cells in response to injury (tPA) or growth factors (uPA).
  HMGB1 binds tPA, uPA, and plasminogen, which enhances the rate of plasminogen activation,
  the formation of plasmin, and fibrinolysis. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator
  receptor (uPAR) on immune cells, fibroblasts or endothelial cells is cleaved by
  proteases (e.g., uPA, tPA), which forms soluble uPAR (suPAR). (5) Activated platelets
  and neurons produce amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is cleaved by secretases
  (β, γ) to form amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Aβ is cleared from plasma by the kidney.
  Activated adipocytes and platelets produce autotoxin, which transforms lysophosphatidylcholine
  (LPC) into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). (6) S100B accumulates in end-stage kidney
  disease and severe COVID-19. The source of S100B is not known but might include
  lymphocytes, glial cells, and/or adipocytes.
