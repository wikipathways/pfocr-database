caption: Biosynthetic pathway of sphingolipids consisting of free long chain bases
  (top row), which are N-acylated by several CerS enzymes to form dihydroceramides
  (upper row of octagons). These DHCer may then processed by dihydroceramide desaturases
  to introduce a 4, 5 double bond to form ceramide (lower row of octagons). Collectively
  both the DHCer and Cer may be converted to more complex via addition of a polar
  headgroup at the 1′-OH position via sphingomyelin synthase to form sphingomyelin
  (thick lined squares), or ceramide kinase to form ceramide-1-phosphate (thin lined
  squares). Carbohydrates may also be linked to this position as well via glucosylceramide
  or galactosylceramide synthase to form glucosylceramides (light blue circles) and
  galactosylceramides (yellow circles), respectively. The former may have additional
  carbohydrates such as galactose complexed to it to form lactosylceramide (bottom
  row of light blue and yellow linked circles). The latter may also be sulfated to
  form the sulfatide species (pink circles). The far right and upper left corners
  show the degradative pathway of sphingolipids via ceramidases, sphingosine/sphinganine
  kinases, and sphingosine/sphinganine phosphate lyases, which constitutes the only
  known exit from the sphingolipid metabolic pathway.
