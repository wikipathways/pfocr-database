caption: Nitrogen regulation of the GAAC pathway. (A) Translational regulation of
  nitrogen catabolite genes by the GAAC pathway with different nitrogen sources. When
  amino acids are present, the α subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor eIF2 binds with GDP, which then transforms into a GTP-bound state with the
  help of the GEF eIF2B. The GTP-bound form of eIF2 recruits a charged methionyl initiator
  tRNA to form the TC. The subsequent recruitment of the 40S small ribosomal subunit
  and other eIFs by the TC generates the 43S PIC. The PIC scans the mRNA to find an
  AUG start codon. Once the start codon is found, eIF2-GTP is hydrolyzed to eIF2-GDP
  and released from the TC. The modified PIC then recruits the 60S ribosomal unit
  to form the 80S initiation complex. Because there are four μORFs in the 5′-UTR of
  GCN4 mRNA, the 80S initiation complex has difficulty reaching the true start codon
  of the mRNA. Thus, under this condition, the translation of GCN4 mRNA is very limited.
  In the absence of amino acids, the levels of uncharged tRNAs increases, leading
  to the activation of the Gcn2 protein kinase. The activation of Gcn2 mediates the
  phosphorylation of eIF2, which results in it tightly binding with GDP and eIF2B
  to prevent the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2. The GDP-bound state of eIF2 decreases
  the TC level, resulting in a significant reduction in general protein synthesis.
  However, the activation of the translation of GCN4 under this condition benefits
  from the presence of four μORFs in its 5′-UTR. The lack of translational initiation
  from the TC leads the only existing TC to read through the μORFs until it reaches
  the true AUG site of the GCN4 mRNA and initiates its translation, thereby generating
  Gcn4, which finally activates its target genes. (B) Regulation of the intracellular
  abundance of Gcn4. In addition to nitrogen sources, Gcn4 is also regulated by the
  TOR pathway. Rapamycin treatment inhibits the TORC1 complex, which releases PP2A
  and Sit4 from the complex. Free PP2A and Sit4 dephosphorylate Gcn2, which results
  in the enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2α and finally represses the translation of
  GCN4 mRNA. Alternatively, abundant amino acid conditions lead to a rapid burst of
  Pcl5 production, which activates Pho85 to phosphorylate Gcn4. Meanwhile, another
  regulator, Srb10, is also responsible for the phosphorylation of Gcn4. Phosphorylated
  Gcn4 is then ubiquitylated by Cdc34 and SCFCDC4, which finally leads to the degradation
  of Gcn4.
