caption: Membrane TLRs and their accessory molecules. Cell surface TLR1, TLR2, TLR4,
  and TLR6 are essential for the recognition of exogenous and endogenous ligands.
  TLR1/2, TLR2/6 heterodimers and TLR4/TLR4 homodimer utilize MyD88-dependent pathway
  to control inflammatory responses via activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription
  factors, endosomal TLR4 activates TRAM/TRIF-dependent pathway resulting in type
  I IFN responses. CD36 induces the assembly of the TLR4/6 and TLR2/6 heterodimers.
  CD14 can be secreted as a soluble molecule (sCD14) or a membrane bound protein (mCD14)
  and is involved in ligand delivery to several TLRs. LPS-binding protein (LBP) binds
  to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and presents it to CD14. MD2 is necessary for TLR4 to
  bind to LPS and homodimerize. RP105-MD1 complex has a structural similarity to TLR4-MD2
  and exerts dual regulatory activity on TLR4 and TLR2 -regulated inflammatory response.
  Dectin-1 facilitates TLR2 signaling whereas TRIL interacts with ligands to activate
  TLR4 signaling. Vitronectin enhances TLR2 and TLR4-mediated responses. Created with
