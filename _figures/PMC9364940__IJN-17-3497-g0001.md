caption: 'Mechanisms of ferroptosis induced by IR. It mainly affects ferroptosis through
  5 pathways.1: IR not only causes excess ROS to induce ferroptosis by triggering
  radiolysis of cellular water and stimulating oxidative, altering mitochondrial structure
  or function. 2: IR can mediate lipid peroxidation and induce ferroptosis by upregulating
  the expression of ACSL4. 3: IR induced DNA damage, inhibited the expression of SLC7A11,
  weakened the ferroptosis defense system mediated by the SLC7A11-GSH-GPX4 signaling
  axis, and further promoted ferroptosis. 4: IR-induced DNA breakage activates the
  cGAS-STING1 pathway, leading to autophagy-dependent ferroptosis via lipid peroxidation.
  5: IR, primarily by causing ferroptosis, can promote the production of tumor cell-released
  particles (RT-MPs), reverse the tumor microenvironment, increase antitumor effects,
  and mediate bystander effects (RIBE).'
