caption: Cargo trafficking through the endocytic pathway. (A) The endocytic pathway.
  Extracellular cargo (light green blobs) is internalized by endocytosis mediated
  by clathrin (red bars). Cargo then enters the early endosomes characterized by the
  small GTPase Rab5. Rab5 early endosomes convert into late endosomes by exchanging
  Rab5 by Rab7. Rab7 late endosomes fuse with lysosomes to degrade cargo. Cargo from
  the Rab5 early endosomes can also traffic subsequently into the recycling endosome
  characterized by Rab11 from where cargo can be recycled by being targeted back to
  the plasma membrane. (B) Dynamic events shaping the early endosome network. After
  internalization, endocytic vesicles can fuse with early endosomes, thereby bringing
  cargo into the endosomal network. Rab5 endosomes can receive more cargo by homotypic
  fusion with other endosomes. They can lose cargo by homotypic fission. Cargo can
  leave the early endosome network by heterotypic fission of or conversion of early
  to late endosomes.
