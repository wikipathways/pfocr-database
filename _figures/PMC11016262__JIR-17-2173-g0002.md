caption: 'Interactions between gut microbiota and the intestinal mucosal immunity.
  Intestinal microorganisms in the body can be classified into two main categories:
  probiotic and pathogenic bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria include: Salmonella spp,
  Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Bacillus spp, Campylobacter jejuni;
  The probiotic bacteria in the body could stimulate the expression of α4β7 by T cells
  and B cells, then enter into the blood circulation; Bifidobacterium induce the expression
  of CD4+ T cells, increase the number of IgA by plasma cells, and release IL-10 by
  the induction of spleen cells and DC-CD4+ T cells; Lactobacillus could stimulate
  LPLs, thereby activating STAT3 signaling pathway and ISCs to enhance intestinal
  mucosal immunity; SCFAs produced by plasma cells could modulate the macrophages
  and dendritic cells to maintain the intestinal function; During SAP, the abundance
  of pathogenic bacteria increases and part of them could enter the body through the
  damaged tight junction; M cells play an important role in resistance to the pathogenic
  bacteria by targeting CGRP; Lactobacillus acidophilus combined with Bacillus subtilis
  can stimulate the production of CD4+T cells and SIgA+ cells, resulting in the increase
  in GPR43, GPR41, AhR and HIF-1α; The presence of Clostridium butyricum could enhance
  the Treg response and suppress the Th1 and Th17 response.'
