caption: 'Hypothetical role of unfavorable IL28B and IFNL4 genotypes in the response
  to IFN therapy.Notes: (A) When the innate immune system, including the RIG-I–IFIH1
  pathway, detects the presence of HCV RNA, the adaptor protein MAVS stimulates the
  expression and secretion of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ. In patients with the unfavorable
  IFNL4 genotype (ΔG allele), the full-length protein is expressed and poorly secreted.
  On the other hand, constant induction of the IFN signaling pathway in the presence
  of the virus seems to be a common characteristic in patients with the unfavorable
  IL28B genotypes (rs12979860 CT/TT). (B) IFN-α and IFN-β are recognized by IFNAR,
  whereas IFN-λ binds to the IL10R–I IFNλR receptor complex. Both receptors trigger
  the JAK-STAT pathway, which induces translocation of an ISGF complex to the nucleus,
  where it binds to the IFN-stimulated response elements of multiple ISGs. The mechanism
  by which IFN-λ4 impairs HCV clearance remains unclear. In spite of higher baseline
  ISG expression levels, viral elimination is not possible in patients with the rs12979860
  CT/TT genotypes, due to the fact that negative regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway
  is being activated at the same time through IFN-inhibitory molecules (SOCS3 and
  PIAS). (C) When IFN-α is administered as part of therapy in patients with unfavorable
  IL28B genotypes, the cell shows a low sensitivity to IFN. (D) Exogenous IFN-α is
  not able to stimulate ISG expression strongly enough to clear the virus. Therefore,
  the patient exhibits a poor therapeutic response. Reprinted by permission from Macmillan
