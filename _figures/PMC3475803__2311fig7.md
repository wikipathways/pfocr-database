caption: A model depicting ATM- and NEMO-mediated NF-κB activation upon accumulation
  of prelamin A isoforms. Nuclear envelope alterations caused by the accumulation
  of prelamin A isoforms trigger a nuclear stress pathway involving ATM and NEMO proteins.
  As a consequence of prelamin A/progerin accumulation, ATM is activated, and NEMO
  is translocated into the nucleus. NEMO phosphorylation by ATM induces their translocation
  out of the nucleus to activate the cytoplasmic IKK complex. Subsequent NF-κB activation
  triggers an inflammatory-associated transcriptional program that leads to the secretion
  of IL-6, CXCL1, and TNF-α. Increased levels of senescence-associated cytokines cause
  systemic inflammation by acting over distant cells and tissues. Systemic inflammation
  amplifies a cascade of aged signals, critically affecting tissue homeostasis and
  finally reducing the life span of progeroid mice.
