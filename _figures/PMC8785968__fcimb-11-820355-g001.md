caption: Model summarizing EGFR trafficking pathways. Ligand-activated receptors are
  internalized from clathrin-coated pits via an interaction with Grb2 (1), and subsequently
  diverted away from a constitutive actin-dependent recycling pathway through their
  recognition by HRS and other early ubiquitin-binding ESCRT subunits (2). Degradative
  MVB sorting is regulated by a subset of the ESCRT machinery (3), including accessory
  proteins such as UBPY that facilitate EGFR transfer from ubiquitin-binding ESCRT
  machinery to ESCRT-III (4). A putative retention factor (purple triangle) restrains
  EGFR from being diverted away from nascent ILVs to the ubiquitin-independent recycling
  pathway. Stress-exposed EGFRs are internalized via a p38-MAPK-dependent interaction
  with the AP-2 clathrin adaptor (5), followed by sustained signaling in non-degradative
  MVBs via a mechanism requiring WASH (6) and Alix (7). Stress-exposed EGFRs subsequently
  recycle back to plasma membrane following p38-MAPK inactivation (8). Ligand-activated
  EGFR signaling also regulates endocytic trafficking of unliganded receptor monomers
  downstream of non-canonical p38-MAPK-dependent phosphorylation. It is not currently
  known if this pathway involves the same non-degradative MVB sorting mechanism described
  for stress-exposed EGFRs.
