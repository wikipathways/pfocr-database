caption: Graphical abstract of the study. (A) FKBP5 is associated with senile osteoporosis.
  Specifical deletion of FKBP5 in BMSCs alleviate senile osteoporosis in aged mice.
  Administration of SAFit2 enhances bone density in a senile osteoporosis model. (B)
  BMSC osteogenic differentiation is regulated by FKBP5 via the canonical WNT/β‐catenin
  signalling pathway
