caption: Extrinsic pathway involves transmembrane receptor mediated interactions.
  It involves mainly Caspases. [ - TNFSF10 gene (3q26.31) codes for ligand TRAIL (TNFrelated
  apoptosis-inducing ligand). TRAIL leads to cellular death when it binds with death
  receptors DR4 (TRAIL-RI) and DR5 (TRAIL-RII) in normal cells. TRAIL also has capability
  to bind to decoy receptors DcR1 and DcR2 leading to transcription of antiapoptotic
  genes that antagonizes the death-signaling pathway. This is an observed mechanism
  in many cancer cells where it promotes inflammation. Owing to their anticipated
  role TRAIL and TRAIL receptors have been extensively evaluated for their expression
  in oral cancers and precancers. When compared to normal epithelium, the expression
  progressively diminished in oral precancers and cancers. An elevated expression
  of DR4, DR5 and DcR1 and a diminished DcR2 expression have been reported in oral
  cancer., Nagar et al. reported primary cancer cells to be more susceptible than
  metastatic secondary cells in TRAIL induced apoptosis but through Lysosomal Protease
  Cathepsin B. Many substances like suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and esculetin
  have been observed to synergistically activate TRAIL thus promoting apoptosis demonstrated
  in oral cancers, cancer cell lines and animal models.,
