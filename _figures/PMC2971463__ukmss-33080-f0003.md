caption: SLIT can inhibit invasion and promote a cell cycle arrest by blocking Wnt,
  HGF and SDF-1 signalling. The SLIT-ROBO can also prevent invasion and stimulate
  a cell cycle arrest directly by negatively regulating cdc42 activity. SLIT binding
  to ROBO also relieves inhibition of DCC by Netrin-1. This allows the activation
  of pro-apoptotic pathways through Caspase 3 and 9. SLIT can also bind and sequester
  Netrin-1 preventing its interaction with DCC and inhibitory role in apoptosis. Depending
  on the particular cellular environment, the SLIT-ROBO interaction can also promote
  and inhibit adhesion. The SLIT-ROBO interaction promotes adhesion in breast tumour
  cells and during mammary gland development, possibly by enhancing the association
  between E-cadherin and β-catenin at cell borders. However during formation of the
  heart lumen, SLIT-ROBO signalling antagonises E-cadherin/β-catenin mediated cell-cell
  adhesion. During neural development SLIT binding promotes an interaction between
  ROBO and N-cadherin. Subsequently β-catenin becomes disassociated from the complex
  and there is a reduction in cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion. Black arrows represent
  promoting an activity while red arrows depict inhibiting an action.
