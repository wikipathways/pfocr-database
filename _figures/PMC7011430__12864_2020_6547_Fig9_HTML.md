caption: Proposed model of methylglyoxal detoxification via glyoxalase pathway proteins
  in various subcellular organelles of sorghum. Cellular defence against MG probably
  involves four different sub-cellular compartments viz. cytosol, chloroplast, mitochondria
  and nucleus. Cytosolic MG produced as an off shoot of glycolysis is converted to
  SLG by SbGLYI-10/11 which is further converted to D-lactate by SbGLYII-3. The conversion
  of D-lactate to pyruvate is catalysed either by SbDLDH-3, 4.1 or 4.2. Both in the
  mitochondria as well as chloroplast, MG detoxification is predicted to be catalysed
  by the same SbGLYI and SbGLYII proteins. D-lactate produced in the chloroplast can
  be converted to pyruvate either by cytosolic SbDLDH protein or transported in the
  mitochondria. In mitochondria, D-lactate is converted to pyruvate by SbDLDH-1/2
  protein. Pyruvate is then fed into the Kreb’s cycle. In the nucleus, SbGLYI-8/SbGLYI-8.1,
  may catalyse the conversion of MG to SLG. Nuclear export of SLG is proposed as no
  nuclear GLYII could be predicted in the sorghum genome. TPI-Triose phosphate isomerase,
