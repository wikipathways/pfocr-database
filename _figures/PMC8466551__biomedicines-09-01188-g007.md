caption: 'A schematic representation of the Smoothened (SMO)-independent regulation
  of glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) transcription factors by their interacting
  proteins. Apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein 2 (ASPP2) deficiency enhanced the
  binding of atypical Protein Kinase C ι (aPKC-ι) with GLI1, which allows aPKC-ι to
  phosphorylate GLI1 at Ser84. The phosphorylated GLI1 is, in turn, activated, promoting
  its translocation into the nucleus to transcribe target genes. Galectin-1 (Gal-1)
  binds to β1 integrin to promote GLI1 activation. Mechanistically, activated β1 integrin
  forms a complex with insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) to promote protein
  kinase B (AKT) activation, leading to an increase in GLI1 activity. In the nucleus,
  SOX9 binds to the F-box region of β-TrCP, interfering with its binding to SKP1.
  The binding of SOX9 to β-TrCP tethers it within the nucleus, thus protecting GLI1
  from degradation. Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) downregulation results in decreased
  ubiquitination of full-length GLI2/3 proteins, favoring their activation and nuclear
  translocation over their proteasomal processing into repressors. In the nucleus,
  the N-terminal domain (aa 1-68) of transcription factor forkhead box C1 (FOXC1)
  binds to the internal region (aa 898-1168) of GLI2, enhancing its DNA-binding and
  transcriptional-activating ability. The imbalance between Tyr216 and Ser9 phosphorylation
  of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) leads to its dysregulated function, thereby
  impairing its ability to phosphorylate full-length GLI3 proteins. Unphosphorylated
  full-length GLI3 proteins are not subjected to proteasomal processing into their
  repressors, allowing their translocation into the nucleus to transcribe target genes.
  Under androgen-deprived conditions, the downregulation of MED12 relieves its constraint
  on the full-length GLI3 proteins, resulting in their hyperactivation. Green downward
  triangle-headed arrow: downregulation; red upward triangle-headed arrow: upregulation;
  dotted bar-headed arrow: loss of inhibition.'
