caption: Diagram of the signaling pathway of T4 and T3 from the blood stream to the
  cells of the brain for enzymatic processing. A) Simplified HPT feedback loop. In
  disease, disruptions in HPT signaling may occur at one or more of the three components
  (hypothalamus, pituitary or thyroid gland) of the feedback loop. Likewise the disruptions
  may occur in interpretation of incoming stimuli, or in output response from stimuli.
  B) 1) T3 and T4 are produced by the thyroid gland and transported via the circulatory
  system to the hypothalamus. 2) T4 and T3 enter tanycytes (specialized astrocytes)
  and T4 is processed to T3 by D2. 3) T3 is transported to neurons where it is processed
  by D3 to its inactive forms, T2 or rT3. 4) Remaining T3 may bind to TR and translocate
  to the nucleus. 5) In the nucleus, the T3/TR complex can bind to the promoter element
  of the neurogranin gene to active its transcription. HPT, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid;
  T4, thyroxine; T3, tri-iodothyronine; D2, deiodinase-2; D3, deiodinase-3; rT3, reversed
  T3; T2, 3,5-Diiodo-L-thyronine; TR, nuclear thyroid hormone receptor; NG, neurogranin.
