caption: Model of MutS during MMR initiation. Schematic illustrating conformational
  changes and nucleotide ligation states associated with MutS binding DNA (far left),
  searching homoduplex DNA, identifying mismatches (centre) and becoming a mismatch
  recognition activated sliding clamp (far right). The suggested occupancy of the
  two nucleotide-binding sites is indicated above MutS (D=ADP and T=ATP). We expect
  both nucleotide-binding sites are occupied at the nucleotide concentrations in our
  experiments as well as those found in vivo. Therefore, we indicate the ADP:ATP ligation
  state of MutS as the most significant intermediate on the signalling pathway. It
  remains possible that an ADP:empty configuration, although not probable in vivo,
  could be competent to convert to the sliding clamp. Finally, the final nucleotide
  exchange during sliding clamp activation is unresolved in our experiment (grey shading).
