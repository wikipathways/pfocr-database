caption: Model summarising the relationship between ALK signalling and MT dynamics
  in EML4-ALK V3. Schematic model showing the proposed drug resistance mechanism of
  EML4-ALK V3. EML4-ALK variants, the protein exists as a trimer via the dynamic interactions
  of the EML4 trimerization domain that drive ALK activation and signalling, but only
  EML4-ALK V3 associates efficiently with microtubules to enhance stability and confer
  resistance to vincristine. The inactivation of ALK kinase via ALK-TKIs sequesters
  EMl4-ALK V3 to microtubules, promoting tubulin acetylation and chemoresistance.
  Additionally, EML4-ALK V3 maintains an active JAK/STAT3 pathway in the presence
  of ALK-TKIs. Taken together, these drug-resistance mechanisms allow EML4-ALK V3
  to escape cell death.
