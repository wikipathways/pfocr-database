caption: ERK1/2-mediated regulation of the BCL2 protein family. ERK1/2 activation
  by RTK signalling, mutant RAS or mutant BRAF (shown, yellow star) has pleiotropic
  effects on the expression and/or activity of BCL2 family members. The BH3-only protein
  BIM is phosphorylated by ERK1/2 on at least three sites, marking BIM for ubiquitination
  and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. ERK1/2 also negatively regulates
  the expression and/or activity of BMF through incompletely understood mechanisms.
  Activation of RSK by ERK1/2 promotes BAD phosphorylation, which creates a 14-3-3
  binding site and sequesters BAD away from the mitochondria. MCL1 stability is subject
  to reciprocal regulation by the actions of ERK1/2 and GSK3. Phosphorylation of MCL1
  by ERK1/2 stabilizes MCL1, whereas GSK3-mediated phosphorylation promotes MCL1 degradation.
  In the nucleus, ERK1/2 influences the transcription of BCL2 family members. Activation
  of ERK1/2-dependent RSK and MSK1/2 activates CREB, which promotes transcription
  of the pro-survival genes BCL2, BCL-XL and MCL1. ELK1 activation by ERK1/2 may also
  augment MCL1 transcription. ERK1/2 promotes the degradation of FOXO3, thereby inhibiting
  FOXO3-dependent transcription of pro-apoptotic BIM and PUMA. In contrast to other
  pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, ERK1/2 signalling induces the expression of NOXA
  mRNA and protein. Thus, with the exception of NOXA, tumour cell ERK1/2 signalling
  typically promotes the expression of pro-survival factors, and represses the expression
  and/or activity pro-apoptotic BCL2 family members.
