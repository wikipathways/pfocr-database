caption: Modulation of autophagy in macrophages. Autophagy can be induced by mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, such as rapamycin, by drugs acting via the
  D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) pathway, such as sodium valproate, by vitamin
  D (through the induction of the anti-microbial peptide cathelicidin) and by cytokines,
  including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ. Induction of autophagy
  by IFN-γ is dependent on immunity-related GTPase M (Irgm1/IRGM) and may act, at
  least partially, through the induction of TNF-α in cells infected with mycobacteria.
  Other cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and IL-10 inhibit autophagy
  through protein kinase B (Akt), signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT)6 and STAT3 signalling pathways. In cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
  induction of autophagy leads to increased acidification and maturation of mycobacteria-containing
  phagosomes and increased killing of intracellular bacteria. Autophagy also plays
  a role in antigen presentation and inhibits the processing and secretion of proinflammatory
  cytokines, including IL-1β and IL-18.
