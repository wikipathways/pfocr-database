caption: The AMY3 is a heterodimeric complex of calcitonin receptor and receptor activity
  modifying protein 3. In AD, Amyloid β (Aβ) peptide activates AMY3 subtype receptors
  by promoting multiple intracellular signaling pathways which is demonstrated in
  the above figure. The interaction of Human amylin (hAmylin) and Aβ together leads
  to activation AMY3. The activation of AMY3 stimulates G-Protein Gαs which further
  control the adenylate cyclase (AC), followed by an increase in cellular cAMP. Binding
  of cAMP to the PKA regulatory subunits (R2) induces dissociation of the tetrameric
  PKA holoenzyme, resulting in activation of PKA catalytic subunits. cAMP-activated
  PKA is involved in the regulation of Erk1/2 activities. The triggering of the ERK1/2
  pathway may cause uneven distribution of Ca2+ trigger the dysfunction of the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and mitochondria and result in cell death. In addition, cAMP stimulates
  Akt which further leads to transcription factor cFos expression. Created with BioRender.com.
