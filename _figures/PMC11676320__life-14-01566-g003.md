caption: The possible mechanism of taurine-induced anti-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic
  effects in eye diseases. Oxidative stress plays an important role in retinal physiologic
  and pathologic metabolism. As retinal physiology is tightly linked with redox signaling,
  a balance between retinal reactive oxygen species (ROS; red) and antioxidant scavengers
  should be maintained. Hypoxic insults (represented by the gray box) could increase
  ROS levels in ocular cells (neural retina, retinal pigment epithelial cells, or
  choroid). Hypoxia-induced ROS might stabilize HIF or increase hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) expression in the eye, leading to increases in HIF-1 target
  angiogenic proteins (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); placental growth
  factor (PGF); or erythropoietin (EPO)). The mechanism of ROS regulation of HIF-1α
  levels is in need of further investigation for each disease condition. One potential
  mechanism is that ROS may affect the HIF-1α proteasomal degradation pathway (especially
  functions of HIF regulatory protein prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs)). The pathologic
  process resulting from HIF-1α activation eventually causes neovascularization in
  the retina or choroid, eventually leading to visual impairments and vision loss.
  Retinal cell death is partly associated with HIF-1α-mediated apoptosis. Retinal
  cell death and neovascularization are also closely related. Damaged retinal vessels
  cause retinal inflammation and infiltrated inflammatory cells could affect retinal
  cell death or function. During the retinal cell death process, various chemokines
  or cytokines could be released and retinal glial cells activated, and the pathologic
  effects of these mechanisms could damage retinal vessels, ultimately contributing
  to the development of neovascularization. Either detrimental mechanism should be
  well understood in the eye (depending on the neural retina, retinal pigment epithelial
  cells, or choroid). Parts of the process could be suppressed by the antioxidant
  effects of taurine. Solid lines show direct effects. The dotted lines indicate indirect
  effects with several potential steps
