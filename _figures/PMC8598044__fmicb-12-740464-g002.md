caption: Hepatitis B virus suppression of type I interferon (IFN) response (green
  arrows indicate the related signaling pathways and T-arrows in red indicate blocking
  the targets). HBsAg inhibits TLR9 and mediates the ubiquitination of NEMO to suppress
  the NF-kB pathway. HBeAg can inhibit phosphorylation of NF-kB. HBV polymerase can
  block the nuclear translocation of activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). HBV polymerase
  is able to disrupt the interaction between TBK1/IKKε and DEAD box protein 3 (DDX3)
  to play a novel role in HBV counteraction of IFN-β production. HBx interacts with
  MAVS to act as a suppressor of virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs. HBV infection
  can also reduce PTEN protein expression to inhibit IFN signaling pathway.
