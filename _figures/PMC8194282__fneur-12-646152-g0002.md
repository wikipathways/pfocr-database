caption: 'Three key inflammatory signaling pathways related to PTE: IL-1β/IL-1R, HMGB1/TLR4,
  and TGF-β/albumin pathway. After TBI, BBB is destroyed, as well as microglia and
  astrocytes are activated. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, HMGB1 and TGF-β
  are released into the extracellular matrix. IL-1β binding to IL-1R can activate
  the downstream NF-κB, p38 MAPK, Src, etc. and initiate intracellular signal transduction
  through MyD88-dependent or independent signaling pathways. HMGB1 can be passively
  released by necrotic cells, or be actively secreted to the extracellular from activated
  microglia and astrocytes, binding to many different types of cell receptors (TLR2/4,
  RAGE), and activating downstream signaling molecules like the IL-1β/IL-1R signaling
  pathway. In addition, TBI causes BBB destruction, serum albumin extravasates into
  the extracellular matrix, activating the TGF-β/ALK5 pathway. These series of inflammatory
  cascades can lead to increased excitability and synaptic reconstruction, which in
  turn promotes the development of PTE.'
