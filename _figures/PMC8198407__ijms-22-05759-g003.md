caption: Disturbed one carbon metabolism induced by metformin. Metformin reduces vitamin
  B12, thus impairing the methylation cycle and leading to increased Hcy levels, which
  are cytotoxic, and hypomethylation of proteins and nucleic acids, which may cause
  epigenetic changes. The folate cycle is also disturbed by metformin’s antifolate-like
  activity, thereby reducing pyrimidine and purine synthesis and disrupting cell growth
  and proliferation. DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; DNMTs, DNA methyltransferase;
  MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase; MTHFD1, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase
  1; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTRR, methyltransferase reductase;
  SAH, S adenosyl L homocysteine; SAHH, adenosylhomocysteinase; SAM, S-adenosyl methionine;
  THF, tetrahydrofolate. Black arrows indicate cellular pathway. Orange arrows indicate
  putative effects of metformin. Figure created using Biorender.com.
