caption: 'Targeting autophagy to enhance anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. (1) Autophagy induction:
  facilitates the degradation of PD-L1 through lysosomal pathways; by facilitating
  this degradation, the signaling associated with immune checkpoints is diminished.
  Autophagy transports cytoplasmic antigens to lysosomes, where they are processed
  and then loaded onto MHC class II molecules. This process enhances the presentation
  of endogenous antigens to CD4+ T-cells. Additionally, autophagy can aid in the processing
  of antigens for presentation on MHC class I molecules, which influences CD8+ T-cell
  responses. MHC-I molecules are identified and bound by the protein NBR1. Following
  recognition, MHC-I components are transported to lysosomes, where they undergo degradation
  via the autophagic pathway. (2) Autophagy inhibition: impaired the degradation of
  PD-L1, leading to its accumulation on the cell surface and boosting the therapeutic
  efficacy of PD-L1 blockade'
