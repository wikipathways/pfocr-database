  crop milk (; ; ; ,). (1) Insulin and (2) Leu are promote crop growth and crop milk
  production through TORC1 signaling pathway to guide protein synthesis. (3) Met elevated
  the serum prolactin (PRL) concentration and upregulated the protein level of prolactin
  receptor, JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway, and improved the crop relative weight, crop
  milk protein level. (4) AMPK signaling pathway is activated in the crop tissues
  of male incubation period.
