caption: Proposed Model for the Final Common Pathway of Putative Mitochondrial Dysfunction
  Resulting from Either PTEN or SDHx Mutation in Cowden and Cowden-like SyndromesA
  simplified version of the signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis in the setting
  of dysfunctional PTEN or SDH (represented by hatched colors). These pathways crosstalk,
  leading to the final common outcome of tumor angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and
  inhibition of apoptosis. Note that one of the functions of SDH is the conversion
  of succinate to fumarate as part of the Kreb's tricarboxylic acid cycle. SDH dysfunction
  will therefore lead to an accumulation of succinate, which inhibits prolyl hydroxylases
  (PHD) and subsequently leads to the stabilization of HIF-1a. The stabilization of
  the latter also occurs a number of steps downstream of dysfunctional PTEN signaling.
  It is interesting to note that activated Akt (P-Akt) can increase ATP levels that
  result in increased ROS, presumably via mitochondrial dysfunctional signaling. This
  is postulated to set up a double feedback loop linking both the PTEN and SDH pathways.
