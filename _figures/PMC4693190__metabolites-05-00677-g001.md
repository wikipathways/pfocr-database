caption: Prostaglandin biosynthesis pathways. (A) In the Cox pathway, phospholipase
  A2 cleaves arachidonic acid (AA) from the sn-2 position of phospholipids like PI,
  generating lysoPI species lacking AA. PGF2α is synthesized from free AA by the sequential
  actions of Cox and prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS); (B) In C. elegans, C20 PUFAs
  are delivered to oocytes in yolk lipoprotein complexes. Yolk PUFAs are primarily
  found esterified to PC and PE, and in free forms. An incompletely understood metabolic
  pathway in oocytes, shown arbitrarily as steps A, B, and C, converts yolk lipids
  into F-series prostaglandins, such as ent-PGF2α (or a co-eluting stereoisomer).
  I, inositol; C, choline; E, ethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine;
  C20, 20-carbon.
