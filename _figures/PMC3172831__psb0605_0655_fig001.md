caption: Proposed models for CrRLK-dependent signaling pathways in plant cells. Identified
  components of the pathway are shown in black/color and putative/proposed ones in
  gray. (A) In root hairs, FER is activated by a yet unidentified ligand. This activation
  recruits ROPGEF1 that in turn activates the RAC/ROP protein. RAC/ROP activation
  leads to a series of downstream events including the activation of the NADPH oxidase
  (NOX) that stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS, possibly acting
  together with other cellular pathways mediated by other RAC/ROP effectors such as
  RICs (ROP interactive CRIB motif-containing proteins), and ICR1 (Interactor of constitutive
  active ROPs), regulate root hair polar growth. (B) Model for the pollen tube-synergid
  cell interaction. In the elongating pollen tube ANX1/ANX2 signaling is necessary
  to support polar growth. We propose that ANX1/ANX2 activate RAC/ROP signaling pathways
  as is the case in root hairs and this will in turn activate many downstream effectors
  and ROS production essential for the maintenance of polar growth. On the synergid
  cell side, FER is inactive and synergid cell integrity is maintained. Upon pollen
  tube arrival, FER is activated leading to synergid cell degeneration and this may
  be mediated by RAC/ROP-dependent ROS production. In addition, FER triggers the relocalization
  of NTA from the endomembrane system to the cell membrane. This might promote the
  release of signals or extracellular matrix material and could be mediated by ICR1
  through the activation of RAC/ROP signaling. One possible scenario is that ANX1/ANX2
  and FER compete for the same ligands; upon pollen tube arrival, FER sequesters the
  ligand, preventing ANX1/ANX2 activity causing pollen tube rupture. Another possibility
  is that activated FER triggers a signaling cascade leading to the release of a signal
  that causes pollen tube rupture. (C) Model for the role of FER during fungal hyphae
  infection. FER regulates hyphae penetration possibly through the activation of MLO
  proteins and the inhibition of ROS production through a yet unknown mechanism.

  description: Proposed models for CrRLK-dependent signaling pathways in plant cells.
    Identified components of the pathway are shown in black/color and putative/proposed
    ones in gray. (A) In root hairs, FER is activated by a yet unidentified ligand.
    This activation recruits ROPGEF1 that in turn activates the RAC/ROP protein. RAC/ROP
    activation leads to a series of downstream events including the activation of
    the NADPH oxidase (NOX) that stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
    ROS, possibly acting together with other cellular pathways mediated by other RAC/ROP
    effectors such as RICs (ROP interactive CRIB motif-containing proteins), and ICR1
    (Interactor of constitutive active ROPs), regulate root hair polar growth. (B)
    Model for the pollen tube-synergid cell interaction. In the elongating pollen
    tube ANX1/ANX2 signaling is necessary to support polar growth. We propose that
    ANX1/ANX2 activate RAC/ROP signaling pathways as is the case in root hairs and
    this will in turn activate many downstream effectors and ROS production essential
    for the maintenance of polar growth. On the synergid cell side, FER is inactive
    and synergid cell integrity is maintained. Upon pollen tube arrival, FER is activated
    leading to synergid cell degeneration and this may be mediated by RAC/ROP-dependent
