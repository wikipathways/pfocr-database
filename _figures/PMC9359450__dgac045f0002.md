caption: 'Structure-function relationship of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) informing RTK/GPCR
  dualism. IGF-IR is annotated with numbered aa residues. Known key residues/sites
  of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) as determinant substrates/adaptor protein
  binding within β-subunit, thus controlling both canonical RTK signaling (left) and
  noncanonical GPCR-like signaling. IGF-IR kinase-dependent signaling pathways: IGF-I
  (or IGF-II) binding to IGF-IR promotes intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation.
  Activated receptor can recruit and phosphorylate substrates such as IRS and Shc.
  Phosphorylated tyrosine 950 within Asn-Pro-X-Tyr juxta membrane motif is essential
  for insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1)/IRS-2 and SHC-transforming protein (Shc)
  recruitment. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS and Shc proteins leads to as Grb2 and
  PI 3-kinase (p110/p85) binding. These protein associations induce downstream signaling
  activation, primarily through the rat sarcoma virus/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways,
  which in turn activate transcription factors coordinating downstream IGF biological
  effects. In addition to kinase signaling, agonist-induced IGF-IR stimulation results
  in noncanonical GPCR signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins (α, β, γ) (? = not
  yet fully understood pathways), followed by rapid IGF-IR phosphorylation by G protein-coupled
  receptor kinases (GRKs, K2, K6) at serine residues within the C-terminus. Serine-phosphorylated
  receptors present high-affinity binding sites for multifunctional adaptor protein
  β-arrestin 1/2 (βarr1/2). βarr recruitment: βarr acquires an active conformation
  following IGF-IR binding with MAPK pathway scaffold components. These events result
  in second wave IGF-IR kinase-dependent MAPK/ERK signaling activation. Abbreviations:
  Akt, protein kinase B; ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase; IGF-IR, IGF receptor;
  P = major phosphorylation sites; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; MEK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase/Erk kinase; Shc, Src homology and collagen domain protein.'
