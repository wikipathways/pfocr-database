caption: The multiple possible means of molecular cross-talk between melatonin and
  exosome synthesis machinery are summarized here. Irrespective of melatonin how melatonin
  enters cells, it activates PI3K/Akt complex and inhibits GSK-3β, leading to fusion
  of secretory vesicles with plasma membrane and exocytosis. However, the underlying
  mechanisms have not been fully established. Changes in plasma membrane fluidity
  by an alteration of fatty acid composition (unsaturated/saturate fatty acid ratio)
  facilitate the exosome release. Also, melatonin promotes specific GTPases including
  Rab7 and 11 which accelerate the fusion of late MVBs with the plasma membrane. Upon
  binding of melatonin to MT1, the melatonin-MT1 complex is transferred to the early
  endosomes via vacuolar sorting machinery such as Rab5. The activation of Rab7 and
  11 promotes endosomal secretion and recycles MT1 to the plasma membrane. Further
  activation of Rab7 directs endosomes with MT1 toward lysosomes which regulate the
  innate cell response to melatonin. How Rab 7 determines the fate of endosomes with
  melatonin (secretion or enzymatic digestion) needs further explorations. The interplay
  between melatonin and autophagy signaling pathway also influences the activity of
  exosome molecular machinery. Melatonin stimulates autophagic response directly via
  the activation of ATG4, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 16 and increases the LC3II/I ratio. These
  features promote the formation of autophagolysosomes and autophagic exocytosis.
  Melatonin enhances the autophagic machinery including LC3, ATG3, 5, 12, and 16L
  on the late endosome membrane that facilitates the fusion of these elements with
  the plasma membrane. Melatonin also increases the intersection of autophagic vacuoles
  and exosomes into compartments named amphisomes which have multiple fates. Amphisomes
  can fuse with lysosomes via the activation of P62. The activity of Rab8 and 27a
  initiates the autophagic release of amphisomes to the ECM. GSK-3, glycogen synthase
  kinase 3; ATG, autophagy-related protein; P62, sequestosome 1; LC3, microtubule-associated
  protein 1A/1B-light chain 3; and PI3K/Akt, Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Protein
  kinase B.
