caption: Notch, Esg and Pdm1 are part of a transcriptional network with negative feedback
  that controls stem cell identity and differentiation in the adult midgut. Esg acts
  in the ISC to repress expression of differentiation genes such as Pdm1 and maintains
  expression of stem cell-associated genes such as Egfr and miranda. Simultaneously,
  growth factors such as Upd cytokines and EGFR ligands from ECs control ISC mitosis
  and Jak/STAT and EGFR pathway activity in both ISC and EB. The combined activity
  of the Notch and Jak/STAT pathways is required for differentiation gene expression
  to initiate in the EB. This results in the downregulation of Esg upon differentiation,
  through the action of specific differentiation genes such as Pdm1 (in ECs). Under
  “quiescent” conditions (top), growth factor activity is low and differentiation
  does not occur. When EC stress requires regeneration (bottom), high Jak/STAT and
  EGFR pathway activity promotes ISC mitosis, and EB differentiation is promoted through
  the combinatorial action of Delta-Notch and Jak/STAT signaling. Only after the differentiation
  factor Pdm1 is activated, Esg is finally repressed.
