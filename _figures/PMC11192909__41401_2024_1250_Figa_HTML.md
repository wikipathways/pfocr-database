caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of NGR1 in alleviating colitis. DSS caused
  widespread mucosal inflammation epithelial injury. This was manifested by the decreased
  expression of tight junction proteins, reduced mucus production in goblet cells,
  and increased intestinal permeability in colitis mice. Additionally, Lgr5+ ISCs
  were in obviously deficiency in colitis mice, with aberrant down-regulation of the
  Wnt/β-Catenin signaling. However, NGR1 amplified the expression of the ISC marker
  Lgr5, elevated the expression of genes associated with ISC differentiation, enhanced
  the incorporation of BrdU in the crypt and promoted epithelial restoration to alleviate
  DSS-induced colitis in mice, at least partially, by activating the Wnt/β-Catenin
  signaling pathway
