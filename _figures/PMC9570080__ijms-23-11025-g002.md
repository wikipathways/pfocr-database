caption: CaMKKβ/2 activation mechanism and immunohistochemical localization in the
  rat brain. (A) Sagittal section of the adult rat brain immunostained with a monoclonal
  antibody against CaMKKβ/2 (reproduced from Ref. [], with permission from John Wiley
  and Sons). CA1 and CA3, CA1 and CA3 subregions of Ammon’s horn of the hippocampus;
  Cb, cerebellar cortex; CP, caudate putamen; Cx, cerebral cortex; DG, dentate gyrus;
  MO, medulla oblongata; OB, olfactory bulb; Pn, pontine nuclei; SNr, substantia nigra
  pars reticulata; Th, thalamus; and Tu, olfactory tubercle. Scale bar = 2.5 mm. (B)
  Proposed model of activation mechanism of CaMKKβ/2. CaMKKβ/2 is constitutively active,
  exhibiting Ca2+/CaM-independent activity (60–70% of total activity), attributable
  to the N-terminal regulatory segment (residues 129–151, C) [,]. CaMKKβ/2 exhibits
  increased autonomous activity, caused, at least in part, by intramolecular autophosphorylation
  at Thr482, resulting in partial disruption of the autoinhibitory mechanism []. Phosphorylation
  at multiple sites in CaMKKβ/2 by CDK5 and GSK3 [], activated AMPK [] or PKA [],
  likely disrupting the N-terminal regulatory function to generate autonomous activity,
  thereby holding the inactive kinase in the absence of Ca2+/CaM, in agreement with
  the finding that CaMKKβ/2-AMPK pathway activation requires Ca2+/CaM signaling [,,].
  (C) Amino acid sequence alignment of the N-terminal regulatory segment in rat and
  human CaMKKβ/2. CDK5/GSK3 phosphorylate human CaMKKβ/2 at Ser129, Ser133, and Ser137
  []. Activated AMPK and PKA phosphorylate Thr144 in rat CaMKKβ/2 [,]. Modified from
  Ref. [].
