caption: Top network of metastasis virulence biomarkers (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  Knowledge Base). The gene expression data from individual mammary tumor samples
  were ordered such that 25% (33 samples) of the total samples came from mice with
  no surface- or section-metastatic lesions and the longest tumor onset. Gene expression
  data from these 33 samples served as the reference group when paired with the gene
  expression data of 33 mammary tumor samples from mice that had the most sectional
  metastatic lesions detected (AMD66), and when paired with the gene expression data
  of 33 mammary tumor samples from mice that had the most superficial metastatic lesions
  detected (MET66). The differential expression of genes common to both the AMD66
  and MET66 analyses was further restricted to genes expressed in human adipose or
  breast to define the set of metastasis virulence biomarkers. Gene networks depict
  the direct physical (solid) or indirect (dashed) interactions of molecules and genes’
  products, including those genes not identified as significant on the microarrays,
  thus networks are ranked such that the highest ranked network contains the highest
  number of significantly expressed genes. Red nodes denote significant upregulation
  in high virulent mammary tumors relative to non-virulent mammary tumors (Q < 0.05).
  Green nodes denote significant downregulation in high virulent mammary tumors relative
  to non-virulent mammary tumors (Q < 0.05)
