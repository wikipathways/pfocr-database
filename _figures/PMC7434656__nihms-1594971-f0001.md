caption: RAAS consists of two parallel axes, representing the classical and alternative
  signaling pathways. The classical RAAS includes angiotensinogen that is converted
  into angiotensin I by the action of renin. Angiotensin I is subsequently converted
  into angiotensin II (AngII) by the action of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE).
  The classical RAAS induces its pro-fibrotic actions by activating the angiotensin
  II type 1 receptor (AT1R). The alternative RAAS axis comprises angiotensin-(1–9),
  angiotensin-(1–7) and alamandine (Amdn), generated by decarboxylation (DeCxn) of
  angiotensin-(1–7) or step-wise conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin A by
  decarboxylation followed by processing by ACE2. The alternative RAAS pathway exerts
  anti-fibrotic actions through the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R), Mas receptor
  (MasR) and Mas-related GPCR, member D (MrgD). Angiotensin I can also be converted
  to angiotensin-(1–7) by the action of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) or prolylendopeptidase
  (PEP).
