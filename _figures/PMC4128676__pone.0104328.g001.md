caption: The transcription factor (TF) gene A is transcribed and translated into the
  TF protein product that in turn is converted to the active end-product. The end-product
  (or its oligomer as in case of lacI repressor negative-feedback-only system that
  was constructed in reference ) is the key molecule that locates the respective cis-regulatory
  elements associated with the promoter of TF gene A through a combination of one-dimensional
  (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) routes as that of typical site-specific DNA-protein
  interactions. Here either monomers of the end-product directly assemble at the corresponding
  regulatory elements in a combinatorial manner (I) or the fully-formed complex of
  na-mer binds with the respective regulatory sites (II). Assembly of combinatorial
  TF molecules results in the looping of DNA segment that is present in between the
  promoter and cis-regulatory elements. ARPC is the assembled repressor-promoter complex
  that in turn results in down-regulation. Our analysis shows that out of these two
  competing pathways, the pathway I is the most probable one since it takes shortest
  time. The corresponding set of differential equations is given in Eqs (4–5). This
  system is well characterized by parameters of Group I, II and III. Group I consists
  of parameters  whereas Group II consists of equilibrium parameters  and Group III
  consists of ordinary type perturbation parameters . Most of the earlier studies
  assumed zero values to Group II parameters apart from assuming zero for  that controls
  the promoter state dynamics. Blue colored spheres are the dimers of lac repressor.
