caption: Working Model for the Role of REGγ in SpermatogenesisREGγ suppresses p53
  through regulation of proteasomal degradation. In the absence of p53, negative regulation
  of the Plzf promoter by p53 is also absent. Plzf is transcribed and PLZF can function
  in germ cell development. REGγ deficiency leads to the defect of germ cell development
  and male subfertility. Mechanistically, REGγ loss results in the accumulation of
  p53 protein by disruption of REGγ-mediated p53 protein degradation; this subsequently
  leads to the decreased expression of PLZF through p53 direct inhibition at the transcriptional
  level. The REGγ-p53-PLZF regulatory pathway provides a new mechanism to understand
  the role of REGγ in the regulation of spermatogenesis.
