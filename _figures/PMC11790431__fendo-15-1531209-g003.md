caption: Possible mechanisms of IMS32 cell death under high-glucose and pyruvate-starved
  conditions. Deprivation of exogenous pyruvate reduces TCA cycle intermediates and
  mitochondrial ATP production, subsequently inhibiting glycolytic flux. Furthermore,
  enhanced activity of PARP under these conditions contributes to the suppression
  of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity. This cascade results
  in the inhibition of glycolysis and a metabolic shift toward collateral pathways
