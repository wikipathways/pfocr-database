caption: A model for srGAP2 action in thrombin-mediated vascular permeability. Binding
  of thrombin to the PAR1 receptor leads to activation of the small GTPase Gα12, which
  then triggers activation of RhoA via GEF activation. RhoA drives phosphorylation
  of MLC to increase the force of actinomyosin contraction, which then leads to retraction
  of the cell. In the model, srGAP2 controls the inactivation of this thrombin-induced
  RhoA signal, limiting the extent of gap opening and allowing the respreading phase
  where junctions can be reformed. It is unclear whether PAR1 signaling leads to activation
  of srGAP2, or whether srGAP2 is a constitutively active factor in this pathway.
