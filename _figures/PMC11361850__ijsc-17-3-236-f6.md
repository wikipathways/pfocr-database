caption: The mechanism by which mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (MSCs-Exos)
  promotes axonal growth and neuronal regeneration. MSCs-Exos can promote axonal growth
  by promoting M2 macrophage polarization by inhibiting the NF-κb/NLRP3 signaling
  pathway. MSCs-Exos with miR-199a-3p/145-5p can target Cblb/Cbl mRNAs to inhibit
  the NGF/TrkA pathway to promote axonal growth. Human placenta (HP)-MSCs-Exos can
  promote neuronal regeneration by activating the MEK/ERK/CREB signaling pathway.
  MSCs-Exos could attenuate R-Smad 6 expression to promote neuronal regeneration by
  carrying TGFβ. MSCs-Exos with miR-let-7a-5p downregulated SMAD2 expression by inhibiting
  HMGA2 to promote neuronal regeneration
