caption: TNFR1-induced-signalling pathway. Cartoon depicting the TNFR1-induced-signalling
  pathway. Upon binding of TNF to TNFR1, a membrane-bound complex referred to as complex-I
  forms. This complex is characterised by the presence of adaptor proteins (e.g.,
  TRADD, TRAF2, SPATA2, TAB1/2 and NAP1/TANK1), E3 ligases (e.g., cIAP1/2 and LUBAC),
  which conjugate poly-ubiquitin chains of different topology (i.e., K63, K48, K11
  and M1) to different proteins of the complex, the deubiquitinases (DUBs) A20 and
  CYLD, and protein kinases such as RIPK1, IKK1/2, TAK1 and TBK1/IKKε. Complex-I promotes
  the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs that in turn mediate the expression of pro-survival
  as well as pro-inflammatory genes. Under certain circumstances, a secondary cytoplasmic
  complex originates in the cytosol from complex-I, referred to as complex-II. This
  complex is composed of FADD, cFLIP, Caspase-8, RIPK1 and RIPK3. Caspase-8 can trigger
  apoptosis via activation of Caspase-3 or, in some cell type, pyroptosis, via cleavage
  of Gasdermin D. Upon Caspase-8 inhibition by the means of synthetic- or viral-encoded
  caspase inhibitor, RIPK1 activates RIPK3 that in turn phosphorylates MLKL that undergoes
  activation and executes necroptosis. Of note, OTULIN, XIAP and MK2, have important
  regulatory functions in the TNFR1-signalling pathway, despite they are not directly
  recruited to complex-I or complex-II. OTULIN regulates the availability of the LUBAC
  components for their recruitment to complex-I. XIAP controls RIPK1 ubiquitination
  status outside complex-II and potentially its cytotoxic activity. MK2, by phosphorylating
  RIPK1, modulates its killing activity.
