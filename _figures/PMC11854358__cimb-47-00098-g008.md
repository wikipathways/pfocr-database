caption: The analysis of cell cycle pathways and differentially expressed genes because
  of different levels of PFESA-BP2 exposure. (A) A heat map of cell cycle pathways
  across all 4 PFESA-BP2 doses (in mg/kg-day) as generated by Qiagen IPA. Pathways
  with z-scores ≤ −1.5 were categorized as inhibited (blue) and z-scores ≥ 1.5 as
  activated (orange). (B) Diverse mechanisms are considered for the involvement of
  transcription factor MYC in cell cycle activation as a result of PFESA-BP2 exposure.
  Proposed mechanisms involve the overexpression of genes (indicated in green) involved
  in DNA replication in the S phase, phosphorylation of substrates associated with
  transition to mitosis, mitotic spindle attachment and formation, and contractile
  ring formation. Other mechanisms also involve the inhibition of genes (indicated
  in red) in the G1 phase involved in growth arrest, growth factor signal inhibition,
  and apoptosis
