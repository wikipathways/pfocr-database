caption: Schematic of accelerated tissue regeneration pathway via the dynamic and
  adaptive HMGB1–CXCL12–CXCR4–GAlert axis. The CXCL12–CXCR4 axis is known to maintain
  stem cell quiescence. The highly conserved alarmin, HMGB1, when released following
  injury or administered in its fully reduced state, forms a heterocomplex with CXCL12,
  which then binds to CXCR4, to transition resident stem cells to GAlert. Stem cells
  remain in this primed state for at least 2 wk, and when they are exposed to activating
  factors, such as those released following current or future injury, the cells in
  GAlert enter the cell cycle faster than cells in G0. This results in accelerated
  regeneration of multiple tissues.
