caption: A. Depletion of the C4-demethylating enzymes (SC4MOL and NSDHL) results in
  accumulation of meiosis activating sterols (MAS) abundantly present in gonads. MAS
  influences endocytosis of surface receptors (e.g. EGFR) by promoting shuttling of
  the internalized EGFR to late endosomes for degradation which may be important for
  EGFR targeting in cancer and developmental defects in the hereditary cholesterol
  pathway gene deficiencies (). B. Some endogenously generated oxysterols (e.g. 22-R-hydroxycholesterol,
  25-hydroxycholesterol) bind to LXR/RXR heterodimeric nuclear receptors. LXR induces
  expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 efflux pumps, and cholesterol conversion to bile acids
  via CYP7A1 (, ). LXR also promotes LDL receptor degradation via increased endocytosis
  and ubiquitin ligation by IDOL E3 ligase (). C. A complex of EBP and DHCR7 known
  as ChEH, cholesterol epoxide hydrolase, disposes of toxic cholesterol epoxides and
  promotes growth of tumors cells. Contrastingly, in normal tissues, cholesterol epoxides
  react with histamine to produce dendrogenin A which promotes cell differentiation
  and suppresses cell growth (, , ).
