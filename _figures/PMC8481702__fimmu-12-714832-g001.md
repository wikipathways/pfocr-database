caption: Composition and mechanism of immunological tolerance of MSC-EVs in systemic
  lupus erythematosus. MSC-EVs are spheroidal shaped and two-layer lipid particles
  containing various types of protein, lipids, DNAs, non-coding RNAs, miRNAs, and
  mRNA, which cause genetic information exchange by various of signal pathway and
  reprogramming of the recipient cell. MSC-EVs can suppress the differentiation and
  proliferation of B cell by PI3K-AKT pathway, and reduce production of IL-10. Similarly,
  T cells play the suspensive role on the proliferation and maturation, while reduce
  production of Th17 and Th1, and improve function of Treg and Th2 through the TGF-β/NF-κB
  pathway. EVs can suppress the proliferation and maturation of DCs and induce tolerable
  DCs with low expression of costimulatory makers. Macrophages can transform to anti-inflammatory
  M2 phenotype after treating by MSC-EVs through the PI3K/AKT pathway. EVs can suppress
  the proliferation, differentiation and cytotoxicity of NK cells in a TGF-β dependent
  manner. MSC-EVs play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases,
  including SLE, graft versus host disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,
  etc.
