caption: 'Simplified diagram of the main metabolic pathways involved in DNA damage/repair.
  Nucleotide pool: nucleotide precursor ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) is generated from
  the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP). Purines and pyrimidines precursors, inosine
  monophosphate (IMP), and uridine monophosphate (UMP), respectively are synthesized
  from glutamine, and aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate, respectively. Redox homeostasis:
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is generated from the PPP and
  the serine synthesis pathway. Glutathione (GSH) is generated from cysteine and glutamate.
  Chromatin remodeling: methyl-group donors (CH3) are generated from the S-adenosyl
  methionine (SAM) pathway and acetyl-group donors (acetyl coenzyme A) are generated
  from the citrate cycle or from acetate. GLUT-1, glucose transporter 1; SCL1A5, alanine,
  serine, cysteine-preferring transporter 2 (ASCT2); G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; GA3P,
  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; SAH, S-adenosyl homocysteine; xCT, cystine-glutamate
  antiporter; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter family.'
