caption: Proposed model for activation of the ATR-p53-p21 pathway induced by increasing
  the amount of PCs that contain polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane phospholipids.
  Under physiological conditions, the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in cell-membranous
  PCs in are precisely regulated by a iPLA2-mediated deacylation and reacylation cycle.
  Inhibition of iPLA2 results in an increase of phospholipids that contain polyunsaturated
  fatty acids, which may alter the fluidity of cell membranes especially nuclear envelopes.
  This leads to activation of the ATR-p53-p21 signalling pathway to prevent cells
  from entering the S phase of the cell cycle. In the absence of p21, the alteration
  in membrane phospholipids leads to apoptosis (). PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids;
  SFA, saturated fatty acids; LysoPC, lysophosphatidylcholine.

  fatty acid residues induces phosphorylation of p53 through activation of ATR.
