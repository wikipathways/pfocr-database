caption: Methylotrophic substrates such as methanol (CH3OH) or dimethylsulfide (DMS,
  CH3-S-CH3) enter the methanogenic pathway via S-methylation of coenzyme M (CoM)
  and subsequently disproportionate to methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2; metabolic
  flux is shown as blue arrows). Notably, the first step in oxidation of CH3-CoM to
  CO2 is the energy-requiring transfer of the methyl moiety to generate methyl-tetrahydrosarcinapterin
  (CH3-H4SPt). In contrast, acetic acid (CH3COOH) enters the pathway at the CH3-H4SPt
  level, followed by reduction to CH4 (green arrows). Thus, the second step of the
  pathway is exergonic.
