caption: Proposed model indicating roles of UmPde1 and UmPde2 in the cAMP signaling
  pathway. A morphogenic switch is regulated by the PKA pathway via several components.
  Adenylate cyclase (Uac1) is activated by Gα-protein in response to environmental
  cues and converts ATP into cAMP. The cAMP binds with the regulatory subunit of PKA
  (Ubc1) causing it to dissociate from the catalytic PKA subunit. The active, derepressed
  catalytic subunit of PKA (Adr1) then targets downstream transcription factors and
  other proteins. UmPde1 and UmPde2 function to convert cAMP into AMP. This activity
  leads to continued repression of PKA activity due to Adr1 repression by Ubc1. Solid
  lines indicate known components of the pathway. The dashed line indicates a putative
  feedback regulation of UmPde1 and UmPde2 by phosphorylation through activated PKA.
  White squares of Ubc1 indicate unbound cAMP binding sites.
