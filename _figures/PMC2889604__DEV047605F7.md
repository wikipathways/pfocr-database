caption: Model for the regulation of neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth by the
  MRTF/Srf pathway. MRTFs are essential mediators of Srf signaling in the mouse brain
  and key regulators of the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Together with Srf,
  MRTFs regulate the expression of β-actin and other actin-binding proteins, such
  as gelsolin. In addition, activation of MRTF/Srf signaling regulates the expression
  of the Pctaire1 kinase, which is involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth.
  Under normal conditions, the MRTF/Srf pathway regulates the activity of Cdk5, which
  phosphorylates and inactivates Pak1. Decreased Pak1 activity results in diminished
  LimK activity towards phosphorylation of cofilin, resulting in increased actin severing.
  Genetic ablation of MRTFs in the mouse brain disrupts actin dynamics by disrupting
  the expression and/or activity of actin and the actin-severing proteins gelsolin
  and cofilin, resulting in defective neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth.
