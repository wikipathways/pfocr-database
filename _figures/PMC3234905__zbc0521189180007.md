caption: A model for JH and ILP regulation of Vg synthesis. After adult emergence,
  JH III titers increase and induce expression of genes coding for ILP2 and ILP3 in
  the fat body and the brain. The ILPs then work through the insulin-like peptide
  signaling pathway to phosphorylate FOXO, resulting in expression of Vg genes. Feeding
  increases amino acid concentration and turn on production of ILP3 through most likely
  the TOR pathway. The ILP3 then induces expression of Vg genes through insulin-like
  peptide signaling pathway and FOXO. Thus, both JH and feeding function through the
  insulin-like peptide signaling pathway and regulate expression of genes coding for
  Vg. JHRE, JH response element; CA, corpora allata; FHRE, Forkhead response element;
  SRC, steroid receptor co-activator; TORC1, target of rapamycin complex 1; IPC, insulin-like
  peptide producing cell.
