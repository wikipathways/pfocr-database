caption: Proposed pathway for Gβγ-induced TE retraction. Activation of Gi-coupled
  GPCRs induces the heterotrimer dissociation, resulting in GαGTP and free Gβγ. Gβγ
  simultaneously induces activation of multiple effectors and, thus, several signaling
  pathways with distinct functionalities. In addition to its roles in the LE, free
  Gβγ controls TE retraction by deactivating MLCP through the activation of the RhoA
  pathway and activating MLCK through PLCβ-induced calcium mobilization. Both of these
  mechanisms result in an increase in phosphorylated MLC, promoting actomyosin contractility
  and subsequent retraction of the TE.
papertitle: Two independent but synchronized Gβγ subunit–controlled pathways are essential
  for trailing-edge retraction during macrophage migration.
