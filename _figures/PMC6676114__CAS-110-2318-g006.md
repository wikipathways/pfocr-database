caption: RNA MODOMICS and heterogeneity of tumors. In response to the upstream signals,
  including epidermal growth factors, one‐carbon metabolism serves a critical role
  in mitochondrial biogenesis through methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (Mthfd)
  and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (Shmt). Polyamine flows including metabolites,
  ornithine, spermidine, and spermine regulate the methylation reaction. The mitochondrial
  metabolites control α‐ketoglutarate/2‐oxoglutarate dioxygenase (Alkbh) and iron
  (II)‐dependent dioxygenase, histone lysine demethylase (KDM), and ten‐eleven translocation
  methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET), which catalyzes the conversion of the modified
  DNA base 5‐methylcytosine to 5‐hydroxymethylcytosine, prolyl hydroxylase domain
  enzymes, an enzyme involved in the hypoxia‐inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathways.
  ALKBH5 demethylates specifically by oxidative demethylation m6A RNA, the most prevalent
  internal modification of mRNA in higher eukaryotes. m6A is involved in the RNA splicing
  by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) that are known as splicing factors.
  YT521‐B homology 6‐methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) recognizes m6A
  and binds the mRNA's 3′UTR. YHTDF1 recruits the eIF4 family and induces protein
  translation, which is regulated by the Akt‐mTORC1 pathway. m6A markings are also
  involved in the P‐body decay by YTHDF2. These mechanisms are altered in tumors to
  various levels and contribute to the heterogeneity of tumors. ALKBH5, α‐ketoglutarate‐dependent
