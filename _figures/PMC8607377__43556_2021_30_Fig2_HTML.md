caption: The origin of CSCs. Genetic mutations generate CSCs from tissue resident
  stem cells or differentiated cells. CSCs can be generated also by cell fusion between
  normal and cancer cells. Hypoxia induces cancer non-stem cells to display CSC phenotypes
  by activating hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) or signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (STAT)3 pathway. Moreover, the interaction between cancer and stromal
  cells produces various cytokines to activate STAT3/nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathways
  in both cancer and stromal cells, thereby driving CSC generation from non-CSC populations.
  Furthermore, CSCs are generated from non-CSC population by the action of a number
  of EMT-inducing transcription factors such as TWIST, SNAIL, ZEB1, and ZEB2
