caption: Effect of colonization with P. indica on the expression of genes within the
  flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Red colored squares indicate genes upregulated in
  the comparison of control versus P. indica; blue colored squares indicate down-regulated
  genes in this comparison. Homologs in Arabidopsis of all upregulated and downregulated
  soybean genes were mapped to the Arabidopsis KEGG pathway for flavonoid biosynthesis–.
  Enzyme Commission (EC) codes colored in green boxes represent enzymatic steps present
  in soybean. While several steps early in the pathway are downregulated, genes in
  steps leading to biosynthesis of luteolin (purple box) and quercetin (pink box)
  are upregulated.
