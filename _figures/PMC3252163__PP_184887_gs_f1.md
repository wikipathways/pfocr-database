caption: 'Examples of network structures in which a channel between two metabolites
  provides an alternative route to a conventional pathway. A, Orientation conserved
  metabolism of a symmetric molecule containing two carbon atoms (A) running in parallel
  with a pathway in which A is released into the bulk medium before conversion to
  B. If A is derived from an asymmetrically labeled precursor then the orientation
  of the labeling may be preserved during the conversion of A to B in the channel;
  whereas if A is released into the bulk medium before conversion to B, the position
  of the label will be randomized. It follows that the observed labeling in B, and
  in metabolites derived from it, will reflect the relative fluxes through the channeled
  (vchan) and unchanneled (v2a and v2b) pathways. B, Example of orientation conserved
  transfer that might occur in the TCA cycle: The asymmetry in the labeling (*) of
  fumarate is maintained in the channeled pathway but lost in the unchanneled pathway.
  C, Scheme in which a channeled flux provides a direct route between molecules A
  and C, avoiding potential changes in the labeling of B and C via the contribution
  of vmix. D, Example of a metabolic bypass that might occur in glycolysis: Synthesis
  of phosphoenolpyruvate via the channel bypasses the contribution of the plastidic
  triose phosphate pool (pGA3P) to the labeling of the cytosolic triose phosphate
  pool (cGA3P). In each scheme, the labeling of the products of the competing pathways
  depends on the relative flux through the two pathways. White circles = unlabeled
  carbon atoms; shaded circles = labeled carbon atoms.'
