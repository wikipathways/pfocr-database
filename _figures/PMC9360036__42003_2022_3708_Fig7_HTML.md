caption: 'MAP4K4 is activated downstream of RTK signaling and exerts both pro-invasive
  and anti-proliferative activities in MB cells. Invasion regulation: STRN3 cooperates
  with MAP4K4 to control cell migration, invasion, and actin cytoskeleton remodeling,
  independently from PP2A activity. This cooperation of MAP4K4 and STRN3 is necessary
  for the FGFR-induced activation of motility-associated effectors nPKCs and VASP.
  Proliferation regulation: MAP4K4 causes LATS1/2 phosphorylation, which promotes
  the activation of the Hippo pathway. Hippo pathway activation results in the phosphorylation
  and degradation of the transcriptional regulator YAP. The consequent repression
  of YAP transcriptional activity leads to a proliferation arrest. STRN3 promotes
  PP2A-mediated inactivation of MAP4K4 function toward Hippo activation, resulting
  in an increase of YAP transcriptional activity and cell proliferation.'
