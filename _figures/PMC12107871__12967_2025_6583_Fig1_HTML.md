caption: 'Schematic representation of the inflammatory signaling mechanisms underlying
  cancer development mediated by the NF-kB signaling pathway. The canonical pathway
  involves the activation of signaling pathways by pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors
  (TNFR, IL-1R, TLR), antigen receptors (BCR), and growth factors (EGFR family). These
  receptors have the ability to trigger the IKK complex, composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and
  IKKγ (NF-κB, a master regulator (NEMO)). This complex phosphorylates and promotes
  ubiquitination of IκB, leading to its destruction by the proteasome. After translocation
  into the nucleus, p65 (RelA)/p50 dimers initiate target gene expression. The cytosolic
  RelB/p100 complex is inactive, but there is no IκB in the non-canonical pathway.
  Signals from CD40L, LTβR, and BAFFR trigger activation of NIK. These signals phosphorylate
  the IKKα/IKKα homodimer, subsequently translocating the phosphate group to p100
  C-terminal residues, where it is ubiquitinated and proteasome-transformed to p52.
  Translocation of RelB/p52 to the nuclear level and increased expression of the target
  gene constitute the primary endpoints. Both the canonical and non-canonical NF-kB
  pathways have been identified as intracellular signaling pathways responsible for
  inflammation-mediated tumors. Abbreviations: BAFF, B-cell activating factor; BCL-2,
