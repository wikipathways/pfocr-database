caption: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mediation in the anti-inflammatory
  and neuroprotective response of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone/melanocortin 4
  receptor α-MSH/MC4R against damage produced by excessive alcohol consumption. Ethanol
  intake increases hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) release into the blood
  (1); TNF-α is then transported across the blood-brain-barrier to glial cells and
  signals through Tumor necrosis factor receptor/Nuclear factor-κB (TNFR/NF-κB), inducing
  the expression of inflammation mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α itself (2);
  these proinflammatory cytokines produce neuronal damage and reduce neurogenesis.
  The glial-secreted TNF-α binds to TNFR, creating an activation loop that potentiates
  the initial neuroinflammation response (3). Additionally, ethanol-generated reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) activates NF-κB directly, exacerbating the inflammatory damage
  (4). α-MSH/MC4R signaling induces BDNF expression (5), and BDNF inhibits NF-κB activity
  (6) thus inhibiting the neuroinflammatory response. In addition, BDNF secreted by
  glial cells acts in neurons through its TrkB receptor (7), signaling through MAPK/ERK
  and PLCγ/IP3 pathways (8) which in turn activate CREB, leading to increased neurogenesis
  and enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP). Additionally, BDNF/TrkB signaling activates
  PI3K/Akt pathway which inhibits the pro-apoptotic protein Bad, increasing neuronal
  survival (9). Ethanol decreases the activity of the central melanocortins system,
  reducing α-MSH levels and therefore MC4R activity (10); thereby, BDNF expression
  is downregulated averting its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities.
