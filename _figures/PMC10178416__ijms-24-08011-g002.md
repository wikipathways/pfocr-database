caption: 'A schematic drawing presenting signaling pathways affected by ferulic acid.
  (A) Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in cytoplasm by keap1. Ferulic
  acid (FA) induces the translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and
  promotes the expression of Nrf2, which activates antioxidant response element (ARE)
  and increases transcription of Nrf2-regulated genes, such as HO-1. FA activates
  the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, exerting an anti-oxidative effect. (B) The process of activating
  p38 MAPK and NF-κB signal cascades through TLR4 signaling, leading to the expression
  of inflammatory cytokines. NF-κB signaling requires IKK subunits, which regulate
  pathway activation through IκB phosphorylation. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is
  activated by cytokines and STATs are dephosphorylated in the nucleus, leading to
  the activation of downstream inflammatory cytokines. FA acts as an anti-inflammatory
  agent by inhibiting the p38 MAPK, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT pathways. (C) FA can block
  the activation of TGF-β1/Smads signaling and reverse the nuclear translocation of
  Smads to resist fibrosis. Furthermore, FA has the ability to alleviate ECM by regulating
  MMPs. (D) FA promotes tumor regression and cell apoptosis by increasing the expression
  of p53 and Bax, while inhibiting proliferation by decreasing the expression of ERK
  and AKT. AKT: protein kinase B; Bax: Bcl2-associated X protein; ECM: extracellular
  matrix; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HO-1: heme oxygenase-1; IκB:
  inhibitor of NF-κB; IKK: IkappaB kinase; JAK: Janus kinase; Keap1: Kelch-like-ECH-associated
  protein 1; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MMPs: matrix metalloproteinases;
  NF-κB: nuclear factor-kappaB; Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2;
  Smads: small mothers against decapentaplegics; STAT: signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; TGF-β1: transforming growth factor-β1; TLR4: toll-like receptor
