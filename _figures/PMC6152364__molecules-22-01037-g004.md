caption: The relation between mammalian MAPK cascades and other kinases capable to
  induce cell responses involved in cancer. In MAPKs controlled signal transduction
  pathways after an extracellular stimuli transduced by a membrane receptor, the signal
  is conducted downstream by two kinases (MAPKKK and MAPKK) that finally arrives to
  a MAPK resulting in very functionally distinct responses (left part of the image).
  ERK is related to cellular survival, proliferation, angiogenesis and autophagy.
  JNK and p38 pathways are activated by MAPKKK (ASK) modulating tumorigenesis, cell
  motility, osmoregulation, inflammation and apoptosis. ERK 5 is a MAPK, which induces
  proliferation, cell survival, motility and angiogenesis. Finally, PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  axis is a serine-threonine protein kinases pathway induced by the GTPase Ras that
  plays an important role in cellular quiescence, proliferation and longevity and
  is an important regulator of oncogenesis and apoptosis in various types of cancers.
