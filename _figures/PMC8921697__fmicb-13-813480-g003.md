caption: Metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. The different compounds that
  are generated in each metabolic pathway are showed and those harboring important
  organoleptic properties for cheese are colored in orange. The different metabolic
  pathways can be followed according to the corresponding arrows. Between every pair
  of compounds, the genes involved in such reactions are shown with their KEGG orthologue
  (KO) name. TPM values of each gene are shown as colored diamonds next to their corresponding
  KO name, which is colored in blue or green if significant transcription was identified
  for such KO day 30 or 90, respectively (p < 0.05). Next to the KO names, the horizontal
  bar-plots represent the percentage of transcripts for that KO and ripening time
  that was associated with the different taxa.
