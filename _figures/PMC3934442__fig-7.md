caption: Role of Rho/ROCK in adipocyte dysfunction and development. (Left) In the
  setting of obesity and metabolic syndrome, Rho/ROCK pathway is activated in adipose
  tissues, which promotes adipocyte hypertrophy, insulin resistance, upregulation
  of TNF-α and downregulation of adiponectin. (Right) In development and tissue regeneration,
  activated Rho/ROCK pathway positively regulates myogenesis, while it suppresses
  adipogenic differentiation. TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor.
