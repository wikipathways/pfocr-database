caption: Cellular apoptosis pathways and intervention by both cellular anti-apoptotic
  proteins and viral proteins encoded by oncolytic Ad, HSV and VV. A simplified description
  of intrinsic, extrinsic apoptosis pathways as well as key players (e.g. interferon
  pathway and p53) and their interactions are included. Also illustrated are mechanisms
  that viruses employed to block apoptosis, and some cellular anti-apoptotic proteins
  which are often over-expressed in cancer cells. Two recent dissected anti-apoptotic
  proteins encoded by VV, F1L [] and N1L [], are illustrated. This figure is modified
  from a figure by Liu and Kirn, 2005 [].
