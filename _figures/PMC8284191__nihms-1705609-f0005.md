caption: a | Glucose metabolism may proceed through different pathways in male and
  female cancers. Glucose metabolism may differ in cancer cells in males and females.
  In male cancer cells, energy (ATP) is frequently generated from the breakdown of
  glucose through the glycolysis pathway (Warburg effect), feeding pyruvate into the
  TCA cycle and then oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells tend to divert pyruvate
  to lactate that can circulate in the bloodstream and enter other cancer cells. These
  processes are more prevalent in male cancers than female (for example, in non-small
  cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) due to higher expression levels of glucose transporter
  1 (GLUT1 (REF.)), the lactate–pyruvate converting enzyme (lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH), for which the LDHB subunit is higher in male gliomas) and the lactate transporter
  (monocarboxylic acid transporter 4 (MCT4), which is higher in male melanoma). By
  contrast, in females, intermediates of glucose metabolism may preferentially be
  diverted to the less energy-efficient pentose phosphate pathway (PPP; as in right-sided
  colon cancer (RCC)) that produces antioxidant NADPH and metabolic building blocks.
  b | Immunity differs between the sexes. Females have greater adaptive and innate
  immune responses than males. These confer greater antiviral T cell immunity and
  anticancer response. A more efficient resolution of inflammation in females protects
  them from chronic inflammation-associated cancers–. Additionally, female microbiota
  improve responses to anticancer immune therapies. On the other hand, males have
  higher risk of infection from pathogenic agents and, consequently, are at greater
  risk of infection-associated cancers.
