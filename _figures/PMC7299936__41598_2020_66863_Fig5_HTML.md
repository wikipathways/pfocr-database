caption: Differential Expression of Metabolites in the Pyrimidine Biosynthesis Pathway
  in NAT1 Knockout Cell Lines (Compared to Scrambled). Metabolite fold-changes in
  the two NAT1 KO cell lines compared to the Scrambled cell line were plotted on the
  KEGG pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway–. Each rectangle represents a single gene and
  each circle represents a single metabolite; the CRISPR 2-19 cell line fold-change
  appears on the left half of the circle while the CRISPR 5-50 cell line fold-change
  appears on the right half of the circle, Circles not filled represent metabolites
  for which abundance was not measured.
