caption: Activation of the Smad1 pathway requires cooperation between two ligands,
  transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and CCN2, signaling through their cognate receptors.
  Elevated levels of endoglin [] promote TGF-β signaling through a receptor complex
  also consisting of ALK5, ALK1, and TGF-β RII, which leads to induced phosphorylation
  of Smad1 [,]. Concurrent activation of ERK1/2 is required for Smad1 phosphorylation,
  although the specific role of ERK1/2 in this process has not yet been elucidated
  []. Binding of CCN2 to the αvβ3 integrin receptor activates ERK1/2 in a Src-dependent
  manner. As CCN2 has been shown to bind TGF-β and enhance TGF-β receptor binding
  and signaling [], activation of Smad1/Erk1/2 signaling can occur in a spatially
  and temporally coordinated manner. Smad1 and Erk1/2 activate CCN2 gene expression
  leading to elevated CCN2 production, which then contributes to sustained activation
  of this pathway. Several components of this signaling pathway are expressed at elevated
  levels in scleroderma (SSc) fibroblasts, including ALK5, endoglin, αvβ3 integrin,
  Erk1/2, Smad1, and CCN2.
