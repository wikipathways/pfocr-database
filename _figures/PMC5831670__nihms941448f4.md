caption: 'a). Scheme 1- Similarities between type 2 diabetes and type 3 diabetes (e.g.,
  Alzheimer’s disease (AD)) reflecting a vital role for butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)
  in regulating acetylcholine (ACh) levels (a key neurotransmitter that modulates
  the immune system via the “cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway”). Hence, selective
  BuChE inhibition by a well tolerated anti-AD agent may provide a potentially valuable
  indirect action for mitigating type 2 diabetes by elevatimng ACh levels and consequently
  reducing proinflammatory cytokine levels which are known to drive the progression
  of both AD and type 2 diabetes. Abbreviations: eNO, endothelial-nitric oxide; LP,
  lipid peroxides; MD, membrane damage; VC, Vaso-constriction; IS, Immune-system;
  HLB, high level of BuChE; LGSI, Low-Grade Systemic-Inflammation; NS, Nervous System.
  b). Scheme 2 - Understanding of interaction of enzyme (BuChE), substrate (BuSCh)
  and the inhibitor (FBC) in current finding of a partial mixed type of inhibition
  system.'
