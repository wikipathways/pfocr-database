caption: Flavonoids monitor autophagy affecting metastasis and multidrug resistance
  (MDR). (A) Flavonoid-induced autophagy mediates metastasis of tumor cells by the
  inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signal pathway and upregulation of the
  metastasis-related protein expression, and inhibits neovascularization via promotion
  of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. (B) In PaCa44 cells, mutant p53 stabilizes through
  its interaction with HSP90, which can be upregulated by promoting mTOR activation,
  activating the positive feedback loop between Nrf2 and p62, and thereby inducing
  chemotherapy resistance to apigenin. In tumor cells, when autophagy is compromised,
  the competition between p62 accumulation and nuclear factor erythroid 2 (Nrf2) combination
  with keap-1 leads to the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 dissociation, promoting continuous
  activation of the Nrf2 signal pathway and p62 accumulation, while the p62/ kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1) complex is isolated in autophagosomes and degraded
  by autophagy. Some effective chemotherapeutic drugs have been found to produce drug
  resistance by inducing the autophagy of tumor cells, yet flavonoids combined with
  these chemotherapeutic drugs can block this pathway through the inhibition of autophagy.
