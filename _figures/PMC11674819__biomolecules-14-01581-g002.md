caption: PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway. (a) PD-1 and PD-L1 structures consist of an
  extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracytoplasmic region (signal
  motifs). (b) Antigens presented by Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) are recognized
  by the T-cell receptor (TCR; first signal). The second signal is delivered when
  CD80 and CD86 on the APCs engage CD28 on the T cells (red arrows indicate the activation
  signals, black and dotted arrows represent the suppression of the activation process).
  (c) The first signal for T-cell activation is provided by the binding of the T-cell
  receptor (TCR) with the antigen (Ag) presented by the APC in the context of the
  Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). A cascade of events follows, triggering
  the proliferation of effector T cells. Upon antigen-mediated activation (red arrows),
  the PD-1 receptor is transiently expressed on T cells and interacts with Programmed
  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) overexpressed on the surface of APCs or cancer cells, suppressing
  the immune response (black arrows). Following antigen clearance, the PD-1 levels
  on responding T cells decrease. Persistent antigen exposure and/or inflammation,
  such as in chronic infections and cancer, elicits a constitutive high and sustained
  PD-1 expression, which can progressively lead to “exhausted” T lymphocytes with
  impaired effector functions. Figure created with BioRender.com
