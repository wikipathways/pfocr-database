caption: Illustrating signaling components of the CLAVATA pathway. (A) CLV3 signaling
  in the shoot apical meristem. The CLV3 prepropeptide is processed by hydroxyproline
  (Hyp) O-arabinosyltransferases (HPATs), and presumably by a signal peptide peptidase
  (SPP), prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) and subtilases (SBTs) in ER-Golgi, and then
  mature CLV3 peptide is secreted to the apoplast. The CLV3 peptide is recognized
  by plasma membrane-associated receptor complexes, which in turn, WUSCHEL (WUS) is
  repressed through heterotrimeric G proteins, receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs)
  PBS1-LIKEs (PBLs), phosphatases POLTERGEIST (POL) and POL-LIE 1 (PLL1), and MAPKs.
  Dashed lines indicate putative or indirect pathways. (B) A model of the CLV3 prepropeptide
  and CLV3 peptide. The CLV3 prepropeptide consists of the N-terminal signal peptide
  (SP), the C-terminal CLE domain, and the variable domain (VD) between SP and CLE.
  (C) Representative structures of CLE prepropeptides produced by plants and microbes.
