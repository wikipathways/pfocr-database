caption: Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. Two states are depicted. Under normal conditions,
  PTCH1 inhibits the activity of SMO protein, thereby inhibiting the downstream pathway.
  COS2/Kif7 and PKA play a negative regulatory role. When PTCH1 binds with SHH, the
  inhibition of SMO is released and the GLI protein and microtubule complex enters
  the nucleus to activate downstream target gene transcription.
