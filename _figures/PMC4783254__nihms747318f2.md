caption: 'Ferroptosis appears to occur as a consequence of two cellular events: disruption
  of the cellular antioxidant pool and an increase of intracellular iron, leading
  to a buildup of toxic lipid peroxides. Chemical compounds such as erastin and sorafenib
  as well as p53 signaling disrupt cysteine transport, leading to depletion of cellular
  antioxidant glutathione (GSH). GSH depletion also occurs during ischemia/reperfusion
  (I/R) injury, wherein oxidative stress overwhelms the cellular antioxidant capacity.
  Loss of GSH inhibits glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key lipid reduction enzyme.
  Increase in intracellular iron by erastin treatment, iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2)
  activity, and iron-loaded transferrin after I/R injury also contribute to the accumulation
  of lipid peroxides and death by ferroptosis. Inhibitors of ferroptosis function
  by detoxifying lipid peroxides (ferrostatin 1) or decreasing intracellular iron
  [iron chelators, heat shock protein B1 (HSBP1)]. The pathway from lipid peroxides
  to ferroptotic cell death is still not determined; future studies should show if
  lipid peroxides are the terminal effectors of ferroptosis or if additional ferroptosis
  mediator/effector molecules are downstream.'
