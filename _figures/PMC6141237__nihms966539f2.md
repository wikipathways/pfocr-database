caption: Feedback mechanisms regulating adult midgut homeostasis and regeneration
  in Drosophila. Mature midgut cell loss (such as EC losses caused by pathogenic infection)
  trigger the activation of the JNK pathway and inactivation of the Hpo pathway in
  the ECs, both of which are able to induce the expression of mitogenic cytokines
  (Upds) and growth factors (fly EGFs) in the damaged midgut. Upd cytokines and fly
  EGFs (spi, krn, vn) activate the Jak/Stat and EGFR/Ras/MapK pathways respectively
  in the progenitor cells, where these stimuli function synergistically to promote
  ISC division. In addition, the Jak/Stat signaling also promotes EB differentiation.
  Thus, in response to damage, the ISCs rapidly generate new midgut cells to maintain
  epithelial homeostasis.
