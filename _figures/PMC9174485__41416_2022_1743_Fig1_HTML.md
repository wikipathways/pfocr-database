caption: a Most T cells are unable to recognise self-antigens, which may be present
  on the surface of self-cells or APCs. As a result, there is no autoimmunity. b Autoreactive
  T cells can recognise self-antigens and become activated, leading to destruction
  of the self-cell. c PD-L1 expression on self-cells and APCs prevents T cell activation,
  despite TCR ligation. APC antigen-presenting cell, TCR T cell receptor, MHC major
  histocompatibility complex.
