caption: 'Maize 3-Deoxyflavonoid and Flavone Biosynthetic Pathways.The condensation
  reaction between p-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, the first committed step in flavonoid
  formation, is catalyzed by chalcone synthase (CHS), resulting in naringenin chalcone
  (chalcone). This chalcone is converted to the flavanone naringenin by chalcone isomerase.
  Naringenin, the branching point of the pathway, is converted to apiforol (flavan-4-ol)
  by a dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) to apigenin (flavone) by action of a  followed
  by a dehydration step (see Supplemental Figure 7C online). An  could also catalyze
  this step. Naringenin can also be converted to eriodictyol by a flavanone-3′-hydroxylase
  (F3′H) and serves as substrate for /dehydration or , forming the flavone luteolin.
  Dihydroflavonol reductase can also act on eriodictyol to generate the flavan-4-ol
  luteoforol. Apiforol and luteoforol polymerize to form the red phlobaphene pigments.
  The proposed steps for conversion of apigenin and luteolin into the C-glycosyl flavones
  apimaysin and maysin, respectively, involves at least three steps: glycosylation
  at C-6 by a CGT, followed by a rhamnosylation at C-1 of the Glc moiety possibly
  mediated by SM2, and finally a dehydration step mediated by SM1 ().[See online article
