caption: This sub-network focuses on the module characterized by a series Serine/Threonine
  kinases involved in the MAPK-JNK signaling pathway. Among them, MAPK8 is the one
  having the highest outgoing connectivity of the entire network, and the most perturber
  incoming interaction carried by PRKACG, another FTD-network hub. Other deeply perturbed
  interactions include MAPK8-TNF, MAPK8-CRK. JUN is a large sink within this module
  and the non-canonical WNT pathway (ncWNT) one. Nodes and edges are labelled according
  to the conventions followed in .
