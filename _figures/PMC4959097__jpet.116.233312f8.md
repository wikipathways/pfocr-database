caption: Proposed pathway of FPP metabolism after squalene synthase inhibition. Enzymes
  involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway are localized to different subcellular
  compartments, with the production of FPP from mevalonate occurring in peroxisomes
  (). FPP is used either for the production of squalene by squalene synthase (SQS)
  or for the synthesis of nonsterol isoprenoids. In the presence of squalene synthase
  inhibitors (SSI), FPP accumulates and is thought to be metabolized primarily through
  the farnesol–farnesoic acid–dicarboxylic acid (DCA) pathway (). Farnesol-derived
  DCAs are then partially oxidized from the ω-carbon, producing chain-shortened (C12,
  C10) DCAs that are detectable in urine (; ). The enzymes involved in FPP catabolism
  have not been fully elucidated; however, based on mRNA gene expression changes observed
  after SQ1 treatment in the current study, they probably involve components of microsomal,
  peroxisomal, and mitochondrial oxidation. Shown is a proposed model of FPP catabolism
  in the presence of squalene synthase inhibitors, which extends on findings from
  others (; ; ; ). FPP can be dephosphorylated by phosphatidic acid phosphatase domain
  containing 2 (PPAPDC2) to produce farnesol, which is then sequentially oxidized
  to farnesal and then farnesoic acid. ADH1 and ADH7 were recently identified to catalyze
  the first oxidation step whereas ALDH3A2 was proposed to catalyze the second (),
  although ALDH1A1 is another possible candidate based on the expression changes observed
  in this study. Farnesoic acid is then oxidized from the ω-carbon to produce a C15
  dicarboxylic acid. We identified several CYP4A orthologs induced by SQ1, which we

  at the ω-carbon, possibly by the same enzymes involved in farnesol oxidation. The
  C15-DCA could then be activated by ACSL1 to its CoA derivative for transport into
  the peroxisome via the dicarboxylic acid transporter ABCD3 (), and then undergo

  description: Proposed pathway of FPP metabolism after squalene synthase inhibition.
    Enzymes involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway are localized to different
