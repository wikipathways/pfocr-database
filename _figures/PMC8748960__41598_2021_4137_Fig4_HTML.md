caption: Ingenuity®Pathway Analysis predicted signs of activation of IFN signalling
  pathway. Ingenuity®Pathway Analysis (IPA) predicted signs of activation of IFN signalling
  pathway in relation to intense training (z-score = 1.897 and p value = 7.28E−05).
  A canonical pathway network was derived using IPA by screening 2138 differentially
  expressed genes in tracheal wash (TW) samples derived from Thoroughbred racehorses
  before and during training for their impact on IFN signalling. Green shades indicate
  relative downregulation of genes during training, while red shades indicate relative
  upregulation. More intense (darker) colours indicate greater increases or decreases.
