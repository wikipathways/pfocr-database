caption: TGFβ and Wnt signaling are both critical for tumor initiation and progression.
  Generally, SIX/EYA activates these two signaling pathways, whereas DACH1 negatively
  regulates them. The function of SIX could be blocked by the silencing of SIX expression
  with shRNA, or by the disruption of the SIX/EYA complex with small molecules. EYA
  phosphatase activity could be blocked by biochemical inhibitors. On the other hand,
  DACH1 expression could be reactivated with demethylating agents or miRNA. Thus,
  targeting RDGN members is a promising therapeutic strategy that could restrain malignant
  behavior in tumors.
