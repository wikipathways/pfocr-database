caption: Working hypothesis of susceptibility of NHERF1 KO kidneys to cisplatin nephrotoxicity.
  NHERF1 KO mouse kidneys have increased levels of GSSG [], a known pro-oxidant. To
  help alleviate the oxidative stress NHERF1 KO kidneys have increased enzymes from
  the pentose phosphate pathway (G6PDH & ME) [] to produce more NADPH, needed for
  the conversion of GSSG to GSH []. Additional stress from cisplatin results in increases
  in gene expression of Slc7a11 and Gclc which are increased to regulate cellular
  levels of Cys and increase GSH production []. GGT, an enzyme important for the recycling
  of cysteine and GSH, is unable to respond to the increased demand for more GSH in
  response to the oxidizing conditions []. The introduction of cisplatin decreases
  G6PDH and ME activity resulting in a decrease in NADPH, reducing its ability to
  convert GSSG to GSH and alleviate this excess oxidative stress. Lastly, an increased
  activity of CCBL [] would also increase the amount of the cisplatin-thiol resulting
  in more toxicity.
