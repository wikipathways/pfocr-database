caption: Proposed scheme for how macrophage-based nanoparticle drug delivery could
  affect disease outcomes in neurodegenerative disorders. BMM would enter the brain
  in significant numbers carried to sites of neuroinflammation through the establishment
  of a chemokine gradient. Once across the BBB macrophages would release drug to neighboring
  cells including other macrophages, microglia, astrocytes or neurons. The nanoparticles
  would dissolve and release drug that would subsequently affect neuronal viability
  and function, deactivation of neurotoxic inflammatory microglia, anti-retroviral
  responses and astrocyte neurotrophic activities. (Transport of cells across BBB
  (“diapedesis”) involving opening of endothelial tight junctions shown in the figure
  may be an oversimplification. There is evidence that mononuclear cells can traverse
  cerebral microvessels by a transcellular pathway, leaving the endothelial tight
  junctions intact []).
