caption: HER2 family pathways, targeted therapies, and treatment resistance. (A) HER
  signaling pathway as dominant driver of tumor cell growth and survival. Ligand-bound
  HER homo- and heterodimers, and HER2 homodimers in HER2+ tumors, activate downstream
  pathways (e.g. p42/44 MAPK and Akt), which in turn modulate the levels or activities
  of various transcription factors (TF) and their coregulators (such as coactivators,
  CoA). Activation of this core signaling process leads to changes in gene expression
  that ultimately mediate proliferation and survival stimuli. (B) ER signaling as
  mechanism of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. Potent inhibition of the HER receptor
  layer by trastuzumab (T), lapatinib (L), pertuzumab (P), and trastuzumab-emtansine
  (T-DM1), as single agents or in combination, leads to effective blockade of downstream
  signaling, resulting in arrest of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. However,
  effective HER inhibition can lead to restoration/reactivation of ER signaling, which
  in turn provides alternative survival and proliferation stimuli leading to anti-HER2
  resistance.

  description: HER2 family pathways, targeted therapies, and treatment resistance.
    (A) HER signaling pathway as dominant driver of tumor cell growth and survival.
    Ligand-bound HER homo- and heterodimers, and HER2 homodimers in HER2+ tumors,
    activate downstream pathways (e.g. p42/44 MAPK and Akt), which in turn modulate
    the levels or activities of various transcription factors (TF) and their coregulators
    (such as coactivators, CoA). Activation of this core signaling process leads to
    changes in gene expression that ultimately mediate proliferation and survival
    stimuli. (B) ER signaling as mechanism of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. Potent
    inhibition of the HER receptor layer by trastuzumab (T), lapatinib (L), pertuzumab
    (P), and trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1), as single agents or in combination, leads
    to effective blockade of downstream signaling, resulting in arrest of proliferation
    and induction of apoptosis. However, effective HER inhibition can lead to restoration/reactivation
    of ER signaling, which in turn provides alternative survival and proliferation
    stimuli leading to anti-HER2 resistance.
