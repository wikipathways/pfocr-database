caption: Overview of the WNK pathway and its connection to major cancer-associated
  signaling pathways discussed in the review. Activated WNK kinases phosphorylate
  and activate downstream substrate kinases OSR1 and SPAK, forming the core module
  of the WNK pathway (indicated by black dashed-line box). WNK signaling regulates
  several ion channels and cation-chloride-cotransporters via OSR1/SPAK-dependent
  and independent interactions. WNKs act both upstream and downstream of the PI3K-AKT
  pathway, which may affect AKT-mediated regulation of angiogenesis. WNKs exert direct
  inhibitory effects on the TGF-β signaling pathway, but OSR1 and SPAK can activate
  TGF-β signaling through Smad2/3. These opposing effects are likely at the root of
  context-dependent signaling between WNKS and TGF-β. SPAK is a known regulator of
  the NF-κB pathway, which may in turn be subject to upstream WNK signaling
