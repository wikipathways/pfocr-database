caption: Role of endogenous ROS. Endogenous ROS are second messengers that are utilized
  by cytokine receptors, as for example tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α receptor 1 (TNFR1)
  (see text for explanation). The alternate ROS pathway, involving FAN and other signaling
  activities of TNFR1 are not shown in this illustration. TRADD, TNFR1-associated
  death domain protein; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1.
