caption: Effect of resveratrol on the proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis
  of tumor cells. Resveratrol can restrain the proliferation of multiple cancer cells
  through modulation of cell-cycle regulatory gene products and induce the cancer
  cells apoptosis by inhibition of antiapoptotic gene products. Resveratrol can inhibit
  EMT associated cancer cell invasion and migration through the inhibition of the
  PI-3K/Akt/NF-ҡB, TGF-β1, and hedgehog signaling pathway. Resveratrol displayed a
  dose-dependent and time-dependent cytotoxicity on lung cancer cells A549 through
  inhibiting the mRNA and protein expression of STAT-3. Resveratrol can enhance the
  anti-invasion and antimetastasis effect of FAK-I and CYTD when they were used in
  combination.
