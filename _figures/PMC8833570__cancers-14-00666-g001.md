caption: BCR signaling, RAS-MAPK pathway and RAS-MAPK inhibitors. Upon B cell receptor
  (BCR) antigen binding, LYN (or other SRC kinases) phosphorylates the ITAM domain
  in the signal transduction subunits CD79A/B. This event promotes the recruitment
  and activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), phosphorylation of BLNK and formation
  of the signalosome. SYK activation of proteins in the signalosome, namely Bruton’s
  tyrosine kinase (BTK), phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), VAV and the growth factor receptor
  bound protein 2 (GRB2), eventually results in the activation of the nuclear factor
  of activated T cells (NFAT), the nuclear factor κ B (NFκB) and the RAS-MAPK signaling
  pathways. LYN phosphorylation of the co-receptor CD19 activates phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase (PI3K) and its downstream targets including AKT, FOXO and BTK. RAS activation
  downstream both PLCγ2/PKCβ/RASGRP and GRB2/SOS, promotes the recruitment, dimerization
  and phosphorylation of RAF, which phosphorylates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates
  ERK. Activated ERK phosphorylates hundreds of targets in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
  Active RAS further promotes PI3K signaling through binding to the p110 catalytic
  subunit and enhancing of its catalytic activity. The main RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK small-molecules
  inhibitors used to counteract RAS-MAPK signaling in B cell lymphoproliferative disorders
  are listed next to their main targets. ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motif; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate;
  IP3, inositol-1, 4,5-triposphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; CBM, CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1;
  GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate.
