caption: Activation of NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)
  inflammasome mediated by redox-signalling, mitochondria and ER-stress during acute
  kidney injury (AKI). The binding of angiotensin II (Ang II) to its receptor, the
  angiotensin receptor 1 (ATR1), triggers ROS overproduction by stimulating NADPH
  oxidases (NOXs) in the plasmatic membrane. The ROS produced by NOXs induces the
  activation of the redox-sensitive pathway, including extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38, proteins able to activate
  to nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). The latter
  promotes the transcription of target genes such as NLRP3, pro-interleukin 1 β (IL-1β)
  and pro-interleukin 18 (IL-18). Under mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS are also generated,
  named mitochondrial ROS (mtROS), which activates the priming steps of inflammasome
  mediated by the redox-sensitive proteins. Further, excessive mtROS leads to the
  translocation of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) from the cytosol to the
  mitochondria. In mitochondria, TXNIP interacts with thioredoxin 2 (TRX2), inhibiting
  its activity, promoting the interaction with NLRP3 protein. Moreover, mitochondrial
  antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), an adaptor protein, is involved in NLRP3 localization
  in the mitochondria and participates in the inflammasome formation by promoting
  this interaction with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD
  (ASC). High levels of mtROS activate mitophagy, a negative regulator of inflammasome;
  however, in the case of AKI, mitophagy is dysfunctional, contributing to NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. Another protein that activates inflammasome is death-associated protein
  kinase (DAPK), which activates caspase-1. On the other hand, the endoplasmic stress
  reticulum produces ROS and triggers unfolded protein response (UPR), recognized
  as an inductor of the inflammasome. Figure created using BioRender (Toronto, ON,
