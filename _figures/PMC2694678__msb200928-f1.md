caption: Comparison of HK signal transduction systems from plants and bacteria. Ligands
  bind to the extracellular domain of transmembrane HKs and activate a cytoplasmic
  kinase domain. A phospho-relay (His → Asp in bacteria or His → Asp → His → Asp in
  plants) transmits the signal to DNA. Both systems can be defined as perceiving an
  input stimulus (input layer), transmitting the signal (transmission layer), and
  bringing about a response (response layer), but use different numbers of components.
  In simple bacterial systems (right panel), two proteins (HK and RRs) function in
  three layers. In plants (left panel), cytokinin responses involve multiple components
  that are each encoded by multigene families in these three layers. AHK, arabidopsis
  histidine kinase; AHP, arabidopsis histidine phosphotransfer protein; CK, cytokinin;
  HK, histidine kinase; H, histidine residue; D, aspartate residue; P, phosphate group;
  CRF, cytokinin response factor; ARR, Arabidopsis response regulator; A, bacterial
  HK ligand.
