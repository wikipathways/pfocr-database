caption: 'Schematic representation of chemically induced reprogramming of fibroblasts
  into neural stem cells and into neurons in the brain and retina [12,36,37,39,41,42,43,85,86].
  This approach utilized small molecules that acted on the cellular epigenome (Epi)
  and on various signaling pathways that control cellular identity (TGFβ, GSK3β, PKC,
  BMP, SHH, JNR, ROCK, and others). FG—growth factor; m—mouse; h—human; CiNs—chemically
  induced neurons; CiNSCs—chemically induced neural stem cells; CiPCs—chemically induced
  photoreceptor-like cells; m rd1—mouse model of retinal degeneration; m NaIO3—mouse
  model of sodium iodate (NaIO3)-induced retinal degeneration; SRT—subretinal transplantation,
  LVT—lateral ventricle transplantation. Pathway activators: green color; pathway
  inhibitors: red color'
