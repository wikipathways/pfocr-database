caption: Membrane perception of BL by BRI1 and a coreceptor, BAK1, triggers auto-
  and transphosphorylation of the receptor kinases (). When the signal reaches the
  nucleus, the activity of BIN2 is depressed, thus allowing PPKL phosphatases to dephosphorylate
  BES1, which accumulates and regulates the expression of target genes. The subcellular
  localizations of BIN2 and the proteasome involved in the degradation of phosphorylated
  BES1 remain undefined, but they are tentatively placed inside the nucleus as are
  several steps along the pathway.
