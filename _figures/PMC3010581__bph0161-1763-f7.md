caption: A summary of the proposed molecular mechanism through which 6-shogaol inhibits
  PMA-induced breast cancer cell invasion. PMA induces MMP-9 expression and subsequent
  cancer cell invasion through NF-κB transcriptional activation and ERK-dependent
  AP-1 transcriptional activation. 6-Shogaol targets the upstream signal IKK by suppressing
  IKK-dependent IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, leading to a retardation of
  p65 nuclear translocation and subsequent inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activation.
  Although 6-shogaol has an inhibitory effect on the JNK signalling pathway, this
  effect is unlikely to contribute to its inhibition of MMP-9 activation.
