caption: Working hypothesis regarding the mechanism by which SDF‐1α (stromal cell‐derived
  factor 1α) stimulates cell proliferation. Schematic also shows site of action of
  inhibitors used to disrupt the pathway. Not shown is the role of RACK1 to scaffold
  βγ, PLC, PKC, Src, and ERK1/2, as well as βγ, PI3K and AKT, into signaling complexes.
  DPP4 indicates dipeptidyl peptidase 4; ERK1/2, extracellular signal regulated kinases
  1 and 2; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate 3‐kinase; PKC, protein kinase
  C; PLC, phospholipase C; p‐RB, phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein; PT, pertussis
  toxin; RACK1, receptor for activated C kinase 1. Inhibitors are indicated in red,
  and signal transduction components probed by western blotting are shown in purple.
