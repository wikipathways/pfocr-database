caption: Schematic representation of proposed intracellular effects of S100A1, S100A4,
  and S100A8/S100A9. (A) S100A1 expression is negatively controlled by transcription
  factors downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors and PKC. S100A1 regulates energy
  metabolism and Ca2+ efflux from Ca2+ stores, stimulates striated muscle contraction,
  and activates a membrane-bound form of guanylate cyclase (GC) in photoreceptors
  in relation to dark adaptation. (B) S100A4 is induced by a Wnt/APC/GSK3/β-catenin/TCF
  pathway and targets several intracellular factors including NMMHC IIA, tropomyosin
  and actin with ensuing stimulation of cell migration and metastasis. Phenothiazines
  blocks intracellular S100A4 interactions. (C) S100A8 reduces telomerase activity
  and ROS production under the negative control of S100A9. S100A9 promotes ROS production,
  reduces breast cancer cell growth and negatively regulates S100A8/S100A9 heterotetramer
  complex activities as shown.
