caption: cGAS recognizes both endogenous and exogenous dsDNA in a length-dependent
  manner. Activated cGAS employs ATP and GTP as substrates to catalyze the synthesis
  of the secondary messenger cGAMP. Upon binding to cGAMP, STING undergoes oligomerization
  to form a tetramer, subsequently trafficking to the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi
  apparatus, STING undergoes palmitoylation. Then, STING recruits and activates TBK1,
  which catalyzes a serine residue within the pLxIS motif in STING, phosphorylates
  adjacent STING dimers, and activates IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes and transfers
  to the nucleus to transcriptionally express immunostimulatory genes and IFN. Activated
  STING also recruits and activates inhibitor of κB kinase （IKK）. Phosphorylated IKK
  then phosphorylates IκB, marking it for proteasomal degradation. The degradation
  of IκB releases NF-κB subunits, allowing them to translocate to the nucleus, where
  they trigger classical NF-κB signaling and induce the production of cytokines. In
  conclusion, cGAS-STING activation can not only induce IFN production through IRF3/7
  but also produce inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 by activating
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, which further promote the production of IFN. Created
  with Figdraw. cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; cGAMP, cyclic GMP-AMP; dsDNA, double-stranded
  DNA; IFN, interferon; STING, stimulator of interferon genes
