caption: (A) Proposed model for the autophagy process during E. chaffeensis infection.
  E. chaffeensis initiates induction of autophagosome formation through Etf-1 effector-driven
  interaction with Beclin-1 and activation of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  complex. Fusion of the ehrlichial vacuole with an autophagosome leads to formation
  of amphisome. However, it inhibits autolysosome formation through reprogramming
  of host cell signaling pathways. (B) Proposed model for E. chaffeensis TRP-mediated
  activation of the canonical Wnt-PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway and inhibition of autolysosome
  formation and autophagic degradation. E. chaffeensis TRP effectors activate canonical
  and noncanonical Wnt and PI3K/Akt pathways, which results in phosphorylation and
  inactivation of GSK3 and in inhibition of the negative regulator TSC2. Thus, mTORC1
  is activated and then phosphorylates and inhibits nuclear translocation of TFEB.
  Exploitation of this signal cascade by E. chaffeensis plays a critical role in inhibition
  of autolysosome formation. The components which were not tested in this study are
  colored blue.
