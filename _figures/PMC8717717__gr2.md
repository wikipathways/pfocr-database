caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of hsa-miR-200c-3p in the circulation and ovarian
  cancer. Analysis of pathways associated with miR200c in the plasma and serum (A)
  and ovarian cancer (B). Six genes were found to be associated with miR-200c-3p (and
  other miRNAs w/seed AAUACUG) in plasma/serum pathway analysis (A). Focused ovarian
  cancer pathway analysis revealed miR-200c-3p was associated with the regulation
  of ten genes (predominantly growth factors) (B).
