caption: (A) Model of the Bacillus subtilis partner switching system that regulates
  the activity of σB in the general stress response pathway (see text for full description).
  Shown are the relevant domains for partner-switching regulation. (B) SypE contains
  a central RR REC domain flanked by an N-terminal RsbW-like serine kinase domain
  and a C-terminal PP2C-like serine phosphatase domain. SypA contains a single STAS-domain
  conserved in anti-sigma factor antagonists. Under conditions in which SypE is unphosphorylated,
  its N-terminal kinase domain is active, resulting in the phosphorylation of SypA
  (on conserved serine residue S56) and inhibition of biofilm formation. When phosphorylated
  (presumably on conserved residue D192), SypE functions as a phosphatase (). This
  results in the dephosphorylation of SypA, activating SypA to promote biofilm formation.
  A D192A mutation “locks” SypE into a constitutive kinase, resulting in SypA phosphorylation
  and the inhibition of biofilms and colonization. Protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) domain
  (black box); Serine/threonine kinase (RsbW) domain (white box); anti-sigma factor
  antagonist (STAS) domain (grey box); response regulator receiver (REC) domain (light
  grey box).
