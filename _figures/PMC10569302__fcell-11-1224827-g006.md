caption: CD44s drives lamellipodia formation through PI3K-Akt-tPA/LRP1-NFκB cascade.
  Scheme summarizing the proposed mechanism by which CD44s drives lamellipodia formation
  in luminal type BrCa. We propose that CD44s upregulates tPA through PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway, thus activating its membrane-receptor LRP1 and subsequently its drown-stream
  NFκB axis, ultimately leading to the outgrowth of lamellipodia.
