caption: Regulation of SphK1 signalling. SphK1 is located mainly in the cytoplasm.
  Various agonists (such as phorbol ester and TNF-α) induce activation of SphK1 phosphorylation,
  activation and translocation to plasma membrane. This relocation is mediated by
  interaction with CIB1. S1P is exported from the cells and binds to S1P receptors
  (S1P1–5) to activate classical GPCR signalling pathways, leading to control of cell
  survival, proliferation and migration. Alternatively, S1P binds to TRAF2 intracellularly
  and activates the NF-κB pathway and its downstream targets. SphK, sphingosine kinase;
  CIB1, calcium and integrin-binding protein 1; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate; GPCR,
  G protein-coupled receptor; TRAF2, TNF receptor-associated factor 2; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; PLC, phospholipase C; PP2A,
  protein phosphatase-2A.
