caption: PITX1 acts as a core gene that regulates the p53 signaling pathway. E2F1
  as upstream of PITX1 can upregulate PITX1 expression levels by directly binding
  to its proximal promoter region, thereby promoting the PITX1-p53-p21 signaling pathway
  to cause cell cycle arrest. The mutation/deletion of Rb determines the stimulation
  of proliferative gene E2F1, including the ability to activate p27kip1 and Pin1,
  which can directly inhibit the translation of cyclin E and CDK2, leading to cell
  cycle arrest. Pin1 can bind PITX1 to phosphorylated SF1, and SF-1 S203 site phosphorylation
  cooperates with Pin1 to increase SF-1-PITX1 interactions to promote downstream genes,
  but SF-1 S203 site phosphorylation is regulated by ERK1/2.
