caption: 'Graphical summary: the metabolic reprogramming during macrophage polarization
  induced by M-CSF (M2) and reinforced by IL-10 (M2c) leads to P2Y11 receptor upregulation.
  Metabolic reprogramming involves activation of a signaling axis comprising AMP-activated
  kinase (AMPK), nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), and NAD+. NAMPT is
  the rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD+ salvage pathway, which converts nicotinamide
  (NAM) into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NAD+ acts as macrophage metabolite
  that drives P2Y11 receptor expression, possibly via the NAD+-dependent deactylase
  SIRT1.'
