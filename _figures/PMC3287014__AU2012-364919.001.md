caption: Pathways leading to chemotherapy-induced cell death and resistance. The major
  steps are shown in the sequential order. DNA damage is the critical step in this
  response pathway. Cells with low chemotherapy-induced DNA damage will survive chemotherapy
  and are chemoresistant. We propose that chemoresistance can possibly be identified
  by measuring chemotherapy-induced DNA damage and that some of the underlying resistance
  mechanisms can potentially be elucidated by measuring the other major steps such
  as metabolism, cell uptake/efflux, and DNA repair. The underlined steps can be determined
  with AMS.

  description: Pathways leading to chemotherapy-induced cell death and resistance.
    The major steps are shown in the sequential order. DNA damage is the critical
    step in this response pathway. Cells with low chemotherapy-induced DNA damage
    will survive chemotherapy and are chemoresistant. We propose that chemoresistance
    can possibly be identified by measuring chemotherapy-induced DNA damage and that
    some of the underlying resistance mechanisms can potentially be elucidated by
    measuring the other major steps such as metabolism, cell uptake/efflux, and DNA
    repair. The underlined steps can be determined with AMS.
