caption: Cellular mechanisms of n-3 PUFA on skeletal muscles. n-3 PUFA displaces n-6
  PUFA on membranes, resulting in less inflammatory mediators production, and produces
  pro-resolution mediators. It also reduces cyclooxygenase production through the
  inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Decreased inflammation leads to decreased
  muscle protein breakdown. NF-κB inhibition also suppresses the ubiquitin-proteasome
  system through the downregulation of the muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF-1) gene. n-3
  PUFA activates the mTORC-1 signaling pathway, stimulating muscle protein synthesis
  by phosphorylation of involving protein kinases. n-3 PUFA increases amino acid transporter
  expressions, allowing more substrates for protein synthesis. n-3 PUFA improves mitochondrial
  function and reduces free radicle production, which leads to muscle breakdown. mTORC-1
  = Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; MuRF-1 = muscle ring finger-1; NF-κB
  = Nuclear factor kappa B; n-3 PUFA = omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid; PPAR-γ
  = peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.
