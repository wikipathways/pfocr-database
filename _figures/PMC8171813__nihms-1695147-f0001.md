caption: Numerous immune components are involved in the injured myocardium. The main
  components are represented here. Stressed cells initiate inflammatory secretory
  programs through the cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway. Dying cells release
  damage associated patterns (DAMPs) which act as potent signaling molecules. C-reactive
  protein (CRP), IgM, and other circulating factors permeate the injured heart. Tissue-resident
  macrophages proliferate and additional CCR2+ monocytes are recruited from circulation.
  Macrophages polarize between M1-like (inflammatory) and M2-like (reparative) phenotypes.
  Dendritic cells are potent activators of recruited T cells, which are major immune
  infiltrates. CD8+ cytotoxic and several effector T (Teff) cells signal with M1 macrophages
  and many other pro-inflammatory pathways. In contrast some Teff and regulatory T
  cells (Treg) infiltrate the heart and stimulate M2-like macrophages, ECM remodeling
  and overall heart repair. B cells produce many chemokines, cytokines, and autoantibodies.
  Natural killer (NK) cells are recruited and play a mainly reparative role. Many
  neutrophils are recruited where they stimulate M1-like macrophages and secrete pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Eosinophils also infiltrate the heart and help stimulate tissue recovery.
  One of the major downstream targets of this inflammatory milieu are cardiac fibroblasts.
  Tissue-resident fibroblasts proliferate and activate and produce detrimental fibrosis.
