caption: Overview of neuronal signaling events that influence miRNA biogenesis, activity,
  and degradation. Each step within the miRNA biogenesis pathway may be stimulated
  (green arrow) or inhibited (red bar) by intra- and extracellular signaling events.
  Pri-miRNA levels increase when BDNF or other signals activate transcription factors
  that stimulate the transcription of miRNA-encoding genes. Pri-miRNA cleavage by
  the Microprocessor is influenced by the activity of proteins, such as PP1 which
  inhibits Microprocessor activity. Pre-miRNA cleavage by Dicer is increased in response
  to glutamate, BDNF signaling, or NMDA receptor activation. BDNF can also inhibit
  Dicer’s ability to cleave some pre-miRNAs by inducing Lin28 binding to the pre-miRNA
  terminal loop or by promoting TRBP redistribution and dissociation from Dicer. Neuronal
  activity and NMDA receptor activation inhibit RISC activity by promoting the degradation
  of the RISC component Mov10. miRNA interactions with target mRNAs are also influenced
  by RNA binding proteins such as FMRP or HuD, which are regulated by gp1 mGluR and
  mTORC1 signaling, respectively. P38-induced phosphorylation of Ago2 stimulates mRNA
  translation by causing the RISC to release its bound miRNA. miRNAs may also be destabilized
  by increases in neuronal activity, by glutamatergic signaling, or by pilocarpine-induced
  inhibition of the miRNA stabilizing protein Gld2. Pilocarpine may also stimulate
  miRNA degradation by increasing expression of the exonuclease Xrn2.
