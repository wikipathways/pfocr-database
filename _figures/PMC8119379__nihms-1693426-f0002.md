caption: Coding gene variants converge on signaling and activation pathways to impact
  autoimmunity. (a) Disruption of FUT2 function and the resulting lack of ABO blood
  group antigen secretion in the intestinal mucosa can result in impaired barrier
  function and immunity by increasing susceptibility to some viral infections and
  altering microbiome composition as well as the microbial metabolites (such as short-chain
  fatty acids). IFIH1 variants may augment innate responses against enteroviruses.
  (b) Antiviral or other pro-inflammatory responses in the gut may result in trafficking
  of APCs to the pancreatic lymph node (pLN), where autoantigen-specific T cells are
  activated. (c) Activation and function of autoreactive T cells may be exacerbated
  by T1D-risk variants expressed either in the APC or in the T cell itself. The risk
  variant of PTPN22 (LYP) abolishes CSK binding, which could result in decreased phosphatase
  activity and increased TCR signaling. The CTLA4 risk variant results in reduced
  CTLA4 expression on the T-cell surface, reducing regulation of T-cell activation.
  Variants in co-stimulatory molecules CD226 and SIRPγ may contribute to pro-inflammatory
  T-cell skewing by promoting activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway and enhancing the
  production of inflammatory and cytotoxic molecules, respectively. Treg function
  may be negatively impacted by a UBASH3A variant, which inhibits NFκB activation
  and downstream IL-2 production. APCs may contribute to the generation of this pro-inflammatory
  milieu, as altered LNK function results in enhanced NOD2 signaling, activation of
  NFκB and production of IL-6 and IL-1β. APC peptide repertoire for presentation may
  be influenced by a CTSH variant. Variants in TYK2 and IFIH1 may also contribute
  to innate inflammation through increased induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs).
  (d) Genetic variants may impact β-cell susceptibility to death via sensing of viral
  or self dsRNA in the case of IFIH1, while a variant within CTSH seems to play a
  role in TLR3 activation, downstream IFN production and susceptibility to cytokine-induced
  damage. T1D-associated TYK2 variants may enhance β-cell expression of ISGs, including
  MHC I and CXCL10. Created with BioRender.
