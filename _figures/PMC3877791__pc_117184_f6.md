  dephosphorylated by a so far unknown phosphatase (PPase) to guanosine, which is
  either deaminated to xanthosine by  or salvaged into nucleotides and nucleic acids.
  The hydrolysis of xanthosine to xanthine and Rib is catalyzed by NSH1 possibly with
  the participation of NSH2. In general, xanthosine and xanthine cannot be salvaged
  and are destined for degradation via purine ring catabolism (gray shaded area).
  Neither  nor inosine gives rise to xanthosine in vivo.
