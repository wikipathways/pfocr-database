caption: FGL1-involved signaling pathways. A) FGL1 is normally released by the liver
  in low levels but by cancer in high levels. FGL1 is identified as a major ligand
  for the inhibitory receptor LAG-3, and its blockade can potentiate anti-tumor T
  cell responses. B) FGL1 inhibits liver cancer cell proliferation by suppressing
  Akt signaling. C) The expression of FGL1 is down-regulated through Oxysophocarpine,
  which suppresses IL-6-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signal activation and subsequently strengthen
  the effects of anti-LAG-3 immunotherapy. D) FGL1 promotes NSCLC by regulating the
  PARP1/ Caspase 3 pathway.
