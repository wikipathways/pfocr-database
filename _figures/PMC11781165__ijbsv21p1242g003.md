caption: 'Gut microbes and metabolites mediate various signaling pathways related
  to AP progression. TLRs identify signals from gut bacteria, activating the MyD88/NF-κB
  signaling pathway, promoting inflammation and autophagy in AP. Supplementing beneficial
  probiotics such as B. animalis, L. reuteri, or B. cereus can reduce inflammation-induced
  damage by inhibiting the MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. The NOD1 receptor inside
  cells connects to DAP from gram-negative bacteria, activating the NOD1/RIP2/NF-κB
  pathway to drive inflammation. NOD2, detects MDP generated by DL-endopeptidase,
  thereby activating the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and promoting the expression
  of inflammatory genes. Interestingly, NOD2 activation also counters inflammation
  by suppressing the TLR-mediated NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Probiotics generating MDP
  can reduce inflammation, and supplements like L. salivarius or mifamurtide can compensate
  for lacking DL-endopeptidase. The NLRP3 inflammasome, influenced by these pathways,
  promotes inflammatory cytokine release and cell death by activating caspase-1. The
  compound MCC950 and B. cereus can suppress NLRP3, inhibiting harmful cell death
  processes. (TLRs: toll like receptors 2; NOD1: nucleotide binding oligomerization
  domain containing 1; NOD2: nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing
  2; DAP: diaminopimelic acid; MDP: muramyl dipeptide)'
