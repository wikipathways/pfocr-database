caption: 'Simplified diagram of the main pathways involving the biosynthesis of glycerolipids
  in microalgae. The set of reactions occurring within the chloroplast are termed
  the chloroplastic or ‘‘prokaryotic” pathway and those that involve glycerolipid
  synthesis in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and subsequent transfer to the chloroplast
  constitute the endoplasmic or “eukaryotic” pathway. Orange arrows refer to the biosynthetic
  pathway of transport of ER-derived glycerolipids to chloroplasts. Enzymes involved
  in the biosynthesis of glycolipids are shown. ACP, acyl carrier protein; PA, phosphatidic
  acid; DAG, diacylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; MGD, MGDG syntases; DGD, DGDG
  synthases; UDP, uridine diphosphate galactose intermediate in the production of
  polysaccharides (-Gal galactose, -Sq sulfoquinovose); GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphatase
  acyltransferase; LPAAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase; PA, phosphatidic
  acid; PP, phosphatidate phosphatase; DAG-CPT, diacylglycerol synthetase-choline:
  diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase; SLS, sulfolipid synthase; SQDG, sulfoquinovosyl
  diacylglycerol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; DGTS, diacylglyceryl trimethylhomo-serine;
  TAG, triacylglycerol; ∆, degree of unsaturation ranging from 1 to 4 double bonds.'
