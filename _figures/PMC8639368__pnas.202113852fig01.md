caption: 'Synthesis and release of 5-HT and melatonin in rat pinealocytes. The enzymatic
  pathway from L-tryptophan to 5-HT and melatonin uses four enzymes. AANAT is regulated
  by adrenergic signaling. Two possibilities are shown (red dotted arrows) for the
  mechanism of release of 5-HT from pinealocytes: through vesicular exocytosis or
  through monoamine transporters running in reverse (orange). Released serotonin activates
  serotonin receptors (blue) on the plasma membrane of pinealocytes. We are suggesting
  that the receptors up-regulate AANAT acting as an auto- or paracrine mechanism to
  promote melatonin synthesis. AADC, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase; HIOMT, hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase;
  TPH, tryptophan hydroxylase.'
