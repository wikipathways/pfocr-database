caption: The inhibitory effect of thymoquinone on the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
  TQ suppresses ERK activation, leading to decreased proliferation (represented in
  red) and increased apoptosis (represented in green). The downregulation of proliferation
  markers Ki-67 and Cyclin D1 (red) indicates reduced tumor cell growth, while the
  upregulation of apoptotic markers Caspase-3, Bax, and Cleaved Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
  (PARP) (green) promotes programmed cell death. This suggests that TQ exerts its
  anticancer effects by disrupting the MAPK signaling cascade, ultimately shifting
  the balance from cancer cell survival to apoptosis
