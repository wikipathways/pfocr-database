caption: Five isoforms of polo-like kinases (PLK) have been identified with PLK 1-4
  having been associated with a potential role in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis.
  PLK5 is an inactive kinase, almost exclusively expressed in the brain and no studies
  have associated it with leukemogenesis. PLK1 overexpression has been documented
  in AML specimens and it functions primarily in the regulation of cell cycle progression,
  centriole duplication, mitosis, cytokinesis, and DNA damage response. Less is known
  about its role in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. PLK1 can be inhibited specifically
  by onvansertib, while volasertib is a pan-PLK inhibitor. Similarly, PLK4 has been
  linked to mitotic processes and overexpression in solid malignancies has been documented.
  However, its role in AML is less clear. Conversely, PLK2 and PLK3 expression is
  increased in response to DNA damage and activation can lead to mitotic arrest and
  apoptosis. However, preclinical data showing increased methylation and thereby inactivation
  of PLK2 is associated with a favorable prognosis in AML suggesting a potential pathogenic
  role of PLK2 in AML.
