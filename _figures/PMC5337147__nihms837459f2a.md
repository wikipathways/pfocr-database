caption: AREs and GREs in growth factor signaling.A. Schematic representation of tumor
  growth factor receptors (TGFR), vascular endothelial, epidermal, platelet-derived,
  or insulin growth factor receptors (VEGFR, EGFR, IGFR, PTDGFR) signaling. Signals
  transmitted through the tyrosine kinase family (RTK) receptors are directed through
  several major kinase signaling cascades, such as RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3/Akt/mTOR/GSK3
  pro-survival pathways.B. Schematic representation of NOTCH and WNT/β-catenin signal-transduction
  components that differentially function in a growth factor- and hypoxia- dependent
  manner. Frizzle and NOTCH receptors transduce a range of intracellular signals that
  alter the rate of proliferation and production of growth factors and markers of
  EMT through the post-transcriptional mechanisms. GRE-containing transcripts (shown
  in grey) represent direct binding targets of CELF1 in normal cells, as determined
  by RNA-immunoprecipitation assays [, ]. These transcripts exhibit a switch in their
  binding preferences from CELF1 in normal cells [, ] to ELAVL1 in malignant cells
  []. Transcripts in yellow contain AREs. Nodes labeled as ZFP36, ELAVL1, CELF1, are
  experimentally validated functional mRNA targets of ZFP36, ELAVL1, or CELF1. Pentagon-shaped
  nodes represent transcripts encoding kinases. Arrows indicate direct interactions
  and/or activations. This network diagram was built using Ingenuity Pathway Assistant
  Software.
