caption: Model of NOD1 signaling cascade. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
  1 (NOD1) characterized by three motifs containing a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat
  (LRR) domain, a central nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), and a variable N-terminal
  caspase recruitment domains (CARD), which could be activated by γ-D-Glu-mDAP (IE-DAP).
  NOD1 recruits the adaptor RIP2 and facilitates recruitment of TAK1 and NEMO. Here
  the TAK1 recruits TAB1 and TAB2/3 inducing MAPK activation. In addition, NEMO instigates
  activation of NF-κB by reducing IκBα and phosphorylating P65, the subunit of NF-κB.
  Furthermore, activation of MAPK and NF-κB promotes the cell cycle and proliferation.
  In our study, Evodiamine could potentially suppress the NOD1 signal pathway to inhibit
  the cell cycle and proliferation. The arrows represents the activation and the T
  bar represents the suppression.
