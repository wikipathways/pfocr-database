caption: Beneficial effects of metformin on cardiovascular system. Metformin inhibits
  lipogenesis by downregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)
  expression and activity; it confers protection from lipoapoptosis by alleviating
  ER stress; it ameliorates cardiovascular system function by preventing abnormal
  vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMCs) proliferation and migration and by increasing
  AMPK signalling and nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelial vascular cells.
  Metformin ameliorates tissue insulin sensitivity, which leads to a decrease in glucose
  serum levels and inhibits NF-κB pathway signalling, thus diminishing inflammation;
  it prevents the conversion of monocytes into macrophages; it increases ATP cassette
  transporter type 1 (ABCA-1) activity, promoting the export of cholesterol from lipid-rich
  macrophages and ameliorating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) function,
  thus reducing leukocyte-endothelium interactions and atherosclerotic risk.
