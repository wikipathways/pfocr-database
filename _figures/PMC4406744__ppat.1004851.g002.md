caption: Nitrogen is assimilated and distributed via glutamine synthetase (Gln1 and
  Gln2) and glutamate synthase (Glt1) or anabolic NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase
  (Gdh1) and Gln1-2 [, ]. Glutaminolysis [] involves NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase
  (Mgd1). Enzymes are depicted as solid circles with the adjacent bar graphs showing
  the relative expression levels of the encoding genes in WT (black bar) and Δasd4
  mutant strains (red bar) following 3 h and 16 h growth in GMM with 10 mM NH4+ as
  the sole nitrogen source. Results were normalized against the expression of the
  β-tubulin gene TUB2. Values are the average of three results from at least two independent
  biological replicates. Error bars are standard deviation.
