caption: ① Zymosan activated NF-κB signaling in resident macrophages via toll-like
  receptor 2 (TLR2). ② Activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway increased the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines to initiate the cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  that was amplified by mesothelial cells and other cells of the peritoneum. ③ The
  pro-inflammatory cytokines also activated the hMSCs to secrete TSG-6. ④ TSG-6 decreased
  TLR2/NF-κB signaling in the resident macrophages through a direct interaction with
  CD44 or in a complex with hyaluronan. The amplification of the pro-inflammatory
  signals by mesothelial cells to recruit neutrophils was modulated by a negative
  feedback loop introduced by hMSCs and TSG-6.Reprinted with permission from the American
