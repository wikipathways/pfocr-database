caption: 'The biphasic role of wnt/β-catenin pathway in heart muscle development.
  (A) Wnt/β-catenin pathway promotes mesoderm specification in the early stages of
  hESC differentiation, while, its activation inhibits CM differentiation in the later
  stages. The cardiac differentiation inducer Mesp1 activates the inhibitor of canonical
  wnts, Dkk1, promoting CM differentiation. Moreover, the presence of wnt ligands
  inhibit GSK3β and lead to β-catenin stabilization in the cytoplasm and its traslocation
  into the nucleus promoting CM proliferation. (B) The overexpression of miR1-2 induces
  the expression of cardiac specific genes BM-MSCs and activates the wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway promoting their cardiac differentiation. (C) Wnt-3a, wnt-3a-conditioned
  medium and BIO stimulate CSC proliferation and clonogenicity, while, significantly
  inhibit CSC differentiation into myocyte-committed cells. In contrast, Dkk1 decreases
  CSC proliferation and clonogenicity and promotes myocyte specification, through
  the inhibition of the canonical wnt pathway. hESCs: human Embrionic Stem Cells;
  CMs: Cardiomyocytes; Dkk-1: Dickkopf-related protein 1; GSK3-β: Glycogen synthase
