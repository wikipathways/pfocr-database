caption: 'Regulation of redox metabolism by light during bud outgrowth process: a
  CK-dependent pathway. This synthetic scheme highlights the central role of redox
  metabolism in the bud outgrowth photocontrol process and its regulation by light
  and CK. In light (L:D 16:8), CK synthesis and transport in buds are promoted ().
  Moreover, after beheading in light, the H2O2 content in buds decreased, while GSH
  pool increased (). Furthermore, CK stimulates GSH synthesis and contributed to the
  decrease of H2O2 contents, notably through the AsA–GSH scavenging pathways. In contrast,
  darkness prevents the H2O2 decrease that normally occurs in light and drastically
  reduces the GSH pool. In summary, the light stimulation of CK synthesis and transport
  increases the GSH content and activates the AsA–GSH scavenging system to initiate
  the decrease in H2O2 in bud that will, in turn, restore the cell division and expansion
  that are required to initiate the outgrowing process (; ). Green lines indicate
  stimulation, red lines inhibitions, and gray lines nonactive pathways.'
