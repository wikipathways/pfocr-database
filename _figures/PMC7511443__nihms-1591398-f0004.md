caption: 'As a typical G-protein coupled receptor with the seven membrane-spanning
  domain structure, MC5R is activated after binding to synthetic peptidomimetic agonists
  or to naturally occurring ligands like ACTH and α,β,γ-MSH with the order of potency
  in activating MC5R being α-MSH>ACTH=β-MSH>>γ-MSH. Following activation, MC5R couples
  to diverse G proteins and thereby triggers a variety of signaling pathways, including
  JAK2/STAT1 pathway, cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway and PI3K/ERK1/2/MSK1/c-fos pathway, which
  are likely implicated in the immunoregulatory function of MC5R. The MC5R signaling
  may activate the ERK1/2 pathway via either the transient PI3K/c-Raf/MEK1/2 cascade
  or the sustained βarr1/2/c-Raf/MEK1/2 cascade, possibly resulting in cellular proliferation
  and differentiation. In addition, MC5R signaling may induce lipolysis via the cAMP/PKA/ACC-HSL-PLIN1-ATGL
  pathway and suppress fatty acid re-esterification by the ERK1/2/PEPCK pathway, leading
  to a possible beneficial effect on metabolic endocrinopathies. Furthermore, the
  MC5R activated PI3K may trigger the Akt/MLC2 signaling and promote actomyosin contractility,
  which is likely involved in erythroid enucleation or improvement of cytoskeletal
  integrity in glomerular podocytes. Alternatively, MC5R may reduce the GLUT1/GLUT4
  ratios via PI3K pathway and thereby attenuate cellular hypertrophy in cells like
  cardiac myocytes. Abbreviations: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ATGL, adipose triglyceride
  lipase; βarr, β-arrestin; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; GLUT, glucose transporter; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase;
  JAK, Janus kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MLC, myosin light chain; MSK, mitogen-
  and stress-activated protein kinase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; PLIN, perilipin; RSK, ribosomal
  S6 kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription.'
