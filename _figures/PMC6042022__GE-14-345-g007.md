caption: Interactions between membrane–lipid metabolism, APP processing and β-secretase
  (BACE) activity, cholesterol uptake/efflux and cell cycle regulation. Upregulated
  genes appear in red boxes, downregulated genes in green boxes. Biosynthesis of endogenous
  cholesterol is inhibited (broken arrows) as genes coding for critical enzymes in
  this pathway, including Seladin-1, are downregulated. Aβ peptide channel-forming
  activity, allowed by cholesterol depletion in this model, could increase calcium
  influx (left upper corner of the image). Exogenous cholesterol uptake (APOA4, APOE,
  LDLR) is downregulated while ABCG1, responsible of cholesterol efflux from cells,
  is upregulated. As a result of gene regulation observed in this experimental model,
  the amyloidogenic cleavage of APP seemed to be inhibited. Inside the nucleus, the
  modulation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis led to both
  G1/S and G2/M arrest, resulting in the inhibition of proliferation (see text for
  details). ECS, extracellular space; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
