caption: A potential bypassing pathway by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) upregulation
  leading to antiandrogen resistance. Blockade of androgen receptor (AR) by enzalutamide
  or abiraterone can lead to elevated GR expression which activates a subset of AR
  target genes as well as GR target genes causing tumor growth (red arrows). Combination
  with GR antagonist may overcome GR-driven resistance to antiandrogens.

  of antagonists to this receptor for the treatment of castration resistant prostate
  cancer?.
