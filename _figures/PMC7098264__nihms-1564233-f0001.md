caption: Amyloid-β (Aβ) is produced primarily by neurons in the brain (①) where it
  interacts with lipidated ApoE secreted by microglia and astrocytes (②) in an isoform
  specific manner. ApoE4 promotes the oligomerization and aggregation of Aβ (③) and
  the subsequent deposition of plaques (④) in vivo. Cell surface low-density lipoprotein
  receptor (LDLR), LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1) and heparan sulfate proteoglycan
  (HSPG) receptors mediate the endocytosis of Aβ by astrocytes and microglia. In addition
  to promoting the production and aggregation of Aβ, ApoE4 impairs Aβ clearance by
  reducing cellular uptake and transport across the blood brain barrier in vivo (⑤).
  ApoE2 overexpression enhances the proteolytic degradation of Aβ by insulin-degrading
  enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin produced by microglia and astrocytes (⑥). The enhanced
  proteolysis of neuronal ApoE4 by a chymotrypsin-like serine protease produces neurotoxic
  fragments (⑦). ApoE4-astrocytes exhibit reduced synaptic pruning capacity triggering
  the synaptic accumulation of the complement-component 1q (C1q) protein, possibly
  inducing complement pathway mediated neurodegeneration in vivo (⑧). ApoE4 expression
  also elicits a prolonged increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by astrocytes
  and microglia leading to chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (⑨). ApoE
  isoform specific roles in these processes are indicated. Figure was generated with
  the assistance of Biorender.
