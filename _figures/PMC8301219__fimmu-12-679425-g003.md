caption: Immune checkpoint inhibitors in glioblastoma. The CTLA-4 immune checkpoint
  (A) operates early during the priming phase of the immune response. CTLA-4 preferentially
  binds to CD80/CD86 on the surface of APCs, thus leading to decreased T-cell activation
  and proliferation in the context of tumor antigen presentation. The T cell-expressed
  inhibitory PD-1 receptor interacts with PD-L1 (B), which is expressed on tumor cells.
  Engagement of PD-1 and PDL-1, in the context of tumor antigen- presentation by MHC
  class I molecules, induces T cell apoptosis, inhibits T cell activation/cytotoxicity,
  promotes Tregs proliferation and blocks the production of inflammatory mediators,
  resulting in T cell inactivity. TIM-3/GAL-9 pathway (C) negatively regulates T cell
  immunity and induces T cell apoptosis. *ICP, Immune Checkpoint.
