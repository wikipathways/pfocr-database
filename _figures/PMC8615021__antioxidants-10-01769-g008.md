caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism for the anti-metastatic
  effect of MnHex in breast cancer models. Our study reveals that MnHex inhibits RT-induced
  EMT via blocking AKT/GSK3β/Snail pathway, thereby exerting an anti-metastasis effect
  in mouse models. RT-induced ROS activate AKT, which phosphorylates GSK3β. Inactivation
  of GSK3β blocks degradation of Snail, inducing EMT. MnHex reverses these phenomena,
  which may diminish metastatic potential of RT-treated cancerous cells. While not
  investigated here, the reported data show that Snail is under the control of NF-кB
  signaling the latter reported to be inactivated by MnHex. MnHex, MnTnHex-2-PyP5+;
  RT, radiation therapy; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
  P means a phosphorylated form of the protein. Red and green arrows indicate radiation-
  and MnHex-induced signaling, respectively.
