caption: Metabolic pathways in microglia. (A) Activation of CB2 receptors that are
  expressed in non-neural cells including microglia promotes anti-inflammatory cascades
  through inhibition of NFκB or induction of anti-inflammatory transcriptional factor
  such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ). This pathway
  can be induced by Hu308. (B) P2X7 receptor activation, induces the canonical pro-inflammatory
  transcriptional factors such as NFκB and subsequent production of inflammatory mediators
  such as IL-1 beta and NLPR3. (C) Activation of ligand gated ion channel P2X4 triggers
  the switching on two canonical pathways including NFκB and Ras/ERK/JNK. These proteins
  induce the production of several cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-beta and IL-6. This
  pathway can be inhibited by PSB-12054. (D) Induction of the G-protein coupled receptors
  P2YRs have essential roles in modulating the expression of metabolic pathways such
  as mTOR and their downstream glucose metabolism. The induction of glycolysis through
  mTOR has been implicated in production of several cytokines and chemokines. Ketamine
  triggers the mTOR pathways leading to induction of glycolysis. (E) Prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE 2) is a lipid mediator derived from the fatty acid arachidonic acid. Its
  interaction with the microglial G-protein coupled receptor EP2 induces the activity
  of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inhibits several intracellular pathways including
  PPAR-γ, AKT and IGF1. Celecoxib is s selective COX-2 inhibitor. CB2, cannabinoid
