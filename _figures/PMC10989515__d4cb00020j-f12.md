caption: Biosynthetic pathway of 3-thiaglutamate (24). (A) 3-thiaglutamate (24) formation
  catalyzed by Tgl enzymes. (B) Cysteine addition by the PEARL TglB to the leader
  peptide TglA. The reaction starts with phosphorylation of the C-terminal carboxylate
  of TglA, which then forms an amide bond with the amino group of Cys-tRNACys, followed
  by the hydrolysis of the tRNA to generate TglA-Cys.5
