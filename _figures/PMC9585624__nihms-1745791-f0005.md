caption: (1) Schematic illustration of p62 domain structure. Phox/Bemp1 (PB1) domain
  is involved in the binding of p62 to atypical PKC (aPKC) or ERK1. The ZZ zinc finger
  region and the TRAF6-binding domain, TBS, interact with RIP1 and TRAF6, respectively,
  to activate the p62-mediated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. LIR domain of p62
  binds to LC3 protein to trigger the selective-autophagy pathway. KIR domain next
  to LIR binds to Keap1 and transports Keap1 into the autophagosome for degradation,
  which leads to the activation of the non-canonical Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. The ubiquitin-associated
  (UBA) domain on the C terminus binds to ubiquitinated proteins. Both the PB1 and
  UBA domains play an important role in p62-mediated aggregate formation. (2) Crosstalk
  between Nrf2 and p62 phase separation in selective autophagy. p62 regulates the
  Keap1-Nrf2 pathway through the KIR domain. In canonical Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, Keap1
  mediates Nrf2 ubiquitination and leads to Nrf2 degradation via the proteasome. In
  non-canonical Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, p62 competitively binds to Keap1 leading to the
  stabilization of Nrf2 that can then translocate into the nucleus and activate the
  expression of antioxidant response-related detoxification enzymes, which protects
  against drug-induced hepatotoxicity and cancer cell survival. p62 is a multivalent
  protein and multivalent interactions between p62 and poly-ubiquitin or ubiquitinated
  misfolded proteins promotes p62 droplet formation, which can also recruit Keap1.
  The liquid-like properties of the p62 condensates are also thought to be crucial
  in the initiation of autophagosome formation for aggrephagy.
