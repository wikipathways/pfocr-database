caption: 'A simplified, graphical depiction of the regulation mechanism of the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling by the acute ethanol intoxication (EI) (A) and with the major trauma injury
  (B). (A) Suspected mechanism of the EI influence over the activity of the canonical
  Wnt/β-catenin. According to our findings, we observed that acute alcohol intake
  leads to the elevated levels of Sost gene expression, whose product, sclerostin,
  acts as a natural competitor inhibitor for Wnt receptors. Additionally, we noticed
  increased expression levels of both receptor-interacting protein kinase 4 (RIPK4)
  and A20 protein in the same EI setting. Interestingly, it was reported before that
  RIPK4 appears to be a positive regulator of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, while
  A20 protein seems to be the natural inhibitor of RIPK4 activity and presumably regulates
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling through this kinase (). In our findings, the upregulated
  levels appear to be contradictory to these results; however, both levels of A20
  and RIPK4 seem to compensate each other, and thus, one may suspect an interaction
  between those, which cancels the RIPK4-upregulating activity, as the Wnt/β-catenin-driven
  trauma-induced inflammation is suppressed compared to the ctrl group. However, further
  investigation is required, especially on the field of the base protein expression
  and gene transcription and the involvement of the alcohol as a potential regulator
  of A20–RIPK4 interplay. (B) Trauma-based breakdown of the lung barrier through the
  positive regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the presence of alcohol. The major
  trauma injury affects the internal sclerostin and wnt3a ligand competition of the
  Fzd and LRP-5/6 receptor by favoring the expression of the latter, thus stimulating
  the destruction complex disruption and β-catenin release to the cytosol. In addition,
  β-catenin appears to dissociate from E-cadherin-based AJ (adherens junction) complexes,
  thus disrupting the cell–cell interactions of epithelial cells. At the same time,
  the expression levels of A20 and RIPK4 seem to decrease; however, it is unknown
  if this downregulation influences the withdrawal of the destruction complex from
  the cytosol or maybe it is a time-dependent interaction that requires kinetics-based
  observations, so that the fold change in time of both molecules during the transition
  between off and on states can be followed. APC: adenomatous polyposis coli, AXIN:
  the axis inhibition protein scaffold protein, βTrCP: the beta-transducin repeat
  containing protein, CKI: casein kinase, Fzd: frizzled protein, GSK3β: glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β, LRP 5/6: low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6.'
