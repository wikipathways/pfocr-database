caption: The role of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway induced by HPV infection.
  E6 activates PI3K through the receptor protein tyrosine kinase or direct interaction
  with PI3K. Throughout phosphorylation, PI3K activates Akt. Activated Akt influences
  cell growth through the mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) and angiogenesis.
  Due to the upregulation of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and the blocking
  of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP), mTOR may increase
  cell proliferation. E6 also blocks tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2) to increase
  the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity to increase cell growth
  and block the proapoptotic Bad and Bax proteins.
