caption: Cannabinoids counteract AD neuropathology exacerbated by stress. In direct
  opposition to (chronic) stress-responsive intracellular signaling cascades such
  as those downstream of the adrenergic receptors (ARs) or CRFR1, Cannabinoids inhibit
  cell signaling cascades that promote neuronal cell death. A major effector engaged
  by cannabidiol (CBD) exposure is the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. By binding its cognate
  receptor and co-receptor, Wnt increases the level of stable intracellular β-catenin
  proteins. β-catenin then goes on to inhibit GSK3β, the enzyme responsible for the
  upregulation of tau-phosphorylation, inhibit the beta-secretase (BACE-1), and promote
  the neuroprotective alpha-secretase cleavage of APP (not depicted here). Moreover,
  activation of CB1 receptors (CB1R) can counteract excessive stimulatory G-alpha
  subunit signaling by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity. By engaging the
  mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt pathways, CB1R signaling instead
  promotes the production and release of protective, cell survival factors.
