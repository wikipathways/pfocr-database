caption: Molecular mechanisms contributing to triazole resistance observed in A. fumigatus.
  The scheme represents an A. fumigatus cell - with particular focus on the nucleus
  (N), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the plasma membrane (PM), which depicts
  the most relevant mechanisms of triazole resistance in this fungus. In A. fumigatus,
  a major role in ergosterol biosynthesis is played by the sterol demethylase CYP51A
  (a1). The CYP51A gene is regulated positively by the SrbA protein, which activates
  its expression by binding to two Sterol Regulatory Elements (SRE) in the promoter
  region. When ergosterol biosynthesis is repressed, the access of SrbA to SREs is
  prevented by both the CBC complex and the HapX transcription factor binding to regulatory
  elements located downstream of SREs, resulting in negative regulation of CYP51A
  expression. The sterol demethylase CYP51A, whose native substrate is eburicol, an
  intermediate of ergosterol biosynthesis, is the target of azole drugs (a2). As a
  result, changes in CYP51A sequence or expression are associated with increased MIC
  to triazoles. Amino acid substitutions in either the ligand binding site or the
  catalytic site (b1) modulates triazole binding affinity to CYP51A (b2). A different
  mutation that can be found in combination with SNPs in the CYP51A gene is the presence
  of tandem repeats (TRs) in the promoter region, resulting in an expansion of the
  SREs, unimpeded SrbA binding, and ultimately hyper-activation of CYP51A expression
  (c1). The same outcome was observed in the case of the P88L mutation in the HapE
  subunit of the CCAAT-binding complex (CBC) complex, which diminishes CBC binding
  affinity and its negative regulation of CYP51A expression, although this genotype
  had only been observed in the clinical isolates in which it was first described
  (d1). In both cases, the increased amount of the CYP51A enzyme prevents saturation
  by triazoles and sustains ergosterol biosynthesis (c2 and d2). As for other pathogenic
  fungi, overexpression of either ATP-binding cassettes (ABC) or Major Facilitator
  Superfamily (MFS) type drug efflux pumps had been observed among triazole-resistant
  clinical isolates, which prevents the accumulation of active concentration of drug
  in the cell. In particular, the transcription factor AtrR positively regulates the
  expression of the ABC transporter CDR1B (d1 and d2). Notably, AtrR is also involved
  in the positive regulation of CYP51A. A clinically relevant mutation of a different
  kind is the one affecting the Hmg-CoA reductase encoded by hmg1, which takes part
  in ergosterol biosynthesis by converting Hmg-CoA into Mevalonate. Hmg1 has a conserved
  Sterol Sensing Domain (SSD) involved in regulation of sterol biosynthesis. Mutations
  in the SSD result in a dysregulation of the sterol pathway that eventually translates
  to an increased cellular ergosterol production and triazole resistance (f1 and f2).
