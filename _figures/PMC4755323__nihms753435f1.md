caption: 'NO generation via nitric oxide synthase (NOS) or through the nitrate/nitrite/NO
  pathway. NOS requires molecular oxygen for conversion of L-arginine to NO and citrulline.
  In the settings of hypoxia, NOS-mediated NO generation is very inefficient. On the
  other hand, the activation of nitrate/nitrite to NO occurs to a greater extent in
  the setting of ischemia and acidosis,,  and operates largely through NOS-independent
  mechanisms and is chiefly driven by deoxyhemoglobin.,  This is ideal for HFpEF because
  is generates NO “when” and “where” it is needed. Reprinted by permission from Macmillan
