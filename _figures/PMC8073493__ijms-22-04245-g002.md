caption: Signal transduction related to transactivation of antioxidative genes regulated
  by ncRNAs. Nrf2 is a transcriptional factor that enters the nucleus in response
  to oxidative stress, resulting in increased expression of numerous neuroprotective
  genes. Nrf2 is regulated through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which plays key roles in
  regulating neuroprotection against oxidative stress. BDNF is a ligand of TrkB, which
  promotes neuronal survival and protects against apoptosis mediated through the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. BDNF can also bind to p75NTR—which was identified as a low-affinity nerve
  growth factor receptor—and BDNF can activate the NFκB pathway as well as the p38/JNK
  pathways. Boxes indicate miRNAs that target the signal transduction molecule, and
  the rounded rectangle indicates lncRNA.
