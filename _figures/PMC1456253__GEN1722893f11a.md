caption: Models of Rac signaling in axon pathfinding and neuronal migration. (A) PDE
  ventral axon guidance. Three Rac pathways redundantly control PDE axon guidance.
  MIG-15 is in parentheses, indicating that MIG-15 might act upstream or downstream
  of the Racs. UNC-115 acts downstream of RAC-2 Rac. UNC-34 Ena acts in a redundant
  pathway parallel to the Racs. (B) AQR/PQR migration along their normal routes. The
  involvement of UNC-34 Ena and the Racs is similar to PDE axon guidance; however,
  MIG-15 NIK and UNC-115 abLIM are not involved in this process. (C) PQR direction
  of migration. Initial QL polarity and migration is governed by UNC-40 and DPY-19,
  and later PQR is polarized by a Wnt signal, which induces MAB-5 expression in PQR
  and subsequent posterior migration. MIG-15 acts upstream of MAB-5 and might be required
  for either or both of these polarity events. MIG-2 acts with MIG-15 in controlling
  PQR direction of migration (upstream or downstream), and another unidentified molecule
  (?) likely acts in parallel to MIG-2, as mig-2 mutations alone have no effect on
  PQR direction of migration. CED-10 Rac, RAC-2 Rac, UNC-73 Trio, UNC-34 Ena, and
  UNC-115 abLIM are not involved in PQR direction of migration.

    (A) PDE ventral axon guidance. Three Rac pathways redundantly control PDE axon
    guidance. MIG-15 is in parentheses, indicating that MIG-15 might act upstream
