caption: Mechanism of action of lapatinib. ERBB2 homodimerization or heterodimerization
  with other family members is promoted by binding of ligand (such as epithelial growth
  factor), and possibly by high receptor density secondary to ERBB2 amplification.
  Two key signaling pathways activated by receptor dimerization and activation are
  the Pi3K-Akt pathway, which promotes both cell survival and cell cycle progression,
  and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which stimulates proliferation.
  Lapatinib blocks the catalytic cleft of the ERBB1 and ERBB2 receptors, thereby preventing
  adenosine triphosphate binding and subsequent receptor phosphorylation leading to
  inhibition of downstream mitogenic signaling cascades.
