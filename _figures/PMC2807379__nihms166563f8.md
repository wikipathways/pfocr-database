caption: 'In the hedgehog pathway of vertebrates, upon binding of the Shh ligand to
  the patched (Ptch1) receptor, repression of the smoothened (Smo) receptor to be
  inserted into the cilium membrane is relieved, and posttranslational modification
  of the Gli transcription factors within the cilium induces both their activator
  (GliAct) and repressor (GliR) functions. Several studies in mice have demonstrated
  that ciliary proteins are needed for hedgehog signaling. Recently, the related transcription
  factor Gli-similar 2 (GLIS2) was found to be mutated in NPHP type 7 (from: Huangfu
  & Anderson Development, 2005).'
