caption: 'Wnt/β-catenin signalling. In the absence of Wnt (left), β-catenin phosphorylated
  by casein kinase 1α (CK1) is further phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase
  3 (GSK3) within the ‘destruction complex’ which also includes adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC). The phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by a E3 ubiquitin ligase
  (not shown) which targets it for proteasome degradation. In the nucleus, the target
  genes of the pathway are kept in an ‘OFF’ state by TCF family members. During Wnt
  activation (centre), the destruction complex is sequestered to the cell surface
  via Dishevelled (Dvl), this leads to β-catenin stabilization, which enters into
  the nucleus, interacts with TCF family members and promotes the transcription of
  target genes. Right: β-catenin can also be found as part of the adherens junctions
  where it interacts with E-Cadherin, this interaction can regulate the availability
  of β-catenin for signalling.'
