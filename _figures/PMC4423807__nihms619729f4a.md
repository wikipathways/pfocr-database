caption: 'A: PC1 and PC2 are found on the plasma membrane (PM) in this model. Activation
  of PC1 leads to the activation of PC2 which leads to calcium influx and changes
  in gene transcription. B: Polycystins signaling through the primary cilia. Renal
  cilia bend in response to fluid flow. Bending of the cilia leads to the influx of
  calcium through polycystins. C and D: Polycystins regulating G-protein signaling.
  Binding of PC1 to heterotrimeric G proteins activates the Gα subunit and the release
  of the βγ subunits. This leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclases and MAP kinases
  which can affect several cellular processes such cell proliferation, fluid secretion
  and differentiation. G protein signaling through polycystins can also affect the
  JNK/AP-1 and NFAT/AP-1 pathways. E: Polycystins signaling through the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway. E: Membrane anchored PC1binds to JAK2 and activates it which then phosphorylates
  STAT3. F: PC1 C tail can translocate to the nucleus and coactivate STAT1, 3 and
  6 which were already activated independently through cytokine signaling. Once in
  the nucleus, STAT transcription factors affect the expression of genes required
  for cell proliferation, cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. G: Polycystins
  regulating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. PC1, in a reaction requiring PC2, activates
  JAK2 which leads to the phosphorylation of STAT1. Phosphorylated STAT1 translocates
  to the nucleus and activates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. Activation
  of p21 results in the subsequent inhibition of cdk2 and cell cycle arrest.'
