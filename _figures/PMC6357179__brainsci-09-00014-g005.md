caption: A schematic diagram of CB2R mediated signaling. Δ9-THC and SCBs also bind
  to CB2R. Similar to CB1R, CB2R is also a 7-transmembrane domain G-protein coupled
  receptor that is located in the cell membrane. The activation of CB2R is associated
  with several distinct cellular processes, such as GIRK, adenylate cyclase (AC),
  cAMP, PKA, ERK, p38 MAPK, and Akt pathways, as well as the pathway for the de novo
  synthesis of ceramide. Stimulatory effects are represented by (→) symbols and inhibitory
  effects by (⊥) symbols.
