caption: Interactions between auxin and the MAX pathway. Regulatory signals represented
  in blue were investigated in this study. Step 1, Auxin traveling in the PATS promotes
  MAX3 and MAX4 expression in an AXR1-dependent manner, prevented if IAA12 is stabilized.
  Step 2, Auxin-promoted MAX3 and MAX4 transcript levels lead to increased strigolactone
  production, which leads to reduced bud outgrowth and reduced auxin export from buds
  into the PATS. Step 3, If strigolactones are low, branching is increased and auxin
  level increases, feedback up-regulating MAX3 and MAX4 to increase strigolactone
  levels as in step 1. Step 4, Strigolactone signaling may feedback down-regulate
  transcript levels independent of auxin; the dashed line indicates weak/putative
  interaction. Step 5, Auxin also down-regulates cytokinin synthesis, and cytokinin
  promotes branching. The environment/genotype/developmental program may influence
  each of these regulatory stages tissue specifically. [See online article for color
  version of this figure.]
