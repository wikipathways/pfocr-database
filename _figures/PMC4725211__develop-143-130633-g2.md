caption: The molecular effects of caloric restriction. Caloric restriction causes
  reduced levels of insulin, IGF and amino acids, and increased levels of NAD+ and
  AMP. These changes are sensed by the insulin-IGF signaling (IIS) pathway, target
  of rapamycin (TOR), sirtuins and AMP kinase (AMPK), resulting in enhanced DNA repair,
  stability of the epigenome, stress resistance, oxidative metabolism and ultimately,
  longevity. All of these signals, sensors and responses regulate stem cell behavior.
  Green arrows represent interactions that promote longevity and related phenotypes,
  and red arrows are interactions that suppress these phenotypes.
