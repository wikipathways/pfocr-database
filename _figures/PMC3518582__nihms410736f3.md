caption: Wnt7a signals bidirectionally through divergent pathways to influence both
  presynaptic and postsynaptic assembly and to promote excitatory synapse formation
  and function. Wnt7a is secreted by postsynaptic dendrites of cerebellar granule
  cells and hippocampal neurons. Wnt7a is sufficient to induce presynaptic axon remodeling
  and Synapsin-1 clustering in a GSK3β-dependent manner, potentially through MAP1B-mediated
  cytoskeletal changes. In addition, Wnt7a signals through the Wnt/Ca2+pathway at
  the presynapse to increase frequency of mEPSCs. Wnt7a secreted by dendrites also
  initiates postsynaptic Wnt signaling activity, regulating dendrite growth in a CaMKII
  dependent manner and increasing postsynaptic PSD95 clustering. Other Wnt ligands,
  such as Wnt5a, exert similarly complex activities on both sides of the synapse (see
