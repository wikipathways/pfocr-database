caption: Regulatory function of bleomycin in the fibroblastization of BMSCs in the
  microenvironment of the nucleus pulposus. Bleomycin could induce the fibroblastization
  of BMSCs; it promotes the fibroblastic transformation of AF cells by increasing
  the expression of TGFβ and TGFβR1, which activates the TGFβ/Smad2,3 signaling pathway,
  and finally by increasing the proliferation and migration of these cells. On the
  other hand, it could stimulate the NP cells to secrete MMP3 and MMP13 to remodel
  the ECM in the NP that is beneficial for the migration of fibroblastic cells. Locally,
  injection of bleomycin would increase the Col1a1 and Col3a1 then finally lead to
  accelerated reparative fibrosis
