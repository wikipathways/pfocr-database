caption: Ferroptosis pathway. Ferroptosis can be initiated through Tf endocytosis
  linked to TfR1. Ferric iron (also stored in ferritin) is released from the TfR1
  complex and reduced to ferrous iron that can be stored in ferritin or remain into
  the cytoplasm as a labile iron pool (LIP). LIP is composed mainly by Fe2+, which
  can generate ROS through Fenton reaction and lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis is
  inhibited by GPX4, which depends on GSH, synthesized via the entry of cystine into
  the cell by the system xc−.
