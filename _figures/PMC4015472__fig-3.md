caption: IFN-γ gene expression and signaling are modulated by miRNAs and ARE-binding
  proteins. IFN-γ is primarily induced in NK and T cells by multiple stimuli including
  cytokine ligation and TCR engagement. Induction of IFN-γ is mediated by several
  transcription factors including T-bet, Eomes, and PI3K. IFN-γ signals in an autocrine
  or paracrine fashion on all nucleated cells by activating JAK1 and JAK2 upon engagement
  of IFN-γ-receptor (IFNGR, composed of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 subunits). Phosphorylation
  of the IFN-γ-receptor by JAK1/2 leads to the recruitment and activation of STAT1.
  Homodimers of phosporylated STAT1 translocate into nucleus and bind to GAS sequences
  in the promoters of ISGs and miRNAs to activate their transcription. The 3′ UTR
  of IFN-γ contains AREs that alter mRNA stability by recruiting ARE-BPs such as TTP,
  HuR, and GAPDH. miR-29 and miR-155 have also been extensively implicated in modulating
  transcription, post-transcription events, and signaling of IFN-γ. miR-29, a highly
  expressed miRNA in immune cells, regulates IFN-γ expression by targeting the 3′
  UTR of a transcription factor Eomes. In contrast, miR-155 induced by IL-18, CD16,
  and TCR stimulation enhances IFN-γ expression by downregulating SHIP1, a negative
  regulator of PI3K. miR-155 has been reported to have both positive and negative
  regulatory effects on IFN-γ signaling, while miR-155 suppresses IFN-γ mediated signaling
  by targeting the 3′ UTR of IFNGR1 and decreasing surface expression of IFN-γ-receptor;
  it can augment IFN-γ-mediated signaling by downregulating SOCS1, negative regulator
  of Jak/STAT signaling pathway. Jak, Janus kinase; TTP, tristetraprolin; HuR, Hu-Antigen
