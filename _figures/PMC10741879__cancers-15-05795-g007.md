caption: Schematic model showing the tumor-progression-promoting interaction between
  CRC cells and TAMs. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are more likely to adopt
  an M2-type polarization in response to the high lactate level in the tumor microenvironment.
  This leads to an increase in the secretion of CCL8 by polarized TAMs, which binds
  to the CCR5 receptor on tumor cells and promotes their proliferation and metastasis
  via the mTOR/70S6K/4EBP1 signaling pathway
