caption: CCN1 signaling and crosstalk with TNFα. Signal transduction initiated by
  CCN1, a prototypical member of the family, is mediated primarily through binding
  to α6β1 and syndecan-4 in fibroblasts to support activities including cell adhesion,
  although αvβ5 is also necessary for fibroblast migration and crosstalk with TNFα
  (; ). Cell adhesion to CCN1 activates FAK, paxillin, and Rac1, leading to actin
  cytoskeleton reorganization, cell spreading, and formation of filopodia and lamellipodia
  (). Adhesion to CCN1 also induces sustained ERK activation, an activity that is
  mediated through binding to α6β1-HSPG (). CCN1 induces fibroblast apoptosis by activating
  p53 and Bax (), and converts TNFα from a pro-mitogenic factor into a potent apoptotic
  molecule through the Rac1-dependent generation of ROS via 5-lipoxygenase and the
  mitochondria (). CCN1/TNFα-induced apoptosis occurs rapidly (within 4 hours of treatment)
  without requiring de novo protein synthesis, indicating that CCN1 activates this
  pathway directly.
