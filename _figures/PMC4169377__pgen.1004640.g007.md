caption: A. A model for the DNA duplication-reversion cycle serving as a genetic toggling
  mechanism for the β-lactamase substrate spectrum. Same-strand complementary sequences
  (SCSs)- or direct repeat-mediated DNA duplication can be selected for in a β-lactamase
  gene by exposure to ceftazidime (CAZ). The resulting tandem repeat (TR) in the omega
  loop encodes a duplicated peptide, which results in an alteration in the active
  site cavity extending the substrate spectrum to include CAZ (substrate spectrum
  B). The β-lactamase gene with a TR mutation can be reverted to the wild type by
  exposure to an original antibiotic, amoxicillin (AMX) (substrate spectrum A). The
  reversion of the TR does not require direct repeats or SCSs but is likely mediated
  by the replication slippage mechanism, involving general cellular pathway. B. Models
  for DNA secondary structures. A model is shown for mispaired direct repeats (DRs)
  that can occur during DNA replication, leading to DNA duplication of the bordered
  DNA template. TRs 1 to 3 () and M-TRs 1 to 2 () may have resulted from this mechanism.
  Two models of DNA structures that may form through non-canonical base pairings between
  SCS elements. Such DNA structures may predispose to DNA duplication via an unknown
  mechanism. Lastly, a model is shown for a DNA structure formed by strand slippage
  during replication, which leads to reversion.
