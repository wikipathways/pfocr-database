caption: Proteasome-related events potentially participate in the RAD6-mediated DNA
  damage response. (A) Network analysis of the RAD6-interacting proteins before X-ray
  irradiation. The numbers near the connecting lines between proteins refer to the
  number of times that the two specific proteins appeared in one pathway, which was
  analyzed by use of the indicated database. (B) KEGG pathway analysis of the RAD6-interacting
  proteins before X-ray irradiation. Drug metabolism-cytochrome P4 …, drug metabolism-cytochrome

  proteins after X-ray irradiation. The numbers near the connecting lines between
