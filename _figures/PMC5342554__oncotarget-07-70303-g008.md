caption: A diagram was generated to display the speculated signaling network downstream
  NTR1 and the interaction among a series of molecules regulating the activation of
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The interaction of NTS and NTR1 induces the activation
  of Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) downstream cascades and
  the NF-κB pathway which promotes the production of Wnt proteins. Enhanced Wnt signaling
  causes the recruitment of dishevelled protein to block GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation
  of β-catenin, whose ubiquitin-dependent degradation in the proteasome increases
  β-catenin accumulates and transports to the nucleus, subsequently induces cellular
  responses via forming a complex with Lefs/TcFs. The transcription of Snail is upregulated
  by β-catenin-Lefs/Tcfs complex and the degradation of Snail is suppressed by attenuated
  GSK3β activity, which increased the expression of Snail in plasma and then inhibits
  E-cadherin expression by binding to E-box in the promoter of E-cadherin gene. Therefore,
  HCC cells displayed characteristic EMT features, including decreasing expression
  of E-cadherin and accumulation of β-catenin in cytoplasm.
