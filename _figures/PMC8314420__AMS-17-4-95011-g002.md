caption: A simplified model of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Abnormalities of this
  cascade may lead to different types of HHT. Several genes are indicated in HHT pathogenesis.
  Endoglin, the product of ENG gene expression, is responsible for signal modulation
  between ALK1 and ALK5 receptors. Mutations in ACVRL1 result in faulty interaction
  of ALK1 with other TGF signaling proteins. BMP9 protein, the product of GDF2, interacts
  with both ALK1 and endoglin. SMAD4 is involved in later steps of this signaling
  cascade together with other SMAD proteins. Its malfunction may also lead to HHT
