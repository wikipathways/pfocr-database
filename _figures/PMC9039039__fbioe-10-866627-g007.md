caption: (A) Diagram of bone targeting and functional EC-exos (). (B) FLSs-exos carrying
  miR-486-5p inhibited Tob1 to activate the BMP/Smad signaling pathway, thus enhancing
  osteoblast proliferation, mineralization, and differentiation, then alleviating
  RA (). (C) Schematic mechanism of bone healing accelerated by the damaged brain.
  Damaged neurons released exosomes, which were rich in miR-328a-3p and miR-150-5p.
  They could target FOXO4 and CBL and thus promoted osteogenesis ().
