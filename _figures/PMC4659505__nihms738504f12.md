caption: Complexity of the direct and indirect effects of mTOR on signaling pathways.
  Metabolic signaling through insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS) leads to activation
  of PI3K and subsequent recruitment of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1)
  to the cell membrane. Here, PDK1 phosphorylates Akt at Thr-308, which in turn triggers
  phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 by mTORC2. Upon its activation, Akt becomes capable
  of inhibiting the TSC1/2 complex, leading to the stimulation of mTORC1 and its downstream
  targets 4EBP1 and p70S6K1. The resulting stimulation of p70S6K1 activity can then
  cause negative feedback of the mTOR signaling cascade at several points of the pathway.
  Thus, increased p70S6K1 activity can lead to phosphorylation of IRS, leading to
  degradation of the receptor. Active p70S6K1 also negatively regulates Akt signaling
  through inhibition of PDGFR and ERK/MAPK signaling. The two mTOR complexes are also
  able to regulate each other in an inter-complex feedback loop, as activation of
  p70S6K1 stimulates phosphorylation of the RICTOR subunit of mTORC2, causing a decrease
  in Akt signaling thorough impaired phosphorylation of Ser-473. In addition, mTORC2,
  via p70S6K1, also inhibits IRS, leading to a reduction in Akt signaling.
