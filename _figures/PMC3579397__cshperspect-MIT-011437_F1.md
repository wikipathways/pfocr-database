caption: Sulfide production. Methionine, derived from alimentary sources, is converted
  into S-adenosylmethionine by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). S-adenosylmethionine
  is hydrolyzed to homocysteine by glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT). Cystathionine
  β-synthase (CBS) transfers serine to homocysteine and produces cystathionine. Cystathionine
  γ-lyase (CSE) converts cystathionine to cysteine (Cys). One pathway of cysteine
  metabolism involves its oxidation to cysteine sulfinate by cysteine deoxygenase
  (CDO), which is then converted to hypotaurine by cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase
  (CSD); hypotaurine is eventually oxidated to taurine by hypotaurine dehydrogenase
  (HDH). In mitochondria, cysteine can be converted to 3-mercaptopyruvate by aspartate
  aminotransferase (AAT), which can then be converted to H2S by 3-mercaptopyruvate
  sulfur transferase. The conversion of cysteine sulfinate to sulfinyl pyruvate by
  AAT, followed by a nonenzymatic reaction, can also yield sulfite, which is then
  oxidized to sulfate by sulfite oxidase (SUOX) in a glutathione (GSH)-dependent process.
  The H2S produced by either AAT or CBS/CSE can be further oxidized by a sulfur dioxygenase
  (SDO/ETHE1)-dependent pathway (see ). The metabolic pathway carried out by Moco-dependent
  enzymes is encircled in red (see text for details).
