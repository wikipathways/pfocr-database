caption: A schematic diagram of RRx-001 mediated improvement of neuroinflammation.
  In LPS-stimulated microglia, activated TLR4 recruits MyD88 and TIRAP to phosphorylate
  TAK1, which subsequently promotes the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines by activating NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, the transcriptional
  expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome is also increased to activate caspase-1, which
  leads to the maturation and release of IL-1β. In addition, the transcription and
  expression of Nox isoforms are mediated by transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1
  to induce oxidative stress, which exacerbates inflammation through activation of
  these two pathways. However, RRx-001 pretreatment inhibits the activation of TAK1,
  resulting in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation, and Nox-mediated oxidative stress through the NF-κB and MAPK signaling
  pathways.
