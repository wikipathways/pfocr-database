caption: Metabolic reprograming during anchorage-independent growth. Metabolic reprograming
  during anchorage-independent growth include isocitrate dehydrogenases-1 (IDH1)-dependent
  reductive carboxylation of glutamine, upregulation of pentose phosphate pathway,
  the enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, and altering sphingolipid
  diversity. mtROS; mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, GSH; glutathione-SH.
