caption: Outline of force-sensing proteins in cardiovascular system. (a) Force-sensing
  protein expression (Piezo, cytoskeleton and YAP) in response to cardiovascular mechanotransduction
  and diseases. When the cells perceive mechanical stimuli, Piezo cationic channels
  on the cell membrane can respond to these force signals to induce the robust formation
  of cytoskeleton structures to further transmit these biomechanical alternations
  into nuclei by the regulation of Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. These force-sensing
  proteins play the crucial role in regulating cardiovascular diseases. (b) Interaction
  mechanism between Piezo cationic channels and cardiovascular system. Piezo cationic
  channels are opened by the stretch-mediated mechanics to affect calcium influx and
  mTOR signaling to regulate the cell proliferation, growth, heart remodeling and
  cell cycle in cardiovascular system
