caption: Plant Reactome pathway features and functionalities. (A) Pathway hierarchy
  navigation (upper panel) and pathway diagram view (lower panel); (B) Species selector
  for viewing pathway projections in any of the available 106 projected plant species.
  (C) Species comparison feature shows curated DNA synthesis pathway in the reference
  species (blue color) and overlay of projected orthologous A. thaliana matches (yellow
  colored blocks; the complete and partial overlap respectively suggest same of different
  number of homologs between two species, whereas, blue boxes suggest absence of Arabidopsis
  homologs. (D) Baseline gene expression data for selected entity in pathway diagram
  served by EMBL-EBI Gene Expression Atlas (lower panel); (E) A gene-gene interaction
  from Bio Analytical Resource (BAR) is displayed over the A. thaliana DNA synthesis
  pathway that includes 247 unique interactors for five genes (upper panel) and an
  enlarged view of 107 interactors associated with the gene AT5G26680 is shown as
  spoke-and-wheel overlay (lower panel).
