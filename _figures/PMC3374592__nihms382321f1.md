caption: There are three major models for the crosstalk between endocytosis and cell
  signalling. a | Downregulation of signals through the degradation of receptor complexes.
  Receptor Tyr kinases (RTKs) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal at the
  plasma membrane through their effectors, such as SRC (for RTKs) and β-arrestin or
  activated G proteins (for GPCRs), which are then released as the receptors become
  internalized into early endosomes that undergo acidification. After trafficking
  of receptors into the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular endosomes,
  these organelles fuse with lysosomes and the receptors are degraded. b | The mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway provides an example in which signalling downstream
  of RTKs or GPCRs can be maintained by early endosomes. The signal is generated at
  the plasma membrane and continues signalling in early endosomes through formation
  of RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK (RAS–RAF–MAPK/ERK kinase (also known as MAPKK)–extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase) complexes bound to the growth factor receptor-bound 2 (GRB2)
  adaptor for RTKs or β-arrestin for GPCRs. Activated ERK is released from the endosome
  and translocates to the nucleus to phosphorylate its targets. c | For signalling
  downstream of transforming growth factor-β receptor (TGFβR), as well as other receptors,
  the signal is actually generated on signalling endosomes. The ligand-bound TGFβR
  is internalized into endosomes upon phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic tail. SMAD
  anchor for receptor activation (SARA) is an FYVE domain (phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-binding)
  protein that recognizes this activated receptor and recruits the SMAD2 transcription
  factor to signalling endosomes. Phosphorylated SMAD2 is then released, entering
  the nucleus to promote transcriptional activation.
