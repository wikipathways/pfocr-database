caption: Intracellular mechanisms underlying Wnt-induced axon guidance. (A) Wnts promote
  commissural axon attraction via the activation of the PI3K-atypical PKCζ signaling
  and the PCP pathway. The PCP pathway is inhibited through the Dvl-dependent phosphorylation
  of Fz3, which as a result remains in the plasma membrane. The local expression of
  Vangl2 in the filopodia of the growth cone prevents the Dvl-induced phosphorylation
  of Fz3 upon binding of Wnt5a and results in the internalization of Fzd3 and the
  activation of the PCP pathway. (B) Wnt5a repels cortical axons by binding to both
  Fz and Ryk receptors, which allow the entrance of calcium via the TRP channels.
  Activation of Ryk alone results in axon growth promotion, whereas co-activation
  of Ryk and Fz is required for axon repulsion.
