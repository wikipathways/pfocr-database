caption: Neuroinflammation signaling pathway activity and member DEGs from mThy1-α-synuclein
  overexpression at 10 months. Observed DEGs at 10 months were submitted to Qiagen’s
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for core analysis and enrichment of canonical pathways.
  Identified DEGs determining enrichment of this pathway are plotted on the dot plot
  with significance levels based on a −log10(adjusted p-value) while the x-axis represents
  the observed log2 fold change. Measured DEGs within the pathway are outlined in
  purple and colored either red for up-regulated or green for down-regulated. IPA
  leverages observed changes to calculate a Z-score useful for predicting activation
  (orange) or inhibition (blue) within the pathway. Yellow interactions represent
  inconsistent downstream measurements when considering the calculated prediction
  while any gray interactions could not be predicted
