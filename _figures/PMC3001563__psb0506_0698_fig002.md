caption: Putative model integrating eATP and NO-regulated signaling pathways for root
  hair growth in Arabidopsis. eATP putative receptor, NADPH oxidase and Ca2+ channel
  are shown in the plasma membrane (PM). Depending on the cell type and the external
  stimulus, eAT P would induce Ca2+ channel activity and increase [Ca2+]cyt leading
  to NO accumulation and ROS production via NADPH oxidase stimulation. In addition,
  NO may regulate Ca2+ channels by feedback activation. NO may also promote the formation
  of cGMP messenger. In turn, actin cytoskeleton may act as a downstream effector
  of NO signal transduction pathway. In parallel, auxin through NO could modulate
  root hair growth.
