caption: Role of anthocyanin in modulating PI3K/Akt/FOXO pathway in obesity. Anthocyanins
  enhance insulin signaling by upregulating the phosphorylation of key molecules in
  the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to the phosphorylation and inhibition of FOXO1. This
  prevents FOXO1 from translocating to the nucleus, thereby downregulating the expression
  of gluconeogenic genes and lipogenesis. These effects contribute to improved glucose
  metabolism and reduced insulin resistance. Upward arrows indicate upregulation or
  downregulation of respective pathways
