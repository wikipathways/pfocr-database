caption: The tumor (SVZ) micro-environment. GICs (light purple) are regulated by the
  activation of oncogenes or by environmental conditions such as hypoxia or acidosis.
  GICs are able to express pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF (vascular endothelial
  growth factor), able to stimulate the outgrowth of new blood vessels (red) which
  will in the end help to maintain tumorigenicity. Endothelial cells are also able
  to produce nitric oxide in the endothelium through the activation of eNOS. Activated
  Notch signaling by nitric oxide in GICs is notably known to accelerate tumor progression.
  Defects in growth factor signaling pathways usually result in the activation of
  downstream growth factor signaling such as the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway which
  has been shown to be an important regulator of glioma cell survival and GICs’ radioresistant
  abilities. Neural progenitor cells (yellow) display antitumor effects by secreting
  tumor suppressors in the niche such as bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7), inducing
  GICs’ differentiation. Astrocytes (dark blue) are closely associated with the vascular
  endothelium of the niche and were shown to secrete neurotrophic factors capable
  of driving the invasive properties of GBM cells (CXCL12, SIP, and GDNF). Astrocytes
  also express high levels AEG-1. Reports suggest that AEG-1 impacts on brain tumor
  invasion notably through the activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
