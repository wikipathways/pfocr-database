caption: Diagram depicting proliferative and survival signaling pathways in cells.
  In vitro, the homomeric and heteromeric nAChRs jointly stimulate the indicated signaling
  cascades. Yellow arrows indicate proliferative pathways triggered by nAChRs. This
  activation triggers the MAP kinase pathway, leading to DNA synthesis. Sustained
  mitogenic signaling induces to S-phase entry. Black arrows indicate nAChR survival
  and proliferation pathways triggered by intracellular calcium increases involving
  indirect activation of β-adrenergic receptor signaling, which in turn, induces activation
  of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor leading to the cascade indicated by blue
  arrows. α7 nAChR and heteromeric α-βnAChRs are activated by their agonists. Influx
  of Ca2+ and other cations through the nAChRs and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels trigger
  the release of adrenaline and noradrenalin. Adenylyl cyclase activation downstream
  of β-adrenergic receptors induce the cyclic AMP-protein kinase A (PKA)-CREB (cAMP
  response element-binding protein) pathway, transactivates epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) and induces the release of EGF, and perhaps another growth factors.
  The responsiveness of this pathway is enhanced by α7 nAChR-mediated activation of
  Ras through β-arrestin-dependent SRC signaling. In turn, the EGFR activates the
  Akt pathway and its downstream effectors, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein
  (XIAP)-survivin and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB).
