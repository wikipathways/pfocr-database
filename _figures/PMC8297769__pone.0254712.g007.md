caption: Cardiac IPC, induced by repeated non-lethal ischemia and reperfusion of coronary
  artery, activates the renal EPO pathway. EPO is produced and released, and binds
  to myocardial EPO receptors, thus possibly activating the cardioprotective STAT3
  signaling pathway. In the myocardium of WT mice, cardiac IPC-induced STAT3 activation
  was suppressed by SOCS3. In contrast, in the myocardium of SOCS3-CKO mice, cardiac
  IPC-induced STAT3 activation was enhanced and prolonged, thus synergistically preventing
  myocardial infarction after I/R. IPC, ischemic preconditioning; EPO, erythropoietin;
  WT, wild-type; I/R, ischemia reperfusion.
