caption: The models of Melatonin and DADA effects on FA synthesis during remyelination.
  (A) In physiological conditions, citrate is produced from imported glucose or pyruvate
  and from imported NAA into the oligodendrocyte to be utilized as a substrate for
  FA synthesis required from myelination. Proper function of PDC warranty the synthesis
  of this citrate. (B) During EAE, PDC function remains intact, which is involved
  in pyruvate conversion into citrate. The other precursor of citrate, NAA, shows
  significant reduction, which is suggested to reduce the citrate level, which might
  slow down FA synthesis and subsequently the remyelination in EAE mice. (C) Melatonin
  therapy recovers the reduced level of NAA in EAE mice in order to increase the citrate
  levels required for FA synthesis. On the other hand, melatonin increases PDK4 expression
  which acts as an inhibitor of PDC, leading to suppression of citrate synthesis.
  However, the oligodendrocyte still imports the NAA from axons or any other unknown
  sources to have enough citrate for FA synthesis. (D) Since PDC inhibition by melatonin
  could be considered as a side effect of melatonin therapy, DADA administered in
  combination with melatonin would suppress the function of PDK4 and rescue the PDC
  from inhibiting PDK4 function. This leads to the recovery of citrate synthesis by
  the PDC-dependent pathway, while NAA, another source of citrate, is already high
  due to melatonin, resulting together into the fast formation of sufficient sources
  for FA synthesis in remyelination. Yellow arrow shows reduction, green arrow shows
