caption: Tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways. The heme and chlorophyll biosynthetic
  pathways diverge at protoporphyrin IX (ProtoIX). The negative feedback of heme on
  GTR (Glu-tRNA reductase) is indicated. In C. reinhardtii, conversion of protochlorophyllide
  (PChlide) to chlorophyllide (Chlide) can occur in a light-dependent (marked as “L”)
  and a light-independent manner (“D”). In the study of Duanmu et al. (), the pathway
  is perturbed by introducing mammalian biliverdin reductase (BVR) for heme depletion.
  The activity of HMOX1 and PCYA is demonstrated by introducing cyanobacteriochrome
  (CBCR) reporter and by showing that it covalently binds PCB chromophore. The different
  steps affected in the gun and hy mutants are indicated. ALA, δ-aminolevulinic acid;
  Chl, chlorophyll; CHL H/D/I, Mg-chelatase, subunit H/D/I; FC, Fe-chelatase; GSA,
  glutamate 1-semialdehyde; PCYA, phytochromobilin synthase.
