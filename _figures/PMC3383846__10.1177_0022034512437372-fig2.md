caption: Signaling pathways that regulate cytokine AREs post-transcriptionally. The
  p38 pathway is the best-described signaling pathway that regulates AU-rich element
  (ARE)-mediated cytokine degradation. Activation of IL-1β receptors and the Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) family stimulates p38 MAPK signaling via signaling intermediates,
  including MKK3/6. Active p38 dictates mRNA stability through activation of MK2,
  which subsequently phosphorylates and inactivates TTP. Once inactivated, phosphorylated
  TTP dissociates from the ARE region of cytokine transcripts to enhance mRNA stability
  and translation, thereby causing an increase in cytokine secretion that can promote
  chronic inflammation and inflammatory disease progression if not properly regulated.
  In addition, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway can also post-transcriptionally
  regulate mRNAs through AKT phosphorylation of RBPs. This phosphorylation alleviates
  the mRNAs of RBPs that normally destabilize the mRNA and results in increased mRNA
  stability and thus increased cytokine protein production and secretion, which, if
  not properly controlled, can induce chronic inflammation.
