caption: All components of the vascular wall including endothelial cells produce ROS
  from endogenous sources. Enzymatic sources include the NADPH oxydase complexes,
  lipoxygenases, xanthine oxidase, uncoupled eNOS, uncoupled mitochondrial electron
  transport. They are also exposed to exogenous sources of ROS generated by drugs,
  ionizing radiation, ischemia/reoxygenation, shear stress and circulating cells including
  neutrophils and cancer cells.
