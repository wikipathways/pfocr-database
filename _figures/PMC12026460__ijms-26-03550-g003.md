caption: Comprehensive mechanism by which Irisin influences fibrosis Via Sirtuin 1
  (Sirt1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/nuclear
  respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), and related pathways. This figure summarizes how Irisin
  significantly reduces the expression of fibrosis-related genes by directly inhibiting
  TGF-β activation and blocking Smad signaling through receptor binding. Additionally,
  Irisin activates Sirt1, which mediates the deacetylation of Smad3, further suppressing
  Smad complex formation. By regulating the PGC-1α/NRF-1 pathway, Irisin helps maintain
  mitochondrial homeostasis, while enhancing mitophagy through the PTEN-induced kinase
  1 (PINK1)/Parkin pathway to clear damaged mitochondria and improve intracellular
  equilibrium. Collectively, these actions inhibit fibrotic progression, mitigate
  tissue damage, and offer new insights for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis. This
