caption: Schematic representation of cGAS/STING signaling in MICs. cGAS is a cytosolic
  PRR that recognizes and cleaves cytosolic dsDNA into CDN called cGAMP. The cytosolic
  dsDNA can be self-derived, including the mitochondrial DNA, produced during ER and
  genotoxic stress and mitochondrial stress and death. Also, MICs can get other cells’
  DNA by phagocytosis, exosomes, and EVs along with pathogens. STING by serving as
  an adapter protein recognizes cGAMP. In addition to the cGAS-derived cGAMP, MICs
  can uptake extracellular cGAMP expelled from cancer cell in TIME through different
  transporters. This induces STING ERGIC movement. ERGIC localized STING interacts
  with the phosphorylated IRF8 (IRF8 phosphorylation occurs as a result dsDNA recognition
  by cGAS/STING signaling pathway). This interaction induces STING polymerization
  and its interaction with TBK1 and TRAF6. The interaction between STING and TBK1
  induces STING phosphorylation. The STING-bound phosphorylated TBK1 induces IRF3
  phosphorylation. Phosphorylated IRF3 induces transcription of ISGs, including type
  1 IFN genes. Hence, cGAS/STING/IRF8/TBK1/IRF3 axis is critical to produce type 1
  IFNs and propagate type 1 IFN-mediated immune response, including the antitumor
  immunity. On the other hand, TBK1-mediated TRAF6 activation is critical for another
  canonical cGAS/STING signaling pathway involving NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory
  immune response. Thus, regulated cGAS/STING signaling critically maintains immune
  homeostasis and helps to clear cancer cells, whereas its dysregulation causes chronic
  inflammation that may lead to cancer development. Kindly see the text for details
