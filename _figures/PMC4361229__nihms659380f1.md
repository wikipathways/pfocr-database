caption: Two-signal hypothesis of pollen-induced allergic inflammation. ROS generated
  by the pollen NADPH oxidases causes GSSG or 4-HNE production and DNA damage. GSSG,
  4-HNE, and DNA damage induce the production of interleukin-8, a proinflammatory
  cytokine that attracts and activates neutrophils. Activated neutrophils also generate
  ROS. Pollen NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress induces mitochondrial ROS generation.
  These ROS mediated by innate signaling pathways ‘signal 1’ promote the allergic
  inflammation ‘signal 2’, the classical allergic inflammation pathway. APC, antigen-presenting
  cell; 4-HNE, 4-hydroxynonenal; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; SOD, superoxide dismutase.
