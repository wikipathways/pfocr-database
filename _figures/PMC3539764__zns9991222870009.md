caption: Schematic illustration of 22C11-induced BACE1 accumulation and Aβ production
  in neurons. Following synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, pro-BACE1 traffics
  through the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it matures before localizing to the
  plasma membrane. a, Under normal conditions, surface BACE1 is reinternalized through
  the endosomal pathway and may be recycled from endosomes to the TGN back to the
  plasma membrane. Alternatively, BACE1 can interact with GGA3, which targets BACE1
  to lysosomes for degradation. b, Dimerization of APP and subsequent activation of
  caspase-3 results in the cleavage of GGA3, preventing GGA3 from shuttling BACE1
  to lysosomes. This allows BACE1 to accumulate in endosomes, resulting in increased
  cleavage of APP and increased Aβ production.
