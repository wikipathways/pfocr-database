caption: Simplified representation of the effects of ketogenic diet (KD) on the adenosine
  (ADO) system. Ketogenic diet increases mitochondrial ATP production. ATP is a metabolic
  precursor of adenosine. Intracellular adenosine rapidly equilibrates with extracellular
  adenosine through equilibrative nucleoside transporters. Hence, an increase in mitochondrial
  ATP production increases extracellular adenosine and the activation of the anticonvulsant
  adenosine A1 receptor (A1R). Ketogenic diet also inhibits both forms of adenosine
  kinase. Blockade of ADK-S in the cytoplasm reduces intracellular adenosine metabolism,
  further boosting intracellular and extracellular adenosine. Blockade of SDK-L in
  the nucleus blocks the flux of methyl groups through the transmethylation pathway,
  which is responsible for adding methyl groups to DNA. Therefore, KD reduces global
  DNA methylation status an important antiepileptogenic epigenetic mechanism. These
  effects of the KD on ADK are particular relevant for epilepsy, because maladaptive
  processes lead to overexpression of ADK during epileptogenesis, resulting in an
  intranuclear and intracellular sink of adenosine, which drives increased DNA methylation.
