caption: 'Antioxidant and anti-aging mechanisms of MBPs. MBPs may exert antioxidant
  and anti-aging effects by regulating Keap1-Nrf2-ARE through the PI3K/AKT and MAPK
  pathways. CAT: catalase, SOD: superoxide dismutase, T-AOC: total antioxidant capacity,
  MDA: malondialdehyde, GSH: glutathione, Bax: BCL2-Associated X, Bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma-2.
  Excess ROS by generating superoxide anions via Bax and Bcl-2 in cellular mitochondria.
  MBPs regulate ROS content by providing protons, electrons and chelating metal ions.
  MBPs regulate the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signalling pathway through the PI3K/AKT and MAPK
  pathways. Red arrows indicate that MBPs regulate ROS content by providing protons,
  electrons, and chelating metal ions. The grey arrows indicate that excess ROS are
  harmful by generating superoxide anions. Green arrows indicate that MBPs and ROS
  react via different pathways within the cell'
