caption: Proposed organization and role of adenosine receptors in mitochondria. Adenosine
  receptors are localized in the plasma membrane and may undergo internalization via
  endocytosis, targeting the mitochondria and localizing mainly to the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, with the possibility of being translocated to the inner mitochondrial
  membrane. Within this context, they can be activated by mitochondrially derived
  adenosine, thereby modulating ATP synthesis through an as-yet-uncharacterized mechanism.
  This regulatory pathway may involve modifications in mitochondrial morphology and/or
  the function of specific electron transport chain complexes. Consequently, the adenosine
  receptors' signaling efficacy is likely augmented by this emerging bioenergetic
  function
