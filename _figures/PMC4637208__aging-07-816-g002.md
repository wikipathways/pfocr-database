caption: Protein lysates were obtained from hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts after 48 h treatment
  with azathioprine, taxol or vehicle. Peptides obtained after trypsin digestion were
  analysed via LC-MS/MS on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. Label-free quantitative
  proteomics was used to detect changes in protein abundances across vehicle-treated
  and drug-treated fibroblast extracts. The proteomics data sets were further analysed
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and a cancer survival analysis tool (kmplot.com).
