caption: The sphingolipid metabolic pathway. De novo synthesis of endoplasmatic reticulum
  (ER) ceramide is initiated (entry) by serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT)-driven
  condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA, and further downstream activity of ceramide
  synthases (CerS1-6; giving rise to ceramides of different chain lengths) and desaturase
  (DES). Ceramide is reversibly converted into (1) sphingomyelin by sphingomyelin
  synthase 1 or 2 (SMS1/2) [reversed by acid (ASM), neutral (NSM, isoforms 1–3), or
  alkaline sphingomyelinases (alkSM)], (2) galactosylceramide [by galactosyltransferase
  (CGT) (reversed by galactosylceramidase (GALC))], (3) C1P by ceramide kinase (CK)
  [reversed by ceramide-1-phosphatase (CP)], (4) glucosylceramide by glucosylceramide
  synthase (GCS) [reversed by glucocerebrosidase (GBa)], or (5) sphingosine by acid
  or neutral ceramidase (AC, NC) (reversed by ceramide synthase, CerS). By phosphorylation,
  sphingosine kinases (SK1/2) generate S1P from sphingosine (reversed by S1P phosphatase,
  S1PP). S1P is irreversibly degraded into hexadecenal and ethanolamine by the activity
  of the S1P lyase (SPL) (exit of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway). Enzymes involved
  are marked in blue, and bioactive sphingolipids are highlighted in green.
