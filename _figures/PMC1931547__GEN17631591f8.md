caption: Model for function of PLX-2 and EFN-4 in MAB-20 signaling. (A) In early embryonic
  movements of ventral neuroblasts, MAB-20 and EFN-4 may act in a common pathway that
  could promote adhesion between neighboring neuroblasts or between neuroblasts and
  unknown substrate cells. (B) In later embryonic development, MAB-20 prevents ectopic
  cell contacts between epidermal cells; EFN-4 and PLX-2 have redundant functions
  in this process. EFN-4 may also play an antagonistic role as the frequency of late
  embryonic arrest is reduced in mab-20 efn-4 double mutants relative to mab-20 single
  mutants. (C) In postembryonic development of male tail rays, MAB-20 and EFN-4 play
  nonredundant roles in preventing inappropriate adhesion of ray cells; PLX-2 plays
  a cryptic role that is revealed only in mab-20 hypomorphic backgrounds.
