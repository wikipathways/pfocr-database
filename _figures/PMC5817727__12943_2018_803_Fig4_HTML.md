caption: Regulation of PTEN, a major regulator of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.
  Growth factors bind receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) on the extracellular cell membrane,
  which leads to the recruitment and binding of PI3K (directly or through adaptor
  proteins) to its cytoplasmic domain through its regulatory subunit (P85). Activated
  PI3K phosphorylates of PI(4,5)P2 to PI(3,4,5)P3, which occurs through its catalytic
  subunit (P110). The serine/threonine kinases Akt and PDK1 are recruited to the membrane
  after binding to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PI(3,4,5)P3. PDK1 and mTORC2
  phosphorylate and activate Akt, which phosphorylates a number of downstream protein
  targets with the overall effect of enhancing cell proliferation, metabolism and
  survival whilst inhibiting apoptosis. PTEN is a major negative regulator of PI3K/Akt
  signalling through its phosphoinositide phosphatase activity which acts to directly
  antagonise Pi3K activity by dephosphorylating PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(4,5)P2. PTEN abundance
  and activity is highly regulated through various complementary mechanisms working
  at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels (modified
  from [])
