caption: Translational impact of the mTOR signaling pathway. Multiple cellular pathways
  are regulated by signaling from mTOR complexes, including regulation of autophagy,
  lipid metabolism, and control of actin cytoskeleton in addition to the regulation
  of translation. Translational control by mTOR is regulated predominantly by signaling
  from mTORC1, and mediated by phosphorylation of 4E-BPs and S6K, which directly influence
  the function of eIF4E and RpS6, respectively. Now, two papers by Hsieh et al. and
  Thoreen et al. demonstrate that mTOR signaling to the ribosome can regulate a specific
  subset of mRNA transcripts, the majority of which contain a 5′ TOP, a 5′ TOP-like
  or a novel PRTE element in their 5′ UTR regions. While Thoreen et al. now establish
  an important mTOR-sensitive regulation of eIF4G1 downstream of 4E-BPs, Hsieh et
  al. focus on a subset of mRNA transcripts (YB-1, CD44, MTA1 and vimentin) strongly
  linked to regulation of metastasis, and propose that they play a role in the progression
  of Pten-loss-driven prostate cancer through hyperactivation of the mTOR signaling
  pathway. While, the ATP site inhibitor INK128 was shown to inhibit tumor progression
  in mice, it should be noted that such inhibitors also block all activities of mTORC1
  and 2, and while they can successfully block the translational up-regulation of
  the 4-gene metastasis signature described by Hsieh et al., they also block other
  metastatic pathways regulated by independently controlled mTOR pathways.
