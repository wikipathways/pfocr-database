caption: Possible fates of disulfide reduced SOD1 in the G93A/CCS mouse. Shown are
  possible models for how reduction of the SOD1 disulfide may be on the pathway to
  disease in the G93A/CCS mouse. While over-expressed CCS interacts productively with
  WT SOD1 to oxidize the disulfide, a fraction of misfolded G93A SOD1 is a poor substrate
  for over-expressed CCS and remains in the disulfide-reduced state, resulting in
  SOD1 recruitment to either the mitochondria or the secretory pathway.
