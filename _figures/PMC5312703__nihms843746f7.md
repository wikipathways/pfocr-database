caption: CD40-CD40L interaction recruits TRAFs (TRAF2, 3, 5 and 6) which bind to the
  CD40 cytoplasmic domain and mediates the activation of multiple signaling pathways
  including canonical and non-canonical NFκB pathways, PI3K pathway, as well as phosphorylation
  of MAP kinases including P38, ERK and JNK. For canonical NFκB activation, TRAF2
  or TRAF6 mediates signaling activation and phosphorylates the subunits (IKKα, IKKβ
  and IKKγ) in the IKK complex, which further induces the phosphorylation of IκB.
  The phosphorylation of IκB induces its degradation and this process leads to phosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation of NFκB, where it acts as a transcription activator. In
  normal B cells (left), the CD40 signaling plays an essential role in B cell proliferation,
  survival and cytokine production. In B cells of RRMS patients (right), we found
  enhanced CD40-mediated canonical NFκB signaling while the MAPK pathway remains unaffected.
  A prediction of the model is that dysregulation of CD40-mediated NFκB signaling
  leads to the hyper-proliferation of MS B cells upon CD40 engagement as we described
  previously. In addition, our data points to the potential of therapeutic interventions
  including Avonex/Cellcept combination therapy and GA therapy to correct this signaling
  dysregulation.
