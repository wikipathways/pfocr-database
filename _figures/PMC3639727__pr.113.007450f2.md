caption: Drug-specific T cell responses. HLA-restriction and mechanisms of antigen
  presentation. AMajor pathway of antigen presentation listed. Hapten-specific T cells
  are often stimulated with drug-derived antigens binding directly to MHC. For carbamazepine
  and abacavir, drug-protein antigens have not been characterized. Thus, the hapten
  hypothesis has not been tested.
