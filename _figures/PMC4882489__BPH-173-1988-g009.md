caption: Schematic diagram of the signalling pathway activated by B1 receptor agonists
  leading to the formation of ONOO¯ upon post‐translational activation of iNOS and
  NADPH oxidase. Activation of the B1 receptor through Gαi and βγ‐dependent activation
  of Src, Ras, Raf and MEK leads to ERK‐dependent phosphorylation of iNOS on Ser745
  that causes high NO output (Brovkovych et al., ). Simultaneously, B1 receptor agonists
  can activate NADPH oxidase to generate O2●¯ (Dias et al., ) that can rapidly react
  with NO to form ONOO¯. The latter exerts a positive feedback loop to enhance the
  expression of B1 receptors. Blockade of iNOS with 1400W prevents this vicious cycle
  and the pro‐inflammatory effects of B1 receptors.
