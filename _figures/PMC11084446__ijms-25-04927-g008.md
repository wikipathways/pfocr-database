caption: A brief diagram of the proposed therapeutic effect of the LiESWT in improving
  detrusor hyperactivity via TRPV channels and the cellular signaling pathway involved
  in regulating intracellular Ca2+ oscillation in a rat model of OHD-induced DHIC.
  The OVX-treated rat model was used to mimic the physiological conditions of OHD
  or the postmenopausal state to induce detrusor hyperactivity symptoms. LiESWT (0.12
  mJ/mm2, 300 impulses, 3 Hz) was applied to the lower abdomen of the OHD-induced
  DHIC rats. Accordingly, the OVX rats had exacerbated pathological damage in the
  bladder and worse bladder contractile responses, while the LiESWT ameliorated OVX-induced
  detrusor hyperactivity and improved the bladder contractile function. Additionally,
  the neurogenesis effect of the LiESWT increased the levels of neurogenesis (NF,
  NeuN, and GFAP), muscarinic receptors (M2 and M3), purinergic receptor (P2X7), TRPV
  channels (TRPV1 and TRPV4), ER stress proteins (CHOP, GRP78, and caspase 12), ER-related
  Ca2+ channels/receptors (RyR, IP3R, and SERCA), and Ano1 that were involved in regulating
  intracellular Ca2+ oscillation. Meanwhile, the LiESWT treatment significantly enhanced
  the signaling-pathway-related proteins, including Gq/11, Gq/12, Gq/13, RhoA, and
  RhoK, in the bladder involved in the activation of ER-related Ca2+ channels/receptors.
  Therefore, the OVX rats had worse bladder contractile responses that caused bladder
  contractile deficiency in a rat model of OHD-induced DHIC, while the LiESWT reduced
  the detrusor hyperactivity and ameliorated the bladder contractile function. The
  above findings imply that the OHD status after 12 months of OVX resulted in neuronal
  degeneration and decreased activation of the TRPV1 and TRPV4 channels in a rat model
  of OHD-induced DHIC. Ach, acetylcholine; DHIC, detrusor hyperactivity with impaired
