caption: Schematic drawing showing the effects of extracellular citrate on cancer
  cell metabolism (blue arrows). Extracellular citrate is taken up by the cells through
  the plasma membrane citrate transporter (pmCiC). Its uptake reduces the need of
  mitochondrial-derived citrate (transported from mitochondria through mCiC) and is
  mainly used in cytoplasm to support fatty acid and amino acid synthesis. When the
  pmCiC is blocked with gluconate (brown arrows), extracellular citrate cannot get
  through the plasma membrane of cancer cells resulting in increased use of glycolysis
  to support mitochondrial citrate synthesis. CPTI and II (Carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  I and II) depict AcetylCoA transport mechanism. The thickness of lines reflects
  the intensity of pathway use.
