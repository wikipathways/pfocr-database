caption: 'Hypothetical mechanism of gallic acid (GA) inhibition of aflatoxin biosynthesis
  in A. flavus. GA inhibits (i) the expression of creA, which leads to the downregulation
  of the aflatoxin (AF) cluster genes, simultaneously GA (ii) reduces the peroxisomal
  fatty acids β-oxidation level by diminishing the expression of farB, resulting in
  decreasing the aflatoxin precursor acyl-CoA pools, and (iii) increasing the NADPH
  level via the pentose phosphate pathway, which favors lipid synthesis over aflatoxin
  biosynthesis in A. flavus. PM: Plasma membrane. The orange downward arrows indicate
  the expression of the genes that were significantly downregulated by GA treatment,
  the yellow upward arrows indicate the higher activity of the pentose phosphate pathway,
  which leads to increasing NADPH pools. Dotted lines indicate possible connecting
  pathways and solid lines indicate known pathways.'
