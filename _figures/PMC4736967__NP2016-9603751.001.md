caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling in ASDs. Wnt binding to FZD-LRP5/6 complex receptor
  at the membrane recruits the destruction complex and inhibits GSK3β activity thus
  stabilizing β-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway facilitates synaptic plasticity through the activation of voltage gated
  ion channels that allows activation of CAMK and CREB mediated transcription. Mutations
  in TSC associated with ASD prevent β-catenin degradation which results in a gain
  of function of the Wnt pathway. In the presynaptic terminal cadherin mediated cell
  adhesion between synapses is weakened by phosphorylation of β-catenin and synaptic
  vesicle clustering is enhanced through DVL1. Clustering is also dependent on NLGN/NRXN
  cell adhesion complexes. Both lithium (LiCl) and VPA activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  through inhibition of GSK3β activity. Conversely, in the absence of a Wnt ligand,
  activated GSK3β targets β-catenin for proteosome-mediated degradation. Mutations
  associated with DISC1 fail to inhibit GSK3β and thus activate Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
  In the presynaptic side Wnt signaling buffering of synaptic vesicles is inhibited
  and adherens junctions mediated by cadherins are strengthened.
