caption: Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and protein O-GlcNAcylation. Cancer cells
  compensate for energy metabolism by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. While most
  of the glucose is metabolized through glycolysis, approximately 3–5% of glucose
  enters the HBP. Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase, the rate-limiting
  enzyme of the HBP, converts fructose-6-phosphate into glucosamine-6-phosphate. Subsequently,
  Glucosamine-6-P is acetylated and uridylation of Glucosamine-1-phosphate generates
  UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. UDP-GlcNAc acts a substrate, and O-GlcNAc-transferase and
  O-GlcNAcase add and remove GlcNAc to serine or threonine residues of target proteins,
  respectively. TCA, Tricarboxylic acid cycle; OXPHOS, Oxidative phosphorylation;
