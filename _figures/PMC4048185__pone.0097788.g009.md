caption: Wtih CSE stimulation, β2-AR is activated, which increases cAMP and recruits
  many β-arrestins. Increased cAMP binds and activates PKA but does not stimulate
  MUC5AC transcription and production. β-arrestin2 phosphorylates ERK1/2 and p38MAPK,
  the key players, which activate transcription factors to stimulate MUC5AC transcription
  and production. β-AR antagonists, kinase inhibitors and molecular biological methods
  of interfering with signaling molecules are also shown.
