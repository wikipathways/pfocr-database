caption: Mechanisms implicated in neurological complications after infection. In COVID-19,
  SARS-CoV-2 can access the brain by a trans-synaptic route and also through endothelial
  and lymphocyte invasion, resulting in neuroinflammation. Lower thrombin, higher
  D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, and fibrinogen levels are frequent
  in COVID-19, and activation of the coagulation cascade may contribute to the development
  of stroke and cerebrovascular accidents. Brain-lung crosstalk is an axis involved
  in brain hypoxia due to systemic oxygenation reduction and, subsequently, secondary
  brain oxygenation damage. In sepsis-associated encephalopathy, the cytokine storm
  leads to endothelial activation and increased eNOS activity, which results in nitric
  oxide (NO) production, leading to hypotension and ischemic lesions. Cytokines trigger
  glial reactivity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial dysfunction,
  and neurotransmitter imbalances, with consequent glutamate excitotoxicity. In malaria
  infection, there is an exacerbated inflammatory response to the parasite and activation
  of multiple cell death pathways leading to microcirculatory damage. Endothelial
  dysfunction, platelet activation, cytoadherence, and a downregulation of normal
  endogenous anticoagulant pathways are hallmarks. Dysregulation of the coagulation
  pathway leads to microvascular lesions; thrombin may be implicated. In the process
  of hemoglobin digestion, the malaria parasite releases heme and aggregates it into
  hemozoin, a highly toxic and proinflammatory signaling molecule. Hemozoin and free
  heme released into the bloodstream lead to exacerbated inflammation, tissue damage,
  apoptosis of microvascular brain endothelial cells through activation of STAT3,
  and loss of BBB integrity through binding to the metalloproteinase MMP3. The proinflammatory
  milieu leads to microglial M1 phenotype activation, release of proinflammatory cytokines,
  astrogliosis, axonal injury, and increase in synapsin I. In influenza infection,
  there is a peripheral inflammatory response and release of several proinflammatory
  mediators, including interferons (IFs), interleukins (ILs), tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF), and chemokines. Both neurotropic and non-neurotropic strains of influenza
  are able to induce neuroinflammation, with microglial activation, decrease in neurotrophin
  levels, and increase in IFN-α and other proinflammatory cytokines
