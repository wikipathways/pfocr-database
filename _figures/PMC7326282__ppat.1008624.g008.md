caption: Expression of HPV oncoproteins in concert with changes to the host cell upregulates
  miR-18a expression, which directly targets the STK4 3’UTR to inhibit STK4 expression.
  Loss of STK4 correlates with inhibition of the Hippo pathway and activation of the
  YAP transcription factor, culminating in increased YAP-dependent transcription.
