caption: The extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis
  pathway is initiated following ligand binding to a trimeric death receptor. In the
  case of Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) binding
  the TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) the adaptor protein, Fas-associated death domain (FADD),
  is recruited to the death receptor via homotypic death domain interactions. FADD
  subsequently recruits procaspase-8 through interactions of their respective death
  effector domains, forming the death inducing signaling complex (DISC). Procaspase-8
  dimerizes and is activated to release the active caspase-8 homodimer. FADD-like
  IL1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (FLIP) can also be recruited to the DISC
  where it can modulate the activation of caspase-8. In Type I cells, caspase-8 directly
  activates effector procaspase-3 and -7. In type II cells, apoptosis depends on caspase-8-mediated
  cleavage of BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID). Activated tBID translocates
  to the mitochondria to induce BCL-2 associated X protein (BAX)/ BCL-2 antagonist
  killer 1 (BAK) mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Subsequent
  second mitochondrial activator of caspase (SMAC) release neutralizes X-linked inhibitor
  of apoptosis (XIAP) and permits the final auto-catalytic step in the activation
  of caspases-3/7. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 25 May 2021).
