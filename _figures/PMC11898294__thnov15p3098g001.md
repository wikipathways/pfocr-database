caption: Mechanisms of T-cell activation, immune suppression, and therapeutic strategies
  in the TME. (A) Hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow differentiate into T cells
  in the thymus, with mature CD8+ T cells migrating to the immunosuppressive TME.
  (B) In colorectal cancer liver metastases, Tregs and HMOX1+ myeloid cells secrete
  IL-10, promoting PD-L1 expression on monocytes and T-cell exhaustion, while glucose
  availability affects tumor growth. (C) T-cell activation occurs when antigen-presenting
  cells present tumor-associated antigens via MHC-I with co-stimulatory signals, leading
  to effector T-cell differentiation and cancer cell death through perforin/granzyme
  B release or Fas/FasL pathways. (D) Therapeutic strategies include checkpoint inhibitors
  to enhance CD8+ T-cell activation and prevent exhaustion, and cancer vaccines with
  protein subunits and modified tumor cells to modulate the TME and improve recognition
  of homocitrullinated peptides by effector T cells, collectively enhancing anti-tumor
  immune responses
