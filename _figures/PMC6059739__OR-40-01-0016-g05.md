caption: YAP/TAZ as therapeutic targets in multiple mechanisms. (A) Tumor cell metabolism
  is inhibited by various molecules, including 2-DG, AICAR, metformin and AMOTL1.
  (B) Various molecules and medicines, including AMOTL2, CDK inhibitors, PTPN14, curcumin,
  dasatinib, statins, pazopanib and verteporfin, serve as inhibitors of YAP/TAZ in
  the Hippo pathway and are conducive to cancer treatment. However, tankyrase inhibitors
  and dasatinib can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in the Wnt pathway. There
  are also inhibitors that can reduce tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting GPCRs.
  (C) Various molecules and technologies, including cytochalasin D, vlebbistatin,
  okadiac acid, TESK1, miRNA-141 and shRNAs, can reduce treatment resistance and promote
  tumor cell sensitivity to oncotherapy. (D) miRNA-338-3p and miR-9-3p can target
  TAZ in HCC treatment. Other miRNAs, including miR-375, miR-129-5p, miR-506 and miR-361,
  can target YAP and serve as tumor suppressors. 2-DG, 2-deoxy-D-glucose; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
