caption: 'Pathway of acetate metabolism in G. sulfurreducens during growth on NBAF
  medium with fumarate as the electron acceptor and acetate as the electron donor.
  Acetate is transported into the cells (green arrow) via acetate permease (magenta
  protein channel). Imported acetate can be activated via one of the following two
  pathways: (i) the acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1) followed by the activity of phosphotransacetylase
  enzyme (EC 2.3.1.8) (purple arrows) producing acetyl-CoA which is directed toward
  pyruvate synthesis and subsequently into biomass and amino acid synthesis pathways,
  or (ii) acetate being oxidized through conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate via
  the activity of succinyl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase enzyme (EC 2.8.3.18), resulting
  in the production of acetyl-CoA (yellow arrows) which is directed toward the TCA
  cycle. The fumarate provided in the medium is taken up (green arrow) via the fumarate
  transporter proteins (C4-dicarboxylic acid transporter). Imported fumarate can either
  be (i) directed toward the TCA cycle (blue arrow), which operates as an open loop
  and ends with the formation of succinate and its excretion into the medium (red
  arrow), or (ii) reduced to succinate via the activity of inner membrane-bound FrdCAB
  enzyme (fumarate reductase activity) followed by its excretion into the medium (red
  arrow) (, , , ).'
