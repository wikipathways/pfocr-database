caption: Possible antioxidant response of flavonoids compounds combined with Nrf2
  pathway. Extracellular reduction of oxidative stress scavenging by flavonoids compound
  reducing an oxidative damage by H2O2, decreasing the concentration potentially dangerous
  to membrane and intracellular milieu. The reduction of intracellular oxidative stress
  can be mediated by Keap1/Nrf2 pathway by the activation of antioxidant response
  element (ARE) through the Nrf2 phosphorylated and translocated to nucleus; this
  activates the transcription factor to increase concentration of antioxidant complex,
  reducing ROS by enzymatic system. In this sense, the flavonoids can act as scavenger
  of ROS, enhancing the intracellular ROS balance and reducing the lipid peroxidation
  and the propagative effect.
