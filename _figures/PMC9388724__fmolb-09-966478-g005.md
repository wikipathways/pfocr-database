caption: p53 modulates ferroptosis in ICH. p53 inhibits SLC7A11 resulting in dysfunction
  of the cystine/glutamate antiporter (System Xc−) after ICH, leading to decreased
  synthesis of glutathione (GSH) and activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4).
  p53 could increase Caspase-3 as well as Bax expressions, and decrease Bcl-2 expression
  conversely. Therefore, P53 plays key roles in SBI caused by ICH. IRN suppressed
  the p53 expression to anti-ferroptosis via miR-122–5p/p53/SLC7A11 pathway. Ubiquitin-specific
  protease 11(USP11) stabilized p53 by deubiquitination and p53 targeted Krüppel like
  factor 2 (KLF2) promoter to repress KLF2 transcription, thereby activating the nuclear
  factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway to anti-ferroptosis. Ferric ammonium citrate (FAC)
  could be a source of iron to induce iron overload, thus leading to ferroptosis.
