caption: Central carbon metabolism and one-carbon metabolism play critical roles in
  melanoma biology. Glycolysis produces ATP and intermediates that fuel the pentose-phosphate
  pathway (PPP) and serine-glycine/one-carbon metabolism pathways, which produce NADPH
  vital for maintaining the redox balance of the cell and for anabolic reactions.
  The TCA cycle uses acetyl-CoA derived from pyruvate or β-oxidation of fatty acids
  to produce NADH, which powers the ATP-generating electron-transport chain (ETC).
  The TCA cycle can also generate NADPH via isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2). Like
  other tumor cells, the TCA cycle of melanoma cells can alternatively oxidize glutamine,
  which enters the TCA cycle as α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). In addition to its bioenergetic
  function, the TCA cycle produces critical biosynthetic precursors. Oxaloacetate
  (OAA) fuels reactions that generate NADPH via malic enzyme (ME) and also promotes
  nucleotide synthesis by supplying the cell with aspartate. Citrate provides the
  cell with acetyl-CoA necessary for fatty acid synthesis and acetylation reactions.
  Citrate also promotes NADPH production via isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). Signaling
  pathways play a critical role in determining which metabolic pathways are favored
  by melanoma cells. The MAPK and PI3K pathways promote glycolysis and the decoupling
  of glycolysis from the TCA cycle via HIF1α and MYC. However, through mechanisms
  currently unknown, a subset of melanomas highly expresses PGC1α, which promotes
  OXPHOS and makes the cells highly dependent on the oxidation of glutamine. GLUT1,
