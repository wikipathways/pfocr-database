caption: 'Autophagy-mediated ferroptosis. A Activated AMPK phosphorylates the autophagy
  machinery component Beclin1, and Beclin1 directly binds to SLC7A11, which leads
  to the inhibition of Xc− system activity and mediates ferroptosis. B Autophagy mediates
  ferroptosis via the selective degradation of essential proteins. (1) Ferritinophagy
  is a term that describes the selective degradation of ferritin, and NCOA4 is considered
  the cargo receptor. Various autophagy-related proteins are involved in the activation
  of ferritinophagy. (2) Selective degradation of GPX4 via macroautophagy: TAX1BP1
  serves as the cargo receptor, and the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway regulates this
  process. Moreover, CMA can mediate the selective degradation of GPX4. CKB, WBP2
  and HSPA5 inhibit the recognition of GPX4 by HSC70, which prevents ferroptosis;
  instead, Lgmn strengthens the interaction between HSC70 and GPX and between LAMP2A
  and GPX, hence promoting ferroptosis. (3) Clockphagy is a term that describes the
  selective degradation of ARNTL, and p62 is the cargo receptor. Clockphagy reduces
  HIF1A (a ferroptosis suppressor), leading to ferroptosis. (4) Selective degradation
  of other antiferroptotic proteins such as SLC40A1 (p62 serves as the cargo receptor),
  CDH2 (HPCAL1 serves as the cargo receptor), and DHFR (the relevant cargo receptor
  has not yet been identified). C Autophagy promotes ferroptosis by selectively targeting
  mitochondria (mitophagy) or lipid droplet degradation (lipophagy), and FUNDC or
  RAB7A is considered to be the cargo receptor, respectively. The abovementioned mechanisms
  are shared in different cell or animal models. This figure created in BioRender.
