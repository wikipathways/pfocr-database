caption: 'Schematic representation of the in vivo metabolic changes in shrimp hemocytes
  at the viral genome replication stage (12 h) (A) and the late stage (24 h) (B) of
  the first WSSV replication cycle. Measured concentrations or activities are shown
  in rounded boxes: red indicates an increase and green indicates a decrease relative
  to the respective PBS control. Yellow boxes showed no change. VDAC expression level
  data are from Wang et al., (), Wang et al., (), and our unpublished data. Hexokinase
  mRNA expression levels at 24 hpi are from unpublished microarray data. No HK data
  are presently available for 12 hpi. Increases in pathway use are indicated by the
  thicker solid arrows. Ψm represents membrane potential (no data are available for
  Ψm at 12 hpi). The shaded box at the top of the 12-h schematic encompasses concentration
  changes that are consistent with the Warburg effect. The shaded box at the bottom
  left of the 24-h schematic shows changes associated with MMP.'
