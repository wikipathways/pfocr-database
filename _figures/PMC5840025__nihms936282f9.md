caption: Pathways leading to IL-24 induction shown with red arrows. Pathways leading
  to IL-10 induction shown with green arrows. (A) In macrophages, work from other
  groups has shown that optimal LPS-induced IL-10 expression requires signaling through
  both the type I IFN and IL-27 receptors (, ). We show that optimal LPS induction
  of IL-24 in macrophages is entirely independent of type I IFN receptor signaling
  but requires co-stimulation through the IL-4/STAT6 pathway. LPS+IL-4 stimulation
  induces STAT6 recruitment to multiple regions within Il24 and STAT6-dependent chromatin
  remodeling of the Il24 locus. Enhanced stability of IL-24 mRNA in BMM occurs independently
  of the IL-4/STAT6 pathway (not shown). Of note, we also determined that type I IFN
  receptor-mediated regulation of IL-10 in BMM is independent of STAT4. (B) In NK
  cells however, we identified a reversal of type I IFN’s broad role in regulating
  IL-10 and IL-24. Though IL-10 induction is completely independent of the type I
  IFN receptor, cytokine-induced IL-24 expression broadly requires both the type I
  IFN receptor and STAT4. The dependence on type I IFNs and STAT4 is evident even
  in the absence of IL-12 co-stimulation suggesting that type I IFN receptor signals
  through STAT4 to regulate IL-24 expression in NK cells. The alternate type I IFN/STAT4
  pathway has been shown previously to regulate key functions in NK cell biology (,
  , ). Of note, we cannot rule out a role for IL-2-induced STAT5 or type I IFN-induced
  STAT1 (semitransparent) in NK-specific IL-24 or IL-10 regulation. Also, STAT4 but
  not type I IFN receptor, is required for the synergistic induction of IL-10 by IL-2+IL-12
  ().
