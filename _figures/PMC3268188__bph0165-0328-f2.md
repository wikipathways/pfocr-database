caption: Tumour suppressor p53 regulation and signalling. Activation of the transcription
  factor p53 is predominantly mediated by stabilization, mostly due to phosphorylation
  by upstream kinases such as ATM/ATR or Chk1/2. As a tetramer the stabilized p53
  binds to DNA consensus sequences and induces transcription of huge number of different
  target genes involved apoptosis, senescence or DNA repair. One of the target genes
  is the ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 that regulates the proteolytic degradation of p53
  in a negative feedback loop. This negative regulation is facilitated by MDMX and
  attenuated by p14Arf that interferes with MDM2-mediated down-regulation of p53.
