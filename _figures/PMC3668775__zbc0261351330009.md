caption: Proposed model for the attenuated response to type I IFNs in human pluripotent
  cells. Although some signaling molecules in the type I IFN response pathway are
  expressed at lower levels in human pluripotent cells, these cells also exhibit an
  elevated expression of SOCS1, a potent negative regular of JAK/STAT signaling, compared
  with differentiated human cells. Together, these may contribute to the diminished
  STAT1 phosphorylation and a resulting attenuated response to type I IFNs in pluripotent
  human cells.
