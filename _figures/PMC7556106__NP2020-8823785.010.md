caption: 'A model for the mechanism of Hsp70-induced Bmi1 upregulation in the protection
  of sound conditioning against acute acoustic trauma by directly targeting SOD1 and
  SOD2 regulated by the FoxO1 signaling pathway. Hsp70/Bmi1-FoxO1-SOD1/SOD2 signaling
  pathway decreases sensitivity in noise-induced trauma following sound conditioning
  by controlling mitochondrial function and ROS level in rat''s SGN. Meanwhile, based
  on previous studies, other pathway is also involved in Bmi1 deficiency-induced ROS
  accumulation, such as the following: Bmi1 deficiency directly leads to p53-mediated
  repression of antioxidant genes, resulting in increased ROS.'
