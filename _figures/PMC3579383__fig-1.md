caption: Myelin-derived neurite growth inhibitors, their receptors, and intracellular
  signaling pathway. Oligodendrocyte-expressed Nogo, myelin-associated glycoprotein
  (MAG), and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) all bind to glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked
  protein NgR1, which recruits co-receptor p75NTR and leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin
  domain-containing Nogo receptor-interacting protein (LINGO)-1 to form a receptor
  complex to transduce the inhibitory signals in neurons.
