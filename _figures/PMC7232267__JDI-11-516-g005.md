caption: 'Micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) cross‐talk between miR 29 and miR let‐7 in
  the anti‐endothelial mesenchymal transition action of N‐acetyl‐seryl‐aspartyl‐lysyl‐proline
  (AcSDKP). AcSDKP increases the levels of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)
  and, subsequently, miR let‐7s are induced. MiR let‐7 suppressed transforming growth
  factor β receptor (TGFβR1) and downstream Smad3 signaling, the major miR 29 inhibitory
  pathway. Therefore, the cells treated with AcSDKP also show induction of miR 29.
  miR 29 suppressed profibrotic and inflammatory cytokines and proteins, such as interferon‐γ,
  dipeptidyl peptidase‐4(DPP‐4) and so on. Interferon‐γ is known to suppress FGFR1.
  Interestingly, DPP‐4 inhibitor‐mediated suppression of DPP‐4 subsequently induced
  miR 29, and such DPP‐4 inhibitor‐activated miR 29 induced FGFR1‐dependent miR let‐7,
  as vice versa.[Correction added on 1 April 2020, after first online publication:
  The figure has been amended to match the original.]'
