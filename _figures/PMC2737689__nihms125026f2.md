caption: Multiple isoforms catalyze each step in the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway
  of TAG synthesis. GPAT1 and GPAT2 on the outer mitochondrial membrane compete with
  carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 for acyl-CoAs that may be used for glycerolipid
  biosynthesis or for β-oxidation. Like GPAT1 and 2, GPAT3 and GPAT4 catalyze the
  esterification of glycerol-3-phosphate to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). As many
  as 5 possible 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (AGPAT; also known
  as LPAAT) esterify LPA to form phosphatidic acid (PA). Three isoforms of phosphatidic
  acid phosphohydrolase (PAPase, which is also known as lipin), hydrolyze the phosphate
  to form diacylglycerol (DAG). Two major isoforms of diacylglycerol acyltransferase
  (DGAT) catalyze the third esterification to form triacylglycerol (TAG). Both PA
  and DAG are also precursors for the glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC),
  phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI),
  phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cardiolipin (CL). The DAG produced by this pathway
  can activate protein kinase C.
