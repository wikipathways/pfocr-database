caption: (A) Illustration of the Rho signaling pathway that activates myosin assembly
  and active contraction in the cell cortex. At mechanical equilibrium, the membrane
  tension must balance both osmotic pressure in the cell and active contraction in
  the cortex (Eq. 1). (B) In our model, we consider membrane-tension changes that
  activate MS channels, which then activate Rho and myosin contraction. The contractile
  force negatively feeds back to membrane tension. The probability of Rho activation,
  , starts to increase at a critical tension, , and saturates at . To see this figure
