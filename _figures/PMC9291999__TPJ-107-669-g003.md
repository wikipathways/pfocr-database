  (a) Seed coat. (b) Embryo. (c) Endosperm. (d) Cavity fluid. Metabolites are written
  in black letters; enzymes are written in red letters. Levels of metabolites and
  proteins were averaged over three biological replicates after normalization. Four
  consecutive squares from left to right indicates four developmental stages (12,
  15, 20, and 26 days after anthesis). Values of metabolite levels from minimal to
  maximal are colored from blue to red and protein concentrations are colored from
  white to green. Metabolites identified by GC‐MS are written in black; metabolites
  not identified by GC‐MS are written in blue. ALAT, alanine aminotransferase; AK‐HSDH,
  bifunctional aspartokinase/homoserine dehydrogenase I; AsnS, asparagine synthetase;
  AspAT, aspartate aminotransferase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; GOGAT, glutamate
  synthase; GS, glutamine synthetase; HSK, homoserine kinase; THRS, threonine synthase.
