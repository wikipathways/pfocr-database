caption: Overview of the affected pathways in the THP-1 cells after treatment with

  Methotrexate enters the cell mainly via reduced folate receptor (RCF). Folylpolyglutamyl
  synthetase (FPGS) catalyses the polyglutamation of MTX to produce MTX polyglutamates
  (MTX-PGs). MTX-PGs are better retained intracellularly than MTX because they are
  not susceptible to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) that is responsible for MTX efflux.
  MTX-PGs have higher affinity than MTX to thymidylate synthetase (TS) and phosphoribosylglycinamide
  formyltransferase (GART). Deoxyuridine-5-monophosphate (dUMP), deoxythymidine monophosphate
  (dTMP), 5′-phosphoribosyl-glycinamide (GAR), 5′-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide
  (FGAR) and nitric oxide (NO). Pathway analysis was performed using Metaboanalyst
  3.0 software following LC-MS assays of cell (THP-1 and A549) extracts following
  incubation with MTX and MTX-loaded NPs for 24 h.
