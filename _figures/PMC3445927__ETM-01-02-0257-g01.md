caption: PPARγ ligands can induce (A) or suppress (B) expression of cox-2. (A) The
  PPARγ agonists can induce expression of cox-2 in either a PPARγ-dependent or -independent
  manner. PPARγ-dependent activation is initiated by interaction of the PPARγ-specific
  ligand with nuclear receptor that forms a heterodimer with ligand-activated retinoic
  X receptor (RXR). The PPARγ/RXR heterodimer then binds the peroxisome proliferator
  responsive element (PPRE) in the promoter region of the cox-2 gene and activates
  its transcription. PPARγ-independent activation can be also induced by PPARγ agonists
  by stimulation of the MAPK pathway that results in activation of NF-κB and AP-1.
  These transcription factors also regulate transcription of cox-2. (B) PPARγ agonists
  can also suppress cytokine-induced expression of cox-2 by both a PPARγ-dependent
  and -independent manner. The PPARγ/RXR heterodimer up-regulates transcription of
  IκB that prevents NF-κB from activating transcription of cox-2. PPARγ agonists can
  also inhibit the IκB kinase (IKK), thus preventing IκB phosphorylation (P), translocation
  of NF-κB to the nucleus and transcription of its target genes.
