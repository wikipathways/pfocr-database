caption: Proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases are involved in multiple
  steps of the miRNA biogenesis pathway. TDP-43 and FUS (implicated in ALS and FTLD)
  interact with Drosha (directly and indirectly respectively) to promote the processing
  of pri-miRNAs into pre-miRNA. After export, TDP-43 also interacts with dicer to
  process pre-miRNA into mature miRNA. When miRNA is loaded onto the RISC to be targeted
  for silencing, it interacts with Ago1. In Drosophila, it was shown that the protein
  Atx2 (the ortholog of ATXN2, a protein implicated in ALS and SCA2) interacts with
  Ago1 to promote proper targeting of miRNAs to their mRNA.
