caption: 'Schematic diagram representing cinnamon-mediated protection of dopaminergic
  neurons.Cinnamon is metabolized into sodium benzoate (NaB) in the liver. Once NaB
  enters into the brain, it increases the production of neurotrophic factors via activation
  of protein kinase A (PKA) – cAMP response element binding (CREB) pathway. NaB also
  inhibits the activation of p21ras, a small G protein, and thereby attenuates the
  activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the expression of NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory
  molecules leading to anti-inflammation. Following the suppression of NF-κB activation,
  the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) also goes down and the
  production of nitric oxide is reduced, which ultimately restores/upregulates the
  level of neuroprotective proteins like DJ-1 and Parkin. Together, cinnamon-mediated
  neurotrophism, anti-inflammation and neuroprotection protect dopaminergic neurons.
  NO: Nitric oxide.'
