caption: Transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappaB (NFκB), ΔFosB, cyclic
  AMP response element binding protein (CREB), and myocyte enhancing factor-2 (MEF2),
  play a role in regulating dendritic spines, and can be activated by a variety of
  signaling pathways. In addition to dopamine and opioid neurotransmitters, a key
  upstream signal may be brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or other neurotrophins,
  which via receptor tyrosine kinases activate the Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)-thymoma
  viral proto-oncogene (Akt), Ras-extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), and NFκB pathways,
  and ultimately regulate transcriptional activity and possibly control actin cytoskeletal
  dynamics through regulation of the Rho family of small GTPases (including Rac1 and
  p21-activated kinase (PAK1)). Activation of NFκB may occur additionally through
  a cytokine receptor mechanism to control spine plasticity, however, this remains
  speculative. Structural plasticity induced by psychostimulants can therefore result
  from manipulation of several signaling pathways that impinge upon actin assembly
  processes, with some of the changes mediated via altered gene expression. We hypothesize
  that the net effect of cocaine-induced activation of these fundamental signaling
  pathways are sensitized behavioral responses, although each pathway in isolation
  may produce distinct effects on addiction-like behavior and synaptic plasticity.
