caption: 'The central carbon metabolism (CCM). The CCM combines enzymatic reactions
  that convert carbon sources into biomass precursors. This figure shows the five
  main pathways forming the CCM: glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA), lipogenesis, and beta-oxidation. Two opposite metabolic demands
  are at the core of the CCM: anabolic reactions, which consist in biomass synthesis,
  and catabolic reactions, leading to the breakdown of macromolecules for energetic
  use. These two aspects of cell metabolism are managed by biochemical oscillators,
  including redox couples, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH) and
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+/NADPH), and the universal energy
  carrier, adenine triphosphate (ATP/ADP). Transitions in CCM are reported to depend
  on these bio-oscillators. The NAD+/NADH ratio measures the glycolytic flux (glycolysis,
  PPP, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). A high NADP+/NADPH ratio rewires glucose
  oxidation to the pentose phosphate pathway, whereas a low NADP+/NADPH ratio triggers
  lipogenesis. The ATP/(ADP + Pi) ratio senses the metabolic state of the cell and
  may lead to metabolic switches in the CCM.'
