caption: Fatty acids are represented by the n − x system of nomenclature. Desaturation
  and elongation steps are indicated by white arrows with the position of the double
  bond to be introduced and black arrows with carbon chain length, respectively. The
  two alternative pathways used to synthesise DHA from 22:5n − 3 are coloured with
  orange and blue for the Sprecher pathway and Δ4 pathway, respectively.
