caption: Schematic graph shows hypothetical mechanisms for cAMP and cGMP in regulation
  of anodal migration of cell fragments. Two biased signals determine the migration
  direction in an EF. Myosin-dependent pathway dominates in cell fragments and dictates
  the migration direction to the anode. cAMP and cGMP could regulate the directional
  signaling balance which controls galvanotaxis of cell fragments by inhibiting anodal
  signal and activating cathodal signal simultaneously.
