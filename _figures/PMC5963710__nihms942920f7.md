caption: Genes that are differentially expressed and included in cluster 1, which
  are up-regulated from 60DG to adult, are denoted by red boxes; genes that are differentially
  expressed and included in cluster 2, which are down-regulated from 60DG to adult,
  are denoted by green boxes; genes that are differentially expressed and gene splice
  variants or gene family members are found in cluster 1 and cluster 2 are denoted
  by blue boxes; genes that are not differentially expressed are denoted by gray boxes
  with black lines; and genes that were not detected on the array are denoted by black
  boxes with white font. This pathway was modified from the original KEGG pathway
  by adding color annotation. For 60d, n=3, 1 male, 2 undetermined; for 90d – Adult,
  n=3 males per group.
