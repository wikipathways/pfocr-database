caption: 'Viral infection introduces foreign RNA molecules into cells (top left),
  where they are detected by various sensors. A sensor called RIG-I binds to RNA molecules
  that contain an exposed 5′-triphosphate and terminal dsRNA structure, while MDA5
  binds to long dsRNA molecules (). The complexes formed by the RNA molecules and
  the sensors then activate MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling) proteins that
  are found on the surface of mitochondria. This occurs in the presence of polyubiquitin,
  which serves to bridge and stabilise the complexes (). Binding between the complexes
  and the MAVS proteins occurs at regions on each named CARDs (caspase activation
  and recruitment domains). In the figure, the RIG-I and MDA5 CARDs are shown as stars,
  and the MAVS CARDs by the red, blue and green circles. This binding organises the
  MAVS proteins into filaments to form a signalling platform that activates transcription
  factors (IRF3 and IRF7), which go on to stimulate the transcription of antiviral
  type I interferon (IFN-I) genes. Xu et al. report that each MAVS filament contains
  three intertwined helical strands (shown in red, blue and green). The structure
  is maintained by interactions between the MAVS CARDs: each CARD in a filament interacts
  with two other CARDs in the same strand and two CARDs in neighbouring strands. Interactions
  between strands are hydrophobic (cyan dashed lines), and interactions within a strand
  are electrostatic (yellow dashed lines).'
