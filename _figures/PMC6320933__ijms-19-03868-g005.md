caption: Hypothetical model of the action of ABA, AtSAP5 and AtMBP-1 (refer to Miyoung
  et al., 2013 []). MBP-1 suppresses STZ/ZAT10 gene expression which can respond to
  ABA and plant growth. ABA increases the expression of AtSAP5 which can promote the
  degradation of AtMBP-1 by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Sharp arrow
  represents the function of promotion and blunt arrow represents the function of
  inhibition. The solid line indicates that the interaction between the two is clear
  and the dotted line indicates that the interaction between the two is not clear.
