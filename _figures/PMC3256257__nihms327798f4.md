caption: (A) A block diagram for an existing lycopene controller (). The sensor measures
  the output (acetyl phosphate) and converts it into a modular biological signal (transcription
  from the glnAp2 promoter). The controller connects that signal to the actuator,
  expression of the rate limiting pathway enzymes. (B) Molecular implementation of
  the lycopene controller. The precursor (triangle) is converted into acetyl phosphate
  by endogenous enzymes. Overproduction of acetyl phosphate leads to expression of
  Idi and Pps, diverting flux to lycopene. (C) A block diagram of a hypothetical controller
  combining a biofuels-responsive controller () and an integral controller (). (D)
  Molecular implementation of the hypothetical biofuels controller. A butanol-responsive
  transcription factor is used to regulate activator expression. The activator has
  a degradation tag, leading to constant degradation by ClpXP. The activator also
  induces expression of the efflux pump, lowering the intracellular butanol concentration.
