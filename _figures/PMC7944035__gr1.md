caption: Overview of the TLRs multiple signaling pathways. DAMPs activate TLRs then
  a cytoplasmic receptor domain TIR recruits signal transduction adaptor molecules
  to initiate signaling. Signaling pathways are broadly categorized into two distinct
  classes on the basis of adaptor usage, MyD88-dependent pathways and TRIF-dependent
  pathways. Adaptor molecule MyD88 forms a complex with IRAK family. This complex
  then activates TAK1. TAK1 binds to the IκB kinase, which is a central regulator
  of NF-κB activation and allowing it to translocate into the nucleus. Transcription
  factors, including NF-κB, AP-1, MAPKs and IRF3 family members, can be activated
  by the TRIF-dependent pathway to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokinessuch
  as IL-6, INF-1, IL-1β, and TNF-α.Pathways of fibrosisproceed with activation of
  SMAD2 phosphorylation which is triggered by TLRs activated NLRP3 inflammasome formation
  and ASC expression. The inflammasomes also trigger caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis
  and IL-1β secretion. Activated TLR2 on CD133+/CD24+ renal progenitor cells can accelerate
  tubular repair via release of soluble factors inhibin A and decorinand inhibiting
  apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells via the IGF type I receptor/Akt-signaling
  pathway. TLR4 agonists induce the release of IL-22 secretion by macrophages, which
  in turn activates its receptor (exclusively present on tubular epithelia) to accelerate
  re-epithelialization in vivo through activation of the Jak/STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways.
