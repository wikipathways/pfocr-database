caption: SHH signaling pathway. (A) SHH pathway in the absence of SHH ligand. PTC
  inhibits SMO activity, thereby inhibiting its ability to positively influence transcription
  (dashed lines). Nuclear transcription of downstream SHH targets is stopped. (B)
  SHH pathway in the presence of SHH ligand. SHH binds PTC, lifting its inhibition
  on SMO (dashed lines), thereby allowing SMO to positively influence transcription.
  Nuclear transcription of downstream targets is activated.
