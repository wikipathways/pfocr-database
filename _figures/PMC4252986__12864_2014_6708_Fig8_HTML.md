caption: Model integrating RsrA into the global ROS-responsive network in A. nidulans.
  Upon hydrogen peroxide exposure, the bZIP transcription factor NapA gets directly
  oxidized and thereby activates gene expression of enzymes and components (TrxA,
  CatB) involved in balancing the redox status of the cells. RsrA acts as a repressor
  of certain NapA-activated target genes, perhaps in balance with the AnCF complex.
  How RsrA is activated itself remains unclear.
