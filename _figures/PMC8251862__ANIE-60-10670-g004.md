caption: 'The prototypical Agr system of Staphylococcus aureus: A) Representation
  of an S. aureus AIP biosynthetic gene cluster showing genes encoding the integral
  membrane macrocyclase (AgrB), the precursor peptide (AgrD), the cognate two‐component
  transduction system (AgrC‐AgrA), as well as the distal gene encoding the membrane
  protease (SspB). Also shown is an example of a mature staphylococcal thiolactone‐containing
  AIP. B) Overview of the biosynthetic pathway to staphylococcal thiolactone‐containing
  AIPs. The AIP is derived from an internal fragment of the ribosomally synthesized
  precursor peptide AgrD. First, AgrB catalyzes C‐terminal proteolysis of the follower
  peptide (FP) and subsequent macrocyclization, followed by secretion. Then, the N‐terminal
  leader peptide (LP) is removed by SspB, leaving an N‐terminal extension (NTE) of
  varying length. The mature AIP, which varies among strains, consists of a five‐membered
  thiolactone ring with a 2–4 residue NTE. In response to binding of the AIP, the
  sensor kinase AgrC is autophosphorylated and the signal is transduced by the response
  regulator AgrA leading to global alterations in gene expression.'
