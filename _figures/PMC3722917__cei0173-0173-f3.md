caption: '(a) Naive CD8+ T cells differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)
  on exposure to antigens. T helper type 1 (Th1) cells can activate naive CD8+ T cells
  to become CTLs and can maintain and expand the memory CD8+ T cell population during
  resensitization. In the absence of CD8+ T cell in splenocytes, no activation of
  cytotoxic activity occurred. (b) When CD4+ T cells were depleted from splenocytes,
  the activation pathway from CD8+ T cells to CTLs was less activated, resulting in
  inactivation of donor cell-related immunity in the recipients. APC: antigen-presenting
  cell; MΦ: macrophage; Treg: regulatory T cell.'
