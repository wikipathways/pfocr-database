caption: Mitochondria generate ATP, by means of the ETC and the oxidative phosphorylation
  system (OXPHOS). The proteins involved in this process are located in the mitochondrial
  inner membrane (MIM) and collectively referred to as the respiratory chain (RC)
  (). Acetyl CoA generated from glycolysis and from fatty acid beta oxidation (FAO)
  enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). The TCA cycle, glycolysis and FAO all
  generate high energy electrons in the form of NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).
  These electrons are then passed along the ETC in a series of redox reactions. The
  ETC comprises 5 protein complexes and two shuttles (). NADH passes an electron to
  complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) and this in turn passes the electron through a shuttle
  coenzyme Q (Ubiquinone) to complex III (cytochrome b-c1). Another source of high
  energy electrons for complex III stems from FADH2 which is generated in the TCA
  cycle by succinate dehydrogenase which is both a TCA cycle component and a component
  of the ETC complex II. The final common pathway through complex III transfers electrons
  to another electron carrier, cytochrome C, which in turn passes its electrons to
  complex IV (cytochrome oxidase). Finally the energy depleted electron (in the form
  of hydrogen) is accepted by molecular oxygen, completely reducing it to form water.
  This series of redox reactions releases energy which drives the extrusion of protons
  outwards through complexes I, III, and IV to create an electrochemical gradient
  across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gradient in turn drives the phosphorylation
  of ADP to ATP by ATP synthase (complex V), . This reaction is reversible and during
  severe ischaemia large amounts of ATP may be ‘wasted’ in maintaining the electrochemical
  gradient via the dephosphorylation of ATP. However OXPHOS is not fully efficient
  and even under physiological conditions some of the energy is dissipated as heat.
  This is due to proton leak from the inter mitochondrial membrane space into the
  matrix through uncoupling proteins (UCPs), adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT)
  or non-specific membrane proton slippage (). This non-ATPase related loss of trans-membrane
  potential makes ATP production by OXPHOS less efficient (less ATP produced per oxygen
  molecule consumed). ANT catalyses the exchange of ADP and ATP between cytosol and
  mitochondria, but it also contributes to proton leak. UCP 2 and UCP3 are found in
  human cardiac muscle and their expression correlated positively with plasma free
  fatty acid concentrations. Their activities are increased by reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) (). Physiological uncoupling of OXPHOS may decrease excessive ROS production
  and reduce oxidative damage (‘Uncoupling to survive’). Indeed rather than thermogenesis,
  this may be the major physiological role of uncoupling. Approximately 20%-30% of
  resting cellular energy expenditure dissipates as heat due to proton leak. In a
  negative feedback cycle ROS induced uncoupling leads in turn to suppression of ROS
  production by the ETC (). The decreased trans-membrane potential (ΔѰ) regulates
  the ETC redox state, which in turn suppresses superoxide anion production by complexes
  Ⅰ and III. Superoxide production (O2-) is related to electron leak, which is closely
  interlinked with proton leak regulation. Electron leak can occur when electrons
  exit the ETC early before their final reduction to water to form superoxide instead.
  Under experimental conditions a high ΔѰ (or ΔpH) can reverse the electron transport
  at complex Ⅰ, reducing NAD+ to NADH and forming superoxide. An uncoupling induced
  decrease in the proton gradient reduces the reverse electron transport and the superoxide
  production at complex I. Mitochondria are thus both sources (complex Ⅰ and III)
  and targets of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS). Electron slippage
  at complexes I and III lead to incomplete reduction of molecular oxygen to form
  superoxide. At non-pathological levels ROS play important functions in cellular
  signalling. However when oxidative stress is increased the associated mtDNA damage
  may further enhance ROS production, resulting in a vicious cycle.
