caption: Signaling pathway of cell surface TLRs. TLR4 recognizes LPS in complex with
  MD2 to start a signaling cascade by recruiting adaptors MyD88 and TIRAP and forming
  a complex of IRAK4, 1, and 2, and TRAF6. TRAF6 catalyzes formation of K-63 linked
  polyubiquitin chains on TRAF6 itself and generates an unconjugated polyubiquitin
  chain. TRAF6 activates TAK1 complex, which further activates IKK complex and MAP
  kinases. IKK complex phosphorylates IκB, which undergoes proteosomal degradation
  to release NF-κB for further translocation to nucleus and subsequent induction of
  proinflammatory cytokines. MAP kinases phosphorylate Jun kinases (JNK), p38 kinase,
  extracellular signal regulated kinase 1(ERK1), and ERK2. TLR4 also signals through
  TRIF-dependent pathways with the help of adaptor TRAM after translocation to endosome
  and activates IRF3 for type I IFN production. TLR1/2 and TLR6/2 heterodimers recognize
  triacylated and diacylated lipoproteins, respectively, whereas TLR5 recognizes flagellin
  and all of them initiate a MyD88-dependent signaling pathway that culminates in
  the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. TLR signaling is modulated by CD14,
  CD36, Nrdp1, CHIP, MHCII, Regnase-1, A20, SHP-1, TMED7, CD11b, NLRP4, NLRX1, and
  miRNAs (miR-146a, miR-29, miR-148/152).
