caption: Genetic determination of testes in Japanese medaka fish, chicken, and mouse.
  Somatic gene sox9 was involved in the control of testes from fish. AMH signaling
  pathway is a very conservative element of testes, along with other major regulators,
  appeared in other species (adopted from []).
