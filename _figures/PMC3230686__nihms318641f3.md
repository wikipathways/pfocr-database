caption: The molecular mechanisms by which IL-27 promotes Foxp3−IL-10+Tr1 cell differentiation
  and represses TH17 cell development through activation of Stat1 and Stat3 activation
  are shown. IL-27 activates Stat1 through the subunit WSX1 that inhibits RoRγt expression
  through t-bet-dependent as well as t-bet-independent pathways. Alternatively, IL-27
  can promote t-bet expression in a Stat1 independent pathway via GADD45γ. In addition,
  IL-27 activates Stat3 signaling through gp130. Stat3 induction then drives Maf transcription.
  Maf together with Ahr transactivates il21 and il10 promoters. On the other hand,
  IL-27 inhibits Foxp3 transcription in a Stat3/Smad3 dependent manner.
