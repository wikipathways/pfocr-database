caption: Proposed model of the genetic network for floral transition in maize. The
  switch from vegetative (VEG) growth to reproductive (REP) growth is marked by the
  floral transition (yellow arrow). The floral inductive signal initiates in leaves
  (leaf, top) and its production or transmission is regulated by id1. The activity
  of dlf1 in the shoot apex (apex, bottom) is indirectly (multiple arrows) regulated
  downstream of id1 function. Expression of dlf1 activates an early downstream target
  (gene x) that feeds back to up-regulate dlf1. This positive feedback loop results
  in the increase and peak of dlf1 expression to sufficient levels to promote the
  floral transition. Similar to known targets of FD in Arabidopsis (AP1/FUL/CAL),
  a maize MADS-box gene (ZM MADS) is also proposed as a direct target of dlf1. An
  alternate induction pathway is hypothesized (white arrows) to activate expression
  of genes downstream of dlf1 (x and ZM MADS). Induction through the alternate pathway
  would explain the ability of mutant dlf1 or mutant id1 plants to eventually flower.
  Additionally, signaling through the alternate pathway explains the increase and
  peak of dlf1 mRNA coincident with the delayed floral transition in a dlf1 mutant
  background. The relevant Arabidopsis homologs are indicated at the appropriate nodes
  but not boxed.
