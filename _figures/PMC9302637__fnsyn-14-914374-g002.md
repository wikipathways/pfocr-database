caption: SE-induced alterations in the transcription of GABAR subunit genes. Following
  status epilepticus (SE), our group and others have described an increase in the
  transcription of the α4 subunit gene (GABRA4), and a decrease in the transcription
  of GABRA1. Investigations into the mechanisms behind these transcriptomic alterations
  have shown (on right) increased levels of BDNF after SE that lead to PKC/MAPK activation
  and increased levels of the immediate early gene transcription factor Egr3, both
  transcript and protein, as well as increased binding of Egr3 to the GABRA4 core
  promoter region and (on bottom left) BDNF-induced activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway,
  through TrkB receptors (dependent also on p75NTR (remains unknown whether p75NTR
  is at membrane or intracellular), leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and binding of
  pSTAT3 homodimers to the ICER promoter, resulting in increased ICER transcription.
  Binding of the ICER repressor with CREB/pCREB to the GABRA1 promoter results in
  decreased transcription of GABRA1 and α1 subunit levels. Ultimately, these changes
  lead to an increase in the presence of α4 - containing GABAARs and a decrease in
  α1-containing GABAARs at the synapse, which may contribute to epileptogenesis in
  the post-SE setting. Figure generated using BioRender.com.
