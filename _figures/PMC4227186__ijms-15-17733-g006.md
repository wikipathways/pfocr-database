caption: Schematic diagram of the TCDD induced HIF-1α molecular signaling. TCDD induced
  HIF-1α stabilization via the AhR or ROS-dependent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  A significant increase in invasion, MMP9 activity, and VEGF and PlGF gene expression
  was found in the TCDD-treated cells. Furthermore, down regulation of metabolic regulators
  PPARγ and PGC-1α was involved in the TCDD-induced insults. TFAM and UCP2, downstream
  targets of PGC1α, were concurrently suppressed and may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction.
  Taken together, our results indicate that an activated HIF-1α pathway, elicited
  oxidative stress, and induced metabolic stress contribute to TCDD-induced trophoblastic
  toxicity.
