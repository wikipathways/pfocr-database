caption: Cytoplasmic hydrogen peroxide inhibits vulva development by acting directly
  on LET-60ras, via oxidation of C118. The state of oxidation of C118 is affecting
  vulva formation independently from MPK-1 phosphorylation via an as yet uncharacterized
  pathway. The source of hydrogen peroxide is SOD-1 and is either converted from cytoplasmic
  superoxide or superoxide that exits the mitochondria in the absence of the mitochondrial
  superoxide dismutase SOD-2. SOD-2-dependent hydrogen peroxide produced in the mitochondria
  can also participate in the SOD-1-dependent cytoplasmic pool. Cytoplasmic superoxide
  inhibits vulval development by acting downstream of LIN-1, via an unknown target.
  The NADPH oxidases BLI-3 and DUOX-2 promote vulva development by an independent
  pathway. This pathway is ROS-dependent as the NADPH oxidases are activated by CED-10Rac,
  which is inhibited by ROS via C18, however, the source and nature of this ROS are
  not known. The targets of NADPH oxidase-produced ROS have not been identified. It
  is also not known whether for vulva development NADPH oxidases act at the plasma
  membrane and produce ROS extracellularly, or whether they act at the ER membrane
  and produce ROS in the ER. All pathways are depicted as acting in the same cell
  although it is possible that the different signalling pathways act in different
  cell types and could thereby participate in intercellular communication during vulva
  development.
