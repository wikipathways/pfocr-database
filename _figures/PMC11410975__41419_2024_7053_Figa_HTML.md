caption: ALKBH5 activated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and mediated m6A demethylation
  on Stat3 mRNA, but not Jak2 mRNA, resulting in the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation
  of STAT3, which enhances the transcription of hypertrophic genes (e.g., Nppa) and
  ultimately leads to the emergence of cardiomyocytes hypertrophic growth
