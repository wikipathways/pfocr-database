caption: a | Regulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) transcription and
  the role of mutations in the TERT promoter. The wild-type promoter of the TERT gene
  is often silenced by the gene-repressive trimethylation of histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27me3)
  modification. The wild-type promoter contains native binding sites (with the motif
  GGAA) for the ETS family of transcription factors. In diverse cancer types, C?T
  transitions occur 124 bp and 146 bp upstream of the translation start codon, which
  are referred to as C228T and C250T based on their genomic coordinates. These mutations
  are mutually exclusive and create additional ETS binding sites three to five helical
  turns (not shown) away from the native ETS sites, which are optimal for recruiting
  the ETS hetero-tetramer GABPA–GABPB. Mutant TERT alleles more commonly associate
  with RNA polymerase II and are marked by the gene-activating H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and
  acetylated histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9ac) modifications. MutantTERT alleles cause upregulation
  of TERT transcription and increased telomerase activity. TSS, transcription start
  site. b | Regulation of human telomerase RNA (hTR) biogenesis. hTR is transcribed
  as a precursor molecule with a 5' methylguanosine cap (m7G). The m7G cap is further
  methylated by trimethylguanosine synthase (TGS1) into m2,2,7G. The majority of hTR
  transcripts have a short (<10 nucleotides), genomically encoded tail. These precursors
  are exonucleolytically trimmed to produce mature hTR. hTR precursors can be oligo-adenylated
  by non-canonical poly(A) RNA polymerase PAPD5, which is a member of the TRAMP complex
  along with the RNA-exosome helicase MTR4 and the zinc-finger protein ZCCHC7. A subset
  of these oligo-adenylated hTR intermediates are substrates for degradation by the
  RNA exosome, to which they are recruited by the nuclear exosomal targeting (NEXT)
  complex and the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC). hTR can also undergo decapping
  by the cytoplasmic decapping enzyme DCP2 and degradation in the 5'–3 direction by
  5'–3' exoribonuclease 1 (XRN1). The remaining oligo-adenylated hTR intermediates
  are bound by PABPN1 and can be de-adenylated by the disease-associated poly(A) ribonuclease
  (PARN), which promotes hTR maturation and accumulation. There is also a direct maturation
  pathway for hTR precursors, which functions in the absence of both PARN and PAPD5;
  the enzymes involved in this pathway are still unknown. H-box, single-strand hinge
  in H/ACA domain.
