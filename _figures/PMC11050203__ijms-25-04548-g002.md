caption: 'Biogenesis pathways and mutual regulatory relationships of mRNA, miRNA,
  lncRNA, and circRNA. (a) mRNA generated from a gene undergoes capping, tailing,
  and splicing to produce mature mRNA. This mature mRNA is regulated directly by miRNA
  or indirectly by lncRNA or circRNA in the cytoplasm, thereby controlling the translation
  of the mRNA. (b) CircRNA is generated through back-splicing, intron-pairing-driven
  circularization, and lariat-driven circularization. Back-splicing involves connecting
  the 5′ splice donor site downstream to the 3ʹ splice acceptor site upstream, forming
  a circular structure. In intron-pairing-driven circularization, circRNA is formed
  by the binding of inverted complementary sequences on the sides of long intron base
  pairs. Lariat-driven circularization occurs when the excision process of regular
  splicing fails, resulting in the generation of a circRNA. CircRNA binds to miRNA,
  indirectly influencing gene expression by preventing miRNA from binding to target
  genes. (c) Pri-miRNA is transcribed from the miRNA gene and is cleaved by Drosha
  to produce pre-miRNA. The pre-miRNA is then transported to the cytoplasm and processed
  to form a miRNA duplex by Dicer. One of the strands binds with AGO to form the RISC,
  which subsequently interacts with the target mRNA, leading to an inhibition of translation.
  (d) LncRNA is generated from DNA similarly to mRNA, undergoing capping, splicing,
  and tailing. Once generated, lncRNA in the cytoplasm binds to miRNA, indirectly
  affecting gene expression by inhibiting miRNA from binding to target genes. mRNA:
  messenger RNA; miRNA: microRNA; lncRNA: long non-coding RNA; circRNA: circular RNA;
  pri-miRNA: primary miRNA; pre-miRNA: precursor miRNA; AGO: Argonaute; RISC: RNA-induced
  silencing complex'
