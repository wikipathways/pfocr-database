caption: Mapping of TLR signalling pathway in ACLF patients. Each gene in the KEGG
  TLR signalling network (KEGG hsa04620) was coloured according to its expression
  level in PMNs of the ACLF group compared with that of HCs. Genes that were significantly
  upregulated are coloured red, and those that were significantly downregulated are
  marked green. The ubiquitous expression level is indicated in grey. The gene that
  was shown in the blank was not measured in the experiment
