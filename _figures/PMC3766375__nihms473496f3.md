caption: PCa cancer cells show high rates of de novo lipid synthesis and the enzymes
  belonging to the pathway are regulated by oncogenic signals. Growth factor-activated
  PI3K-Akt or hypoxia-induced HIF stimulates glucose uptake and hexokinases to promote
  glycolysis, providing more synthetic precursors for FA synthesis. Akt also activates
  the lipogenic enzyme activity and expression through direct phosphorylation or SREBP-mediated
  transcription of lipogenic genes. Activation of E2F following loss of the retinoblastoma
  (Rb) protein increases expression of SREBPs and their target genes. The tumor suppressor
  p53 plays a role in glucose uptake, pentose phosphate pathway, transcription of
  lipogenic genes, and anaplerosis of citrate. Mutant p53 (p53mut) also increases
  the expression of genes within the cholesterol biosynthesis (mevalonate). The tumor
  suppressor LKB1-AMPK axis, activated in response to low cellular energy levels,
  inhibits de novo lipogenesis through direct inhibition of ACC and SREBP-1. Myc promotes
  citrate anaplerosis through increasing glutamine transporters and glutaminase 2
  expression. The activity and expression of lipogenic enzyme, ACLY, ACC, and FASN
  are also regulated at multiple levels through mTORC1 and mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs). IDH1, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; pRB, retinoblastoma 1; Glut,
