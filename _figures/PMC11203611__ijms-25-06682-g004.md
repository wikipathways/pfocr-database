caption: Diagram of endocannabinoid biosynthesis and mode of action of the endocannabinoid
  system within a neuron. AEA and 2-AG activate CB1 receptors, causing a drop in cellular
  cAMP, inhibition of voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs), and membrane hyperpolarization
  by stimulation of potassium channels [49]. This mode of action results the inhibition
  of neurotransmitter (NT) release into the synaptic cleft. AEA may also act by activating
  CB2 receptors and via the non-cannabinoid pathway using transient receptor potential
  cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) [50] and G protein-coupled receptor
  55 (GPR55) [51]. There is evidence that phytocannabinoids act by the CB receptors
  and TRP channels, although many data indicate that other mechanisms are also involved
  [52]. The figure was created with BioRender.com, accessed on 29 April 2024
