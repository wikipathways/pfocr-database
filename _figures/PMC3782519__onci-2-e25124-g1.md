caption: Figure 1. Inhibitory activity of miR-124 on multiple nodes of the STAT3 signaling
  pathway. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) can be activated
  by a variety of ligands, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the epidermal growth
  factor (EGF). miR-124 not only can downregulate signal transducers like SHC1 and
  STAT3, but also can occasionally inhibit the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinases 1 and 3 (MAPK1 and MAPK3), probably in a contextual fashion, when
  IL-6 is absent and cells are highly dependent on EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling.
