caption: Endogenous proteins are digested by the immunoproteasome to small peptide
  fragments. Production of the immunoproteasome is induced by IFN-γ, which leads to
  expression of LMP2 and LMP7 (which replace certain components of the conventional
  cellular proteasome) and the PA28 proteasome activator that modifies the proteasome
  so that it produces antigenic peptide fragments that are optimal for loading into
  Class I molecules. Peptides are transferred from the immunoproteasome to the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) via the TAP transporter. There the peptides are loaded, with the
  help of tapascin, calreticulin and the chaperone Erp57 into a class I heavy chain
  that associates with a β2m subunit prior to transport to the cell surface where
  it can be recognized by CD8+ T cells. The association of β2microglobulin with the
  Class I heavy chain is facilitated by an additional chaperone protein, calnexin.
