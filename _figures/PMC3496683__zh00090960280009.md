caption: Diagram of the signaling pathway by which decreased glucose regulates action
  potential frequency of VMH GI neurons. Decreased extracellular glucose leads to
  decreased glucose uptake, metabolism, and ATP production, resulting in AMPK activation.
  AMPK activation phosphorylates nNOS and increases the production of NO via the conversion
  of l-arginine to l-citrulline. NO binds to its receptor, soluble guanylyl cyclase
  (sGC), and leads to cGMP production. cGMP increases the level of AMPK activation.
  This amplification of AMPK activity inactivates the CFTR Cl− conduction. Closure
  of this Cl− conductance causes depolarization of GI neurons and leads to neurotransmitter
  release. GK, glucokinase.
