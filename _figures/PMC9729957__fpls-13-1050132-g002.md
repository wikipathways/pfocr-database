caption: The role of ROS in the regulation of plant by hormones. In the process of
  plant growth and development, plant hormones play an important regulatory role,
  such as ABA, ET, BR, etc. In the entire regulatory network, ROS may play a central
  pivotal role. It remains to be elucidated whether BAK1, as an important element
  in the pathway of ROS generation induced by flg22, is the key site associated with
  the BR signaling pathway. Lines of the same color indicate the same regulatory pathway.
