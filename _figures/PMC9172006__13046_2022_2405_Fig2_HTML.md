caption: As the canonical signaling, the TGF-β ligand binds to the heterodimeric receptor
  which regulates the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 proteins. Then, these proteins form
  complexes with SMAD4 and initiate transcription. TGF-β downstream pathway can promote
  tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, and migration by inducing the epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition (EMT). As one of the non-canonical signaling, TGF-β pathway also can
  activate RhoA signaling during EMT, and that inhibition of RhoA signaling blocks
  TGF-β-induced EMT. RhoA is mainly involved in activating stress fibers and cell
  contraction and its downstream signaling promotes cell junction dissolution. The
  activation of ROCK1 gene by RhoA increased TMEM16A channel activity owing to the
  phosphorylation of moesin at T558 in breast cancer cells. On the other hand, MiR-381
  function as a tumor suppressor by directly targeting TMEM16A and regulating TGF-β
  pathway and subsequently EMT process in the development of progression of gastric
  cancer. The interaction between TMEM16A and TGF-β may have an indirect crosstalk
  in clarifying the mechanism of TMEM16A-induced EMT. Inhibitory/negative signals
  are indicated with inhibitory red arrows; Stimulatory/positive signals are indicated
  with green arrows
