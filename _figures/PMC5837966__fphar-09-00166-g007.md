caption: Schematic graph show the cellular signaling pathway for TAAR1 acting on P-TH.
  TAAR1 is Gs-coupled receptor and activation of TAAR1 results in stimulating cAMP,
  PKA that can directly activate the phosphorylation of Ser40-TH. Another pathway
  involves PKA that activate P-I-1, which in turn inhibits protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1).
  PP-1 inhibits the phosphorylation of CamKII which active phosphorylation of Ser19-TH.
  CamKII can also inhibit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) which activates phosphorylation
  of Ser40-TH. This higher phosphorylation rate leads to the accumulation of DOPA.
