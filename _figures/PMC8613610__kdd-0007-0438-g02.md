caption: Metabolism of sphingolipids and their regulatory mechanisms in podocytes.
  Ceramide is at the center of sphingolipid metabolism and can be generated through
  multiple pathways, including de novo synthesis, hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, or
  the recycling of other complex sphingolipids. First, in the de novo synthesis pathway,
  ceramide is formed from the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA on the surface
  of the ER. Second, sphingomyelin can be hydrolyzed by sphingomyelinase to generate
  ceramide. SM synthetase can attach a PC head group onto ceramide to form sphingomyelin.
  Third, ceramide can be phosphorylated via CK to form ceramide-1-phosphate, another
  bioactive lipid. Ceramide, in turn, can be generated from ceramide-1-phosphate through
  the action of C1PPase. Fourth, ceramide can be further catabolized by CDase to sphingosine,
  which is then phosphorylated to S1P by SK. The efflux of S1P can be mediated by
  its transporters such as SPNS2, ABCA1, ABCG1, and ABCC1. Circulating S1P can bind
  to various S1P receptors and modulate MAPK signaling and small GTPase activity.
  Sphingosine can be recycled back for the generation of ceramide by CS, and S1P can
  either be dephosphorylated by S1PP or be irreversible cleaved by S1P lyase to form
  ethanolamine-1-phosphate and C16 fatty aldehyde. Fifth, ceramide can also be glycosylated
  to form the glucosylceramide or galactosylceramide, which can be converted back
  to ceramide by hydrolyzation. Glucosylceramide can be further converted into complex
  glycosphingolipids, namely gangliosides (GM3), globosides (Gb3), and cerebrosides.
  Overexpression of SMPDL3b blocks CK activity and the conversion of ceramide to C1P,
  leading to the decrease in the levels of C1P. SMPDL3b is also a protein with homology
  to ASMase. Decreased expression of SMPDL3b may lead to decreased ASMase activity
  and accumulation of sphingomyelin. JAML can enhance high glucose induced the acumulation
