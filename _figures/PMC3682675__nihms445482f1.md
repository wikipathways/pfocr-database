caption: Molecular pathways of memory reconsolidation. Molecular signalling cascades
  downstream of β-adrenergic receptors (βAR), dopamine D1 receptor (D1) and N-methyl-d-aspartate
  receptors (NMDAR) have been shown to be implicated in reconsolidation. The mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR), influenced by the activities of neuronal surface receptors
  and channels including NMDAR, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
  receptor (AMPAR), and dopaminergic and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR),
  also seems to play a key role in reconsolidation through the phosphorylation of
  kinase p70S6 (p70S6K) and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6P). βAR and D1 activate adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) leading to protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation and gene expression.
  PKA also phosphorylates AMPAR after memory retrieval. Ca++ influx from NMDAR and
  AMPAR activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (ERK), by rat
  sarcoma (RAS) and mitogen- activated protein kinase (MEK), and phosphatidylinositide
  3-kinases (PI3K). Phosphorylation of ERK increases the levels of the transcription
  factors ets-like gene-1 (Elk-1), phosphorylated cAMP response element binding (pCREB),
  known to be involved in reconsolidation. PI3K activation leads to mTOR activation
  resulting in p70S6K and rpS6 phosphorylation and synaptic protein translation. mGluR1
  receptor activation is requested after post-retrieval extinction leading to the
  selective removal of synaptic calcium-permeable AMPAR (X symbol in the Figure).
  Although the molecular details are not yet known the mGluR1-induced internalization
  of AMPAR may distinguish reconsolidation update from conventional extinction
