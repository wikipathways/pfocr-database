caption: There are two distinct mechanisms proposed as to how NLRP3 inflammasomes
  are activated by sterile particles. The first model suggests that after phagocytosis,
  the particles stimulate ROS from NADPH oxidase and/or mitochondria. The increased
  level of ROS in the cytosol is then sensed by thioredoxin (TRX) and causes its dissociation
  from thioredoxin-binding protein (TXNIP). The released TXNIP then binds and activates
  NLRP3 through interaction with LRR and NATCH domains of NLRP3. The second model
  also requires phagocytosis of the sterile particles. In this pathway phagosomes
  acidify and the drop in pH causes Cathepsin (Cat) activation. Through some unknown
  mechanism, some of the particulate-containing phagosomes rupture and release their
  contents into the cytosol. This vacuolar rupture is somehow sensed by NLRP3, possibly
  by binding a cleavage product of activated cathepsins or by the cathepsins cleaving
  NLRP3 in a way that activates it. NLRP3 associates with ASC and pro-Caspase 1 to
  form the inflammasome and cleaves the Caspase 1 zymogen into its active form. Active
  Caspase 1 then cleaves pro-IL-1β into active IL-1β. In most cases, the synthesis
  of pro-IL-1β is induced by “priming”, which requires the stimulation of pattern
  recognition receptors or cytokines to stimulate transcription of pro-IL-1β.
