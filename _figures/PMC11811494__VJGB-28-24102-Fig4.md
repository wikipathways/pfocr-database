caption: 'Green and orange rectangles denote uDEGs that encode repressors and activators
  of the ABA level and signaling pathway, respectively, and are potential TFRN targets.
  White rectangles in green and orange frames correspond to repressors and activators
  of ABA level and signaling that are not potential TFRN targets. Numbers in blue
  rectangles denote the following stages: 1 – control of ABA level; 2 – ABA perception
  by receptors; 3 – activation of master TFs of ABA response. Abbreviations for the
