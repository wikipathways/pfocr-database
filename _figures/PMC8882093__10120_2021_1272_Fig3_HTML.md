caption: Cathepsin gene expression and protein trafficking in cancer and stromal cells.
  All 15 cathepsin proteases are synthesized as catalytically inactive pro-cathepsins,
  which are glycosylated as they pass through the secretory pathway. Maturation of
  pro-cathepsin proteases occurs upon their trafficking through the endosome or lysosome,
  resulting in their pro-domain cleavage and removal. Under conditions of enhanced
  gene expression or specific cell-stimulatory cues, some cathepsin proteases are
  secreted and modulate the extracellular matrix (ECM)
