caption: 'Novel mechanisms Shp-2 used to regulate the IFN-α-induced Jak/Stat1 signalling
  pathway. The classical IFN-α-induced Jak/Stat1 signalling pathway is shown in green:
  IFNα/β binds to IFNAR and forms an active complex. The binding of the intracellular
  domains of IFNAR with Jak1 results in the dimerization and rearrangement of receptor
  subunits, leading to the activation of associated Jaks by autophosphorylation and
  the further activation of Stat1 protein. Following phosphorylation, activated Stat1
  forms heterodimers and then translocates into the nucleus where they initiate the
  transcription of IFN-stimulated genes. (A) Shp-2 is recognized as a negative player
  in the IFN-α-induced-Jak-Stat1 signalling pathway through its direct dephosphorylation
  of p-stat1. (B) Shp-2 might indirectly positively regulates the IFN-α-induced Jak-Stat1
  pathway by interfering with SOCS by (1) Shp-2 competing with SOCS for the same binding
  site in IFNAR, possibly because of the same SH2 domain possessed by Shp-2 and SOCS,
  preventing the binding of SOCS proteins to IFNAR and the consequential down regulation
  of Jak/Stat activity and (2) Shp-2 dephosphorylating active Jak, which leads to
  the loss of a target site in Jak for SOCS proteins for degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome
  pathway.'
