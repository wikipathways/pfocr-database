caption: The role of ARF1 in mediating gefitinib sensitivity in breast cancer cells.
  (A) Upon treatment with the EGFRTKi, gefitinib, ARF1 is recruited to the RTK, AXL,
  leading to the activation of this GTPase. Activated ARF1 promotes signals through
  the survival pathways, ERK1/2, Src and AKT. Furthermore, ARF1 attenuates gefitinib-induced
  apoptotic signals through p38MAPK pathway and JNK activation. Additionally, the
  actions of ARF1 on the p38MAPK mediate the internalization and degradation of the
  EGFR. Altogether, ARF1 mediates gefitinib sensitivity in breast cancer cells by
  promoting cell survival and EGFR stability.
