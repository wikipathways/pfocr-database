caption: (a) IL-6 binds to the transmembrane receptor IL-6R to generate the IL-6/IL-6R
  complex, which induces homodimerization of gp130, leading to activation of the downstream
  signaling molecules, including TYK2,JAK1,JAK2 and STAT3, promoting IL-6 transcription;
  (b) the binding of IFN-α/β to the dimer receptor IFNAR activates the JAK-STAT signal
  transduction pathway, in which STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 form a complex and then enter
  the nucleus to initiate the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). However,
  NSP1 can inhibit the IFNs response by blocking STAT1 phosphorylation; (c) TLR3 specifically
  recognizes the viral ds-RNA followed by the recruitment of signal transfer proteins
  MyD88, IRAK, IKKε and TRAF6, and eventually the NF-κB complex is activated to promote
  the transcription of inflammatory cytokines; (d) IL-1 and TNF-α can also activate
  the NF-κB single pathway to initiate the transcription of inflammatory cytokines.
  PRR activates the transcription of multiple cytokines and delays IFN-α and -β responses.
