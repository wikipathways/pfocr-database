caption: A proposal of the regulatory loop of miR-24, miR-34a, and HNF4α in bile acid
  synthesis. Bile acids are known to activate PKC and ROS generation, resulting in
  the activation of MAPK pathway. The miR-24 and miR-34a expression are induced by
  MAPK-dependent and -independent pathways, respectively. In turn, miR-24 and miR-34a
  negatively regulate the HNF4α. The down-regulation of HNF4α decreases the expression
  of bile acid-synthesizing enzymes CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, resulting in the decrease of
  bile acids.
