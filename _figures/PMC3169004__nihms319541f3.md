caption: Proposed pathway for brushite and idiopathic calcium oxalate stone disease.
  Hereditary, environmental and dietary influences produce a state of low urine volume
  and hypercalciuria. This results in Type I or Randall’s plaque formation. If the
  state of hypercalciuria and low urine volume continues without further insults then
  idiopathic calcium oxalate stone disease develops. However, if the nephron sustains
  an injury which results in collecting duct cell death and urine alkalinization then
  brushite stone disease can develop.iCaOx = idiopathic calcium oxalateK Cit = potassium
  citrateSWL = shock wave lithotripsyUPJ = ureteropelvic junction obstructionCD =
  collecting ductRTA = renal tubular acidosis
