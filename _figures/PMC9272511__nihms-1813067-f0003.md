caption: (A) In decompensated cirrhosis and ACLF, systemic inflammation increases
  energy consumption and mitochondria become dysfunctional. ATP production in peripheral
  organs declines in favour of less effective glycolysis and ROS production leading
  to cell and tissue injury. In order to cope with increased energy demands lipolysis
  and proteolysis are accelerated, increasing circulating lipids and amino acids.
  Lipids act as immune stimulants further aggravating systemic inflammation. Glutaminase
  is central in generating ammonia from amino acids that arise from proteolysis and
  intestinal translocation. Hyperammonaemia leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and
  tissue injury, aggravates skeletal muscle loss, and impairs neutrophil function,
  facilitating secondary infections which aggravate systemic inflammation. (B) Under
  normal conditions immune cells obtain most of their energy (about 36 ATPs per molecule
  of glucose) from the citric acid cycle (TCA or Krebs cycle) and OXPHOS, which take
  place in the matrix and the inner membrane, respectively, of the mitochondria. The
  TCA cycle produces NADH and FADH2, which initiate OXPHOS for ATP synthesis through
  the ETC. (C) Once activated, immune cells dampen OXPHOS and shift ATP production
  to aerobic glycolysis. The metabolic reprogramming of activated immune cells also
  implies the induction of the pentose phosphate pathway, which branches from glycolysis
  at the first committed step and use nutrients to generate nucleotides and NADPH.
  Aerobic glycolysis, which ultimately produces lactate, is less efficient than OXPHOS
  in energy production and only generates 2 ATPs per glucose molecule. Impaired OXPHOS
  in activated immune cells might also result in the leaking of electrons at the ETC,
  leading to enhanced production of ROS. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; ETC, electron transport
  chain; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
