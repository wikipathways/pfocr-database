caption: A. The triester pronucleotides studied by Meier and coworkers. The cycloSal
  pronucleotides (19) led to increased intracellular levels of NMP. The bis-cycloSal
  pronucleotides (20) are able to deliver two molecules of drug per biomolecule administered.
  B. Activation pathway for the cycloSal pronucleotides. Cleavage of the phenyl ester
  is initiated by nucleophilic attack at the phosphorus to produce the diester 22
  (step a1). Cleavage of the benzyl ester yields the nucleotide analogue 23 and salicyl
  alcohol 24 (step a2). The benzyl ester of 21 can also first be hydrolyzed resulting
  in the charged intermediate 25 (step b1), which then reacts with water to produce
  26 (step b2). Hydrolysis of 26 does not occur (step b3), and the nucleotide is not
  released.
