caption: NAXD-deficient HAP1 cells grown in galactose medium show perturbations in
  the serine biosynthesis pathway. The experimental scheme is shown in the blue inset.
  Control and NAXDko cells were seeded in IMDM and shifted to galactose-containing
  medium for 72 h before metabolite extraction and analysis by ICMS and HILIC-MS methods.
  The metabolite levels (peak areas) were normalized to summed MS1 peak intensities
  and mapped manually on the indicated central metabolic pathways. The HILIC analysis
  was performed to determine serine and glycine levels (shown in the other inset).
  The nutrient sources are marked with blue font. All values are means ± SDs of three
  biological replicates. Statistical significance was calculated using an equal variance,
  unpaired Student’s t-test; nonsignificant changes (p-value > 0.05) are not annotated
  with a symbol. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001. 6-PG, 6-phosphogluconate;
