caption: 'The mechanisms linking microbial metabolites to insulin resistance. In skeletal
  muscle, insulin stimulates glucose uptake by translocating glucose transporter (GLUT)
  4 via insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling.
  Isovanillic 3-O-sulfate increases glucose uptake by activating PI3K-AKT pathway.
  Gut bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) decrease glucose uptake by inhibiting
  AKT phosphorylation. Glucose uptake is also increased via AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK) activation, insulin-independent. 5-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactone
  activates AMPK phosphorylation, which enhances glucose uptake. Although mechanisms
  have been unknown, other ferulic acid, resveratrol, and catechin-derived microbial
  metabolites also enhance glucose uptake (left upper panel). In liver, insulin activates
  glycogen synthesis and de novo lipogenesis and suppresses gluconeogenesis via IRS-PI3K-AKT
  signaling. Propionate increases the phosphorylation of both AKT and AMPK, which
  suppresses gluconeogenesis. Hydrogen sulfide stimulates gluconeogenesis via phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase activation and reduces glycogen synthesis via the inhibition of glucokinase
  activity. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) increases gluconeogenesis via PKR-like ER
  kinase-FOXO1 pathway. Phenylacetic acid inhibits AKT phosphorylation. All short
  chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, activate
  AMPK phosphorylation, which lead to decrease lipid accumulation (left lower panel).
  In adipose tissue, insulin stimulates glucose and fatty acid uptake and suppress
  lipolysis. Failure to suppress lipolysis in insulin-resistant adipose tissue increases
  circulating free fatty acids and glycerol, which leads to an increase in ectopic
  fat accumulation in the liver and muscle and stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis.
  10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid (KetoA) increases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake
  and energy expenditure via TRPV2 activation. KetoA also increases the production
  and secretion of adiponectin via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ activation.
  TMAO increases inflammation in adipocyte. Indole and I3CA have anti-inflammatory
  effects. Conjugated linoleic acid enhances energy expenditure by increasing the
  expression of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) genes. All SCFAs inhibit lipolysis. Acetate
  inhibits lipolysis by suppressing HSL and stimulates also browning by increasing
  the expression of browning-related genes. Butyrate and propionate attenuate inflammation.
  Propionate increases glucose uptake by increasing GLUT4 expression. Butyrate enhances
  energy expenditure by upregulating PPAR-γ coactivator 1 and UCPs genes (right upper
  panel). The intestine, as discussed in this review, is an organ that actively interacts
  with gut bacteria and accumulates microbial metabolites. Intestinal lipoprotein
  secretion and gluconeogenesis are suppressed by insulin. In intestine, propionate
  and succinate act as gluconeogenic substrate, which activate gluconeogenesis via
  G6Pase activation. Butyrate increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, which
  upregulates the expression of gluconeogenic genes and increases gluconeogenesis.
  Through this mechanisms, increased intestinal gluconeogenesis suppresses hepatic
  gluconeogenesis (right lower panel). Black lines represent insulin resistance-related
