caption: 'Effects of DCVC on energy metabolism pathways. HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated
  with medium alone (control) or 20 μM DCVC for 6 or 12 h. Targeted metabolomics analysis
  was used to measure a panel of intracellular metabolites unique to specific energy
  metabolism pathways. (A) Overview of DCVC-induced changes in integrated energy metabolism
  pathways. Blue arrows indicate pathway directionality. Metabolite names in red indicate
  altered concentrations between treatment groups within same time point (P < 0.05).
  Purple and pink arrows indicate direction of change in concentrations within 6 or
  12 h time points, respectively. Green star symbols indicate altered concentrations
  between time points within same treatment group (P < 0.05). All other symbols are
  indicated in figure legend. (B) Graphical representations of selected metabolite
  concentrations grouped by energy metabolic pathway. Background color indicates corresponding
  pathway on integrated overview in panel A. Pathways represented include: (i) glucose
  metabolism, (ii) pentose phosphate pathway, (iii) purine pathways, (vi) hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway, (v) glycolysis, (vi) TCA cycle pathway, (vii) glycerol metabolism
  pathway, (viii) β-oxidation pathway, and (ix) amino acid metabolism pathways. Within
  each graph, boxes represent first quartile, median, and third quartile; whiskers
  represent minimum and maximum. All data were log2 transformed prior to statistical
  analysis to achieve normal Gaussian distribution. Data were analyzed by two-way
  ANOVA (interaction between time and treatment varied depending on metabolite, P
  < 0.05) with post hoc Tukey multiple comparisons. Asterisks indicate significant
  differences compared to medium alone (control): *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
  Pound signs indicate significant differences compared to same treatment at all earlier
  time points: #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, ###P < 0.001. N = 5 independent experiments
  for each time point. (C) Graphical representation of phosphofructokinase 1 activity
  after 12 h DCVC treatment. PFK1 activity was measured with a commercially available
  enzyme activity assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Bars represent means ± SEM. Data were
  analyzed with student t test. N = 3 independent experiments, with three replicates
  per treatment in each experiment.'
