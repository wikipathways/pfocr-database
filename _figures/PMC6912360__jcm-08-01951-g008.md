caption: Mechanism capable of expressing or inhibiting an effect of Temozolomide (TMZ).
  TMZ exerts its cytotoxic effects through methylation at the O6 position of guanine
  (G) which gives rise to DNA adducts and consequently, tumor cell apoptosis. In contrast,
  O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme that counteracts
  the effects of TMZ by removing alkylating adducts from DNA. The mismatch repair
  (MMR) pathway plays important roles in the removal and maintenance of DNA base mismatches
  caused by incorrect insertions or deletions arising from DNA replication. Base mismatches
  are detected by the heterodimers of MSH2 and MSH6, which assist another heterodimeric
  complex of MLH1 and PMS2. Unrepaired TMZ-induced O6-methyl-guanine (MeG) can pair
  with cytosine (C) or thymidine (T) and the nucleotide pair of O6-MeG/C or O6-MeG/T
  is detected by the MMR system. Keeping O6-MeG intact, only newly synthesized strands
  are excised, and this repair cycle will be repeated. With this useless cycle, MMR
  pathway stimulates DNA damage-induced G2 checkpoint and apoptosis during DNA synthesis.
  Therefore, the inactivation of MMR is associated with tolerance to the cytotoxic
  effects of alkylating agents.
