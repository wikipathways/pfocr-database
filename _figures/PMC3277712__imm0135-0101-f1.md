caption: Importance of cytokine signalling for CD4+ T-cell differentiation. (a) Diagrammatic
  representation of polarization of naive CD4+ T cells towards some of the CD4+ T-cell
  lineages identified in the mouse. Master regulators are represented in red, polarizing
  cytokines in orange and cytokines associated with each subset in blue. Red and green
  boxes identify pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory subsets, respectively. (b)
  Regulation of janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT)
  pathway by suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins. Upon cytokine binding,
  receptor hetero-dimerization (1) induces JAKs auto-activation (2) which phosphorylate
  STATs docking sites on the receptor (3). After their recruitment (4), STATs are
  subsequently phosphorylated by JAKs (5), which promotes their dimerization and translocation
  to the nucleus (6). SOCS genes are induced following STAT activation (7), and prevent
  STAT activation either by inhibiting JAK (8), or by competing for STAT docking sites
  (9). SOCS also mediate JAK ubiquitination, and so target them for proteasomal degradation
  (10).
