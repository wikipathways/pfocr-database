caption: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binds to a homodimerized VEGF receptor
  (VEGFR), which becomes phosphorylated and activated. Pigment epithelium-derived
  factor (PEDF) can increase γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 at
  the transmembrane region to generate an intracellular domain fragment,. At the same
  time, PEDF can inhibit VEGF-induced phosphorylation and activation of VEGFR1 (REF.
  ). PEDF inhibits VEGF-driven angiogenesis and permeability through the regulated
  intracellular proteolysis of VEGFR. PEDF can activate the p38 MAPK pathway to inhibit
  endothelial cell migration. It can also activate peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ (PPARγ) through cytosolic phospholipase A2α (PLA2α) to induce the expression
  of TP53, which encodes the pro-apoptotic protein p53 (REF. ). At the same time,
  endothelial activators such as VEGF and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) stimulate
  and expose CD95 (also known as FAS) on the endothelial plasma membrane. PEDF can
  sequentially activate MEK5 (which is a MAPK kinase), ERK5, PPARγ and nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB), which induces the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene CD95 ligand (CD95L),
  the protein product of which translocates to the plasma membrane. The resulting
  CD95L-CD95 complex induces the binding and activation of caspase 8 that under certain
  conditions triggers the cell death cascade,. At the same time, NF-κB activation
  has a negative impact on cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) expression,
  which decreases the capacity of FLIP to inhibit caspase 8. Conversely, PEDF triggers
  JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated
  T-cells, cytoplasmic 2 (NFATc2) and sequesters it in the cytoplasm, thus blocking
  FLIP expression. In this manner, PEDF leads to apoptosis in activated endothelial
  cells. PEDF is a ligand of two known proteins on endothelial cells that result in
  anti-angiogenic responses. PEDF binds to laminin receptor and cell-surface F1 ATP
  synthase to inhibit ATP production and inhibit angiogenesis,,.
