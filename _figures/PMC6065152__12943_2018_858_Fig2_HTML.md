caption: The pancreatic cancer microenvironment participates in metastasis. The pancreatic
  cancer microenvironment influences every step of metastasis via multiple signaling
  pathways. (1) The pancreatic cancer microenvironment can stimulate angiogenesis
  by cytokines to favor cancer cell survival and proliferation. (2) Molecules from
  the pancreatic cancer microenvironment can induce lymphangiogenesis to establish
  a pathway for lymphatic metastasis. (3) The pancreatic cancer microenvironment can
  facilitate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition to cause cancer cells to enter
  lymphatic vessel. (4) The pancreatic cancer microenvironment can play important
  roles in invasion and migration to facilitate metastasis. (5) Factors and exosomes
  derived from the pancreatic cancer microenvironment can induce pre-metastatic niche
  formation in liver and lung. These molecules or exosomes can activate hepatic stellate
  cells (HSCs) in liver for desmoplasia
