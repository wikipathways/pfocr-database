caption: External aggressors increase ROS production in the skin, which induces downstream
  MAPK signaling pathways, leading to an activation of NF-κB and AP-1. Activation
  of the NF-κB pathway induces the expression of MMPs, COX-2, and IL-6, among others.
  This leads to an increase in inflammatory processes and activates proteases that
  weaken the structure of the skin. Activation of the HH pathway through the involvement
  of GLI1 increases apoptosis and leads to an imbalance between keratinocyte proliferation
  and differentiation.
