caption: The Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and its epigenetic modification by SFN. Under basal
  conditions, Keap1 binds to Nrf2 in the cytoplasm, which promotes its proteasomal
  degradation via ubiquitination. Under oxidative stress, Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1
  and then translocates into the nucleus and binds with the small protein Maf at ARE
  sequences in the promoter regions of target genes. This drives the expression of
  several cytoprotective genes, such as HO-1, NQO1, and SOD. In TRAMP C1 prostate
  cancer cells, SFN can inhibit the expression and activity of enzymes involved in
  epigenetic regulation, including DNMT1 and 3a, as well as HDAC1, 4, 5, and 7. Significant
  inhibition of DNMT1, DNMT3a/b, and HDAC1, 2, 3, and 4 has also been observed in
  TPA-induced mouse skin JB6 P+ cells treated by SFN, which reduces the CpG methylation
  and elevates histone acetylation of the Nrf2 promoter. Ultimately, epigenetic regulation
  by SFN promotes the transcription of Nrf2 and its subsequent nuclear translocation
  and activation.
