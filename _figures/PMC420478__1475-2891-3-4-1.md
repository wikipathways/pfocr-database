caption: 'Homocysteine metabolism: methionine – folate cycle and the folate shuttle
  Hcy is an intermediate metabolic product of methionine metabolism. Once methionine
  is demethylated, producing Hcy it can be further catabolized to cystathionine and
  cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway. This transsulfuration pathway is dependent
  on the cystathionine beta synthase enzyme (CBS) and vitamin B6. Human vascular cells
  lack the CBS enzyme and therefore the transsulfuration pathway is not present. In
  the remethylation cycle termed the Methionine – Folate Cycle, folic acid (folate)
  serves as the methyl donor to convert Hcy to Methionine. This reaction is dependent
  on the Methionine Synthase (MS) enzyme and the cofactor vitamin B12. Folate serves
  not only as a methyl donor but also as hydrogen and an electron donor. This hydrogen
  and electron donation capability renders folate as a dual source for stabilization
  of the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) Cofactor of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase
  (eNOS) reaction producing the quintessential endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) and
  the additional function of being a local endothelial microenvironment antioxidant.
  These findings have led to the hypothesis of a Folate Shuttle phenomenon. As can
  be seen there may exist a relative endogenous endothelial folate deficiency resulting
  in a toxic effect of Hcy accumulation within endothelial cells as a result of this
  Folate Shuttle.'
