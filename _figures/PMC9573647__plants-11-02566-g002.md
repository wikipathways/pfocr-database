caption: 'A simplified schematic of the interactions among major VOC biosynthesis
  pathways in response to stress. (a) VOC emissions respond to biotic and abiotic
  stresses from both below and aboveground sources of a plant. (b) A generalised VOC
  emission response to stress is given, which depicts a hormetic-like biphasic pattern.
  (c) Increased stress results in decreased intercellular CO2 concentration favouring
  photorespiration over photosynthesis, which is the source of VOC precursors. (d)
  Various root-to-shoot signalling molecules that are involved in stress signalling.
  (e) Membrane depolarisation activities involving ROS accumulation and Ca2+ influx
  as well as stress-induced phytohormones, e.g., ABA, JA, SA, and ET, activate defence
  signal transduction pathways that trigger gene expression of flux-controlling enzymes,
  e.g., TPS genes. Stressors affecting leaf temperature (Tleaf) influence the activity
  of the enzymes. (f) De novo VOC synthesis in the chloroplast and cytosol involves
  VOC precursors such as G3P (for the MEP pathway) and Ery4P (for the shikimic pathway),
  PEP from glycolysis, as well as its downstream metabolites pyruvate and acetyl-CoA
  that are involved in the Shikimic, MVA, and LOX biosynthesis pathways. Note that
  the sizes of organelles are not drawn to scale. Abbreviations: ABA, abscisic acid;
  JA, jasmonic acid; SA—salicylic acid; ET, ethylene; TPS, terpene synthase; G3P,
  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; MEP, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate; Ery4P, erythrose
  4-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate; MVA, mevalonic acid; LOX, lipoxygenase;
  CLE25, CLAVATA3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED 25; smRNA, small RNAs [].'
