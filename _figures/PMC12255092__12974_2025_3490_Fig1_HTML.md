caption: Cholesterol structure and synthesis. (A) Cholesterol is composed of a central
  steroid nucleus, non-polar hydrocarbon tail and polar hydroxyl group. (B) Cholesterol
  synthesis begins with Acetyl-CoA, which is converted to HMG-CoA by the enzyme HMG-CoA
  synthase (HMGCS) in the cytoplasm. In the endoplasmic reticulum, HMG-CoA is converted
  to mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Mevalonate undergoes a series of enzymatic
  reactions, producing lanosterol. In the Kandutsch-Russell pathway, lanosterol is
  converted to dihydrolanosterol, which is further processed into lathosterol and
  subsequently 7- dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). 7-DHC is converted into cholesterol
  by the enzyme 7- dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7). In the Bloch synthesis pathway,
  lanosterol is converted to zymosterol, which is then transformed into desmosterol
  through several enzymatic steps. Desmosterol is then converted into cholesterol
  by 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24). Dotted arrows indicate multiple enzymatic
  steps not shown in the figure. Figure created with BioRender
