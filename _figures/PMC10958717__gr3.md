caption: Oxidized lipids and cholesterol break the bone homeostasis between osteogenesis
  and osteolysis. Oxidized lipids act on the receptor EP1/TP on osteoblasts to induce
  the cAMP/PKA pathway in osteoblasts, leading to the release of cytokines. Oxidized
  lipids also act directly on EP2/DP receptors on osteoclasts to promote osteoclast
  differentiation via the cAMP/PKA pathway. Cholesterol binds to Smoothened protein
  and activates the Hedgehog signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting osteoblast differentiation.
  The intermediate metabolite of cholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol, acts on liver
  X receptors (LXRs) and increases the RANKL/OPG ratio, leading to the inhibition
  of osteoclast differentiation. PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; RANKL, receptor
  activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand; OPG, osteoprotegerin.
