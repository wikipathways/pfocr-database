caption: Schematic representation of carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in sweet orange
  (Citrus sinensis) fruit indicating main enzymes involved in carotenoid compositional
  changes during ripening. The predominant flux in immature and full ripe fruit tissues
  is indicated in green and red arrows, respectively. The discontinuous arrow indicates
  a enzymatic step not yet characterized. The structure of the main carotenoids involved
  in sweet orange fruit pigmentation is background colored. Representative pictures
  of ‘Pinalate’ sweet orange mutant and its parental genotype ‘Navelate’ are positioned
  in the pathway close to the most abundant carotenoid in mature fruit tissues. PSY,

  1; βLCY2, chromoplast-specific lycopene β-cyclase2; εLCY, lycopene ε-cyclase; CYP97A

  yellow pigmentation of the “Pinalate” sweet orange mutant and reveals new insights
  into its role in fruit carotenogenesis.
