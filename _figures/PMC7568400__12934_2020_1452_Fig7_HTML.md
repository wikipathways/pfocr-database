caption: The diagram of metabolic pathways may be affected by addition of copper ions
  for BtX023. The solid red line indicates direct effect, and the red dotted line
  indicates indirect effect. The proteins marked in red are up-regulated, and the
  green are down-regulated. The blue line represents the NADPH+ produced from the
  Krebs cycle into the respiratory chain. a Synthesis of BCAA and some other amino
  acids. The red boxes are labeled with amino acids that may be synthetically upregulated,
  and the green rounded boxes are labeled with amino acids that may be downregulated.
  b Citrate cycle and oxaloacetate cycle pathway, and the expression of both key proteins
  are significantly upregulated. c Oxidative phosphorylation in which the portion
  of the IV subunit (cytochrome c oxidase) containing Cu2+ is indicated in red
