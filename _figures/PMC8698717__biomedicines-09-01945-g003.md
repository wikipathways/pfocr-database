caption: Targeting neutrophil- and platelet-dependent thromboinflammation in stroke.
  Schematic depiction of potential therapeutic targets to mitigate thromboinflammation
  in stroke. (A) Anti-neutrophil adhesion agents include P-selectin and intracellular
  adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) therapies, CD18, and CXCR2 blockade. (B) Aspirin (ASA)
  and P2Y12 inhibition (clopidogrel and ticagrelor) inhibit the platelet activation
  and aggregation by antagonizing the platelet P2Y12 receptor. Lipoxin, an endogenous
  pro-resolving molecule, engages via Formyl peptide receptor-2/lipoxin-A4 (Fpr2/ALX)
  pathway and modifies neutrophil–platelet aggregate response resulting in anti-inflammatory
  and pro-resolving response in stroke. (C) Targeting von-Willebrand factor (vWF)–GPIbα
  interaction attenuates vWF-mediated platelet adhesion. (D) Targeting reactive oxygen
  species production by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase
  (NOX) blockade or remote ischemic conditioning and hypothermia may attenuate oxidative
  stress and inflammation, reduce edema, and help to maintain the function and integrity
  of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and augment neurovascular protection in stroke.
  (E) Bryostatin and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) blockade can inhibit
  neutrophil transendothelial migration. (F) Annexin A1 (AnxA1) and related biomimetic
  peptides such as Annexin A1Ac2-26 engage via AnxA1-Fpr2-ALX by reducing neutrophil
  activation and the release of pro-thrombotic mediators, regulating neutrophil H3cit+
  (Citrullinated histone H3) production, and lastly enabling of neutrophil and platelet
  phagocytosis.
