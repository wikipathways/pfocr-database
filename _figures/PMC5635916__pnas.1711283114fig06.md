caption: Model for how cytosine deamination, base excision repair, and Mlh1-Mlh3 cleavage
  cooperate to cause R-loop–induced CAG repeat fragility and contractions. Transcription
  through the CAG repeat promotes the formation of R-loops, and this is exacerbated
  in the rnh1Δrnh201Δ mutants. Formation of R-loops can promote hairpin formation
  on the nontemplate strand. Cytosine DNA on the exposed ssDNA is deaminated by Fcy1.
  Ung1 incises the uracil before or after R-loops are displaced by incoming transcription,
  leaving abasic sites. Due to hairpin formation at the repeats, slipped-stranded
  structures can form after the R-loop is displaced. Apn1 cleaves abasic sites and
  creates DNA nicks, which can be further processed into single-stranded gaps by Exo1,
  Rad2, and Rad1. Fill-in synthesis can create a shorter tract of repeats by skipping
  the template hairpin, resulting in a CAG contraction (Right). The R-loop or slipped-stranded
  structure may also be directly recognized and cleaved by MutLγ to cause R-loop–dependent
  fragility (Left). In addition, some MutLγ-dependent events occur after action by
  Fcy1 and Apn1 (arrow from right pathway). For example, dU:dG mismatches could be
  cleaved by the Mlh1/Mlh3 (MutLγ) nuclease, predicted to act on both strands to create
  a DSB, or nicks created by BER action at dUTPs may direct MutLγ-dependent nicking
  on the opposite strand. Rad52-dependent DNA repair is crucial to heal the breaks
  and reduce YAC end loss.
