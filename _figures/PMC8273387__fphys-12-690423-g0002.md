caption: An illustration of the potential signaling events and outcomes after the
  activation of TNFR1. The binding of TNFα to TNFR1 induces the formation of a membrane-bound
  assembly known as Complex I, which is associated with the cytoplasmic tail of TNFR1
  and contains TRADD, RIPK1, TRAF2, LUBAC, and cIAP1/2, where LUBAC adds linear ubiquitin
  chains to RIPK1 and other proteins, whereas cIAP1/2 catalyze the addition of K63-linked
  polyubiquitin chains to RIPK1 and other proteins within Complex I. The ubiquitinated
  RIPK1 functions as a scaffold to recruit NEMO and TAK1, leading to the activation
  of NFκB and MAPK pathways, respectively, and promotes cell survival and inflammation
  (A). Complex I can be transformed into the secondary cytosolic Complex IIa and IIb
  to signal apoptosis (B) or necroptosis (C), respectively. (B) Caspase-8 activity
  in Complex IIa determines downstream signaling toward an apoptotic outcome and simultaneously
  prevents necroptosis by cleaving RIPK1 or RIPK3. (C) In Complex IIb, the absence
  or inactivation of caspase-8 triggers autophosphorylation of RIPK1, which in turn
  binds and phosphorylates RIPK3; phosphorylated RIPK3 recruits and phosphorylates
  MLKL, leading to MLKL's translocation to the plasma membrane where MLKL oligomerizes
  and forms pores, allowing an influx of extracellular ions and water into the cell
  that causes cell swelling and rupture, and the release of cellular contents triggers
  proinflammatory responses.
