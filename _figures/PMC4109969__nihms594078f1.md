caption: (a) Macroscopic view of Drosophilia and the midgut. (b)| PGRP-LC expression
  on the cell surface senses DAP-PGN (from Gram-negative bacteria), triggering the
  Imd pathway and the production of additional PGRPs, AMPs, Caudal and Pirk ( negative
  regulators of the Imd pathway). The amidase PGRP-LB, induced upon Imd activation,
  cleaves microbiota-derived PGN, blocking additional activation of the Imd pathway.
  (c) | Macroscopic view of the Hydra body plan consisting of two layers of epithelial
  cells, with the outermost layer exposed to bacterial symbionts. (d) | PRR signaling
  in Hydra is mediated by the HyLRR-2-HyTRR-1 complex, where HyLRR-2 serves as the
  receptor and HyTRR-1 serves as the transmembrane domain. Upon MAMP stimulation,
  MyD88 is recruited, triggering the production of AMPs such as periculin-1. Maternal
  expression of periculin-1 is responsible for shaping bacterial colonization in embryos,
  and re-establishing bacterial homeostasis in adults. (e) | Macroscopic view of the
  bobtail squid (E. scolopes) and the maturation of the light organ, induced upon
  colonization with V. fisheri. (f) | E. scolopes expresses four PGRPs. EsPGRP-3 and
  -4 function as cell surface receptors that recognize MAMPs, resulting in signaling
  activation. EsPGRP-2 is secreted by epithelial cells and crypts of the light organ,
  and detoxifies PGN via amidase activity to dampen immune responses. Loss of EsPGRP-1
  upon colonization by V. fisheri results in apoptosis and loss of appendages, marking
  the maturation of the light organ.
