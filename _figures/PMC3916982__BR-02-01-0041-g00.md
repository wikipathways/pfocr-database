caption: The estrogen receptor (ER) pathway includes the canonical and the non-canonical
  ER pathways. In the canonical pathway, the cytoplasmic estrogens bind directly to
  the nuclear membrane estrogen receptor and activate signaling. In the non-canonical
  pathway, the extracellular estrogens bind to the plasma membrane receptors and activate
  the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) or Ras signaling pathway. Alternatively,
  the estrogens first penetrate through the cell membrane and then bind to the estrogen
  receptor monomer, which is then dimerized and transported into the nucleus to activate
  signaling. Treatment with tamoxifen blocks the binding of estrogen and, thus, inhibits
  the estrogen-activated signaling. Treatment with fulvestrant inhibits the cytoplasmic
  dimerization of estrogen. Treatment with aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole,
  anastrozole and exemestane blocks estrogen production. Another characteristic correlated
  to the ER pathway is the progesterone receptor (PR) signaling, which is also involved
  in the regulation of luminal type breast cancer development. CoR, coregulators;
  RE, response element; TFs, transcription factors; mER, membrane ER; HER, human epidermal
  growth factor receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERE, estrogen response
  element; PRE, progesterone response element.
