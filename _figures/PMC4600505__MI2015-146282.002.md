caption: Mechanisms of mitotic catastrophe. (a) Cells with an abrogated G2 checkpoint
  will enter mitosis prematurely in the presence of damaged DNA and undergo segregation
  defects leading to mitotic catastrophe. (b) Cells with defects in mitotic apparatus
  and/or machinery required for faithful chromosome segregation fail to satisfy the
  spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and undergo prolonged mitotic arrest and mitotic
  catastrophe. (c) Cytokinesis defects that occur after anaphase will lead to a tetraploid
  progeny that will undergo mitotic catastrophe in the next M-phase. (d). Following
  activation of mitotic catastrophe, cells arrested in mitosis have three fates; they
  will undergo death in mitosis in the presence of cyclin B, or cyclin B levels will
  gradually fall allowing the cells to undergo slippage and exit mitosis where they
  subsequently undergo death in G1. Alternatively, cells can undergo senescence following
  slippage.
