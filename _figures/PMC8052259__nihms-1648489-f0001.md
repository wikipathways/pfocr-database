caption: m6A regulates the induction of cytokine responses through multiple mechanisms.
  1) m6A, perhaps via interactions with the YTHDF2 protein, inhibits detection of
  RNAs by RIG-I, whose role is to sense foreign RNAs and activate the MAVS signaling
  pathway [–, , , ]. 2) m6A promotes the expression of MAVS and TRAFs by promoting
  the nuclear export of their mRNAs []. This induces signaling of the MAVS pathway,
  which activates the transcription factor IRF3 through the interaction of MAVS, TRAFs,
  and the kinase TBK1. Activated IRF3, along with NF-κB, induces transcription at
  the IFN-β promoter []. 3) METTL3 regulates MyD88 isoform usage in response to LPS
  stimulation of the TLR4 pathway []. TLR4 signals through proteins such as MyD88,
  MAPKs, and TRIF to activate the transcription factors NF-κB, AP-1, and IRF3. These
  transcription factors induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF,
  IL-6, and IFN-β []. YTHDF2 also regulates the TLR4 pathway [] (not shown). Proteins
  whose expression are known to be regulated by m6A or m6A-related enzymes are shown
  in red text.
