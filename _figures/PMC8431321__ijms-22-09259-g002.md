caption: 'Recognition of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) by host cell pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs) and viral strategies to evade antiviral signaling. HEV attaches
  to host cell heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and enters by clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis. Release of viral genomic RNA in cytoplasm and RNA replication intermediates
  are sensed by host cell PRRs like retinoic-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5), and endosomal Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). This triggers their
  downstream signaling cascades, including IRF3 and NF-κB, leading to the production
  of IFNs and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Activation of the inflammatory pathway
  by replication-defective (UV inactivated) virus through TLR adaptors (MyD88 and
  TRIF) implicates the plausible role of TLR2 and TLR4 in recognizing HEV capsid structure.
  On the other hand, HEV has evolved several molecular mechanisms to evade antiviral
  responses through interplays between viral encoded and host cell proteins. ORF1
  encoded proteins PCP and MeT interfere with RLR signaling while X domain, ORF2 and
  ORF3 inhibit transcriptional activation of IRF3 by reducing its phosphorylation.
  Conversely, ORF3 enhances IFN signaling by Ubiquitination-mediated stabilization
  of RIG-I. ORF2 and ORF3 also inhibit NF-κB signaling and ORF2 mediated negative
  regulation of NF-κB signaling is relieved by interaction and colocalization of cellular
  protein TMEM134 with ORF2. Abbreviations: IKKε: IκB-kinase-epsilon; TBK1: TANK-binding
  kinase 1 (TBK1); IRF3: IFN regulatory protein 3; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
  protein; SIRP-α: signal regulator protein alpha; UV: Ultraviolet; Ub: ubiquitin;
  TMEM134—Transmembrane Protein 134.'
