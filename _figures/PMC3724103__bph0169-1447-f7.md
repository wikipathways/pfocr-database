caption: Schematic representation of the signalling pathways and molecular mechanisms
  involved in the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects of folate on homocysteine-treated
  RASMC. Both homocysteine and folate treatment increased p21 and p27 induction through
  a Src-Erk-dependent pathway, whereas their differential effects on AKT1 (de)phosphorylation
  caused different outcomes in the cytosol-nuclear distribution of p21 and p27. The
  increased nuclear fraction of p21 and p27 induced by AKT1 inactivation resulting
  from folate treatment contributed to the anti-proliferative effect in RASMC. By
  contrast, activation of AKT1 following homocysteine treatment increased p21 and
  p27 phosphorylation, resulting in their increased cytosolic sequestration and increased
  phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP. This contributed to RhoA inactivation, leading to
  the pro-migratory effect of homocysteine on RASMC. Folate treatment prevented the
  effects of homocysteine by activating RhoA through the inhibition of AKT1-mediated
  signalling pathways.
