caption: Nociceptive inputs enter the spinal dorsal horn through primary afferent
  fibers that synapse onto transmission neurons. The projection fibers ascend through
  the contralateral spinothalamic tract. Ascending projections target the thalamus,
  and collateral projections also target mesencephalic nuclei, including the DRt,
  the RVM, and the midbrain PAG. Descending projections from the DRt are a critical
  component of the DNIC pathway. Rostral projections from the thalamus target areas
  that include cortical sites and the amygdala. The lateral capsular part of the CeA
  (“nociceptive amygdala”) receives nociceptive inputs from the brainstem and spinal
  cord. Inputs from the thalamus and cortex enter through the lateral (LA) and basolateral
  (BLA) amygdala. The CeA sends outputs to cortical sites and the thalamus, in which
  cognitive and conscious perceptions of pain are integrated. Descending pain modulation
  is mediated through projections to the PAG, which also receives inputs from other
  sites, including the hypothalamus (data not shown), and communicates with the RVM
  as well as other medullary nuclei that send descending projections to the spinal
  dorsal horn through the DLF. The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) receives inputs
  from the PAG, communicates with the RVM, and sends descending noradrenergic inhibitory
  projections to the spinal cord. Antinociceptive and pronociceptive spinopetal projections
  from the RVM positively and negatively modulate nociceptive inputs and provide for
  an endogenous pain regulatory system. Ascending (red) and descending (green) tracts
  are shown schematically. Areas labeled “i–iv” in the small diagram correspond with
  labeled details of the larger diagram.
