caption: 'Roles of DUBs in Wnt/β-catenin pathway, MYC signaling pathway and Hippo
  pathway in HNSCC. Wnt/β-catenin pathway: When there is no Wnt signal present in
  the cell, a destructive complex that consists of APC protein, Axin, CK1a, GSK3 and
  β-catenin degrades cytoplasmic β-catenin. After the formation of the complex, β-catenin
  begins to be phosphorylated sequentially and undergoes UPS-mediated degradation.
  Wnt signaling is activated and the Wnt ligand forms complexes by binding to Frizzled
  receptor and Lrp5/6. After complex formation, scaffold proteins are recruited to
  the receptor, which is phosphorylated and inhibits degradation of β-linker proteins.
  This allows β-catenin proteins to transpose into the nucleus, where they bind to
  TCF/LEF transcription factors, activating the transcription of Wnt target genes.
  USP7 is able to inhibit the expression of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway; however, the
  underlying mechanism remains elusive. MYC signaling pathway: MYC is activated by
  the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, and maintains intracellular homeostasis
  and cell proliferation. USP22 is a positive regulator of the MYC signaling pathway
  but the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Hippo pathway: Physiologically,
  the Hippo pathway is normally active and the LATS1/2 kinases are phosphorylated
  and activated by MST1 and MST2. Subsequently, LATS1/2 kinases phosphorylate YAP
  and TAZ, ultimately leading to nuclear exclusion of YAP/TAZ. YAP and TAZ translocate
  to the nucleus when the core Hippo kinases are inactive; subsequently, they bind
  to TEAD family proteins to promote cell growth and proliferation or interact with
  other transcription factors or signaling molecules. UCHL3 is a new YAP-deubiquitinating
  enzyme with the ability to regulate YAP deubiquitination and stabilization. APC,
  adenomatous polyposis coli; CK1a, casein kinase 1a; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase-3;
  TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor; MST, Mammalian sterile
  20-like kinase; EZH2, enhancer of zeste homolog 2; YAP, Yes-associated protein;
