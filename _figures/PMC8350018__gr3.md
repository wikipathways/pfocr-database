caption: 'The collaborative regulatory pathway for progression of NHL in response
  to BPA exposure(A–D) (A) NHL subnetwork, (B) BPA subnetwork, and (C) regulatory
  pathway from the intersection of NHL and BPA modules were illustrated; (D) the potential
  regulatory pathway of NHL progression in response to BPA exposure. Color lines reflect
  pathway differences between NHL and BPA (red: BPA exposure, blue: NHL, black: interactions
  of NHL and BPA exposure).'
