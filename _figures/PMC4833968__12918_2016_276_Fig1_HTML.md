caption: 'Engineering a homoxylitol pathway with an anaerobically active pyruvate
  dehydrogenase and TCA cycle. a NADH output of aerobic glucose catabolism; b Replacing
  the promoter of the sdhCDAB-sucABCD operon with an anaerobically functional promoter
  pflBp6; c Homoxylitol pathway with anaerobically active pyruvate dehydrogenase and
  TCA cycle but without active pentose phosphate pathway. Symbols: the dashed line
  in a indicates the step is not active under anaerobic condition; the prohibition
  sign in c indicates the step was blocked by deletion of the gene; ArcA, aerobic
  regulator binding box; FNR, anaerobic regulator binding box; pflBp6, a promoter
  of pflB (pyruvate formate-lyase). Genes and abbreviations: PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; sdhCDAB-sucABCD operon, an eight gene operon
  that encodes for three enzymes: succinate dehydrogenase (sdhCDAB), the α-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase complex (sucAB), and succinyl-CoA synthetase (sucCD); xylA, xylose
  isomerase gene; xylB, xylulose kinase gene'
