caption: The different pathways of apoptosis. Apoptosis can follow several pathways,
  depending on the signals integrated by the cell and the respective influence of
  the mobilized pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. The extrinsic pathway is induced
  by external death signals such as TNFα and mediated by death receptors (FAS, DR4
  expressed on the cell surface. The intrinsic pathway is induced by internal stimuli
  such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, or intracellular parasites. Apoptosis could
  also be activated by unresolved endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and unfolded
  protein response (UPR) through C/EBP HOmologous Protein (CHOP) [,,,,,,,]. Viruses
  such as BHV, DENV, WNV, JEV, and HSV (in red) can induce apoptosis by the activation
  of different pathways [,,,,,,,,,,,,].
