caption: Model of SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of substrate proteins. SIRT1 binds
  to NAD+ and an acetylated substrate protein to catalyze the transfer of the acetyl
  group to the NAD backbone, thus resulting in the deacetylated substrate protein,
  nicotinamide, and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose in a 1:1:1 ratio. Upon triggering of the NAD+
  salvage pathway, NAMPT catalyzes the conversion of nicotinamide to NMN. NMN is then
  converted back to NAD+ by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 to 3.
  CR has been shown to trigger the NAD+ salvage pathway by activating NAMPT, and AMPK
  promotes an intracellular increase in NAD+ levels.
