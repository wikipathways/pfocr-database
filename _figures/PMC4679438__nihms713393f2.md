caption: Engagement of the TCR as well as the iVα14TCR leads to activation of PLCγ1,
  which hydrolyzes membrane bound PIP2 into membrane bound DAG and soluble IP3. IP3
  binds to its receptor on ER, leading to subsequent influx of calcium and activation
  of calcinuerin. Activated calcinuerin dephosphorylates NFAT to induce its nuclear
  localization and activation of transcription of target genes. DAG associates with
  and activates RasGRP1, leading to the activation of the Ras-Mek1/2-Erk1/2 pathway.
  In thymocytes, this pathway acts upstream of TSC1/2-mTOR as well as PI3K/Akt to
  induce both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation. Together with the SLAM/SAP/Fyn pathway,
  DAG also associates with and activates the PKCθ-Carma1/Bcl10-IKK-NF-κB pathway.
  Carma1 also promotes mTORC1 activation following TCR engagement. In thymocytes,
  DGKs terminate DAG by converting it to phosphatidic acid (PA) and negatively control
  the activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2.
