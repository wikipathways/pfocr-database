caption: Model of detrimental effects of Ung deficiency and misexpression during hypoxia.
  Bacterial physiology during the log phase (extreme left) is characterized by high
  metabolism and efficient DNA synthesis and repair. Under hypoxic stress (step 1),
  bacterial metabolism declines and is characterized by low DNA synthesis () and repair
  (present study). The ability of hypoxia to inflict DNA damage may lead to persistence
  of bacteria with damage in the genome (depicted by the dotted line). Release of
  bacteria from hypoxia to normal oxygen conditions (step 2) leads to reactivation
  of DNA repair processes (present study), and repair of the accumulated damage (depicted
  by the bold line) allows bacterial multiplication. Misexpression of Ung (step 3)
  under hypoxia leads to untimely excision of uracil in DNA, committing the bacteria
  to the base excision repair pathway even when the downstream repair functions may
  be deficient. Inability to complete DNA repair leads to accumulation of AP sites
  and other damage, such as DNA breaks (depicted by the broken line), which are detrimental
  to bacterial survival. In such a model, Ung deficiency at step 2 would lead to deficient
  uracil repair, an increase in C-to-T mutations, and detrimental effects on survival.
  Misexpression of Ung at step 3 would result in excessive uracil release and accumulation
  of AP sites and other irreparable DNA damage, which too would be detrimental to
  the survival of the bacteria.
