caption: An overview of the SHH signaling pathway events in cancer. Efforts to block
  aberrant SHH signaling pathways induced by cancer cells which lead to downstream
  activation of SMO and cancer progression, have not been successful thus far. The
  mechanism of action by targeted inhibitory drugs such as vismodegib is through blocking
  the pathway at SMO. Multiple proteins associated with the SHH pathway and interrelated
  pathways (e.g., MAPK) could be targeted or used in a combinatorial therapeutic approach
  to decipher drug resistance to SMO inhibitors. -Inhibition.
