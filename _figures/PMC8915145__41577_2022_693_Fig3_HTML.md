caption: In healthy individuals, follicular helper T (TFH) cell homeostasis is maintained
  by the CTLA4 pathway and regulatory T (Treg) cells as well as by IL-2. Defects in
  the IL-2–IL-2R pathway can increase TFH cell numbers, and single nucleotide polymorphisms
  (SNPs) in the IL-2 pathway are associated with autoimmune disease. Altered CTLA4
  expression or trafficking (for example, owing to LRBA mutations) or defects in Treg
  cells can increase TFH cell numbers and are also associated with autoimmune disease
  susceptibility. CTLA4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; CXCR5, CXC-chemokine receptor
  5; ICOS, inducible T cell costimulatory; PD1, programmed cell death protein 1; TCR,
  T cell receptor.
