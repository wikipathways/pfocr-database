caption: S-nitrosothiol generation pathways. (A) An interaction of thiolates (R-SH)
  with NO autooxidation products. Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) in the presence of a
  nucleophilic agent (other than water) and R-SH interaction leads to S-nitrosylation
  (R-SNO). (B) A radical pathway of R-SNO. An interaction between peroxinitrite (ONOO−)
  with R-SH or NO radicals with thiyl radicals (RS•) induces R-SNO. (C) R-SNO via
  ferric transnitrosation in haem proteins. The reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ during NO
  binding to heme group. (D) The generation of SNOs via ferric transnitrosation in
  cytochrome c. At low NO concentration, cytochrome c can bind reduced glutathione
  (GSH). This reaction is accompanied by a reversible ferric reduction and S-nitrosoglutathione
  (GSNO) synthesis.
