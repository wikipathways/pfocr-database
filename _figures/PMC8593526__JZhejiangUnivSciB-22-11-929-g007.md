caption: ' Schematic summarizing the effect and mechanism of Palrnatine (Pa) on acute
  lung injury (ALI) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. LPS significantly
  activated protein kinase B (Akt)/nuclear factor-‍κB (NF-‍κB) signaling and promoted
  the release of inflammatory mediators in cells, which induced ALI. Pa administration
  significantly alleviated the LPS-induced inflammatory response of ALI by inhibiting
  Akt/NF-‍κB signaling. Furthermore, Pa may play a protective role by hydrogen bonding
  with the THR-51 of Akt protein. iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; IL-1β: interleukin-1β.'
