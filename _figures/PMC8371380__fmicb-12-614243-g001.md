caption: Model for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in B. suis biovar 2. In the Pcs
  pathway, the membrane protein Pcs condenses CDP-DAG and choline to generate PC.
  This choline is taken up by the ChoXWV transporter. Dashed arrows indicate steps
  for which putative genes have not been identified in Brucella. In the PmtA pathway,
  three successive methylations catalyzed by PmtA convert PE to PC. PmtA, phospholipid
  N-methyltransferase; Pcs, phosphatidylcholine synthase; ChoXWV, high-affinity choline
  transport system; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine, CMP; cytidine
  monophosphate; CDP-DAG, cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol; PS, phosphatidylserine;
  PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; MMPE, monomethylphosphatidylethanolamine; DMPE, dimethylphosphatidylethanolamine;
  PC, phosphatidylcholine.
