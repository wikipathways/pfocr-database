caption: Model for ERN Factor–Mediated Regulation of Early Nodulin Gene Expression
  in M. truncatula Root Hairs.In the absence of the rhizobial partner, we propose
  that constitutive binding of ERN3 to the NF box sequence represses Mt ENOD11 gene
  expression in the root epidermis (A). During the early preinfection stages of the
  symbiotic association (B), NFs secreted by S. meliloti are perceived and transduced
  by the NFP-dependent NF signaling pathway. Transcription activation and accumulation
  of the ERN1/2 activators, probably accompanied by modifications of ERN3 protein
  levels/activities, lead to transactivation of the Mt ENOD11 gene in root hairs via
  the NF box regulatory unit (B). Upon bacterial root infection, de novo accumulation
  of active ERN3 presumably leads to the progressive repression of ERN1/ERN2 transcription
  activities.
