caption: A, Differential expression of proteins involved in glycolysis and TCA cycle.
  A pathway map was built based on Metacore GeneGO pathway maps of glycolysis and
  glyconeogenesis. Proteins higher expressed in LS+K cells are shown in red and proteins
  higher expressed in LS−K cells are shown in blue. Quantified but not significantly
  differentially expressed proteins (p > 0.05) are shown in gray. B, Peptide ratios
  for unique peptides of isoforms of hexokinase. Average values from two or three
  replicates are shown. C, Peptide ratios for unique peptides of subunits of lactate
  dehydrogenase. Average values from two or three replicates are shown. D, Peptide
  ratios for unique peptides of isoforms of pyruvate kinase. Average values from two
  or three replicates are shown.
