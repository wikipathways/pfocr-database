caption: Immunogenic potential of ferroptosis. Several factors might influence the
  immunogenicity of ferroptosis. Early, but not late, ferroptotic cancer cells are
  immunogenic in vitro and in vivo, and HMGB1 and ATP are released by early ferroptotic
  cancer cells. it is unknown if CRT is exposed on early ferroptotic cells, and this
  requires investigation. Notably, HMGB1 and ATP are not released by late ferroptotic
  cells. HMGB1 might act through the AGER/RAGE or TLR2/TLR4/TLR9 pathway and activate
  innate and adaptive immunity. Moreover, knockdown of the HMGB1 gene decreases erastin-induced
  ferroptosis, therefore pointing to the regulatory role of HMGB1 in ferroptosis (*).
  Another component potentially modifying the immunogenicity of ferroptotic cell death
  might hide behind oxPLs and other oxidized products generated during ferroptosis.
  OxPLs (eg, oxPE) can play a dual role in ferroptosis, inducing either tumor promotion
  or tumor suppression. However, the role of oxidized oxPLS in the immunogenicity
  of ferroptosis is not known. CRT, calreticulin; HMGB1, high-mobility group 1; IL,
  interleukin; oxPE, oxidized phosphatidylethanolamine; oxPL, oxidized phospholipid;
  oxPS, oxidized phosphatidylserine.
