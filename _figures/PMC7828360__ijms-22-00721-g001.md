caption: TLR4 Activation is increased in dry eye disease (DED) conditions leading
  to increased antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and cytokine production in response to
  bacterial challenge. Disruption of the corneal epithelial barrier in DED leads to
  the exposure of more TLR4 to the surface leading to greater activation by LPS which
  leads to an increased production of inflammatory cytokines and AMPs. TLR recognizes
  PAMPs and induces the production of AMPs (hBD-2 and LL-37) through the MAPK and
  NF-KB pathways. LPS (red) from bacteria (brown) is recognized by LPS-binding protein
  which in turn presents it to CD14 (yellow) attached to the phospholipid bilayer.
  CD14 transfers the LPS to the MD2/TLR4 complex. TLR4 activation is followed by the
  activation of the NF-KB and MAPK pathway to produce transcription factors that relocate
  inside the nucleus to induce the transcription of hBD-2 and LL-37.
