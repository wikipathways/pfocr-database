caption: Regulated Cell Death Pathways. The schematics illustrate the involvement
  of cysteine proteases in most regulated cell death pathways, with the exception
  of NETosis, which requires the serine protease neutrophil elastase. Different sets
  of caspases are important for either apoptotic or pyroptotic cell death. In addition
  to its role in initiating the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, caspase-8 regulates
  necroptosis by forming a complex with the pseudocaspase FLIP. Although the story
  is still quite murky in humans, regulated necrosis has been shown in C. elegans
  to depend on calpains and lysosomal cathepsins.
