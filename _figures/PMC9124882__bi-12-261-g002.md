caption: Upon TLRs stimulation, the downstream signaling pathways are activated leading
  to the initiation of adaptive immune responses. TLRs are found on the immune cells
  including DCs, macrophages, granulocytes, T and B cells, NK cells, and mast cells
  as well as endothelial, epithelial, and cancer cells. ,  Stimulation of TLRs on
  immune cells results in the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt)
  signaling pathway (). ,  The stimulation of these signaling pathways leads to an
  up-regulation of genes encoding IFN-I, a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines such
  as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12, co-stimulatory molecules
  (CD40, CD80, and CD86), chemokines (C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL3, and
  CCL4) as well as anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
  and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). These released factors trigger maturation and activation
  of innate immune cells (DCs, phagocytes, and NK cells) and adaptive immune cells
  (Teff and antigen-specific B-cells) leading to an inflammatory environment. Each
  TLR has a distinctive pattern of cellular expression and cytokine induction based
  on its role in recognizing various types of pathogens. ,  Indeed, the specific functions
  of each TLR vary according to the kind of ligand and cell. Depending on the type
  of involving TLR ligand, the response can have anti-or pro-tumor effects. ,,  Besides,
  recent researches have reported that expression and regulation patterns of TLRs,
  as well as TLRs genetic polymorphisms, are involved in the outcomes of TLR treatment.
  Therefore, personalized TLRs therapy has been investigated in many cancers such
  as colorectal cancer (CRC). On the other hand, several studies have shown that TLRs
  are expressed on different cancer cells, such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer,
  ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, melanomas, and renal cell cancer cells. Stimulation
  of TLRs on tumor cells can directly induce cancer cell death through apoptosis,
  autophagy, and necroptosis.
