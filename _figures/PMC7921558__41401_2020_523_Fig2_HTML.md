caption: The signaling mechanisms of anti-inflammatory ligands (e.g., Annexin A1),
  as proposed by Cooray et al. [], are shown. Annexin A1, Ac2–26, or LXA4, but not
  SAA, can enhance the homodimerization of FPR2 (FPR2/ALX). Receptor dimerization
  leads to p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which is thought to be mediated by β-arrestins.
  β-arrestin recruitment is also observed with proinflammatory ligands but to a lesser
  extent. The signaling is followed by the activation of Hsp27 and the production
  of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. When FPR2 and FPR1 form heterodimers, a
  different signaling pathway leading to JNK activation and cell apoptosis is activated.
  Based on the work by Gooray and coworkers []. Solid arrows indicate established
  signaling pathways, while dashed arrows indicate proposed signaling pathways.
