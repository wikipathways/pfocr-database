caption: Scheme which shows the intermediates of the proposed FUP biosynthetic pathway
  with side reactions of pathway intermediates, as well as their abundance distribution
  in samples of Fusarium proliferatum wild-type (WT) and knock-out strains. Thick
  arrows correspond to reactions of the proposed pathway, thin arrows to side reactions
  of the pathway intermediates. Dashed arrows indicate reactions that may take place
  but were not proved with the present experiment.
