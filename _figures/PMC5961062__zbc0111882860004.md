caption: 'Oxidation reactions are important for nucleotide synthesis. A, simplified
  schematic of de novo nucleotide biosynthesis highlighting the redox reactions involved.
  Ribose is produced via the pentose phosphate pathway, and synthesis of purine and
  pyrimidine nucleotides involve oxidation reactions. Both purine and pyrimidine synthesis
  use aspartate, which is generated from the oxidation of either glucose or glutamine
  (see ). The use of oxygen to regenerate ubiquinone (Q) is also shown. B, formyl-THF,
  required for purine synthesis, is produced following the oxidation of one-carbon
  units derived from serine. Substrate oxidation is indicated in blue; substrate reduction
  is in pink; and products of oxidation reactions are in orange. Abbreviations used
  are: PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; Q, ubiquinone; QH2, ubiquinol; ribose-5-P,
  ribose-5-phosphate; THF, tetrahydrofolate.'
