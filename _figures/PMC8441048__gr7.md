caption: BER act as a susceptibility modifier in C. elegans PD animalsAge-dependent
  accumulation of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA repair intermediates are generated
  through incomplete repair of endogenous base damage via the BER pathway. These repair
  intermediates promote DA neuronal vulnerability and degeneration in wild-type PD
  animals. In NTH-1-deficient nematodes, BER generated repair intermediates are not
  generated, but a state of mild mitochondrial dysfunction is induced, resulting in
  elevated H2O2 levels through the activity of SODs. In turn, SKN-1, LMD-3, and JNK-1
  are stimulated to orchestrate a response that protects DA neurons from α-syn induced
  neurotoxicity via mitohormesis.
