caption: CircRNAs play a pivotal role in the advancement of esophageal cancer by modulating
  the Wnt pathway through diverse mechanisms. circABCA13 acts as a miR-4429 sponge,
  augmenting SRXN1 expression and consequently promoting the progression of esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) through Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation. In ESCC
  cells, circ0000277 functions as a miR-873-5p sponge, elevating SOX4 expression and
  concurrently activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by sequestering miR-873-5p.
  circPVT1 serves as a miR-30a-5p sponge, influencing chemosensitivity by inhibiting
  FZD3 expression, thereby modulating chemosensitivity through ferroptosis and the
  Wnt/β-catenin pathways. circ001275 acts as a miR-370-3p sponge, directly interacting
  with and activating Wnt7a. circITCH acts as a sponge for miR-7, miR-17, and miR-214,
  leading to increased ITCH expression that effectively restrains the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway
