caption: Signaling pathways in which HMOX1 is involved. (A) Heme degradation pathway
  promoted by HMOX1 occurring in the cytosol of the cell. Heme degradation occurs
  in the cytosol by the enzyme HMOX1; the reaction involves cytochrome P450 reductase,
  NADPH as cofactor and O2, leading to the production of NADP+, and an equimolar amount
  of biliverdin, carbon monoxide and iron (Fe2+). Specifically, biliverdin can be
  further converted to bilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase (BVR). (B) Regulation
  of HMOX1 expression under homeostatic conditions. NRF2 is bound to KEAP1, ubiquitinated
  and targeted for proteasomal degradation. BACH1 binds the antioxidant response element
  (ARE) at the promoter of HMOX1, inhibiting transcription of the gene. (C) Regulation
  of HMOX1 expression during inflammation and oxidative stress. Increased intracellular
  heme levels lead BACH1 to dissociate from ARE, and reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  interacting with cysteine residues on KEAP1, cause dissociation from NRF2, which
  in turn migrates into the nucleus, binds ARE and promotes transcription of HMOX1
  (adapted from []).
