caption: Summary of signaling pathways that regulate stress-induced transcript abundance
  for genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Three distinctive pathways regulate mitochondrial
  stress response at a transcriptional level, an SA-dependent pathway represented
  by BCS1. A second pathway that represents a convergence point for signals generated
  by H2O2 and rotenone that act via the same CAREs. H2O2 and rotenone act at a transcriptional
  level, with some differences evident between genes, namely rotenone also has a repressive
  effect on specific regions of the AOX1a promoter, whereas rotenone has no direct
  effect on the promoter of UPOX. A third pathway that acts via EDS1 and PAD4 regulates
  only AOX1a. The AOX1a promoter is strongly repressed under normal conditions and
  is derepressed upon treatment. The regulation of transcript abundance upon treatment
  with SA is regulated at a transcriptional level for BCS1 and posttranscriptionally
  for AOX1a, NDB2, and UPOX. SA has a small but significant effect on the UPOX promoter
  and this may be indirect by triggering oxidative stress (see text for details).
