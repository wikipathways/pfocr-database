caption: Two proposed models of ephrin-B reverse signaling in palatal EMT based on
  current evidence. Pathway 1 places ephrin signaling downstream of Tgfß3 signaling
  such that Tgfß3 stimulates expression of EphBs and/or ephrin-Bs, leading to activation
  of PI3K signaling. In pathway 2, Tgfß3 and ephrin-B signaling act in parallel to
  stimulate PI3K together. Pathways 1 and 2 are not mutually exclusive.

  description: Two proposed models of ephrin-B reverse signaling in palatal EMT based
    on current evidence. Pathway 1 places ephrin signaling downstream of Tgfß3 signaling
    such that Tgfß3 stimulates expression of EphBs and/or ephrin-Bs, leading to activation
    of PI3K signaling. In pathway 2, Tgfß3 and ephrin-B signaling act in parallel
