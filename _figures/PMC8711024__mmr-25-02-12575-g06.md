caption: Schematic model for the action of ZOL treatment on the RANKL/RANK signalling
  pathway during osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. The figure summarizes
  the results of the present study. Vertical arrows indicate either downregulation
  or inhibition of osteoclasts. TRAF6, tumour necrosis factor-associated factor 6;
  ZOL, zoledronic acid; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK1/2, extracellular regulated
  protein kinases; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  DC-STAMP, dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein; CTR, calcitonin receptor;
  NFATc1, nuclear factor of activated T cells 1; RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear
  factor-κB ligand; IκBα, inhibitor of κBα; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
