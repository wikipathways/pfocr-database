  Additionally, EGFR/HER2 (via Akt) triggers TSC2 phosphorylation, and the combination
  of CDK4/6is and HER2 inhibitors may suppress mTORC1 activity more than either drug
  alone; Additionally, greater suppression of mTORC1 activity may relive feedback
  inhibition of EGFR family kinases. This may render HER2+ breast cancer cells more
  sensitive to the effects of EGFR/HER2 inhibitors.Akt, protein-kinase B; CDK4/6,
  cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6; CDK4/6is, CDK4/6 inhibitors; EGFR, epithelial growth-factor
  receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; E2F, a transcription factor; HER2, human epidermal
  growth-factor receptor 2; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; P, phosphate; Rb,
  retinoblastoma protein; TSC1/2, tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2.
