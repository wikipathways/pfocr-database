caption: Overview of the responses observed in Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to Serendipita
  VOCs or 1500 ppm CO2(A) and a tentative model explaining these observations (B).
  (A) Morphological and physiological changes in roots (supposedly the primary target
  of rhizofungal VOCs) and shoots upon VOC (purple color) and CO2 (blue) treatment.
  The illustration of the Arabidopsis plant is modified from figshare.com. (B) Model
  summarizing the biological processes that might be affected in VOC-exposed plants,
  based on our own observations combined with transcriptome/proteome data from other
  studies (especially ). Serendipita VOCs stimulate the photosynthetic reactions (both
  the light-dependent reactions (e.g., effect on photosystem proteins) and the Calvin
  Cycle), interfere with hormone signaling pathways, and induce gene expression (see
  purple markings). The resulting elevated sugar levels, altered hormonal crosstalk,
  and modified proteome (see asterisks) contribute to plant growth modulation in a
  direct or indirect way. Augmentation of photosynthetic activity induced by Serendipita
  VOCs and respiratory CO2 is associated with a rise in the production of the Calvin
  cycle intermediate glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate (GAP). The increase in GAP leads to
  higher sugar levels and stimulates the accumulation of plastidial MEP pathway-derived
  isoprenoid compounds, including hormones (e.g., CK, ABA), resulting in changes in
  the expression of genes involved in many different processes. The impact of elevated
  CO2 is especially linked to an enhanced photosynthetic CO2 fixation through maximization
  of the carboxylation rates of RuBP by Rubisco. At the same time, the non-productive
  oxygenation side-reaction in which Rubisco uses O2 as a substrate to oxygenate RuBP
  is competitively inhibited, preventing the formation of 2‐phosphoglycollate, which
  is recycled in the energy-demanding photorespiratory pathway instead of the Calvin
  cycle (). Feedback inhibition of photosynthesis due to elevated carbohydrate levels
  via a hexokinase-dependent mechanism of glucose sensing () does not occur in the
  VOC-exposed plants, possibly implicating the downregulation of ABA signal transduction
  () and increased cytokinin levels (). The increased sucrose and cytokinin levels
  due to volatile treatment induce the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes
  through the activation of specific transcription factors of the MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW)
  regulatory complexes, exemplifying the intimate interplay between photosynthesis,
  carbohydrate-phytohormone metabolism/signaling and gene expression. CK, cytokinin;
  IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate; MEP, methylerythritol
  4‐phosphate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RuBP, ribulose-1,5-biphosphate.
