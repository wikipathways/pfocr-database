caption: Interactions between TGFβ-NOX4 and LPS-TLR4-mediated profibrogenic signaling
  in HSCs. TGF-β released from injured hepatocytes and activated KCs binds to TGF-β
  receptor, which, in turn, upregulates NOX4 in an Smad2/3-dependent manner in HSCs.
  NOX4-generated H2O2 activates collagen α1 promoter to produce type I collagen in
  HSCs promoting hepatic fibrosis. Gut-derived LPS binds TLR4 and activates NF-κB
  via MyD88/TIRAP/IRAKs/TRAF6 pathway, which, in turn, suppresses BAMBI, a TGF-β inhibitor,
  in HSCs. LPS/TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling further propagates TGF-β/NOX4-mediated profibrogenic
  redox signaling via down-regulation of BAMBI in HSCs. TLR, toll-like receptor; IRAK,
  IL-1R-associated kinase. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred
