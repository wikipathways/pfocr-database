caption: a | CD8+ T cell subsets along their differentiation trajectory can be segregated
  on the basis of their extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption
  rate (OCR), which are a proxy for glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
  metabolism, respectively, as measured by Agilent Seahorse XF analysers (). b | Intrinsic
  metabolism of memory CD8+ T cells. Glucose-derived carbons are oxidized mostly through
  OXPHOS in the mitochondria. Fatty acid (FA)-binding proteins (FABPs) coordinate
  the uptake and intracellular management of lipids, either from extracellular uptake
  or from synthesis from glucose-derived carbons. Lipids are oxidized in the mitochondria
  through FA oxidation (FAO) via a mitochondrial transport mechanism involving the
  carnitine shuttle. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) provides the necessary NADPH
  to maintain adequate redox levels, fuel FA synthesis and provide metabolic intermediates
  for the synthesis of nucleotides. Growth factors and the overall metabolic and energetic
  state of the cell control mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)–mTORC2
  complexes to coordinate the flux of nutrients into anabolic or catabolic processes.
