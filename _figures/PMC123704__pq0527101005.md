caption: Model for the dual pathways of α-ketoglutarate biosynthesis in B. fragilis.
  The left pathway is heme-dependent at the reduction of fumarate to succinate. The
  right pathway is heme-independent and involves a mitochondrion-like aconitase for
  the conversion of citrate to isocitrate. Pathways are based on results of this study
  and on refs.  and . The enzymes that catalyze these pathways are underlined.
