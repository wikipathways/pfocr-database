caption: Possible sex effects on aspects of the CR/Met R mechanistic pathways. CR
  and MetR exert their beneficial health and lifespan effects, at least in part, by
  modulating the nutrient sensing and aging pathways of mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), sirtuins (SIRTs) and insulin-like growth
  factor 1 (IGF-1) or fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Activation (AMPK, SIRT,
  IGF-1) or inhibition (mTOR) of these pathways results in potential health benefits
  including increased glucose homeostasis, decreased body weight, decreased inflammation
  and increased mitochondrial function. There are possible differential modulations
  of these aging pathways and their associated health responses in males and females.
  Studies suggest that overall females may have a greater response to CR, with females
  having an increased response to mTOR inhibition or IGF-1/FGF21 activation, and greater
  inflammatory and mitochondrial health responses. Studies suggest that males may
  have an increased response to SIRT activation, and a greater decrease in bodyweight
  and increase in glucose homeostasis in response to CR. More studies are needed to
  clarify these potential sex differences. The male (♂) or female (♀) symbols indicate
  if there is a reported sexual dimorphism in response to the pathway or outcome,
  with the plus symbols (+) indicating the degree of the effect. The combination of
  the male (♂) or female (♀) symbol with the plus (+) symbols indicates the degree
  of the sex effect on the pathway or outcome, with ++ indicating a larger effect
  than +.
