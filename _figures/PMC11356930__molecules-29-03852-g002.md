caption: Effects of MEHTCMPs on the signaling pathway of TLRs. ⊥ represents inhibition
  and → represents promotion. First, LPS binds to LBP to form the LPS–LBP–CD14 complex.
  Then, TLR4 recognizes the complex LPS–LBP–CD14 via MD-2. This in turn activates
  the MyD88-dependent pathway, which transduces LPS-stimulated signals downstream,
  and ultimately activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, which regulates the release
  of inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IL-1β. By Figdraw 2.0
