caption: Heat stress can induce spermatocyte damage. On one hand, BAX (pro-apoptotic
  protein) responds to heat stress and accumulates in the mitochondria, while BCL-2
  is phosphorylated and loses activity. BAX is integrated into the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, causing a conformational change that releases cytochrome c into the cytoplasm.
  Cytochrome c interacts with APAF-1 to form a complex that activates the caspase
  cascade. On the other hand, heat stress connects the death receptor FAS to its ligand
  FASL through p53. FAS recruits FAS-related death domain (FADD) through the shared
  death domain (DD) to form a complex, which is bound to the caspase-8 promoter, triggering
  the caspase cascade. Heat stress activates spermatocyte apoptosis by directly activating
  the p38-MAPK signaling pathway independently of p53 signals. Finally, heat stress
  also inhibits DNA repair-related genes, such as Ogg1 (involved in base excision
  repair), Xpg (involved in nucleotide excision repair), Rad51 and Rad54 (involved
  in double-strand break repair) and, eventually, spermatocyte replication and meiosis
  separation, resulting in reproductive damage. p53 signaling plays a very important
  role in these genes and signaling pathways. p53 causes cell death through FAS; it
  also disrupts the BCL-2/BAX balance and triggers mitochondria-related apoptosis.
