caption: The network of cell apoptosis regulation induced by DNA damage []. The signals
  will be transmitted from the upstream signaling proteins to the transcription factors
  (e.g.,p53 and E2F1), then the transcription factors will regulate the transcription
  of apoptosis regulators (e.g., Bax, Bcl-2, Apaf-1 and Caspases). Rectangle, diamond
  and ellipse nodes represent signaling proteins, transcription factors and regulated
  genes, respectively. Each activation interaction is denoted as a green edge with
  an arrow head and each inhibition interaction is represented by a red edge with
  a flat-head. The solid and dash lines represent signal transduction and transcription
  regulation, respectively
