caption: 'The Tocopherol Biosynthetic Pathway in Plants and Cyanobacteria and the
  PQ Biosynthetic Pathway in Plants.Boldface arrows represent the steps leading to
  α-tocopherol, the most abundant tocopherol produced in wild-type Arabidopsis leaves
  and Synechocystis sp PCC6803. DMPBQ, 2,3-dimethyl-5-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinone; HGA,
  homogentisic acid; HPP, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate; MPBQ, 2-methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinone;
  MSBQ, 2-methyl-6-solanyl-1,4-benzoquinone; phytyl-DP, phytyldiphosphate; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine;
  solanyl-DP, solanyldiphosphate. Enzymes are indicated by circled numbers: 1, HPP
  dioxygenase (HPPD); 2, homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT); 3, homogentisate solanyltransferase
  (HST); 4, MPBQ/MSBQ methyltransferase; 5, tocopherol cyclase (TC); and 6, γ-tocopherol
  methyltransferase (γ-TMT).'
