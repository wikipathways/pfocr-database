caption: Possible scenarios after dendritic cells (DCs)-Trypanosoma cruzi interaction.
  DCs may maturate, up-regulating major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) molecule
  expression and proinflammatory cytokine production, which may stimulate antigen-specific
  T lymphocyte activation and proliferation to control parasitemia (magenta); or DCs
  may be manipulated and the resultant low MHC expression together with high regulatory
  cytokine production may lead to a weak T cell activation, helping parasite establishment
  (blue). DC deviant behavior pathway could represent a potent immune evasion strategy
  of virulent T. cruzi strains to successfully set host infection. On the other hand,
  less virulent T. cruzi strains lack DC modulation capacity, which enables host immune
  response and parasite control.
