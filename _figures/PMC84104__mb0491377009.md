caption: Models to explain Mint growth arrest states in human fibroblasts. (a) Normal
  senescence (M1) is assumed to be mediated by at least two signal pathways activated
  by a cell-cycle clock after around 60 PD (now almost certainly linked to telomere
  erosion). Both of these converge to inhibit phosphorylation of Rb by CDKs. p21 may
  also inhibit cell cycle progression via other targets (). (b) MintE6. Cells which
  have initially escaped senescence by E6-mediated loss of the p53 pathway are able
  to reestablish cell cycle arrest approximately 20 PD later. One mechanism is further
  upregulation of the p16 pathway, which may compensate for the loss of p21, although
  our data do not exclude the requirement for an additional, as-yet-unknown, pathway(s)
  indicated by Y. (c) MintE7. Escape from senescence induced by HPVE7 is associated
  with a more profound disruption of cell cycle control through abrogation of pRb
  and p21 (, ), which prevents restoration of cell cycle arrest. Clonal expansion
  is finally limited by apoptosis mediated at least in part by p53.
