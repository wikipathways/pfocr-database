caption: 'Schematic depicting pH- and serotonin-mediated inactivation of TASK channels.
  (A) At rest, TASK channels leak K+ ions into the extracellular space to establish
  the resting membrane potential and provide a countervailing force to depolarizing
  currents. (B) Acidosis (e.g., CO2 inhalation) increases the concentration of hydrogen
  ions, which bind an extracellular loop of the TASK channel to inactivate TASK, thus
  increasing membrane excitability. Likewise, activation of 5-HT2C receptors causes
  the dissociation of Gq/11 α; the G protein α-subunit (Gq/11) can inactivate the
  TASK channel directly by binding the C-terminus. It is unclear whether other factors
  in this signaling pathway inactivate TASK (). Abbreviations: 5-HT, 5-Hydroxytryptamine
  (serotonin); 5-HT2C, 5-Hydryoxytryptamine type 2C receptor; αq/11, G-protein subunit
  α; β, G-protein subunit β; DAG, diacyl glycerol; γ, G-protein subunit γ; H+, hydrogen
  ion; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; K+, Potassium ion; PIP2, phospholipid phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; PLC, phospholipase C; TASK, TWIK-related acid sensitive K+ channel.'
