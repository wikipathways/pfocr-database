caption: AngII binds the AT1 receptor to activate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase
  C (PLC)-mediated cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 binds the IP3R on the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), releasing calcium and raising cytosolic calcium concentrations.
  AngII also activates, in part through protein kinase C (PKC), phospholipase D (PLD),
  which hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidic acid (PA) which can be
  metabolized to DAG by lipid phosphate phosphatases. Small increases in extracellular
  K+ depolarize the glomerulosa cell, activating the voltage-operated L- and T-type
  calcium channels, increasing calcium influx. Increased intracellular calcium concentration
  activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases I/II (CaMK), as well as PKC
  isoforms. Both of these pathways can modulate not only StAR phosphorylation, but
  also expression, likely in part through the StAR promoter binding of cAMP response
  element binding protein (CREB). The DAG/PKC pathway also activates protein kinase
  D (PKD) which can likewise phosphorylate (and activate) CREB. DAG can be hydrolyzed
  by DAG lipase to release arachidonic acid, which can be further metabolized by 12-lipoxygenase
  to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), which also induces the phosphorylation
  (and activation) of CREB. ACTH can also mediate aldosterone synthesis through binding
  to the melanocortin type 2 receptor (MC2R), thus activating through a heterotrimeric
  Gs protein, adenylate cyclase (AC). AC converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) inducing
  a slow but sustained calcium influx through the L-type calcium channels. PKA also
  phosphorylates CREB, thereby increasing StAR expression. Cholesterol for aldosterone
  production arises from cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH)-mediated hydrolysis of
  cholesteryl esters synthesized de novo or obtained from lipoproteins and stored
  in lipid droplets. Free cholesterol is shuttled to the inner mitochondrial membrane
  by StAR likely in complex with other cholesterol transport proteins.
