caption: A relay model for the neuronal control of SSD in Drosophila. In both larval
  and imaginal tissues, Sxl acts cell-autonomously via Tra to increase female growth.
  Additionally, neuronal Sxl activity in the larval brain remotely increases the growth
  of larval tissues in females, in a pathway that is largely independent of Tra and
  of insulin signalling via IPC-secreted Ilps, which promotes growth in a non-sex
  specific manner. Although imaginal tissue growth at larval stages is unaffected
  by neuronal Sxl, the increased female size of larval tissues provides a larger store
  of pupal resources (nutrients and/or signalling molecules) to promote/maintain increased
  female growth of imaginal tissues during non-feeding pupal stages. This model summarises
  the results from our study and does not yet incorporate results from other studies
  [,] reporting effects of Myc or fat body Tra on systemic growth.
