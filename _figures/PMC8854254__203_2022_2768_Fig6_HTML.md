caption: CJAN1179 auxin production via a tryptophan-depended (TD) mechanism is much
  higher than by tryptophan-independent (TI) mechanism concluded by current work and
  displayed in straight line. As described for other fungi, it might be that auxin
  production by the plant is stimulated by fungal volatiles. This putative fungus–plant
  interaction signalling is displayed in dotted lines and has been proposed for future
  work. CJAN1179 might produce certain volatiles such as ethylene, jasmonate and sesquiterpenes
  (SQTs) that activate plant auxin biosynthesis genes. Both auxin production mechanisms
  are likely involved in enhancing lateral root and root hair formation in A. thaliana.
  Model adopted and modified from Felten et al. ()
