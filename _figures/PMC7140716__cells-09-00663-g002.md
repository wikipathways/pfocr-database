caption: Models for Smac-mimetic (SM) and ARTS-mimetic (AM) mode of action. (A) Smac-mimetic
  (SM) mode of action. Treatment with Smac mimetics inhibits the NF-κB canonical pathway
  (right) by binding and degrading cIAPs. This prevents the ubiquitylation of RIPK1
  (non-degradative, brown Ub) and leads to the formation of a complex containing RIPK1,
  caspase 8, and FADD, which promotes apoptosis. In addition, Smac mimetics-induced-degradation
  of cIAPs prevent the degradation of NIK (NF-κB inducing kinase), which in turn stabilizes
  NIK and activates the non-canonical NF-κB pathway (left). The stabilized NIK phosphorylates
  IKKα, which in turn phosphorylates p100 and generates the p52 protein. RelB-p52
  heterodimers then translocate to the nucleus and activate the expression of NF-kB
  pro-apoptotic target genes. NF-kB-mediated-induction of TNFα results in activation
  of the TNF-receptor (TNFR) extrinsic pathway. This activation induces formation
  of the complex containing RIPK1, caspase-8, and FADD, which promotes apoptosis.
  Cells expressing high levels of RIPK3 undergo necroptosis. Smac mimetics can also
  bind XIAP and hence may contribute to de-repression of caspases to induce apoptosis.

  AM bind XIAP, which may induce an allosteric conformational change resulting in
  activation of XIAP E3 ligase activity. This leads to auto-ubiquitylation and proteasomal
  degradation of XIAP. In addition, the XIAP-AM complex can bring XIAP into close
  proximity with Bcl-2 which allows its ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation
  leading to apoptosis. Figures were generated using biorender.com.

  description: Models for Smac-mimetic (SM) and ARTS-mimetic (AM) mode of action.
    (A) Smac-mimetic (SM) mode of action. Treatment with Smac mimetics inhibits the
