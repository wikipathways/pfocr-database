caption: Flow chart of sample inclusion. All patient samples were measured for prolonged
  classical pathway activity, i.e. C4 nephritic factor (C4NeF) activity, but only
  the 52 patients with a final diagnosis of C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) or immune complex-mediated
  membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) were included in this study.
  C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF) activity, i.e. prolonged alternative pathway activity,
  was measured in the number of patients indicated between brackets. DDD, dense deposit
  disease; C3GN, C3 glomerulonephritis; MGRS, monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance;
  HUS, hemolytic uremic syndrome; aHUS, atypical HUS; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.
