caption: (A) The SBP converts glucose-derived 3PG into serine and glycine, which are
  precursors for lipid and nucleotide biosynthesis. Serine is also involved in folate-mediated
  one carbon metabolism by acting as a methyl group donor for THF to methylene-THF
  conversion. Key enzymes in this pathway are PHGDH, PSAT, and SHMT. (B) Reductive
  carboxylation is an alternate pathway of glutamine metabolism in which glutamine-derived
  α-KG is converted to citrate through reverse TCA cycle flux. Under conditions of
  hypoxia or mitochondrial dysfunction (right), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 in
  cytosol, IDH2 in mitochondria) uses CO2 and NADPH to convert α-KG into isocitrate.
  Citrate produced downstream of this reaction is converted into cytosolic acetyl-CoA
  without passing through the conventional clockwise steps of the TCA cycle. Acetyl-CoA
  generated by this pathway can function as a precursor for fatty acid synthesis.
  α-KGDH, α–KG dehydrogenase.
