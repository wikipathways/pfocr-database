caption: DR3/TL1A pathway in T cells. Upon binding to TL1A, the DD of DR3 signals
  via the TRADD, which in turn, recruits RIP1 and TRAF2 to form a signaling complex
  in T cells, accompanied by the downstream activation of MAPK, NF-κB and PI3K. The
  signaling ultimately triggers pro-inflammatory responses from Tconvs and anti-inflammatory
  signals from Tregs. DR3, death receptor 3; TL1A, tumor necrosis factor-like ligand
  1A; DD, death domain; TRADD, TNFR-associated death domain; RIP1, receptor-interacting
  protein 1; TRAF2, TNFR-associated death domain; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Tconvs, conventional
  T cells; Tregs, regulatory T cells.
