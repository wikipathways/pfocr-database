caption: In this mechanism, during the osteogenic differentiation, the depletion of
  miR-185 upregulated Bgn expression, so as to activate the BMP/Smad1/5/8 signaling.
  The calvarial osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of knockout (KO) mice
  exhibited increased osteogenic differentiation ability, and KO mice was protected
  during osteoporosis. miR-185, microRNA-185; Bgn, biglycan
