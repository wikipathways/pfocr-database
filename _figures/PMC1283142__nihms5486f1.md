caption: Steroid biosynthetic pathway. Synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone begins
  with the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone by the cytochrome p450 side-chain
  cleavage enzyme located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Sequential dehydrogenation
  and hydroxylation reactions form deoxycorticosterone (DOC). In the zona fasciculata,
  not all progesterone undergoes 17α hydroxylation, and so both DOC and the cortisol
  precursor 11-deoxycortisol are formed. In humans, both the zona glomerulosa and
  zona fasciculata can convert DOC to corticosterone. However, formation of aldosterone
  from DOC through corticosterone is unique to the cells of the zona glomerulosa as
  a result of selective expression of the enzyme aldosterone synthase. a17αOH = 17
  alpha Hydroxylase; b3βHSD = Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
