caption: The cGAS‐STING pathway in senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
  regulation. Various stressors such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) or UV irradiation
  cause accumulation of DNA fragments from nucleic double‐strand breaks (DSB), termed
  cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF), in senescent cells. Damaged mitochondria
  release mtDNA into the cytoplasm. Long‐interspersed element‐1 (LINE‐1) transcription
  is upregulated, thereby promoting cDNA production in senescent cells. These DNA
  fragments are recognized by cGAS to generate 2′3′‐cyclic GMP‐AMP (2′3′‐cGAMP). 2′3′‐cGAMP
  activates both STING and TANK‐binding kinase 1 (TBK1), resulting in phosphorylation
  of IRF3. 2′3′‐cGAMP also activates IκBa. These transcription factors enter the nucleus
  and induce expression of type‐I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines. Both
  IRF3 and NF‐κB induce senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors such
  as IFN‐β, IL‐6 and IL‐8, which are known to induce ROS and maintain cellular senescence
