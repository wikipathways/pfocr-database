caption: ﾏィ and ArgR regulatory network over the GAD, ADI and AgDI systems. Schematic
  representation of the regulatory functions of the stressosome, ﾏィ and the transcriptional
  regulator ArgR, the metabolic pathways glutamate decarboxylase, arginine and agmatine
  deiminase systems and l-arginine biosynthesis pathway in   L. monocytogenes  . The
  enzymes depicted in green (GadD3, ArcA and AguA1) correspond to the genes gadD3,
  arcA and aguA1, respectively, analysed in this study by RT-qPCR. Red and blue arrows
  represent gene upregulation while dashed blue arrows represent gene repression in
  stationary phase grown cells identified in other studies. *The newly formed ammonia
  (NH3) reacts with protons (H+) forming ammonium (NH4+), which neutralizes the cytosolic
  pH.
