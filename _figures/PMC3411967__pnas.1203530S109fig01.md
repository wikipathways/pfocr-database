caption: Cell-proliferative signaling pathways in lung tumors. EGFRs signal through
  the PI3K/AKT and RAS/MEK/ERK cascades. (i) WT EGFRs are activated in a ligand-dependent
  manner. (ii) Mutant EGFRs are constitutively activated. EGFR TKIs block kinase activity
  from mutant EGFRs and inhibit downstream signaling. (A and D) Acquisition of NRAS
  or BRAF mutations (mts) leads to constitutive activation of the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway.
  (B and E) EGFR-TKIs inhibit EGFR, but mutant NRAS or BRAF maintain downstream ERK
  activation. (C) The combination of EGFR and MEK inhibitors can overcome resistance
  caused by the acquisition of NRAS mutations in EGFR-mutant cells. (F) The combination
  of EGFR and BRAF inhibitors or EGFR and MEK inhibitors can overcome resistance caused
  by the acquisition of BRAF mutations in EGFR-mutant cells.
papertitle: Lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors occasionally
  harbor BRAF gene mutations but lack mutations in KRAS, NRAS, or MEK1.
