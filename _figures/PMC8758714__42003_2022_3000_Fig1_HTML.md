caption: The established metabolic pathways are represented by solid line arrows,
  while the speculated metabolic pathways are represented by dotted line arrows. Genes
  predicted by transcriptome, metabolite profile, and WGCAN analysis are shown in
  the yellow background, and those identified by this method are shown in the blue
  background.
