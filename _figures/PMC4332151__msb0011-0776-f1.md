caption: Regulatory connections present in modelOur previous model of the photoperiod
  pathway (inset top; Song et al, ) included the circadian clock model of Locke et al
  () (orange, inset top). The new model includes the circadian clock model of Pokhilko
  et al () (orange, inset bottom). Circadian clock components are represented in red,
  flowering time pathway components in green and hypocotyl elongation pathway components
  in blue. Dashed lines represent forms of regulation that have been modelled previously;
  solid lines represent new regulatory connections. Protein components are represented
  by rectangles and mRNA by parallelograms. Model components are denoted by their
  abbreviated names (see text). PIF-interacting proteins (e.g. DELLAs, PAR1, HFR1)
  are designated “Interactors” in the hypocotyl elongation pathway.
