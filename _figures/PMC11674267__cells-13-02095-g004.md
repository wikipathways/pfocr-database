caption: Schematic diagram of how SNG induces oxeiptosis in colorectal cancer cells
  based on [20]. SNG causes ROS accumulation in cancer cells, leading to activation
  of the KEAP1–PGAM5–AIFM1 signaling pathway. KEAP1 detects ROS and dissociates from
  NRF2, facilitating PGAM5 translocation to the mitochondria. There, PGAM5 dephosphorylates
  AIFM1, which causes chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, and mitochondrial
  dysfunction, hallmarks of the oxeiptosis phenotype. Oxeiptosis is characterized
  by ROS-induced regulated cell death with minimal inflammation, distinguishing it
  from other forms of regulated necrosis. SNG—sanguinarine, NRF2—nuclear factor erythroid-derived
  2-like, KEAP1—Kelch-like Ech-associated protein 1, PGAM5—phosphoglycerate mutase
  family member 5, AIFM1—apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondrion-associated 1, GSH—glutathione,
  NAC—N-acetyl-cysteine, Sod-Py—sodium pyruvate, Cat—catalase
