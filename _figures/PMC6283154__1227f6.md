caption: Summarization of DDT pathway selection in spn1 strains. Cells tightly regulate
  the balance between error-free (template switch) and error-prone (TLS) DDT subpathways.
  In wild-type cells, utilization of both subpathways results in wild-type levels
  of genome instability. We predict that Spn1141-305 shifts the regulation, such that
  cells utilize the error-free subpathway more than wild-type cells, resulting in
  MMS resistance, HU sensitivity, decreased level of spontaneous and damage-induced
  mutation rates, and increased chronological longevity. BER, base excision repair;
  DDT, DNA-damage tolerance; HR, homologous recombination; NER, nucleotide excision
  repair; TLS, translesion synthesis.
