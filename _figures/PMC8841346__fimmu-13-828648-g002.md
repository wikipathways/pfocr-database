caption: Depiction of O-GlcNAc’s role as a nutrient sensing rheostat. Nutrient flux
  directly impacts the levels of UDP-GlcNAc, which regulates the activity and substrate
  specificity of OGT. As a result the O-GlcNAcylated proteins and their corresponding
  biological functions are a response to the nutrient levels. Below are several examples
  of O-GlcNAc’s effect at various nutrient levels. Green area is “normal” effects
  of O-GlcNAcylation and the red areas are O-GlcNAcylation’s effects under extreme
  nutrient levels.
