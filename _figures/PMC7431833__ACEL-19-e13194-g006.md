caption: Schematic diagram depicting the possible mechanisms. In AD pathology, the
  imbalance of the APP metabolic pathway caused the abnormally accumulation and aggregation
  of Aβ in the brain, and the abnormal increase in the activity and expression of
  BACE1 is one of the most important causes for the Aβ accumulation in AD. Our study
  found that the inhibition of SIRT2 induces ubiquitination and degradation of RTN4B
  by deacetylating RTN4B, then the upregulation of RTN4B leading to the reduction
  of BACE1, suppress Aβ production, ultimately alleviates the cognitive decline of
  AD.
