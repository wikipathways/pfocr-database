caption: Alchemical workflow used to predict free energy changes of SOD1 mutations,
  (a) Each amino acid residue that was mutated is shown in spheres and colored based
  on the distance from the dimer interface. (b) Residues are colored based on the
  distance to residue His63, which forms the double‐deprotonated histidine bridge
  between the Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions. (c) Mutated residues are colored based on the distance
  to residue Cys146, which forms the disulfide bond. (d) Example thermodynamic cycle
  used to estimate ΔΔG values. See Figure  for other thermodynamic cycles. (e) 500 ns
  equilibrium trajectories of both wild‐type (blue) and mutant (red) SOD1 were generated.
  Every 1 ns in each trajectory, a snapshot structure is extracted and used to start
  a 50 ps non‐equilibrium ''morphing'' simulation. The work values of all forward
  and reverse morphing simulations are used to calculate ΔG4 (gold). (f) Hybrid residues,
  where both wild‐type (blue) and mutant (red) sidechains are included, are built
  into snapshots from equilibrium trajectories to start non‐equilibrium trajectories
