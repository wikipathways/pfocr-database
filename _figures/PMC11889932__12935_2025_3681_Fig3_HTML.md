caption: 'The regulation of ferroptosis by JAK/STAT signaling pathways, focusing on
  the roles of different STAT proteins, including STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6, in modulating
  ferroptosis through pathways like SLC7A11 and GPX4 (Amino acid metabolism). STAT1
  and ferroptosis: Upon activation by interferon-γ (IFN-γ), the JAK1/2-STAT1 pathway
  downregulates the cystine-glutamate antiporter (System Xc−), reducing cystine uptake
  and leading to GSH depletion. This suppression of the GSH/GPX4 axis results in increased
  lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, contributing to cell death in diseases such
  as SS AMD. STAT3 and ferroptosis: The IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway plays a crucial role
  in regulating ferroptos is resistance across various cancers, including RCC and
  HNSCC. IL-6 activates STAT3, promoting the transcription of SLC7A11, which enhances
  cystine uptake and GSH synthesis, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis. Additionally,
  the SHP-1/STAT3/SLC7A11 axis regulates the MCL1-BECN1 interaction, impacting ferroptosis
  in HCC and NSCLC. ARPC1A, transcriptionally regulated by STAT3, also inhibits ferroptosis
  in prostate cancer by reducing GPX4 and SLC7A11 expression, facilitating tumor progression.
  STAT6 and ferroptosis: In conditions such as asthma and ALI, IL-13 activates the
  JAK2/STAT6 pathway, which promotes the degradation of SLC7A11 via SOCS1, leading
  to increased ferroptosis in airway epithelial cells. Furthermore, STAT6 inhibits
  P53 acetylation, thereby enhancing SLC7A11 expression, which mitigates ferroptosis
  during lung injury'
