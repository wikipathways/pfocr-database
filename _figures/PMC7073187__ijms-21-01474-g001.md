caption: Main mechanisms by which the breakdown of tolerance to food antigens can
  occur. A disrupted skin barrier can provide a pathway for the breakdown of tolerance
  and, through the pro-inflammatory action of epithelial cells, mastcells, and innate
  type 2 lymphoid cells (ILC2), in addition to cytokines, such as IL-33, promotes
  the sensitization to food allergens. Cytokines from damaged epitheliocytes and Th2-oriented
  dendritic cells shift lymphocyte differentiation towards a Th2 phenotype and inhibit
  T regulatory cells (Treg). Th2 cytokines drive the isotypic switching of B lymphocytes,
  leading to the production of allergen-specific IgE that anchor to the surface of
  mastcells and basophils and also induce eosinophil differentiation and homing.
