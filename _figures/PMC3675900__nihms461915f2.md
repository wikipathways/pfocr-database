caption: Arachidonic acid (AA) is obtained either directly from diet or synthesis
  from linoleic acid. This existence of PLA2 in serum lipoproteins provides local
  release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and a source of eicosanoids
  to control inflammation, immune cell function and tissue-specific control of metabolism.
  Linoleic acid is converted to arachidonic acid by a series of fatty acid desaturase
  (FADS) and elongase (ELVOL) to produce AA. In humans, there is approximately 100
  g of AA distributed between tissue and membrane compartment that have varying turnover
  rate depending on the metabolic needs of the tissue. Phospholipid AA incorporation
  occurs through the de novo Kennedy pathway or the Land's membrane remodeling pathway
  that requires AA-CoA. The remodeling of membrane PL can occur by the Lands pathway
  that uses lysophospholipid:acyl-CoA acyltransferase (LPLAT) or a CoA-independent
  transacylase pathway. AA released from membrane phospholipids can be used either
  to remodel phospholipid membranes or to synthesize eicosanoids, by the prostaglandin,
  leukotriene, cytochrome P4502 epoxygenase (CYP2), or the cytochrome P450 ω P4504
  (CYP4) pathways. The biologically potent autocoid lipids of the series-2 prostanoids
  and series-4 leukotrienes initiate their biological effects by generally activating
  prostanoid and leukotriene receptors to initiate a proinflammatory response and
  activation of nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) and anti-inflammatory response. The
  CYP2 epoxygenase, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) also initiate their biological
  responses through presently unidentified membrane receptors and activation of peroxisome
  proliferator activated receptors (PPARs). In contrast, the CYP4 ω-hydroxylase metabolite's
  mechanism of action has not been identified. It is presently believed that 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid (20-HETE) directly interacts with membrane protein channels to elicit their
  potent vasculature constrictive and proinflammatory responses. Unlike our extensive
  understanding of eicosanoids' role in immune cell regulation during inflammation
  and their function in the cardiovascular system, our understanding of their role
  in the control of intermediary metabolism is lacking as revealed by our spare knowledge
  of their metabolic effects. By the use of drugs that inhibit eicosanoid synthesis,
  including the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), we are able to modulate
  the cardinal signs of inflammation, pain, heat, redness, edema, and loss of function
  through possible metabolism by CYP2 epoxygenase resulting in reduced synthesis of
  EETs and channeling of AA to different eicosanoid metabolic pathways. CYP2C8 metabolizes
  many of the currently prescribed NSAIDs, and Montelukast inhibits CYP2C8, while
  CDC, a metabolite of ciprofazacin, inhibits 12/15-lipoxygenase. (For color version
  of this figure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book).
