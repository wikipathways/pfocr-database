caption: 'Graphic illustrates the autophagy pathway and its impairment in CRND8 glial
  cells at two levels: lowered autophagy induction and lysosomal proteolytic dysfunction,
  which are believed to contribute to AD pathogenesis,, Macroautophagy, hereafter
  referred to as autophagy, involves induction steps dependent on the inhibition of
  mTOR, elongation of a membrane structure (phagophore) around a substrate or a region
  of cytoplasm, closure of this structure to form an autophagosome, fusion of the
  autophagosome with lysosomes creating an autolysosome within which autophagosomes
  are degraded by acidic hydrolases, yielding a lysosome. To assess autophagy, we
  assayed the activation state of mTOR (induction), formation, and translocation of
  LC3-II to autophagosomes (autophagosome formation), autolysosomal degradation of
  autophagy substrates, including two autophagy related proteins, LC3-II and p62.
  Lysosome function is monitored by assay of cathepsin D (CatD) activation (proteolysis),
  CatD maturation (enzyme activation and lysosomal pH), and lysosomal acidification.
  The graphic depicts the sites of action of SWNT, internalized by endocytosis, in
  restoring normal autophagy function by depressing mTOR activity (asterisks) to stimulate
  autophagy induction and enhancing lysosomal proteolysis by increasing cathepsin
  activation possibly by restoring normal acidification of lysosomes (asterisks).'
