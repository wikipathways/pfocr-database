caption: Microglial polarization mediated by adenosine A2A and cannabinoid CB2 receptor
  and by A2A-CB2 receptor heteromer. Panel (A). By unknown mechanisms unrelated to
  the cAMP/PKA pathway activation of the A2A receptor, which couples to Gs, this receptor
  mediates pro-inflammation, whereas activation of the CB2R mediates anti-inflammation/neuroprotection.
  Panel (B). A2AR agonists acting on microglial receptors are pro-inflammatory. Within
  the A2A-CB2 receptor heteromer, activation of the A2AR reduces CB2R-mediated signaling
  (negative cross-talk). Panel (C). Blockade of the A2AR is anti-inflammatory in activated
  microglia but, also, it reverts the negative cross-talk within the A2A-CB2 receptor
  heteromers. Accordingly, A2AR antagonists are not only anti-inflammatory but potentiate
  the anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective action of endocannabinoids acting on microglial
  CB2Rs.
