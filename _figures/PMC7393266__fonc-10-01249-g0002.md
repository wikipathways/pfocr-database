caption: 'The major anti-tumor mechanisms of EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Cetuximab
  inhibits EGFR by the following mechanisms: (a) competitively blocking ligand binding
  to EGFR; (b) sterically hindering the binding of EGFR to other Her family members;
  (c) promoting EGFR internalization and degradation; (d) activating the complement
  dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) pathway; (e) causing cell cycle arrest at G1; (f) inhibiting
  the expression of pro-angiogenic factors; (g) promoting apoptosis; (h) natural killer
  (NK) cells or macrophages mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC);
  (i) increasing H2AX levels and inhibiting DNA-pk.'
