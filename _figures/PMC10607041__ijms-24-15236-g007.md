caption: Graphical overview of the effect of gallic acid on pancreatic cancer cell
  lines PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2. Gallic acid induces the generation of ROS within biological
  systems. These ROS, in turn, initiate the activation of two distinct cellular pathways,
  the p38 pathway and the ER stress pathway. The activation of these pathways subsequently
  culminates in the process of apoptosis. The two pathways are intricately interconnected
  and possess the capacity to be simultaneously modulated. The “P” in red indicated
  the phosphorylation form.
