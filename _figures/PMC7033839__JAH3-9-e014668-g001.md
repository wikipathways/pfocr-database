caption: The proposed mechanism of statins, colchicine, and aspirin on the reduction
  of radiation‐associated cardiovascular disease (RACVD). The normal inflammatory
  pathway is enhanced and perpetuated by the radiation‐induced inflammatory pathway.
  Statins have been shown to counteract DNA damage repair, reactive oxygen/rho species
  in RACVD, while counteracting the normal inflammation pathway recruitment of transforming
  growth factor‐β (TGF‐β), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Colchicine
  is proposed to counteract the initial platelet response, as well as have a role
  in blocking inflammation‐associated monocyte recruitment. Aspirin is proposed to
  specifically counteract the angiogenesis portion of inflammation, especially when
  paired with vascular endothelial growth factor‐A inhibitors. Adapted from Donis
  et al, and Williams, et al. NFκβ, nuclear factor κ‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated
  B cells; PDGF, platelet‐derived growth factor; rho, part of Ras superfamily of guanosine
  triphosphate; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor‐α.
