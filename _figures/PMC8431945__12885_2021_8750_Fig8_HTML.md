caption: A proposed model in which Uev1A promotes cell migration and EMT through the
  Uev1A/Ubc13-AKT-CT45A axis in breast cancer. The Uev1A-Ubc13 complex (E2) together
  with TRAF6 (E3) ubiquitinate AKT, which is essential for the AKT membrane localization,
  phosphorylation and activation. The phosphorylated and activated AKT positively
  regulates CT45A expression that in turn regulates the expression of CT45A downstream
  genes, leading to increased cell migration and EMT in breast cancer
