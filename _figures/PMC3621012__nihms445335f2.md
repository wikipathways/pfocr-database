caption: (A) The Myc transcription factor represses the transcription of let-7 family
  miRNAs. In turn, Myc mRNA is repressed by let-7 in an HuR-dependent manner. Myc
  also enhances miR-17~92 transcription and represses the transcription of several
  other miRNA genes. (B) NF-κB is a transcriptional activator of miR-146a. miR-146
  reciprocally decreases NF-κB activity by directly targeting TRAF6 and IRAK1, two
  adapter molecules in the NF-κB signaling pathway. NF-κB also induces the transcription
  of miR-9, which targets the NFκB1 mRNA. (C) Myb transcriptionally activates miR-15a,
  which reciprocally represses Myb mRNA.
