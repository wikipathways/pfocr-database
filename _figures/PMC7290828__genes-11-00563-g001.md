caption: Overview of the Mitochondrial Protein Quality Control System (MPQC). Mitochondria
  maintain their protein-quality control at various steps and protect cells against
  proteotoxic stress. Most of the mitochondrial proteins are synthesized at ribosomes
  anchored to OMM or ER surface. Nascent mitochondrial proteins are imported into
  the mitochondria via the TOM/TIM translocase machinery. At the outer face of the
  OMM, mitochondria have proteostasis system (mPOS, UPRam, and UPS) to ensure that
  mitochondria maintain their full protein-import capacity. Mitochondrial protein
  import is assisted by the matrix localized Hsp70 chaperone. Upon import, chaperones
  together with proteases, ensure the proper trafficking and processing of nascent
  proteins. Both the nDNA or mtDNA encoded proteins fold into their native conformation,
  assisted by mitochondrial Hsp70 and Hsp60 chaperone systems. The targeting sequence
  is cleaved off by the matrix processing peptidase (MPP), giving rise to the mature
  protein. Some preproteins undergo additional processing by MIP after the removal
  of their presequence. Under stress or disease conditions, proteins become damaged
  or denatured. The damaged proteins can be removed by LON and CLPX/CLPP proteases
  in the matrix; mAAA and iAAA in IMM; and HTRA2 in IMS. Additionally, cells can transcriptionally
  upregulate the expression of mitochondrial chaperone and protease genes via a mechanism
  known as UPRmt to relieve stress and re-establish homeostasis. In a failure of these
  MPQC mechanisms, cells have an alternative mechanism to remove damaged mitochondria.
  Dysfunctional mitochondria can be removed through the specific autophagy known as
  mitophagy, and part of mitochondria can be cleared through the mitochondrial-derived
  vesicles (MDVs). Mitophagy in mammals could be mediated either by a receptor or
  the PINK1/PARKIN-mediated pathway. Altogether, these mechanisms preserve mitochondrial
