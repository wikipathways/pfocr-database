caption: Model for the Cold Signaling Pathway and Its Regulation of Genome-Wide Gene
  Expression.Cooling activates Ca2+-dependent kinases and MAP kinases that activate
  or repress transcription factors or splicing factors. These in turn regulate the
  transcription or AS of downstream genes including other TFs and SFs, thereby driving
  cascades of cold-induced gene expression.
