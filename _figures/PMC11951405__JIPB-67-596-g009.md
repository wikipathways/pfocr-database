caption: Plant small peptides (SPs) mediate biotic stress responses (A) Systemin interacts
  with its receptor SYR1 to trigger the production of proteinase inhibitors and the
  biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene as defense signals against herbivores
  or pathogens. Systemin and the beneficial fungus Trichoderma afroharzianum T22 confer
  resistance against the pest Tuta absoluta by modulating the JA and salicylic acid
  (SA) signaling pathways. (B) CAPE1 enhances plant immunity against pathogens such
  as Pst DC3000 in tomato and Pyrenophora nodorum in wheat. (C) RALF23 and RALF33
  negatively regulate plant immune responses by interacting with the receptor‐like
  kinase FER. This interaction promotes the formation of receptor complexes with immune
  kinases EFR and FLS2, as well as the co‐receptor BAK1, thereby attenuating immune
  signaling pathways and suppressing PTI. (D) Exogenous application of mature Pep3,
  PIP1, and SCOOP12 enhances resistance to Pst DC3000 in Arabidopsis. CAPE, CAP‐derived
  peptide; PTI, pattern‐triggered immunity; FER, FERONIA; FLS2, Flagellin‐Sensing

  peptide; SCOOP12, Serine‐Rich Endogenous Peptide 12
