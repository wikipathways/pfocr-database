caption: 'OTUD5 is involved in the development of cancer (see also Table 1). OTUD5
  plays dual roles in tumor progression. OTUD5 is an oncogene in colon cancer, breast
  cancer and bladder cancer but a tumor suppressor in HCC, NSCLC and cervical cancer.
  OTUD5 affects multiple signaling pathways, including the mTOR, Hippo and Akt pathway.
  OTUD5 stabilizes key proteins, such as βTrcp1, Sestrin2, YAP, TP53, PDCD5 and Akt.
  OTUD5 regulates the transcriptional activity of TRIM25. (A,B) The orange background
  represents the cancer-promoting function. (C–E) The blue background represents the
  cancer-suppressing function. Ub: ubiquitin.'
