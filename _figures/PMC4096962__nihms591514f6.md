caption: Model of combinatorial cytokine regulation of iNOS expression in IMF. Stimulation
  of IMF with TNFα increases expression of IFNγRI and thereby sensitizes the cell
  to respond to IFNγ (A). Subsequent exposure to IFNγ triggers activation of JAK/STAT
  and Akt/NF-κB pathways that lead to increased expression of iNOS (B). Alternatively,
  stimulation of IMF with IFNγ increases the expression of TNFRII and thereby sensitizes
  the cell to respond to TNFα (A). Subsequent exposure to TNFα alone or in combination
  with IL-1α/β triggers activation of an Akt/NF-κB pathway that leads to increased
  expression of iNOS (B).
