caption: Schematic summarizing the potential pathogenic mechanism underlying CHO-mediated
  inhibition of insulin secretion. Intracellular CHO accumulation induces miR-24 expression
  in MIN6 cells and then decreases the expression of Sp1. The levels of Scgn and its
  downstream insulin granule trafficking-related proteins are decreased and insulin
  secretion is subsequently decreased. CHO, cholesterol; ↑, induction; ↓, inhibition.
  SCGN, secretagogin; p-FAK, phosphorylated-focal adhesion kinase; miR, microRNA;
  LDL-R, low-density lipoprotein receptor.
