caption: Model of DON toxicity to bovine renal epithelial cells. (A) DON inhibits
  protein translation, which triggers a ribotoxic stress response involving activation
  of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways, possibly the extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases 1 and / MAPK (ERK1/2 MAPK) cascade which upregulates p21
  and arrests cell cycle at S phase. (B) DON peroxidates both mitochondrial and cell
  membranes. The damage to mitochondrial membrane integrity induces the hypoxia-induced-
  factor (HIF) pathway described in renal cells, which would switch oxidative respiration
  to anaerobic glycolysis and promote fatty acid production. Simultaneously, damage
  to the cell membrane would induce osmoregulatory responses which would sequester
  free amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine, glutamine, glutamate, lysine, and
  alanine) while excreting osmolytes beta-alanine, taurine, and myo-inositol. Green
  metabolites were increased with DON exposure and orange metabolite were depleted
  with DON. Image components from Smart Servier Medical Art (Creative Commons license
