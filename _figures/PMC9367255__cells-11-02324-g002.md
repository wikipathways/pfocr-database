caption: '(a) The role of autophagy in the regulation of inflammation: Selective autophagy
  interacts with TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) through p62 cargo, thus
  activating the NF-κB pathway via the IkappaB kinase β subunit (IKKβ) and IκB. It
  can also degrade A20, an NF-κB inhibitor, to enhance NF-κB activation. (b) Several
  examples of the role of autophagy in antiviral type I interferon (IFN-I) response:
  Upon virus infection, autophagy can deliver pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs) to cytosolic Toll-like receptors (TLRs) for their activation. P62-mediated
  autophagy inhibits retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-dependent IFN-I secretion.
  The cGAS–STING pathway inter-inhibitively interacts with autophagy to control IFN-I
  secretion. Tetherin, as an interferon-inducible antiviral factor, modulates NDP52-mediated
  selective autophagy. (c) The roles of autophagy in adaptive immunity: Autophagy
  can enhance intracellular antigen presentation via MHC-II. The deficiency of Atg5-Atg12
  results in the increase in MHC-I through the accumulation of adapter protein-2 associated
  kinase 1 (AAK1). (d) The deletion of autophagy-related genes can dysregulate the
  vital functions of immune cells, including glycolysis, immunogenic secretion and
  differentiation. (e) Autophagy deficiency results in excessive reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) through mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) accumulation, leading
  to immune-cell apoptosis and degranulation dysfunction.'
