caption: 'Molecular mechanisms underlying TNSALP-mediated bone marrow stem cells (BMMSC)
  lineage switching. According to Liu et al. [], overexpressed TNSALP interacts with
  low-density lipoprotein-related receptors 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) molecules, one of the
  important elements of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, to inhibit phosphorylation
  of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). As a result, the nuclear location of β-catenin
  is accelerated, leading to activation of downstream genes that are involved in osteogenesis
  and controlled by T cell factor-4 (TCF-4)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) (TCF-4/LEF)
  proteins. These osteogenesis-related downstream genes may also be regulated by the
  BMP2-related signaling pathway. β-Catenin can also interact with pluripotency-related
  genes, such as Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), octamer-binding transcription factor-3/4
  (OCT-3/4), and sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2). Abbreviations: ALP, alkaline
  phosphatase; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor; AXIN, axis inhibition
