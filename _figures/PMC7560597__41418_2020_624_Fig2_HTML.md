caption: During apoptosis signaling the proapoptotic proteins such as BAK/BAX cause
  mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation and release of cytochrome c and mitochondrial
  DNA. Mitochondrial DNA can trigger cGAS–STING–TBK1 pathway to drive IFN-mediated
  immune responses. Whereas cytosolic cytochrome c drives the assembly of the Apaf1-caspaspe-9
  apoptosome that subsequently activate the initiator caspases (e.g. caspase-3 and
  caspase-7) to mediate apoptosis. Caspase-3 negatively regulates cGAS–STING pathway
  resulting in cleavage of IRF3 and STING. On the other hand, STING activation causes
  ER-stress that ultimately results in apoptosis by via BAK/BAX activation and cytochrome
  c release. Red arrows indicate negative regulation.
