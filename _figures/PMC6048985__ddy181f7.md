caption: Upregulated redox regulation in BHD-associated kidney cancer. (A) Metabolites
  in pentose phosphate pathway. (B) Metabolites in glutathione synthetic pathway.
  Reduced GSH was not detected in normal kidney. Y-axis represents arbitrary unit
  of signal intensity detected in LC/MS spectrometry. Blue or red square box represents
  data of adjacent normal kidney (normal) or BHD-associated kidney cancer (tumor),
  respectively. Upper or lower edge of square box indicates upper or lower quartile,
  respectively. Upper or lower whisker indicates maximum or minimum of distribution,
  respectively. Plus indicates mean value. Line inside square box indicates median
  value. White dot indicates extreme data points. Welch’s two sample t-test was applied
  to determine whether the means of two populations are different. Free fatty acids,
  monoacylglycerols and acyl-carnitines.
