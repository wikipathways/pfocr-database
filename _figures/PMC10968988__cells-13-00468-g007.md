caption: Schematic summarizing the linkage of CRAC channels and the application of
  CAR-T cells. (left) Schematic showing T cell receptors compared to (right top) engineered
  CAR T cell receptors and associated downstream signaling pathways. (right bottom)
  Antigen binding to TCR initiates a PLC-dependent Ca2+ signaling pathway to activate
  customized gene expression. (bottom) Schematic summarizing the principle of conventional
  CAR T cell and UCNP-mediated wireless controllable light-switchable CAR T cells
  (LiCAR-T). LiCAR-T contains two non-functional polypeptides containing one component
  of a pair of optical dimerizers in each part (either LOV2-ssrA/sspB or CRY2/CIBN).
  UCNP converts NIR excitation into blue emission, which subsequently initiates the
  assembly of optical dimerizers and brings the two CAR parts into close proximity
  to enable functional CAR reassembly (schematics adapted from reference [360])
