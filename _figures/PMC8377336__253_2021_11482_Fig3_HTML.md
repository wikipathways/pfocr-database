caption: 'Mechanism of actions of d-3HB in the mitochondria and downstream signaling
  pathways on the cellular level. d-3HB serves as (A) an alternative energy fuel by
  replenishing acetyl-CoA via an independent pathway irrespective of glucose, or (B)
  an endogenous signaling molecule with functions on HDAC, NLRP3 inflammasome, and
  Gi/o-protein-coupled receptors (i.e., FFAR3 and GPR109A), which lead to a range
  of downstream effects including inhibition of inflammation and lipolysis, reducing
  oxidative stress, alleviating atherosclerosis and epigenetic changes (e.g., lysine
  β-hydroxybutyrylation on histones which regulate genes in the starvation-responsive
  metabolic pathway). Abbreviations in figure: PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex;
  AcAc, acetoacetate; HDACs, histone deacetylases; NLRP3, nod-like receptor pyrin-domain
  containing protein 3; FFAR3, free fatty acid receptor 3; GPR109A, G-protein-coupled
  receptor 109A; Kbhb, lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation. Figure produced as original artwork'
