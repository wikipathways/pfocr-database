caption: 'Representation of the putative signaling pathways involved in B-cell clonogenicity
  induced by interaction of S75X/p17R76G with p17R(s). Stimulation of B cells with
  the clonogenic p17 proteins, S75X and p17R76G, induces the activation of several
  molecules involved in promoting cell survival, cell cycle progression and in inhibiting
  apoptosis, and STRING database and literature data mining were used to identify
  known and experimentally verified interactions. The several kinases involved in
  the pathway are indicated by orange diamonds, the other proteins are represented
  by light red ellipses. PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; Akt: Protein kinase
  B;PP2C-alpha: Protein phosphatase 1A; MAPK8: Mitogen-activated protein kinase 8;
  YWHAZ: 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta; CHEK2: Checkpoint kinase 2; CDK1: Cyclin-dependent
  kinase 1; CDK2: Cyclin-dependent kinase 2; NPM: Nucleophosmin; DFF-45: DNA fragmentation
  factor subunit alpha; CASP-9: caspase-9; CASP-7: caspase-7; PAK1: Serine/threonine-protein
  kinase PAK 1; PAX2: Paired box protein Pax-2.'
