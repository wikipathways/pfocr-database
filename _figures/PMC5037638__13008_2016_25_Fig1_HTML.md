caption: 'General view of the NSP: once a ligand of the DSL family in the signal sending
  cell interacts with the Notch receptor of the signal receiving cell, NICD is released
  by proteolysis and translocated to the nucleus activating the pathway for a positive
  gene regulation together with CSL proteins, Mastermind (Mam) protein and histone
  acetyltransferases (HATs). Otherwise NSP is repressed by “default repression” complexes
  structured by Hairless (H) protein and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) and Groucho
  (Gro) co-repressors'
