caption: Interaction between TRPV1 and tumor microenvironment. Using transgenic mice,
  TRPV1 was shown to regulate TGF-β, which is the major factor that activates fibroblasts
  and transforms the fibroblasts into CAF. The CAF can secret several cytokines and
  factors, most of which are TME components, e.g., MMPs (regulates collagen in ECM),
  TNF-α and IL-6 (trigger inflammation), and VEGF (promotes angiogenesis). In cancer
  cells, TRPV1 was shown to regulate the expression of several inflammation factors,
  probably through NFκB and STAT signaling pathways. In immunocytes, TRPV1 is important
  for T-cell signal transduction. Additionally, TRPV1 can regulate the ECM by promoting
  TIMP-1 expression. In turn, fibulin 5, an ECM component, downregulates TRPV1 expression
  in cancer cells. Furthermore, TRPV1 was shown to promote angiogenesis by mediating
  Ca2+ influx and, subsequently, activating the AKT-CaMKII-eNOS signal pathway. The
  TRPV1 channel function can also be elicited by VEGF, but it is unclear if it shares
  the same downstream signal.
