caption: An illustration of signal-transduction regulation of a metabolic pathway.
  Signal-transduction regulation can be any post-translational (covalent) modification,
  such as phosphorylation or acetylation, of an enzyme or transcription factor that
  is an output of a signal-transduction pathway. In this example, the enzyme that
  catalyses the second reaction of a metabolic pathway is subject to covalent modification
  through phosphorylation by an adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent protein kinase.
  e2 denotes the fraction of the enzyme that is in the active state and e2p denotes
  the fraction of enzyme that is phosphorylated and hence inactive. Another example
  is the covalent modification of glutamine synthase where AMP groups are covalently
  attached to the enzyme by an adenylyl transferase [,]. It may be noted that intermediates
  of central metabolism such as acetyl phosphate or the glycolytic intermediate 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate
  can directly cause covalent modifications of lysine residues of enzymes [,]. This
  then is metabolic regulation of metabolism through covalent modification, and constitutes
  yet another mechanism, which does not depend on signal transduction. (Online version
