caption: Mechanism of action of cabozantinib, lenvatinib, and buparlisib in cancer.
  The three KIs discussed were the most frequently studied in the last 5 years in
  monotherapy or in combination with other cytotoxic agents to treat patients afflicted
  with solid tumors. Cabozantinib and lenvatinib are multiple kinases inhibitors and
  have their inhibitory activity established in several families of KRs. Both KIs
  inhibit kinase activity through binding to ATP pockets reversibly and competitively,
  thus stopping downstream activation pathways. Otherwise, buparlisib inhibits the
  downstream enzyme phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  and decreasing intracellular calcium concentration. The inhibitory activity of KI
  culminates in decreasing in malignant proliferative phenotype, as well as inhibits
  migratory profile and cancer survival. Created with BioRender.com.
