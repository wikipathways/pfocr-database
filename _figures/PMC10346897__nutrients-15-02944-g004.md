caption: The mechanism by which PUFAs suppress cholesterol synthesis via inhibition
  of the signaling pathway of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1)
  [74]. PUFAs through their action on the SCAP complex inhibit LXRα-LBD, which further
  generates suppression of nuclear corepressor receptors NCOR1 and NCOR2 [75]. All
  these inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids (FAs) as well as triglycerides (TGs).
  In this way, VLDL-TG is no longer synthesized. Similar to PUFAs, the high concentration
  of oxysterol has the same effect; it inhibits LXRα-LBD [76,77]
