caption: '(A) By reducing Ca2+ influx and, consequently [Ca2+]c, L-type VACCs blockers
  should reduce secretion. (B) However, the reduction in Ca2+ entry through L-type
  VACCs blockers by verapamil or nifedipine may activate the Ca2+–sensitive ACs, thereby
  causing the activation of the cAMP pathway – Ca2+ release from the ER. Thus, in
  this model we have two “antagonistic forces” driven by Ca2+ entry and cAMP: the
  channel component (fast activity) and the component of the signaling pathway (slow
  activity). (C) The “calcium paradox” implies a presynaptic/neuroendocrine cell reduction
  in Ca2+ entry produced by the low verapamil concentrations, removal of Ca2+-dependent
  inhibition of ACs colocalized with L-type VACCs, augmented cAMP, increased ER Ca2+
  release via RyR (inhibited by thapsigargin) and enhanced release of secretory vesicle.
