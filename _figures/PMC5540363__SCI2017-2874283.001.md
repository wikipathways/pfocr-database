caption: 'Oxygen regulation of ESC metabolism and epigenetic landscape. Relative to
  atmospheric oxygen (20%), physiological oxygen (1–5%) reduces the content of mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) gene expression in
  pluripotent stem cells []. These mitochondria consume less oxygen and respire less
  than those at atmospheric oxygen generating less ATP through glucose-derived oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondrial OXPHOS from glutamine- and fatty acid-derived
  carbon is still an active pathway in pluripotent stem cells; atmospheric oxygen
  increases the consumption of glutamine and its oxidation in the mitochondria [,
  ]. Pluripotent stem cells rely heavily on glycolysis, followed by the conversion
  of pyruvate to lactate, which recycles the NAD+ required for the rapid continuation
  of glycolysis. Per carbon, glycolysis is less efficient than OXPHOS at generating
  ATP; however, should there be a sufficient flux of glucose, then enough ATP can
  readily be formed. At physiological oxygen, glycolytic flux is increased relative
  to atmospheric oxygen resulting in significantly more lactate production [, , ].
  Several mechanisms direct glucose-derived carbon towards either lactate or alanine
  and away from mitochondrial OXPHOS. Under physiological oxygen conditions, the hypoxic
  inducible factors (HIFs) are stabilised; targets of transcription factor HIF2α include
  glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) [] which increases glucose transport into the cell
  and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) which inhibits the conversion of pyruvate
  to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in the mitochondrion. Uncoupling protein
  2 (UCP2), an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, blocks the import of pyruvate
  into the mitochondria in human PSC []. Glutamine and fatty acids stimulate UCP2,
  decreasing pyruvate oxidation, which in turn facilitates glutamine and fatty acid
  oxidation and the maintenance of a rapid glycolytic flux [, ]. The flux of metabolic
  reactions in PSCs is increased at physiological oxygen [] as is amino acid turnover
  [, ]. Increased serine and glycine consumption at physiological oxygen may feed
  into the folate and methionine cycles, collectively known as one carbon metabolism.
  One carbon metabolism, glycolysis, and the tricarboxlyic acid (TCA) cycle generate
  intermediate metabolites that act as cofactors for epigenetic modifying enzymes.
  Threonine and methionine metabolism in mouse [] and human [] PSCs, respectively,
  generate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which is a methyl donor for histone methyl transferases
  (HMT). Glucose-derived acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), synthesised in the TCA cycle
  or from threonine metabolism [], acts as a cofactor for histone acetyltransferases
  (HAT), modulating hESC histone acetylation and plausibly maintains pluripotency
  []. Glutamine metabolism increases the αKG:succinate ratio, leading to DNA demethylation
  by ten-eleven translocation (TET) activity, which then stimulates the mouse naïve
  pluripotency network []. In primed human ESC, an increased αKG:succinate ratio induces
  differentiation []. In human ESC, physiological oxygen causes a euchromatic state
  within NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 hypoxic response elements (HREs) allowing the binding
  of HIF2α and the upregulation of the pluripotency network []. HIFα is stabilised
  at physiological [, ] and atmospheric oxygen [] due to the action of mitochondrial
  ROS [, , ]. Stabilised HIFα protein upregulates glycolytic flux through glycolytic
  gene expression [], increases cellular glucose import, and upregulates pluripotency
  []. The proximity of the mitochondria to the nucleus facilitates a ROS-nucleus signalling
  axis in the form of H2O2, plausibly through the HIF family of transcription factors.
  Concurrently, antioxidant production is increased at physiological oxygen []. Glutathione
  (GSH) from glutaminolysis, and NADPH from either glutaminolysis or the pentose phosphate
  pathway, protect the cell from increased levels of ROS. Thick arrows and bold text
  indicate increased flux/transcription. Metabolic regulators of chromatin-modifying
  enzymes are highlighted in red. Circles attached to chromatin in the nucleus represent
  epigenetic modifications: acetylated (green); 5mC (red); 5hmC (blue).'
