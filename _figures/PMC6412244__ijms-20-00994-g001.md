caption: Model for the use of 5’untranslated region directed small molecules as therapeutic
  agents to offset lead neurotoxicity. These are depicted to act via the pathway to
  activate amyloid precursor protein (APP) and ferritin translation, preventing each
  of them from maintaining iron homeostasis and iron storage and export functions.
  Lead blocks translation of APP and thus interferes with ferroportin (FPN)-dependent
  iron export which normally results in neuroprotective consequences []. APP is an
  iron export protein associated with the onset of Parkinson’s disease with dementia
  in the event of the loss of tau microtubule associated protein []. Adapted from
  Rogers, et al. 2016, A role for amyloid precursor protein translation to restore
  iron homeostasis and ameliorate lead (Pb) neurotoxicity. J. Neurochemistry, 138,
  479–494 [].
