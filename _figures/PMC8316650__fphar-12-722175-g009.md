caption: 'Model of the pathogenesis of GC-induced microcirculation dysfunction and
  impaired osteogenesis by TXNIP and its intervention of tanshinol: Long-term high-dose
  glucocorticoid can activate expression of TXNIP proteins. TXNIP down-regulates both
  VEGF and Wnt signaling pathways in vascular endothelial cells and osteoblasts respectively,
  contributing to inhibition of angiogenesis, followed by dysfunction of microcirculation
  in bone vessels, which causes blood stasis and decreased bone formation and eventually
  induced osteoporosis. However, tanshinol protects rats from GIO involving in the
  regulation of TXNIP/Wnt/VEGF cascade pathway.'
