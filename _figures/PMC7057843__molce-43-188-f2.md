caption: A summary of the interaction between RUNX and Wnt signalling showing that
  RUNX can transcriptionally regulate a number of Wnt pathway genes whilst the RUNX
  genes themselves are subject to regulation by β-catenin, the transcriptional mediator
  of the canonical Wnt pathway. Also highlighted is the cooperation between both β-catenin
  and RUNX in the regulation of Wnt target genes. The kinase GSK3β is an important
  component of the β-catenin destruction complex but can also phosphorylate RUNX and
  inhibit function.
