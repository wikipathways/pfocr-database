  with other pathways, leading to the radioresistance of hypoxia-adapted cancer cells.
  Details are given in the text. Abbreviations: GLUT1—glucose transporter 1, PPP—pentose
  phosphate pathway, NADP and NADPH—nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and
  its reduced form, GSSG and GSH—oxidized and reduced forms of glutathione, EMT—epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition, HSF1—heat shock factor 1, ER—endoplasmic reticulum, GRPs—glucose-regulated
  proteins, HSPs—heat shock proteins, PI3K—phospho-inositide 3-kinase, mTOR—mammalian
  target of rapamycin and AMPK—AMP-activated protein kinase.'
