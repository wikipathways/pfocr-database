caption: Growth cycle of phage λ. Duplex DNA is represented as a single line. Linear
  DNA (top left) in the viral particles is injected into cells, where the cohesive
  ends (cos) are ligated to form circular DNA. Early replication in the theta (θ)
  mode produces monomeric circles, which must be converted to concatemeric DNA to
  be packaged (matured) into viable phage particles. This can occur by late rolling-circle
  (σ) replication, but only when the RecBCD nuclease is absent, because of mutation
  or inhibition by the λ Gam protein. Alternatively, recombination by the λ Red pathway
  or the E. coli RecBCD pathway can convert monomeric circles into dimeric or higher-order
  concatemers containing two or more cos sites required for packaging. RecBCD gains
  access to a monomeric circle when cos is cut during maturation; packaging proteins
  bound at the left end block access, forcing RecBCD to enter the right end and travel
  leftward. Chi stimulates RecBCD-promoted recombination, thereby allowing more λ
  red gam mutant DNA to be packaged, with the formation of larger plaques than those
  formed without Chi. (Modified from reference  [copyright 1983, Cold Spring Harbor
