caption: Schematic representation of the reactions in the properdin model. Properdin
  model is an expansion of the minimal model. The components and reactions from the
  minimal model, which do not bind properdin, are greyed out and simplified for better
  clarity. However, these reactions are modeled exactly as in the minimal model. Underlined
  components are subject to synthesis and degradation reactions, which are included
  in this model but excluded from the diagram for clarity. Reaction rate constants
  are indicated on the respective reaction arrows.
