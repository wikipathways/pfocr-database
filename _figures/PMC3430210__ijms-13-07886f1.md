caption: TRAIL signaling pathway and mechanisms of TRAIL resistance. Binding of TRAIL
  to DR4 or DR5 leads to activation of caspase-8 through FADD. Activated caspase-8
  can directly activate effector caspase-3, -6, and -7 via the extrinsic pathway or
  cleave Bid and activate the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated pathway. Initiation
  of the latter pathway leads to activation of effector caspases through caspase-9.
  Activation of caspase-3, -6, and -7 leads to apoptosis. TRAIL resistance can occur
  at several levels. At the outer membrane, TRAIL sensitivity can be reduced by DcR1
  and/or DcR2 over-expression as well as by defective expression/function of DR4 and/or
  DR5 (1). At the DISC, down-regulation, degradation or inactivation of the initiator
  caspase-8 and/or increased expression of c-FLIP can lead to TRAIL resistance (2).
  At the mitochondria, defects in pro-apoptotic molecules (e.g., Bid, Bax, Bak, PUMA,
  Bim) and/or up-regulation of proteins able to prevent cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO
  release (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1) also interfere with TRAIL signaling (3).
  Finally, members of the IAP family prevent the activation of both caspase-9 and
  caspase-3, -6 and -7 (4). →indicates activation, ⊥ indicates inhibition.
