caption: Personalized treatment options and associated outcomes in a precision cohort
  using a Sankey diagram. (1) The initial node (black) represents all decision points
  in the precision cohort for the individual patient of interest who has an HTN diagnosis,
  is over age 65, and is on Lisinopril (ACEI). (2) Each pathway leaving the initial
  node is a different treatment decision that is observed in the data. The thickness
  of the edge is proportional to the number of decision points. The label contains
  the medication class and ingredient, the start or stop of the medication (“+” or
  “−” suffix), and the percentage (in parentheses) of decision points under control
  in the follow-up. The “no change” or “stay the current course” treatment option
  is shown in gray and is considered the “baseline” treatment option. (3) The terminal
  nodes represent the outcome for the disease condition under control (green) and
  not under control (red). (4) Treatment options associated with better control than
  the baseline are shown as green pathways above the baseline with dark green indicating
  statistical significance. (5) Treatment options associated with worse control than
  the baseline are shown as red pathways below the baseline with dark red indicating
  statistical significance.
