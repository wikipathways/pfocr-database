caption: Antagonists of TLRs signaling pathways. Many antagonists have been developed
  against TLRs. Phloretin is an inhibitor of TLR2/1, OPN-305 and AP177 block TLR2
  signaling. C16H15NO4 inhibits the TLR2/1 and TLR2/6 signaling pathway. TAK-242 and
  NI 0101 disrupt the interactions of TLR4 with its adaptor molecules TIR domain-containing
  adaptor protein(TIRAP). IMO-8503, CPG-52364, IMO-8503, IMO−8400, IMO−3100 and IRS
  661 are the antagonists of TLR7, 8, 9. TAC5 effectively inhibits TLR3, TLR7, TLR8
  and TLR9 signaling pathways to prevent the production of inflammatory factors. ST2825
  and RDP58 inhibit myeloid differentiation primary response 88(MyD88)dimerization,
  interfering with recruitment downstream molecules. PF-06650833, BAY1834845, BAY1830839,
  CA-4948 and MBS-986126 are antagonists of IRAK4 and effectively block its follow-up
  effect. HS-243 exquisite selectively inhibits IRAK-1/4. ML120B, PS-1145 and PHA-408
  are the inhibitors of IKK-β. MG132 and BAY117082 inhibit nuclear factor-kappa B
  (NF-κB) so that inflammatory response cannot be activated.
