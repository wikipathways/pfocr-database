caption: 'WNT/beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway in CRC and identified inhibitors.
  When WNT proteins are sequestered by WNT inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1), the member
  of the frizzled (FZD) family of atypical G protein-coupled receptors is inhibited
  by a secreted frizzled-related protein (SFRP) and the co-receptor lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein (LPR) 5 or 6 is bound to Dickkopf (DKK); WNT signaling is therefore off.
  As a consequence, the receptor complex is not formed and the destruction complex
  is assembled in the cytoplasm, where APC and AXIN serve as a scaffold to recruit
  CK1 and GSK3B, both of which phosphorylate beta-catenin, thus targeting it for BTRC-mediated
  ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. In the nucleus, TCF/LEF
  transcription factor sits on the promoter of WNT-regulated genes where, via binding
  a member of the Groucho/TLE family of transcription repressors or CtBP, it recruits
  HDAC to repress transcription of the downstream genes. The signaling starts when
  WNT is freed and can bind a member of FZD family LPR5/6, thus forming the receptor
  complex which, via the binding of the adaptor protein Disheveled (DVL), recruits
  to the membrane the destruction complex, disrupting it. Tankyrases (TNKSs,) by poly-ADP-ribosylating
  AXIN, prime it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation.
  Alternatively, AXIN can sequester GSK3B away from the complex; in both ways beta-catenin
  is released from the destruction complex and translocates to the nucleus, where
  it displaces transcription repressors and complexes with TCF/LEF to recruit several
  transcriptional coactivators (Pygo, BCL9) and histone modifiers (such as TRRAP,
  PAF1, BRG1, etc.) in order to promote the transcription of the downstream target
  genes. In the red and green boxes, chemical and re-purposed drugs are identified
  in the screens described in the text. CGP049090, KF 115-584, ICG-001, LF3: compounds
  identified as able to displace the interaction of beta-catenin with TCF/LEF transcription
  factors or recruited coactivators; XAV939: TNKSs inhibitor; IWR compounds, 1–5,
