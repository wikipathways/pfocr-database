caption: 'Multiple accessary pathways of glucose metabolism result in the production
  of metabolites that do not directly contribute to energy supply but are of important
  biological function. Evidence has suggested that these pathways are altered in the
  hypertrophied, failing, ischemic, and/or diabetic heart as indicated. Glycolysis:
  G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; F1,6BP, fructose 1,6-biphosphate;
  G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP): G6PD, glucose
  6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6-PGL, 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone; NADPH, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate; 6-PG, 6-phosphogluconate; Ribulose 5-P, ribulose
  5-phosphate; X5P, xylulose 5-phosphate, R5P, ribose 5-phosphate. Polyol Pathway:
  AR, aldose reductase. Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP): GFAT, glutamine fructose
  6-phosphate amidotransferase; Glucosamine 6-P, glucosamine 6-phosphate; UDPGlcNAc,
  uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine; OGT, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase.'
