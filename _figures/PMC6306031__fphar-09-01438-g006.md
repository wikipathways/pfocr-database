caption: Schematic diagram of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of bicyclol. Bicyclol
  reverses the HCV-disturbed mitochondrial transmembrane potential, without altering
  the expressions and activities of NADPH oxidase and superoxide dismutases, decreases
  the cellular ROS levels, and inhibits the subsequent MAPK and NF-κB activation.
  The overall anti-inflammation and hepatoprotection effects of bicyclol are characterized
  by the decreased inflammatory cytokine production and the mitochondrial cytochrome
  c release to the cytosol and/or the ALT/AST release into the extracellular matrix.
  The dotted line shows the potential mechanism not verified in our study.
