caption: Overview of the hedgehog signaling pathway in active (left) and inactive
  (right) states. The two compounds used for comparison are denoted next to the pathway
  component of inhibition (vismodegib and GANT-61)—the binding of hedgehog, Hh, ligands
  to PTCH1 results in the release of Gli transcription factors. The overactivation
  of this pathway underlies BCC oncogenesis and tumor growth
