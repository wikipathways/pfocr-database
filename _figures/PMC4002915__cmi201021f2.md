caption: 'Signal pathways of IL-17. The IL-17R complex is composed of two IL-17RA
  and one IL-17RC; both subunits encode SEFIR domains. After activation, the intracellular
  IL-17 signaling includes ACT1-dependent and -independent downstream pathways. Left:
  the ACT1-dependent pathway: IL-17RA engages its SEFIR domain to recruit the adaptor
  protein ACT1. ACT1 contains a TRAF6-binding motif and can bind TRAF6, TRAF3 and
  TAK1, which subsequently leads to activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway. ACT1
  is also required for the activation of MAPK p38, and this pathway leads to the stabilization
  of mRNAs, particularly those encoding chemokines and cytokines. Right: the ACT1-independent
  pathway involves JAK1 and PI3K, followed by subsequent inactivation of GSK-3β. Both
  ACT1-dependent and -independent pathways contribute to the activation of transcription
  factors C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ. ACT1, nuclear factor-κB activator 1; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding
  protein; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β JAK1, Janus kinase 1; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SEFIR,
  SEF/IL-17R; TAK1, TGF-β-activated kinase 1; TRAF6, tumor-necrosis factor receptor-associated
  factor 6.'
