caption: 'Main mechanisms involved in the development of HCC. A: chronic alcohol consumption
  increases the production of its main toxic metabolite acetaldehyde, favoring mitochondrial
  dysfunction and oxidative stress perpetuating liver injury. In the long run, this
  will generate a decreased function of TJ and AJ, interfering with the protective
  barrier of the intestine, developing a leaky gut. B: we can see how the bacterial
  overgrowth and translocation of its metabolites to the liver will increase liver
  injury and the recognition of PAMPs by specific TLRs such as TLR-4 binding with
  its ligand MYD88 and with the final activation of NF-κβ pathway with important repercussion
  for systemic inflammation and HCC development. ADH: alcohol dehydrogenase; MEOS:
