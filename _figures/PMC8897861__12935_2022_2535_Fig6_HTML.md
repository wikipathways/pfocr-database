caption: Proposed schematic representation for the molecular mechanism of DAB2IP-inducedregulation
  of radiosensitivity in ESCC cells. In ESCC cells with low or no expression of DAB2IP,
  IR causes increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading
  to the dephosphorylation of Ser-966 of ASK1, which consequently triggers dissociation
  of Trx and 14-3-3 from ASK1, ultimately resulting in a basic activated status of
  the ASK1-JNK pathway and causing ESCC cells to exhibit low sensitivity/or resistance
  to radiotherapy. In ESCC cells with normal or overexpression of DAB2IP, the IR-induced
  ROS stimulates dephosphorylation of Ser-966 of ASK1, thereby releasing of 14-3-3
  and Trx from ASK1. This step is necessary but not sufficient for ASK1-enhanced activation.
  After 14-3-3 and Trx are released from ASK1, DAB2IP preferentially binds to the
  locus surrounding the Ser966-dephosphorylated site of ASK1, which consequently facilitates
  dissociation of 14-3-3 from ASK1 and enhances ASK1 kinase activity, ultimately leading
  to an over-activation of ASK1-JNK signaling and ESCC cells with high sensitivity
  to radiotherapy
