caption: GH transcription and somatotroph proliferation are induced by cAMP acting
  through CREB (). SRIF inhibits cAMP and CREB activity (S43) to suppress GH secretion.
  Pituitary CDKs likely exhibit overlapping functions in G1 cell-cycle progression.
  Somatotroph mitogenic factors include POU1F1, GHRH, and GNAS as well as endocrine
  hormones. Mitogenic constraints include SRIF and tumor suppressor genes, including
  MEN1. Cell-cycle progression through G/S is mediated by CDKs that phosphorylate
  Rb to release E2F proteins that drive DNA synthesis. In somatotroph tumors, the
  cAMP pathway may be constitutively activated. Furthermore, HMGA2 and PTTG, overexpression,
  and CDK inhibitor loss have been shown to result in experimental pituitary tumorigenesis.
  Chromosomal instability, DNA damage, and senescence, hallmarks of GH-secreting adenomas,
  may act to constrain malignant transformation of somatotroph tumors. Modified with
