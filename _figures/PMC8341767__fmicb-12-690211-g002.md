caption: Reorganized biosynthetic pathway of glycosphingolipid in filamentous fungi.
  The first part (I) involves two key enzyme-catalyzed reactions and is the starting
  point and common to neutral and acidic GSL synthesis. The second part (II) represents
  the biosynthetic pathway of neutral GSLs (GlcCer and GalCer) from DhSph including
  four enzyme-catalyzed reactions. GlcCer and GalCer are the final products of neutral
  GSL pathway in filamentous fungi. The third part (III) is the biosynthetic process
  of acidic GSLs, including the production of IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C, which also starts
  from DhSph and includes three enzyme-catalyzed reactions. IPCs, used as building
  blocks for more complex molecules, are further modified upon addition of mannose
  and a second inositol phosphate group to generate MIPC and M(IP)2C. Red texts represent
  genes or relative enzymes involved in the GSL pathway. Blue texts indicate the inhibitors
  of the specific enzyme in the biosynthetic steps.
