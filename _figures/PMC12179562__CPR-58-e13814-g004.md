caption: Signal promoting VM formation. Under hypoxic conditions, MMPs‐2 and MMPs‐9
  are highly expressed. MMPs can degrade various protein components in the ECM, leading
  to the release of growth factors and cytokines embedded in the ECM. These released
  factors may bind to receptors of surrounding tumour cells, thereby activating the
  PI3K/Akt signalling pathway and promoting VM formation. In addition, EphA2 can activate
  PI3K and promote the generation of MMP‐9 and VEGF. And under the action of EphA2,
  pre‐MMP14 can be converted to MMP‐14. In addition, in the human cancer triple negative
  cell line mda‐mb‐231, brucine may inhibit VM by downregulating matrix metalloproteinase‐2
  and metalloproteinase‐9. (By Figdraw.)
