caption: 'MLYCD suppression is predicted to divert the accumulated malonyl-CoA to
  fatty acid biosynthesis, increasing the demand of cells for reducing power. The
  latter is generated by the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, overall
  leading to increased oxidative stress. Green/red arrows represent increased/decreased
  flux, respectively.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03641.015'
