caption: lncRNAs involved in the IFN antiviral response. Viral DNAs or RNAs are recognized
  by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as retinoid acid inducible gene I
  (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and cyclic guanosine-monophosphate
  adenosine-monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS). Subsequently, adaptor proteins,
  such as mitochondrial activator of virus signaling (MAVS), Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing
  adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88),
  and stimulator of IFN genes (STING), are activated, leading to the activation of
  interferon response factors (IRF) 3/7 or NF-κB. Phosphorylated dimers of IRF3/7
  or NF-κB then translocate to the nucleus, bind to the promoters of target genes,
  and trigger the expression of IFNs. IFNs exerts their antiviral effects by binding
  to their corresponding receptors, and signaling through Janus kinase (JAK)-signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway to induce the expression
  of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which can function as antiviral effectors, positive
  regulators or negative regulators of the IFN pathway. Some host lncRNAs (red color)
  and viral lncRNAs (blue color) can modulate the activities of transcription factors,
  or the expression of ISGs, and thus impact on the IFN antiviral response.
