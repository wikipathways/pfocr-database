caption: The mechanisms of macrophage-mediated resistance to chemotherapy.The pathways
  responsible for the tumor-promoting function of TAMs after chemotherapy and chemoresistance
  include the increased recruitment of immunosuppressive TAMs, the pro-tumor polarization,
  the reduced T-cell cytotoxic response, the activation of anti-apoptotic programs
  in malignant cells. a. TAMs which contribute to tumor resistance to doxorubicin
  have high expression of CD68, CD206, CD163, PD-L1, but low expression of CD80 and
  CD86. Moreover, TAMs release immunosuppressive cytokines (IL10 and TGFβ), factors
  which promote invasion (MMP9, MMP13), pro-angiogenic factor VEGF which cause revascularization.
  Increased expression of PDL1 in TAMs limits tumor response to chemotherapy by suppression
  the antitumor functions of cytotoxic T cells resulting in tumor cell survival and
  proliferation, and chemoresistance. b. TAM-mediated resistance to carboplatin is
  associated with STAT3 signaling and macrophage-produced IL6 promoting tumor cell
  growth. TAM exosomes are involved in cisplatin resistance via the activation of
  the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in tumor cells. c. Chemoresistance to gemcitabine
  is mediated by decreasing the activation of caspase-3 and reducing the apoptosis
  in tumor cells. d. Cathepsin proteases (cathepsin B and S) secreted by TAMs mediate
  chemoprotection through NF-κβ activation, or indirectly through IL-6 expression
  and STAT3 activation. There are unknown mechanisms of chemotherapy influence on
  macrophages.
