caption: PINK1-Parkin signalling. Under healthy conditions, PINK1 is imported to the
  mitochondria via a multisubunit complex, including TOM40 on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane (OMM) and TIM23 in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Upon entry,
  PINK1 is sequentially cleaved by proteases MPP and PARL between residues 103 and
  104. The resulting C-terminal fragment is rapidly degraded via the N-end rule pathway
  (inset A). Upon mitochondrial depolarization (e.g. induced by uncouplers), mitochondrial
  import and cleavage by PARL is inhibited, resulting in PINK1 stabilization and accumulation
  at the OMM, which in turn leads to PINK1 autophosphorylation and activation (inset
  B). Parkin exists in an inactive state mediated by multiple autoinhibitory surface
  interactions. Upon activation, PINK1 phosphorylates Parkin at Ser65 within its Ubl
  domain and ubiquitin at Ser65. Phosphorylation of Parkin Ubl Ser65 and binding of
  ubiquitin Ser65 confers maximal activation of Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.
  Multiple Parkin substrates have been identified, implicating its role in distinct
  mitochondrial signalling processes, although only a few substrates have been characterized
  in detail. Parkin-dependent ubiquitylated OMM substrates interact with ubiquitin
  binding domain-containing proteins (UBD) e.g. p62 that stimulate recruitment of
  autophagy machinery to induce mitophagy. Targeting of mitochondrial GTPases Miro1
  and Mfn1/2 may influence mitochondrial transport and dynamics, respectively. The
  negative regulators of this pathway remain largely unknown, although recent work
  has suggested roles for USP15 and USP30 as deubiquitylases.
