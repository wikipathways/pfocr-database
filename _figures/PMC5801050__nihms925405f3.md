caption: (A) Various differentiation programs are initiated by the ubiquitylation
  and degradation of transcriptions factors that are targeted by the indicated CUL3-based
  ubiquitin ligases. Myogenic differentiation is initiated by CRL3KLHL40 mediated
  degradation of DP1, neurogenic differentiation by the CRL3BTBD6A dependent ubiquitylation
  of PLZF, osteoblast differentiation by CRL3KEAP1 mediated degradation of NRF2 and
  of adipogenic differentiation by the CRL3KEAP1 ubiquitylation of CHOP and its subsequent
  degradation by the 26S proteasome.(B) The commitment and differentiation of MSCs
  towards a myogenic, neurogenic, osteogenic or adipogenic cell fate depend on a variety
  of signaling and transcription factor pathways controlled by CUL3-based ubiquitin
  ligases. Indian Hedgehog (IHH) pathway is essential for bone development. It regulates
  gene expression necessary for chondrogenesis and osteogenesis via the GLI family
  of transcription factors. GLI3R is a repressor of IHH signaling, which is ubiquitylated
  by CRL3SPOP and subsequently degraded by the 26S proteasome. WNT signaling plays
  an essential role in cell fate determination, proliferation, and differentiation.
  CRL3KLHL12 mediated degradation of DSH blocks the WNT pathway inhibiting osteogenesis.
  Retinoic acid (RA) influences cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis
  via expression of specific target genes. The transcription of target genes is a
  complex process requiring RA, nuclear receptors (RARs) as well as several coregulators
  such as SRC-3. In response to RA, SRC-3 is degraded in a CRL3SPOP dependent manner.
