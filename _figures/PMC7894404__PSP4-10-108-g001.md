caption: Dapagliflozin metabolism and disposition pathway based on ADME studies using
  oral and intravenous 14C‐dapagliflozin. A mass balance ADME study using six healthy
  subjects who received a single oral 10‐mg dapagliflozin dose and an 80 μg [14C]‐dapagliflozin
  intravenous dose containing 200 nCi radioactivity was conducted. This study showed
  that only ~ 16% of unchanged drug was recovered in feces and 2% of the dose was
  excreted in urine as unchanged dapagliflozin; enzymes metabolized the remaining
  drug, and the metabolites were excreted in feces and urine. *Predicted based on
  dapagliflozin PBPK model 10‐mg oral dose simulations. ADME, absorption, distribution,
  metabolism, and excretion; CLiv,p, intravenous plasma clearance; CLR, renal clearance;
  CYP, cytochrome P450; Fg, fraction escaping gut metabolism; fabs, fraction absorbed;
  fm, fractions metabolized; PBPK, physiologically based pharmacokinetics; PO, per
  oral; UGT, uridine diphosphate‐glucuronosyltransferase.
