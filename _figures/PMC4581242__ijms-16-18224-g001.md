caption: The UPRmt models in mammalians. Two major independent models of UPRmt have
  been described. When unfolded proteins accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix, they
  are first cleaved by ClpP proteases. Peptides exit mitochondria by unknown mechanisms
  and trigger a signaling pathway, leading to the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) and PKR, which phosphorylate as c-Jun (part of AP-1 transcription factor)
  and eIF2α, respectively. The phosphorylation of eIF2α can also be mediated by GCN2
  in response to mitochondrial translation inhibition (not illustrated), and it turns
  on the integrated stress response (see ). PKR could also activate JNK. The activation
  of c-Jun triggers CHOP-10 expression. In turn, the transcription factor regulates
  the expression of stress-resolving genes such as mitochondrial proteases and chaperones
  (left side of the chart). When unfolded proteins accumulate in the inter-membrane
  space, the UPRmt is mediated by the activation of ERα, triggered by an AKT-dependent
  phosphorylation. The activation of AKT would then be mediated by oxidative stress,
  as inhibited by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Mitochondrial stress resolves by an increase
  in the expression of HTRA2/Omi protease and enhanced proteasome activity, while
  the biogenesis of mitochondria is enhanced and under the control of NRF1, a target
  gene of ERα. The highlighted acronyms represent genes for which an endogenous differential
  expression (RT-qPCR or Western blot analysis) in response to UPRmt has been experimentally
  demonstrated to be dependent on CHOP-10; this is in addition to analysis using reporter
  constructs. The non-highlighted genes refer to genes controlled by CHOP-10 in response
  to a UPRmt, but only demonstrated using reporter constructs.
