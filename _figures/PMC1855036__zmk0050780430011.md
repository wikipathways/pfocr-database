caption: Working model for the caveolin-dependent trafficking of M1 muscarinic receptor.
  M1 mAChR in its biosynthetic pathway arrives at the TGN where it is believed to
  oligomerize in a caveolin-dependent manner. After its exit from the TGN, the receptor
  arrives at the Rab11-positive common endosome and is delivered to the PM in proximity
  to the tight junction. A fraction of the M1 mAChR that is concentrated in this area
  is bound to caveolin 2, most likely in an oligomeric form. In the presence of caveolin
  1, however, caveolin 1 associates with caveolin 2, which in turn releases M1 mAChR,
  enabling the latter's endocytosis through the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery.
  The receptor is delivered to the BL early endosome (Rab5) where it can either recycle
  back through the “short pathway” and be delivered to the common endosome and then
  back to the BL PM or take the “long pathway”, to be delivered to the late endosome
  (Rab7 and 9), from which it will utilize the Rab9-dependent pathway and be delivered
  to the TGN. From the TGN, the receptor will follow a route similar to that of the
  proteins in the biosynthetic pathway. Alternatively, at the late endosome, the receptor
  destined for degradation will follow the Rab7 pathway and be delivered to the lysosome.
