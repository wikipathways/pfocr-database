caption: 'Pathways of penile erection: Dilation of cavernosal arteries and smooth
  muscle cells (SMCs) of cavernosal spaces is mediated by the nitric oxide (NO)–cyclic
  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway. NO is derived from nonadrenergic, noncholinergic
  nerves (nNOS, NOS type I), and the endothelium (eNOS or NOS type III) of cavernosal
  sinuses (both calcium2+/calmodulin-dependent isoforms). NO crosses plasma membranes
  to enter vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and promotes the synthesis and accumulation
  of cGMP, which induces a cascade reaction, leading to smooth muscle relaxation by
  reducing intracellular calcium level. NNOS = neuronal nitric oxide. ENOS = endothelial
  nitric oxide. See the text for details.'
