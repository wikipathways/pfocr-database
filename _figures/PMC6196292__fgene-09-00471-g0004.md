caption: 'The proposed mechanisms of NEAT1 action in cancer. The diagram illustrates
  signaling events upstream and downstream of NEAT1 in cancer. The EGFR-STAT3/NF-κB
  signaling pathway is a critical triggering mechanism upstream of NEAT1, which inhibits
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, but promotes migration, invasion, metastasis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition, stem cell-like phenotype, chemoresistance and radioresistance, through
  at least three major mechanisms: (i) NEAT1 functions as a scaffold RNA molecule
  by interacting with EZH2 (a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex) to influence
  the expression of downstream effectors of EZH2, (ii) NEAT1 acts as a miRNA sponge
  to antagonize the interactions between multiple tumor suppressor miRNAs and target
  mRNAs, and (iii) NEAT1 suppresses the expression of miR-129 by promoting the DNA
  methylation of the miR-129 promoter.'
