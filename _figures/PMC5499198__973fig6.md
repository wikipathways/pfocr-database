caption: 'Hypotheses for Idgf function in DA morphogenesis. (A) Alternative signaling
  pathways downstream of Bwk transcriptional targets. A signal from the nurse cells
  to the stretch cells may regulate Idgf levels via Shark and Src42. Alternatively,
  Bwk may regulate levels of Idgfs through a pathway that is independent of Shark
  and Src42A. (B) Hypothesis 1: Idgfs are secreted from the stretch cells (green)
  and signal through a receptor in the tube-forming cells (blue and magenta), polarizing
  the tube-forming cells and guiding tube elongation. (C) Hypothesis 2: Idgfs are
  secreted into the extracellular matrix to regulate tube morphogenesis and cell migration
  through cell adhesion and signaling. (D) Hypothesis 3: Stretch cells secrete Idgfs
  and receive an autocrine signal that influences stretch cell tensile properties
  and adhesion to provide an optimal substrate for DA-cell migration. Bwk, Bullwinkle;
  DA, dorsal appendage; ECM, extracellular matrix; Idgf, Imaginal disc growth factor.'
