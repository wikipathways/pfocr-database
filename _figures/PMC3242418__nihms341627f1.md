caption: The HER network, recently described in systems biology terms, is a robust
  redundant network comprised of an input layer of 4 membrane (M) tyrosine kinase
  (TK) receptors (HER1/EGFR-HER4) and multiple ligands [e.g., EGF, TGFα, amphiregulin
  (AR), and heregulins (HRG)]; a signal core processing layer involving a series of
  phosphorylation (e.g., activation of the PI3K/AKT, RAS/MEK/MAPK, and STATs kinase
  cascades) that transmit signals from the receptor layer to the output layer; and
  an output layer of transcription and coregulator factors (TF, CoReg) that function
  in the nucleus (N) to alter expression of genes regulating tumor cell proliferation,
  survival, and other characteristics of the malignant phenotype (, ). Upon ligand
  binding, the receptors undergo conformational changes that allow their homo- and
  heterodimerization and transphosphorylation, following by the activation of a plethora
  of downstream signaling cascades. HER2, which is gene-amplified and/or overexpressed
  in 20% of breast cancers, does not have a ligand, but exists in an open conformation
  exposing its dimerization domain; it can be activated by hetrodimerization with
  other ligand-bound HER members or by homodimerization when it is overexpressed.
  HER3 lacks the TK activity (X). Several drugs have been developed to block the HER2
  pathway, most aimed at the receptor level. The HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab
  is FDA-approved in both the metastatic and the adjuvant settings and the dual HER1–HER2
  small molecule TK inhibitor lapatinib is FDA-approved in metastatic HER2+ breast
  cancers.
