caption: Activation and regulation of BMP/Smad-dependent signalling. BMP ligands bind
  to and activate type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors (BMPR-I and BMPR-II,
  respectively), which triggers phosphorylation of the R-Smad1/5/8. Phosphorylated
  R-Smads form a heteromeric complex with the co-Smad 4, enabling its subsequent translocation
  to the nucleus where it binds to specific GC rich sequences within the promoters
  of several target genes in concert with various DNA binding co-factors. This cascade
  is tightly regulated, through pseudo-receptors such as BAMBI, which quench BMP ligands
  thereby limiting their availability to interact with their receptors. Extracellular
  regulation occurs via direct interaction of BMPs with their secreted antagonists,
  thereby preventing ligand receptor interaction. Intracellularly, this pathway is
  regulated by the I-Smads, Smad6 and 7. Smad6 prevents the formation of R-Smad and
  co-Smad complex formation. Smad7 regulates this pathway by forming a complex with
  Smurf1/2 and competing with R-Smad for type I receptor-mediated activation effectively
  antagonizing BMP/Smad pathway activation. This pathway is also regulated by phosphatases
  such as PP1, which dephosphorylates the BMP type I receptor, and PPM1A, which dephosphorylates
  R-Smads. R-Smad, receptor regulated Smads; I-Smad, inhibitory Smads; co-Smad, co-mediator
  Smad; ID, inhibitor of differentiation; PAI1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1;
  PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PPM1A, metal ion-dependent protein phosphatases 1A;
  DBC, DNA binding co-factors; PM, plasma membrane.
