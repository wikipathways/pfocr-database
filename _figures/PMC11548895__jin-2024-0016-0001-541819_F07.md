caption: TLR2 and NLRP3 play regulatory roles in E. coli infection-induced inflammatory
  response and sepsis. During E. coli infection, the TLR2 and NLRP3 maintain a balanced
  expression of inflammatory mediators through the MAPK signaling pathway, preventing
  excessive tissue damage and regulating mouse mortality. Furthermore, TLR2 and NLRP3
  also influence the recruitment of immune cells and enhance bactericidal activity.
  The red arrows indicate upregulation, and the blue arrows indicate regulatory effect
