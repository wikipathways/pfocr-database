caption: 'Schematic summary of the effects of PEVs on the MV3 and A2058 spheroids.
  CRP and FFV PEVs promote melanoma cancer hallmark properties by increasing proliferation,
  invasion, EV production, and they modulate the PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways.
  Specifically, CRP and FFV PEVs upregulate the TGF-β and IFN-I signaling pathways
  in the MV3 spheroids, respectively. Each PEV type is indicated by a color (CRP:
  green, FFV: purple, TC: pink, Ca2+: brown). * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001,
  **** = p < 0.0001, Δ: the PEVs that were used only in functional assays in the A2058
  spheroids'
