caption: 'Mms2-Ubc13-dependent and -independent roles of Rad5 in lesion bypass. (Left)
  Rad5 functions in PRR as a ubiquitin (Ub) ligase in conjunction with Mms2-Ubc13.
  As a ubiquitin ligase, Rad5 promotes the polyubiquitylation of PCNA at lysine 164
  by binding PCNA as well as the Mms-Ubc13 complex and thereby activating the PRR
  pathway. Also shown is the requirement of Rad5 ATPase in PRR. (Right) Rad5 function
  in TLS does not depend upon Mms2-Ubc13. Rad5 is proposed to modulate TLS in two
  separate ways: one dependent upon its ubiquitin ligase function and the other independent
  of it. As a ubiquitin ligase, Rad5 could affect Rad6-Rad18-dependent ubiquitylation
  of TLS Pols; in addition, by binding to both the inserter and the extender Pols,
  Rad5 could coordinate the action of the two Pols via a direct structural involvement.'
