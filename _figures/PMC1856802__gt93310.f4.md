caption: Schematic representation of the sequence of the mutational events affecting
  the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) locus and leading to the development of colorectal
  adenomas. The colour code is the same as in fig 3. The scheme explains that in most
  cases, the combination of the two consecutive mutational events affecting the APC
  locus is not random and only permissive for the development of an adenoma when all
  SAMP repeats (red) have been removed, but at least one 20‐amino‐acid repeat (green)
  has been kept in the resulting structures. Any other combination is unlikely to
  provoke the emergence of an adenoma. Truncations result from mutations provoking
  premature termination of the open reading frame.
