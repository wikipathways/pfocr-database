caption: 'Visual summary of the main findings of the study. Human iPSCs were generated
  from dermal fibroblasts using 4 reprogramming factors (Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc
  = OKSM). Activation at day 2: WNT/β-catenin pathway activity (intermediate concentration
  of CHIR = Mid WNT) induced an increase in NODAL and LEFTY1 gene expression. In this
  condition, high levels of bipotent mesendoderm progenitors (T+/FOXA2+ cells) were
  generated. Supplementation with Activin A resulted in hiPSCs commitment toward endoderm
  lineage (T-/FOXA2+ progenitor cells). High WNT pathway activation (high concentration
  of CHIR = High WNT) resulted in hiPSCs commitment toward mesoderm lineage (T+/FOXA2-
  progenitor cells). Differentiation from day 3: Mesendoderm progenitors transfected
  with synthetic mRNAs encoding human NOTO transcription factor and sustained with
  Mid WNT signalling activation generated axial mesoderm progenitors (T+/FOXA2+ cells).
  Stabilization up to day 7: NOTO transfection and Mid WNT signalling activation increased
  both SHH and FGF signalling pathway activities in axial mesoderm progenitors, which
  further differentiated into stable notochord-like cell population (NLC) at day 7
  (T+/FOXA2+ cells and T+/SOX9+ cells). Human iPSC-derived NLC expressed embryonic
  notochord-related markers. Blue arrows indicate optimal culture condition for notochordal
  differentiation. Sets of gene markers relative to lineages or specific cell-types
  are indicated.'
