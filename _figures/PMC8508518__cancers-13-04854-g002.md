caption: Schematic illustration of different ways of STAT activation and negative
  regulation. (A) STATs are activated by phosphorylation. In the canonical JAK/STAT
  pathway, extracellular binding of cytokines or hormones to cytokine receptors activates
  receptor-associated JAKs, which then phosphorylate STATs. Non-canonical signaling
  includes growth hormone receptors, like the EGF-receptor, which can phosphorylate
  STATs directly. Furthermore, viral oncoproteins, like v-src, activate STAT constitutively.
  Phosphorylated STATs form homo- or heterodimers and translocate to the nucleus.
  They regulate gene expression by binding to IRSE or GAS in the promoter region of
  their target genes. (B) Negative regulation of JAK/STAT pathway includes inhibition
  of JAK proteins by SOCS1, whereas SOCS3 binds to JAK-proximal sites on transmembrane
  receptors and inhibits binding of STATs to receptors. PIAS binds to STAT dimers
  in the nucleus, thereby inhibiting their transcriptional activity. (Created with
