caption: Modulation of signaling pathways and inflammatory mediators by erinacines
  and hericenones produced by Hericium erinaceum. (A) NF-κB signaling pathway, where
  bioactive compounds produced by H. erinaceus inhibit the phosphorylation of IκBα,
  preventing NF-κB activation, which leads to the increased production of cytokines
  such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, and nuclear translocation. (B) H. erinaceus also
  acts in the inhibition of COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide
  synthase), where hericenones inhibit COX-2, reducing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis,
  and suppress iNOS expression, leading to reduced nitric oxide (NO) production. (C)
  H. erinaceus contributes to anti-inflammatory effects by activating the Nrf2 (nuclear
  factor erythroid 2–related factor 2) pathway, which enhances the expression of antioxidant
  enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)
