caption: Cap-dependent and elongation translational control by GNRH. Activated GNRH
  receptor leads to a rapid activation of the mTOR and ERK signaling cascades. mTOR
  reduces 4E binding protein (4EBP) activity by inhibitory phosphorylation, releasing
  the 5’ cap-binding protein EIF4E. EIF4E is also positively regulated by phosphorylation
  through the ERK/MNK1 pathway. Binding of EIF4 to the 5’ cap structure stimulates
  formation of the initiation complex and promotes ribosome binding and translation
  initiation. Translation elongation is also affected by mTOR through activating phosphorylation
  of the p70 ribosomal subunit S6 kinase (S6K) and by inhibitory phosphorylation of
  the Eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 Kinase (EEF2K), a suppressor of Elongation Factor
  2 (EEF2). Thus GNRH receptor promotes translation initiation and elongation through
  a combination of activating and inhibitory phosphorylation events that modulate
  exposure of mRNA to translational machinery through initiation and that modulate
  translation efficiency through regulation of elongation.

  description: Cap-dependent and elongation translational control by GNRH. Activated
    GNRH receptor leads to a rapid activation of the mTOR and ERK signaling cascades.
    mTOR reduces 4E binding protein (4EBP) activity by inhibitory phosphorylation,
    releasing the 5’ cap-binding protein EIF4E. EIF4E is also positively regulated
    by phosphorylation through the ERK/MNK1 pathway. Binding of EIF4 to the 5’ cap
    structure stimulates formation of the initiation complex and promotes ribosome
    binding and translation initiation. Translation elongation is also affected by

    (S6K) and by inhibitory phosphorylation of the Eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2
    Kinase (EEF2K), a suppressor of Elongation Factor 2 (EEF2). Thus GNRH receptor
    promotes translation initiation and elongation through a combination of activating
    and inhibitory phosphorylation events that modulate exposure of mRNA to translational
