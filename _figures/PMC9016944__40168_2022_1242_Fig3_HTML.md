caption: Characterized and proposed pathways of microbial taurine reduction to H2S.
  Pathway 1 — the canonical pathway of taurine reduction in Bilophila wadsworthia.
  Pathway 2 — putative 3-step reactions for taurine reduction analyzed in this study.
  Pathway 3 — the recently characterized pathway for taurine reduction in Bilophila
  wadsworthia. Pathway 4 — putative 4-step reactions for taurine reduction analyzed
  in this study. No complete pathways were found involving genes that are struck through.
  Genera possessing genes for each complete pathway are listed. Only genera listed
  were found to have complete pathways. Pie charts indicate the disease state associated
  with MAGs of each genus with the specified pathway with blue indicating healthy,
  yellow indicating adenoma, and maroon indicating carcinoma
