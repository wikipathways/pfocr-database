caption: Sec14 coordinates lipid metabolism with membrane trafficking. A lipid-regulated
  vesicle formation pathway is shown. This pathway features diacylglycerol (DAG) and
  PtdIns-4-P as pro-exocytotic lipids, and its activity is sensitive to flux through
  the DAG-consuming cytidine-diphosphate (CDP)-choline pathway. Sec14 senses flux
  by binding newly synthesized PtdCho and thereby becomes activated for initiating
  heterotypic exchange reactions at the expense of futile PtdIns homotypic exchange
  reactions. Sec14-mediated heterotypic exchange reactions stimulate PtdIns-4-phosphate
  production by PtdIns 4-OH kinase. Negative regulators of Sec14p-dependent vesicle
  budding pathways are highlighted in red -- including the proteins identified by
  loss-of-function ‘bypass Sec14p’ mutations (enzymes of the CDP-choline PtdCho biosynthetic
  pathway, the Sac1 PtdIns-4-phosphatase, the sterol and PtdIns-4-P binding protein
  Kes1p). Positive regulators of Sec14p-dependent vesicle biogenesis pathways are
  highlighted in blue. The two opposing pathways are regulated by Sec14-mediated heterotypic
  PtdCho/PtdIns exchange (purple).
