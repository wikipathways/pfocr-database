caption: a In normal cells, the secretion of TGFBI into the ECM leads to competition
  between TGFBI and latent TGFβ1 (ECM-sequestered) for the binding of αvβ3/5 integrins.
  TGFBI-αvβ3/5 binding activates the tumor suppressor PTEN (dotted arrow; uncharacterized
  mechanism), suppressing AKT activation. This binding also prevents excess conversion
  of latent TGFβ1 into active TGFβ1, thereby modulating endocytosis of active TGFβ1
  and its receptors, and maintaining homeostasis. b In NPC, miR-449b is overexpressed
  and downregulates TGFBI expression. Consequently, with less TGFBI in the ECM, this
  facilitates PTEN inhibition, as well as increased binding of latent TGFβ1 to αvβ3/5
  integrins (via its LAP domain), promoting the release of active TGFβ1. As more active
  TGFβ1 binds to its receptors, it becomes internalized, resulting in increased activation
  of both canonical and noncanonical TGFB signaling, as demonstrated by the EMT-like
  phenotype acquired by the cells, as well as activation of AKT; two features known
  to be involved in chemoresistance
