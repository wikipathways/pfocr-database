caption: The biosynthetic pathway for the fibrillar collagens expressed in skin, identifying
  steps that are affected in different forms of EDS. (I) Collagen gene transcription
  is highly regulated, but haploinsufficiency for COL5A1 is uncompensated and leads
  to a reduction in COL5A1 mRNA and α1(V) procollagen chains. This accounts for 30–50%
  of classical EDS cases. (II) Many proline and lysine residues in the translated
  procollagen chains are hydroxylated by lysyl- and proline hydroxylases. Hydroxylation
  is essential for subsequent crosslinking and lysyl-hydroxylase deficiency causes
  the kyphoscoliosis form of EDS. (III) Procollagen α-chains are assembled into trimers
  within the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Mutations in COL3A1 that interrupt
  the triple helical structure prevent normal processing and secretion of collagen
  III, causing the vascular form of EDS. (IV) In the ECM, the NH2- and COOH-terminal
  propeptides are cleaved by specific peptidases. Dominant mutations in COL1A1 and
  COL1A2 can prevent cleavage and cause arthrochalasia, while recessive loss of the
  N-procollagen peptidase cause dermatosparaxis. (V) Collagen molecules self-assemble
  into heterotypic fibrils. Dominant-negative mutations in COL5A1 and COL5A2 alter
  fibril assembly and cause some cases of classical EDS. (VI) Collagen fibrils are
  deposited in tissue-specific arrangements in close association with many fibril-associated
  proteins and proteoglycans. Because new fibrils are laid down in close association
  with the fibroblast cell membrane, interactions between the fibril and the cell
  are important and may involve direct interaction with collagens and/or matricellular
  proteins, including tenascin-X (TNX).
