caption: Metabolic pathways associated with TAM and MDSC pro-tumoral and myelosuppressive
  functions. The M1/M2 paradigm established from an in vitro macrophage culture system
  distinguishes two extreme macrophage metabolic phenotypes. (On the left), the metabolic
  pathways in orange are upregulated in M1 macrophages and those in green in M2 macrophages.
  M1 macrophages are highly glycolytic which is a consequence of HIF-1a stabilization
  in response to succinate accumulation due to breaks in the TCA cycle. Besides inducing
  the expression of glycolytic enzymes, HIF-1a also drives the production of pro-inflammatory
  factors such as IL-1b. In contrast, M2 macrophages favor glutamine consumption,
  upregulate the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), and rely on fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO) for their energetic needs. STAT6 downstream of IL-4 signaling and PPARg with
  its co-activator PGC1b are key for their differentiation. In contrast to this simplified
  system, the TME complexity results in a marked myeloid cell heterogeneity with M1/M2
  mixed profiles and divergent metabolic characteristics. (On the right), the cellular
  metabolic pathways upregulated in TAMs and MDSCs are illustrated. These cells are
  highly glycolytic but are dependent on glutamine and lipid consumption for their
  pro-tumoral functions. Despite their heightened aerobic glycolysis, they upregulate
  M2-like genes through the accumulation of acetyl coA, which is downstream of the
  AKT/mTOR-dependent activation of ATP Citrate Lyase (ACLY), and histone acetylation.
  Histone lactylation, which was reported to occur in M1 macrophages at later stages
  of activation and proposed as a mechanism to terminate the inflammatory response,
  might regulate TAM functions, but this remains to be tested. The heightened mitochondrial
  respiration in tumor-associated myeloid cells leads to the elevated production of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). To withhold oxidative stress, they activate the transcription
  factor NRF2, which induces the expression of anti-oxidative genes and of the cystine
  transporter xCT1, among others. Myeloid cells in the TME upregulate triglycerides
  (TG) uptake, for instance through fatty acid transport protein (FATP)2, as reported
  in granulocytic 18 MDSCs, lipid accumulation in vesicles, lipolysis and FAO. Consequently,
  they also produce inflammatory and immunosuppressive lipid mediators such as the
  prostaglandin PGE2. Furthermore, they metabolize arginine and tryptophan into metabolites
  that favor tumor growth, including L-ornithine and L-kynurenine (Kyn). The latter
  is a ligand of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which promotes myelosuppressive
  functions in the TME via transcriptional activity.
