caption: Schematic phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway comparing gene expression
  and metabolites content of C. japonicum. The gene expression is represented by the
  intensity of the blue or red color. The unit variance scaling data is represented
  by the intensity of the blue or red (gene expression) and green or red (metabolites
  content) color as the box at the bottom right. The gray boxes represent the metabolites
  that could not be detected. 4CL1, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase-like 6; 4CL2, 4-coumaroyl
  CoA ligase; 4CL3, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase-like 5; C3H, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase;
  C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase; COMT,
  caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; F3H, flavanone
  3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; FS II, flavone
  synthase II; HCT, shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; HQT, hydroxycinnamoyl
  CoA quinate transferase; and PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase.
