caption: Mechanisms underlying the sex-specific establishment of the Wolffian duct.
  In the XX embryo, COUP-TFII in the Wolffian duct (or WD) mesenchyme suppresses Fgf
  expression and in the absence of FGF signaling and the Wolffian duct epithelium
  degenerates. On the other hand, in the XY embryo, testis-derived androgens activate
  androgen receptor (AR) and initiate the survival program via mesenchymal–epithelial
  crosstalk. The activated AR induces expression of growth factor EGF (epidermal growth
  factors) or other unknown factors in the mesenchyme. EGF binds its receptor EGFR
  in Wolffian duct epithelium, which presumably actives p-ERK and ETV4/5-mediated
  survival pathway in the epithelium. Additional AR action in the mesenchyme somehow
  antagonizes COUP-TFII’s inhibition of Fgf. As a result, FGF production is enhanced,
  which may promote Wolffian duct survival via the FGFR2/p-ERK pathway. Although EGFR
  and FGFR1 are expressed in the mesenchyme, it remains unclear about specific effects
  of EGF and FGF on mesenchymal cells during AR promoted Wolffian duct maintenance.
