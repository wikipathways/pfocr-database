caption: At the top of the signalling pathway, the critical Arpp19 dephosphorylation
  at S109 by PP2A-B55δ. The G2 lock is achieved by high cAMP, high PKA activity and
  Arpp19 phosphorylation at S109. Arpp19 phosphorylation turns over due to PKA and
  PP2A-B55δ, with PP2A-B55δ being swamped by PKA. Upon PKA inhibition promoted by
  progesterone, Arpp19 is dephosphorylated at S109 by PP2A-B55δ and launches the signalling
  pathway that ends with Cdk1 activation. The targets of Arpp19 are still unknown.
  It could control the synthesis of new proteins required to activate Cdk1, such as
  Cyclin B1 or Mos
