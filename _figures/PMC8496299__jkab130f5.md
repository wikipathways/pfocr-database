caption: Simplified scheme of the pathways related to rice seed hull color as hypothesized
  in the present study. This figure summarizes the biological functions of BH4, Phr1,
  and IBF1 in rice seed hull color. BH4 encodes a tyrosine transporter () and Phr1
  encodes a polyphenol oxidase (). These genes are related to melanin biosynthesis
  pathway. IBF1 inhibits flavonoid biosynthesis as a suppressor (). Thick black arrows
  indicate biosynthesis pathways of pigments and thin black arrows indicate genes
  and proteins involved in their synthesis.
