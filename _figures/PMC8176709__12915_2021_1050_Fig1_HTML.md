caption: 'Neuronal circuits contributing to the acoustic startle response and PPI.
  The mammalian primary acoustic startle pathway (red pathway) consists of primary
  auditory neurons that activate cochlear root and cochlear nuclei (CN), which then
  relay the auditory information to the giant neurons of the caudal pontine reticular
  nucleus (PnC) in the brainstem. PnC giant neurons then directly activate cervical
  and spinal motor neurons (MNs). During PPI (dark blue pathway), acoustic prepulses
  are thought to inhibit startle via the activation of the inferior (IC), superior
  colliculi (SC), and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg). The PPI pathway
  is also under the influence (light blue pathway) of midbrain and cortico-limbic
  structures including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which activates the nucleus
  accumbens (NAcc) which in turn inhibits the ventral pallidum (VP). Together, these
  PPI structures form the cortico-striato-pallido-pontine (CSPP) network. Here, we
  propose that CeA-PnC excitatory synapses (dotted dark blue pathway within the dotted
  red rectangle) regulate PPI alongside the CSPP circuit. HPC: hippocampus; mPFC:
  medial prefrontal cortex; SN: substantia nigra; VTA: ventral tegmental area'
