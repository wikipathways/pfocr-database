caption: '(A): Pathway for the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate (THF) from 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  (5,10-CH2-THF) and its role in purine biosynthesis. This pathway is common to both
  strains. (B): Additional pathway for the conversion of 5,10-CH2-THF to THF active
  in the iLca12A_640 model. With the exception of the panthtothenate transporter,
  the reactions are found in both models. (A and B): Thick arrows indicate flux in
  both models. Double arrows represent flux in the iLca12A_640 model. The black ‘X’
  indicates a gene deletion identified by CONGA lethal in iLca334_548 but not iLca12A_640,
  and gray arrows indicate inactive reactions arising from the deletion. The dashed
  arrow represents two separate steps. Reactions and metabolites corresponding to
  the given E.C. numbers and metabolite identifiers are given in the Supporting Material.'
