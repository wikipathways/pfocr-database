caption: Adipocytes export fatty acids during times of energy deficit (involved pathways
  are marked with green arrows). The rise in cAMP, a sign of increased glucagon or
  adrenergic stimulation, and low insulin stimulate hydrolysis of triglycerides into
  glycerol and fatty acids. The increased cAMP pool activates PKA that, in turn, phosphorylates
  hormone‐sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipins to increase lipolysis. Glycerol and
  fatty acids are mostly exported into the circulation for systemic utilization. A
  proportion of fatty acids is re‐esterified within the adipocytes, while another
  part may, after activation to form acetyl‐CoA, enter the mitochondria for β‐oxidation
  through carnitine palmitoyl transferase‐1 (CPT‐1). This rate‐limiting enzyme is
  inhibited by malonyl‐CoA, an intermediate of de novo lipogenesis regulated by acetyl
  carboxylase (ACC). ACC prevents the oxidation of fatty acids when adipocytes are
  in a lipogenic state. Inhibition of ACC by AMPK relieves this inhibition for β‐oxidation.
  Under positive energy balance, insulin regulates glucose and fatty acid uptake in
  adipose tissue, and expression and activity of enzymes involved in their metabolism
  and deposition into TAG, that is, lipogenesis (marked by red arrows). In short,
  insulin through binding to its cell surface receptor stimulates tyrosine kinase
  activity, which phosphorylates key residues on several ‘docking proteins’, IRS proteins.
  Assembly of a stable complex leads to the regulation (in most cases, activation)
  of downstream signalling pathways. Recruited proteins include the p85 regulatory
  subunit of PI3‐kinase, which stimulates signalling pathways ultimately leading to
  PI3‐kinase‐dependent serine/threonine PKAkt/PKB activation. Phosphorylation of Akt1
  at two regulatory residues, Ser473 and Thr308, is critical for complete Akt/PKB
  activation in adipose tissue. Akt stimulates the translocation of the glucose transporter,
  GLUT4, to the plasma membrane, thereby promoting uptake of glucose into the cell.
  A high level of circulating insulin also stimulates PDE3B, promoting cAMP hydrolysis,
  lowering PKA activity and PKA‐dependent HSL phosphorylation, activation and lipolysis.
  Chronic insulin signalling enhances cAMP production through β‐adrenoceptor activation
  in adipocytes but also disrupts the signalling pathway between β‐adrenoceptors and
  PKA. Imported as well as de novo synthesized fatty acids from excess glucose combine
  with CoA, and after successive esterification, form TAG. The (re)‐esterification
  process requires production of glycerol‐3‐phosphate as a substrate for fatty acid
  re‐esterification into TAG. Glycerol‐3‐phosphate is mostly derived from glucose
  in the fed state (glycolytic intermediates). Because the glucose supply to the tissue
  is limited in the fasting state (lipolytic stimulation) and adipocytes have no significant
  glycerol kinase activity, glycerol‐3‐phosphate is acquired from lactate or pyruvate.
