caption: TGFβ is first captured by TGFβ receptor II (in brown) and TGFβ receptor I
  or Alk5 (in green) then to form a complex that may activate Smad proteins (left
  branch) or the Smad independent pathway (right branch). Canonically, SARA (Smad
  anchor for receptor activation) recruits R-Smad, allowing for its phosphorylation,
  which causes a conformational change that leads to R-Smad dissociation. Phosphorylated
  R-Smad forms a complex with Smad4, which consequently activates Smad2/3 proteins.
  Alternatively, the TGFβ-RII/TGFβ-RI tetrameric complex binds ShcA, which recruits
  Grb, that in turn, binds Sos. This complex activates Ras, leading to ERK activation.
  Abnormal levels of ITSN1 may shift the balance between SARA/Smad and ShcA/Grb2/Sos
  pathways. Since ITSN and Grb compete for Sos, reduced levels of ITSN1 result in
  an increased Sos availability for Grb and may favor the ShcA/Grb2/Sos pathway.
