caption: (A) Steroid biosynthesis pathway showing chemical conversion by CYP17A1,
  which is a bi-functional enzyme with hydroxylase and lyase activity that can be
  selectively inhibited by abiraterone and VT-464. The leydig cells in testis primarily
  synthesize testosterone, which is converted to potent androgen DHT in prostate.
  The adrenal gland produces androgen precursor, DHEA, which can also be converted
  to DHT in prostate. Prostate tumors also contain CYP17A1 and other key steroidogenic
  enzymes that can drive intratumoral de novo steroid biosynthesis. The CYP17A1 hydroxylase
  activity mediates adrenal biosynthesis of glucocorticoids, which can be selectively
  inhibited by abiraterone. In relevance to prostate cancer modeling in mice, it is
  important to note that in contrast to men, male mice do not produce the adrenal
  androgen precursor DHEA but produce testosterone by testis. (B) Chemical structures
  of the nonsteroidal metallophile VT-464 and the steroid-based abiraterone.
