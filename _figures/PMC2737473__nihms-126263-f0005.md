caption: Dopamine controls many brain functions, including roles in behavior and cognition,
  motor activity, motivation, and reward. Signaling mediated by D2 receptor is envisaged
  to control chromatin remodeling via modulation of various enzymatic functions. By
  using either the ERK transduction pathway or the alternative AKT/GSK-3 signaling
  system, dopamine could control kinases that phosphorylate H3, such as Rsk2 and MSK1,
  or the enzymatic function of HATs, such as CBP or CLOCK. The GSK-3 kinase is inhibited
  by lithium and thereby is implicated in the treatment of mood disorders. These regulatory
  pathways may integrate circadian control, dopamine signaling, and chromatin remodeling.
