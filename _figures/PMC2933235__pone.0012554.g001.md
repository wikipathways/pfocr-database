caption: ODC is a key enzyme of polyamine synthesis by catalyzing from L-ornithine
  to putrescine. OAZ is an inhibitory molecule of ODC activity by mediating degradation
  of ODC protein. SAM serves as a methyl donor in methylation reactions as well as
  precursor of dcSAM production. dcSAM is an aminopropyl donor of polyamine biosynthesis
  but it also acts as a competitive inhibitor of SAM virtually in all methylation
  reactions. Inhibition of ODC activity leads to polyamine depletion and dcSAM accumulation,
  which inhibits methylation reactions.
