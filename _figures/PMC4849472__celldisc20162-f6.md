caption: Schematic representation of the interconversion of complexes observed and
  the intermediates characterised. Starting with the (Hsp90)2(Hop)1(Hsp70)1 complex,
  introduction of the immunophilins (FKBP51/52) leads to parallel reaction pathways
  in which the immunophilins are interchangeable and not required for the formation
  of these early complexes. Similarly three corresponding client-transfer complexes
  are formed when a second copy of Hsp70 and the GR client enter the reaction cycle.
  Interesting differences are observed when p23 is added to the client-transfer complex
  in the absence of the immunophilin or with FKBP51, two copies of p23 are incorporated
  with concomitant loss of Hsp70 and Hop. By contrast no stable complex with two p23
  subunits is observed in the presence of FKBP52; expulsion of Hsp70, Hop and p23
  occur with a low population of a complex incorporating only one p23 subunit. This
  central pathway leads to formation of the productive nuclear transfer complex, which
  is highly dynamic and primed for interaction with dynactin.
