caption: The PKR recognizes and binds to double-stranded RNA molecules resulting in
  its auto-phosphorylation and the subsequent downstream phosphorylation of eIF2α.
  The phosphorylation of eIF2α switches off the host cell's translational machinery
  preventing viral protein translation A. RT3D prevents the phosphorylation of PKR
  leaving eIF2α in an un-phosphorylated state and the host cell's translational machinery
  intact B. RT combined with up-regulates CUG2 resulting in the activation of Ras
  and the downstream protein p38. The activation of this pathway switches off the
  PKR defence mechanism, allowing viral protein translation and increasing viral replication
  C. The increase in viral replication ultimately results in cell death via mitochondrial
  apoptotic signalling D.
