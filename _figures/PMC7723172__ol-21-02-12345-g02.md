caption: Effects and mechanisms of corosolic acid-induced anti-inflammatory and anti-MS
  activities. The characteristics of MS include ROS, IR and inflammation. (A) Corosolic
  acid downregulates IKKβ and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibits macrophage infiltration
  and inflammation, and upregulates LKB-1, IRS-1 and Akt, which ameliorates IR via
  enhancing. AMPK activation in a LKB1-dependent manner. (B) Corosolic acid downregulates
  the expression of MCP-1, NLRP3 and IL-1 via the NF-κB pathway, downregulates the
  expression of IRAK-1, and inhibits inflammation. (C) Corosolic acid prevents ROS
  in MS. IKKβ, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase; LKB-1, liver kinase B1;
  IRS, insulin receptor substrate-1; Akt, protein kinase B; IR, insulin resistance;
