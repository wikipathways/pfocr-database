caption: Mechanism diagram of bone formation and loss. Bone marrow-derived hematopoietic
  stem cells differentiate into monocytes or macrophages, which then differentiate
  into osteoclast precursor cells, then differentiate into osteoclasts and participate
  in bone loss. When estrogen levels are reduced or inflammatory factors are activated,
  the RANKL/RANK signaling pathway is activated, leading to increased osteoclast differentiation.
  The increased ROS levels or endoplasmic reticulum stress also leads to increased
  osteoclast differentiation. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells differentiate
  into osteoblast precursor cells, which then differentiate into osteoblasts and participate
  in bone formation. The Osteoblasts produce OPG, competitively bind RANKL and inhibit
  osteoclast differentiation, thereby reducing osteoclast production. Bone formation
  and bone loss are in dynamic balance to maintain bone integrity and normal bone
  structure and function. Bone formation and bone loss are in dynamic balance to maintain
  skeletal integrity, normal bone structure and function.
