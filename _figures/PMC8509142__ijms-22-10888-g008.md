caption: An illustrative summary of the humoral immune pathway positively regulated
  by TmSpz-like in Escherichia coli-infected Tenebrio molitor. Eleven antimicrobial
  peptide (AMP)-encoding genes were regulated by TmSpz-like, which indicated that
  TmSpz-like is required for the survival of the E. coli-infected host.
