caption: 'Biology of ICOS in the tumour microenvironment. ICOS is expressed by different
  T lymphocyte subpopulations, comprising CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), CD4+
  helper T cells (Th), including Th1, Th2, Th17 and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells
  and CD4+ FoxP3+regulatory T cells (Tregs). Its main ligand, ICOSL is expressed by
  antigen-presenting cells (APCs, including B lymphocytes) and by somatic (including
  tumour) cells. The interaction between ICOS and ICOSL has agonistic/stimulating
  activities, promoting an antitumour response by Th1, CTL and Tfh and of a protumour
  response mediated by Tregs and Th2 in the tumour microenvironment. Figure represents
  the crosstalk between ICOS+ T cell subsets and ICOSL-expressing cells and the effects
  of ICOS/ICOSL interaction. In red: protumour activities or effects; in blue: antitumour
  activities or effects.'
