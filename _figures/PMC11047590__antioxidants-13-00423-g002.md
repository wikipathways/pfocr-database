caption: Redox regulation of immunometabolism in the polarization of microglia in
  DR. (A) In M1 microglia, NADPH Oxidase (NOX) 2 couples to toll-like receptor 4 (TRL4)
  and generates H2O2 with the assistance of superoxide dismutase (SOD). H2O2, which
  enters the cytoplasm, acts as a second messenger. On the one hand, it activates
  NF-κB through the MAPK pathway, induces up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide
  synthase (iNOS) expression, and generates NO catalyzed by arginase, which nitrites
  Fe-S clusters in the mitochondrion and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
  activity. On the other hand, by inhibiting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN),
  H2O2 indirectly activates the AKT pathway, inducing glucose transporter (GLUT) 4
  to transfer to the cell membrane and promoting glycolysis. Simultaneously, the mTOR
  signaling pathway is also activated, which contributes to the elevated expression
  of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α. HIF-1α gained stability by nitroxylation and
  upregulated the expression of glycolysis-related genes, such as GLUT4 and 6 phosphofructo
  2 kinase/fructose 2,6 bisphosphatase (PFKFB3), further promoting glycolysis. (B)
  In M2 microglia, NOX2 activity is reduced due to inhibition of the PPP pathway and
  decreased NADPH production. At the same time, the accumulated TCA cycle product
  citrate is isomerized in the cytoplasm to generate itaconate, which can covalently
  modify Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and activate nuclear factor E2-related
  factor 2 (NRF2). NRF2 enters the nucleus and, on the one hand, inhibits the transcriptional
  activity of NF-κB and reduces the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. On the
  other hand, it binds to ARE and induces the transcription of antioxidant molecule
  genes, especially thioredoxin (TRX). The activated TRX system can increase the efficiency
  of OXPHOS by removing the nitrosylation of Fe-S clusters, while down-regulating
  HIF-1α-induced glycolytic gene expression to inhibit the process of glycolysis
