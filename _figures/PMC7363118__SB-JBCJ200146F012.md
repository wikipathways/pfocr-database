caption: Proposed model for the interplays between RIG-I signaling and SFTSV infection.
  RIG-I, which is armed by most cell types, plays a major role in the recognition
  of SFTSV infection. First, viral RNAs (particularly 5′ppp RNAs) produced during
  SFTSV infection trigger RIG-I conformational change. Then RIG-I is able to be further
  activated by TRIM25-mediated Lys-63 ubiquitination of its CARD domains. Subsequently,
  fully activated RIG-I directs downstream kinase-transcription factor signaling cascades
  through the adaptor MAVS on mitochondria, resulting in expression of inflammatory
  cytokines, IFNs, and ISGs and establishment of the antiviral state. Therein, the
  expression of RLRs themselves is also up-regulated by the signaling pathway, leading
  to the formation of a positive regulation loop, which is likely exploited by the
  host cells to further facilitate the restriction of SFTSV infection. On the other
  hand, SFTSV has evolved more than one strategy to antagonize the antiviral signaling
  by its NSs protein and NSs-induced IBs. In addition to the sequestration of kinases
  TBK1/IKKε and hence inhibition of the kinase-IRF3 signaling, NSs can also specifically
  arrest TRIM25 (but not RIG-I) into viral IBs and deprive Lys-63 ubiquitination of
  RIG-I CARD domains, blocking the antiviral signaling at an early stage. TBK1, TANK-binding
  kinase 1; IKK, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase.
