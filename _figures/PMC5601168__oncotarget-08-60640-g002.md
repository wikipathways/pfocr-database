caption: AC gene mutations involve area composita and desmosome proteins (asterisks)
  and lead to abnormalities in intercalated disc (ID) consisting of cell adhesion
  defects, gap junction and ion channel remodelling. (A) Mutations in ID proteins
  can result also in the perturbation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. (B) Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling is suppressed in concomitance with the activation of Hippo pathway [].
  The impaired localization of phosphorylated protein kinase C-α to the perturbed
  IDs is associated with activation of neurofibromin 2 (NF2) and results in cascade
  phosphorylation leading to increased phospho-Yes-associated protein (pYAP) and its
  retention in the cytoplasm. pYAP interacts with β-catenin (β-cat), which is not
  able to translocate into the nucleus and, as a consequence, the expression of the
  effectors of both Hippo and canonical Wnt pathways (TEAD and Tcf/Lef, respectively)
  is suppressed and adipogenesis is enhanced (B1). Other experimental data reveal
  that loss of plakoglobin leads to the activation of AKT and the subsequent inhibition
  of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) resulting in the stabilization of β-cat and
  its translocation in the nucleus. Here, β-cat interacts with Tcf/Lef causing the
  increase of the expression of c-myc, c-fos, and cyclin D1, as well as cardiac hypertrophy
  [] (B2). The disruption of junction integrity can result in increased presence of
  β-catenin at IDs without the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. However, increased
  expression of transforming growth factor β-1 (TGFβ1), phospho-SMAD2 (pSMAD2), and
  Pai1 is consistent with the activation of TGFβ pathway responsible for the progressive
  fibrosis in AC hearts [] (B3) (DSC2, desmocollin-2; DSG2, desmoglein-2; DSP, desmoplakin;
  PKP2, plakophilin-2; DES, desmin; N-cad, N-cadherin; αT-cat, αT-catenin; αE-cat,
  αE-catenin; Tcf/Lef, T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor; TEAD, SV40
  transcriptional enhancer factor domain).
