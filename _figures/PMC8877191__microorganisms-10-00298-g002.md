caption: Metabolism of methionine. Ensifer aridi predicted encoding genes (PEGs) involved
  in the metabolism of methionine are shown in the metabolic pathway. The presence
  of putative SahR, ThuR, and IolR binding sites upstream of genes (shown in the right
  boxes) are indicated, respectively, by “*”, “#”, and “$” on the left of genes when
  identified, and the position of conserved residues are bolded and colored accordingly
  in boxes. The salt response refers to fold change previously found by RNAseq [].
  Positive fold changes indicating upregulation (green) and negative ones showing
  repression (red) in salt containing medium are bolded when above 2.
