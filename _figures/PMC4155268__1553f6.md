caption: Multiple effects of EPCR on cancer. In the vasculature, the EPCR-APC–mediated
  signaling pathway on the endothelium provides an antimetastatic effect by inhibiting
  the extravasation of tumor cells through down-regulation of vascular adhesion molecules
  on the endothelium that are involved in tumor cell adhesion and by enhancing barrier
  integrity of the endothelium. EPCR on tumor cells may increase the metastatic potential
  as EPCR-APC signaling promotes tumor cell survival, migration, and invasion. In
  the tumor compartment, EPCR, in general, promotes tumor growth and burden through
  its survival benefits. However, in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), EPCR suppresses
  tumor growth by promoting tumor cell apoptosis and/or inhibiting tumor cell proliferation.
  At present, it is unclear whether specific receptor(s) present on MPM cells or the
  pleural microenvironment is responsible for the EPCR-mediated tumor cell apoptosis
  in MPM. TF, tissue factor; PAR1, protease activated receptor-1.
