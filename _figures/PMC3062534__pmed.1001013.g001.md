caption: Black and blue arrows indicate triggering of complement cascades by autoantibodies
  or damaged self-tissue; green arrows, deposition of C3b on a target sets in motion
  the powerful amplification loop of the alternative pathway; red arrows, effector
  activities of complement are generated by C3b deposition and C3a release and the
  downstream mediators C5b-9 and C5a. Regulation of feedback loop of alternative pathway
  on the placental trophoblasts (or endothelial cells) occurs through limited proteolytic
  cleavage of C3b to generate iC3b. This reaction is carried out by a serine protease,
  factor I (FI), along with membrane cofactor protein (MCP) or CFH (FH). Because SLE
  and APS are characterized by autoantibodies that trigger the classical pathway,
  defective regulation of C4b (a component of the classical pathway C3 convertase)
  by MCP is also likely to influence the severity of tissue injury and risk for preeclampsia.
  If regulators such as MCP, CFI (FI), or CFH (FH) are dysfunctional, excessive complement
  activation occurs. This may result in placental damage, thrombobosis and release
  of antiangiogenic factors, culminating in preeclampsia.
