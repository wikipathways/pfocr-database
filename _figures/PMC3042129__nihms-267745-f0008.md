caption: For this model our gene list was restricted to the 28 most significant proteins,
  as determined by their presence on at least two of the five gels, and to the top
  50 genes (p<.00045) from the cDNA microarray analysis. These 78 genes were interrogated,
  using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com).
  The final pathway displayed 52 nodes after we added five more genes (whose significance
  was high but fell below the cutoff) to improve connectivity and include most of
  the candidate genes. CASP3, RB1, and NF1 were added from the microarray results,
  and YWHA2 and ACTB came from the protein list. Genes from the protein list are underlined.
  HNRPA2B1 is underlined twice, because it appeared on both lists.
