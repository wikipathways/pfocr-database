caption: Role of Glucose Metabolism in ACVD Development. A) Representative time course
  of changes in plasma glucose levels and its effect on inflammatory trends show effects
  of glucose uptake on lipoxidation and endothelial dysfunction in ACVD [Adapted []];
  B) Enzymatic degradation of polysaccharides by digestive enzymes leads to increased
  glucose abundance and subsequent direct/indirect ROS stress in progressing atheroma.
  Multiple mechanisms including NADPH oxidase (NOX), insulin receptor substrate-1
  (IRS-1), and glycated lipids (AGE) contribute to inflammatory and proliferative
  pathway activation. However, the causal effect of inflammatory and immune response
  leading to increased glucose uptake and energy homeostatic dysregulation is yet
  to be fully elucidated. Figure generated using BioRender.
