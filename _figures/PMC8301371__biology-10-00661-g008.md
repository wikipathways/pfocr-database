caption: Schematic diagram of mechanisms for imiquimod-mediated HIV inhibition in
  macrophages. Through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by binding to
  TLR7, imiquimod induces CC chemokines (MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES), TNF-α, IL-6,
  IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-10. As the natural ligands for HIV entry co-receptor CCR5, the
  CC chemokines can inhibit HIV entry into macrophages. Through binding to TNF receptor
  2 (TNFR2), TNF-α inhibits the CD4 and CCR5 expression. In addition, TNF-α can induce
  the CC chemokines through binding to TNFR2 and activating the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  These combined activities result in the blocking of HIV entry into macrophages by
  imiquimod. As a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 can counteract the adverse
  effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokines on HIV infection and inhibit HIV replication.
  Therefore, it is likely that imiquimod-induced IL-10 compromises the stimulatory
  effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8) on HIV
  infection/replication in macrophages.
