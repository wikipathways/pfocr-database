caption: A schematic diagram of the signaling of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/Akt pathway involved in human cancers. Akt is activated by Class I PI3K,
  composed of two subunits, p110 and p85. Akt is activated by phosphorylation at Thr308
  by PDK-1 and at Ser473 by mTORC2. This pathway is negatively regulated by phosphatase
  and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphate,
  type II (INPP4B). Activated Akt phosphorylates its substrates, then regulates a
  wide range of target proteins and has multiple cellular functions, including effects
  on cell survival, cell cycle progression, cell growth and other processes.
