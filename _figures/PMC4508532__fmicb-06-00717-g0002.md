caption: Evolution of the biosynthesis pathway of threonylcarbamoyl adenosine (t6A)
  from LUCA to the three domains of life. Homologous proteins have the same shapes
  and colors, except for YgjE and YeaZ, which are homologous but not orthologous.
  In this scenario, this universal tRNA modification was performed in LUCA by two
  universal proteins (the ancestors of Kae1/YgjD and of Sua5/YrdC, respectively),
  as in mitochondria (; ). Additional proteins are now essential for t6A synthesis
  in modern organisms (; ,). The bacterial proteins (YjeE, YeaZ) are non-homologous
  to the archaeal/eukaryal ones (Bud32, Pcc1, Cgi121). The most parsimonious scenario
  supports the rooting between Bacteria and Archaea/Eukarya, because other roots would
  require the presence of the Bud32, Pcc1, and Cgi121 proteins in LUCA, and their
  replacement by the YeaZ, YjeE proteins in Bacteria, an unlikely evolutionary pathway
  (see text).
