caption: Hypoxia enhances the immune response, and is an inflammatory stimulus by
  itself. Hypoxia leads to cellular stabilisation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α),
  resulting in a synergistic effect with the key inflammatory transcription factor
  NFΚB. In addition, inflammation enhances transcription and translation of HIF-1α,
  leading to a synergistic effect in case of hypoxia and inflammation. In myeloid
  cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, HIF-1α activity exerts pro-inflammatory
  effects, aimed at clearance of pathogens. Conversely, in many other cells, such
  as T-cells, pulmonary and interstitial epithelium, and myocytes, HIF-1α activity
  has anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, hypoxia exerts anti-inflammatory effects
  through the adenosine pathway, as it increases the availability of adenosine progenitors
  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), upregulates the converting
  enzymes CD39 and CD73 to enhance adenosine production, and increases the expression
  of the anti-inflammatory adenosine 2A and 2B receptors (A2A and A2B). The upregulation
  of CD73 and adenosine receptors are HIF-1α-dependent.
