caption: Overview of metabolism and functional expression of MCTs. MCTs are mostly
  transported to the liver via the portal vein after digestion and absorption. Since
  MCTs do not require carnitine for transfer to the mitochondria, they are quickly
  beta-oxidized and become energy. During this process, ketone bodies are produced,
  which serve as an alternative energy source to glucose in the brain. Although the
  pathway is unknown, acylated ghrelin levels in the blood increase after MCTs ingestion.
  Acylated ghrelin enhance the secretion of growth hormone (GH), which in turn stimulates
  the secretion of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Furthermore, IGF-1 enhance
  protein synthesis and suppress protein degradation by activating Akt/mTOR signaling.
  MCFAs transferred to the peripheral blood act on skeletal muscle to enhance mitochondrial
  biosynthesis and mitochondrial metabolic activity. MCFAs also stimulates the secretion
  of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from small intestinal L cells.
