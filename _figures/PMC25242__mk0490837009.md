caption: Model proposing how different regulatory mechanisms cooperate to determine
  Hog1 intracellular distribution. (A) Under favorable growth conditions Hog1 travels
  between cytoplasm and nucleus. This cycling is independent of activity and the presence
  of upstream components of the MAPK pathway. (B) During acute stress Hog1 rapidly
  accumulates in the nucleus. Hog1 phosphorylation by Pbs2 is essential for this process.
  Phosphorylated Hog1 is either more competent for nuclear import or less competent
  for nuclear export (as indicated by the thickness of the arrows). At the same time,
  some nuclear retention factors accumulate in the nuclear compartment. At this step,
  Hog1 kinase might modify stress response–specific targets. (C) Late phase of adaptation
  induces kinase activity-dependent nuclear export of Hog1. There are three potential
  mechanisms for which kinase activity is necessary. Hog1 might activate nuclear phosphatases;
  that might convert Hog1 into a more efficient export cargo. Alternatively, nuclear
  substrates phosphorylated by Hog1 might be exported, decreasing the concentration
  of nuclear retention factors. Finally, Hog1 might be required to enhance the activity
  of an export system. P, phosphate; PP, protein phosphatase.
