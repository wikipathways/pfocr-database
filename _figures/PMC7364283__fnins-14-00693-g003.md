caption: Hyperosmotic induction of COX-2 and mTOR. COX-2 is overexpressed in the reno-medullary
  interstitial cells in a hyperosmotic environment. This leads to higher transcriptional
  rates of osmolyte transporters, and thus the cell can accumulate large amounts of
  osmolytes to aid in its survival, while GSK-3β opposes this pathway; Nucleus pulposus
  (NP) cells also cope with hypertonic conditions by overexpressing COX-2 via two
  different cascades-TonEBP and MAPK; Yeast cells exhibit higher levels of TORC2 under
  hypertonic conditions resulting in higher glycerol concentrations which eventually
  reestablishes cell turgor pressure.
