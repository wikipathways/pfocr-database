caption: Regulation of the Fe deficiency response via FIT. The model depicts proteins
  that directly interact with FIT via protein–protein interactions to regulate Fe
  uptake (indicated by solid black lines). Binding of FIT with subgroup Ib bHLH transcription
  factors, MED16 and EIN3/EIL (MED25 interacts with MED16 and EIN3/EIL1), and phosphorylation
  by CIPK11 leads to positive regulation of the Fe deficiency response and activation
  of Fe uptake genes such as FRO2 and IRT1 during Fe-deficient conditions (indicated
  by blue arrows). Binding of FIT with DELLA and ZAT12 prevents the binding of subgroup
  Ib bHLHs to FIT and prevents transcription of Fe uptake genes (indicated by the
  green arrow), whereas FIT interactions with subgroup IVa bHLH transcription factors
  lead to proteasomal degradation of FIT (indicated by red arrows). Abbreviations
  used are Fe, iron; Ca2+, calcium; ET, ethylene; GA, gibberellic acid; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; JA, jasmonic acid; red circle, calcium ion; P, phosphorylation.
  Red faded lines, signaling pathway; rounded rectangles, proteins; dashed circle,
  nucleus.
