caption: 'The effect of pepsin on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its
  related signalling pathway in human hypopharyngeal primary cells, at less acidic
  LPR. Pepsin at slightly acidic or neutral pH causes significant overexpression of
  EGFR, accompanied by elevated activation of p-NF-κB and p-STAT3, and a significant
  overexpression of EGFR-related oncogenic factors and cytokines, including AKT1,
  mTOR, IL1β, IL6, TNF-α, STAT3 and RELA(p65), and antiapoptotic BCL2, previously
  linked to HNSCC [,,,,,,,,,]. (red arrows: pepsin effect in HCs; dashed black arrows:
  possible interactions; green boxes: genes upregulated by pepsin).'
