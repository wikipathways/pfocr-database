caption: Major pathways governing oxidative stress in PAD. Effort induced cycles of
  ischemia and reperfusion lead to increased reactive oxygen species production by
  mitochondria, with the two major sites of ROS production being ETC complexes I and
  III. The increased ROS production may further cause cumulative mtDNA damage, and
  progressive ETC dysfunction. Nrf2 may be a key component in attenuating oxidative
  stress in ischemia‐reperfusion injury. H2S can increase localization of Nrf2, modulating
  the expression of many antioxidant genes, as well as activation of the HO‐1 signaling
  pathway.
