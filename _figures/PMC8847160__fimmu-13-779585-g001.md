caption: After the transferrin binds to the transferrin receptor on the plasma membrane,
  the plasma membrane forms a vesicle that takes Fe3+ carrying transferrin into the
  cell. Then, the low pH in the vesicle promotes the separation of Fe3+ from the transferrin
  and the shedding of Fe3+. It is reduced to Fe2+ and free in the cytoplasm, or is
  combined with ferritin to form an iron pool. The ferritin in the iron pool can be
  encapsulated by autophagy lysosomes under the mediation of NCOA4, and then degraded
  and release a large amount of Fe2+. Fe2+ and H2O2 generate PLOOH through the fenton
  reaction, which promotes ferroptosis by promoting further lipid peroxidation and
  self-peroxidation. In the GSH/GPX4 pathway, with the help of GSH, GPX4 down-regulates
  ROS and inhibits ferroptosis. This can be suppressed by RSL3. System Xc- (cystine/glutamate
  antiporter) promotes synthesis of glutathione, which can be offset by erastin, sulfasalazine
  and sorafenib. In the FSP1 protection pathway, FSP1 can catalyze the reduction of
  CoQ10 to panthenol and consume NAD(P)H to inhibit ROS. In the GCH1 protection pathway,
  GCH1 acts as a rate-limiting enzyme to manage the biosynthesis of BH4 and reduce
  ferroptosis.
