caption: Signaling pathways of polarization and functional expression of periodontal
  macrophages. In this review, four types of signaling pathways in periodontal macrophages
  were selected, including MAPK, NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and AKT. When the receptor on the
  cell membrane is stimulated, the corresponding signaling pathway plays a role, and
  finally transduces the signal to DNA, transcription and translation of the corresponding
  effector molecules. A diagram of some links of the signaling pathway mentioned in
  this paper is shown in the figure.
