caption: 'Autophagy pathway: signaling systems and three proposed membrane sources
  in autophagosome formation. ER, endoplasmic reticulum. PM, plasma membrane. MT,
  mitochondria. Model 1: The central membranous structure, omegasome (立-some) is derived
  from the ER (ER cradle model), and is believed to be an early precursor of autophagic
  isolation membranes (IM) or phagophores. Phagophore crescents close to form double
  membrane autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomal intermediates to form the degradative
  organelles, autolysosomes. Model 2: Mitochondria may contribute membrane or phosphatidylinositol
  (PE) of relevance for LC3 (A, B and C; and other Atg8 paralogs, GABARAP and GATE-16)
  C-terminal lipidation into the LC3-II, autophagic membrane-associated form. Mitochondria
  may also be a source of reactive oxygen species that inactivate ATG4, an LC3 dilipidating
  enzyme. Mitochondria are also one of the major target substrates for autophagic
  elimination. Model 3: Plasma membrane Atg16L1-positive (initially LC3-negative)
  vesicles may contribute to autophagic membrane growth. Factors in the left upper
  corner represent upstream signaling systems (AMPK, mammalian Tor [mTor], Ral) controlling
  induction of autophagy in response to nutritional and cellular energetics signals.
  Beclin 1 (BEC-1) and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hVPS34 cooperate in
  control of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) structures that start with 立-some,
  identifiable by the marker DFCP-1 for which a functional role in autophagy is yet
  to be established. NBR1 and p62 (also known as sequestosome 1) are autophagic adaptor
  proteins that capture cargo and interact with LC3; p62 is also present very early
  at the sites leading to omegasome formation, and is furthermore found in complexes
  with mTOR that sense amino acid starvation (not shown). Ambra and Atg14L are additional
  factors interacting with Beclin 1 complexes that are responsible for the early autophagosomal
  pathway. The lipid kinase hVPS34 interacts with UVRAG and additional factors (not
  shown) to control autophagosomal maturation into autolysosomes. Several systems
  and tethering systems along the different stages of the early secretory pathway
  and the Golgi apparatus (TRAPP, COG, GRASP) influence the formation, expansion (contributed
  by the only Atg integral membrane protein Atg9) and maturation of autophagosomal
  organelles.'
