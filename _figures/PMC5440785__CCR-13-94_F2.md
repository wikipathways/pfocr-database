caption: "Schematic representation of the contribution of ER stress to the development
  of atherosclerosis. ER stress is activated by known atherosclerosis risk factors.
  The PERK pathway has been implicated in regulation of ASMC apoptosis and proliferation.
  Osteocalcin (OCN), SelS, taurine and wogonin have been shown to have protective
  effects against ER stress in the context of atherosclerosis. Exact mechanisms linking
  all these factors are unknown. Abbreviations: ATF4 – activating transcription factor
  4, CHOP - DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 3 (DDIT3), eIF2α – eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 2α, IRE1 - Endoplasmic Reticulum To Nucleus Signaling 1 (ERN1),
  OCN – osteocalcin (BGLAP), oxLDL – oxidised low-density lipoprotein, PERK -Eukaryotic
  Translation Initiation Factor 2 Alpha Kinase 3 (EIF2AK3), SelS – selenoprotein S,
  XBP1 – x-box binding \Lprotein 1."
