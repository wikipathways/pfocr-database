caption: Schematic representation of the model of molecular regulation of the expression
  of BmWCP4 as well as other BmWCP genes by nuclear transcription factors in response
  to 20E and JH during metamorphosis in B. mori. 20E binds to the heterodimer of the
  USP/ecdysone receptor, which either directly or indirectly activates the expression
  of the transcription factors BmPOUM2 and BmβFTZ-F1. While BmβFTZ-F1 binds to the
  corresponding BmβFTZ-F1 CRE, the nuclear homeodomain transcription factor BmPOUM2
  interacts with another homeodomain transcription factor, BmAbd-A, to form a complex,
  which binds to the corresponding POU CRE in the BmWCP4 regulatory region to activate
  the expression of BmWCP4, as well as other genes coding for pupal wing disc cuticle
  proteins (pathway 1). BmPOUM2 may also indirectly activate expression of the genes
  coding for other BmWCP proteins by activating other unidentified transcription factor(s)
  that interact with CREs in the promoter of these genes (pathway 2). Activation of
  other BmWCP genes may not act through the direct (pathway 1) or indirect (pathway
  2) action of BmPOUM2 but through unknown transcription factor(s) in the regulation
  of the expression of BmWCP genes (pathway 3). All these pathways work together,
  leading to the postlarval development and differentiation of the wing disc during
  metamorphosis.
