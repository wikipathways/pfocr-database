caption: Schematic representation of CA metabolism in plants. Citrate derived from
  the TCA cycle can be converted to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase converts acetyl-CoA
  to malonyl-CoA, a precursor for fatty acid and jasmonate biosynthesis via the octadecanoid
  metabolic pathway. Malonyl Co-A also feeds into the mevalonate pathway and provides
  building blocks of phytohormones (cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids,
  and strigolactones) and vitamins (vitamin K and vitamin A). Oxaloacetate (OAA) can
  be converted into glucose-6-phosphate via PEP caroxykinase and phosphatases, providing
  a source of ascorbic acid as well as glucose, sucrose and fructose. 2-oxoglutarate
  can be converted into glutamate, feeding into GABA and amino acid biosynthesis.
