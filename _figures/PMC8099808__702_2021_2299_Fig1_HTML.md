caption: Proposed functional alterations in X-linked dystonia parkinsonism over the
  disease course due to progressive striatal neurodegeneration. In the physiological
  state, neurons of the striosomes (S) send inhibitory GABAergic projections to dopamine-containing
  neurons of the SNc. The SNc innervates D1 and D2 receptor containing matrix (M)
  neurons and thus differentially modulates the balance between the direct and indirect
  pathway. Predominant degeneration of the striosomes results in a postulated SNc
  disinhibition in the early phase of XDP. Dopaminergic dysregulation shifts the balance
  between both pathways towards the direct pathway which results in impaired surround
  inhibition and facilitates dystonia. The degeneration of matrix neurons in later
  disease stages leads to MSA-like parkinsonism due to reduced postsynaptic dopamine
  receptor density. S striosomes, M matrix, SNc substantia nigra pars compacta, D1
  dopamine D1 receptor, D2 dopamine D2 receptor, GABA gamma aminobutyric acid, MSA
  multiple system atrophy
