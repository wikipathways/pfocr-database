caption: Protein targets are grouped by pathway on a map created using GeneGO Metacore;
  icons in the key are derived from the GeneGO functions associated with each protein
  (see key). Each protein is labeled with a box showing the increase or decrease of
  protein expression between samples captured pre-treatment and those collected after
  8 days of treatment on a red to blue scale (white indicates that little change occurred
  and the absence of the box indicates that the ratio could not be measured). Data
  are provided for patient 14 and patient 18 (both patients received 135 mg/kg XL888
  and 960 mg of vemurafenib twice daily and had a partial response on treatment).
  Days on therapy are the total days that the patient remained on BRAF-HSP90 inhibitor
  therapy, although the on-treatment biopsies were done on day 8 of treatment.
