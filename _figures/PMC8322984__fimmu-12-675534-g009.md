caption: Schematic of the signaling pathway involved in TTP and PP2A activity in the
  MSU crystal-induced inflammatory response. After MSU crystal stimulation, TTP expression
  and PP2A activity were increased. TTP knockdown promoted the expression of inflammation-related
  genes induced by MSU crystals. However, PP2A agonist (ATG) treatment relieved the
  expression of inflammation-related genes induced by MSU crystals. ATG may alleviate
  the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, increase mitochondrial
  membrane potential and improve lysosomal function, thereby inhibiting the activity
  of NLRP3 inflammasome, and ultimately reducing the inflammation caused by MSU crystals.
