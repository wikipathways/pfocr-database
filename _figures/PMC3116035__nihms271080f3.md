caption: A) Schematic outline of mitochondrial and metabolic pathways connected to
  the PPP in hepatocytes. The PPP regulates the Δψm by providing i) NADPH that serves
  as a reducing equivalent for the activity of catalase and nitric oxide synthase
  (NOS) and for GSH regeneration from its oxidized form GSSG and ii) R5P for biosynthesis
  of nucleotides. Mitochondrial electron transport chain activity is reversibly inhibited
  by NO at complex IV/cytochrome c oxidase and irreversibly inhibited via S-nitrosylation
  of complex I in a state of GSH depletion . Blocked electron transport leads to the
  transfer of electron to molecular oxygen (O2−) and the formation of reactive oxygen
  intermediates (ROI). Mitochondrial ROI production is neutralized through the activities
  of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase at the expense of NADPH. Glucose is
  taken up by hepatocytes through the transporter GLUT1 and enters glycolysis or the
  PPP as G6P. The PPP and glycolysis are also connected via the common substrate GA3P.
  The glycolysis product pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA and thus enters the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA) in mitochondria. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) senses
  Δψm  and ATP depletion and controls cellular metabolism via protein translation
  and authophagy . TAL-deficient hepatocytes have reduced mitochondrial mass. Mitochondrial
  homeostasis is maintained through a balance between de novo biogenesis elicited
  by NO and mitochondrial autophagy or mitophagy regulated by mTOR. B) Metabolic and
  genetic checkpoints of progressive liver disease leading from nonalcoholic fatty
  liver disease (NAFLD) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) in TAL deficiency. Hepatocytes of TAL-deficient mice exhibit increased
  susceptibility to APAP-induced necrosis and resistance to Fas apoptosis. Life-long
  supplementation of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) increases GSH levels, normalizes NADPH,
  blockes APAP susceptibility and restores Fas apoptosis, phosphorylation of β-catenin,
  and activation of c-jun and prevents the development of NASH, cirrhosis and HCC
  . However, NAC does not prevent NAFLD which may be attributed to stimulation of
  lipogenesis by X5P .
