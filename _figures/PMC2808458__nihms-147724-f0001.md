caption: Activation of TLRs though ligand binding leads to the recruitment of the
  adaptor protein MyD88 or TRIF. In the MyD88 dependent pathway, activation of IRAK1
  by IRAK4 leads to IRAK1 autophosphorylation which facilitates TRAF6 recruitment.
  TRAF6 then recruits MAP3Ks such as TAK1, MEKK2/3 and ASK1. TAK1 activation leads
  to the activation of IKK complex and the subsequent IkB degradation and NF-kB nucleus
  translocation. TAK1 also activates the p38-JNK signaling pathway. Tpl2, MEKK2/3
  and ASK1 activate ERK1/2, p38-JNK and p38 respectively. In the MyD88-independent
  pathway TRIF activates TBK1 as well as IKKi which turns on the IRF-3 transcription
  factor. TRIF also activates NFkB signaling through RIP1. One of the most important
  consequences of TLR signaling is the transcriptional regulation of inflammatory
  genes as well as genes involved in cell proliferation and survival carried out by
  four groups of transcription factors.
