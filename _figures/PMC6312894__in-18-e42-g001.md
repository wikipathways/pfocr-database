caption: . Potential therapeutic targeting of Th22/IL-22 signaling pathways in AD.
  Skin barrier defects caused by scratching or genetic mutations lead to penetration
  of external antigens and keratinocyte production of IL-23 via endogenous TLR4 ligand/TLR4
  axis. A subset of IL-23R expressing DCs are activated and triggers AHR dependent
  Th22 immune response. Skin infiltrated CCR6+ Th22 cells induce epidermal hyperplasia
  and barrier dysfunction via IL-22/IL-22R signaling axis. Targeting TLR4/IL-23/Th22/IL-22
  as well as CCL20/CCR6 pathways might be a promising strategy to overcome atopic
  skin inflammation.
