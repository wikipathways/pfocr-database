caption: Simplified 5-ALA metabolic pathway. Exogenous 5-ALA enters cells via the
  transporters peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) and peptide transporter 2 (PEPT2). Endogenous
  5-ALA is synthesized from succinyl-CoA and glycine in the mitochondria. Once inside
  the cell, 5-ALA is converted into porphobilinogen by ALA dehydratase (ALAD). Porphobilinogen
  is converted into coproporphyrinogen III through a series of enzymatic reactions
  beginning with porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). Coproporphyrinogen III is translocated
  from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria by the transporter ABCB6. Protoporphyrin
  IX (PPIX) is produced following a series of enzymatic reactions and converted into
  heme by ferrochelatase (FECH). The excitation and emission wavelengths of PPIX,
  approximately 400–630 nm and 630–710 nm, respectively, contribute to its utility
  as an optical imaging agent. Figure created with BioRender.com; accessed on 19 February
