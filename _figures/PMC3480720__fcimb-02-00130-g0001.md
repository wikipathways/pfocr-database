caption: Overview of innate immune signals during B. abortus infection. B. abortus-associated
  molecular patterns are recognized by pattern-recognition receptors. TLR2 is activated
  by lipidated outer membrane proteins (L-Omp16 and L-Omp19); TLR4 is activated by
  B. abortus LPS and unlipidated outer membrane protein-16 (U-Omp16); and TLR9 is
  activated by B. abortus DNA. TLR activation leads to intracellular signaling via
  MyD88 and IRAK-4 resulting in the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs producing inflammatory
  cytokines. Cytosolic sensors are also involved in B. abortus DNA recognition. This
  pathway involves an unknown receptor leading to IFN-β production dependent on STING
  and IRF3 activation. Autocrine signaling through the IFN I receptor (IFNAR) leads
  to activation of signal transducers JAK and STAT1 which culminates in the transcriptional
  induction of genes that carry promoters with IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE).
  Other cytosolic receptors such as NOD1 and NOD2 play an additional role in recognizing
  B. abortus. Activation of these receptors by Brucella culminates in NF-κB activation
  resulting in cytokines synthesis. Solid arrows represent the TLR and non-TLR signaling
  pathways involving MyD88/IRAK-4 axis important to control B. abortus infection.
  Discontinuous arrows represent TLR, NOD1, NOD2, and type I IFN receptor signaling
  that are not necessary for B. abortus clearance.
