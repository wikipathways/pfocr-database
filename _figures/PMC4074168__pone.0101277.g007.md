caption: NB increases the cellular uptake of Cur, which subsequently improves intracellular
  ROS generation. Overproduction of ROS leads to accumulation of DNA damage. DNA damage
  activates p53 pathway, which causes mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction
  activates several caspase cascades, and finally leads to cell apoptosis. In addition,
  ROS also enhances the phosphorylation of JNK and inactivation of Akt and ERK, which
  enhances the p53 activation and promotes the apoptotic cascade.
