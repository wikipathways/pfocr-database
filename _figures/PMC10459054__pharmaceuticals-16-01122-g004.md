caption: (1) AC acts on tumor-associated proteins, such as MMP3, and enhances 5-Fu
  chemosensitivity by downregulating the tumor suppressor inflammatory factor C-Myc
  (A in the figure), upregulating the NF-κB pathway, and increasing miR-142-3p expression
  (P in the figure). (2) SchA upregulates miR-195 in colon cancer (P in the figure)
  and acts on the PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathways to increase 5-Fu chemosensitivity. (3)
  KMP acts on heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) and polypyrimidine
  bundle binding protein (PTBP1) targets to upregulate miR-339-5p expression. The
  expression of M2-type pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is decreased by miR-339-5p, while PKM1
  is stimulated by the direct targeting of hnRNPA1 and PTBP1, enhancing chemosensitivity
