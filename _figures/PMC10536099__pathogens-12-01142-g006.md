caption: Model of canonical and alternative type III IFN signaling pathways. The model
  depicts classical and possible alternative pathway type III IFNs may induce in neurons.
  Type III IFNs may induce a downstream signaling involving p-STAT1 homodimers. These
  homodimers may bind to IFN-γ-activated site (GAS) elements instead of ISRE, inducing
  a unique subset of ISGs in a STAT1 dependent manner. Additionally, type III IFNs
  may activate unknown alternative pathways that induce ISG expression. Adapted from
