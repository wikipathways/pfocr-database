caption: Signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of MPNs and secondary AML.
  JAK2 binds to the cytosolic juxta-membrane region of dimeric cytokine receptors
  such as MPL (TPOR) and EPOR, via the BOX1 and BOX2 receptor motifs (black lines).
  JAK2 activation (via receptor-ligand binding or gain-of-function mutation such as
  JAK2 V617F) promotes various downstream signaling pathways, via STAT5, including
  RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT. These pathways facilitate oncogenic gene transcription and
  promote cancer cell survival, proliferation or migration. The expression of negative
  regulators such as the SOCS proteins are induced by the JAK-STAT pathway, however
  they are not sufficient to block hyperactive JAK-STAT signaling and cannot bind
  JAK2 V617F. The FLT3-ITD mutant growth factor receptor commonly found in AML patients
  signals independently of ligand-binding, as a result of the internal tandem duplication
  (ITD) found within the juxta-membrane domain (red box) and point mutations that
  occur within the kinase domain (most frequently at D835; dark blue box) of the FLT3
  receptor. FLT3-ITD hyperactivation promotes RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT as well as STAT5
  signaling. A number of important somatic mutations have been reported in various
  oncogenes and tumor suppressor proteins within these pathways (yellow stars), where
  such mutations are known to contribute to disease initiation and progression. For
  further details on these mutations, see . Mutated calreticulin (CALR), frequently
  found in MPN patients, interacts with the extracellular portion of the MPL receptor
  at the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi apparatus and also at the cell surface, promoting
  direct dimerization, activation of JAK2 and downstream signaling, independently
  of TPO binding (which is required for normal MPL signaling, indicated by a dashed
  arrow). Loss-of-function mutations in the critical tumor suppressor protein TP53
  are also reported generally in MPN patients that progress to secondary AML. Furthermore,
  various epigenetic-modifier proteins are found to be mutated in MPN patients, including
  isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2, DNA methyltransferase
  3A (DNMT3A), Polycomb group protein ASXL1 and the histone methyltransferase protein
  of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) EZH2. Promising therapeutic agents to target
  these key proteins/pathways in MPN/AML have been developed and are summarized here
  (black boxes). TPO, thrombopoietin; EPO, erythropoietin; GTP, guanosine triphosphate;
  TF, transcription factor.
