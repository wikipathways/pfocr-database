caption: Crosstalk between YAP signaling pathway and both TEAD and TGF-β pathways.
  When the Hippo signaling pathway is inactive, MST1/2 (mammalian STE20-like kinase
  1/2) activates LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1/2) proteins. LATS1/2 then phosphorylates
  YAP (yes-associated protein) which is retained in the cytoplasm or is degraded by
  the proteasome. When the Hippo signaling pathway is inactive, YAP is not phosphorylated
  and translocates to the nucleus where it can exert its transcriptional activity
  by binding to TEAD (transcriptional enhanced associate domain). YAP regulates the
  expression of specific targets involved in the cellular proliferation and thus in
  the primary tumor growth.
