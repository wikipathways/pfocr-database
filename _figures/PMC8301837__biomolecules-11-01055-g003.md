caption: Putative SUMO substrate proteins in disease. (Left) SUMO-conjugated proteins
  are increased after peripheral nerve injury. Several proteins known to play roles
  in injury and regeneration have been reported to be SUMOylated in other contexts.
  For example, calcineurin promotes myelin autophagy via TFEB after injury, and the
  Calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway becomes activated upon interaction with Sumo2.
  TFEB may also be regulated by SUMOylation. In this way, the increase in SUMO-conjugation
  after injury may stimulate nerve repair. c-JUN, which is essential for the reprogramming
  of Schwann cells during nerve regeneration. When SUMOylated, c-JUN stability is
  disturbed and its transcriptional activity is downregulated, this PTM also affects
  its interaction with other complex proteins, a plausible mechanism to restore Schwann
  cell homeostasis. The endoribonuclease DICER is SUMOylated hampering its miRNAs
  processing activity, but DICER is needed for Schwann cell transdifferentiation in
  response to nerve injury. SUMOylation of Merlin (downstream the beta1 Integrin/Rac1
  signaling pathway shown in ) affects its subcellular localization and subsequently
  inhibits cell proliferation and migration, which could possibly control Schwann
  cell response to injury. (Right) In neuropathies such as Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT)
  1A and 1B, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway is activated. One hypothesis
  is that the UPR could lead to accumulation of SUMO conjugated proteins in CMT1 as
  PERK tags the deSUMOylating enzyme SENP3 for degradation. Finally, N-myc downstream
  regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) becomes unstable when conjugated to Sumo2, and mutations
  of this gene have been linked to CMT4D.
