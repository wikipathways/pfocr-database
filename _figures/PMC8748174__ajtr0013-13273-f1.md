caption: TMEM-mediated molecular mechanisms in neurotumors. TMEM expression is increased
  in glioma. In glioma, TMEM16A and TMEM45A promote tumor-cell migration and proliferation
  by regulating the expression of MMP2/9 and cell-cycle-associated proteins via NF-κB
  activity. Upregulated expression of TMEM97 in glioma also promotes tumor-cell metastasis
  by regulating the expression of cyclins and EMT-related proteins. TMEM140 upregulates
  the expression of cell adhesion proteins, increases tumor-cell adhesion, inhibits
  the expression of apoptotic proteins, upregulates the expression of anti-apoptotic
  proteins, and promotes tumor-cell survival. TMEM168 shortens the cell cycle, reduces
  apoptosis, and promotes tumor-cell proliferation via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
  TMEM176A regulates the growth cycle of GBM cells, inhibits apoptosis, and accelerates
  tumor progression.
