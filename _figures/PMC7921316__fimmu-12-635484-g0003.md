caption: The molecular mechanisms of natural polyphenols in colon cancer. In colon
  cancer cells, natural polyphenols upregulate the expression of BCL and FADD protein
  and promote cell apoptosis. Natural polyphenols also downregulate PI3K/AKT and β-catenin
  signaling pathways and then hinder cell division. Moreover, natural polyphenols
  inhibit the activity of immune cells, regulate gut microbes leading to down-regulation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby reducing the release of inflammatory factors,
  such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α (Red indicates promotion; blue indicates inhibition;
  black indicates regulation).
