caption: Schematic representation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation of mitogen
  activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway in biotic and abiotc stresses.
  ROS is a common messenger produced in response to both the stress response, acting
  either up- or downstream of MAPK cascade. Despite being a common regulator of MAPKs
  signaling the response shown by plant is different in both the stresses. Purple
  and green color represents biotic and abiotc stress, respectively.
