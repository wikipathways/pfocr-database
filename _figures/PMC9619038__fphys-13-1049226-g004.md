caption: 'Anti-neuroinflammatory actions of sirtuins, through inactivation of p65
  subunit of NF-κB, activation of DNMT1 and anti-oxidative effects. Aβ aggregates
  activate cell membrane receptors that signaling though the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  SIRT1 exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, inhibiting both Aβ production
  and pro-inflammatory activation of microglial cells through abrogating NF-κB and
  IL-1β dependent signaling pathways . Both SIRT1 and SIRT2 can inhibit neuroinflammation
  via direct deacetylation of p65. SIRT1 and mitochondrial SIRT3 counteracts oxidative
  stress through FoxO3A deacetylation, resulting in MnSOD activation and/or direct
  MnSOD activation via deacetylation. Thus limited formation of ROS inhibits NLRP3
  activation. SIRT2 may inhibit NLRP3 through deacetylation of α-tubulin. SIRT1 facilitates
  Aβ degradation by upregulating lysosome number (). * TLRs are one example of a group
