caption: 'Schematic representation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 5 (GRK5)
  activities within cardiomyocytes, cancer, and neuronal cells. In cardiomyocytes:
  GRK5 is involved in phosphorylation of GPCRs, including the β-adrenergic receptor
  (βAR). Importantly, following catecholamine (CA) stimulation of βAR, GRK5 is also
  able to induce the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor
  (EGFR) via β-arrestin (β-arr)/src/matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) pathway activation.
  EGFR in turn activates a Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) protective pathway. In the nuclei, GRK5 is able to either bind to and
  phosphorylate Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) or bind the DNA and Nuclear factor of
  activated T-cells (NFAT), thus enhancing hypertrophic gene transcription. In cancer
  cells: GRK5 regulates p53 via direct phosphorylation and degradation. Moreover,
  into the nuclei, GRK5 can phosphorylate HDAC6 or can increase NFAT1 expression.
  In neuronal cells: GRK5 inhibits Tau phosphorylation. Conversely, this kinase can
  increase α-synuclein phosphorylation, promoting its aggregation. Finally, in the
  nucleus, GRK5 inhibits B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl2) gene transcription, increasing the
  apoptosis.'
