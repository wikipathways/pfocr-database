caption: 'Hypothesis: central neuroendocrine and peripheral mechanisms in generation
  of sex bias in PH. Male (M: “pulsatile”) versus female (F: “more continuous”) patterned
  secretion of GH by the pituitary followed by patterned activation of the STAT5a/b-BCL6
  axis represents a well-established pathway () to functionally connect the hypothalamus/pituitary
  on the one hand and pulmonary vascular tissues on the other hand as a mechanism
  for generating sex-biased gene expression in the latter. Upstream of pituitary/GH
  would be multifactorial central sex-bias mechanisms that impinge on the hypothalamus
  and effectuate M versus F patterns of secretion of GHRH; these include estradiol-17β
  (E2), serotonin (5-HT), cytokines and BMPs. Downstream of STAT5-BCL6 in peripheral
  pulmonary vascular cells would be hundreds of responsive genes for which patterned
  expression together contributes to the sex-biased disease process involving cell
  proliferation, cell hypertrophy, resistance to apoptosis and cytokine/growth factor
  secretion. The hypothesis also includes direct effects of various mediators (for
  example, cytokines and growth factors) at the level of the peripheral pulmonary
  vascular cells in a sex- and species-biased manner due to underlying gene expression
  changes (of on the order of perhaps 500–1,000 genes) already effectuated through
  the GH-STAT5 axis.'
