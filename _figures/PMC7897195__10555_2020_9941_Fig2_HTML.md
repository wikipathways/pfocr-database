caption: SFRP2 and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. a In the absence of Wnt ligands,
  an activated destruction complex consisting of proteins such as DvL and APC enables
  β-catenin ubiquitination by β-TrCP and subsequent degradation of β-catenin in the
  proteasome. b When Wnt ligands binds to FzD receptors, LRP becomes phosphorylated
  and the destruction complex moves towards the plasma membrane. By this means, the
  destruction complex remains inactive and, therefore, β-catenin is not ubiquitinated
  and degraded. Finally, β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and transcription of
  Wnt target genes is initiated. c Several studies suggest that the effect of SFRP2
  on Wnt signaling is dependent on the concentration. High concentrations are described
  to drive towards Wnt antagonism. SFRP2 is able to sequester Wnt ligands and prevent
  binding to FzD receptors. d At low concentrations of SFRP2, SFRP2 is able to synergize
  with Wnt ligands, enhancing their ability to activate Wnt signaling. Interestingly,
  SFRP2 is also described to directly bind to FzD receptors, activating the signaling
  cascade. The agonistic effect of SFRP2 might also be context dependent, where the
  expression of FzD5 is crucial for SFRP2 to function as potent Wnt activator. This
