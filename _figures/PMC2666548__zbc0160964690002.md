caption: Metabolic fluxes and functional links associated with the mitochondrial  FAS
  type II pathway in yeast. Solid arrows represent metabolic  fluxes, and dashed arrows
  indicate functional links. The large  arrow indicates that an unidentified product
  of fatty acid or lipoic acid  synthesis or a derivative thereof affects the efficiency
  of RNase P processing  of the RPM1-tRNAPro precursor RNA. Alternative sources of  acetyl-CoA
  other than that generated by PDH (pyruvate bypass, amino acid  breakdown, or transfer
  of extramitochondrially produced acetyl units) have  been omitted for clarity. FAs,
  fatty acids; α-KDH,  α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.
