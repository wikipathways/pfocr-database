caption: 'Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)‐specific alterations in amino acids
  with respect to their biosynthesis pathway in humans from glucose. (A) Essential
  amino acids cannot be synthesized and must be obtained from the diet, whereas non‐essential
  amino acids can be synthesized from glucose as it enters the tricarboxylic cycle.
  Essential amino acids are shown in grey boxes, and those metabolites synthesized
  as a by‐product of the gut microbiome are shown in green boxes. Specific amino acids
  that were increased are shown in red, decreased in blue (women‐specific outlined
  in pink and men‐specific in blue). (B) Sex‐specific disturbances in sleep measures.
  Box plots showing sex‐ and/or PTSD‐specific alterations in total sleep time (in
  minutes) decreased. Two‐way ANOVA: Sex: ns, PTSD: p = 0.004, and Sex X PTSD: ns.
  Sleep quality worsened, two‐way ANOVA: Sex: ns, PTSD: p < 0.0001, Sex X PTSD: ns
  and log‐transformed delta power sleep were lower in people with PTSD versus controls,
  two‐way ANOVA: Sex: p = 0.007, PTSD: p = 0.005, and Sex X PTSD: ns. Greater PTSD
  symptoms (reflected by the total PCL‐C score) were negatively associated with total
  sleep time (TST; r = –0.41, p = 0.005 and r = –0.32, p = 0.033, women and men, respectively),
  and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was positively associated with greater
  PTSD symptoms (r = 0.84 and 0.74, p < 0.001, women and men, respectively). Delta
  power was negatively associated with PTSD (r = –0.35, p = 0.02) in men alone. (C)
  Linear regression showing association of PCL‐C scores with three different measures
  of sleep. (D) Sex differences in primary metabolites after accounting for sleep
  measures. ChemRich analysis of primary metabolites in men and women with PTSD compared
  with controls after adjusting for BMI, age, and one of the three sleep measures
  shown (TST (min), PSQI, or log‐transformed delta power (ln(μV2)). Blue nodes contain
  metabolite clusters that are decreased, purple nodes contain metabolites that are
  both increased or decreased, and red nodes contain metabolites that are increased
  in PTSD versus control individuals'
