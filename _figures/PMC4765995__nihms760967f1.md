caption: Schematic diagram of the polyp to colorectal cancer sequences. Currently,
  two discrete normal colon to colorectal cancer sequences have been identified. Both
  sequences involve the progression of normal colon epithelial cells to aberrant crypt
  foci (ACF), followed by early and advanced polyps with subsequent progression to
  early cancer and then advanced cancer. The classic or traditional pathway was the
  pathway originally identified and involves the development of tubular adenomas that
  can progress to adenocarcinomas. An alternate pathway that involves serrated polyps
  and their progression to serrated colorectal cancer has been described in the last
  5–10 years. The genes mutated or epigenetically altered are indicated by each pathway.
  Some genes are shared between the two pathways and others are unique (i.e. BRAF
  mutations and CIMP only in serrated pathway). The signaling pathways deregulated
  during the progression sequence are also shown with the width of the arrow reflecting
  the significance of the signaling pathway in tumor formation. (Figure reproduced
