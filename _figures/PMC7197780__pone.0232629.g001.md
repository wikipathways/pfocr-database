caption: (A) Schematic illustration of the role of investigated proteins in the primary
  and secondary (ping-pong cycle) piRNA biogenesis. In the primary pathway, long,
  single-stranded transcripts (black) produced from piRNA clusters are processed by
  the endonuclease activity of mitochondrial protein MITOPLD, generating the pre-piRNAs
  (purple) with uridine at the first nucleotide position (1U) and are loaded onto
  MILI, a Nuage protein [, , ]. At these stages, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein
  MAEL binds piRNA precursors and delivers them to pi-bodies that contain MILI and
  its binding partner TDRD1 [, ]. The 3’ end of pre- piRNAs is trimmed by a nuclease,
  PNLDC1, and modified by the methyltransferase HEN1 to generate mature primary piRNAs
  (blue). The mature primary piRNAs guide MILI to slice their complementary target
  RNAs such as retrotransposons transcripts and these processes cause the production
  of a series of secondary piRNAs (green) that associate with MILI and also MIWI2
  (ping-pong cycle) [,]. MIWI2 and its interaction partner TDRD9 are found in piP
  bodies and don’t have a slicer activity, but the MIWI2–piRNA complexes can regulate
  gene transcription by epigenetic mechanisms including histone modification and DNA
  methylation of target genes [, ]. (B) Effects of OS on the expression of Tdrd9,
  Tdrd1, Mael, Mitopld, Mili, and Miwi. 1–2 (↓), 2–4 (↓↓), 4–8 (↓↓↓), and 8–15 (↓↓↓↓)
  times significantly decrease in the expression levels of studied genes compared
  to control.
