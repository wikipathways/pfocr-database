caption: RNA virus is induced by exogenous RNA and cytoplasmic dsRNA, which activates
  the MAVS signaling pathway. However, USP35 inhibits the MAVS-TBK1-IRF3 signaling
  pathway through its deubiquitinating activity, thereby attenuating the production
  of type I interferons. The schematic was created using the Figdraw website
