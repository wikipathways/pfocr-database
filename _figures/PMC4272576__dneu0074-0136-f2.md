caption: Candidate genes influenced by Zn2+ or involved in Zn2+signaling and metal
  ion homeostasis associated with the development of ASDs. In the extracellular space,
  receptors like NMDAR and TrkB bind Zn2+. Intracellular Zn2+ is mostly bound to metal-binding
  proteins of which the metallothionein family (MTs) is the most abundant. MTs are
  cysteine-containing proteins with high affinity for Zn2+. Additionally, Zn2+ can
  associate with the SAM domains of ProSAP1/Shank2 and ProSAP2/Shank3. Downstream
  signals, including the Erk1/2 MAP kinase pathway, are activated by Zn2+ and Zn2+
  is an essential co-factor for MTF-1, a transcription factor binding to metal response
  elements in the promoter region of genes. COMMD1 and ZnT5 might have a role in the
  general regulation of Zn2+ levels, given that ZnT5 is a Zn2+ transporter expressed
  in enterocytes and COMMD1 influences the intracellular Cu2+ which, in turn, affects
  Zn2+ homeostasis.
