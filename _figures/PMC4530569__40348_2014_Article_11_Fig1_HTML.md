caption: Life and death of proteins. Proteins are synthesized as a linear amino acid
  chain at the ribosomes and fold into their native structure with the assistance
  of chaperones. Misfolded proteins in the cytosol or in cellular compartments, such
  as ER and mitochondria, are recognized by chaperones which support their refolding
  into the native structure. If misfolded proteins cannot be properly refolded, they
  are targeted for degradation mainly by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. For proteasomal
  degradation, proteins are tagged with a polyubiquitin chain and subsequently degraded
  by the proteasome into small peptides. Misfolded proteins of the ER or at the mitochondria
  are retro-translocated into the cytosol and transported to the proteasome for degradation
  with the help of VCP/p97. Aggregated proteins are engulfed by the autophagosome
  and degraded after fusion of lysosomes with the autophagosome. Degradation products
  of the proteasome and the autophagy pathway are mainly recycled as amino acids for
  protein synthesis.
