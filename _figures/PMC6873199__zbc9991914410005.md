caption: Schematic of the proposed enzymatic pathway involved in the assembly of rhamnan
  and PSP of L. lactis NZ9000. Left side, rhamnan. Rhamnan is synthesized intracellularly
  by an ABC-dependent pathway, initiated by the addition of GlcNAc-P on Und-P by TagO.
  The four enzymes RmlA, -B, -C, and -D are known to be involved in rhamnose precursor,
  dTDP-l-Rha, synthesis. Then the rhamnosyltransferase RgpA transfers the first rhamnosyl
  residue on the GlcNAc-P-P-Und lipid intermediate acceptor, and the chain is further
  elongated by two other rhamnosyltransferases, RgpB and RgpF, to reach an average
  length of 33 Rha residues (corresponding to 11 repeating units) and terminated by
  GlcNAc addition by RgpE. Together, RgpC and RgpD, constituting an ABC transporter,
  catalyze the transfer of the rhamnan chain to the outer side of the cytoplasmic
  membrane. Following export, the rhamnan is most probably anchored covalently to
  peptidoglycan acceptor sites, via a phosphodiester linkage to N-acetylmuramic acid
  (MurNAc) (or GlcNAc) residues of the glycan chains, with LcpA being the main ligase
  involved. Right side, PSP. Synthesis starts by transfer of GlcNAc on Und-P by WpsA/WpsB.
  The repeat unit is then synthesized on the GlcNAc-P-Und lipid precursor at the intracellular
  face of the cytoplasmic membrane by the successive addition of Rha, GlcNAc, Glc-P,
  and Galf catalyzed by the glycosyltransferases WpsC, WpsD, WpsE, and WpsF with UDP-Galf
  formed from UDP-Gal by Glf. According to our data,6 the last sugar of the hexasaccharide
  repeat unit, the side-chain Glc, is added, presumably outside the cytoplasmic membrane,
  by a three-component glycosylation mechanism encoded outside the cwps cluster. The
  linear pentasaccharidic PSP repeat unit is flipped to the outside of the cytoplasmic
  membrane by the flippase WpsG. It is then polymerized by WpsI with WpsH as a putative
  copolymerase and/or chain-length regulator. Finally, WpsJ is involved in the transfer
  of the PSP onto rhamnan.
