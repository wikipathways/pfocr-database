caption: Factors produced in the obese breast microenvironment contribute to the growth
  of breast cancer. Obesity-induced changes to breast adipose tissue results in increased
  secretion of inflammatory mediators (e.g. PGE2, TNF, IL-6) and estradiol along with
  altered adipokine production. These factors act in a paracrine manner on breast
  tumor cells growing within this milieu to increase proliferation and decrease apoptosis.
  For example, PGE2 signals through EP receptors on tumor cells to activate PKA, which,
  in turn, stimulates CREB translocation to the nucleus and transcription of genes
  that promote cell growth. PGE2 also activates the PI3K pathway resulting in inhibition
  of FOXO1 and activation of mTOR via AKT, netting a decrease in apoptosis and increase
  in protein synthesis, a necessary precursor of cell growth. Both AKT and TNF signaling
  activate IKK leading to expression and translocation of transcription factor NFκB
  to the nucleus. IL-6 and leptin bind their respective receptors to activate JAK2/STAT3
  signaling which promotes nuclear transcription of programs that enhance cell proliferation.
  Leptin also activates MAPK signaling which can lead to ligand-independent activation
  of the estrogen receptor (ER). Ligand-dependent (through binding of estradiol) or
  ligand-independent activation of ER causes receptor dimerization and binding to
  estrogen response elements (ERE) on target genes. Adiponectin signals through its
  receptor to activate AMPK signaling resulting in downstream inhibition of mTOR,
  which decreases proliferation. This inhibitory effect on cell proliferation is diminished
  in obesity due to decreased adiponectin production by obese breast adipose tissue.
