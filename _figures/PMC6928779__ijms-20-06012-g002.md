caption: Overview of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
  activation and the biological consequences. Activation of AMPK is determined by
  the balance of (1) AMP/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio, (2) upstream kinase activity,
  and (3) upstream phosphatase activity. Once activated, AMPK activates catabolic
  pathways such as glycolysis, beta-oxidation of fatty acids, and autophagy, as well
  as suppresses anabolic pathway such as gluconeogenesis and lipid/protein synthesis
  to increase ATP levels. LKB1, liver kinase B1; STRAD, ste-20 related adaptor; MO25,
  mouse protein 25; CaMKKβ, CaMKK Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase
  β; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PP2C, protein phosphatase 2C; KD, kinase domain;
  AID, auto-inhibitory domain; CTD, C-terminal domain; CBM, carbohydrate-binding module;
  Myr, myristoylation; CBS, cystathionine beta synthase.
