caption: Asiatic acid (AA)-mediated Nrf2 signaling pathway protects lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS)/d-galactosamine (GalN)-induced fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) via inhibition
  of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. (AA) can induce AMP-activated protein
  kinase and GSK3β activation, which contributes to upregulation of the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway and results in the expression of abundant antioxidant genes. Furthermore,
  AA not only reduces LPS/d-GalN-induced reactive oxygen species overproduction but
  also inhibits NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway
  activation dependent upon induction of PDCD4 protein expression. These processes
  play significant roles in suppressing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses
  to alleviate FHF.
