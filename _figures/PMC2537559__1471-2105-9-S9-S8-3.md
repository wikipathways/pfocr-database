caption: Glycolysis pathway. In spite of the fragmentary nature of the composed meta-set,
  the Warburg effect is still reflected in the pathway map through increased abundance
  of lactate dehydrogenase (LDHB). Relative change and direction of change in transcript
  abundance of differentially expressed are marked with color flags. Red color designates
  higher and blue color designates lower transcript abundance compared to average
  between primary tumor (1) and metastatic samples (2). The legend for GeneGo pathway
  maps is given in Supplemental Figure 6 (Additional File ).
