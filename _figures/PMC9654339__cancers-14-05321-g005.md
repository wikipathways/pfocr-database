caption: Summary of PCa knockout models driven by MYC and Wnt signaling pathways.
  Myc family oncoproteins, including c-Myc, N-Myc, and L-Myc, function as growth-promoting
  transcription factors when expressed in a deregulated fashion. Myc proteins form
  homodimers with themselves, or as heterodimers with other proteins that share similar
  structures, before associating with specific DNA response elements. Max, whose levels
  are increased through the actions of the PI3K pathway, is one protein that associates
  with Myc. Together, Myc and Max promote advance through the cell cycle by stimulating
  Cyclin D2/CDK4 and inhibiting p27Kip1. In canonical Wnt signaling, Wnt binds to
  the Frizzled receptor family, and the β-catenin destruction complex (which includes
  Axin, APC, and GSK-3β) is inhibited. The levels of β-catenin accumulate, and β-catenin
  complexes with DNA binding proteins termed Tcf/Lef, which together enable expression
  of genes that favor cell survival and proliferation. In non-canonical Wnt signaling,
  STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) is activated in response
  to the binding of Wnt to Frizzled receptors. Proteins such as Abi1 inhibit STAT3
  from entering the nucleus and acting as an oncogenic transcription factor []. Created
