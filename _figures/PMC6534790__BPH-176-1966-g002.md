caption: Coagulation factors and their connection to monocyte activation. This figure
  illustrates the contact phase as well as the tissue factor (TF) pathway of coagulation
  in a simplified fashion. The framed drug names indicate pharmaceuticals that have
  already been shown to effectively prevent or treat thrombotic disease in clinical
  trials. The coagulation factors TF, FII and FXIII are encircled by the star symbol
  because they are either expressed by monocytes or have a direct effect on monocyte
  functionality with regard to hypertension. vWF, von Willebrand factor.
