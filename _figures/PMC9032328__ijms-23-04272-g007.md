caption: A schematic model of the cross-talks between H2S and salicylic acid (SA),
  jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) in plant defense against pathogens. The biotrophic
  pathogen attacks plants and secretes effectors into plant cells. The conversion
  of O-Acetylserine into L-Cysteine (L-Cys) is catalyzed by Anthranilate synthase
  (OAS-A1). Similarly, effectors also induce the biosynthesis of L- Cys. The plant
  cytosol contains the enzyme L-cysteine desulfhydrase (DES1), which is responsible
  for L-Cys decomposition and endogenous H2S production. The higher concentration
  of H2S triggers the upregulation of SA biosynthesis-related genes (PAD4/EDS1). The
  enzyme ICS1 catalyzes the conversion of chorismite into isochorismate, which is
  then exported to the cytosol by EDS5. The L-glutamate is converted into isochorismate-9-glutamate
  in the cytosol by PBS3. Subsequently, SA is produced from isochorismate-9-glutamate
  through spontaneous decay. By acting as an isochorismate A pyruvoyl-glutamate lyase
  (IPGL), EPS1 also degrades N-pyruvoyl-L-glutamate to create SA. The NPR1 gene expression
  is aided by SA due to the interaction of WRKY transcription factors with NPR1, which
  promotes the recruitment of CDK8 to the NPR1 promoter’s W-box. Pathogen-induced
  defense signals enhance the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) in plants by enhancing
  the expression of Isochorismate Synthase (ICS) genes. In addition, SA promotes redox
  reactions that lead to the reduction of NPR1 oligomers to monomers. The monomeric
  NPR1 molecules move from the cytosol to the nucleus, where they form a protein complex
  with transcription factor (TGA), EDS1, SA, and CDK8, resulting in the transcription
  of PR genes. A higher concentration of H2S upregulates the JA biosynthetic gene
  LOX3. Moreover, the exogenous application of JA also increases the endogenous H2S
  and JA. The secreted effectors by biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens trigger
  the pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which further activate the plant mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MEK1/2) cascades. H2S and JA participate in phosphorylation of MEK1/2,
  subsequently triggering MPK4. The MPK4 activates the MPK3/MPK6 and MKS1 (the substrate
  of MPK4). WRKY33 is involved in the biosynthesis of camalexin (a phytoalexin). MPK3/MPK6
  phosphorylate the WRKY33 and increase its transactivation activity. The WRKY33 forms
  a complex with MKS1 for the transcription of PAD3, which activates the biosynthesis
  of camalexin. In the elicited cells, JA-Ile COI1, an F-box protein in the SCF ubiquitin
  E3 ligase complex, recognizes JA-Ile and facilitates the binding between COI1 and
  the JAZ family of repressor proteins, resulting in JAZs being ubiquitinated. The
  26S proteasome then degrades the ubiquitinated JAZs. JAZ degradation promotes downstream
  JA responses by releasing the target transcription factor (MYC2) from inhibition.
  The Mediator25 binds to the MYC2 to enhance the transcriptional activity of wound-responsive
  gene VSP1. H2S molecules work as a repressor for ethylene signaling. In response
  to the effectors of the necrotrophic pathogen, the ethylene biosynthesis genes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
  acid synthase (ACS), 1-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid (ACC) are activated,
  resulting in the formation of ethylene. Under normal growth conditions with low
  ethylene levels, the Ethylene receptor 1 (ERT1) remains in the active state and
  associates with CTR1, which, in turn, inhibits the downstream signaling pathway.
  The ethylene binding inactivates its receptors and in turn deactivates the Raf-like
  kinase CTR1. Consequentially, EIN2 can function and signal positively downstream
  to the ethylene insensitive 3 (EIN3) of transcription factors situated in the nucleus.
  EIN3 drives the expression of ethylene response factor (ERF1). Subsequently, the
  ERF1 binds to the GCC box and invokes the PDF1.2 defense gene.
