caption: Metabolic changes in M1 and M2 macrophages. This illustration depicts various
  changes in biochemical pathways that occur during metabolic reprogramming of the
  macrophages. Note that this illustration as well as all the others in this review
  were built on universal biochemical pathways, to which the various antibacterial
  pathways of the macrophage have been added. All drawings were created with the help
  of BioRender.com
