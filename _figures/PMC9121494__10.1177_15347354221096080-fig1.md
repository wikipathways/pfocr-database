caption: Hypothesized models of circadian rhythm genes in mammals. The CLOCK and NPAS2
  form heterodimers with BMAL1. These heterodimers act as enhancer e-box elements
  upstream of transcription factors binding target genes to activate transcription
  of other core circadian genes like the PER family (PER1, PER2, PER3) and CRY family
  (CRY1, CRY2).,CLOCK and NPAS2 can also trans-activate the expression of other pathway
  components, such as NR1D1, NR1D2 (also known as Rev-ERB), RORA, RORB, and RORC.
  RORA/RORB activates transcription of ARNTL, whereas NR1D1 and NR1D2 repress it,
  which further increases the regulatory level of CLOCK/NPAS2 activity., Heterodimers
  of PER and CRY proteins activate a negative feedback loop that acts directly on
  CLOCK and NPAS2,
