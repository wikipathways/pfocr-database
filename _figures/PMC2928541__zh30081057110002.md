caption: Wnt signaling pathway. In the absence of Wnt, cytosolic β-catenin is phosphorylated
  by GSK3β. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and axin complex with GSK3β and β-catenin
  to enhance this destruction process. Phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by the
  ubiquitin ligase βTrCP, ubiquinated, and degraded. Hence the Wnt signaling is in
  an “off” state (left). Wnts bind both Frizzled and LRP5/6 receptors to initiate
  GRK5/6-mediated LRP phosphorylation as well as dishevelled/β-arrestin-mediated Frizzled
  internalization. Dishevelled membrane translocation and phosphorylation leads to
  dissociation of the axin/APC/GSK3β destruction complex. Hence β-catenin phosphorylation
  is inhibited and it accumulates in the cytosol. The accumulated cytosolic β-catenin
  translocates into the nucleus to bind to LEF/TCFs cotranscription factors, which
  results in the Wnt-responsive gene transcription (right). Fzd, Frizzled; GBP, GSK3β
  binding proteins; DVL, Dishevelled; βarr, β-arrestin; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor
  kinase.
