caption: Summary model of Tri-DAP activity and pathway utilization in HCMV-infected
  cells. (A) A model depicting the signaling events observed with Tri-DAP alone in
  control HFFs showing IKKα-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
  NF-κB p65. (B) The cumulative effect of Tri-DAP stimulation and HCMV on NF-κB and
  IRF3 in control and IKKβ KD cells. (C) In IKKα KD cells, nuclear translocation of
  IKKα and NF-κB p65 is mostly inhibited, and there is only minimal infection-driven
  translocation of IRF3.
