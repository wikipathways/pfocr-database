caption: 'Genes were categorized as related when co-cited in the same sentence with
  a functional descriptor in-between. We identified 41 genes clustering around fibronectin
  1 (FN1) (Cluster 1), ADAMTS-like 1 (ADAMTSL1) (Cluster 2), and endothelin 1 (EDN1)
  (Cluster 3).Note. Genes with corresponding SNPs achieving a nominal significant
  replication in the STAR*D sample shaded in red; green line indicates transcription
  factor binding site match in target promoter; line with yellow mark indicates annotation
  by Molecular Connections experts. IN := input gene; TF: = transcription factor;
  M := part of a metabolic pathway.'
