caption: 'Schematic presentation of the hypothesized model of tAVNRT (A, B), effect
  of a VhoSESt during tAVNRT (C), and the order of manipulating Abl catheter (D).
  A: ASp conduction curve is hypothesized to be a sigmoid conduction curve. B: P1,
  P2, P3, P4, and P5 were located on the circuit of tAVNRT and P6 was located outside
  of the tAVNRT circuit. TCL was defined as the summation of the conduction time of
  a, b, c, d, and e. C: TCL, CI, and RC(n + 1) were measured and ΔPM and ΔPL were
  calculated. The electrograms drawn by the black broken line show the expected electrogram
  location in a case without VhoSESt. D: Abl catheter was moved sequentially from
  ① to ⑧ until a successful ablation was achieved. Asp, antegrade slow pathway; AFp,
  antegrade fast pathway; RFp, retrograde fast pathway; AVN, atrioventricular node;
  Abl, ablation; VhoSESt, very high‐output single extrastimulation; P1, site of RA
  capture by a VhoSESt delivered from Abl catheter; P2, junctional site between RA
  and ASp; P3, site of ASp capture by a VhoSESt delivered from Abl catheter; P4, turnaround
  site between ASp and RFp in AVN; P5, junctional site between RFp and RA; P6, any
  point in atrium and coronary sinus (CS) located away from ASp; HB, His bundle; TCL,
  tachycardia cycle length; CI, coupling interval, RC, return cycle; RC(n) = interval
  between VhoSESt and onset of QRS wave; RC(n + 1) = interval between VhoSESt and
  onset of A wave recorded at Abl catheter; Int(n − 1, n) = interval between the onset
  of QRS wave of n − 1 and n beats; Int(n, n + 1) = interval between the onset of
  QRS wave of n and n + 1 beats; ΔPM, prematurity of VhoSESts [= TCL − CI]; ΔPL, prolongation
  of return cycle [= RC(n + 1) − TCL]; TCL, tachycardia cycle length; TT, tendon of
  Todaro; TA, tricuspid annulus; CSos, CS ostium'
