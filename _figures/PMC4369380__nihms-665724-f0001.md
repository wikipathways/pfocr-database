caption: (A) After engagement of LFA-1, lytic granules in NK cells converge on the
  MTOC through the minus-end–directed function of the dynein motor complex and signaling
  by Src family kinases (, ). This process can also be activated by stimulating NK
  cells with interleukin-2 (IL-2) (). Zhang et al. demonstrated that the activation
  of ILK, leupaxin, Pyk2, and CLIP-170 in response to LFA-1 engagement was specifically
  required for the convergence of NK cell lytic granules on the MTOC. Although other
  NK cell–activating receptors promote convergence, the unbiased subtractive proteomics
  performed by Zhang et al. has defined these signals as at least minimally required
  by LFA-1 in inducing convergence function, which thus distinguishes them from those
  involved in the general activation of NK cells by CD16. ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion
  molecule–1. (B) Engagement of LFA-1 also stimulates the polarization of lytic granules
  and the MTOC to the immunological synapse in NK cells. Polarization of the MTOC
  is likely to depend on synaptic dynein through microtubule end-capture shrinkage
  (). Zhang et al. determined that a limited set of signals partially overlapping
  with those involved in convergence are necessary downstream of LFA-1 to promote
  polarization. Again, the subtractive proteomics eliminated signals common to general
  NK cell activation by CD16. For granule polarization to the immunological synapse,
  LFA-1 engagement caused the recruitment of ILK into close proximity with the cytoplasmic
  tail of the β2 subunit of LFA-1, which further activated the downstream signaling
  molecules γ-parvin, Leupaxin, RhoGEF7, and Pyk2. RhoGEF7, a direct activator of
  Cdc42, and Pyk2, an indirect activator of Cdc42 (through inhibition of RhoGAP proteins),
  then stimulate activation of the Cdc42 signaling pathway, which establishes cell
  polarity during cell migration and division (). Within the Cdc42 signaling pathway,
  Par6, APC, and CLIP-170 are required for the polarization of granules and the MTOC
  in human NK cells. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
