caption: 5-HT7 and 5-HT1A receptor signaling pathways and oligo/heterodimer formation.
  5-HT7 receptor monomers (in yellow) can form homodimers or homoligomers, with the
  same signaling pathways and cellular effects. 5-HT7 can also form heterodimers or
  heteroligomers with 5-HT1A (in teal), resulting in the inhibition of the 5-HT1Asignaling
  pathway, with no net effect downstream of 5-HT7. When activated, 5-HT7 activates
  Gas (canonical pathway) with a subsequent signaling cascade that results in the
  activation of ERK (also known as MAPK) and Akt; in contrast, the activation of Ga12
  activates mTOR and different Rho family small GTPases. As illustrated, the phosphorylation
  of Trkb is mediated by both G proteins. AC adenylate cyclase, cAMP cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate, Cdc42 cell division control protein 42 homolog, ERK extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases, MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinases, mTOR mammalian
  target of rapamycin, Trkb Tropomyosin receptor kinase B
