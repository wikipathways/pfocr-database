caption: 'Signal pathways associated with lung adenocarcinoma. The blue nodes are
  the eight driver genes in the signaling pathway identified under k = 10. Rectangular
  nodes indicate a specific biological function, and the line between nodes indicates
  the interaction between them: the arrow indicates an activation relationship between
  the two nodes; the “T” connector line indicates an inhibitory relationship between
  the two nodes'
