caption: Sensory processing is associated with autism functionally, in the context
  of ion transport and cholinergic signaling. Acetylcholine regulates both the ion
  transport and the GABA signaling. A deficiency in its precursor, dietary choline,
  may impact ion transport, GABA⇒GABBR1 signaling, and KCNN2/SK2 channel function,
  either or all of which may result in altered sensory processing function.
