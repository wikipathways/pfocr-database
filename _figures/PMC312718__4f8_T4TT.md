caption: Schematic representation of the genetic pathway that regulates specification
  and differentiation of the slow muscle fibers. Hh proteins from the midline signal
  to the paraxial mesodermal cells by a Gli-dependent mechanism. This results in the
  induction of general markers of Hh response–like ptc1 and in the induction of myogenesis
  through the expression of myogenic regulatory genes in the most proximal cells,
  the adaxial cells. We propose that Hh signaling also induces the expression of the
  ubo gene in these cells, which allows them to interpret this signal and adopt the
  slow fiber-specific developmental program. In a separate inductive event, Hh signaling
  acts to induce high levels of Engrailed (Eng) expression in the muscle pioneer (MP)
  precursors. The requirement of the homeobox gene prox1 is restricted to the final
  stages for terminal differentiation of the slow fibers.
