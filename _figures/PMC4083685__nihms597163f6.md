caption: LPS induces the recruitment of TLR4 to lipid rafts which forms a functional
  complex with CD14 leading to the activation of NF-κB. 4F treatment of cells disrupts
  lipid rafts thus preventing the formation of the TLR4-CD14 complex and activation
  of cells by LPS. LPS may still bind to phospholipids (PLs) in the membrane but due
  to disruption of the lipid rafts, a functional ligand-receptor complex formation
  is impaired.
