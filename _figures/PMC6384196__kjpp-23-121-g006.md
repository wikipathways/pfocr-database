caption: There are two pathways underlying glutamate toxicity mechanism integrated
  in parallel in neurons; receptor-mediated excitotoxicity pathway and nonreceptor-mediated
  oxidative stress pathway. Increases of intracellular Ca2+ and ROS are triggering
  events in mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction and neuronal cell death against glutamate
  toxicity. Glutamate-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase is evoked mainly through
  NMDAR and G protein-coupled mGluR. Intracellular glutamate-induced ROS generation
  is induced through NOX and cystine/glutamate antiporters in the initial state. DEK
  exerted neuroprotective activities against glutamate toxicity through direct ROS
  scavenging and activation of the Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway as a cellular anti-oxidant defense
  system in this study. Reference numbers are shown in the known signaling pathways.
