caption: Speculative model linking the regulation of Hsp90 by Hsf1 to morphogenesis
  in fungal pathogens. Hsf1 activates Hsp90 in response to temperature upshifts and
  promotes thermal homeostasis in C. albicans via Hsp90 and other factors. Hsp90 negatively
  regulates hyphal development in C. albicans (Ca). Temperature upshifts also induce
  HSP90 expression in C. neoformans (Cn), H. capsulatum (Hc) and P. brasiliensis (Pb)–
  and promote yeast growth rather than hyphal development in these fungi. This raises
  the possibility that Hsp90 might also regulate morphogenesis in these pathogenic
  fungi (see text). According to this model, at 25°C free Hsp90 would inhibit hyphal
  development in C. albicans (such that it grows in the yeast form), but promote hyphal
  growth in the other pathogens. Following a temperature shift to 37°C, Hsp90 would
  become sequestered for protein folding thereby mediating thermal adaptation. This
  sequestration would lead to the dissociation of Hsp90 from its as yet unidentified
  client on the Ras-PKA pathway, thereby derepressing hyphal development in C. albicans.
  In contrast, in the other pathogens this would remove hyphal activation leading
  to their growth in the yeast form. It should be noted that while the yeast forms
  of C. neoformans, H. capsulatum and P. brasiliensis are pathogenic, both the yeast
  and hyphal forms of C. albicans contribute to pathogenesis.
