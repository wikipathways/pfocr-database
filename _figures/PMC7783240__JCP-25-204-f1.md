caption: (A) In normal cells, Sox17 protein binds to β-Cat which is an essential factor
  in the Wnt signaling pathway, and in turn inhibits the transcription activity of
  the β-Cat/TCF complex which normally induces Wnt-dependent gene expression. (B)
  In various cancer cells, the expression of Sox17 is downregulated by methylation
  of its promoter, and the β-Cat/TCF complex induces expression of Wnt-dependent genes.
  Regulatory factors for increased methylation in the Sox17 gene promoter are not
  identified. LRP, lipoprotein receptor-related protein; Wnt, Wingless-related integration
  site; GSK3-β, glycogen synthetase 3β; β-Cat, β-catenin; Sox, Sry-related high mobility
  group box; TCF, T-cell factor.
