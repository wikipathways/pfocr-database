caption: Simplified diagram of the plant endomembrane trafficking pathways. Protein
  synthesis and modification takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Transportation
  of the proteins from the ER to the Golgi is essential for the correct protein conformation.
  Additional modifications and sorting of the proteins to the extracellular space-plasma
  membrane (PM), storage and lytic organelles is accomplished by the Golgi. Proteins
  can also be sorted from the Golgi to the chloroplast. The vesicles are transported
  to the prevacuolar compartment (PVC), which represents an intermediate compartment
  that is essential for proteins to reach the vacuole. The trans-Golgi network (TGN)
  is an interface between the exocytic (Exo) and endocytic (Endo) pathways. COPII
  proteins facilitate ER protein export, and COPI proteins control the retrograde
  pathway. Cargo addressed for the protein-storage vacuole is transferred from the
  ER to the intermediate compartment PAC (Precursor-Accumulating Compartment). The
  SAR1 and ARF1 GTPases are indicated in anterograde and retrograde transport, respectively
  (modified from []).
