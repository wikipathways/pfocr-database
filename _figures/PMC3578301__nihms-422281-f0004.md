caption: In mammals, there are four Notch receptors, Notch 1–4, and five Notch ligands,
  Jagged (Jag) 1 and 2, and Delta-like (Dll) 1, 3, and 4. When a Notch interacts with
  a Notch ligand, the γ-secretase complex proteolytically releases the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD). NICD translocates into the nucleus, where it displaces a co-repressor
  complex from CSL and recruits a co-activator complex leading to Notch-dependent
  gene transcription. CSL-independent functions of NICD have been also reported. The
  Notch pathway has been proposed to govern differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells
  into each of the Th fates by directly controlling the expression of unique master
  regulatory transcription factors and hallmark cytokines. An alternative view is
  that the Notch pathway does not directly instruct Th fate decisions but regulates
  the basal T-cell activation, T-cell expansion and survival, and cytokine production
  of differentiated Th cells upon secondary stimulation.
