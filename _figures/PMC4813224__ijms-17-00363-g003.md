caption: 'Schematic representation of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS)-negative
  cell death induced by arginine deprivation. In ASS-negative cells, arginine cannot
  synthesize so arginine depletion by ADI or arginase would induce a quick response
  of cell autophagy by the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) or MEK-ERK pathway.
  Autophagy could recycle limited arginine and prevent apoptosis as a survival response
  in the short term. Instead, in long-term arginine deprivation, autophagy would contribute
  to caspase-independent (CASP-IND) cell death and caspase dependent (CASP-DEP) apoptosis
  could also happen. The dashed lines ( and ) means the reactions are dependent on
  the availability of enzymes (panel A) or the reactions have not yet confirmed by
  experiments (panel B). MEK: mitogen-activated protein kinase, also known as extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase.'
