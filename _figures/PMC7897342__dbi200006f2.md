caption: Overview of the role of the ATF/CREB family in the pathway involved in hepatic
  lipid metabolism. The ATF/CREB family members transduce various nutrient and energy
  signals into the nucleus and modulate hepatic lipid metabolism via regulating expression
  of key enzymes and regulators involved in lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and
  lipoprotein metabolism. ATF4 is activated by the PERK-eIF2α axis of the ER stress
  response. ATF4 increases lipogenesis via promoting expression of SREBP-1c and PPARγ,
  the key transcription factors involved in lipid synthesis. ATF4 activates fatty
  acid oxidation via stimulating the expression of FGF21 and Sphk2. ATF6 is stimulated
  by nutrient overload and translocates into the nucleus to suppress expression of
  SREBP-1c, PPARγ, and SREBP-2, which control lipid synthesis. In cooperation with
  PPARα, ATF6 also elevates fatty acid oxidation by enhancing CPT1α and FGF21. Upon
  acetylation and activation by PCAF, CREBH associates with LXR to induce expression
  of Fsp27β, leading to increased hepatic lipid accumulation. CREBH elevates expression
  of CPT1α and FGF21 to enhance hepatic fatty acid oxidation interacting with PPARα.
  Moreover, CREBH lowers plasma lipid levels and maintains lipoprotein homeostasis
  by upregulating expression of Apoa2, Apoa4, and Apoa5. CREBZF couples the insulin
  signal to promote the cleavage and expression of SREBP-1c via interacting with ATF4,
  thereby stimulating de novo lipogenesis. Ac-CoA, acetyl-CoA; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
  CPT1α, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 2α; FFA, free fatty acid; FGF21, fibroblast growth factor 21; Fsp27β, fat-specific
  protein 27β; PCAF, p300-CBP–associated factor; PERK, protein kinase R-like ER kinase;
  PPARα, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator–activated
  receptor γ; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1; Sphk2, sphingosine kinase; TG, triglyceride.
