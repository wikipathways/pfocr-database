caption: Anaerobic pathway under TMAO and fumarate reduction conditions, determined
  via isotopomer path tracing. The black dots denote the possible 13C-enriched positions
  in the key metabolites, and the white dots denote the carbon positions not enriched
  with 13C. The numbers below the dots are the fractions of the particular metabolites
  under TMAO reduction conditions, and the numbers above the dots are the fractions
  of the metabolites under fumarate reduction conditions. The proposed pathway model
  contains a serine degradation route and a TCA cycle (containing two different conditions).
  Under TMAO reduction conditions, net flux was through a complete TCA cycle (succinate
  originating from 2-ketoglutarate would not be expected to be labeled, while succinate
  originating from isocitrate would be expected to be labeled on its carboxyl group);
  under fumarate reduction conditions, there are two anapleurotic fluxes (OXA→fumarate→succinate
  and citrate→OXO), and the existence of a complete TCA cycle is in question given
  the lack of evidence for an OXO→succinate reaction. See the legend to Fig.  for
  abbreviations.
