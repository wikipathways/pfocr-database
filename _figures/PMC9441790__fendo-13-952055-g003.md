caption: Fluid flow flip the switch from canonical to noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway.
  In the absence of flow, ligand binding with the Frizzled and LRP5/6 complex results
  in the inactivation of the β-catenin destruction complex (GSK3β, CK1, APC, Axin),
  led to stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin, which translocate to nucleus and
  coactivate the transcription level of LEF-TCF family. Fluid flow stimulated primary
  cilia, which is thought to increase the expression of inversin (INVS) and then reduce
  the cytoplasmic levels of dishevelled (DVL) by increasing its proteasomal degradation
  pathway. This process is deemed as switch off canonical signal pathway due to the
  activation of β-catenin destruction complex. The question mark indicate uncertainty
  as to the INVS-DVL complexes localization. The dotted box mark indicate that whether
  β-catenin is phosphorylated and ubiquitylated within the cilium is unknown.
