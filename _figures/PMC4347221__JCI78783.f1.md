caption: (A) The mechanism of proliferation and survival through the MAPK signaling
  pathway in melanoma and CLL/MBL. In mutated BRAF+ melanoma, this pathway is constitutively
  activated through the effects of the V600E mutation, which is strongly activating.
  Exposure to BRAF-inhibiting agents, such as vemurafenib, disables this pathway,
  leading to cell death. CLL and MBL have autonomous BCR signaling. In the setting
  of BRAF inhibition, drug-bound BRAF and BCR/SYK-activated RAS cooperatively induce
  paradoxical ERK activation in CLL cells, leading to proliferation and survival.
  (B) Schematic representation of the temporal association between the development
  of B cell lymphocytosis/CLL with vemurafenib exposure and its regression with removal
  of the pharmacologic agent.
