caption: Composite network presentation of the response to BPDE in normal fibroblasts.
  A PPI network was created with genes whose expression changed significantly and
  were annotated with functions most affected by BPDE exposure, namely those related
  to the cell cycle, DNA repair and stress–response as described in Materials and
  Methods. Nodes (genes) colored green were downregulated by one or more doses of
  BPDE; red were upregulated and yellow displayed complex regulation. Lighter colors
  did not fulfill the 2-fold change criteria but were identified as significant by
  SAM. Gray diamond-shaped nodes were identified as being involved in signaling by
  western blot analysis.
