caption: Proposed signaling mechanisms of adiponectin in prevention of ischemic stroke.
  Signaling through AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 can reduce formation of atheroma. AdipoR1
  activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway resulting in phosphorylation
  of protein kinase B (Akt) and activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
  Activation of Akt through calcium calmodulin kinase kinase (CAMKK), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase (PI3K), and AMPK contributes to activation of endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase (eNOS). Additionally, AMPK and VEGF also increase eNOS activity leading
  to nitric oxide (NO) production. Increase in production of NO leads to vasodilation,
  which is beneficial in prevention of atheroma and ischemia. Adiponectin signaling
  reduces vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intracellular adhesion molecule
  1 (ICAM-1), and these adhesion molecules increase atheroma size. Peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor alpha (PPARα) also reduces VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, and PPARα is activated by
  AdipoR2 signaling. PPARγ increases production of adiponectin and also leads to reduction
  of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. This figure was produced using Servier Medical Art (http://www.servier.com/).
