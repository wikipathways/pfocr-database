caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating the lidocaine-mediated anti-tumoral mechanism
  through immunogenic cell death targeting PGCCs. Lidocaine inhibited the production
  of IL-35, IL-10, and TGF-β by CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs).
  Additionally, lidocaine enhanced anti-tumor immunity by reducing PD-1 expression
  and increasing IFN-γ expression on CD8+ TIICs via the NF-κB signaling pathway. The
  lidocaine-treated CD8+ TIICs subsequently promoted the immunogenic cell death of
  primary gastric cancer cells (PGCCs). Long→: treated. Short→: linked. ┬: inhibition'
