caption: 'Spontaneous-fusion-mediated cell reprograming is controlled by β-catenin
  levels in ESCs and not by their proliferation. Wild-type ESCs and ES clones expressing
  low and high β-catenin levels fuse with Neural stem cells (NSCs) spontaneously with
  the same low efficiency. Only the hybrids formed by NSCs fused with Wnt3a-/BIO-treated
  ESCs or the E1 β-catenin clone become reprogramed and can be selected with high
  efficiency. In contrast, hybrids formed by NSCs fused with wild-type ESCs enter
  into apoptosis-mediated cell death. Interestingly, the hybrids formed by NSCs fused
  with α-8 and C2 clones, which express high levels of β-catenin, neither become reprogramed
  nor enter into apoptosis or proliferate. This is likely due to the high levels of
  p16Ink4a and p19Arf, see main text for details. Interestingly, β-catenin levels
  in ESCs modulate their ability to proliferate; however, ESC proliferation does not
  modulate cell fusion-mediated reprograming efficiency. Abbreviations: BIO, 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime;
  ES, embryonic stem; NS, neural stem.'
