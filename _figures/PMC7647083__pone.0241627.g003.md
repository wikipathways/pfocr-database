caption: Metabolic pathway map of altered metabolites in (A) leaves and (B) roots
  of arabidopsis seedlings upon endosidin-7 treatment. Backbone pathways are adapted
  from KEGG (genome.jp/kegg). Each solid arrow indicates one enzymatic step, and each
  dashed arrow indicates multiple enzymatic steps. Red arrows represent callose synthase
  and β-1,3-glucanase pathways, respectively. Grey rounded rectangles denote major
  pathways with multiple steps. Compounds in grey were not detected in the analysis,
  while dashed arrows with double cross lines indicate metabolic steps not previously
  reported in plants. Compounds in orange exhibited a significant increase; compounds
  in blue indicate a significant decrease, and compounds in black indicate no significant
  change upon endosidin-7 treatment (significant criteria p < 0.05 in multivariate
  analysis, with exceptions and details indicated in ). Chlorophyll change is inferred
  from the analysis of  and denoted by *.
