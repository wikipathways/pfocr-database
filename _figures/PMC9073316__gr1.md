caption: Whole genome duplication (WGD) underlies metabolic diversification in plants.WGD-associated
  metabolic diversification has been found for various classes of compounds in plants.
  The CYP79 gene family expansion that originated from the second major WGD of Brassicales
  laid the foundation for glucosinolate diversity in Brassicaceae (e.g. Arabidopsis
  thaliana) (; ). The differential accumulation of oleic and linoleic acids produced
  in olive (Olea europaea) compared with the closely related oil crop sesame is due
  in part to the divergence of the fatty acid desaturase FAD2 gene, generated by WGD
  (). N-methylputrescine oxidase (MPO1), required for the biosynthesis of nicotine
  in Nicotiana attenuata, is proposed to have been generated via whole-genome triplication
  in Solanaceae (). In Papaver somniferum, three genes (T6ODM, CODM, and COR) are
  likely to have been duplicated via WGD, and their encoded enzymes catalyze the final
  steps of the morphine biosynthetic pathway (). Retention and co-option of WGD-generated
  sister pathways underlie the high levels of bioactive triterpenes in Eriobotrya
  japonica (loquat) ().
