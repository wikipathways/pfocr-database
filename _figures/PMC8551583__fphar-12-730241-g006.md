caption: Schematization of G-749-induced TYRO3 degradation. G-749 releases the N-terminal
  domain of TYRO3. The intracellular C-terminal fragment is released into the cytosol
  by the γ-secretase complex. Compound E which is a γ-secretase inhibitor, inhibits
  CTF cleavage. The release of the intracellular domain was accelerated by G-749 and
  was later degraded via the proteasome pathway. As a result, cell growth is arrested
  and apoptosis is induced.
