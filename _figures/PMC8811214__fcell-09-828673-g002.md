caption: Interactions between EGFR and E-cadherin. (A) – Summary of the known effects
  of EGFR activation on E-cadherin. EGFR signalling downregulates E-cadherin (E-CAD)
  gene expression via the transcriptional repressors SNAIL and SLUG. By promoting
  phosphorylation, it also destabilizes membrane E-cadherin by reducing its affinity
  with β-catenin and the subsequent connection to the actin cytoskeleton as well as
  alters interactions between p120-catenin with RhoA. Additionally, EGFR signalling
  increases E-cadherin endocytosis by blocking Caveolin-1 activity, a negative regulator
  of the EGFR pathway itself, and promotes processing of E-cadherin into soluble E-cadherin
  (sE-cad) through activation of the Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9. Grey
  dashed lines indicate protein binding. (B) – Summary of the known effects of E-cadherin
  on EGFR. E-cadherin stabilizes EGFR at the membrane, blocks its activation by EGF
  and reduces its internalization. Through STAT3 and RanBP6, E-cadherin represses
  EGFR gene expression. Additionally, sE-Cad is an agonistic ligand of EGFR, and therefore
  E-cadherin cleavage, which is promoted by EGFR activity, positively regulates EGFR
  signalling. (C) – Model of the feedback mechanism between EGFR activity and E-cadherin;
  the negative feedback loop between the two leads to stable EGFR activation and loss
  of E-cadherin in cancer cells. Gray arrows indicate unknown mechanisms by which
  both transmembrane proteins coexist and fine-tune each other in normal tissue during
  development and homeostasis.
