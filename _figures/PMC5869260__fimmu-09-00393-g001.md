caption: Heparan sulfate induces an apoptosis/necroptosis signal pathway. (A) HS fragments
  are cleaved by heparanase from a HS proteoglycan, which is localized on the plasma
  membrane of endothelial cells. (B) Structure of HS proteoglycan. (C) HS interacts
  with a pattern recognition receptor (i.e., toll-like receptor 4) localized on the
  cell surface of cardiomyocytes and activates a pro-apoptotic intrinsic pathway.
  The signaling cascade involves phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 resulting in the release
  of mitochondrial cytochrome C, which leads to cleavage and activation of caspase
  3. In the next step of this pathway, PARP is cleaved and deactivated by activated
  caspase 3. Induction of TNF-α caused by HS inhibits the pro-apoptotic pathway and
  induces phosphorylation of RIP3 and necroptosis. These apoptosis and necroptosis
  signal pathways represent our Petri net model. White circles are places, and black
  rectangles are transitions. Unidirectional arcs indicate directed flows. Bidirectional
  arcs indicate read arcs, which influence transitions, but do not consume tokens.
