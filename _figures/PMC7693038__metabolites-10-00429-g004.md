caption: Orchestration of macrophage metabolism by NO. Macrophage metabolism switches
  to a high glycolytic status upon pro-inflammatory stimulation with increase lactate
  production, which is independent on NO and NOS2. Accumulation of metabolites like
  succinate and itaconate is a hallmark of pro-inflammatory macrophages. Treatment
  of Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) with cytokines that elicit low NO fluxes
  (es. IFNγ+IL-1β) or the beginning of a strong signal does not result in further
  metabolic characteristics. With IFNγ+TNFα or cytokine combination that produce medium
  NO concentrations or with time after a strong stimulation, macrophages undergo oxidative
  shortage most likely from an interrupted flux through PDH, underlined by decreased
  oxygen consumption rate (OCR)/extracellular acidification rates (ECAR), with responsive
  compensatory anaplerotic pathways for TCA supply, like glutaminolysis. The presence
  of high concentration of NO in LPS+IFNγ-stimulated macrophages results in further
  multiple metabolic rewirings. Entrance of carbon into TCA via PDH is halted and
  ACO2 is inhibited. Compensatory carboxylation and glutaminolysis are enhanced, leading
  to accumulation of citrate and limitation in itaconate. The lack of NADH and reduced
  substrates generated by the broken TCA cycle leads to inactive mitochondrial complexes
  and suppressed OXPHOS, with significant appreciable drops in OCR and full commitment
  to glycolysis. In turn, β -oxidation of fatty acids (FA) is strongly decreased,
  leading to esterification of intracellular FA with glycolytic-derived glycerol for
  the synthesis of triglycerides and neutral lipids. In absence of NO (a situation
  represented by Nos2−/− LPS+IFNγ -stimulated BMDMs), higher glycolysis is maintained,
  PDH and ACO2 are intact and mitochondrial ETC displays full function. In this scenario,
  production of itaconate is strongly increased. The arrows represent the general
  direction of the metabolic flow in the system with the specific contribution of
  glucose and glutamine. The red color for arrows/ metabolites represents higher flux
  of depicted pathway/ increase in metabolite levels upon respective condition, compared
  to macrophage resting state. PDH pyruvate dehydrogenase; ACO2 mitochondrial aconitase;
