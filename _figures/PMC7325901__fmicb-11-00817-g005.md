caption: Idealized primordial metabolism for a hydrogenotrophic acetogen (see text).
  The carbon pathways are taken from Figure 6 of ; the amino acid biosynthetic families
  are taken from ; the energy investment (dotted arrows at top) is taken from ; the
  24:1 carbon ratio for energy metabolism versus cell mass accumulation is taken from
  ; the ATP per acetate is taken from ). For fairness,  also reported that 0.3 mol
  of the carbon was unrecovered, which is neglected here. Numbers next to arrows in
  carbon pathways are from  and indicate the approximate percentage of flux. Relative
  width of carbon flux arrows is drawn roughly to scale, including the large gray
  arrow at left, to underscore the relative flux of material through the cell (large)
  versus the residue that remains (small). The acetyl CoA pathway roughly as indicated
  in  resides within the large gray arrow and is not shown in detail.
