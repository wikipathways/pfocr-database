caption: (A) PG synthesis potential is dictated by the activity of the elongasome
  in collaboration with aPBPs. Cell wall stress activates σM (left), which up-regulates
  both pathways. In the absence of aPBPs, cells up-regulate elongasome activity through
  σI, which increases expression of genes (mreBH and lytE) important for elongasome
  function. Synthetic lethal relationships are shown here between deletion of ponA
  and genes in the σIpathway (black circles). Bypass of synthetic lethality can be
  compensated by a gain of function mutation in walK (star). (B) The promoter regions
  of sigI, mreBH and lytE are shown, depicting the binding sites of WalR and σI as
  annotated before (). σI and WalR act as activators for the expression of sigI and
  lytE from the σA promoter. The downstream WalR binding site is important for expression
  of sigI and lytE at 37°C whereas the upstream binding site is crucial for the heat
  induction of these genes at 51°C.
