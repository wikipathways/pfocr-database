caption: Pin1 catalyzes cis to trans conformational change of APP phosphorylated at
  T668-P and Tau phosphorylated at T231-P. In the presence of functional Pin1 (A)
  isomerization of pT668-P and pT231-P is shifted towards the trans conformation,
  which promotes non-amyloidogenic cleavage of APP and dephosphorylation of Tau. In
  Alzheimer’s disease (B), downregulation, oxidation or mutation of Pin1 reduces the
  isomerization rate that may, in the case of APP, promote the amyloidogenic pathway
  and increase Aβ production. In the case of Tau, reduced isomerization rate may promote
  aggregation of hyperphosphorylated Tau, inducing formation of NFTs and pathological
  re-entry into cell cycle.
