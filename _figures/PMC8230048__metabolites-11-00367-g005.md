caption: 'Metabolic pathway diagrams visualized by PathVisio 3. Detailed metabolic
  pathway diagrams of amino acids, organic acids, sugars, phenylpropanoids, and fatty
  acids (A); terpenoids and volatiles (B). The expression data consist of log2-transformed
  fold change (FC) values (log2FC). A log2FC value range is −1 < log2FC < 1. If log2FC
  value is higher than zero (indicated in red), metabolite content is higher in black
  rice than in red rice. If log2FC value is less than zero (indicated in green), metabolite
  content is higher in red rice than in black rice. If log2FC value is zero (indicated
  in white), metabolite content is identical in black and red rice. (BR: Black Rice,
  RR: Red Rice).'
