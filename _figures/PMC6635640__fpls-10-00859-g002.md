caption: 'Regulation of autophagy pathways in cell development of yeast (A) and plants
  (B) under normal and stress conditions. (A) This model for the mechanism of autophagy
  and its regulation has been established for yeast, where the process is triggered
  by amino acid starvation. Multiple signaling autophagy pathways converge at the
  expression and activity of autophagy genes ATG1 and ATG13. Autophagy is promoted
  by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Conversely, autophagy is inhibited by the
  target of rapamycin kinase (TOR), a central cell growth regulator that integrates
  growth factor and nutrient signals. Under nutrient sufficiency, high TOR activity
  prevents ATG13 activation by phosphorylating ATG13 Ser 757 and disrupting the interaction
  between ATG1 and ATG13. TOR, protein kinase A, AMK (AMP activated kinase), and GCN2
  (General Control Nonderepressible2) are kinases operating in autophagy signaling
  pathway. Elongation initiation factor 2α (E2Fa) and the transcription factor GCN4
  regulate expression of ATG1 and 13. (B) Potential TOR signaling pathways in Arabidopsis.
  The TOR complex, including TOR, RAPTOR, and LST8 (RAPTOR recruits substrates and
  presents them to TOR for phosphorylation, and LST8 stabilizes the TOR complex),
  senses and integrates multiple upstream signals such as nutrient starvation. TOR
  may serve as a negative regulator of autophagy. Some TOR substrates in plants have
  been identified, including: AML1 (Arabidopsis Mei2-like1, Mei2 is a meiosis signaling
  molecule that has been suggested to be a potential TOR substrate, also in yeast),
  EBP1 (ErbB – 3 epidermal growth factor receptor binding protein), S6K (ribosomal
  p70 S6 kinase), and Tap46 (a regulatory subunits of PP2A (protein 2 phosphatase
  type 2A), which is phosphorylated by TOR, suggesting that Tap46 is a direct substrate
  of TOR). These substrates may function to control translation, cell growth, and
  autophagy (modified from ).'
