caption: IRE1ɑ-XBP1 is one of the arms of UPR that polarizes tumor-infiltrating myeloid
  cells into highly immunosuppressive populations. Over activation of IRE1ɑ-XBP1 pathway
  by the byproduct adduct 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (4-HNE) in the tumor microenvironment
  (TME) shifts tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells towards a tolerogenic phenotype
  that promotes cancer cell growth. IRE1ɑ-XBP1 activation upregulates lectin-type
  oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) that converts high density anti-tumor neutrophils
  to low density immunosuppressive polymorphonuclear myeloid cells (PMN-MDSCs). IL-4
  and IL-6 signals synergize with IRE1ɑ-XBP1 to enhance the ability of tumor-associated
  macrophages to secret Cathepsin proteases, which facilitate cancer cell invasion
  and metastasis
