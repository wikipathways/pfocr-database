caption: Mechanisms for constitutive nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in cancer. (A) Somatic
  mutations in Nrf2 or Keap1 disrupt the interaction of these two proteins. In Nrf2,
  mutations affect ETGE and DLG motifs, but in Keap1 mutations are more evenly distributed.
  Furthermore, oncogene activation, such as KrasG12D, or disruption of tumor suppressors,
  such as PTEN  can lead to transcriptional induction of Nrf2 and an increase in nuclear
  Nrf2. (B) Hypermethylation of the Keap1 promoter in lung and prostate cancer leads
  to reduction of Keap1 mRNA expression, which increases the nuclear accumulation
  of Nrf2 . (C) In familial papillary renal carcinoma, the loss of fumarate hydratase
  enzyme activity leads to the accumulation of fumarate and further to succination
  of Keap1 cysteine residues (2SC). This post-translational modification leads to
  the disruption of Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 . (D)
  Accumulation of disruptor proteins such as p62 and p21 can disturb Nrf2-Keap1 binding
  and results in an increase in nuclear Nrf2. p62 binds to Keap1 overlapping the binding
  pocket for Nrf2 and p21 directly interacts with the DLG and ETGE motifs of Nrf2,
  thereby competing with Keap1 .
