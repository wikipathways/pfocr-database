caption: Thiamine biosynthetic pathway, showing protein abundance changes for the
  P. gingivalis-F. nucleatum-S. gordonii/P. gingivalis comparison. Proteins catalyzing
  each step in the pathway are shown by their P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 gene designation
  (PGN number) and protein name, where applicable. Green downward arrows indicate
  decreased abundance in the three species community. Yellow squares indicate no statistically
  significant abundance change. Empty squares indicate that the protein was not detected
  in the proteomic analysis. Thiamine diphosphate is shown in bold.
