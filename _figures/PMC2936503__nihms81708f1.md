caption: Dietary agents known to induce apoptosis by interfering with the extrinsic
  and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway, a specific ligand
  binds to its corresponding cell surface death receptor and promote the recruitment
  of adapter molecule FADD to activate caspase-8 which trigger the activation of downstream
  effector caspases such as caspase-3, thereby propagating apoptosis. The intrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis relies on the permeabilization of mitochondrial membrane to
  release the apoptogenic mitochondrial proteins which translocate to mitochondria
  where they induce the release of cytochrome c either directly or through complexes
  with membrane proteins. Cytochrome c together with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 forms
  apoptosome where activation of caspase-9 occurs. The two pathways of apoptosis merge
  as caspase-9 is capable of either directly or indirectly activating caspase-8 which
  mediates the proteolytic activation of BID. EGCG, resveratrol, curcumin, genistein,
  luteolin, lupeol, and indole-3-carbinol target the death receptor pathway whereas
  EGCG, resveratrol, apigenin, fisetin, pomegranate, delphinidin, lupeol, curcumin,
  genistein, luteolin, indole-3-carbinol, capsaicin and silibinin target the mitochondrial
  pathway of apoptosis.
