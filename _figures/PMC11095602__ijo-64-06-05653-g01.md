caption: Mechanisms of senescence-associated lymphoma progression and drug resistance.
  Multiple mechanisms of lymphomagenesis and drug resistance participate in the ageing
  environment, including DNA damage caused by chemotherapy drugs, BTK inhibitor resistance
  mediated by signalling pathways, epigenetic regulation inducing TIS, immune regulation
  restraining drug resistance in lymphoma, autophagy mediating lymphoma progression,
  and hypoxia promoting lymphoma stem cell self-renewal. SASP, senescent-associated
  secretory phenotype; SA-β-gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase; TIS, therapy-induced
  senescence; SIPS, stress-induced premature senescence; OIS, oncogene-induced senescence;
  Timp-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1; BTK, Bruton's tyrosine kinase;
  AK, aurora kinase; NHL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma; DNMTi, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors;
  EZH2, enhancer of zeste homolog 2; H3K9me3, trimethylation of histone H3 lysine
  9; PD-L1, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1; ABCC4, ATP-binding cassette transporter
  4; ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; E3, ubiquitin ligase; GATA4, GATA binding
