caption: Inflammatory response is mediated by the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, and reactive nitrogen
  species (RNS (e.g., ONOO−)) production. This is strongly associated with glia scar
  formation, pericyte cell death, and invasion of monocytes in the acute phase of
  various vascular injuries such as stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), diabetic
  retinopathy, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Heme oxygenase (HO) metabolites, such
  as carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin (BR) play a role in anti-inflammation and
  cytoprotection through inhibiting the NF-κB-mediated production of various cytokines.
  After CO treatment, CO-mediated HO-1 induction in endothelial cells (ECs) may facilitate
  angiogenesis partly via crosstalk between HO/CO and endothelial nitric oxide synthase
  (eNOS)/nitric oxide (NO). In addition, the HO metabolites CO and BR may stimulate
  neurogenesis partly via a Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated neuronal NOS (nNOS)/NO pathway
  in neural stem cells (NSCs).
