caption: 'Simplified illustration of key players of the complement system in COVID-19.
  Activation of the complement system is initiated by three distinct activation pathways
  via direct binding to pathogens/dying cells (lectin pathway), binding to immune
  complexes (classical pathway) and after toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, contact
  with various proteins, lipids and carbohydrate structures or spontaneous hydrolysis
  (alternative pathway). After binding, proteases of the classical and lectin pathway
  generate a common C3 convertase (C4b2a). The alternative pathway also acts as amplification
  pathway. Consequently, the C5 convertase cleaves C5 to bioactive fragments C5a and
  C5b. The latter forms the membrane-attack-complex (MAC), while C5a is involved in
  the recruitment of neutrophils and binding to its membrane bound receptors (C5aR).
  Abbreviations: C1-INH: C1 inhibitor; C3aR, complement component C3a receptor; C5aR1/2,
  complement component C5a receptor 1 and 2; MASP, mannose-binding lectin associated
  serine protease.'
