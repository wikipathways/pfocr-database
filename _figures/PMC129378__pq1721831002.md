caption: Tissue localization of proteins identified from the starch biosynthesis and
  degradation pathways. On functional classification of each uniquely identified protein,
  the tissue-specific protein expression was analyzed from a metabolic pathway perspective
  (Fig. 5). A focused portion of Fig. 5 is shown where the tissue-specific expression
  of the starch biosynthesis and degradation pathways is detailed. Enzymes involved
  in each pathway are in blue. The boxes show in which tissue the enzymes have been
  found, with green representing detection in leaf, red representing detection in
  root, and yellow representing detection in seed.
