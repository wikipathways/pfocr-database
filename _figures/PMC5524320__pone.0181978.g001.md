caption: Methionine synthase contains a redox-active methylcobalamin cofactor. Under
  oxidative stress, this cofactor becomes oxidized, limiting methionine synthase activity
  and can affect the levels of global DNA Methylation Under these conditions, homocysteine
  can be condensed with serine to form cystathionine and then with cysteine to support
  GSH synthesis. Another source of the cysteine is through the Excitatory Amino Acid
  Transport (EAAT3), which is the major source of cysteine especially in the neuronal
  cells. Cellular redox state is indicated by the GSH/GSSG ratio.
