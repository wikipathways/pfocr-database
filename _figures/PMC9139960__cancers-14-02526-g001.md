caption: 'Different outputs of IRE1α activation depending on ER stress duration and
  type of affected cell: In non-cancerous cells, mild ER stress induces cytoprotective
  response via splicing of XBP1 mRNA, whilst chronic ER stress switches IRE1α activity
  rather toward induction of TRAF2/ASK1/JNK pro-apoptotic pathway. Cancer cells which
  exhibit chronic ER stress conditions due to their specific microenvironment are
  able to omit UPR-induced cell death. The intensity of IRE1α-dependent XBP1 splicing
  in these cells is significantly increased.'
