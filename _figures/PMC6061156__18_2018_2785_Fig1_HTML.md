caption: Ag processing and presentation pathways followed by CPP-Ag in dendritic cells.
  CPP-Ag mainly enters into the cells via endocytosis, although minor direct penetration
  across the plasma membrane cannot be ruled out. In the latter situation, antigenic
  cargo follows the MHC-I direct presentation pathway. Cytosolic antigenic cargo is
  processed by the proteasome into small antigenic peptides. The transporter associated
  with antigen processing (TAP) transfers these peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) where they are loaded onto MHC-I molecules. These complexes are transported
  to the plasma membrane and deliver the first signal for CD8 T-cell activation through
  their highly specific interaction with the T-cell receptor (TCR) of cognate CD8
  T cells. Endocytosed CPP-Ag can be directed to different pathways. The MHC-I cross
  presentation pathway is reached by the antigenic cargo after its escape from the
  endosome due to the intrinsic properties of CPPs. Alternatively, the antigenic cargo
  can be degraded into small antigenic peptides in the endosome. As MHC-I molecules
  can be expressed in late endosomes (see Ref. []), some of these antigenic peptides
  can be loaded on these molecules, through the MHC-I cross presentation vacuolar
  pathway. Antigenic peptides also reach the MIIC compartment where they are loaded
  on MHC-II molecules that are then transported to the plasma membrane. These complexes
  deliver the first signal for CD4 T-cell activation through their highly specific
  interaction with the TCR of cognate CD4 T cells. The role of adjuvant is also depicted.
  It triggers pattern recognition receptors (PRR), leading to the activation and maturation
  of dendritic cells. In particular, adjuvant increases the MHC-I cross presentation
  activity of dendritic cells and also induce the expression of costimulatory molecules
  that are essential for T-cell activation through the delivery of costimulatory signals.
