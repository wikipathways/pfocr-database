caption: Analysis of the region between styR and styA. (A) Schematic representation
  of the region as it is present in pSTFull, which contains the complete 163 bp between
  the SacI site and the ATG codon of styA, including the vector-derived lacZp. Vector-
  and insert-derived sequences are indicated. Sequence length numbers refer to the
  two segments for which mRNA secondary structures were predicted. A putative LacZα
  fusion peptide is terminated by an insert-derived in-frame stop codon. Known (+1,
  for lacZa-mRNA) or assumed (lightly shaded arrow, for styA-mRNA) mRNA synthesis
  starts are indicated. The inverted repeats of the tod box are indicated by repetitive
  carets, while the larger repeats present in the sty system are indicated by open
  arrows. (B) Predicted mRNA secondary structures when either the region between the
  SacI site upstream of the 163-bp sequence and the HincII site downstream of the
  ATG of styA or the region between the NcoI and the HincII site is transcribed. Free
  energies for the entire structures are given. Relevant sequences are boxed. The
  tod box sequence is printed in boldface type, and the AUG codon of styA mRNA is,
  additionally, italicized. (C) Amino acid sequence comparison of the putative protein
  regions involved directly in DNA binding for StyR and TodT, with a postulated consensus
  sequence for the equivalent region of class 3 response regulators derived from the
  alignment of 19 proteins (see text). Boxed letters indicate identical residues between
  StyR and TodT; italicized letters indicate identical residues in all three sequences.
