caption: Molecular pathways contributing to the phenotype of microsatellite stable
  (MSS) CRC. MMR protein expression results in enhanced RAS signaling through ERK
  pathway (increased proliferation) and down-regulation of PI3P phosphatase, caspase
  9 (apoptosis blockade), as well as TNF (decreased inflammation).
