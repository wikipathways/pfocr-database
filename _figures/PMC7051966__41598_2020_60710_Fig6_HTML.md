caption: Molecular mechanism of action of GMFBI.1 compound mediated suppression of
  proinflammatory response by down regulating GMF-β mediated signalling pathway and
  cytokine production. Over expression of GMF-β results in up regulation of GMF-β
  phosphorylation by PKA leading to increased p38MAPK phosphorylation and activation
  of NFκB expression. This results in increased GM-CSF production by astrocytes resulting
  in microglial activation and secretion of different proinflammatory cytokines. Similarly
  in mast cells, the up regulation of GMF-β results in immune activation. The increased
  proinflammatory response both at the peripheral and CNS level could induce oligodendrocyte
  and neuronal damage. The lead compound GMFBI.1, prevents the overt phosphorylation
  on Ser83 residues of GMF-β resulting in down regulation of proinflammatory response.
