caption: (a) Angiogenic signalling pathways and (b) proposed mechanism for high-frequency
  EF regulation of angiogenic response. Our results demonstrate that high-frequency
  EF enhances capillary morphogenesis and VEGF release via the MEK–cRaf step in the
  ERK pathway, with a possible involvement of Ca2+—and, to a lesser extent, eNOS-mediated
  MEK activation. The observed pro-angiogenic effects of EF are frequency-sensitive
  and are independent of VEGF binding to VEGFR2 receptor and PI3K signalling. A potential
  mechanism for these effects is that high-frequency EF may directly regulate the
  interaction of MEK protein with its binding partner cRaf (b), consistent with the
  possibility of gigahertz EF penetrating the cell membrane and affecting intracellular
  signalling. Thus, 7.5 GHz EF may enhance interaction between MEK and its binding
  partner (c-Raf or U0126), resulting in an increased complex formation, increased
  phosphorylation of MEK protein and activation of downstream MAPK/ERK pathway, ultimately
  leading to stimulation of angiogenic responses in the absence of U0126, or inhibition
  of angiogenic responses when U0126 is present.
