caption: Carbohydrate metabolic pathway annotation for quantified proteins. Glycolysis,
  the citric acid cycle, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway
  are represented with purple, blue, yellow, and brown lines, respectively. All quantified
  proteins are marked in black [no significant change (0.67<FC<1.50)], red [up-regulated
  (FC ≥ 1.50)], or green [down-regulated (FC ≤ 0.67)] according to the fold change
  between high- and low-yield A. flavus strains.
