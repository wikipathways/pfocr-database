caption: Overview of lipid metabolism. Dietary carbohydrates and lipids are major
  contributors of fatty acids. Carbohydrates may be converted into triglycerides via
  the G3P pathway or fatty acids via DNL through the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid
  cycle. The latter is regulated by both the ChREBP and SREBP1c signalling pathways.
  Fatty acids can be stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets until required or be oxidised
  for removal. β-oxidation of lipids can occur in the mitochondria or peroxisomes
  and is mainly regulated by the PPARα signalling pathway. This figure was created
  with BioRender.com.
