caption: Proteins and metabolites in JK1 that change by >2-fold relative to wild-type
  E. coli. Transketolase and transaldolase reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway
  are indicated by purple and blue arrows, respectively. Particularly important changes
  discussed in the text are highlighted in red. TktB (the minor transketolase) and
  TalA levels are decreased by 19- and 4-fold, respectively, in JK1, but levels of
  TktA, the major transketolase, and TalB are unchanged. Thus, adequate transaldolase
  and transketolase activities should be available to support the pentose phosphate
  pathway reactions.
