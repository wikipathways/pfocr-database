caption: A schematic mechanism of how butyrate suppresses the proliferation of colon
  cancer cells via targeting pyruvate kinase M2 and metabolic reprogramming. PKM2
  exists dominantly in its inactive dimeric form in normal HCT116 cells. It thus favors
  aerobic glycolysis, characterized by pronounced accumulation of lactate but a repressed
  TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation to support rapid cell growth. In contrast,
  the butyrate treatment dephosphorylates PKM2 while promoting the formation of tetrameric
  PKM2, enhancing the kinase activity of PKM2. Accordingly, we found that HCT116 cells
  significantly decrease the level of lactate while pronouncedly increasing the abundance
  of pyruvate. Concomitantly, metabolic profiles that represent a metabolic shift
  from anabolic processes (such as building block preparation and glycolysis, which
  are essential for tumor cell proliferation) to oxidative phosphorylation and energy
  production are observed, which explains the hampered nucleotide synthesis pathway
  and consequently inhibited proliferation induced by butyrate treatment.
