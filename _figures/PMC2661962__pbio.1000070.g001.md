caption: NKT and MAIT cells both arise in the thymus from uncommitted DN precursors.
  The cells progress to the DP CD4+ CD8+ stage, where they presumably randomly rearrange
  the TCR. Thymocytes that express a TCR that interacts with CD1d bound to self-glycolipid,
  expressed by other DP thymocytes, enter the i NKT lineage. Homotypic interactions
  between SLAM and Ly108 molecules, also expressed at the surface of DP thymocytes,
  are required for progression into the i NKT cell lineage. Thymocytes that express
  a TCR that interacts with MR1 expressed at the surface of an undefined myeloid cell
  type are positively selected into the MAIT cell lineage. Such lineage commitment
  does not require SLAM/SAP signaling. Whether other specific signaling pathways are
  required for the generation of MAIT cells remains to be determined. After selection,
  iNKT cell precursors undergo a series of differentiation steps characterized by
  the sequential expression of several cell surface markers (HSA [heat-stable antigen],
  CD44, and NK1.1), as depicted. How MAIT cells mature to their characteristic phenotype
  is currently unknown. The earliest iNKT cell precursor found in the thymus expresses
  the highest level of the transcription factor Zbtb16. Zbtb16 expression level then
  decreases as the cell progresses further in the differentiation pathway. At least
  four distinct immature i NKT cell populations have been identified in the thymus.
  Most iNKT cells that emigrate from the thymus do so in an immature form (CD44high,
  NK1.1−) and can continue their final maturation in the periphery (spleen/liver).
  Some mature iNKT cells also migrate to the periphery, but many remain as long-term
  residents of the thymus. MAIT cells leave the thymus with a naïve phenotype and
  expand in peripheral organs such as the lymph nodes and the mucosa epithelia (such
  as the lamina propria), where they expand upon interactions with B cells. This cell
  expansion is associated with the expression of Zbtb16 and the acquisition of a “memory”
  phenotype.
