caption: For this part of the pathway, holo-Tf conjugated with DT enters the cell
  through TfR, then internalized as a holo-Tf/TfR complex. DT can then be cleaved,
  and DTA is released into the cytosol. After iron from Tf is released, the apo-Tf/TfR
  complex is either degraded or recycled. For the recycled apo-Tf/TfR complex, the
  apo-Tf is released when it returns to the cell surface.
