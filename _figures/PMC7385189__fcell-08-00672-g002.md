caption: Mechanisms of primary resistance. (a) Tumors with high mutation burden are
  more likely to respond to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy because there is a greater possibility
  of generating immunogenic neoantigens which activate CD8+ T cells and induce tumor
  rejection reactivity. (b) Tumor cells with primary B2M mutation fail to present
  tumor antigens and elicit antitumor immunity which is required for tumor cell killing.
  (c) Tumor cells resistant to IFN-γ signaling because of primary JAK1/2 mutation
  can not induce PDL1 upregulation but inhibit T cell reactivity in PD1/PDL1 independent
  pathway. The inactivation of IFN-γ signaling also downregulates CXCL9 and CXCL10
  expressions which are necessary for T cell trafficking. (d) Alternative immune checkpoints
  are upregulated in tumor infiltrating T cells, and thus only blocking PD1/PDL1 axis
  is not enough to rescue the severely exhausted T cells. Upregulation of VEGFR signaling
  and TOX expression aggravates the activation of inhibitory signaling. (e) TME contains
  diverse immunosuppressive cells that influence anti-PD1/PDL1 efficacy through inhibiting
  T cell reactivity. Cytokines derived from tumors recruit more immunosuppressive
  cells to TME and promote polarization toward pro-tumor phenotype. (f) Oncogene mutation
  and abnormal activation contribute to inhibition of antitumor immunity, resulting
  in primary resistance to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy.
