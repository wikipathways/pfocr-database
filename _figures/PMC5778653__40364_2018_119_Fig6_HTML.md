caption: 'A model of the relationship of Alzheimer’s disease-specific metabolites
  indicated in this study. Serine, glycerate, Neu5Ac, and 2-HB are depicted with the
  AD-related metabolites, phenomenon, structures and metabolic pathways. Metabolites
  detected in this study are indicated in green oval with bold letters. Other related
  metabolites are indicated in light green oval. Enzymes are indicated in light blue
  oval. The phenomena, structure and pathways known to participate with AD pathogenesis
  are indicated in square. Valid allows indicate the interactions previously reported.
  Dotted allows indicate predicted interactions. Red bold line indicates the brain
  and CSF boundary. 2-KB: 2-ketobutyrate; 2-HB: 2-hydroxybutyrate; AD: Alzheimer’s
  disease; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; NADPH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate;
  Neu5Ac: N-acetylneuraminate; PC: phosphatidylcholine; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine;
  PPP: pentose phosphate pathway; PSS: phosphatidylserine synthase'
