caption: 'A brief graphic summary of the mechanistic impacts of environmental exposure
  through oxidative stress alterations in the human placenta, as detailed in the text
  of this review. At the center of this graph is the mitochondria which is the major
  producer of oxidative stress (ROS = Reactive Oxygen Species, and RNS = Reactive
  Nitrogen Species). The red dashed arrows relate to the generation of oxidative stress;
  the box on the upper left summarizes the antioxidant mechanisms that will fight
  against oxidative stress (the balance GSH/GSSG, the Superoxide Dismutases, the Glutathione
  peroxidases, the Catalase). The effect of OS on biomolecules appears on proteins,
  DNA and lipids as shown in the hexagon in the middle of the figure, with specific
  chemical modifications. Below, the placenta on which this review is focused is presented,
  part of the oxidative stress response being triggered in this organ by the activation
  of the P38/MAPK pathway. In black are the sources of oxidative stress in the human
  placenta that are described in this paper (Metalloids and Metals, Tobacco smoke
  and Atmospheric particulate matter). In Blue boxes at the right part of the figure
  are presented specific chemicals that are part of the placental regulation of oxidative
  stress, acting either on ROS production or modulation of ROS detoxification that
  is further detailed in the text. Other abbreviations: ETC = Electron Transport Chain,
  NOX = Nitric Oxidases, sFLT1 = Soluble FMS-Like Tyrosine kinase 1, sENG = soluble
  Endoglin, CO = Carbon Monoxide, TOCP = Tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate.'
