caption: Two models for the formation of the new compartment in class E vps mutants.
  (A) Proteins bound for the vacuole in wild-type cells are normally packaged into
  at least two separate classes of transport vesicles that subsequently fuse with
  the vacuole. In class E vps mutants, these pathways fail to merge. In addition,
  late-Golgi proteins such as A-ALP enter the pathway defined by CPY as a consequence
  of the class E vps mutation. (B) Proteins bound for the vacuole in wild-type cells
  normally pass through a prevacuolar endosome-like compartment. Late-Golgi proteins
  are hypothesized to cycle between the late-Golgi compartment and the prevacuole.
  In class E vps mutants, most protein traffic (an exception being ALP) from the putative
  endosome-like organelle either to the vacuole or back to the late Golgi is restricted,
  leading to morphological exaggeration of the organelle. The steady-state resident
  proteins for each compartment are shown in parentheses.
