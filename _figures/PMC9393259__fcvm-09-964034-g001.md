caption: The anti-oxidative system inhibits ferroptosis to protect against cardiovascular
  disease by eliminating oxidative stress. The figure shows the protective effects
  of the SOD family, catalase, Trx recycles, system Xc–-GSH-GPX4 pathway, FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H
  pathway, and tocopherol on the elimination of ROS and reducing the conversion to
  lipid peroxide, such as toxic MDA and 4-HNE. ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD,
  superoxide dismutase; FSP, ferroptosis suppressor protein; CoQ, coenzyme Q; GSH,
  glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; GSR, glutathione reductase; GPX, glutathione
  peroxidase; 4-HNE, 4-hydroxynonenal; MDA, malondialdehyde; TPX, thioredoxin peroxidase;
  Trx red, reduced thioredoxin; Trx ox, oxidized thioredoxin; PUFA, polyunsaturated
  fatty acid.
