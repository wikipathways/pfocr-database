caption: Pharmacological modulation of NCC function in the DCT. Inhibitors are shown
  in red, while enhancers are shown in light blue. Thiazide diuretics directly inhibit
  NCC blocking ion translocation, while mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA)
  act indirectly, blocking the MR-mediated effect of aldosterone. Loop diuretics (LD)
  activate the NCC, increasing the amount of sodium delivered to the DCT and the secretion
  of aldosterone, which increases NCC activity in both an MR-dependent and an MR-independent
  manner. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) decrease PP3-mediated dephosphorylation of
  NCC, basolateral K+ channel, and KLHL3, thus stimulating NCC activity at various
  levels. Salbutamol (SALB) could activate basolateral K+ channel through a signaling
  pathway likely mediated by β2-adrenergic receptor. A drop in K+ intracellular concentration
  eventually triggers WNK-SPAK/OSR1-NCC cascade. SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i, shown in
  purple) may influence NCC activity, increasing the delivery of glucose and fructose
  to the DCT and possibly stimulating a signaling pathway involving the calcium-sensing
  receptor (CaSR) and protein kinase C (PKC). Figure created in BioRender.com [6]
