caption: A change in plasma glucose concentration from 2.8 mM to 16.8 mM was applied
  as an input to the model. Net GLUT1-dependent glucose uptake was calculated as the
  difference between inwards and outwards rates,  and . Net GLUT2-dependent uptake
  was calculated analogously. Phosphorylated glucose concentration includes also the
  concentration of its derivates in the pathway that are not explicitly modeled. Black
  lines refer to the behavior of healthy β-cells, gray lines represent behavior of
  β-cells from T2D donors.
