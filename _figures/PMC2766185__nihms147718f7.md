caption: '(A) 22G-RNA synthesis: In the germline, DRH-3, EGO-1 and CSR-1 localize
  to perinuclear P Granules, where DRH-3 and EGO-1 initiate the synthesis of 22G-RNAs
  from transcripts that are important for germline development and early embryogenesis.
  These 22G-RNAs are loaded onto CSR-1 and can guide the complex to its targets.(B)
  Initial targeting of genomic loci: In oocytes, CSR-1 22G-RNA complexes move into
  the nucleus where they target nascent transcripts, possibly by cleaving them. Chromatin
  modifying factors may associate with CSR-1 complexes to promote local modification
  of histones at and near CSR-1 target loci, establishing pericentromeric chromatin
  domains (green nucleosomes). A complex containing EGO-1, DRH-3, and possibly EKL-1
  is proposed to amplify the signal in a positive feedback loop, by generating more
  22G-RNAs in the nucleus with the CSR-1 22G-RNA-targeted nascent transcripts as the
  template.(C) Establishment and maintenance of chromatin domains: The CSR-1 22G-RNA
  dependent chromatin domains containing modified histones (green nucleosomes) may
  promote the proper binding and organization of other components such as condensins
  and cohesins in embryo mitotic divisions. Furthermore, these chromatin domains could
  both help to recruit and restrict the incorporation of the centromeric Histone H3
  variant, HPC-3/CENP-A (red nucleosomes) in chromatin domains adjacent to those targeted
  by CSR-1 22G-RNA complexes. Regions of the chromatin loop out and self-associate,
  permitting the assembly of a proper planar, rigid kinetochore on the poleward faces
  of condensed chromosomes. As cell divisions continue, chromatin domains could be
  maintained epigenetically, possibly even by EKL-1, thus becoming less reliant on
  CSR-1 22G-RNA activity throughout development.'
