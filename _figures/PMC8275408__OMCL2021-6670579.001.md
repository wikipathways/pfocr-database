caption: The arrows refer to the role of promotion, and the symbol of “┴” refers to
  the role of inhibition. Under the action of NADPH, O2 can produce O2•−, which is
  considered to be one of the most important ROS. On the one hand, O2•− can react
  with super NO to produce ONOO−. On the other hand, two molecules of O2•− can generate
  H2O2 and one molecule of water under the action of SOD. The H2O2 obtains electrons
  from ferrous ions to generate HO. In addition, hypoxia leads to the accumulation
  of succinate and its metabolites. A large amount of accumulated succinate is oxidized
  by complex II and further transmits electrons to complex I and generates a large
  amount of ROS. Further, ROS passes through HMGB1-TLR1-MyD88-NF-κB signaling pathway
  stimulates the release of inflammatory factors and induces cell apoptosis.
