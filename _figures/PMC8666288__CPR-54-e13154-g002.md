caption: 'ROS‐mediated cellular stress response: (1) mild accumulation of ROS inhibits
  NADPH oxidase activity. (2) Mild accumulation of ROS activates antioxidant defence
  system which involves activation of transcription factors including NF‐kB, Nrf‐1
  and AP‐1 which in turn upregulates expression of thioredoxin reductase, glutathione
  peroxidase, SOD, etc., which can suppress further accumulation of ROS. (3) Mild
  accumulation of ROS activates ER stress through affecting IRE6, ATF6 and PERK. PERK
  in turn inhibits general protein synthesis and ATF4 and functional XBP‐1 promote
  chaperon transcription, UPR genes and ERAD genes which can protect cells against
  accumulated ROS. (4) Mild accumulation of ROS can directly induce autophagy through
  inhibition of mTORC. (5) Mild accumulation of ROS can upregulate expression of HSP70
  which can affect protein folding, proteasome activation and induction of autophagy.
  (6) Mild accumulation of ROS can also activate JNK and after that c‐JUN which can
  in turn activate BECN1, Atg4 and MAP1LC3B genes expressions, most important proteins
  involved in autophagy. ROS can also inhibit PI3K pathway and modulate autophagy.
  Finally, mild accumulation of ROS can induce specific decrease in RNA stability
  and result in mitochondrial activity shut down'
