caption: Phosphorylated AMPK increases eNOS-mediated NO availability, that accounts
  for the majority of AD cardioprotective effects. By responding to changes in ATP
  generation/consumption, AMPK plays a key role in modulating energy-consuming anabolic
  pathways and indirectly participates to SIRT-1 activation through increased NAD+
  levels and NAD/NADH ratio. In turn, by promoting lysine deacetylation of LKB1 and
  subsequent translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm, SIRT-1 may sustain the LKB1-mediated
  activation of AMPK. Combined treatment of AD plus CC (inhibitor of AMPK) or STN
  (inhibitor of SIRT-1) impair the protective effects of AD preconditioning, suggesting
  that both AMPK and SIRT-1 are required for AD-mediated cardiovascular protection,
  and regulate each other activities.
