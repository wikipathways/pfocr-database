caption: Overview of the Wnt-Fz signaling cascades. (A) In the canonical pathway,
  the protein degradation complex consisting of Axin, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3),
  and Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) is active when Wnt is absent. GSK-3 phosphorylates
  β-catenin, resulting in its degradation. Wnt target genes are not transcribed since
  the DNA transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) is
  bound to corepressor protein Groucho/transducing-like enhancer of split (TLE). In
  contrast to when Wnt is present, Wnt signals through the Frizzled (Fz) receptor
  and its co-receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/6 to
  activate the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled (Dvl), which functions as a scaffold
  to regulate local Wnt signaling. Activation of the pathway disrupts the protein
  degradation complex. β-catenin subsequently translocates into the nucleus and binds
  to TCF/LEF, increasing the transcription of Wnt target genes. (B) In the planar
  cell polarity (PCP) pathway, Wnt-Fz signaling through Dvl leads to the activation
  of RhoA and Rac. The subsequent activation of ROCK and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
  promotes changes in the cytoskeleton. (C) In the calcium pathway, Wnt-Fz signaling
  through Dvl activates phospholipase C (PLC), increasing the levels of inositol triphosphate
  (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). This results in an increase in intracellular calcium
  concentration and activation of the calcium-sensitive effectors protein kinase C
  (PKC) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), triggering changes
  in gene transcription, cell movement, and actin polymerization.
