caption: The metabolic pathways associated with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD) are illustrated in an erythrocyte (red) and a nucleated cell in tissue. The
  NADPH provides high energy electrons for antioxidant defense (in erythrocytes and
  other cells), reductive biosynthesis (in most nucleated cells), Cytochrome P450
  mediated metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics (predominantly in hepatocytes), and
  NADPH oxidase function for generation of superoxides (phagocytic cells). In erythrocytes,
  the G6PD mediated oxidative Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is the sole source of
  NADPH. In other cells, cytosolic NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase and isocitrate
  dehydrogenase can also recycle NADP to NADPH and may partly compensate G6PD function.
  However, the PPP is uniquely required in these cells to maintain a normal NADPH/NADP
  ratio so G6PD deficiency may have broad pathophysiological consequences ().
