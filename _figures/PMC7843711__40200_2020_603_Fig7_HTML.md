caption: 'Summary of PA and CSE action on insulin signal transduction pathway and
  endothelial dysfunction. The insulin signaling cascade is comprised of the PI3K-Akt
  pathway (metabolic arm) and the Sch-MAPK pathway (mitogenic arm). When insulin binds
  to INSR, a conformational change and autophosphorylation of the receptor lead to
  the recruitment and phosphorylation of receptor substrates such as IRS and Shc proteins.
  Shc activates the MAPK/ERK/ET-1 pathway, which leads to the secretion of ET-1 and
  adhesion molecule expression in vascular endothelium, promotion of growth and differentiation,
  and hormone production leading to the promotion of inflammation and atherogenesis
  (these are collectively known as the mitogenic, pro-inflammatory effects). In the
  PI3-kinase arm, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins, allows them to bind to
  PI3K. PI3K activates phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK) which promotes the
  phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt) at Thr308 and Ser473. Activated Akt phosphorylates
  eNOS which regulates NO production and vasodilatation in vascular endothelium. Akt
  also plays a role in the control of glucose transport, lipid synthesis, gluconeogenesis,
  glycogen synthesis, cell cycle, and survival (these effects are broadly described
  as “anti-inflammatory effects”). In the PA-treated cells, the pro-inflammatory effects
  overtake the anti-inflammatory pathway whereas in the presence of CSE this imbalance
  is prevented. When CSE is added to the culture medium, its components dissolve and
  segregate. A portion of phytochemicals may enter the cell cytoplasm. Inside or out,
  CSE components neutralize ROS as much as possible. The preferential increase in
  NO production occurs via augmentation of the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS proteins
  due to activation of PI3K/NO pathway, and attenuated production of ET-1 is achieved
  via the prevention of MAPK/ET-1 pathway. Akt (Protein kinase B); AMPK: 5′ Adenosine
