caption: DDR components regulate IFNs signaling pathways. The cellular innate immune
  response frequently intimately communicates with DDR components via DNA sensors-dependent
  IFNs signaling pathways. In the IFNs pathways, many DDR components regulate the
  initial sensing process by interacting with cGAS. cGAS is the universal dsDNA sensor
  that catalyzes the formation of cGAMP and comprises a heterocomplex with cGAMP to
  signal the cytosolic adaptor STING activation, which subsequently initiates IFN-1
  production, inflammation response, or programmed cell death pathways. Several DDR
  components also participate in the STING and its downstream signaling pathways.
  Except for cGAS, other cytosolic DNA sensors like the DDX family, DAI, or IFI16
  have also been found to associate with DDR components. Moreover, considering the
  nuclear location of cGAS, certain DDR components may interact with cGAS inside the
  cell nucleus, which indicates a potential role of cGAS in regulating the DNA-damage
  repairing process
