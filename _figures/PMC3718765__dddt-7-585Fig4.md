  (A) Mitochondrial affinity bearing DQAsomes formed by single chain bolaamphiphiles.
  Right side shows DQAsomes and DNA forming complexes, DQAplexes, that transport DNA
  specifically to mitochondria. (B) TPP-mediated delivery of cargo is based on membrane
  potential created by high negative potential of the mitochondrial inner membrane,
  thus attachment of TPP to small molecules delivers them initially to the cytoplasm
  and subsequently to mitochondria. (C) Mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS) when
  covalently cross-linked to large molecules like peptide nucleic acids (PNA) or oligodeoxynucleotides
  (ODN) can be delivered to mitochondria. When the MTS gene is fused with a gene of
  interest, MTS-fused protein is expressed in the cytosol and delivers the protein
  to mitochondria. (D) Macromolecules conjugated to the protein transduction domain
  (PTD) have been found to accumulate in mitochondria due to an unknown mechanism.
  PTD is known to bypass the classical protein import pathway and accumulate in cytosol.Abbreviations:
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; TOM/TIM, translocse of the outermembrane/translocase
  of the innermembrane; DQA, dequalinium; DQAsomes, dequalinium based liposome-like
  vesicles.'
