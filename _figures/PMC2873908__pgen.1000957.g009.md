caption: (A) In WT cells, the transcription of the main cell cycle regulators is under
  circadian control. Commitment to S phase depends on both the light intensity and
  duration from dawn (light represented by yellow square). Therefore the precommitment
  period varies in length (dashed square). In contrast, S phase is gated by a timer
  and is not detected before 6 hours after dawn. During precommitment CyclinA is synthesized
  under control of a cAMP dependent pathway. The cyclinA/CDKA complex promotes entry
  into S phase in committed cells. (B) Rb-knockdown cells are able to enter S phase
  in limiting conditions or when cAMP synthesis is inhibited. In these lines, CyclinA
  is not detected under limiting light conditions suggesting that CyclinA may be required
  to overcome the inhibitory effect of Rb in WT cells. However, the gating of S phase
  by a timer still operates in Rb-kd cells. (C) Under limiting conditions CyclinA-ox
  cells commit to S phase even when cAMP synthesis is inhibited. CyclinA-ox cells
  enter into S phase earlier than WT or Rb kd cells. Overexpression of CyclinA may
  non-specifically induce cell cycle progression by functionally replacing another
  cyclin (CyclinX) (1) and/or titer an inhibitor such as CDK Inhibitor (CKI) which
  would gate S phase in WT cells (2).
