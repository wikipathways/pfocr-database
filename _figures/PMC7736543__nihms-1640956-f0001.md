caption: The outer mesenchymal capsule contains distinct populations of multipotent
  stem cells, including GLI+ and WT1+ cells, which are capable of giving rise to steroidogenic
  cells. These populations contribute at relatively low rates to homeostatic adrenocortical
  renewal, but can be acutely activated in response to severe stress. The main driver
  of homeostatic centripetal renewal is the zona glomerulosa (zG), which is characterized
  by high Wnt pathway activation and the production of SHH ligands. The zG contains
  CYP11B2− cells as well as more differentiated CYP11B2+ cells, which can repopulate
  the inner cortex through transdifferentiation. The ability of the adrenal cortex
  to maintain cellular renewal through a diverse set of mechanisms enables the tissue
  to adapt to a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions.
