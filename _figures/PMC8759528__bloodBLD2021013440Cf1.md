caption: Mitochondria play important role in modulating metabolic responses of neutrophils
  during hypoxia. During hypoxic conditions, neutrophils synthesize enhanced mROS
  formation, which stabilizes HIF-1α, a transcriptional regulator that promotes oxygen
  delivery to hypoxic regions. This process relies on the G-3-P shuttle pathway. Modulation
  of glycolysis leading to increased flux through the G-3-P shuttle promotes enhanced
  mitochondrial membrane potential and mROS release during hypoxia. GPD2, the mitochondrial
  component of the G-3-P shuttle, is involved in promoting mROS synthesis, HIF-1α
  stabilization, and neutrophil survival during hypoxia. Professional illustration
