caption: 'Inhibition of FD proteolytic activity by danicopan. FD participates in C3
  convertase generation by cleavage of factor B at 2 steps in the AP cascade: generation
  of the initial C3 convertase [C3(H2O)Bb] following spontaneous AP activation (tick-over)
  in the fluid phase and the production of surface-bound C3 convertase (C3bBb), which
  mediates dramatic amplification of the initial activation (amplification loop) and
  activation of the terminal pathway (cleavage of C5 into C5a and C5b by C5 convertase
  [ie, C3bBb3b]), leading to opsonization of target surfaces by C3b, release of the
  anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and formation of MAC. An erythrocyte is shown to depict
  the membrane-bound events. Regulatory proteins not shown here can promote (properdin
  and FH-related proteins) or attenuate (factor H, factor I, multiple membrane-bound
  proteins, including CD55 and CD59) AP activity. Eculizumab acts directly at the
  terminal pathway by preventing its activation via binding to C5; danicopan acts
  upstream by preventing AP activation via inhibition of proteolytic activity of FD.
  Although the C5 inhibitor is able to block MAC formation regardless of the initiation
  pathway of complement activation, it has no effect on C3 fragment deposition. FD
  inhibitor is able to block C3 fragment deposition and MAC formation when the complement
  activation is initiated via AP, such as in the case of PNH; it should be able to
  exert the same, although not complete, inhibitory effect when complement activation
  is initiated via CP or LP through blocking the amplification loop.'
