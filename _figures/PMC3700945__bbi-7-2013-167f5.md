caption: 'Pathway detail for the IPN: Mucus Hypersecretion model.Notes: The Mucus
  Hypersecretion model contains signaling detail from four main pathways known to
  induce airway MUC5AC production. The TNF pathway (purple) includes the TNFR ligands
  TNF and TNFRSF1A and culminates in the transcriptional activation of NFkB. The IL13
  pathway (red), describes the molecular events leading to epithelial cell differentiation
  into mucin-producing goblet cells through the cytokine IL13 and the transcription
  factor, SPDEF. The SP-1 pathway (green) describes the routes leading to transcriptional
  activation of MUC5AC by the transcription factor SP-1, and includes the upstream
  signaling kinases, PKA, PKC and MAPK14. The AP-1 pathway (blue) includes the primary
  pathways that activate MUC5AC expression via EGFR activation and the signaling intermediate,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS).'
