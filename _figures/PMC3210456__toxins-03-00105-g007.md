caption: Model of Cyclin D1 action and degradation. Cyclin D1 is a subunit that binds
  and activates cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4/6 to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma
  protein Rb, to release the transcription factor E2F that is needed for cells to
  progress from G1 into S phase. Mitogens induce the accumulation of cyclin D1 via
  transcription in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The pool of cellular cyclinD1 is
  controlled by a phosphorylation-dependent pathway, involving the protein Ser/Thr
  kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and ubiquitination by the E3 ligase SCF.
  This reaction is reversible, and cyclin D1 can be deubiquitinated by USP2. Polyubiquitinated
  cyclin D1 is targeted for degradation by the proteosome. Cyclin D1 protein levels
  may also be regulated by an uncharacterized Thr286 phosphorylation-independent mechanism.
  Arrows are weighted to indicate rapid degradation of cyclin D1 through the phosphorylation
  and ubiqiutination-dependent proteosome degradation.
