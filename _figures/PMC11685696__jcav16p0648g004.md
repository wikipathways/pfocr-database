caption: Intestinal microbiota mediate CID through the TLR receptor and cGAS-STING
  pathway. The TLR4 is located on the cell surface. TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9 are present
  in a multiprotein signaling complex called the "endosome." Except for TLR3, all
  other TLRs recruit Myeloid Differentiation Primary Response 88 (MyD88) as an adaptor
  protein. MyD88 attracts IL-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase 4 (IRAK-4) to the TLRs,
  which then undergo phosphorylation and activate IRAK-1. After interacting with TRAF6,
  IRAK-1 activates the IKK complex and leads to NF-kB activation. Both TLR3 and TLR4
  recruit Toll/IL-1 Receptor Domain Inducing IFN-beta (TRIF) protein. The signaling
  pathway of both TLRs results in NF-kB activation and/or expression of type I interferons
  (IFNs)
