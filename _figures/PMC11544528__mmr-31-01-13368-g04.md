caption: Mechanisms by which NR4A1 regulates osteoporosis and adipogenesis via the
  Notch signaling pathway. The reduction in NR4A1 expression led to a decrease in
  CSL-MAML-dependent Notch1 signaling, consequently triggering the upregulation of
  the RUNX2 gene, either via direct or indirect pathways involving HES1. This cascade
  promotes osteoblastogenesis. Moreover, the reduction of HES1 may further inhibit
  adipogenesis. NR4A1, nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1; RUNX2, Runt-related
  transcription factor 2; HES1, Hes family bHLH transcription factor 1
