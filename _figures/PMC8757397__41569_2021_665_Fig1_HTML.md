caption: Following entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
  into the host endothelial cell by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
  (ACE2) receptor, the expression and enzymatic activity of ACE2 are reduced, resulting
  in increased vascular permeability and tissue factor (TF) expression in subendothelial
  cells, as well as in leukocytes and platelets, which triggers coagulation. ACE2
  can exert antithrombotic effects through various mechanisms, including the renin–angiotensin
  pathway, in which angiotensin I is converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme to
  angiotensin II (Ang II), which is then broken down by ACE2 to angiotensin 1–7 (Ang
  1–7). Reduction in the expression of ACE2 leads to an increase in the level of Ang
  II, which stimulates the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1)
  in various cells, including smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and adipocytes.
  The increase in PAI-1 levels results in hypofibrinolysis. Endothelial cell activation
  or dysfunction results in a generalized inflammatory state, characterized by high
  levels of inflammatory cytokines, release of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and increased
  endothelial cell-surface expression of adhesion molecules such as P-selectin, promoting
  thrombus formation and leukocyte recruitment. Inflammation is an important driver
  of thrombosis, through several mechanisms. Inflammatory cytokines and viral-specific
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induce TF expression in monocytes, resulting in activation
  of the coagulation cascade. Platelet activation by TLR signalling results in increased
  platelet reactivity and platelet aggregation. Activation of neutrophils results
  in the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis), leading to activation
  of coagulation and providing a scaffold for the adhesion of platelets, red blood
  cells and platelet-adhesion molecules. In parallel, activation of coagulation via
  TF also results in thrombin generation and the formation of fibrin, which allows
  crosslinking of platelets and other cellular constituents and results in occlusive
  thrombus formation. CCL2, CC-motif chemokine 2; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019;
