caption: The IFN I response. (1) The IFN I response is triggered by different stimuli
  such as ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA via the toll like receptors, the MAVS and
  the STING pathway. (2) Activation of these pathways induces the nuclear translocation
  of transcription factors such as IRF3, IRF7 and NF-kB that trigger IFN I production
  and expression of some interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). (3) Secreted IFN I trigger
  IFNAR signaling on neighboring cells, notably immune cells. (4) IFN I and other
  soluble factors of the IFN I response activate the immune response. (5) Activation
  of IFNAR signaling by IFN I leads to the formation of the interferon stimulated
  gene factor 3 complex. (6) This complex translocates to the nucleus and activates
  numerous ISGs with antiviral, immunomodulatory and regulatory functions. PRR, pattern
  recognition receptors.
