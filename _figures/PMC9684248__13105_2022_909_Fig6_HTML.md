caption: 'Pyroptosis in ALI and silicosis. Exposure to LPS, which is an important
  component of bacteria, is a common cause of ALI. LPS binds to TLR4 and activates
  the NLRP3 inflammasome. Meanwhile, LPS activates the p38 MAPK pathway via the TLR2/NF-κB
  signaling pathway, which results in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The
  activated NLRP3 inflammasome excites caspase-1, and active caspase-1 sequentially
  cleaves GSDMD. Finally, GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis of AMs occurs, which leads to
  consistent excessive alveolar inflammation and diffuse alveolar edema. Additionally,
  the lethal toxin-activated NLRP1 inflammasome induces pyroptosis of AMs, contributing
  to the development of ALI. Furthermore, pyroptosis of AMs aggravates ALI by releasing
  caspase-1-dependent PyrBDs, which trigger the vascular interstitial edema and neutrophil
  recruitment. In addition, LPS circulating in the blood triggers pyroptosis of pulmonary
  endothelial cells via activating the caspase-4/11/GSDMD pathway. Inhaled silica
  activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is dependent or independent of ROS. Activated
  NLRP3 inflammasome processes caspase-1 which cleaves GSDMD. Additionally, silica
  activates caspase-4/11, which leads to the release of GSDMD-NTD. Consequently, GSDMD-mediated
  pyroptosis occurs in AMs and results in chronic inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis.
  Note: ALI, acute lung injury; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GSDMD, gasdermin D; AMs,
  alveolar macrophages; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor
  kappa-B; PyrBDs, pyroptotic bodies'
