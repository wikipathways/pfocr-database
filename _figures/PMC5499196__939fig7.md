caption: XREP stress pathway components and relationships. (A) Genetic pathway for
  the stress response. The stress response pathway based on the genetic results of
  this study is shown; this pathway is consistent with several previous studies of
  many of the components (, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ). We propose that XREP-4 functions
  as a key sensor or trigger point in the pathway, the levels of which regulate WDR-23
  stability, which in turn regulates SKN-1 transcriptional activity. In nonstress
  conditions, WDR-23 is able to prevent SKN-1 from activating the pathway (; ; ; ).
  In our model, reduction or loss of ALH-6 activity results in the buildup of a toxic
  metabolic intermediate, pyrroline-5-carboxylate, that directly or indirectly upregulates
  XREP-4 levels. XREP-4 functions with SKR-1/2 to reduce WDR-23 activity in a Skp
  I, Cul-1, and F-box protein-type ubiquitin-mediated degradation process, releasing
  SKN-1 that serves as a master transcriptional activator of downstream stress response
  target genes, including gst-4. (B) Activity relationships and roles among stress
  pathway components. The stress pathway factors in this study are listed, their role
  defined, and colored to indicate if their activity promotes suppression (green)
  or activation (red) of the stress response. (C) Summary of some of the stress pathways
  operating through SKN-1. Inputs from several stress pathways converging on SKN-1
  are shown, including xenobiotic/endogenous stress (this study), oxidative stress
  through the p38 MAPK Pathway (), and nutritional stress through the insulin signaling
  pathway [reviewed in ].
