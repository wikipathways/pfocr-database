caption: Schematic depiction of the molecular mechanism for the progression from HPS
  to chronic active disease or T-cell lymphoma in EBV-infected T cells. EBV LMP-1
  up-regulates TNF-α via the TRAFs/NF-κB signals in one way and down-regulates TNFR1
  in the other way to suppress the apoptotic signal pathway, allowing the LMP-1-expressing
  T cells to survive from TNF-α-induced apoptosis, whereas the bystander cells undergo
  apoptosis and lead to systemic cytokine injuries. This model may represent a prototype
  example for the pathogenesis of virus- or inflammation-associated cancer.
