caption: The emerging effect of ferroptosis in malaria immunity. (A) An overview of
  the ferroptosis pathway. On the left side of the figure (white background), morphologically,
  ferroptotic cell death is distinguished by structural changes in mitochondria like
  outer membrane disruption and volume reduction as well as cell rounding followed
  by plasma membrane rupture. On the right, the genetic regulatory routes of ferroptosis.
  (B) The consumption of hemoglobin by Plasmodium releases Fe2+ atoms that may catalyze
  the Fenton reaction, causing iron–lipid peroxidation and hemolysis, this process
  being involved in anemia. (C) Variant S47 of TP53 impair ferroptosis, causing iron
  accumulation in macrophages, which elevates IL-10 levels and provides an anti-inflammatory
  response, limiting the immunopathological damage of malaria. (D) On the other hand,
  the induction of ferroptosis by the pharmacological blocking of SLC7A11 and GPX4
  reduces Plasmodium liver parasitemia.
