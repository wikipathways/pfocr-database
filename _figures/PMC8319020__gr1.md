caption: Structure, biosynthesis, and distribution in humans of O-acetylated sialic
  acids.A, structure of the nine-carbon (C-1 to C-9) sialic acid backbone and the
  natural modification sites (R2, R4-R9) with naturally occurring modifications indicated.
  Modifications at C-5 form the frequent sialic acid types N-acetylneuraminic acid
  (Neu5Ac), 2-keto-3-deoxynononic acid (KDN), and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc).
  O-acetylation (Ac) can occur at the positions C-4, and C-7/8/9. B, presentation
  of the biosynthetic pathway of O-Ac-Sias in mammalian cells. Sialic acids (red diamond)
  are conjugated to cytidine 5′-monophosphate (CMP) via the nuclear enzyme CMAS and
  are transported into the Golgi system via the CMP-sialic acid transporter SLC35A1.
  CASD1 acetylates CMP-sialic acids at position C-7 or C-9 using Ac-CoA as acetyl
  donor. Sialyltransferases conjugate O-acetylated sialic acids (with CMP as leaving
  group) to the glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids that exit the Golgi system
  via the secretory pathway. For so far unknown reasons, glycoproteins and glycolipids
  carrying O-acetylated sialic acids appear also to remain inside the Golgi system.
  Deacetylation is mediated by the sialic acid esterase SIAE that is localized extracellularly
  and in intracellular compartments. C, tissue distribution of O-acetylated sialic
  acids in the human body.
