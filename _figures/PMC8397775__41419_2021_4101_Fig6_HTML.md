caption: sEVs full of dsDNA, which could be secreted by damaged intestinal epithelial
  cells, were taken up by macrophages to activate the STING pathway and trigger inflammation.
  Inflammatory cytokines released by macrophages, such as IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-β, further
  damaged intestinal epithelial cells.
