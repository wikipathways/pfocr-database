caption: 'RES-flooding approaches modify various known and postulated redox-sensitive
  players (labeled with “–SH”) regulating manifold pathways. Examples shown include
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR[,], NF-κB[], Keap1/Nrf-2[] and β-catenin/Wnt signaling[]. Both cooperative
  and antagonistic events are elicited: e.g., PTEN and Akt3 are each inhibited by
  RES adduction, but the effects of each inhibition are antagonistic, suggesting that
  the change in signaling is dominated by the relative importance of flux through
  the pathway on PTEN/Akt3 and PTEN/Akt3’s relative RES-sensitivities. RES also modulates
  PLC activity and accelerates PIP2 hydrolysis[], further complicating the RES-dependent
  regulation. Similar issues are encountered in NF-κB stress-responsive pathway. Oxidative
  stress induced by RES or ROS triggers inflammatory NF-κB signaling through upstream
  receptors/kinases activation, leading to IKK phosphorylation. The activated IKK
  phosphorylates IκB to release NF-κB transcription factor (p50/p65-complex), triggering
  transcription[]. On the other hand, RES also reportedly covalently modifies (and
  suppresses the activity of) IKK to impede NF-κB signaling[]. The key negative regulator
  of NF-κB signaling IκB also is covalently inactivated by RES upon bulk RES-exposure
  conditions. These conflicting RES regulatory events in NF-κB signaling occur predominantly
  at low to modest HNE concentration (1–5 μM). Bolus approaches can also mask RES-regulated
  pathway intersections, such as the crosstalk between Keap1/Nrf-2 and β-catenin/Wnt
  pathways[]. See text and  for discussion.'
