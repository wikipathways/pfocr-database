caption: Plant synthetic biology concepts. (a) The design–build–test–learn (DBTL)
  cycle underpins experimental design and analysis in synthetic biology. Modified
  from Petzold et al. In the Design phase, the problem is described, the pathway selected,
  and the parts designed or selected. In the Build phase, the parts are synthesized,
  assembled, and transformed into the host organism of choice. During the Test phase,
  the modified organism is analyzed and data collected. In the Learn phase, the data
  from the Test phase are analyzed, and used to inform the next Design stage. (b)
  Type IIS restriction site-based DNA parts for meeting plant synthetic biology community
  standards. All DNA parts should be sequenced without a BsaI restriction site (at
  a minimum – BpiI and BsmBI should be avoided). Standard parts are flanked by convergent
  BsaI cut sites. The plasmid backbones should be free of BsaI/BpiI/BsmBI sites, and
  should not contain resistance genes for ampicillin/carbenicillin, or kanamycin,
  since these are commonly used in assembly. (A color version of this figure is available
  in the online journal.)
