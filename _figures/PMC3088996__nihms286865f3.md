caption: Regulatory role of ATM in cellular responses to DNA DSB repair. ATM kinase
  activity increases immediately after double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur in DNA following
  exposure to IR. ATM mediates the early stages of the rapid induction of several
  signaling pathways, which include activation of the DNA-DSB pathway, regulation
  of the cell-cycle checkpoint controls, activation of stress responses, and maintenance
  of telomeres. ‘P’ with solid arrows indicates reported phosphorylation events; dashed
  arrows represent possible signaling steps and do not imply direct interaction between
  proteins; ‘C’ indicates sequestering in cytoplasm; ‘R’ indicates repair complexes;
  and ‘T’ indicates a role for the protein in telomere metabolism. AP-1, apetala1
  transcription factor; BRCA1, breast cancer susceptibility gene product 1; c-Abl,
  abelson protein tyrosine kinase; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CHK, checkpoint kinase;
  FANCD2, fanconi anemia protein; JNK, Jun N-terminal protein kinase; MRE11, meiotic
  recombination 11 gene product; MDM2, mouse double minute 2 (p53-binding protein);
  NBS1, Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 protein (p95); SMC1, structural maintenance of
  chromosome 1; RAD50, a radiation-damage-repair-associated protein; TRF1, telomere-repeat-finding
  factor 1; hTERT, human catalytic unit of telomerase; hMOF, the human ortholog of
  the Drosophila MOF gene (males absent on the first).
