caption: The JAK/STAT signaling in prostate cancer. (1) The JAK/STAT pathway has been
  found constitutively activated in PCa cells, leading to induction of tumor cell
  proliferation and apoptosis inhibition mediated by STAT3 activation. (2) BRCA1/2
  is required for DNA repair in normal cells. However, in PCa, BRCA1 can bind STAT3
  to promote JAK/STAT3 activation. (3) AR is a well-characterized cross-talk pathway
  in PCa. When activated, AR can bind to STAT3 leading to the activation of JAK/STAT
  cascade, being important in the induction of cell proliferation and apoptosis inhibition.
  (4) Under stress conditions, ATF3 is activated and plays a crucial role in the maintenance
  of cell integrity and homeostasis. ATF3 does so by interacting with AR, leading
  to inhibition of androgen signaling and, consequently, the inhibition of cell proliferation.
  However, ATF3 is downregulated in PCa cells, suggesting that this pathway provides
  an important mechanism of defense against cancer. (5) Similarly, C/EBPδ is required
  to inhibit cell proliferation by binding to STAT3. Nevertheless, C/EBPδ is typically
  downregulated in PCa, and, therefore, it could be used as an strategy in the development
  of therapeutic drugs against PCa growth.
