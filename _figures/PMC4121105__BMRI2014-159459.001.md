caption: KEAP1/CUL3/RBX1 E3-ligase protein complex. In the absence of ROS (a), NRF2
  is regulated by the KEAP1/CUL3/RBX1 E3-ubiquitin ligase complex which targets NRF2
  for proteasomal degradation and inhibits expression of NRF2-controlled genes. The
  oxidative metabolism of estrogen through the catechol pathway induces the generation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS, b). These oxidative species induce conformational
  changes in KEAP1, which disrupt the activity of the inhibitory complex. As a consequence,
  NRF2 is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus, where it induces expression
  of cytoprotective genes containing NRF2-regulatory sequence motifs (e.g., antioxidant
  response elements, AREs). When the KEAP1/CUL3/RBX1 E3-ubiquitin ligase complex is
  compromised by genetic alteration in any of its component genes (c), NRF2 is stabilized
  and accumulated and transported to the nucleus. Under these conditions, the activation
  of cytoprotective genes becomes constitutive, which has been associated with tumor
  promotion.
