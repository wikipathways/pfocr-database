caption: Parapoxvirus, one of the dsybiotic microbiome in the breast cancer cells,
  encodes viral VEGF-E that acts through the VEGFR and triggers PI3K-AKT and MAPK-ERK
  pathway. Activated Erk and AKT pathway promotes cell growth, proliferation, and
  survival. In addition, activated AKT phosphorylates FoxO1 and shuttles its out of
  the nucleus where it is subsequently degraded. FoxO1 is regarded as tumor suppressor
  and is linked to expression of different metabolic genes. VEGF-E induced quenching
  and degradation of FoxO1 facilitates cellular proliferation with altered metabolism.
