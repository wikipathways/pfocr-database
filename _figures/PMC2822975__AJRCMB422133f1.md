caption: Asbestos has pleiotropic effects on cell signaling pathways. Either through
  direct interactions with receptors or via the genesis of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), asbestos activates cell signaling pathways that regulate gene expression
  and cell fate. Direct interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  activates the Ras-Raf-extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which
  controls expression and transcriptional activity of the Fos family members of the
  activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor. Asbestos also regulates c-Jun through
  activation of ERK5. Through AP-1, ERK1/2 and ERK5 govern outcomes that include cell
  proliferation, cell migration, and aspects of neoplastic transformation. Activation
  of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway promotes cell survival through
  NF-κB. Recent work also indicates that asbestos fibers or ROS activate signaling
  through the TNF receptor. The diverse phenotypic outcomes of asbestos exposure depend
  on fiber type, fiber dose, and the signaling pathways resident in specific cell
  types. Moreover, the physical properties of asbestos tend to promote robust and
  persistent activation of signaling through ERK and other redox-responsive kinase
  cascades.
