caption: (A) Affected network for RB1. Recurrent nodes that were significantly changed
  in ≥ 5 cancer types were selected to plot on the graph. Node color is proportional
  to the number of cancer types in which the gene was changed. The nodes shaded in
  green mainly function in the cell-cycle pathway, and the nodes shaded in pink are
  mainly from the DNA repair pathway.(B) Affected network for TP53. Recurrent nodes
  that were significantly changed in ≥ 2 cancer types were selected to plot on the
  graph. The shaded areas were for signaling pathway (blue) and cell-cycle pathway
  (red), respectively.
