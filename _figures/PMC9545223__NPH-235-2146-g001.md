caption: Schematic overview of the molecular mechanism of the RNA‐dependent DNA methylation
  (RdDM) pathway. (a) Open chromatin representing active transcription. (b) In order
  to induce the RdDM pathway, a recombinant viral DNA is developed by adding a fragment
  of target region into a Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) VIGS vector and transforming
  the vector into Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Upon infection, T‐DNA containing the
  recombinant viral genome is transcribed by the host’s RNA polymerase (in yellow)
  to produce single stranded RNA (ssRNA), which then is converted to double‐stranded
  RNA (dsRNA) by RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (in grey). DICER‐like enzymes recognize
  the dsRNA molecules and cleave them into short, interfering RNAs (siRNA). Argonaute
  (AGO4; in green) with target‐specific virus‐derived, siRNAs, directs plant‐encoded
  DNA methyltransferases to methylate cytosine residues in DNA at sites with sequence
  complementarity to the siRNA. Finally, DNA methylation induces chromatin condensation.
