caption: 'Metabolites levels and enzymatic activities of the Δgdc mutant as relative
  values to those of the wild type (shown in rectangle boxes). Log-growth-phase cells
  were diluted and cultured under the normal photoautotrophic condition (0 mM Glu)
  for 21 d. Metabolites, direct reactions (line arrows), abbreviated pathways (broken
  arrows) and enzymes (italic capital letters: GABA-AT, γ-aminobutyrate aminotransferase;
  GDC, glutamate decarboxylase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; OGDC, 2-oxoglutarate
  decarboxylase; PHAS, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase; SSADH, succinic semialdehyde
  dehydrogenase) are illustrated. The 2-oxoglutarate/succinyl semialdehyde/succinate
  route (Oxo/Sucsem/Suc route, shown by purple arrows) and GABA shunt route (green
  arrows) for completing the Synechocystis TCA cycle are indicated. Data are obtained
  from four to six independent cultures. Asterisks indicate the ratios for which the
  levels in Δgdc were significantly different from those in the WT (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01:
  unpaired two-tailed t-test). This metabolic connection section was redrawn from
  the reported metabolic network of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803–,. The values of metabolites
  levels and enzymatic activities of the wild type (WT) and Δgdc mutant are given
  in Table .'
