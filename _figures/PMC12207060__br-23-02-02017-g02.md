caption: Schematic representation illustrates the molecular mechanism regulating MTNR1A,
  NEAT1 and AANAT gene expression in renal TECs. PITX1 transcriptionally upregulates
  MTNR1A expression, while c-Fos transcriptionally downregulates AANAT expression
  in the nucleus. AANAT is the rate-limiting factor for melatonin synthesis. Albumin
  treatment reduced the viability of TECs by decreasing PITX1 and increasing c-Fos.
  In the cytosol, hnRNPL binds to MTNR1A transcripts via CA-repeat elements, decreasing
  MTNR1A degradation by EXOSC10. Melatonin binding to MTNR1A triggers upregulation
  of HO-1 levels and downregulation of cAMP levels, phosphorylated CREB and PER2.
  Luzindole, an MTNR1A antagonist, decreased the MTNR1A-mediated signaling pathway.
  The long noncoding RNA NEAT1 is increased by melatonin and exhibits circadian rhythm
  in TECs through whole gene identification. Melatonin enhances clock-controlled NEAT1
  expression in TECs by stabilizing the BMAL1 protein. Elevated clock-controlled NEAT1
  may regulate circadian genes, including MKI67, by influencing H3K27Ac and H3K4me1
  occupancy at enhancer regions of target genes. Genomic location of MTNR1A single
  nucleotide polymorphism rs374152717 (*), a donor splice site variant in intron 1
  near exon 1. MTNR1A, melatonin receptor 1A; NEAT1, nuclear enriched abundant transcript
