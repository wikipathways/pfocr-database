caption: Schematic pathway of signaling in Plasmodium. AC adenylate cyclase, camK
  calcium/calmodulin kinase B, PDE phosphodiesterase, PLC phospholipase C, PKA protein
  kinase A, PKG protein kinase G PV parasitophorous vacuole, N nuclei, SR serpentine
  receptor. Tryptophan-derivatives are able to increase citoplasmic calcium through
  PLC. Calcium increase activates adenylate cyclase that convert AMP in cAMP once
  the concentration of such molecule is augmented in response to calcium increase
  by melatonin. cAMP is able to bind the regulatory subunit of PKA (cyclic AMP-dependent
  protein kinase) leading to an allosteric change in conformation which causes unleashing
  of the catalytic subunits becoming it activated and able to phosphorylate its targets.
  The molecular downstream effects of calcium and PKA in this pathway are proposed.
