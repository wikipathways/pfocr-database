caption: 'NF-KB and IFN1 signalling in immune responses: NF-κB signalling has been
  found to activate the immune system and result in the secretion of cytokines into
  the CNS, and inflammation in the CNS. Increasing NF-κB activity is also associated
  with the inhibition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is important
  for the formation of new nervous tissue which assists in the development and progression
  of cancer. The NF-KB pathway is activated by cytokines such as TNF. In brain cancer,
  the STAT3 pathway is activated through the IL6- NF-κB signalling which results in
  an aggressive cancer.'
