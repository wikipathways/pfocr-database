caption: 'Schematic representation of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  glutaminolysis and lipid synthesis and their inhibition by polyphenols in breast
  cancer cells. During glycolysis, glucose enters the cell through the glucose transporter
  (GLUT) and then it is oxidized to pyruvate followed by reduction to lactate. Lactate
  is released from the cell through the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT). The rate
  of aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells is increased in detriment of ATP production.
  The intermediate compounds from the glycolytic pathway are further used to synthetize
  nucleotides, amino acids and lipids required for the proliferation of cancer cells
  [,,,]. The glucose transporter can be inhibited by EGCG, quercetin, phloretin, kaempferol
  [,,], PFK by resveratrol [], and MCT by kaempferol []. Abbreviations: PEP, phosphoenolyruvate;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; F-2,6-BP, fructose-2,6-biphosphate; α-KG, alpha-ketoglutarate;
