caption: The SARS-CoV-2 binds via RBD of the spike protein to ACE2. Binding triggers
  proteolytic cleavage between S1and S2 by TMPRRS2, resulting in formation of 6HB
  and fusion with the host cell membrane allowing penetration of viral RNA into the
  host cell. Viral RNA transcription and translation of viral non-structural and structural
  proteins occurs in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) after remodeling of the endoplasmatic
  reticulum (ER). The newly produced viral components assemble into complete virus
  particles which leave the cells via the Golgi apparatus where the spike protein
  undergoes proteolytic cleavage by furin. This process preferably occurs in virus
  producer cells with high TMPRSS2 expression, e.g., alveolar cells (left side). Alternatively,
  the virus can be taken up via clathrin-coated pits into endosomes, where proteolytic
  cleavage is taken over by cathepsin L. The endosomal uptake is predominant in TMPRSS2-negative
  cells, but not in cathepsin L-rich cells, such as innate immune cells and endothelial
  cells (right side). Several components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus act as PAMPs activating
  various Toll-like receptors (TLRs), resulting in massive activation of the NF-kB
  (p50/p65) pathway. The relative cellular distribution/expression differs greatly
  for the different TLRs with high levels of TLR4 and TLR2 on macrophages and endothelial
  cells, whereas only low levels are expressed on alveolar lung cells. The activation
  of TLRs will trigger activation of NF-κB pathway, which triggers HIF-1α activation
  and expression of cytokine, including TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12. HIF-1α and IL-12
  have been shown to increase furin expression. As a hypothesis for TLR activation,
  interaction of hydrophobic domains (and a distinct charged amino acid pattern) of
  the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may be necessary for dimerization and activation of
  MD2-TLR4 or TLR2-TLR1/6, triggering the TLR-typical downstream signaling pathways,
  as has been shown so far for the whole spike protein, S1 and S2. As a hypothesis
  (?), the hydrophobic six-helix bundle fusion core structure (6HB) in the post-fusion
  state of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may fit into the hydrophobic pockets of MD-2-TLR4
  or TLR2-TLR1/6 complexes, respectively. The significant change in the charge distribution
  in the Omicron spike protein, with multiple additional positively charged amino
  acid substitutions may prevent high affinity binding to the TLR complexes and/or
  insufficient dimerization of TLR complexes, leading to lower NF-kB signaling with
  lower expression of cytokines, HIF-1α, resulting in lower furin expression and insufficient
  S1/S2 cleavage, despite the presence of the polybasic furin cleavage motif.
