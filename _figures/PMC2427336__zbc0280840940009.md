caption: A schematic summarizing ER stress response pathways in cells  compensating
  for deficiency of the ER stress response kinase, PERK. In  293/PERK-K618A cells,
  presence of the dominant-negative PERK mutant interferes  with phosphorylation of
  eIF2α (middle pathway), causing  dysregulation of protein synthesis () and inhibiting
  induced ATF4 protein expression  () and its downstream  induction of CHOP (). In  such
  cells Ire1 (upper pathway) appears hyperactive in the splice  activation of XBP1
  mRNA and protein (). Likewise, ATF6 (lower pathway) remains robustly  active in
  these cells ().
