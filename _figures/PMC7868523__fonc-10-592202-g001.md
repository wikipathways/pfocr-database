caption: Molecular Pathogenesis of Thyroid Cancer. RAS/RAF/MEK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways
  are key signaling pathways in thyroid cancer pathogenesis. Mutations in RAS (RASm)
  or BRAF result in constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, causing downstream
  activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways which promotes cell growth and tumorigenesis.
  Effective agents include multikinase inhibitors (cabozantinib, vandetanib, sorafenib
  and lenvatinib) which inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) at the cell surface,
  selective RET inhibitors (selpercatinib and pralsetinib) which inhibit mutant RET
  RTK (RETm), BRAF V600E inhibitors (dabrafenib and trametinib) and the mTOR inhibitor
  everolimus. These small molecule inhibitors are used clinically for treatment of
  RAIR TC with the goal of arresting uncontrolled proliferation.
