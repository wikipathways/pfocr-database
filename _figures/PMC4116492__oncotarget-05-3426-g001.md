caption: In response to DNA damage or replicaiton stress, ATM/CHK2 and ATR/CHK1 checkpoints
  are activated, thereby promoting DNA damage repair via multiple mechanisms including
  NER, HR and TLS. DNA damage repair intermediates activate ATM/CHK2 and ATR/CHK1
  checkpoints. FANCD2-mediated signaling pathway is one of the key coordinators between
  ATM/ATR checkpoints and the repair system of NER, HR and TLS. Downregulation of
  FANCD2 by targeting RTK-PI3K-AKT-mTOR would sensitize cancer cells to DNA damage
  agents. Directly targeting FANCD2 (marked with X) could be a promising strategy
  for cancer therapy. AZD8055 (AstraZeneca), mTOR kinase inhibitor; MK2206 (Merck),
  AKT kinase inhibitor; PD0332991 (Pfizer), CDK4/6 kinase inhibitor; PF4708671 (Pfizer),
  S6K1 kinase inhibitor. NER, nucleotide excision repair; HR, homologous recombination;
  TLS, translesion DNA synthesis; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; IRS, insulin receptor
  substrate.
