caption: Monoterpene synthesis via IPP and DMAPP pathway based on the MEP pathway
  of IPP and DMAPP synthesis. The MEP pathway is built-upon pyruvate and glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate (G3P) condensation by thiamine diphosphate enzyme 1-deoxy-ᴅ-xylulose-5-phosphate
  synthase (DXS) to form 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP). The latter is reduced
  by 1-deoxy-ᴅ-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) to form MEP. In the next
  step, MEP is catalysed by 2-C-methyl-ᴅ-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase
  (MCT) to generate 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol (CD-ME). After
  phosphorylation, cyclisation and ring opening, CD-ME is converted into 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl
  4-diphosphate (HMBPP) under the catalysis of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  kinase (CMK), 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MDS) and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyldiphosphate
  synthase (HDS), respectively. The IPP and DMAPP derived from the MEP pathway are
  directly generated from HMBPP by 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase
  (HDR)—which is different from the MVA pathway [].
