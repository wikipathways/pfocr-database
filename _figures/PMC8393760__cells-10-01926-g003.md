caption: 'Purine metabolism includes three steps: de novo synthesis, salvage and breakdown
  pathways. The de novo synthesis is a multi-step process and requires the contribution
  of PRPS, four amino acids, one PRPP, two folates and three ATP to synthesise an
  inosine monophosphate (IMP). IMP may be directly catalysed into inosine by 5′-nucleotidases
  (5′NT), and then purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) converts inosine into hypoxanthine.
  HPRT catalyses the salvage synthesis of inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine
  monophosphate (GMP) from the purine bases hypoxanthine and guanine respectively,
  utilising PRPP as a co-substrate. The HPRT action causes the accumulation of hypoxanthine
  and guanine, which are converted into uric acid by XO and xanthine dehydrogenase
  (XDH) in the breakdown pathway. Additionally, APRT catalyses the salvage synthesis
  of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and IMP adenine, utilising PRPP as a co-substrate
  [].'
