caption: Regulation of viperin expression. Viperin induction is mediated by both the
  classical IFN-stimulated gene induction pathway and the IFN-independent pathway.
  The IFN-mediated viperin gene expression is regulated by ISGF3 (left panel), while
  IFN-independent viperin gene expression is regulated by IRF1 and IRF3, which can
  be activated by viral factors or by the peroxisomal MAVS signaling pathway.
