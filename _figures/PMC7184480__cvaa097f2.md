caption: (A) Schematic diagram of the RAS in the lung showing the role of ACE2 as
  a key element in the counter-regulatory axis of the RAS (elements in green; reviewed
  in Arendse et al.). ACE2, a membrane-bound enzyme is cleaved (shedding) by ADAM17
  into a soluble form released in the body fluids. ACE2 opposes the harmful effects
  on lung injury of the Ang II–AT1R axis (elements in red) by activating MasR and
  AT2R signalling. (B) ACE2 is expressed in airway epithelial cells including alveolar
  epithelial type II cells (AECII) in the lung. After infection, SARS-CoV-2 binds
  through its viral spike protein to host cell membrane-bound ACE2, thereby promoting
  viral cell entry and subsequent replication. SARS-CoV-2 requires in addition the
  cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which will process SARS-CoV-2 by enzymatic cleavage
  of the spike protein and support cell entry. Importantly, binding of SARS-CoV-2
  may lead to down-regulation of ACE2, and thus its own binding receptor required
  for cell entry. Impairment of ACE2 activity in the lung results in activation of
  the harmful Ang II–AT1R axis. This aggravates the viral pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2,
  tipping the scale in favour of lung damage. A soluble form of human ACE2 (rhACE2)
  is currently considered as a therapeutic approach to act as a decoy halting the
  interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 to lessen viral entry. In addition, an inhibitor
  for TMPRSS2, i.e. camostat mesylate, which is available and approved for other diseases,
  could be considered for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting cell entry. Pharmacological
  treatment with ARBs (C) or ACEIs (D) will modulate several components of the RAS
  either directly or by affecting feedback loops. Treatment with ARBs protects against
  lung injury by AT1R receptor blockade. The corresponding increase in Ang II and
  Ang I levels will at the same time activate the protective axis and thereby reduce
  viral pathogenicity. ARBs have been shown to increase ACE2 expression in various
  tissues, though current evidence for the lungs (particularly in human) is lacking
  (Table ). Assuming that ARBs can also up-regulate ACE2 in the lung, this will contribute
  to their protective effect. Protective Ang 1-7, can be also generated by neutral
  endopeptidase (NEP) or neprilysin. Therefore, the protective effect mediated by
  Ang1-7 is expected to be lower in response to treatment with ARNIs containing sacubitril.
  (D) Treatment with ACEIs can primarily protect from lung injury by reducing Ang
  II levels due to the inhibition of Ang I to Ang II conversion. Additional indirect
  effects supporting the protective axis can contribute to their beneficial effects.
  An overall effect on lung tissue protection could additionally be promoted by modulation
  of ACE2, albeit the data supporting this mechanism are scant (Table ). ACEi, angiotensin
  converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; ACE, angiotensin-converting
  enzyme; ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ARNI, angiotensin receptor neprilysin
  inhibitor; AT1R, angiotensin II receptor type 1; AT2R, angiotensin II receptor type
  2; MasR, Mas receptor; RAS, renin–-angiotensin system; rhACE2, recombinant human
  ACE2; TMPRSS2, type II transmembrane serine protease. Thicker arrows indicate a
  predominant pathway or an augmented activation; ↑↑ = up-regulation; ↑↓ = non-consistent
  effect.
