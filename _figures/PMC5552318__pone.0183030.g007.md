caption: (A) Illustration of Jasp-induced changes in cell morphology and adhesiveness.
  (Left) When cells are cultured at low density in serum-containing medium, cells
  tightly adhere to the dish, actin filaments assemble into stress fibers, and YAP
  predominantly localizes to the nucleus. (Right) Upon Jasp treatment, cells become
  round and weakly adhere to the dish, actin filaments further assemble into disorganized
  structures, YAP translocates to the cytoplasm, and the primary cilium is formed.
  (B) A proposed signaling pathway of Jasp-induced ciliogenesis. Jasp-induced cell
  rounding and reduced adhesion cause YAP inactivation through the inactivation of
  Src and the activation of LATS1/2 and other unidentified protein kinases. YAP inactivation
  leads to cell quiescence and thereby causes ciliogenesis. As EDTA-induced cell rounding
  and YAP inactivation do not cause ciliogenesis, other pathway(s) independent of
  YAP inactivation seem to play a role in Jasp-induced ciliogenesis.
