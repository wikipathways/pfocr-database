caption: Calcium-mediated signaling is involved in the activation of diverse subsets
  of gene transcription, including GZMB. Target gene expression can change with the
  activation of transcriptional factors in response to electrical stimulation, thus
  providing a link between intracellular Ca2+ and gene expression in immune effector
  functions. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor;
  CaM, calmodulin; CN, calcineurin; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; GZMB,
  granzyme B
