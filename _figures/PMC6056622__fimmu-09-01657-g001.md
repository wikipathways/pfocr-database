caption: Schematic view of MHC class I (MHC-I) pathways of antigen processing and
  presentation. Proteins in the cytosol engage the proteasome (1) and the peptides
  generated (2) are transported through the TAP1/2 transporter to the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). Partially folded MHC-I/β2-microgolobulin (β2m) complexes (3) are
  stabilized as part of the peptide loading complex (PLC) (4) where they may be retained
  in a peptide-receptive state. Once high affinity peptide is bound, the peptide/MHC-I
  (5) is released from the PLC and destined for the secretory pathway and the cell
  surface (6). Alternatively, partially folded MHC-I/β2m complexes (3) are stabilized
  by interaction with TAP-binding protein, related (TAPBPR) (7), loaded with peptide,
  released from TAPBPR (8), and the assembled MHC-I proceeds to the cell surface (9).
  Not illustrated are the peptide trimming enzymes (ERAAP or ERAP1/2) or the quality
  control UGGT1 interaction as described in the text.
