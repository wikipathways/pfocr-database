caption: (1) TNF-α, and IL-1β can induce the expression of TGF-β. TGF-β attaches to
  cell surface type I and II serine/threonine receptor kinases, leading to phosphorylation
  of SMAD2 and SMAD3, then makes up a complex with SMAD4. Followed by translocation
  into the nucleus, the activated SMAD complexes in conjunction with SMAD-binding
  elements and plays its role. Vitamin D binds a complex with VDR, then the complex
  directly interacts with SMAD3 and decreases binding of SMAD3 to DNA, at last resulting
  in the inhibited TGF-β-SMAD signaling pathways. (2) Renin cleaves angiotensinogen
  to angiotensin (Ang) I, which is further converted to Ang II by ACE. Ang II plays
  an important role in lung fibrogenesis by the AT1 receptor. Ang II is activated
  by AT1 receptor, directly stimulates ECM protein production, and elevates the expression
  of TGF-β, meanwhile it activates SMAD2/3 directly by the ERK/p38 pathway. Vitamin
  D can reduce the expression of rennin, and regulate TGF-β SMAD3 signaling, Vitamin
  D causes negative regulation of the RASboth of these two ways.
