caption: The role of TUDCA in modulating apoptosis in AD. TUDCA could effectively
  inhibit the induction of E2F-1, stabilization of p53, and expression of Bax, all
  of which are typically induced by Aβ. This effect appears to occur through the activation
  of protein kinase AKT. Additionally, TUDCA has the ability to inhibit apoptosis
  by preventing caspase-2 activation. Furthermore, Aβ has been found to cause dysfunction
  of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the overproduction of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), all of which play significant roles in the process of apoptosis
  in AD. These factors could create a detrimental cycle that exacerbates AD pathology,
  as shown by three blue bidirectional dashed arrows. However, TUDCA can help ameliorate
  mitochondrial dysfunction and reduce ER stress, thus providing further modulation
  of apoptosis in AD. The black arrows represent the pathways involved in apoptosis,
  while the inhibitory effects of TUDCA on these pathways are indicated by brown arrows
  with flat heads
