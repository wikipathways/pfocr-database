caption: 'Pathways have been simplified. Key: metabolic pathways strongly upregulated
  by M1/M2 macrophage activation are highlighted by red/blue colored boxes, respectively.
  Inhibitors are indicated by green boxes. Arrow width represents which pathways are
  implicated (thicker) or not (narrower) in trained M(4/13) following stimulation
  with irradiated M. tuberculosis (Mtb). Metabolites (measured by LC-MS) or enzymes
  (measured by qPCR) written in bold or in grey text are enhanced or reduced respectively
  compared with untrained macrophages. Trained M(4/13) do not employ classical activated
  macrophage metabolism – aerobic glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) –
  and instead employ alternative activated macrophage metabolism, characterized by
  production of ATP through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, coupled with the electron
  transport chain (ETC) via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), as well as enhanced
  use of the urea cycle. Glutaminolysis, FAO and ATP synthesis regulation are implicated.
  This is demonstrated by inhibitor experiments and by changed expression of metabolites.
  Abbreviations: LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NO, nitric oxide; P, phosphate; PEP,
  Phosphoenolpyruvic acid; PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase.'
