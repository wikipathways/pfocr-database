caption: 13C and 15N flux into nucleotides and precursors of the pyrimidine synthesis
  pathway from glutamine and aspartic acid in TSC2−/− cells are under mTORC1 control
  via CAD protein phosphorylation. In the graphs at left, white bars represent TSC2+/+
  cells and black bars represent TSC2−/− cells. UMPS, uridine monophosphate synthetase.
