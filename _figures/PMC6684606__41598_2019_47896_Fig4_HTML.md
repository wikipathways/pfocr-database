caption: Pathway analysis of altered metabolites. (A) Summary of pathway analysis
  with MetaboAnalyst 3.0. Larger circles, higher and closer to the Y-axis, show a
  higher impact of the concerned pathway on the organism. (B) Scheme summarizing the
  proposed mechanisms underlying the response of bumblebee to low-carbohydrate food
  stress.
