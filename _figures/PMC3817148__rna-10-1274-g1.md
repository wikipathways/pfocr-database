caption: Figure 1. The replication cycle of influenza A virus. Influenza A virus infection
  commences with attachment via the viral HA glycoprotein to host cell receptors that
  contain terminal α-2,3-linked or α-2,6-linked sialic acids and viral entry by receptor-mediated
  endocytosis. Acidification of the endosome causes a conformational change in the
  viral HA protein, exposing a fusion peptide that facilitates viral-endosome membrane
  fusion, releasing viral RNP complexes into the host cell. Viral RNP complexes are
  subsequently imported into the host cell nucleus, where the RdRp transcribes and
  replicates the negative sense vRNA genome. Genomic vRNA is replicated via a complementary
  positive-sense cRNA that is encapsidated in nucleoprotein and the RdRp. Viral mRNAs
  are transported to the cytoplasm by the NXF1 pathway for translation of viral proteins.
  Progeny viral RNP complexes are exported to the cytoplasm via the CRM1 export pathway
  and are packaged into progeny virions at cell membrane. Progeny virions are released
  by budding.
