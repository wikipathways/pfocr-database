caption: Representative scheme of the metabolic pathways activated under different
  stress conditions in non-Saccharomyces or oleaginous yeasts. The abbreviations correspond
  to reactive oxygen species (ROS), triacylglycerols (TAG), diacylglycerols (DAG),
  inorganic phosphate (Pi), nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH or
  NADP), NADPH oxidases (NOX), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK, MAPKK, and
  MAPKKK), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), transcription factors (TF), endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), malic enzyme (ME), ATP-citrate lyase or synthase (ACL), acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (ACC), malate dehydrogenase (MHD), and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH).
  ROS accumulation generates oxidative stress, which increases secondary metabolites,
  the pentose phosphate pathway, glutamate catabolism, and ER stress. Low-temperature
  conditions increase neutral fatty acid synthesis from triacylglycerols (TAG), whereas
  at high temperatures, TAG desaturation increases. In oleaginous yeasts, oligotrophic
  conditions, such as nitrogen-limitation, induce lipogenesis and TAG accumulation
  in lipid drops (LD), alleviating lipotoxicity. Based from Patel, et al., 2016 and
  Shi et al., 2017 [,]. Adapted from “TAG synthesis”, by BioRender.com (2022). Retrieved
