caption: Model for MAPK regulated induction of cytokines in IL-33 stimulated ILC2s.
  Stimulation of ILC2s with IL-33 results in activation of the IL-33 receptor. This
  triggers formation of a Myddosome in which IRAK4 and then IRAK1/2 are recruited
  to MyD88 resulting in the activation of Traf6 and then Tak1. Tak1 activates the
  IKK complex, which phosphorylates p105 resulting in the activation of Tpl2, which
  in turn activates the ERK1/2 pathway. Tak1 also activates the p38 MAPK pathway leading
  to the activation of MK2 and 3. IL-33 also activates the mTOR pathway and MK2 and
  3 promote activation of mTOR. The mechanism for this is unclear, but based on studies
  of Myd88 dependent signalling in macrophages could be due to MK2/3 promoting the
  generation of PIP3 at the plasma membrane. Both ERK1/2 and p38 promote the production
  of IL5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13 and GM-CSF while MK2/3 and mTOR selectively drive IL-6
  and IL-13 production.
