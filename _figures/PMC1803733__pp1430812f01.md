caption: The JA biosynthetic pathway. Trienoic fatty acids (18:3 and 16:3) are converted
  within the chloroplast to OPDA and dinor-OPDA, respectively. These cyclopentenone
  intermediates are transported to the peroxisome by an ATP-binding cassette transporter
  (PXA1; also known as CTS or PED3) or by a PXA1-independent pathway (not shown) and
  then reduced by OPR3. The resulting cyclopentanone compounds (OPC8 and OPC6) are
  converted to their corresponding CoA derivatives by OPC-8:0-CoA ligase. Successive
  rounds of β-oxidation yield JA. The three core enzymes in the β-oxidation cascade
  are ACX, MFP, and KAT. LOX, Lipoxygenase; AOC, allene oxide cyclase; OPC6, 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-hexanoic
  acid; OPC4, 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-butyric acid; JA, (+)-7-iso-JA.
