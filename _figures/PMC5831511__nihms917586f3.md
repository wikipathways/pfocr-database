caption: Following rapid activation of TLRs, NF-κB induces miR-210 expression in microglia/macrophages;
  however, miR-210 serves as a negative feedback regulator for the M1 activation by
  targeting NF-κB. Similarly, TLR-driven NF-kB activation upregulates the expression
  of miR-146a, which in turn down-regulates NF-kB activity by targeting two NF-kB
  upstream signaling transducers, TRAF6 and IRAK1. CNS enriched miRNA, miR-124, is
  down-regulated upon the LPS stimulation in microglia/macrophages. MiR-124 promotes
  the quiescent state of microglia/macrophages by direct repression of C/EBP-α and
  its downstream PU.1, two myeloid cell differentiation-associated transcription factors.
  Furthermore, miR-124 also contributes to the M2 phenotype of microglia/macrophages
  by increasing the production of IL-10 and TGF-β. In contrast, miR-155 expression
  is induced by TLR stimulation. This miRNA targets two negative regulators of M1
  activation, SHIP-1 and SOCS1, thereby enhancing the M1 inflammatory responses. In
  addition, miR-155 is able to inhibit the M2 phenotype by targeting SMAD2, a protein
  involved in the TGF-β pathway, and C/EBP-β, a transcription factor important for
  the expression of M2 markers. Thus, dysregulation of these miRNA pathways may skew
  microglia/macrophage activation to classic M1 phenotype that induces secondary neuronal
  death. Accordingly, decreasing the levels of miR-155 or increasing the levels of
  miR-146a or miR-124 might switch the activation to alternative M2 phenotype, thereby
  protecting the neurons against apoptosis and promoting the resolution of inflammation
  and tissue repair in the developing brain with HI injury.
