caption: Molecular pathogenesis of systemic ALK- ALCL. (A) Mutations (mut) of JAK1
  and/or STAT3 as well as the co-mutation of JAK and STAT have been implicated in
  the pathogenesis of this lymphoma. These mutations result in the constitutive activation
  of STAT (phosphorylated STAT; pSTAT3) that translocates to the nucleus and induces
  multiple genes resulting in the expression/activation of the molecules listed and
  of a T-cell lymphoma (TCL) phenotype Additionally, chimeric fusion genes with concomitant
  transcriptional and kinase activity (ROS1, TYK2) are also capable of sustaining
  the ALCL phenotype via pSTAT3. The activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is only found
  in cases without the DUSP22 rearrangement. (B) ALK- ALCL with DUSP22-IRF4 rearrangement/t(6;7)(p25.3;q32.3)
  is associated with downregulation of DUSP22 (dual specificity phosphatase 22) and
  likely its decreased phosphatase activity that may result in tumor suppressor effects
  that are yet unknown. The DUSP22-IRF4 rearrangement has been associated with a decreased
  expression of cytotoxic molecules, marked DNA hypomethylation, and an enhanced immunogenicity
  via the overexpression of immunogenic cancer-testis antigen (CTA) genes, HLA class
  II and CD58, and the downregulation of PD-L1. These mechanisms may contribute to
  the favorable prognosis seen in this group of ALK- ALCLs. Most DUSP22-rearranged
  cases also harbor a recurrent mutation in musculin (MSCE116K) that induces the expression
  of the CD30–IRF4–MYC axis. In vitro studies have shown that DUSP22 has the capacity
  to suppress TCR-induced activation/signaling and JNK signaling that could also have
  an effect on the pathogenesis of this lymphoma. In both scenarios, the presence
  or acquisition of a TP53 mutation (*) confers a bad prognosis.
