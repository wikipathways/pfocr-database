caption: 'Schematic representation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Left panel: when
  external signals are received, the Hippo signaling pathway is switched on. Phosphorylation
  of MST1/2 causes activation; the activated MST1/2 phosphorylates LATS1/2 and the
  activated LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP. p-YAP is retained in the cytoplasm and the
  YAP in the nucleus is inactive. Right panel: when the external stimulation is removed,
  the Hippo pathway is switched off. YAP is not phosphorylated and can shuttle to
  the nucleus and interact with TEAD1 to induce the transcription of target genes
  and promote cell proliferation.'
