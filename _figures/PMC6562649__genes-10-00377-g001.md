caption: MicroRNA (miRNA) pathway. miRNA biogenesis starts in the nucleus where partially
  self-complementary RNA polymerase II or III transcripts from a miRNA gene or from
  an intronic region assemble into a hairpin-like structure known as primary (pri)-miRNA.
  Pri-miRNAs are cleaved by the DiGeorge Critical Region 8 (Dgcr8)/Drosha complex
  and transported to the cytoplasm via Exportin 5. In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are
  cleaved by the Dicer/HIV-1 TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) nuclease complex, thereby
  giving rise to a miRNA duplex. This duplex is then loaded onto the Argonaute (AGO)
  protein, a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where one of the
  two strands is discarded while the other serves to search complementary transcripts.
  Targets bound by miRNAs exhibit reduced translational efficiency, mainly as a consequence
  of mRNA cleavage or deadenylation. The miRNA pathway can be modulated by introducing
  miRNA mimics (green) or miRNA inhibitors (red). shRNA is small hairpin RNA.
