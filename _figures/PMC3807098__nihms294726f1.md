caption: 'Diagram of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway showing the chemical structure
  of some of the intermediates. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme
  A (HMG-CoA) reductase by statins and inhibition of squalene synthase by lapaquistat
  are shown. Isoprenoids (isopentenyl-PP, gernayl-PP, farnesyl-PP, and geranylgeranyl-PP)
  are important modulators of various signaling pathways involving Rho GTPases (RhoA,
  Rac1, and Cdc42). Note that squalene synthase is the first committed step towards
  cholesterol biosynthesis, which would not deplete cellular levels of isoprenoids.
  PP: pyrophosphate; eNOS: endothelial nitric oxide synthase; t-PA: tissue-type plasminogen
  activator; ET-1: endothelin-1; PAI-1: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.'
