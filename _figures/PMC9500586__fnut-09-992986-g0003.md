caption: BCMO1 on transport, signaling and degradation of vitamin A metabolism. Retinol
  from diet is transported throughout the vasculature and oxidized by retinol dehydrogenase
  10 (encoded by RHD10) and alcohol dehydrogenases (encoded by ADHs) into retinal
  and then oxidized into retinoic acid (RA) by aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1, A2, and
  A3 (encoded by ALDH1A1-3). Retinal was also reversible generation to vitamin A by
  short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (encoded by DHRS3). β-carotene was another alternative
  pathway which conversed to retinal by β-carotene-15,15-dioxygenase (encoded by BCMO1).
  Subsequently, on one hand, RA will be combined with binding to cellular retinol
  binding protein 2 (CRBP2) and then activate gene expression together with retinoid-X-receptor
  (RXR), retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoic acid receptor element (RARE). On
  another hand, RA can diffuse from cell and degraded by cytochrome P450 26A1 (CYP26)
  enzyme. Created with BioRender.com.
