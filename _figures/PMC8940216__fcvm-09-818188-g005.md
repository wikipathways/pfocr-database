caption: The mechanism of cardiac resident and non-resident macrophages in regulating
  cardiac fibrosis. When the heart is damaged or cardiomyocytes die, large amounts
  of DAMPs are released from the nucleus. They combine with PRRs on the cell membrane
  to activate the MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway and produce a large number of inflammatory
  factors and chemokines. Among them, MCP-1 will bind to the monocyte membrane receptor
  CCR2, so that it will be infiltrated into the heart and become non-resident macrophages.
  At this time, on the one hand, cardiac resident macrophages are replaced by cardiac
  non-resident macrophages, on the other hand, cardiac fibroblasts are activated by
  it to transform into myofibroblasts, and then a large number of collagen fibers
  are produced, which leads to the heart fibrosis.
