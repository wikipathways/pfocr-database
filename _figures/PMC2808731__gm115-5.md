caption: Overview of the key metabolic changes induced by PPARδ stimulation. (a) Metabolic
  pathways altered in PPARδ agonist treated mice liver. Metabolites increased relative
  to control tissue are in red; metabolites decreased relative to control tissue are
  in blue. (b) Linoleate pathway altered in PPARδ agonist treated mice liver. Metabolites
  increased relative to control tissue are in red; metabolites decreased relative
  to control tissue are in blue. (c) Linolenate pathway altered in PPARδ agonist treated
  mice liver. Metabolites increased relative to control tissue are in red; metabolites
  decreased relative to control tissue are in blue. (d) Metabolic pathways altered
  in PPARδ agonist treated mice skeletal muscle. Metabolites increased relative to
  control tissue are in red; metabolites decreased relative to control tissue are
  in blue.
