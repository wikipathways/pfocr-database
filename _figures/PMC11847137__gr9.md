caption: Schemic working model revealing the possible role of ZC3H15 in mediating
  BCP. ZC3H15 expression levels were upregulated in spinal cord tissues of mice during
  BCP progression, which was involved in oxidative stress in neurons through maintaining
  KEAP1 stability and inducing NRF2 degradation, as well as inflammatory response
  in microglial cells through blocking the IκBα/NF-κB signaling pathway. These events
  mediated by ZC3H15 finally contributed to the progression of BCP
