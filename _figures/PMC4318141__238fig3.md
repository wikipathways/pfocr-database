caption: Maintenance of genome stability through the heterochromatin pathway. Centromeric
  heterochromain is essential for normal segregation of chromosomes during mitosis,
  and defects in this pathway result in aneuploidy. H3K9me3 and binding of HP-1 are
  hallmarks of heterochromatin. At pericentromeric heterochromatin, SETDB1 monomethylates
  H3K9, whereas Suv39 converts H3K9me1 to H3K8me2/3. Disruption of Suv39 function
  results in aneuploidy and lymphoma development in mice. Active deacetylation is
  also important for centromeric heterochromatin. Treatment of cells with the class
  I and II histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA results in abnormal mitosis. Similarly,
  Suv39 and SETDB1 are essential for telomeric heterochromatin. At telomeres, disruption
  of Suv39 results in loss of H3K9me2/3 and a depletion of HP-1 recruitment. However,
  Suv39 mutant telomeres contain increased H3K9me1 mediated by SETDB1 and exhibit
  abnormal telomere lengthening. Overexpression of SETDB1 has been reported in some
  cancers. Whereas centromeres depend on type I and II HDACs, the sirtuin deacetylase
  SIRT6 is essential at telomeres. Lack of SIRT6 in mice results in telomere fusions
  and premature senescence. In other contexts, SIRT6 functions as a tumor suppressor.
