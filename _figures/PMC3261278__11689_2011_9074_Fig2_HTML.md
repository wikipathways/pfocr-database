caption: 'Classes of potential overlap in synaptic mechanisms between ASD genes/proteins
  and pathways involved in FXS: (1) proteins involved in other forms of ASD may be
  in the signaling cascade for activation of FMRP-regulated translation; (2) FMRP
  may directly regulate proteins involved in different forms of ASD; and (3) convergence
  of glutamate and GABA pathway defects in FXS and ASD due to dysregulation of proteins
  generally important in maintaining inhibitory/excitatory balance and balance of
  activity in brain glutamate and GABA systems'
