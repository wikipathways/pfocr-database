caption: The cartoon diagram demonstrates the pathogenic processes of amyloid-beta
  peptide (Aβ) and tau protein. Through the amyloidogenic pathway, the full-length
  amyloid precursor protein (APP) is sequentially cleaved by β-secretase (encoded
  by beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 or BACE1) and γ-secretase
  to generate Aβ. Newly synthesized APP is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (GA) for protein maturation. The acidic pH in the trans-Golgi
  network (TGN) or the late GA is optimal for BACE1 activity, with production of secreted
  Aβ; the sequential amyloidogenic cleavages of full-length APP by β- and γ-secretase
  also generate soluble APP-beta (sAPPβ) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD),
  though these are not depicted in the diagram. A portion of the full-length APP reaching
  the plasma membrane may be subjected to the non-amyloidogenic cleavage by α- and
  then γ-secretase to release the soluble APP-alpha (sAPPα), the p3 fragment, and
  the AICD. Another portion of the full-length APP may also be endocytosed into early
  endosomes and possibly be rerouted to the acidic recycling endosomes (REs; not depicted),
  where BACE1 resides, for intracellular production of Aβ. Furthermore, extracellular
  Aβ can also be taken up through receptor binding and subsequent internalization,
  resulting in its accumulation within various intracellular compartments, including
  endosomes, multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and mitochondria (not depicted). The extracellular
  Aβ monomers aggregate into oligomers and then into fibrils, eventually forming senile
  plaques. Tau protein is a microtubule-binding protein, which is hyperphosphorylated
  in AD neurons. The phosphor-tau monomer may also aggregate into tau oligomers and,
  finally, into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The intraneuronal Aβ species also
  oligomerize or even mix with tau proteins to form mixed aggregates. The extracellular
  senile plaques, the extracellular and intraneuronal Aβ oligomers, as well as tau
  oligomers and NFTs, together lead to excessive production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), Ca2+ overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disrupted energy homeostasis,
  ultimately causing neuronal death. In addition to those pictured above, other pathogenic
  mechanisms are not demonstrated in this figure due to limited space. For example,
  loss of tau binding destabilizes microtubules, thus compromising anterograde axonal
  transport of proteins, mitochondria, and vesicles from soma to the nerve terminals,
  which may negatively impact nerve transmission. Conversely, neurotrophic factors,
  especially neurotrophins, secreted from target cells also fail to be retrogradely
  transported from the nerve terminal back to the soma to nourish the neurons, also
  leading to neuronal demise. Please see the text for more details.
