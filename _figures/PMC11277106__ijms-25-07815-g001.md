caption: Host-secreted melatonin effect on Plasmodium parasites. Melatonin is secreted
  in a circadian manner by the pineal gland. The melatonin released into the bloodstream
  interacts with the Plasmodium parasites in infected erythrocytes, triggering a signaling
  cascade. Melatonin binds to a still unidentified melatonin receptor in Plasmodium,
  activating PLC and resulting in the production of IP3 and DAG. IP3 then activates
  a yet unknown IP3 receptor (IP3R), resulting in the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic
  reticulum to the cytosol. Concurrently, melatonin enhances cAMP production by adenylyl
  cyclase, leading to PfPKA activation. Additionally, the kinase PfPK7 plays a role
  in the melatonin pathway, modulating the expression of genes involved in the ubiquitin–proteasome
  system and mitochondria division. The nuclear protein MORC is also associated with
  melatonin-regulated gene expression and chromatin structure organization. Similarly,
  PfeIK1 involved in the regulation of protein translation plays a central role in
  the melatonin signaling pathway in Plasmodium. All the signaling pathways activated
  by melatonin in the parasite lead to increased parasitemia and synchronization of
  the asexual blood stages inside the host. PLC—Phospholipase C; IP3—Inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate;
