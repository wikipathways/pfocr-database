caption: CTLA-4 coligation can reverse AICD induced by ligation of the TCR complex.
  In the signaling pathway, CTLA-4–PI3K activates PKB/Akt by phosphorylation at Thr-308.
  CTLA-4 also inactivates proapoptotic BAD by phosphorylation at Ser-136. BAD phosphorylation
  at Ser-136 leads to binding to 14–3–3 proteins and frees Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 to mediate
  mitochondrial-dependent cell survival. BAD otherwise promotes cell death by sequestering
  Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 leading to the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis. Inactivated BAD
  induced by CTLA-4 ligation is also accompanied by increased Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 expression.
  CTLA-4–PI3K-PKB/Akt maintenance of cell survival under conditions of anergy induction
  provides a potential mechanism to ensure long-term tolerance in immunity. CTLA,
  cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen; AICD, antigen-induced cell death; TCR, T-cell receptor;
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; BAD, Bcl-2 antagonist
