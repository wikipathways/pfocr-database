caption: SPN93 targets serine proteases of the Toll proteolytic cascade in beetle
  larvae. The β-1,3-glucan bound by GNBP3 recruits zymogen form of MSP and activates
  the protease cascade composed of MSP, SAE, and SPE (). Activated SPE converts pro-Spätzle
  into processed Spätzle leading to the production of AMPs via the Toll receptor-mediated
  signaling pathway and also initiates the melanin synthesis by activation of pro-phenoloxidase
  (pro-PO) and pro-serine protease homolog 1 (pro-SPH1) via a PO-SPH1 melanization
  complex. The N-terminal serpin domain of twin-domain serpin SPN93 inactivates aSPE,
  whereas the C-terminal domain inactivates aMSP and aSAE.
