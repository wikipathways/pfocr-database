caption: Regulation of insulin clearance by CEACAM1-L. (1.) Insulin binding to the
  insulin receptor (IR) induces its autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of
  downstream substrates such as the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and CEACAM1-L.
  Phosphorylation of CEACAM1-L on Tyr488, which requires an intact Ser503 residue,
  mediates its indirect association with IR to increase the rate of endocytosis of
  the insulin-insulin receptor complex into clathrin pits/vesicles of the hepatocytes,
  facilitating subsequent insulin degradation and clearance. (2.) Phosphorylated CEACAM1
  can bind to SHP-2 to sequester the phosphatase and subsequently, mediate more sustained
  phosphorylation of the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway that transduces the metabolic effects
  of insulin, such as inhibiting gluconeogenesis (via phosphorylating and nuclear
  exclusion of forkhead box protein O1 (Foxo1), among others [,,]). The physiologic
  correlation of this CEACAM1 expression is underlined by the negative effect of Foxo1
  activation on Ceacam1 expression []. Furthermore, CEACAM1-L–mediated IR internalization
  via clathrin-coated pits (3.) enhances the exposure of the insulin receptor tyrosine
  kinase to its endogenous substrates (IRS-1), supporting sustained IRS-1/PI3K/AKT
  signaling until insulin is degraded and removed. Single-headed black arrows indicate
  a chain of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events by the indicated insulin receptor
  tyrosine kinase (IR), Ser/Thr kinases (PI3K/AKT), and SHP-2 phosphatase. Double-headed
  black arrows denote the physical (indirect) interaction between phosphorylated-CEACAM1-L
  (pCEACAM1) and the IR to stabilize the insulin-receptor endocytosis complex and
  increase its uptake into the endocytotic vesicles.
