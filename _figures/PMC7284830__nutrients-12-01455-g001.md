caption: 'Examined genetic variants involved in folate and vitamin D metabolic pathways.
  Examined folate-related genetic variants reside within key genes coding for the
  enzymes (blue) involved in three interconnected pathways which support activities
  of folate in the methionine cycle, which allows for regulation homocysteine, and
  pathways related to the synthesis of thymidylate (thymine precursor) and purines.
  These pathways are interconnected as they rely on the same pool of reduced folates
  within the cell, so disruption to any of these pathways via genetic variation can
  lead to changes in Hcy levels []. RFC1 is a carrier protein which transports circulating
  folates into target cells. Hcy may be regulated through an alternative folate-independent
  process—the transsulfuration pathway. Hcy is converted to cysteine in this pathway
  via CSE and CBS. Vitamin D is previously shown to influence CBS activity [], and
  this is the suggested mechanism, explaining previous reports of Hcy and vitamin
  D levels being inversely related [,]. Examined vitamin D-related genetic variants
  reside within genes coding for the key enzymes (red) involved in vitamin D synthesis
  and metabolism, which may influence vitamin D levels and/or activity and therefore
  have the potential to influence vitamin D’s role in influencing Hcy levels. Abbreviations:
