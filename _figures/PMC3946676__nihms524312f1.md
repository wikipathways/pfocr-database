caption: 'Glucose-derived metabolites can be used to generate pyruvate or to supply
  precursors for the pentose phosphate pathway and de novo serine synthesis. Glucose-derived
  pyruvate can be metabolized to lactate in the cytosol or transported into mitochondria
  via the pyruvate carrier. Mitochondrial pyruvate can then be used for the synthesis
  of acetyl-CoA and citrate. Under certain circumstances, citrate can also be generated
  by reductive carboxylation of glutamine. Biosynthetic reactions also require reducing
  equivalents in the form of NADPH, which can be supplied by cytosolic citrate, via
  isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and the malic enzyme (ME), or by the pentose phosphate
  pathway.Abbreviations: FAS – Fatty acid synthase, ACC – Acetyl-CoA carboxylase,
