caption: Apoptotic pathways, intrinsic and extrinsic. The extrinsic pathway is triggered
  through the death ligand. While the intrinsic pathway is triggered by cell stress
  or DNA damage. Both pathways lead to a final common pathway which activate caspases
  that cleave regulatory molecules, lead up to the death of the cell
