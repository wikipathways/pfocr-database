caption: The mechanisms of tumorigenesis attributable to FA mutations. FA genes maintain
  genomic integrity through the different phases of the cell cycle, by participating
  in the DDR process, replication fork protection, normal centrosome function, and
  spindle assembly checkpoints. Mutations on different FA genes are involved in different
  mechanisms during the cell cycle, causing genomic instability, and causing a predisposition
  to cancer.
