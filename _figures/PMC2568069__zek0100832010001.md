caption: 'Structures and abbreviated names for metabolites in the D2HN melanin biosynthetic
  pathway and related shunt pathways in W. dermatitidis. Previously, T4HN was believed
  to be made directly from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA; however, the present study
  shows that T4HN is a deacetylation product of AT4HN, which is made via a WdPks1p
  enzyme from malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA or possibly malonyl-CoA only (). The metabolites
  shown in the two rectangles with dashed lines have not previously been reported
  for W. dermatitidis or other brown/black fungi; however, YWA1 is a known melanin
  precursor in A. nidulans and A. fumigatus. The reactions that metabolize T4HN to
  D2HN and then melanin have been reported for Verticillium dahliae, Magnaporthe grisea,
  and other fungi (, ), as well as for W. dermatitidis (, , ). Reaction types are
  indicated as follows: (−Ac), deacetylation; (O), oxidation; (H), reduction; and
  −H2O, dehydration. Tricyclazole (Tr) specifically inhibits the pathway at the sites
  indicated. The proposed intermediates in brackets are extremely unstable and have
  not been isolated from fungi. Other abbreviations: 3AF, 3-acetylflaviolin; T3HN,
  1,3,8-trihydroxynaphthalene; 4-HS, 4-hydroxyscytalone; 5-HS, 5-hydroxyscytalone;
  2-HJ, 2-hydroxyjuglone; 3-HJ, 3-hydroxyjuglone; 4,8-DHT, 4,8-dihydroxytetralone;
  3,4,8-THT, 3,4,8-trihydroxytetralone; YWA1, 2,3-dihydro-2,5,6,8-tetrahydroxy-2-methyl-4H-naphtho[2,3-b]pyran-4-one.'
