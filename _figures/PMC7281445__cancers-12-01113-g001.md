caption: 'Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)/TNF-Receptor 1 (TNFR1)-mediated signalling and
  cell death checkpoints. Following binding of TNF to TNFR1, two complexes can be
  assembled: the TNFR1-associated Complex I (gene-activation) and a TNFR1-devoid Complex
  II (cell death induction) []. Complex I formation starts with the recruitment of
  TNFR1-Associated Death Domain protein (TRADD) and Receptor-Interacting serine/threonine
  Kinase 1 (RIPK1) to the Death Domain (DD) of TNFR1. TRADD further recruits TNFR-Associated
  Factor 2 (TRAF2) and cellular Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (cIAP)1/2. cIAP1/2
  poly-ubiquitinate (ubiquitin linked through K11, K48 or K63) several components
  of Complex I. A recent report indicates that cIAP1, through K48 ubiquitination of
  RIPK1, promotes the degradation of the latter, thus limiting induction of cell death
  []. cIAP1/2-formed chains also recruit the Linear UBiquitin chain Assembly Complex
  (LUBAC), which further modifies several components with M1-linked ubiquitin, stabilizing
  Complex I. The absence of cIAPs and/or LUBAC results in reduced ubiquitination in,
  and stability of, Complex I and promotes the formation of Complex II. In complex
  I, cIAPs- and LUBAC-formed chains recruit the TGF-Beta Activated Kinase 1 (TAK1)/TAK1-Binding
  Proteins (TAB) complex and several Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) Essential Modulator
  (NEMO)-containing complexes. The TAB/TAK complex activates Mitogen-Activated Protein
  Kinase (MAPK) pathways and allows for the activation of the NF-κB pathway by NEMO/Inhibitor
  of NF-κB Kinase α (IKKα)/IKKβ. IKKα/β, IKKε and TANK-Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) directly
  phosphorylate RIPK1 [,,,] and thereby inhibit its autoactivation (checkpoints #1
  and #2). This impedes RIPK1 detachment from Complex I and thus Complex II formation.
  A similar function is fulfilled by the p38 MAPK target MK2 [,,] in the cytosol (checkpoint
  # 3). Downstream TNF-target genes include deubiquitinases (like CYLD and A20), pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, as well as proteins like cellular FLICE-Like Inhibitory Protein (cFLIP)
  which inhibit cell death initiation (cf part 1.3) at the level of complex II (checkpoint
  # 4) []. Whilst not represented here, some ubiquitinated RIPK1 and RIPK3 have also
  been detected in Complex II.'
