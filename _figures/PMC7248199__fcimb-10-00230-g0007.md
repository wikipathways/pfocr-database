caption: Putative pathway showing regulatory relationships of key genes to NFκB activation
  transcriptionally regulated by NLRC5. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed seven
  genes (pink fill) which were significantly upregulated after NLRC5 KD macrophages
  were infected with LPAIV H5N2 and are indicative of activation of the NFκB gene
  response. The dashed lines represent an indirect relationship, and a solid black
  or pink line represents a direct relationship. The solid white molecules are the
  intermediate factors which take part in activation of NFκB and were also observed
  to be upregulated.
