caption: Canonical and non-canonical mechanisms of PHD2 action in target cells. In
  the presence of O2, Fe2+, vitamin C and α-ketoglutarate, PHD2 hydroxylates key proline
  residues in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF1α, and, thereby, induce
  degradation of HIF1α via ubiquitin proteosomal degradation pathway (canonical signaling).
  Besides hydroxylating HIF1α, PHD2 can also hydroxylate other targets such as 10–11
  translocation dioxygenase (TET)1 and TET2 to induce their degradation (non-canonical).
  PHD2 hydroxylation of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) can modify its interaction
  with other nuclear proteins to regulate BRD4-mediated transcriptional activity.
  PHD2 is also known to be localized in the nucleus and induce hydroxylation of methyl
  cytosine, and, thereby, regulate transcription of target genes epigenetically.
