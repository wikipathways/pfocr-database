caption: Central role of PA phosphatase in the synthesis of triacylglycerol and membrane
  phospholipids in mammalian cells. The structures of CDP-diacylglycerol, PA, diacylglycerol,
  and triacylglycerol are shown with the C16:0 and C18:1 fatty acyl groups. PA phosphatase
  plays a major role in governing whether cells utilize PA for the synthesis of triacylglycerol
  via diacylglycerol or for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids via CDP-diacylglycerol.
  The PA phosphatase reaction is counterbalanced by the conversion of diacylglycerol
  to PA. The major phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine
  are synthesized from the PA-derived diacylglycerol via the CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine
  branches, respectively, of the Kennedy pathway. Phosphatidylcholine is also synthesized
  from phosphatidylethanolamine by the three-step methylation reactions using AdoMet
  as a methyl donor. Phosphatidylserine is derived from phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine
  via a base-exchange reaction, and its decarboxylation produces phosphatidylethanolamine.
  In addition to their roles in lipid synthesis, PA and diacylglycerol are known to
  facilitate membrane fission/fusion events () and play roles in vesicular trafficking
  (). More comprehensive pathways of lipid synthesis may be found in Ref. . DAG, diacylglycerol;
  TAG, triacylglycerol; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; CL, cardiolipin;
  PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; Cho,
  choline; Etn, ethanolamine.
