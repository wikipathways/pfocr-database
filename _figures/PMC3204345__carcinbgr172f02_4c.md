caption: 'Different modes of Smad phosphoisoform signaling in normal epithelium and
  neoplasms. Ligand-dependent pSmad3L signaling in normal epithelial cells (A) gives
  way to constitutive pSmad3L signaling in tumor cells (B). (A) In normal epithelial
  cells, the RTK activated by growth factor (GF) results in activation of the Ras/MAPK
  pathway, further leading to mitogenic pSmad3L signaling. pSmad3L forms a heterodimeric
  complex with Smad4, and moves to the nucleus (supplementary Figure S1 is available
  at Carcinogenesis Online). The nuclear Smad oligomer binds to DNA and associates
  with other TFs to transmit a mitogenic signal by upregulating transcription of c-Myc
  gene (supplementary Figures S2 and S3 are available at Carcinogenesis Online). In
  normal epithelial cells, pSmad3L appears only transiently in response to GFs such
  as epidermal growth factor (left) and is rapidly reversed to cytostatic pSmad3C
  signaling once GFs are absent (right). (B) In tumor cells, somatic mutants such
  as a hyperactive Ras mutant constitutively induce the phosphorylation of Smad3 at
  its linker region; this pSmad3L loses sensitivity to growth inhibition by pSmad3C
  (left). In this case, pSmad3L continues to transmit its mitogenic signal even without
  extracellular GFs (right; supplementary Figure S2 is available at Carcinogenesis
  Online). Protumorigenic TGF-β signaling: involvement of the pSmad2L/C (C) and pSmad3L/C
  (D) pathways. (C) Ras activates MAPK, which phosphorylates Smad2L and Smad3L (left).
  After the COOH-tail phosphorylation of cytoplasmic pSmad2L by TβRI, pSmad2L/C undergoes
  translocation to the nucleus, where it interacts with pSmad3L and Smad4. Together
  with TFs, the heterotrimeric complex of pSmad2L/C and pSmad3L with Smad4 stimulates
  MMP-9 transcription and cellular invasion (right). (D) TGF-β inhibits cell growth
  by downregulating c-Myc oncoprotein via the pSmad2C and pSmad3C pathways (left);
  TGF-β signaling in turn enhances cell growth by upregulating c-Myc via the CDK4-dependent
  pSmad2L/C and pSmad3L/C pathways (right).'
