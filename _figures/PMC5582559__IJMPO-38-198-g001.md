caption: The insulin-like growth factor 1-signaling pathway in cells. Insulin-like
  growth factor 1 activates both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathway resulting in cell proliferation, increased protein synthesis,
  and increased glucose metabolism. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activates nuclear
  factor-κB for cell survival and inhibits apoptosis through inhibition of BAD and
  FKHR. Insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins modulate the bioavailability of
  insulin-like growth factor through direct binding in the extracellular space. Insulin-like
  growth factor-binding proteins also exert several insulin-like growth factor-independent
  effects through direct interaction with cell membrane-bound proteins, such as integrins
