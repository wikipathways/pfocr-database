caption: Targeting LCSCs by suppression of autophagy and Nanog.Autophagy positively
  regulated LCSCs by suppressing p53 and favoring the activity of Nanog. Mitophagy
  suppressed p53 which otherwise was activated by PINK1 on mitochondria to downregulate
  Nanog. Autophagy mediated HGF binding with its receptor Met to activate STAT3 which
  was also phosphorylated by IL-6, OB-R and TLR4. The pSTAT3 and Nanog directly interacted
  to trigger Twist1-CD24 axis. Nanog, the downstream of TLR4 and PreS1, suppressed
  p53 by phosphorylation of Numb and destabilization of Numbp53 complex via the Nanog-AURKA-aPKCζ
  pathway. Moreover, Nanog upregulated the level of ICAM-1, ABCB1 and ABCG2 which
  favored the self-renewal and chemoresistance of LCSCs. The autophagy inhibitor chloroquine
  could block the self-renewal of LCSCs. It inhibited autophagy by decreasing autophagosome–lysosome
  fusion which formed autolysosomes to degrade the cytoplasmic components. Chloroquine
  may block pSTAT3 and Nanog and keep the p53 activity from being suppressed by autophagy
  in LCSCs. On the other hand, the Nanog-targeting shRNA via lentiviral particles
  could efficiently block the expression of Nanog at both mRNA and protein levels
  by cleavage of Nanog mRNA. Nanog silence by shRNA which showed a long-term depletion
  of the targeted gene impaired both the self-renewal and the chemoresistance of LCSCs.
  Chloroquine and Nanog shRNA may provide potential LCSC-targeting approaches by the
  suppression of autophagy and Nanog respectively.ABCG2, ATP-binding cassette G 2;
