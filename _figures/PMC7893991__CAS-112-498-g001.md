caption: Summary of metabolic pathways in cancer cells. Tumor cells consume more glucose
  and glutamine than do non–proliferating normal cells. Both nutrients either fuel
  central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation
  [oxphos]) to produce energy or are converted into building blocks of macromolecules,
  such as nucleotides, some amino acids, and lipids. The pentose‐phosphate pathway
  and one‐carbon metabolism also generate antioxidants such as NADPH and glutathione.
  Acetyl‐CoA (Ac‐CoA) is an intermediate in the TCA cycle, a substrate for lipids
  and an acetyl donor in protein acetylation. Note that TCA cycle and oxphos activity
  in cancer cells is higher than in normal cells, and that some lactate (Lac) is derived
  from glutamine. Amino acid (AA) uptake is also upregulated in cancer cells. AA serve
  as building blocks of proteins, but some also play important roles in metabolic
  pathways in cancer cells. Note that protein synthesis and RNA/DNA synthesis consume
  high levels of energy. Pyr, pyruvate
