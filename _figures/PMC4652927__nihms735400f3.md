caption: a. EC influences on VTA synaptic signaling. Endocannabinoids produced by
  dopaminergic VTA neurons act on CB1Rs on nearby glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals
  before being degraded by ABHD6 or MAGL. CB1Rs mediate robust inhibition of GABA
  inputs arising from the pallidus, RMTg nucleus and local interneurons onto VTA DA
  cells  and most evidence points to a role for 2-AG but not AEA in these processes,
  . CB1Rs are also localized on glutamatergic terminals synapsing on VTA DA neurons,
  with relatively greater expression on VGLUT1-positive terminals of cortical origin
  compared with VGLUT2-expressing terminals of subcortical origin. Extensive evidence
  demonstrates EC-mediated suppression of glutamate signaling in VTA. Thus, ECs play
  a prominent role in fine-tuning the activity of the mesolimbic DA projection through
  modulation of both excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the VTA. b. EC influences
  on NAc synaptic signaling. The majority of NAc neurons (>90%) are GABAergic medium
  spiny neurons (MSNs) that comprise the direct and indirect projection pathways.
  Direct pathway MSNs (dMSNs) project to midbrain regions including the VTA and activation
  of this pathway increases behavior toward a stimulus (approach or appetitive behavior).
  Indirect pathway MSNs (iMSNs) project to the ventral pallidum (VP) and activation
  of this pathway increases the stimulus avoidance. dMSNs express excitatory D1 DA
  receptors and iMSNs express inhibitory D2 DA receptors, and thus reward-related
  phasic DA release activates the direct pathway and inhibits the indirect pathway,
  thereby increasing approach behavior and reducing avoidance behavior. NAc MSN activity
  is also heavily modulated by glutamatergic inputs from the PFC, BLA and ventral
  hippocampus that express CB1Rs, CB1-mediated suppression of excitatory signaling
  (EC-LTD) is preferentially active at iMSN synapses possibly resulting from D2 receptor-mediated
  EC production from iMSN cell bodies. Thus, increased NAc EC formation preferentially
  reduces excitatory input to iMSNs vs. dMSNs, resulting in decreased avoidance behavior.
  Through these mechanisms, increased EC signaling in the NAc increases approach behavior
  while reducing avoidance-related processing thereby enhancing appetitive responding
  toward a stimulus. CB1Rs are also expressed on terminals of fast-spiking interneurons
  (FSIs) in the NAc, the majority of which are electrically and chemically coupled
  and provide direct innervation to adjacent MSNs. FSIs exert important influence
  on the synchronization of neural ensemble activity and thus EC signaling may also
  exert critical influence on NAc output through feed-forward modulation of MSN network
  activity.
