caption: Pathways of subcellular sphingolipid transport in yeast. Ceramide is synthesized
  in the ER and transported by vesicular-dependent (1) and -independent (1a) pathways
  to the Golgi compartment. Conversion to complex sphingolipids (IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C)
  is followed by migration from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane (2) or
  to vacuoles (3). In the sphingolipid recycling pathway, transport from the plasma
  membrane to vacuoles (4), or from vacuoles to the plasma membrane or the Golgi compartment
  (5 or 6), is selective between sphingolipids. Thus, in normal yeast, IPC accumulates
  in vacuoles, whereas M(IP)2C and to a lesser extent MIPC accumulate in the plasma
  membrane. In NCR1Y 718D strains, recycling is disturbed such that MIPC and M(IP)2C
  accumulate in the vacuole. The sequestration of MIPC results in diminished M(IP)2C
  synthesis and up-regulation of biosynthesis of MIPC from IPC.
