caption: The pathway for de novo biosynthesis of thiamine in the archaeon Haloferax
  volcanii is an apparent hybrid of bacterial and yeast pathways. Yeast and bacterial
  like steps are shaded by purple and blue, respectively, with associated enzymes
  of thiamine biosynthetic indicated in text with similar color coding. Hfx. volcanii
  homologs are indicated by gene locus tag in green. Question mark (?) designated
  enzyme is yet unassigned. THI4-SH specifies the catalytic cysteine side chain. THI4-C = CH
  indicates the dehydroalanine form of the enzyme after sulfur transfer. The sulfur
  atom associated with formation of the thiazole ring is highlighted in red. In the
  Hfx. volcanii model for thiamine biosynthesis, the thiazole moiety of thiamine (4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl)thiazole
  phosphate; HET-P or THZ-P) is generated by a yeast-like mechanism. HvThi4 (HVO_0665)
  converts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and glycine to ADP-thiazole (ADT),
  which predicted to be hydrolyzed to THZ-P by a yet to be identified NUDIX-type hydrolase
  []. The remaining steps of thiamine biosynthesis are related to bacterial systems.
  In particular, the PurM-like AIR synthetase HVO_1557 is predicted to form 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole
  (synonym 5-aminoimidazole ribotide; AIR), which serves as a substrate for a ThiC-like
  S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)-dependent HMP-P synthase (HVO_2154) in the generation
  of 4-amino-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P). Once generated, HMP-P
  is phosphorylated by a bacterial ThiD-type HMP-P kinase (HVO_2666) which is also
  conserved in the N-terminal domains (Ntd) of yeast THI20 and THI21. Thiamine-phosphate
  synthase homologs of the ThiE-type (HVO_2668) and ThiN-type (HVO_0662) are predicted
  to condense THZ-P with HMP-PP to form thiamine monophosphate (TMP). TMP is then
  phosphorylated to TPP by a proposed bacterial ThiL-type thiamine-monophosphate kinase
  (HVO_1861).
