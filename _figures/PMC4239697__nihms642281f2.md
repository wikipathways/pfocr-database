caption: 'Excessive glucose metabolism generates excess NADH and leads to overload
  of the electron transport chain causing oxidative stress, damage to Mt, activation
  of PARP. PARP activation by ROS acts in conjunction with the hexosamine and PKC
  pathway to induce inflammation and neuronal dysfunction. A combination of oxidative
  stress and hyperglycemia activate the detrimental pathways of AGE, polyol, hexosamine
  and PKC pathways which lead to redox imbalance, gene expression disturbances, and
  further oxidative stress. These pathways also induce inflammation and neuronal dysfunction.
