caption: Diagram of the mechanism by which APS induces apoptosis in cancer cells by
  interfering with the cell cycle, inhibiting signal transduction pathways, and inducing
  apoptosis. This involves the induction of S, G2/M, and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest via
  the Wnt-β-catenin pathway. It is involved in the inhibition of PI3K/Akt, ERK/MAPK,
  and NF-κB pathways in tumor therapy and induces apoptosis in cancer cells by inhibiting
  the expression of Bcl-2 proteins and miRNAs and upregulating the expression of p53
  proteins. Yellow represents the factor on the receptor, which is also the initiating
  factor of the pathway; Green represents factors on the conventional signaling pathway;
  Orange represents factors involved in both apoptosis and autophagy; Pink like Bax
  represents both apoptosis and cell cycle involvement; Earthy yellow represents cell
  cycle related factors; Blue represents cytokines involved in apoptosis alone. The
  red up arrow indicates that Astragalus polysaccharide leads to the increase of related
  factors, and the blue down arrow indicates that Astragalus polysaccharide leads
  to the decrease of related factors
