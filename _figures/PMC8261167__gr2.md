caption: Mechanisms by which lipid peroxidation and iron metabolism lead to ferroptosisFirst,
  AA/AdA is catalyzed by ACSL4, LPCAT3, and LOX to produce PE-AA-OOH/PE-AdA-OOH, inducing
  ferroptosis. Additionally, through a process mediated by the POR-CYP enzyme system,
  polyunsaturated (PUFA) phospholipids are converted to lipid peroxides to promote
  ferroptosis. The MVA pathway affects ferroptosis by regulating Sec-tRNA and CoQ10.
  Second, iron mediates ferroptosis. Transferrin (TF) binds to the transferrin receptor
  (TFR) and imports iron into the cell. Fe3+ is converted to Fe2+ by STEAP3 in endosomes,
  and then Fe2+ is released to the cytosol via DMT1. Free Fe2+ induces lipid ROS production
  by the Fenton reaction. Fe2+ is a cofactor of lipoxygenases (LOXs) that produces
  lipid ROS and induces redundant Fe2+ storage in ferritin. Ferroportin (Fpn) controls
  the intracellular iron concentration by transforming Fe2+ to extracellular iron.
  NCOA4 mediates the autophagic degradation of ferritin, increasing the Fe2+ content
  in the cellular iron pool. The p62/keap1/NRF2 pathway and glutaminolysis also participate
  in the regulation of ferroptosis. FSP1, GCH1, NRF2, and POR also control ferroptosis.
