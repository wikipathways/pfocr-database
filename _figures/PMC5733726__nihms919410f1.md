caption: The recognition of fungal molecules, such as β-glucans, α-mannans, and glycoplipids,
  by C-type lectin receptors (Dectin-1, Dectin-2, Dectin-3, and MINCLE) induces the
  assembly of a CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 complex, which mediates the activation of NF-κB
  and MAPK signaling, leading to the translocation of NF-κB and AP-1 into the nucleus.
  Following the recognition of C. albicans by Dectin-1, CARD9 also links RASGRF1 to
  H-RAS and initiates ERK signaling. This pathway ultimately results in the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and GM-CSF, by phagocytes and epithelial
  cells. Similarly, the binding of IL-17A and IL-17F to the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor
  facilitates the recruitment of ACT1 to the receptor, leading to the activation of
  NF-κB, MAPK, and C/EBP signaling, thereby inducing the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL1), matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP1),
  and antimicrobial peptides (e.g. β-defensin 3). In T cells, IL-6, IL-23, IL-27,
  and IFNs (IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ) bind to their receptors, leading to the recruitment
  of JAK family kinases to the receptor and the activation of downstream STAT1 and
  STAT3 signaling. STAT1 activation abolishes the expression of Th17 signature cytokines
  (e.g. IL-17A, IL-17F), whereas STAT3 activation induces the production of RORγT,
  which cooperates with STAT3 to promote Th17 cell differentiation. IKK, IκB kinase;
  NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; IFNR, IFN receptor; JAK, Janus kinase; TYK2, tyrosine
  kinase 2; MMP1, matrix metalloproteinase 1; BD-3, β-defensin 3. Red stars indicate
  the genetic causes of invasive fungal diseases and of “isolated’”chronic mucocutaneous
  candidiasis.
