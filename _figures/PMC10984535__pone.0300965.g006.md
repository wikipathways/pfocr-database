caption: (A) The schematic representation illustrating the physiology and key ceRNAs
  involved in impaired insulin secretion of HFD β-cell. mRNAs are colored in red,
  miRNAs are colored in green, and lncRNAs are colored in blue. The expression change
  in HFD mice were indicated with arrows. Created with BioRender.com. (B) The diagrammatic
  representation depicted an overview of LncRNA/miRNA-mRNA change toward increased
  β-cell mass of HFD mice. mRNAs are colored in red, miRNAs are colored in green,
  and lncRNA is colored in blue. The expression change in HFD mice were indicated
  with arrows. Created with BioRender.com
