caption: Model of the effects of insulin/TOR signaling on cardiac aging.The insulin/TOR
  signaling is necessary for normal cardiac senescence to occur. A critical target
  of that pathway is d4eBP whose negative regulation in cardiac tissue is required
  for normal cardiac senescence to occur (red heart). In our model cardiac aging can
  be delayed when d4eBP function is maintained, either by increasing dFOXO expression
  or by reducing insulin-TOR pathway activation (green heart).
