caption: A model for RmInt1 mobility. The major mobility pathway (a, thick arrow)
  may be linked to DNA replication involving invasion of the DNA strand that serves
  as a template for lagging strand synthesis (black strand), which is then used to
  prime reverse transcription of the inserted intron RNA. This priming process could
  involve either the RNA primer synthesized by the primase or partial polymerization
  of the Okazaki fragment by DNA polymerase III. A second possible minor retrohoming
  pathway (b, thin arrows) may occur independently of the strand into which the target
  is inserted. Alternative mechanisms for priming may include random non-specific
  opposite strand nicks, a nascent leading strand () or de novo initiation priming
  ().
papertitle: The RmInt1 group II intron has two different retrohoming pathways for
  mobility using predominantly the nascent lagging strand at DNA replication forks
  for priming.
