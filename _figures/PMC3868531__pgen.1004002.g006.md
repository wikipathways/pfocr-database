caption: (A) In the absence of unknown signals, CheA3 is deactivated; CheS3 autophosphorylates
  and transfers phosphates to its cognate response regulator CheY3; activated CheY3
  then interacts with downstream components to repress cyst formation. (B) In the
  presence of an unknown signal (denoted by a red star), CheA3 autophosphorylation
  is activated; His-phosphorylated CheA3 constantly transfers the phosphates to its
  C-terminal REC domain, which serves as a phosphate sink. CheA3∼P also phosphorylates
  the REC1 domain of CheS3, inhibiting CheS3 kinase activity and CheY3 remains unphosphorylated.
  Cyst formation is therefore derepressed without activated CheY3. The thickness of
  the arrows represents the level of phosphate flow.
