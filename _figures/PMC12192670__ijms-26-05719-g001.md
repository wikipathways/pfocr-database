caption: Schematic diagram of vitamin D metabolic activation and signaling pathways
  (by Figdraw). Vitamin D can be sourced from the endogenous synthesis of vitamin
  D3 (D3) in the skin via UVB irradiation, as well as from the dietary intake of vitamin
  D2 (D2) or D3. Upon entering the circulation, both D2 and D3 are transported by
  vitamin D binding protein (DBP) to the liver. There, enzymes such as CYP2R1 and
  CYP27A1 catalyze the formation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], which serves as
  the primary circulating form and an indicator of vitamin D status. Subsequently,
  in the kidneys, 25(OH)D is converted by CYP27B1 (1α-hydroxylase) into the active
  hormone 1,25(OH)2D. This renal conversion is stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH)
  and inhibited by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), as well as by 1,25(OH)2D itself
  through negative feedback mechanisms. Notably, various extrarenal tissues, including
  skin keratinocytes and macrophages, also express CYP27B1, facilitating the local
  synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D for autocrine and paracrine actions. CYP24A1 (24-hydroxylase)
  metabolizes both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D into inactive metabolites. The 1,25(OH)2D
  exerts its biological effects through both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms. In
  the non-genomic pathway, as a ligand, 1,25(OH)2D binds to the intracellular vitamin
  D receptor (VDR). The activated VDR forms a heterodimer with the Retinoid X Receptor
  (RXR), which subsequently binds to vitamin D response elements (VDREs) located in
  the promoter and enhancer regions of target genes. Through the recruitment of co-factors,
  including co-activators and co-repressors, the VDR/RXR complex modulates the transcription
  of target genes, thereby eliciting diverse biological effects pertinent to the pathophysiology
  of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), such as inducing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs),
  modulating immune responses, and influencing cell proliferation and differentiation.
  The non-genomic pathway involves the binding of 1,25(OH)2D to membrane-bound VDR
  (mVDR) or other membrane receptors (e.g., MARRS) on the cell surface, rapidly activating
  intracellular signaling cascades (e.g., Ca2+ influx, cAMP/PKA, PLC/PKC, MAPK/ERK,
  PI3K/Akt pathways), leading to rapid cellular responses
