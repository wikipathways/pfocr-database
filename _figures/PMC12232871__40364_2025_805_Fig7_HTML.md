caption: 'Some KRAS signaling pathways mediating PC mentioned in this review. KRAS
  is activated through the binding of ligands and receptors and transmits signals
  to multiple downstream signaling pathways. On the one hand, it affects endocytosis,
  exocytosis and the distribution of receptors on the cell membrane. On the other
  hand, it regulates the expression of various genes in the nucleus, playing a role
  in multiple physiological processes in tumor cells. “↑” indicates activation, stimulation
  or promotion, whereas “⊥” indicates inhibition, suppression or decrease. Abbreviations:
