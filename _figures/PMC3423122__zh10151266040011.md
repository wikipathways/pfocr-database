caption: Proposed model for hormonal control of lactose synthesis utilizing prolactin
  receptor (PRLR) signaling canonical pathway curated using the ingenuity pathway
  analysis list and the fluorescence intensity of selected transcripts and lactose
  concentration. Green nodes indicate downregulated genes, whereas red nodes indicate
  the upregulated ones, and nos. represent the fold changes at 72 compared with 6
  h. PRLR, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1, -2, -3, and -5),
  the protein-tyrosine kinase oncogene family (FYN), p300-CBP coactivator family (p300-CBP),
  and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). According to our model, activation of
  STAT5 via PRLR leads to induction of mRNA expression of UGP2 and SLC35A2 (dashed
  lines) and consequently increases lactose synthesis. SOCS, suppressor of cytokine
  signaling; SHP2, SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2; CEBP-β, CCAAT enhancer-binding
  protein-β; CBP, cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein; SP1, specificity
  protein 1.
