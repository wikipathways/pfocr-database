caption: Signaling control of mesenchymal and amoeboid cell phenotypes. The reciprocal
  inhibitory relationship between Rac and Rho signaling cascades establishes a bistable
  switch that controls the mesenchymal and amoeboid phenotypes. Mesenchymal morphology
  is controlled by a pathway that activates Rac1 via the adaptor protein NEDD9 and
  the Rac-specific GEF DOCK3. Rac1 activation results in actin polymerization mediated
  by the actin-nucleation protein WAVE2, which promotes cell elongation. WAVE2 somehow
  also suppresses actomyosin contractility and, consequently, amoeboid behavior. On
  the other hand, Rho/ROCK activation stimulates actomysoin contractility, thereby
  promoting the amoeboid phenotype, and inhibits Rac by activating the Rac-specific
  GAP, ARHGAP22. Presumably both Rac1 and Rho activation are ultimately controlled
  by integrin activity, but precisely how the extracellular environment favors either
  Rac or Rho signaling remains to be resolved. Solid arrows, direct connections; dashed
  arrows, indirect connections.

  description: Signaling control of mesenchymal and amoeboid cell phenotypes. The
    reciprocal inhibitory relationship between Rac and Rho signaling cascades establishes
    a bistable switch that controls the mesenchymal and amoeboid phenotypes. Mesenchymal
    morphology is controlled by a pathway that activates Rac1 via the adaptor protein
    NEDD9 and the Rac-specific GEF DOCK3. Rac1 activation results in actin polymerization
    mediated by the actin-nucleation protein WAVE2, which promotes cell elongation.
    WAVE2 somehow also suppresses actomyosin contractility and, consequently, amoeboid
    behavior. On the other hand, Rho/ROCK activation stimulates actomysoin contractility,
    thereby promoting the amoeboid phenotype, and inhibits Rac by activating the Rac-specific
