caption: Reactions and proteins of the mitochondrial FAS pathway. A,  individual reactions
  of the FAS II pathway. As discussed in text, it remains  to be experimentally demonstrated
  that generation of acyl-ACP exceeds a chain  length of C8in vivo and that longer
  fatty acids have a  role in mitochondrial physiology. B, protein components of the  mitochondrial
  FAS pathway and the corresponding genes in yeast and humans. All  proteins of the
  mitochondrial FAS pathway required to synthesize saturated  fatty acids have been
  identified and at least partially characterized in  bakers' yeast. The enzymes responsible
  for carboxylation of acetyl-CoA and the  3-ketoacyl-ACP reduction reaction in humans
  have not yet been determined.
