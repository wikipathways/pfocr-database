caption: Differential beneficial or adverse effects of insulin therapy on vascular
  endothelial cells depending on the level of metabolic control achieved. Insulin
  signaling in endothelial cells can be via the PI3K (causes vasodilation and is anti-thrombotic)
  and the MAPK pathway (causes vasoconstriction and is prothrombotic) such that there
  is a balance of beneficial and harmful effects. In response to an excess nutrient
  supply, as occurs in metabolically uncontrolled T2D, selective IR in the PI3K pathway
  will occur such that signaling through the MAPK pathway will be unopposed, increasing
  the risk of vascular events. Insulin treatment will either improve or worsen vascular
  health depending on whether it is effective or not at bringing blood nutrient levels
  under control. If high exogenous insulin therapy is successful at improving blood
  nutrient levels, then insulin signaling through the PI3K pathway will increase such
  that insulin therapy will be beneficial to blood vessel health. However, if high
  dose exogenous insulin therapy fails to control blood nutrients (i.e., in refractory
  patients), then the IR in the PI3K pathway will not be relieved and insulin signaling
  will predominate via the harmful MAPK pathway and increase the risk of vascular
  events.
