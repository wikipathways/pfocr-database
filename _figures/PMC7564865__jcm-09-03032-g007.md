caption: 'New diagnostic players and potential new therapies as primary-open-angle
  glaucoma theranostics. Excessive ROS generation/accumulation (superoxide anion (O2-),
  hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (OH)) selectively damage the lipids,
  proteins, and nucleic acids. MDA is an important lipid peroxidation byproduct. Elevated
  levels of pro-oxidants and decreased antioxidant activity spreads the oxidative
  injury. OS can induce activation of transcription factors, leading to gene expression
  involved in inflammation. In fact, OS stress activates the iNOS, a pivotal element
  of the transcription factor NF-kB pathway that controls the pro-inflammatory response
  by releasing among others the TNFα and IL-8, both significantly augmented in POAG.
  Serotonin and dopamine are really prone to autooxidation, and its toxic metabolites
  may contribute to increase neurodegeneration. Lower plasma levels of these neurotransmitters
  have been found in POAG. Glaucoma neurodegeneration is the result of the apoptotic
  death of the RGC. Lower levels of BDNF have also been identified in our POAG biosamples.
  ROS: reactive oxygen species; MDA: malondialdehyde; OS: oxidative stress; iNOS:
  inducible nitric oxide synthase; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B; TNFα: tumor necrosis
  factor alpha; IL-8: interleukin 8; RGC: retinal ganglion cells; BDNF: brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor.'
