caption: Schematic representation of isotope labeling of CK biosynthesis through the
  MEP pathway. Red arrows indicate the possible metabolism of [1-13C]DX (classical
  pathway). Blue arrows show possible conversions of [3,4-18O2]DX through HMBDP (iPRMP-independent
  pathway) into CKs. Dashed arrows denote multiple metabolic steps. 5-Ketoclomazone
  (KC) was included in all incubations to inhibit the endogenous MEP pathway. PYR,
  pyruvate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; P, monophospholic; PP, diphospholic acid.
  CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 are cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in Arabidopsis ().
