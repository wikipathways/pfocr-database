caption: Itaconate modifies the cysteine residues on many proteins related to photosynthesis,
  glycolysis, the TCA cycle, auxin synthesis, and more. Simultaneously, many transcript
  levels are also affected by unknown mechanisms involved in auxin transport, ABA,
  cytokinin, and Ca2+ pathways. Dashed arrow indicates uncertainty promotion effects;
  solid arrow indicates certainty promotion effects; dotted line flat head means uncertainty
  inhibition effects; solid line flat head means certainty inhibition effects

  of plant metabolism, development, and stress response
