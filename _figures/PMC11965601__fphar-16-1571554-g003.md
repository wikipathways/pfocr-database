caption: Mechanism of flavonoids in inhibiting retinal cell apoptosis. Rutin can enhance
  NRF2 expression by activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the
  production of ROS in retinal cells. Rutin can reduce the levels of inflammatory
  factors, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in tissues, thereby alleviating inflammatory
  stimulation on retinal cells. Rutin can promote the expression of BDNF and NGF,
  thereby exhibiting anti-apoptotic activity. Quercetin inhibits A2E formation, reduces
  4-HNE release, and thus prevents photooxidation processes in the retina. Quercetin
  can inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways and reduce the levels of TNF-α, ICAM-1,
  and MMP-9, thereby suppressing inflammatory responses. Kaempferol can significantly
  reduce the levels of ROS and MDA and increase the levels of GSH and MnSOD, thereby
  reducing cellular oxidative stress damage. Kaempferol can reduce the production
  of inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-1β and significantly lower the levels of Bcl-2,
  caspase-1, and caspase-3, thereby inhibiting retinal cell apoptosis By Figdraw
