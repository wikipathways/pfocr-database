caption: (A) Proposed mechanisms by which RF can induce cross-linking of collagen
  molecules in the presence of UVA. Pathway (a) is singlet oxygen-dependent, which
  produces imidazolone (compound 1). This short-lived intermediate can then react
  with an uncapped nucleophile (Nu). Pathway (b) invokes endogenous carbonyls (allysine)
  as a nucleophile in a subsidiary 1O2-dependent pathway. Pathway (c) suggests that
  a self-activation product of RF, 2,3-butanedione (compound 2) could be formed on
  excitation of the RF, yielding an additional 1O2 -dependent pathway that would react
  strongly with endogenous carbonyls. (B) Experimental gating of the putative reaction
  mechanisms. X represents the point along each of the three pathways at which the
  reactions would be blocked in those corneas treated with azide or with any of the
  carbonyl-capping protocols shown in A.
