caption: Positive and negative regulation of MAVS activity antiviral immunity. (A)
  Under physiological conditions, MAVS activity is inhibited to prevent aberrant activation
  of the immune response. (B) Early after viral infection, MAVS is activated by TRIM31-mediated
  K63-linked ubiquitination, and the inhibition of MAVS is relieved, thereby initiating
  the RLR signaling pathway. (C) At later stages of viral infection, MAVS is cleaved
  and degraded, which effectively arrests RLR-stimulated signaling.
