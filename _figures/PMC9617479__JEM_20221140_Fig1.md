caption: Key metabolic pathways and factors in energy generation and biosynthesis.
  Glucose metabolism starts with glycolysis. In the cytoplasm, glucose is converted
  into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) catalyzed by HK and finally into pyruvate. Glycolysis
  also provides intermediates for the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP), providing ribose
  as precursors for DNA and RNA synthesis, as well as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH) production. Pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria, where
  it is then converted into acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH).
  Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle in mitochondria and forms citrate by reacting with
  oxaloacetate (OAA). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine
  dinucleotide (FADH2) are generated and then used to produce ATP via electron transport
  chain (ETC) in the process of OXPHOS. The need for ATP to generate energy is fundamental
  in both quiescent and activated immune cells (). Increased aerobic glycolysis, also
  known as the Warburg effect, refers to the preferential use of glycolysis for ATP
  generation when sufficient oxygen is available, and is often associated with rapid
  cell proliferation (). Alteration of these pathways can influence the pro-inflammatory
  cytokines secreted by immune cells, especially macrophages, and trigger inflammatory
  responses that may be amplified by feedback loops and result in chronic disease
  (). Fatty acids can also fuel TCA cycle and OXPHOS to produce ATP. Fatty acids are
  converted into fatty acyl-CoA, catalyzed by fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and
  CPT I (), and then experience β-oxidation (also known as FAO), which converts fatty
  acyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA produced in the mitochondria must be transported
  within the cytosol for lipid synthesis or for other acetylation reactions through
  the CMS. Two key enzymes in the CMS are the ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), which cleaves
  citrate into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate in the cytosol, and the citrate synthase
  (CS), which catalyzes acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate into citrate in the mitochondrion.
  ACLY links glucose and/or glutamine metabolism with FAS, and it has been shown to
  be upregulated or activated in response to rapidly proliferating cancer cells ().
  FAS starts from the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by ACC1 (). 3-hydroxy-3-methyl
  glutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase is a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis which
  converts acetyl-CoA into HMG-CoA (). ACAT1 converts excess cellular cholesterol
  to cholesteryl esters. Statins, the inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, are widely
  used to treat atherosclerosis and have also been shown to reduce the severity of
  diseases in several preclinical models of auto-immunity and allo-immunity, principally
  altering helper T cell polarization and differentiation (; ). How such inhibitors
  that exert systemic influences affect metabolic changes of other immune cell subsets
  is currently less clear. Amino acids are the building blocks of immune cell life
  support, contributing to multiple intracellular metabolic pathways. Glutaminase
  (GLS) is a key enzyme in glutaminolysis, during which glutamine is first converted
  into glutamate, and then converted into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), an intermediate
  metabolite of the TCA cycle. This pathway enables replenishment of substrates for
  the TCA cycle, a process known as anaplerosis, which is essential to sustain energy
  production ().
