caption: The graphical conventions  are explained in the legend. The metabolic part
  includes the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways as well as a simplified description
  of the PTS system (adapted from ), via the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated
  form of its enzymes (represented by PTSp and PTS, respectively). The pentose-phosphate
  pathway (PPP) is not explicitly described but we take into account that a small
  pool of G6P escapes the upper part of glycolysis. Graphically, the PPP is represented
  as a ‘super-reaction’, in which elementary steps are lumped together. At the level
  of the global regulators the network includes the control of the DNA supercoiling
  level, the accumulation of the sigma factor RpoS and the CrpcAMP complex, and the
  regulatory role exerted by the fructose repressor FruR. A complete description of
  the model can be found in Sec. 1 of . Proteins are shown in red, and metabolites
  in blue.
