caption: α6 integrin is the upstream regulator of the IGF-1R signaling pathway that
  enables low levels of caspase-3 activation to signal lens epithelial cell differentiation
  initiation. Differentiation initiation of lens epithelial cells require low levels
  of caspase-3 activity that are induced downstream of the canonical mitochondrial
  death pathway, which acts as a molecular switch in inducing lens epithelial cell
  differentiation initiation. Previous studies have shown that an IGF-1R/NFκB (p65/p50
  complex)-mediated survival signal regulates the level of caspase-3 activity for
  its role in lens differentiation. Here we show that α6 integrin transactivates IGF-1R
  to regulate the level of caspase-3 activity through the induction of survival proteins
  in the Bcl-2 (Bcl-2 and Bcl XL) and IAP families (ch-IAP-1, X-IAP, and survivin).
  This pathway allows caspase-3 to play a non-apoptotic role in lens epithelial cell
  differentiation initiation. Our findings show a novel role for the α6 integrin/IGF-1R
  coordinated survival signal in lens differentiation by modulating the activation
  of caspase-3.
