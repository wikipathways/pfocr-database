caption: 'The HER family comprises four members, each of which is activated by one
  or more of the 13 identified members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family
  of ligands (shown above each receptor). Receptor–ligand interactions lead to autophosphorylation
  of the receptor intracellular domain and the recruitment of downstream signalling
  components. Effectors of EGFR signalling include the MEK/ERK (MAPK kinase/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) and JAK/STAT (Janus
  kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathways, whose combined
  activity regulates airway development and homeostasis. Healthy airways are lined
  by a tightly regulated epithelial barrier comprised of basal, mucosecretory and
  ciliated cell populations. In chronic respiratory disease, aberrant EGFR signalling
  can cause airway hyperproliferation (in red, left), increase mucus cell differentiation
  and mucus production (red, centre) and promote subepithelial fibrosis and excessive
  collagen deposition (red, right). TGF: transforming growth factor.'
