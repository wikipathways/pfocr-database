caption: 5-FU:A pairs that arise upon incorporation of FdUTP into the genome during
  DNA synthesis are recognized and processed by the BER pathway (left; see text and  for
  details). 5-FU:G pairs, however, are recognized by the MMR MutSa complex comprised
  of MSH2:MHS6 (right). Subsequently, the MutLα heterdimer made up of MLH1:PMS2 associates
  and either initiates a repair response or triggers apoptotic signaling through ATR/CHK1
  activation. A burning question that remains though is “how do 5-FU:G mispairs arise
  in chromosomal DNA?” See text for further details.
