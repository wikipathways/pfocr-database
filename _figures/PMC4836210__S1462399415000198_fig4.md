caption: Graphic representation of apoptosis signalling pathways. Apoptosis is initiated
  via two different routes including extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The
  extrinsic signals are initiated by cell death ligands (e.g. FasL, APO-2L, TRAIL,
  TNF) and activate FADD and subsequently cleave pro-caspase-8. Cleavage of pro-caspases-8
  and -10 initiate activation of caspases-8 and -10, which later can directly trigger
  effector caspases including caspases-3, -6 and -7. The intrinsic pathway is stimulated
  via DNA damage. Once DNA damage occurs, p53 is activated and induces apoptosis in
  a mitochondria-dependent manner. In this pathway, pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic
  proteins are up- and down-regulated, leading to release of cytochrome c. Released
  cytochrome c later can activate caspase 9 which in turn activates caspase-3. FasL,
  Fas (Apo-1/CD95) ligand; TNF, tumour necrosis factor receptor TRAIL, TNF, tumour
  necrosis factor receptor.
