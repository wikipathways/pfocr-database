caption: Schematic representation of the crosstalk between the mesenchymal capsule
  and underlying adrenal cortex that is required for SHH and Wnt activity. (Top) Adrenocortical
  cells in the glomerulosa produce SHH ligands, while capsular cells express the central
  components of the SHH signaling response, PTCH1 and SMO. In the absence of ligand,
  PTCH1 inhibits the activity of SMO. SHH ligand binding inactivates PTCH1 and subsequently
  derepresses SMO, which leads to intracellular signal transduction and the activation
  of GLI transcription factors. Additionally, PTCH1 and SMO are respectively dependent
  upon the transmembrane flux of sodium ions and cholesterol availability. (Bottom)
  Capsular-to-cortical signaling regulates Wnt pathway activation. RSPO3 produced
  by the capsule helps facilitate degradation of ZNRF3 in underlying adrenal cortex.
  ZNRF3 is a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts to promote the turnover of
  Wnt receptor complexes. Thus, RSPO3-mediated degradation of ZNRF3 potentiates Wnt
  pathway activation by increasing the availability of Wnt receptors on the cell surface.
