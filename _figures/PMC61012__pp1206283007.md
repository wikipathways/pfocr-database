caption: 'Proposed pathways of SA biosynthesis in tobacco  involving CoA thioesters
  or Glc esters. Radioisotope dilution  experiments indicate that free BA is not the
  major intermediate of SA  biosynthesis. The metabolic pathway to SA may therefore
  proceed via  conjugated forms of BA. In the branch involving Glc esters,  salicyloyl-Glc
  ester might represent a biosynthetic intermediate,  whereas SA glucoside would be
  a storage form. GTase:  glucosyltransferase (UDP-Glc:cinnamic acid  glucosyltransferase).'
