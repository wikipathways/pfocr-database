caption: Schematic representation of the effect of conventional treatment (Conv) and
  novel treatment (TKIs) on tumor behavior through the EGF-EGFR pathway. While the
  conventional treatment can only increase the death rate of PCs and TCs, TKIs can
  both decrease the proliferation rate of CSCs and PCs and increase the death rate
  of CSCs, PCs and TCs.
