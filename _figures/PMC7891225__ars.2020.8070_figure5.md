caption: Metabolic reprogramming directs polarization and inflammatory phenotype of
  microglia. Microglia can be activated toward two distinctive phenotypes M1 and M2.
  M1 microglia, induced by LPS or IFN-γ, are characterized by the production of inflammatory
  cytokines with neurotoxic properties, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α. M1 microglia
  favor glycolysis over mitochondrial OXPHOS, which elevates glucose utilization,
  PPP, and lactate production. M2 microglia produce anti-inflammatory interleukins
  and neurotrophic growth factors and their cellular metabolism shifts toward OXPHOS.
  AMPK inhibits the metabolic rewiring of microglia from M2 to M1 phenotype. Telmisartan,
  isovitexin, and metformin are therapeutic candidates that promote M1 to M2 polarization
  by activating the AMPK pathway. Resveratrol stimulates M2 activation via PGC-1α
  and alleviates inflammation. DCA triggers an M1 to M2 switch by activating PDH and
  OXPHOS in macrophages, the peripheral equivalent of microglia. Aldose reductase
  inhibitor SNK-860 suppresses LPS-induced glucose uptake in microglia/macrophages
  via mechanisms involving phenotypic shift from M1 to M2. DCA, dichloroacetate; IFN-γ,
  interferon gamma; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PGC-1α, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Color images are available online.
