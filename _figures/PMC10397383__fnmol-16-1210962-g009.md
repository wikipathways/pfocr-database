caption: Schematic representation of the effect of low potassium and staurosporine
  on the Txnip expression and the progression of death. Low potassium and staurosporine
  share a common pathway to induce apoptotic death. The pathway is characterized by
  an early ROS production, which induces Akt inactivation by oxidation. This condition
  induces a reduction in the phosphorylation of FOXO3, which leads to its translocation
  to the nucleus, where it interacts directly with the Txnip promoter, probably inducing
  the expression of Txnip. The TXNIP produced may play a key role in the progression
  of death by activating the signalosome, which induces the activation of the JNK/p38
  pathway and ultimately leads to cell death. Bio render program was used for the
  schema.
