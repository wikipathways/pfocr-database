caption: Model for Pho85 control of diverse cellular functions. The Pho85 catalytic
  subunit is targeted to different cellular functions via its association with different
  cyclins. Pcl1 and Pcl2 specify participation in cell cycle progression although
  the relevant substrates are not yet identified. Pho80 targets Pho4 phosphorylation
  and hence controls acid phosphatase (e.g., PHO5) expression. Pcl8 and Pcl10 specify
  control of glycogen metabolism via glycogen synthase phosphorylation (Gsy). However,
  we postulate the presence of another input, denoted “X,” into glycogen metabolism.
  X is required for glycogen synthesis and becomes limiting in snf1 mutants, presumably
  due to negative regulation by Pho85; however, this negative regulation is not mediated
  by Pcl8 or Pcl10. X may be a protein not known to be involved in this pathway, or
  it may be a known protein whose control by Pho85 and Snf1 has not yet been appreciated.
