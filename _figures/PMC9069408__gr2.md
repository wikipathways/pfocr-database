caption: Autophagy process and its regulation. Autophagy is generally divided into
  several steps, which include autophagy initiation, the formation of autophagosomes,
  the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and subsequent autophagic cargos degradation.
  MTORC1 and AMPK are upstream key kinases that control autophagy initiation. AMPK
  activation (in response to low energy status) and/or MTORC1 inhibition (in response
  to nutrient deficiency) promotes autophagy initiation by phosphorylation and activation
  of ULK1 complex, which further activates VPS34/PIK3C3 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PtdIns3K) complex to produce PI3P. PI3P then recruits its effector proteins such
  as WIPI2 to form pre-autophagosome structure. The subsequent phagophores elongation
  and expansion will form autophagosomes, which are controlled by ATG5–ATG12–ATG16L
  complex and ATG8/MAP1LC3B, two conserved ubiquitin-like conjugation systems. The
  fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, within which autophagic
  cargos are degraded by lysosome hydrolases. Upon dephosphorylation (e.g., upon starvation-induced
  MTORC1 inhibition), transcriptional factor EB (TFEB) is dissociated from 14-3-3
  protein and subsequently moves from the cytosol into the nucleus, where it upregulates
  the expression of multiple genes responsible for autophagy and lysosome biogenesis.
  Thus, TFEB not only promotes the formation of autophagosomes, but also enhances
  lysosome functions.
