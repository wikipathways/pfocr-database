caption: Schematic showing the roles of EGFR ligands and NRG1 in the regulation of
  timing of ovulation and oocyte maturation. LH induces the expression of EGF‐like
  factor, AREG, EREG, and BTC in granulosa cells. These factors act on EGFR expressed
  in both granulosa cells and cumulus cells to stimulate both the ERK1/2 pathway and
  PKC‐dependent signaling pathway. Both pathways activate gene expressions involved
  in the ovulation process in granulosa cells. However, the erratic activation of
  PKC accelerates oocyte meiotic progression due to the early closure of gap junctional
  communication between cumulus cells and oocyte. LH‐induced NRG1 that selectively
  acts on ErbB3/2 heterodimer decreases PKC activity to a physiological level. The
  controlling functions by NRG1 adjust the timing of oocyte maturation to the timing
  of ovulation
