caption: (a) Putative molecular pathway that links GSK3β activity with the resistance
  of pancreatic cancer cells to DNA damage induced by gemcitabine and ionizing radiation.
  The effects of GSK3β on E2F‐dependent gene transcription and on the expression of
  RR, TS and TK remain to be determined. CDK, cyclin‐dependent kinase; E2F, E2 factor;
  circled P, phoshorylation; Rb, retinoblastoma (tumor suupressor protein); RR, ribonucleotide
  reductase; TK, thymidine kinase; TS, thymidylate synthase. (b) Regulation of MGMT
  expression by GSK3β signaling in glioblastoma. GSK3β inhibition results in c‐Myc
  activation directly and via activation of β‐catenin‐mediated signaling, which consequently
  increases recruitment of DNMT3A by c‐Myc to the MGMT promoter, thus increasing de
  novo DNA methylation in the MGMT promoter. The methylated status of the MGMT promoter
  increases the sensitivity of glioblastoma to temozolomide. DNMT3A, DNA (cytosine‐5)‐methyltransferase
  3A; MGMT, O6‐methylguanine DNA methyltransferase.
