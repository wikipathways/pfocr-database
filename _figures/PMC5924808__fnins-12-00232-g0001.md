caption: Enzymatic pathways involved in the synthesis of the endogenous DMTs. Dietary
  tryptophan is the precursor for synthesis of serotonin (5-HT), melatonin, DMT, and
  5-HO-DMT (bufotenine). DMT is synthesized via decarboxylation of tryptophan by AADC
  to produce tryptamine which is then double-methylated utilizing AdoMet as a methyl
  donor (rightmost pathway). Tryptophan can also be converted to 5-HT via hydroxylation
  by tryptophan hydroxylase and decarboxylation by AADC (leftmost pathway). 5-HT can
  be converted to melatonin via addition of an acetyl group by N-acetyl transferase
  and methylation by 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase, or can alternatively be
  converted to bufotenine via methylation by INMT. Polymorphisms in these enzymes,
  the receptors their products bind to (e.g., 5-HT2A), and/or the metabolic enzymes
  that degrade their products (e.g., MAO) could affect the levels and effects of the
  endogenous DMTs through multiple permutations of SNPs as discussed throughout the
  manuscript.
