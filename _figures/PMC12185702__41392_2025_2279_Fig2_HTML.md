caption: Mapping of the multi-omics MAPK/OIS/SASP axis in pLGG cells. a Dotplot depicting
  the degree of correlation between factors identified in the MEFISTO model. b Bar
  graph depicting the total variance explained per omics layer (=view). c Depiction
  of the variance decomposition per factor. The graph shows how much variance is explained
  by which omics layer, for each factor. d Dissection of the factors identified as
  related to the waves 1, 3, and 4. e Protein–protein interaction network of the transcription
  factors identified by TFEA as being involved in the regulation of the genes from
  wave 3 and 4. Blue nodes are downregulated upon MAPKi, red nodes are upregulated
  upon MAPKi. f Senescence signaling pathway involving all molecules upregulated in
  OIS and under the control of the MAPK pathway in the senescent DKFZ-BT66. g Senescence-related
  signaling pathways involving all molecules downregulated in OIS and under the control
  of the MAPK pathway in the senescent DKFZ-BT66. Node’s shape depicts what omics
  layer/analysis the effector was identified from
