caption: 'Pathology of checkpoint-inhibitor-induced gastrointestinal toxicities. In
  healthy tissues (A) low levels of self- or non-self-antigen-TCR and CD28 co-stimulation
  signals that lead to increased glycolysis, T cell proliferation and survival are
  balanced by inhibitory signals through co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 that
  are constitutively expressed on patrolling Treg and induced on stimulated effector
  T cells. The inhibitory pathways that extend from these receptors include (a) competitive
  binding of CTLA-4 and CD28 for their shared ligands CD80 and CD86 – this is enhanced
  by CD86/80 transendocytosis in which CTLA-4 recruits its ligands into vesicles that
  deliver them to the lysosome for degradation; (b) dephosphorylation of activatory
  phosphate groups on signalling proteins assembled downstream of CD28 and antigen-TCR;
  (c) production of kinurenins that inhibit T cell proliferation from tryptophan by
  indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO), which is activated downstream of CD86/80 engagement
  of CTLA-4; and (d) induction of FoxP3 downstream of PD-1.In tumour (B), CTLA-4,
  PD-1 and their ligands are elevated. Inhibitory signals (a–d) are therefore increased
  relative to stimulatory signals through tumour neoantigen-TCR and CD28. This reduces
  the activation and expansion of effector T cells, enabling the tumour to grow.Anti-CTLA-4
  and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies (C) block inhibitory pathways (a–d) and Treg with
  constitutively high expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1 are destroyed by tissue macrophages
  through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-mediated phagocytosis.
  Altogether this results in T cell activation, proliferation and survival and differentiation
  into inflammatory effector classes that mediate destruction of the tumour but promote
  IrAEs in peripheral tissues, especially the colon, where self-antigens or microbial
  antigens might overlap with tumour neoantigens.Key: Green lines represent co-stimulation
  pathways and red lines co-inhibitory pathways. Arrowheads indicate induction and
  wedges inhibition of the response. Line thickness indicates the strength of the
  pathway.'
