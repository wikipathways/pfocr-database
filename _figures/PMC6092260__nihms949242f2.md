caption: A generic RTK is shown at center in an activated state. Signaling proteins
  that activate the MAPK pathways (e.g. GRB2-SOS) and PI3K pathway (e.g. p85α) can
  be recruited directly to the RTK or via signaling effectors that act as intermediates
  (e.g. FRS2/3, SHB/SHC, CRK/CRKL, SHP2, GRB7/10/14, IRS1/2, etc.). Many of these
  proteins can recruit one another and receptor activation thereby creates multimeric
  signaling complexes. The exact composition of effectors and activated pathways will
  depend on the RTK, ligand, and cell type involved. MAPK signaling regulates cytoplasmic
  targets such as MAPKAPs, cytoskeletal proteins, and apoptosis/survival proteins,
  and nuclear targets, mainly transcription factors. Some MAPKAPS will translocate
  to the nucleus and regulate TFs, potentiating the response. PI3K activity can activate
  Rho-family GTPases that regulate the cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton-regulated TFs
  (e.g. MKL1/2), and activate AKT signaling, which in turn regulates p53, FOXO, and
  mTORC1 activity. MAPK and PI3K can regulate each other and some of this crosstalk
  is shown (e.g. AKT inhibition of RAF). MAPK and PI3K can also be activated by other
  receptors or cellular stress and these sources are shown in a lighter tone. Last,
  RTKs can activate additional signaling pathways not covered in this review (PLCγ,
  PKC, Src Family Kinases, and STATs). While many of these pathways can interact with
  MAPK and PI3K pathways, they are omitted for clarity. Effectors and pathways more
  associated with MAPK signaling are shown in blue tones and green tones, while those
  more tightly associated with PI3K signaling are shown in red and orange themes,
  though the high degree of interconnectedness makes such distinctions somewhat contrived.
