caption: Overexpression of LEFTY by TGF-β1/Smad signaling and/or other factors either
  activates the p53/p21waf1pathway or induces p27kip1 expression, resulting in decreased
  cell proliferation. Its overexpression is also responsible for susceptibility to
  apoptosis due to the inhibition of the Smad2/XIAP axis and bcl2 expression, as well
  as the activation of the p53/bax pathway.
