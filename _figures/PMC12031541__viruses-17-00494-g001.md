caption: Interaction of autonomous parvoviruses with cellular DDR factors. This schematic
  illustrates how autonomous parvoviruses, such as MVM, HBoV, and CPV, manipulate
  host DDR pathways during infection. The left panel depicts the interaction of double-stranded
  viral genomes with the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) pathway. The right panel
  shows single-stranded viral genomes engaging the ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and
  Rad3-related) pathway. In the context of double-stranded DNA, the viral NS1 protein
  localizes to DNA damage, leading to the recruitment of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN)
  complex, and activates ATM kinase. This causes the phosphorylation of downstream
  effectors such as H2AX, CHK2, and BRCA1, promoting homologous recombination (HR).
  Sustained ATM activation can cause p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
  In the right panels, MVM-induced replication stress is caused by RPA exhaustion,
  which triggers the ATR pathway through the 9-1-1 complex, TOPBP1, and ATRIP, resulting
  in CHK1 phosphorylation. ATR signaling and RAD51 recruitment leading to homologous
  recombination are collectively inhibited by NS1. These interactions highlight how
  autonomous parvoviruses exploit double-stranded and single-stranded DDR pathways
  to enhance their replication, modulate host genome stability, and influence cell
  fate decisions
