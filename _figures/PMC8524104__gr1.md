caption: Lactate from aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis in cancer cells. Aerobic
  glycolysis in cancer cells is efficient because of the cytoplasmic regeneration
  of NAD+ from NADH by LDHA without participating in mitochondrial electron transport
  chain. Without this process, deficiency of NAD+ pool limits glycolysis of cancer
  cells, then decreasing the rate of glycolysis at the GAPDH-mediated step. The continuous
  activation of HIF-1α, c-Myc, and the mTOR pathway induces aberrant expression of
  multiple glycolytic enzymes, thus facilitating aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells.
