caption: (a) Glucose consumption and ethanol production rates were determined in cells
  grown overnight in either SCD or SCDCd media and resuspended in medium containing
  50 mM glucose at a final density of about 4*106 cells/mL. A glucose-to-ethanol ratio
  close to 2 moles of ethanol produced per moles of glucose consumed (the maximum
  theoretical value) indicates a mostly fermentative metabolism. Values are means ± SDs
  of three biological replicates. (b) Alterations in the proteomic and metabolomic
  profiles of cells grown under calcium shortage in 2% glucose medium (SCDCd). Changes
  in protein or mRNA levels were evaluated by 2D-page or qRT-PCR, respectively. Increase/decrease
  under calcium shortage are red/green colored; grey indicates no significant change.
  A colored box indicates transcriptional regulation under calcium shortage. Proteins
  whose expression changes under calcium shortage are colored. Blue lines indicate
  reactions specific for the gluconeogenic pathway. Orange lines indicate reactions
  specific for the glyoxylate cycle. (c) Cellular suspensions of CEN.PK2-1C cells
  were serially diluted and spotted on SC and SCCd media plates supplemented with
  the indicated carbon sources. (d) Cell viability under calcium shortage during exponential
  growth in liquid media on the indicated carbon source, as evaluated by cytofluorimetric
  analysis. Values are means ± SDs of two biological replicates (*p < 0.05, two-tailed
  t-test). (e,f) Log-phase W303-1A cells cultivated in SCD medium containing 2% (w/v)
  glucose were shifted in either SC or SCCd media supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) glucose
  (calorie restriction). Cell density (d) and cell viability (e) are shown. A representative
  experiment out of three performed is shown. (g) Cell viability under calcium shortage
  for mutants with reduced hexokinase, sugar uptake and pyruvate kinase activity,
  as evaluated by cytofluorimetric analysis. Values are means ± SDs of three biological
  replicates (*p < 0.05, two-tailed t-test).
