caption: Pathways modulating the yeast lifecycle. Illustration of the major pathways
  that modulate yeast aging. (1) Calorie restriction mitigates the detrimental changes
  associated with aging. CR-mediated RLS extension is driven by both NAD+ salvage
  genes like SIR2 as well as Sir2-independent mechanisms modulated by reduced TOR/Sch9
  and Ras-PKA signaling pathways, which play significant roles in growth metabolism
  and stress response. (2) A member of the sirtuins family, SIR2, an NAD+-dependent
  deacetylase-mediated aging pathway, represents the major player of yeast aging.
  SIR2 overexpression extends yeast RLS by suppressing ERCs formation through rDNA
  instability. SIR2 deletion leads to a shorter lifespan of daughter cells resulting
  from a defect in the asymmetric retention of oxidatively damaged proteins. (3) Nutrient
  response affects the aging pathways in many ways and regulates TOR signaling which
  is inhibited by nutrient stress. (4) Mitochondrial dysfunctions could initiate a
  retrograde response to regulate aging. Moreover, Yno1 modulates the accumulation
  of ROS. (5) The UPR mechanism helps in the removal of protein aggregates formed
  in response to the defective mechanism accompanying aging. HSPs and chaperone overexpression
  helps in the removal of damaged protein aggregates. (6) Sch9 can also be independently
  regulated by Snf1 through Sip2 acetylation, a component of the yeast Snf1 complex.
  These pathways are highly conserved and play similar roles in the modulation of
  the longevity of flies, worms, and mice.
