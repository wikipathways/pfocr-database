caption: 'p21-activated kinase 4 signaling pathways in gastric cancer. Schematic depicting
  some of the signaling cascades mediated by PAK4. PAK4 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling
  protein that is exported by the CRM-1-dependent pathway and imported into the nucleus
  in an importin α5-dependent manner. We have demonstrated that PAK4 contributes to
  gastric tumorigenesis and gastric cancer invasion and metastasis by phosphorylating
  Smad2, SCG10 or β-catenin or by interacting with DGCR6L. PAK4-mediated substrate
  phosphorylation is indicated by the letter P. PAK4 activation and inhibition of
  proteins are depicted using arrows and blocked lines, respectively. Speciﬁc details
  of the pathways are described in the text. CRM-1: Chromosome region maintenance-1;
  Imp-α5: Importin α5; SCG10: Superior cervical ganglia 10; DGCR6L: DiGeorge critical
  region 6 L; PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt: Protein kinase B or PKB; MEK:
  Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MAPKK; ERK: Extracellular-signal regulated
  protein kinase; MT: Microtubule; LIMK1: LIM domain kinase 1; MMP2: Matrix metallopeptidase
  2; CDDP: Cisplatin or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II).'
