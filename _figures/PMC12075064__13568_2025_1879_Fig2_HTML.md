caption: Pathway insertion strategy into a Δadh P. thermoglucosidasius strain. PlasmidpBUT17
  was first used for insertion of the operon containing the second half of the pathway,
  along with a tetR-Ptet inducible promoter system, replacing ldh. Plasmid pBUT28
  was used for insertion of the operon containing the first half, and plasmid pBUT22
  for insertion of the promoter on this operon. Further variations of pBUT22 were
  utilised where the Ptet promoter was replaced by constitutive promoters P10, P13
  and P15 stemming from the library described by Pogrebnyakov et al. (2017)
