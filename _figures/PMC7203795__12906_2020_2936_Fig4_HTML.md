caption: Proposed mechanisms of 20-hydroxyecdysone action in the liver. 20E increases
  hepatic function by decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis via both insulin-dependent
  downstream PI3K/Akt activation and insulin-independent pathways. 20E activates pAkt
  Ser473, which is the IRS substrate in the insulin signaling pathway. The activation
  of Akt caused the inhibition of FOXO1 to translocate into the nucleus through pFOXO1
  Ser256. FOXO1 is an important protein that activates PEPCK and G6Pase gene expression.
  The inhibition of FOXO1 causes a reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis. 20E also
  activates AMPKα via pAMPKα Thr172, which causes the suppression of CREB action that
  normally helps stabilize FOXO1 action inside the nucleus. 20E increases FGF21 expression,
  which then leads to the activation of pAMPKα Thr172
