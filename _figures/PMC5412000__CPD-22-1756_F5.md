caption: 'The influence of CB1 and CB2 activity on angiogenesis in cancer: After binding
  to a specific agonist, both CB1 and CB2 receptors are activated. This leads to direct
  and indirect changes that have crucial effects on angiogenesis in a cancerous environment.
  Inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway leads to lower HIF-1 and VEGF levels — two
  of the most known proangiogenic molecules. CB1 receptor activation leads to the
  direct inhibition of VEGF type 2 receptors, which are major angiogenesis inducers.
  When activated, CB1 and CB2 receptors strictly inhibit adenylyl cyclase (AC). PKAs,
  whose activity is strictly dependent on the cellular levels of cAMP, are inactivated
  and unable to phosphorylate CREB/ATF, decreasing nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Ras
  inactivation leads to inactivation of the whole pathway, including ERK and MAPK.
  Metalloproteinases production is stopped by the activation of both cannabinoid type
  1 and type 2 receptors. Thus, all of these events have a direct impact on angiogenesis
  as well as the cell cycle and proliferation.'
