caption: 'Cellular regulation of Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) and Prohibitin. A.
  Sphingosine (Sph) – S1P rheostat; showing the two enzymes that control it, sphingosine
  kinase and S1P phosphatase (SPPase); and regulation pathways of S1P and prohibitin
  in vertebrate cells. B. Model of S1P and prohibitin roles in cnidarian – algal symbiosis:
  (1) SPPase is down regulated by an unknown algal-induced mechanism, causing an increase
  of the levels of S1P over sphingosine; (2) the lower levels of sphingosine produce
  a suppression of sphingolipid-induced apoptosis; (3) higher levels of S1P enhance
  the activation of NF-κB, which inhibits apoptosis and increases cell survival; (4)
  S1P activates the ERK/MAPK pathway, which causes an expedition of G1/S cell cycle
  that results in cell proliferation; (5) Prohibitin is down-regulated by an unknown
  algal-induced mechanism, causing a suppression of apoptosis and a release of the
  blockage of E2F transcription factors. The latter enhances the expedition of G1/S
  cell cycle resulting in cell proliferation.'
