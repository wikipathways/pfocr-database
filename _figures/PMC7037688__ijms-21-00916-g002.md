caption: Regulation of NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2) transcription pathway and
  evaluation of potential biomarkers in Friedreich’s ataxia. (A) In normal conditions,
  NRF2 is located in the cytoplasm and complexed to a Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1 (KEAP1) homodimer, which in conjunction with Cullin3 (CUL3) determines the sequential
  addition of ubiquitin (Ub) monomers, leading to NRF2 polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated
  degradation. (B) Upon ROS and/or specific compounds mediated induction, conformational
  changes in KEAP1 structure disrupt KEAP1 interaction with the NRF2 Neh2 domain DLG
  motif, impairing NRF2 polyubiquitination. This allows newly synthesized NRF2 to
  escape the degradation process and to migrate into the nucleus. (C) In the nucleus,
  NRF2 induces the antioxidant responsive element (ARE)-dependent transcription of
  specific genes whose expression significantly ameliorates the cellular defects.
