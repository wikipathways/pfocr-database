caption: 'Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism by which biogenic SeNPs
  synthesized by Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 protect intestinal epithelial barrier
  function against oxidative damage. After SeNPs are transported into intestinal epithelial
  cells, Nrf2 is separated from the Keap1-Nrf2 complex and moved into the nucleus,
  where it binds to ARE. Transcriptional activation of antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and
  NQO-1 occurs with the activation of ARE, which function together to inhibit ROS
  production, weaken the depolarization of MMP, and enhance mitochondrial DNA copy
  number. In summary, SeNPs exhibit the protective effect on intestinal epithelial
  barrier function against oxidative damage by alleviating ROS-mediated mitochondrial
  dysfunction via Nrf2 signaling pathway under oxidative stress.Abbreviations: SeNPs,
  selenium nanoparticles; ARE, antioxidant response element; MMP, mitochondrial membrane
  potential.'
