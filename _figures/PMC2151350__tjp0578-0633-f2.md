caption: 'Model for renal pathology in Dent''s disease (due to a loss of ClC-5) The
  small peptide PTH (parathyroid hormone) and various forms of vitamin D (VitD; bound
  to their binding protein) pass the glomerular filter into the early proximal tubule
  (A). PTH and VitD-binding protein complexes are normally endocytosed by proximal
  tubular cells after binding to megalin. PTH is degraded in lysosomes, whereas 1,25-VitD
  reaches VitD receptors that regulate the transcription of nuclear target genes (not
  shown) and 25-VitD is metabolized by mitochondrial enzymes: 1α-hydroxylase activates
  the precursor to the active hormone 1,25(OH)2-vitaminD3 (1,25-VitD), whereas the
  24-hydroxylase inactivates VitD. The endocytotic uptake of PTH and VitD is severely
  impaired in the absence of ClC-5 (A and B; indicated by red minus symbols). As a
  consequence, their concentration increases in the lumen of later nephron segments
  compared to wild-type (A–C). This leads to an enhanced stimulation of apical PTH
  receptors (B; green plus symbols), causing the endocytosis and degradation of the
  sodium–phosphate cotransporter NaPi-2a (leading to phosphaturia) and increasing
  α-hydroxylase while decreasing 24-hydroxylase levels. Similar changes in hydroxylase
  levels also result from the impaired apical endocytosis of VitD, which acts on the
  transcription of the respective genes (not shown). The altered hydroxylase activities
  tend to produce more active hormone (1,25-VitD). Such an increase, however, is counteracted
  by a decrease in precursor availability due to its defective endocytotic uptake.
  Thus, depending on other factors, the amount of 1,25-VitD released into the blood
  may be decreased or increased (B). C, in contrast to proximal tubules, in which
  VitD is taken up primarily by apical endocytosis of its binding protein and is hence
  decreased in ClC-5 KO cells, it enters distal tubular cells mainly by diffusion
  of the free hormone. The increased luminal concentration of 1,25-VitD in distal
  segments of Clcn5− nephrons enhances the transcription of distal VitD target genes
  like that of the ion channel TRPV5 ().'
