caption: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and the canonical Smad pathway negatively
  regulate CD1d-mediated antigen presentation. The presented model implicates TGF-β
  and the canonical Smad signalling pathway in an inhibitory role in CD1d-mediated
  lipid antigen processing and presentation. Treatment with TGF-β causes a decrease
  in antigen presentation by CD1d. Additionally, knockdown of Smads 2, 3 and 4 in
  antigen-presenting cells (APC) increases natural killer T (NKT) cell activation,
  which suggests that they are negative regulators of CD1d-mediated antigen presentation.
  In contrast to the regulation of antigen presentation by CD1d, TGF-β enhances MHC
  class II-mediated antigen presentation via Smads 2, 3 and 4.
