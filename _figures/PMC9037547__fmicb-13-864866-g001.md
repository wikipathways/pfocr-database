caption: Metabolic pathway of aspartate as substrate. In this metabolic pathway, aspartate
  is the initial substrate, from which different biosynthesis reaction steps occur,
  yielding terminal products including asparagine, lysine, methionine, threonine,
  and isoleucine. According to the reversible reaction between aspartate and glutamate,
  the aspartate transaminase is also indicated in this pathway. The red arrow line
  represents a biosynthesis reaction marked with the corresponding catalytic enzyme,
  which has been proved to be associated with pathogenesis; black arrow line represents
  a biosynthesis reaction not studied or unrelated to pathogenesis.
