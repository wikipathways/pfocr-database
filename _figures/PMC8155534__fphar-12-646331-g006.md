caption: The putative mechanism of osthole’s ameliorative effects on renal fibrosis.
  In the progression of renal fibrosis, activated TGF-β signaling promotes the transcription
  of fibrogenic genes, like α-SMA, collagen I, fibronectin, IL-11, etc., by transcription
  factor Smad2/3 nuclear translocation. Meanwhile, the increased IL-11 may also enhance
  fibrosis proteins translation via activating IL-11/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. These
  processes eventually contribute to ECM deposition and fibrosis. In this study, we
  found that osthole has a previously unrecognized role in inhibiting IL-11/ERK1/2
  signaling pathway. On the one hand, osthole can inhibit the activation of TGF-β/Smad2/3
  signaling, then reducing the transcription of fibrogenic genes, and thereby ameliorating
  fibrosis. In this process, IL-11/ERK1/2 signaling pathway is also inhibited due
  to IL-11 is one of the target genes of TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling. On the other hand,
  osthole can directly inhibit IL-11/ERK1/2 signaling pathway independent of TGF-β1
  signaling, then decreasing the translation of fibrosis proteins, finally ameliorating
  fibrosis. In summary, our work demonstrated that the antifibrogenic effect of osthole
  is not only mediated by TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling, but also directly mediated by IL-11/ERK1/2
  signaling pathway independent of TGF-β1 signaling.
