caption: 'Schematic of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in Vertebrates. A) In the absence of
  Hh ligand, Patched (PTCH) prevents SMO localization to the primary cilium and GLI
  is suppressed by a protein complex composed of Costal2 (Cos2), Fused (Fu), Suppressor
  of Fused (SUFU) that promotes Protein Kinase A (PKA), Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3
  (GSK3) and Casein Kinase 1 (CK1)- mediated GLI phosphorylation and partial proteosomal
  processing of GLI into a repressor form that inhibits expression of Hh target genes.
  B) Hh ligand requires N-terminal palmitoylation mediated by Hh acyltransferase (HHAT)
  to be activated and released into the extracellular space by Dispatched (Disp).
  The Hh pathway is activated upon Hh ligand binding to PTCH and the co-receptors
  Growth Arrest Specific 1 (GAS1), CAM-related/down-regulated by oncogenes (CDO),
  brother of CDO (BOC) which relieves PTCH-mediated inhibition of SMO. Upon activation,
  SMO translocations to the primary cilia where it disrupts the repressor protein
  complex resulting in GLI translocation to the nucleus and activation of GLI-mediated
  transcription of gene targets that maintain a CSC phenotype. The Hh pathway can
  be therapeutically targeted by: 1) SMO inhibition (Vismodegib, BMS-833923, IPI-926,
  LDE225, PF-04449913, LY2940680, LEQ 506, TAK-441 and cyclopamine; 2) receptor-ligand
  disruption (5E1 anti-Hh ligand antibody and robotnikinin); 3) inhibition of ligand
  processing (HHAT inhibitor RU-SKI 43); or 4) inhibition of GLI activity (GANT58,
  GANT61 and HPI 1-4).'
