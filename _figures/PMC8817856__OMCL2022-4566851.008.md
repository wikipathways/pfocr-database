caption: Reactive oxygen species/G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2/hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1α/nucleotide-binding oligomerization segment-like receptor family 3- (ROS/GRK2/HIF-1α/NLRP3-)
  mediated pyroptosis in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) promotes synovitis under
  hypoxia and the regulation by monomeric derivatives of paeoniflorin (MDP). The level
  of ROS in FLS rises sharply under hypoxia. Then, excessive ROS promotes GRK2 expression
  and increases the levels of phosphorylated GRK2 S670, which then increases HIF-1α
  synthesis. This elevated HIF-1α is transferred to the nucleus to initiate the transcription
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The abnormally high level of NLRP3 inflammasome is activated
  under hypoxia to form activated cleaved-caspase-1, which, in turn, shears gasdermin
  D (GSDMD), interleukin- (IL-) 1β, and IL-18 to induce FLS pyroptosis. Monomeric
  derivative of paeoniflorin (MDP) inhibits the phosphorylation of GRK2 S670 to reduce
  FLS pyroptosis and relieve synovitis.
