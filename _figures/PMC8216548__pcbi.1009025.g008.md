caption: This diagram embeds a formal predictive coding error minimization scheme
  is embedded within an informal information-passing schematic to outline how estimated
  phase μt might be calculated and updated on each dt time step by a network of interacting
  brain regions. Estimated phase μt and phase uncertainty Vt are represented in medial
  premotor cortex (MPC). These estimates are used to calculate instantaneous subjective
  hazard rate Λ with the help of basal ganglia, which has selected an expectation
  template λ based on recent rhythmic context. The hazard rate is sent to parietal
  cortex, where it acts as a prediction of pulses rising from the event-based auditory
  pathway. An “event prediction error” signal comparing pulses to their prediction
  is sent back up to MPC, where it pushes μt+ in the direction that reduces prediction
  error—strongly toward local expectancy peaks when events occur, and weakly away
  from them when there are no events. (Note that phase updating at events is assumed
  to be rapid but not instantaneous as represented in the PIPPET filter.) The event
  prediction error is counterbalanced by a local “phase prediction error” signal generated
  through local interactions within MPC that pushes μt+ to continue its steady forward
  progress. Phase prediction error is weighted by dopaminergic signaling of state
  precision  through VTA.
