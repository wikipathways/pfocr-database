caption: Hypothesis of adolescent chronic alcohol consumption effect on SPIF gene
  down regulation in the dilated cardiomyopathy signaling pathway. Diagram was adapted
  from KEGG pathway (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) [] for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM),
  showing the β1AR-DHPR-Ca2+ branch of the DCM pathway. Adolescent chronic alcohol
  consumption is hypothesized to result in the down regulation of SPIF genes (marked
  with grey color and solid down arrows), including β1-adrenergic receptor (Adrb1),
  Gs protein (Gnas), adenylyl cyclase 1 (Adcy1), and dihydropyridine receptor/L-type
  calcium channel (Cacna1d). The coordinated down regulation of these SPIF genes leads
  to impaired intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis at the cellular level.
