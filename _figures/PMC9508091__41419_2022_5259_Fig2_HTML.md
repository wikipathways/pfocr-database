caption: Approximately 2–5% of cellular glucose enters the HBP to generate the end
  product UDP-GlcNAc. Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) is the
  rate-limiting enzyme for the HBP. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) adds UDP-GlcNAc to
  target protein serine and threonine residues, and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) removes O-GlcNAc
  from O-GlcNAcylated proteins. The balance between the enzyme activities of phosphofructokinase
  (PFK) and GFAT through regulating GFAT may be crucial to direct the pathways. G6P
