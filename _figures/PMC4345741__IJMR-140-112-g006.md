caption: 'Schematic model depicting the proposed signaling pathway in LH/hCG-induced
  LHR mRNA down regulation. Binding of ligand to LH receptor induces activation of
  ERK1/2 through the cAMP/PKA pathway. This leads to an increase in the expression
  of LRBP and thereby its LHR mRNA binding activity, which ultimately results in LHR
  mRNA degradation. (Source: Ref. , Reproduced with permission).'
