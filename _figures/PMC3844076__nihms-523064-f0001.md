caption: The ACP EncC is primed with benzoate by ligase EncN, followed by seven iterative
  type II polyketide synthase (EncAB)-catalyzed elongation steps by decarboxylative
  Claisen condensations with malonyl-CoA. The ketoreductase EncD likely forms the
  (R)-7-hydroxyl during elongation. The linear (R)-C7,O4-dihydrooctaketide (3) can
  cyclize to various wailupemycins (e.g., G and F), while in the presence of EncM
  is preferentially converted into desmethyl-5-deoxyenterocin (2). Final pathway steps
  leading to enterocin (1) are catalyzed by EncR and EncK. EncM catalysis (blue box)
  involves C4 dual oxidation (see ) and a Favorskii-type rearrangement, followed by
  aldol-condensations and heterocycle formation (dashed lines). Functional studies
  of EncM were conducted with the substrate analog 4.
