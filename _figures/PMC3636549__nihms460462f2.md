caption: (A) PATHWAY OFF. In absence of Hedgehog ligands (Hh), Patched (Ptc), a membrane-spanning
  receptor on the surface of Hh-responsive cells, keeps the co-receptor Smoothened
  (Smo) in its inactive form. “Free”-Ptc silences the Smo-dependent down-stream intracellular
  signaling, and Hh-regulated transcription factors undergo multiple phosphorylations,
  leading to their inactivation and proteasome degradation. Thus, nuclear translocation
  of Hh-regulated transcription factors is prevented, and the pathway is OFF. (B)
  PATHWAY ON. When the extracellular microenviroment becomes enriched with soluble
  HH ligands, they bind to the receptor PTC and this interaction SMO, which turns
  into its active form. Activation of Smo inhibits Hh transcription factor degradation,
  leading to an intracellular signaling cascade that ultimately drives the activation
  and nuclear translocation of Gli family zinc-finger transcription factors, which
  induce the expression of Hh target genes (e.g. Glis, Ptc, Smo and Hh interactive
  protein, Hhip).
