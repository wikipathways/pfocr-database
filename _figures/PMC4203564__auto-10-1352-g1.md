caption: Figure 1. Proposed model for the regulation of tumor growth by KIAA1524/CIP2A
  and autophagy. KIAA1524/CIP2A inhibits PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of MTORC1
  substrates RPS6KB1 and EIF4EBP1 thereby enhancing the MTORC1 signaling pathway.
  Together with previously reported effects of KIAA1524/CIP2A on stabilization of
  MYC, activation of E2F1 and AKT as well as inhibition of DAPK1, KIAA1524/CIP2A enhances
  tumor cell growth by stimulating protein synthesis, cell metabolism and proliferation
  as well as by inhibiting apoptosis. Conversely, MTORC1 inhibition leads to autophagic
  degradation of KIAA1524/CIP2A and reversal of its tumor-promoting activities.
