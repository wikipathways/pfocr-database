caption: Schematic of the proposed mechanisms by which norepinephrine (NE) and corticosterone/cortisol
  (CORT) regulate sterile inflammation. NE promotes inflammation by (i) facilitating
  glutamate (GLUT) release and production of ATP by astrocytes that then promote the
  oligomerization of the NLRP3 inflammasome; (ii) acting at β-ARs to induce IL-1β
  production through a cAMP/ERK-dependent pathway, which can lead to IL-1β acting
  in an autocrine fashion to induce NFκB signaling pathways and production of NLRP3,
  IL-6, TNF-α, and pro-IL-1β; and (iii) causing the release of HSP72, which acts at
  TLR 2/4 to stimulate NFκB signaling. CORT promotes inflammation by (i) causing the
  release of HMGB1, which activates TLR 2/4 signaling pathways and (ii) downregulating
  CD200R and CX3CR1, which are negative regulators of inflammatory responses in microglia.
  NE and CORT also have anti-inflammatory properties that include inhibiting NFκB
  signaling and upregulating IL-1RA, IL-1R2, IL-10, and IκBα. CORT also has the ability
  to suppress noradrenergic activity, thereby reducing NE release. ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; IL-1R2, IL-1 receptor type 2; IκBα, nuclear factor of κ
  light polypeptide gene enhancer in β-cells inhibitor α; CD200R, CD200 receptor;
  CX3CR1, CX3C receptor type 1.
