caption: Metabolic reprogramming drives HCC progression. In HCC, oncogenic factors
  stimulate the abnormal activation of various metabolic enzymes. Glucose is taken
  up by cancer cells and converted into pyruvate via glycolysis. While the majority
  of pyruvate is fermented to lactate, a smaller portion is transported into mitochondria
  and converted to acetyl-CoA, fueling the TCA cycle and OXPHOS. Cancer cells also
  show enhanced lipid uptake and synthesis, storing lipids or utilizing them for beta-oxidation
  in mitochondria. Amino acids, such as glutamine, replenish the TCA cycle through
  conversion to alpha-ketoglutarate. The PPP, a branch of glycolysis, produces ribulose-5-phosphate,
  NADPH, and precursors for the biosynthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and nucleotides,
  as well as reducing glutathione. Additionally, the serine synthesis pathway branches
  from glycolysis, with SHMT converting serine to glycine, generating THF and 5,10-methylene-THF
  for DNA and RNA synthesis, or conversion to the methyl-donor S-adenosylmethionine
