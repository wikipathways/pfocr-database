caption: Schematic diagram representing the role of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)
  in the pathophysiology of sepsis. LPS is released from Gram-negative bacteria which
  activate the TLR4 signaling pathway and the release of PepG from Gram-positive bacteria
  activate the TLR2 signaling pathway. BTK is involved in the activation of TLR4 and
  TLR2 by binding to MyD88 and TRIF thus activating their representative signaling
  cascades. The activation of the MyD88 signaling pathway, leads to the activation
  of NF-κB and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, BTK activates
  the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the ASC component of the inflammasome. Once
  active the NLRP3 inflammasome cleaves pro-IL-1β to active IL-1β. The production
  of chemokines from NF-κB activation results in the recruitment of neutrophils and
  macrophages. Excessive inflammation from the cytokine storm and innate immune cells
  results in multiple organ failure/injury. The use of BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib
  or acalabrutinib supress sepsis-induced inflammation and thus multiple-organ failure/injury.
