caption: The major AMBRA1-related signaling pathways in cancer. AMBRA1 ubiquitinates
  cyclin D to promote its proteasomal degradation. AMBRA1 inhibits the proliferation,
  invasion, and metastasis of melanoma by inhibiting the phosphoactivation of FAK1.
  AMBRA1 inhibits the activity of c-MYC by enhancing the activity of PP2A, thereby
  inhibiting the proliferation and tumorigenesis of cancer cells, whereas AMBRA1 also
  promotes the activity of c-MYC through SOCS3/STAT3 pathway, enhancing tumor stem
  potential, growth, and migration of MBGroup3 stem cells. AMBRA1 promotes chemoresistance
  and survival in breast cancer cells through the AKT-FOXO1-BIM axis. AMBRA1 inhibits
  tumorigenesis and carcinogenesis by ubiquitylating ALDH1B1, a cancer stem cell marker.
  AMBRA1 mediates non-proteolytic polyubiquitylation of SMAD4 to enhance its transcriptional
  functions. Consequently, AMBRA1 potentiated TGFβ signaling and critically promoted
  TGFβ-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion of breast
  cancer cells.
