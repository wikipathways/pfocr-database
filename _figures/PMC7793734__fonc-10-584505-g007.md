caption: Schematic model of the hypothesized mechanism by which endothelial cells
  promote docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer cells. Endothelial cells co-cultured
  with prostate cancer cells can secrete FGF2 into the culture media. FGF2 boosts
  the expression of the ETS related gene (ERG) gene in prostate cancer cells subsequently.
  ERG protein activates Akt/mTOR signaling pathway contributing to docetaxel resistance
  in prostate cancer cells ultimately.
