caption: Vascular smooth muscle cells mechanotransduction mechanisms in stretch-dependent
  interconnected signalling. Mechanical stretch signals are sensed by a variety of
  membrane mechanoreceptors, including transmembrane molecules such as integrin [,],
  notch [,], luminal structures such as ion channel (K+ and Ca2+) [] and tyrosine-protein
  kinase []. Transmembrane integrins bind to specific ECM protein and associate with
  a variety of FAK proteins to trigger downstream RhoA/ROCK signalling cascades [],
  and regulate the migration of SMC. Activated integrins also can lead to integrin-dependent
  activation of MAPKs via FAK through integrin-dependent Src-Ras-MEK1/2 activation
  []. In addition, integrin-dependent MAPKs (ERK1/2) activation mechanism involves
  Rho GTPase (RhoA, Rac1) [,,]. Ultimately, integrin-dependent MAPKs pathway mechanically
  leads to activation of transcription factor NF-κB and p53 [,,]. Thereby, integrin
  MAPK signalling pathway is a critical signal pathway for SMC proliferation and apoptosis
  under mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, tyrosine-protein kinase receptor and
  ion channel regulate the SMC proliferation and apoptosis through PI3K/Akt and ERK
  signal pathway [,,]. ECM, extracellular matrix; FA, focal adhesion; FAK, focal adhesion
  kinase; c-Src, tyrosine-protein kinase; MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases;
  ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Shc, SH2-combining adaptor protein;
  Ras, small GTPase; Rho, small GTPase related to Ras; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappaB;
  IκB, IkappaB; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B.
