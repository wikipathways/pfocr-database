caption: Diagnostic pathway for the diagnostics of pediatric neural autoantibody-associated
  psychiatric symptoms. Figure illustrates a simplified diagnostic pathway. Consider
  in particular subacute (aPS) or subchronic (cPS) psychiatric syndrome with the following
  suspected diagnosis subgroups [* = schizophrenia spectrum disorders, obsessive–compulsive
  disorder, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Gilles
  de la Tourette’s syndrome/tic disorder, catatonia] and one symptom from the following
  symptom cluster [# = psychosis, obsessive–compulsive, autistic or impulsive behavior,
  catatonia and sleep dysfunction]. Differential diagnoses encompassing other disease
  entities involving the immune system must be thoroughly considered (Fig. ). If prior
  diagnostics have already been done in cPS (cPS*), serum neural autoantibodies (sAb)
  or ≥ 2 clinical features (Table ) justify additional diagnostics (EEG, MRI/FDG-PET
  or CSF). Ab neural autoantibodies, a/c APS subacute or subchronic autoimmune psychiatric
  syndrome, a/c PS subacute or subchronic psychiatric syndrome, CSF cerebrospinal
