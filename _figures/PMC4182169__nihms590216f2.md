caption: Nutrient-induced cell proliferation in the crypt. Nutrients or other secondary
  factors to diet may directly affect cell proliferation through the canonical Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway in Lgr5 stem cells or progenitor cells. Glucose has been shown to increase
  β-catenin through cAMP/PKA pathway and increase β-catenin translocation to the nucleus
  in other stem cells (see section 3.2). Fatty acids have been shown to increase Wnt
  ligand availability (see section 3.2). Solid arrows indicate research has documented
  these signaling mechanism in other stem cell populations. Dashed arrows indicate
  that there is no current data to support a direct role of nutrients in cell proliferation
  in progenitor or Bmi1 cells.
