caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway created using ‘Alzheimer’
  as a key word. (A) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the Alzheimer’s
  disease pathway. (B) Molecular map describing responses triggered in the WNT signaling
  pathway. Activation is reflected as a straight arrow and inhibition is reflected
  as an inverse ‘T’ shape. Indirect activation is reflected as a dotted arrow and
  indirect inhibition is reflected as a dotted inverted ‘T’ shape. Dissociation is
  reflected as equal lines and a missing interaction is reflected as a half arrow.
  The round-edged rectangle represents a membrane receptor and diamond shapes represent
  phosphorylation. The ‘V’ shape represents similarities with factors in . The hexagon
  represents factors found in , the ellipse with white color represents factors found
  in  and the octagon represents factors found in both . Round-edged rectangles with
  white color indicate that both membrane receptor and be found in  and dotted round-edged
  rectangles indicated that both membrane receptor and be found in . White dotted
  round-edged rectangles indicate that both membrane receptor and is found in . Overlapping
  shapes represent a complex.
