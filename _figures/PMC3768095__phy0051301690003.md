caption: Glucose (C-source) availability regulates cell growth through multiple signaling
  pathwaysDuring glucose starvation, decreasing production of cellular energy leads
  to the activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK, yeast Snf1). Direct binding of
  AMP or ADP, but not of ATP, protects AMPK/Snf1 from dephosphorylation of the activation
  loop and therefore inactivation (dotted lines). Active AMPK/Snf1 regulates cellular
  metabolism and cell growth by direct phosphorylation of downstream targets required
  for cell growth as well as inhibition of glucose-activated pathways (TORC1, PKA).
  Mechanisms leading to the activation of growth-promoting pathway are less well understood
  but may likewise be linked to the energy status of the cells. In yeast, glucose
  sensing has been linked to the regulation of cytosolic pH, which is required to
  activate the Ras/PKA pathway and promote growth and might thus link energy metabolism
  and cellular signaling under nutrient-rich conditions.
