caption: Schematic view of the role of αvβ3-int in PD-L1 expression and antitumor
  immunity. αvβ3-int regulates PD-L1 expression through the IFNR pathway (A) and affects
  local and systemic antitumor immunity (B). The depletion of αvβ3-int or its block
  decreases the IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation. This regulation occurs through
  the β3 C tail. In β3-int–depleted cells, the reduced P-STAT1 negatively regulates
  IFN-stimulated gene transcription and results in low PD-L1 expression. αvβ3-int
  block negatively regulates PD-L1 also in murine tumor cells, in vitro and in vivo.
  Integrin inhibition in cancer cells results in local PD-L1 decrease and in the reduction
  in the primary tumor growth (C). Integrin inhibition in the primary tumor elicits
  an abscopal immunotherapeutic effect, resulting in the protection from a challenge
  tumor (C). Hallmarks of this acquired protection in the challenge tumor are highly
  reduced tumor growth, an increase in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration, and
  high intratumoral IFNγ. The acquired systemic anti-B16 cell immunity is indicated
  by splenocytes’ memory reactivity against B16 cells and by serum antibodies to B16
  cells.
