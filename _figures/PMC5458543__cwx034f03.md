caption: Fucose metabolism pathways and variation in types of fucosylated glycans.
  This figure illustrates the de novo fucose synthesis pathway, which converts GDP-mannose
  to GDP-fucose and the fucose salvage pathway, which converts free fucose taken up
  from outside the cell to GDP-fucose. GDP-fucose can then be taken up into the Golgi
  apparatus by the GDP-fucose transporter (SLC35C1) and possibly into the ER by an
  as yet unknown transporter. Proteins are then modified with GDP-fucose and other
  carbohydrates within the Golgi and ER and can then be secreted or expressed on the
  cell surface. This figure is available in black and white in print and in color
  at Glycobiology online.
