caption: Fructose metabolism in metabolic diseases. Fructose is metabolized in the
  liver to form 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG), which ultimately
  contribute to de novo lipogenesis (DNL), as does acetyl-coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA).
  Fructose intake also activates a key transcription factor, sterol regulatory element
  binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), which increases DNL levels. Dysregulation of lipid
  metabolism in hepatocytes because of high fructose intake ultimately causes metabolic
  dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). High intake of fructose also
  causes hyperinsulinemia and reduces insulin sensitivity. Indirectly, fructose stimulates
  the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from L-cells, leading to increased
  insulin secretion. Fructose activates sweet taste receptors (TRs) and the protein
  kinase B/forkhead box protein O1 (Akt/FoxO1) pathway on β-cells, stimulating insulin
  secretion. In addition, fructose causes liver and kidney cells to accumulate more
  uric acid (UA), leading to hyperuricemia. Fructose can also contribute to hypertension
  by affecting the renal renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAS), as well as insulin
  resistance caused by elevated UA
