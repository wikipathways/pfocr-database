caption: Combinatorial recombineering to optimize the biosynthesis pathway of interest.
  To construct a balanced synthetic pathway to the end product, different libraries
  of pathway functional genes and regulatory elements—including promoters, intergenic
  spacers, and ribosome-binding sites were designed and synthesized. Applying these
  recombineering tools, all of the above segments can be combinatorially optimized.
papertitle: Directed evolution combined with synthetic biology strategies expedite
  semi-rational engineering of genes and genomes.
