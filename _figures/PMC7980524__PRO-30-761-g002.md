caption: TLR signaling and domain organization of TLRs. (a) Schematic illustration
  of TLR signaling pathway and downstream effector molecules. The ligand of each TLR
  is shown on the side, respectively. Nucleic‐acids sensing TLRs are trafficked from
  the endoplasmic reticulum to the endolysosome by Unc93B1. TLR signaling is initiated
  by the ligand recognition, followed by the interaction with adaptor proteins, such
  as MyD88, MAL, TRIF, and TRAM. Finally, the downstream signaling induces the expression
  of inflammatory cytokines or type I interferons. (b) Schematic representation of
  full‐length TLR. Extracellular domain is composed of the N‐terminal (LRR‐NT), LRRs
  and the C‐terminal (LRR‐CT) regions, followed by a single transmembrane segment
  (TM) and an intracellular TIR domain (TIR). (c) Schematic representation of full‐length
  human TLR1‐10. The color scheme is the same as that used in (b). LRRs are numbered.
  TLR7‐9 contain a characteristic Z‐loop between LRR14 and LRR15. Residues are numbered
  based on reported structures and amino‐acid sequence alignment information, respectively.
  Residues of TLR10 are numbered based on UniProt
