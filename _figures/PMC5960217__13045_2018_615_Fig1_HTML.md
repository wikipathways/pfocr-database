caption: Schematic depiction of the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways. a When
  the canonical Wnt pathway is inactive, a cytosolic destruction complex consisting
  of Axin, APC, GSK3 and CK1 is formed. By phosphorylating β-catenin, this complex
  marks β-catenin for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome.
  The Wnt transcription factors TCF/LEF remain repressed by Groucho. b Upon binding
  of a canonical Wnt ligand to the Fzd receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptor, the canonical
  pathway becomes activated. Dvl is recruited to the receptor complex and subsequently
  recruits Axin-GSK3, thereby disrupting the destruction complex. Cytosolic levels
  of β-catenin stabilize and translocate to the nucleus. Here, β-catenin associates
  with the transcriptional machinery, transcriptional co-factors, and binds to TCF/LEF.
  This allows for active transcription of Wnt target genes. c, d Non-canonical Wnt
  ligands bind to Fzd and other transmembrane proteins such as Ryk and Ror, resulting
  in the recruitment of Dvl. c In the PCP pathway, this can result in activation of
  the small GTPases RhoA, Rac, and CDC42, which influence cytoskeleton function. RhoA
  and Rac can also activate JNK, and subsequent AP-1 and NFAT-mediated transcriptional
  programs. d In the Ca2+pathway, Dvl activates heterotrimeric G proteins, resulting
  in a cytosolic calcium flux. This activates calcium-dependent signaling molecules
  including PKC, CamKII, and CaN. Both PKC and CamKII can also promote NFAT transcriptional
  activity
