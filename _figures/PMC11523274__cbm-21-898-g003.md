caption: The genomic and non-genomic pathways of estrogen signaling. The genomic pathway
  involves estrogen (E2) entering the plasma membrane and binding to nuclear ERs (nERs),
  which results in receptor dimerization and translocation into the nucleus to induce
  transcriptional changes in estrogen-responsive genes with or without the presence
  of EREs. In the ERE-dependent signaling route, E2-ER interacts with EREs on DNA
  to regulate gene expression. In the ERE-independent signaling pathway, the modulation
  of responsive gene expression occurs through co-regulatory proteins and E2-ER modulates
  gene expression through interaction with transcription factors that are bound to
  their cognate-responsive elements on DNA. The non-genomic pathway refers to estrogen
  binding to membrane ERs (mERs), including G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER),
  which induces and activates cytoplasmic events, such as intracellular signal transduction
  cascades and transcription factors, leading to rapid cellular responses. ER, estrogen
  receptor; ERE, estrogen response element
