caption: In normoglycemia, PP2A keeps the level of CREB below the physiological threshold
  and transient activation of CREB in response to glucose and incretin is not sufficient
  to induce persistent expression of ICER. In chronic hyperglycemia, CREB is constantly
  activated due to the decreased PP2A level. Upon glucose stimulation or hormonal
  cues, CREB is further activated for an extended period of time, leading to prolonged
  ICER induction. Consequently, excessively produced ICER proteins repress the NeuroD
  expression and the NeuroD's target genes including insulin, SUR1, and components
  of the exocytotic machinery. The hyperglycemic condition is progressively aggravated
  through this vicious negative cycle of insulin depletion, and ultimately progressed
  to β-cell failure. (a) Inada et al., 1999 ; Abderrahmani et al., 2006 ; (b) Naya
