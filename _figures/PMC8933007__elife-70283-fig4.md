caption: (A) Gene expression fold changes for the NNMT (top) in the hTERT, replicative
  senescence (RS), radiation induced senescence (RIS), and cell density (CD) time
  courses (three replicate average, each point a replicate). Heatmaps of metabolite
  and protein changes during replicative senescence from B (bottom-replicate average).
  (B) Metabolic diagram of the methionine and NAD salvage pathways. Metabolites are
  blue, proteins are green. Shading indicates inferred pathway direction during replicative
  senescence based on metabolite/protein changes in A. (C) Heatmaps of metabolite
  (four replicate average) and protein (three replicate average) changes with replicative
  senescence from B. Metabolomics data was batch corrected against hTERT samples and
  expressed as log2 fold change vs. PDL 25 as reference (not shown). Proteomics data
  expressed as log2 fold change vs. PDL 20 as reference (not shown). Significant changes
  (FDR adjusted p < 0.05 metabolomics, FDR adjusted p-value < 0.01 proteomics) during
  replicative senescence are denoted with asterisks. (D) Potential model for NNMT
  and metabolic regulation of chromatin state during replicative senescence.
