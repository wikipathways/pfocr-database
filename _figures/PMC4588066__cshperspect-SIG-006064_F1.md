caption: Regulation of oocyte maturation. Immature oocytes are held in G2 arrest through
  the activity of PKA, which is stimulated by GPR3-dependent production of cAMP. Progesterone
  signaling leads to a loss of PKA activity, leading to disinhibition of the CDK1
  activator Cdc25 and stimulation of the CDK1 inhibitor Wee1. Additionally, progesterone
  stimulates translation of both Mos and cyclin B proteins (the former also stimulating
  translation of the latter) through induction of Eg2, which phosphorylates and activates
  CPEB to unmask the messages and promote their polyadenylation. In parallel, progesterone
  stimulates translation of RINGO, which can activate CDK1 independently of cyclin
  and make it phosphorylate and inhibit the CDK1 inhibitor Myt1. All of these events
  result in activation of MPF, which drives the oocyte into MI. Maturation continues
  via the Mos-MEK-ERK pathway as shown. Blockade of APC (anaphase-promoting complex)
  activity by CSF and Emi2 holds the mature oocyte at a second arrest until the time
  of fertilization.
