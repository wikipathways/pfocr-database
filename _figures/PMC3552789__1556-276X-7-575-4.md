caption: Scheme of the molecular mechanism of bacteria/nanorough substrate interaction.
  (A) E. coli growing on flat gold substrates present the typical type-1 fimbriae;
  the two-component system Cpx pathway is inactive, thus CpxA posses a phosphatase
  activity which inhibits the transcription factor CpxR, resulting in a repression
  of degP transcription. At the same time, the promoter of the fimbrial operon is
  in the ON orientation. (B) The nanorough gold substrates lead to a general stress
  condition in E. coli, inducing a high presence of unfolded/misfolded proteins in
  the periplasmic space. Such misfolded proteins titrate CpxP from CpxA, whose activity
  shifts from phosphatase to autokinase and kinase, thus activating CpxR. This protein
  activates the transcription of degP which degrades unfolded proteins of the periplasmic
  space. Moreover, FimE switches the operon of the fimbrial promoter in the OFF orientation.
