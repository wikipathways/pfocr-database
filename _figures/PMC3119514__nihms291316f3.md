caption: IL-1 and TLR activation pathways. A Ligand binding to IL-1R1 leads to coupling
  of IL-1RAPcP1, IL-1RAPcP2, and MYD88 with receptors. MYD88 recruits IRAK-1 and the
  adaptor proteins Tollip, TRAF6, and IRAK-4 to the receptor complex. After IRAK-1
  phosphorylation by IRAK-4, IRAK-1, and TRAF6 dissociate from the receptor complex
  and associate with TAB 1, TAB 2, TAB 3, and TAK1. Pellino proteins phosphorylate
  IRAK-1, initiating IRAK-1 and Pellino poly-ubiquitination and degradation, freeing
  the TRAF6/TAB 1/TAB 2/TAB 3/TAK1 complex. TAB 2 phosphorylates TAK1, which phosphorylates
  and activates IKKβ. B Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical components of the
  innate immune response as they are conserved pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
  that detect conserved pathogen-associated microbial patterns (PAMPs) present on
  many antigens. There are over ten TLRs that have been identified, all of which recognize
  a variety of different PAMPs and lead to NF-#x003BA;B activation. TLRs and IL-1R1
  have a shared Toll-IL-1R (TIR) domain that mediates interactions with downstream
  molecules. Due to this shared TIR domain, TLRs initiate a similar signaling cascade
  as IL-1 involving MYD88, IRAK-1, IRAK-4, TRAF6, TAB 2, and TAK1, but also involve
  other cascades that include TIRAP, TRIF, TANK, and TBK1
