caption: Schematic of the stress responses of cells to untreated Gaucher disease.
  The specific cellular response varies with cell type, but innate immune cells (macrophages
  of various ontogenies, microglia, and dendritic cells) evoke many of the indicated
  pathways leading to multiple different types of programmed cell death. The major
  features result from lysosomal stresses due to excess GCs ad GSs leading to disruption
  of the autophagy/lysosomal system from destabilization of the lysosomal and autophagosome
  membranes. Such disruption leads to dissociation of mTORC1 from the lysosomal membrane
  making it inactivate for the phosphorylation of TFEB/TFE3. These factors then enter
  the nucleus and activate the transcription of genes involved in autophagic, lysosomal
  biogenesis and enzymes, peroxisomal biogenesis and enzymes while the pathways for
  lipogenesis and adipogenesis are blocked by in inactivation of Lipin 1. Components
  of the mitochondria are also disrupted with resultant disruption of the oxidative
  pathways (not shown). The overall effects lead directly or indirectly to proinflammatory
  activation through cell dependent cell death pathways. The damage to various organellar
  membranes is shown as dashed circles and the resultant effects on substrates and
  precursors are shown in dashed lines. The diminished or altered function of the
  various organellar pathways indicate the degrees of metabolic disturbance. Dissection
  of these cellular-specific pathway abnormalities should provide for identification
  of potential modifiers of GD expression within and among phenotypes.
