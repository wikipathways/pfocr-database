caption: LPS-producing bacteria interact with TLRs through the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  For instance, TLR4 drives the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in enterocytes
  corresponding to LPS-producing bacteria through the TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB signaling pathway.
  Then, TRAF6 is activated. After that, the compound of TAB1/2 and TAK1 is activated,
  and subsequently promotes the IKK complex to phosphorylate the IκB molecule, which
  ultimately undergoes ubiquitination and degradation. Then, NF-κB, including p50
  and p65, will translocate into the nucleus to regulate the expression of genes encoding
  IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLRs, Toll-like receptors; MyD88,
  myeloid differentiation factor 88; IRAK, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase; TRAF6,
  TNF receptor-associated factor 6; TAK1, TGF-β-activated kinase 1; IKK, inhibitor
  of κB kinase; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; I-κB, inhibitor of κB; P, phosphorylation;
  P50/P60, subunits of NF-κB; Ub, ubiquitination; ↑, increase.
