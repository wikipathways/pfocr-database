caption: '(A) Angiogenic ECs rely on glycolysis, instead of oxidative metabolism,
  for ATP production and upregulate PFKFB3 to increase the conversion of glucose into
  lactate through glycolysis. Lactate is secreted and taken up through lactate transporters.
  High Lactate influx through MCT1 results in increased intracellular lactate levels
  that compete with α-ketoglutarate for PHD-2 binding, leading to HIF-1α stabilization
  and upregulation of pro-angiogenic genes. VEGFR-2 glycosylation is required for
  galectin-1-induced VEGF-independent signaling. (B) PAH ECs are metabolically characterized
  by high aerobic glycolysis and low oxidative metabolism. NO production through eNOS
  is impaired due to upregulation of arginase II and increased oxidative stress due
  to limited availability of MnSOD. In addition, several enzymes in the pentose phosphate
  pathway and polyamine biosynthesis pathway are differentially expressed in PAH ECs,
  but the importance of these findings remains to be determined (B). Green font /
  bold line: upregulated, red font / broken line: downregulated. For clarity, not
  all metabolites and enzymes of the depicted pathways are shown. Abbreviations: as
  in Fig . FGF: fibroblast growth factor; HIF: hypoxia-inducible factor; IL: interleukin;
  PHD: prolyl hydroxylase domain; R5P: ribose-5-phosphate; RPE: ribulose-5-phosphate
  3-epimerase; RPIA: ribose-5-phosphate isomerase; Ru5P: ribulose-5-phosphate; SRM:
