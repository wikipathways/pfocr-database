caption: Effects of hypoxia on osteoclasts. Under hypoxic conditions osteoclastogenesis
  is increased. Hypoxia-inducible factors 1α and 2α (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) activate osteoclast
  fusion. HIF-2α is also involved in the expression of TRAF6, increasing NF-κB pathway
  activation and osteoclast maturation. NF-κB is also activated because hypoxia decreases
  osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression. Hypoxia is associated with increased osteoclast
  resorptive capacity. Pro-resorptive gene expression is activated by HIF-1α and HIF-2α
  and by the inhibition of the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD). HIF-1α is also involved
  in the stimulation of glycolytic activity. In the osteoclast response to hypoxia,
  osteoblast–osteoclast crosstalk is crucial. Resorptive osteoclast activity is stimulated
  by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP); VEGF
  and ATP are released by osteoblasts in a hypoxic environment.
