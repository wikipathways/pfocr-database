caption: Notch-dependent signaling events and signaling crosstalk during the differentiation
  of MSCs towards osteocytes. Pluripotent MSCs differentiate towards osteoblast progenitors
  under the influence of PTH, BMP-2 and Wnt-Signaling. The Notch-regulated gene Hey1
  inhibits differentiation towards osteoblast progenitors. Notch signaling is enhanced
  by stimulation of the Hif-1α pathway. Notch activation functions inhibitory on Runx2
  and thus on further differentiation of osteoblast progenitors towards osteoblast.
  The osteoblast entombs itself by synthesizing minerals osteoid. The deposition of
  minerals and collagens is regulated by Notch []. Once the osteoid is mineralized,
  the osteoblasts are terminally differentiated and become osteocytes. Notch has an
  indirect influence on osteoclasts via modulation of the RANKL/OPG axis. Notch inhibits
  OPG, which is an inhibitor of Rank, resulting in an indirect activation of osteoclasts
  by Notch signaling. Arrows indicate an activation/ induction, and lines with a horizontal
  bar indicate inactivation/repression.
