caption: Lactate shutle ststem: In aerobic glycolytic pathway, glucose from the bloodstream
  enters the cell cytosol via the glucose transporter (GLUT) (1). In the cytosol glucose
  is broken down into pyruvate via the glycolytic process (2). While pyruvate enters
  the mitochondrion, allowing respiration and energy production (3) to continue in
  the TCA cycle, the cytosolic lactate, produced by the cytosolic LDH (4), is exported
  to the extracellular compartment via monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) (5), where
  it is redistributed to other functional sites. The cytosolic lactate also enters
  the mitochondria (6) and is converted to pyruvate in the presence of mitochondrial
  mLDH (7), forming the basis of the intracellular lactate shuttle system [].
