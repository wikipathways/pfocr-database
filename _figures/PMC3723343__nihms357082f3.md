caption: (A) The cell surface Cripto/GRP78 complex interaction required for Cripto
  regulation of the Smad2/3 pathway both as a Nodal co-receptor and antagonist of
  activin and TGF-β signaling. Soluble Cripto also binds cell surface GRP78 to cause
  activation of PI3K and MAPK signaling via activation of Src. The effects of Cripto/GRP78
  signaling on Src/MAPK/PI3K and Smad2/3 pathways are likely to function synergistically
  to promote stemness, plasticity and tumorigenesis. (B) The N-20 antibody blocks
  Cripto binding to cell surface GRP78 and inhibits Cripto-dependent signaling via
  MAPK, PI3K and Smad2/3 pathways. By blocking Cripto, this GRP78 antibody blocks
  Src/MAPK/PI3K pathway activation and enhances activin and TGF-β signaling thereby
  promoting cytostasis and tumor suppression.
