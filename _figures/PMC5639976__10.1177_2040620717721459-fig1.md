caption: Agents with potential synergistic activity with midostaurin in AML. Agents
  with additive and/or synergistic potential when combined with midostaurin are illustrated
  alongside their respective target pathways. (a) STAT5a, Ras/MEK, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  are established FLT3-dependent signaling pathways, and may be inhibited further
  by the agents listed. (b) CDDO-Me targets multiple pathways, including NFκB which
  is not an established FLT3-dependent signaling pathway. (c) Activation of the JAK/STAT
  pathway by cytokines released from bone marrow stromal cells is hypothesized to
  overcome FLT3 inhibition within the bone marrow environment. Individual agents are
  discussed in detail in the section Agents exhibiting additive or synergistic effects
  with midostaurin in FLT3-mut AML.FLT3-mut (FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD) are constitutively
  active; FLT3-WT requires FL stimulation.FL, FLT3 ligand; BMS, bone marrow stromal.
