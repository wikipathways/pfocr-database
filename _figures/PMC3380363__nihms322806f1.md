caption: Oncogenic signaling pathways regulated by NO and PP2A. NO activates numerous
  signaling pathways associated with cancer cell proliferation, survival, chemoresistance
  and migration. Some of the molecular and pathway targets of NO signaling include
  sGC, HIF-1α, Src, PI3K/Akt, EGFR, Ras, c-Myc and ERK-1/2. Furthermore, NO activates
  oncogenic pathways by redundant mechanisms; for example, ERK-1/2 is activated from
  either Ras signaling or sGC activation and PI3K/Akt signaling is activated by either
  EGFR or Src kinases. These redundant mechanisms indicate that single agent therapies
  could fail to limit oncogenic NO signaling. The tumor suppressor PP2A is the endogenous
  negative regulator of many NO-activated signaling pathways. We propose that pharmacological
  activation of PP2A could represent an effective strategy to limit the myriad of
  pro-tumor NO effects.
