caption: Cytoscape pathway visualizations of lipid metabolites modulated by navy bean,
  rice bran, or navy bean + rice bran consumption. Lipid metabolites modulated by
  navy bean, rice bran, or navy bean + rice bran consumption for 4 weeks compared
  to control is shown in panels A,C,E respectively. Lipid metabolites modulated by
  navy bean, rice bran, or navy bean + rice bran consumption for 4 weeks compared
  to respective baseline is shown in panels B,D,F respectively. Nodes in red and blue
  represent significantly increased and decreased metabolites, respectively, compared
  to control or baseline (p ≤ 0.05). For each metabolite, the node diameter is proportional
  to the magnitude of the fold difference/change. Numerical values within nodes indicate
  the calculated pathway enrichment score. Pathways with enrichment scores greater
  than 1 were defined as being important contributors to overall dietary group differences
  (visualized in red/yellow).
