caption: Various genes expressed by Tregs and their surface molecules. In Tregs, FoxP3
  is the key transcription factor that maintains their regulatory function. The expression
  of FoxP3 is closely related to the function of Tregs. The recognition of antigens
  by the T-cell receptor (TCR) triggers signal transduction, activating NFAT, which
  works in conjunction with AP-1 or NF-κB to promote the expression of FoxP3. Concurrently,
  co-stimulatory molecules like CD28 activate the downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway,
  thereby affecting the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for the stable expression of
  FoxP3 and the function of Tregs. Additionally, the cytokine signal IL-2 promotes
  the expression of FoxP3 through the JAK/STAT pathway, particularly STAT5.Other surface
  molecules also play an important role in the development and function of Tregs
