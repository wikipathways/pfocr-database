caption: A possible route through which the medial mammillary bodies (MBs) and their
  projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei might influence contextual representations
  in the hippocampal formation. a, As well as head direction cells, anteroventral
  (AV) and anteromedial (AM) thalamic nuclei contain a high proportion of theta entrained
  neurons, a proportion of which encode direction through through the frequency of
  theta bursting (). The medial MBs also house a high proportion of theta entrained
  neurons as well as those that are correlated with running speed, and angular head
  velocity. If it is the case that AM/AV activity is driven by the MBs, ascending
  MB activity may influence parahippocampal periodic tuning through modulation of
  thalamic directionally/velocity controlled oscillators; activity which is critical
  to oscillatory interference models of entorhinal (EC) grid cell periodicity (b;
  see ); Direct (AM-EC) and indirect (AV-subiculum-EC) thalamic influence over the
  EC may in turn modulate theta frequency/cycle asymmetry () and the related fast
  gamma low gamma ratio (which are dominant in the descending and ascending phase
  of the theta cycle, respectively) in CA1. The fast gamma (EC-CA1 derived), slow
  gamma (CA3-CA1 derived) ratio is thought to reflect a variable focus on prospective
  (future action) planning (fast gamma dominant) vs. current position encoding (slow
  gamma dominant).
