caption: LZTR1 regulates RAS/MAPK signaling. (A) LZTR1 induces polyubiquitination
  and degradation of RAS proteins to inhibit the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. (B) Mutated
  LZTR1 loses the ability to regulate RAS superfamily proteins, leading to excessive
  activation of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. (C) A total of six N-terminal Kelch
  motifs and two BACK domains are located at the C-terminus within LZTR1. The Kelch
  domains selectively recruit substrates, whereas the BACK domains are predicted to
  mediate dimerization and CUL3 binding. (D) Mutations in Kelch domains decrease binding
  to substrates. The mutations located in the BTB/BACK domains of LZTR1 prevent the
  binding of LZTR1 to CUL3. All of these mutations prevent the formation of the substrate-LZTR1-CUL3
  complex. (E) LZTR1 mediates RAF phosphorylation by binding to the RAF1/PPP1CB/SHOC2
  complex to inhibit the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. (F) Mutations in LZTR1 lead to
  loss of RAF1 regulation, leading to excessive activation of the RAS/MAPK signaling
  pathway, eventually resulting in Noonan syndrome. LZTR1, leucine zipper-like transcription
  regulator 1; BTB, broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac; BACK, BTB and C-terminal
  Kelch; CUL, cullin; PPP1CB, protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit β; RBX, RING
  box protein; WT wild-type; Mut, mutant; UB, ubiquitin; P, pyrophosphate.
