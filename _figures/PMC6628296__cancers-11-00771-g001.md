caption: Overview of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway illustrating therapeutic
  intervention points targeted by Wnt modulators. The lower half of the figure represents
  a zoomed in portion of the cell. Porcupine (PORCN) inhibitors (e.g., LGK974) block
  secretion of WNTs by inhibiting their palmitoylation. AXIN1 activators (e.g., niclosamide)
  promote β-catenin degradation. Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) antibodies may increase Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling by blocking DKK1 binding to LRP5/6; beneficial effects in cancer may be
  through inhibition of DKK1 binding to CKAP4 or indirect effects on immune cells.
  Wnt receptor decoys (e.g., OMP54F28) prevent Wnt binding to Fzd receptors. WNT5A
  mimic (Foxy-5) is a peptide that activates noncanonical Wnt signals. CBP/beta-catenin
  inhibitors (e.g., PRI-724) disrupt the interaction between CREB-binding protein
  (CBP) and β-catenin. Created with BioRender.com. Proteins and cell compartments
  are not drawn to scale.
