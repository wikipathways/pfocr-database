caption: Overview of Sirt3 deacetylation targets, and regulation of Sirt3 expression
  and activity. Sirt3 is a mitochondrial matrix-localized deacetylase that targets
  various subunits of complexes within the electron transport system, and appears
  to be a critical regulator of cellular ATP. Sirt3 also deacetylates enzymes within
  the β-oxidation pathway, including LCAD, and within the TCA cycle, including IDH2.
  Sirt3 is also a key regulator of antioxidant defense pathways. Enhanced IDH2 activity
  yields critical regeneration of NADPH for the glutathione detoxification pathway,
  and deacetylation of MnSOD on multiple conserved sites has been shown to enhance
  the activity of this mitochondrial-localized dismutase. Sirt3 expression is regulated
  by PGC-1α and ERRα, while its activity can be inhibited by 4-HNE-mediated carbonylation.
