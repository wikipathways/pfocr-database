caption: 'A model is presented illustrating how the closure of plasmodesmata is mediated
  by PDLP5 during immune responses: PDLP5 induced by the salicylic acid (SA) signaling
  pathway (1) stimulates the enzymatic activity of yet-to-be-identified callose synthase
  (2), which enhances callose accumulation at plasmodesmata (PD) (3). How this activation
  occurs remains to be discovered. Accumulation of plasmodesmal callose leads to the
  closure of plasmodesmata (4). PDLP5 contains an extracellular domain that may function
  in perceiving a putative signal or ligands (triangles), generation of which is dependent
  on salicylic acid pathway (SA) pathway (dashed arrows). The signal perception by
  PDLP5 may be required for the PDLP5 function in activating callose synthase (2)
  and/or feedback regulation of the SA pathway (5). LYM2, anchored to the membrane
  via glycosylphosphatidylinositol modification, binds to chitin derived from a fungal
  pathogen, which by an unknown mechanism closes plasmodesmata.'
