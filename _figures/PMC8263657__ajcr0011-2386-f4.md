caption: Status of proteins that participate in the apoptotic pathway in cancer. An
  overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins has been reported, as well as a downregulation
  of pro-apoptotic proteins that participate in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
  and in the TNF receptor pathway. It has been suggested that the dysregulation of
  these proteins induces resistance to apoptosis in different therapeutic approaches.
