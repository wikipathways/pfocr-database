caption: (A) ICL‐induced fork stalling recruits the FANCM–FAAP24–MHF1/2 complex, which,
  in turn, activates ATR signalling. ATR phosphorylates components of the FA core
  complex (FANCA and FANCE) and FANCI–FANCD2. FA core complex recruitment to damage
  site leads to FANCI–FANCD2 monoubiquitination and chromatin binding to initiate
  repair. (B) IR‐induced DNA damage elicits ATM and ATR activation leading to phosphorylation
  of FANCD2. ATR is required for the efficient monoubiquitination of FANCD2 by the
  core complex, which triggers cell cycle arrest. (C) Low‐dose (e.g. 0.5 mM) HU treatment
  elicits ATR activation and FANCD2 binding to MCM2‐7, which limits DNA synthesis.
  Concomitantly, FANCI also binds the MCM complex to promote dormant origin firing.
  ATR‐dependent FANCI phosphorylation inhibits dormant origin firing and initiates
  DNA repair/replication fork restart. FANCD2 also inhibits FANCI‐mediated dormant
  origin firing, independently of its monoubiquitination status. (D) High‐dose (2–5 mM)
  HU treatment elicits activation of the classical FA pathway. BRCA1, BRCA2 and monoubiquitinated
  FANCD2 are recruited to stalled replication forks to protect them from degradation
  by stabilising RAD51 filaments on single‐stranded DNA.
