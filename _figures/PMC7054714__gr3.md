caption: 'Model for the Immune Response Mechanism Against AAV VectorsCooperation between
  pDCs (that sense the AAV genome via TLR9 and produce T1 IFN), cDCs (that present
  antigen), and CD4+ T helper cells (that provide co-stimulation via the CD40-CD40L
  pathway) leads to activation of CD8+ T cells. Antibody formation also depends on
  CD4+ T helper cells and is augmented by activation of moDCs, resulting in IL-1β
  and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and is modulated by T1 IFN. Abbreviations
  are as follows: IFNAR-1, interferon α/β receptor 1; cDC, conventional dendritic
  cell; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cell; IFN, interferon; TLR, Toll-like receptor;
  MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; moDC, monocyte-derived dendritic cell; and CD, cluster of differentiation.'
