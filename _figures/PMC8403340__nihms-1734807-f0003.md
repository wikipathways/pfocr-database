caption: A. Protein-protein interaction-derived glutamatergic receptor subnetwork.
  This glutamatergic receptor subnetwork consists of 26 genes including GRM5 and GSG1L,
  two glutamatergic receptor subtypes expressed in P7 glial cells. B. An optimized
  PPI network of glutamatergic receptor subtypes and calcium signaling proteins. Two
  subunits of NMDARs (GRIN2A, GRIN2B) are highly expressed in GBM and interact with
  voltage-gated calcium channels and actin-based motor molecule, myosin (MYLs, MYHs).
  NMDARs and mGluR1/3 (GRM3, GRM5) are connected, interacting with Calmodulin-1 (CALM1)
  and also links to AMPA receptor (GRIA1), myosin and voltage-gated calcium channels
  networks. The extended PPI network connections were established base on human tumor
  databases (KEGG, Gene Ontology). C. Protein-protein interaction subnetwork with
  AMPAR subunit GRIA3 and NMDAR subunits GRIK1 and GRIK5 in LGG. GluRs, mGluR3 and
  iGluR Kainate1/5 (GRIK1, GRIK5) are connected to voltage-gated calcium channels
  and intracellular calcium channels either directly or through Disks large homolog
  4 (DLG4) and Calmodulin-1 (CALM1).
