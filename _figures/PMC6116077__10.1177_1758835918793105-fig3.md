caption: Interferon pathway. Type I IFN binds to the IFNAR. IFNAR activates the JAK
  family members JAK1 and Tyk-2, with subsequent phosphorylation of signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and 2 (STAT2) proteins. These proteins
  form the complex called ISGF3 when they bind to IRF9 (p48). ISGF3 initiates transcription
  of several ISGs by binding to ISREs in their promoter regions. The receptor of type
  II IFN is called IFNGR and also initiates induction of JAK1 and JAK2 recruitment
  with STAT1 homodimers that activate genes containing a GAS.GAS, gamma-activated
  sequence; IFN, interferon; IFNAR, IFN-α/β receptor; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene;
  ISGF3, IFN-stimulated gene factor 3; ISRE, IFN-stimulated response element; JAK,
  Janus kinase.
