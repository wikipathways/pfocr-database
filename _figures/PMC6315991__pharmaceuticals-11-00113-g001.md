caption: Links between Lipid and Iron Metabolic Pathways. (Top) Pyruvate, a product
  of glycolysis, is converted to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria. Acetyl-CoA feeds
  into the Krebs (TCA) cycle, illustrated in light blue, to generate citrate; the
  conversion of citrate to isocitrate is mediated by the enzyme aconitase and requires
  binding to Fe-S clusters (as indicated by the brown circle). Citrate can also be
  transported from the mitochondria to the cytosolic compartment where it is used
  to generate acetyl-CoA; this molecule can then feed into either the cholesterol
  biosynthetic pathway (green) or the fatty acid synthesis pathway (yellow). Elevated
  liver iron concentrations correlated with increased mRNA expression of several genes
  involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (namely, HMGCR, PMVK, CYP51, TM7SF2, NSDHL,
  EBP, and SC5D), as indicated with brown triangles (see ). Exogenous fatty acids
  can also be imported into the cell; together, fatty acids, triacylglycerides, and
  cholesterol esters are essential components of lipid droplets. As detailed in ,
  iron can promote both fatty acid import and lipid droplet formation. Synthesis of
  triacylglycerides, as well as phospholipids (and their modification), are presented
  in pink, whereas the sphingolipid metabolic pathway is displayed in dark blue. Iron
  can promote the production of ceramide (indicated with a brown triangle), and in
  turn induces HAMP expression, which negatively regulates FPN1 (refer to ). Furthermore,
  our own unpublished work suggests iron treatment in human fallopian tube secretory
  epithelial cells (FTSECs) increases mRNA expression of autotaxin (ATX), which is
  involved in generating lysophosphatidic acid (see ). (Bottom) TBI can be imported
  via endocytosis by binding to CD71; Fe(III) is then converted to Fe(II) by STEAP3
  prior to being transported from the endosomal compartment to the cytosolic LIP by
  DMT1. Alternatively, NTBI can be imported into cells by DMT1 (following conversion
  of Fe(III) to Fe(II) by DCYTB), ZIP8, or ZIP14 []. From the LIP, iron may be (a)
  transported to the mitochondria for use in Fe-S cluster generation, (b) loaded to
  ferritin by PCBP1, or (c) used by the cell for other cellular processes. Iron can
  also be released from the ferritin complex via NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy. Increased
  iron levels in the cell can promote the formation of lipid peroxides, a process
  critical for ferroptosis (shown in grey). Please see [,,,,,,,,] for comprehensive
  reviews of these pathways and the contributing enzymes.
