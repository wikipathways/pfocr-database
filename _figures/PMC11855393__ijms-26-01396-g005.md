caption: 'Targets of immunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Inhibitors
  are shown in red. TNBC cells express PD-L1, which interacts with PD-1 receptors
  on T cells, thereby inhibiting the cytotoxic activity of T cells. The administration
  of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors disrupts this interaction, allowing T cells to effectively
  eliminate TNBC cells. Pembrolizumab, nivolumab and spartalizumab are monoclonal
  antibodies that bind and block PD-1 receptors. Atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab
  are humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibodies that target PD-L1. Bintrafusp alfa is a
  bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of TGF-β receptor
  II linked to a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody blocking PD-L1. GEN1046 is a IgG1
  bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and 4-1BB. KN046 is a bispecific antibody targeting
  PD-L1 and CTLA-4. CA-170 is a small-molecule inhibitor of PD-L1 and VISTA. Tumor
  cells produce CD80 and CD86, which engage with CTLA-4 on T cells, resulting in the
  suppression of T cell-mediated tumor destruction. The use of a CTLA-4 inhibitor
  can block this interaction, thereby enabling T cells to effectively kill the TNBC
  cells. Tremelimumab and ipilimumab are monoclonal antibodies that block CTLA-4.
  HCAb 4003-1 is a human heavy chain-only antibody against CTLA-4. LAG-3 is expressed
  on T cell membrane and binds to MHC-II on TNBC cells. The interaction with MHC-II
  obstructs the binding of CD4 and the T-cell receptor and leads to a reduction in
  T-cell activation. Six LAG-3 antibodies are currently being investigated: five monoclonal
  antibodies (LAG525, REGN3767, BI 754111, tebotelimab, and FS118) and one LAG-3-Ig
  fusion protein—IMP321. TIGIT is expressed in T cells and natural killer cells. The
  presence of CD155 at high levels on tumor cells enables its binding to TIGIT, which
  in turn induces both direct and indirect downregulation of T-cell responses. Tiragolumab
  is a human monoclonal antibody targeting TIGIT, demonstrating a synergistic effect
  when combined with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. TNBC cells express Galectin 9, which
  interacts with TIM-3 receptors on T cells, thereby downregulating the activity of
  T cells. MBG453 is a monoclonal antibody targeting TIM-3. B7-H3 is significantly
  upregulated in tumor cells as well as in activated immune cells that infiltrate
  tumors, playing a crucial role in the TNBC evasion of immune response. The receptors
  for B7-H3 remain unclear. MGA271 (enoblituzumab) is a monoclonal antibody that targets
  B7-H3. VISTA exhibits dual immunosuppressive functions, acting both as a ligand
  found on tumor cells and as a receptor expressed on T cells. At present, clinical
  trials are examining two anti-VISTA antagonistic antibodies (JNJ-61610588, CI-8993)
  and a small-molecule inhibitor CA-170. PARP enzymes play a crucial role in the repair
  mechanisms of single-strand breaks in DNA. Inhibition of PARP leads to the formation
  of double-strand breaks. The accumulation of double-strand breaks triggers apoptotic
  pathways in the affected cell. This process of immunogenic cell death enhances the
  release of tumor antigens and promotes localized inflammation. Abbreviations: programmed
  cell death protein 1 (PD-1); programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1); cytotoxic T
  lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4; lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3); T cell immunoglobulin
  and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3); T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin
  and ITIM domain (TIGIT); major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII); V-domain Ig
  suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA); poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP); transforming
  growth factor beta (TGF-β); V-Set and immunoglobulin domain containing 3 (VSIG-3)'
