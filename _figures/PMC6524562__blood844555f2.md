caption: Neutrophil response toward the microbiota. (A) Under steady state, the microbiota
  induces a regulatory network that suppresses neutrophil recruitment to prevent inflammatory
  responses toward the epithelium and commensals. (B) SFB and other commensals can
  induce Th17 cells, which secrete IL-17 to recruit neutrophils to the intestinal
  epithelium, resulting in a negative feedback control of the microbiota by neutrophils.
  Neutrophils also produce IL-22, which can elicit AMP secretion from the epithelium
  and IgA production from intestinal B cells. (C) Macrophages and dendritic cells
  in the mucosal system constitutively produce large amounts of pro-IL1β, the inactive
  form of the pleiotropic cytokine IL-1β. Signals from pathogenic microorganisms trigger
  the conversion through the NLRC4 inflammasome pathway, which induces robust neutrophil
  recruitment. Recruited neutrophils can migrate into the lumen of intestine to form
  an organized intraluminal structure that prevents translocation and expansion of
  both commensal and pathogenic species. (D) Certain pathogenic species, such as Salmonella,
  can take advantage of neutrophil-mediated defense mechanisms to acquire growth advantages
  by using S4O62− as an electron acceptor. S2O32−, thiosulfate; S4O62−, tetrathionate;
  Th, T helper.
