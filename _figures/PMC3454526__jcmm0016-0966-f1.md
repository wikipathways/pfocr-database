caption: Impaired lipid metabolism induced by HFD or genetic manipulation induces
  heart dysfunction. Different mechanisms that initiate fat accumulation also lead
  to heart dysfunction in Drosophila. In 1 (centre), a HFD regime activates the TOR
  pathway, lowers ATGL/Bmm lipase and increases FAS levels. This leads to fat accumulation
  and heart dysfunction []. In 2 (right), dysregulation of phospholipid synthesis
  in easily shocked (eas) mutant flies (decreased production of phosphatidylethanolamine,
  PE) augments SREBP processing, which leads to accumulation of active (nuclear) SREBP
  (m-SREBP) and increased expression of lipogenic genes (e.g. FAS, ACC). This process
  also results in fat accumulation and heart dysfunction []. Both direct and indirect
  genetic mechanisms are implicated in fat accumulation and heart dysfunction, demonstrating
  the need to identify new factors (?) that might reveal how fat accumulation causes
  heart dysfunction. In 3 (left), a new feedback inhibitory loop involving Sestrin
  (dSesn in flies) is involved in modulating TOR activity. Increased TOR signaling
  augments ROS production, which activates the transcription factor FoxO via Jun-N-terminal
  kinase. In turn, FoxO activates dSesn, which inhibits TOR activity by activating
  the AMPK/TSC axis. In dSesn mutant flies, this negative feedback loop is diminished,
  leading to hyperactivation of the TOR pathway and consequently to fat accumulation
  and heart dysfunction [].
