caption: Calcium signaling is involved in the cell proliferation and apoptosis in
  PDAC. PDACs overexpress PMCA4 and TG2, which have an anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic
  effect, respectively. Also, SMTD1 and BNIP3, which have a pro-apoptotic effect,
  are under-expressed in PDAC. Under-expression of BNIP3 is driven by over-expression
  of S100A4. Gastrin has an anti-apoptotic effect via an inhibitory phosphorylation
  of FOXO3 and BAD by AKT. SOCE activates both the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and the nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB, which promotes proliferation. In addition, it prevents the
  overactivation of the MAPK pathway, which can lead to the cell cycle arrest. Also
  KCa3.1 channel is overexpressed and enhances proliferation. “↑” stands for overexpression
  and “↓” stands for under-expression. Created using BioRender.com source, accessed
