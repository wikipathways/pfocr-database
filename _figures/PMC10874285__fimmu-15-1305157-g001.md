caption: 'HCV inhibits the innate immune response. HCV proteins can directly inhibit
  the innate immune response. NS3/4A plays multiple roles in blocking the host innate
  immune response. It cleaves MAVS on MAM to block the RIG-I signaling pathway and
  TRIF to inhibit the TLR3 signaling pathway. NS4B can also disrupt TLR3-mediated
  IFN signaling by inducing the degradation of TRIF via caspase-8. Other HCV proteins
  had also been shown to regulate and restrict the production of IFNs and their antiviral
  signaling: E2 induces SOCS1 and SOCS3; NS3/4A sequesters STING to inhibit the activation
  of TBK1; NS5A sequesters MyD88 to inhibit TLR signaling; and NS5B induces and activates
  PKR to inhibit the expression of IFNs and ISGs. HCV also usurps the antiviral activity
  of autophagy and uses it for its own replication. It not only utilizes the autophagic
  membranes as the sites for its RNA replication and the production of infectious
  HCV particles, but also manipulates autophagy to regulate type I IFN response by
  promoting the autophagic degradation of IFNAR1, TNFR1, and TRAF6, important signal
  transducers for the activation of NF-κB and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  HCV-induced mitophagy also regulates innate immune response by clearing mitochondrial
  DAMPs, namely mtROS and mtDNA, and damaged mitochondria themselves, which otherwise
  would activate the cGAS/STING/TBK1 pathway to induce the expression of IFNs. Mitophagy
  also inhibits premature apoptotic cell death and promotes HCV persistence. RC: HCV
  RNA replication complex. The mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) is boxed and
  enlarged in the inset to reveal the Ca2+ transporter IP3R'
