caption: A. Anatomical circuit representation showing structures and pathways involved
  in rodent intertemporal decisions. Structures and DA receptors are only included
  if silencing with lesions, inactivation, or blockade altered rodent delay discounting.
  Solid black lines indicate the pathways that are required for normal discounting
  performance; whereas solid grey lines represent pathways that are not necessary
  for normal performance. Pathways marked by dotted grey lines have yet to be tested
  during delay discounting tasks; and the dotted black line (and asterisk) shows a
  pathway that has been implicated in choice of a single delayed choice but has yet
  to be tested during a discounting task. B. The first table lists the changes to
  delay discounting curves that resulted from silencing structures and disconnecting
  a pathway. C. The second table lists the changes to delay discounting curves that
  resulted from pharmacologically manipulating DA signaling. (⭡) decreased discounting;
  (⭣) increased discounting/impulsive choice; NE- no effect; + stimulated DA signaling;
  -- blocked DA signaling; BLA-basolateral amygdala; HPC-hippocampus; LHb-lateral
  habenula (inactivation leads to indifference (Colin M Stopper & Floresco, 2013));
  mPFC-medial prefrontal cortex; NAc-nucleus accumbens; OFC-orbitofrontal cortex;
  VTA-ventral tegmental area. D.
