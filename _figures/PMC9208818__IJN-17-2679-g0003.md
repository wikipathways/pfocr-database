caption: 'Summary of exosomes as potential targets for oral cancer therapy. (A) Chemotherapeutic
  resistance and sensitivity: ① THP-1 and PHM-derived exosomes reduce the susceptibility
  of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) OSCC cells to chemotherapeutics via the activation
  of the AKT/GSK 3β signalling pathway.② Exosomes produced from cisplatin-resistant
  OSCC cells transmit miR-21 to OSCC parent cells to induce cisplatin resistance.
  ③ normal tongue epithelial cells transfer exosomal miR-200c to HSC-3DR cells and
  combine with TUBB3 and PPP2R1B to increase the sensitivity of HSC-3DR cells to docetaxel.
  (B) Angiogenesis: ④ Exosomal miR-221 promotes the angiogenesis and migration of
  human umbilical vein endothelial cells by negatively regulating PIK3R1. ⑤ Additionally,
  the expression of exosomal miR-210-3p and ephrinA3 can be upregulated by the PI3K/AKT
  pathway to promote oral cancer angiogenesis. (C) Modulation of immune responses:
  ⑥ Oral carcinoma-derived exosome NAP1 increases the cytotoxicity of natural killer
  (NK) cells through the IRF-3 pathway and enhances the tumour suppressive function
  of NK cells. ⑦ However, OSCC cell-derived exosomes can induce the polarization or
  transformation of macrophages to the M1- or M2-like phenotype by activating related
  pathway signals, increasing the invasion and proliferation of OSCC. ⑧ Exosomal PD-L1
  in the plasma of patients with oral cancer can drive immunosuppression and contribute
  to immune escape of oral cancer cells. (D) Proliferation and migration: ⑨ OSCC cells
  secrete many epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing exosomes in response
  to EGF stimulation. Subsequently, EGFR-rich exosomes can enter epithelial cells
  and promote epithelial–mesenchymal transformation, thereby promoting the invasion
  and migration of OSCC. ⑩ Activation of lnc-CAF by IL-33 can induce OSCC cell proliferation.
  ⑪ OSCC-derived exosomes are absorbed by OSCC cells and considerably boost the invasion,
  propagation, and transplantation of OSCC by activating the JNK-1/2, PI3K/Akt and
  MAPK/ERK pathways.⑫ Exosomal miR-6887-5p inhibits tumour growth and OSCC cell colony
  formation.⑬ Exosomal miR-1294 can suppress the growth of OSCC cells by regulating
  the c-Myc pathway.⑭ HBMSC-derived exosomal miR-101-3p can suppress the invasion,
  propagation, and transplantation of oral cancer cells by downregulating COL10A1,
  thus inhibiting the progression of oral cancer. In conclusion, exosomal miR-21,
  miR-200c, miR-221, miR-210-3p, NAP1, THBS1, miR-23a-3p, CMTM6, miR-29a-3p, PD-L1,
  EGFR, lnc-CAF, miR-6887-5p, miR-1294, miR-101-3p, OSCC-derived exosomes and macrophage-derived
  exosomes are potential targets for oral cancer treatment.'
