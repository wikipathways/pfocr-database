caption: Brief overview of the tryptophan metabolic pathway with box plots included
  showing metabolites detected here and significantly altered by culture with inflammatory
  cytokines (blue rectangles). Metabolites significantly increased are shown in bold
  red, those significantly decreased in bold green color; the notation of the box
  plots is the same as used before in  or . The large changes in kynurenine and kynurenate
  are associated with significant increases in tryptophan intermediates 3-indoxyl
  sulfate and indolelactate as well as with concomitant loss of several nicotinamide
  intermediates suggesting that inflammatory conditions perturb tryptophan metabolism
  to favor the indole and kynurenine axes.
