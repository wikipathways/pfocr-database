caption: Phase separation in Notch signaling for oncogenic Myc activation and developmental
  fate control. a NICD-Dependent Super-Enhancer Loop in T-ALL Cells. In human T-cell
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells, Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD)-dependent
  super-enhancer loops activate the proto-oncogene Myc. This activation is facilitated
  by a phase-separated transcription machinery that sequesters Co-R and recruits RNA
  polymerase II (RNA pol II), BRD4, MED1, MAML, and RBPJ. These components form condensates
  that enhance the transcriptional activity required for Myc expression, contributing
  to oncogenic transformation in T-ALL. b Numb regulation of NICD during asymmetric
  cell division. Numb, a negative regulator of NICD signaling during asymmetric cell
  division, undergoes phase separation with polarity proteins Par3 and Ccdc85c. This
  phase separation sequesters Numb away from the Notch signaling pathway, promoting
  radial glial cell differentiation and proliferation. By sequestering Numb, phase-separated
  condensates modulate Notch pathway dynamics, influencing cellular fate decisions
  during development

  description: Phase separation in Notch signaling for oncogenic Myc activation and
    developmental fate control. a NICD-Dependent Super-Enhancer Loop in T-ALL Cells.
    In human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells, Notch Intracellular
    Domain (NICD)-dependent super-enhancer loops activate the proto-oncogene Myc.
    This activation is facilitated by a phase-separated transcription machinery that
    sequesters Co-R and recruits RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II), BRD4, MED1, MAML,
    and RBPJ. These components form condensates that enhance the transcriptional activity
    required for Myc expression, contributing to oncogenic transformation in T-ALL.
    b Numb regulation of NICD during asymmetric cell division. Numb, a negative regulator
    of NICD signaling during asymmetric cell division, undergoes phase separation
    with polarity proteins Par3 and Ccdc85c. This phase separation sequesters Numb
    away from the Notch signaling pathway, promoting radial glial cell differentiation
    and proliferation. By sequestering Numb, phase-separated condensates modulate
    Notch pathway dynamics, influencing cellular fate decisions during development
