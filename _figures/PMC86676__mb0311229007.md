caption: Proposed pathways for the cytokine regulation of Baf-3 cell survival. Signals
  arising from the membrane-proximal portion of the βc chain contribute to the rapid
  and stable expression of Bcl-xL through activation of STAT5 but downregulate Bim
  only transiently. By contrast, signals from the membrane-distal domain of the βc
  chain activate the P13-K/mTOR and Raf/MAPK pathways through Ras stimulation. Either
  pathway can downregulate Bim expression. When suppressed, Bim cannot inhibit the
  antiapoptotic functions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and thus contributes to the cytokine-mediated
  survival of Baf-3 cells.
