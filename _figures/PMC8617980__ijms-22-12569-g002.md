caption: Selected aspects of the multilevel impact of novel adenosinergic therapies.
  (A) At the primary tumour site and (B) distant tumour site, the blockage of CD39/73
  by mAbs attenuates the generation of eADO from its precursor ATP. Simultaneously,
  CD73 exerts an ambiguous role in tissue structure maintenance and stroma remodelling
  (dashed line). Targeting of the A2AR transduction pathway with small-molecule antagonists
  results in inhibition of ADO-mediated immunosuppression and production of TGF-β,
  which is necessary for maturation of myeloid cells into MDSC. Blockage of A2AR positively
  affects EVs production, as suggested by preliminary reports. Antagonism of A2BR
  attenuates the effects of hypoxia-driven tumour progression and radioresistance
  while downregulating cellular reprogramming and the EMT process. Additionally, A2BR
  modulates TGF-β production in a manner that depends on cell type and related factors
  and thus has an ambiguous effect on tissue structure. Blocking A2BR also inhibits
  the polarization of macrophages to the immune-tolerant M2-like phenotype and reduces
  ROS generation. Controlled production of ROS stimulates angiogenesis, whereas ROS
  overproduction causes detrimental oxidative stress in endothelial cells leading
  to cell death. A2BR could thus have both proangiogenic and anti-angiogenic effects.
  (C) Commensal bacteria in the gut release inosine into the lamina propria, which
  stimulates the differentiation of naïve T cells into Th1 in an A2AR-dependent manner
  specific to intestinal T cells. Activated Th1 cells then facilitate ICI therapy.
  Therefore, while exerting anticancer effects at the tumour site, the inhibition
  of A2AR could potentially limit the effectiveness of immuno-therapy. A1R, adenosine
