caption: 'Overview of the molecular interaction between estrogen and thyroid hormone.
  The interaction can be broken down into nuclear and non-nuclear signaling pathways.
  Non-nuclear pathway: Binding of estrogen to estrogen receptor α (ERα) can activate
  the ERα-shc complex, thereby allowing the Modulator of Nongenomic Actions of the
  Estrogen Receptor (MNAR) to bind and ultimately activate the src tyrosine kinase.
  Src can then phosphorylate/activate the Ras/Raf g-protein or phosphoinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K) protein to induce cellular proliferation pathways via Akt or Mitogen Activated
  Protein Kinase (MAPK), respectively. MAPK exerts its effects by phosphorylating/activating
  Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), which amplifies its effects
  via a host of other signaling molecules-only several of which are illustrated here.
  At the same time, triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (T4) are producing
  similar effects. These two hormones have been shown to stimulate different subunits
  of the αvβ3 integrin receptor, S1 and S2, which produces the same signal cascade
  utilized by estrogen involving PI3K and MAPK. T3 also exerts its effects in estrogen-sensitive
  tissues by translocating into the cell where it can bind to its cytoplasmic receptor
  and heteromerize with ERα as shown. From there, this ERα and thyroid receptor complex
  can either activate MAPK or translocate to the nucleus to exert its transcriptional
  effects. Nuclear pathway: Once inside the nucleus, the downstream effectors of both
  thyroid hormone and estrogen (ERα, p53, STAT1, and thyroid hormone receptor β1)
  can effect transcriptional changes to inhibit apoptosis as well as induce cellular
  proliferation. Specifically, the activated ERα (which can either be phosphorylated
  by ERK1/2 or heteromerized with thyroid hormone receptor) can stimulate the Estrogen
  Response Element (ERE) to alter the transcriptional levels of key proteins involved
  in cell proliferation and survival.'
