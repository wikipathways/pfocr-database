caption: Glycolytic enzymes in pancreatic cancer. The regulation of key enzymes is
  particularly important. The activation of KRAS enhances the transcription of GLUT1,
  promotes the glucose uptake and lactic acid production, and also promotes the activation
  of glycolytic enzymes (such as HK2, PFK1, and LDHA). Upregulated KRAS leads to the
  inhibition of TP53 pathway. The TP53 inactivation supports cell glycolysis by disrupting
  the translocation of GAPDH from nuclear to cytosol. MVIH inhibits the activity of
  PGK-1, and FX11. And NHI inhibitor and gemcitabine inhibit the LDH activity. PPP,
  pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; HK2, hexokinase 2; PFK1, Phosphofructokinase
  1; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  MVIH, microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.
