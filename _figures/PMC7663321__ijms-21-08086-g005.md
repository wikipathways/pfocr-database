caption: Model proposed for CeraTrap® perception in A. ludens antennas based on antenna
  proteomics data. (A), Immature flies highly responsive to CeraTrap® probably due
  to the upregulation of essential OBPs, an unknown receptor that in conjunction with
  Orco creates an influx of Ca2+ into the cell inducing the signal transduction of
  odor perception preferentially in female A. ludens flies. (B), In contrast, sexually
  mature flies are less responsive probably because of the upregulation of odorant
  degrading enzymes (ODE), which are activated through and known signal pathway. Proteins
  upregulated by CeraTrap® are colored in red while proteins that did not show any
  change are depicted in grey. Dotted lines indicate a suggested connection, but further
  experimental validation is needed to validate this. Arrows indicate positive activation
  whereas flat lines point out inhibition.
