caption: 'Hmox1 transcriptional regulation. (A) At steady state, Nrf2 is bound to
  Keap1 in the cytoplasm and targeted for proteasomal degradation. Bach‐1 is bound
  to Maf at the promoter region of the hmox1, suppressing its transcription. (B) During
  cellular stress, hmox1 expression is activated in several ways: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPKs) and protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylate Nrf2. This stabilizes
  Nrf2, leading to its translocation into the nucleus. PI3K/AKT inhibits GSK3β. When
  activated, GSK3β facilitates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Nrf2.
  Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 displaces Bach‐1 at the hmox1 promoter leading to transcription.
  (C) HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β. HIF-1α phosphorylation
  leads to its translocation to the nucleus and association to HIF-1β and CBP/p300,
  thus inducing hmox1 transcription. (D) Phosphorylation of c-Fos and c-Jun leads
  to their translocation to the nucleus and formation of the AP-1 complex, which induces
  hmox1 expression; (E) NF-κB is sequestered in the cytosol under basal conditions
  by the inhibitor IκB. Phosphorylation results in the proteasomal degradation of
  IĸB and the consequent release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB dimers (p50/p65)
  which targets hmox1 activation. A complex crosstalk between NF-κB and Nrf2 can also
  inhibit hmox1 transcription.'
