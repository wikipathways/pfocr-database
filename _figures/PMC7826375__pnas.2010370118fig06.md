caption: Model for the interplay between ATRX and RECQ5 to regulate distinct subpathways
  of HR. Repair of two-ended DSBs by ATRX-mediated HR outcompetes RECQ5, possibly
  through PCNA binding, thereby suppressing SDSA. Upon the completion of DNA repair
  synthesis, the resulting JM is not subject to dissolution by BLM and is channelled
  into the resolution pathway by MUS81 and GEN1, leading to equal probability of CO
  and non-CO products.
