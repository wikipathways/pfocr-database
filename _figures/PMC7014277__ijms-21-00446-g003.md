caption: Role of protein phosphatases in the DNA damage checkpoint deactivation. Once
  the DNA lesion has been fixed, multiple phosphatases cooperate in the restoration
  of the phosphorylation state of multiple components of the DNA damage checkpoint
  pathway, thus stimulating cell cycle reactivation and recovery. PP1, PP4 and WIP1
  dephosphorylate γ-H2AX and CHK1/2 to restrain the DNA damage signaling pathway.
  Wip1 also contributes to checkpoint deactivation by acting over ATM, ATR and p53.
  PP1 inhibits p53 and stimulates CDC25 activity, thus biasing the DNA damage checkpoint
  to an inactive state. The reactivation of Greatwall counteracts the PP2A inhibition
  of PLK1, thus inhibiting WEE1 activity. Green and red indicate active or inactive,
  respectively.
