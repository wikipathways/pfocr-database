caption: 'Synthesis, action receptors, and receptor inhibitors of leukotrienes (LTs).
  Arachidonic acid serves as the primary precursor for LTs synthesis. It is oxidized
  by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) to generate the intermediate LTA4, after which LT production
  diverges into two metabolic pathways: one branch involves LTA4 conversion by LTC4
  synthase (LTC4S) into LTC4 (a cysteinyl leukotriene, CysLTs), which is subsequently
  metabolized to LTD4 and LTE4. The other branch utilizes LTA4 hydrolase (LTA4H) to
  produce LTB4 (a dihydroxy acid leukotriene). Synthesis and release: LTB4 and LTC4
  are primarily synthesized intracellularly and exported via transport proteins to
  act on receptors or generate other LTs. Receptors and inhibitors: 1. BLT: BLT1 Binds
  LTB4 with high affinity, mediating inflammatory responses. Antagonists include LY293111
  and BIIL284. BLT2: primarily associated with tissue repair. 2. CysLTR: CysLT1R:
  preferentially binds LTD4. Antagonists include Montelukast and Zafirlukast. CysLT2R:
  Binds both LTC4 and LTD4. Antagonists include HAMI3379 and BayCysLT2. CysLT3R (GPR99):
  selectively responds to LTE4 but can also be activated by LTC4/LTD4. (figure was
