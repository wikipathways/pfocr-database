caption: 'Potential mechanisms of treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) using
  capsaicin and N-oleoyldopamin (OLDA). (a) Capsaicin activates the TRPV1 receptor
  and Ca2+ influx, which can induce the upregulation of microglia phagocytosis, regulate
  its metabolic process and inhibit oxidative stress in microglia and astrocytes.
  It also can mediate the endogenous production of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF),
  thereby stimulating activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) enzyme and activating
  endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms. Activation of the TRPV1 channel upregulates
  the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and reduces the production of inflammatory molecules.
  (b) OLDA in the human body comes from two pathways: one is the combination of dopamine
  and oleic acid under the action of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Moreover,
  clostridium in the intestine can also bind foreign substrates (fatty acids) commonly
  found in the human body or diet with amines under the action of non-ribosomal peptide
  synthases (NRPS) to produce OLDA. OLDA can reach the brain via the blood–brain barrier
  (BBB), enhancing thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity by activating the TRPV1
  receptor. OLDA activates TRPV1 and blocking dopamine transporter (DAT) and dopamine
  2 receptor (D2R) activation, and then leads to a wake-on-firing pattern of histaminergic
  (HA) neurons, which may have beneficial effects on the treatment of PD'
