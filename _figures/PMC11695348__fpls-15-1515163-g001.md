caption: Overview of signalling mediated by plant after pathogen infection. After
  a plant is infected by a pathogen, triggers a signaling process. This begins with
  the recognition of Pathogen/Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs)
  by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (A), which interact dynamically with co-receptors
  and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKS). Transphosphorylation occurs within
  the PRR complexes, initiating downstream signaling. These signals, originating from
  PRRs, are transmitted through phosphorylation cascades involving mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs) and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). This signaling
  pathway ultimately affects downstream targets like the NADPH oxidase RBOHD (B) during
  Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI). Additionally, many pathogens rely on glucose from
  host plants as a carbon source for their growth before they can successfully invade.
  Upon invading plants, pathogens release TAL effectors into host plant cells. These
  effectors prompt the expression of plant SWEETS (C), either directly or indirectly
  through the activation of transcription factors. As a result, sugar flows into the
  apoplast, providing nutrition for the pathogens
