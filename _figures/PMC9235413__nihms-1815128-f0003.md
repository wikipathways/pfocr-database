caption: 'Several signaling pathways have been implicated in Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
  Estrogen and progesterone induce Wnt expression in mature myometrial cells, which
  exerts a pro-proliferative effect on stem cells. Wnt, progesterone, and IGF were
  shown to activate Akt which has phosphorylated β-catenin at Ser552, activating it
  and allowing it to induce the expression of its target genes. Akt activation also
  increases expression of downstream signaling targets of Wnt/β-catenin pathway including
  c-MYC and cyclin D1. Progesterone and IGF were shown to induce the expression of
  ERK, and Ras, an upstream activator of ERK, was shown to be degraded by the degradation
  complex in a similar manner to β-catenin. Hippo pathway exerts its effect through
  YAP/TAZ, which is activated with Wnt. Notch pathway is both activated and inhibited
  by Wnt/β-catenin pathway, as Wnt induces the expression of its inhibitor, NUMB,
  while β-catenin allows for the expression of its downstream signaling targets.Abbreviation:
