caption: 'p53 is able to reduce the flux through the glycolytic pathway and increase
  oxidative phosphorylation, and in doing so opposes the Warburg effect. p53 is also
  able to regulate oxidative stress, through increasing it or decreasing it. It can
  play an antioxidant role and protect cells from high levels of ROS, promoting cell
  survival or a pro-oxidant activity that contributes to removal of a damaged or stressed
  cell. Abbreviations: APAF-1, apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1; BAX, BCL2-associated
