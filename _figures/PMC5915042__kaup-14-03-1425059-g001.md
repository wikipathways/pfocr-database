caption: Scheme describing the mechanism of lethal autophagy induced by DDA. The binding
  of DDA to NR1H2 and the transcriptional activation of LC3, TFEB, NR4A1/Nur77 and
  NR4A3/NOR1 genes are essential for DDA to mediate lethal autophagy in cancers in
  vitro and in vivo. The inhibition of the cholesterol-5,6-epoxide hydrolase (ChEH)
  and of its EBP/D8D7I subunit by DDA leading to sterol accumulation participates
  in a DDA-induced increase in lysosome formation, an essential part of the autophagy
  pathway. This dual targeting may explain the sustained lethal autophagy induced
  by DDA. LY, lysosome; AP, autophagosome; AM, amphisome; AL, autolysosome.
