caption: 'Proposed signaling pathway involved in AA-induced inflammatory responses
  and fibrosis in an animal model. ↑: increase of activation (of receptors); ┬ = inhibition;
  NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; ECM: extracellular
  matrix; Smad: mothers against decapentaplegic homolog. Exposure to AA activates
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) which trigger
  a cascade of reactions leading to activation of proinflammatory and profibrotic
  genes, then to inflammation and fibrosis, respectively.'
