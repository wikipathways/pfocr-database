caption: miR-31. TGF-β binds to the receptors leading to SMAD phosphorylation, followed
  by aggregation with SMAD-4, which induces the synthesis of pri-miR-31, which is
  subsequently processed by Drosha, resulting in pre-miR-31. Pre-miR-31 is then transported
  by the exportin 5-Ran GTPase shuttle system into the cytoplasm where it is cleaved
  by another RNase family enzyme (Dicer), resulting in the miRNA/miRNA duplex and,
  finally, mature miR-31. miR-31 negatively regulates NIK. NIK is involved in phosphorylating
  IKKα and therefore in controlling the NF-κB pathway. miRNA/miR, microRNA; pri-miR,
  primary RNA; pre-miR, miRNA precursor; DGCR8, DiGeorge syndrome critical region
  8; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; SMAD, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog

  kinase; IKK, inhibitor of NF-κB subunit α.
