caption: Illustration of a signaling pathway involved in histone PTMs in HD. Under
  normal conditions, activation of nuclear MSK-1 induces phosphorylation of (1) histone
  H3 and (2) the transcriptional factor CREB. Phosphorylated CREB recruits CBP, and
  activates its histone acetyl transferase (HAT) properties. Post-translational modifications
  (PTM) of histones (phosphorylation, acetylation) lead to modification of chromatin
  structure from heterochromatin to euchromatin, which allows gene transcription to
  occur. One of the key genes regulated by CREB is PGC1α, a crucial gene involved
  for the regulation of mitochondrial and metabolic functions. In Huntington’s disease,
  Exp-Htt expression results on (1) down-regulation of MSK-1 expression and (2) sequestration
  of CREB and CBP within Exp-Htt aggregates. Therefore, the heterochromatin structure
  is favored, a structure that impairs transcription of CREB target genes.
