caption: Purinergic signaling comprises the canonical and non-canonical adenosinergic
  pathways. The canonical pathway is responsible for the production of the anti-inflammatory
  biomolecule adenosine (ADO) starting from the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which
  is hydrolyzed to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) by
  the ectoenzymes following the axis CD39/CD73. The non-canonical adenosinergic pathway
  has the same function of adenosine formation, although this alternative way uses
  the NAD+ which is metabolized by the axis CD38/CD203a/CD73. After the adenosine
  is formed, it can activate the P1 receptors or be metabolized by the adenosine deaminase
  (ADA) and originate the inosine
