caption: Pathologic α-synuclein signaling. Homeostatic mechanisms regulate the expression
  of α-synuclein (α-syn) through two pathways for degradation of excess or defective
  protein, the ubiquitin proteosome system and the autophagic system. Under normal
  conditions α-synuclein is degraded by the proteosome, chaperone mediated autophagy
  (CMA) or microautophagy. Mutations in α-synuclein or modifications from mitochondrial
  stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) or nitrosative stress from nitric oxide (NO)
  trigger α-synuclein to oligomerize and fibrillize, which can cause the proteosome
  and CMA to become dysfunctional thereby forcing the microautophagic and macroautophagic
  pathway to be the major default mechanism for α-synuclein clearance. α-Synuclein
  fibrils can be engulfed in an autophagosome and targeted to the lysosome. In their
  recent paper in Cell Mazzuli et al. add a new twist to the understanding of α-synuclein
  pathology. They show that increased α-synuclein results in retention of glucocerebrosidase
  (GBA) in the endoplasmic reticulum initiating a feed forward cycle of increased
  α-synuclein expression and GBA retention. Mutations in GBA (GC Mutations) result
  in a decreased activity of GBA in lysosomes resulting in an increase in the GBA
  substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) promotes the stabilization of soluble α-synuclein
  oligomers, which fuels the feed forward mechanism. Although this initially delays
  fibril formation, when fibrils form there is a 2-3 fold increase in expression.
  Excess α-synuclein fibrils may lead to lysosomal dysfunction, the release of lysosomal
  proteases, and ultimately neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration.

  description: Pathologic α-synuclein signaling. Homeostatic mechanisms regulate the
    expression of α-synuclein (α-syn) through two pathways for degradation of excess
    or defective protein, the ubiquitin proteosome system and the autophagic system.
    Under normal conditions α-synuclein is degraded by the proteosome, chaperone mediated
    autophagy (CMA) or microautophagy. Mutations in α-synuclein or modifications from
    mitochondrial stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) or nitrosative stress from

    cause the proteosome and CMA to become dysfunctional thereby forcing the microautophagic
    and macroautophagic pathway to be the major default mechanism for α-synuclein
    clearance. α-Synuclein fibrils can be engulfed in an autophagosome and targeted
    to the lysosome. In their recent paper in Cell Mazzuli et al. add a new twist
    to the understanding of α-synuclein pathology. They show that increased α-synuclein
    results in retention of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) in the endoplasmic reticulum
    initiating a feed forward cycle of increased α-synuclein expression and GBA retention.
    Mutations in GBA (GC Mutations) result in a decreased activity of GBA in lysosomes
    resulting in an increase in the GBA substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) promotes
    the stabilization of soluble α-synuclein oligomers, which fuels the feed forward
