caption: Summary of NAD+ metabolism. NAD+ can be synthesised from Trp through the
  de novo biosynthesis pathway in the liver and kidneys. Nicotinic acid (more commonly
  known as vitamin B3) enters the NAD+ pool through the Preiss–Handler pathway, whereas
  nicotinamide, nicotinamide riboside and NMN (re-)enter the NAD+ pool through the
  salvage pathway. NAD+ is consumed by SIRTs, CD38, and PARP enzymes, producing nicotinamide,
  which enters the pool of NAD+ precursors for resynthesis into NAD+. Dashed arrow,
  movement of NAD+ within the NAD+ pool. NA, nicotinic acid; NAAD, nicotinic acid
  adenine dinucleotide; NAM, nicotinamide; NR, nicotinamide riboside. This figure
  is available as part of a downloadable slideset
