caption: Key pathways of glycogen synthesis and metabolism. Glycogen synthesis requires
  formation of UDP-glucose from glucose-1-phosphate and UTP to be catalysed UDP-glucose
  pyrophosphorylase. Glycogenin initiates the first step of glycogen synthesis by
  self glycosylation of a short 8–12 glucose oligosaccharide primer. Glycogen synthase
  (GYS) elongates the glucose oligossacharide primer, which utilises UDP-glucose as
  the glucosyl donor. Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) catalyses the transfer of α-1,4-linked
  glucose units from the outer ‘non-reducing’ end of a growing glycogen chain into
  an α-1,6 position of the same or neighbouring chain. Glycogen degradation requires
  the synchronous activation of the glycogen phosphorylase and the bifunctional enzyme
  glycogen debranching enzyme. Glycogen phosphorylase releases glucose-1-P from the
  terminal alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond, and the glycogen debranching enzyme catalyses
  the removal of the branches. DBE transfers three glucose blocks to another glycogen
  chain, and then hydrolytically cleaves the remaining glucose of the branch, generating
  free glucose. Glycogen-derived glucose-1-P and free glucose can enter the glycolytic
  or the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
