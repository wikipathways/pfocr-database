caption: 'Regulatory network of stress responses to drought, salt, and cold: specificity
  and cross-talk. The common osmotic component of drought, salt, and cold leads to
  common signaling pathways mediated by several kinases like AtSK, SnRK2, SnRK3, MAPK,
  and CDPK proteins. Calcium was shown to be an upstream element in some SnRK3, CDPK,
  and MAPK activation, whereas PA, ABA, and H2O2 are presumed to be involved in SnRK2
  and/or MAPK regulation. In addition to these common signaling events, some pathways
  are specific to one stress condition like the SOS pathway regulating sodium homeostasis
  in response to NaCl, and the SnRK2.6-mediated stomatal closure induced by ABA in
  response to drought. In major cases, downstream responses regulated by protein kinases
  are still unknown.'
