caption: ASIC3-dependent nociceptive signaling pathway during inflammation. ASIC3
  is expressed in nociceptors, which respond to many pro-inflammatory mediators, such
  as acidosis (H+), serotonin (5-HT), arachidonic acid (AA), bradykinin (BK), prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE2), nerve growth factor (NGF), and agmatine (AGM). Both H+ and AGM induce
  ASIC3 channel activation independently, although they are mutually interacting.
  AA and hyperosmolarity (H-Osm) indirectly facilitate ASIC3 activation. 5-HT, BK,
  PGE2, and NGF stimulate ASIC3 expression. The multicolor DRG neurons represent diverse
  sensory pathways relaying various nociceptive inputs dependent on ASIC3 channels
  to the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) under inflammation, although the exact distribution
  profiles of ASIC3 in nerve fibers are unclear. Stimulation of the nociceptor triggers
  a synaptic response in the SDH, and the noxious stimuli are then transmitted to
  the supraspinal structures as indicated.

  description: ASIC3-dependent nociceptive signaling pathway during inflammation.
    ASIC3 is expressed in nociceptors, which respond to many pro-inflammatory mediators,

    5-HT, BK, PGE2, and NGF stimulate ASIC3 expression. The multicolor DRG neurons
    represent diverse sensory pathways relaying various nociceptive inputs dependent
    on ASIC3 channels to the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) under inflammation, although
    the exact distribution profiles of ASIC3 in nerve fibers are unclear. Stimulation
    of the nociceptor triggers a synaptic response in the SDH, and the noxious stimuli
