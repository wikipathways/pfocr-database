caption: Schematic diagram of MANF and NPM1 interaction in the trophoblast during
  URM pathogenesis. In the trophoblasts of patients with URM, overexpressed MANF protein
  appears to undergo nuclear translocation and interacts with NPM1, resulting in increased
  ubiquitination of NPM1, decreased expression of NPM1, increased activation of the
  p53 signaling pathway, limited proliferation of trophoblastic cells, decreased invasion
  and migration functions, and induced miscarriage.
