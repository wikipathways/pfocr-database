caption: 'Proteolytic processing of APP is divided into an amyloidogenic and an antiamyloidogenic
  pathway. Amyloidogenic pathway: Cleavage of APP by the protease β-secretase (BACE1)
  occurs at the N-terminus of the Aβ domain and yields the secreted sAPPβ as well
  as a C-terminal fragment of APP of 99 amino acids (C99). C99 is further cleaved
  within its transmembrane domain by γ-secretase, leading to the secretion of the
  Aβ peptide and the generation of the APP intracellular domain (AICD). The Aβ peptide
  is prone to aggregation. Aβ peptide oligomers are neurotoxic and lead to an impairment
  of long-term potentiation (LTP). Finally, large amounts of Aβ peptide are deposited
  in amyloid plaques, which are the characteristic pathological hallmarks of AD. The
  consecutive cleavage of APP by β- and γ-secretase constitutes the amyloidogenic
  pathway as it generates Aβ. Antiamyloidogenic pathway: Cleavage of APP by α-secretase
  within the Aβ peptide domain yields the neurotrophic and neuroprotective sAPPα.
  The α-secretase is a member of the ADAM family of metalloproteases. α-Cleavage of
  APP can be induced upon overexpression of ADAM10 or by the activation of second
  messenger cascades.'
