caption: A proposed model of CP-MSC-induced hepatic regeneration through regulation
  of PRL-1 expression. Migration of transplanted CP-MSCs to the damaged liver tissues
  was regulated by a PRL-1-mediated Rho family signaling pathway. Engrafted CP-MSCs
  stimulated hepatic regeneration in damaged liver tissues through increased PRL-1
  expression and enhanced hepatic proliferation.
