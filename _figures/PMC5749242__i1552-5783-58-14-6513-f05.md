caption: The two fates of C3b generated in the retina. On C3 activation, the resulting
  C3b may be either proteolytically cleaved (inactivated) or generate a C3 convertase
  (C3bBb) to produce more C3b (a feedback or amplification loop). On the left, the
  combined action of regulatory proteins factor H (CFH) and factor I (CFI) cleave
  and inactivate C3b, resulting in iC3b, which does not participate in the amplification
  process. On the right, C3b, together with factor B (FB) and factor D (FD), forms
  a C3 convertase, which, in turn, cleaves C3 and generates more active C3b. Thus,
  variants seen in AMD, such as a loss of function (LOF) in CFH (e.g., R1210C), LOF
  in CFI, or a gain of function in C3 (e.g., K155Q) (e.g., Refs. 65, 69, 73), would
  alter the balance toward excessive complement activation and thereby could enhance
  tissue damage. Not shown in this diagram is that properdin stabilizes (positive
  regulator) the alternative pathway C3 convertase, increasing its half-life up to
  10-fold (20–30 seconds to 3–4 minutes). Reprinted with permission from Seddon JM,
