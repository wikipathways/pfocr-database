caption: 'Role of PHLPP in terminating oncogenic signaling pathways. PHLPP (red) directly
  dephosphorylates and inactivates Akt, PKC, and S6K, thus opposing cell survival
  and proliferation signals, and directly dephosphorylates and activates Mst1, thus
  promoting pro-apoptotic signals. Indicated are two negative feedback loops: high
  Akt activity up-regulates PHLPP levels by suppressing GSK-3-dependent degradation,
  and high S6K activity up-regulates PHLPP expression. Note that targeting the PI3K
  pathway within these feedback loops will have the consequence of decreasing PHLPP
  levels, thus promoting prosurvival pathways mediated by PKC and inhibiting pro-apoptotic
  pathways mediated by Mst1. Protein kinases are shown in green, and tumor suppressors
  are shown in red (the lipid phosphatase PTEN, which opposes the lipid kinase PI3K,
  and the protein phosphatase PHLPP, which controls the indicated protein kinases).
  RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.'
