caption: illustrates the possible mechanisms that underlie VIP’s actions in SCN neurons.
  In all cases, we expect that VIP would activate VPAC2R to stimulate the AC/PKA signaling
  pathway. This VIP-activated cascade has at least three actions within the SCN including
  modulation of intrinsic voltage gated channels, presynaptic regulation of GABA release,
  and alterations in transcription via CREB.
