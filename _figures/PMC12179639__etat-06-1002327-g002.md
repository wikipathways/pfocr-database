caption: Interactions between the PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), fibroblast
  growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) pathways, and chemokines. (A) Activation of the
  FGF/FGFR signaling pathway has been shown to upregulate PD-1 expression on effector
  T cells, while simultaneously suppressing the secretion of key cytotoxic mediators
  such as interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and granzyme B (GZMB). This dual effect contributes
  to diminished T cell-mediated antitumor immune responses, highlighting a potential
  mechanism of immune evasion in FGFR-driven tumors. In addition, FGFR1 activation
  facilitates macrophage recruitment to the tumor microenvironment by inducing the
  expression of the chemokine CX3CL1, thereby contributing to an immunosuppressive
  milieu that supports tumor progression; (B) FGF/FGFR signaling has been shown to
  suppress IFN-induced immune activation by downregulating the expression of MHC class
  I molecules, PD-L1, and the chemokine CXCL10. This immunosuppressive effect is mediated,
  in part, through the induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), which
  interferes with downstream IFN signaling. Conversely, FGF/FGFR signaling can also
  enhance PD-L1 expression via alternative pro-tumorigenic pathways. Specifically,
  activation of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade leads to transcriptional upregulation
  of PD-L1, while concurrent stimulation of the Hippo pathway effector YAP further
  promotes PD-L1 transcription. Together, these mechanisms contribute to tumor immune
  evasion by inhibiting antigen presentation and suppressing effector T cell recruitment
  and function. Conversely, FGFR1 signaling has also been implicated in the post-translational
  regulation of PD-L1 stability. Specifically, FGFR1 promotes the phosphorylation
  of the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, which in turn facilitates the ubiquitin-mediated
  proteasomal degradation of PD-L1. This mechanism may act as a counterbalance to
  transcriptional upregulation pathways, potentially modulating PD-L1 expression levels
  in a context-dependent manner and influencing tumor immune escape dynamics
