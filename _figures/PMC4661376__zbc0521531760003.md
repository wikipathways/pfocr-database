caption: Actin signaling pathways and their association with brain disorders. Shown
  is a schematic of proteins involved in regulating the spine actin cytoskeleton.
  The synaptic actin cytoskeleton is a common pathway in which mutations are associated
  with increased risk for brain disorders. Each protein highlighted by yellow stars
  has a genetic mutation associated with ID, SZ, or ASD, each of which are indicated
  in parentheses. Finally, the dashed lines surrounding the Arp2/3 complex and cofilin
  indicate the final points of signaling output for actin remodeling, both of which
  have been studied extensively through knock-out mouse studies. Loss of Arp2/3 complex
  activity in the mouse forebrain mimics aspects of psychiatric conditions such as
  schizophrenia-related disorders, whereas loss of cofilin is associated with decreased
  anxiety in mice. ROCK, Rho-associated kinase.
