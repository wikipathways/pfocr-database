caption: 'Example of an application of CAR Tregs in transplantation of HLA mismatched
  donor and recipients: HLA-A2 CAR Tregs can recognize the HLA-A2, which is expressed
  on donor APCs as well as donor graft cells or epithelial cells via the direct pathway
  of allorecognition. If the HLA-A2 is integrated into recipient APCs, the CAR Tregs
  can recognize the antigen as well (semi-direct pathway). Similarly, the application
  of a CAR targeting a class II MHC (DR Treg) directs the Treg to the antigen via
  the direct and indirect pathways: CAR Tregs recognize the antigen on donor APCs
  and endothelial cells and recipient APCs.'
