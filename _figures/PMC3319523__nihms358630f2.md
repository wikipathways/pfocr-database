caption: 'Growing evidence suggests that pathogenic mycobacteria rely on lipids in
  vivo. Degradation of fatty acids by β-oxidation leads to acetyl-CoA (C2) and for
  uneven chain length or methyl-branched fatty acids additionally to propionyl-CoA
  (C3). The pathogen can directly metabolize C2 units via the tricarboxcylic acid
  (TCA) cycle while excessive accumulation of toxic propionyl-CoA is prevented by
  two metabolic routes: (1) the methylcitrate cycle and (2) the methylmalonyl pathway.
  The products of both pathways can enter the TCA cycle, either directly (succinate)
  or after conversion to succinyl-CoA (methylmalonyl-CoA). Moreover, methylmalonyl-CoA
  is a building block of methyl-branched lipids. Mycobacterial isocitrate lyase (Icl)
  plays a key role in the methylcitrate cycle and the glyoxylate shunt. The intermediate
  glyoxylate can be used terminally to generate pyruvate (via malate), from which
  glycolytic substrates can be replenished by gluconeogenesis. C3 bodies of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  and acetyl-CoA are required for biosynthesis of triacylglycerol, a lipid relevant
  during dormancy.'
