caption: Redox-active metals (Fe, and Cu), their oxidation states, and their implications
  in Parkinson’s disease via ROS-mediated pathway. Fe exists in three oxidation states,
  namely, Fe+2, Fe+3, and Fe+4. On the other hand, Cu exists in two oxidation states,
  namely, Cu+1 and Cu+2. Escalation in the Fe and Cu levels can contribute to increased
  ROS production, which in turn culminates in increased oxidative stress, oxidation,
  aggregation and misfolding of critical protein (α-synuclein), and deterioration
  of lipids via transforming them into lipid peroxides. These processes in combination
  lead to nerve cell degeneration, and eventually culminate in Parkinson’s disease
  evolution. Fe, iron; Fe+2, ferrous Fe; Fe+3, ferric Fe; Fe+4, ferryl Fe; Cu, copper;
  Cu+1, cuprous form of Cu; Cu+2, cupric form of Cu; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  ↑, increased/elevated.
