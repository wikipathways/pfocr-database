caption: Phytotoxins and microbial effectors targeting the JA signaling components.
  Several microbes produce JA-Ile precursors or the JA-Ile mimic coronatine that are
  perceived by the JA-Ile receptor complex and induce degradation of JAZ repressors
  (see  for specific examples). HopX1 from P. syringae pv. tabaci (Pta) 11528 encodes
  a cysteine protease that associates with JAZ proteins induces their degradation
  in a proteasome- and COI1-independent manner, likely via its cysteine protease activity
  []. HopZ1a from P. syringae pv. syringae (Pss) strain A2 encodes a cysteine protease/acetyltransferase
  that acetylates several JAZ proteins and induces their degradation through an undefined
  mechanism that is dependent on COI1 []. AvrB interacts with [] and phosphorylates
  MPK4, which triggers activation of JA signaling []. AvrB also induces the degradation
  of multiple JAZ proteins by positively regulating the PM H+-ATPase AHA1 to enhance
  bacterial penetration and virulence through RIN4 []. The ectomycorrhizal MiSSP7
  effector interacts with PtJAZ6 and protects PtJAZ6 from JA-induced degradation,
  attenuating JA-dependent host defenses to promote fungal colonization and mutualism
  []. The oomycete downy mildew effector RxL44 directly interacts with the mediator
  subunit MED19a (Mediator19a), resulting in the proteasome-mediated degradation of
  MED19a, which shifts the balance of defense gene transcription from SA-responsive
  to JA/ET-mediated defense, enhancing susceptibility to biotrophs []. In all cases,
  degradation of JAZs leads to de-repression of the TFs that initiate the activation
  of JA-dependent gene expression, suppression of SA responses and plant susceptibility.
  Black arrows indicate activation of the indicated hormonal pathway. Black bars indicate
  inhibition of the indicated hormonal pathway. Dashed arrows denote indirect or unclear
  mechanism leading to the activation of the indicated hormonal pathway. A circled
  Ac indicates acetylation. A circled P indicates phosphorylation.
