caption: 'Schematic diagram of the interactions of anti-inflammatory signaling pathways
  and carotenoids. In the cytoplasm during the resting stage the NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB)
  is inactivated, which is bound to its inhibitory protein IκB (inhibitor of kappa
  B). During oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, or hypoxia, IκB protein is
  phosphorylated by the IKK (IκB kinase) complex, which leads to the ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation of IκB protein. At this time NF-κB was released which
  will migrate to the nucleus and the transcription of inflammatory mediators will
  start. It is assumed that carotenoids and their metabolites may interact with cysteine
  residues of the IKK and/or NF-κB subunits, which will inhibit the NF-κB pathway.
  In cytosol the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) is kept inactive
  by Keap1 (kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) especially by poly-ubiquitination
  and rapid degradation through the proteasome. During redox imbalance, the Keap1-Nrf2
  complex is disturbed, which leads to dissociation of Nrf2 from the complex. This
  Nrf2 migrates to the nucleus, which will induce the transcription of antioxidant
  and detoxifying enzymes, which promote cell protection. Carotenoids and their metabolites
  may interact with Keap1 by changing its physical properties. MAPK (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase) refers to a family of serine/threonine protein kinases. MAPK signaling
  cascades undergo consecutive and sequential step. MAPKs are phosphorylated and activated
  by MAPK-kinases (MAPKKs), which are further phosphorylated and activated by MAPKK-kinases
  (MAPKKKs). The MAPKKKs are in turn activated by interaction with small GTPases and/or
  other protein kinases family, which connect the MAPK module to cell surface receptors
  or external stimuli. However, it is still remains unclear how the carotenoids interact
  with the MAPK signaling pathway. COX—cyclooxygenase; GPx—glutathione peroxidase;
  GTP—guanine triphosphate; HO-1—heme oxygenase-1; IL-6—interleukin-6; iNOS—nitric
  oxide synthase 2; RAS—rat sarcoma; ROS—reactive oxygen species; SOD—superoxide dismutase;
  NQO1—NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1.'
