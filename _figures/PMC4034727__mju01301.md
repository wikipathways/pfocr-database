caption: LncRNAs associated with the p53 pathway. Like protein-coding genes such as
  MDM2, lncRNAs can serve as p53 regulators, which include MALAT1, MEG3, p53-eRNAs,
  and Wrap53. On the other hand, lncRNAs can also serve as p53 effectors, including
  lincRNA-p21, PANDA, H19, and loc285184, similar to the protein-coding gene p21.
