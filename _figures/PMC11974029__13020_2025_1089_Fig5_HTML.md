caption: Retigeric acid B effectively treats prostate cancer by modulating the MSH2
  and MSH6 enzymes involved in MMR. β-carotene exhibits therapeutic potential for
  gastric cancer by modulating Ku70 and Ku80 proteins in NHEJ. Isoorientin demonstrates
  efficacy against HCC by regulating ATM protein in HRR. Both retigeric acid B and
  β-carotene regulate the expression of relevant proteins through activation of transcription
  factors NF-κB and p53, respectively. ATM initiates the repair response by phosphorylating
  multiple target proteins including p53, BRCA1, and RAD51. On the other hand, Isoorientin
  inhibits the repair response by modulating ATM signaling pathway and reducing phosphorylation
  levels of ATM kinase, thereby impeding HCC intracellular DNA repair to achieve a
  therapeutic effect
