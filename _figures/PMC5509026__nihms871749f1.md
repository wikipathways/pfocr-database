caption: Panel A shows cGMP-dependent and independent nitric oxide (NO) signaling
  pathways. NO synthase (NOS) produces NO, which activates soluble guanylate cyclase
  (sGC) to generate the second messenger 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).
  cGMP signaling is terminated by cyclic nucleotide-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases
  (PDE). NO also exerts its actions independently of the cGMP pathway by the nitrosylation
  of sulfhydryl groups on proteins. Panel B shows denitrosylation pathways through
  the S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase (GSNOR) and thioredoxin (Trx) systems.
  GSNOR uses NADH to reduce GSNO into glutathione S-hydroxysulfenamide (GSNHOH), which
  in turn is converted to oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Reduction of GSSG by glutathione
  reductase terminates the denitrosylation reaction. Trx mediates the denitrosylation
  of S-nitrosylated proteins. Following denitrosylation, the Trx system uses Trx reductase
  and NADPH to regenerate reduced Trx. Adapted from Lima, B. et al., Circulation Research
  2010;106:633–646.
