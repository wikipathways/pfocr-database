caption: Activin and BMP signaling pathway. Schematic overview of the canonical BMP
  and TGF-β signalling pathway, which relies on SMAD proteins. The pathway begins
  with the binding of BMPR1α, TGF-βR1, ACVRL1, or ACVR1 to a heteromeric complex of
  type I receptors. These type I receptors are linked with type II receptors such
  as BMPR2, TGF-βR2, ACTR2A/2B. Inside the cell, the transcription factors SMADs,
  which respond to BMP or TGF-β, undergo phosphorylation. They then combine with co-SMAD4
  and move into the nucleus. The inhibitory SMAD6 regulates this signalling pathway
