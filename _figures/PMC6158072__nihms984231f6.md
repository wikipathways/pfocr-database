caption: 'Non-enzymatic generation of reactive lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs):
  The generation of HNE (xiii) and A2-(xvi) and J2-isoprostanes (xvii) from ω-6-FAs
  such as AA (i) is shown here. Reactive radicals such as •OH initiate lipid peroxidation
  by abstracting a bis-allylic hydrogen from AA (i). O2 addition at either C(15) or
  C(11) generates the corresponding peroxy radical (ii and viii), which abstracts
  an H radical (possibly from another AA molecule thus propagating the radical chain
  reaction) to generate the hydroperoxy intermediates 15-HpETE (iii) and 11-HpETE
  (ix), respectively. The abstraction of hydrogen at C(10) of 15-HpETE forms a radical
  intermediate which migrates to C(12), reacts with O2, yielding the dihydroperoxide
  intermediate (iv). This intermediate then undergoes Hock cleavage to yield HNE as
  one possible product. 11-HpETE is shown to first undergo a Hock cleavage to generate
  the nonenal (x), which undergoes oxygenation to yield the hydroperoxide (xii) and
  its further reduction to generate HNE (xiii). AA peroxidation also generates isoprostanes.
  The peroxy radical intermediate (viii) at C(11) can undergo cyclization, further
  oxygenation, and rearrangement to yield E2-(xiv) and D2-isoprostanes (xv). Dehydration
  of the E2- and D2-isoprostanes result in J2(xvi) and A2-isoprostanes (xvii), respectively.
  Analogous peroxidation pathway from ω-3-FA such as DHA generates HHE.'
