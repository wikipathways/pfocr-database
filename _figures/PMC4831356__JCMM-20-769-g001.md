caption: A schematic model illustrating O‐GlcNAc pathway and influence of glucose
  and O‐GlcNAcylation on chondrogenic differentiation. Glucose synthesizes UDP‐GlcNAc
  by HBP. O‐GlcNAc pathway consists of transfer and removal of O‐GlcNAc by OGT and
  OGA. Glucose decreases PKC activity with O‐GlcNAcylation by HBP, thus down‐regulating
  the expression of TGFβRII in cell pellets. The reduced TGFβRII expression results
  in decreased TGF‐β signalling upon the activation of TGF‐β ligand, further leading
  to reduced chondrogenesis.
