caption: Mechanisms of BRAF inhibitor-induced autophagy. Therapy targeting the MAPK
  pathway can induce autophagy through several pathways. One way is through direct
  activation of the MAPK→AMPK/mTOR→ULK1 signaling pathway, leading to activation of
  VPS34/Beclin1. Another way is through activation of transcription factors, such
  as TFEB or TFE3, two known master regulators of the expression of key autophagy
  genes. BRAF inhibition can also induce autophagy through activation of the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress gatekeeper GRP78, leading to the activation of ATF4 and transcription
  of ATG genes. Moreover, the tumor suppressor p53 can induce the transcription of
  several ATGs, as well as ULK1 and DRAM, resulting in upregulation of autophagy.
  In theory, MAPK-mediated ARF activation can induce p53, although whether this pathway
  is used by MAPK-inhibitor exposed cancer cells to upregulate autophagy has not been
  shown.
