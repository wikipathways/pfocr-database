caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism by which phloroglucinol prevents UVB-induced
  oxidative damage via the activation of the Nrf2/Ogg1 signaling pathway. Phloroglucinol
  induces Akt and Erk phosphorylation, and activated Akt and Erk promote Nrf2 translocation
  to the nucleus. Nrf2 binds to the Ogg1 promoter, thus increasing Ogg1 expression
  and activity, which ultimately leads to the removal of UVB-induced 8-oxoG.
