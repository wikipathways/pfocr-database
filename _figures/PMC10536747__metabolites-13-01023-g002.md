caption: A working hypothesis of differential pathways in skeletal muscle of more
  feed efficient (HE; n = 8) compared with less feed efficient (LE; n = 8) cows based
  on highly expressed differential genes from RNA sequencing. Highly expressed differential
  genes (rose box; mean read count ≥ 200; p-value ≤ 0.05; fold change ≥1.5) that were
  downregulated (red arrow) or upregulated (blue arrow) are depicted. The MAP2K3 gene
  activates the p38 MAPK pathway, which can inhibit glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)
  expression, and the HK2 gene, which encodes hexokinase (HK) is required for the
  sequestration of glucose. FABP3 encodes fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3), which
  is required for fatty acid transport. SCD encodes stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)
  and LPIN1 encodes LIPIN1, which are involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis,
  respectively. PRKAG2 encodes a subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and
  PPARD encodes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD), which are
  responsible for energy sensing and controlling fatty acid oxidation (FAO), respectively.
  The coordinated downregulation of these genes may be suggestive of reduced oxidation
  within skeletal muscle of HE cows.
