caption: 'An FXR axis can respond to changes in BA pool size or the ratio of different
  BAs and modulate the expression levels of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 via SHP activation.
  Three lncRNAs have been defined as key regulators of this pathway: a. Increased
  MEG3 expression under disease conditions leads to the degradation of SHP, thus upregulating
  Cyp7a1/Cyp8b1, which serves as a driving force to liver fibrosis or cirrhosis (green
  lines). b. By repressing the expression of Cyp7a1 and bile acid synthesis, lncHC
  prevents cholesterol catabolism and aggravates intracellular cholesterol accumulation
  (orange line). c. The depletion of liver-enriched lncLSTR antagonizes the expression
  of Cyp8b1 and engenders an increased ratio of MCA/CA. The altered bile acids activate
  FXR to increase Apoc2 levels, resulting in enhanced TG clearance in mice (blue line).'
