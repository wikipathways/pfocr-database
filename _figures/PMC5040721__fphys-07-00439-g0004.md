caption: 'Possible antagonistic effects of obesity on myocyte signaling to accelerate
  muscle atrophy. (a) Anabolic pathways: IGF signaling is the main anabolic signaling
  pathway in the myocyte. Binding of I/IGF with their receptor (IR) activates IR,
  which in turn activates AKT through successive activations of IRS, PI3K and PDK1.
  Activated AKT, then in turn activates mTOR and NF-κB as well as inhibits FOXO and
  GSK3β. mTOR is a positive regulator of muscle because it induces the synthesis of
  muscle proteins and inhibits proteolysis by activating S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1),
  whereas both FOXO and GSK3β are negative regulators of muscle because FOXO is a
  transcription factor that upregulates the transcription of E3 ubiquitin ligases
  and GSK3β inhibits both eIF2B and nebulin. Activated IR also inhibits Csp3 functioning
  through inducing the activation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1)
  and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK). Leptin signaling is another anabolic signaling pathway
  that induces muscle protein synthesis through the JAK2/STAT signaling pathway induced
  by activated leptin receptor long isoform (LEPRb). Activated JAK2 may induce I/IGF
  signaling via the activation of IRS. (b) Catabolic pathways: Binding of GC with
  GR in cytosol forms the GC-GR complex and translocates into the nucleus where it
  induces the transcription of FOXO1, Atrogin-1, and MuRF-1 through binding with the
  respective genes. GC signaling also induces the upregulation of Kruppel-like factor
  15 (KLF15), regulated in development and DNA damage responses -1 (REDD1) and pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Both KLF15 and REDD1 inhibit protein synthesis in
  muscle by sequestering mTOR and by inducing FOXO activation (by KLF15). PDK4 reduces
  glucose oxidation. IL-6 signals through the IL6R/JAK/STAT pathway and induces the
  overexpression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), a negative regulator
  of muscle. Myostatin induced activated ActRIIB signals through the SMAD2/3 dependent
  pathway and induces the expression of some proteins which downregulate the expression
  of MyoD and myogenin. Myostatin also induces the upregulation of atrogin1 and MuRF1
  through the activation of FOXO. AGE induces the expression of Csp3 through the RAGE/P38MAPK
  signaling pathway resulting in apoptosis of myocytes. The active receptor for advanced
  glycation end products (RAGE) also induces the generation of ROS by activating the
  enzyme, NADPH oxidase. This ROS can induce the expression of Bnip3 through the activation
  of FOXO, and also activates NFκB via the MAPK-JNK/p38/ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
  Ang II induced activation of ATR1 triggers the generation of ROS, which in turn
  upregulates the expression of MuRF1 via IKK/NF-κB mediated signaling and also accelerates
  proteolysis via Csp3 activation. Ang II signaling downregulates IGF signaling by
  suppressing IRS1 and also inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis. TNF-α induces the expression
  of iNOS, Murf1, and Atrogin1 through NF-κB and P38/MAPK mediated signaling pathway.
  Active TNFR also inhibits IRS via JNK activation and ultimately downregulates IGF
  signaling. Sarcomeric protein derived AMP also activates AMPK, that in turns activates
  FOXO, induces mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) oxidation to generate ROS and inhibits
  mTOR. PTEN acts as a negative regulator of I/IGF signaling by sequestering IRS.
  (c) Obesity negatively regulates the anabolic pathways and positively regulates
  the catabolic pathways, ultimately causing muscle atrophy.'
