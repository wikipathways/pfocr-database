caption: The function of miR-375 in the CRF-enhanced POMC signaling pathway. CRF increases
  the intracellular cAMP through binding CRF receptor 1, which leads to the activation
  of PKA, which in turn enhances ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels. The phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 activates NGFI-B and further promotes the transcription of POMC. Our results
  have shown that MAP3K8 mediates the CRF signal pathway through regulating ERK1/2
  phosphorylation and POMC expression. However, miR-375 functions as a negative regulator
  in this pathway by down-regulating MAP3K8 protein levels in AtT-20 cells. CRF also
  inhibits the expression of miR-375 through PKA. This pathway indicates that miR-375
  is a downstream molecule of PKA, which targets MAP3K8, and subsequently down-regulates
  ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the expression of NGFI-B. This is a novel signaling pathway
  that mediates the effect of CRF, which regulates the expression of POMC, thus regulating
  the POMC-related hormone secretion in the pituitary gland. Arrows indicate stimulation;
  T bars indicate inhibition.
