  to identify pathways altered in UC- and CD-associated CAC. Alteration frequencies
  are expressed as a percentage of CD-associated cases (left side of box) and of UC-associated
  cases (right side of box). Red denotes activated genes and blue denotes inactivated
  genes, with the brightness of these colors corresponding to the percentage of cases
  altered. Amplifications and missense mutations in recurrent positions in oncogenes
  were considered activating, and deletions, truncating mutations as well as recurrent
  missense mutations in tumor suppressor genes were considered inactivating.
