caption: Schematic description of the effects of atorvastatin on autophagy, and the
  relationship between autophagy, inflammation, and atherosclerosis progression. During
  the early stage of atherosclerosis, macrophage autophagy is intact and exerts its
  normal effects. However, when exposed to excessive ox-LDL, autophagy flux is blocked
  through mechanisms that might involve cholesterol crystal overload or lysosomal
  leakage. Impaired autophagy results in lipid accumulation and activated inflammasomes,
  both of which in turn exacerbate atherosclerosis. Meanwhile, atorvastatin could
  upregulate autophagic activity through the mTOR pathway to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation and alleviate lipid deposition, subsequently mitigate inflammation and
  stabilizing vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques.
