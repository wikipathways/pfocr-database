caption: Fulvestrant predominant metabolic pathway. The major metabolite of fulvestrant,
  fulvestrant-3-sulfate conjugate, is highlighted in red. Fulvestrant glucuronidation
  at the 3-hydroxyl position and sulfate conjugation produces sulfated-fulvestrant,
  specifically the metabolite fulvestrant-3-sulfate conjugate. Another metabolite
  of fulvestrant, fulvestrant-17-sulfate conjugate, is also shown and is produced
  via fulvestrant glucuronidation at the −17 position and through sulfate conjugation.
  The 1A UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme family are involved in the metabolism
  of fulvestrant. The majority of fulvestrant is metabolized via UGT1A3 and UGT1A4
  enzymes, which catalyze the glucuronidation of fulvestrant at the 3-hydroxyl position.
  UGT1A1 and UGT1A8 were also found to also play a minor role in the glucuronidation
  of fulvestrant. Further, fulvestrant can be converted to fulvestrant-17-glucuronide
  through the UGT1A8 enzyme. Fulvestrant is sulfated by sulfotransferase enzymes,
  namely SULT1A1, to produce sulfated-fulvestrant (153–155)
