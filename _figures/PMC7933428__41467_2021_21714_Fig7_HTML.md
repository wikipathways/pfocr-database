  active catalytic sites of CNPs for the next cycle of catalysis. However, the decomposition
  of H2O2 can be inhibited by excessive H+, and the surface-absorbed H2O2, in turn,
  disrupts the re-exposure of active catalytic sites, and thus blocks the antioxidant
  cycles. b In the kidney of tumor-bearing mice, CNPs scavenge the excessive chemotherapeutics-induced
  ROS by decomposing H2O2 and activating the Nrf2/Keap1 signal pathway, restoring
  the balance between antioxidant production and antioxidant depletion for satisfactory
  kidney protection. c Once CNPs accumulate in tumor tissues, the acidic tumor microenvironment
  suppresses their ROS scavenging capability, thus without causing interference with
  the chemotherapeutic efficiency.
