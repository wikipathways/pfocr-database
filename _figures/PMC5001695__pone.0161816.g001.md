caption: 'Red numbers indicate anaplerotic pathways, that can refill the levels of
  C4 intermediates of the cycle: 1 pyruvate carboxylase (mostly in CNS), 2 propionyl-CoA
  carboxylase, and 3 glutamic pyruvic transaminases (very important in muscle). C5
  ketones, branched chain amino acids and heptanoate, are metabolized to propionyl-CoA
  and can therefore be anaplerotic via the propionyl-CoA carboxylation pathway. OAA–oxaloacetate,
  2-OG– 2-oxoglutarate, Ile–isoleucine, Val—valine.'
