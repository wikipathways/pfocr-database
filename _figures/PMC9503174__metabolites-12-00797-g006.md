caption: Intermediates of the phenylalanine/L-tyrosine pathway by human cells and
  gut bacteria, leading also to the formation of 4-ethylphenol sulfate (4-EPS) and
  p-cresol. are presented as the differences between autistic subjects in red and
  typically-developing siblings in green. The columns represent the mean ± SD (n =
  14) of each metabolite concentration. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, etabolites derived
  from bacterial degradation are boxed in green, metabolites from human cell production
  in blue. Solid lines represent established reactions, dotted lines represent presumed
  reactions taking place.
