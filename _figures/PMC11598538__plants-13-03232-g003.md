caption: Overview of metabolites and DEGs in the biosynthesis pathways of fatty acid
  derivative and terpenoid in Oncidium Twinkle ‘Red Fantasy’. (a) The DEGs of Cluster
  6 were enriched in the fatty acid derivative biosynthesis pathway. 9-lipoxygenase
  (9-LOX), 13-lipoxygenase (13-LOX), 9-hydroperoxide lyase (9-HPL), 13-hydroperoxide
  lyase (13-HPL), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), allene oxide synthase (AOS), and alcohol
  acyltransferase (AAT). The black dashed boxes represent genes enriched in the LOX
  pathway, and the red fonts represent differentially expressed genes. (b) The DEGs
  of Cluster 4 and Cluster 8 were enriched in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway.
  Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS),
  hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), mevalonate kinase (MVK), mevalonate
  phosphate decarboxylase (MPD), phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), isopentenyl phosphate
  kinase (IPK), mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MPDC), isopentenyl diphosphate
  isomerase (IDI), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), terpenoid synthase (TPS),
  1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase
  (DXR), 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (MCT), 4-(cytidine
  5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (CMK), 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate
  synthase (MECPS), 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase (HDS), isoprenyl
  diphosphate synthase (IDS), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), and geranyl
  diphosphate synthase (GPPS). The black dashed boxes represent genes enriched in
  the MVA and MEP pathway, and the red fonts represent differentially expressed genes
