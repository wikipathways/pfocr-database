caption: '(a,b) The principle of an allergic reaction: the IgE-primed mast cell releases
  mediators, such as histamine and several cytokines, when confronted with an allergen,
  leading to the allergic reaction (a). Mast cells have been shown to be in close
  interaction with the CNS. The vagus nerve may be a bidirectional pathway for CNS–mast
  cell communication []. In addition, contact formation of mast cells and sympathetic
  nerves were demonstrated in vitro [] (b). (c,d) Model of allergic reactions affected
  by the classical conditioning paradigm: after one or several pairings of the CS
  with the US during the acquisition phase, re-exposure to the CS during the evocation
  phase induces an allergic reaction with increased release of mediators (c). It was
  also demonstrated that anti-allergic reactions can be affected by classical conditioning.
  The exact pathways and mediators for the conditioned response are not known (d).'
