caption: The nuclear transport cycle. During nuclear import, Importins in the cytoplasm
  recognize and bind to the Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) of a target protein.
  The complex of cargo plus the Importin α/β dimer docks at the cytoplasmic side of
  the nuclear pore and is transported into the nucleus. Subsequently, Ran.GTP in the
  nucleus binds to Importin β, resulting in disassembly of the complex and releasing
  the cargo into the nuclear space. Importin α is then recycled back to the cytosol
  by the Exportin Cellular Apoptosis Susceptibility (Cas) protein via normal Ran-dependent
  export pathways (Kutay et al., ; Tekotte et al., ), while the Importin β/Ran.GTP
  complex is transported separately (Kose et al., ). Upon reaching the cytosolic side
  of the nuclear envelope, Ran.GTPase Activating Protein 1 (RanGAP1) and Ran Binding
  Proteins (RanBPs) stimulate Ran-dependent GTP hydrolysis, causing release of Importin
  β from Ran (Kutay et al., ; Lounsbury and Macara, ; Seewald et al., ). RanGAP1 is
  unable to directly affect Ran.GTP complexed with either importins or exportins,
  and instead acts via one of several Ran binding proteins (RanBPs) (Bischoff and
  Görlich, ; Floer et al., ; Kutay et al., ; Lounsbury and Macara, ). Nuclear export
  follows a similar process; Exportins such as chromosome region maintenance 1 (Crm1)
  recognize and bind to Nuclear Export Signals (NESs) on target proteins. Exportin,
  Ran.GTP, and cargo form a complex which passes out of the nucleus through the nuclear
  pore and, as described above (not shown) (Fornerod and Ohno, ; Kuersten et al.,
  ). Cytosolic Ran.GDP is transported into the nucleus, where the chromatin-bound
  Ran guanine exchange factor (RanGEF) RCC1 re-generates a pool of Ran.GTP (Ohtsubo
  et al., ; Bischoff and Ponstingl, ; Klebe et al., ). Thus, the spatial restriction
  of RanGAP1, RanBPs, and RCC1 results in a large cytoplasmic pool of Ran.GDP and
  a large nuclear pool of Ran.GTP (Bischoff et al., ; Klebe et al., ).
