caption: 'Mechanisms of TANs promoting the growth, proliferation and metastasis of
  breast cancer. TANs promotes the growth and proliferation of breast cancer: The
  release of ROS and RNS by TANs can induce DNA damage in infiltrating cells within
  the TME, leading to a significant increase in genomic instability and thereby elevating
  the risk of breast cancer development. When the body is in a chronic inflammatory
  state, it activates NOX2 in neutrophils, further amplifying the production of ROS/RNS,
  thus forming a cancer-promoting vicious cycle. HS and CSG induce PKR involvement
  via the TLR4 signaling pathway, promoting the secretion of APRIL by TANs, which
  stimulates the proliferation and growth of human breast cancer cells. Additionally,
  TANs can enhance breast cancer cell proliferation through the secretion of TFR-related
  factors. TANs promotes angiogenesis in breast cancer: TANs degrade the extracellular
  matrix by secreting MMP-9, thereby releasing and activating VEGF. Concurrently,
  TANs produce the pro-angiogenic factor PK2 (Prokineticin-2/Bv8), promoting angiogenesis.
  The hypoxic tumor microenvironment activates HIF-1α, upregulating VEGF expression.
  Breast cancer cells further amplify the VEGF signaling pathway through the LCN-2-mediated
  ERK/HIF-1α pathway. TANs promotes metastasis of breast cancer: High expression of
  LIN28B in breast cancer patients’ tumors recruits TANs to the lungs, establishing
  an immunosuppressive PMN that promotes breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. TANs
  secrete TIMP-1 to promote EMT in cancer cells, while EMT cells reciprocally enhance
  TAN activity through the Thy-1 signaling pathway, forming a pro-metastatic vicious
  cycle. Additionally, ALOX5 metabolites, LTs, selectively expand cancer cell populations
  with high tumorigenic potential, thereby improving the success rate of distant colonization.
  Anti-immune effect of TANs: TANs directly suppress the activity of CD8+ T cells
  and induce their functional exhaustion through the secretion of PD-L1. Additionally,
  TANs form a multicellular regulatory network with γδ T cells and macrophages, which
  drives the expansion of TANs via the IL-1β-IL-17 cascade and enhances their inhibitory
  effects on CD8+ T cells. Pro-tumor effects of NETs in breast cancer: NETs are highly
  enriched in breast cancer lung metastases, accelerating the awakening of dormant
  tumor cells and metastatic dissemination by promoting the formation of PMNs. Breast
  cancer cells secrete CTSC, which induces ROS and NET production in neutrophils through
  the CTSC-PR3-IL-1β axis, leading to THBS1 degradation, reduced endothelial cell
  adhesion, and ultimately promoting lung metastasis. ROS, Reactive Oxygen Species;
