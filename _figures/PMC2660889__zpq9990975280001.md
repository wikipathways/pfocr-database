caption: The biosynthetic pathway of vitamin K in E. coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC
  6803. The E. coli Men enzymes and the protein number of their orthologs in Synechocystis
  (brackets) corresponding to each known step are indicated. MenF, isochorismate synthase;
  MenD, SEPHCHC synthase; MenH, SHCHC synthase (note that this enzyme is currently
  mis-annotated in most databases as DHNA-CoA thioesterase); MenC, OSB synthase; MenE,
  OSB-CoA ligase; MenB, DHNA synthase; MenA, DHNA prenyltransferase; MenG, demethylmenaquinone/demethylphylloquinone
  methyltransferase. SEPHCHC, 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic
  acid; SHCHC, (1R,6R)-2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylic acid.
papertitle: A dedicated thioesterase of the Hotdog-fold family is required for the
  biosynthesis of the naphthoquinone ring of vitamin K1.
