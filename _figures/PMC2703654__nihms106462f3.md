caption: '(A) The VSRs P19, encoded by Cymbidium ringspot virus, and B2, encoded by
  flock-house virus, both bind dsRNA but with very different structural requirements.
  P19 acts as a head-to-tail homodimer that binds to and specifically measures 21
  bp duplexes that are the products of DCL4. In contrast, B2 forms a four-helix bundle
  that binds to one face of an A-form RNA duplex, independent of its length. P19 in
  complex with siRNA, reprinted by permission from MacMillan Publishers Ltd: Nature
  (98), copyright 2003, and B2 in complex with dsRNA, adapted by permission from MacMillan
  Publisher Ltd: Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. (109), copyright 2005.(B) Inhibition of DCL4
  by the P38 VSR of Turnip crinkle virus reveals the redundant antiviral function
  of DCL2 which generates 22 nucleotide instead of 21 nucleotide viRNAs in Turnip
  crinkle virus-infected Arabidopsis. The antiviral activity of DCL2-dependent viRNAs
  is in turn further compromised by P38, possibly through inhibition of AGO1.(C) Transgenically
  expressed VSRs interfere with the Arabidopsis DCL1-dependent miRNA pathway. In contrast
  to the genetic interactions in , these interactions are likely to be physical. VSRs
  may interfere both with developmental programs mediated by transcription factors
  (TF) and innate immune pathways negatively regulated by suppressors of defense (SD).(D)
  Both wild-type Cucumber mosaic virus (middle) and a version lacking the VSR 2b (CMV-Δ2b,
  left) induce similarly severe stunting symptoms in dcl2/dcl4 double mutant plants,
  demonstrating that the VSR is dispensable for infection and disease induction in
  a host defective in small RNA-directed immunity (). Image courtesy of R. Lu.'
