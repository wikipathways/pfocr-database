caption: Mechanism of gastric cancer induced by HP. The virulence of HP was expressed
  through various pathogenic markers, such as CagA, VacA. VacA and CagA could regulate
  each other. CagA induced c-Met phosphorylation, triggered PI3K/Akt signaling, and
  caused β-catenin accumulation. VacA induced EGFR phosphorylation and activated PI3K/Akt
  pathway. In HP infection, the intracellular pathway initiated by EGFR and c-Met
  converges to PI3K//AKT-GSK3β−−β catenin. Due to promoter methylation, the Wnt/β-catenin
  repressor TFF1 and RUNX3 were often down-regulated, and RUNX3 was also associated
  with CagA. TFF1 inhibited Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation through PP2A, and then reduced
  β-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF transcription activity. HP infection recruited
  macrophages via MCP-1or Shh. These macrophages produced pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  such as TNF-α,which could activate Wnt/βcatenin via Akt-GSK3β signaling in GC. This
  fig was made by Figdraw. CagA, cytotoxin-associated gene A; VacA, vacuolating cytotoxin
  A; TFF1, Trefoil factor 1; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; Shh, Sonic Hedgehog.
