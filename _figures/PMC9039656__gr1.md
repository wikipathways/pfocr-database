caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways of nicotine, other tobacco alkaloids, and anthocyanin
  and their regulations. A, the biosynthetic pathway of Arabidopsis anthocyanin from
  the step catalyzed by CHS. PAP1, TT8, and TTG1 encode MYB75, bHLH, and WD40 to form
  a MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex that activates late pathway genes. Gene abbreviations are
  CHS and CHI: chalcone synthase and isomerase, F3H: flavonone-3-hydroxylase, F3′H
  and F3′5′H: flavonoid-3′-hydroxylase and 3′5′hydroxylase, DFR: dihydroflavonol reductase,
  ANS: anthocyanidin synthase, 3-GT: glycosyltransferase. ANR encodes anthocyanidin
  reductase, a key enzyme toward proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. B, the biosynthetic
  pathway of nicotine, nornicotine, and tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) and
  the regulation mechanism. MYC2 and ERF are two positive transcription factors that
  activate the expression of most pathway genes. In the absence of isoleucine-jasmonate
  (Ile-JA), NtJAZ1 and NtJAZ3 repressors bind to MYC2 to inhibit the activation of
  the pathway genes (red lines). In the presence of bioactive Ile-JA (green arrows),
  SCFCOI1 perceives this plant hormone to form a new JA-SCFCOI1 complex to bind to
  NtJAZs and lead them to proteasomal ubiquitination. The degradation of NtJAZs releases
  MYC2 to activate pathway gene expression toward the biosynthesis of nicotine. Gene
  abbreviations are AO: aspartate oxidase, QS: quinolinate synthase, QPT2: quinolinate
  phosphoribosyltransferase 2, ADC: arginine decarboxylase, AIH: agmatine iminohydrolase,
  ODC: ornithine decarboxylase, MPT1: N-methylputricine transferase 1, MPO1: methylputricine
  oxidase 1, A622: an isoflavone reductase like enzyme, BBL: berberine bridge enzyme-like
  protein, and NND: nicotine N-demethylase.'
