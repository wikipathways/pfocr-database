caption: Under interaction of 2-AG with an unknown target in sensory neurons, multiple
  signaling mechanisms are likely to converge on activation of the IIS pathway and
  inhibition of DAF-16/FOXO. Signaling through the DAF-2 insulin receptor has several
  functions and could be involved in modulation of the intracellular traffic of cholesterol.
  The interaction of SBP-1 with the IIS pathway remains to be established, but is
  likely that such interaction is essential for 2-AG-dependent mobilization of cholesterol.
  For more details see the text.
