caption: Cell cycle-dependent regulation of E2F1. (A) It is hypothesized that the
  E2F1–DP1 heterodimer can mediate proliferation versus apoptosis depending on the
  cellular levels of E2F1 and its post-translational modifications. Upon mitogenic
  stimulation binding of pRB is reduced and E2F1 can enhance transcription of cell
  cycle target genes. However, after DNA damage E2F1 is stabilized by various post-translational
  modifications and this results in transcription of pro-apoptotic target genes. (B)
  During early G1 phase E2F1 is maintained in an inactive state via interaction with
  pRB; this blocks the transcriptional activation domain of E2F1 and furthermore recruits
  HDACs and the SWI/SNF complex to actively suppress transcription from E2F1 target
  genes. Upon mitogenic stimulation, cyclin D levels are induced; cyclin D forms a
  complex with CDK4–6 that phosphorylates pRB and relieves the inhibition from HDACs
  and the SWI/SNF complex. This allows transcription of several E2F1 target genes,
  including cyclin E, to proceed. As cyclin E levels accumulate and cells progress
  toward late G1, the CDK2-cyclin E complex is formed, which hyperphosphorylates pRB
  to completely dissociate it from E2F1. Subsequently, transcription of several other
  E2F1 target genes is induced, including cyclin A and DNA replication genes. During
  late S phase E2F1 is inactivated, the DP1 binding partner is targeted for phosphorylation
  by CDK2–cyclin A, and E2F1 targeted for degradation by SKP2 and transcriptional
  repression by E2F7/8.
