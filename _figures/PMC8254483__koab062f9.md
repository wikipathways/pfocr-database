caption: Working model for the role of SR1 in regulating the dark submergence response
  by modulating the stability of WRKY33. Under normoxia, SR1 is constitutively expressed
  and SR1 is stable. WRKY33 undergoes partial degradation by SR1 to maintain dynamic
  equilibrium; WRKY33 can bind to the RAP2.2 promoter to maintain its constitutive
  expression. RAP2.2 and other members of the ERF-VII family are normally localized
  to the plasma membrane where they interact with the membrane-associated ACBP1 and
  ACBP2. Upon exposure to hypoxia induced by dark submergence, ERF-VII proteins dissociate
  from the membrane and are translocated into the nucleus to activate the expression
  of hypoxia-response genes. WRKY33 is simultaneously phosphorylated, possibly by
  MPK3/MPK6 (MPK3/6), and translocated into the nucleus to strongly activate RAP2.2
  expression. In addition, SR1 is repressed and SR1 protein is degraded by an unknown
  mechanism, ensuring the stabilization of WRKY33-P. After dark submergence is replaced
  by reoxygenation, ERF-VII proteins are degraded via the N-degron pathway while WRKY33-P
  is simultaneously degraded by the rapidly accumulated SR1.
