caption: 'Top: Steps of CMA: Substrate proteins for CMA bear a targeting motif that,
  when recognized by a cytosolic chaperone complex (1), delivers them to lysosomes.
  At the membrane, substrate proteins bind to monomeric forms of LAMP-2A (2) and drive
  their multimerization into a higher order complex required for substrate translocation
  (3). Chaperones in the lumenal side of the membrane help stabilize LAMP-2A and mediate
  substrate translocation. Right after the substrate has crossed the lysosomal membrane,
  the same chaperone disassembles LAMP-2A from the translocation complex (4), allowing
  for new cycles of binding and uptake (5). Bottom: CMA Regulation: Levels of LAMP-2A
  at the lysosomal membrane are regulated in part by de novo synthesis (a), by changes
  in its regulated degradation in discrete lipid microdomains by cathepsin A (Cath
  A) (b), and by its insertion/deinsertion from the lysosomal lumen into the membrane
  (c). Besides the increase in LAMP-2A levels, multimerization of LAMP-2A (that only
  occurs outside the lipid microdomains) is also required to enhance the activity
  of this pathway (d).'
