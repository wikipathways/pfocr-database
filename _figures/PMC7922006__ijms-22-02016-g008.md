caption: Schematic representation of the CASR-ROCK-YAP1 signaling pathway in tumor
  parathyroid cells. Stimulation of the calcium-sensing receptor with Ca2+ or R568
  through the coupling with Gα12/13 or Gαq/11 leads to activation of small GTPase
  protein RhoA, which indirectly inhibits LATS kinase activity. LATS1/2 phosphorylates
  YAP1 on highly conserved residues of serine. The phosphorylation of YAP1 promotes
  cytoplasmic retention and degradation. However, when RhoA inhibits LATS1/2, dephosphorylated
  YAP1 translocates into the nucleus, where it binds and activates TEAD transcription
  factors, inducing the expression of multiple genes. Part of this figure was created
