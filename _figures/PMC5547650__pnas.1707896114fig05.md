caption: A model of the pathway involved in melanin formation and larval pigmentation.
  (A) A model of melanin formation through the Spz-3/Toll-8 pathway of the B. mori
  larval epidermis. Spz-3 may activate Toll-8 and up-regulate the yellow expression
  in the pigmented area (red letters). (B) Antimicrobial peptide expression through
  the Spz/Toll signaling pathway and melanin formation through the prophenol oxidase
  (pro-PO) pathway in the innate immunity in insects (based on refs. , , and ). Factors
  with asterisks (HP14 and HP6) are known to be involved in these two pathways in
  M. sexta, but it is not clear whether these factors are conserved among insects.
  Broken lines indicate uncertified pathways. Green letters indicate enzymes involved
  in melanin synthesis. AMP, antimicrobial peptide; βGRP, β-1,3-glucan recognition
  protein; Lys-PG, lysine-containing peptidoglycan; PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition
  proteins; PO, phenol oxidase; Pro-HP, precursor of hemolymph protease; Pro-PO, precursor
  of phenol oxidase.
