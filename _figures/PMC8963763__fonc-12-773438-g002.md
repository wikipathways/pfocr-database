caption: (A) KEGG analysis. Signaling pathways with a p < 0.05 as subject of regulation
  by the methylated/unmethylated genes. The dot size is according to number of the
  related genes for each pathway. The color of the dots is represented by the range
  of colors from blue to red depending of the p-value. (B) The PI3K-AKT pathway, where
  blue represents hypomethylated genes and red represents hypermethylated genes.
