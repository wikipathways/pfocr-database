caption: The red arrows represent LPS-induced NF-κB signaling and Wnt ligand expression,
  and the blue arrows represent Wnt/β-catenin signaling along with its crosstalk with
  NF-κB signaling, both of which were observed in this study. The violet arrow represents
  cytokine-induced NF-κB pathway activation, which has been reported in previous studies.
  LGK974 exerts a suppressive effect on endotoxemia by suppressing the upregulation
  of β-catenin and β-TrCP as well as their interactions with NF-κB and phospho-IκB,
  respectively.
