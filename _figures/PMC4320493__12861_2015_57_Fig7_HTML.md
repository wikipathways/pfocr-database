caption: Proposed model of the distinct features of Hh signal transduction in insect,
  fish and mammal. fu is expressed in a Hedgehog-dependent fashion and is also one
  of the components of the Hedgehog pathway in fish. Fused negatively regulates Suppressor
  of Fused (SuFu), which is a negative regulator of Gli/Ci in Hh signaling. The transcription
  of fused in fish could lead to Hh activation. This positive-feedback loop amplifies
  Hedgehog pathway in fish downstream of cilia.
