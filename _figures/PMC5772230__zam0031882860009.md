caption: 'Model of d-xylose and l-arabinose transport and metabolism in S. acidocaldarius
  MW001. The ABC transporter consists of the SBD Saci_2122 XylF (purple), the TMD
  Saci_2121 XylH (orange), and the NBD Saci_2120 XylG (green) and transports d-xylose
  and l-arabinose into the cell. An additional unknown transporter can import pentoses
  in the presence of peptides. Within the cells, these pentose sugars were shown to
  be degraded via the aldolase-independent Weimberg pathway to α-ketoglutarate, which
  enters the citric acid cycle. Conversely, the aldolase-dependent Dahms pathway converting
  the pentoses to pyruvate and glycolaldehyde (entering the citric acid cycle via
  glyoxylate) is not utilized under the chosen growth conditions. Enzymes transcriptionally
  upregulated on d-xylose are in blue, and stars mark promiscuous enzymes, which function
  simultaneously in hexose and pentose metabolism. Abbreviations: GDH-1, glucose dehydrogenase
  (isoenzyme 1); d-XAD/l-AraD, xylonate/arabinoate dehydratase; d-KDXD/l-KDAD, 2-keto-3-deoxy-xylonate/arabinoate
  dehydratase; α-KGSADH, α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase.'
