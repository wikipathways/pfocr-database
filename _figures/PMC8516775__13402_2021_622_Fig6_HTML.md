caption: FXR/SNAI2/miR-1 signaling pathway promotes BA-induced gastric IM. Under the
  stimulation of bile acids, enhanced FXR gene expression increases the expression
  of SNAI2, which in turn decreases the inhibitory effect of miR-1 on HDAC6 and HNF4α
  expression. Upregulated HDAC6 and HNF4α interact with each other, which further
  promotes upregulation of CDX2, KLF4 and MUC2, thereby promoting gastric IM development
