caption: Several candidate susceptibility genes converge on NMDAR complexes either
  in ligand mediated mechanisms (pre-receptor) or in post-receptor protein interactions.
  Dysbindin 1 modulates glutamate release, DAAO and G72 regulate D-serine and thus
  alter NMDAR activation. These dysregulations originating from ligand mediated processes
  will lead to altered associations between NMDARs and their signaling partners; PLCγ
  nNOS and PKC and others. Note that associations of NMDAR1 with PLCγ, nNOS and CAMKII
  were found to be decreased in the postmortem brains of schizophrenia patients (see
  downward arrows). ErbB4, DISC1 and dysbindin 1 could also directly impact on protein
  associations in the NMDAR complexes; ErbB4 via PSD-95, DISC1 via AKAP9 or Actinin
  and dysbindin 1 via sec8. Thus, alterations in the susceptibility genes and their
  pathways, via ligand mediated or post-receptor mechanisms, can converge on protein
  associations within the NMDAR complexes. It is of note that there are numerous potential
  protein-protein interactions in NMDAR complexes that might be associated with various
  psychiatric illnesses []. This diagram represents a permutation of numerous possible
  arrangements.
