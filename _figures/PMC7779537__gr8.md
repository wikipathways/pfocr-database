  mechanisms by which aberrant aberrant elevation elevation of GDF8 impairs impairs
  granulosagranulosa-lutein lutein cell cell glucose glucose metabolismmetabolismNormally,
  the GDF8 expression is decreased after LH surge and maintained at a low level in
  follicular fluid to guarantee the successful ovulation. However, aberrantly increased
  GDF8 is present in PCOS women with IR during ovulation and impairs the granulosa
  cell glucose metabolism by increasing the production of SERPINE1, which leads to
  the defect of oocyte development and consequently causes ovulation disorder in PCOS
  women. GDF8 acts on hGL cells by binding to type I receptor ALK5 and activating
  the downstream SMAD2/3-SMAD4 signaling pathway, with an attempt to regulate SERPINE1
  expression. Additionally, TP53 interacts with SMAD2/3-SMAD4 complex and mediates
  GDF8-induced upregulation of SERPINE1 in granulosa cells. hGL: human granulosa-lutein;
  ALK5: , transforming growth factor β receptor 1; hGL, human granulosa-lutein.'
