caption: Schematic diagram of ROS/Akt/p38 MAPK signaling pathway in COM crystals-induced
  tight junction disruption. COM crystals stimulate the generation of ROS, which activate
  the phosphorylation of Akt. Akt in turn activates ASK1 by phosphorylating ASK1 on
  Thr838 that further triggers p38 MAPK activation, leading to the disruption of tight
  junction in MDCK cells.
