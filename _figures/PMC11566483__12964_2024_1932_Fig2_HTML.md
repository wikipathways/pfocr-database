caption: Mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome construction and activation. Priming signals
  (left) are provided by the activation of cytokines or PAMPs, which activate the
  NF-κB signaling pathway, further leading to the transcriptional upregulation of
  NLRP3 inflammasome components. Activation signals (right) are induced by multiple
  PAMPs or DAMPs, such as crystals and ATP, which activate multiple upstream signaling
  events. The canonical activation pathways include ion flux (K + efflux, Ca + influx),
  lysosomal disruption, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production,
  and Golgi disassembly. The serine/threonine protein kinase NEK7 senses K + efflux
  and binds to NLRP3, promoting its activation. Inflammasome formation activates caspase-1,
  which cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. The nonclassical pathway involves the detection
  of cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), where caspase-4/5/11 are activated and
  cleave GSDMD, triggering cellular pyroptosis
