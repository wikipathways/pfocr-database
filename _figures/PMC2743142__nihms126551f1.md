caption: De novo ceramide synthesis begins with the conversion of serine and fatty
  acyl CoA into 3-ketosphinganine by serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), then 3-ketosphinganine
  is converted into dihydrosphingosine. Myriocin is a potent inhibitor of SPT activity.
  (Dihydro) ceramide synthase (LASS/CerS) acylates dihydrosphingosine to form dihydroceramide,
  which is then reduced to ceramide by dihydroceramide desaturase. Ceramide is also
  produced by sphingomyelinases (SMases) through sphingomyelin (SM) degradation in
  sphingomyelinase pathway. Ceramidase converts ceramide into sphingosine, which is
  phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase (SK) to generate sphingosine-1-phosphate. Ceramide
  is phosphorylated by ceramide kinase (CK) yielding ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P). In
  the salvage or recycling pathway, complex sphingolipids are broken down to ceramide
  by β-glucosidase and then by ceramidase to sphingosine, which is re-acylated to
  ceramide by LASS/CerS. Fumonisin B1 inhibits LASS/CerS activity.
