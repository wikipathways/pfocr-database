caption: '(a) Complement involvement in glomerular diseases is multiform: (i) deposition
  of complement (mainly C3) degradation products in glomeruli; (ii) activation by
  Igs and immune complexes deposited in glomeruli of the classical and/or the lectin
  pathway; (iii) C5-driven glomerular inflammatory changes; and (iv) complement-induced
  noninflammatory endothelial cell damage in complement-mediated renal thrombotic
  microangiopathy. The extent and weight of complement involvement are variable among
  distinct glomerular diseases (inset). (b) Complement activation also potentially
  contributes to kidney tubular and interstitial damage. This activation involves:
  (i) filtered (increased permeability of the glomerular basement membrane) or leaked
  (increased permeability of the peritubular capillaries) circulating complement components
  or (ii) locally synthetized ones. Hypoxia and ischemia/reperfusion in the kidney
  triggers complement activation through the induction of Fut2, the ensuing abnormal
  fucosylation of (mainly proximal) tubular cells, which activates MASP2 (lectin pathway)
  via CL-11.,, Hypoxia and ischemia/reperfusion also induces the synthesis of factor
  B (FB) and C3 by tubular cells, while potentially decreasing the expression of the
  inhibitory FH and MCP., After C3 activation, properdin provides a docking platform
  for tC3b and the C3 convertase assembly at the surface of the tubular cells, promoting
  the formation of the MAC. C3a binds to its receptor at the surface of the tubular
  cells, activates AKT and β-catenin pathway, and increases the secretion of versican
  that promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and interstitial fibrosis. Similarly,
  C3a and C5a recruit inflammatory cells in the interstitium, which contributes to
  the development of interstitial fibrosis. Heme, which is released in the circulation
  during hemolysis and rhabdomyolysis, is filtered by the glomeruli and can directly
  activate C3 in the tubular lumen. Besides, proteinuria, a hallmark of glomerular
  diseases, inhibits the fixation of FH at the surface of the tubular cells, hence
  amplifying local complement activation. Finally, tubular apoptotic cells (notably
  after injury) are cleared via the activation of the classical complement pathway.
