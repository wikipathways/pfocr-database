caption: Proposed model illustrating MAD2B deficiency alleviates podocyte injury through
  regulating Numb-dependent Notch1 pathway in diabetic nephropathy. Under hyperglycemic
  conditions, upregulation of MAD2B enhances the activity of Notch 1 signaling by
  decreasing the expression of Numb, which finally results in podocyte injury. Podocyte-specific
  MAD2B deletion leads to the increased expression of Numb, thereby inhibiting Notch
  1 signaling and alleviating podocyte injury.
