caption: Effects of MEHTCMPs on intestinal flora. ⊥ represents inhibition and → represents
  promotion. Pharmacophore-derived herbal polysaccharides inhibited the activation
  of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway by increasing the number of intestinal
  probiotics and inhibiting the growth of harmful flora, in order to reduce the secretion
  of inflammatory factors in the intestinal tract. SCFAs are one of the important
  sources of energy in the body, and they can promote intestinal motility and regulate
  the intestinal pH value, etc. Pharmacophore-derived herbal polysaccharides inhibited
  the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway by increasing the production
  of SCFAs, thus increasing the expression of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 to repair
  the damaged intestinal barrier and maintain the physical barrier between cells to
  exert anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, the polysaccharides of medicinal
  herbs can increase the expression of miR-433-3p and indirectly inhibit the activation
  of MAPK, thus suppressing the release of inflammatory factors. By Figdraw2.0
