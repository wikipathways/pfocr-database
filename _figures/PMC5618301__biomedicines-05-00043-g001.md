caption: 'Aspirin modulation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathway. (Left)
  The NF-κB transcription factor, most commonly a hetero-dimer of the RelA (p65) and
  p50 polypeptides, is held in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein IκB. When the
  cell is stimulated by growth factors or cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1) or
  tumour necrosis factor (TNF)), IκB is phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex,
  which targets it for degradation by the proteasome. This allows NF-κB to translocate
  to the nucleus and regulate expression of target genes. In cancer cells, NF-κB is
  constitutively active which drives tumour progression. Short pre-treatment with
  aspirin or related non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) blocks cytokine-mediated
  activation of the pathway by inhibiting the IKK complex, particularly IKKβ; T bar:
  NSAIDs inhibit IKK kinase activity. IL-1R: IL-1 receptor; TNFR: TNF receptor; NEMO
  (IKKγ); (Right) In contrast, prolonged exposure to NSAIDs in the absence of additional
  NF-κB activators stimulates degradation of IκB and nuclear translocation of NF-κB.
  This NF-κB recruits specific complexes which lead to repression of NF-κB-driven
  transcription and the induction of apoptosis. Dotted lines: It remains unclear whether
  the IKK complex plays a role in the stimulatory pathway or whether NSAIDs target
  IκB by another pathway.'
