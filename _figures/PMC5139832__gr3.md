caption: Differentially expressed genes between young and aged tibiae are significantly
  enriched for ECM-receptor interactions, TCA cycle and cell cycle pathway components.
  KEGG pathway analysis was performed on differentially expressed genes. Significantly
  enriched pathways related to A) ECM-receptor interactions linked to a “Hypertrophic
  Cardiomyopathy” (HCM) pathway, B) TCA cycle and C) the cell cycle. Green = up-regulated,
  red = down-regulated in tibiae from aged relative to young mice.
papertitle: Old age and the associated impairment of bones' adaptation to loading
  are associated with transcriptomic changes in cellular metabolism, cell-matrix interactions
  and the cell cycle.
