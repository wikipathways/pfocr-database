caption: 'Pathways of macro-autophagy. Initiation of autophagy is regulated by mTORC1
  (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) and AMPK (AMP-activated kinase). Together,
  they regulate the activity of the ULK1/2 complex consisting of ULK1/2 (Unc-51 like
  autophagy activating kinase), FIP200 (FAK family kinase interacting protein of 200
  kDa) and the autophagy related proteins (ATG) ATG13 and ATG10. Activation of mTOR
  leads to the phosphorylation of this complex and inhibition of autophagy (for instance,
  through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ Protein kinase B (AKT) or the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk)
  1/2 signalling pathway) whereas activation of AMPK activates autophagy. AMPK, activated
  upon intracellular AMP increase, is able to activate autophagy by inhibition of
  the mTORC1 through dissociation of mTORC1 from ULK1/2 allowing ULK1/2 to be activated.
  AMPK, is also able to initiate autophagy in a direct way by phosphorylation of ULK1/2
  forming the ULK1/2-complex.Another complex involved in the initiation is the autophagy
  inducible beclin-1 complex (or class III PI3K complex) which consists of Vps34 (phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase), beclin-1 (a BH3 only domain protein member of the Bcl-2 family), vps15
  and ATG14. This complex is activated by the ULK-1 complex and inhibited by Bcl-2
  and Bcl-XL. The ULK1/2 and class III PI3K complexes join to form the phagopore and
  eventually the autophagosme. This process is mediated by the ATG5-ATG12-ATG16 complex
  and the formation of phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated Light Chain (LC) 3 (LC3-II)
  facilitating elongation of the bilipid membrane to form a closed autophagosme. The
  autophagosome fuses with a lysosome and the content of the autolysosome is degenerated
  and the components are released to be reused to synthesise new proteins or to function
  as an energy source for the cell. PDK-1: pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1.'
