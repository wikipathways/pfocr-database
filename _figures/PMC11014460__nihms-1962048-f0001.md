caption: Under normoxic conditions, hydroxylation at two proline residues by prolyl
  hydroxylases (PHDs) promotes the association between hypoxia-inducible factor-α
  (HIFα) and the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) gene product, leading to HIFα destruction
  via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway,,. During hypoxia, this process is suppressed
  due to the lack of oxygen as a substrate for PHDs, allowing the HIFα subunit to
  escape proteolysis. After stabilization, HIFα dimerizes with HIF1β, and the heterodimer
  translocates to the nucleus to activate the transcription of target genes that contain
  hypoxia response elements (HREs) in their promoter. These target genes control essential
  physiological functions such as hypoxia adaptation, cell metabolism, inflammation,
  apoptosis and angiogenesis. Importantly, gene repression by HIFs frequently occurs
  as an indirect response that involves the transcriptional induction of HIF-dependent
  microRNAs (miRNAs) and the subsequent repression of target gene expression–. Furthermore,
  miRNAs have also been shown to participate in a feedforward pathway via an increase
  in HIF responses through PHD1 repression to provide organ protection during ischaemia–reperfusion
  injury. HIF stabilization by HIF–PHD inhibitors (such as daprodustat, dimethyloxalylglycine,
  roxadustat and vadadustat) might be a potential therapeutic approach for acute cardiovascular
  disease,. In addition, HIF activity is also regulated by hydroxylation of a single
  conserved asparaginyl residue at the C-terminal transactivation domain by the oxygen-dependent
  asparaginyl hydroxylase factor inhibiting HIF1 (FIH1). During hyperoxia, high oxygen
  levels prevent the hypoxic inhibition of PHDs during conditions such as inflammation,
  ischaemia or metabolic imbalance. Attenuated HIF stabilization can dampen adaptive
  responses, such as angiogenic responses, or cardioprotection by adenosine generation
  and signalling (for example, through decreased adenosine A2A receptor signalling).
  As such, hyperoxia is associated with attenuated adenosine production and signalling,
  abolished preconditioning of the heart, suppression of adaptive metabolic responses,
  and reduced capacity of HIFs to dampen inflammation. Of note, given that HIF–PHD
  inhibitors will still be functional in stabilizing HIFs, even during hyperoxia,
  HIF activators can be considered as a cardioprotective strategy that works independently
  of the level of oxygen therapy that a patient receives. DMOG, dimethyloxalylglycine;
  OH, hydroxylation; Ub, ubiquitination; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
