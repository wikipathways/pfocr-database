caption: 'Regulation of TGF-β responses by Egr-1 and its inhibitor. A. TGF-β binds
  to the TβR1–TβR2 complex causing activation of Smad2/3. The pSmad2/3-Smad4 complex
  then translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to Smad binding elements (SBE)
  of target genes. The coactivator p300 is recruited to the Smad complex to activate
  COL1A2 transcription. TGF-β also activates a non-Smad pathway via c-Abl which in
  turn stimulates Egr-1 via MAP kinase. Egr-1 then binds to the Egr-1 binding element
  (EBS) to further stimulate COL1A2 transcription. B: Nab2 modulates Egr-1 activity
  and TGF-β signaling. In unstimulated fibroblasts (basal state), small amounts of
  Egr-1 and Nab2 are constitutively associated with the COL1A2 promoter (left upper
  panel). During early TGF-β stimulation (30min–4h) (right upper panel), Egr-1 is
  induced and Egr-1 is recruited to the COL1A2 promoter, where it enhances histone
  H4 hyperacetylation and stimulates transcription. Sustained TGF-β stimulation (2–48h)
  (left lower panel) leads to increased Nab2 expression and its accumulation in the
  Egr-1-COL1A2 transcriptional complex, where recruitment of HDAC1 resulting in H4
  histone deacetylation and transcriptional silencing. In pathological fibrosis associated
  with constitutive Egr-1 expression (exemplified by scleroderma fibroblasts), defective
  Nab2 induction or function might results in unopposed Egr-1 signaling and target
  gene transcription (right lower panel).'
