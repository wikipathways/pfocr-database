caption: Proposed estradiol-induced hypothalamic astrocyte steroidogenesis of neuroP
  that activates a membrane classical progesterone receptor (PGR)-Src tyrosine kinase
  (Src) signaling pathway in RP3V kisspeptin neurons to trigger the luteinizing (LH)
  surge. In hypothalamic astrocytes, proestrous levels of estradiol (E2) activate
  membrane estrogen receptor-α (mERα) that complex with and signal through metabotropic
  glutamate receptor-1a type (mGluR1a). mERα-mGluR1a signals through a PKC-IP3 pathway
  to increase intracellular calcium concentrations [(Ca2+)]. This releases Ca2+ from
  the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER). Within the mitochondrion, cholesterol (CHOL)
  is converted to pregnenolone (PREG) by P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc). PREG
  is then converted to neuroprogesterone (neuroP) by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  (3β-HSD). The neuroP is secreted from the astrocytes to activate ERα-mediated, E2-induced
  PGR in RP3V kisspeptin neurons. Concurrently, E2 increases Kiss1 mRNA and kisspeptin
  expression via a mERα initiated mechanism [but see ()]. neuroP rapidly augments
  the E2-induced Kiss1 mRNA and kisspeptin expression, potentially through PGR-Src
  signaling. PGR complexes with and signals through Src to activate a MAPK pathway.
  Further, a membrane PGR can initiate signaling that increases intracellular Ca2+
  from sER stores. PGR-Src signaling also mediates the release of kisspeptin from
  neurons that project to diagonal band of Broca (DBB) GnRH neurons. Kisspeptin then
  binds to its cognate receptor, Kiss1R stimulating GnRH release into the median eminence
  that triggers the LH surge from gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary (AP). Steroid
  acute regulatory protein (StAR), translocator protein (TSPO). Modified from Micevych
  et al. ().
