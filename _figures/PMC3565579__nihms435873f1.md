caption: Proposed mechanism for opioid modulation for TLR. Morphine leads to superactivation
  of adenylyl cyclase and increase intracellular cAMP levels. cAMP activates p38MAPK
  in turn leading to CREB (cAMP response element-binding)phosphorylation and nuclear
  translocation, leading transcription of its target genes. Surface receptor (TLR4,
  TLR2) and endosomal receptors (TLR7 and TLR9) mediate through MyD88 dependent pathway.
  Upon activation of TLR 2 and 4 by their cognate ligands, MyD88 recruits IRAK4, thereby
  allowing the association of IRAK1. IRAK4 then induces the phosphorylation of IRAK1.
  TRAF6 (Tumour Necrosis Factor-Receptor-Associated Factor-6) is then recruited to
  the receptor complex, by associating with phosphorylated IRAK1. Phosphorylated IRAK1
  and TRAF6 then dissociate from the receptor to form a complex with TBK1 (TGF-Beta-Activated
  Kinase-1)- a ubiquitin ligases (Ub). This leads to the ubiquitylation of TRAF6,
  which induces the activation of TAK1. TAK1, in turn, phosphorylates p38MAPK (mitogen
  activated protein kinase). p38 phosphorylates CREB and induce the expression of
  its target genes. TAK1 also phosphorylates NEMO (nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) essential
  modulator) which having IKK complex (Inhibitor of Kappa Light Polypeptide Gene Enhancer
  in B-Cells Kinase). The IKK complex then phosphorylates I-KappaB, which leads to
  its ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. This allows NF-KappaB to translocate
  to the nucleus and induce the expression of its target genes. TRIF and TRAM link
  TLR4 to pathways that lead to TBK1 (TANK Binding Kinase-1) and IRF3 activation (i.e.,
  the MyD88-independent pathway).
