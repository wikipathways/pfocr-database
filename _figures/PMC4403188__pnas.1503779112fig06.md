caption: Model of Gαi1/3-mediated activation of TLR4 in response to LPS. (A) Distribution
  of CD14, TLR4, Gαi1, Gαi3, and Gab1 in rested macrophage. (B) LPS induces formation
  of a complex between CD14, Gαi1 and Gαi3. However, whether and how Gαi1 and Gαi3
  combine to TLR4 is not clear. Subsequently, Gαi1 and Gαi3 interact with Gab1, which
  promotes its phosphorylation by an unknown kinase. Activated Gab1 interacts with
  regulatory subunit of PI3K (p85), which leads to the activation of the catalytic
  subunit of PI3K (p110). Active PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate)
  to generate PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), which in turn interacts
  with the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt and PDK1, and PDK1 phosphorylates Akt
  on Thr308. When Akt is activated, it may phosphorylate IKKs, which further promotes
  NF-κB activation. Besides, Gαi1 and Gαi3 also involve in TLR4 endocytosis. We also
  propose that Gαi proteins may couple to the MAPK pathway. However, the exact mechanism
  merits further investigation.
