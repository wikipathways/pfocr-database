caption: MOMP-induced signaling activation in tumor cells. MOMP-dependent release
  of factors to cytosol engages various signaling pathways. 1. Cyto-c release leads
  to apoptotic caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis onset. 2. MOMP-induced
  mtDNA release activates the cGAS-STING pathway resulting in a pro-inflammatory secretory
  phenotype when apoptotic caspases are inhibited 3. Release of SMAC like molecules
  during MOMP promotes NF-κB activation. MOMP-induced TNFα can promote necroptosis
  in a context of caspase inhibition. 4. Caspase-mediated opening of pannexin-1 channels
  at the plasma membrane facilitate the release of a select subset of metabolites.
  5. Pyroptosis-induced gasdermin D (GSDME) cleavage triggers mitochondrial metabolic
  dysfunctions and subsequent ROS accumulation that in turn promotes MOMP-dependent
  apoptosis.
