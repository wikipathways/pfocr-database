caption: 'Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and TLR-mediated signaling pathway. TLR3, TLR4,
  TLR5, TLR7, and TLR9 form homodimers to deliver their signal after interacting with
  their specific ligands. TLR1 and TLR6 recognize their ligands as heterodimers with
  TLR2. TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9 are intracellular TLRs and are involved in the recognition
  of nucleic acids. TLRs, except for TLR3, deliver a signal through myeloid differentiation
  protein 88 (MyD88) pathway to activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). TLR3 and TLR4
  can signal through TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) pathway to
  activate type I interferon (IFN) response. IRF: interferon regulatory factors; TRAF:
  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; IRAK: interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase; TRAM: TRIF-related adaptor molecule; TIRAP: Toll-IL-1R domain-containing
  adapter protein.'
