caption: 'Study workflow. Moreno-Sanchez et al. methodology is represented in orange,
  whereas the methodology proposed here is represented in yellow. Boxes with a thick
  line indicate the experimental data used in this study; left box: the flux mentioned
  here refers to pathway flux titration by changing enzyme activities. The last boxes
  are the techniques used for a better understanding of the metabolic pathway. The
  five final models designed in this work are colored in black, white or grey. aSee
  “Complex Pathway SImulator (COPASI) metabolic networks” part.'
