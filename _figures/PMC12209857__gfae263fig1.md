caption: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway and mechanisms of
  inhibition. Angiotensin-II causes sodium and water retention and increased blood
  pressure through several mechanisms including arteriolar vasoconstriction, increased
  sympathetic drive, hypothalamic thirst centre stimulation, posterior pituitary anti-diuretic
  hormone release, increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption, in addition to stimulating
  adrenal aldosterone synthesis. The activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)
  is blocked by both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers. Classical
  genomic effects of aldosterone are mediated by aldosterone binding to cytoplasmic
  mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Other modulators of the MR include sodium, caveolin-1,
  and Rac-1. Rapid non-genomic effects of aldosterone are modulated by intracellular
  second messenger molecules such as protein kinase C, epidermal growth factor receptor,
  and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. The mechanism of interactions
  between genomic and non-genomic effects of aldosterone are unclear. Addition of
  MR antagonism has been shown to inhibit the effects of aldosterone, reducing albuminuria,
  risk of kidney disease progression, and heart failure hospitalization, but increases
  blood aldosterone levels. Aldosterone synthase inhibitors are an alternative method
  to target the effects of aldosterone excess
