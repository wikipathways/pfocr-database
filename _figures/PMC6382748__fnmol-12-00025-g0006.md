caption: Schematics of TDP-43-induced pathology. Several aspects of TDP-43-linked
  cellular dysfunctions have been identified in ALS, such as nuclear depletion which
  leads to aberrant RNA metabolism and a loss of autoregulation of TDP-43 levels.
  Cytoplasmic accumulation of the hyper-phosphorylated and ubiquitinated TDP-43 are
  ALS disease hallmarks. Fragmentation of TDP-43 leads to the formation of toxic and
  aggregation-prone C-terminal fragments (CTFs). TDP-43 mutations can lead to abnormal
  stress granule assembly and release. Aberrantly increased mitochondrial localization
  of TDP-43 impairs its function. TDP-43 is also associated with the misregulated
  autophagy and proteosomal processes. TDP-43 expression perturbs the endocytosis
  process possibly by altering the expression of key endocytic components. Also, the
  TDP-43 aggregates have been identified as an inhibitor of the endolysosomal pathway.
  TDP-43 interacts with chromatin remodeling protein CHD2 and perturbs the chromatin
  dynamics which prevents the expressions of heat shock proteins. Prion-like inter-cellular
  propagation of detergent-resistant, β-sheet-rich aggregates of TDP-43, has also
  been demonstrated in the neuronal cell models. CHD2, chromodomain helicase DNA binding
  protein 2; CTF, C-terminal fragments; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HSP, heat shock
  protein; P, phosphorylation; Ub, ubiquitination; UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome system.
