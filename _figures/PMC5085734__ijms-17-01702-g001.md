caption: 'Schematic drawing of the possible mechanism underlying the effects of resveratrol
  in relieving (a) nociceptive and(b) inflammatory pain. (a) nociceptive pain. When
  noxious mechanical stimulation is applied to the skin, mechanosensitive ion channels
  (e.g., transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels) open, activating
  the generator potential (depolarization). This depolarization further opens voltage-dependent
  sodium and potassium channels, generating action potentials. Action potentials are
  discharged through primary afferent fibers (Aδ- and C-fibers) to the central terminal
  in nociceptive neurons in the trigeminal spinal nucleus caudalis (SpVc). When action
  potentials are conducted to the central terminal of the SpVc, presynaptic voltage-dependent
  calcium channels open, leading to the release of neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate)
  into the synaptic cleft, which then bind to post-synaptic (glutamate) receptors,
  activating excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP). If the amplitude of EPSPs
  is over the action potential threshold, a barrage of action potentials is conducted
  to higher centers in the pain pathway and pain is perceived. It is possible that
  resveratrol suppresses both the excitability of peripheral terminals of the trigeminal
  nerve (by modulating both the mechanical transduction and generation of action potentials)
  and glutaminergic excitatory synaptic transmission of the SpVc (by inhibiting post-synaptic
  glutamate receptors and presynaptic Ca2+ channels). R, resveratrol; Nav, voltage-gated
  sodium channel; Kv, voltage-gated potassium channel; Cav, voltage-gated calcium
  channel; Glu, glutamate; WDR, wide dynamic range neurons; (b) Inflammatory pain.
  Following peripheral inflammation and/or nerve injury, inflammatory mediators, such
  as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), bind to G-protein-coupled E-type prostanoid (EP) receptors
  and induce activation of protein kinases A and C (PKA and PKC, respectively) in
  nociceptive peripheral terminals, leading to phosphorylation of mechanosensitive,
  sodium and potassium ion channels and receptors. As a result, the activation threshold
  for transducer channels such as TRPA1 is reduced and the membrane excitability of
  the peripheral terminals increases, resulting in a high frequency of action potentials
  being conducted to presynaptic central terminals of the SpVc. This results in the
  release of a large amount of glutamate into the synaptic cleft, which binds to upregulated
  post-synaptic glutamate receptors, augmenting EPSPs, causing a barrage of action
  potentials to be conducted to higher centers of pain pathways and creating a state
  of heightened sensitivity termed peripheral sensitization. It is possible that chronic
  administration of resveratrol attenuates inflammation-induced mechanical inflammatory
  hyperalgesia, with this effect due primarily to suppression of the hyperexcitability
  of SpVc WDR neurons via inhibition of both peripheral and central cyclooxygenase
  (COX)-2 cascade signaling pathways. ARA, arachidonic acid. X: Suppression.'
