caption: Model depicting BCH domain as a local modulator to sequester RhoA from inactivation
  by the adjacent GAP domain and possibly as a scaffold that links the RhoGAP function
  to RhoGEF and other effectors. The GAP domain of p50RhoGAP inactivates RhoA and
  subsequently induces drastic cytoskeleton collapse and cell rounding. This cellular
  effect could be inhibited in cis by the N-terminal BCH domain, but not its proline-rich
  region (PRR), that acts via a concerted mechanism including the binding of the BCH
  domain to RhoA via its Rho-binding motif (RBM), thus displacing GAP domain from
  inhibiting RhoA, and the intramolecular interaction region 2 (IIR 2) that augments
  RhoA sequestration to confer complete suppression of the GAP activity (pathway 1).
  As the BCH domain displays distinctive Rho-binding profile from the GAP domain and
  is independent of the nucleotide-binding status, it could help ensure that the GTP-bound
  active form of Rho be effectively sequestered from inactivation by GAP. In addition,
  independent BCH domain could also serve as a scaffold that links RhoGEF (e.g., at
  least with p115RhoGEF shown in this study; pathway 2) or interfering with downstream
  signaling of RhoA without directly affecting Rho activity (e.g., abolishing periphery
  projections; pathway 3). However, how these multitude mechanisms operate, either
  in isolation or in concert for a dynamic regulation, awaits further investigation.
