caption: 'The pathway affected by RG7112 was known while the mode of action was unknown
  for o-Vanillin. The two major pathways mediating cell-cycle arrest during disc degeneration
  are p53-p21-Rb and p16-Rb (17). Although both drugs activate cyclin-dependent-kinases
  (CDKs: cdk4 and cdk6) directing senescent cells to apoptosis and nonsenescent cells
  to proliferation, they act on two different upstream pathways. RG-7112 act on the
  MDM2-p53 interaction to reduce p21 accumulation leading to the suppression of its
  inhibitory effect of CDKs. This was confirmed in the pathway analysis. The data
  presented here is showing that o-Vanillin act by reducing p16 and suppressing the
  inhibitory effect on CDKs. Our findings suggest that the compounds result in a similar
  end result that can be explained by the activation of the same downstream effectors:
  CDKs-E2F-RB (please see ). At this level of the study, our first and most important
  goal was to determine that the drugs could reach the target cells and remove senescent
  cells and associated inflammatory factors in native intact human IVD tissue.'
