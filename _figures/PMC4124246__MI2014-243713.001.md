caption: (a) Signaling pathway induced by malarial ligand during liver-stage infection.
  Plasmodium RNA is recognized by MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-association protein
  5) present in the cytoplasm. Ligand-receptor interaction triggers assembly of MAVS
  (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) that aggregate on the surface of mitochondria.
  This eventually leads to the activation of both IRF-3 and IRF-7 which regulate transcription
  of IFN-I. Besides MDA5, activation of other receptors can also trigger aggregation
  of MAVS. However, this specific receptor and its corresponding malarial ligand have
  yet to be identified. (b) Signaling pathway induced by malarial ligand during erythrocytic-stage
  infection. Surface TLR4 recognizes a number of malarial ligands such as GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol
  membrane anchor) and MP (microparticles). Together with CD14 or CD11b/CD18 integrin,
  it can recognize heme and host fibrinogen, respectively. Both TLR heterodimer TLR1/TLR2
  and TLR2/TLR6 recognize GPI. Within the endosomal compartment, Hz (Hemozoin) and
  CpG DNA are recognized by TLR9. In addition, TLR7/TLR9 heterodimer has been proposed
  to recognize an unknown malarial ligand. These ligand-receptor interactions trigger
  3 proposed pathways. (1) TLR-dependent pathway involves the recruitment of MyD88
  (myeloid differentiation primary gene 88) to TLR, which phosphorylates downstream
  MAPKs (mitogen-activating protein kinases), such as ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinases 1/2), p38 MAPK, and JNK1/2 (c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2). Subsequently,
  NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and AP-1
  (activating protein-1) translocate into the nucleus and stimulate production of
  proinflammatory cytokines. At the same time, phosphorylated MAPKs or MyD88 can induce
  activation of IRF-3 and IRF-7 to transcribe IFN-I and ISGs (interferon stimulated
  genes). (2) Activation of TLR-independent pathway triggered by AT-rich motif present
  in the plasmodial genome engages STING, TBK, IRF-3, and IRF-7. (3) Another TLR-independent
  pathway involves MDA5 and MAVS. PfTyrRS (P. falciparum tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase)
  and PfHMGB (P. falciparum high mobility group box protein) were shown to induce
  proinflammatory responses but the exact signaling pathways have yet to be identified.
