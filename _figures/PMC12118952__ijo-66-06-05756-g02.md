caption: 'Roles of LDH in the occurrence and development of liver cancer. (A) LDH
  is involved in numerous aspect of metabolic reprogramming of liver cancer: i) Glycolysis:
  LDH catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which supports the energy metabolism
  of HCC cells under hypoxic conditions; ii) pentose phosphate pathway: LDH, through
  NADH, promotes ribosome, regenerates NADH and supports the biosynthetic requirements
  of cancer cells; iii) redox balance: LDH maintains the redox homeostasis of the
  tumor microenvironment through lactate metabolism and promotes cancer cell survival.
  (B) Roles of LDH in the tumor microenvironment of liver cancer are as follows: i)
  lactate levels increase in the tumor microenvironment, leading to metabolic abnormalities,
  acidic environment and fibrosis; ii) immunosuppression: LDH regulates T-cell function
  through lactate metabolism, whereby the accumulation of lactic acid changes the
  acidic pH of the tumor microenvironment, inhibits the activity of CD8+ T cells,
  and promotes the recruitment of Tregs and the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages
  to the M2-like phenotype (77-83); iii) angiogenesis: Lactate promotes the expression
  of VEGF by activating the HIF-1 α signaling pathway and then induces VEGF-mediated
  angiogenesis (85,111); iv) fibrosis: Lactate metabolites promote fibroblast activation,
  leading to tumor-associated fibrosis; and v) cancer cell properties: HCC cells with
  high LDH expression showed greater proliferative capacity, invasiveness and metastatic
  capacity (65). HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; TAM, tumor-associated
  macrophages; HIC-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; regulatory T cells, Tregs'
