caption: Comparison of O2-based (a) and H2O2-based (b) reaction pathways. To enter
  both pathways, a reduction is necessary to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I). In pathway a,
  transfer of a second electron and of 2 protons is necessary to complete the catalytic
  cycle. In pathway b, H2O2 alone is sufficient to complete a reaction cycle. Detailed
  potential catalytic pathways involving O2 (, ) or H2O2 () as a cosubstrate have
  been described elsewhere. Both pathways are thought to generate a hydroxylated end
  product (either at C-1 or C-4). The right-hand side of the figure shows a C-1-hydroxylated
  product undergoing a spontaneous elimination reaction that leads to cleavage of
  the glycosidic bond and formation of a lactone, which is hydrolyzed to become an
  aldonic acid.
