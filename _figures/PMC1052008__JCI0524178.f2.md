caption: Gq/11-activated pathways in maladaptive hypertrophy. (A) Calcineurin/NFAT
  pathway. Hypertrophic stimuli, acting via the α subunit of Gq or G11, recruit PLCβ
  to the membrane, where it hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2),
  releasing inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds
  to receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), releasing calcium. The increase
  in cytosolic [Ca2+], together with calmodulin, activates the protein phosphatase
  calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates several residues in the amino-terminal
  region of the transcription factor NFAT, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus
  and activate transcription of hypertrophic response genes. (B) PKCs. Activation
  of PKC isoforms is accomplished by the IP3-mediated release of calcium from the
  SR together with DAG (classical isoforms), whereas the so-called novel isoforms
  are activated by DAG alone. See text for details of the roles of the various PKC
  isoforms in hypertrophy. One PKC-regulated pathway not discussed is that leading
  to the inhibition of a subset of histone deacetylases (HDACs 5 and 9) that appear
  to specifically regulate cellular hypertrophy. In this pathway, one or more PKC
  isoforms activate another protein kinase, PKD, that then phosphorylates the HDAC,
  leading to its export from the nucleus and, thus, inactivation. This pathway is
  the subject of a review in this series ().
