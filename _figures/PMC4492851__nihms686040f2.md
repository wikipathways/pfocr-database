caption: 'Alterations in the gut microbiome associated with feeding, development and
  infection could modulate the following immune response pathways in ticks: A. Toll
  pathway. Microbiota-induced activation of Spatzle, enabling Spatzle-Toll interaction
  and initiation of the signaling cascade resulting in the production of antimicrobial
  peptides (AMPs). B. Immunodeficiency (IMD) pathway. Sensing of Gram-negative peptidoglycan
  (Peptidoglycan) by the peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-LC) to activate the
  signaling cascade leading to AMP production. C. Janus kinase/Signal transducer and
  activator of transcription JAK-STAT pathway. Microbiota and pathogen-induced activation
  of Dual oxidase (DUOX) results in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to
  control bacteria. ROS-mediated collateral damage to the gut epithelial cells initiates
  the release of cytokine-like molecule Unpaired 3 Upd that engages with its receptor,
  DOME, a signal transducing transmembrane protein receptor, to activate the JAK-STAT
  signaling pathway. STAT transcriptionally regulates pathways leading to immune responses,
  epithelial regeneration and repair, and peritrophic membrane integrity. AMPs and
  immune responses generated by Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT pathways influence pathogen
  survival, and also facilitate bacterial homeostasis (Based on citations , ,  and
  ).'
