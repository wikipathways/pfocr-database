caption: 'Oxidative stress-induced dysfunctional pathways in diabetic peripheral neuropathy.The
  figure illustrates about the mechanism of cells of diabetic peripheral neuropathy
  through different signaling pathways, which lead to different abnormalities under
  oxidative stress condition. Hyperglycemia initiates dysfunction by producing metabolite
  glyoxal by which polyol pathway inhibits cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) as well as glutathione (GSH). In the presence of excessive
  amount of glucose, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) bind with receptor for
  advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and impairs the activity of functional protein
  and causes auto-oxidation in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. As a consequence, insulin
  signaling is downregulated, whereas reactive oxygen species (ROS) acts as a second
  messenger. At the same time, due to maillard reaction, particularly albumin protein
  is depleted and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) show
  less activity. PKC activation increases the hyperglycemic level and accelerates
  dysfunction in transcriptional factor, through nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) impairment.
  On the other hand, hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress causes necrosis and abnormal
  gene expression through PARP pathway. GSSH: Oxidized glutathione; TCA: tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; TGF: transforming growth factor.'
