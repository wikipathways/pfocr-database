caption: Proposed model for differential regulation of the HOG pathway in C. neoformans.
  In the serotype D strain JEC21, in response to osmotic shock, Hog1 MAPK is rapidly
  phosphorylated by Pbs2 MAPKK and then translocates to the nucleus to adapt to osmotic
  changes in a manner equivalent to that observed in budding yeast. In contrast, the
  HOG pathway is specially adapted to control differentiation and virulence factors
  as well as osmotic stress in serotype A strains including H99. In this model, Hog1
  is constitutively phosphorylated by Pbs2 under normal conditions either by weak
  upstream activation or lack of pathway repression. After osmotic shock, phosphorylation-primed
  Hog1 is more rapidly activated than the unphosphorylated form, activates phosphotyrosine
  (Ptp) or phosphoserine/threonine (Ptc) phosphatase(s) through its catalytic activity,
  resulting in rapid Hog1 dephosphorylation. Under normal conditions, the constitutively
  phosphorylated form of Hog1 represses the pheromone-MAPK and cAMP-signaling pathways,
  indicating that the functions of the HOG pathway are uniquely specialized to control
  virulence factor production in serotype A and clinical serotype D strains.
