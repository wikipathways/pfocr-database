caption: A gene(s) denoted as X that encodes for a secretory protein(s) is activated
  by ERα in stromal cells. The secretory protein activates a membrane receptor-mediated
  pathway in epithelial cells, which, in conjunction with E6 and E7, promotes initiation
  and progression of cervical cancer (CC). SERMs and receptor inhibitors could be
  effective in treating CC. It is proposed that E2-liganded ERα promotes the development
  of CIN, but the activated ERα in neoplastic epithelial cells inhibits further progression
  of CIN. BM, basement membrane.
