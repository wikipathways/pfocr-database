caption: Overview of the IL (interleukin)-6 classical and trans-signaling pathways
  and their potential role in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth. A, In classical
  IL-6 signaling (left), the binding of the cytokine IL-6 to the mIL-6R (membrane-bound
  IL-6 receptor) leads to the dimerization of its coreceptor gp130, and subsequently,
  triggers downstream signaling in a restricted subset of cells. In IL-6 trans-signaling
  (right), IL-6 forms a complex with sIL-6R (soluble IL-6 receptor) that can stimulate
  cells expressing gp130 even in the absence of mIL-6R. The minor allele of a functional
  variant in the IL6R gene, Asp358Ala (rs2228145 A>C) results in more efficient proteolytic
  cleavage of mIL-6R, thereby reducing levels of mIL-6R and classical IL-6 signaling
  but potentially increasing trans-signaling. B, In mouse models of AAA, the blockage
  of both the classical and trans-signaling pathways with anti-IL-6R (ie, MR16-1,
  the animal-equivalent of tocilizumab) did not have a conclusive effect on the time
  to aneurysm rupture. C, Specific blockage of the trans-signaling pathway with sgp130
  resulted in improved survival rates in mouse models of AAA.
