caption: Proposed model explaining the impact of endothelial β-catenin deficiency
  on intercellular junctions, transcytosis, and fenestrations in BBB ECs. (A) In a
  healthy state or the presence of β-catenin, a natural Wnt ligand (Wnt3a) or GSK-3β
  inhibitor (LiCl) that activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, TJs and AJs
  are strengthened, and endothelial transcytosis and expression of Plvap is repressed,
  thereby collectively maintaining the BBB integrity. (B) In the disease state, or
  with the deletion of β-catenin that compromises the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
  TJs and AJs are weakened and endothelial transcytosis is increased, which lead to
  BBB breakdown. No fenestrations and expression of Plvap are induced upon acute deletion
  of endothelial β-catenin.
