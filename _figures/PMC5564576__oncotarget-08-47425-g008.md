caption: The scheme illustrates the proposed mechanism of α-mangostin-induced apoptosis
  in cervical cancer. Alpha-mangostin enhances ROS content to activate ASK/p38 signaling
  pathway and damage the integrity of mitochondria, including loss of MMP, increase
  of Bax and cytochrome C release, and decrease of Bcl-2, leading to activation of
  caspase-9/caspase-3 cascade and induction of apoptosis in cervical cancer cells.
