caption: 'Summary of established β-catenin pathways. β-catenin may exist: 1) as part
  of the cell membrane-bound adherens complex with E-cadherin and α-catenin; 2) in
  the cytosol where binding with GSK-3β, APC, and AXIN promotes; 3) ubiquitination
  and, hence, degradation; or 4) in the nucleus where binding with a TCF leads to
  promotion of gene transcription. *, Recent data suggest an alternative pathway (involving
  Siah-1 protein) via which β-catenin may be targeted for ubiquitination without GSK-3β-mediated
  phosphorylation. Molecules that bind to β-catenin are shown in bold. The Wnt-Frz-Dvl
  regulatory pathway is shown in italics. Black broken arrows represent the potential
  subcellular movements of β-catenin. Dvl, disheveled protein.'
