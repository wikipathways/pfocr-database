caption: Simplified diagram of some Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. Flagellin
  binds to TLR5; lipoproteins bind to cooperative clusters of TLR2, -1, and -6; LPS
  binds to the complex formed by CD14, MD-2, and TLR4; and bacterial DNA binds to
  TLR9, which is located in the membrane of phagolysosomes. MyD88 has a key role in
  the proximal signaling by these TLRs. Two LPS signaling pathways diverge from TLR4,
  LPS-1 and LPS-2. The LPS-1 pathway is mediated by MyD88 and through IRAK-4 and IRAK-1
  leads to nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation and cytokine production. The LPS-2 pathway
  is mediated by TRAM and TRIF and leads to the production of Type I interferons and
  nitric oxide, and has a role in the adjuvant effect of LPS in adaptive immune responses.
  A more complete signaling map can be found in Reference .
