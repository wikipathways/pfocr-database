caption: 'The mechanisms of MGF360-12L-mediated antagonism of IFN-I-dependent signaling
  in poly (I: C) or TNFα stimulated cells. MGF360-12L interferes with the nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB induced by poly (I: C) or TNFα by competitively inhibiting
  the interaction of p65 with nuclear transport proteins. MGF360-12L might suppress
  the induction of IFN-I in host cells via this mechanism. These findings revealed
  a novel strategy and insight for ASFV to evade the host innate immune response.'
