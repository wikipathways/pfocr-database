caption: 'Experimental methods and design. A, Low-magnification infrared differential
  interference contrast image of TC slice preparation with two recording electrodes
  in the TRN and their respective recorded somata, labeled TRN 1 and TRN 2. IC, Internal
  capsule; VPL, ventral posterolateral nucleus; VPM, ventral posteromedial nucleus;
  S1 cortex, primary somatosensory cortex. B, High-magnification image showing an
  electrically coupled pair of neurons in the TRN with their whole-cell recording
  electrodes. C, Schematic of an electrically coupled pair of TRN neurons with their
  recording electrodes and their voltage responses to alternating hyperpolarizing
  current (Iinj) injected to each cell. The passive resistor is used as a symbol for
  the gap junctional (electrical) synapse. During Iinj1, TRN 1 responded with a direct
  voltage deflection (left gray trace), and TRN2 responded passively through the gap
  junctional synapse (left black trace). On the right is the reverse: TRN 2 received
  direct stimulation (black trace), and TRN 1 responded via the gap junctional synapse.
  Voltage traces from an actual recorded pair. D, Schematic diagram showing metabotropic
  glutamatergic (mGluR) G-protein-coupled signal cascades involved in the modulation
  of gap junctional synapses. Activation of group I (plum) and group II (teal) mGluRs,
  via Gs (purple), or Gi/o (aqua) proteins respectively converge on the same intracellular
  signaling pathway. ATP, Adenosine triphosphate. The question mark indicates the
  unknown effect on gap junctional strength of PKA phosphorylation.'
