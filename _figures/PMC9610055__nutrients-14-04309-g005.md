caption: Possible mechanisms of action for chlorogenic acid (a) and caffeic acid (b)
  as antidepressants based on preclinical trials. (a) Chlorogenic acid may act by
  increasing levels of monoamine neurotransmitters as an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase
  isoform B, reducing neuroinflammation, reducing reactive oxygen species production,
  and improving host gut health by modulating the microbiota. (b) Caffeic acid has
  been shown to act through the modulation of α1 adrenergic receptors. Takeda et al.
  [] suggest that the activation of this receptor, which has a stimulator effect on
  cell signaling by increasing intracellular phospholipase C (PLC), promotes an increase
  in Ca2+ concentration, thereby activating Ca2/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
  (CAMK) and protein kinase C (PKC). These proteins promote phosphorylation of the
  cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Then, CREB regulates BDNF transcription
  []. Another action mechanism might be its inhibitory effect on the inflammatory
  lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway, which may reduce monoamine neurotransmitter levels
  in the synaptic cleft. Additionally, this bioactive molecule might promote the inhibition
  of the activity of the MAO-A enzyme. The red arrows (up) indicate increased levels
  and (down) decreased levels. The solid black arrow indicates stimulation, whereas
  the dashed black arrow indicates possible activation (mechanism not directly evaluated
  in the study). The chemical structures were drawn using ChemSketch freeware, version
  14.0 from ACD/Labs.
