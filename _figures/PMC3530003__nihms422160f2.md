caption: Activation of group I mGluRs (metabotropic glutamate receptors) couples to
  the translational machinery via the MEK-ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase) pathway. This translational stimulation is counteracted
  by two translational repression systems acting in series. BC RNAs (here represented
  by BC1 RNA) repress assembly of 48S initiation complexes [, ] and thus negatively
  regulate translation that is activated by signaling via the group I mGluR – MEK-ERK
  pathway []. Analogously, FMRP represses translation that is stimulated via this
  pathway [, ]. The asterisks associated with the two red inhibition bars indicate
  that published evidence has implicated FMRP in the repression of initiation or postinitiation
  steps, or both. Earlier evidence [] suggested a role of FMRP in inhibiting formation
  of 80S ribosomes, but more recent data [] support a role in stalling elongating
  ribosomes. The combined actions of translational stimulation and repression are
  assumed to ensure an appropriate excitability balance at the synapse. Dark green
  arrows indicate activation, red T-shaped bars indicate inhibition, and light green
  arrows indicate steps in a pathway.
