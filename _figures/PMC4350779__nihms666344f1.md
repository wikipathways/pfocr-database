caption: EVs are generated as ILVs in MVBs by ESCRT-dependent or –independent mechanisms.
  Proteins transported from the Golgi (i.e. MHC Class-II molecules), or internalized
  from the cell surface (i.e. activated growth factor receptors) are ubiquitylated
  on their cytosolic domains. However, not all proteins such as MHC Class-II required
  ubiquitinylation for targeting to vesicles. The ESCRT-0 complex recognizes the ubiquitylated
  proteins on the cytosolic side of the endosome / MVB membrane, segregates the proteins
  into microdomains, and binds the ESCRT-I complex, which in turn recruits ESCRT–II
  subunits. ESCRT-I and –II initiate the reverse budding of the nascent ILVs within
  MVBs. At this time, cytosolic RNAs and proteins have direct access into the interior
  of the forming vesicles. Next, the ESCRT-II complex recruits ESCRT-III subunits
  inside the neck of the nascent ILVs, which results in their cleavage into free vesicles.
  The free ubiquitin molecules and ESCRT subunits are released into the cytosol for
  recycling. Certain proteins (i.e. the proteolipid protein, PLP) are sorted into
  ILVs independently of the ESCRT machinery through raft-based microdomains rich in
  sphingolipids, from which ceramides are formed by sphingomyelinases. Ceramide induces
  coalescence of the microdomains and triggers ILV formation. The dashed line indicates
  that the role of ceramide in ILV formation is still controversial. The MVBs then
  follow either the secretory or degradative pathway. In the former, MVBs traffic
  to the cell periphery and fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the ILVs (now termed
  EV) constitutively, or following activation of surface receptors that trigger calcium
  influx. In the degradative route, MVBs released the ILVs into lysosomes. The lysosomal
  pathway is critical for limiting signaling of activated growth factor receptors.
  It is likely that differences in the MVBs confer the route of traffic.
