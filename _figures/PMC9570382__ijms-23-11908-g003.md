caption: LncRNAs related to the MAPK signaling pathway in liver cancer. On the left
  are lncRNAs that are independently involved in a specific MAPK signaling pathway
  and impact the development of liver cancer. LncRNAs involved in multiple MAPK signaling
  pathways are shown on the right. Some lncRNAs can bind to specific factors or mediate
  a particular factor to regulate a certain MAPK signaling pathway. In contrast, other
  lncRNAs are widely involved in several MAPK signaling pathways, affecting the progression
  of liver cancer.
