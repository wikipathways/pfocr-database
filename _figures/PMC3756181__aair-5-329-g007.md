caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism by which PGE2signaling
  amplifies COX-2 expression through an autocrine manner in LPS-stimulated macrophages.
  Upon LPS binding to the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the NF-κB signaling pathway
  becomes activated, leading to an increase in COX-2 expression, which in turn activates
  cAMP/PKA/AKAP through the production of PGE2. The PKA-AKAP complex blocks HO-1 activity,
  which results in enhanced translocation of NF-κB p65 to the nucleus.
