caption: Proposed model for the role of Twist1 in the ovarian cancer stem cells. (a)
  In the ovarian cancer stem cells, undetectable levels of Twist1 results in undetectable
  expression of hsa-miR-199a and hsa-miR-214, the inhibitors of IKKβ and PTEN, respectively.
  This leads to high expression of both IKKβ and PTEN. As a result, the ovarian cancer
  stem cells have constitutive NF-kB activity, which creates a pro-inflammatory and
  anti-apoptotic environment, and an inactive Akt pathway, leading to slow proliferation.
  (b) In the mature ovarian cancer cells, high levels of Twist1 leads to the expression
  of hsa-miR-199a and hsa-miR-214, which downregulates IKKβ and PTEN, respectively.
  As a result, mature/differentiated ovarian cancer cells do not have a constitutive
  NF-kB pathway, but instead have a highly active Akt pathway. These cells do not
  have a pro-inflammatory environment, are chemosensitive, and proliferate faster.
