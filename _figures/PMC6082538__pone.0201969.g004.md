caption: Analysis was completed using the ClueGO plugin for Cytoscape and the Candida
  Genome Database GOSlim annotation. (A) Pathway analysis of differentially-expressed
  genes in urinary biofilms compared to planktonic cells in AU. Genes involved in
  adhesion, filamentation biofilm formation, transport, lipid metabolism and response
  to stress were up-regulated in urinary biofilms. (B) Genes involved in carbohydrate
  metabolism, cellular homeostasis, oxidoreductase activity, and lyase activity were
  down-regulated in urinary biofilms.
