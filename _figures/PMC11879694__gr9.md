caption: L-fucose inhibits neuroinflammation and acts as an antidepressant.Fut8+/−
  mice exhibited depressive-like behaviors earlier than Fut8+/+ mice following CUS
  and displayed excessive microglia activation along with elevated cytokine expression
  levels. These changes may impair neuronal synaptic plasticity. Administration of
  exogenous L-fucose enhanced core fucosylation of gp130 through the salvage pathway
  for GDP-fucose synthesis, subsequently preventing the complex formation between
  gp130 and IL-6R, then inhibiting hippocampal microglia activation and subsequent
  neuroinflammation via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. This intervention may reverse the
  synaptic plasticity disorder induced by CUS and ultimately alleviate depressive-like
  behaviors. Our previous research showed that the suppressive effect of L-fucose
  on IL-6 induction by LPS was observed only in the Fut8+/+ cells, not in the Fut8−/−
  microglia (45), highlighting the significance of core fucosylation in neuroinflammation.
  Additionally, complex formation between gp130 and IL-6R was significantly increased
  in the Fut8−/− cells compared to Fut8+/+ cells. Thus, we conclude that L-fucose
  inhibits neuroinflammation and acts as an antidepressant, at least partly through
  the upregulation of core fucosylation, which negatively regulates specific cytokine
  receptors, including the interaction between gp130 and IL-6R. This figure is created
