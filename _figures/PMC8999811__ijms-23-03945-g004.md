  and ET synergistically regulate the defense against necrotrophic pathogens. BIG
  gene positively/negatively regulates MYC2/ERF1 and coordinates the defense of plants
  against pathogens and insects. NACs transcription factors in the JA pathway and

  TrypPI/POD/PPO (defense against Cnaphalocrocis medinalis), and PIs/PPO (defense
  against Thrips/Helicoverpa armigera), as well as the initiation of trichomes to
  defend against a variety of herbivorous insects. (C) JA-BR-ABA crosstalk-regulated
  defense response to viruses. JA and BR synergistically defend against RSV through
  MYC2/BZR1. ABA antagonistically regulates the defense response to RBSDV by inhibiting
  the production of ROS and the synthesis of JA. Arrows: Activations; Bar-headed arrows:
  Repressions. JA and ET are two crucial plant hormones that co-operate to activate
  defenses against necrotrophic pathogens, whereas the SA pathway triggers defenses
  against biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens.'
