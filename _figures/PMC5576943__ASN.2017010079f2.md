caption: Complement activation pathways and allograft immunity. Complement-mediated
  injury may occur in the intravascular or extravascular compartments. Ischemia-reperfusion
  injury increases extravascular cell surface expression of a fucosylated ligand that
  is thought to be recognized by Collectin-11 which associates with MASP-2, in conjunction
  with MASP-1 and MASP-3, to activate complement via the LP. After the cleavage of
  C3 and C5, the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) forms, resulting in inflammatory
  injury and cell death. Complement plays several roles in sensitization against donor
  alloantigen. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) express complement components C3 and
  C5 in addition to complement receptors C3aR (C3a Receptor) and C5aR1 (C5a Receptor
  1). Generated by complement activation in the extracellular space, C3a and C5a enhance
  APC priming of T cells by increasing the presentation of alloantigens and the expression
  of costimulatory molecules. Additionally, C3a and C5a promote CD4+ T cell differentiation
  and cell longevity. Furthermore, APCs promote proliferation and differentiation
  of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells mediate cellular rejection in both the intravascular
  and extravascular compartments which is identified pathologically as endothelitis
  and tubulitis, respectively. CD4+ T cells stimulate B cell proliferation and ultimately
  antibody production. In addition, the B cell response to alloantigen may be directly
  enhanced by complement, because it has been reported for nontransplant antigens,
  that opsonisation by C3b and its metabolite C3d can enhance antigen presentation
  via the complement receptor CR2, which is present both on follicular dendritic cells
  and B cells in secondary lymphoid tissue. Binding of the B cell receptor with the
  opsonized antigen lowers the threshold for B cell activation and allows for class
  switching of the donor-specific antibody from IgM to IgG. ABMR occurs when donor-specific
  antibodies recognize antigens on renal allograft endothelial cells engaging with
  the C1q, C1r, and C1s complex to initiate complement activation via the classical
  pathway. Again, C3 and C5 convertases are created and the membrane attack complex
  subsequently formed. Clinical evidence of complement activation is generally ascribed
  to the identification of C4d on evaluation of a renal biopsy specimen. All rejection
  pathways whether complement or cellular based present clinically with evidence of
  graft dysfunction characterized by increasing serum creatinine and decreasing urine
  output.
