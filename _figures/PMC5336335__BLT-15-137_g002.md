caption: Metabolic markers of the red blood cell (RBC) storage lesion have been identified
  through statistical analysis, such as Partial least-square discriminant analysis
  (A) and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC),.A combination of redox proteomics,
  quantitative proteomics and metabolic flux analyses has revealed a role for the
  oxidative stress-dependent regulation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GAPDH) activity in mediating the activation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  to generate reducing equivalents in the attempt to counteract oxidative stress over
  storage,. (B). Correlative analysis of metabolic and protein markers of the storage
  lesion was here performed and plotted as a heat map (black = R>0.75) (C). Of note,
  metabolic markers of the RBC storage age correlated with the absolute concentration
  of supernatant haemoglobin over storage, a marker of RBC vesiculation and haemolysis
  (D–G). Though only correlative analyses are here provided, it is interesting to
  note that all the metabolites showing the highest positive correlations with supernatant
  haemoglobin were part of the purine catabolism/salvage pathway, a pathway that is
  activated by oxidative lesion to the purine nucleoside pool and is in part counteracted
  by salvage reactions fueled by aspartate consumption and resulting in fumaratemalate
  accumulation (H).
