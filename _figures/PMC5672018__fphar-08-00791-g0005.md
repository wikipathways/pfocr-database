caption: Schematic diagram of the metabolic pathway related to PM induced rat liver
  injury. The boxes bordered in red and purple represent metabolites that are significantly
  higher and lower in the PM groups than in BC group, respectively. The light green
  and light blue boxes indicate metabolites significantly higher and lower in the
  model group than in the control group, respectively. The related metabolic pathways
  are cycled in a black box; ALT, glutamate pyruvate transaminase; AST, aspartate
  aminotransferase.
