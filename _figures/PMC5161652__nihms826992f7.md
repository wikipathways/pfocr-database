caption: Model of signaling events leading to MYC and YAP upregulation. (A) In KRAS
  WT cells, inhibition of PI3K/mTOR leads to up-regulation of p38 through activated
  DNA damage pathway (and inhibition of CREB and MYC), and upregulation of receptor
  tyrosine kinases, with only a minor increase in p-ERK. (B) In KRAS mutant background,
  increased MEK/ERK-signaling leads to slightly higher MYC levels, but high p-p38
  still opposes MYC, CREB and YAP. (C) In KRAS mutant cells that have down-regulated
  p38 activity by relieving DNA damage response through an unknown mechanism, suppression
  of MYC and CREB is relieved and YAP is upregulated.
papertitle: ERK and p38 MAPK activities determine sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR inhibition
  via regulation of MYC and YAP.
