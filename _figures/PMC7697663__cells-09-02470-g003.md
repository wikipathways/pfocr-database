caption: The early antigen-driven transcriptional pathway in effector CDT8 T cells
  and in exhausted CD8 T cells. (A). During acute infection, nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT)/c-Jun/c-Fos ternary complexes act downstream of T-cell receptor (TCR)
  and CD28 costimulatory receptor to induce the expression of effector cytokines.
  c-Jun/c-Fos also induce the expression of cell cycle genes. TCR-responsive ATF-like
  (BATF) and interferon responsive factor 4 (IRF4) TFs form ternary complexes with
  each of the Jun proteins at AP-1-IRF composite sites (AICE) composite sites present
  in enhancers of target genes, where they promote chromatin accessibility. IL-12R
  activation triggers chromatin remodeling, which allows continuous expression of
  lineage-specific transcription factors and effector genes. (B) During chronic infection
  and cancer, persistent antigen exposure leads to continuous expression of PD-1 and
  other inhibitor receptors (IRs), and to continuous induction of IFR4, BATF and NFAT
  TFs. The gradual loss of c-Jun/AP-1 by co-inhibitory signaling allows partnerless
  NFAT to induce TOX and NR4A TFs. In sequence, TOX and NR4A promote chromatin accessibility
  at exhaustion-associated genes. In absence of c-Jun, NFAT/BATF/IRF4 and JUNB/BATF/IRF4
  form ternary complexes at NAICE and AICE composite sites present in enhancer and
  promoters of exhaustion-related genes.
