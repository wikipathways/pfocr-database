caption: 'Main proteins and pathways that influence YAP and TAZ in lung development
  and tumorigenesis. During lung development, the Crb3 polarity protein sequesters
  YAP and TAZ at the apical plasma membrane preventing their oncogenic function in
  the nucleus. Amot, a component of the tight junction complexes, exerts a similar
  function. GPCR receptors, EGFR receptor, and other RTKs, when activated by ligands,
  induce the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (inside a red rectangle),
  which, in turn, activate oncogenic YAP and TAZ through mechanisms either dependent
  on or independent of Hippo pathway core kinases (inside black rectangle). Upon DNA
  damage, cell contact, or other stress stimuli, RASSF1A activates the MST1/2-LATS1/2
  kinase cassete, inhibiting YAP and TAZ oncogenic function. In the nucleus, Vgll4
  inhibits the oncogenic role of YAP and TAZ through impairing YAP and TAZ binding
  with TEAD transcription factors. Arrows indicate activation of the indicated proteins,
  while blunt lines indicate repression of targeted proteins. Lines or arrows in red
  indicate signals which eventually activate nuclear YAP/TAZ, while lines or arrows
  in blue indicate signals or proteins which eventually inhibit nuclear YAP/TAZ, through
  mechanisms either dependent on or independent of Hippo pathway core kinases. Dashed
  arrows indicate reciprocal crosstalk. Abbreviations: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; RTK: receptor tyrosine kinase; EGF: epidermal growth factor; EGFR: EGF receptor;
  GPCR: G-protein-coupled receptor.'
