caption: Schematic model depicting the effect of melatonin on endometrial receptivity
  and embryo implantation in obese animals. In both the in vitro model of PA-induced
  lipid formation in PEECs and the in vivo model of obese sow and HFD mice, inhibition
  of the PI3K/AKT/LIF/STAT3 signaling pathway was observed in uterine tissue, along
  with reduced endometrial receptivity and number of embryo implantation. The data
  demonstrate the benefits of melatonin treatment in obese animals, and the MT2/PI3K/AKT/LIF/STAT3
  axis in implicated in the melatonin-mediated increase in endometrial receptivity
  and embryo implantation rate
