caption: Hematopoietic deletion of COX-2 increases adiposity and AT inflammation in
  obesity. BM-COX-2 deletion leads to inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling pathway
  which, in turn, can activate the adipogenic process. BMT COX-2 deletion also activates
  the non-canonical Wnt pathway which may lead to increased adiposity as well as AT
  inflammation in obesity. Both increased adiposity and AT inflammation may contribute
  to the development of hepatic steatosis in BM-COX-2-/- mice.
