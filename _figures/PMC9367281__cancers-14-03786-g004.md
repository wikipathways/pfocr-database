caption: 'Positive and negative effects of PTEN on TGF-β, Notch, TNF, and integrin
  signaling pathways. Upon binding of TGF-β, the TGF-β receptor (TGF-βR) induces the
  phosphorylation of and nuclear translocation of SMADs, while the latter regulate
  transcription of EMT factors. TGF-β may potentially increase the protein level of
  PTEN via its phosphorylation. Notch signaling also regulates the expression of PTEN.
  The cleaved part of Notch receptors affects the transcription of different genes,
  including PTEN, which is a direct transcriptional target of Notch3. Notch1 downregulates
  PTEN expression. The NF-κB (Nuclear factor-κB) pathway is activated via LTRs, TNF
  receptors, and receptors for cytokines (e.g., IL-1R). The NFκB family consists of
  five subunits: Rel (c-Rel), p65 (RelA, NFκB3), RelB, p50 (NFκB1), and p52 (NFκB2).
  AKT-dependent activation of NF-κB induces the expression of Snail, which in turn
  inhibits the expression of PTEN, thereby forming the PTEN/Akt/NF-κB/Snail feedback
  loop. Integrins are involved in the regulation of cell adhesion to an extracellular
  matrix. The expression of PTEN inhibits migration and invasion through the αVβ6
  integrin signaling pathway. There is a crosstalk between PTEN and FAK. On the one
  hand, PTEN interacts with and de-phosphorylates FAK tyrosine kinase thereby inhibiting
  the integrin-mediated migration and invasion of cancer cells. On the other hand,
  FAK phosphorylates PTEN at Tyr336, which increases the phosphatase activity and
  protein stability of PTEN. Interactions of PTEN with FAK and paxillin, respectively,
  weaken their interactions with ECM components. Thus, PTEN may contribute to the
  process of destabilization of cell adhesion to ECM.'
