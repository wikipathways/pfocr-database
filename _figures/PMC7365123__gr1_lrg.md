caption: Putative association between ACE2 shedding after SARS-CoV-2 infection and
  the poor outcomes in elderly COVID-19 patients with pre-existing age-related cardiovascular,
  cardiometabolic and cardiorenal diseases. An imbalanced Ang II/Ang 1-7 ratio, due
  to the loss of ACE2 protective function, favors Ang II-AT1R signaling and subsequent
  vasoconstrictive, pro-hypertensive, pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic
  events (RAS-dependent pathway, right). Furthermore, ACE2 shedding may also dictate
  a dysbiotic gut condition (RAS-independent pathway, left). Briefly, loss of ACE2
  integrity, a chaperone of intestinal B0AT1 carrier, may negatively impact neutral
  amino acids transport with subsequent mTOR-dependent AMPs disrupted synthesis, altered
  local immunity and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Concurrently, increased Ang II levels
  may also impair GM composition and function. Altered gut barrier permeability may
  add an extra-level of complexity to this scenario, allowing the translocation of
  local microbiota components to the bloodstream, including resident SARS-CoV-2 viral
  particles. Whether these events foster SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission deserves
  further studies. Nevertheless, such deleterious cascades may aggravate the pre-existing
  gut dysbiosis, systemic inflammation and impaired immune response in cardiovascular,
  cardiometabolic and cardiorenal patients, rendering them less suited to manage COVID-19
  infection.
