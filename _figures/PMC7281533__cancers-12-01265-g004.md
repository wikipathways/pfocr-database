caption: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote cellular inflammatory response and
  oxidative damage, which may impact cell and tissue viability in the lungs. The figure
  is a schematic illustration depicting the primary point of mutual interference between
  Nrf2 and NF-κB. Note the cellular regulation of Nrf2 and NF-κB under normal and
  stressed conditions. Both Nrf2 and NF-κB are nuclear transcription factors that
  balance and counteract each other’s activity. Note also that the predominant activation
  of the NF-κB pathway through ROS exposure (generated either endogenously and/or
  exogenously) promotes genotoxicity, lipid peroxidation, and protein degradation
  leading to cellular and tissue damage.
