caption: In Drosophila the secreted protein Fog activates the two G protein coupled
  receptors (GPCRs) Mist (Mesoderm-invagination signal transducer, also known as Mthl1
  (Methuselah-like1)) () and Smog (; ). The active receptors act through a heterotrimeric
  G protein composed of Gα12/13, Gβ13F, and Gγ1 () by converting the Gα12/13 subunit,
  known as Concertina (Cta) from its GDP bound inactive to its GTP bound active form.
  The complex then dissociates into free Gα12/13 and a Gβ13F/Gγ1 dimer, which regulate
  their respective intracellular effectors. In particular, active Gα12/13 recruits
  RhoGEF2 to the apical plasma membrane where it acts as a guanine nucleotide exchanges
  factor for Rho1. Rho1-GTP then activates Rok (Rho kinase). Rok phosphorylates the
  regulatory light chain of non-muscle myosin II promoting apical myosin contractility.
  RhoGEF2 can also be recruited to the apical membrane through the transmembrane protein
  T48 which interacts with RhoGEF2 via its PDZ-binding domain ().
