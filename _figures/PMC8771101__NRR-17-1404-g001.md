caption: 'Microglial activation states.The left part shows the activation of microglia
  after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (A). M1 (Marker CD16, CD86; iNOS) have been
  observed to have the proinflammatory effect and M2 (Marker CD206, CD163, Arg1 and
  MHC class II) have an anti-inflammatory effect by interacting with signal pathway
  TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB, HMGB1, CX3CL1 &CX3CR1 and JAK-STAT. The right part (B) shows the
  latest results of single-cell RNA sequencing study on transcriptional states of
  homeostatic microglia (B1) and activated microglia (B2). Two to three clusters of
  resting microglia in mice were found and with an expression of homeostatic genes.
  Healthy human microglia were found to have four clusters: Human Cluster 1 (Hu-C1)
  to human cluster 4 (Hu-C4). Each microglia sub-state has its own up-regulated gene
  and some clusters have several similar characteristics. The activated microglia
  have also been analyzed in a single-cell study. DAM was a subcluster of activated
  microglia found in Alzheimer''s disease mouse model. Specialized Axon Tract-Associated
  Microglia (ATM) were observed in the developmental mouse brain. IRM is another subtype
  of activated microglia observed in lysolecithin induced animal model. DAM, ATM and
  IRM all shared a common transcriptional signature of 12 core genes including Spp1,
  Lpl, and Apoe. There were also differential gene expressions among them. However,
  microglia transcription heterogeneity leaves unknown in the SAH state.'
