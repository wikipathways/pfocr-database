caption: Sialic acid biosynthesis and recycling pathway. In humans, sialic acid is
  synthesized from glucose. The rate limiting step, catalyzed by GNE, is subject to
  feedback inhibition. ManNAc is the product of this rate limiting step, so exogenous
  ManNAc supplementation enters the pathway after this step. A substantial amount
  of sialic acid is recycled via the anion transporter sialin following lysosomal
  degradation of glycoproteins and glycolipids.
