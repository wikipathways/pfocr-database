caption: 'The main mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of exosomes secreted by
  cancer cells in promoting tumor metastasis and chemoresistance. ① Exosomes secreted
  from cancer cells deliver SMAD3 mRNA and protein to circulating tumor cells, causing
  an increase in intracellular ROS due to the upregulation of SMAD3. Finally, the
  adhesion of circulating tumor cells improves, and circulating tumor cell seeding
  becomes easier. ② Administration of exosomes derived from cancer cells increases
  EGFR levels and activates the PI3K/ATK pathway, thereby making cancer cells mobile
  and able to migrate from the primary carcinoma to the circulatory system due to
  the downregulation of cell adhesion. ③, ④, ⑤ Exosomes derived from chemoresistant
  cancer cells decrease ROS levels in recipient cells, making chemosensitive cancer
  cells chemoresistant through different pathways. ③ Exosomes deliver miR4443 to recipient
  cells. ④ Exosomes upregulate the expression of SOD2 and CAT in recipient cells.
  ⑤ Exosomes enhance the expression of Nrf2, followed by upregulation of GSH, thereby
  benefiting from the delivery of pGSN. ⑥ IFN-γ can activate JAK/STAT signaling by
  phosphorylating STAT1. Exosomes induce CD8+ T cells, which can secrete IFN-γ, causing
  apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment and upregulating GSH via inhibiting of JAK/STAT
  signaling. ROS: reactive oxygen species; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor;
  SMAD3: SMAD family member 3; PI3K/AKT: phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT; SOD2: superoxide
  dismutase 2; p-STAT1: phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1; GSH: glutathione; CAT: catalase; pGSN: plasma gelsolin; Nrf2: nuclear factor
  erythroid-2-related factor 2; JAT/STAT: Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription.'
