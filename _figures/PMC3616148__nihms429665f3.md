caption: High fidelity DNA polymerases stall upon encounter of an interstrand crosslink
  (ICL) in DNA. This event triggers the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, whereby the FA
  core complex detects an ICL and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to monoubiquitinate
  the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer. The monoubiquitinated FANCD2-I complex is recruited
  to the chromatin where it promotes ‘unhooking’ of the ICL and further nucleolytic
  processing of DNA by structure specific endonucleases - MUS81-EME1, SNM1A, FAN1,
  XPF-ERCC1 and SLX1-SLX4. Replication-associated DSBs are generated during the repair
  process and become substrates for homologous recombination (HR) to ultimately complete
  ICL repair. FAAP20 interacts with the FA core complex and binds to monoubiquitinated
  REV1. FAAP20 may direct REV1 and Polζ to the unhooked crosslink where they perform
  lesion bypass across the adduct creating a substrate for HR repair. We speculate
  that REV1 and Polζ are not only involved in TLS across the ‘unhooked ICL’ in preparation
  HR repair, but also perform DNA synthesis during HR repair when the template is
  incompatible for normal replicative DNA polymerases and may still contain unhooked
  ICL lesions or other polymerase blocking lesions. Both the FA pathway and REV1/Polζ
  have been implicated in facilitating HR repair of DSBs separate from the ICL repair
  pathway.
