caption: Effect of melatonin on the TGF-β signaling. TGF-β can signal via the canonical
  Smad proteins or in a Smads-independent manner. The specific course of the signaling
  pathway induced by the active TGF-β ligand depends on a series of phosphorylation
  of protein signal transducers. Intracellular levels of ROS are elevated after treatment
  with TGF-β1, while their presence ensures proper regulation of its signaling cascades.
  The hormone melatonin suppresses the TGF-β pathway due to its intracellular redox-status-altering
  properties, as evidenced by the effective reduction in ROS generation. Moreover,
  the inhibitory effect of melatonin is independent of its membrane receptor mechanisms.
  Indirectly, melatonin may interfere with many cellular processes coordinated by
  TGF-β-induced genes and intracellular ROS levels [158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167].
