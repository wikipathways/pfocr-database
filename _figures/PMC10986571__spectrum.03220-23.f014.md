caption: Scheme depicting the mechanism of HO-1 and its metabolites against EqHV-8
  infection. EqHV-8 infection decreases endogenous HO-1 expression, and EqHV-8 infection
  efficiency is negatively correlated with HO-1 expression. Three metabolites, namely,
  BV, CO, and iron, are produced by HO-1 degradation. BV, not CO or iron, suppresses
  EqHV-8 replication by reducing ROS production by activating the PKCβ and ERK1/ERK2
  signaling pathways. Subsequently, BV is converted into BR by the BVR enzyme. BR
  induces NO generation to reduce EqHV-8 infection through the activation of the NO-dependent
  cGMP/PKG signaling pathway
