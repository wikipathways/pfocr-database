caption: Abnormal Expression of Tryptophan Metabolism in Cancers and Its Correlation
  with Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis Differentially abnormal expression
  of tryptophan metabolism and related molecules involved in cancer progression and
  patient outcomes. Critical enzymes in the tryptophan metabolism pathway, such as
  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), kynurenine
  3-monooxygenase (KMO), kynureninase (KYNU), tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), play significant
  roles in regulating tryptophan breakdown. Transporters such as solute carrier family
  proteins (SLC1A5, SLC7A5) and the serotonin transporter (SERT) facilitate cellular
  uptake and signaling of tryptophan and its metabolites, while the aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AHR) mediates biological effects of tryptophan-derived metabolites. These
  enzymes, transporters, and receptors are frequently found to be upregulated or downregulated
  in various cancers such as glioma, melanoma, lymphoma, and cancers of the digestive
  system, breast, and lung. The altered expression levels of these molecules are closely
  associated with clinicopathological features, including tumor grade, stage, size,
  and lymph node metastasis. Elevated or reduced levels of tryptophan metabolism-related
  molecules reflect the imbalance in tryptophan metabolism that influence disease
  progression. Furthermore, abnormal tryptophan metabolism and its associated molecules
  are strongly correlated with patient prognosis, usually as demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier
  survival curves. These alterations in tryptophan metabolism show a significant relationship
  with key prognostic indicators such as overall survival, relapse-free survival,
  and progression-free survival, suggesting that dysregulated tryptophan metabolism
  could serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer
