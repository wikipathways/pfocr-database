caption: The biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids in apple and the expected role for
  MdMyb10 gene in regulation of this pathway. Enzymes required for each step are PAL,
  phenylalanine ammonia lyase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3 H,
  flavanone-3β-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; GT, unidentified enzyme encoding
  a glycosyl transferase for flavonol glycone synthesis; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase;
  LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; ANR, anthocyanidin
  reductase; UFGT, UDP-glycose:flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase.
