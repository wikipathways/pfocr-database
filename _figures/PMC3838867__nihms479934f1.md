caption: Metabolic pathway for mcl-PHA biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. A carbon
  source (i.e., glucose) is catabolized to acetyl-CoA which enters fatty acid biosynthesis
  for production of fatty acyl-ACPs. C12 and C14 acyl-ACPs are substrates for the
  thioesterase, BTE, which catalyzes FFA formation. An acyl-CoA synthetase (e.g.,
  FadD) activates the FFAs for degradation via a partially intact β-oxidation cycle
  generating enoyl-CoAs which PhaJ hydrates to produce mcl-PHA monomers for polymerization
  by PhaC. The resulting monomer composition is therefore identical to that of the
  FFA pool generated by the thioesterase. FadR represses expression of β-oxidation
  genes in the absence of acyl-CoAs.
