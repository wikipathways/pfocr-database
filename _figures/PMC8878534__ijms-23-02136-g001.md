caption: 'Simplified schematic of the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway. L-Arginine
  (Arg) is a semi-essential amino acid. Arg undergoes multiple metabolism including
  cellular oxidation to nitric oxide (NO) by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms:
  endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). Post-translational
  modification (PTM) of Arg residues in certain proteins yields monomethylarginine
  (MMA), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA),
  which inhibit NOS activity. NO is metabolized in red blood cells (RBC) by oxyhemoglobin
  (HbO2) to nitrate, nitrite, nitrosyl hemoglobin (HbFeNO) and S-nitroso-cysteinyl
  hemoglobin (HbCysSNO). NO, HbFeNO and HbCysSNO are biologically active. Nutrition
  and some pharmaceuticals can contribute to nitrate and nitrite, which form a cycle
  that includes reduction of nitrate to nitrite by bacterial nitrate reductase in
  mouth and gut flora. Circulating nitrate and nitrite are excreted in the urine by
  several mechanisms including renal carbonic anhydrase II (CA II). XOR, xanthine
  oxidoreductase, hemoglobin species and CA can convert nitrite to NO. For simplicity,
  the formulas of nitrate and nitrite are reported without their negative charge.'
