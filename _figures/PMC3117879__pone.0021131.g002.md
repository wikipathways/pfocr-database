caption: The circles and rectangles in the network correspond to diseases and metabolic
  subpathways respectively. A disease and a subpathway are connected by an edge if
  the set of disease genes are statistically significantly enriched to the corresponding
  subpathway. Node size is proportional to the degree of the node. Nodes are colored
  according to their categories, which include 18 disease classes from the Genetic
  Association Database (GAD) for disease nodes and 11 subpathway classes from the
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database for metabolic subpathway
  nodes. Edges are colored according to the enrichment significance (P-values) of
  associations between diseases and subpathways.
