caption: Role of RIPK1 in ConA hepatitis model. Schema of cell death pathway during
  ConA hepatitis in WT and Ripk1LPC-KO mice. The lectin activates LT, KC, NK and NKT
  cells, which result in the release by these cells of cytokines, such as TNF-α and
  IFN-γ. Activation of NKT cells induces hepatocyte death mediated by TRAIL/DR5 signaling,
  and potentially also by TNFR1, which depends on RIPK1 kinase activity. TNF/TNFR1
  binding also induces assembly of complex I by recruitment of TRADD, RIPK1 and TRAF2
  preventing caspase activation and limiting cell death. RIPK1 deficiency induces
  TRAF2 destabilization upon stimulation and promotes formation of complex II by caspase-8
  and apoptosis induction
