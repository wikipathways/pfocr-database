caption: 'Short range signalling between germline stem cell and its niche. GDNF is
  the most important signal produced by the “specialized” basal compartment of SC.
  Its receptor - c-RET (transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor) and co-receptor GFRα1,
  which functions as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored docking receptor that
  is needed for GDNF to bind with c-RET - is expressed in GSC, and SFK and Akt pathway
  are initiated. They control self-renewal and maintenance of GSCs. GSCs also express
  CSF1R (colony stimulating factor 1 receptor). Its ligand CSF1 is synthesized in
  “specialized” MCs (sMC) and in leydig cells (LC). Thus, CSF1 may cooperate with
  GDNF in supporting self-maintenance. Integrins attach the GSCs to the BM and may
  also contribute to signalling. Red: GSC; Light green: SC; Dark green: sSC domain
  surrounding the GSC; Purple: Spermatogonium (SG); Dark blue: sMC; Light blue: MC;
  Light red: BV; Orange: LC; Grey: BM.'
