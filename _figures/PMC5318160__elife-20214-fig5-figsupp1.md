  differential models (indicated by a red asterisk) are linked in a network that is
  driven by glucocorticoid signaling. Glucocorticoid (GC) acting via glucocorticoid
  receptors (GR) has been shown to stimulate the expression of thousands of genes
  in human peripheral blood (). GR is inactive when it is bound by a group of chaperone
  molecules that includes FKBP5 (). Active GR binds to GC response elements (GRE)
  in the promoters and induces the expression of GC-regulated genes, which include
  peripheral circadian clock genes such as PER1 and PER2 (; ; ), but also in many
  other genes such as FKBP5 (). GR can also induce the rhythmic expression of NR1D2
  (). GC induces the expression of the phosphatase DUSP1 (), which supresses the inflammatory
  response by inhibiting MAP kinases (). GC down-regulates the expression of the tyrosine
  kinase TXK, which regulates T-cell development (). GR increases the activity of
  CEBPB (), which is a transcription factor whose expression is increased during macrophage
  differentiation and mediates the expression of inflammatory mediators including
  CLEC4E (). GC reduces the expression of the metalloproteinase ADAMTS1 that regulates
  extracellular matrix function (). GC inhibits WNT signaling (). DAAM2 binds to and
  stabilizes DVL enhancing WNT signaling during cell development (). The MTOR signaling
  pathway senses nutrient stress and interacts with components of the WNT signaling
  pathway (). DDIT4 is a repressor of MTOR () and is transcriptionally up-regulated
  by GC in response to stress and fasting (; ). FLT3 is a tyrosine kinase that binds
  to GR and potentiates its signaling (). FLT3 also regulates dendritic cell development
