caption: Comparison of metabolic reprogramming of classically and metabolically activated
  macrophages. (A) Classically activated macrophages and their metabolism. (B) Metabolically
  activated macrophages and their metabolism. Adipose tissue macrophages in obesity
  internalize free fatty acids (FFA) and lipids from the dying adipocytes, becoming
  foam cells. These FFA can be used to synthesize new lipids, can be stored in lipid
  droplets, can be catabolized through the lysosomal pathway or be used to produce
  inflammatory lipid mediators called eicosanoids. Glucose is the main source of energy
  also in metabolically activated macrophages, where the glucose transporter is overexpressed,
  and it is catabolized by glycolysis, which is upregulated, providing substrates
  for the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), also upregulated. Also the metabolic pathway
  OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation) is upregulated in these cells, underlying their
  high energy demand. Succinate production is increased in these cells. This metabolite
  inhibits prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins, resulting in less hydroxylation
  of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), which circumvents its degradation,
  allowing its binding to hypoxia response elements (HRE) on target genes (). HIF-1α
  is also promoted by FFA and we hypothesize it might promote the switch to glycolysis
  by inducing glycolytic enzymes as it happens in classically activated macrophages.
