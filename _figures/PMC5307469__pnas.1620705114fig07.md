caption: Role of ATF5 in the survival of β cells during stress. Our findings place
  ATF5 within the PDX1–ATF4–4EBP1 regulatory pathway, downstream of and parallel to
  ATF4. ATF5 regulates 4ebp1, a negative regulator of translation. In response to
  stress, 4EBP1 binds to EIF4E, preventing it from joining the cap-dependent translation
  initiation complex, thereby inhibiting global translation. Global translation and
  protein load on the ER decrease, allowing the cell to restore homeostasis and survive.
