caption: '(A) Regulatory interactions sufficient to give rise to diel oscillations
  of malate accumulation and CO2 uptake adapted from  skeleton model: malate inhibition
  of PEPC (1); Glc6P activation of PEPC (2); PEP inhibition of glycolysis (3); light
  activation of photosynthesis (4); induction of stomatal closure by high Ci (5);
  and the autonomous vacuolar oscillator (6). (B) Pathways that articulated during
  CAM evolution. The anapleurotic fixation of CO2 by PEPC in unicellular algae occurs
  to provide carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis (magenta). The same pathway
  is found in C3 plants, which store in the vacuole malic acid resulting from CO2
  fixation during the night to be used for amino acid synthesis the next day. C3 plants
  are also able to close stomata upon high Ci (green). Three events could have closed
  the cycle to give rise to CAM (brown): an increased flux through PEPC; an increase
  in decarboxylation activity, e.g., NAD(P)-ME, and its delay to not overlap with
  PEPC fixation; and finally, an increased vacuolar capacity that allows the concentration
  of CO2.'
