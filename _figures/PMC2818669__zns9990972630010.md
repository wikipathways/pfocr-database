caption: Working models for homosynaptic versus heterosynaptic gating of LTP in postsynaptic
  neurons. A, NMDAR-operated homosynaptic gating model (). Left, Key components of
  the LTP gating pathway. During LTP induction, Ca2+ enters through NMDARs and binds
  to CaM, resulting in the activation of CaM-stimulated adenylyl cyclases [AC (1 and
  8)]. Adenylyl cyclases stimulate the production of cAMP, which in turn activates
  PKA. PKA then phosphorylates I-1 to reduce the activity of PP1, which regulates
  the phosphorylation of CaMKII. Right, This gating (blue) occurs transiently during
  LTP induction within the activated synapse, is most effective to permit LTP induced
  by certain patterns of synaptic stimulation that activate protein phosphatases (red
  arrow), and represents an activity-dependent homosynaptic gate for LTP. B, DA receptor-operated
  heterosynaptic gating model (this study). Left, Schematic of intracellular DA signaling
  pathways and their coupling to the CaMKII/PP1 switch for LTP induction. DA stimulates
  D2 receptors and elevates postsynaptic PP1 activity, presumably through inhibition
  of the cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling, activation of the Ca2+-dependent PP2B/calcineurin
  signaling, other unidentified pathways (?), or combinations of the above. Excessive
  activation of PP1 may lock CaMKII at a stable, dephosphorylated state refractory
  to activation by NMDARs during LTP induction (). Stimulation of D1-class receptors
  can, in principle, activate the cAMP/PKA pathway and suppress PP1 activity. This
  heterosynaptic gating may occur at a dendritic spine harboring D1 and D2 DA receptors
  and receiving dopaminergic input (right). Although significantly less represented
  in spines, D2 receptors dominate spine D1 receptors in the regulation of PP1 activity
  under hyperdopaminergic conditions. This scheme provides a powerful, constitutive
  control of LTP by background DA tone and may influence LTP regardless of induction
  protocols. We note that these models represent simplified schemes, because other
  intracellular signaling processes in postsynaptic neurons, impairments to NMDARs,
  and presynaptic mechanisms may also contribute to hyperdopaminergic impairments
  of LTP.
