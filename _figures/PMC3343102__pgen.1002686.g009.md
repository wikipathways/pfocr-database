caption: BZR1 is a positive transcription factor and represents an activation pathway,
  whereas LIC functions antagonistically as a negative transcription factor and mediates
  a “brake” pathway in BR signaling. Both BZR1 and LIC are phosphorylated by BIN2/GSK1
  and transported to the cytoplasm in the absence of BR (green represents positive
  members and the activation pathway, and red represents negative members and repression
  pathway in BR signaling).
