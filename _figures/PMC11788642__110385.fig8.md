caption: Schema of Rnf111 regulating the development of hematopoietic stem and progenitor
  cells by maintaining Smad2/3 phosphorylation and activating the Gcsfr/NO signaling
  pathway.Left. At a physiological concentration of transforming growth factor-beta
  (TGF-β), ARK/Rnf111 maintains Smad2/3 phosphorylation by promoting the degradation
  of Smad7 and further facilitates activation of the Gcsfr/NO signaling pathway to
  ensure the proliferative response of HSPC to TGF-β. Right. Deletion of ARK/Rnf111
  in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) leads to a weakening of TGF-β
  signaling output, which is manifested by a decrease in the Gcsfr/NO signal, resulting
  in an attenuated proliferative response of HSPC to TGF-β
