caption: Enzymatic pathways for oxidation of electrochemically reduced hydrogen sulfide.
  In the Sox (Sulfide oxidation) pathway (a), located in the periplasm of the microorganism,
  sulfide is bound to the SoxY enzyme through a cysteine-sulfur atom (SoxY-S-) and
  is sequentially oxidized to sulfate. SoxCD is believed to catalyze the oxidation
  through to sulfite (SO3-), with the final oxidation to sulfate (SO42-) catalyzed
  by SoxB. The sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) pathway (b), includes the formation
  of the free intermediates elemental sulfur (S0), sulfite (SO32-) and APS (adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate).
  In this pathway, hydrogen sulfide is first oxidized to sulfur in a 2-electron reaction
  by a sulfide:quinone reductase (SQR). In Beggiatoa this sulfur precipitates and
  is stored in intracellular granules. When the supply of sulfide has been depleted,
  elemental sulfur can be converted back to soluble sulfide and sent to the cytoplasm
  by the Dissimilatory sulfite reductase (Dsr), a membrane spanning siroheme. Sulfide
  is further oxidized to sulfite by reverse Dsr (rDsr), then to sulfate by either
  APS reductase and ATP sulfurylase, or Adenosine 5’-monophosphate (AMP)-independent
  sulfite dehydrogenase (Sdh). This cycle is completed when sulfate is electrochemically
  reduced back to sulfide at the cathode. This figure was compiled with information
