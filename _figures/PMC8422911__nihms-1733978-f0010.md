caption: 'Exposing Adam15−/− mice to CS leads to a phlogistic pulmonary response characterized
  by increases in the number of innate and adaptive immune cells (alveolar macrophages
  [AMs], CD4+ lymphocytes, CD8+ lymphocytes and CD3-positive NKT cells) and reductions
  in leukocytes having anti-inflammatory activities (Foxp3+ T regulatory cells) in
  the lung, along with exaggerated emphysema development and small airway fibrosis.
  The results of studies of Adam15 bone marrow chimeras and Adam15−/− X Cd8−/− mice
  indicate that deficiency of Adam15 in leukocytes (especially CD8+ T cells) drives
  the increased emphysema development and small airway fibrosis observed in CS-exposed
  Adam15−/− mice. Likely, increased release of Mmp-12 and oxidants from the increased
  numbers of macrophages and the increased release of granzymes from the increased
  numbers of CD8+ T cells detected in the lungs of CS-exposed Adam15−/− mice contributed
  to their increased emphysema development. The exaggerated small airway fibrosis
  in CS-exposed Adam15−/− mice may be due to: 1) increased release of mediators from
  leukocytes and other cells that activate (myo)fibroblasts; and 2) Adam15 deficiency
  in (myo)fibroblasts increasing the survival and/or profibrotic activities of these
  cells in the small airways. Adam15 deficiency increases CS-induced pulmonary inflammation
  by several mechanisms. First, Adam15−/− CD8+ T cells (and macrophages) are protected
  from CS-induced activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and consequently
  accumulate in, and injure, the lung. Adam15 deficiency preserves mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in CD8+ T cells (and macrophages), leading to preserved
  expression of myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (Mcl-1) protein (an anti-apoptotic
  protein which binds to the mitochondrial membrane to prevent loss of mitochondrial
  membrane potential, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and downstream caspase
  activation). The increased number of CD8+ T cells in lungs of Adam15−/− mice also
  promotes the survival of macrophages in the lung via Adam15−/− CD8+ T cells releasing
  increased quantities of Cxcl-10 (and possibly other ligands for Cxcr3) which bind
  to Cxcr3 on Adam15−/− macrophages to increase mTOR signaling in macrophages leading
  to increased macrophage survival and activation and release of Mmp-12, oxidants
  and other mediators that promote lung inflammation and destruction. Second, the
  accumulation of leukocytes leads to increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators
  that amplify pulmonary inflammation and destruction in Adam15−/− lungs. Third, lung
  levels of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-10 (Il-10) are reduced
  in CS-exposed Adam15−/− lung, which may be due to the reduced numbers of Foxp3+
  T regulatory cells (which are a source of Il-10) in their lungs. A reduced anti-inflammatory
  immune response likely contributes to the phlogistic environment that increases
  emphysema development and small airway fibrosis in CS-exposed Adam15−/− lungs.'

  description: 'Exposing Adam15−/− mice to CS leads to a phlogistic pulmonary response
    characterized by increases in the number of innate and adaptive immune cells (alveolar
    macrophages [AMs], CD4+ lymphocytes, CD8+ lymphocytes and CD3-positive NKT cells)
    and reductions in leukocytes having anti-inflammatory activities (Foxp3+ T regulatory
    cells) in the lung, along with exaggerated emphysema development and small airway
    fibrosis. The results of studies of Adam15 bone marrow chimeras and Adam15−/−
    X Cd8−/− mice indicate that deficiency of Adam15 in leukocytes (especially CD8+
    T cells) drives the increased emphysema development and small airway fibrosis
    observed in CS-exposed Adam15−/− mice. Likely, increased release of Mmp-12 and
    oxidants from the increased numbers of macrophages and the increased release of
    granzymes from the increased numbers of CD8+ T cells detected in the lungs of
    CS-exposed Adam15−/− mice contributed to their increased emphysema development.
    The exaggerated small airway fibrosis in CS-exposed Adam15−/− mice may be due
    to: 1) increased release of mediators from leukocytes and other cells that activate
    (myo)fibroblasts; and 2) Adam15 deficiency in (myo)fibroblasts increasing the
    survival and/or profibrotic activities of these cells in the small airways. Adam15
    deficiency increases CS-induced pulmonary inflammation by several mechanisms.
    First, Adam15−/− CD8+ T cells (and macrophages) are protected from CS-induced
    activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and consequently accumulate

    The increased number of CD8+ T cells in lungs of Adam15−/− mice also promotes
    the survival of macrophages in the lung via Adam15−/− CD8+ T cells releasing increased
    quantities of Cxcl-10 (and possibly other ligands for Cxcr3) which bind to Cxcr3
    on Adam15−/− macrophages to increase mTOR signaling in macrophages leading to
    increased macrophage survival and activation and release of Mmp-12, oxidants and
    other mediators that promote lung inflammation and destruction. Second, the accumulation
    of leukocytes leads to increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators that amplify
    pulmonary inflammation and destruction in Adam15−/− lungs. Third, lung levels
    of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-10 (Il-10) are reduced in
    CS-exposed Adam15−/− lung, which may be due to the reduced numbers of Foxp3+ T
    regulatory cells (which are a source of Il-10) in their lungs. A reduced anti-inflammatory
    immune response likely contributes to the phlogistic environment that increases
