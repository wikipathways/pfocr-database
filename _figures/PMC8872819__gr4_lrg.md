caption: Hypothetical life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and CRISPR-based pathway of PAC-MAN
  for RNA-guided degradation and suppression of viral RNA in CRISPR-Cas13-mediated
  suppression of coronavirus. (A) Hypothetical life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. After SARS-CoV-2
  penetrates and the genome RNA is released, the positive-strand RNA genome is used
  as template to form genomic and sub-genomic negative-strand templates for the production
  of additional transcripts of viral genome and positive-stranded viral mRNAs. (B)
  The vial function and replication can be suppressed by Cas13d by directly targeting
  and cutting all viral positive-sense RNAs.
