caption: Talin simultaneously links integrins with the actin cytoskeleton. The R8
  region protrudes out of the talin molecule structure, and a disulphide bridge was
  added to the linker area of R7-R8 to prevent R8 unfolding under mechanical load.
  The folded R8 region promotes DLC1 binding to talin and localisation to focal adhesions.
  This activates the negative regulation of the RhoA pathway that decreases myosin
  activation, actomyosin contractility, force generation, and migration. On the other
  hand, force application on the native talin molecule would unfold the R8 region
  producing the unbinding and deactivation of DLC1, which does not localise to the
  focal adhesion and loses its capacity to regulate the RhoA pathway. DLC1, deleted
  in liver cancer 1; RhoA, Ras homolog family member A.
