caption: Model of responses to Fe deficiency and Fe deficiency plus alkaline stress.
  A local root signal for Fe deficiency acts through the FeFe regulatory pathway upstream
  of FIT and a bHLH partner, which activate Fe uptake genes and subsequent Fe uptake
  activity. An Fe deficiency signal from the leaf up-regulates the same pathway in
  an additive manner (left). When alkaline stress is combined with Fe deficiency (right),
  it blocks the normal Fe deficiency response in leaf, resulting in a loss of shoot-to-root
  signal. Alkaline stress combined with Fe deficiency also weakens root Fe uptake
  responses at the transcript and protein activity levels.
