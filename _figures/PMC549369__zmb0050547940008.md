caption: Placement of Dap1p in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. Dap1p functions
  as an upstream regulator of Erg11p (solid arrow), regulating the stability of Erg11p.
  Dap1p also regulates the Erg1p protein (dashed arrow), although this does not contribute
  to MMS resistance. Dap1p also has a minor role in regulating Erg3p and Erg5p, because
  the Erg3p substrate episterol and Erg5p substrate ergosta-5,7-dienol are elevated
  in dap1Δ cells (Fig. ), particularly following ERG11 overexpression (Fig. ). The
  heme biosynthetic pathway acts upstream of Dap1p, and dap1Δ phenotypes are suppressed
  by addition of exogenous heme. One possible explanation for this order is that Lum
  et al. () have identified Hem1p and Hem2p as molecular targets for MMS (left of
  figure).
