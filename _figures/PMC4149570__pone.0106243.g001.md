caption: A) The MVA pathway is utilized by humans and other eukaryotes, archaebacteria,
  and certain eubacteria to produce IPP and DMAPP, the building blocks of isoprenoids.
  The pathway is initiated by the enzymatic condensation of 3 molecules of acetyl-CoA
  (1) to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) (3), which is then reduced
  to MVA by HMG-CoA reductase (4)   Subsequent phosphorylation and decarboxylation
  yield IPP (7)    which is converted to DMAPP (8) by an isomerase . B) The MEP pathway
  is used by higher plants, the plastids of algae, apicomplexan protozoa, and many
  eubacteria, including numerous human pathogens. Pyruvate (9) is condensed with glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate (10) to yield 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP; (11)) , a branch
  point intermediate with a role in E. coli vitamin B1 and B6 biosynthesis     as
  well as isoprene biosynthesis. In the first committed step of the E. coli MEP pathway,
  1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (also called MEP synthase, Dxr or
  IspC) catalyzes the reduction and rearrangement of 11 to yield MEP (12) . CDP-ME
  synthase then converts MEP into 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  (CDP-ME; (13)). CDP-ME kinase phosphorylates CDP-ME, which is subsequently cyclized
  (coupled with the loss of CMP) by cMEPP synthase to yield 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate (15)     . A reductive ring opening of 15 produces 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl
  diphosphate (HMBPP; (16))     , which is then reduced to both IPP and DMAPP in a
  ∼5:1 ratio       . C) The reaction catalyzed by MEP synthase. The intermediate 2-C-methyl-D-erythrose
  4-phosphate (18), produced by isomerization via cleavage of the bond between C3
  and C4 and formation of a new bond between C2 and C4  , is subsequently reduced
  to yield MEP (12).
