caption: eATP perception by AtDORN1 at the root epidermal plasma membrane could be
  upstream of AtANN1 via production of extracellular ROS. Perception of eATP by AtDORN1
  activates as yet unknown Ca2+ influx channels. AtDORN1 could phosphorylate an NADPH
  oxidase (AtRBOHC and AtRBOHD being the most likely candidates) with its kinase domain
  (KD) and the NADPH oxidase could also be activated by [Ca2+]cyt at its EF hands.
  This would result in production of extracellular hydroxyl radicals that could readily
  be converted to peroxide (H2O2) or hydroxyl radicals [,]. These could promote AtANN1-mediated
  Ca2+ influx. Peroxide could enter the cytosol through aquaporins (AQP) [], which
  could account for eATP-induced intracellular ROS accumulation. The latter is the
  clearest point for the divergence between eATP and eADP pathways. Decoding of [Ca2+]cyt
  as a second messenger leads ultimately to a nuclear transcriptional response that
  can be impaired in Atann1. The position of AtP2K2 in such a pathway has yet to be
  tested. This original figure was created with BioRender.com.
