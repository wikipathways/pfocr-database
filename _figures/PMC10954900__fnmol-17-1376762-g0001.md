caption: Timescale of cell signaling regulated by neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.
  In the brain, neurotransmitters and neuromodulators work as triggers activating
  several cell signaling pathways, depending on the specific receptor. Neurotransmitters
  like glutamate primarily initiate the activity of signaling pathways through direct
  ionic interactions. In addition, the flow of positively charged ions into post-synapses
  causes temporary depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane potential, namely excitatory
  postsynaptic potential (EPSP). Conversely, neuromodulators such as dopamine and
  acetylcholine undergo multiple processes, including the protein recruitment and
  complex formation of the G protein. G proteins exist as heterotrimers consisting
  of α, β and γ subunits. The α subunit is bound to GDP. When an agonist binds to
  a GPCR, which catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the α subunit. This causes
  a conformational change in the α subunit, leading to its dissociation from the βγ
  dimer. The dissociated subunits act as signal transducers. These complex steps for
  activating intracellular signaling contribute to slower and longer-lasting effects
  that spread out more broadly. NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate
  receptor; AMPAR, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type
  glutamate receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GIRK, G protein-gated inwardly
  rectifying potassium channel; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate
