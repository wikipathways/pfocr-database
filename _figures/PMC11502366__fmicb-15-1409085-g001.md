caption: (a) The chemical structures of various antifungal drug that specifically
  targets the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. (b) Schematic representation of ergosterol
  biosynthesis pathway reported in S. cerevisiae. The production of ergosterol molecules
  begins with the condensation of acetyl-Co and takes place mainly in the ER, whereas
  farnesyl-PP biosynthesis occurs in the vacuole. Allylamine inhibitors inhibit squalene
  epoxidase, which is encoded by ERG1. Azole inhibitors primarily target ERG11, resulting
  in the generation of hazardous sterols. Morpholines target step catalyzed by ERG24
  and ERG2, inhibiting ergosterol production, whereas polyene targets membranes’ ergosterol
