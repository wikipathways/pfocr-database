caption: 'The convergence of several signal transduction pathways important in mood
  disorders on cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein phosphorylation[].Since
  CREB acts as a transcription factor contributing to the control of cellular genetics,
  the term stimulus-transcription-coupling has been coined for this process. In these
  signaling cascades, postsynaptic cytoplasmic receptors, e.g., tropomyosin-receptor-kinase
  B (TrkB), glutamate receptors, monoaminergic receptors and others, are regarded
  as first messengers. They upregulate or downregulate a number of second messenger
  pathways, leading to the activation or inactivation of transcription factors such
  as CREB, a third messenger, which is activated by phosphorylation and acts via its
  cognate gene regulatory element (cAMP response element) in the promoter of target
  genes (the fourth messengers). As a representative target gene, brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF) is shown, although there are several others known.CaM: Calmodulin;
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; RSK: ribosomal S6 kinase; AC: adenylate
  cyclase; PKA: cAMP-dependent protein kinase; NE: noradrenaline; 5-HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine;
  NMDA-R: N-methyl-D- aspartate receptor; CAMKIV: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase.'
