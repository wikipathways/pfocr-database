caption: Crosstalk between YAP/TAZ and other pathways. (A) AMPK mediates the inhibitory
  effect of LKB1 on YAP/TAZ, but whether AMPK can inhibit YAP/TAZ through LATS remains
  to be studied. (B) YAP/TAZ can promote the expression of Notch receptor and Notch
  ligand. Once Hippo and Notch signaling are activated at the same time, they not
  only regulate the expression of common target genes but also facilitate the nuclear
  translocation of NICD and YAP/TAZ. (C) The target genes regulated by YAP/TAZ have
  different effects on different Wnt pathways. In Wnt-ROR1/2-FZD pathway, the activity
  of YAP/TAZ is enhanced by inhibiting LATS. In Wnt-LPR5/6-Frz pathway, by promoting
  the detachment and nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ from the destructive complex,
  YAP/TAZ and accumulated β-catenin regulate the expression of common target genes.
  YAP/TAZ target genes include Notch receptor/ligand and Wnt5a/b, which regulate Notch
  pathway and Wnt pathway respectively. The solid arrow represents promotion, the
  dotted arrow represents the movement of components, and the solid dot represents
  inhibition.
