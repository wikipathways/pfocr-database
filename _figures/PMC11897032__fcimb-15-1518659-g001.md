caption: Pathways of serine synthesis and metabolism. (a) The intermediates in the
  pathways shown in green are involved in the synthesis of L-serine, either from glucose
  via glycolysis or from the gluconeogenic intermediate 3P-glycerate. L-serine synthesis
  involves three main steps. The first step is that PHGDH catalyzes 3P-glycerate to
  3P-D-pyruvate. The next step is that the PSAT converts 3P-D-pyruvate into 3P-serine.
  The last step is serine synthesis through hydrolysis of 3P-serine catalyzed by PSP.
  (b) L-serine can also be obtained from glycine via a process catalyzed by SHMT2.
  (c) L-serine metabolism involves two main metabolic pathways. One is the synthesis
  of glycine, cystine, taurine and GSH through the carbon cycle. (d) In the second
  metabolic pathway of L-serine, SR catalyzes the conversion of L-serine to D-serine,
  which is oxidized by D-amino acid oxidase to generate amino acid, which is then
  non-enzymatic hydrolyzed to the corresponding 2-oxic acid and ammonia. (e) L-serine
  is metabolized to pyruvate through a non-phosphorylated pathway. Serine is also
  involved in the formation of phospholipids. 3P-glycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate; PHGDH,
