caption: Schematic illustration of the role of FOXO3a in GC-mediated inhibition of
  pro-inflammatory responses. Autoantigen (ALD-DNA) stimulation activated PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathways in macrophages, which led to the NF-κB activation, and the following
  pro-inflammatory responses. Meanwhile, ALD-DNA-activated PI3K/AKT pathway stimulated
  the phosphorylation of FOXO3a in the nucleus, which led to the translocation of
  FOXO3a into the cytoplasm, and being degraded in an ubiquitin proteasome-dependent
  manner. GCs could inhibit ALD-DNA-triggered phosphorylation of FOXO3a in a PI3K/AKT
  pathway-dependent manner and inhibit the nuclear exportation of FOXO3a. The nuclear-arrested
  FOXO3a could inhibit NF-κB binding to its response element (RE) and the following
  pro-inflammatory responses and thus contribute to GC-mediated amelioration of SLE
  disease. Arrow indicates positive regulation, and cross-bar indicates negative regulation.
  The already-reported mechanisms by which ALD-DNA induces SLE and GC alleviates inflammatory
  responses are colored black; the mechanisms of how FOXO3a was involved in ALD-DNA-mediated
  inflammatory responses are colored red, and the mechanisms of how GCs ameliorated
  ALD-DNA-triggered inflammatory response via regulating FOXO3a are colored blue.
