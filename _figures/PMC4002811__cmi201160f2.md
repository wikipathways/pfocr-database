caption: 'Peli1 mediates IKK activation by the TRIF-dependent TLR pathway. Based on
  the signaling adaptors, TLR signaling can be classified into two major pathways:
  the MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways. TLR3 is the only TLR that exclusively signals
  through TRIF, whereas TLR4 signals through both TRIF and MyD88. The rest of the
  TLRs, as well as IL-1R, signal through MyD88. An important mechanism of TLR signaling
  is K63 type ubiquitination of signaling adaptors, including TRAF6, RIP1 and TRAF3,
  which mediate activation of downstream signaling events. Activation of IKK/NF-κB
  by the TRIF-dependent TLR pathway, but not that of the MyD88 pathway, depends on
  Peli1. Peli1 functions by mediating ubiquitination of RIP1 and, thereby, activating
  IKK and NF-κB. The TRAF3-regulated signaling pathway may crosstalk with the RIP1
  pathway through induction of Peli1 gene expression and TBK1-/IKKε-mediated Peli1
  activation. IKK, IκB kinase; Peli1, Pelle-interacting protein 1; RIP1, receptor-interacting
  protein 1; TCR, T-cell receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor.'
