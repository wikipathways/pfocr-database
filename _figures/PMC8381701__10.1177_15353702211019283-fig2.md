caption: 'Regulation of CSC, non-CSC and different stromal cells within the TME by
  the ATX-LPA-LPAR signaling axis. The ATX-LPA-LPAR signaling pathway is commonly
  upregulated in cancer cells, CSC, and in response to chemo- and radiotherapy. This
  signaling pathway is also dysregulated in adipocytes, CAF, TAM, and T cells, which
  functions to further drive malignancy in cancer. CAF: cancer-associated fibroblasts;
  NK: natural killer cells; TAM: tumor-associated macrophages; ECM: extracellular
  matrix; ATX: autotaxin; LPC: lysophosphatidylcholine; LPA: lysophosphatidic acid.
