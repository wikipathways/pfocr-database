caption: 'Schematic illustration of the crosstalk between the Wnt and bone morphogenetic
  protein signaling pathways in osteogenesis. A: Binding of Wnt-specific ligand initiates
  the Wnt signaling pathway. In canonical pathway, activated disheveled 1 protein
  suppresses glycogen synthase kinase 3 and inhibits β-catenin degradation, thereby
  increasing the osteogenic gene expression. In non-canonical signaling, both Wnt
  Ca2+-dependent and Wnt planar cell polarity contribute to the upregulation of osteogenic
  gene expression; B: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) bind to the heterodimeric
  type I/II BMP transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors and activate the BMP
  signaling pathway. The canonical pathway becomes active when the BMP ligand binds
  to its specific receptor, inducing the phosphorylation and binding of receptor-Smads
  (Smad1/5/8) to the common Smad (Smad4). The translocation of this complex to the
  nucleus then modulates the expression of BMP target genes and osteogenic differentiation.
  In non-canonical pathway, activated mitogen-activated protein kinase induces extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and contributes to the upregulation of Runx2 expression;
  C: Upregulated Wnt and BMP signaling pathways induce the expression of Runx2/Osterix
  genes, followed by the expression of osteoblast differentiation genes, resulting
  in osteogenesis. This involves mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into osteogenic
  progenitors, pre-osteoblasts, and mature osteoblasts. GSK-3β: Glycogen synthase
