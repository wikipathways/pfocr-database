caption: Graphical representation of the IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathway, including the
  genes described in Table 1. IL-4 and IL-13 bind to their respective receptors, leading
  to the activation of the JAK3/JAK1/TYK2 signaling cascade and subsequent activation
  of STAT3/6. STAT6 then binds to the promoter region of CCL26, resulting in its increased
  transcription. An alternative signaling pathway involves the signaling molecules
  ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1), which contribute to cell growth, cytokine production, and tissue
  remodeling. Information on pathway components was obtained from the Reactome database
  (created using https://BioRender.com)
