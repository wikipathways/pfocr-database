caption: Bacterial functional variants that have emerged from whole genome sequencing
  of diverse strains include genetic variation that influences resistance to antibiotics
  (for example, altered dependence of the glcB gene in sensitivity to a drug targeting
  the malate synthesis pathway) or the cell biology of infected macrophages. Deletions
  in bacterial fadb4 from lineage 2 and 4 strains in the UK were associated with alterations
  in lipid droplet formation. Variants in secreted mycobacterial effectors that interact
  with host cells have also emerged, including in the gene encoding the secreted ESX-5
  WXG protein EsxW, with one variant associated with increased transmission in Vietnam.
  At the major ESX-5 locus, esxM encodes a premature stop codon in virtually all lineage
  2, 3, and 4 strains. In contrast, secretion of the full-length ancestral version
  – present in lineage 1 – leads to alterations in the actin cytoskeleton of infected
  macrophages, increases in the velocity and rates of migration of infected cells,
  and increased extrapulmonary dissemination. Similarly, a structural variant called
  TbD1 comprising deletion of mmpS6/mmpL6 is implicated in increased bacterial survival
  during oxidative stress and hypoxia in lineages 2, 3, and 4. These variations and
  their combinations may contribute to differences in rates of extrapulmonary dissemination
  and transmission between and within lineages
