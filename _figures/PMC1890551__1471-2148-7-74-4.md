caption: 'Pteridine synthesis pathway and gene duplications in vertebrates. Pteridine
  synthesis contains three component pathways [25]: the de novo synthesis of H4biopterin

  of yellow pteridine pigments. The formation of orange drosopterin has not been elucidated
  yet in vertebrates. In Drosophila, the clot enzyme is involved [53], which corresponds
  to the vertebrate Txnl5 protein. Asterisks indicate hypothetical reactions and question
