caption: Generation of SPR zebrafish lines (Tol2 method). Pathway-specific responsive/regulatory
  elements (REs) can be obtained from literature data or predicted by in silico analysis
  (e.g. through UCSC Genome Browser) of conserved regions close to known target genes.
  To enhance the responsiveness of the planned reporter, REs can be multimerized,
  thus potentially recruiting more signal-dependent transcription factors (TF). Multimerized
  REs are cloned upstream of a Reporter gene coding for a fluorescent protein, provided
  with minimal promoter (MP) and polyA signal site (polyA), exploiting, for instance,
  the Gateway-based recombination cloning strategy. For Tol2 transgenesis, the complete
  transgene is cloned into a final destination vector with Tol2 integration sites.
  The construct is then co-injected into zebrafish zygotes along with the Tol2 transposase
  messenger RNA. The corresponding translated enzyme catalyzes the integration of
  the transgene into the zebrafish genome. F0 embryos are screened for their fluorescence
  (which may vary among individuals) and raised to adulthood (ca. 3 months). Putative
  founders are outcrossed with wild type fish and their F1 progeny screened for stable
  transgene integration and inheritance pattern
