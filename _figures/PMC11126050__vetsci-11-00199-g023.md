caption: 'PI3K signalling and inhibition. The PI3K protein is composed of a regulatory
  subunit (p85) and a catalytic subunit (p110). There are three p110 isoforms: p110α
  (encoded by PIK3CA), p110β, and p110δ. PI3K signals through the AKT/mTOR downstream
  pathway, and this is essential for regulating multiple cellular functions. There
  are currently three classes of PI3K inhibitors that show activity against the p110α
  isoform: pan-PI3K inhibitors, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, and p110α isoform-specific
  inhibitors'
