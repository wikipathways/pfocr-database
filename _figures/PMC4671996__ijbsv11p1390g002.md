caption: 'Illustration of Warburg effect in cancer cells. The figure manifests the
  prominent aspects of Warburg effect in cancer cell, including glycolysis, lactate
  fermentation, TCA cycle, pentose pyruvate pathway, glutamine metabolism, and use
  of TCA cycle intermediates to synthesize lipids, amino acid and nucleotides. Pivotal
  metabolic pathways are shown in yellow boxes and the enzymes controlling key steps
  in glycolysis are labeled in red. Abbreviations: GLUTs: glucose transporters; MCT:
  monocarboxylate transporter; PDC: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PDKs: pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinases; LDHA: lactate dehydrogenase A; HIF1: hypoxia inducible factor
  1, IDH: isocitrate dehydrogenase; SDH: succinate dehydrogenase, FH: fumarate hydratase.'
