caption: Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network in cluster 1 from the MCODE sub-network
  analysis. (A) The interaction network and functional enrichment analysis of the
  23 molecules in cluster 1 were obtained from the STRING database. Molecules involved
  in the type I interferon signaling pathway are colored in red, the defense response-related
  molecules are colored in blue, the immune response-related molecules are colored
  in green, and the cytokine response-related molecules are colored in yellow. (B)
  The interaction network was validated using NetworkAnalyst with the International
  Molecular Exchange (IMEx) PPI database. The molecules that are involved in interferon
  signaling and cytokine signaling in the immune system are indicated in the red frame.
