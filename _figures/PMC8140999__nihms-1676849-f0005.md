caption: (A) Amino acid starvation pathway in S. pombe. Oxi, oxidative stress. Genes
  on the bottom are the targets of eIF2α-P. Toolkit (cis), the regulatory motifs used
  for translational control (arrow, positive; stopped bar, negative). Question mark
  on Gcn2 refers to evidence suggesting that oxidative stress activates Gcn2 (). Question
  mark on M-Stop refers to its possible involvement in regulation of rps/rpl translation.
  (B) and (C) Translational regulatory circuits discussed in this review. Left, original
  definition by (), adapted from Molecular Biology of the Gene, 7th edition. Right,
  translational regulatory motifs mediated by uORF-dependent control. In (B), Coherent
  FFL with AND node makes a persistent detector that only responds to a long-lived
  signal (). However, Coherent FFL with OR node works differently, as described in
  the text.
