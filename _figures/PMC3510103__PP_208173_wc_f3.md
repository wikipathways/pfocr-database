caption: Network of the regulation of submergence and waterlogging growth, adaptation,
  and metabolic responses by ethylene, low oxygen, , and . Elongation growth is controlled
  by GA-mediated pathways, which act downstream of ethylene and . In rice group VII
  , SK1 and SK2 positively regulate internode elongation, presumably through the stimulation
  of GA-mediated starch consumption and elongation growth. Conversely, the rice group
  VII  SUB1A inhibits shoot elongation by maintaining levels of the transcription
  factors SLR1 and SLRL1 to counterbalance GA responsiveness. In some species, underwater
  elongation involves hyponastic growth or the upward curvature of the leaf petiole
  or blade. The development of adventitious roots and aerenchyma is regulated by ethylene
  and . The presence of a thin gas film on underwater leaves helps maintain photosynthesis
  and, therefore, starch production. Oxygen deficiency dampens ATP energy levels.
  In germinating seeds of rice, CIPK15 promotes SnRK1 activity to enhance carbohydrate
  catabolism. Low-oxygen stress enhances the consumption of soluble carbohydrates
  in anaerobic reactions that generate ATP to maintain cellular homeostasis. In Arabidopsis,
  the up-regulation of genes encoding enzymes required for anaerobic metabolism requires
  the stabilization of group VII . This occurs conditionally, as oxygen levels decline,
  by inhibition of the Arg/N branch of the  rule pathway of targeted proteolysis.
  All group VII  of the Columbia-0 ecotype possess an N terminus that confers instability
  under aerated conditions and stability under oxygen deficiency. Orange, hormones/signaling
