caption: 'Model: While chromatin-bound Rad9 can inhibit NuA4 recruitment and chromatin
  acetylation to favor repair by NHEJ, recruitment of NuA4 by MRX can lead to acetylation
  of NHEJ core factors like Nej1 and Yku80. This perturbs the interactions between
  NHEJ factors, inhibiting NHEJ and enabling resection of DNA ends. As resection produces
  ssDNA, NuA4 spreads on each side of the break, favoring resection-based repair pathways
  like HR and SSA. The possible alternate mode of NuA4 recruitment by Lcd1/Ddc2 in
  specific conditions is also depicted. “Ac” represents acetylation performed by NuA4.'
