caption: Mechanisms mediated through vitamin D. The insertion of vitamin D into a
  colorectal cell triggers multiple pathways; both in the cytoplasm (non-genomic actions
  of vitamin D) and in the nucleus (genomic actions of vitamin D). Through its non-genomic
  actions, vitamin D halts tumor development through he inhibition of VEGF, EGF, Ras-signaling
  and TGF-β. At the same it induces IGFBP-5 production, diminishing this way the cancer-promoting
  effects of IGF-1,2. Also of importance is the reprogram of TAMs, which results in
  lower levels of IL-1 production. Consequently, the Wnt-pathway is halted, while
  apoptosis through the TRAIL pathway is triggered. Followin bondage with the VDR
  it can either bind β-catenin (inhibiting its translocation to the nucleus) or, after
  being heterodimerized with the RXR, translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus,
  the complex vitamin D-VDR-RXR binds to VDREs gene sequences. As an aftermath, the
  induction of the anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin 1 occurs, as well as apoptosis
  through the SPARC pathway and transcription of Wnt-inhibitors. Finally, the inhibition
  of NF-κB and TLR-2,4, while tumor growth is halted (through inhibition of CDK-Is,
  cyclin D1, c-myc, etc). ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; VEGF, vascular
  endothelial growth factor; TAMs, tumor-associated macrophages; VDR, vitamin D receptor;
  RXR, retinoid X receptor; VDREs, vitamin D response elements; SPARC, secreted protein
  acidic and rich in cysteine.
