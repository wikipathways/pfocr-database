caption: The SREBP-regulated mevalonate pathway and its regulation. Schematic representation
  summarizing the SREBP-2-regulated mevalonate pathway and key enzymes for synthesis
  from acetyl-CoA to cholesterol and its products. Multiple signaling pathways such
  as p53, Akt, and androgen can regulate SREBP-2 activation. Several regulatory feedback
  mechanisms exist for different enzymes by various signals and mevalonate metabolites,
  such as cholesterol, IPP (Isopentenylpyrophosphate) and FPP (farnesylpyrophosphate).
