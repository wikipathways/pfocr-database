caption: 'Putative pathway of carbon metabolism in H. modesticaldum (adapted from
  reference ). A partial reverse citric acid cycle with CO2 incorporation via PEP
  carboxykinase is shown. The enzymes involved in the reduction of acetate to pyruvate
  putatively function in an oxidative direction during chemotrophic (dark) growth
  on pyruvate. The oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is likely accompanied by hydrogen
  evolution via an [FeFe] hydrogenase. The numbers indicate the following enzymes:
  1, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase; 2, pyruvate-phosphate dikinase; 3, PEP carboxykinase;
  4, oxaloacetate decarboxylase; 5, malate dehydrogenase; 6, fumarase; 7, fumarate
  reductase; 8, succinyl-CoA synthetase; 9, 2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase;
  10, NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase; 11, aconitate hydratase; 12, AMP-forming
  acetyl-CoA synthetase; 13, lactate dehydrogenase.'
