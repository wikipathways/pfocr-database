  panel – Cell-cell-contact activates the Hippo pathway to repress growth and proliferation
  – Yorkie is inactive. Right panel – The increase in resources leads to the down
  regulation of the inhibitory upstream regulators – Yorkie translocates to the nucleus
  and activates its growth- and proliferation-promoting program.

    Left panel – Cell-cell-contact activates the Hippo pathway to repress growth and
    proliferation – Yorkie is inactive. Right panel – The increase in resources leads
    to the down regulation of the inhibitory upstream regulators – Yorkie translocates
    to the nucleus and activates its growth- and proliferation-promoting program.
