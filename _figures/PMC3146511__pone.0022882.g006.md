caption: The top network of regulated genes in human myoblasts infected with Ad-ANGPT2
  viruses vs. cells infected with Ad-GFP viruses (control condition). This figure
  was created with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis system. Upregulated genes are shown
  in red while downregulated genes are shown in green. Color intensity indicates the
  degree of change in gene expression. White nodes are genes whose expression was
  not significantly changed in cells infected with Ad-ANGPT2 viruses vs. Ad-GFP viruses.
  Arrows with plain lines indicate direction interactions, and arrows with interrupted
  lines represent indirect interactions. Top functions associated with this network
  include cell cycle, cellular assembly and organization, DNA replication, recombination
  and repair.
