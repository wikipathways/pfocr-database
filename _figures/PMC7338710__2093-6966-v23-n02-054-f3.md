caption: JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In mammals, the JAK/STAT pathway is the principal
  signaling mechanism for a wide array of cytokines and growth factors. Upon ligand
  binding, Jak associated with cytokine receptors undergo transphosphorylation and
  mediate phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on the cytokine receptor.
  Binding of cytokines to the receptors induces dimerization of these receptors and
  causes the phosphorylation of JAKs and STATs. Activation of STAT causes dimerization.
  These dimers serve as a transcription factor and causes transcription of Matrix
  Metallopeptidase 13(MMP-13). The JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway is utilized
  by many cytokines and growth factors that regulate gene expression and cellular
  activation, proliferation, and differentiation.
