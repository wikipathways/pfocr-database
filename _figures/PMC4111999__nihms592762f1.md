caption: Schematic showing the possible integration of emerging, mass spectrometry-based
  technologies into the untargeted metabolomic pipeline. The workflow starts with
  a features table that is output from LC/MS-based untargeted metabolomics. Features
  likely representing naturally occurring isotopes, adducts, and fragments of a single
  compound can be grouped by using the CAMERA software. After data reduction, mass-to-charge
  ratios can be searched in databases and interesting candidates chosen as targets
  for structural identification. Alternatively, the data can be analyzed by mummichog
  to find candidates that map onto related pathways. After acquiring MS2 data for
  features of interest, the spectra can be deconvolved by decoMS2 and matched against
  the MS2 of authentic standards. These pathway enrichments and identifications can
  be used to guide further experimentation that involve construction of standard curves
  to determine absolute concentrations, stable-isotope analysis to calculate metabolic
  flux, and mass spectrometry-based imaging to localize metabolites within biological
  tissues.
