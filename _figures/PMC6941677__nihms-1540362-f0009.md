caption: 'A working model of the bacterial lignan metabolism pathway is presented.
  Several transporters, which traffic small molecules (ABC transporters) or ions (MFS
  transporters) across bacterial membranes, were significantly up-regulated in response
  to lignan doses and may be responsible for funneling substrates or products across
  cell membranes. Ber: benzyl ether reductase; Glm: guaiacol lignan methyltransferase;
  Cldh: catechol lignan dehydroxylase; Edl: enterodiol lactonizing enzyme; ABC: ATP-binding
  cassette; MFS: major facilitator superfamily.'
