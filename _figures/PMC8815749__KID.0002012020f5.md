caption: 'Mediated by the placenta, maternal energy balance regulates metabolic pathways
  in the fetal kidney, determined by the activity of AMPK and mTOR. Whereas AMPK activates
  catabolic pathways, mTORC1 activates anabolic pathways. Once activated by stressors
  such as hypoxia and nutrient restriction, AMPK restores energy homeostasis, reducing
  energy consumption by inhibiting mTORC1, and phosphorylating substrates such as
  PGC1α that stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis. mTORC1 is a nutrient sensor activated
  by growth factors, amino acids, glucose, and oxidative stress. mTORC1 coactivates
  the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, PGC1α, and transcription of mitochondrial
  genes (). Mitochondrial biogenesis, regulated by PGC1α, requires a balance between
  fission, fusion, and mitophagy (removal of defective mitochondria from cells by
  autophagy). Mitochondria determine whether cells respond to stress in an adaptive
  or suicidal manner: metabolic cues regulate activation of cell death pathways by
  acting on nutrient sensors (,). In response to nutritional deprivation, AMPK also
  activates autophagy, ensuring survival of organs whose energy supply cannot be interrupted.
  The importance of the mTOR pathway in nephrogenesis was revealed by marked reduction
  in nephron number in mice with conditional knockout of mTOR in nephron progenitor
  cells (). More dramatic was the demonstration of a 25% increase in nephron number
  in mice with conditional knockout of one allele of the tuberous sclerosis gene,
  tsc1, which codes for hamartin, a protein that complexes with tuberin, thereby inhibiting
  mTORC1 (). HIF-1 triggers a switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to anaerobic
  conditions and reduces oxygen consumption in mitochondria by suppressing biogenesis
  and activating mitophagy (). Nephron progenitor cells subjected to a hypoxic environment
  undergo glycolytic metabolism favoring cell proliferation, whereas higher oxygen
  environment favors OXPHOS metabolism and nephron differentiation driven by progenitor
  cell maturation in response to VHL-driven HIF-1 suppression (). Inhibition of glycolysis
  enhances Wnt/β catenin signaling, leading to increased nephrogenesis (). Atg1, autophagy-related
