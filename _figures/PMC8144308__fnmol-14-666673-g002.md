caption: Circadian clocks impose a daily rhythm on intracellular Ca2+signaling. (A)
  Photic inputs via CRY or other signaling molecules such as PLC cause a phase-shift
  in the expression of molecular clock components in the mammalian and Drosophila
  central clocks. In turn, TTFL regulate cytosolic Ca2+ rhythms. In SCN neurons, circadian
  oscillations of Ca2+ levels are also dependent on the mobilization of Ca2+ from
  the endoplasmic reticulum. (B) Circadian clocks impose a daily rhythm of expression
  to a large number of components of the Ca2+signaling pathway by acting at transcriptional
  or post-transcriptional levels (including by regulating alternative splicing in
  Drosophila and microRNA in mice). In addition, in mice, the Ca2+/calcineurin/NFAT
  pathway exhibits a rhythmic activity in peripheral clocks, such as the one present
  in skeletal muscle or heart, which is probably mediated by inputs from the central
  clock. IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate Receptor; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated
  T-cells; RORE, ROR response elements. RCAN1, regulator of calcineurin 1. RyR, ryanodine
  receptor. SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase. See  for other
  abbreviations.
