caption: Synthesis and fate of piRNA precursor transcripts in Drosophila ovarian somatic
  cells versus germinal cells. In somatic follicle cells (left) most piRNA clusters
  are uni-strand. The flam locus (red square) spans over approximately 200 kb and
  is located at the pericentromeric region of the X-chromosome, downstream of the
  DIP1 gene. flam transcription is initiated from an RNA polymerase II promoter containing
  a transcription start site (TSS) at position X:21,502,918. The transcription factor
  Cubitus interruptus (Ci) activates the transcription. Capped (blue circle) and polyadenylated
  flam transcripts, undergo differential alternative splicing to generate diverse
  RNA precursors that all share the first exon at their 5′ end. flam piRNA precursors,
  together with transcripts coming from other somatic piRNA clusters (dark green square),
  are addressed to a single nuclear structure designated Dot COM (blue shadow) in
  ovarian follicle cells. Dot COM is localized at the nuclear membrane and faces a
  cytoplasmic Yb body where piRNA precursors are proposed to be transferred and processed.
  In germinal cells (right) most piRNA clusters are dual-strand, such as the 42AB
  locus (red square) located on chromosome 2R. Dual-strand cluster expression depends
  on Rhi, Del and Cuff, which repress RNA polymerase II termination leading to a presumed
  read-through transcription of piRNA clusters initiated at neighboring genes. Cuff
  is also thought to compete with the cap binding complex (CBC) to bind uncapped nascent
  RNAs, to prevent RNA capping and splicing. UAP56 binds dual-strand-cluster transcripts
  and escorts them to the nuclear periphery where cytoplasmic Vasa may transfer them
  to cytoplasmic nuage where germinal piRNAs are processed.
