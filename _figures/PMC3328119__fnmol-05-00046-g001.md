caption: Long-term memory formation is linked to circadian time and the suprachiasmatic
  nucleus. Activity oscillations within the MAPK pathway are dependent on the SCN,
  ultimately linking them to external zeitgebers such as light. Oscillations of the
  MAPK pathway depend on the rhythmic activation of Ras activity as well as that of
  the calcium-stimulated adenylyl cyclases and ultimately control downstream signaling
  events including de novo transcription and translation. Rhythmicity within this
  cascade controls not only the efficiency with which memories are formed but also
  their persistence once forged.
