caption: Plant mitochondria as hubs in redox metabolism, signaling, and plant growth.
  Plant mitochondria have a typical structure consisting of an outer membrane, inner
  membrane, and intermembrane space (IMS). The IMM forms large folds called cristae.
  The MTL complex is important for the formation of cristae at the cristae junction,
  and potentially interacts with TOM and mtETC components. The cristae lumen is thought
  to be important for the concentration of protons and protein complexes, improving
  metabolic efficiency. The TCA cycle uses substrates derived from glycolysis, photosynthesis,
  and amino acid metabolism to reduce NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H. NADH is used to drive the
  mitochondrial electron transport chain (Complexes I–IV and AOXs and NDs), consuming
  O2. The cyt c pathway drives proton translocation from the mitochondrial matrix
  into the IMS, which can flow back via ATP synthase (green complex) to produce ATP
  or via UCPs without producing ATP. ATP can be exported into the cytosol and acts
  as a major energy source for a variety of cellular processes. Reductant from photosynthesis
  is transported to the mitochondria via the malate valve, which may be important
  to dissipate excess reductant from photosynthesis via the TCA cycle and mtETC. Excess
  citrate may leave the mitochondria via the citrate valve to be used in cytosolic
  metabolism. Other TCA cycle intermediates can be exchanged with the cytosol via
  mitochondrial carrier proteins to support metabolism. A TP-3PGA shuttle is thought
  to export NADH/ATP equivalents from the chloroplast into the cytosol. The mtETC
  inevitably produces superoxide as a by-product, especially under stress, which is
  rapidly scavenged by MnSOD, producing H2O2. H2O2 is further reduced in the Asc-GSH
  cycle, or by other peroxidase systems such as GPXs and Prxs. These peroxidase systems
  are regenerated by the Trx/ NTR system, ultimately using NADPH as a reductant. Mitochondrial
  GRXs mainly play a role in Fe–S cluster protein biosynthesis. Some of the H2O2 may
  either enter or leave mitochondria (via VDAC or aquaporins), which may have a signaling
  role. The functional status of mitochondria is communicated to the cellular nucleus
  via MRR. A key pathway that is activated during mitochondrial dysfunction is mediated
  by ANAC017-related transcription factors, which are anchored into the endoplasmic
  reticulum membrane. Upon stress, the NAC transcription factors are thought to be
  released by proteases and regulate gene expression of alternative mtETC components
  and other mitochondrial dysfunction stimulon genes. Other ANAC017-independent retrograde
  pathways are also likely to be active and may steer mitochondrial biogenesis. Overall,
  plant mitochondria act as redox, metabolism, and signaling hubs that affect all
  aspects of plant development and stress response.
