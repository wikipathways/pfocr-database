caption: Model of PLB1 transcriptional activation upon loss of Ypk1 or upon disruption
  to sphingolipid biosynthesis through treatment with myriocin. Left, events occurring
  in a WT cell in which cell growth is favored. TORC2 and Pkh1/2 phosphorylate and
  activate Ypk1, which leads to phosphorylation of Orm1/2 and subsequent release from
  SPT inhibition. This allows sphingolipid synthesis to proceed. The TORC2/Ypk1 signaling
  pathway predominates over the calcineurin pathway, resulting in only a basal level
  of PLB1 transcription and a basal level of Plb1-mediated PC turnover. Right, events
  occurring under conditions promoting cell survival upon loss of YPK1, where the
  calcineurin signaling pathway predominates and Crz1 is dephosphorylated. Crz1 translocates
  into the nucleus and elevates PLB1 transcript levels and Plb1-mediated PC turnover.
  The right panel (gray lines) also indicates elevation of Crz1-activated PLB1 transcription
  in the presence of myriocin. The dotted line indicates movement into the nucleus.
