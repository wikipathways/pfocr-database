caption: 'Synthesis of the GPI Anchor and Transfer of the Anchor to Proteins in Wild-Type
  and pnt1 Cells.For simplicity, some intermediates are not shown. Enzymatic steps
  are as follows: 1, generation of GlcNAc-PI from UDP-GlcNAc and phosphatidylinositol;
  2, deacetylation of GlcNAc-PI to GlcN-PI; 3, acylation of GlcN-PI; 4, GlcN-acyl-PI
  is flipped from cytosolic to lumenal side of ER; 5, first mannose transferred to
  GlcN-acyl-PI by PIG-M enzyme; 6, phosphoethanolamine side chain added to Man-GlcN-acyl-PI;
  7 and 8, second and third mannoses added to EtNP-Man-GlcN-acyl-PI; 9, EtNP added
  to third mannose of Man-Man-(EtNP)Man-GlcN-acyl-PI; 10, transamidation transfer
  of C-terminal membrane bound protein precursor to GPI anchor; 11, secretion of GAP
  (by way of Golgi) to plasma membrane. Hatched box: proposed GPI anchor synthesis
  pathway in pnt1 cells (steps 1 to 6′). In the pnt1 mutant, steps 1 to 4 occur as
  in wild-type cells, but in the absence of PNT1 function, the first mannose is not
  added to GlcN-acyl-PI, and GPI-anchor biosynthesis is arrested (step 5′). In the
  absence of a complete GPI anchor, the C-terminal membrane-bound protein precursor
  cannot be transferred to a GPI anchor and is eventually degraded (step 6′). Figure
