caption: 'Model: The kinase IKK may activate Htt degradation by a mammalian version
  of the yeast Cvt pathway. The kinase IKK, activated by inflammatory stimuli, insulin
  signaling, DNA damage and oxidative stress pathways,,–,, Rheb and by PINK/parkin,,
  phosphorylates Htt S13 and activates Htt acetylation by CBP/p300 and caspase cleavage,
  targeting the amino-terminal fragments of Htt for degradation by the proteasome
  and lysosome. IKK reduces interaction of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 with Beclin-1,,, thereby priming
  activation of both starvation-induced and the proposed mammalian Cvt macroautophagic
  pathways. IKK activates JNK1 and CBP/p300 to increase levels of p62/SQSTM1,,,,,
  required for the Cvt pathway and AMPK which may then activate starvation-induced
  macroautophagy as a compensatory feedback mechanism. Mutant Htt expression activates
  IKK. The proposed mammalian Cvt pathway, activated by CBP/p300 or inhibition of
  Sirt1 by nicotinamide, may be involved in vesicle-mediated degradation of phosphorylated/acetylated
  Htt N-terminal fragments by the lysosome. With aging and mutant Htt expression,
  the proteasome and this Cvt-like mechanism of autophagy may become impaired, and
  this loss of function may be compensated for by activation of starvation/rapamycin/AMPK/Sirt1-induced
  macroautophagy.'
