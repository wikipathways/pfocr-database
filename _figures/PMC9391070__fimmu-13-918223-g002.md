caption: 'Effects of high glucose on fibroblast activity and fibrotic function of
  different organs. Several different mechanisms of diabetic fibrosis: 1) the activation
  of neurohumoral pathways, 2) induction and activation of growth factors such as
  TGF–β and platelet–derived growth factors, 3) stimulation of pro–inflammatory cytokines
  such as TNF–α and IL–1β. The main pathway that fibroblasts activate in response
  to high glucose involves ROS production, 4) high glucose can aggravate the damage
  of ROS to cells, promote cell senescence, and cause chronic inflammation and fibrosis.
  Ang II, angiotensin II, ROS, reactive oxygen species, PDGFs, platelet–derived growth
  factors, IL–β, interleukin–β, TNF–α, tumor necrosis factor α.'
