caption: Regulatory components of the adenosinergic signaling pathway. Adenosinergic
  signaling is regulated by multiple molecules inside and outside of cells. In the
  extracellular compartment, ATP and ADP can be hydrolyzed into AMP by CD39. AMP is
  then converted into adenosine by CD73. Extracellular adenosine can either activate
  AR-mediated cellular signaling through G proteins and associated effectors, degrade
  into inosine by ADA, or be transported across the plasma membrane through Na+-independent
  passive nucleoside transporters (i.e., ENTs) or Na+-dependent active nucleoside
  transporters (i.e., CNTs). In the intracellular compartment, ATP can be hydrolyzed
  into ADP and AMP by NDPK and AK, respectively. Intracellular AMP can be further
  converted into adenosine by cN. Intracellular adenosine can either be degraded into
  inosine by ADA, transported to the extracellular compartment, or resynthesized into
  ATP by metabolic enzymes. During the adenosine metabolism process, the elevation
  of the AMP-to-ATP ratio can lead to the activation of AMPK, which further modulates
  mitochondrial homeostasis (e.g., mitochondrial fission/fusion or mitophagy) by changing
  the activity of associated enzymes (e.g., MFF or ULK1). Intracellular adenosine
  is also associated with DNA methylation by negatively regulating transmethylation
  pathways. In this pathway, SAM is demethylated to SAH by DNMTs, which subsequently
  enhances the level of DNA methylation. SAH is then hydrolyzed into adenosine and
  homocysteine by SAHH. Adenosine negatively regulates the activity of SAHH, which
  alters the SAH level and inhibits SAM-dependent DNMT activity. ADA, adenosine deaminase;
  ADK, adenosine kinase; AK, adenylate kinase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase;
