caption: Schematic diagram of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK/STAT3 and Rho pathway in optic
  nerve axon regeneration. In the STAT/JAK signaling pathway, the application of the
  neurotrophic factor CNTF or the removal of SOCS3, a STAT inhibitor, can activate
  the pathway, thereby promoting axon regeneration. Within the mTOR signaling pathway,
  PTEN, TSC1, and AKT act as negative regulators; the knockout of these genes can
  mitigate inhibitory effects and promote axonal regeneration. In contrast, the activation
  of myelin-associated inhibitors and their corresponding receptors initiates the
  Rho/ROCK pathway, resulting in the phosphorylation of multiple substrates and ultimately
  impeding axonal growth
