caption: Metabolism of L-Arginine to produce NO and metabolites involved in the wound
  healing process. Arginine can be catabolized via the NO synthase pathway. Here,
  L-Arginine can be converted to L-ornithine and urea by arginase I. Then, by the
  action of ornithine aminotransferase, ornithine is transformed into proline, which
  is needed for collagen synthesis. L-ornithine can also be converted to polyamines,
  which are required for cell proliferation by ornithine decarboxylase [].
