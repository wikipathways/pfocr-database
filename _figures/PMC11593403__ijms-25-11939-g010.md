caption: 'Characterization of phenotypes in melanoma cell populations resistant to
  dabrafenib or AZ628. This figure illustrates various features of melanoma cell populations
  with respect to signaling pathways, cell cycle regulation, and susceptibility to
  cell death. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK): including tyrosine-protein kinase receptor
  UFO (AXL) and mesenchymal–epithelial transition factor (c-Met). RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling
  pathway: detailing expression levels of V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogenes (RAF)
  including BRAF and CRAF isoforms, as well as total extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases (ERK) expression. Pro-proliferative proteins: including phosphorylation
  levels of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and M-phase inducer phosphatase 3 (pCDC25C),
  along with cyclin D1 and cyclin A2 expression. Apoptosis markers: displaying levels
  of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (cPARP) and mitochondrial carrier homolog
  2 (MTCH2). Ferroptosis markers: highlighting the expression of transferrin and heme
  oxygenase-1 (HO-1), both of which contribute to increased intracellular iron. Levels
  of ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and cystine-glutamate
  antiporter (SLC7A11) are also presented'
