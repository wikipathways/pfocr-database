caption: Neuronal roles of atypical protein kinases (aPKCs).(a) aPKCs mediates nerve
  growth factor (NGF) response. NGF-TrkA-Src pathway stimulates aPKCs-IκB kinase (IKK)
  binding, leading to increase of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells (nuclear factor-κB)-mediated gene transcription. (b) Following N-methyl-D-aspartate
  (NMDA) receptors (NMDAR) stimulation, a series of induction factors upregulate postsynaptic
  aPKCs level. aPKCs increase the surface expression of AMPAR via N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
  factor (NSF)-dependent pathway that triggers LTP. (c) aPKCs are also involved in
  regulation of neuron morphology. Wnt enhances Dvl-aPKC interaction to stimulate
  neurite outgrowth. (d) aPKCs interact with Par3 and Par6 to form the polarity complex,
  which is essential for establishment of neuronal polarity and axon specification.
  (e) Additionally, aPKCs phosphorylate Aurora A at threonine 287 and activate its
  kinase activity. Activated Aurora A promotes microtubule extension during neurite
  outgrowth. (f) aPKCs control hippocampal neurogenesis through CBP-CREB pathway.
  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activates aPKCs through phosphorylation of PKC
  ζ/ι at threonine 410/413, which phosphorylate CBP serine 436 to promote CBP-CREB
  binding and CREB transcriptional activity. (g–j) aPKCs are implicated in neurodegenerative
  diseases. (g) Insulin activates downstream aPKCs to phosphorylate GULP1 threonine
  35 and reduces GULP1-APP interaction. Such phosphorylation suppresses Aβ production
  from APP proteolytic cleavage. (h) aPKCs is implicated in tauopathy by the phosphorylation
  of the tau kinase GSK-3β Ser-9 which inactivates GSK-3β. (i) Elevated aPKCs level
  in ALS mouse model with mutated superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (G93A) may be a protective
  response against mutant SOD1 toxicity. (j) aPKCs protect neuronal cells against
  Aβ-induced apoptosis.
