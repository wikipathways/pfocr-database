caption: 'Factors involved in the ontogeny of fetal Leydig cells. The differentiation
  and steroidogenesis of FLC are regulated by diverse factors derived from Sertoli
  cells, FLC progenitors, FLCs and other interstitial components. The DHH (Desert
  hedgehog) and PDGFα (Platelet-derived growth factor A) are proteins secreted by
  the fetal Sertoli cells that are necessary for FLC ontogeny by inducing the commitment
  of the FLC progenitors through their receptor PTCH1 (Patched1) and PDGFRα (Platelet-derived
  growth factor receptor A), respectively. PDGFα also induces the migration and proliferation
  of FLC progenitors. The KITL (KIT ligand)/KIT (KIT oncogene) signaling is likely
  to be involved in FLC precursor growth and FLC survival. The HGF (Hepatocyte growth
  factor), which is localized in the connective tissue of the interstitial compartment,
  promotes FLC terminal development and protect FLCs from apoptosis. The transcription
  factor ARX (Aristaless-related homeobox) is essential for the establishment of FLC
  progenitors. SF1 (Steroidogenic factor 1, also called NR5A1 or AD4BP), DAX1 (dosage-sensitive
  sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenita, critical region on the X chromosome,
  gene 1, also known as NR0B1 or AHCH) and GATA4 (GATA binding protein 4) also promote
  the differentiation of FLCs, while TCF21 (transcription factor 21, also known as
  POD1) and NOTCH signal pathway maintain the FLC progenitor pool. Sertoli cell transcription
  factor WT1 (Wilms’ tumor 1) and mircoRNA miR-140-3p/5p repress FLC differentiation
  via activating NOTCH signal pathway, while COUP-TF2 (Chicken Ovalbumin Upstream
  Promoter-Transcription Factor 2, also known as NR2F2) likely promotes FLC differentiation
  by repressing NOTCH signal pathway. After the establishment of FLC population during
  fetal testis development, IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), TGFβR3 (Transforming
  growth factor, beta receptor III, also called betaglycan), SF1, MEF2 (Myocyte enhancer
  factor 2), NR4A1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1, also known as
  Nur77, NGFI-B, and TR3) and CRHR1 (Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1) regulate
  the function of FLC, while Sertoli cell factor AMH (anti-Müllerian hormone) is a
  negative regulator of FLC function. Gray color indicates the regulations are inferred
  from ALCs. Abbreviations used: FLC, fetal Leydig cell; BM, basal membrane; DHH,
