caption: Immune regulators in anti-malaria immunity. Anti-malaria immunity is tightly
  regulated by cytosolic and cell surface molecules at multiple levels. Negative regulators
  within cytosol. As a negative molecule binds to MyD88, SOCS-1 can not only suppress
  the NF-κB and MAPKs signaling, but also inhibits MyD88-mediated IFN-I signaling.
  MARCH1 can reduce IFN-I through increasing expression of SOCS-1. Besides, its target
  proteins, MAVS, STING, and TBK1, possibly are degraded through ubiquitination. FOSL1
  inhibits the K63 ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRIF and disrupts TBK1/TRAF3/TRIF complexes
  formation, which results in reduced phosphorylation of IRF3 and suppresses IFN-I
  production. RTP4 inhibits the expression of TBK1 and IRF3 and/or activation by binding
  with TBK1 to reduce IFN-I production. Negative regulators on the cell membrane.
  Binding of ICAM1 and PfEMP leads to static adhesion of parasite and evades immune
  clearance. LAG3 inhibits T cell responses and antibody secreting B cell responses.
  CTLA-4 expressed on activated T cells could suppress the CD4+ Th and humoral immune
  responses. TIM3 can inhibit T lymphocytes, NK cells, and macrophages responses.
  TIGIT proteins mainly suppress the function of T cell and NK cell. The activation
  of PD-1 pathway dramatically inhibits TCR-mediated proliferation and function of
  T cells. Positive regulators on the cell membrane. CD40 could compete with STING
  to bind TRAF2/3 and/or TRAF6 to reduce STING ubiquitination, which leads to increased
  expression of IFN-I. CD28 can enhance CD4+ T cell responses, but the CD28-B7 signals
  can also be inhibited by BTNL2. OX40 enhances Plasmodium specific CD4 T cell activity.
  B220 expressed on the surface of B and T cells can help promoting the maturation
  of both T and B cell.
