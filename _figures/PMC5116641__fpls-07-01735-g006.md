caption: A conceptual model how soil S status affects GSL accumulation in Brassica
  crops. Under S deficiency, the SLIM1 TF can down regulate the expression of key
  GSL biosynthesis enzymes (MAMS, CYP79Bs, and CYP83Bs) and MYB TFs (; ). Further
  investigation needed to understand the complete picture of regulation of MYBs targeting
  indole GSL biosynthesis (MYB34, MYB51, MYB 122) and aliphatic GSL synthesis (MYB28,
  MYB 29, MYB76) by SLIM1 under different S conditions. In contrast, under S deficient
  conditions SLIM1 can also upregulate the expression of SULTRs and miR395, as well
  as the GSL hydrolysis enzyme (myrosinase) (). In addition, upregulation of miR395
  via SLIM1 under S deficiency can increase the expression of SULTRs and lead to enhanced
  uptake of sulfate from soil. SLIM1 can also down-regulate the expression of ATPS
  in the first step of S assimilation () which can affect the availability of Cys
  and PAPS for GSL biosynthesis. Sulfur deficiency has been suggested as a negative
  regulator of SOTs, C-S lyases, GST and AOPs enzymes of the GSL biosynthesis pathway
  (), although additional signaling molecules may be involved in this regulation.
  Moreover, we would expect the presence of additional signaling molecules and TFs,
  which can regulate both systems (S assimilation and GSL biosynthesis) under S deficiency
  or varying S levels of the primary source (soil). As seeds are the ultimate sink
  for GSLs, optimizing the external application of S fertilizer and identifying the
  role of tissue-specific genes of GSL biosynthesis under different S levels would
  provide scope for manipulation of seed GSL levels in brassicas. Primary and secondary
  sources and sinks for S and GSLs are shown as indicated as in Figure . Shapes in
  green indicate sources and sinks related to the sulfate system whereas shapes in
  blue indicate the GSL system. Rectangular shapes indicate primary sources, triangles
  indicate secondary sources whereas stars indicate primary sinks and diamonds indicate
  secondary sinks.
