caption: Representative inflammatory mechanisms leading to NETosis. Neutrophils are
  activated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) through binding with Toll-like receptor (TLR) or IgG-Fc
  receptors, with consequent release of Ca2+ by the ER. The cytoplasmic increase of
  Ca2+ activates the protein Kinase-C (PKC) through the RAF–MEK–MAPK/ERK pathway,
  a critical intracellular signaling pathway that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation,
  survival, and apoptosis. Ca2+ influx and PKC activation have pivotal roles in stimulating
  NADPH oxidase activity on the cell surface, promoting the production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROSs). The increase in ROSs induces the release of enzymes such
  as neutrophil elastase (NE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). These, together with peptidyl
  arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) are commonly localized in the nucleus and involved in
  chromatin decondensation. The NET produced from neutrophils is therefore composed
  of DNA, histones, other nuclear components, and intracellular enzymes such as NE
  and MPO
