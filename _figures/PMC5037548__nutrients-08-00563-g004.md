caption: Apoptosis signaling pathways induced by icariin and icariside II. Icariin
  and icariside II induce apoptosis of tumor cells through two pathways, extrinsic
  (receptor-mediated) pathway and intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) pathway. The binding
  of TNF-α with TNFR1 leads to the formation of TRADD and RIP, then the two factors
  combine with FADD and procaspase-8, which are resulted from FasL/FasR pathway, leading
  to the formation of death inducing signaling complex (DISC) and activating caspase-8.
  Activated caspase-8 stimulates the downstream caspase-3 and PARP, resulting in apoptosis,
  or cleaves Bid, which is the link between extrinsic pathway and intrinsic pathway,
  leading to the activation of intrinsic pathway. The cellular stress, activation
  of t-Bid, or modulation of Bax/Bcl-2 result in the downregulation of mitochondrial
  membrane potential and subsequent release of cytochrome c. Once released to cytosol,
  cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1, resulting in the activation of caspase-9, which
  then activates caspase-3 resulting in cell death. Activation of NF-κB leads to the
  activation of several anti-apoptotic factors, which subsequently block the mitochondria-mediated
  pathway. Tumor cells produce ROS at higher levels, leading to the activation of
  p38 and p53, and subsequent apoptosis, (← activation; ⊥ inhibition).
