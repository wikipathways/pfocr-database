caption: 'Ang/Tie pathway regulation of vascular stability. In the absence of inflammation
  or infection (stable vasculature), Ang1 is secreted by mesenchymal cells (, ) and
  low levels of autocrine Ang2 are constitutively secreted (). Binding of Angs to
  Tie2 promotes the interaction of Tie1 and Tie2 in a β1 integrin-dependent manner
  and regulates Ang-induced Tie2 trafficking to cell–cell junctions (, ). Under these
  conditions, endothelial Tie1 enhances the activity of Ang1 and is essential for
  Ang2 agonistic activity (, ). Oligomerized Ang1 also induces the translocation of
  Tie2 to cell–cell contacts and induces an Ang1-bridged Tie2 trans-association ().
  The resulting phosphorylation of Tie2 leads to the activation a number of downstream
  signaling pathways that are involved in vessel stability and endothelial barrier
  function. Activation of the downstream serine kinase, AKT, leads to the phosphorylation
  and nuclear exclusion of FOXO1, and repression of its target genes which include
  Ang2 (–). Ang1 inhibition of NF-κB reporter gene activity via activation of ABIN2
  dampens the expression of adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines (, ),
  preventing further activation of the endothelium through localized inflammatory
  mediators. In parallel, Ang/Tie2 signaling stimulates the transcriptional activity
  of MEF2 through the PI3K/AKT pathway to induce the expression of a second transcription
  factor KFL2 to ultimately counteract VEGF-mediated vascular permeability (↑eNOS
  expression; ↓VEGFR2 and ET-1 expression) (). The increase in NO generated by eNOS
  combined with the negative regulation of Ang2 expression during quiescence significantly
  reduces luminal concentrations of Ang2 (). In addition, KFL2 induces miR-30 expression,
  further blocking the transcription of Ang2 (). The phosphorylation of Src, which
  generally culminates in the phosphodependent internalization of VE-cadherin, is
  also inhibited by Ang1/Tie2. Signaling through Ang1 leads to the activation of mDia,
  resulting in the sequestration of Src, and prevention of subsequent phosphorylation
  by VEGFR2 (). At cell–cell junctions, Ang1/Tie2 also blocks VEGF signaling by promoting
  the interaction of VEGFR2 with VE-PTP (). Lastly, activation of Tie2 can lead to
  the activation of the GTPase, Rac1, via IQGAP (), Rap1 (), or PI3K/Akt ()-dependent
  pathways to stabilize the cortical actin cytoskeleton and maintain adherens and
  tight junctions between cells (). In the presence of LPS, activation of the RhoA-specific
  GTPase activating protein, p190RhoGAP, by Rac1, is essential for shifting the balance
  away from RhoA rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and preventing vascular permeability
