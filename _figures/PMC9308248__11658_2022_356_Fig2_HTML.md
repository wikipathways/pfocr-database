caption: Loss of CAV-1 and myofibroblast differentiation. a In the cell membrane of
  normal fibroblasts, many CAV-1 molecules are located in the lipid raft. These cells
  mainly depend on the OXPHOS pathway for energy production due to the high number
  of mitochondria. b Exposure to ROS in the TME increases autophagy and loss of CAV-1.
  Lack of mitochondria shifts metabolism towards glycolysis, and lactate generation
  drives myofibroblast differentiation. c Catabolic CAFs tend to couple with anabolic
  cancer cells in a metabolic compartment. Anabolic cancer cells have mitochondrial
  reach cytoplasm and deeply depend on OXPHOS. This phenomenon is known as “the reverse
  Warburg effect.” CAV Caveolin, MCT monocarboxylate transporter, OXPHOS oxidation
  phosphorylation
