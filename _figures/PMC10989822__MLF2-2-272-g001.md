caption: An overview of the central metabolic pathway of Ca. Baizosediminiarchaeum
  ligniniphilus. The process of O‐demethylation of guaiacol is accompanied by the
  fixation of carbon dioxide and the production of acetate. Yellow rectangles of varied
  shades show different gene transcription levels and blue rectangles of different
  shades show whether the relevant proteins were detected in the proteomics. Below
  the pathway is the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) estimated for the overall equation. FPKM,
  fragments per kilo base of transcript per million fragments mapped.
