caption: Model of cell mechanisms by which MPLA prevents inhibition of  absorption
  by LPS in the MTAL. MPLA activates a basolateral TLR4-TRIF-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway
  that prevents LPS-induced activation of ERK through TLR4 and MyD88. This, in turn,
  prevents ERK-mediated inhibition of NHE3 and  absorption (). §The precise molecular
  mechanism underlying the inhibitory signaling interaction is undetermined but may
  involve MPLA-induced Akt-dependent activation of intracellular molecules that negatively
  regulate the TLR4-MyD88 pathway (see text for details). Arrows do not necessarily
  imply direct relationships; regulatory steps may involve additional signaling components.
