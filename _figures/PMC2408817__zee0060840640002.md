caption: Schematic representation of integrated PR activation. Unliganded PR is present
  as an inactive complex associated with heat-shock proteins (HSP) and chaperone proteins
  (p29, p56). In the classical ligand-dependent pathway, P and other progestins bind
  to the PR, resulting in conformational change, dissociation of HSP and chaperone
  proteins, dimerization of the receptor, and binding to the hormone response element
  (HRE) in the target DNA. The P-induced conformational change facilitates the recruitment
  of cofactors and other general transcription factors (GTFs) to the promoter, producing
  a transcriptionally active complex that can direct gene transcription. Compounds
  such as cyclic nucleotides, neurotransmitters (NTs), growth factors (GFs), neurosteroids,
  and other environmental signals can activate second messengers and protein kinase
  pathways to activate PR and/or coactivators in a ligand-independent manner. Depending
  upon the activating stimulus, PRs can dimerize as homodimers (A:A, B:B) or heterodimers
  (A:B) and upon binding to HRE can recruit distinct sets of coactivators, leading
  to transcriptional activation of distinct subsets of genes.
