caption: 'Evolutionary conservation of the insulin signalling pathway in model organisms.
  The binding of insulin or insulin-like ligands to the insulin receptor (IR) initiates
  a cascade of phosphorylation events resulting in the activation of AKT, which in
  turn regulates the downstream transcription factor FOXO. The termination of this
  signal transduction is mediated by phosphatases, which dephosphorylate and thereby
  inhibit the respective key players, such as AKT. The insulin signalling pathway
  is highly conserved between invertebrate and mammalian model organisms: the nematode
  worm C. elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the mouse. Some notable
  differences include the number of insulin and insulin-like ligands, with only 3
  identified in mammals (insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2), while worms and flies contain
  ~40 and 8, respectively. In contrast, downstream components of the signalling cascade
  (including the IR itself, AKT and FOXO) are less redundant in invertebrates. This
  provides an advantage to study the functionality of these components under different
  conditions without potential compensatory effects from paralogues.'
