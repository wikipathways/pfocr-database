caption: Proposed mechanism of protective effects of CA against d-gal and AlCl3 induced
  neurotoxicity in rats, via the inhibition of GSK-3β and enhancing the expression
  of PP2A in the hippocampus of the rats. d-gal/AlCl3 enhances phosphorylation of
  tau protein, which leads to paired helical forms (PHFs) formation and subsequently
  aggregates to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), eventually leading to the death
  of the neuron. CA blocks the action of GSK-3β and enhances the activities of PP2A.
