caption: Schematic summary of hippocampal formation alterations in the IR→IRS-1→PI3K→Akt→mTOR
  signaling pathway of AD dementia cases versus age- and gender-matched controls.
  Total protein levels of the signaling molecules IR, IRS-1, Akt, GSK-3, mTOR, and
  PKCλ/ζ, as well as the insulin signaling regulators ERK2, IKK, and JNK (see  for
  abbreviations) were normal in AD. In contrast, activated or suppressed forms of
  these molecules (identified in ) were altered in AD. (A) AD alterations in 1-nmol/L
  insulin-stimulated responses normally activating or suppressing insulin signaling
  molecules, including ERK2, which is activated by insulin via Grb2, not IRS-1. Note
  that insulin responsiveness in AD is reduced at all levels of the signaling pathway
  studied and is associated with reduced binding of IRS-1 to the IR and to a regulatory
  subunit of PI3K (p85α). (B) AD alterations in activated or suppressed forms of insulin
  signaling or regulating molecules without insulin stimulation. All these molecules
  are activated forms, except for IRS-1 pS and GSK-3 pS, which are suppressed forms.
  The question mark (?) reflects uncertainty regarding IR pY1150/1151 stemming from
  data based on an antibody recognizing these phosphorylation sites on both IR and
  IGF-1R. IRS-1 inhibition by serine (S) phosphorylation 312, 616, and 636/639 results
  from elevated basal activation of Akt, ERK2, IKK, JNK, mTOR, and PKCλ/ζ. Decreased
  insulin-induced phosphorylation of molecules below the IR probably reflects their
  high basal levels of phosphorylation shown in (A), which limits further phosphorylation
  upon insulin stimulation. (Adapted from Talbot et al. []).
