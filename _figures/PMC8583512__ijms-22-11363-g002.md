caption: 'The possible mechanism of BAMPs in antifungal, antiviral, and anticancer
  activities. (A) The antifungal activity of BAMPs. The antifungal mechanisms of BAMPs
  are divided into the following categories: (a) BAMPs destroy the membrane permeability
  through electrostatic interaction with the membrane surface. (b) BAMPs affect membrane
  structure or in vivo signaling pathways by interacting with lipids such as phospholipids
  and sphingolipids on fungal membranes. (c) BAMPs interact with fungal cell wall
  components such as glucan and chitin, thus inhibiting cell wall formation and pathogen
  growth. (d) BAMPs act on intracellular targets and participate in cellular signaling
  pathways, including ROS production, programmed cell death, cell cycle arrest, autophagy,
  the CWI (cell wall integrity) pathway, the MAPK pathway, and so on. (B) The antiviral
  activity of BAMPs. The replication cycle of the virus during infection is roughly
  divided into four steps: (a) By recognition and binding to receptors, viruses attach
  to and fuse with the host membrane. (b) Virus uncoating and release of nucleic acid.
  (c) Viral genome replication and protein synthesis. (d) Assembly and release of
  virus particles. During virus replication, BAMPs inhibit virus proliferation and
  transmission by destroying virus envelope, inhibiting the interaction between capsid
  proteins with host cell surface receptors, blocking the expression of virus gene,
  and preventing the assembly and release of virus particles. (C) The anticancer activity
  of BAMPs. Obvious differences exist in normal and tumor cells, including the charge
  and receptors on the membrane. On the one hand, BAMPs can especially kill cancer
  through membrane dissolution; on the other hand, BAMPs regulate angiogenesis, apoptosis,
  autophagy, cell cycle, and other biological processes which are critical to tumor
  proliferation and migration after binding to receptors.'
