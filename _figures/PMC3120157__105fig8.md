caption: 'Model of interactions of RasACT-cooperating genes: genetic epistasis tests
  reveal a possible model of how the RasACT-cooperating genes may function in a pathway
  to lead to the upregulation of JNK in the ey-GAL4 system. Expression of RasACT alone
  via ey-GAL4 leads to hyperplasia. Pathways shown in black lead to increased hyperplasia,
  while those in red lead to differentiation defects and morphological changes, which
  we propose is due to higher levels of Rho1 and JNK signaling. Proteins shown in
  green are hypothesized to be required for the effects, on the basis of information
  in other systems (see text). Since JNK is required, but not sufficient, to cooperate
  with ey>RasACT, we hypothesize that other factors (X or Y) are altered by Rho1 or
  Rac1 signaling to enable cooperation with RasACT. Whether knockdown of Dlg or activation
  of aPKC requires Pbl or RhoGEF2 is not known (indicated by ?). See text for further
  details.'
