caption: The metabolic pathway of ceramide. De novo synthesis (purple) takes place
  in the endoplasmic reticulum, L-serine and Palmitoyl-CoA are catalyzed by serine
  palmitoyltransferase (which has a specific inhibitor-Myriocin) to produce 3-Ketosphinganine,
  which is then converted to sphinganine by 3-Ketosphinganine reductase. Six kinds
  of CerSs (CerS4 and CerS2 dominates in cardiomyocyte) then further synthesize the
  sphinganine into dihydroceramide, which are then reduced by dihydroceramide desaturase
  to produce ceramides of different acyl chain lengths. Ceramide can also be generated
  through the slave pathway (green) on the cell membrane or be transported to the
  Golgi apparatus and degraded by acid ceramide into sphingosine.
