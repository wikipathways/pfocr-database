caption: 'A schema of sortilin regulating EGFR trafficking (). Sortilin is mainly
  localized at the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). (A) Endocytosis:
  under normal circumstances, sortilin is essential for EGFR sorting in EGFR endocytosis
  (B) Exocytosis: upon ligand binding, cell surface EGFRs are activated and internalized,
  and then either sorted at the early endosome (EE) or cycled continually between
  the surface of plasma membrane and the TGN via endocytosis and exocytosis. (C) EGFR
  signaling: the most known EGFR ligand is EGF, which activates the phosphorylation
  of EGFR tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling pathways, including the Ras/Raf/MEK-ERK/MAP
  kinase, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and JAK/STAT pathways, for cell growth, survival, migration,
  anti-apoptosis, and promoting angiogenesis. Loss of sortilin expression results
  in failure of EGFR receptor internalization which leads to prolonged or continuous
  activation of EGFR signaling cascade, enhanced cell proliferation and/or survival,
  invasion, metastasis, and poor clinical outcomes. The fate of EGFR has important
  consequences for biological cell outputs: the recycling pathway favoring cell proliferation
  while the degradative pathway controlling normal cellular homeostasis. Several reported
  key regulators for each process were listed within this figure (). Additionally,
  EGFR may translocate to the nucleus and mitochondria although the transport mechanisms
  remain to be elucidated. EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor
  receptor; ESCRT, endosomal sorting complex required for transport; MVBs, multivesicular
  bodies; TGN, the trans-Golgi network.'
