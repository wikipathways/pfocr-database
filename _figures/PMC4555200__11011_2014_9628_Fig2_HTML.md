caption: 'Glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle: Glucose is the preferred substrate
  for the brain, although the brain can take up lactate, other monocarboxylic acids
  and ketone bodies under certain circumstances, for example, during the perinatal
  period. Once it enters cells, glucose is metabolised through glycolysis to pyruvate.
  Glycolysis (also termed Embden-Meyerhof pathway) is the series of reactions that
  results in the breakdown of glucose, generating pyruvate, adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). It is a truly fundamental pathway,
  found throughout nature and proceeds without the need for oxygen. The ten key enzymatic
  steps, in which 2 ATP molecules are consumed early on but then paid back later with
  the generation of 4 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, so the net production of
  ATP is 2 molecules per molecule of glucose, takes place in the cytoplasm. There
  are three key regulatory points catalysed by the enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase,
  and pyruvate kinase. These reactions are essentially irreversible whereas the other
  enzymatic steps exist in equilibrium. Pyruvate is converted to acetyl CoA, which
  enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, within mitochondria. The TCA cycle results
  in the transfer of electrons (from NADH and succinate), to electron transport chains
  (ETC.) located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which ultimately deposit on
  oxygen molecules. Thus the TCA cycle generates carbon dioxide (also generated by
  the pyruvate dehydrogenase step prior to TCA cycle) and the ETC generates water.
  The ETCs pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, maintaining a gradient
  of protons across the membrane. Protons then flow down their concentration gradient,
  through ATP synthetases (ATPase), resulting in the generation of ATP, the cells’
  widely used energy currency. Energy production from glucose is intrinsically related
  to neurotransmission. Glutamate spins off the TCA cycle from α-ketoglutarate (αKG),
  an intermediate of the TCA cycle. Glutamate can be converted reversibly into glutamine.
  Glutamate can also be converted into gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). There is a
  constant cycle of glutamate released during neurotransmission, retrieved from synaptic
  junctions by astrocytes and returned to neurons as glutamine'
