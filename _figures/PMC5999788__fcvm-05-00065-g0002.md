caption: Integration of actions of PKD1 and PKD3 in cardiac energy metabolism—a hypothetical
  scheme. Several stimuli induce activation of PKDs in cardiomyocytes. Endothelin,
  growth factors and α-adrenergic agonists activate distinct members of the family
  of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), leading to sarcolemmal phospholipase C activation
  and subsequent increases in diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ca2+. DAG, as part of the canonical
  PKD1 activation pathway, binds to PKD1 thereby bringing it to the sarcolemma for
  further activation by PKCs. From there, the activated PKD1 migrates either to the
  nucleus or to endosomes. Please note that the sarcolemmal activation step of the
  cytoplasmic PKD1 pool is not displayed. In the nucleus, PKD1 phosphorylates the
  histone deacetylases (HDAC)5 and HDAC7. HDAC5 phosphorylation results in release
  and activation of the hypertrophic transcription factor MEF2. HDAC7 phosphorylation
  leads to binding to and inhibition of FOXO1, thereby depressing CD36 expression
  and cellular fatty acid uptake. In the cytosol, DAG stimulates PKD1 to migrate to
  the endosomes to acutely stimulate GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake. Increased
  Ca2+ stimulates calcineurin-induced upregulation of PKD3 and activation of three
  additional hypertrophic transcription factors (GATA, NFAT, and NKx). PKD3 also regulates
  sarcolemmal GLUT1 localization. An increase in physical work (contractile activity)
  increases mitochondrial formation of ROS as by-product of elevated oxidative phosphorylation
  flux. DAPK migrates to the endosomes to activate the endosomally resident PKD1 pool
  to initiate vesicle-mediated GLUT4 translocation. DAPK, as well as Abl/Src may stimulate
  phosphorylation of myofilament proteins thereby further stimulating contractile
  activity. mROS production activates the Ser/Thr-kinase DAPK and the Tyr-kinases
  Abl and Src. For clarity, the effects of the PKD are divided into acute (signaling,
  metabolism and contraction; left part of figure) and chronic (nuclear; right part
  of figure). It is of importance to note that PKD1 and PKD3 integrate cardiac metabolism
  with contraction and also with remodeling. In case of integration of metabolism
  with contraction (as occurs upon an acute increase in workload), PKD1 activation
  ensures that the increase in contractility occurs hand in hand with increased glucose
  uptake. If the workload transcends from acute into chronic (as occurs upon chronic
  pressure overload), the PKDs are also needed for integration of metabolism with
  remodeling. Specifically, chronically elevated GLUT4 translocation and elevated
  GLUT1 expression together lead to increased glucose uptake and subsequent O-GlcNAcylation
  of myocellular proteins including the hypertrophic transcription factors. Together,
  the PKD1/PKD3-mediated direct activation of the transcription factors and the PKD1/PKD3
  mediated O-GlcNAcylation and further activation of the transcription factors may
  lead to full-blown hypertrophic cardiac remodeling.
