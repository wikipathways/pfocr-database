caption: Previous work has established that inhibition of HMGCR with a statin drug
  significantly reduces eosinophilic airway inflammation and AHR in experimental allergic
  asthma. To further elucidate the role of the FTase arm of the MA pathway in mediating
  type 2/Th2 inflammation, we utilized FTI-277 to inhibit FTase enzyme activity. GGTase
  and squalene synthase are the alternate arms of the MA pathway but were not assessed
  in this study. The chemical structure of the FTase inhibitor FTI-277 (a Ras CaaX
  motif peptidomimetic) is shown in the inset.
