caption: The PKR pathway. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) resulting from a viral infection
  triggers interferon production. Interferon is a transciptional inducer of a number
  of genes including the protein kinase, RNA activated (PKR). The viral dsRNA also
  activates PKR through its two RNA binding motifs. Active PKR catalyzes phosphorylation
  of eIF-2 at serine 51 of its α subunit. The phosphorylated eIF-2 forms a complex
  with eIF-2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the trapped eIF-2B is inactive.
  Failure to exchange bound GDP for GTP prevents eIF-2 from participating in translation
  initiation, resulting in a global inhibition of protein synthesis. If this pathway
  is effective, the infected host cell would perish, but viral replication and spread
  to other host cells would be aborted. Various viruses possess countermeasures to
  prevent either PKR activation or the phosphorylation of eIF-2.
