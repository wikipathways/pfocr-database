caption: Inhibitory mechanism of Spred and Sprouty proteins on the Ras–MAPK pathway.
  SPRED proteins down-regulate Ras signaling by recruiting RasGAP, neurofibromin to
  the membrane. SPRED loss primarily activates Ras–MAPK signaling though Ras activates
  other pathways such as PI3K, PLC-ε, and RAL-GDS. Sprouty proteins down-regulate
  Ras signaling by sequestering Grb2 and preventing the membrane recruitment of RasGEF,
  SOS, and by inhibiting Raf kinase activity.
