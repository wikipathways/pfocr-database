caption: The proteasome has several roles in AML. The primary function of the proteasome
  is the proteolytic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. In AML, phosphorylation
  of IκBα targets this regulatory protein for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
  Degradation of IκBα liberates NF-κB, allowing this transcription factor to translocate
  to the nucleus and promote the expression of pro-survival and proliferative gene
  products, including TNFα. Among other actions, TNFα binds to the tumor necrosis
  factor receptor and drives an autocrine signaling pathway, promoting further IκBα
  phosphorylation and creating a positive-feedback loop that reinforces NF-κB activity.
  Inhibition of proteasome activity by agents such as bortezomib or carfilzomib both
  disrupt this cycle, leading to cell death, and also induce other cellular mechanisms
  of protein degradation, such as autophagy. AML cells treated with bortezomib can
  sequester cytosolic proteins within membrane-bound vesicles called autophagosomes.
  These proteins, including the cancer-related proteins FLT3 and TRAF6, are then delivered
  to the lysosome for oxidative degradation.
