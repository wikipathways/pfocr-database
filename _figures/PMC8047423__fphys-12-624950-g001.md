caption: The complex regulation of HSC – and possibly hibernators – cell cycle entry.
  Cyclin-CDK complexes drive the progression of the cell cycle. Their inhibition forces
  entry into quiescence from G1 into the G0 phase of the cell, mainly by the action
  of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI) from the INK and CIP/KIP family. Various
  pathways converge on the CKIs, thus instituting quiescence. Low activity of the
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is vital to enter quiescence, mainly through the inhibition
  of cyclin-D-CDK4/6 complexes and suppression of the Rb-E2F pathway. This pathway
  is massively regulated, primarily through inhibition by the tumor suppressors phosphatase
  and tensin homolog (PTEN) and tuberous sclerosis proteins 1 and 2 (TSC1/2). Furthermore,
  the activity of the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes is inhibited both by the Ink4 and
  CIP/KIP CKIs. The Cyclin E-CDK2 complex regulates progression from the G1 to the
  S phase, and it is mainly regulated by the CIP/KIP family of CKIs, as well as by
  tumor suppressors from the retinoblastoma protein family (Rb, p107, p130). Extrinsic
  signals activate the transcription factors HES1, JunB and FOXO3a expression, which
  in turn regulate the transcription of the CIP/KIP family members. Moreover, entry
  into cellular quiescence is also subject to regulation via the tumor suppressor
  p53, as a response to cellular damage. Solid arrows indicate direct activation pathways,
  solid T-lines indicate inhibitory pathways and dashed arrows indicate transcriptional
  regulation activity.
