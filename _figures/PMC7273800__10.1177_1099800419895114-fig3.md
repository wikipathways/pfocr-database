caption: Gene–gene networks generated by pathway analysis from the 17-gene set. The
  main associated functions of networks are (A) connective-tissue development and
  function, skeletal- and muscular-system development and function, and tissue development
  and (B) lipid metabolism, small-molecule biochemistry, and vitamin and mineral metabolism.
  Genes identified from the literature are shaded. Solid lines represent direct interactions.
  Dashed lines represent indirect interactions. The Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis networks
