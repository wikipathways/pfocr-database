caption: 'Model for negative regulation of junctional stability in RPE by the PI3K–ROS
  circuit. Intact AJs are composed of multiple proteins. E-cadherin–β-catenin complexes
  localize to the center of AJs and recruit structural proteins and enzymes that provide
  the functionalities responsible for junctional dynamics. E-cadherin–β-catenin can
  also interact with the EGFR, which, like Src tyrosine kinase, can phosphorylate
  β-catenin (), causing it to dissociate from E-cadherin (). EGFR also exerts a junction-destabilizing
  signal through PI3K (), which not only activates Akt-dependent cell proliferation
  and survival signaling cascades () but also stimulates ROS production, at least
  in part through NADPH oxidase (). Elevated levels of ROS might inactivate junctional
  protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) or PTEN directly, by oxidizing them, or
  indirectly, by inducing their phosphorylation (). Through this series of events,
  EGFR has the potential to dissociate local AJ structures (above dashed line). However,
  cellular antioxidants might act to antagonize the persistent elevation of ROS and
  stop the spread of junctional dissolution. PTEN also reduces the levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3,
  thus inhibiting the PI3K-activated signaling cascades (below dashed line). This
  push-and-pull dynamic between PI3K and PTEN results in a localized equilibrium of
  junctional remodeling in cells of the RPE. However, this balance could start to
  unravel as ROS accumulate as a result of mitochondrial metabolic dysfunctions or
  an overload of oxidized photoreceptor components. Upon ROS-induced inactivation
  of PTEN and the consequent accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the PI3K signaling pathways
  could enter a positive-feedback loop, causing continuous generation of ROS. Once
  the balance is disrupted, the junction-destabilizing signaling pathway might be
  amplified and all junctions at the lateral zone of cell–cell adhesions might become
  involved in the dissociation process, leading to disruption of the RPE-supported
  BRB. Abbreviations: MAGI, membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW- and PDZ-domain-containing;
  oxPUFA, oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acid.'
