caption: Mechanism of mitophagy in different physiological and pathological contexts
  and mitophagy regulating cell death pathway. Mitophagy plays an important role in
  maintaining mitochondria homeostasis and various aspects of cellular function. Under
  physiological conditions, NIX-mediated mitophagy is required for mitochondrial removal
  during erythroblast differentiation. When in response to mitochondrial stressors,
  such as membrane depolarization, mitochondrial complex dysfunction, mutagenic stress,
  and proteotoxicity, distinct mitophagy pathways cooperate to regulate mitochondrial
  homeostasis. Nix can interplay with Rheb, an important protein for mitophagy, to
  initiate mitophagy. Nix also functions downstream of Parkin as a substrate. In addition,
  BNIP3 is able to inhibit PINK1 proteolytic degradation to facilitate Parkin mitochondrial
  recruitment and mitophagy. Upon mitochondrial depolarization, Mcl-1, as a mitophagy
  receptor, underwent rapid PINK1/Parkin-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation.
  AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy is also dependent on Parkin. These findings suggest that
  these pathways cooperate with each other to ensure efficient mitophagy. With overwhelming
  mitochondrial damage, the cell death pathway (necrosis, apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis
  and necroptosis) becomes dominant, and mitophagy could prevent the accumulation
  of dysfunctional mitochondria by regulating the cell death pathway.
