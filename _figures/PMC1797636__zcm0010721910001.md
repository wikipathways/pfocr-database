caption: 'Biosynthesis of pyruvate and its end products in “amitochondriate” protozoan
  parasites. (a) Synthesis of pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate in G. intestinalis,
  E. histolytica, and T. vaginalis. CPT, carboxyphosphotransferase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase
  (oxaloacetate to malate); ME, malic enzyme (decarboxylating, malate to pyruvate);
  Pi, inorganic phosphate; PPi, inorganic pyrophosphate. Solid arrows indicate a pathway
  that is optional in all three protists, while a pathway that generally plays a major
  role in the conversion of PEP to pyruvate is represented by dotted arrows for E.
  histolytica and G. intestinalis and by dashed arrows for T. vaginalis. (b) Metabolic
  pathways from pyruvate to its end products under anaerobic, microaerophilic, or
  aerobic conditions in E. histolytica and G. intestinalis. AT, alanine aminotransferase;
  GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; KOR, 2-keto acid oxidoreductase; NO, NADH oxidase;
  ACS, acetyl-CoA synthase; ADHE, acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (NAD dependent);
  ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP dependent); NPR, nitroperoxiredoxin or ferredoxin
  nitroreductase; Fd-ox, oxidized ferredoxin; Fd-rd, reduced ferredoxin. Acetate is
  the major product under aerobic conditions, while ethanol or alanine is preferentially
  produced under microaerophilic or strict anaerobic conditions, respectively. Note
  that ADHE is a fusion protein of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase.
  #, enzymes demonstrated only in G. intestinalis.'
