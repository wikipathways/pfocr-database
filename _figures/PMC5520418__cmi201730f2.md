caption: PTEN functions in T-cell development, activation and differentiation. (a)
  Deletion of PTEN in thymocytes affects V-DJ feedback inhibition during β-selection;
  (b) PTEN affects T-cell differentiation. PTEN knock-out in early stages will lead
  to peripheral lymphomas and autoimmunity; (c) PTEN knockout damages the helper function
  of CD4+T cells; (d) In PTEN-deleted T cells, TCR stimulation alone, without CD28
  co-stimulation, is sufficient to induce the hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway
  and to enhance IL-2 production; (e) Upregulation of PTEN expression provides an
  inhibition signal to reduce IL-2R signaling pathway activation after IL-2 binding;
  (f) Deletion of PTEN inhibits the development and the survival of memory CD8+ T
  cells.
