caption: A model for the role of the eIF2α/ATF4 signaling pathway in the transcriptional
  activation of autophagy genes. The mode by which each gene is regulated is indicated
  in parenthesis. Three classes of autophagy genes have been identified according
  to their dependence on ATF4 and CHOP and the binding of these factors to the promoter.

  expression.
