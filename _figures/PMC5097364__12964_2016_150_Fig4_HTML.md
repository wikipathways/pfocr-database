caption: T3-actions from genomic and non-genomic effects on cell adhesion and differentiation
  during vertebrate development. THs modulate energy metabolism, growth and development
  by independent mechanisms. While thyroid calorigenesis is influenced predominantly
  via nuclear receptors, many of the TH effects over development are thought to be
  mediated via cytosolic and membrane partners. E-cadherin trans-interaction triggers
  activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt–protein kinase B pathway
  bound to β-catenin, generating phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3),
  recruitment of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, activation of Rac1 or Cdc42
  and Akt, and reduction of Rho activation. In addition, TRα or TRβ forms a cytoplasmic
  complex with the p85 subunit of PI3K, inducing protein kinaseB/Akt nuclear translocation
  and inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through its interaction and consequent
  sequestration of β-catenin. The process results in down-regulation of cell proliferation.
  Simultaneously, TH binding to TRs causes heterodimerization with retinoid X receptors
  (RXRs), binding to T3 response elements located within the genomic regions and shooting
  target gene transcription. In the absence of T3, TRs interact with co-repressor
  proteins to inhibit target gene transcription. Following T3 binding, co-repressors
  are displaced and co-activator proteins are recruited to the ligand-bound TR complex,
  facilitating T3-dependent activation of the target genes. Besides the TR-mediated
  functions, THs also exert rapid non-genomic actions that are initiated at the cell
  membrane. Integrin αvβ3 is a specific membrane receptor for THs, which mediate activation
  of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intracellular cascade. TH-dependent
  MAPK activation subsequently results in modulation of the membrane potential by
  regulation of ion channels, activation of the Na+/K+ exchanger and Ca2+ATPase, or
  regulation of actin cytoskeletal components anchored at the cell membrane. TH-activated
  MAPK, in turn, can rapidly translocate to the nucleus inducing serine phosphorylation
  of TRs, thereby resulting in the induction of angiogenesis or tumor cell proliferation.
  Nuclear targets for phosphorylated TRs include the transcription factors p53, STAT1a
  and STAT3
