caption: Metabolic pathway of homocysteine. Homocysteine is produced through transmethylation
  of methionine. It is metabolised into cysteine by vitamin B6 (B6)–dependent cystathionine
  β-synthase (CBS). Remethylation of homocysteine to methionine occurs in a folate
  dependent pathway (that is catalysed by vitamin B12 (B12) dependent methionine synthase
  (MS) with involving folate dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR))
  or a folate independent pathway (that is catalysed by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT). 5-MTHF indicates 5-Methylenetetrahydrofolate; 5,10-MeTHF, 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate;
  MT, Methyltransferase.
