caption: 'Working model of altered proteins and lipids in smt1 (blue) and ugt80A2;B1
  (red) based on the set of identified core proteins from network analysis. (A) Fatty
  acid and glycerolipid synthesis is decreased in smt1 and increased in ugt80A2;B1,
  with significant alterations in abundances of distinct glycerolipids. (B) Alteration
  in ceramide (Cer) de novo synthesis was not observable. Additionally, alterations
  in activity of salvage synthesis pathways (Van Brocklyn and Williams, ) could explain
  changes in abundances of ceramides in the mutants. (C) Glycosylation of sterols
  (SGlc/ASGlc) might additionally happen in plasma membrane catalyzed by UGT80A2,
  which was depleted from DRM in both mutants. (D) GlcCer levels are inversely altered
  in both mutants implying an additional sterol-dependent pathway for ceramide glycosylation
  in the plasma membrane. (E) Alterations in Cer activated phosphatase PP2 (Nickels
  and Broach, ) observed in a DRM-dependent response of PP2 subunit PP2AA3 indicate
  an unbalance in activation of apoptosis and cell proliferation in both mutants.
  (F) Phospholipase signaling was sterol-dependent in a discordant manner in both
  mutants. (G) Vesicle trafficking is likely affected in both mutants. (H) RbohD shows
  discordant sterol affinity, but lead to increased ROS production in both mutants.
