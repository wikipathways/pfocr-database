caption: A schematic representation of TAG production. (a) acyl-CoA independent acylation.
  (b) acyl-CoA dependent acylation (Kennedy Pathway). The acyl-CoA dependent acylation
  is shown as the central route for TAG synthesis (Thicker line); however, Acyl CoA
  independent acylation has also significant role in TAG production. (c) Triacylglycerol
  structure composed of Glycerol and three fatty acids, which are attached by an ester
  bond (red color).
