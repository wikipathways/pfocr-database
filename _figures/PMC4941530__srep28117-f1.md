caption: The five fra genes are unique to Salmonella while the surrounding treF and
  gor genes are conserved between E. coli and Salmonella. A proteomic survey of subcellular
  fractions determined that FraE is periplasmic while FraB is cytoplasmic. The functions
  of FraD and FraB were proposed based on homology to the E. coli FrlD and FrlB proteins
  involved in fructose-lysine metabolism, and the inability of a fraB mutant to grow
  on F-Asn. In this report, we confirm that 6-phosphofructose-aspartate (6-P-F-Asp)
  is the product of FraD and the substrate of FraB.
