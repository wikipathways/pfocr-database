caption: 'Arketamine induces the expression of TGF-β1 in the microglia through unidentified
  mechanisms. Arketamine-induced TGF-β1 or TGF-β1 bind to its receptor TGF-β receptor
  1/2 in　the microglia. Subsequently, released BDNF binds to its receptor TrkB, resulting
  in MEK–ERK–CREB signaling pathway, leading to synaptogenesis and antidepressant
  actions. MEK: mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase, CREB: cAMP response element binding protein.'
