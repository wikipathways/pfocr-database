caption: The mechanisms by which S. miltiorrhiza bioactive constituents modulate breast
  cancer immunity and CSC manifestation. (A) CPT enhances perforin production in CD4+
  T cells by up-regulating phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT4, promoting immune response
  differentiates to Th1 type. (B) DHT-activated NOX5 expression promotes ROS generation
  which inhibits IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. Tan IIA inhibits the expression levels
  of IL-6 expression, STAT3 phosphorylation, and NF-κB p65 nucleus translation, leading
  to breast CSCs death.
