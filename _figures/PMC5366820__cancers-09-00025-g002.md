caption: PDK1 contributes to polarization of signaling downstream to PI3K during cell
  migration. In the presence of a gradient of chemoattractant, a migrating cell is
  able to polarize following the direction of the gradient. This polarization is achieved
  by the localized activation of signaling proteins either at the front or at the
  rear of the cell. The PI3K pathway is activated at the leading edge of migrating
  cells, with the consequent accumulation of PIP3 (dark grey line). Conversely, while
  PI3K is excluded from the sides and the back of moving cells, the phosphatase PTEN
  specifically localizes to such portions of the cell, causing the accumulation of
  PIP2 (light grey line). The green box shows a detail of signaling activated by PDK1
  at the leading edge, downstream to PI3K. First, PDK1 phosphorylates and activates
  Akt at front of migrating cells. Moreover, through a kinase-independent mechanism,
  PDK1 is able to stimulate function of phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCγ1) and ROCK1.
