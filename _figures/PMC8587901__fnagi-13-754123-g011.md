caption: Gliquidone affects LPS-stimulated neuroinflammatory responses in vitro and
  in vivo. In BV2 microglial cells and wild-type mice, gliquidone reduces LPS-stimulated
  microglial proinflammatory cytokine expression by modulating ERK-associated STAT3/NF-κB
  signaling in an NLRP3-dependent manner. In primary astrocytes, gliquidone selectively
  downregulates LPS-induced astrocytic proinflammatory cytokine expression by decreasing
  STAT3/NF-κB phosphorylation via an NLRP3-independent pathway. Accordingly, gliquidone
  may have therapeutic potential for neuroinflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases.
