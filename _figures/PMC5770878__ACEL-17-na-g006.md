caption: 'The hypothesized protective effect of CR on retinal degeneration by ONVT:
  the pivotal role of elevated endogenous 3HB via ketolysis. CR protects the retina
  from degeneration as follows: (1) CR upregulates ketogenesis in the liver, (2) a
  prominent increase is observed in the blood and retinal 3HB concentration during
  CR, (3) adaptive upregulation of the ketolytic pathway through its rate‐limiting
  enzyme, SCOT, in the retina, (4) acceleration of the TCA cycle flux with an increase
  in fumarate, an Nrf2 activator and TCA cycle intermediate, (5) translocation of
  Nrf2 upregulates its downstream antioxidative factors; G6PD, a rate‐limiting enzyme
  of antioxidative PPP, MnSOD, NQO‐1, and ɤ‐GCLM, and (6) CR suppresses retinal degeneration
  through preservation of PPP and antioxidative enzymes during ischemic conditions
  after ONVT. 3HB: 3‐hydroxybutyrate. AcAc: acetoacetate. AcAc‐CoA: acetoacetyl‐CoA.
  Ac‐CoA: acetyl‐CoA. SCOT: succinyl‐CoA‐3‐oxaloacid CoA transferase. SDH: succinate
  dehydrogenase. BDH1: D‐3‐hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. ACAT1: acetyl‐CoA acetyltransferase
  1. CS: citrate synthase. PPP: pentose phosphate pathway'
