caption: The influx of glucose and its effects on synthesis and secretion of insulin
  in pancreatic β-cells. Numbers 1–9 refer to the different steps of insulin release.
  Glucose enters the cell via the transporter GLUT2 (1). It is then metabolized via
  glycolysis in the cytosol and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in mitochondria
  to generate ATP (2). This increases the ratio of ATP to ADP in the cell (3). A K+
  ion channel senses the elevated ATP/ADP ratio and closes (4), resulting in plasma
  membrane depolarization (5). This is sensed by a voltage-gated calcium channel,
  which opens, leading to Ca2+ influx (6). Elevation of calcium level triggers rearrangement
  of the actin cytoskeleton and docking of insulin secretory granules to the plasma
  membrane, leading to their fusion and release. In parallel, ERK senses the high
  ATP/ADP ratio and activates the transcription factor NEUROD1 to potentiate insulin
  gene transcription (8). Following the first phase of insulin release is a second,
  more sustained phase, which involves substantial cytoskeletal rearrangements and
  long-range transport of insulin vesicles from intracellular stores to the plasma
  membrane. Binding of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) to GLP1R augments these processes
  via the cAMP–protein kinase A signal transduction pathway (9). MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
  expressed in β-cells that are implicated in regulating insulin are mostly involved
  in antagonizing the various steps in the synthesis and release of insulin. They
  attenuate GLP1 signal transduction, inhibit insulin gene transcription, reduce calcium
  influx to the cytosol and lower secretory granule docking and release. However,
  a small subset of miRNAs have also been shown to promote insulin synthesis. AC,
  adenylyl cyclase.
