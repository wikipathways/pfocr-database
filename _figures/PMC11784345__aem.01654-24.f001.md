caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of mildiomycin. CMP, cytidine 5′-monophosphate.
  HM-CMP, 5-hydroxymethyl CMP. HMC, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. HM-CGA, 5-hydroxymethyl
  cytosylglucuronic acid. MilA, CMP 5-hydroxymethylase. MilB, nucleotide hydrolase.
  MilC, cytosylglucuronic acid/hydroxymethyl cytosylglucuronic acid synthase. MilD,
  putative degT/dnrJ/eryC1/strS aminotransferase. MilG, putative cytosylglucuronate
  decarboxylase. MilM, putative pyridoxal phosphate–dependent arginine oxidases. MilN,
  putative dihydrodipicolinate synthetase. MilI, putative acyl carrier protein. MilH,
  putative tRNA-dependent aminoacyltransferase. The solid arrows represent reactions
  that have been elucidated, and the dashed arrows indicate proposed reactions. The
  changing groups are indicated in different colors. The shunt product compound 1
  is highlighted in a yellow rectangle
