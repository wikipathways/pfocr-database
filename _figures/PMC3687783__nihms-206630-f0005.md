caption: 'Predicted gene presence calls for the Western diet microbiome and/or the
  E.dolichum genome are displayed in the upper right. Fermentation end-products and
  cellular biomass are highlighted in white ellipses. Note that culture-based studies
  of E.dolichum have demonstrated its ability to produce lactate, acetate, and butyrate
  (), suggesting that the apparent gap in the pathway for generating butyrate reflects
  the draft nature of the genome assembly or the possibility that this organism uses
  novel enzymes to generate this end-product of anaerobic fermentation. Abbreviations
