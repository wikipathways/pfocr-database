caption: The flhDC operon, or flagellar master operon, is under the control of numerous
  global regulatory signals that lead to the expression or inhibition of flagellar
  gene expression. Induction of the class I flhDC operon (class I on) produces FlhD
  and FlhC, which form a heteromultimeric complex, FlhD4C2, that acts to direct σ-dependent
  transcription from class II flagellar promoters and auto-repress flhDC transcription
  (class I off; class II on). Class II promoters direct the transcription of genes
  that are necessary for the structure and assembly of the hook–basal body (HBB) substructure.
  Upon HBB completion, late secretion substrates are exported from the cell and their
  cognate chaperones are released to regulate gene expression. FliT is an FlhD4C2
  factor and prevents both FlhD4C2 auto-repression and the activation of class II
  promoters. The σ transcription factor directs the transcription of class III promoters,
  which include the filament structural genes and the genes of the chemosensory pathway
  (class I on; class II off; and class III on). Activation of class I transcription
  would re-initiate the flagellar regulon for a new round of flagellar gene expression.
  As drawn, the FliK and FlhA proteins are meant to reside within the C ring. The
  stoichiometries of Fluke, FlhA, FlhB, FliO, FliP, FliQ and FliR within the C ring
  are not known.
