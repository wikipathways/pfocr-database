caption: Role of mitochondria derived peptides in cells and their regulation of related
  diseases. HN acts by activating formylpeptide-like receptors (FPRL) and heterotrimeranthroinin
  receptors composed of GP130 ciliated neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) and WSX-1.
  In addition, HN promotes phosphorylated STAT3 dimer entry into the nucleus to regulate
  gene transcription and activates the FPRL1/2-ERK1/2 pathway to play a protective
  role in cell. MOTS-c translocates to the nucleus in a 5’ -adenosine monophosphat-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) -dependent manner after metabolic stress. MOTS-c regulates
  a wide range of genes in response to glucose restriction, including genes with antioxidant
  response elements (ARE), and interacts with stress response transcription factors
  that regulate ARE, such as the nuclear factor erythrocyte 2-associated factor 2
  (NFE2L2/NRF2), to enhance mitochondrial function and thus maintain cellular homeostasis.
  SHLPs can enhance insulin sensitivity, promote adipocyte 3T3-L1 differentiation,
  inhibit the expression of caspase and ROS, and play a cellular protective role.
