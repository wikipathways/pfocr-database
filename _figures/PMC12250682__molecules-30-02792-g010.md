caption: Synergistic effects of Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) with chemotherapeutic
  agents in liver cancer. This figure illustrates the synergistic actions of APS when
  used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents or interventional therapies in
  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the top left panel, APS enhance doxorubicin (Dox)-induced
  apoptosis through activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways, including
  PERK, eIF2α, and CHOP, and increase expression of proapoptotic proteins Bax and
  Bim. The top right panel shows that APS combined with apatinib promote apoptosis
  and inhibit tumour migration and invasion, alongside reduced levels of tumour markers
  CA189 and CA724. In the bottom left panel, APS co-administered with cisplatin result
  in G1 cell cycle arrest, increased Sub-G1 cell population, and augmented apoptotic
  activity. The bottom right panel demonstrates that APS improve the therapeutic efficacy
  of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) by lowering serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
  and total bilirubin levels, while also offering hepatic protection. Collectively,
  these data indicate that APS act as a multifunctional adjuvant capable of enhancing
  chemotherapeutic efficacy, reducing adverse effects, and modulating tumour-associated
  pathways in liver cancer treatment
