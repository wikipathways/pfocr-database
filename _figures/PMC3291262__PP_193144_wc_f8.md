caption: 'A model for PG function in plastid metabolism and short- and long-term photo
  response and adaptation. The physical connectivity of the PG and thylakoid permit
  extensive exchange of metabolites between the two subcompartments and possibly also
  facilitate the recruitment of proteins from the thylakoid-stroma-exposed surface
  to the PG. During times of high lipid or protein turnover (such as senescence, stress,
  or plastid biogenesis), the role of the PG becomes especially pertinent. We illustrate
  here some of the proposed functions of the PG in these processes. Turnover of galactolipids
  by DAD1-like acylhydrolases will release free fatty acids transported to the PG,
  where they can (1) be incorporated into triacylglycerol (TAG) by diacyl glycerol
  acyl transferase 3 and 4 (DGAT3/4), (2) enter the jasmonic acid synthesis pathway,
  in the case of linolenic acid (18:3), or (3) be esterified to free phytol into fatty
  acid phytyl esters (FAPEs) during concurrent chlorophyll degradation. Alternatively,
  the free phytol can be recycled for incorporation into tocopherols by two subsequent
  phytol kinases, the first of which has been identified (VTE5; ). During chlorophyll
  degradation, the tetrapyrrole head group is captured by the PG-localized SOUL/heme-binding
  protein (SOUL/HBP) and delivered for further degradation to the stroma. We predict
  that the four PG oxidoreductases (NDC1, AKRed, and FRed1 and -2) are active in rereducing
  oxidized lipophilic compounds sequestered in the PG. Supporting this, NDC1 has recently
  been demonstrated to display NAD(P)H reductase activity toward a PQ-9 analog (decyl-PQ;
  ). We expect that NDC1 and the other PG oxidoreductases are responsible for the
  regeneration of oxidized PG quinones following reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging.
  PQ-9 is expected to be exchanged between the PG and thylakoid. Selective uptake
  of reduced (or oxidized) PQ-9 would permit a powerful control over the redox state
  of PQ-9 in the thylakoid and thus over a number of processes regulated by the PQ-9
  redox state, including photosynthetic electron flow, retrograde signaling, carotenoid
  desaturation, and light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) state transition. The presence
  of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 4 (CCD4) suggests the presence of carotenoid
  catabolism at the PG. Carotenoids released from the photosynthetic apparatus (photosystems
  and light-harvesting complexes) can be directed to the PG by FBN4 (or other FBNs)
  for degradation by CCD4. ABC1K9, positioned as a hub in module 4 (), is regulating
  the localization or function of FBNs and Trxs as well as components of the cyclic
  electron flow apparatus (NDH and/or PGR5 dependent). FBNs will be controlling the
  size of PGs (dashed arrow), while Trxs will control Calvin cycle activity to match
  the supply of reducing power produced from photosynthesis. Increased Calvin cycle
  activity will create additional demand for ATP that can be met by up-regulated cyclic
  electron flow (CEF), either NDH or PGR5 dependent (, ). Metabolites are enclosed
  in gray boxes, PG-localized proteins are marked in red, and coexpressers are marked
  in blue. Abbreviations used and not already defined are as follows: zeaxanthin epoxidase
  (ZEP), state transition kinase (STN7), phytoene desaturase (PDS), ζ-carotene desaturase
  (ZDS), 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), plastochromanol-8 (PC-8), lipoxygenase
  (LOX), 9,13-hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic acid (9-,13-HPOT), allene oxide synthase
