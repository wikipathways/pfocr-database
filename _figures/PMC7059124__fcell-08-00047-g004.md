caption: Hepatotropic oncogenic viruses and their impact on autophagy regulation.
  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) interfere with the autophagy
  pathway at different steps and depending on the stage of their disease. During infection,
  both viruses induce autophagosome formation and, at the same time, impair the maturation
  of the autophagic vesicles to favor viral replication. In particular, at the early
  stage of infection, HCV is able to block autophagy through Rubicon upregulation
  (1), while later, the virus restored autophagy completion through UVRAG induction
  (2). HBV and HCV induce mitophagy. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development
  and progression, autophagy is mostly inhibited by both viruses, but HCV mediates
  the activation of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA).
