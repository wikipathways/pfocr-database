caption: Spry2 and Spry2Y55F function in the context of EC MAPK signaling. Upon growth
  factor (GF) binding to its respective receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and activation
  of the respective signaling pathway, Spry2 is induced to translocate to the inner
  plasma membrane where it gets activated (in many cases via phosphorylation on the
  Y55 by a Src-like kinase) and functions by interacting with various MAPK signaling
  pathway-associated proteins in a GF-specific manner. When RTK signaling is Ras dependent
  (left), Spry2 inhibition of this pathway is thought to occur at the level of GF
  receptor-bound protein-2 (Grb2) or Raf1. When RTK signaling is Ras independent (right),
  Spry2 inhibition of this pathway is thought to occur at the level of Raf1. In many
  cases, pY55 is required for Spry2 inhibition of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway. The dominant-negative
  Y55F mutant of Spry2 inhibits endogenous Spry2 action, thereby promoting the Raf/Mek/Erk
  pathway. FGF-2, fibroblast GF-2; PDGF, platelet-derived GF; pY, phosphorylated tyrosine;
  Sos1, son of sevenless-1; PLC-γ, phospholipase C-γ; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C. Information
  in this figure was compiled from Refs. , , , , , , , , .
