caption: Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway.
  Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPs) activate NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) consisting of a central
  nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT) domain and leucine-rich repeat (LRR).
  NLRP3 forms an inflammasome complex with adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like
  protein (ASC) consisting of a protein pyrin domain (PYD) caspase-recruitment domain
  (CARD) and cysteine protease caspase 1. Activated NLRP3 inflammasome complex activates
  caspase 1, leading to regulation of pro-inflammatory interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and
  interleukin-18 (IL-18) cytokine production.
