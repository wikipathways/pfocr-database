caption: Classical and non-classical AR signaling pathways in SCs. The SC shown on
  the left illustrates the classical signaling pathway, while the SC shown on the
  right illustrates the non-classical signaling pathway (both classical and non-classical
  signaling pathways can exist in a single SC; the two pathways are presented in separate
  cells for simplicity). Between the two neighboring SCs are germ cells (spermatogonia
  stem cells, spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, spermatids
  and spermatozoa). SCs function as a nurse to take good care of normal spermatogenesis
  as spermatogonia stem cells develop into spermatozoa in the lumen. Androgen secreted
  by Leydig cells diffuses through the plasma membrane and binds to the AR complex
  in the cytoplasm to activate the classical signaling pathway. The AR then detaches
  from the HSP complex and enters the nucleus to form AR dimers. Dimerized ARs bind
  to the AREs of their target genes and thereby regulate their transcription. The
  classical signaling pathway can promote SC maturation, induce SSC differentiation,
  guarantee spermatocyte meiosis, and ensure BTB integrity. The non-classical signaling
  pathway begins with translocation of the AR from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane.
  There, the AR interacts with Src and causes it to phosphorylate EGFR, and this in
  turn activates MAPK kinases to regulate targeted gene transcription. The non-classical
  signaling pathway can regulate processes including BTB integrity, spermatocyte meiosis,
  Sertoli cell-Spermatid adhesion, spermatid development and sperm release. The three
  orange ovals in the figure represent the BTB, and the two black lines represent
  cell–cell adhesion. TF is short for transcription factor. Areas for which controversy
  exists are not included in the figure but are discussed in the article.
