caption: (a) In Parkin-dependent mitophagy, parkin translocates to damaged mitochondria
  with decreased membrane potential and ubiquitinates Mfn2 (diamond) in the mitochondrial
  membrane, prevents fusion with healthy mitochondria and facilitates binding with
  LC3 via P62, thereby inducing mitophagy of the damaged organelle. (b) In the BNIP/NIX-mediated
  parkin-independent pathway, the cytosolic protein NIX (rectangle) translocates to
  the mitochondria and binds with BNIP inducing mitophagy. (c) In the cardiolipin
  (CL)-dependent parkin-independent pathway, the phospholipid CL (star-shape) "flips"
  to the exterior surface of outer membrane of stressed mitochondria with the help
  of flippase/scramblase 3 and binds with LC3 (circle) after recruiting the latter
  and induces mitophagy.
