caption: Mechanistic diagram of lncRNA NEAT1 in blood exosomes of RA patients promoting
  the occurrence of RA by mediating the miR-144-3p/ROCK2 axis to regulate the WNT
  signaling pathway. lncRNA NEAT1 acts as a ceRNA to mediate miR-144-3p expression
  in CD4+T cells; thereby, NEAT1 promotes expression of ROCK2. Expression of c-myc
  and cyclin D1 is then increased significantly, while expression of E-cadherin is
  increased significantly. NEAT1, miR-144-3p inhibitor, and ROCK2 support CD4+T cell
  proliferation and Th17 differentiation, but limit CD4+T cell apoptosis.ceRNA competing
  endogenous RNA, lncRNA, long noncoding RNA; NEAT1, nuclear enriched abundant transcript
  1; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; ROCK2, Rho-associated protein kinase 2.
