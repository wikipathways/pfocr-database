caption: An integrated gene interaction network built for genes related to wing dimorphism.
  a The modular view of the integrated gene interaction network constructed by integrating
  heterogeneous data together, including protein-protein interactions, co-expression
  gene pairs, gene pairs with GO semantic similarity and FOXO-target gene pairs. The
  enrichment analysis of genes in each module were conducted based on GO terms in
  the biological process category and KEGG pathways. The representatively enriched
  GO/KEGG terms of each module were shown on the right (P-value < 0.0001 by hypergeometric
  test). b The interaction network consisting of the key components of the IIS-PI3K-Akt-FOXO
  signaling pathway and the 45 IWDRGs. The node colors denote the functional categories
  of the genes. The bigger nodes in blue represent the components of the IIS-PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway, the bigger nodes in other colors denote the IWDRGs for experimental
  verification. The black solid lines represent gene pairs of protein-protein interaction,
  co-expression or GO semantic similarity, and the blue dash lines indicate FOXO-target
  gene pairs
