caption: Representation of NAD+biosynthesis pathways. Biosynthesis pathways and cellular
  metabolism of NAD+. NAD precursors such as NR, NA, NAM, and Trp provided by diet
  can be converted into NAD via three pathways. In the Preiss-Handler pathway, NA
  is converted into NAMN by NAPRT, NAMN is converted into NAAD by NAD by NMNATs, and
  NAAD is converted into NAD by NADSYN. In the de novo synthesis pathway, Trp is converted
  into QA in a series of steps, which is then converted into NAD by forming NAMN and
  NAAD. In contrast, in the salvage pathway, NR and NAM provided by diet are converted
  into NAD by forming NMN by enzymes NAMPT and NRK []. The equilibrium in each subcellular
  compartment such as the nucleus and mitochondria is determined by NAD/NADH redox
  ratios. ETC is a significant contributor to the conversion of NADH into NAD. Additionally,
  NAD-consuming enzymes such as PARPs and sirtuins catalyze NAM production in subcellular
  compartments, which can be used for NAD synthesis via the salvage pathway.
