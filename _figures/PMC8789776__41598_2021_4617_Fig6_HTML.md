caption: Expression levels of genes in ABA biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, IAA
  biosynthetic pathway and SA biosynthetic pathway. In both treatment groups, the
  relative expression changes of all organs in all sampling stages were log2 times
  of that in flower at veraison stage. Key genes (ertZ, ZEP, NCED1, ABA3, AAO3, CYP707A,
  BG1, UGTs, TAR1, TAA1, CYP79B, AMI, YUC1, AAO, NIT, PAL, ICS, BA2H and IPL) expression
  levels were reflected as heat map. * Indicates a significant difference between
  the two treatments, while ** indicates an extremely significant difference between
  the two treatments. (A) ABA biosynthesis and metabolic pathway. (B) IAA biosynthesis
  pathway. (C) SA biosynthesis pathway.
