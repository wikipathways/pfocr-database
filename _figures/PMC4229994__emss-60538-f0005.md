caption: Nitrate (NO3−) is taken up by nitrate transporters (NRT) in roots and reduced
  in leaves to nitrite (NO2−) by nitrate reductase (NR). Besides the transport to
  chloroplasts where it is reduced to ammonium (NH4+) and incorporated into amino
  acids (AA), nitrite can be reduced to nitric oxide (NO) by any favourable reducing
  power. NO is also thought to be generated from other sources, such as L-arginine.
  NO reacts with reduced glutathione (GSH) producing S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO),
  the major cellular reservoir of NO. The levels of GSNO are controlled by the enzyme
  GSNO reductase (GSNOR), which catalyses the reduction of GSNO to oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG) and ammonium (NH3). GSNO inhibits nitrate uptake and reduction and NO S-nitrosylates
  and inhibits GSNOR preventing GSNO degradation. In this way NO, one of the end products
  of nitrogen metabolism, feedback regulates flux through nitrate assimilation pathways
  and controls its bioavailability by modulating its own consumption.
