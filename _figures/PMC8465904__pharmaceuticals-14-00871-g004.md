caption: Suggested pathway initiated by β-catenin to promote the induction of apoptotic
  cell death on cancer cells. β-catenin can be stabilized by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  and/or the EGF and TGF-β signaling pathways. β-catenin can bind and activate TCF4/LEF,
  which may activate the transcription of p53 and c-myc. C-myc can increase the genic
  expression of p14ARF, fas, Trail, fasR, and DR4/5. FasR and DR4/5 activate the apoptotic
  extrinsic pathway, which is initiated by the binding of their respective ligands.
  This leads to the autoactivation of caspases-8 and -10, which in turn promote the
  catalytic activation of the effector caspase-3. Another target of caspase-8 is the
  pro-apoptotic protein Bid, which is hydrolyzed to tBid, inducing Bax oligomerization
  and mitochondrial depolarization with release of cyt c. Along with the activation
  of caspase-9, these events amplify the apoptotic pathway. On the other hand, p14ARF
  inhibits mdm2, which induces the ubiquitination and ensuing degradation of p53.
  p53 can induce apoptosis via transactivation of pro-apoptotic genes such as Noxa,
  Puma, Bax, and Bid, which inhibit the Bcl-2 and BclXL anti-apoptotic proteins. p53
  also acts by directly inhibiting BclXL and Bcl-2 in the mitochondria, inducing the
  permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, with the ensuing release of
  cyt c y the activation of apoptosis intrinsic pathway. Furthermore, p53 induces
  c-myc genic expression. Continue arrows (↓) indicate activation, arrows with (⊥)
  indicate inhibition.
