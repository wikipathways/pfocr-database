caption: 'The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. This transcription factor usually
  resides in the cytoplasm, where it associates with some inactivating molecules:
  two HSPs90s, one XAP2 or AIP, one HSP90 co-chaperone protein named p23, one pp60(c-src).
  Once it binds a ligand, XAP2 leaves the complex that moves to the nucleus. Here,
  the two HSP-90s, p23 and pp60-src drop AhR that binds to ARNT. This new complex
  is now ready to interact with XRE of genes like CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1 and AHRR,
  usually containing the sequences 5’-GCGTG-3′ or 5′-ACGTG-3′. AhR also targets NC-XREs,
  which bind AhR, while not containing the canonical consensus sequence. Just before
  the transcription starts, AhR moves from XREs, is translated out of the nucleus
  by XPO1 (not shown) and is degraded in the cytoplasm by 26S ubiquitin–proteasome.
