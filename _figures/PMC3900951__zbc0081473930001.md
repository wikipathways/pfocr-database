caption: Proposed noscapine biosynthetic pathway. Enzymes shown in blue have been
  functionally characterized. Dashed arrows represent several uncharacterized reactions.
  R1 and R2 = H or OH. Partial carbon numbering is shown for N-methylcanadine and
  the putative secoberbine intermediate. [O], uncharacterized oxidative conversions.
