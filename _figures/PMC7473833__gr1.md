caption: 'Schematic representation of MHC antigen processing and presentation adapted
  from cellular and immunobiological textbooks by Janeway  and Abbas et al. . The
  MHC class I or II antigen presenting molecule comes into contact with CD8+ or CD4+
  T cells, respectively. The binding to the T cell receptor (TCR), which induces T
  cell activation, is aided by the CD8 or CD4 protein, for MHC class I or II binding
  mechanisms, respectively. In both figures black arrows follow MHC synthesis and
  antigen presentation pathways. Red arrows follow antigen processing: solid - foreign-antigen
  direct presentation pathway; dashed - self-antigen direct presentation pathway;
  dotted - foreign antigen cross-presentation. A. MHC class I antigen processing and
  presentation. MHCI synthesis is started off by the ribosomes in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). Additional incorporation of β2-microglobulin into the MHCI structure
  is aided by a transitional complex with the auxiliary protein calnexin. To protect
  from unsolicited interactions, the newly synthesised MHCI is complexed with calreticulin
  and ERp57, and subsequently to tapasin which will assist in epitope binding. Upon
  transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) protein activation antigens
  come through into the ER and simultaneously the MHCI-tapasin-calreticulin complex
  releases ERp57 and widens the peptide binding cleft which allows for binding of
  compatible epitopes. The loaded complex is released from ER by endosome encapsulation
  and transported to the cell membrane to be expressed on cell surface. Foreign and
  self antigen processing. Some pathogens survive internalisation and continue to
  produce proteins in the cytosol. Alternatively, pathogens may be internalised along
  with their protein product. These proteins are degraded by the proteosome into peptide
  fragments, epitopes, and sent to the ER for peptide-MHCI assembly and presentation.
  Foreign epitopes are shown in orange. Self proteins follow a similar pathway of
  proteosomal degradation and are sent to the ER for peptide-MHC assembly and self
  presentation. Self epitopes are shown in blue. All nucleated cells express MHCI
  and follow these pathways for endogenous antigen presentation. Cross-presentation.
  Exogenous antigens are usually presented on MHCII expressing cells. In order to
  allow for MHCI presentation of exogenous antigens specialised cells process pathogens
  as in the MHCII pathway, but present on MHCI complexes. Several pathways might be
  involved in this process. The pathogen is first internalised and enzymatically degraded
  in the phagolysosome. The lysosome containing peptide antigens then comes into contact
  with synthesised MHCI molecule and form the peptide-MHCI complex. One possible pathway
  is that the generated antigens are transported from the lysosome, through TAP and
  are loaded onto the MHCI in the ER, following which they are expressed on the cell
  surface. Another pathway might include a vesicular loading compartment detaching
  from the ER, carrying the synthesised MHCI molecule, and merging with the epitope
  carrying lysososme. Upon merging the epitopes could load onto the MHCI and express
  onto the cell surface. B. MHC class II antigen processing and presentation. Pathogens
  are phagocytosed into the cell interior. Upon merging with a lysosome, proteases
  cleave the pathogen into short peptide fragments - foreign epitopes, here shown
  in red. The same fate befalls the cells own proteins as they undergo degradation
  by the autophagosome, leaving a phagosome containing short peptides - self epitopes,
  here shown in blue. Meanwhile, the MHCII protein is synthesised by ribosomes in
  the ER. Upon assembly, MHCII binds invariant chain, Ii protein. It prevents any
  unwanted protein binding to the MHCII complex in the ER. The Ii chaperones MHCII
  out of ER in an endosome. In the endosome, due to slightly acidic conditions the
  Ii protein degrades leaving class II associated invariant chain peptide, CLIP fragment
  bound in the MHCII cleft. Upon merging with a epitope containing phagosome, the
  MHCII comes into contact with foreign and self antigen fragments. Upon binding the
  peptide-MHCII complex is expressed on the cell surface where it is able to bind
  CD4+ T cells. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
