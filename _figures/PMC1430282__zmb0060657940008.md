caption: Model of posttranscriptional regulation by the p38/MK2/TTP pathway in response
  to LPS in the different genetic situations. TTP is expressed in small amounts in
  nonstimulated cells (no stress), is not phosphorylated, and is able to bind and
  destabilize rare TNF mRNA occasionally transcribed and, hence, elevates the threshold
  of inflammation. In the case of stimulation by LPS, the rate of TNF and TTP transcription
  increases, and MK2 gets activated, phosphorylates TTP, and reduces its binding to
  ARE, making ARE-containing mRNA stable. Phosphorylated TTP protein is stable, and
  its accumulation can be important in the recovery step, when MK2 is no longer active
  and TTP is rapidly dephosphorylated. Dephosphorylated TTP binds to and destabilizes
  TNF mRNA, resulting in decreasing expression of TNF. Apparently, in MK2-deficient
  cells, codegradation of nonphosphorylated TTP bound to TNF mRNA becomes the default
  pathway, resulting in low levels of both components, and causes alleviation of inflammatory
  response. In contrast, TTP-deficient mice which are compromised in degradation of
  ARE-containing mRNAs produce increased levels of TNF upon LPS stimulation and, even
  in the absence of stimulation, develop TNF excess syndrome. Since TTP is downstream
  of MK2, TNF excess syndrome is not modulated by MK2 deficiency in the absence of
  TTP.
