caption: Liver-specific gene-regulatory networks of top KDs in meta-analysis of CRP
  and IL6. (CRP, C-reactive protein; eQTL, expression quantitative trait loci; IL6,
  interleukin-6; KD, key drivers. The bigger nodes with red outlines are the top KDs
  in the enriched pathway obtained from weighted KD analysis. The subnetworks of the
  KDs are indicated by different colors according to differences in their canonical
  functions.).
