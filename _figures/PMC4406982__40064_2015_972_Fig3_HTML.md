caption: 'Hypotheses of NALP3 activation via inflammatory pathway. (A1): Alum activates
  XOR and induces the secretion of uric acid (UA). (A2): Alum-adsorbed antigen (Ag)
  is internalized by DC via actin-polymerization pathway. (A3): Alum interacts with
  lipid raft of DC membrane and activates ITAM-Syk pathway to internalize Ag. (A4):
  Alum-induced production of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals may be internalized by
  DC in CD16/32-dependent pathway. (B): Alum in phagosome enhances maturation into
  phagolysosome and release of Al3+ and OH−. (C): Al3+ inhibits the cathepsin L activity
  and consequently the generated stress induces the rupture of phagolysosomes. (C1):
  The leaked Ag may bind with MHCI molecule in cytoplasm. (C2): Nanometer-sized Al3+
  ion precipitates in the cytosol. (C3): The released K+ will be exported outside
  and extracellular adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) will enter inside via P2X7 molecule.
  (C4): Cathepsin molecule will be released in the cytosol. (C5): MSU is released
  in cytosol. (D): Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is generated. The ROS will activate
  various molecules such as (D1) unknown or (D2) Heat shock protein (HSP)70 that can
  trigger nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling
  and induces the secretion of IL-1β (D3). (E): Mitochondrion becomes activated and
  generates ROS (E1) and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (E2). (F): C3,
  C4, C5, D1, D2, E1, or E2 may activate nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
  family-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NALP3) and consequently AC-1 (G).
  (H): Necrosis-induced release of double stranded (ds)DNA enters cytoplasm and initiates
  toll-like receptor (TLR)9–interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 signaling (I). (J):
  MSU molecules directly activate myeloid differentiation (MYD)88 signaling. (K):
  Pro-IL-1β and IL-18 may be transcripted from nucleus. (L): Active caspase (AC)-1
  induces the secretion of their matured forms. (M): immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  activation motif (ITAM)-Syk-PI3Kδ pathway activates secretion of prostaglandin E2
  (PGE2). (N): Alum activates complement.'
