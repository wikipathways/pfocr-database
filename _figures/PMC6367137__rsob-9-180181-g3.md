caption: piRNA biogenesis mechanisms in flies, mice and worms. Simplified models for
  piRNA biogenesis are shown for D. melanogaster (flies), M. musculus (mice) and C.
  elegans (worms). (a) Transcription at piRNA clusters, (b) the piRNA biogenesis process
  and (c) transposon silencing by piRNAs. In the fly germline, piRNA clusters are
  marked by H3K9me3. The transcription by RNA Pol II is facilitated by RDC complex
  along with Moonshiner and TRF2. The transcripts are bound by TREX and UAP56. In
  the cytoplasm, these transcripts are processed into piRNAs by a ping-pong amplification
  cycle. The phased piRNAs are further bound by Piwi which can lead to transcriptional
  silencing by directing histone modification. In the soma, piRNA clusters are transcribed
  by canonical promoter by RNA Pol II. These transcripts are processed into piRNAs
  in the Yb bodies present in the cytoplasm and loaded into Piwi, which enters the
  nucleus to silence transposons. The Slicer cleavage by PIWI Argonautes is shown
  by vertical scissors and Zucchini mediated cleavage leading to phased piRNAs is
  shown by tilted scissors. In mice, A-MYB acts as a transcription factor for pachytene
  piRNA cluster transcription by RNA Pol II. No such transcription factor is known
  for pre-pachytene piRNA clusters. The ping-pong cycle in the pre-pachytene stage
  leads to an amplification of piRNAs. piRNA bound MIWI2 can silence transposons by
  directing DNA methylation. In the pachytene stage, MIWI Slicer cleavage leads to
  post-transcriptional silencing of transposons. In worms, each piRNA cluster encodes
  for one piRNA and has its own promoter identified by the Ruby motif. The RNA Pol
  II mediated transcription is directed by Forkhead and TOFU proteins. Recognition
  of target by piRNA bound PRG-1 leads to a generation of 22G-RNAs. These secondary
  22G-RNAs can mediate transcriptional silencing when in complex with worm specific
  Argonautes (WAGOs).
