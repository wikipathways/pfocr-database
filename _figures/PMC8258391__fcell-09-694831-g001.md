caption: Influence of P2X7R activity on tumor and immune system cells. (A) In tumor
  cells, P2X7R stimulation by eATP results in Ca2+ influx, activation of MyD88/NF-κB,
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways leading to nuclear translocation of Hif1α and Nf-κB,
  enhancement of cell proliferation, cell migration, and VEGF secretion. Moreover,
  stimulation of P2X7R upregulates the glucose transporter GLUT-1, fostering the glycolytic
  pathway and oxidative phosphorylation that allow tumor cells to proliferate in vitro
  in the absence of serum. (B) (Left) In the TME, extracellular ATP is released by
  tumor-dying cells and may function as a DAMP (danger-associated molecular pattern),
  inducing the recruitment and activation of macrophages and DCs. Activation of P2X7R
  by eATP triggers several responses in DCs, such as maturation, migration, and antigen
  presentation. Moreover, K+ release leads to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and secretion
  of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-18, and type I IFN.
  (Right) P2X7R activation promotes immunosuppression by MDSCs by stimulating the
  release of ROS, arginase 1 (ARG1), and TGF-β1, which, in turn, leads to Tregs expansion.
  Moreover, P2X7R promotes the conversion of M1 macrophages to M2. P2X7R activity
  in TILs fosters stress-induced cellular senescence, thus limiting their expansion
  and cytotoxic activity.
