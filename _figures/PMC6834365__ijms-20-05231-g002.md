caption: Schematic representation of the main mechanisms of action of H2S in mesenchymal
  stromal cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. H2S modulates osteogenic differentiation
  in osteoprogenitor cells by inducing S-sulfhydration in TRP channels leading to
  increased Ca2+ influx in MSC []; at the transcriptional level, H2S donors induce
  the expression of osteogenic signaling through stimulation of multiple signaling
  pathway [,,]. In the context of inflammation, H2S triggers an antioxidant signaling
  in OC which involves the increased nuclear translocations of NRF-2 and results in
  the inhibition of OC differentiation [,].
