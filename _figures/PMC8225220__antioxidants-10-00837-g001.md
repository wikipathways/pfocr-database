caption: 'Endocrine regulation of testosterone metabolism and spermatogenesis, and
  the possible attack points of ROS-induced pathologies. Normal physiology of testosterone
  metabolism and spermatogenesis is regulated by the hormones secreted by the hypothalamus,
  pituitary gland and Leydig cells. The pituitary gland produces LH and FSH in response
  to GnRH secreted by the hypothalamus. LH stimulates the Leydig cells to produce
  testosterone, and FSH upregulates the production of ABP in the Sertoli cells. Testosterone
  binds to ABP and brings about the functional response required for spermatogenesis.
  ROS stimulates the HPA axis, thereby mediating the adrenal cortex to synthesize
  cortisol, which inhibits the action of LH. ROS also upregulate the production of
  inhibin and estradiol and downregulates the concentration of testicular sialic acid—all
  these negatively affect the action of testosterone. Increased production of LTH
  resulting from excessive ROS generation may also create hindrance in the HPG axis.
  ROS may directly affect the HPG axis by inhibiting the production of FSH or stimulate
  the generation of cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, which in turn block
  the HPG axis. Red arrows represent the increase and decrease of respective substances,
  which negatively affects the HPG axis. (GnRH: gonadotropin-releasing hormone; LH:
  luteinizing hormone; FSH: follicle-stimulating hormone; ABP: androgen-binding protein;
  CRH: corticotropin-releasing hormone; ACTH: adrenocorticotropic hormone; LTH: luteotropic
  hormone; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-alpha; IL-1β: interleukin- 1 beta; IL-6: interleukin
  6; HPG: hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal; HPA: hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal; ROS:
  reactive oxygen species).'
