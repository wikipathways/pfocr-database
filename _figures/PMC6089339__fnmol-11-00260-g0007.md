caption: Summary of the location pattern of CFP (blue), YFP (yellow), neuronal (PV)
  and activity markers (Arc) in the hippocampus. Depicted is the situation in response
  to enriching or mild traumatic events (80/100 dB SPL) (A–C) or to severe traumatic/stressful
  events (120 dB SPL) (D–F). (A,D) Schematic drawing of the auditory pathway including
  hippocampal connections (red open arrow). (B,E) Schematic drawing of hippocampus
  with perforant path (PP). (C,D) Schematic drawing of dendritic (BS) and somatic
  (BC) inhibitory inputs onto a pyramidal cell (PC). CFP, YFP, VGLUT1 (A, light green),
  GluA2 (A, light orange), Arc (B red dendrites), PV (B red filled circles), and the
  δ subunit containing GABAA receptors in PCs (green dots in C) were shown to be mobilized
  after exposure to 80 or 100 dB SPL (A–C) but not to 120 dB SPL (D–F). (C,F) The
  cooperative transcript-specific BDNF release may drive a long-lasting reduction
  of dendritic (C, α1 subunit containing GABAA receptors, white small dots) and increase
  of perisomatic inhibition (C, δ subunit containing GABAA receptors, green small
  dots) of CA1 PC by PV expressing inhibitory interneurons (BS, BC) and in parallel
  possibly improve the recruitment of vascularization (B,E, blood vessels). This central
  facilitating or adaptive responsiveness (A–C, solid red arrow indicating increased
  input activity) is severely hampered when a critical damage of peripheral auditory
  input occurs (D–F discontinuous red lined arrow). ⊕ symbol indicates increased output
  activity in 80 or 100 dB SPL exposed animals (C). Green dots in (C) represent δ
  subunit containing GABAA receptors in SP, green dots in (F) represent α1 subunit
  containing GABAA receptors in SR. AC, auditory cortex; AN, Auditory nerve; BC, basket
  cell; BS, bistratified cell; CA3-SC, excitatory input from CA3 Schaffer collaterals;
  CN, cochlear nucleus; DG, dentate gyrus; EC, entorhinal cortex; FH, fissura hippocampalis;
  GC, granule cell; IC, inferior colliculus; MF, mossy fibers; SC, Schaffer collaterale;
  SG, stratum granulare; SL, stratum lucidum; SM, stratum moleculare; SO, stratum
  oriens; SOC, superior olivary complex; SP, stratum pyramidale; SR, stratum radiatum;
  SU, subiculum.
