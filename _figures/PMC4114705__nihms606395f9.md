caption: 'The dual functions of guggulsterone in the regulation of BSEP and possible
  mechanism for its cholesterol-lowering effect. A, guggulsterone regulates BSEP expression
  through its dual functions: suppressing BSEP expression through its function as
  an FXR antagonist and transactivating BSEP through the AP-1 site. However, the trans-activation
  through the AP-1 element is dominant over the FXR-mediated antagonism. B, possible
  mechanism for guggulsterone-mediated hypolipidemic effect. CYP7A1 is the rate-limiting
  enzyme catalyzing the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids in the liver, whereas
  BSEP is responsible for canalicular secretion of bile acids, a rate-limiting step
  in the bile acid enterohepatic circulation. Both BSEP and CYP7A1 are coordinately
  regulated by the bile acid/FXR activation pathway through the positive feed-forward
  and negative feedback mechanism, respectively. Such coordinated regulation represents
  a protective mechanism to prevent hepatic injury by excessive accumulation of bile
  acids. However, this regulatory mechanism is not effective in removing excessive
  cholesterol from the body by either FXR agonist or antagonist. FXR agonist up-regulates
  BSEP expression but suppresses CYP7A1 transcription, which decrease the conversion
  of cholesterol into bile acids. On the other hand, FXR antagonist enhances CYP7A1
  expression but suppresses BSEP expression, which results in accumulation of bile
  acids in hepatocytes and subsequently suppresses CYP7A1. The unique properties associated
  with guggulsterone as FXR antagonist as well as BSEP activator separated itself
  from the classes of sole FXR agonists or antagonists. Enhanced BSEP expression by
  guggulsterone without activating FXR pathway to suppress CYP7A1 is a possible mechanism
  by which guggulsterone exerts its hypolipidemic effect. As an activator by itself
  and synergistic inducer with bile acids, guggulsterone up-regulates BSEP expression
  and consequently increases secretion of bile acids, which in turn relieves the suppression
  of CYP7A1 expression by bile acids and favors cholesterol metabolism. On the other
  hand, as an FXR antagonist, guggulsterone presumably decreases SHP and consequently
  increases CYP7A1 expression, also favoring cholesterol metabolism. However, it should
  be emphasized that its FXR antagonistic effect is rather weak. Therefore, the enhanced
  expression of BSEP without activating FXR to suppress CYP7A1 by guggulsterone is
  the driving force to promote cholesterol metabolism by removing the trigger, bile
  acids, for the negative feedback suppression on CYP7A1. Solid arrows, activation
  or positive regulation; brakes, antagonism or negative regulation.'
