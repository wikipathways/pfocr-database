caption: Proposed mechanism of the anti-TGEV effect of Lp-1s. Lp-1s increases IFN-β
  expression, and the binding of IFN-β to its receptor IFNAR leads to activation of
  the Janus family kinase (JAK) and subsequent activation of signal transduction and
  transcriptional activator 1 (STAT1) signaling cascades. These signaling pathways
  upregulate downstream interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including MX1, MX2, PKR,
  OAS, ISG15, and ZAP), which produce the corresponding antiviral proteins, e.g.,
  ZAP and PKR, ultimately activating IFN-β to exert an antiviral effect.
