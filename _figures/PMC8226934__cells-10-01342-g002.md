caption: Endocytosis of FGFs/FGFRs. Once activated by ligand-binding, FGFRs can be
  internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and clathrin-independent endocytosis
  (CIE). While FGFR1, 2 and 4 are mainly internalized via CME, FGFR3 seems to be internalized
  partly by CME and partly by CIE mechanisms. Once internalized, the ligand-receptor
  complexes are localized to early/sorting endosomes from which they can be sorted
  to recycling either directly or via the endocytic recycling compartment or to degradation
  in lysosomes via multivesicular bodies (MVB) and late endosomes. FGFRs destined
  for degradation in lysosomes are tagged by the attachment of ubiquitin (Ub). Ubiquitination
  of FGFRs seems to be dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL. Ubiquitinated receptors
  are then recognized by the ESCRT complexes (ESCRT-0-III) and sorted into intraluminal
  vesicles originating at the endosomal membrane. Ub is removed before internalization.
  At least two components of the ESCRT machinery have proven important for FGFR sorting
  into the degradative pathway, namely HRS of ESCRT-0 and TSG101 of ESCRT-I. The decision
  to degrade or not, depends on the receptor type as well as the bound ligand. FGFR4
  seems to be mainly recycled while FGFR1, 2 and 3 are sorted more efficiently to
  lysosomal degradation. FGFR2b bound to FGF7 is sorted for degradation while FGFR2b
  bound to FGF10 is recycled. In both cases the decision to degrade or not, seems
  to depend on the levels of receptor ubiquitination. The recycling of FGFR4 might
  also occur via TGN (trans Golgi network). Moreover, both FGFs and FGFRs can translocate
  to the nucleus. Created with BioRender.com, accessed on 1 May 2021.
