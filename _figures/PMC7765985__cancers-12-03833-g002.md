caption: Networks generated from genes altered in intestinal- and diffuse-type gastric
  cancer (GC). A total of 2815 IDs, which had significant difference between intestinal-
  and diffuse-type GC, were analyzed in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA); and Network
  1 related to cancer, gastrointestinal disease, organismal injury and abnormalities
  is shown. (a) Network in intestinal-type GC; (b) Network in diffuse-type GC. A total
  of 463 direct relationships with three molecules (MYC, NTRK1, UBE2M) are shown in
  the network of biomarker-filtered genes in intestinal-type GC (c) and diffuse-type
  GC (d). From 613 genes biomarker-filtered (human, blood, cancer), 285 genes including
  MYC, NTRK1 and UBE2M are included in the network. All relationships were 609.
