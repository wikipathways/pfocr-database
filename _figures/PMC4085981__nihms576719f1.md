caption: mTOR exists in the mTORC1 or mTORC2 complex, distinguished by interacting
  proteins including Raptor and Rictor, with each complex regulating distinct aspects
  of cell growth (center, orange panel). In the heart, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has
  been previously studied in ischemic PC (as delineated in the top, purple panel).
  However, the role of mTORC2 remained equivocal. Yano et al. show that mTORC2 operates
  in a positive feedback loop necessary for ischemic PC signaling. Rps6 is phosphorylated
  in ischemic PC, activating a ribosome-bound mTORC2 fraction, which increases the
  activity of mTORC2 to phosphorylate and activate Akt (novel findings in blue). To
  promote translating signaling pathways into therapeutics, intermediate cellular
  phenotypes may be measured as functional outcomes in drug screens (green panel).
  These studies would be complementary to pathway dissection for developing novel
  drugs.
