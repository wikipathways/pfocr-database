caption: The hypothesized mechanism by which Ex-4 reduces tau hyperphosphorylation
  via Wnt/β-catenin/NeuroD1 signalling in T2D models. The AD-associated tau hyperphosphorylation
  in the hippocampus of db/db mice, HF-diabetic mice, and HT22 cells damaged by the
  high glucose environment was significantly higher than that in normal control. The
  mechanism in the current study could describe as exendin-4 activated the GLP-1 receptor
  on the hippocampal membrane, leading to the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway in
  the GLP-1 signalling pathway, and PKA could lead to an increase in the level of
  nonphosphorylated β-catenin, which activated the Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Then,
  the downstream factor NeuroD1 of this pathway is increased and translocated into
  the nucleus. NeuroD1 bound to the promoter region of the insulin-encoding gene Ins2,
  thereby promoting the production and secretion of insulin. The elevated insulin
  activates the insulin signalling pathway and inhibits the activity of GSK-3β, ultimately
  reducing the hyperphosphorylation of AD-associated tau proteins regulated by GSK-3β
