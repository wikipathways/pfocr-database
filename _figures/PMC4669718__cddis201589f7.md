caption: 'Proposed model: importance of the miR-30 regulatory effects in cardiomyocytes
  following DOX exposure. Upon DOX treatment, there seems to be an acute increase
  of GATA-6 expression in cardiomyocytes. GATA-6 is able to repress miR-30 family
  expression, resulting in DOX-induced miR-30 downregulation. In turn, the expression
  levels of miR-30 targets are upregulated. Three of the miR-30 target genes are involved
  in the complex catecholamine/adrenergic pathway. A correct equilibrium of members
  is crucial in this signaling cascade, as AC-cAMP-PKA activation promotes cardiomyocyte
  contraction, whereas Gi impairs contraction but protects against apoptosis via Phosphoinositide
  3-kinase/Protein kinase B. In addition, miR-30 represses BNIP3L, which is involved
  in mitochondrial death. miR-30 expression seems to be essential in regulating mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathways and it is able to partially counteract DOX-induced toxicity.
