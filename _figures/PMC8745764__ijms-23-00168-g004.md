caption: Virally Mediated Fibrogenic Pathways. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host
  cell is dependent on ACE-2 receptors. The high-affinity binding between the S-Spike
  protein and ACE-2 receptors can trigger an imbalance of the RAS system, resulting
  in the accumulation of Ang II. When Ang II binds to the ATR1 receptor, it activates
  the PI3K/AKT pathway. TGF-β1 consequent activation triggers the SMAD2/3 pathway,
  which provides proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts. Viral infection
  endosomal route involves Cav-1 and ACE-2 on the lipid rafts. Cav-1 is also involved
  in the negative regulation of the TGF-β pathway. The physical interaction of Cav-1
  and TGF-β receptors on the lipid rafts results in the internalization and degradation
  of this receptor, culminating in a reduction in TGF-β signaling.
