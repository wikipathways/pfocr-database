caption: Proposed NLPR3 signaling mechanism in postoperative neuroinflammation. Aseptic
  surgical trauma induces a cytokine storm that engages several pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs), including the interlukin-1 (IL-1) receptor. Downstream signaling
  from these receptors relies on adaptor proteins such as MyD88, which eventually
  activates NF-κB to perpetuate the inflammatory response. Parallel to this process,
  surgery also elevated levels of ATP in the hippocampus. In combination with NF-κB
  activation this induced the NLRP3 inflammasome and ASC specks formation in microglia,
  thus contributing to postoperative neuroinflammation. Surgery also impaired the
  expression of hippocampal Annexin-A1 (ANXA1) that is critically involved in inflammation-resolution
  and can be regulated through our biomimetic peptide. Within this framework we found
  that treatment with ANXA1sp regulated NLRP3 expression and levels of IL-1β postoperatively.
  Given the established elevation of IL-1β in preclinical and clinical biofluids of
  subjects with postoperative neurocognitive disorders, harnessing this pathway may
  provide safer strategies to treat ensuing neuroinflammation.
