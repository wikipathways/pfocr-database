caption: The role of StarD7 in various cellular events in JEG-3 cells. StarD7 knockdown
  causes a reduction in ABCG2 and phospholipid synthesis, decreased cell migration
  and proliferation, and increased βhCG and syncytin-1 transcription []. High StarD7
  levels have been found in several types of cancers (). StarD7 is induced by the
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway [].
