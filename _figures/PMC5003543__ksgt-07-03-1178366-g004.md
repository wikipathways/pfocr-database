caption: Working model of consequences of PREX2 truncating mutations. PREX2 is bound
  to PTEN and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain is kept in inactive
  state associated with its C-terminus (C-term) in wild type cells. This results in
  basal levels of downstream signaling events. In tumors with truncating PREX2 mutations,
  mutant PREX2 is unable to interact with PTEN. Furthermore, its intramolecular inhibitory
  confirmation is lost resulting in activation of its GEF activity. This results in
  GTP loading of RAC1 that in turn leads to direct activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  These alterations (via still unknown links) perturb DNA methylation and H4K20 trimethylation
  at critical genomic imprint control region leading to downregulation of a key cell
  cycle regulator CDKN1C (also known as p57) and upregulation of IGF2 which result
  in increased cell growth and proliferation.
