caption: The magnetic properties of GML or OML particles guide the gemcitabine or
  oxaliplatin to the tumor area of nude mice under an external magnetic field (Nd2Fe12B
  magnet tablets). GML or OML has excellent half-life periods and can be gradually
  biodegraded in MCF-7 cells, lead to gemcitabine of GML (or oxaliplatin of OML) slowly
  released in target cells. In MCF-7 cells, OML inhibited the replication and transcription
  of DNA by forming inter-strand and intra-strand platinum-DNA adducts (Pt-GG and
  Pt-AG), while GML prevented the synthesis and repair of DNA by inhibiting activation
  of ribonucleotide reductase, and stopped the the synthesis of DNA and broken strands
  of DNA by replacing the cytidine of DNA strands with dFdCTP. It leads to the phenomenon
  of DNA ladder, increase of BAX and decrease of Bcl-2 and Survivin, eventual activation
  of caspase-9 and caspase-3 cause cell apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, resulting in MCF-7
  cell death.
