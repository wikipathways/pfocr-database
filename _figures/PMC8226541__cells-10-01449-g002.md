caption: 'Altered energy metabolism in ALS skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle, glucose
  enters into the cell through the GLUT4 transporter. It is then either stored as
  glycogen (not shown) or phosphorylated to give rise to pyruvate, the final product
  of glycolysis. Once formed, pyruvate enters into the mitochondria through a series
  of specific carriers (outer membrane: VDAC, inner membrane: MPC). In the mitochondria,
  pyruvate is oxidized into acetyl-CoA by PDH before entering the Krebs cycle to produce
  energy. Fatty acids enter the cell via FAT/CD36 transporters and get into the mitochondrial
  matrix thanks to CPT1 where β-oxidation will begin and produce acetyl-CoA which
  produces energy once in the Krebs cycle. In ALS, the oxidative pathway is greatly
  enhanced while the glycolytic pathway is reduced by abnormal induction of PDK4 in
  skeletal muscle which inactivates PDH by phosphorylation. PDK4 is believed to be
  at the root of this energy imbalance. Ac-CoA: acetyl-coenzyme A; CPT1: carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1; FAT/CD36: fatty acid translocase/cluster of differentiation
  36; GLUT4: Glucose transporter type 4; MPC: mitochondria pyruvate carrier, PDH:
  pyruvate deshydrogenase; PDK4: pyruvate deshydrogenase kinase 4; VDAC: voltage-gated
  anionic channel.'
