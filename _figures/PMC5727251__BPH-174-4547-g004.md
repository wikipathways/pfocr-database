caption: Inhibitors of the FZD/LRP/Wnt signalling cascade. This figure gives an overview
  of the inhibitors of LRP, FZD and Wnt that are discussed in this review. SOST, Wise
  and DKks interact with LRP and prevent its interaction with Wnt, thus preventing
  signal transduction. Inhibition of Wnt ligand can occur via WIF‐1, an inhibitor
  molecule that binds to Wnt and prevents its interaction with LRP/FZD. Furthermore,
  Wnt can be inactivated by the membrane‐tethered protease TIKI and extracellular
  de‐acylase Notum. sFRPs can function as Wnt signalling inhibitors by interacting
  with both Wnt and FZD. In addition, intracellular mi‐RNAs are known to interact
  with FZD‐coding mRNA to prevent translation, thereby decreasing FZD levels on the
  membrane. In addition to endogenous Wnt pathway inhibitors, two antibodies (OMP‐54F28
  targeting Wnt and OMP‐18R5 targeting FZD) are being currently explored as therapeutic
  agents.
