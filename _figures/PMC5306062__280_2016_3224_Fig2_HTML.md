caption: Mechanisms of cell death induced by benzopyran compounds by minor chemical
  modifications of the benzopyran scaffold. Minor modifications of the benzopyran
  scaffold alter the mechanisms of cell death. Phenoxodiol induces classic caspase-mediated
  apoptosis caused by inhibition of a surface NADH oxidase and disruption of the sphingomyelin
  cycle resulting in caspase-mediated apoptosis (pathway 1); ME-128, NV-143 and ME-344
  (previously NV-128) uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation resulting in
  autophagy mediated by increased AMP kinase due to changes in the ATP/ADP ratio and
  mTOR disruption and cell death induced by endonuclease G translocation to the nucleus
  that proceeds in the presence of a pan-caspase inhibitor (pathway 2 and 3); triphendiol
  (NV-196) induces both caspase-mediated and caspase-independent cell death (pathways
  1 and 2). Mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (I, II, III, and IV), along
  with complex V (ATP synthase), function together in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
  and are shown in the inset
