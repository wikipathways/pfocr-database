caption: Model of signaling pathway induced by E. chaffeensis infection. Binding of
  E. chaffeensis to its receptor(s) on host monocytes triggers protein cross-linking
  by TGase, which activates the receptor or nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. PTK activation
  mediates the translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2, which produces
  IP3. IP3 in turn induces Ca2+ release from internal stores. The depletion of Ca2+
  from internal stores activates store-operated calcium channels on the plasma membrane,
  and Ca2+ influx from external spaces contributes to the bulk of the increase in
  [Ca2+]i in response to the infection. Activation of TGase by Ca2+ constitutes a
  positive feedback loop, and this may facilitate entry of ehrlichiae into host cells
  or ehrlichial infection. The dotted lines indicate suggested pathways, and the solid
  lines indicate proven pathways.
