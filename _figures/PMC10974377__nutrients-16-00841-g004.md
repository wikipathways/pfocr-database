caption: 'Proposed bioconversion pathways of (A) digalloyl glucose and catechin gallate,
  (B) chlorogenic acid, and (C) prunin and phlorizin. The selected compounds among
  the guava-derived metabolites are compared the their relative contents in NFG, LFG,
  and LPG in the groups supplemented with 0%, 0.5%, and 2% of the guava leaf extract.
  The Y-axis of the graph represents peak areas of respective metabolites. Black text
  indicates a decrease in metabolites by fermentation with L. fermentum and L. plantarum.
  Green text indicates an increase in metabolite with LFG alone. Orange text indicates
  an increase in metabolites with LPG alone. Different letters indicate significant
  differences based on Duncan’s multiple-range test. (0%: 0% guava leaf group; 0.5%:
  0.5% guava leaf group; 2%: 2% guava leaf group; : non-fermented (NFG); : fermented
  by L. fermentum (LFG); : fermented by L. plantarum (LPG))'
