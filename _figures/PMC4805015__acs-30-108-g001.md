caption: The signal pathway of nicotine-induced angiogenesis via activation of nAChR
  in non-neuronal cells. Binding of nicotine to the α7-nAChR leads to calcium influx
  through ionic channel, which is enhanced by the simultaneous activation of voltage-activated
  Ca2+-channels. The induced calcium permeability recruits phospholipase C (PLC-g),
  leading to the formation of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).
  DAG then activates a signaling cascade through protein kinase C (PKC) and increased
  intracellular Ca2+ through (RAF1) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
  cascade. At the same time, IP3 acts on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and releases Ca2+
  from intracellular stores. These signaling cascades from calcium influx lead to
  stimulation of cell proliferation, migration and survival.
