caption: A primary etiological factor for PMOP is estrogen deficiency. When estrogen
  levels are insufficient, the inhibitory effect of estrogen and OC precursor cells
  on OC is weakened, leading to increased bone resorption; the number of BMSCs differentiating
  to OB is reduced, OB production is reduced, and bone synthesis is weakened, leading
  to bone metabolism. The expression of Dkk1 and SOST, the inhibitors of the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, is decreased when estrogen levels fall. This leads to the inhibition
  of Wnt proteins through binding to the Frizzled/LRP5/6 complex, which fails to stabilize
  β-catenin and promote its entry into the nucleus, diminishes the expression of Runx2
  and Osx, and diminishes OB activity. Diminished OB activity promotes decreased OPG
  expression and increased RANKL expression, which disrupts the OPG-RANKL-RANK pathway
  balance and exacerbates bone resorption. In estrogen deficiency, estrogen binds
  to its receptors with the reduced inhibition of RANKL, which in turn leads to the
  combination of RANKL and RANK on the surface of OC, resulting in increased OC. Estrogen
  also regulates the immune system. Estrogen inhibits pro-inflammatory factors such
  as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, while stimulating anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-4
  and IL-10
