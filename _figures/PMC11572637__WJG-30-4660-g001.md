caption: 'Effects of elafibranor on alcohol-associated liver disease in mice. Elafibranor
  (EFN) activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), inhibiting
  liver fibrosis in alcoholic liver disease through four primary mechanisms. First,
  it increases the expression of phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase-2, promoting
  lipid breakdown and fatty acid oxidation. Second, it enhances hepatocyte autophagy
  and increases antioxidant activity, specifically, superoxide dismutase 1 and catalase,
  thereby preventing hepatocyte apoptosis. Third, EFN reduces extracellular matrix
  production by regulating the activity of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors
  of metalloproteinases. Finally, it suppresses macrophage activation by inhibiting
  the lipopolysaccharide/Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway. Moreover, PPARδ activation
  improves intestinal permeability by preventing intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis
  and promoting M2 macrophage polarization. It also enhances intestinal barrier integrity
  by upregulating tight junction proteins, such as zonula occludens-1, occludin, and
  claudin-2. PPAR: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; ALD: Alcoholic liver
