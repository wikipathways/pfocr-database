caption: The proposed metabolic changes taking place in explanted liver. During energy
  production, phosphate groups are sequentially hydrolysed from ATP, creating ADP
  and then AMP. From AMP, the other metabolites are generated via a number of catabolic
  pathways. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ADP, adenosine diphosphate.
