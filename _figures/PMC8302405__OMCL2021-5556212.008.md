caption: Proposed scheme for the protective effects of SFI on the C2C12 mouse myotubes.
  A summary of our current hypothesis for the mechanisms by which the SFI protects
  against mouse myotube damage in cancer-related fatigue. The protective effects of
  SFI may be associated with the activation of AMPK and the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathways.
