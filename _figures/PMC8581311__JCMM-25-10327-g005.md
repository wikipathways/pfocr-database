caption: Schematic diagram of RET activation in endocrine sensitive and resistant
  tumours. Both endocrine sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells express all
  components of the RET signalling pathway, but endocrine sensitive breast cancer
  cells lack GDNF to initiate the resistance pathway. By contrast, endocrine resistant
  cells secret GNDF, which acts in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to promote endocrine
  resistance in nearby cells. Reprinted from []. Copyright © 2018, PLoS ONE
