caption: A schematic model showing the proposed biosynthetic pathway for cutin. Hydroxy
  fatty acid containing TAG is synthesized by the acylation of 16-hydroxy fatty acid
  (MHFA) and/or 10,16-dihydroxy fatty acid (DHFA) to glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) by
  specific acyltransferases (Gpat4 and Gpat6) to give lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)
  and MAG by the same enzyme. The synthesized MAG is acylated by a MAG acyltransferase
  to DAG. The last step in this pathway is catalyzed by DAG acyltransferase (DCR;
  At5g23940), which transfers an acyl group to DAG to form a TAG. The synthesized
  TAG could be either stored or transported for the synthesis of lipid-based cuticular
  polymers. The unusual hydroxy fatty acids are excluded from the membrane lipids.
  The stored TAG can be hydrolyzed by bodyguard gene (BDG) product to generate hydroxy
  fatty acids. The final polymerization is catalyzed by cutin synthase, and this enzyme
  may utilize either intact hydroxy fatty acid containing TAG or free hydroxyl fatty
  acids.
