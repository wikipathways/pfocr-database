caption: Genetic regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by SREBP-2. Hepatocytes synthesise
  HMGCR mRNA which in turn is translated into the enzyme HMGCR. HMGCR catalyses the
  synthesis of cholesterol which in turn influences its own transcription rate by
  interacting with the transcription factor SREBP; the transcription rate increases
  when cholesterol is low in the cell and declines when cholesterol is high. (SRE
  – sterol regulatory element; MH – HMGCR mRNA; C – cholesterol).
papertitle: A mathematical model of the sterol regulatory element binding protein
  2 cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.
