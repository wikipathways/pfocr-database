caption: Overview of the signaling pathways during EMT in lung cancer. Several signaling
  pathways which induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are selected. Transforming
  growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a key role in lung cancer cells during EMT, activating
  mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), SMAD2, and SMAD3 to induce EMT. It also
  induces the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) pathway which
  subsequently suppresses the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). GSK-3β then represses
  the expression of the snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAI1). Conversely,
  the expression of SNAI1 and SNAI2 is activated by MAPK. This derives EMT by suppressing
  the expression of epithelial-cadherin (E-cadherin). E-cadherin is also downregulated
  by the twist family bHLH transcription factor (TWIST) and forkhead box protein C2
  (FOXC2). Ras is activated by tyrosine kinase, which subsequently induces PI3K-AKT
  and MAPK, and eventually leading to EMT.
