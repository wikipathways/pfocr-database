caption: Animal models of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) targeting the mTORC1 signaling
  pathway. The mTORC1 signaling pathway is a key regulator of neuron growth and development.
  Mutations in genes encoding regulators of the mTORC1 pathway, including MTOR, PIK3CA,
  PTEN, TSC1, TSC2, RHEB, DEPDC5, NPRL2, and NPRL3 have been identified as a cause
  of FCD type II. Based on this, many animal models of FCD type II have been developed
  by genetically targeting various components of the mTORC1 pathway, either through
  genetic engineering (transgenic mice) or in utero electroporation. Transgenic mice
  result in diffuse malformation while in utero electroporation-based models result
  in focal malformation. Both models recapitulate key phenotypes associated with FCD
  type II, including cortical disorganization, neuronal misplacement, presence of
  enlarged dysmorphic neurons, and spontaneous seizures.
