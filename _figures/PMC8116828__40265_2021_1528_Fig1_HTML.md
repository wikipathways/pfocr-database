caption: S1P synthesis, degradation, export, and intracellular signaling [, –]. (a)
  Ceramide is broken down by ceramidases into sphingosine, which is phosphorylated
  by two sphingosine kinases (SphK1, SphK2), generating S1P within lysosomes and the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). SphK1 is mainly cytosolic and is translocated to the
  plasma membrane upon activation. SPHK2 is located within the mitochondria, nucleus,
  and ER. At the ER, S1P might be dephosphorylated by S1P phosphatase (SPP1,2) to
  sphingosine, which can be used for ceramide synthesis or irreversibly degraded by
  S1P lyases. S1P is also produced in the mitochondria and nucleus by SPHK2 with intracellular
  targets such as prohibitin 2 (PHB2) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) []. PHB2 stabilizes
  cytochrome c oxidases (COX), whereas HDACs remove acetyl groups from histones, altering
  gene transcription. S1P is transported out of the cell by specific ATP-binding cassette
  transporters like ABCA1, ABCC1, ABCG2, and Spinter Homolog 2 (SPNS2) protein [].
  Extracellular S1P can act in a paracrine or autocrine fashion binding to S1PRs and
  initiating downstream signaling. (b) S1P generated by SPHK1 in response to TNF binds
  to the TNF-receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, enhancing
  its activity and leading to lysine-63-linked polyubiquitination of the receptor-interacting
  protein 1 (RIP1) and activating the nuclear factor “kappa-light-chain-enhancer”
  within the NF-κB pathway, favoring transcription of proinflammatory cytokines [,
  ]. TRAF2 may alternatively bind to TRAF-interacting protein (TRIP), blocking S1P
  binding to TRAF2 and suppressing downstream signaling. (c) In response to IL-1,
  SPHK1 and the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2) form a complex with interferon-regulatory
  factor 1 (IRF1) leading to its polyubiquitination and activation. Consequently,
  IRF1 enhances the expression of the chemokine CXCL10 and CCL5, which are important
  for mononuclear cell recruitment to sites of inflammation [, ]
