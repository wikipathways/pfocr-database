caption: C. reinhardtii was subjected to nitrogen deplete or replete conditions before
  harvesting and quantifying changes in reversible oxidation via LC–MS/MS. The summary
  of oxidized cysteine sites quantified across the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway
  is presented. Blue cysteine residues indicate decreased oxidation, while grey residues
  were found in the dataset but did not significantly change under nitrogen deprivation.
  Proteins previously shown to be S-nitrosylated are denoted with pink, while those
  previously shown to be targets of thioredoxin are denoted with green. None of the
  chlorophyll biosynthesis proteins have been shown to contain glutathionylation.
