caption: 'Genes and proteins of strain S32 potentially involved in pectin catabolism.
  A: Genetic organization. Genes are symbolized by arrows; their name and ID number
  are given. B: Proposed metabolic pathway deduced from the predicted protein localization
  and from the function of homologous proteins. The extracellularly pectate lyase
  Pel1 generates unsaturated oligogalacturonides (u-oligoGalA) up to dimers (u-diGalA,
  unsaturated digalacturonide). The activity of outer membrane anchored polygalacturonases,
  PehA and PehB, generates saturated oligomers up to dimers (oligoGalA, oligogalacturonides;
  diGalA, digalacturonide). Extracellular oligomers enter the periplasm using the
  specific outer-membrane porin, KdgM. Short oligomers enter the cytoplasm using two
  specific transporters, TogMNAB and TogT. In the cytoplasm, they are further cleaved
  up monomers by the action of the exopolygalacturonase PehX and the oligogalacturonate
  lyase, Ogl. The two pathways involved in the catabolism of galacturonate (GalA)
  and unsaturated galacturonate (uGalA) converge to produce a common intermediate,
  KDG (2-keto-3-deoxygluconate) which is converted to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate.'
