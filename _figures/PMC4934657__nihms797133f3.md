caption: At least eight of the FA proteins, FANC- A, B, C, E, F, G, L, and M, form
  a complex which is predominantly nuclear and which is required for the monoubiquitination
  of the FA proteins, FANCD2 and FANCI, either during S phase or in response to DNA
  damage. This biochemical pathway is termed the FA pathway. FAAP24 and FAAP100 are
  associated with the FA nuclear core complex but have not been identified as FA genes
  (indicated by lighter colored symbols for these proteins in the figure). The ATR
  checkpoint kinase and USP1/UAF1 have also not been identified as FA proteins, but
  are critical for the regulation of FANCD2 monoubiquitination. ATR is required for
  FANCD2 monoubiquitination in response to DNA damage by an unknown mechanism and
  USP1/UAF1 deubiquitinates FANCD2. Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 is targeted to chromatin,
  where it interacts with the FA protein BRCA2/FANCD1. Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 organizes
  BRCA2/FANCD1 foci in response to DNA damage. PALB2/FANCN is a recently identified
  FA protein which is a partner of BRCA2FANCD1 required for its stability and recruitment
  to chromatin. BRIP1/FANCJ, like BRCA2/FANCD1 and PALB2/FANCN, is not required for
  FANCD2 monoubiquitination and is therefore proposed to function downstream of, or
  in association with, monoubiquitinated FANCD2. The functional relationship of BRIP1/FANCJ
  to other FA proteins has not been determined.
