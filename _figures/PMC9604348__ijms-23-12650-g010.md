caption: Schematic overview of the proposed model for photoperiod-induced β-carotene
  accumulation in the endocarp of XIS cucumber fruit. Arrows represent activation
  while T-bars represent repression. The gene names were the same as described in
  the main text. The question mark (?) denotes unknown molecular mechanisms involved
  between light signaling genes, carbohydrate-related genes, and putative carotenoid
  pathway genes.
