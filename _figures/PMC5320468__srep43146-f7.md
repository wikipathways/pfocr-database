caption: FAK can be activated in ischemic and hypoxic conditions; its downstream PI3K/AKT
  pathway is then activated through phosphorylation at the Tyr397 site, followed by
  mTOR/P70S6K activation. ERK1/2 can also be activated simultaneously. Both PI3K/AKT
  signalling and ERK1/2 are necessary for hypoxia-induced CF differentiation and ECM
  synthesis; this process also involves lysyl oxidase (LOX). Consequently, this response
  could be offset by FAK inhibitor.
