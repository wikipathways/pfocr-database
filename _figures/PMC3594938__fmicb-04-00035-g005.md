caption: Cell type-specific outcomes of KSHV interactions with CD36 and CD147 signaling
  pathways. (A) In melanoma-derived cells (Mel1700), KSHV upregulates both CD36 (and
  its ligand, TSP-1) and CD147 (as shown in Figure ). Binding of the PfEMP-1 CIDR1α-derived
  peptide, MC179, to virus-upregulated CD36 prevents Akt phosphorylation while inducing
  RTA-dependent KSHV reactivation via the MAPK/p38 pathway. Remarkably, structural
  mimics of MC179, such as the helical heptad repeat (HR) regions derived from KSHV
  glycoprotein B (gB), can, like MC179, also induce virus reactivation in a CD36-dependent
  manner (as shown in Figure ). (B) In lymphatic (LEC) and other endothelial cells
  such as mixed tolemerase-immortalized dermal microvascular and brain endothelial
  cells (tDMB), KSHV upregulates CD147 but unlike in Melanoma cells, the virus downregulates
  both CD36 and its angiostatic ligand, TSP-1; in vivo, these effects are likely to
  promote angiogenesis, invasion, and tumor metastasis. (C) As a key receptor for
  the merozoite invasion antigen, PfRh5, KSHV-induced upregulation of CD147 on the
  surface of infected endothelial cells increases the frequency of contacts between
  merozoite-bound or soluble PfRh5 and blood or dermal microvascular endothelial surfaces,
  resulting in induction of CD147-mediated signals that could alter the microenvironment
  and cause pathologic outcomes in a variety of physiological sites in the co-infected
  host.
