caption: Outline of methods and relationship between senescence and immune cells in
  the tumor microenvironment. A) TCGA renal clear cell carcinoma RNA-seq and whole
  exome sequencing data were used in combination with tumor staging and survival information
  to discern differences between metastatic (M1-stage IV, n = 79) and non-metastatic
  (M0-stage II/III, n = 297) tumors. Five different analyses were performed to determine
  immune infiltration, pathway activity, and mutation status. Outputs from these analyses
  were used in regression models to characterize and assess the role of the tumor
  microenvironment in metastatic disease. B) A diagram outlining a potential mechanism
  by which high oncogenic activity can lead to senescence induction, which has both
  pro and anti-tumorigenic effects.
