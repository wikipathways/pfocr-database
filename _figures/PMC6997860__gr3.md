caption: The Two Reasoning Methods Implemented in Pathmodel(A) Inference of a reaction
  between two known molecules.(B) Inference of reaction and metabolite structure corresponding
  to an unassigned m/z peak. Input data encoded in the knowledge base are in black;
  inferred reactions and metabolite structures are in green. In both cases, reaction
  substructure identification followed by inference of molecular transformations are
  common intermediate steps.
