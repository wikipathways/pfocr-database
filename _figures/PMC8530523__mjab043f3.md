caption: Metabolites as cofactors of the epigenetic machinery. The activity of epigenetic
  factors is regulated at multiple levels including transcription, translation, and
  post-translational modifications. It is increasingly recognized that small-molecule
  metabolites such as acetyl-CoA, SAM, NAD+, FAD, and α-KG serve as essential cofactors
  to modulate epigenetic factor activity. These metabolites are therefore regarded
  as metabolic sensors for programing pathway network of energy metabolism. Metabolic
  cofactors are produced in respective metabolic pathways, which participate in epigenetic
  modification processes through enzymes. Epigenetic modifications can be assessed
  by detecting relevant metabolic cofactors, which can be interfered with by targeting
  the regulation of metabolic cofactor expression.
