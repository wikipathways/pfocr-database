caption: 'Ubiquitin in the replication complex of Flaviviridae. 3 (NS3): TRIM69 ubiquitinates
  virus NS3 protein in the K11-linked way, causing NS3 degradation to inhibit DENV
  replication. TRIM5α inhibits replication and promotes the ubiquitination of its
  K48-linked and proteasome degradation by binding to Flaviviruses virus protease
  NS2B/3. But, NS3 is modified by the K27-linked polyubiquitin to promote virus replication.
  4B (NS4B): PRNF114 mediates the polyubiquitin of K27-linked NS4B, which degrades
  NS4B, through the proteasome pathway and then inhibits CSFV replication. 5A (NS5A):
  TRIM22 and SPSB2 directly target NS5A, and degrade it through ubiquitination to
  inhibit HCV replication. UBE2S and TRIM14 degrade NS5A protein through Lys11-linked
  and Lys48-linked proteasome-dependent pathways. SUMOylation improves the stability
  of NS5A protein by inhibiting ubiquitination, thus promoting the interaction between
  NS5A and NS5B protein. NS5A is the active target of ISGylation, but the roles of
  ISGylation remain obscure. 5B (NS5B): TRIM26-mediated K27-linked ubiquitination
  of NS5B at residue K51 enhances the interaction between NS5B and NS5A, thereby promoting
  the replication of the HCV. Fbw7 can interact with NS5B and degrade NS5B by K48-linked
  ubiquitination. (A) Replication complex of HCV and CSFV: PRNF114 mediates the polyubiquitin

  inhibits CSFV replication; TRIM22 and SPSB2 directly target NS5A, and degrade it
  through ubiquitination to inhibit HCV replication; UBE2S and TRIM14 degrade NS5A
  protein through Lys11-linked and Lys48-linked proteasome-dependent pathways. SUMOylation
  improves the stability of NS5A protein by inhibiting ubiquitination to promote the
  interaction between NS5A and NS5B protein; NS5A is the active target of ISGylation,
  however, whether the role of ISGylation is to promote or inhibit is controversial;
  TRIM26-mediated K27-linked ubiquitination of NS5B at residue K51 enhances the interaction
  between NS5B and NS5A to facilitate HCV replication; Fbw7 can interact with NS5B
  and degrade NS5B by K48-linked ubiquitination. Black arrows, promoting replication
  complexes; red arrows, inhibiting replication complexes. (B) Replication complex
  of Flaviviruses: TRIM69 ubiquitinates virus NS3 protein in the K11-linked way, causing
  NS3 degradation to inhibit DENV replication; the other studies show that NS3 is
  modified only by the K27-linked polyubiquitin to facilitate virus replication, and
  which linkages are needed to be discussed further; TRIM5α inhibits virus replication
  and promotes the ubiquitination of its K48-linked and proteasome degradation by
  binding to NS2B/3 (Flaviviruses protease); interferon stimulating gene 15 (ISG15)
  and sumo contribute to the stabilization of NS5 and promote virus replication.'
