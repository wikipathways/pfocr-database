  C2H4biosynthetic enzymes are expressed in a ripening-related manner, five of which
  are under C2H4 control.(A) Pathway of C2H4 biosynthesis in tomato.(B) Expression
  profiles for TS, CGS, two likely MSR homologs, SAM1, ACS2, ACS4, and ACO1. Gray

  a running mean when pseudoreplicates exist or expression of the gene shown if no
  pseudoreplicates exist. Only ESTs with substantial sequence homology were considered
  (E-value <1 × 10−10), and all EST clones have been sequence verified. The vertical
  dashed line denotes the breaker stage of fruit development. E4, ripening-related
  protein E4.
