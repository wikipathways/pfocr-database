caption: 'Different substrates and targets of p38 and their related activities. p38
  phosphorylates an immense number of proteins and can exert an indirect effect on
  an even wider network of molecules, highlighting the many functionalities of this
  pathway. Most of the target substrates are found in the nucleus, although other
  proteins have also been suggested to be activated by p38 in the cytoplasm. It has
  been shown that the p38 MAPK pathway can lead to rapid control of processes such
  as cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, or mRNA processing. In addition, it
  phosphorylates many transcription factors involved in gene expression mechanisms,
  which can lead to cytokine expression and other inflammatory events. In addition,
  p38 can also activate by phosphorylation a number of protein kinases named as MAPKAPKs,
  including MK2 and MSK1/2 []. Figure created using Servier Medical Art by Servier,
