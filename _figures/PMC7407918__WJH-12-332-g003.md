  Lipopolysaccharide, alcohol and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
  all capable of activating toll-like receptor 4 leading to myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88 (MyD88) activation. MyD88 association with interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1-4 results in activation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
  factor 6/transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 complex, which activates
  MAPKs c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase,
  facilitating transcription factors activator protein 1 and early growth response
  protein 1 to translocate to the nucleus and upregulate pro-inflammatory mediators.
  Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6/transforming growth factor beta-activated
  kinase 1-mediated phosphorylation of the IKKα-β-γ complex leads to IκB phosphorylation
  and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) translocation to the nucleus to upregulate pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. MyD88 signaling also activates NADPH oxidase 4 to produces ROS. ROS are
  also produced by the NADPH oxidase 1/ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1
  complex which is activated upstream by tumour necrosis factor alpha interacting
  with tumour necrosis factor alpha receptor type 1, at the cell surface, which activates
  complex I. ROS upregulate NF-κB translocation to the nucleus through IκB phosphorylation,
  nuclear factor κB inducing kinase activation and indirect protein kinase B activation.
  At high concentrations, ROS inhibit NF-κB activation through inhibition of IκB phosphorylation
  and S-glutathionylation of IKKβ. ROS inhibit dual specificity protein phosphatase
  1 and thioredoxin to further upregulate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. ROS
  inactivation of phosphatase and tensin homolog facilitates phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  to produce protein kinase B, which elevates ROS levels via increased oxygen consumption,
  and inactivates forkhead box protein O and downstream antioxidant expression. AKT:
