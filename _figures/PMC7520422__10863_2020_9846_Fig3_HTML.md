caption: Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is being synthesized as the intermediate metabolite
  in cardiolipin biosynthesis pathway. The lipid inhibits PC transfer between membranes,
  leading to the cancerous membrane abnormalities. PG activatess PKC, viral transcription
  and envelope formation, leading to the neoplasm progression and increased ratio
  of viral replication; PC - phosphatidylcholine, PKC – protein kinase C;
papertitle: Lipid composition of the cancer cell membrane.
