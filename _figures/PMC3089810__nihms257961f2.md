caption: Clustering of the BCR induces the assembly of a signalsome at the receptor
  containing Syk, BLNK and BLNK-associated molecules. The complex, in conjunction
  with the adaptor LAB activates signaling cascades that include the molecules Vav,
  Rac and Src-family kinases (such as fyn and blk). These signaling pathways activate
  endocytic machinery (the adaptor AP2, clathrin and actin) such that they can select
  cargo (receptors) for endocytosis and entry into the endocytic pathway. In our model,
  BCR complexes are selected for inclusion in clathrin-coated pits if they have AP2
  docking sites available (YXXL). If these motifs are blocked because they are phosphoryated,
  or they are obscured by recruited signaling molecules, the receptor is retained
  on the cell surface. Through this mechanism, BCR complexes involved in signal propagation
  are retained on the plasma membrane and are not targeted for degradation.
