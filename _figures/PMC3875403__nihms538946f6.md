caption: 'MDA-7 interferes with tumor promoting pathways. (a) A model is proposed
  to specify the pathways modulated by MDA-7 in the ER + (MCF-7) and HER-2/neu positive
  (SKBr3) cells. In both cell lines, apoptotic pathways are upregulated and cell cycle
  arrest is induced. AKT downregulation could be responsible for both outcomes; however
  XIAP and PDK1 are also affected by MDA-7 and could be involved in mediating the
  growth inhibitory effects. (b) A model is also proposed to show the differences
  observed upon MDA-7 expression in the triple negative (MDA-MB-468) cells. We did
  not observe a cell cycle arrest associated with MDA-7 in MDA-MB-468 cells, nor did
  we observe any change in p27, PDK1 or XIAP (shown by an ‘x’ through these pathways).
  Therefore, all the activity of MDA-7 is directed towards proapoptotic effects. (c)
  Proteins that were detected as having a greater than twofold change in expression
  by reverse phase protein array analysis are shown in a heat map. Green represents
  an increase in expression after Ad-mda7 infection compared with control, whereas
  red represents a decrease. Lighter shades of red or green indicate less than a twofold
  change, whereas darker shades indicated a greater than fivefold change in the protein.
  Proteins that showed at least a twofold change in one of the cell lines tested could
  be grouped into the pathways leading to apoptosis (cleaved caspase 7, cleaved PARP
  and XIAP), AKT-mediated cell cycle arrest (GSK3β, p21, p27 and AKT) and AKT-mediated
  cell survival (AKT, PDK1 and PTEN). There were several proteins involved in the
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway that were also modulated by MDA-7:
  pmTOR (mTOR phosphorylated at Ser 2481), estrogen receptor (ER), pTSC2 (tuberin
  phosphorylated at Thr1462), S6 kinase phosphorylated at Ser 240, the p70/S6Kinase
  complex, pAMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylated at Thr 172) and 4E-binding
  protein 1 (4E-BP1) phosphorylated at Thr 37.'
