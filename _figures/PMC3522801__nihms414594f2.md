caption: DNA damage (induction of DSBs) triggers activation of ATM () which in turn
  phosphorylates Chk2 on Thr68 causing its dimerization. In response to replication
  stress rather than DSB Chk2 can be phosphorylated by ATR. Within the dimer Chk2
  is further phosphorylated at Thr383, Thr387 and Ser516 which leads to its dissociation
  onto monomers. Both multi-phosphorylated dimers and monomers are enzymatically active
  and able to phosphorylate the downstream substrates. Among these substrates are
  the Cdc25C and Cdc25A phosphatases whose phosphorylation by Chk2 promotes binding
  to a 14-3-3 protein thereby preventing translocation into the nucleus and dephosphorylation
  of inhibitory phosphorylation at Thr14 and Tyr15 on cyclin/CDK complexes. This halts
  cell cycle transitions from G2 to M (Cdc25C) and G1 to S, (Cdc25A) respectively.
  Phosphorylation of Cdc25 phosphatases also accelerates their proteasomal degradation.
  A redundant mechanism of cell arrest in G1 involves phosphorylation of p53 by Chk2
  which may lead to upregulation of the cdk2 inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1. Phosphorylation
  of p53 may also result in upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Apoptosis
  may additionally be promoted by phosphorylation of PML and E2F-1. Phosphorylation
  of BRCA1 engages it in the DNA repair pathway.
