caption: The Bayesian Brain Immune and Microglia Module. A module that correlates
  with multiple late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) clinical covariates and is enriched
  for immune functions and pathways related to microglia activity (prefrontal cortex
  module shown). (Inner networks) The prefrontal cortex module is enriched in genes
  that can be classified as members of the complement cascade (complement), toll-like
  receptor signaling (toll-like), chemokines/cytokines (cytokines), the major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC), or Fc-receptor system (Fc). The direction and strength of interactions
  between these pathways are collected across all gene–gene causal relationships that
  span different pathways. The minimum line width corresponds to a single interaction
  (MHC–toll-like) and scales linearly to a maximum of 17 interactions (Fc–complement).
  (Outer networks) Each color-coded group of genes consists of the core members of
  the different families, and genes that are causally related to a given family. Core
  family members of each pathway are shaded darkly, whereas square nodes in any family
  denote literature-supported nodes (at least two PubMed [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed.]
  abstracts implicating the gene or final protein complex in LOAD or a model of LOAD).
  Labeled nodes are either highly connected in the original network, literature-implicated
  LOAD genes, or core members of one of the five immune families. Node size is proportional
  to connectivity in the module. Reprinted from Zhang et al. () with permission from
