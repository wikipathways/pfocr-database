caption: The route of invariant Natural Killer T (i NKT) cell activation impacts their
  effector function. For i NKT cells in unchallenged control mice, i.e. thymus‐derived
  i NKT cells, three routes of activation have been described. (a) In the direct or
  antigen‐dependent activation, a strong antigen, usually of foreign origin, binds
  to CD1d and activates i NKT cells via their semi‐invariant T‐cell receptor (TCR).
  αGalCer is depicted as an example. This direct activation leads to the production
  of both T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines, like interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) and tumour necrosis
  factor, and Th2 cytokines, like interleukin‐4 (IL‐4) and IL‐13, by the i NKT cells,
  which is sometimes referred to as a Th0 response. (b) The indirect or antigen‐independent
  activation does not require an engagement of TCR, but rather is achieved by the
  exposure of the i NKT cells to several pro‐inflammatory cytokines alone or in combination.
  Some cytokines could induce a preferential production of particular cytokines by
  the i NKT cells, leading to a Th1‐bias (more IFN‐γ and/or less IL‐4), Th2‐bias (more
  IL‐4, IL‐13 and/or less IFN‐γ), or Th17‐bias (more IL‐17A). The available data indicate
  a preferential activation of NKT17 cells in the case of the Th17‐bias. However,
  in the case of the Th1‐ and Th2‐biases it seems more likely that it is the result
  of a modulation of the i NKT cell cytokine response. (c) In the synergistic pathway
  the stimulation of i NKT cells depends both on the TCR and on cytokine receptors.
  In these cases, the stimulation provided by a weak antigen (signal 1) and sub‐optimal
  cytokine concentrations (signal 3), which are both too weak on their own to drive
  i NKT cell activation, can act together to achieve the stimulation of the i NKT
  cells. The antigens bound to CD1d could be of self or foreign origin. In the direct
  and synergistic pathways, the signal can also be amplified by the up‐regulation
  of the expression levels of CD1d,  and/or self‐antigens.,  Additionally, signal
  two, i.e. co‐stimulation/inhibition, can modulate i NKT cell responses.
