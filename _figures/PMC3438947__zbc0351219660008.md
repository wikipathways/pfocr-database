caption: A proposed mechanism for the functions of miR-30d and other interacting components
  in pancreatic β-cells. miR-30d plays a key role in stimulating insulin transcription
  () and secretion (C) by activating MafA and IRS2 through targeting MAP4K4 and other
  unknown genes (red indicates a newly discovered regulatory pathway by this study).
  Under normal conditions, high glucose induced the production of miR-30d (based on
  our previous publication ()), which further stimulates MafA ( and A), but not PDX-1
  (A), likely by targeting unknown negative regulators of MafA. In contrast, under
  stress conditions, TNF-α is activated, a process that not only inhibits miR-30d,
  but also activates MAP4K4 (), the negative regulator of MafA and IRS2. At this point,
  miR-30d directly targets MAP4K4 and promotes the production of MafA and IRS2 ( and
  ) and consequently insulin transcription and secretion, partially negating the reverse
  effects of TNF-α on β-cell functions. The function of miR-30d in activating insulin
  secretion is undermined by TNF-α-induced negative miRNAs miR-21, -34a, and -146
  (based on previous publications) ().
