caption: 'IL-2R signaling and modulation of T cell activity. IL-2R is composed of
  up to three subunits: α (IL2RA), β (IL2RB), and γ (IL2RG). The intermediate-affinity
  IL-2R is composed of the IL2RB and IL2RG subunits. The high-affinity receptor consists
  either of the cis gathering of the three subunits, for instance, on a T cell, or
  of the cis assembly of IL2RB and IL2RG complemented in trans with IL2RA located
  at the surface of a DC. IL2RB and IL2RG are respectively bound to the JAK1 and JAK3
  and responsible for transducing intracellular signaling. Upon ligation of IL-2,
  JAK3 phosphorylates JAK1, which in turn recruits to IL2RB the spleen-associated
  tyrosine kinase (SYK) and phosphorylates it. JAK1 also phosphorylates IL2RB, leading
  to the recruitment of the STAT5A or its paralog STAT5B. STAT5A/B is further phosphorylated
  by JAK3, but JAK1 could also be involved. Phosphorylated STAT5A/B is then released
  from IL-2R and dimerizes in the cytosol. The dimer can finally translocate to the
  nucleus and regulates genes encoding immune-related factors such as IL2RA itself,
  or again FOXP3, Fas-ligand (FASL), positive regulatory domain zinc finger protein
  1 (PRDM1), or suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 or 2 (SOCS1/2). The phosphorylation
  of IL2RB also creates binding sites for the SHC-transforming protein 1 (SHC1), which
  is phosphorylated probably by JAK1 or Lck (still unclear). SHC1 then recruits the
  Src homology 2 domain containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1).
  The SHC1/SHIP1 complex is stabilized through interaction with GRB2, itself associated
  with GRB2-associated binder 2 (GAB2). SHC1 promotes the phosphorylation of GAB2,
  but the kinase involved is not clear. Phosphorylated GAB2 can further recruit PI3Ks
  to the membrane, leading to the activation of the PI3K/PKB (best known as AKT)/mTOR
  pathway. JAK1 may also recruit PI3K. In the meantime, SHC1 recruits the complex
  GRB2/SOS. SOS interacts with, and activates, RasGRP1, resulting in the activation
  of the Ras/Raf pathway and the regulation of genes involved in T cell response.
