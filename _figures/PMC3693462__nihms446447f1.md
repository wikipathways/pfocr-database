caption: The fifteen known FA proteins (A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L, M, N, O,
  P) cooperate in a common DNA repair pathway (in green). The pathway is activated
  when a replication fork stalls at a cisplatin interstrand crosslink (ICL). The FA
  core complex binds to the stalled fork, leading to monoubiquitination and recruitment
  of the I and D2 proteins. The downstream FA proteins (D2, N, J, and O) are recruited
  to DNA repair complexes. Additional proteins (in red), while not bonafide FA proteins,
  are also required for function of the FA pathway and for repair of DNA crosslinks.
  The BRCA1 protein is an FA-like protein and binds in a complex with at least three
  bonafide FA proteins. Biallelic mutations in BRCA1 (see text) result in an inherited
  ovarian cancer (FA-like) syndrome.
