caption: 'Role of HMGB1 in the development of acute lung injury (ALI): extracellular
  high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) activates cell membrane TLR2, TLR4 and RAGE receptors.
  Activation of RAGE receptors leads to triggering of ROS-dependent activation of
  MAPK pathway. Though, activations of TLR2 and TLR4 by HMGB1 trigger activations
  of intracellular myeloid differentiation 88 (MyD88), which activates inhibitor of
  nuclear factor kappa B kinase (IKK-β). Both of IKK-β and mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) stimulate NF-κB signaling pathway. However, extracellular HMGB1 may
  directly activate NF-κB through phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) independent of TLRs or RAGE receptors leading to release
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines that result in ALI'
