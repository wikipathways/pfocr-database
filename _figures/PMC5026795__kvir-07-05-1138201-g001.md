caption: Recognition of C. albicans by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). CLRs
  and TLRs are major membrane receptors for recognizing C. albicans. (A) Fungal recognition
  by dectin-1 can activate Syk, NFAT, ERK and NF-κB or trigger reactions through Raf-1
  independent of Syk. The activation of dectin-1 results in the production of several
  inflammatory factors, including IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and COX2. (B) Dectin-1
  collaborates with TLR2 in producing ROS and activating NLRP3 inflammasome that facilitates
  IL-1β maturation. (C) Dectin-2 and dectin-3 form a heterodimer to detect microbial
  infections and initiate Syk-mediated activation of NF-κB. FcRγ is recruited to help
  dectin-2 and mincle to activate intracellular signaling cascades. Dectin-3 is also
  demonstrated to associate with FcRγ. Both TLR2 and TLR4 are vital receptors for
  pro-inflammatory reactions mediated by MyD88 and Mal. (D) TLR2 binding enhances
  the amount of IL-10 and TGFβ (Tumor growth factor β) through the ERK-cFos pathway,
  which will cause immunesupression and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory signals.
  (E) TLR4 is efficient in mediating pro-inflammatory reactions, releasing IL-8, IL-12
  and TNF. Besides individual effects, the combination of TLR1/TLR2 and TLR2/TLR6
  will enhance the production of cytokines.

  description: Recognition of C. albicans by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).
    CLRs and TLRs are major membrane receptors for recognizing C. albicans. (A) Fungal
    recognition by dectin-1 can activate Syk, NFAT, ERK and NF-κB or trigger reactions
    through Raf-1 independent of Syk. The activation of dectin-1 results in the production
    of several inflammatory factors, including IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and COX2.
    (B) Dectin-1 collaborates with TLR2 in producing ROS and activating NLRP3 inflammasome
    that facilitates IL-1β maturation. (C) Dectin-2 and dectin-3 form a heterodimer
    to detect microbial infections and initiate Syk-mediated activation of NF-κB.
    FcRγ is recruited to help dectin-2 and mincle to activate intracellular signaling
    cascades. Dectin-3 is also demonstrated to associate with FcRγ. Both TLR2 and
    TLR4 are vital receptors for pro-inflammatory reactions mediated by MyD88 and
    Mal. (D) TLR2 binding enhances the amount of IL-10 and TGFβ (Tumor growth factor
    β) through the ERK-cFos pathway, which will cause immunesupression and the inhibition
