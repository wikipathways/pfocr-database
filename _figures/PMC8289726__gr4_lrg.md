caption: 'SARS-CoV2 immunopathology, pathways implicated in hyperinflammation and
  cytokine storm (i) Interaction of CoV S-protein with host cell results in the degradation
  of IκB and the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB resulting in the transcription
  of genes encoding several inflammatory chemokines and cytokines inlcuding those
  of the TNF-α/IL-6 axis (ii) IL-6 promotes activation of JAK/STAT signaling, resulting
  in further production of IL-6 (iii) SARS-CoV2 infection results in the down-regulation
  of ACE2 receptors resulting in overproduction of angiotensin II which binds to AT1R,
  resulting in the further activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway and the overproduction
  of IL-6 (iv) The angiotensin II/AT1 receptor axis is implicated in activation of
  the NF-κB pathway (v) The produced cytokines cause the up-regulation of trypsin
  expression and activating matrix metalloproteinase resulting in the break down of
  the basal membrane, increased tissue permeability and immune cell recruitment and
  (vi) resulting in a MAS-like state. Abbreviations: IL-6: Interleukin 6, NFkB: Nuclear
  factor-kappa B, JAK/STAT: Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription,
  TNFα: Tumor necrosis factor alpha, ACE2: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2, AT1R:
  Type 1 angiotensin II receptor, MMPs: Matrix metalloproteinase, GM-CSF: Granulocyte
  macrophage-colony stimulating factor, MAS: Macrophage activation syndrome.'
