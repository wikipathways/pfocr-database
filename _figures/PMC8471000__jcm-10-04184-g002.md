caption: Hypothetical scheme of the regulatory nodes driving metabolic reprogramming
  toward aerobic glycolysis (left panel) or oxidative phosphorylation (right panel)
  in the kidney tubular epithelial cell. During early inflammation, activation of
  HIF-1α through the Akt/mTORC1 pathway, results in the expression of PKM2 and PDHK,
  which inhibits the conversion of pyruvate into Acetyl CoA, and therefore its entry
  into the mitochondria. This early phase is followed by a late phase, where the cell
  returns to the default metabolic phenotype which relies on OXPHOS for energy production.
  This switch is led by the cooperative activation of AMPK, PGC-1α, Sirt 1 and Sirt
  6. AMPK, PGC-1α and Sirt 1 are the key regulatory nodes that promote fatty acid
  oxidation and glucose oxidation (i.e., OXPHOS), whereas Sirt 6 may have a role in
  inhibiting the actions of HIF-1α on glycolytic enzyme expression. ACC, acetyl co-enzyme
  A carboxylase; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; MCP-1,
  monocyte chemoattractant molecule 1; NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized);
  NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced); TH17, type 17 T helper; TNF,
  tumor necrosis factor; Treg, regulatory T cell. Modified from ( [] and Pool R; Gomez
  H; Kellum J.A; Mechanisms of Organ Dysfunction in Sepsis. Crit Care Clin. 2018 Jan,
