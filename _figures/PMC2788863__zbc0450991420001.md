caption: Schematic representation of the BH4 recycling pathway and eNOS coupling.
  BH4 is synthesized from GTP via a series of reactions involving GTPCH, 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin
  synthase, sepiapterin reductase (SR) and DHFR. DHFR activity can be inhibited by
  MTX. GFRP, GTP cyclohydrolase feedback regulatory protein. PTPS, 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin
  synthase.
