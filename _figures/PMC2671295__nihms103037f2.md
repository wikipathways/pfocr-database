caption: PLA2 and PI3K/PTEN regulate chemotaxis in Dictyostelium. In Dictyostelium,
  chemotaxis is regulated by at least two intertwined and partly redundant pathways
  involving PI3K and PLA2. Both pathways are regulated by extracellular cAMP. The
  PI3K pathway is regulated, via PtdIns(4,5)P2 (PIP2)/PTEN, by PLC. The PLA2 pathway
  depends on cytosolic Ca2+, which is regulated by IP3 (thus partly by PLC), fatty
  acids and Ca2+ uptake. In steep gradients, either pathway is dispensable; in shallow
  gradients, both pathways are necessary to allow efficient chemotaxis (see text for
  details). Red arrows indicate enzymatic reactions. PL, phospholipids; Lyso-PL, lyso-phospholipids;
  Gαβγ, heterotrimeric G protein; cAR1, cAMP receptor; PIP3, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.
