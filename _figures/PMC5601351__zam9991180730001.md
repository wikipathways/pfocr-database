caption: Proposed de novo biosynthetic pathways and the relevant genes of biotin and
  lipoic acid in C. glutamicum. Fatty acid biosynthesis in this organism begins with
  the reaction of acetyl-CoA carboxylase consisting of three subunits, AccBC, AccD1,
  and AccE, and then proceeds to the FAS-I pathway consisting of FasA and FasB. The
  biotin biosynthesis pathway of C. glutamicum is incomplete due to the lack of bioF
  and the gene for the de novo synthesis of pimeloyl-CoA (or pimeloyl-ACP). In the
  previous study, we demonstrated that E. coli bioBF and B. subtilis bioI could bridge
  the gaps (). The origin of pimeloyl-CoA (or pimeloyl-ACP) in vivo could be the fatty
  acid biosynthesis pathway, but this remains speculative. In contrast, lipoic acid
  is assumed to be synthesized from octanoyl-CoA (or octanoyl-ACP) in a manner similar
  to that of E. coli (). The octanoyl moiety is first transferred to the apoprotein
  (E2) by LipB and is then converted to lipoic acid by LipA to form lipoyl-E2. Also
  in this case, the origin of octanoyl-CoA (or octanoyl-ACP) remains an enigma. TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid.
