caption: Figure 1. Signaling crosstalk between the UPR and autophagy in the nervous
  system. mHTT pathogenesis triggers ER stress, engaging UPR stress sensors. Activated
  ERN1/IRE1 induces the TRAF2-MAPK8 pathway, inducing autophagy independent of XBP1.
  PERK activation and phosphorylation of EIF2S1/eIF2α, leads to upregulation of ATG12
  possibly through the transcriptional activity of ATF4. XBP1 negatively regulates
  the levels of FOXO1, inducing its degradation by the proteasome. Then, inactivation
  of XBP1 protects against HD due to increased accumulation of FOXO1 and the upregulation
  of its target genes, which include many autophagy regulators. Signaling events related
  with aging (i.e., insulin and IGF1 signaling) may intersect in FOXO1 and XBP1 to
  modulate autophagy levels in HD.
