caption: Schematic of merlin and p75NTRsignaling in myelinating and demyelinated Schwann
  cells versus schwannoma cells.(A) Merlin is dephosphorylated in myelinating Schwann
  cells, which promotes cellular quiescence. (B) When nerve injury occurs, Schwann
  cells are denervated and merlin is phosphorylated. Denervated Schwann cells may
  either proliferate or undergo apoptosis. Activation of p75NTR by binding to proneurotrophin
  promotes apoptosis by gamma secretase cleavage resulting in an intracellular domain
  that promotes apoptosis. p75NTR also activates the JNK pathway. (C) Signaling downstream
  of p75NTR is deranged in schwannoma cells. JNK activation by p75NTR promotes survival
  through a nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) dependent pathway and also through an NF-κB
  independent pathway. NF-κB is also directly activated by p75NTR. Inhibitors of NF-κB,
  such as BAY11-7082 (BAY11) and of JNK, such as SP600125 or lnhibitor of JNK-based
  on JNK-interacting protein-1 (I-JIP), have been shown to reduce schwannoma cell
  survival in vitro, confirming that NF-κB and JNK represent potential therapeutic
  targets.
