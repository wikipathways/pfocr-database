caption: PhoQ repression by high extracellular magnesium leads to low levels of phosphorylated
  PhoP (PhoP-P) and basal expression of QueE, sufficient for QueE's function in the
  queosine tRNA modification pathway. Septation is unaffected. Strong stimulation
  of PhoQ by cationic antimicrobial peptides leads to an increase in levels of PhoP-P,
  which results in increased transcription of queE. When cells produce high levels
  of QueE, the protein associates with the divisome and inhibits septation.
