caption: This figure illustrates the (a) activated and (b) deactivated states within
  the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt protein engages with the extracellular
  N-terminal region of the Fz receptor family, which consists of a 7-transmembrane
  domain receptor. Mediation of the Wnt signaling pathway necessitates the involvement
  of the LRP. In the absence of Wnt coupling to Fz, β-catenin undergoes phosphorylation,
  marking it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This phosphorylation event is specifically
  mediated by GSK3 within a complex that includes Axin, APC, and CK1α. The binding
  of Wnt to the receptor results in the downregulation of the Axin, APC, GSK3, and
  CK1α complex. This inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation allows its translocation
  into the cellular nucleus, where it associates with TCF/LEF factors, thereby augmenting
  the transcriptional activity of various genes. Fz, Frizzled; LRP, low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; APC, adenomatous polyposis
  coli; CK1α, Casein Kinase 1 alpha; TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor
