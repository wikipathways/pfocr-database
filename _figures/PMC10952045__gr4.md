caption: Various molecular mechanism of the osteogenic and osteoclastogenic function
  through cellular uptake of GNPs and functionalized GNPs. Osteogenic differentiation
  of MSCs by GNPs uptake through p38 MAPK signaling pathway (a), enhanced osteogenesis
  by hydroxyapatite-decorated GNPs by activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  (b), interactions of GNPs with primary osteoblasts and its gene stimulation for
  osteogenesis (c), and inhibition of osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow-derived
  macrophages by curcumin-loaded GNPs through RANKL-induced signaling pathways. Reprinted
