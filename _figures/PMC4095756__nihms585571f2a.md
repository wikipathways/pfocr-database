caption: The role of GRK2 in cardiac insulin receptor signaling and myocyte glucose
  uptake. A) Normally, insulin binding to its receptor activates a downstream signaling
  process involving IRS1 that ultimately results in the movement of GLUT4 from the
  cytosol to the membrane, allowing for increased glucose uptake. B) Excess GRK2,
  as in heart failure, attenuates the insulin response via phosphorylation of IRS1
  and inhibition of GLUT4 membrane translocation. The net result of GRK2’s action
  on the insulin signaling pathway in the myocyte is insulin resistance and glucose
  intolerance.
