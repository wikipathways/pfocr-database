caption: Main apoptosis mechanisms induced by MOMP, MIMP, and MPT. (1) Bak/Bax aggregates
  and forms pores in the OMM. Cyt c, AIF, Smac, and other molecules leak from the
  pores. After a series of reactions, Cyt c, Apaf-1, and procaspase-9 assemble into
  apoptotic bodies and subsequently activate caspase-3. Caspase-3 inhibits inflammation
  and induces apoptosis. The released Smac can inhibit the antiapoptotic effect of
  XIAP. (2) MIMP occurs after MOMP. Under pathological conditions or in the absence
  of caspases, the cGAS-STING signaling pathway can be activated by mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA) and AIF to release IFN-β and other inflammatory factors, thus triggering
  inflammation. (3) Changes in intracellular ROS, Ca2+ concentration, or mitochondrial
  membrane potential depolarization can induce MPTP to remain open, leading to changes
  in both outer and inner mitochondrial membrane permeability. During MPT, Cyt c,
  AIF, Smac, and other molecules are released, inducing apoptosis in a caspase-3-dependent
  manner.
