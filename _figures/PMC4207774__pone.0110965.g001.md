caption: '(A) Biosynthetic pathway of hydroxymalonyl-ACP. The final FAD dependent
  oxidation step catalyzed by ZmaE may proceed through an endiol intermediate (red),
  resulting in the loss of stereospecificity at C2 of the final product, hydroxymalonyl-ACP.
  (B) ZMA PKS/NRPS. Nine extender units are utilized to form the precursor of metabolite
  A (green), zwittermicin A (red), and metabolite B (blue). Hydroxymalonyl-ACP is
  recognized by ZmaA (dotted line). Each circle represents a catalytic domain of the
  PKS/NRPS: C, condensation; A, adenylation; PCP, peptide carrier protein; E, epimerization;
  KS, ketosynthase; AT, acyltransferase; KR, ketoreductase; ACP, acyl carrier protein;
  Pr, protease; TE, thioesterase. (C) Natural prodrug activation. ZmaL is proposed
  to catalyze the cleavage of the ZMA precursor molecule from ZmaB-bound alanine,
  which is further condensed to leucine and methionine to form metabolite B (blue).
  ZmaM is proposed to catalyze the separation of metabolite A (green) from ZMA (red).'
