caption: Model for the antagonistic effects of CML37 and CML42 on different stress
  responses in Arabidopsis. CML37 and CML42 are Ca2+ sensors that act antagonistically
  on the plant stress response to drought, herbivores and necrotrophs. After sensing
  Ca2+ elevations in the cell, they bind to yet unknown targets [CML37/CML42 interacting
  protein(s)] and influence downstream phytohormone pathways. CML37 positively influences
  the ABA elevation induced by drought stress, enhancing drought tolerance. CML42
  negatively affects the drought-induced ABA elevation, and thus the drought tolerance.
  CML37 has a positive effect on the jasmonate biosynthesis that is counteracted by
  CML42. CML42 negatively influences jasmonate-dependent responses. Thus CML37 positively
  influences the defense against herbivores, whereas CML42 has a negative impact.
  Further CML37 and CML42 play the same roles in the defense against necrotrophic
  fungi, which might be connected to their effects on the jasmonate signaling pathway.
  In all shown defense reactions positive and negative effects of CML37 and CML42
  are balanced out. CML37 and CML42 might be used for fine tuning these stress responses.
  Symbols: + means a positive influence,—a negative influence, dashed lines indicate
  that the influence was proven indirectly by examining the double knock out line
  of CML37 and CML42
