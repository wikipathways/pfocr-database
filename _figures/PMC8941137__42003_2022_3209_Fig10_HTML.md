caption: An initial insult or injury can change the fitness level of some β-cells
  within β-cell populations and trigger cell competition. a After metabolic stress
  such as intake of an HFD in non-diabetic (ND) or wild-type (WT) mice, suboptimal
  cells (blue) are eliminated from the tissue by competition with healthy β-cells
  (green), which replicate to regenerate the lost tissue. b In a cell competition
  in which injury is sustained (T2D) or in PFKFB3WT DS mice, injured β-cells (pink)
  survive inspite of reduced fitness and cannot be purged from the tissue because
  of metabolic remodelling by the HIF1α–PFKFB3 pathway. These injured β-cells may
  impede healthy β-cell replenishment (replication). c Under conditions described
  in (b), the targeting of the pro-survival PFKFB3 leads to activation of cell competition
  and elimination of suboptimal (damaged) β-cells (light pink). Elimination of suboptimal
  (damaged) β-cells leads to replication of the remaining healthy β-cells (MCM2-positive
  cells, dark green).
