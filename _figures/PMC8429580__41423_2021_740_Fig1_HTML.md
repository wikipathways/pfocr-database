caption: 'Mechanisms of canonical, noncanonical, and alternative NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. (Left) Canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires two steps: the
  priming step and the activation step. During the priming step, the ligands of toll-like
  receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and cytokine receptors induce the expression
  of pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 via the myd88-NF-κB pathway. During the activation step,
  a wide variety of PAMPs or DAMPs promote NLRP3 inflammasome sassembly by multiple
  molecular and cellular events, such as K+ efflux, Cl− efflux, mitochondrial dysfunction,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) release, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) production, and
  lysosomal disruption. Once the NLRP3 inflammasome is assembled and activated, it
  induces pro-caspase-1 self-cleavage and activation, which results in the maturation
  of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and interleukin 18 (IL-18).
  In addition, activated caspase-1 also cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) and releases its
  N-terminal domain, which transfers to the cell membrane and forms pores, mediating
  the release of cellular contents, including the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and
  IL-18, and inducing a type of inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis. (Middle)
  Noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation is initiated by cytosolic LPS, which
  can be recognized by caspase-11 in mice (or caspase-4 and caspase-5 in human) via
  direct interactions, resulting in caspase-11 autoproteolysis and activation. Then,
  activated caspase-11 opens the pannexin-1 channel to induce K+ efflux, resulting
  in canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β and IL-18 maturation. In parallel,
  activated caspase-11 also cleaves GSDMD to induce membrane pore formation and pyroptosis,
  which contribute to IL-1β and IL-18 release. (Right) Alternative NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation only requires a single signal. TLR ligands alone are sufficient to activate
  the NLRP3 inflammasome in human and porcine monocytes via the TLR4–TRIF–RIPK1–FADD–CASP8
  signaling axis, which cannot induce K+ efflux, ASC speck formation, or pyroptosis'
