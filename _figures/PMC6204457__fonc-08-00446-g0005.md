caption: Proposed miRNA-182/183 FOXO1 p21/27 signaling pathway. (A) Inhibition of
  miR-182 and miR-183 upregulates the expression of FOXO1, which in turn inhibits
  cell proliferation probably by acting on its downstream targets, namely, p21 and
  p27, and invasive ability of mesothelioma cells. (B) Treatment with FOXO1 siRNA
  counteracts the inhibitory effects of miR-182 and miR-183. (C) Proposed mechanisms
  underlying the effects of miR-182 and miR-183 on cell proliferation and invasion
  assay through FOXO1.
