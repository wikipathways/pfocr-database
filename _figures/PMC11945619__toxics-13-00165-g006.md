caption: Principal component analysis (PCA) of growth and development indices and
  related genes in the liver tissue of Rana zhenhaiensis tadpoles after exposure to
  polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS). Panel (a) displays oxidative stress (OS)-,
  liver injury (LI)-, glycolysis (EMP)-, and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)-related
  genes alongside growth and development indicators. Panel (b) shows amino acid metabolism
  (AAM) and lipid metabolism (LM) genes, as well as growth and development indicators.
  Panel (c) includes genes from the JAK/STAT, TLR, NF-κB, and MAPK signaling pathways
  along with growth and development indicators. Panel (d) illustrates the PIK-AKT-MTOR
  signaling pathway and apoptosis (PCD) in relation to growth and development indicators.
  The horizontal axis represents the first principal component (PC1), while the vertical
  axis represents the second principal component (PC2). Growth indicators include
  body weight, body length, hind limb length, and cumulative metamorphosis rate (indicated
  by green labels). Black tags denote different genes, and blue arrows indicate the
  contributions and directions of various original variables
