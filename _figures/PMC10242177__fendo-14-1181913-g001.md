caption: The signaling pathway of MSTN. The binding of MSTN to ActRIIA and ActRIIB
  requires the involvement of activin-like kinase (ALK) 4/5, which subsequently leads
  to the phosphorylation of the downstream Smad2/3 complex, which in turn recruits
  Smad4. Meanwhile, phosphorylated Smad2/3 also inhibited AKT activation and promoted
  the dephosphorylated of FOXO. The Smad complex and dephosphorylated FOXO can enter
  the nucleus and act as transcription factors to regulate the expression of MuRF1
  and Atrogin1 muscle atrophy-related proteins.
