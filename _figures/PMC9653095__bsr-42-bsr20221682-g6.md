caption: See the text for abbreviations. Plasma Trp exists largely bound to albumin
  and its tissue uptake depends on how much exists freely, which depends on levels
  of albumin and the physiological displacers NEFA. Albumin is decreased and NEFA
  are increased in cancer, hence the increase in free [Trp]. Kyn metabolite formation
  is controlled by flux of free Trp down the KP and activities of TDO and IDO. Increased
  production of some Kyn metabolites in host and tumour undermines innate immunity.
  Down regulation of QPRT in host results in impaired conversion of QA into NAD+.
  A further loss of NAD+ in host results from activation of the AhR by KA and subsequent
  up-regulation of the NAD+ consumers PARPs and SIRTs. Tumours recruit Trp from host
  with the help of Trp transporters and ensure an uninterrupted production of Kyn
  metabolites to undermine T-cell activity by up-regulating TDO, IDO and FAMID and
  simultaneously maintain adequate NAD+ levels by up-regulating the salvage pathway.
