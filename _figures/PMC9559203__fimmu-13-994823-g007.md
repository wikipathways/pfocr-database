caption: Summarized image of the role of basophils of responders and non-responders
  in CSU. Basophils of responders are activated via both the IgE-FcϵRI and C5a-C5aR
  pathways. On the other hand, basophils of non/low-responders are activated via the
  C5a-C5aR, but not the IgE-FcϵRI pathway. Therefore, C5a-C5aR stimulation may be
  a main activation pathway of non/low-responders with CSU. Histamine released from
  basophils may synergistically induce TF expression on vascular endothelial cells
  together with certain proinflammatory substances, such as LPS, TNFα. Spontaneous
  histamine released from basophils and other TF inducers may contribute to the synergistic
  expression of TF on vascular endothelial cells, followed by C5a production through
  the extrinsic coagulation pathway.
