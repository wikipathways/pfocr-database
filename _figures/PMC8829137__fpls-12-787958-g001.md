caption: Phytohormone pools affected by GBH, phosphate fertilizer and their combination
  in three crop species. Phytohormones, their precursors and metabolites; compounds
  that were analyzed in this study are indicated with abbreviations after the compound
  name. Additional compounds (without abbreviations) were added to show common pathway
  intermediates and to show biosynthetic origins of phytohormones. Chorismate derives
  from the shikimate pathway which includes the target site of glyphosate. By blocking
  the EPSPS enzyme, an essential biosynthetic step is corrupted, which is often shown
  to cause decreased biosynthesis of metabolites synthesized downstream of the shikimate
  pathway. Centrally placed hexahedron highlights the possible interactions between
  hormones also known as hormone crosstalk. Symbols (arrows and stops) besides and
  below metabolites (left side = oat, right = potato, and below = strawberry) indicate
  the effect of treatment (blue = phosphate, yellow = GBH, blue + yellow = phosphate
  + GBH) on each plant species corresponding to significances shown in  (N = 40).
