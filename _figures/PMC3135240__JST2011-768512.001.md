caption: 'There are four different MAPK pathways in mammalian cells: extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (Erk1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38MAPK,
  and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-5 (Erk5/BMK1) [, ]. Erk is mainly activated
  by mitogenic stimuli such as growth factors and hormones, and JNK and p38 are mostly
  activated by stress stimuli, and, are, therefore, sometimes categorized as stress
  kinases. Erk5 is activated by both stress stimuli and growth factors []. MAPKs are
  activated as part of three-tiered kinase cascades: they are activated by simultaneous
  phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by dual-specificity MAP kinase
  kinases (MAPKK), which are themselves activated by serine/threonine phosphorylation
  by MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKK) [, ] (). Upstream of MAPKKKs lie additional
  protein kinases (such as Ste20-related protein kinases) or members of the Ras and
  Rho families of small GTPases. An additional layer of regulation has been described
  in proximal tubular epithelial cells in culture, in which activation of Src by PLCγ
  lies upstream of Ras and activates Erk []. Pathways distinct from the kinase cascades
  described above can contribute to MAPK activities, and to cell specificity of MAPK
  activation. This paper will focus only on the role of the Erk1/2 pathway in kidney
  disease.'
