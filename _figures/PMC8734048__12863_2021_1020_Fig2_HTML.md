caption: 'Trehalose metabolic pathway obtained from MetaCyc. A Trehalose biosynthesis
  pathway in Variovorax sp. PAMC28711. B Trehalose degradation pathway in Variovorax
  sp. PAMC28711. Note: “X” represents that the absence of the respective enzyme. Note:
  dashed line (without arrowheads) between two compound names implies that the two
  names are just different instantiations of the same compound. i.e., one is a specific
  name and the other is a general name, or they may both represent the same compound
  in different stages of a polymerization-type pathway. If the enzyme is shown in
  bold, there is experimental evidence for this enzymatic activity'
