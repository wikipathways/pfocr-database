caption: 'Wnt signalling in the adult Drosophila midgut during homeostasis, regeneration,
  ageing and hyperplasia. (i) Schematic of the cellular composition and architecture
  of the adult Drosophila midgut epithelium and its microenvironment; (ii) Main sources
  of the Wnt stem cell niche and pathway activation during intestinal homeostasis.
  The VM and EBs produce Wg ligand to active signalling within ISC and drive their
  proliferation. Wg signalling activation in ECs by Tnks and Ebd inhibit ISC proliferation
  non-autonomously; (iii) Sources of the Wg stem cell niche and pathway activation
  during intestinal regeneration following damage and upon ageing. Up-regulation of
  Wg from EBs activates Wg signalling and its downstream target dMyc to drive ISC
  proliferation. The VM niche expresses Wg but is dispensable for ISC proliferation
  in this context; (iv) Wnt pathway activation during intestinal hyperplasia and functional
  pathways downstream of Apc. JNK and Yki activation in Apc−/− cells drive ISC proliferation
  and cell competition leading to apoptosis of neighbouring wild type cells. ISC:
  intestinal stem cell; EB: enteroblast; EC: enterocyte; ee: enteroendocrine cell;
  BM: basement membrane; VM: visceral muscle; esg: escargot; hdc: headase; Wg: Wingless;
  Tnks: Tankyrase; Ebd: Earthbound; Ewg: Erect wing; Yki: Yorkie; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; Upds: Unpaired cytokines; EGFR: Epithelial growth factor receptor; JAK:
  Janus kinase.'
