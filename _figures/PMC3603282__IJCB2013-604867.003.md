caption: 'Schematics of early secretory pathway compartments during recombinant IgG
  overexpression. (a) Increased efficiency in protein synthesis, translocation, and
  oxidative protein folding, in conjunction with limited capacities at the ER exit
  sites, can lead to a progressive accumulation of export-ready IgG in the ER lumen.
  VTC: vesicular tubular cluster. ERGIC: ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. (b) Upon
  reaching a critical threshold concentration, IgG crystals can form in the ER. Accumulated
  IgGs support the rapid growth of intra-ER crystals. Crystalline body formation in
  turn alleviates the crowding in the ER. Newly folded IgG will have two competing
  fates once the crystalline body phenotype is initiated. The first path is to become
  part of the growing crystals. The second path is to be packaged into COP II vesicles
  to exit the ER. After crystalline body is induced, many attempts to increase protein
  synthesis may not directly translate into a higher protein secretion output due
  to the two competing pathways.'
