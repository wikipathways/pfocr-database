caption: Pathophysiology of NAFLD in lean individuals. In genetically predisposed
  (PNPLA3, TM6SF2) lean or non-obese individuals, free fatty acids (FFAs), mainly
  derived from the visceral adipose tissue, are taken up by the liver. Hepatic FFA
  accumulation can be influenced by the presence of insulin resistance, dysfunctional
  adiposity, and/or and lifestyle habits (unhealthy diets, physical inactivity). Excess
  of dietary sugars (glucose, fructose) are converted into FFAs by de novo lipogenesis
  (DNL). FFAs in the liver mitochondria undergo β-oxidation or are converted back
  into triglycerides (TGs) for export to the circulation via VLDL. Overwhelming of
  FFA disposal mechanisms leads to accumulation of TGs as lipid droplets in the hepatocytes
  (non-alcoholic fatty liver; NAFL). When the FFA pool expands further, cytotoxic
  lipid species (e.g., LPCs, DAGs, and ceramides) are produced, which ultimately mediate
  oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and inflammasome activation.
  These pathological processes lead to hepatocellular injury, inflammatory cell recruitment,
  and apoptosis/necroptosis to produce the histological phenotype of non-alcoholic
  steatohepatitis (NASH). Major modulators of the hepatocellular response to lipotoxic
  stress may include the gut microbiota products; a variety of cytokines, chemokines,
  and adipokines; free cholesterol; uric acid; and possibly periodic hypoxia caused
  by obstructive sleep apnea. Overinduction of inflammatory processes then stimulates
  hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and activates fibrogenesis. HSC activation is the final
  common pathway for a diverse group of signals, such as transforming growth factor-beta
  (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGF-β), interleukins (ILs), hedgehog
  ligands (Hhs), and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Increased tissue inhibitors of
  matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) cause inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs), thereby leading to net gain of fibrosis tissue by the liver. Excessive and
  disorganized fibrous tissue causes disruption of hepatocellular architecture and
  nodule formation, leading to cirrhosis of the liver. PNPLA3, patatin-like phospholipase
  domain containing 3; TM6SF2, Transmembrane 6 superfamily 2; CETP, Cholesteryl ester
  transfer protein; SREBF-2, sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor
  2; LPCs, lysophosphatidylcholines; DAGs, diacyl glycerols; PMNs, polymorphonuclear
  leucocytes; NKTs, natural killer T cells; Tregs, regulatory T cells.
