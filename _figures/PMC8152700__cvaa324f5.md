caption: The Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays an important role in cardiac fibrosis. In
  the absence of Wnt, cytoplasmic β-catenin is continuously degraded by the Axin complex,
  which involves casein kinase 1 (CK1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and glycogen
  synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Wnts are released in injured and remodelling myocardium
  and bind to Frizzled transmembrane receptors and their co-receptors LRP5/6. This
  complex recruits the scaffolding protein Dishevelled (Dvl) and inhibits axin-mediated
  β-catenin phosphorylation, which is required for ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation. Thus, through the effects of Wnts, β-catenin is stabilized and translocates
  to the nucleus, where it interacts with T cell Factor (TCF), regulating gene expression.
  Activation of β-catenin in cardiac fibroblasts has been implicated in fibrogenic
  signalling and in paracrine hypertrophic effects on cardiomyocytes. Secreted frizzled-related
  proteins (sFRP) bind to Wnts and inhibit their actions.
