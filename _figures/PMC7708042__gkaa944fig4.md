caption: Mechanisms of DNA breakage formation induced by G4 stabilization. (A) G4
  can be bound by a nuclease (DNA2) that then cleaves the DNA strand. (B) G4s can
  be a barrier to DNA synthesis by DNA polymerases leading to either fork collapse
  and DNA damage or re-priming by a second DNA polymerase downstream to the G4 generating
  a single-strand break (SSB). The SSB then becomes a double-strand break (DSB) at
  the next round of DNA replication in daughter cells. (C) G4s can stabilize co-transcriptional
  R-loops which can cause replication/transcription conflicts (top) or activate a
  repair pathway generating DNA breaks (below). DNA and RNA are shown in green and
  red, respectively.
