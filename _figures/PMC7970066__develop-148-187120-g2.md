caption: A plethora of ways to regulate and signal through the simple auxin signaling
  pathway. (A) At high concentrations in the nucleus, A/B, B and C ARFs (purple) outcompete
  a low concentration of A-ARFs (blue) in binding AuxREs. This replaces the auxin-dependent
  repression of A-ARF with the auxin-independent repression of B and C ARFs, where
  these ARFs recruit TPL to AuxREs and repress auxin-inducible genes. (B) ARF dimerization
  is needed for full activation, acting at least in part by leading to increased affinity
  of class A ARFs for DNA. However, even without TPL, Aux/IAAs can contribute to repression
  of class A ARFs by disrupting their dimerization. (C) A rapid, non-transcriptional
  auxin response can also occur. This takes place outside the nucleus, where AUX1
  transports auxin into the cytoplasm, triggering cytoplasmic TIR1 and likely Aux/IAAs
  to activate CNGC14 through an unknown pathway. This in turn allows calcium (Ca2+)
  into the cell, rapidly depolarizing it. (D) TMK1 is a plasma membrane-localized,
  trans-membrane receptor-like kinase. When auxin is present, the kinase domain of
  TMK1 is cleaved and phosphorylates non-canonical IAAs (ncIAAs) that lack a degron.
  This phosphorylation then strengthens repression of some auxin-induced genes. (E)
  ETTIN/ARF3 (ETT, purple) is a B-class ARF that has no PB1 domain but is able to
  directly bind TPL. Auxin perception disrupts the interaction between ETT and TPL,
  thereby activating gene expression. (F) BIN2 phosphorylates (P) A class ARFs, preventing
  Aux/IAAs from binding to them, and strengthening their bond to AuxREs. BIN2 also
  facilitates Aux/IAA degradation in an auxin-independent manner, de-repressing auxin-inducible
  genes.
