caption: Cytosolic glucose can be catabolized by glycolysis or the pentose phosphate
  pathway. Pyruvate, the end-product of glycolysis can enter the mitochondrial matrix
  where it is oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA by PDH in order to enter the
  TCA cycle. Long-chain fatty acids are converted to acyl-CoAs which traverse the
  mitochondrial membranes via the subsequent enzymatic activities of CPT1 and CPT2
  in the carnitine shuttle. Ketone bodies such as β-hydroxybutyrate enter the TCA
  cycle as acetyl-CoA. Certain amino acids can enter the TCA cycle as acetyl-CoA,
  α-ketoglutarate, or succinyl-CoA. TCA cycle intermediates and NADPH and intermediates
  from the pentose phosphate pathway promote anabolic reactions in the cell.OMM =
  outer mitochondrial membrane; IMM = inner mitochondrial membrane; LDH = lactate
  dehydrogenase; CPT = carnitine palmitoyltransferase; MPC = mitochondrial pyruvate
  carrier; PDH = pyruvate dehydrogenase; PC = pyruvate carboxylase; OAA = oxaloacetate;
  TCA = tricarboxylic acid; CoA = coenzyme A; GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid; BCAA
  = branched-chain amino acids
