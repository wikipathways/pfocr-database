caption: Macrophage-derived exosomal miR-155-5p and miR-221-5p promote EC proliferation
  to help vascular angiogenesis. EC-derived exosomal circRNA007793 inhibits miR-622
  to promote cell aging. LINC01005 promotes proliferation and migration of VSMCs by
  regulating the miR-128-3p/KLF4 axis, while ACE2 down-regulates the activated NF-kappaB
  pathway to inhibit this process. Notch3 promotes the aging of VSMCs to ease vasosclerosis
  through the mTOR signaling pathway. VSMC-derived exosomal miR-155 inhibits EC proliferation
  to prevent damage to the vascular endothelium
