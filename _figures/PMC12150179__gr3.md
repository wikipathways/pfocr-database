caption: Microplastics indirectly affect macrophages by disrupting gut microbiota.
  Microplastics disrupt gut microbiota and increase intestinal permeability, facilitating
  the entry of bacteria and their metabolites into the body. This dysbiosis leads
  to LPS activation of macrophage TLR4, inducing HIF-1α expression, which triggers
  aerobic glycolysis and promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype. Additionally,
  it activates the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to the release of inflammatory
  cytokines
