caption: (A) Receptors for IL4 and IL13 are comprised of four different subunits,
  IL4Rα (green), gamma chain (γc; purple), IL13Rα1 (red), and IL13Rα2 (yellow). IL4
  and IL13 both bind and signal through type II IL4R. Type II IL4R and IL13Rα2 are
  present on tumor cells. (B) In the presence of al signaling receptors, IL4 and IL13
  can both bind type II IL4R and phosphorylate Stat6 leading to increased proliferation
  and apoptotic resistance. JNK/MAPK and p38 pathways are also activated downstream
  of IL4, and possibly IL13 signaling through type II IL4R. IL13 can also bind soluble
  or transmembrane IL13Rα2, potentially leading to induction of TGFβ expression, downstream
  of ERK 1/2 and AP-1. * Note this pathway has thus far only been delineated in other
  cell types, but is speculated to occur in epithelial cancer cells. (C) In the absence
  of IL13Rα2, IL13 may have enhanced signaling through type II IL4R and/or signaling
  resulting in expression of 15-LOX-1.
