caption: Topical treatment with AAE alters the murine HF metabolome. Schematic cartoon
  depicting some of the metabolic reactions positively (green box) or negatively (red
  boxes) affected by AAE in murine HFs. Red and green arrowheads indicate reactions
  halted or stimulated by AAE, respectively. Red and green dots indicate metabolites
  whose intracellular concentration resulted decreased or increased by treatment with
  AAE, respectively.
