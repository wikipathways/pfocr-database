caption: COVID-19 associated sarcopenia mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infection activates
  a series of mechanisms responsible for increasing the risk of sarcopenia development.
  COVID-19 induces ACE2 downregulation and hinders the ACE2 protective effect, predisposing
  skeletal muscle to sarcopenia. The inflammatory response in response to infection,
  mainly characterized by the production of IL-1, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12, IFN-α,
  CRP, and Ferritin, prompts muscle catabolism, reducing muscle protein synthesis
  and increasing its susceptibility to damage and death. Bedrest and physical inactivity
  in the context of patients with COVID-19 not only increases several inflammatory
  biomarkers (such as TNF-α, CRP, and IL-6) but also reduces muscle quantity, strength,
  anaerobic performance, and protein synthesis. Additionally, the inactivity state
  impairs glycemic control, which also contributes to a decrease in muscle protein
  synthesis and damages neuromuscular junctions. Interstitial pneumonia secondary
  to COVID-19 commonly triggers a state of hypoxia, which accounts for (1) a decrease
  in phosphorylation of p70S6K1 and 4E-BP1, (2) a switch from the IGF-1/Akt to IGF-1/ERK
  signaling pathway, (3) an increase in myostatin levels and (4) an inhibition of
  mTOR. The decrease in phosphorylation of p70S6K1 and 4E-BP1 suppresses protein synthesis.
  The switch from the IGF-1/Akt to IGF-1/ERK signaling pathway impairs myoblast differentiation.
  Elevated levels of myostatin activate catabolism and negatively regulate muscle
  growth. Inhibition of mTOR activity hampers the regulation of cell growth and proliferation,
  which augments the risk of damage within the skeletal muscle. Hypoxia, thus, makes
  the musculoskeletal system susceptible to sarcopenia. Created with adobe.com/illustrator.
