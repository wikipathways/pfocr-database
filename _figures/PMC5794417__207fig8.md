caption: 'A schematic diagram on regulation of PCSK9 on apoB via modulating the autophagy
  pathway affecting atherogenesis. 1: In the liver, PCSK9 interacts with apoB, which
  inhibits the normal degradation of apoB via the autophagy pathway involving p62.
  The excess apoB assembles and secretes as VLDL into the circulation. 2: The regulation
  of PCSK9 on apoB on assembly and secretion as VLDL intracellularly might activate
  p-Akt, resulting in suppression of autophagy. On the other hand, this process might
  induce AMPK and p-AMPK. However, the activation of AMPK and p-AMPK also induces
  the ULK1 kinase complex and activates Beclin-1 to activate autophagy. In this condition,
  the regulatory element, Atg14L, in the Beclin-1 complex was not activated. Therefore,
  the signaling pathway through AMPK did not activate autophagy. Thus, p62 is accumulated
  in the autophagosome; not degraded, LC3-I is converted to LC3-II inefficiently.
  Much work is needed to elucidate this complex hypothesis. The role of mTOR in this
  hypothesis is not confirmed yet. 3: The VLDLs secreted from liver have different
  compositions as the result of presence of PCSK9. VLDLs are hydrolyzed to LDLs; the
  compositions of LDL generated from LDb versus LTp mice are different; LTp-LDL has
  fewer CEs and PLs. 4: LDb-LDL and LTp-LDL induce different activations on ECs and
  immune cells, leading to inflammatory reaction of macrophages (MQs) and migration/proliferation
  of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). This is the initiation of atherogenesis.'
