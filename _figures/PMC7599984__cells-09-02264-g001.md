caption: Wnt signaling pathway. Schematic representation of the Wnt signaling pathway.
  (Left side) Wnt signaling is inactive in the absence of Wnt ligand on the Frizzled
  receptor. The destruction complex thus can be formed and phosphorylated the constitutively
  cytosolic β-catenin, leading to proteasomal degradation. Groucho retains its repressor
  activity by binding the TCF/Lef transcription factors and thus target gene expression
  is restricted. (Right side) Wnt signaling is activated upon binding of Wnt ligand
  to the Frizzled receptor and recruitment of the co-receptor LPR5/6. Axin, GSK3-β
  and DVL (Dishevelled) are recruited to the membrane receptor complex, disrupting
  the destruction complex. Cytosolic β-catenin translocates to the nucleus to compete
  with Groucho for TCF/Lef transcription factor binding, leading to target gene expression.
