caption: 'Proposed model of GF-mediated regulation of IGFBP-3. A: GF deprivation results
  in a reduction of external mitogenic signals; however, basal activity of the PI3K/
  AKT/mTOR pathway permits de novo IGFBP-3 transcription and translation. mTOR may
  contribute to IGFBP-3 protein induction through a posttranscriptional mechanism.
  IGFBP-3 is secreted out and prevents exogenous IGF from stimulating the IGF receptor
  (IGFR). B: EGF potently suppresses IGFBP-3 transcription and translation through
  excessive activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway. Although EGF can activate the
  PI3K pathway (), IGF-IR may play a predominant role in its activation in primary
  and immortalized human esophageal cells. The thick arrows and lines indicate the
  predominant signaling pathways for IGFBP-3 regulation upon GF deprivation (A) or
  EGF treatment (B). Dashed arrows indicate residual signals from IGFR or EGFR during
  GF deprivation. The pharmacological inhibitors and genetic constructs used in this
  study are noted.'
