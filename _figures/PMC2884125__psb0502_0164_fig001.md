caption: Evolution of the chloroplast division machinery. The division complex of
  algae and land plants include FtsZ and ARC 6, both of which are descended from the
  cell division machinery of cyanobacteria. DR P5B was added after endosymbiosis.
  PDV2 was acquired by a common ancestor of land plants. PDV1 and PARC 6 emerged by
  gene duplication of PDV2 and ARC 6, respectively, in a common ancestor of vascular
  plants (Ferns and seed plants). The site of the FtsZ ring formation is determined
  by the MinD and MinE proteins which are descended from cyanobacteria, the ARC 3
  protein which is specific to green algae and land plants, and land-plant specific
  protein MCD1. The inset diagram shows the pathway of chloroplast division complex
  assembly in green algae and land plants.
