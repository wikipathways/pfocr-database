caption: GPR39 signaling cascade in neural pathology. GPR39 activation by ligands
  activate the Gαq and Gαs pathways. Gαq activation results in PIP2 cleaving to release
  membrane-bound DAG and cytosolic IP3, resulting in calcium release from ER to increase
  KCC2 and promote GABAergic tone, increase NHE1 activity to maintain pH, and increase
  2-AG synthesis to increase presynaptic CB1R activity. ERK1/2 activation from this
  signaling pathway has been shown to inhibit clusterin, a protein associated with
  Alzheimer’s disease. Gαs signaling increases cAMP levels and CRE-dependent transcription,
  including BDNF and TrkB, which are associated with improved memory and decreased
  depression. This pathway is inhibited through PKA by PKIB from the constitutive
  pathway of GPR39, which is coordinated through Gα12/13 and Rho kinases for SRE-dependent
  transcription, promoting anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity. The constitutive
  pathway also has negative feedback for GPR39 expression through ROCK, resulting
  in desensitization and internalization of the receptor to prevent over-excitation.
