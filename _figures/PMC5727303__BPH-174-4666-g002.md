caption: Inhibitors of Wnt signalling. (A) Following Wnt/FZD receptor binding (not
  shown), recruitment of the scaffolding protein AXIN to the receptor complex leads
  to inhibition of GSK3B and the β‐catenin destruction complex, which allows newly
  synthesized β‐catenin to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus (orange arrows),
  where it binds with co‐factors to form a transcriptionally active complex. Indicated
  are some of the inhibitors that target various intracellular nodes of Wnt signal
  transduction that could have therapeutic benefit for gastric cancer patients with
  APC, AXIN or CTNNB1 mutations. (B) Wnt signalling (WNT) can be inhibited at the
  cell surface by various pathway inhibitors such as sFRPs and DKK, which bind to
  Wnt and LRP5/6 respectively. Other approaches target Wnt signalling using small
  molecules that inhibit porcupine (PORCN), which prevent the secretion of Wnt from
  the endoplasmic reticulum (yellow arrow). In addition, FZD receptor‐blocking antibodies
  (vantictumab) and decoy FZD receptors (ipafricept) inhibit Wnt signalling by blocking
  FZD receptors and sequestering Wnts respectively. Gastric cancer patients with RNF43
  mutations or overexpression of Wnt and/or FZD receptors would probably benefit from
  these types of Wnt inhibitors.
