caption: Steroid biosynthetic pathway elucidating peripheral and local tissue estrogen
  biosynthesis. Cholesterol is the substrate for all steroid hormones. The StAR protein
  predominantly regulates steroid biosynthesis by controlling the transport of cholesterol
  from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. At the inner mitochondria, the
  first steroid, pregnenolone, is formed by the action of the cytochrome P450scc enzyme.
  Pregnenolone exits the mitochondria and it is then converted to various steroid
  hormones by tissue-specific enzymes. Aromatase is the rate-liming enzyme in the
  biosynthesis estrogens from androgens. The rectangle illustrates estrogen biosynthesis
  in peripheral and local tumor tissue. Androgens synthesized in the adrenal gland
  and ovaries (pre-menopausal) are converted to estrogens through the action of the
  aromatase enzyme. The 17β-HSD enzyme converts estrone to 17β-estradiol (E2).
