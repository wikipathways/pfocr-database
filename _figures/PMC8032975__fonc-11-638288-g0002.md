caption: Schematic representation of lipoproteins and their three different metabolic
  pathways. The schematic representation of the chylomicron pathway (in the upper-left
  purple frame) indicates their biosynthesis from the intestine and their clearance
  by the members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. The schematic representation
  of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)/intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL)/LDL
  pathway (in the upper-right lighter purple frame) indicates the VLDL synthesis by
  the liver and finally the clearance of LDL by the LDL receptors. The schematic representation
  of the HDL pathway (in the lower-right blue frame) indicates the steps for the discoidal
  synthesis of high density lipoprotein (HDL), the mature spherical HDL, and finally
  their removal from the circulation by interacting with SR-BI receptor. Additional
  steps are also shown (dashed arrows) in which HDL exchanges lipids with chylomicrons,
  chylomicron remnants, and VLDL.
