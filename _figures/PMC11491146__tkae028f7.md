caption: Molecular mechanisms by which CCN2 regulates the activity of TRPV4 channels
  under mechanical stimulation in fibrochondrocytes. Mechanical stimulation promotes
  TRPV4 protein expression and channel activation in fibrochondrocytes, and the presence
  of CCN2 can maintain the TRPV4 channel activation state and promote fibrochondrocyte
  proliferation through the downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. CCN2 cellular communication
  network factor 2, TRPV4 transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V
