caption: CR suppresses the immune system and preferentially activates epithelial cell
  DEG networks and discriminates the networks interconnection. IPA DB and network
  graphical tools were used to construct the immune system and epithelial cell-specific
  subsets DEGs and their encoded protein-protein interactions. 174 edges (protein
  interactions) were found among high significantly connected immune network interactions
  with several super hubs (e.g., Stat1 with 36 edges and Tlr4 with 19 edges). CR reduces
  the expression of a vast majority of the immune genes. CR modulates the expression
  of epithelium cells, activating metabolic genes, which had 58 edges within epithelial-specific
  proteins (e.g., Ppara pathway directly connected with 26 edges). A total of 34 edges
  were from immune to epithelium interactions (with a hub of Stat1, 7 edges), and
  45 edges were from epithelium to immune interactions (with hub Ppara, 16 edges,
  mostly linked with the upregulated immune system proteins). The blue color node
  indicates downregulated proteins and the orange color node indicates upregulated
  proteins. Color intensity is based on the gene expression fold changes. Bold lines
  indicate a direct relationship. Dotted lines indicate an indirect relationship.

  description: CR suppresses the immune system and preferentially activates epithelial
    cell DEG networks and discriminates the networks interconnection. IPA DB and network
    graphical tools were used to construct the immune system and epithelial cell-specific

    with several super hubs (e.g., Stat1 with 36 edges and Tlr4 with 19 edges). CR
    reduces the expression of a vast majority of the immune genes. CR modulates the
