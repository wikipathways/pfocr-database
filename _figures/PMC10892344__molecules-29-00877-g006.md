caption: Schematic diagram generated by IPA of the death receptor signaling pathway
  with which the DEPs with |FC| ≥ 1.3 identified in A549 cells exposed to 1.0 μM of
  SPTD are highly associated with. The red color represents a protein (or complex)
  that is upregulated, green represents downregulation and the fold-change value is
  noted below the gene name
