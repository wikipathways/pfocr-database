caption: Synthesis pathways are in blue. Proteolytic pathways are in red. The dotted
  lines represent pathways that are not well characterized. Anabolic signals activate
  the PI-3 Kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway resulting in protein synthesis. Inactivity and
  inflammatory cytokines result in activation of NF-κB and Fox-O mediated induction
  of genes resulting in muscle atrophy. Fox-O activates transcription of ubiquitin
  proteasome ligases resulting in protein degradation. PI3-Kinase/AKT phosphorylates
  Fox-O preventing its nuclear translocation and inhibiting its activity. Fox-O when
  active can inhibit the mTOR pathway. Also, mTOR pathway activation inhibits protein
  degradation by lysosomal caspases. Myostatin causes muscle atrophy, via activating
  Fox-O and inhibiting PI3-K.IGF-1= insulin like growth factor 1, BCAA= branched chain
  amino acids, PI3-K= phosphoinositol 3 kinase, mTOR= mammalian target of rapamycin,
  NF-κB= nuclear transcription factor kappa B. Fox-O= transcription factor forkhead
