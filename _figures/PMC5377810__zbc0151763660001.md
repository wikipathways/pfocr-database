caption: Summary of key steps of lipoglycan biosynthesis in C. glutamicum. A, the
  LM-A/LAM pathway. The early PIM intermediate AcPIM2 is assembled on the cytoplasmic
  leaflet of the cell membrane by GDP-Man-dependent mannosyltransferases PimA/PimB
  and acyltransferase PatA before being transported across the membrane for further
  elongation by polyprenol-phosphate-mannose-dependent mannosyltransferases (LpqW-activated
  MptB and MptA that form the main mannan chain; MptC and MptD that add mannose side
  chains) to form Cg-LM-A. Cg-LM-A is further modified by glycosyltransferases to
  form Cg-LAM. In mycobacteria, additional enzymes (e.g. EmbC, AftC, AftD, and CapA)
  are involved in the formation of a significantly larger and more complex arabinan
  structure. B, LM-B pathway. In C. glutamicum, a second family of lipomannans, termed
  Cg-LM-B, are assembled on a structurally distinct glycolipid anchor that contains
  the core structure Gl-A. Gl-A is extended with a single mannose residue by the cytoplasmic
  enzyme, MgtA, forming Gl-X, which is thought to be flipped and then elongated by
  MptA/B/C/D to form the end product, Cg-LM-B. This abundant species forms the bulk
  of LM in C. glutamicum. Whether this pathway exists in mycobacteria is unknown.
