caption: 'Mechanisms connecting PTEN with longevity. The major functions of PTEN can
  be seen here: Through down-regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (and thus S6K), there
  is a reduction in cellular transformation, insulin signaling and BAT activation
  resulting in cancer protection, metabolic protection and reduced telomere shortening.
  By up-regulating p53, DNA damage is reduced as well as telomere shortening. The
  result of these is an increased longevity.'
