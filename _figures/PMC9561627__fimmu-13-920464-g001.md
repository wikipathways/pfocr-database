caption: 'Pyroptosis is mediated by several pathways: (A) In the classical pyroptosis
  signaling pathway, NLRP3 is activated under the stimulation of PAMPs/DAMPs as well
  as cytoplasmic disturbances, termed as homeostasis altering molecular properties
  (HAMPs), then the PYD at the NLRP3 N-terminal binds to the ASC protein containing
  the PYD domain, and the CARD of ASC binds to the CARD of pro-caspase-1 to form a
  multi-protein complex and activate Caspase-1. Activated Caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD
  and divides GSDMD protein into lipophilic N-terminal domain and hydrophilic C-terminal
  domain, the N-terminal domain binds to the lipids on the cell membrane to form pores,
  causing the release of cell contents. On the other hand, the N-terminal produced
  by cleavage from GSDMD has another function for promoting the proteolytic activation
  of caspase-1, helps to form active IL-1β and IL-18. At the same time, cells release
  IL-1β and IL-18 released to the outside of the cell during pyroptosis recruit more
  inflammatory cells and expand the inflammatory response. (B) In the non-classicial
  pyroptosis signaling pathway, Caspase-4, 5, and 11 are activated under the stimulation
  of bacteria and other signals. The GSDMD is cleaved by the activated Caspase-4,
  5, and 11 to form the lipophilic N-terminal domain, inducing cell membrane perforation
  and causing inflammation. (C) In Caspase-8-dependent pyroptosis signaling pathway,
  Caspase-8 is activated by Yersinia via the TLR4/RIP1 signaling pathway to induce
  pyroptosis. (D) In Caspase-3-dependent pyroptosis signaling pathway, Caspase-3 promotes
  the recruitment of the GSDME-N domain to the cell membrane by cutting off GSDME
  and induces the formation of cell pores, thus leading to pyroptosis.'
