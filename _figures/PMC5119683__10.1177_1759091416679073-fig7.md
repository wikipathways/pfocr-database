caption: 'Diagram depicting kinase pathways activated by gp120. The use of pharmacological
  inhibitors in axonal transport studies here delineated novel signaling pathways
  by which gp120 impairs FAT. Gp120 was found to activate, directly or indirectly
  (dotted line) the MAP3K Tak1. Tak1 in turn activates at least two independent signaling
  pathways. In one pathway, Tak1 activates the IKK complex through a mechanism that
  requires PP1 activity and leads to activation of IKK-2. How IKK-2 inhibits FAT is
  currently unknown and depicted by the dotted line. In the second pathway, Tak1 activates
  canonical MAP2Ks which in turn, promote activation of both p38 MAPK and JNK. Both
  p38 MAPK and JNK are known to phosphorylate kinesin to inhibit FAT. (5 Z)-7-Oxozeaenol:
  Tak-1 inhibitor. DVD peptide blocks conserved docking domains to inhibit certain
  MAP3K''s. Okadaic acid inhibits serine or threonine phosphatases. I-2: specific
  inhibitor of the serine or threonine phosphatase PP1. Inhibitor XII: a specific
  inhibitor of IKK-2. MW069A: a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK. SP600125: a specific
  inhibitor of JNK. SB203580: an inhibitor of p38 MAPK and JNK3.'
