caption: 'Functional neuroanatomy and molecular mechanisms of regulating immune responses.
  (a) Sympathetic preganglionic fibers originating in the spinal cord terminate into
  paravertebral (not shown) and perivertebral ganglia releasing acetylcholine (ACh;
  not shown). Postganglionic catecholaminergic fibers innervate visceral organs and
  release norepinephrine (NE). Efferent sympathetic output to the adrenal medulla
  induces the secretion of epinephrine (EP) from chromaffin cells. The dorsal motor
  nucleus of the vagus (DMN) and nucleus ambiguus (not shown) in the brainstem medulla
  oblongata are major sources of efferent vagus nerve fibers. Cholinergic preganglionic
  vagus efferent fibers innervate visceral organs, where they interact with postganglionic
  fibers that release acetylcholine as a principal neurotransmitter. Preganglionic
  efferent vagus fibers also terminate in the celiac ganglia and the superior mesenteric
  ganglion, where the splenic nerve originates. The splenic nerve releases norepinephrine,
  which in turn activates the release of acetylcholine from the choline acetyl transferase
  (ChAT)-positive CD4+ T cells. (b) Acetylcholine and NE regulate cytokine release
  by immune cells activated in response to tissue injury or pathogen invasion. Acetylcholine
  binds to the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) expressed on macrophages
  and other immune cells. This interaction activates intracellular signaling, involving
  suppression of NF-κB activity and activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, which results
  in suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production. In addition, acetylcholine
  binds to the α7nAChR expressed on mitochondria and suppresses mitochondrial DNA
  release, which in turn inhibits inflammasome activation. Norepinephrine and epinephrine
  bind to the β2-adrenergic receptors on macrophages and other immune cells and induce
  intracellular signaling, involving cyclic AMP and protein kinase A (PKA), which
  results in suppression of NF-κB activity and proinflammatory cytokine release. Some
  components of this figure are adapted from . Other abbreviations: cAMP, cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate; DMN, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus; mt, mitochondrial; PRR, pattern
  recognition receptor.'
