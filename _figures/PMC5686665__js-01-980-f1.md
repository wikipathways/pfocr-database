caption: 'Lipogenesis, sphingolipid, and PA synthesis pathways. Glucose is the main
  intracellular substrate for the generation of fatty acids (FA). In the livers of
  Agpat2−/− mice, there is an increase of de novo lipogenesis []. Shown are some of
  the key steps involved in the conversion of glucose to FAs (reviewed in []). The
  fate of FAs most likely depends on their intracellular concentrations and could
  enter different pathway(s), including glycerophospholipid synthesis or the sphingolipid
  synthesis pathway. In sphingolipid synthesis, first palmitoyl Co-A condenses with
  the amino acid serine to generate 3-ketosphingosine, which is then reduced to form
  sphinganine. In the next two sequential steps, ceramide synthase converts sphinganine
  to dihydroceramide, followed by its conversion by desaturase to ceramide. Further
  modifications of ceramide are also depicted. In glycerophospholipid synthesis, glycerol-3-phosphate
  is acylated to produce LPA and an additional acylation to generate PA. The enzymes
  of these pathway are as follows: Sptlc, serine palmitoyltransferase; Kdsr, 3-ketosphingosine
  reductase; Sphk, sphingosine kinase (note Sphk has much broader substrate specificity
  phosphorylating both sphinganine and sphingosine); CerS, ceramide synthase; Degs,
  dihydroceramide desaturase; Sgms, sphingomyelin synthase; Cerk, ceramide kinase;
  Ugcg, UDP-glucose ceramide hexosyltransferase or hexosylceramide synthase; B4galt,
  UDP-Gal:betaGlcNAc β1,4-galactosyltransferase or lactosylceramide synthase. Most
  of the enzymes for this pathway have multiple isoforms; for example, CerS has six
  known isoforms. Key enzymes for de novo lipogenesis: Gkrp, glucokinase regulatory
  protein; Acyl, ATP citrate lyase; Fasn, fatty acid synthase; Acs, Acyl-coenzyme
  A synthetase; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle. Key enzymes for glycerophospholipid
  synthesis: Gpat, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; Agpat, 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate
  O-acyltransferase. Those metabolites shown in orange and those enzymes shown in
  blue were measured in this study.'
