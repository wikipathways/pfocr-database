caption: Example of biosynthetic pathway for production of (A) 3′-SL, 6′-SL, and (B)
  2′-FL.HMOs are produced enzymatically inside the cell from externally added glucose
  and lactose. Nucleotide sugars such as CMP-Neu5Ac in (A) or GDP-Fuc in (B) are biosynthesized
  internally from glucose and glycosyltransferases transfer the sugar moiety of the
  nucleotide sugar to lactose. Produced 3′-SL, 6′-SL in (A), and 2′-FL in (B) are
  excreted from the cell to the fermentation medium through specific sugar transporters
