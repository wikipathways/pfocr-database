caption: Factors driving age-related IFN response. Cells undergo multiple molecular
  changes in the nuclei (green) and mitochondria (pink) during aging. Cytosolic sensing
  of TE, ssDNA, or mitochondrial DNA by cGAS activates STING and initiates innate
  interferon response in aging cells. Interferon signaling via JAK/STAT pathway exerts
  a profound influence on cellular functions, and its activation constitutes a core
  program of tissue, organ, and stem cell aging, which likely contributes to the systemic
  aging process.
