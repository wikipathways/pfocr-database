caption: Overview of DNA double-strand break repair mechanisms and PARP inhibitor
  function. When DNA single-strand break (SSB) occurs, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
  (PARP) recruitment and activation leads to SSB repair through NAD+poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation
  (PARylation) of histones and chromatin remodeling enzymes and recruitment of PARP-dependent
  DNA-repair proteins (A). In the presence of PARP inhibitor (PARPi), PARP recruited
  to DNA SSB is no longer able to activate PARP-dependent repair systems and to dissociate
  from DNA-determining fork replication collapse during DNA replication (B). The collapsed
  replication fork creates a DNA double-strand break (DSB) that, in homologous recombination
  (HR)-proficient cells, is mainly repaired by the error-free mechanism of HR. MRN
  complex (Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1) initiates DNA end resection, leading to the formation
  of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) at the extremity of the DSB; ssDNA is protected from
  degradation by the loading of replication protein A (RPA). The MRN complex recruits
  and activates ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM); ATM and RPA contribute to ataxia
  telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) activation. Once activated, ATM and ATR phosphorylate
  several proteins involved in the HR pathway, such as checkpoint kinases 1 and 2
  (CHEK1/2). Besides, ATM, ATR, and CHEK1/2 regulate cell cycle arrest after the DSB.
  Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (FANCD2) contributes to breast cancer 1
  (BRCA1) activation once monoubiquitinated by Fanconi anemia complementation (FANC)
  and phosphorylated by ATM. The complex BRCA1- BRCA1-associated RING domain 1 (BARD1)
  facilitates DNA end resection and interacts with the bridging protein partner and
  localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) phosphorylated by CHEK2. PALB2 promotes the recruitment
  of breast cancer 2 (BRCA2). PALB2 and BRCA2 remove RPA and facilitate the assembly
  of the RAD51 recombinase nucleoprotein filament. RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, Shu
  complex (which consists of four proteins, Shu1, Shu2, Csm2, and Psy3), and RAD51
  paralogs mediate the D-loop formation and strand invasion of ssDNA into the intact
  sister chromatid, searching a homologous template for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase
  (DNA pol). The repaired DNA is resolved by synthesis-dependent strand annealing
  (C). In HR-deficient cells, DSB is mainly repaired by the more error-prone template-independent
  mechanism of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). DNA ends are recognized by the Ku70/80
  heterodimer, which recruits DNA-dependent protein kinases (DNA-PKs). The X-ray repair
  cross complementing 4 (XRCC4)-DNA Ligase IV-XRCC4-like factor (XLF) ligation complex
  seals the break. However, DNA ends can degrade, leading to incorrect DSB repair
  (D).
