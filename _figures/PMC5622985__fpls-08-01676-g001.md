caption: A diagram of ethylene signal transduction pathway in rice. In the dark, rice
  etiolated seedlings have “double response” with ethylene treatment. Ethylene promotes
  coleoptile elongation but inhibits root growth in rice. A linear ethylene signaling
  pathway has been found in rice etiolated seedlings which is similar to that in Arabidopsis.
  Rice has homologs of Arabidopsis ethylene signaling pathway, such as ethylene receptors,
  OsCTRs, MHZ7/OsEIN2, and MHZ6/OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. In contrast to that in Arabidopsis,
  the AtEIN3/EIL1 homologs OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 have divergent functions in rice coleoptile
  and root growth. (A) Ethylene promotes coleoptile/mesocotyl elongation through OsEIL2
  which inhibits GY1/EG1-mediated jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis. JA pathway acts downstream
  of ethylene signaling pathway to inhibit cell elongation. On the other hand, MHZ5/CRTISO
  and MHZ4/ABA4-mediated ABA pathway acts upstream of ethylene signaling pathway to
  inhibit transcription of MHZ7/OsEIN2 and inhibit coleoptile elongation. (B) Ethylene
  regulates root growth through MHZ6/OsEIL1 function. In Arabidopsis, AtEIN3 and AtEIL1
  have functional redundancy in root inhibition. Moreover, ethylene inhibits root
  growth partially through MHZ5/CRTISO and MHZ4/ABA4-mediated ABA pathway. Arrows
  and T-bars indicate direct or indirect activation and inhibition, respectively.
  Dotted lines indicate several steps involved that are not shown in the diagram.
