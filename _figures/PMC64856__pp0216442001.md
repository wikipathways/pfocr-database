caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathway to phenylpropenes in  basil. Enzymes are as
  follows: C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; C3H,  p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; CC3H, p-coumaroyl-CoA  3-hydroxylase;
  CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; and CAD, cinnamyl alcohol  dehydrogenase. Dotted lines
  indicate hypothetical reactions;  hypothetical intermediates are boxed. The phenylpropanoid
  pathway  involving methylations of the CoA esters (as opposed to the free acids)  is
  shown in brackets.'
