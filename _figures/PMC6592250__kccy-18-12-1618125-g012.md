caption: Role of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in cellular defense and DNA synthesis.
  (a) In the oxidative branch of the PPP (ox-PPP), glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) is converted
  in three consecutive reactions into ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P), simultaneously
  yielding two NADPH molecules. (b) Linkage of glutathione (GSH) cycle to NADPH producing
  PPP provides cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress by glutathione
  reductase (GR) and -peroxidase dependent (GPx) detoxification of lipid peroxides
  (ROOHs) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). (c) In the non-oxidative branch of the PPP
  (non-ox-PPP), the isomerizing system interconverts Ru5P to xylulose-5-phosphate
  (X5P) and R5P. In the sugar rearrangement system transketolase (TK) which transfers
  two carbon units and transaldolase (TA), which transfers three carbon units, convert
  X5P and R5P into the glycolytic intermediates fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (GAP). (d) The generated NADPH molecules are also required for and consumed during
  nucleotides biosynthesis. NADPH links PPP with the electron transmitting systems
  namely, GSH-glutaredoxin(Grx) and thioredoxin (Trx). The oxidation of NADPH channels
  its hydride ion (H −) to these hydrogen carrier systems which serve as electron
  (H −) donors. R5P conversion to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), as well as
  purine serve as the backbone for ribonucleotides synthesis. Reduction of ribonucleotide
  diphosphate (rNDP) to deoxynucleotide diphosphate (dNDP) and its phosphorylation
  by nucleotide diphosphate kinase (NDK) is an absolute prerequisite for DNA synthesis.
