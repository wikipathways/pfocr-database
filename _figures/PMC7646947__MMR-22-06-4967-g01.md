caption: Cell autophagy/lysosomal and Ca2+-dependent protein degradation pathways,
  ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are involved in muscle protein degradation
  in cancer cachexia. In cancer cachexia, increased activin A expression activates
  the IL-6 signaling pathway, and oxidative stress induces activation of the p38 MAPK
  signaling pathway, resulting in autophagy and protein degradation. The overexpression
  of Ca2+-dependent proteases (calpains) activates the Ca2+-dependent proteolysis
  system, resulting in increased protein degradation. In addition, the ER manages
  such stress by initiating the UPR, which is controlled by three transmembrane proteins,
  namely, PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. Optimal activation of NF-κB during ER stress requires
  inputs from both IRE1 and PERK activities, and ATF6 may interact with protein degradation
  pathways, such as the UPS. Moreover, local mitochondrial degeneration in the muscle
  activates the UPS, which results in protein degradation. R, receptor; PERK, protein
  kinase-like ER eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; IRE1, inositol-requiring protein; ATF6,
  activating transcription factor 6; UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome system.
