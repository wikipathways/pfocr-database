caption: ETBF induces tumor growth by downregulating miR-155-5p, miR-200a-3p, and
  miR-149-3p. BFAL1 was upregulated in ETBF-infected CRC cells and subsequently decreased
  the levels of miR-155-5p and miR-200a-3p, which attenuated their suppressive function
  on target RHEB mRNA expression. The downregulated RHEB consequently activates the
  RHEB/mTOR pathway, thereby mediating ETBF-induced tumor growth. miR-149-3p is also
  significantly downregulated in ETBF-infected CRC cells. Regulation of miR-149-3p
  was attributed to METTL14-dependent m6A modification via modifying pri-miRNA splicing.
  In ETBF-infected CRC cells, METTL14 was downregulated so that the level of miR-149-3p
  was reduced, which further upregulated target PHF5A. The overexpression of PHF5A
  upregulated the target mRNA level of KAT2A in CRC cells, which can upregulate SOD2
  via directly binding to the promoter region of SOD2. More importantly, the overexpression
  of SOD2 is relevant to poor clinical outcomes in gastric cancer, and SOD2 may promote
  intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis.
