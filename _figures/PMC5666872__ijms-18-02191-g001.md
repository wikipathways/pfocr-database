caption: Schematic representation of heat-responsive proteins involved in signal transduction
  pathway. Heat stress results in an inward flux of calcium and activation of G protein
  by phospholipase C (PLC), annexins and other proteins. Calcium binds the calmodulin
  (CaM) and calcium-binding protein (CaB), and then activates multiple kinases (e.g.,
  CDPK and MAPK) and transcriptional regulators (e.g., MYB, WRKY and HSF). HSP70 and
  HSP90 negatively regulate the activity of HSFA1. BRI1-KD and annexin participate
  in the heat signal transduction through MAPK-activated stress response. Red and
  green triangles represent heat-increased and heat-decreased abundance of proteins,
  respectively. White triangle represents heat-increased phosphorylation level. Partly
  adopted from Mittler et al. [].
