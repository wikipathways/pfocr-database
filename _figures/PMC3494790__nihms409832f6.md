caption: A) Model of the proposed function of dnlg1 in the regulation of synaptic
  growth and activity in the neuromuscular junction based on the analysis of loss
  of function and gain of function mutants. Overexpression of dnlg1 causes increased
  growth of the synapse (indicated by arrow), and attenuation of neurotransmitter
  release (indicated by bar) via retrograde signaling that requires dnrx1 function.
  Dnlg1 overexpression attenuates GluR function and the response to spontaneous release
  in muscle (indicated by bar), through a pathway that is independent of dnrx1 function.
  Loss of dnlg1 function had the opposite effect on synapse size, but did not facilitate
  synaptic transmission. B. Regulation of dnlg1 expression by signaling pathways in
  motor neurons and muscle. Presynaptic signals that increase synaptic growth reduce
  DNlg1 levels (indicated by bar) and implicate activity, ubiquitin dependent proteolysis
  and PI3K signaling in the regulation of dnlg1 expression. At present, it is unclear
  whether dnlg1 down-regulation is required for synaptic growth, or is part of a more
  complex homeostatic pathway. Postsynaptic PI3K signaling modulates synaptic growth
  and function and is also implicated in dnlg1 regulation. In this model, multiple
  signaling pathways converge on dnlg1 to contribute to the regulation of synaptic
  growth and function through non-cell autonomous and cell autonomous mechanisms.
