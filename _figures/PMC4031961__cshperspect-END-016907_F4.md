caption: Model of TFEB regulation and function during starvation. This model illustrates
  how TFEB mediates the starvation response by regulating lipid catabolism. In the
  presence of sufficient nutrients, TFEB interacts with the LYNUS machinery, which
  senses lysosomal nutrient levels via the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, and
  is phosphorylated by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosomal
  surface (1). This keeps TFEB inactive by cytosolic sequestration. During starvation,
  mTORC1 is released from the LYNUS machinery and becomes inactive. Thus, TFEB can
  no longer be phosphorylated by mTORC1 and translocates to the nucleus, where it
  induces its own transcription (2). Therefore, starvation regulates TFEB activity
  through a dual mechanism that involves a posttranslational modification (that is,
  phosphorylation) and a transcriptional autoregulatory loop. Once in the nucleus,
  TFEB regulates the expression of genes involved in the lysosomal–autophagy pathway
  (3), as well as of Ppar-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α) and Pgc-1α
  (PPAR-γ coactivator 1α) and their target genes (4). In this way, TFEB controls the
  starvation response by activating both lipophagy (5) and fatty acid β-oxidation
  (6). (Figure is based on data from ,.)
