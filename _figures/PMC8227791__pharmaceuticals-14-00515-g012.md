caption: Proposed neuro-vasoprotective effects of the KED and EDR peptides in Alzheimer’s
  disease. Vascular factors (hypertension and diabetes) and/or genetic risk factors
  for AD, such as the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E, can all lead to a neurovascular
  dysfunction in cerebral vessels. It leads to a blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction
  and accumulation of blood-derived neurotoxic molecules in the brain, causing neuroinflammation.
  Additionally, within the amyloidogenic Aβ pathway, BBB dysfunction can disrupt Aβ
  clearance across the BBB and promote Aβ accumulation in the brain. These two ways
  can independently and/or synergistically lead to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction,
  neurodegeneration, cognitive impairments, which ultimately lead to dementia [].
  The EDR peptide improves neuronal differentiation, dendritic spine density and increases
  the number of mushroom spines, which are decreased in AD. The KED peptide provides
  decreased endothelial and neuronal cell apoptosis and increased endothelial cell
  proliferation, neuronal differentiation, dendritic spine density, and the number
  of mushroom spines in AD.
