caption: 'Proposed scheme for oxidative damage induced by chemical hypoxia, cell response,
  and effect of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate on D-type GABAergic motor neurons in
  Caenorhabditis elegans.Due to low levels of oxygen, during chemical hypoxia, mitochondrial
  superoxide anion (O2–) is raised on account of an inefficient transfer of electrons
  to molecular oxygen in the final step of the electron transport chain. O2– is catalyzed
  to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by enzymes manganese or copper/zinc SOD. H2O2 molecules
  diffuse throughout mitochondrial and cell membranes, causing oxidative injury. However,
  through the oxidation of Fe2+, H2O2 favors HIF-1 stabilization and so, promoting
  cell integrity and viability. Furthermore, H2O2 could allow the DAF-16 translocation,
  activating the transcription of antioxidant proteins (SOD, CAT, HSP, etc.) and consequently
  improve oxidative stress resistance and survival by inhibiting the DAF-2 receptor
  extracellularly and insulin-like signaling pathway inside of the cell. Still, in
  H2O2accumulation, the noxious effects will prevail over good ones. In such a situation,
  DHEAS exerts antioxidant effects, mostly as a scavenger of external H2O2, reducing
  the oxidative injuries and response induced by DAF-16. Colored arrows depict inward
  and outward cell motion of transcription factors (blue) and H2O2 (red). Arrows indicate
  activations, blunt-ended lines, inhibitions, or in case of hypoxia, a decline in
  O2availability. CAT: Catalase; DHEAS: dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate; HSP: heat
  shock proteins; SOD: superoxide dismutase.'
