caption: 'Putative metabolic pathway based on serum metabolic profiling results. Baseline
  serum metabolic profiles differ between normal participants and AIP patients, including
  amino acids, sphingomyelins, glycerophospholipids, and markers for urea cycle, TCA
  cycle, glycine, and creatinine synthesis. In AIP patients, the levels of branched-chain
  amino acids (BCAA: Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine), and aromatic amino acids (AAA:
  Tryptophan, Tyrosine), were significantly lower (indicated by light blue arrows);
  levels of the sphingomyelin (SM) (C16:0, C24:0, C24:1), phosphatidylcholine diacyl
  (C32:1, C36:1, C36:3), and LysoPC in the one-carbon metabolism pathway were higher
  (indicated by red arrows). Alterations in glycine synthesis, creatinine metabolism,
  and urea cycle were evident from the elevated levels of serine, sarcosine, glycine,
  urea, citrulline, ornithine, and aspartate in AIP patients (indicated by red arrows).
  Blue horizontal bar indicates no difference. Unlabeled metabolites were not quantified
  in this study.'
