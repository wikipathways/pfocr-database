caption: Model of the EGR-1/GGPPS/Erk1/2 pathway in the promotion of the inflammatory
  response during cigarette smoke exposure. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure
  leads to early growth response 1 (EGR-1) elevation by activating the Erk1/2 MAPK
  pathway. The up-regulated EGR-1 can activate transcription of its target gene geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate synthase (GGPPS), which is responsible for the reactivation of the Erk1/2
  MAPK pathway. This positive feedback pathway can constantly activate Erk1/2, which
  is crucial for the inflammatory response.
