caption: Schematic representation of the main alterations in cholesterol metabolism
  pathway in tumors. Cancer cells are highly proliferative and therefore strongly
  dependent on cholesterol to sustain the high demand of substrates for membrane biosynthesis.
  Cancer cells increase their cholesterol demand by enhancing de novo biosynthesis
  (or exogenous uptake). Increased/overexpressed enzymes in cholesterol biosynthesis
  pathway are indicated with (↑). HMGCR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase;
  SQS, Squalene synthase; SQLE, Squalene epoxidase; ACAT1, Acetyl-CoA Acetyltransferase
