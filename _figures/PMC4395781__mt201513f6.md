caption: Representation of the proposed mechanism of action for CM-hfMSCs on insulin-like
  growth factor (IGF)-expressing cells. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) express high
  levels of IGF-2. IGFBPs present in CM-hfMSCs sequester IGF-expressed by HCC cells,
  thereby preventing IGF from binding to its receptor IGF-1R. Lack of ligand stimulation
  led to decreased phosphorylation of IGF-1R and downregulation of PI3K/Akt pathway.
  One of the downstream targets of Akt signaling, NF-κB signaling, was also downregulated.
  Reduced activation of Akt also led to increased accumulation of the cdk p27Kip1,
  resulting in cell cycle arrest.
