caption: Metabolic pathways of age-related metabolites in the rhizosphere of alfalfa.
  (A) Enrichment of important metabolic pathways. 2R and 2C are rhizosphere and bulk
  soils from the 2-year-old stand, respectively; 6R and 6C are rhizosphere and bulk
  soils from the 6-year-old stand, respectively. Each bubble represents a metabolic
  pathway, with its size and color representing pathway enrichment and impact values,
  respectively. Log10(P) values are obtained by pathway enrichment analysis, and pathway
  impact values are obtained by pathway topological analysis. (B) Major metabolic
  pathways in 6R soils. Age-related metabolites are marked in red color (↑ upregulation
  and ↓ downregulation)
