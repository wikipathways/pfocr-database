caption: 'RLIP76 depletion leads to predominant inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway as
  revealed by the inhibition of PI3K as well as decrease in the levels and phosphorylation
  of Akt. The associated downstream proteins that regulate differentiation, proliferation
  and apoptosis like E-cadherin, Bim, Bcl2 and CDK4 are also differentially regulated
  due to RLIP76 targeted interventions. The collective impact of RLIP76 depletion
  on the regulation of cellular signaling pathways as well as detoxification of glutathione-conjugates
  (GS-Es) of lipid peroxidation and chemotherapy drugs represents precious opportunities
  for the development of novel and effective therapeutic interventions for pancreatic
  cancers. Green arrow: Up regulation following RLIP76 depletion; Red arrow: down
  regulation following RLIP76 depletion; Blue arrow: Normal signal transduction.'
