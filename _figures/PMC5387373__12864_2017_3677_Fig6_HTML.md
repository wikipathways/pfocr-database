caption: Differential expressed genes predicted to be involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis
  pathway. Red block means the up-regulated genes and blue block means the down-regulated
  genes in purple-leafed variety (‘P’) compared with green-leafed variety (‘G’) of
  Pak Choi
papertitle: Transcriptomic profiling of two Pak Choi varieties with contrasting anthocyanin
  contents provides an insight into structural and regulatory genes in anthocyanin
  biosynthetic pathway.
