caption: Mechanistic model to show how MEQ inhibits triple-negative breast cancer
  (TNBC) angiogenesis by regulating the MTA2/SerRS/VEGFA axis. The MTA2-containing
  NuRD deacetylase complex binds to the SerRS promoter to suppress its transcription,
  which allows more SerRS competitor, i.e., c-Myc proteins, to bind to the VEGFA promoter
  and activate VEGFA expression and tumor angiogenesis. MEQ interacts with MTA2 and
  may cause the release of the NuRD complex from the SerRS promoter, resulting in
  elevated expression of SerRS, which competes off the c-Myc and binds to the VEGFA
  promoter to suppress its transcription and inhibit tumor angiogenesis.
