caption: Model of HIF-2α regulation via DDX28. (A) DDX28 binds to and sequesters a
  pool of HIF-2α, suppressing HIF-2α’s ability to activate eIF4E2 5′ cap binding to
  transcripts harboring RNA hypoxia response elements (rHREs) in their 3′ UTRs, such
  as the HIF-2α mRNA itself. The remaining free cytoplasmic pool of HIF-2α, along
  with the binding of known interactors (eIF4G3, eIF4A, and RBM4), activates eIF4E2-dependent
  translation. (B) Very low levels of DDX28 as observed in many cancers or RNAi-mediated
  silencing in hypoxia frees up more HIF-2α to hyperactivate eIF4E2-directed translation
  above the levels observed in hypoxia. We propose that DDX28 may be a hypoxic tumor
  suppressor that restrains the HIF-2α/eIF4E2 oncogenic pathway.
