caption: Currently-known relationships among genes analyzed based on manually curated
  examination of the published literature within the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® Knowledge
  Base. Upregulated (black background) and downregulated (white background) genes
  at d 21 relative to the start of 1X d milking (d 1) are shown for comparison. Gray
  background denotes that expression was not different between the time points.
