caption: Cell Adhesion Status Influences Cellular Energetic State and 99mTC-Pertechnetate
  UptakeSchematic illustrating the relationship between energetics and 99mTc-pertechnetate
  uptake in adherent and suspended cells. Glycolysis is the main ATP-generating metabolic
  pathway in proliferating cells. Cell dissociation/suspension leads to reduced surface
  expression of GLUT1, reduced glucose uptake and glycolytic flux with consequent
  reduction in cellular ATP levels. NIS expression permits cellular transport of 99mTc-pertechnectate,
  which is coupled to Na+-K+-ATPase activity, and modulated by cellular ATP levels.
  Suspended cells have down-regulation of glycolysis, lower cellular ATP levels, and
  lower 99mTc-pertechnectate uptake, when compared with adherent cells. Abbreviations
  as in .
