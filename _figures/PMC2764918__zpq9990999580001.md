caption: Early steps in alkyl-phospholipid biosynthetic pathway in the peroxisome
  and two defective mutant cells. NRel-4 and NZel-1 derived from CHO cells are defective
  in dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase (DHAP-ATase) and 1-alkyl-dihydroxyacetone-phosphate
  (alkyl-DHAP) synthase, respectively.
