caption: Central metabolism and proposed involvement of identified phosphoproteins
  for the stress-induced STN7-dependent phosphorylation signaling pathway. The STN7
  kinase is assumed to be activated by stress-induced changes of the redox level and
  phosphorylate the mobile pool of LHCII proteins (LHB1B2, LHCb4.2, and LHCb1.2) and
  PsbH, thus favoring its migration to PSI and activating the state transition from
  state 1 to state 2. The stress-responsive phosphoproteins and metabolites are marked
  in red and blue, respectively. Changes of enzyme activities are shown in the green
  boxes, and the unit of enzyme activity is nanomoles gram−1 fresh weight minute−1.
  Quantitative analyses of stress-responsive metabolites are shown with the heat maps.
  Values represent log10-transformed data of peak areas. The top of the heat map shows
  salt-responsive changes. The bottom of the heat map shows oxidative-responsive changes.
  Bars represent the relative levels at 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min.
