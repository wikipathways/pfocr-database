caption: 'The metabolic pathways of chondrocyte ferroptosis and necroptosis are involved
  in the onset of pain in OA and the interplay between response components and those
  involved in other modes of cell deathThe figure mainly depicts the core network
  involved in the regulation of chondrocyte ferroptosis and the necroptosis response
  that causes pain in OA, which can be roughly divided into two parts. The left half
  is ferroptosis, and the right half is necroptosis. Kukoamine reverses several IL-1β-induced
  ferroptosis-related adverse effects. Brevilin A inhibits inflammatory responses
  and ferroptosis by modulating the SIRT1/Nrf2/GPX4 signaling. ROS further affect
  GPX4 metabolism through the Nrf2/NF-κB pathway. Mechanical overload promotes ferroptosis
  through Piezo1 activation and subsequent OA chondrocyte endocytosis of Ca2+. These
  mechanisms exhibit cooperative functions, leading to cellular ferroptosis. The left
  half is the necroptosis pathway. TRADD is a key upstream molecule for TNF-α signaling,
  and in TRADD deficiency, TNF-α-associated OA-like phenotypes, including inflammatory
  responses, extracellular matrix degradation, apoptosis, and chondrocyte necroptosis,
  can be inhibited by suppressing the activation of RIPK1/TAK1/NF-κB signaling and
  restoring impaired autophagy. ICCB-19 is a selective inhibitor of TRADD. KuKA: Kukoamine'
