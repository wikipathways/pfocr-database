caption: A complex and functionally interrelated regulatory relationship exists between
  autophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mitochondrial-derived ROS released from damaged
  mitochondria can activate the NF-κB pathway, initiating the transcription of NLRP3
  and pro-IL-1β. Consequently, this triggers the subsequent activation of the NLRP3
  inflammasome. In contrast, autophagy can be induced to eliminate endogenous inflammasomes,
  such as those originating from damaged mitochondria generating ROS, thus inhibiting
  the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, autophagy can directly target
  crucial components of the inflammasome, including NLRP3, caspase-1, and ASC, and
  can also phosphorylate NLRP3. Through the sequestration and degradation of these
  molecules, autophagy assumes a pivotal role in curbing the assembly and activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Additionally, autophagosomes possess the capability to
  sequester pro-IL-1β and caspase-1, leading to the suppression of IL-1β secretion,
  thus exerting supplementary regulatory control over the inflammatory process.
