caption: SOX members are involved in regulating several signaling pathways relevant
  to tumorigenesis, including the Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, and Hippo pathways. (A) In
  the Wnt pathway, SOX proteins can bind β-catenin or TCF/LEF to either promote or
  suppress Wnt mediated transcriptional activity. (B) In the Hedgehog pathway, SOX
  proteins act upstream to control the expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh) and downstream
  through interaction with GLI to promote transcription of pathway target genes. (C)
  In the Notch and Hippo pathways, SOX proteins bind with other factors to control
  expression of their transcription factor effectors, HES1 and TEAD2, respectively.
