caption: 'Heme metabolism and the microglial toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling
  pathway following SAH: In the subarachnoid space, free heme is metabolized by heme
  oxygenase (HO)‐1, releasing iron (Fe2+), biliverdin, and carbon monoxide (CO). Deferoxamine
  (DFX), an iron‐chelating agent, decreases the oxidative toxicity of free iron and
  increase the HO‐1‐mediated neuroprotective effect. Low‐dose CO also has neuroprotective
  effect by increasing erythrophagocytosis. Heme initiates microglial TLR4 signaling
  and activates the myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 dependent
  (MyD88) in early phase of SAH and the toll receptor associated activator of interferon‐dependent
  (TRIF) cascade in late phase of SAH. MyD88 triggers the expression of nuclear factor‐κB
  (NF‐κB) and mitogen‐activate protein kinase (MAPK), resulting in apoptosis and pro‐inflammatory
  gene expression. BBB, brain–blood barrier; ICAM‐1, intercellular adhesion molecule
