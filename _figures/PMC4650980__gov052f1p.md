caption: 'Receptor tyrosine kinases and their targeted therapies in gastroesophageal
  cancers: EGFR, VEGFR and MET. The EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
  includes four distinct receptors: the EGFR (also known as ErbB-1/HER1), ErbB-2 (neu,
  HER2), ErbB-3 (HER3) and ErbB-4 (HER4). All proteins of this family have an extracellular
  ligand-binding domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic
  tyrosine kinase-containing domain. The intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR
  receptors is highly conserved, although HER3 lacks kinase activity. HER2 functions
  as a ligand-less receptor and induces hetero-dimerization with other EGFR family
  receptors upon ligand binding, whereas EGFR and HER4 undergo homo-dimerization.
  The subsequent activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain activates phosphorylation
  cascades, and the downstream effectors include RAF, PI3K and PLC. VEGF and its receptor
  VEGFR promote angiogenesis. The overexpression of VEGF is significantly associated
  with poor prognosis in gastrointestinal cancers. The HGF/MET pathway activates complex
  signaling events that depend on the cellular context and produces a variety of cellular
  responses such as proliferation, motility, angiogenesis and invasion. The MET pathway
  is upregulated in a wide range of human tumors, and this finding often signals a
  poor prognosis.'
