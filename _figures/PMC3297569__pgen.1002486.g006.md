caption: '(A) In the B. mori CA, constitutive CYP15C1 expression allows the consistent
  conversion of homo-FAs to JHAs (predominantly JHA I and II in Lepidoptera). When
  JHAMT is expressed in CA, JHAs are further converted to JHs, and released from CA,
  thereby preventing precocious metamorphosis. When JHAMT expression is shut off (e.g.,
  in the prepupal stage), JHAs are likely to be released from CA. (B) In CA of the
  mod strain, homo-FAs are not converted to JHAs because of the loss of CYP15C1, but
  instead, homo-FAs are converted to ethyl-branched homologs of MF (homo-MFs, i.e.,
  unepoxidized JH I and II) by JHAMT. The loss of CYP15C1 does not allow the conversion
  of homo-MFs to the authentic JHs. Therefore, neither JHs is synthesized in nor released
  from CA of the mod strain, thereby causing precocious metamorphosis. The synthesized
  homo-MFs might be released from CA of the mod strain, similar to that of higher
  dipteran insects . JH I: R1 = R2 = C2H5, JH II: R1 = C2H5, R2 = CH3.'
