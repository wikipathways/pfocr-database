caption: In classical monogenic primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, the failure
  of the first-line of defence, especially natural killer cells, and also CD8+ T cells,
  leads to persistence of viral antigens. Inability to remove infected immune cells
  leads to persistent activation of dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells
  and widespread priming of CD8+ T cells (which again can be ineffective at killing)
  and also expansion of T helper 1 (TH1) CD4+ T cell clones. An IFNγ-driven pathology
  via hyper-activation of macrophages resulting in collateral damage including haemophagocytosis,
  liver pathology, coagulopathy and other manifestations; other TH1 cytokines, including
  GM-CSF, could also contribute to macrophage activation. Engineered gain of function
  as part of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy leads to a similar but
  monophasic phenotype that may include macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) phenotype
  features and that subsides with elimination of the target antigen (cell population).
  Also, given that immunodeficiency in the perforin pathway is evident in <40% of
  systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) cases and that sJIA is often associated
  with MHC-II, it is credible that the sore throat at the onset of sJIA and adult-onset
  Still disease (AOSD) results from a CD4+ helper T-cell hypersensitivity reaction
  following a quickly eliminated non-specific viral trigger; putative antigens await
  definition. Overlapping immunopathogenic mechanisms could exist. Despite compelling
  evidence for adaptive T cell responses in both the gain and loss of function settings,
  sJIA-related and AOSD-related MAS have been placed into the autoinflammatory or
  innate immunopathology category of disease, rather than along the immunological
  disease continuum.
