caption: Biosynthetic and proposed biosynthetic pathway for 18-carbon ketols, OPDA,
  and OPDA-containing MGDG. Analogous pathways are thought to convert 16:3 to dnOPDA
  and 16-carbon ketols, and dnOPDA to JA via two cycles of β-oxidation. The relationship
  of OPDA- and dnOPDA-containing MGDG, DGDG, and PG to this process is not clear,
  as indicated by the question marks, but two possibilities are that (1) trienoic
  fatty acids are released from galactolipids (or PG), converted to OPDA or dnOPDA,
  then reincorporated into complex lipids, or (2) conversion of trienoic fatty acids
  to OPDA or dnOPDA takes place on the complex lipids, and these species are later
  released.
