caption: Role of Ras downstream signaling pathways in cellular processes involved
  in kidney fibrosis. Numerous cellular mechanisms take place during kidney fibrosis
  by the action of several pro-fibrotic cytokines or growth factors that activate
  different receptors such as tyrosine kinase. Resident fibroblasts are activated
  and transdifferentiated into myofibroblasts that proliferate and synthesize ECM
  proteins. The deposition of ECM proteins and the action of profibrotic cytokines
  induce renal parenchymal cell death. The activation of Ras can activate the MAPK-ERK1/2
  pathway (phosphorylating Raf and MEK), being this the major mechanism that promotes
  cell proliferation. Resident fibroblasts are transdifferentiated into proliferating
  myofibroblasts that produce high amounts of ECM proteins. At the same time, several
  profibrotic cytokines such as TGF-β1 induce tubular cells apoptosis, and some tubular
  epithelial cells proliferate to counteract this cell death process. All these mechanisms
  are induced by the ERK1/2 pathway. The regulation (negative or positive depending
  on the context) of PI3K-Akt by Ras can affect other cellular processes such as ECM
  proteins synthesis or the promotion of tubular epithelial cells survival. In this
  figure we represent a Ras-expressing cell during kidney fibrosis in which Ras has
  been activated by growth factors and its signal has been transduced to their downstream
  effectors ERK and Akt.
