caption: Molecule targeting the mitochondrial OXPHOS pathway. The OXPHOS pathway plays
  an essential role in mitochondria and tumorigenesis. Multiple small molecules have
  been developed to inhibit this pathway at several levels. Tigecycline inhibits translation
  of mitochondria mRNA into OXPHOS subunits; Gamitrinib inhibition OXPHOS assembly;
  Deguelin, metformin and IACS‐010759 inhibits complex I in the OXPHOS pathway, while
  Gboxin inhibits complex V
