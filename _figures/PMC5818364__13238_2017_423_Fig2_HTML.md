caption: Acyl-DHAP pathway of ether lipid synthesis. This process begins in peroxisomes
  and is subsequently completed in the ER. The pathway utilizes dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  (DHAP) generated by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH)-mediated dehydrogenation
  of G3P as the substrate for ether lipid synthesis. Fatty acid synthase (FAS)-mediated
  de novo lipogenesis generates fatty acyl-CoA that is utilized by glyceronephosphate
  O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) or reduced to a fatty alcohol by a fatty acyl-CoA reductase
  (FAR1 or FAR2) to later be catalyzed by alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS),
  forming the ether bond and exchanging the acyl chain for an alkyl group. PexRAP
  (an acyl/alkyl DHAP reductase) then catalyzes the final peroxisomal step, generating
  the ether lipid precursors, 1-O-alkyl-G3P (AGP) or the diacyl phospholipid precursor
  lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The completion of phospholipid synthesis occurs in
  the ER. This includes acylation of the glycerol backbone at the sn-2 position, converting
  LPA to diacylglycerol (DAG) and AGP to alkyl-acylglycerol (AAG), as well as addition
  of a cytidine diphosphate-alcohol head group (such as CDP-choline or CDP-ethanolamine)
  at the sn-3 position to form the mature phospholipid
