caption: 'Illustration depicts the hypothetical relationship between midkine, FGF2,
  ER and neurofibromin in NF1 patients. E2 binds to ERα in the membrane, cytoplasm
  and/or nucleus. Activated ER forms homodimers recognize the ERE sequence and induce
  gene transcription []. Growth factors can also induce ER activity as a transcription
  factor and induce gene transcription. Neurofibromin acts as a co-repressor of E2
  induced gene transcription []. In NF1 patients, mutant neurofibromin may lack E2
  repressor activity and may allow transcription of genes that should be repressed,
  such as MK and FGF2. E2 can also bind GPER, which mediates non-genomic effects of
  estrogen and actives the G protein-dependent signaling pathway []. Thus GPER mediates
  a feedforward FGF2/FGFR1 paracrine activation []. DHEA is also able to induce estrogen
  signaling by binding to GPER and ER-α36 []. Receiver operating characteristic curve
  and diagnostic values or midkine as tumor marker for colorectal carcinoma. The area
  under the curve is 0.868 indicating that the diagnostic accuracy can be described
  as good. The optimal cut-off value of 56.42 pg/mL yields a balanced relationship
  between 84.3% sensitivity and 75.4% specificity. Abbreviations: CoR, coregulator;
  DHEA, dehydroepiandrostenedione; E217-beta, estradiol; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE,
  estrogen responsive element; FGF2, fibroblast growth factor 2; FGFR, fibroblast
