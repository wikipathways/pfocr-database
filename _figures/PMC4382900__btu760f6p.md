caption: An alternative MEP pathway (blue) proceeds to IPP in seven steps and was
  constructed using NetGen runs aided by SI. The intermediate step connecting (2)
  and (3) was found by manual search. The pathway to (2) was found with SI in 2 generations,
  while the pathway connecting (3) to IPP was found in a four-generation SI run
