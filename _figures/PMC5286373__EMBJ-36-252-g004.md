caption: 'Under conditions of acute hypoxia, the production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) by the electron transport chain (ETC) is increased. HIFs activate the transcription
  of the following: genes encoding enzymes of the serine synthesis pathway (SSP) and
  mitochondrial one‐carbon metabolism (m1CM) to increase the production of NADPH,
  which is used to convert oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to its reduced form (GSH);
  and genes encoding SLC7A11 and GCLM to increase glutathione production. Reduced
  glutathione is used to reverse the oxidation of cellular proteins (Proteinox) to
  their reduced forms (Proteinred). HIFs also induce expression of pluripotency factors
  that specify the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) phenotype. Hypoxia induces the BCSC
  phenotype, but only if mitochondrial redox homeostasis is maintained.'
