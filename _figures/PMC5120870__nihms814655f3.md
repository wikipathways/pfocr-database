caption: 'The cell bodies of each neurotransmitter system are located in brain regions
  whose names are colored and abbreviated as follows: BF (basal forebrain), LH (lateral
  hypothalamus), TMN (tuberomamillary nucleus), DR (dorsal raphe nucleus), VTA (ventral
  tegmental area), LC (locus coeruleus), LDT/PPT (laterodorsal tegmental and pedunculopontine
  nuclei). Not shown: GABAergic inhibition of most of these brain regions by the ventrolateral
  preoptic nucleus to promote sleep. During waking, the cortex is excited by ventral
  and dorsal pathways through the basal forebrain and thalamus, respectively. During
  REM sleep, aminergic signaling is reduced, thus blocking sensory throughput at the
  level of the thalamus, but the persistence of cholinergic signaling through the
  ventral pathway continues to excite the cortex. During NREM sleep, aminergic and
  cholinergic signaling are both reduced, leading to lowered cortical activation,
  the appearance of SWA, and its entrainment by thalamocortical loops. Yellow and
  pink areas represent the forebrain and brainstem, respectively.'
