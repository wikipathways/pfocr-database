caption: mTOR signaling in ALK+ ALCL oncogenesis. Results from earlier reports and
  this study support the hypothesis that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway contributes to
  tumor cell survival in ALCL as shown in this proposed model. In ALK+ ALCL, the most
  common chromosomal aberration involving the ALK locus is the t(2;5)(p23;q35) resulting
  in expression of the chimeric nucleophosmin-ALK oncoprotein. Nucleophosmin-ALK mediates
  oncogenesis, at least in part, through phosphorylation/activation of PI3K and its
  downstream effector, the serine/threonine kinase AKT. Activated AKT, in turn, positively
  regulates mTOR activity. mTOR can form two distinct complexes, one with raptor and
  another with rictor. mTOR-raptor complex is sensitive to rapamycin and regulates
  cell growth, in part, by phosphorylation of p70S6K and subsequently rpS6 and 4E-BP1,
  thus promoting protein translation. However, the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway model seems
  to be more complex, as recent evidence suggests that rictor-mTOR complex directly
  phosphorylates AKT on Ser473 and facilitates Thr308 phosphorylation by PDK1 in vitro
  and mTOR is directly phosphorylated by p70S6K at Ser2448. Taken together, these
  data suggest that there is a positive feedback loop from p70S6K to mTOR and from
  mTOR to AKT that possibly accelerates oncogenic signals.
