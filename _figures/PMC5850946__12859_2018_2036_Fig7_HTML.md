caption: Ras signaling cross-talk protein transport. The cross regulatory interactions
  between the components of Ras (represented by diamond shape and in pink color) and
  intracellular pathways represented by oval shape and in red color. Constituent genes
  of Ras pathway such as CSF1R, PDGFRA, FGF17, FGFR2, FGFR4, RAP1A, GRB2 and KDR are
  either regulated by the components of intracellular protein transport or they also
  regulate each other variably. Some of the components of Ras pathway such as KDR,
  FGFR4, FGFR2 are also involved in intracellular protein transport mechanism. The
  edges with arrow signs represent the four fold increase in the expression of target/effected
  genes, while edges with dot represent the four fold down-regulation
