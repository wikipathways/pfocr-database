caption: The molecular pathways of SIRTs in vascular calcification. Regarding SIRT1,
  it can regulate the osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs and vascular calcification
  through the RUNX2/osteocalcin pathway, the Wnt signaling pathway, the DNA repair
  pathway, and the NF-κB pathway. In addition, SIRT1 can alleviate the osteogenic
  differentiation of VSMCs by regulating the senescence of VSMCs through NF-κB/p53/p21
  pathway. As for SIRT3, it is mainly involved in the osteogenic differentiation of
  VSMCs by regulating mitochondrial function through PGC-1a. Besides, SIRT6 regulates
  vascular calcification through RUNX2 deacetylation in CKD.
