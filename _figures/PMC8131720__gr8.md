caption: A schematic representation of the proposed model for the mechanism by which
  miR-218 assists PRRSV in evading the host innate immune response. PRRSV infection
  results in a decrease of miR-218 that negatively regulates SOCS3 expression. The
  upregulated SOCS3 can block the interferon signaling pathway. This establishes a
  model by which PRRSV-induced miR-218 downregulation augments virus replication via
  SOCS3-mediated suppression of ISGs expression.
