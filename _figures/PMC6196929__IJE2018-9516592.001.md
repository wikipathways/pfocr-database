caption: Possible signaling mechanisms of SERM actions in neurocognition and neuroprotection.
  Over the last few years, others and we have shown that SERMs can mediate their actions
  by initiating genomic (gene expression) and/or nongenomic signaling that involve
  kinases and phosphatases. In CNS tissues, SERMs can bind and activate both classical
  estrogen receptors-α and β (ERα or ERβ) as well as nonclassical transmembrane G
  protein-coupled ER (GPER1). Via agonist action at GPER1, SERMs can activate the
  PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways (, box 1), which have been shown to be involved in
  neuroprotection and reduction of oxidative stress and neuronal cell death by increasing
  the expression of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, GPx, and eNOS), Bcl2, and other
  trophic factors. Via agonist action at the classical ERα or ERβ, SERMs can activate
  gene expression/genomic signaling (, box 2) of various growth factors and proteins
  involved in synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, memory, and cognition. SERMs can
  also enhance interaction of ERα or ERβ with MNAR/PELP1, a scaffold/coactivator protein
  highly expressed in neurons and astrocytes [,]. The resultant ER-MNAR/PELP1 complex
  can then initiate nongenomic signaling by activating the PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and
  Wnt/β-catenin/GSK3β signaling pathways (, box 3). These pathways have been shown
  to regulate neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and cognitive behaviors in the normal
  and model animals of diseases. SERMs can reduce brain inflammation by acting on
  astroglia via ERα or ERβ. They can reduce microglia proliferation (, box 4) as well
  as production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-1, IL-6, and
  TNFα via inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa-B (Nf-KB) transactivation (, box 5).
  Inhibition of this pathway has been shown to induce neuroprotection and reduce neuronal
  cell death in various cellular and animal models of brain injury. Red arrows indicate
  increase (upward) or decrease (downward) in the magnitude of response by SERMs.
