caption: Exercise and EIMD effect on GLUT4 channel translocation to sarcolemma. Moderate
  exercise promotes, whereas EIMD impedes GLUT4 channel translocation to sarcolemma
  and thus glucose entry into a muscle cell. See how proposed mechanisms of moderate
  exercise affect both insulin-independent and insulin-dependent GLUT4 channel translocation.
  EIMD on the other hand is believed to affect mostly the latter pathway leading to
  decreased insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, some molecules such as ROS, RNS and
  RAC1 appear in both pathways. The exact molecular and clinical effects of those
  and many other molecules involved in GLUT4 channel translocation remain to be elucidated.
