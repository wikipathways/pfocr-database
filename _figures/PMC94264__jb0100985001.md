caption: 'Relevant metabolic pathways. (A) Illustrated are the biosynthetic pathways
  involved in purine and thiamine synthesis. Names of genes whose products are known
  are indicated. The reaction(s) involved in the formation of PRA independent of PurF
  has not been defined biochemically or genetically. (B) Glycolysis, the pentose phosphate
  pathway, and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway are schematically represented. Names of
  genes whose products are required are indicated. Abbreviations: P, phosphate; PRPP,

  THZ-P, 4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl)-thiazole phosphate; TMP, thiamine monophosphate;
  G-3-P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid.'
