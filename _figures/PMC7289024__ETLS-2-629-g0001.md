caption: Arrows represent direction of biochemical reactions. Black, reaction steps
  and directions common to all five methanogenesis pathways from C1 compounds or acetate.
  (a) Hydrogenotrophic (red) and carboxydotrophic (blue) methanogenesis pathways.
  Formic acid and primary or secondary alcohols are oxidized to CO2 and hence methanogens
  that grow on these substrates use the hydrogenotrophic pathway. (b) Methyl respiration
  pathway (orange) and methylotrophic pathway (green). (c) Acetoclastic pathway (fuchsia).
  Purple, reactions are found only in Methanosarcina species; gray, proposed reactions.
  Shaded, electron bifurcation/confurcation reaction steps; CoB-SH, coenzyme B thiol;
  CoM-SH, coenzyme M thiol; CoM-S-S-CoB, coenzyme M-coenzyme B heterodisulfide; Fd,
  ferredoxin; Fdred, reduced ferredoxin; H4MPT, tetrahydromethanopterin; MFR, methanofuran;
  MPh, methanophenazine; MPhH2, reduced methanophenazine. See  for reactions and enzyme
  names.
