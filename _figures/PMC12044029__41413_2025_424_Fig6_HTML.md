caption: Bone-derived factors regulate renal functions. Clinical data and animal studies
  demonstrate that multiple bone-derived factors, including FGF23, sclerostin, OPG,
  LCN2 and DKK1, are tightly associated with normal kidney functions, kidney damage
  and different stages of renal diseases. Among all of these factors, the molecular
  mechanisms of FGF23 in the regulation of kidney functions are most illustrated.
  FGF23 binds to αKlotho and FGFRs together and from a 1:1:1 ternary complex, regulating
  renal functions at the different parts of renal tubes. In distal tubules, FGF23
  contributes to the Ca2+ and Na+ reabsorption and phosphate excretion by enhancing
  NaCl co-transporter NCC through ERK1/2 and SGK1 pathways. In proximal tubules, FGF23
  interacts with FGFR1 and downregulates the expression of membrane NaPi-2a and NaPi-2c,
  resulting in enhanced phosphate (pi) excretion. Moreover, FGF23 reduces the mRNA
  level of Cyp27b1 and suppress its downstream production of 25(OH)D, leading to the
  inhibition of 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis
