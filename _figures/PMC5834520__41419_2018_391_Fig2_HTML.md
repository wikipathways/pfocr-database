caption: 'Osteopontin (OPN) can interact with several integrins in Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)
  dependent and RGD independent manners. OPN can also interact with the CD44 family
  of receptors. Upon binding of receptors, OPN can induce cellular reactions include:
  survival, motility and tumour progression, MMP localisation and complement inhibition.
  By interacting with CD44 family of receptors, OPN can activate the cell anti-apoptotic
  signals in tumour cells through hospholipase C-γ(PLCγ–protein kinase C (PKC)–phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt pathway. Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) could inhibit
  Akt phosphorylation. Upon binding to αv β3, OPN activates AP1 through nuclear factor-inducing
  kinase (NIK)–ERK (extracellular signal-related kinase) and MEKK1 (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase1)–JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1) signalling pathways.
  AP1 promotes cancer cells motility and tumour progression. In addition, transactivation
  of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by OPN promotes phosphorylation of ERK
  which ultimately leads to activation of AP1. Activation of both MMP and HIF-1 pathways
  leads to enhanced tumour cell survival, proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis'
