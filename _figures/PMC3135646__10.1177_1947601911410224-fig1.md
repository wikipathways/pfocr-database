caption: The p53 pathway in development, cancer, and reprogramming. A select set of
  p53 upstream regulators and downstream effectors are shown in the context of p53-dependent
  plasticity and self-renewal. The involvement of pathway members in development,
  cancer, or reprogramming is indicated by their adjacent color-coded squares. Whether
  induced plasticity leads to induced pluripotent stem cells or stem-like cancer cells
  may depend on the extent or reversibility of oncogene activation, p53 inactivation,
  or microenvironmental factor.
