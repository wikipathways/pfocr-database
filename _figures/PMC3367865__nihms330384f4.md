caption: Downstream targets of AKT are involved in cell growth, angiogenesis, cell
  metabolism, protein synthesis, and suppression of apoptosis directly or via the
  activation of mTOR. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway can occur through the binding
  of the SH2-domains of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, to phosphotyrosine residues
  of activated RTKs such as EGFR. Alternatively, activation can occur via binding
  of PI3K to activated RAS. Mutation and more commonly, amplification of PIK3CA, which
  encodes the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), occurs most
  commonly in squamous cell carcinomas,,,. AKT, a serine/threonine kinase that acts
  downstream from PI3K can also have mutations that lead to pathway activation. One
  of the primary effectors of AKT is mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating
  proliferation, cell cycle progression, mRNA translation, cytoskeletal organization,
  and survival. The tumor suppressor PTEN, which negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT
  pathway via phosphatase activity on phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3),
  a product of PI3K is commonly suppressed in lung cancer by inactivating mutations
  or loss of expression,.
