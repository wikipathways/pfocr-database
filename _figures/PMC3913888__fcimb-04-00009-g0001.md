caption: Two major acid tolerance mechanisms in L. monocytogenes. The GAD system is
  proposed to function through the import of glutamate into the cell (via GadT1 or
  GadT2) which is converted to GABA via Gad enzymes (GadD1, D2, or D3) in the cytoplasm.
  The GABA is then thought to be exported from the cell by means of the antiport systems
  (GadT1/T2). The consumption of protons during the reaction is contributes to the
  reduction in intracellular hydrogen ion concentration (Cotter et al., ). Karatzas
  et al. () have recently proposed the existence of an intracellular GADi system that
  operates in the absence of added glutamate. The ADI system has also been proposed
  to operate via utilization of intracellular arginine as well as via arginine import
  (Ryan et al., ). The arginine biosynthetic pathway is shown. Black arrows indicate
  genes that are upregulated during growth of Listeria in the GI tract of germ-free
  mice and further upregulated through in situ exposure to Lactobacillus spp. (Archambaud
  et al., ). In such cases the enzyme is highlighted with an asterisk.
