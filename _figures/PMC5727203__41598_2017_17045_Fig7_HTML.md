caption: Regulatory network of arginine and proline metabolisms. Green boxes and yellow
  box represent the enriched DEGs (green includes up-regulated gene, yellow includes
  both up-regulated and down-regulated genes). The pathway map without coloring is
  the original version that is manually drawn by in-house software named KegSketch.
  White boxes are hyperlinked to KO, ENZYME, and REACTION entries in metabolic pathways,
  and to KO and GENES entries in non-metabolic pathways. Purple boxes are hyperlinked
  to KO entries that are selected from the original version.
