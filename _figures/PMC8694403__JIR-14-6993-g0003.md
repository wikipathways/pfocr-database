caption: Results from quantitative proteomic analysis verified from PRM were displayed.
  (A) 5 proteins including fibrinogen beta chain, testicular tissue protein Li 70,
  C reactive protein, serotransferrin, haptoglobin from the 13 overlapping DEPs detected
  via iTRAQ were confirmed by PRM and compared between responders and non-responders.
  The results of PRM confirmed significant differences in the expression changes of
  TF. (B) bioinformatics analysis showed upstream pathway of TF was associated with
  HIF-1 signal. (C) bioinformatics analysis showed downstream pathway of TF was associated
  with ferroptosis.
