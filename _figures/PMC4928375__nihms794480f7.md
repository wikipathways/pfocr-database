caption: 'CycC is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor that antagonizes oncogenic
  Notch1. Notch1 is a binary cell-fate determinant. Signal-regulated intramembrane
  proteolysis of Notch1 produces a transcriptionally active Notch intracellular domain
  (ICN1) that traffics to the nucleus and regulates gene expression programs involved
  in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Left: In CycC-proficient (CycC+/+)
  cells, CycC–CDK8/19 function as physiological suppressors of ICN1-dependent gene
  expression by phosphorylating and thereby priming ICN1 for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteosome
  pathway (). Right: In CycC-deficient (CycC+/− or CycC−/−) cells, oncogenic ICN1
  escapes proteolytic destruction resulting hyperactivated signaling that drives tumorigenesis
  (). Note that proteolytic turnover of promoter-bound ICN1 shown here is based on
  prior findings (). The location of ICN1 turnover as described by  has not been described.
