caption: Proposed roles of EVs obtained from patients with breast cancer in the migration
  and invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. EVs, extracellular vesicles; Ctrl
  EVs, EV fractions obtained from healthy women; BC EVs, EV fractions obtained from
  women with breast cancer; p, phosphorylated; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MMP, matrix
  metalloproteinase.
