caption: The IFN, EGFR/Ras signaling pathways and their interactions with virus-encoded
  proteins. The kinase PKR is an important downstream effector molecule of the IFN
  signaling pathway. When a cell is infected by a virus, it is stimulated to produce
  IFNs that will activate an antiviral defense response of nearby cells. Upon binding
  of IFNs to cell surface receptors (IFN-R) on neighboring cells, an intercellular
  signal transduction cascade is engaged, which induces PKR expression. The dsRNA
  produced by viruses will bind to PKR, and lead to autophosphorylation of the PKR
  homodimer and activation of its kinase activity. The activated PKR phosphorylates
  eIF-2α, which in turn inhibits protein synthesis and thereby viral replication in
  the cells. Ad, HSV and VV encode a number of viral proteins to inhibit the antiviral
  response. For examples, virus-associated (VA) RNAs produced by Ad; E3L and K3L proteins
  by VV and NS1 protein by IFA, all can inactivate PKR. Cancer cells have accrued
  many mutations in these signaling pathways. Inactivating mutations of the IFN signaling
  pathway can be found in many cancer cells. Oncolytic VSV targets this characteristic
  for its natural oncotropism. A constitutively activated Ras signaling pathway, another
  common feature for tumor cells, leads to inhibition of PKR autophosphorylation.
  Oncolytic NDV and reovirus depend on this characteristic for their tumor cell selectivity.
