caption: Human inherited and mouse experimental defects in the cholesterol biosynthesis
  pathway that cause myelin disorders. Solid line arrows depict a direct link between
  two steps, dashed line arrows imply intermediate steps that are not shown. Dark
  gray ovals show the positions of human disease genes; light gray oval shows the
  position of mutated genes in experimental mouse models. Sqs, squalene synthase;
  DHCR7, sterol delta-7-reductase; SLOS, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome; CYP27A1, sterol
  27-hydroxylase; CTX, Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis; ABC1, ATP-binding cassette
  transporter A1; TD, Tangier disease.
