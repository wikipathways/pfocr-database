caption: The regulatory unit of the glycolytic pathway composed of the fructose steps
  at the interface between the initial step of glucose trapping in the cell through
  phosphorylation and the conditioning of the glucose molecule for catabolism. Several
  molecules in these fructose steps are regulatory in nature and determine the glycolytic
  flux rate. Regulatory proteins that inhibit glucokinase (GK) in pancreatic beta
  cells and the liver are encircled in green (midnolin and parkin) and blue (GRP),
  respectively. FBPase-2, which activates glucokinase in pancreatic beta cells and
  the liver, is encircled in red. Regulatory small molecules that are expressed only
  in the liver but not in pancreatic beta cells are printed in blue. +, activation;
  −, inhibition; −−, strong inhibition of target structures. HK, hexokinase; PP, pentose
  phosphate.

  description: The regulatory unit of the glycolytic pathway composed of the fructose
    steps at the interface between the initial step of glucose trapping in the cell
    through phosphorylation and the conditioning of the glucose molecule for catabolism.
    Several molecules in these fructose steps are regulatory in nature and determine
    the glycolytic flux rate. Regulatory proteins that inhibit glucokinase (GK) in
    pancreatic beta cells and the liver are encircled in green (midnolin and parkin)
    and blue (GRP), respectively. FBPase-2, which activates glucokinase in pancreatic
    beta cells and the liver, is encircled in red. Regulatory small molecules that
    are expressed only in the liver but not in pancreatic beta cells are printed in
    blue. +, activation; −, inhibition; −−, strong inhibition of target structures.
    HK, hexokinase; PP, pentose phosphate.
