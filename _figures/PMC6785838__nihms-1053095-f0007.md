caption: The selenol in the sample can undergo oxidation to form the seleninate, which
  then undergoes rapid β-syn elimination to produce the dehydroalanine-containing
  peptide (species D). The truncated peptide (species E) is potentially explained
  by attack of the nucleophilic seleninate oxygen onto the carbonyl of the amide backbone,
  resulting in a cyclic seleninate ester and elimination of the Sec residue (lower
  pathway). Species F can be produced through a radical mechanism. Initiation of the
  radical could be photo-induced or alternatively, the selenolate can react with molecular
  oxygen to produce the selanyl radical and superoxide. The selanyl radical could
  recombine with molecular oxygen resulting in a seleninyl radical that can break
  down into selenium dioxide (SeO2) and an alanine-containing peptide.
