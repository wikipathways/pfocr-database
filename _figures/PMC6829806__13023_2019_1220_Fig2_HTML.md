caption: Hypothetical neuroimmune activation model leading to a vicious cycle of demyelination
  in metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). Sulfatide accumulation causes death of Schwann
  cells and phagocytes, and destruction of myelin in the peripheral nervous system
  (PNS) []. Destruction of myelin activates the third complement component (C3) by
  the alternative pathway [, ], possibly promoted by the disruption of Schwann cells
  and nerve environment [] due to sulfatide accumulation. Myelin sheaths are subsequently
  opsonized by C3b and C3d molecules (hypothetical), which can induce a humoral immune
  response and act as ‘eat-me’ signals to trigger phagocytosis via the third complement
  / macrophage-1 receptor (CR3/MAC-1) [], respectively. In addition, sulfatide accumulation
  induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activates endoneural macrophages
  [, ] by acting on the scavenger-receptor-AI/II (SRAI/II) []. The released pro-inflammatory
  cytokines act on the lipophilic receptors (eg. TLR) of endoneural macrophages to
  assist the phagocytosis of sulfatides and breakdown of myelin sheaths []. Macrophage
  cell death due to the accumulation of sulfatides (shown in purple) also results
  in presenting sulfatides on their HLD-DR receptors. This assists the activation
  of lymphocytes that are recruited and activated due to binding of sulfatides and
  pro-inflammatory cytokines on L-selectin []. The activation of lymphocytes in turn
  leads to cell death and a vicious cycle of demyelination
