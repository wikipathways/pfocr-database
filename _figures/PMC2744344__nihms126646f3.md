caption: Potential mechanism for SR proteins to prevent R-loop formation during transcriptional
  elongation. The Pol II-associated SR proteins may help displace nascent RNA from
  the template DNA to suppress R-loop formation during transcriptional elongation.
  The absence of SR proteins may introduce positive and negative DNA supercoiling
  in front and back of induced R-loops, thereby retarding the movement of the Pol
  II complex. Prolonged RNA loops may potentiate DNA breaks and initial ssDNA breaks
  may be further converted to dsDNA breaks by both DNA replication dependent and independent
  mechanisms. Recognition of DSBs by the MRN complex recruits ATM to trigger the S-phase
  checkpoint. DSBs may be further trimmed by the exonuclease activity of the MRN to
  produce excessive single-stranded 3′ overhangs, which induces the binding of the
  single strand DNA binding protein RPA and recruits ATR. The activated ATM/ATR pathway
  triggers a cascade of events, leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
