caption: A UMAP with latent factor loading (left) and major genes involved in synaptic
  transmission that are differentially regulated along the gradient of the latent
  factor (right). B Schematics summarizing the role of the mGluR1 pathway, including
  DGKβ/γ (red) and the mGluR2/3 pathway (blue) in continuous changes in synaptic responses.
  C Schematics of temporal responses from a small group of UBCs showing the multiscale
  nature of temporal representation at a population level. D Same five cells normalized
  and replotted on a logarithmic time axis clearly demonstrate the Weber’s law behavior
  of the UBC population temporal basis and its ability to support learning over multiple
  time-scales.
