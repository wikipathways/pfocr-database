caption: The beneficial effects of celastrol against valvular and vascular calcification.
  Celastrol, as a natural potent NOX2 inhibitor, alleviates calcific aortic valve
  disease (CAVD) by blocking glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 β)/β-catenin pathway
  in aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs). Likewise, celastrol reduces reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress by upregulating haem oxygenase-1
  (HMOX-1) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Celastrol also has the capacity
  to alleviate both valvular and vascular calcification via inhibition of bone morphogenetic
  protein 2 (BMP2)-Smad1/5 and Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Green arrow indicates “increase”,
  red arrows indicate “decrease”.
