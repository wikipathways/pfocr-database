caption: 'Mechanisms underlying the cancer‐associated procoagulant state. Cancer‐mediated
  hypercoagulability occurs as a consequence of direct activation of procoagulant
  pathways by cancer cells (mediated by aberrant tumor cell TF expression, release
  of tumor cell‐derived, TF‐expressing microparticles, cancer procoagulant, and other
  cell surface proteases) or from indirect systemic effects of cancer on a variety
  of cell types, including leucocyte, endothelial cells, and platelets. In various
  malignancies, neutrophils are “primed” to release their contents in the form of
  NETs, resulting in direct activation of procoagulant pathways, platelet activation,
  and inhibition of naturally occurring anticoagulant pathways, including tissue factor
  pathway inhibitor. As a consequence of these various direct and indirect mechanisms,
  patients with cancer have an elevated risk for venous thromboembolism. Abbreviations:
  FXa, factor Xa; NET, neutrophil extracellular trap; TF, tissue factor.'
