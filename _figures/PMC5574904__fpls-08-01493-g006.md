caption: 'A model for the involvement of ethylene and auxin in root growth responses
  to different ABA treatments. In the model, ABA regulates root growth through two
  distinct pathways: (1) an ethylene-independent stimulatory pathway that operates
  at low [ABA] and requires auxin signalling and auxin efflux through PIN2/EIR1; and
  (2) an ethylene-dependent inhibitory pathway that operates at high [ABA] and that
  also requires auxin signalling and auxin influx through AUX1. Ethylene regulates
  root growth through downstream auxin is based on the report that aux1-T mutant exhibited
  ACC-resistant root growth ().'
