caption: Model of DISC1 at the synapse. Multiple pieces of evidence show that DISC1
  is a component of the postsynaptic density (PSDs) of excitatory synapses and regulates
  their form and function. It is likely that the effects of DISC1 are mediated through
  a range of protein interaction partners. The function of complexes of DISC1 and
  PSD proteins Kalirin-7 (kal-7) and Traf- and nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) are currently
  being elaborated. Kal-7 and TNIK both regulate the actin cytoskeleton, but it is
  currently unknown whether these two complexes act in a common pathway or independently
  of each other.
