caption: The biosynthetic pathway of B vitamins completed by Arsenophonus sp. and
  P. maidis. The KEGG pathway analysis was conducted, and enzyme commission numbers
  (EC numbers) are shown above. The EC numbers in red font within red boxes represent
  enzymes that were found in the P. maidis transcriptome; those in blue font within
  blue boxes represent enzymes that were found in the Pm Arsenophonus genome; and
  those in blue font within red boxes indicate enzymes that were found in both. B
  vitamins are shown in solid purple circles
