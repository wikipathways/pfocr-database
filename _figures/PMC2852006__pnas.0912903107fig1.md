caption: Biosynthesis of L-homoalanine and its pharmaceutical applications. (A) Chemical
  synthetic routes of antiepileptic and antituberculosis drugs from the chiral intermediate
  L-homoalanine. (B) Constructing a nonnatural metabolic pathway for L-homoalanine
  fermentation. Engineered E. coli can overproduce the natural amino acid threonine
  from glucose. Threonine is converted to 2-ketobutyrate by threonine dehydratase.
  Then L-homoalanine is synthesized from 2-ketobutyrate by amination.
