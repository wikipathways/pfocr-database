caption: IL-33 release and signaling via ST2L. IL-33 is predominantly expressed by
  stromal cells such as epithelial and endothelial cells. Damage to these cells can
  induce necrosis and release of full length IL-33 which can activate the heterodimeric
  ST2L/IL-1RAcP receptor complex on a variety of immune cells or be neutralized by
  binding to sST2. During apoptosis IL-33 is cleaved by caspases-3/7 leading to its
  inactivation. Upon activation of ST2L MyD88 and IRAK-1/4 are recruited and this
  leads to activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is mediated by the activation
  of the MAPKs extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and JUN N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) and ultimately to the production of Th2 cytokines and chemokines.
