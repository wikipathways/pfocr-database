caption: Schematic representation of amino acid, energy and Wnt signaling to mTORC1.
  Rag GTPases were identified as mediators of amino acid signaling to mTORC1. When
  an adequate supply of amino acids is present, an active Rag complex consists of
  GTP-bound Rag A or Rag B and GDP-bound Rag C or Rag D. The Rag complex is able to
  recruit and anchor mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface which facilitates mTORC1 activation
  by Rheb. Ragulator functions as a GEF for Rag A/B and also as a scaffold to help
  anchor the Rag complex to the lysosome. v-ATPase interacts with Ragulator and is
  required for mTORC1 activity. The GATOR1 complex functions upstream of the Rag complex
  as a GAP for Rag A/B GTPase and inhibits mTORC1 activity. The GATOR2 complex interacts
  with and inhibits GATOR1. Sestrin1/2 and CASTOR1/2 are cytosolic leucine and arginine
  sensor, respectively. The presence of leucine and arginine disrupts the association
  of Sestrin1/2 and CASTOR1/2 with GATOR2, resulting in the elimination of their inhibition
  towards GATOR2. SLC38A9 is an important lysosomal arginine sensor and amino acid
  transporter that directly interacts with Ragulator. FLCN and its binding partner
  FNIP2 were identified as Rag-interacting proteins with GAP activity for Rag C/D,
  but not for Rag A/B. Reduction in oxygen or energy levels are sensed by AMPK which
  can be activated by upstream kinase LKB1 under the conditions of the increased intracellular
  AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios. The activated AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 and enhances
  its GAP activity towards Rheb-GTP, finally resulting in the inhibition of mTORC1
  activity. Hypoxic stress also stabilizes the transcription factor HIF1α which drives
  the expression of REDD1. The latter is a negative regulator of mTORC1 activity.
  Additionally, the activated Wnt signaling pathway stimulates mTORC1 activity via
  GSK3β repression. Black arrows and red T-bars represent stimulatory and inhibitory
  signals, respectively
