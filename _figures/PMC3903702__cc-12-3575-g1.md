caption: Figure 1. Cellular and molecular effects of BRCA1 loss on PRC2 function and
  development of basal-like breast cancer. BRCA1 binds directly to EZH2 in a region
  that is known to be bound by HOTAIR lncRNA, which, in turn, blocks HOTAIR-facilitated
  genome-wide occupancy of PRC2 on chromatin. However, loss of BRCA1 in mammary luminal
  epithelial cells may enhance the interaction of PRC2 with HOTAIR, thereby promoting
  PRC2 targeting on chromatin, increase in H3K27me3 levels at target loci, epigenetic
  silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), and ultimately development of basal-like
  breast cancer. Targeting of this deregulated pathway by the EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i)
  or HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) may represent a viable therapeutic option for basal-like
  breast cancer.
