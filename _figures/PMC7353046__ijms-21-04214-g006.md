caption: Dowling Degos Diseases and Notch signaling. Dowling Degos Disease (DDD) is
  a rare skin genodermatosis characterized by hyperkeratotic papules and reticulate
  hyperpigmentation. Classical DDD is induced by mutations in KRT5 gene encoding for
  keratin 5, and the latter is a fundamental protein required for the synthesis of
  intermediate filaments, principally in the epidermal cells of the stratum basale.
  The loss of expression of KRT5 during epidermal differentiation seems to be linked
  to an activation of Notch signaling, therefore negatively impacting epithelial remodeling.
  Other genes involved in DDD are POFUT1, POGLUT1 and PSENEN, encoding for GDP-fucose
  protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1), Protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 (POGLUT1)
  and presenilin enhancer protein 2 (PSENEN), respectively. POFUT1 mutations lead
  to nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript, to impaired Notch signaling and to
  an abnormal pigmentation of the skin. Mutations in POGLUT1 gene presumably cause
  a nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA resulting in haploinsufficiency, in a blockade
  of the Notch pathway and in promoting cell differentiation. Pathogenic PSENEN variants
  impair Notch signaling and cause an aberrant differentiation and pigmentation of
  the epidermis, leading to reticulate pigmentation, comedones, follicular hyperkeratosis,
  nodules and scars. Pointed arrows (→) define the induction of the indicated process
  or associated function, while the truncated arrow (T) designates the inhibition
  of the described process.
