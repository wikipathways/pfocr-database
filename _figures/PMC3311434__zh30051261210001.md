caption: Model for PepT1 interaction with bacterial peptides. PepT1 becomes upregulated
  in cases of chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because
  of upregulation of PepT1 in the colon, bacterial di/tripeptides in the lumen are
  transported by PepT1 into intestinal epithelial cells. Known bacterial ligands of
  PepT1 include N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), muramyl dipeptide (MDP),
  and L-Ala-γ-D-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid (Tri-DAP). Upon intracellular accumulation
  of bacterial di/tripeptides, the NF-κB pathway is activated and downstream proinflammatory
  cytokine and chemokine production increases. Disruption of barrier function is associated
  with IBD; therefore transport of fMLP, MDP, and Tri-DAP most likely occurs via the
  paracellular pathway, as well as through PepT1-mediated transport. Once in the lamina
  propria, fMLP and other bacterial di/tripeptides may be taken up by macrophages.
  Upon PepT1-mediated transport of fMLP, macrophages upregulate major histocompatibility
  class I molecules. The increased production of cytokines/chemokines most likely
  contributes to increased cellular infiltration into areas of inflammation. MCP,
  monocyte chemoattractant protein.
