caption: Extracellular purine turnover is comprised of the release of endogenous ATP
  upon cell damage or via non-lytic mechanisms of vesicular exocytosis (VE), connexin
  hemichannels (Cx) and other ion channels and transporters; the triggering of signaling
  events via nucleotide (P2XR and P2YR) and adenosine (AdoR) selective receptors;
  the metabolism of nucleotides and nucleosides; and the uptake of nucleotide-derived
  adenosine via equilibrative (ENT) and concentrative (CNT) nucleoside transporters.
  General schemes of adenosine producing and removing pathways have included a role
  for the enzymes nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (NTPDase1/CD39), nucleotide
  pyrophosphatase/ phosphodiesterase-1 (NPP1), ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 and adenosine
  deaminase (ADA). In addition, counteracting adenylate kinase-1 (AK1) and nucleotide
  diphosphokinase (NDPK) activities contribute to the regeneration of extracellular
  ATP via reversible phosphotransfer reactions. Intracellular adenosine metabolism
  depends on the cytoplasmic form of adenosine kinase (ADK-S), and the enzymes ADA,
  cytosolic nucleotidase (cN-I), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and adenine
  phosphoribosyl transferase (APRTase). S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) can also be hydrolyzed
  to adenosine (Ado) and homocysteine (HCy) by SAH hydrolase (SAHH), while S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) serves as the donor of a methyl group in the transmethylation reactions catalyzed
  by methyltransferases (MT). Because mitochondria are the main source of ATP production,
  mitochondrial bioenergetics is tightly linked to adenosine homeostasis. In the cell
  nucleus adenosine is part of the transmethylation pathway, which adds methyl groups
  to DNA (DNA-CH3) with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). The nuclear form of adenosine
  kinase (ADK-L) drives the flux of methyl groups through the pathway leading to increased
  DNA and histone methylation. For the sake of clarity only the most important enzymes
  are mentioned.
