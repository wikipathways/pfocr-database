caption: An Oxygen-Sensing Mechanism in Plants Mediated by Group VII ERF TFs.Under
  normoxic conditions, constitutively expressed ERFs, such as RAP2.12, form a complex
  with membrane-bound ACBPs. ACBP-ERF complexes could also occur in the cytoplasm.
  In such complexes, oxidation of the N-terminal Cys of these ERFs, which targets
  them for degradation by the N-end rule pathway, might be prevented. When oxygen
  concentrations fall, ERFs move to the nucleus to induce hypoxia-responsive gene
  expression. It is not clear whether hypoxia triggers ERF dissociation from ACBPs.
  Hypoxia also induces expression of other ERFs, such as HRE1 and HRE2, which could
  then induce their downstream target genes. Upon reoxygenation, the oxidation of
  N-terminal Cys of these ERFs would target them for degradation, and this would switch
  off the hypoxia response.
