caption: An idealized representation of T cell metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics
  in CAR T cell therapy. The figure illustrates a simplified representation of T cell
  metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics during the stages of CAR T cell therapy. The
  process begins with naive T cells characterized by quiescent mitochondria that mainly
  use oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) as a metabolic pathway. The obtained T cells
  are transferred to the CAR T production process, where they first undergo activation.
  This stage is characterized by a significant increase in energy demand and consequently
  a shift in metabolism towards glycolysis. At the same time, mitochondria undergo
  fission, multiplication, and formation of cristae - intricate invaginations of the
  inner membrane that serve to expand the surface area of the inner membrane to increase
  energy production capacity. After activation, the cells are genetically modified,
  usually by exploiting viral vectors such as lentiviral or retroviral vectors encoding
  for a CAR receptor. This modification normally has no significant effect on cellular
  metabolism or mitochondrial dynamics. Once the genetically modified CAR T cells
  are produced, they enter a stage of proliferation in which they further multiply
  their mitochondria and continue to rely on glycolysis to meet their increased energy
  demands. Subsequent steps include purification and quality control, culminating
  in the production of the infusion product, which consists mainly of effector T cells
  (Teff), effector memory T cells (Tem), and central memory T cells (Tcm). Effector
  T cells are characterized by a high rate of glycolysis and increased mitochondrial
  biomass, which enables the cells to respond rapidly to target cells and effectively
  perform their cytotoxic function within a short period of time. Central memory T
  cells, on the other hand, typically possess elongated mitochondrial structures and
  primarily utilize oxidative phosphorylation, allowing them to extend their lifespan
  and persist in the organism. The phenotype of effector memory T cells can be simplistically
  viewed as a combination of both and therefore exhibits both glycolytic and oxidative
  phosphorylating metabolism. Once infused into the patient, CAR T cells rapidly recognize
  tumor cells and exert a cytotoxic effect on them. Cytotoxicity is a highly energy-consuming
  process characterized by a high rate of glycolysis and increased mitochondrial biomass.
  Mitochondria are polarized along the cellular cytoskeleton toward the immunological
  synapse, providing the energy required for production, polarization, and formation
  of the immunological synapse, as well as for transfer of lytic granules into target
  cells to induce apoptosis - in the case of CAR T cells, apoptosis of target cancer
  cells. Remarkably, a single CAR T cell can eliminate multiple cancer cells. Following
  the cytotoxic effect, the majority of T cells become exhausted, with mitochondria
  undergoing mitophagy and the cells losing their effector function as all types of
  metabolism diminish. These cells may undergo apoptosis, initiated by the mitochondria,
  leading to rupture of cell structures and cell death. However, a small subset of
  cytotoxic cells transforms into central memory T cells, forming a permanent immunological
  memory for the specific antigen
