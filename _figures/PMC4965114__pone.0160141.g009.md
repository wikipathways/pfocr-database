caption: 'A general schematic showing the effects of Cobalt alloy particulate on macrophages
  acting directly and indirectly on three major pro-inflammatory innate immune pathways:
  1) general toxins (such as inducing hypoxia like cell responses), 2) as danger associated
  molecular patterns, DAMPs (inflammasome induced activation), and 3) interacting
  with the pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) pathway of TLR4.'
