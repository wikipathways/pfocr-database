caption: JAK/STAT signaling induction by type I and II cytokines. (1) In the resting
  state, the subunits of type I and II cytokine receptors are at a short distance
  from each other. (2) The engagement of ligand with receptors leads to receptor dimerization
  and JAK activation. (3) The activated JAKs phosphorylate the tyrosine residue of
  the receptor which recruits various members of STAT proteins. (4) Phosphorylated
  and activated STATs make themselves dimmer. (4) STATs complex translocates to the
  cell nucleus. (5) STATs bind to the promoter and lead to the transcription of cytokine-responsive
  genes ().
