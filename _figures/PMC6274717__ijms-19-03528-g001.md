caption: Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of interleukein-6 (IL-6)
  mRNA. Bacterial and fungal components and the molecules derived from tissue injury
  activate cell surface or intracellular Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB) is a main transcriptional factor to induce transcription of IL-6 mRNA.
  AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 5a (Arid5a) translocates into the
  nucleus via an importin-α/β1 pathway and binds to the 3′UTR of IL-6 mRNA. Then,
  Arid5a exports IL-6 mRNA to the cytoplasm via the chromosomal region maintenance
  1 (CRM1) pathway by binding to up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1) and protects IL-6
  mRNA from degradation by Regulatory RNase-1 (Regnase-1). Regnase-1 degrades transcriptionally
  active IL-6 mRNA by binding to the IL-6 3′UTR in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum
  and ribosomes. Another RNA-binding protein Roquin recognizes mRNAs overlapping with
  Regnase-1. However, Roquin degrades inactive mRNA by recruiting deadenylase in stress
  granules and processing bodies. The balance between the degradation of IL-6 mRNA
  by Regnase-1 and the protection of IL-6 mRNA by Arid5a controls the quantity of
  IL-6 production.
