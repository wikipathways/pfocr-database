caption: Proposed mechanism of TAAR1’s role in modulating dopamine (DA) transmission
  fluctuations induced by cocaine. Cocaine blocks dopamine transporter (DAT) function
  and thus inhibits DA reuptake by binding to the DAT (1). The DA D2 receptor is a
  G-protein-coupled receptor, which, when attached to TAAR1 can form a heteromeric
  complex. This complex potentiates DA D2 receptor-mediated pre-synaptic autoinhibition
  and inhibits DA D2 receptor-mediated post-synaptic signalling. As a sentinel system,
  TAAR1 is sensitive to shifts in DA concentrations and promotes DA homeostasis (2).
  Sumanirole, a DA D2 receptor agonist causes a similar inhibition of cocaine-induced
  changes in DA uptake (3) and the antagonist L-741,626 potentiates cocaine-induced
  effects on DA clearance (4). DA D2 receptor stimulation activates GSK-3 β-arrestin2-dependent
  pathway (5) and the TAAR1/DA D2 receptor heteromeric complex inhibits GSK-3 through
  the same pathway (6). Thus, inhibiting GSK-3 with SB631736 activates AKT, which
  is bound to D2/DAT complex, increasing DA reuptake (7).
