caption: Role of cathepsin S (CatS) in the immune-suppressive milieu of the tumor
  microenvironment (TME). (a) CatS is overexpressed in many tumors and favors the
  MHC-II pathway, leading to an increase of CD4+ T cells instead of cytotoxic CD8+
  T cells. (b) The inhibition of CatS can enhance the anti-tumor immune response by
  promoting cytotoxic CD8+ T cells instead of CD4+ T cells [,].
