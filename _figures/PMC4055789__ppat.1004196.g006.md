caption: 'For the proteins investigated in this study, red indicates a positive involvement
  and gray indicates a partial involvement. Blue indicates important upregulated proteins
  and intermediates from previous studies: Glucose transporter (GLU1) is from Huang
  et al. , and G6PDH is from Chen et al. . Elevated metabolic pathways are shown in
  pink. Pathway inhibitors are indicated in black boxes. Dashed lines indicate inferred
  regulatory mechanisms that were not investigated in the present study.'
