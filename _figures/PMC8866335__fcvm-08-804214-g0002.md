caption: 'Mechanisms of atherosclerosis induced by sdLDL-C. (A) Lipid metabolism:
  SdLDL-C reduces the expression of ATF3 and EGR2, ATF3 decreases the ability of SR-BI
  by interacting with p53 and 4α and promotes CYP8B1 to inhibit cholesterol reverse
  transport; EGR2 leads to an increase in CE production and FC outflow, thus increasing
  the oxidation sensitivity of sdLDL-C. On the other hand, the low affinity of apoB-100
  on the surface of LDL-C receptors and sdLDL-C makes it difficult for the receptors
  to recognize sdLDL-C and is more easily absorbed by phagocytes to form foam cells
  and promote the occurrence and development of AS. (B) Oxidative stress: The increase
  of sdLDL-C level reduces the production of VLCFA and miR-126, which affects lipid
  metabolism and fatty acid β oxidation; miR-126 affects HDL uptake, and enhances
  signal transduction resulting in AS. In addition, ox-sdLDL can also increase the
  expression of adhesion molecules and induce excessive production of ROS and RNS,
  resulting in the enhancement of oxidative stress to cause AS. (C) Fibrinolytic system:
  SdLDL-C increases the levels of PAI-1 and TXA2. PAI-1 inhibits the function of u-PA
  and t-PA, which easily leads to thrombosis. TXA2 activates TP receptor and activates
  RhoA/Rho21 kinase pathway through its G protein coupled receptor, and increases
  calcium levels in hepatic stellate cells, resulting in vasoconstriction, platelet
  aggregation, thrombosis and AS. (D) Inflammation: SdLDL-C levels reduces IDO, causing
  a decrease in vascular tolerance by affecting the Kyn pathway; LP-PLA2 increased
  that activated TRPC1/TRPC3 channels, calcium influx, Bax and caspase-3 pathways
  to cause apoptosis; increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and the formation
  of foam cell, suggesting an inflammatory response. SdLDL-C, small, dense low-density
