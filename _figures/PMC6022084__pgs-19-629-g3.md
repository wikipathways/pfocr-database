caption: (A) First, deep neural networks are trained on various existing datasets
  and/or their combinations with known outcomes. (B) To perform prediction, unseen
  data of the same format as training samples are given to trained networks as inputs.
  (C) At the prediction step, a model produces outcome(s) that it was trained to predict
  during the training phase, for example, personalized drug response, probability
  of adverse events or novel pharmacogenomic variants and their pathway mapping. (D)
  Validation of the predicted responses occurs when true outcomes become available
  on various population stratification levels. For example, it can be individual patient
  treatment response, clinical trial results or new pharmaceutical study results.
  Data with observed true outcomes can again be used as a training set via a feedback
  loop, as shown.EHR: Electronic health records.
