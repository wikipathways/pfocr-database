caption: Targeting the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system with multiple therapeutic
  approaches. The schematic shows several examples for intervening in the HIF pathway
  in different layers, including modulating the mRNA translation, protein stability,
  dimerization, and transcriptional activity of HIF. Translation of HIF-α can be activated
  by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  pathway, which makes it possible to modulate HIF-α protein level by using inhibitors
  targeting either PI3K (wortmannin, LY294002, and GDC-0941) or mTOR (rapamycin and
  PP242). EZN-2698 is an antisense RNA antagonist that specifically binds and inhibits
  the translation of HIF-1α mRNA. Another translational inhibitory agent includes
  PX-478. The histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat can block the heat shock protein
  90 (Hsp90)–mediated HIF-α protein stabilization and transcriptional activation.
  Other agents modulate the HIF-α transcriptional activity, including the factor-inhibiting
  HIF (FIH) inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. MG132
  can stabilize HIF-α protein by direct blocking proteasomal degradation. PT2385,
  PT2399, and PT2977 are selective compounds that allosterically disrupt the heterodimerization
  of HIF-2α and HIF-1β. HRE, hypoxia response element; mTORC, mTOR complex; OH, hydroxide;
  p300, a transcriptional co-activator; PHD, prolyl-4-hydroxylase; Ub, ubiquitin;
  VHL, von Hippel–Lindau.
