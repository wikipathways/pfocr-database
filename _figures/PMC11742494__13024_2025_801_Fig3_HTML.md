caption: CHI3L1 Interactions and Intracellular Signaling Pathways in Neuroinflammation
  and Tumor Progression. CHI3L1 interacts with various cell surface receptors, including
  IL-13Rα2, syndecan-1/αvβ3, and RAGE, triggering multiple intracellular signaling
  pathways. These interactions lead to diverse cellular outcomes, such as the regulation
  of apoptosis, tumor metastasis, inflammation, carcinogenesis, and tumor angiogenesis.
  Interaction with syndecan-1 induces angiogenesis through integrin αvβ3 and MAPK
  signaling. CHI3L1’s interaction with RAGE activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, promoting
  tumor progression by facilitating immune evasion and migration. Similarly, interactions
  with IL-13Rα2 drive carcinogenesis and tumor angiogenesis via Erk1/2, Wnt/β-catenin,
  and Akt signaling pathways. Additionally, CHI3L1 modulates brain inflammation and
  neurodegenerative disorders by influencing the IL-13 signaling pathway through IL-13Rα2,
  enhancing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6, and activating
  pathways like AKT and ERK1/2
