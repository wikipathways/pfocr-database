caption: A model of the immunopathogenic pathway of FS. Environmental factor(s) trigger
  the production of nonpathogenic IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies against the EC5 domain
  of Dsg1. In certain genetically predisposed individuals, intramolecular epitope
  spreading results in the generation of predominantly IgG4 antibodies, against the
  EC1 and EC2 domains of Dsg1, that induce disease.
