caption: 'Biochemical pathway and chemical structural information regarding selected
  flavonoid compounds in plants. (A) Schematic diagram of the biosynthetic pathways
  of the major flavonoids (; ). Dashed arrows represent the unclear steps. The names
  and structures of three anthocyanidin compounds are indicated. The enzyme names
  in black boxes are as follows: CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase;
  F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid
  3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase;
  FNS, flavones synthase; FLS, flavonol synthase; GT, glycosyltransferase; OMT, O-methyltransferase.
  (B) Chemical structures of anthocyanins, flavones, and flavonols in Paeonia flower
  petals (; ).'
