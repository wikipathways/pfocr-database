caption: Cell Wall Integrity (CWI) pathway. Cell wall damage is sensed at the plasma
  membrane via cell-surface proteins that stimulate nucleotide exchange on Rho1 and
  activation of Pkc1. The main role of activated Pkc1 is to trigger the MAPK module
  (Bck1, Mkk1/Mkk2, and Slt2). Phosphorylation of Slt2 leads to the activation of
  the transcription factors SBF (Swi4/Swi6) and Rlm1. SBF is mainly involved in regulating
  genes during G1/S transition, whereas Rlm1 is responsible for the transcriptional
  activation of most of those genes induced in response to cell wall stress. Rlm1
  elicits transcriptional positive feedback loops on the expression of RLM1 and SLT2,
  which result in the amplification of gene expression levels of CWI-responsive genes.
  In contrast, the Rlm1-dependent transcriptional induction of the Slt2 phosphatases,
  Ptp2 and Msg5, attenuates the induction of the CWI pathway, negatively modulating
  the CWI transcriptional activation response. In addition, other Slt2 phosphatases,
  like Ptp3, Sdp1, and Ptc1, also contribute to this attenuation. Arrows and T symbols
  represent activation (positive) and inhibitory (negative) events, respectively.
