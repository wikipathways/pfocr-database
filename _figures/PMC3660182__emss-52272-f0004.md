caption: Crosstalk between inflammatory and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways in MPTP-induced
  SVZ plasticity. This is a simplified scheme summarizing MPTP-induced neuroinflammation
  and SVZ plasticity via modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. During the early degeneration
  phase of MPTP toxicity, hyper-activated microglia contributes to the impairment
  of SVZ neurogenesis at different levels. By increasing oxidative and nitrosative
  stress and in synergy with MPTP/MPP+ direct toxicity, microglia-derived mediators
  [plasma membrane NADPH oxidase (PHOX)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
  iNOS-derived nitic oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite] may act as a molecular switch for
  cell signaling pathways that are critically involved in the physiological control
  of NPC homeostasis, with harmful consequences for astrocyte and NPC physiology,
  at least in part through GSK-3β activation, followed by phosphorylation and consequent
  degradation of β-catenin. By contrast, pharmacological mitigation of inflammation
  and oxidative stress with Apo, L-Nil or HCT1026 upregulate β-catenin and successfully
  rescue NPC proliferation and neuroblast formation, a process associated with striatal
  DAergic neuroprotection, with further positive modulation of SVZ proliferation via
  DA subtype 2 receptor (D2R)-activated mechanisms. The role of astrocyte–microglia
  interactions in the plasticity of the SVZ response to MPTP is exemplified by the
  astrocyte’s ability to overcome microglial inhibitory effects, also via crosstalk
  with Wnt/β-catenin signaling. EGF, epidermal growth factor; GF, growth factor; RNS,
