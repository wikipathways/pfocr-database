caption: Host noncoding RNA involved in regulating influenza A virus response signal
  pathway. The natural immune response is the body’s first line of defense against
  viral infection and involves the activation of multiple antiviral signal pathways
  as well as the activation and expression of antiviral factors. During this process,
  host noncoding RNAs are induced or inhibited by influenza virus infection, which
  mediates the activation of target genes, affects the expression of antiviral natural
  immune molecules, and indirectly regulates the replication and proliferation of
  influenza virus. The target gene sites in the natural immune response signaling
  pathway involved in the regulation of noncoding RNA are concentrated in the RLR
  signaling pathway, TLR-like receptor signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signal pathway,
  and NF-κB signaling pathway. (Dotted arrow is indirect effect; solid line is direct
  effect).
