caption: However, genetically unmodified porcine hearts transplanted into primates,
  including humans, encounter rapid and powerful xenogeneic reactions mediated by
  preformed antibodies, most notably those against αGal epitopes. In GGTA1-knockout
  organs that lack αGal this hyperacute response is almost completely prevented, but
  non-Gal-antibodies binding to other porcine antigens induce a delayed but strong
  humoral rejection. Antigen-antibody binding leads to rapid activation of the complement
  system. The classical (CP) and lectin pathways (LP) converge at the level of the
  CP/LP convertase C4b2b, whereas the alternative pathway (AP) culminates in the AP
  convertase C3bBb. Both convertases cleave C3, the central component of the complement
  system, to C3b and C3a. Amplification loops then follow, producing the anaphylatoxins
  C3a and C5a and resulting in the assembly of the cell-perforating terminal complement
  complex (TCC) (). The activated complement system damages transplanted hearts by
  direct cell lysis and via signals that cause leucocyte infiltration; microthrombi
  are another undesirable consequence [, ].
