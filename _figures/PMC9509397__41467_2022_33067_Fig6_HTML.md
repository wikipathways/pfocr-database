caption: Obese adipocytes acquire increased antigen presenting capability leading
  to an increase in CD4 + Th1 cells in AT that produce IFNγ. Increased IFNγ suppresses
  Treg differentiation and enhances Treg exhaustion, augments adipocyte MHCII pathway
  which is not common to other cytokines, and attenuates adipocyte mitochondrial function
  and fatty acid flux to create an escalating cycle of inflammation and insulin resistance.
  Exhaustion features in human Tregs include increased expression of inhibitory co-receptors
  and markers of apoptosis and suppressed LKB1.
