caption: Model of the possible contributions of JAK1, 2/STAT3 signaling pathway in
  CRC development. Proteasome-mediated proteolysis promotes dephosphorylation of the
  JAK2 kinase and, consequently, negatively regulates JAK/STAT3 signaling in CRC.
  Other unknown mechanisms may also have been involved in this process. Furthermore,
  JAK1, 2/STAT3 signaling is implicated in many areas of tumor progression, including
  cell growth, survival, invasion, and migration by regulation of gene expressions,
  such as Bcl-2, p16ink4a, p21waf1/cip1, and p27kip1, E-cadherin, VEGF, and MMPs.
  Additionally, FAK may be a component of the JAK pathway and a downstream of JAK,
  which may exert its oncogenic effects through interaction with other signal transduction
  pathways.
