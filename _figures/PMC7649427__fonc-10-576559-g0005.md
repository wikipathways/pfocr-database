caption: A cartoon showing a cell with the pathways related to NF-κB and p53. The
  mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways up-regulate the expression
  of Pgp via NF-κB and protect it from degradation. NF-κB can directly bind to the
  MDR promotor. The p38 MAPK pathway mediates cell death, cell differentiation and
  cell cycle checkpoints. It is activated in response to oxidative stress, cytokines
  and DNA damage. p38 MAPK is primarily located the cytoplasm, but upon stimuli that
  induce DNA double strand breaks it enters the nucleus. The p53 protein is involved
  in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and lipid catabolism.
