caption: 'Beclin 1, its protein interactions and its role in autophagy. Beclin 1 has
  been found to form part of different class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
  complexes. Each complex consists of beclin 1, Vps34, Vps15 and Ambra1. ATG14L activates
  the complex and induces the formation of autophagosomes. UVRAG and ATG14L are present
  in mutually exclusive class III PI3K complexes and UVRAG and Bif-1 have been shown
  to activate the complex. UVRAG has also been shown to function in autophagosome
  maturation and endocytic trafficking possibly independent from its interaction with
  beclin 1. Rubicon has also been shown to bind beclin 1 and can inhibit autophagosome
  formation and maturation. TAB1/2, two upstream activators of the TAK1-IKK signaling
  pathway interact with beclin 1 and their dissociation seems to be necessary for
  autophagy induction. GAPR-1 can also bind beclin 1 and inhibit autophagy probably
  through beclin 1 tethering in the Golgi apparatus. Bcl-2/Bcl-XL can bind beclin
  1 and inhibit autophagy. JNK1 phosphorylates Bcl-2 while DAPK phosphorylates beclin
  1 and disrupt their interaction. Additionally, BH3-only proteins (tBid, Bad, BNIP3)
  or BH3 mimetics (ABT737) bind Bcl-2 and release beclin 1. Beclin 1 has also been
  found to be a substrate of caspases-3, 7 and 8 during apoptosis, in which cleavage
  of beclin 1 suppresses autophagy. Other beclin 1 interacting proteins that induce
  autophagy are PINK1 and VMP1. TRAF6 and USP13 have been shown to regulate beclin
  1 ubiquitination. Survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein can also bind beclin 1 and
  regulate TRAIL induced apoptosis. NAF-1, a component of the IP3 receptor complex
  contributes to the interaction of Bcl-2 with beclin 1 at the ER[,-]. Proteins and
  drugs shown are color-coded according to their effect on autophagy. Red: Inhibits
  autophagy; Green: Induces autophagy; Yellow: Unknown.'
