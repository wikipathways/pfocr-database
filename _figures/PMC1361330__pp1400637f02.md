caption: Effects of Suc on the mRNA accumulation for genes coding for flavonoid and
  anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes in Arabidopsis seedlings. Arabidopsis seeds were
  germinated for 3 d and subsequently treated without (C) or with (S) 90 mm Suc for
  6 h. Genes coding for enzymes involved in the flavonoid and anthocyanin pathways
  were identified by searching the Arabidopsis annotation in The Arabidopsis Information
  Resource (http://www.arabidopsis.org/). Microarray data (averaged transcript level
  from two biological replicates) were visualized using Heatmapper Plus software (http://bbc.botany.utoronto.ca/ntools/cgi-bin/ntools_heatmapper_plus.cgi).
  The output of the software is shown, with the genes involved in each metabolic step
  represented by their respective AGI codes. A black square (and black shades) indicates
  a gene whose transcript level is low. A yellow square (and yellow shades) indicates
  a gene whose transcript level is relatively high within the group of genes putatively
  coding for the same function. AGI codes marked with a red triangle indicate the
  genes chosen for further studies. Arabidopsis mutants have been isolated on the
  basis of modified seed pigmentation and are therefore known as tt (for transparent
  testa) mutants (, ), and TT loci identified have been characterized. When available,
  the TT gene codes are reported in the figure.
