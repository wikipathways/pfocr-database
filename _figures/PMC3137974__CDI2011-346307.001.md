caption: Signal pathway activation by the main TLR and CLR receptors that detect Candida.
  Signalling through TLRs proceeds mainly via TRAF6 with a variety of adaptor proteins
  acting as intermediaries between receptor and TRAF6. Foremost among these is MyD88
  which is utilised by all known TLRs except TLR3. As well as MyD88, there are other
  adaptor molecules, including TRIF, MAL, and TRAM, with the different TLRs using
  different combinations of these adaptors. Activation of these adaptors leads to
  activation of IRAK1, 2, and 4 followed by ubiquitination of TRAF6 which leads to
  subsequent activation of downstream signalling pathways. Signalling through CLRs
  utilises cytoplasmic ITAM domains to interact with the SYK adaptor molecule, activating
  the Card-9-Bcl10-Malt1 protein complex. Some CLRs, such as Dectin-1, include a modified
  ITAM domain in their cytoplasmic domain. Others, such as Dectin-2, associate with
  other receptor molecules, notably the FcRγ and DAP12 proteins, which possess the
  ITAM domain that transduces the signal into the cell. In all cases, the net effect
  is to activate the MAPK and NF-κB pathways, leading to upregulation of specific
  gene transcription. In addition to this, TLRs are also known to activate transcription
  via members of the IRF family, including IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7.
