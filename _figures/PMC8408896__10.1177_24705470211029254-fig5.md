caption: Roles of PKC and BDNF on maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton in the dendritic
  spine. Protein Kinase C (PKC) and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulate
  and maintain the actin cytoskeleton in the dendritic spine. PKC can interact directly
  with actin regulating proteins by phosphorylating them. Myristoylated alanine-rich
  C kinase substrate (MARCKS) is a F-actin cross-linking protein acting as a bridge
  connecting the actin cytoskeleton directly to the dendritic spine membrane. Furthermore,
  it can promote actin polymerization. Upon phosphorylation by PKC, MARCKS is redistributed
  from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm and unable to bind to F-actin. PKC can
  also alter actin indirectly, e.g. through phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2)
  actions. In the setting of increased stress, high levels of catecholamines, including
  norepinephrine (NE), can act through lower affinity alpha-1 adrenergic receptors
  (α1-AR) to drive Gq-IP3R-mediated calcium-protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. In both
  stressed rodent and macaque models, PKC expression is increased in PFC. The increased
  PKC signaling could lead to actin cytoskeletal disruption resulting in dendritic
  spine instability. BDNF is a versatile molecule that can influence actin cytoskeleton
  through TrkB receptor signaling. Downstream of TrkB receptor signaling leads to
  recruitment of RHO-family GTPase (RAC1), leading to activation of serine/threonine-protein
  kinase (PAK) and LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) which can phosphorylate and inhibit
  cofilin1, thus blocking its ability to sever actin filaments. Another pathway downstream
  of BDNF-TrkB signaling is the recruitment of cortactin, an F-actin binding protein.
  Cortactin activates and stabilizes actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex for
  nucleation of actin filaments, which is necessary for formation of new actin filament
  branches. In the setting of increased, persistent stress, we see alterations of
  BDNF expression, notably decreases in BDNF expression. This could have significant
  downstream consequences for the actin cytoskeleton structure of dendritic spines.
