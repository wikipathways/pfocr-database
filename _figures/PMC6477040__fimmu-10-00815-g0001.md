caption: Overview on the principles of canonical and non-canonical NFκB pathways activation.
  The canonical NFκB pathway is activated by the kinase complex comprising IKKα (IKK1),
  IKKβ (IKK2) and regulatory NEMO which are for example activated via the TRAF/ RIP
  complexes (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00326). The activated IKK1/IKK2/NEMO
  complex phosphorylates the IκB bound to NFκB dimers (such as p50-p65 and p50-c-Rel),
  leading to ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-induced degradation of IκB.
  The degradation releases the NFκB dimers, allowing them to bind κB site-containing
  DNA and rapidly accumulate in the nuclear compartment. After activation, the synthesized
  IκB proteins and also TRAF bind to and inhibit NFκB activity and traffic it back
  to form a negative feedback loop. The ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, regulated by
  the WNT and Notch pathways, represses NFκB function by deubiquitinating of IκB.
  The non-canonical NFκB pathway is activated through NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK, or
  MAP3K14), which phosphorylates IKKα (IKK1) which triggers the generation of p50-RelB
  via proteolytic processing of p100 and binding to RelB.
