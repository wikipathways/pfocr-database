caption: The mechanism of diabetes promoting myocardial fibrosis via AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK)/enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)/peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ (PPAR-γ) signaling pathway. Under normal glucose, phosphorylation of
  AMPK phosphorylates EZH2, which inhibits the trimethylation activity EZH2, leading
  to expression of PPAR-γ and inhibition of myocardial fibroblasts activation. Under
  the condition of diabetics, high glucose inactivates AMPK, increases trimethylation
  activity EZH2 by reducing the phosphorylation of EZH2 at T311, which represses transcription
  of PPAR-γ and suppressed diabetic fibrosis. P, phosphorylation; EED, embryonic ectoderm
  development; SUZ12, suppressor of zest 12; H3K27me3, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation;
  TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; GSK126, competitive
  inhibitor of PRC2
