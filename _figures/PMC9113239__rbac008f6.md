caption: Cartoon model showing the regulation of Dex on the binding of BMP-2 to its
  receptor and BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation via Runx2 activation. Dex
  at low concentration is beneficial to the ability of BMP-2 to bind to cell membrane
  surface receptors and thus up-regulated the downstream signaling pathway. Dex has
  no obvious effect on phospho-Smad1/5/8 protein and id-1, but it can up-regulate
  Runx2 expression and then promote osteoblastic differentiation and inhibit myoblast
  differentiation in C2C12 cell model
