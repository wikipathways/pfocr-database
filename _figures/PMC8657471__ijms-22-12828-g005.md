caption: Potential targeting of EREG/EGFR may be applied to a subset of NSCLC and
  gastric cancer patients. (A) High EREG expression levels were found in the EGFR-mutant,
  BRAF-mutant NSCLC cells, a subset of NSCLC cells with wild-type EGFR/KRAS/BRAF.
  In NSCLC cells overexpressing EREG, the inhibition of MEK or ERK could reduce the
  expression of EREG regardless of the mutation status. Therefore, the activation
  of the MEK/ERK pathway is a common mechanism of EREG upregulation in NSCLC. EREG
  levels are decreased by siRNA-mediated EGFR knockdown and EGFR inhibitors in EGFR-mutant
  NSCLC cells. Moreover, lung tumors of mutant EGFR transgenic mice exhibit high EREG
  expression. In NSCLC cells with EGFR mutations, both EREG knockdown and anti-EREG
  antibodies inhibit cell proliferation and invasion and induce apoptosis. Collectively,
  targeting EREG may be a therapeutic option for EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells with resistance
  to EGFR-TKIs. (B) EREG is epigenetically silenced in gastric cancer cells through
  aberrant DNA methylation and histone modification. EREG is methylated and reduced
  in human gastric cancer cells and primary tissues from a subset of gastric cancer
  patients. EREG gene expression was reduced by aberrant CpG methylation of the EREG
  promoter. In addition, treatment with 5-aza-CdR demethylated the CpG site in the
  EREG promoter, which resulted in the rescue of EREG expression. DNA methyltransferase
  3 beta (DNMT3b) predominantly regulates CpG methylation and silencing of the EREG
  gene. Moreover, treatment with 5-aza-CdR dynamically increased active histone marks
  (H3K4me3 and AcH3) and decreased the repressive mark (H3K27me2). The combination
  treatment with 5-aza-CdR and cetuximab exerts a synergistic antiproliferative effect
  on gastric cancer cells.
