caption: Signaling pathway involved in phosphate-induced myocardial hypertrophy. Phosphate-induced
  myocardial hypertrophy critically prompts the activation of calcineurin. Calcineurin
  dephosphorylates the NFAT-3 transcription factor in the cytoplasm, and the dephosphorylated
  NFAT-3 further interacts with the GATA-4 transcription factor in the nucleus to
  turn on the expression of hypertrophy response genes such as ANP and BNP that participate
  in the development of myocardial hypertrophy. Administration of the pharmacological
  agent CsA may completely block calcineurin enzymatic activity but may have no significant
  inhibitory effect on myocardial hypertrophy. Moreover, MEK1/2-ERK1/2 expression
  both increase significantly, and cellular hypertrophy is markedly attenuated by
  U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor. These results suggest that hyperphosphate induces myocardial
  hypertrophy through the ERK signaling pathway in H9c2 cells.

  description: Signaling pathway involved in phosphate-induced myocardial hypertrophy.
    Phosphate-induced myocardial hypertrophy critically prompts the activation of
    calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates the NFAT-3 transcription factor in the
    cytoplasm, and the dephosphorylated NFAT-3 further interacts with the GATA-4 transcription
    factor in the nucleus to turn on the expression of hypertrophy response genes
    such as ANP and BNP that participate in the development of myocardial hypertrophy.
    Administration of the pharmacological agent CsA may completely block calcineurin
    enzymatic activity but may have no significant inhibitory effect on myocardial
    hypertrophy. Moreover, MEK1/2-ERK1/2 expression both increase significantly, and
    cellular hypertrophy is markedly attenuated by U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor. These
    results suggest that hyperphosphate induces myocardial hypertrophy through the
    ERK signaling pathway in H9c2 cells.
