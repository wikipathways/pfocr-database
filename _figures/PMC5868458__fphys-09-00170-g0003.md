caption: 'The protein expression levels of healthy cerebral cortex cells mapped onto
  the GBM pathway map from the TCGA data set. In this diagram, The Human Protein Atlas
  database was used to obtain protein expression levels of healthy cerebral cortex
  cells. Special shapes used in the map represent different types of molecules which
  are given in the legend of the figure as protein complex, protein family, protein
  or small molecule. Lines and arrows show the relationship of the molecules. Each
  protein symbol (circle) is divided into quarters to represent, in a clockwise order:
  endothelial cells, neuropil, neuronal cells, and glial cells. The corresponding
  protein expression levels are shown in different colors. Olive for not available,
  deep sky blue for not detected, green for low expression, medium orchid for medium
  expression, and deep pink for high expression. The original GBM pathway map in the
  Cytoscape format was downloaded from (“The Cancer Genomics at cBio—Glioblastoma
  (TCGA)” n.d.).'
