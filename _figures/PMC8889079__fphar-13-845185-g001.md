caption: 'A schematic diagram of the association between NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  and AD pathogenesis. Both Aβ oligomers and Tau aggregates are involved in the inflammatory
  response of AD. Fibrillar Aβ species are regarded as PAMPs that triggers NF-κB activation
  through pattern recognition receptors (such as TLRs) to elevate inflammasome components
  NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. NLRP3, ASC, and pro-caspase-1 assemble together to form the
  NLRP3 inflammasome, which subsequently activates caspase-1, cleaves pro-IL-1β to
  produce the active form of IL-1β and secretes it extracellularly. In addition, phagocytosis
  of soluble Aβ also triggers lysosome leakage and consequently results in the emission
  of cathepsin B, which leads to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, Aβ oligomers
  can act as damaging stimulis to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, causing the production
  and accumulation of ROS, release of mtDNA, or cardiolipin externalization, which
  activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Autophagy can not only clear Aβ, but also clear
  NLRP3, ASC and pro-caspase-1 inflammasome-related protein molecules. Mitophagy can
  selectively remove impaired mitochondria and relieve the release of damaging molecules
  within mitochondria. Therefore, autophagy and mitophagy can negatively regulate
  the activation of NLRP3. Aβ also indirectly regulate the activation of the NLRP3
  inflammasome through the autophagy or mitophagy pathway. Moreover, the activation
  of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibits the phagocytosis of Aβ by glial cells, which contributes
  to the deposition of Aβ and facilitates the formation of Aβ plaques. In conclusion,
  Aβ can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through different pathways. However, once
  the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated, it in turn increases the deposition of Aβ and
  the formation of Aβ plaque, which forms a positive feedback loop that amplifies
  Aβ pathogenic effect. Similar to the role of Aβ, Tau is regarded as an endogenous
  dangerous molecule that can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. After the NLRP3 inflammasome
  is activated, it increases the activity of Tau kinase and phosphorylase, and facilitates
  the phosphorylation and aggregation of Tau, thereby also forming a positive feedback
  loop. Persistent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggered by Aβ and Tau contributes
  to the development of chronic neuroinflammation, which ultimately leads to the neuronal
  loss and cognitive impairment. AD: Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ: amyoid β; PAMPs: pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns; TLRs: Toll-like receptors; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B; NLRP3:
  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing
  3; ASC: apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD; ROS: reactive
  oxygen species; mtROS: mitochondrial ROS; mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; MyD88: myeloid
  differentiation factor 88; GSDMD: gasdermin D.'
