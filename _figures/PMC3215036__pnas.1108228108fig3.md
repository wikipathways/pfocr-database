caption: Deduced pathway from siroheme to d1 and heme. (A) The corrected modified
  tetrapyrrole pathway is shown with siroheme now acting as an intermediate for heme
  and d1 heme synthesis. This pathway can be compared to C. (B) The branched pathway
  from siroheme to d1 and heme is shown together with the enzymes that are thought
  to be involved with each particular step. Didecarboxysiroheme is generated from
  siroheme by the sequential decarboxylation of the side chains attached to C12 and
  C18. For d1synthesis, didecarboxysiroheme is modified by replacement of the propionate
  side chains at C3 and C8 with oxo groups in a reaction likely catalyzed by NirJ
  to generate a pre-d1 intermediate, which is converted into d1 by the introduction
  of a double bond on the propionate side chain on C17. For heme synthesis, didecarboxysiroheme
  is modified by the action of AhbC to remove the acetic acid side chains attached
  to C2 and C7 to give Fe-coproporphyrin. This intermediate is converted into heme
  by AhbD through the oxidative decarboxylation of propionate side chains on C3 and
  C8.
