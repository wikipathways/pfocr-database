caption: Toy example solution. Possible scenarios when FZD7 and FZD1 are expressed.
  W5F7C represents the WNT5A/FZD7 complex, W3F1C represents the WNT3A/FZD1 complex,
  and ABSTR represents the Wnt receptor signaling pathway, planar cell polarity pathway.
  Dark and light nodes represent inactive and active nodes in the final solution respectively,
  namely Ei = 0 and Ei = 1. The dashed edge in a gene g represents highly expressed
  genes (g ∈ G) whereas continuous edges represent lowly expressed genes (g ∈ L).
  A WNT5A and WNT3A are lowly expressed. For the abstract to be active we need to
  activate one lowly expressed gene (WNT3A in the example). A knockout of FZD1 requires
  the activation of one lowly expressed gene (WNT5A in the example) thus providing
  an equivalent solution (Swild = SFZD1, FZD1 is not essential). B WNT5A is lowly
  expressed and WNT3A is highly expressed. For the abstract to be active we do not
  need to activate any lowly expressed gene. A knock-out of FZD7 does not require
  the activation of any lowly expressed gene for the abstract to be active (Swild = SFZD7,
  FZD7 is not essential). C WNT5A is highly expressed and WNT3A is lowly expressed.
  For the abstract to be active we do not need to activate any lowly expressed gene.
  A knock-out of FZD7 requires the activation of one lowly expressed gene (WNT3A)
  for the abstract to be active (Swild < SFZD7, FZD7 is essential)
