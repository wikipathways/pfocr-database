caption: 'Glutathione distribution in subcellular compartments. GSH (γ- L-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine),
  a water-soluble tripeptide formed by the amino-acids glutamic acid, cysteine and
  glycine, is considered the major non-protein low molecular weight modulator of redox
  processes and the most important thiol reducing agent of the cell. (1) ATP-dependent
  GSH biosynthesis occurs in the cytosol of the cell and cysteine (red) and glutamate
  cysteine ligase (gray) are rate-limiting factors for its production. (2) Extracellular
  GSH is enzymatically degraded on the surface of the cells by γ-glutamyl transpeptidase
  generating the γ-glutamyl fraction (taken into the cell as γ-glutamyl-amino acid
  that can be metabolized to release the amino acid and 5-oxoproline, which can then
  be converted into glutamate to be used in the synthesis of GSH) and the cysteinyl-glycine
  fraction; and by dipeptidases splitting cysteinyl-glycine generating cysteine and
  glycine that are taken into the cell. (3) To allow normal cell function, it is essential
  to maintain an optimal GSH: GSSG ratio throughout all cell compartments. (4) The
  inner mitochondrial membrane system transport, that involves dicarboxylate and 2-oxoglutarate
  anion transporters, allows the passage of negatively charged GSH from the cytosol
  to the mitochondria. (5) GSH is present in both reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG)
  states, and reduced GSH is maintained by GSH reductase, a cytosolic NADPH-dependent
  enzyme. GSSG returns to the reduced state by the NADPH-dependent activity of glutathione
  reductase. NADPH is rapidly regenerated from NADP + using electrons derived from
  catabolism of substrate molecules, such as glucose or isocitric and malic acid (pentose
  phosphate pathway). Reduced GSH neutralizes cellular hydroperoxides through GSH
  peroxidase activity.'
