caption: 'Construction of ML-hGRN for lignocellulosic pathway. a. Four-layered hGRN
  built with GGM bottom-up algorithm. The gene IDs represented by each symbol can
  be found in Additional file : Table S1. b. The gene association network of lignocellulosic
  pathway built with ARACNE algorithm that identifies expression profile-dependent
  genes. The input files for both bottom-up GGM algorithm and ARANCE include the profiles
  of 1622 transcription factors and 25 lignocellulosic pathway genes. The nodes with
  coral (red) color highlight in both networks are known regulatory TFs for lignocellulosic
  pathway in existing knowledgebase. The gene IDs represented by each symbol can be
  found in Additional file : Table S2'
