caption: 'Underlying mechanism of Fusobacterium nucleatum pathogenesis in colorectal
  cancer. (1) In pathway 1, the FadA in Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) adheres
  to and invades human epithelial cells and endothelial cells, and inflammatory cytokine
  (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, TNF-α and NF-κB) levels increase in a proinflammatory
  microenvironment that accelerates the progression of colorectal tumors; (2) In pathway
  2, FadA interacts with E-cadherin on the epithelial cell, activates β-catenin signaling,
  increases NF-κB inflammatory gene expression and promotes tumor cells proliferation.
  However, F. nucleatum-infected cells increase the expression of miRNA by activating
  Toll-like receptor and further promote the release of miRNA; (3) In pathway 3 and
  4, F. nucleatum dampens human T-cell activation in a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment
  that supports tumor cell growth by blocking the mid-G1 phase of cell cycle and attracting
  myeloid-derived suppressor cells; and (4) In pathway 5, the interaction between
  Fap2 of F. nucleatum and the human inhibitory receptor TIGIT induce human lymphocytes
  cell death and generate a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes
  colorectal tumor progression. MDSC: Myeloid-derived suppressor cell; TLR: Toll-like
  receptor.'
