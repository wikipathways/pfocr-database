caption: We identified a novel signaling cascade comprising sequential P. gingivalis
  LPS stimulation → ANGPTL2 induction → integrin α5β1 → inflammatory cytokine induction,
  which results in potent periodontal disorganization activity in gingival epithelial
  cells. The bold line is generally considered as the main pathway mediating inflammatory
  cytokine production by periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis LPS. Non-bold
  line is shown as a novel signaling pathway via ANGPTL2 in P. gingivalis LPS stimulation.
  The dashed line is based on a hypothesis that ANGPTL2 is one of key mediator between
  periodontal disease and systemic disease.
