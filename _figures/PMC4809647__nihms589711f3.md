caption: (A) The principal component analysis (PCA) in which each sphere represents
  the result from an individual sample (chip) with the plotted location based upon
  the grouping of each sample relative to the others is shown. The blue spheres represent
  Treg cells from Fil+ and those from Fil− are shown in red. (B-D) The list of the
  top 10% and two-fold differentially regulated genes of Treg cells from Fil+ compared
  with Treg cells from Fil− was then imported into IPA for pathway anlaysis. The pathways
  of (B) CTLA-4, (C) IL-10 and (D) TCR signaling with differentially upregulated (red)
  or downregulated (green) genes in Treg cells from Fil+ relative to Treg cells from
  Fil− are shown.
