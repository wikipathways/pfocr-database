caption: Shh pathway targets and regulatory networks. Interactions are based on both
  genetic data and on genome-wide transcriptional and chromatin binding analyses.
  Blue indicates pathway inhibitory interactions, red indicates activating interactions,
  non-colored circle represents genes with complex activities; lines do not necessarily
  denote direct interactions and may occur at the transcriptional or protein level;
  circle sizes have no significance. A. Shh pathway feedback regulation involving
  signal transduction components. B. Shh pathway feedback regulation by target TFs.
  For simplicity, only interactions with Shh/GliA and Gli3R are shown and cross-regulation
  among targets are not indicated (for e.g. Hand2 also regulates Irx3,5 and Tbx3).
  C. Ectodermal-mesodermal feedback loops operating in Shh pathway to regulate AP
  patterning and expansion. As noted in the text, expression levels are highly dynamic
  and some of the regulatory interactions shown occur at different times (e.g. initiation,
  or termination of feedback loops).
