caption: NOD2 receptor signaling pathway. The receptor NOD2, which detect bacterial
  components, play a critical role in inflammatory signaling by driving the ubiquitination
  of RIPK2. Upon ligand engagement, RIPK2 is recruited through CARD-CARD domain interactions,
  leading to its ubiquitination facilitated by E3 ubiquitin ligases. These ligases
  generate K63-, K27- and M1-linked ubiquitin chains. The chains are then recognized
  by kinase complexes that are dependent on ubiquitin, specifically the TAK1-TAB complex
  and the IKKα/β-NEMO complex. Activation of TAK1 triggers MAP kinase signaling cascades,
  while IKK phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκB, marking it for ubiquitination
  (via K48-Ub chains) and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This process culminates
  in the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which, together
  with AP-1, drives the expression of genes that orchestrate inflammatory and immune
  responses, including those encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
