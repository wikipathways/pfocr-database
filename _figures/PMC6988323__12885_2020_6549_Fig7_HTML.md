caption: Hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in group B. a, mechanisms of ovarian
  suppression by the Gn-RH analog in women of reproductive age. The Gn-RH analog causes
  the down-regulation of Gn-RH receptors in pituitary cells, which then induces a
  decrease of gonadotropin secretion and the subsequent low production of estrogen
  in the ovary. Under these low-estrogen conditions, Gn-RH secretion in the hypothalamus
  may be accelerated. b and c, possible explanation for the delayed resumption of
  menses in women during TAM administration after combined Gn-RH analog treatment.
  b, the delayed resumption of menses during TAM administration after combined Gn-RH
  analog treatment suggests transient suppressing effects of TAM on Gn-RH secretion
  in the hypothalamus (see pathway [I]). TAM acts on the hypothalamus as an estrogenic
  modulator under the low-estrogen conditions during Gn-RH analog treatment, suppressing
  high secretion of Gn-RH in the hypothalamus. c, the suppressing effects of TAM persist
  for over half a year even after cessation of the Gn-RH analog. When the balance
  between the hypothalamus-suppressing effect [I] and negative feedback-inhibitory
  effect (see pathway [II]) become converted, normal follicular growth and menses
  gradually restart and then OHS will occur
