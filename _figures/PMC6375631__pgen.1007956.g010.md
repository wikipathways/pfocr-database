caption: The first step in pol V Mut regulatory pathway requires transfer of a molecule
  of RecA from the 3'-tip of a RecA* nucleoprotein filament to pol V (UmuD'2C) to
  form pol V Mut (UmuD'2C-RecA). Pol V Mut exists in 3 conformational states determined
  by the orientation of RecA on pol V. When first assembled pol V Mut (UmuD'2C-RecA)
  is catalytically inactive (State 1) and cannot bind to p/t DNA. A subsequent addition
  of ATP (or ATPγS) activates pol V Mut = UmuD'2C-RecA-ATP (State 2) due to ATP induced
  reorientation of RecA relative to UmuC, termed “ATP induced RecA switch”. Once activated,
  pol V Mut can bind to p/t DNA and synthesize DNA, including TLS (X denotes a DNA
  template lesion). Pol V Mut can either statically deactivate in the absence of DNA
  synthesis (State 3) with a rate of about 0.02/min at 37°C or deactivate dynamically
  (State 3) in the presence of DNA synthesis (0.023/min at 37°C). Deactivated pol
  V Mut can be activated (i.e., reactivated) via transfer of a “new” molecule of RecA
  from the 3'-tip of a RecA* nucleoprotein filament, in which the new RecA replaces
  the old RecA [], followed by binding of ATP/ATPγS. Deactivated pol V Mut cannot
  be reactivated by binding to ATP or ATPγS. Both deactivation processes occur more
  rapidly at 37°C compared to at 30°C. Deactivation is inhibited in the presence of
  bound ATP and accelerated in the presence of bound p/t DNA – see text.
