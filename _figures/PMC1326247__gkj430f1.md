caption: Possible biochemical linkages between 5-FU toxicity and damage to RNA and
  DNA. (A) The 5-fluorouracil may interfere with nucleic acid structure and function
  through inhibition of TS and disruption of nucleotide pool balance or the direct
  incorporation of 5-fluoronucleotides into DNA and RNA. (B) Although it has been
  hypothesized that uracil BER plays an important role in mediating 5-FU toxicity,
  the lethal intermediate along this pathway remains to be identified. Possible intermediates
  moving clockwise around the cycle are the mutagenic 5-FU base itself, the abasic
  product of the Ung1 reaction, or various incised products derived from the intact
  abasic site (see text).
