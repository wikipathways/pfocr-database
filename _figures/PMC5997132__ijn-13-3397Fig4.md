caption: 'The main pathway targeted using siRNA delivery systems in oral cancer.Notes:
  Examples of siRNA therapeutics alter multiple hallmarks applied for oral cancer.
  Cell growth and proliferation are impaired by siRNA for Pa28α, Sox4, or Angptl4.
  Local inflammation is reduced by IL-8. Invasion and metastasis are decreased by
  siRNA for Sox4, Ang2, Angptl4, Wnt, Ctsb, Slug, Ck14, Has2, Versican, Frmd4A, Cxcr4,
  and Cip2A. Angiogenesis is inhibited by siRNA targeting VEGF, Angptl4, and Ang2.
  MDR is inhibited by siRNA for Mdr1 and Mdr2. Phagocytosis is stimulated by siRNA
  for Cd47. Tumor growth is reduced in the presence of siRNA for Cip2A and Frmd4A.
  The heat-shock response is decreased by siRNA for Bag3.Abbreviations: IL-8, interleukin-8;
  MDR, multidrug resistance; siRNA, small interfering RNA; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor.'
