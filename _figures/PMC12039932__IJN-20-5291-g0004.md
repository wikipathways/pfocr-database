caption: Nanomaterial-based DDSs treat OA by targeting synoviocytes. Nanomedicines
  modified with different ligands target synoviocytes through the corresponding receptors
  on synoviocytes to release functional drugs. Different nanomedicines regulate synoviocytes
  through different mechanisms. On the one hand, nanomedicines down-regulate the NF-kB
  signaling pathway, thereby reducing the production of ROS. On the other hand, nanomedicines
  up-regulate the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting TRPA1. These nanomedicines
  can down-regulate cartilage degradation factors and inflammatory factors such as
  MMP3, MMP-13, ADAMTS 5, COX-2, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, and up-regulate cartilage synthesis
  factors and anti-inflammatory factors such as collegen, IL-4 and IL-10, and finally
  inhibit inflammation, promote autophagy and delay cartilage degradation
