caption: Summary of estrogen, progesterone, FSH and GnRH associated growth pathways
  in polycystic liver disease. A, Pathways that are found in bile duct‐ligated rats
  and confirmed in human hepatic cyst cells. B, Receptors and associated pathways
  studied in human hepatic cyst cells only. C, Receptors and pathways studied in bile
  duct‐ligated rats only. The growth receptors IGF‐1, VEGF and EGFR are present on
  the cell membrane and induce proliferation. IGF‐1 receptor induces proliferation
  directly, but is also indirectly involved in estrogen‐induced proliferation. The
  ER‐α and ER‐β are thought to be a nuclear receptors that have genomic effects, but
  are also found as epithelial receptor in ADPKD hepatic cysts cells, and induce proliferation
  via non‐genomic pathways such as the Src‐Shc‐MAPKK‐ERK1/2 pathway and via Ca++.
  Next to the ER‐α and ER‐β receptor, a third estrogen receptor, the G‐coupled Protein
  Estrogen Receptor 1 (GPER‐1) is present on the cell membrane (work in progress from
  our own group). The EGFR is possibly activated by activation of the ER‐α and ER‐β
  as well as by the GPER‐1. The FSH receptor stimulates cell proliferation via cAMP
  related pathways. In bile duct‐ligated rats, GnRH receptors are found en GnRH induces
  proliferation. However, it is unclear whether this is a direct effect or most effects
  are related to enhanced production of other female hormones. Progesterone membrane
  receptors are present on the cell membrane (PGRMC1 and PGRMC2) and the nucleus (PRA
  and PRB)
