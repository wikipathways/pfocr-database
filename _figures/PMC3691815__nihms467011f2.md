caption: The view follows a tRNA through the selection process with defined steps
  indicated. The scheme is largely based on accumulated pre-steady state kinetic data
  (reviewed in ) from experiments performed in the absence of E-site tRNA. Predicted
  correlated FRET values are indicated at the top of each intermediate (). Green arrows
  indicate rates that are accelerated for cognate tRNA, whereas red arrows depict
  rates that are higher for near-cognate tRNA. We note that the occupancy and the
  role of the E-site tRNA following the codon-recognition intermediate is controversial
  and as such, the E-site tRNA is shown in a lighter color subsequent to this stage.
