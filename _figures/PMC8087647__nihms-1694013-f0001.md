caption: Canonical autophagy is normally induced in response to the cell undergoing
  an energy crisis. Autophagy-inducing signals, such as nutrient deprivation, trigger
  the activation of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), whose kinase activity
  simultaneously inhibits mTOR and activates the pre-initiation complex (unc-51-like
  kinase 1 (ULK1), autophagy-related protein 13 (ATG13), ATG101 and FAK family interacting
  protein of 200 kDa (FIP200)). This complex, in turn, phosphorylates components in
  the autophagy initiation complex composed of vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34),
  VPS15 and Beclin 1, along with ATG14 and AMBRA1. The initiation complex converts
  phosphoinositides in the endoplasmic reticulum to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate
  (PI3P), which recruits ligation machinery composed of the E1 ligase ATG7, the E2
  ligase ATG3 and a complex of ATG16L1 and an ATG5–ATG12 conjugate that together act
  as an E3 ligase. The ligase machinery functions to ligate lipidate microtubule-associated
  protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) family proteins to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)
  to form LC3–PE. The activity and coordination of the ATG5–ATG12 system and the LC3–PE
  system facilitate the curvature and sealing of the autophagosome, as well as the
  lipidation and embedding of LC3–PE into the autophagosomal membrane. The resulting
  autophagosomes then fuse to lysosomes (forming autolysosomes), resulting in digestion
  of the autophagosome contents loaded by the LC3 binding proteins. The non-canonical
  autophagy pathway also functions to lipidate LC3 family proteins on a single membrane.
  LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and LC3-associated endocytosis (LANDO) process
  independently of the autophagy pre-initiation (ULK1) complex, and utilize a different
  initiation complex composed of VPS34, VPS15, Beclin 1, UVRAG and Rubicon without
  requirements for ATG14 or AMBRA1. mTORC1, mTOR complex 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  TLR, Toll-like receptor; WIPI2, WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein
  2.
