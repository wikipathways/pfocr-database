caption: Schematic representation summarizing the intracellular events involved in
  the neurotrophic activities of PACAP on PC12 cells. PACAP induction of Egr1expression
  is required for neuritogenesis. This effect of PACAP proceeds through a cAMP/ERK-dependent,
  PKA-independent pathway. PACAP also increases cell size by inducing effectors such
  as villin 2. Finally, PACAP blocks cell proliferation in a partially PKA-dependent
  manner through transcription mechanisms that remain to be identified. AC, adenylate
  cyclase; DAG, diacyl glycerol; PLC, phospho-lipase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate
  13-acetate. Full arrow, established regulation; dotted arrow, assumed regulation.
