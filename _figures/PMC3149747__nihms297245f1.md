caption: Control of transcription and miRNA biogenesis by TGF-β/BMP signaling. At
  the core of this pathway, ligand binding to Type I/II heterodimeric receptors induces
  phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD transcription factors, which directly
  regulate the expression of protein-coding and miRNA genes. Mammalian SMAD proteins
  can also bind to the double-stranded stems of certain pri-miRNAs that bear CAGAC
  motifs, and promote their cleavage by the RNase III enzyme Drosha and its dsRBD
  partner DGCR8. This enhances the production of CAGAC-bearing pre-miRNAs, which are
  exported to the cytoplasm, cleaved by Dicer, and loaded into Argonaute (Ago) complexes
  to repress target genes.
