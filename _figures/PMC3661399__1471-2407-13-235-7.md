caption: Overview of selected AMPK and IGF-IR signalling pathways relevant to this
  study in normal (A) and hyperglycaemic (B) conditions. In normal conditions, metformin
  activates AMPKThr172 through the LKB1 signalling pathway. Activated AMPK inhibits
  cell growth by repressing mTOR activity through activation of TSC2 and phosphorylation
  of inhibitory serine residues on IRS-1. In addition, as demonstrated in the present
  study, metformin suppresses IGF-IR activation and reduces IRS-1 levels, which disable
  further signalling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. During hyperglycaemia, signalling
  through the IGF-IR pathway appears more robust, leading to phosphorylation of Akt
  and AMPKSer485. This inhibitory Ser485 site can inhibit activation of AMPKThr172,
  possibly contributing to the impaired growth inhibitory effect by metformin at high
  glucose conditions.
