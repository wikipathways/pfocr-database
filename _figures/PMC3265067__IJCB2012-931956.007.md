caption: 'Phospholipid biosynthetic pathways. PE is made by the CDP-ethanolamine pathway
  in the ER (left) or from PS via the action of PSD in mitochondria. PC is made by
  the CDP-choline pathway (right) or from PE through the PEMT pathway in the ER and
  mitochondria-associated membranes of the ER. PS is produced from PE and PC via PSS2
  and PSS1 pathways in the mitochondria associated membranes of the ER. Ethanolamine
  kinase: EthK; CTP: ethanolaminephosphate; cytidylyltransferase: ET; CDP: diacylglycerol
  ethanolamine and choline phosphotransferases: EPT and CPT; choline kinase: CK; CTP:

  phosphotransferases: CPT and EPT; Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase:
