caption: Several mechanisms contribute to impaired efferocytosis in cardiovascular
  diseases, such as atherosclerosis (Doran et al, ). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling
  through the TNF receptor activates the nuclear factor‐κB pathway leading to enhanced
  CD47 expression on apoptotic cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Enhanced expression
  of the “myocardial infarct‐associated transcript” (MIAT) long non‐coding RNA inhibits
  processing of the microRNA, miR‐149‐5p, and in turn, results in increased CD47 expression.
  CD47 can bind SIRPα in cis on the phagocyte surface to inhibit phagocytosis. Loss
  of pro‐phagocytic receptors on the phagocyte surface including LRP1 and MerTK contributes
  to impaired efferocytosis. Metalloproteinase ADAM17 cleaves MerTK, resulting in
  soluble Mer that may act to sequester growth arrest‐specific protein 6 (Gas6) needed
  for recognition of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of apoptotic cells. Parts
  of this figure were adapted from Doran et al ().
