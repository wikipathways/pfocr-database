caption: ER stress, protein misfolding, and oxidative stress are intimately interrelated.
  Protein folding within the ER lumen is ushered by a family of oxidoreductases that
  catalyze disulfide bond formation and isomerization. ER stress causes an increase
  in the formation of incorrect intermolecular and/or intramolecular disulfide bonds
  that require breakage and reformation for proteins to attain the appropriate folded
  conformation. PDI catalyzes disulfide bond formation and isomerization, whereas
  glutathione transported into the ER reduces improperly paired disulfide bonds. Reoxidation
  of PDI is mediated by ERO1; however, ROS are produced in the process. Cellular ROS
  can deplete glutathione and increase the misfolded protein load in the ER. In turn,
  ROS can also cause ER stress through modification of proteins and lipids that are
  necessary to maintain ER homeostasis. Consumption of excessive cellular glutathione
  due to ER stress could inhibit glutaredoxin reduction and cause accumulation of
  oxidized cytosolic proteins. ER stress also causes calcium leak from the ER for
  accumulation in the inner mitochondrial matrix. This calcium loading in the mitochondria
  can generate additional ROS through disruption of electron transport and opening
  of the mitochondrial permeability pore. Thus, accumulation of misfolded protein
  in the ER increases ROS production that can further amplify ER stress, disrupt insulin
  production, and cause cell death.
