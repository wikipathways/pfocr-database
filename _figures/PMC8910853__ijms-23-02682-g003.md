caption: The main regulatory mechanism of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) in certain
  OS-related physiological and pathological processes. ALDH2 activation inhibits the
  transformation of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) into myofibroblasts via the transforming
  growth factor-β1 (TGF-β)/Drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein (Smad)
  signaling pathway to inhibit fibrosis; ALDH2 inhibits mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways and upregulates the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2–associated
  X protein (Bax) ratio to reduce the cysteinyl aspartate–specific proteinase 3 (caspase-3)
  level and inhibit apoptosis; ALDH2 can also inactivate inhibit 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal
  (4-HNE) accumulation and regulate sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/p53-dependent aging; ALDH2 can
  eliminate the toxic metabolites of neurotransmitters (dopamine [DA], epinephrine
  [EPI], and norepinephrine [NE]) and can inhibit α-Synuclein (α-Syn) abnormal aggregation
  as well as Lewy bodies (LBs) formation, and reduce neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)
  formed by hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau, so as to protect
  neurons from the damage caused by 4-HNE and reactive oxygen species (ROS). (+) and
  (−) mainly reflect upregulation/activation or downregulation/inhibition, respectively,
  related to ALDH2 function. Red = plays a key role in the realization of corresponding
  physiological/pathological processes.
