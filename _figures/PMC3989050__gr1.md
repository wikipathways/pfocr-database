caption: Shown is a hypothetical example of a GPCR that is able to mediate three physiological
  responses via the coupling to three distinct signalling pathways. In the first example,
  ligand A is able to activate all three pathways with the same coupling efficiency
  as that seen for the natural ligand. In this case, ligand A shows no stimulus bias.
  In the second example, ligand B induces a receptor state that couples preferentially
  to Gq/11-protein, which drives calcium mobilisation and subsequent smooth muscle
  contraction. This ligand shows Gq/11-protein bias. In the final example, ligand
  C drives signalling primarily via the pERK pathway, which leads to cell growth.
  From a therapeutic perspective, it might be clinically beneficial to activate the
  Gq/11-protein pathway, whereas targeting the other two pathways might lead to toxicity
  or adverse drug affects. If this were the case, then a Gq/11-protein biased ligand
  (i.e. ligand B) might represent the desired pharmacological properties of a drug
  to deliver maximal clinical efficacy with lowest toxicity.
