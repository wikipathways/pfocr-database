caption: The ‘single biochemical mechanism for multiple physiological stressors’ model.
  The model shows how oxidative damage resulting from environmental stress occurs
  (in purple) and how volatile isoprenoids may exert protective effects through antioxidant
  activity (in green). Solid lines represent direct reactions, and broken lines represent
  indirect reactions. Environmental stress (high light, temperature, and ozone exposure)
  causes oxidative stress (Ox), which results in the production of ROS (for example,
  hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, and superoxide) and reactive nitrogen species
  (RNS; for example, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite). These compounds initiate cell signaling
  directly and also through interactions with the hormonal response network, as well
  as causing further direct oxidative damage. Different stresses trigger different
  response pathways. For example, ozone exposure also triggers a response that overlaps
  with biotic stress responses through the plant hormone network; salicylic acid (SA),
  jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) trigger signal cascades that initiate programmed
  cell death (PCD), resulting in accelerated senescence via an inappropriate hypersensitive
  response (HR). Isoprene may act at several different levels to arrest oxidative
  stress-response processes. (1) Because it is lipophilic, isoprene may physically
  stabilize hydrophobic interactions in membranes, minimizing lipid peroxidation and
  reducing oxidative stress and downstream buildup of ROS/RNS. (2) Isoprene may react
  with ROS/RNS to produce reactive electrophile species (RES) such as methacrolein
  and methylvinylketone (products of isoprene/ozone reaction), which are known to
  induce antioxidant and other defenses. If the stressor is itself an ROS (for example,
  ozone), isoprene may react directly with the stressor. (3) Direct antioxidant behavior
  (scavenging ROS/RNS) also prevents accumulation to damaging levels, thus preventing
  further oxidative damage. As a consequence, ROS/RNS-activated signal cascades and
  PCD pathways that normally result in tissue necrosis are prevented
