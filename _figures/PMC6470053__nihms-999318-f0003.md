caption: Shunt pathways (see text for details) are shown to branch from node compounds
  of the trunk pathway. P1-P6 in square brackets are proposed intermediates that may
  be too reactive to isolate, or not fully characterized. The names of the enzymes
  are those in M. ruber M7. This figure was adapted from Chen et al., Chem. Sci.,
  2017, 8, 4917–4925 – published by The Royal Society of Chemistry - with some modification.
