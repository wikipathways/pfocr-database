caption: Proposed scheme for the signaling pathway of TNF-α leading to stress fiber
  formation. The figure illustrates how ceramide formation can contribute to the signaling
  pathways whereby TNF-α induces the formation of stress fibers. The ceramide-mediated
  pathway depends upon the formation of Ras-GTP and the activations of PI 3-K and
  SK. In addition, TNF-α also induces the tyrosine phosphorylations of FAK and paxillin
  and stress fiber formation independently of the activation of Ras and PI 3-K.
