caption: The BMP signaling pathway. Binding of the ligand to the type II receptor
  recruits the type I receptor and activates Smad 1/5/8 by phosphorylation. The later
  engages Smad4, which is shared with the TGFb pathway, and the complex translocates
  to the nucleus to regulate transcription of target genes (e.g. Id). The pathway
  is blocked by several inhibitors (e.g. Noggin) as well as the inhibitory Smad6.
