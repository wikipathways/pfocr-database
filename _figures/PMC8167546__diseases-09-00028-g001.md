caption: Schematic representation of the basic types of blood capillaries in cancer
  and healthy organs and tissues. Organelles and routes potentially involved in the
  transendothelial transport of small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
  (RTKIs) bound to plasma albumin. (A). Tumor capillary. Effective and efficient transport
  of RTKI-albumin conjugates by diffusion via large transendothelial channels (tch,
  pathway 3) and open junctions (pathway 5) towards interstitial space of cancer tissues.
  By contrast, the actual participation of tight junctions (pathway 1), caveolae (pathway
  2), fenestrae (pathway 4), and vesiculo-vacuolar organelles (pathway 6) in the transport
  of anti-angiogenic agents from plasma to the subendothelial space in tumors should
  be very limited. (B). Continuous capillary. Caveolar transport (pathway 2)—possibly
  the main transport mechanism of RTKIs bound to albumin mediated by albumin-binding
  proteins (ABPs) in continuous capillary endothelia of normal organs and tissues
  (e.g., skeletal and cardiac muscles, in fat tissue, connective tissue, arterial
  capillaries of the lung, and in the skin). (C). Fenestrated capillary. Caveolar
  fluid phase transport (pathway 2; possibly the main transport mechanism of RTKI-albumin
  conjugates and anti-angiogenic antibodies in fenestrated capillary endothelia of
  normal organs and tissues). The transport through the diaphragmed fenestrae (pathway
  4) should make a minor contribution to the transport of anti-angiogenics due to
  their negative charges (e.g., fenestrated capillaries in healthy kidney, digestive
  tract mucosa, and all endocrine glands). (D). Discontinuous capillary. Diffusion
  through the endothelial gaps (pathway 8; effective and efficient transport but only
  in liver, spleen, and bone marrow), highly dependent on the concentration of both
  RTKIs and anti-angiogenic antibodies in blood. The red diamonds represent the angiogenic
  receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) exposed on the abluminal (tissue) front of capillary
  endothelia. In tumor capillaries, the angiogenic RTKs (the targets of anti-angiogenic
  agents) are overexpressed. The green dots represent albumin-binding sites (ABPs)
  associated with caveolae in healthy continuous capillaries. bm, basal membrane;
