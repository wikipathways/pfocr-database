caption: 'Changes in utilization of glycolytic substrates and intermediates in untreated
  rabbit cardiac myocytes, and cardiomyocytes exposed to simulated I/R in the absence
  or presence of 50 μM PK11195. (A) Schematic representation of the intermediates
  of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, glycogenolysis, and the gluconeogenesis
  pathway. GL/FFA cycle, glycerolipid/free fatty acid cycle; LPA, lysophosphatidic
  acid; 3GPP, glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway, PDH,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase. (B) Shown are changes in utilization of the intermediates
  involved in glycolysis, pentose phosphate, glycogenolysis, and the gluconeogenesis
  pathways measured with Biolog MitoPlates. Control rabbit cardiomyocytes were exposed
  to 20 min of simulated ischemia and then exposed to simulated reperfusion in the
  absence or presence of 50 μM PK11195. Data presented as mean ± SEM obtained from
  three different animals per each group. *p < 0.05 reflects a significant difference
  in intermediate utilization between control cardiomyocytes and cardiomyocytes exposed
  to simulated I/R; #p < 0.05 reflects a significance between PK11195 treated cardiomyocytes
  subjected to simulated I/R vs. cardiomyocytes exposed to I/R in the absence of PK11195.
  There was no difference between control and PK11195 at reperfusion groups.'
