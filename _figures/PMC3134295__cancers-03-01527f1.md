caption: 'The Apoptotic Process. There are two major apoptotic signaling pathways:
  the extrinsic pathway and the mitochondria (intrinsic) pathway. In addition, there
  is another pathway that involves T-cell mediated cytotoxicity and perforin-granzyme-dependent
  killing of the cell. The mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway is regulated by Bcl-2
  family and activated by mitochondrial disruption with subsequent cytochrome c release.
  Initiators of this pathway include UV irradiation and cytotoxic drugs. An ‘apoptosome’
  is formed by the interaction of cytochrome c, Apaf-1, d-ATP/ ATP and procaspase-9
  with subsequent initiation of the caspase cascade.'
