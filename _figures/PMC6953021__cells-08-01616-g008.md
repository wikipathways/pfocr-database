caption: 'Biochemical pathways and molecular mechanisms of high glucose toxicity in
  Caco-2 cells and potential PON2 involvement in intracellular ROS formation and apoptosis.
  High glucose concentration can promote ROS accumulation through different metabolic
  pathways: glucose autoxidation, increased flux of glucose through the polyol pathway,
  AGEs formation, and decrease of cell antioxidant defenses. The decrease of PON2
  expression and activity induced by glyco-oxidative stress may contribute to the
  intracellular ROS formation, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation and consequent
  activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.'
