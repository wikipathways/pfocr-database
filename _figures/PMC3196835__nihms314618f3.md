caption: A model for persistent and injury- or degeneration-induced neurogenesis in
  the zebrafish central retina. In a wild-type, uninjured retina, slowly dividing
  stem cells in the INL (orange), which are derived from neurogenic M端ller glia, give
  rise to committed rod progenitor cells in the INL (green, pathway A). The INL progenitors
  migrate to the ONL where they are further amplified as rod precursors (purple) and
  differentiate into mature rods (red). In response to rod photoreceptor degeneration
  alone, the rod precursors of pathway A increase their proliferation in the absence
  of proliferation in the INL. In response to degeneration of the cone photoreceptors,
  damage to both rods and cones, or death of other inner retinal neurons, M端ller glia
  re-enter the cell cycle to produce neurogenic clusters (green, pathway B) in the
  INL that migrate to the correct laminar position and differentiate into multiple
  retinal cell types (red). CGZ, circumferential germinal zone; ONL, outer nuclear
  layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; GCL, ganglion cell layer. Modified from () with
