caption: The specificity of HDACis for HDAC isoforms has been recently reclassified
  using sophisticated chemoproteomics and chemical phylogenetic approaches, revealing
  that HDACis have surprising affinity for both HDACs and individual HDAC-dependent
  multiprotein complexes (, ). This new specificity is shown for class I HDAC1, -2,
  -3, and -8 as well as class IIb HDAC6 and -10; specificity is calculated from average
  KDapp values generated by Bantscheff et al. and Bradner et al. (, ). Illustration
  based on data from Deubzer et al. (), Bolden et al. (), Bantscheff et al. (), and
  Bradner et al. (). BHC80, BRAF35-HDAC complex protein; CHD4, chromodomain helicase
  DNA binding protein 4; CoREST, REST corepressor 1; LSD1, lysine-specific demethylase
  1; MTA, metastasis-associated protein; MBD, methyl-CpG binding domain protein; NuRD,
  nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase; RbAp46, retinoblastoma-binding protein p46;
  Sap30, Sin3A-associated protein, 30 kDa; SDS, serine dehydratase; TBL1X, transducin
  β-like 1X-linked; TBL1XR1, transducin β-like 1 X-linked receptor 1; GPS2, G protein
  pathway suppressor 2.
