caption: The AKt pathway mediates ischemia preconditioning. Exposure of the cells
  to brief intermittent episodes of hypoxia or ischemia elicits an adaptive preconditioning
  effect. One of the main signaling pathways that mediate this effect is the AKt pathway,
  which in this context is activated by adenosine, a byproduct of ATP hydrolysis.
  Stimulation of the cells with insulin can have a similar preconditioning effect.
  Activation of AKt triggers immediate signaling through posttranscriptional modifications
  that are responsible for early preconditioning. These include phosphorylation and
  inhibition of Bad and glycogen synthase kinase 3β GSK3β induction of enodothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and activation of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε).
  In addition, AKT induces rapid upregulation of miR-21, which targets and inhibits
  Fas ligand (FasL), phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN),
  and programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) that are induced during protracted hypoxia.
  Conversely, AKT induces prompt downregulation of mir-199a-5p, thus, derepressing
  its targets, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (Hif-1α) and Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), where
  Sirt1 is required of Hif-1α stability. Finally, These signaling events coordinate
  to protect mitochondrial damage by inhibiting the formation of mitochondrial outer
  membrane pores (MOMP) and leakiness of mitochondrial permeability transition pores
  (MPTP).
