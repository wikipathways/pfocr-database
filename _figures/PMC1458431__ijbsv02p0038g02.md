caption: Synthesis, degradation and mode of action of retinoic acid (RA). A) The metabolic
  pathway for synthesis and degradation of endogenous RA is shown. RA is synthesized
  by oxidation of retinal by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs). In a reversible
  reaction, retinal is synthesized from retinol (vitamin A) by either aldehyde dehydrogenases
  (ADHs) or short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (RDHs/SDRs). Cellular retinol binding
  proteins (CRBPs) can bind retinol, whereas cellular retinoic acid binding proteins
  (CRABPs) can bind RA. Finally, endogenous RA is degraded by CYP26 enzymes. B) The
  RAR/RXR heterodimer mediates the effects of RA. In the absence of ligand (RA), the
  RAR/RXR heterodimer is bound to DNA and co-repressors. This complex induces transcriptional
  repression through histone deacetylation. Binding of the ligand (RA) induces conformational
  changes and the binding of co-activators leading to histone acetylation and activation
  of transcription.

  description: Synthesis, degradation and mode of action of retinoic acid (RA). A)
    The metabolic pathway for synthesis and degradation of endogenous RA is shown.
    RA is synthesized by oxidation of retinal by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs).
    In a reversible reaction, retinal is synthesized from retinol (vitamin A) by either
    aldehyde dehydrogenases (ADHs) or short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (RDHs/SDRs).
    Cellular retinol binding proteins (CRBPs) can bind retinol, whereas cellular retinoic
    acid binding proteins (CRABPs) can bind RA. Finally, endogenous RA is degraded
    by CYP26 enzymes. B) The RAR/RXR heterodimer mediates the effects of RA. In the
    absence of ligand (RA), the RAR/RXR heterodimer is bound to DNA and co-repressors.
    This complex induces transcriptional repression through histone deacetylation.
    Binding of the ligand (RA) induces conformational changes and the binding of co-activators
    leading to histone acetylation and activation of transcription.
