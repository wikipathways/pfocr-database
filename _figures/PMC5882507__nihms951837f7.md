caption: 'Acetyl choline binds to muscarinic type 3 receptor (M3R) in the vascular
  endothelial cell to activate PLC-IP3-DAG pathway increasing [Ca2+]i which then activates
  eNOS and COX to release NO and PGI2, respectively. Subsequently, NO and PGI2 diffuse
  to the adjacent SMC where they interact with sGC and IP, thus increasing cytosolic
  cGMP and cAMP, the mediators of vasorelaxation. MEGJ, the channels allowing for
  the electrical and metabolic coupling between EC and SMC are formed by oligomerization
  of hexameric connexin to form connexon or hemichannel (HC). Acidosis augments the
  vasorelaxation by (i) activating eNOS-cGMP, (ii) stimulating COX-2-PGI2, (iii) opening
  up the connexon and hemichannels, and (iv) increasing the expression of connexins.
