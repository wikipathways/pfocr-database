caption: The schematic shows common upstream signaling mediators and the major signaling
  pathways transducing pro-inflammatory signals in smooth muscles Conserved kinase
  cascades (JAK/Stat, NFκβ, ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and JNK1/2) have been described in all
  smooth muscles that regulate pro-inflammatory as well as miRNA gene expression.
  Some important pro-inflammatory gene products are listed as autocrine and paracrine
  mediators of vascular and airway inflammation and remodeling.
