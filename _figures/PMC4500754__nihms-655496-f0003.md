caption: 'Maternal diabetes-induced oxidative stress alters glucose metabolic pathways.
  During glycolysis, glucose is converted into fructose-6-phosphate with the help
  of phosphoglucose isomerase, and then further converted to fructose-1,6-biosphosphate
  by phosphofructolinase. Under maternal hyperglycemic condition, increased glycolytic
  flux in the embryo can stimulate flux through the HBP pathway. The fructose-6-phosphate
  will be transformed to glusamine-6-phosphte or glutamate, during which process,
  oxidative stress will be further enhanced. HBP: hexosamine biosynthetic pathway.'
