caption: Illustration of differences in the expression of genes for early steps of
  sphingolipid metabolism using a KEGG-based microarray analysis tool (GenMapp v2.1)
  that has been modified to display this pathway more completely (www.sphingomap.org).
  The sphingolipid metabolites and genes (with the gene abbreviations shown in boxes,
  or enzyme names where gene names are ambiguous) are given for the condensation of
  serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine (3-ketoSa) by serine palmitoyltransferase,
  which is reduced to sphinganine (Sa), acylated to dihydroceramides, DHCer, by (DH)Cer
  synthases, and incorporated into more complex DH-sphingolipids (the 1-phosphate,
  DHCerP, sphingomyelins, DHSM, glucosylceramides, DHGlcCer, galactosylceramides,
  DHGalCer, lactosylceramides, DHLacCer, and sulfatides, or desaturated to Cer followed
  by headgroup addition. Also included are a number of the catabolic genes, e.g.,
  sphingomyelinases, SMases, ceramidases, ASAH, sphingosine kinases, for the formation
  of sphinganine 1-phosphate (Sa1P) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (So1P), and phosphatases
  for the reverse reaction and the lyase that cleaves sphingoid base 1-phosphates
  to ethanolamine phosphate (EP), hexadecanal (C16:0al) and hexadecenal (C16:1al).
  For the purpose of illustration, the coloration is for the log2-fold difference
  in expression of these genes from a published microarray study () invasive lobular
  carcinoma cells versus normal lobular cells.
