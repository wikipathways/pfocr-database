caption: Proposed model of mechanism by which inhibition of PKA phosphorylation of
  RyR2 prevents intracellular Ca2+ leak in heart failure. (Left) The cardiac ryanodine
  receptor exists in clusters of tetrameric calcium-release channels located on the
  SR membrane. Each RyR2 monomer contains one PKA phosphorylation site Ser-2808 (S)
  and binds one PKA enzyme complex (in the cartoon, only one PKA complex is shown
  per tetrameric channel). (Middle) During heart failure, persistent activation of
  the fight-or-flight stress response causes chronic activation of the β-adrenergic
  signaling pathway and PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 (stars depict posttranslational
  modification by PO4 molecules). Chronic PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 is associated
  with calstabin2 depletion of the channel complex (symbolized by dissociation of
  octagons from RyR2). (Right) In RyR2-S2808A mice, substitution of Ser-2808 by Ala
  prevents RyR2 PKA hyperphosphorylation and SR Ca2+ leak that has beneficial effects,
  including reduced maladaptive remodeling after MI.
