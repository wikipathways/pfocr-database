caption: PKC activation induces TNFα production in cells sensitizing them to SMs.
  As reported by others, SM inhibits cIAP1 and cIAP2 leading to a redirection via
  RIP1 of the TNFR1 signaling towards apoptosis. In addition, SM-mediated cIAP1/2
  inhibition leads to accumulation of NIK, propagation of the noncanonical signaling
  pathway and TNFα production in SM-sensitive cell lines. However, as the authors
  report this may not be the sole pathway by which SM mediates TNFα production in
  SM-sensitive cell lines, other yet unidentified pathways may also contribute to
  TNFα production. In addition, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) that activates
  PKC initiates canonical NF-κB signaling resulting in increased autocrine TNFα production
  and sensitizes insensitive cell lines to SM
