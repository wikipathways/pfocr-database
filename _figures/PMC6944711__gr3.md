caption: Functional intersection of the GPCR-senescence system. (A) Using the BioGrid
  database (https://thebiogrid.org/) the interacting proteins of several GPCR associated
  proteins were extracted and assembled into one GPCR-system protein list (red). A
  cellular senescence associated protein list (blue) was generated using the Reactome
  Pathway database (https://reactome.org/). (B) Here we show the number of overlapping
  proteins between the GPCR-system protein (red) list and the cellular senescence
  associated protein lists (blue). (C) The distribution of the 26 GPCR-senescence
  overlapping proteins originating from the different GPCR-associated factors are
  visualized in the donut plot. (D) Next, Enrichr (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/)
  was used to perform pathway analysis of these 26 overlapping proteins, showing cellular
  senescence as the most enriched pathway in this dataset. Probability (P)-values
  for each significantly populated signaling pathway are shown in the parentheses.
  (E) The proteins common to GPCR-associated proteins and cellular senescence were
  used for further analysis using Textrous! (https://textrous.irp.nia.nih.gov/), which
  employs latent semantic indexing to achieve a highly data-dependent unbiased appreciation
  of our data. The biomedical terms semantically associated with the 26-protein input
  dataset are organized into an agglomerative hierarchical cloud in which the strongest
  associations are denoted by increased font size and green-to-red color intensity.
  (F) Lastly we assessed the potential physical relationship with the NetworkAnalyst
  platform (https://www.networkanalyst.ca/). This platform uses protein-protein interaction
  analysis by using data extracted from the IMEx consortium (The International Molecular
  Exchange Consortium) consortium (https://www.imexconsortium.org/). A generic, zero-order,
  network was created using the 26 overlapping proteins. This data shows that the
  network is centered upon ubiquitin C (UBC) and is furthermore strongly associated
  with TRAF6-associated SASP functionality. (For interpretation of the references
  to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
