caption: The gene association networks that result from entering the list of eight
  genes—PIK3CG, PTGS2, FOS, PTPRC, VAV1, ITPR3, NFATC2, and PIK3R2—as input into the
  GeneMANIA software. GeneMANIA extends the user’s list with genes that are functionally
  similar, or share properties with the initial query genes, and displays an interactive
  functional association network, illustrating the relationships among these genes
  and datasets. The size of each node is proportional to the number of physical interactions
  (pink edges) among other genes and indicates the importance of this gene as a hub
  in the network. Genes that are co-expressed are shown by light violet edges, and
  pathways involving related nodes are indicated by cyan edges
