caption: Classical pathway of complement activation by antibody. After the first component
  of complement (C1) binds to Fc portions of closely spaced antibodies, it splits
  C4 into C4a and C4b. C4b can bind covalently to proteins or carbohydrates on cell
  membranes. C2 associates with C4b and is split by C1. The complex of C2a and C3b
  is called the C3 convertase because it is capable of cleaving C3 into C3a and C3b.
  C3b, like C4b, can bind covalently to cell membranes. C3b associated with C4bC2a
  forms a C5 convertase that splits C5 into C5a and C5b. Neutrophils and macrophages
  have receptors for most of these split products (C4b, C3b, iC3b, C3a, C5a as well
  as the Fc segment of antibodies). C5b initiates the assembly of the terminal complement
  components (C6, C7, C8 and C9) into a pore-forming structure, the membrane attack
  complex (MAC), that can insert into a cell membrane. This cascade is regulated at
  several steps, especially at the C3 and C5 convertases, by membrane bound and soluble
  regulatory molecules. For example, decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55) is a membrane
  protein that accelerates the dissociation of the convertases. This limits the amount
  of C3b bound to the surface of cells. Membrane co-factor protein (MCP; CD46) is
  a transmembrane glycoprotein that acts as a cofactor for soluble factor I to cleave
  C4b and C3b into enzymatically inactive iC4b and iC3b and then C4d and C3d, respectively.
