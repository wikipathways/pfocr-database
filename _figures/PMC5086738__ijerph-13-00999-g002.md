caption: The canonical NF-κB pathway. Pro-inflammatory cytokines or stressors activate
  a cell receptor (e.g., Toll-like receptors or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)). This
  cause activation of Iκκβ, which attaches to regulatory proteins like RELA (NF-κB
  p65 subunit), resulting in the formation of dimers. Iκκβ is activated and transforms
  into IκB. IκB is then phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and then degraded. This causes
  the release of the dimers attached to it (e.g., p50-RELA heterodimer). The dimers
  are trans-located to the nucleus and bind to NF-κB responsive genes and induce transcription
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This figure was constructed based on information
  provided in [,,]. NEMO = NF-κB essential modulator.
