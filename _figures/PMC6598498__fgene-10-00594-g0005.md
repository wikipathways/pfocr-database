caption: Citrate cycle (TCA Cycle) metabolic pathway from KEGG database (Kanehisa
  and Goto, ). Each metabolite, represented by the circles, is partitioned in five
  columns, in which each one represents one of the organs, leaf (L), culm (C), prop
  root (PR), root (R), and grains (G), from the left to right, as shown in the highlighted
  node of 2-Oxoglutarate (AKG) at the right of the figure. The color of the columns
  represents the degree centrality value of that metabolite in the organ network.
  The values of degree centrality in this figure vary from 0 to 10.9.
