caption: Proposed pathway of cAMP signaling after FID addition during in vitro maturation.
  Primarily, FID incited PKA, which collaborated closely with calcium and ERK1/2 pathways.
  PKA upregulated cholecystokinin (CCK) and putatively increased the intracellular
  calcium pool. Calcium was involved in the regulation of genes implicated in glucose
  metabolism and steroidogenesis. In parallel, PKA inhibited cumulus expansion genes
  through the ERK1/2 pathway with concomitant stimulation of their expression via
  MAPK14 (p38). (?) PKA regulated DUSP1 transcripts, suggesting its possible implication
  in ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
