caption: Construction of miRNA-gene regulatory networks in rat fatty liver associated
  PNF cases. We performed genomics in healthy allografts and fatty allografts associated
  PNF cases. Shown are miRNA-gene networks in failing livers following fatty allograft
  transplantation. A Regulation of transcription factors and transcriptional repressors.
  B Regulation of miRNA-gene networks. Shown are Cytoscape visualized networks of
  autophagy. C Apoptotic signaling pathway. D Response to endoplasmic reticulum stress.
  E Response to hypoxia. F Mitochondrial organization. G Response to cytokines
