caption: The pathogenesis of EGFR-mutant lung cancer (yellow), prostate cancer (blue),
  and bladder cancer (gray) all initially require and are dependent on a specific
  oncoprotein (EGFR for lung cancer, AR for prostate cancer, and sometimes ERBB2 for
  bladder cancer) for maintenance of tumorigenesis. Acquisition of the small cell
  neuroendocrine state requires RB1 and TP53 loss at which time EGFR and AR expression
  is downregulated. Although it is not known whether oncogenic drivers in bladder
  cancer are downregulated upon transdifferentiation to small cell carcinoma, we hypothesize
  that this occurs as a consequence of the small cell neuroendocrine state, but this
  hypothesis needs to be formally tested.
