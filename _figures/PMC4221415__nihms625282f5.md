caption: 'Depicted are all proteins identified by drug affinity chromatography after
  background subtraction (as described for ) supplemented with all phosphoproteins
  identified by phosphoproteomics. Protein-protein interactions between observed proteins
  were retrieved from public databases. Each phosphosite is indicated as a red circle
  around the respective protein node. Red protein nodes indicate proteins that are
  (at least in part) of “mouse” origin in the respective xenograft samples and thus
  may originate from the tumor microenvironment, grey nodes indicate proteins never
  observed with any mouse-specific peptides. Dark blue pie slices: proteins involved
  in the MAPK signaling pathway, light blue pie slices: proteins involved in the integrin
  signaling pathway.'
