caption: Mechanism and signaling pathways of the inhibitory effects of HST on the
  proliferation of LUSC cells. HST inhibited the proliferation of LUSC cells by inducing
  G2/M phase arrest, suppressing the Notch1 signaling pathway to induce ER stress,
  and ultimately leading to apoptosis of LUSC cells. This figure was drawn using Figdraw
  (https://www.figdraw.com/). C-Casp3, cleaved capase-3; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  Grp78, glucose-regulated protein 78; HST, hesperetin; LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma
