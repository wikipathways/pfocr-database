caption: Schematic diagrams depicting the Wnt signaling pathways. The canonical Wnt
  signaling pathway (left 2) and planar cell polarity pathway (right) are shown. Wnts,
  represented by yellow circles represent a large family of signaling molecules. In
  general, Wnts 1, 3a, 8 and 8b induce the canonical Wnt signaling pathway while Wnts
  5a and 11 favor the non-canonical pathway; however, significant cross talk between
  these pathways has been observed. There are a number of other Wnt signaling pathways
  that have not been described here as their role in skin appendages is yet to be
  established. More detailed views are presented elsewhere.,
