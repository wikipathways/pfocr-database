caption: 'Targetable cell survival mechanisms.Notes: Stimulation of the BCR and its
  co-receptor CD19 results in downstream signaling via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
  LYN and SYK are recruited to the engaged BCR, where they are activated by phosphorylation
  and initiate the cascade. PI3K recruitment occurs through mechanisms including BCAR.
  Activation proceeds via AKT to mTOR, GSK-3 and NF-κB. Additionally, stimulation
  along BTK results in further NF-κB activity. Ultimately, stimulation along the P13K/AKT/mTOR
  pathways results in increased cell survival, proliferation, metabolism, migration
  and chemokine secretion. Inhibition of PI3K acts to overt these mechanisms.Abbreviation:
  BCR, B-cell receptor.'
