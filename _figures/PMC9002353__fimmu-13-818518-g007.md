caption: Schematic representation of a proposed mechanism of CCL5 release involving
  activation of the mTOR pathway. In our study, mTOR signaling is activated in ASD
  patients. Phosphorylated mTOR at serine residue 2448 down-regulates the phosphorylation
  of GSK-3β at Ser9, and contributes to the reduction in phosphorylation of CREB at
  Ser133, which leads to the decreased binding of CREB to CREBBP. Thereby more available
  CREBBP could bind with NF-κB, which promotes the CCL5 production. The up-regulation
  and down-regulation of the component involved in the signaling pathway are indicated
  with an up arrow (red) and a down arrow (blue), respectively.
