caption: Schematic diagrams describing the regulation of inflammation by UBR box N-recognins.
  (A) A model depicting LT-induced mNLRPB inflammasome activation by UBR2/4. The anthrax
  lethal factor (LF) is known to induce mNLRP1B inflammasome activation and pyroptosis.
  Although the detailed mechanism of LT-induced mNLRP1B inflammasome activation has
  not been elucidated, it has recently been shown that the Arg/N-degron pathway is
  involved in mNLRP1B inflammasome activation. LF directly cleaves mNLRP1B to generate
  an N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal fragment. Despite cleavage into N-terminal
  and C-terminal fragments by LF, mNLRP1B remains autoinhibited. To activate the inflammasome,
  the N-terminal fragment of mNLRP1B is degraded in an Arg/N-degron pathway-dependent
  manner by UBR2 and UBR4, as identified through CRISPR-Cas9 screening. This process
  releases the CARD domain-containing C-terminal fragment of mNLRP1B and induces pyroptosis
  through interaction with caspase-1. (B) A model depicting the degradation of proinflammatory
  fragments mediated by UBR1/2/4/5. Potential proinflammatory Arg/N-degron substrates
  are generated by activated inflammatory caspases and several other proteases under
  inflammatory stimuli such as LPS. The resulting N-degron substrates Cys-RAB39a,
  Asn-CASP1, Gln-CASP4, CASP5, Ile-GRZA, and Ile-GRZM are generated by activated caspases,
  autoprocessing, or by endopeptidases such as DPP1. These fragments, which can cause
  an inflammatory response, expose destabilizing residues at the N-terminus. These
  fragments are recognized by N-recognins and then degraded through 26S proteasome,
  as evidenced by the depletion of UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, and UBR5, causing a significant
  reduction in LPS-induced IL-1β secretion.
