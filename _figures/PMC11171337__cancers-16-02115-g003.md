caption: The significance of phospholipid acyltransferases for cancer cells. Phospholipid
  acyltransferases are enzymes in the synthesis pathway of phospholipids and TAG.
  The increased activity of certain phospholipid acyltransferases (GPAM, GPAT3, GPAT4,
  AGPAT2, and MBOAT7) boosts TAG production. After synthesis, TAG form lipid droplets.
  These enzymes (LPCAT1, LPCAT2, and MBOAT7) can also indirectly influence lipid droplet
  biogenesis. Lipid droplets are involved in chemoresistance, as they can accumulate
  lipophilic substances, including many anticancer drugs; consequently, these drugs
  are not present in the organelles where they exhibit anticancer effects. Lipid droplets
  also bind calreticulin, preventing this protein from being found in the cell membrane.
  When cancer cells die due to anticancer drugs, calreticulin from the cell membrane
  activates cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Reduced calreticulin in the cell membrane disrupts
  this mechanism. Glycerophospholipids are also involved in cancer processes as structural
  elements of cells. Therefore, cancer cells, which divide frequently, must exhibit
  increased glycerophospholipid synthesis, hence the activity of phospholipid acyltransferases.
  Some phospholipid acyltransferases incorporate PUFAs into glycerophospholipids (AGPAT3,
  AGPAT4, AGPAT5, LPCAT3, and LPCAT4). However, not all acyltransferases in the Lands
  cycle incorporate PUFAs into phospholipids. For example, LPCAT1, MBOAT1, and MBOAT2
  incorporate oleic acid into the sn-2 position of phospholipids. Phospholipids can
  contain arachidonic acid, which can be released by PLA2 and processed into PGE2
  by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). This bioactive lipid is involved in cancer processes.
  Phospholipids containing PUFAs can also undergo peroxidation. Therefore, increased
  activity of phospholipid acyltransferases, which modify the fatty acid composition
  in phospholipids, changes the susceptibility of cancer cells to ferroptosis. Phospholipid
  acyltransferases affect cancer cell metabolism, increasing cholesterol production
  through the Wnt pathway. Cholesterol and PUFA-containing phospholipids form lipid
  rafts, influencing membrane receptors that require lipid rafts for their activity,
  such as EGFR. Thus, phospholipid acyltransferases, by directly producing PUFA-containing
  phospholipids and indirectly increasing cholesterol synthesis, enhance EGFR activation
  and weaken the effect of EGFR inhibitors. This is a mechanism of chemoresistance
  against EGFR inhibitors
