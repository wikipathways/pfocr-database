caption: The interaction cycle of ICI therapy and ferroptosis. Activated CD8 T cells
  with anti-PD-L1 therapy release IFN-γ, which downregulates the expression of SLC3A2
  and SLC7A11 via the IFN-γ-JAK1-STAT1 pathway and promotes cancer cell ferroptosis.
  Meanwhile, activated CD8 T cell mediates apoptosis of target cancer cell via Fas-FasL
  pathway or granzyme B-perforin pathway. The apoptotic cell expresses receptor tyrosine
  kinase TYRO3 on its membrane. Once TYRO3 binds to Pros1 or Gas6 expressed on apoptotic
  blebs, TYRO3-PI3K-AKT pathway is activated, which leads to upregulation of pro-ferroptosis
  genes such as SLC3A2 and GPX4, inhibition of cancer cell ferroptosis, and cancer
  cells resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Ferroptotic cancer cells are with immunogenicity,
  and they release DAMPs such ATP, DNA, HMGB and so on, which promote DC maturation,
  a critical link of cancer-immunity cycle, and finally explaining that ferroptosis
  helps ICI therapy. IFN-γ, interferon-γ; JAK1, Janus-activated kinase 1; STAT1, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 1; Pros1, Protein S1; Gas6, growth-arrest-specific
  6; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; HMGB,
  high mobility group protein B; DC, dendritic cell; PD-L1, programmed cell death
  1; PD-L1, programmed cell death ligand 1.
