caption: The ketogenic diet has shown a decrease in seizures through the production
  of ketone bodies that cause an effect on neuronal function and the release of neurotransmitters,
  such as a decrease of glutamate, and adenosine, mitochondrial function, increase
  of GABA synthesis, and KATP channels. Caloric restriction may inhibit glycolysis
  and, just like the ketogenic diet, is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, decreased
  oxidative stress, and decreasing inflammation, but it appears that it does not have
  an ionic gradient effect on KATP channels. The ketogenic diet and caloric restriction
  per se down-regulated and up-regulated some genes involved in seizure activity.
