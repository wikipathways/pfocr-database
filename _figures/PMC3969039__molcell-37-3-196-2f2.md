caption: Putative model of the mechanism of vascular homeostasis mediated by apelin-APJ
  signaling. (A) Basal apelin-APJ signaling maintains expression of miR-424/503, KLF2,
  and eNOS, as well as activity of AMPK. miR-424/503 in turn inhibits FGF2/FGFR1 expression,
  and eNOS induces the production of NO. (B) In PAH, there is decreased apelin, miR-424/503
  and eNOS expression, leading to abnormal activation of FGF signaling pathway and
  reducing NO level that target both the PAECs and PASMCs.
