caption: 'Schematic overview of the effects of (interacting) gestational factors on
  5-HT levels during the embryonic period. Gestational factors (i.e., maternal 5-HT-ergic
  genotype, 5-HT-related diets, stress exposure, 5-HT-ergic medication intake, and
  immune activation) decrease (top arrow blue, left) or increase (top arrow red, right)
  embryonic brain 5-HT levels. The gestational factors in the middle (purple) have
  been found to increase as well as decrease brain 5-HT levels in the embryo. Gestational
  factors do not only independently affect the embryonic brain 5-HT system but are
  also able to interact and thereby amplify or counteract each other’s impact on the
  embryonic brain 5-HT system. Maternal genotype is able to influence the effects
  of maternal diet composition, stress, and medication intake. The maternal immune
  system is activated by bacteria, viruses, and pre-eclampsia (blue dot) and is influenced
  by maternal stress and diet composition. Furthermore, the risk of pre-eclampsia
  is influenced by maternal medication intake and diet composition. Gestational factor
  influences on the embryonic brain 5-HT system are a consequence of changes in placenta-derived
  (maternal blood or placenta) and/or offspring’s raphe-produced (hindbrain) 5-HT
  content. Factors can influence maternal tryptophan levels, which influence tryptophan
  transfer to the embryo and placental 5-HT synthesis (green arrows). In turn, placental
  5-HT synthesis alterations influence the transfer of 5-HT to the embryo (yellow
  arrows). Maternal 5-HT levels can influence placental 5-HT levels and transfer to
  the embryo as well (orange arrows). It should be mentioned that the placenta also
  express MAOA and the 5-HT2A receptor, which can breakdown the supplied/synthesized
  5-HT and affect the placental structure and function, respectively. Gestational
  factors can influence the placental 5-HT system by targeting TPH1/2, MAOA, 5-HTT,
  and/or the 5-HT2A receptor. Some of these factors also influence the embryonic brain
  5-HT system. These direct effects are evident in the fore- and hindbrain and include
  fetal 5-HT-ergic genotype, the placental transfer from 5-HT-ergic medications, activation
  of the embryonic immune system, and alterations in the raphe-produced 5-HT content
  due to maternal stress (placental CORT transfer) and maternal diet. These factors
  can influence the maternal and placental pathway at multiple levels: altering maternal
  tryptophan and 5-HT levels, placental 5-HT synthesis, or the placental transfer
  from tryptophan and 5-HT to the fetus.'
