  acid) regulatory genes that are significantly altered by ANRIL knockdown in HEK
  cells.Genes that metabolize these lipids are shown. Full data on their transcriptional
  regulation is provided in Table , Tab VII in the Data Supplement. LCAT was not significantly
  regulated but is shown for completeness.
