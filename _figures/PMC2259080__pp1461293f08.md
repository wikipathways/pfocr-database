caption: Proposed model for the role of MYB72 in the signal transduction pathway controlling
  rhizobacteria-mediated ISR. Colonization of the roots by ISR-inducing P. fluorescens
  WCS417r leads to a local, ET-independent activation of the transcription factor
  gene MYB72. Downstream of, or in parallel with, MYB72, an as-yet-unidentified ET
  signaling component is required in the roots for the onset of broad-spectrum ISR
  in the leaves. Because EIL3 interacts with MYB72 in vitro, EIL3 is a potential candidate
  in this respect. Systemically, the ISR signal transduction cascade requires responsiveness
  to both JA and ET and is dependent on NPR1. Finally, induction of ISR is associated
  with priming for enhanced expression of a large set of JA- and ET-responsive genes
  that becomes apparent only after pathogen attack. This allows the plant to react
  more effectively to an invading pathogen, which may explain the broad-spectrum characteristic
  of rhizobacteria-mediated ISR.

  description: Proposed model for the role of MYB72 in the signal transduction pathway
    controlling rhizobacteria-mediated ISR. Colonization of the roots by ISR-inducing
    P. fluorescens WCS417r leads to a local, ET-independent activation of the transcription
    factor gene MYB72. Downstream of, or in parallel with, MYB72, an as-yet-unidentified

    responsiveness to both JA and ET and is dependent on NPR1. Finally, induction
    of ISR is associated with priming for enhanced expression of a large set of JA-
    and ET-responsive genes that becomes apparent only after pathogen attack. This
    allows the plant to react more effectively to an invading pathogen, which may
    explain the broad-spectrum characteristic of rhizobacteria-mediated ISR.
