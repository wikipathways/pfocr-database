caption: 'Pathways of putrescine, GABA, ornithine, and arginine degradation. Enzymes
  1–4 constitute the transaminase pathway of putrescine degradation. Enzymes 5–10
  define the glutamylated putrescine (GP) pathway of putrescine degradation. Enzymes
  11–15 show the pathway of arginine degradation. Ornithine is degraded by AstA-dependent
  succinylation (not shown), which generates succinyl ornithine (). The transaminase
  and GP pathways are independently regulated (). Ntr regulators control the transaminase
  pathway and the arginine catabolic pathway (enzymes 1–4 and 11–15), but none of
  the other enzymes (; ; ) (this paper). The putrescine-binding PuuR repressor regulates
  the GP pathway (enzymes 5–10) (). In other words, putrescine induces. PuuC is a
  broadly specific dehydrogenase that oxidizes three different aldehydes: ABAL, γ-glutamyl
  ABAL, and SSA (). Abbreviations: ABAL, γ-aminobutyraldehyde; GABA, γ-aminobutyric
  acid; SSA, succinic semialdehyde; αKG, α-ketoglutarate; GLT, glutamate: and GSA,
  glutamic semialdehyde.'
