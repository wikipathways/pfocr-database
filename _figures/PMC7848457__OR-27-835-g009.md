caption: A proposed model of molecular targets of NSAIDs in enhancing Hsp90 inhibitor
  cytotoxicity of CD44highK562 cells. Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to disruption of regulatory
  complexes of Hsp90 with HSF1 and client proteins involving mutp53, thereby causing
  HSF1-mediated induction of Hsp70, which is responsible for the resistance of CD44highK562
  cells to Hsp90 inhibitor. NSAIDs inhibit phosphorylation of STAT3 that can upregulate
  HSF-1, resulting in reduced resistance against Hsp90 inhibitor in the cells. NSAIDs
  can promote autophagic cell death through inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway
  and downregulation of Bcl-2/Mcl-1, which trigger autophagy-mediated degradation
  of multiple stemness-related marker proteins.
