caption: Organization and regulation of the Arc- and Cpx-TCS in E. coli. The Arc system
  is commonly induced under conditions provoking a reduced state of the quinone pool
  of the electron transport chain. The autophosphorylation of the SK ArcB is followed
  by a phosphoryl group transfer onto its cognate RR ArcA resulting in a specific
  response. The phosphorelay reaction for the phosphoryl group transfer from ArcB
  to ArcA is simplified for better understanding. The envelope stress sensing Cpx
  system is induced by e.g. misfolded proteins or nlpE overexpression, followed by
  autophosphorylation of CpxA, phosphotransfer onto its cognate RR CpxR and response
  of the cells. The Cpx system is inhibited by interaction of the periplasmic accessory
  protein CpxP with CpxA. As postulated by Kohanski et al. (2008) addition and uptake
  of aminoglycosides lead to mistranslation of proteins in the cytoplasm, and result
  in misfolded, periplasmic proteins activating the Cpx system []. According to this
  controversially discussed hypothesis, crosstalk between CpxA and ArcA takes place
  under this condition leading to cell death (red marked pathway). IM = inner membrane;
