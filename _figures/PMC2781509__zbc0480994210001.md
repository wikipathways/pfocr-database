caption: Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism
  is required for the de novo synthesis of purines and thymidylate and for the remethylation
  of homocysteine to methionine. Mitochondrial-derived formate can enter the cytoplasm
  and function as a one-carbon donor through the conversion of THF to 10-formyl-THF.
  5,10-Methylene-THF, which can be generated through the reduction of 10-formyl-THF
  or through the catalytic activity of SHMT1, provides the one-carbon units for the
  TS-catalyzed conversion of dUMP to thymidylate. It also serves as a substrate for
  methylene-THF reductase (MTHFR), which reduces 5,10-methylene-THF to ultimately
  form S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the one-carbon donor in numerous cellular methylation
  reactions. De novo thymidylate biosynthesis also occurs in the nucleus through the
  SUMO-dependent import of the thymidylate synthesis pathway during S-phase. Hcy,
  homocysteine; DHF, dihydrofolate.
