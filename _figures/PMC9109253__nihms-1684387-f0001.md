caption: PA and MMA Biochemical Pathways and Biomarkers. PA and MMA are caused by
  enzymatic deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase
  (MUT). PCC converts propionyl-CoA (P-CoA) to methylmalonyl-CoA (M-CoA) and MUT subsequently
  converts M-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which feeds into the TCA cycle for energy production.
  The catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids valine and isoleucine, as well
  as methionine, threonine, odd-chain fatty acids and the side chain of cholesterol
  funnel into the TCA cycle through PCC and MUT. Primary metabolites of P-CoA include
  2-methylcitric acid (MCA), propionyl-carnitine (C3), 3-hydroxypropionic acid, and
  propionyl-glycine which are detectable in both PA and MMA, and methylmalonic acid
  and methylmalonyl-carnitine, which are detectable in MMA patients only. Elevated
  P-CoA has been shown to inhibit N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), which reduces
  ureagenesis, thereby causing a secondary hyperammonemia and potential encephalopathy.
  High concentrations of P-CoA can inhibit PDH, which reduces acetyl-CoA levels and
  mitochondrial energy production. P-CoA acts as an alternative substrate for citrate
  synthase (CS), resulting in production of MCA. PA and MMA are multi-systemic diseases
  affecting renal, gastrointestinal, immune, CNS, hepatic, hematologic, and cardiovascular
  systems, and are associated with morbidity and mortality in infancy and childhood,
  and for survivors, debilitating end-organ damage and death. PA and MMA affect sequential
  steps in the same propionate catabolic pathway, leading to similar acute and chronic
  disease manifestations, although some later stage disease complications appear to
  be more specific to either PA or MMA.
