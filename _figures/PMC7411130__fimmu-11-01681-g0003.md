caption: Regulators of the complement pathway. Both surface and soluble complement
  regulatory molecules identified in the red boxes inhibit critical junctures of the
  cascade and degrade C3 convertases (C4b2a or C3bBb) or C5 convertases (C4b2a3b or
  C3bBbC3b) and the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. C1 inhibitor prevents excessive activation
  of both Classical and Lectin pathways. The Classical and Lectin pathway C3 convertase,
  C4b2a, is regulated by complement receptor 1 (CR1), C4 binding protein (C4BP), decay
  accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), and factor I. The Alternative
  pathway C3-convertase, C3bBb, is regulated by CR1, factor I, factor H, DAF, and
  MCP. The anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, are degraded by carboxypeptidase N. Finally,
  Vitronectin and Clusterin inhibit the C5b-8 complex while CD59 (protectin) inhibits
  C9 insertion into membrane attack complex (MAC).
