caption: Illustration of the algorithm for a particular miRNA-pathway pair. (A) Gene
  expression data is first subsetted by the genes in a pathway and summarized by Isomap
  to produce the PAS, a one-dimensional (1D) summary of pathway expression in all
  samples. (B) PAS and miRNA expression are subsetted by phenotype, and miRNA-pathway
  correlations are computed for tumor and normal tissue. The difference between correlations
  gives Δρ. (C) To assess Δρ significance, the Δρ null distribution is estimated by
  random permutation of the class labels.
