caption: Schematic diagram of the assembled modules to convert galactose to n-butanol.
  In galactose utilization module, β-d-galactose is converted into α-d-glucose-6-phosphate
  through the Leloir pathway, which is a more complicated enzymatic pathway than that
  required for glucose. Acetoacetyl-CoA from α-d-glucose-6-phosphate is transformed
  into n-butanol by the n-butanol production module. Four moles of NADH generated
  from one mole of galactose are used in the n-butanol biosynthesis. In NADH supplementation
  module, additional NADH is produced by converting formate to carbon dioxide. The
  red arrows indicate the homologous and heterologous overexpression of genes. The
  blue arrow represents controllable expression of fdh1 for optimal n-butanol production
papertitle: Modular design of metabolic network for robust production of n-butanol
  from galactose–glucose mixtures.
