caption: An integrated view of the biology of Halobacterium  NRC-1. Aspects of energy
  production, nutrient uptake, membrane  assembly, cation and anion transport, and
  signal transduction are  depicted. ATP synthesis by chemiosmotic coupling of proton
  transport by  the respiratory chain and by light-driven proton pumping by  bacteriorhodopsin
  (BR) (purple oval) or chloride  transport by halorhodopsin (HR) (blue oval) is shown.
  Below, the  semiphosphorylated Entner–Doudoroff pathway is shown, and the presence  of
  fatty acid oxidation and the citric acid cycle is indicated. Enzymes  not yet identified
  are marked with asterisks. A variety of nutrient  uptake systems (represented by
  yellow or brown structures) coded by the  genome including glycerol 3-phosphate
  (UgpABCE) and ribose (RbsAC) ABC  transporters, a lactate (LctP) transporter, formate-oxalate
  antiporter  (OxiT), spermidine and putrescine uptake ABC transporter (PotABCD),
  and  amino acid (PutP, Cat) and dipeptide (DppABCDF) transporters are shown.  Other
  amino acid uptake systems, represented by a generic ABC  transporter, are also likely
  to exist. Components of the protein  translocation machinery (SecDEFY, SRP19, 54,
  SRα) (in black) are  shown. Cation transporters (in green) shown are for K+  (TrkAH,
  and KdpABC), Na+ (NhaC), Cd2+ (ZntX and  Cd efflux ATPase), Co2+ (CbiNOQ), Cu2+
  (NosFY),  Fe3+ (iron permease and HemUV), and Zn2+  (ZurMA). Anion transporters
  shown (in red) are for  SO42− (CysAT), PO43− (PstABC and  phosphate permease), Cl−
  (chloride channel), and arsenate  (ArsABC). A complex system of photoreceptors and
  signal transduction  components are shown, including two sensory receptors (SRI
  shown in  blue and SRII shown in orange), 17 transducers (Htr I, II, III, IV, V,  VI,
  VII, VIII, IX, X, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, and XVIII)  responding to light
  (hυ), O2, or amino acids, as  indicated. Transmission of the motility signal to
  the flagellar motor  via CheAW and CheY is shown by arrows. Single examples of sensor  kinases,
  membrane bound (white rhombus) or cytoplasmic, and response  regulators are identified.
