caption: Potential for PD-L1 modulation in HNSCC. Members of the EGFR, STAT, PI3K,
  p53, and HIF-1α signaling pathways, all of which may be de-regulated in HNSCC, are
  shown. EGFR is aberrantly activated in HNSCC and may promote PD-L1 transcription
  via JAK/STAT or MEK/ERK signaling. IFN-γ induces PD-L1 transcription in HSCC via
  JAK/STAT signaling, and may also activate the PI3K signaling pathway, which regulates
  PD-L1 transcription in other cancers. HIF-1α binds directly to the PD-L1 promoter
  and correlates with high PD-L1 expression. p53 loss of function is common in HNSCC,
  and wild type p53 blocks PD-L1 translation via transcription of miR-34. Also shown
  are targeted small molecule inhibitors and biologics currently being evaluated in
  active clinical trials open to HNSCC patients. Red text indicates inhibitors for
  which efficacy in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is being evaluated. Table
  (lower right) is based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network (http://cancergenome.nih.gov).
  The middle column denotes the percentage of 504 cases with alternations (mutations
  or copy number variations) in the indicated gene. Within this dataset, 35 of 106
  cases in which p16 was assessed were designated HPV positive. The rightmost column
  denotes the percentage of HPV positive cases with alterations in the indicated gene
  .
