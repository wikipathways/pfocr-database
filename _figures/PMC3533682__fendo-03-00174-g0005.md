caption: Proposed UT-associated signaling pathways. Activated UTs are known to recruit
  Gαq/11 proteins and to signal through different pathways associated with an elevation
  of intracellular calcium and gene transcription. Nuclear UTs could induce transcription
  through a pathway involving the production of IP3 that would trigger IP3Rs at the
  inner nuclear envelop, releasing calcium in the nucleoplasm. This latter event is
  crucial to initiate transcription through transcription factors such as CREB and
  DREAM. From Proulx et al. (); Bootman et al. (); Vaudry et al. (); Roskoski ();
  Tadevosyan et al. ().
