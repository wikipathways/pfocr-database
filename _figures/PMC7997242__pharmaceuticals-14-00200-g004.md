caption: Mechanisms of CD226 downregulation. (Left) Tumor microenvironment promotes
  the accumulation of a subset of CD8+ T cells that lose CD226. CD226 is transcriptionally
  downregulated in an eomesodermin (Eomes)-dependent and a PVR-independent manner.
  CD226 downregulation is abolished in Eomes-deficient CD8+ T cells. Eomes directly
  interacts with regulatory elements of the CD226 gene. (Right) CD226 expression is
  posttranslationally regulated through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. After engagement
  with PVR, mouse CD226 is phosphorylated at Y319 by Scr kinase, subsequently recruiting
  E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b, which induces ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation
  of phosphorylated CD226.
