caption: Representation of signalling transduction via adiponectin receptor activation.
  Adiponectin exists in full-length, globular, high molecular and low molecular weight
  forms. The binding of the different forms of adiponectin to the two known adiponectin
  receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, can lead to stimulation of AMPK, p38-MAPK, JNK and
  PPARα. Interacting directly with the N-terminal of adiponectin receptors, APPL1
  elicits signalling through PPARα and along with AMPK modulates the PI3K pathway
  and eNOS levels. ACC phosphorylation occurs from CK2 adaptor protein at the AdipoR1
  N-terminus whilst interaction of the scaffold protein RACK-I at AdipoR1 can mediate
  glucose metabolism. The ER chaperone, ERp46 helps mediate AdipoR1 signalling to
  p38 and AMPK. Signalling to NF-κB is solely through AdipoR1, but evidence exists
  for both its activation and inhibition upon gAD binding. Activation of both receptors
  results in activation of the caspase cascade and alterations in cell survival.
