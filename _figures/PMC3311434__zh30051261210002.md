caption: The PepT1-nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) pathway. Upon intracellular
  accumulation of bacterial di/tripeptides in intestinal epithelial cells via PepT1-mediated
  transport, bacterial di/tripeptides interact with the NOD1/2 receptors. Associations
  of NOD1/2 receptors with receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RICK)
  trigger downstream activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways leading to proinflammatory
  cytokine/chemokine production. Tri-DAP was previously shown to directly interact
  with the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region of NOD1 to mediate its effects, whereas
  MDP interacts with NOD2. Because of the increase in proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine
  production, increased infiltration of neutrophils into inflammatory regions occurs.
  CARD, caspase-recruitment domains.
