caption: A general simplified model of BR and ethylene cross-talk. The perception
  of BR begins in its receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) which activates
  BR signaling, which, in turn, controls ethylene biosynthesis in a dose-dependent
  manner. (A) High levels of BR decrease the activity of BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1/BRI1-EMS
  SUPPRESSOR 1 (BZR1/BES1), the major transcription factors of the BR signaling pathway
  while enhancing the stability of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)-synthase
  enzyme (ACS) proteins by preventing its degradation by the 26S proteasome and consequently,
  activating ethylene biosynthesis. (B) Low levels of BR increase the activity of
  BZR1/BES1, which, in turn, bind to the promoter of the ACC-synthase (ACS) and ACC-oxidase
  (ACO) genes, inhibiting their transcription and consequently, repressing ethylene
  biosynthesis. PM represents the plasma membrane.
