caption: Effects of TNP-α on insulin signaling pathways. Insulin signals tyrosine
  phosphorylation of IRS and activates SOS (Son of Sevenless) and the downstream Erk
  pathway, leading to transcription and growth. In addition, insulin-stimulated Akt
  phosphorylation leads to glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, protein synthesis,
  cell survival and gene transcription. The binding of TNF-α to its receptor increases
  SOCS-3 expression and activates serine kinases including INK and IKK, which inhibit
  IRS tyrosine phosphorylation and activation.
