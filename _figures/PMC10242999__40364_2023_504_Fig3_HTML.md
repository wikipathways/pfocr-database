caption: Overview on factors affecting F3 gene and TF-involved signaling pathways
  progressing cancer. The right and bottom parts of the figure show the positive and
  negative effectors affecting the expression of TF gene, with blue arrows indicating
  positive effectors and red arrows indicating negative effectors. Activation of the
  mTOR pathway, inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, activation of proto-oncogenes
  such as KRAS, inactivation of PTEN and P53, growth factors such as EGF, FGF and
  VEGF, and hypoxia are positive effectors. On the other hand microRNAs such as miR19
  and miR19a are negative effectors of the expression of TF gene. The top part of
  the figure shows how TF works in angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, tumor cell
  growth, and carcinogenesis. On the one hand, TF leads to uncontrolled growth of
  cancer cells by activating the JAK2-STAT5 pathway, which prevents the apoptosis
  of cancer cells, and on the other hand, by activating RTKs, it promotes the growth
  of tumor cells. TF leads to increased angiogenesis and metastasis of tumor cells
  by increasing VEGF and inhibiting TSP. TF activates rac1, which in turn activates
  PKA and regulates MAPK, leading to the growth and metastasis of cancer cells. TF
  activates PAR2, which in turn leads to increased angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis
  of cancer cells in several ways. On the one hand, it leads to increased VEGF, bEGF,
  IL8, and βTGF- and, therefore angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells.
  Moreover, it stabilizes β-catenin and causes invasion of tumor cells. PAR2 also
  activates MAPK and ERK1/2 pathways, and increases β-arrestin, which phosphorylates
  cofilin, leading to the polymerization of actin filaments at the edge of invading
  cells and thus increasing invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. TF activates the
  signaling pathways PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and FAK by binding to integrins α6β1 and β3vα
