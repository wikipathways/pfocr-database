caption: Proposed model of KSHV-induced lymphatic reprogramming of endothelial cells.
  KSHV infection of endothelial cells induces the secretion of a soluble factor that
  activates the gp130 receptor. Activation of the gp130 receptor activates JAK2, which
  directly phosphorylates and activates STAT3. Downstream of gp130, JAK2 also promotes
  the activation of PI3K to phosphorylate Akt. Prox1 is induced downstream of the
  PI3K/Akt pathway and regulates VEGFR-3 induction and podoplanin expression. STAT3
  regulates gp130 induction, and its persistent activation controls a positive autoregulatory
  loop of the entire signaling pathway. Arrows with solid lines, direct regulation;
  arrows with dashed lines, indirect regulation of the target.
