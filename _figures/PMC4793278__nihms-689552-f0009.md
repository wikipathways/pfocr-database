caption: Disruption of lipid rafts by methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol chelator,
  abolishes acute shear stress-induced endocytosis of Ab62/NC and Ab37/NC. Blockage
  of RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway by Y-27632 selectively inhibits shear-stress-stimulated
  endocytosis of Ab62/NC. Inhibition of Src family kinases (SFKs) by PP2 specifically
  blocks flow-stimulated endocytosis of Ab37/NC.
