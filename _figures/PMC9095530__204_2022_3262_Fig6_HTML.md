caption: Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway
  is regulated by the death receptors (Fas, the TNF receptor superfamily 1A (TNFR1),
  TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors 10a (TRAIL1) and TRAIL2 (10b)) which
  are overstimulated during Dox exposure. The death-inducing signaling complex (DISC),
  “complexes I and II”, is formulated by the assembly of dynamic multi-proteins, that
  operate as molecular platforms that regulate Casp-8. Activated Casp-8 facilitates
  the proteolytic maturation of executioner Casp-3/6/7 which drives apoptosis via
  DNA damage. Simultaneously, Dox-mediated cleavage of pro-apoptotic BH3-interacting
  domain death agonist (BID) forms truncated BID (tBID). The tBID is then translocated
  to the outer mitochondrial membrane via a Fas-dependent pathway, which is reliant
  on the binding of modulator of apoptosis 1 (MOAP1) to the BID receptor mitochondrial
  carrier 2 (MTCH2). Dox also mediates the reduction of cFLIPs and XIAP via NF-κβ
  overexpression to trigger the onset and progression of apoptosis
