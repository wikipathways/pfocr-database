caption: Regulatory Pathways of Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
  (T2DM). This diagram demonstrates how S1P interacts with specific receptors on various
  cell types to influence glucose and lipid metabolism, thereby affecting key signaling
  pathways associated with T2DM. S1P modulates the PI3K/Akt pathway to regulate GLUT4
  translocation and the MAPK pathway to impact glucose uptake and metabolism. Additionally,
  it alters insulin receptor signaling by influencing ceramide and sphingosine levels,
  thus impacting insulin resistance. S1P, through SphK2, affects the expression levels
  of PPARγ and its downstream protein CD36, improving sugar and lipid metabolism as
  well as insulin resistance. Moreover, S1P activates PP2A to inhibit the translocation
  of GLUT1 on the cell surface, reducing lipid peroxidation. The dynamic balance between
  SphK1 and SphK2 enzyme activities determines the overall levels of S1P, linking
  sphingolipid metabolism with insulin resistance and inflammation in T2DM. Key components
  include Sphs (sphingosines), S1P, GLUT4, GLUT1, PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase),
  AKT (protein kinase B), MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), PPARγ (peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor gamma), CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36), and
  PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A)
