caption: Model of a RhoB-dependent endosomal trafficking pathway that couples RTK
  stimulation to Cdc42/Rac activation, localized actin dynamics, and cell migration.
  RhoB localizes to endosomal compartments and mediates endosomal trafficking of Cdc42
  and Rac in response to PDGFR stimulation. Through the recruitment of Vav2, RhoB
  controls activation of Cdc42 and Rac in early endosomes and delivers active-Cdc42/Rac
  to the plasma membrane resulting in actin remodeling events that are essential for
  cell migration.
