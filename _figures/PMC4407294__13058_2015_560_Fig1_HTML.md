caption: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK pathways. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K) is a cytoplasmic lipid and protein kinase recruited to the membrane by activated
  growth factor receptors, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2),
  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1R).
  PI3K phosphorylates the 3′-hydroxyl group of phosphoinositides to produce phoshatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3), which is a second messenger that signals through AKT to activate several
  enzymes, kinases, and transcription factors, including mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR). The RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK pathway converges with the PI3K/AKT pathway and is
  now recognized as an alternative in mTOR activation. On the other hand, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog (PTEN) catalyzes PIP3 dephosphorylation, acting as a negative
  regulator of its activity. In parallel with activation of growth factor receptors,
  estrogens can activate nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs) (genomic pathway) or ERs
  on the membrane (non-genomic pathway). Membrane-associated ER binds to PI3K and
  activates molecules such as AKT and RAS, crosstalking with the growth factor signaling
  pathways. Erk1/2, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2; FOXO1, Forkhead box
