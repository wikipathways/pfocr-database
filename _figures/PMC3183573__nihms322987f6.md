caption: Proposed pathway for the interaction between estrogen receptor (ER)α and
  growth factor (GF) signaling pathways and regulation by estradiol (E2) and genistein
  (Gen). We propose that Gen binds to ERα and induces interactions between ERα and
  insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR), leading to early phosphorylation
  of Shc (P-Shc) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), with subsequent activation
  of ER at Ser 118 sites resulting in enhanced ER transcriptional activity and upregulation
  of IGF-I expression resulting in a positive feedback regulatory mechanism and/or
  autocrine mechanism that stimulates UtLM cell proliferation. Also IGF-I can bind
  to IGF-IR, and in turn activate the MAPK pathway through a Shc/Grb-2 pathway, which
  can result in proliferation and also phosphorylation of ERα at serine 118. The pentagons
  represent possible novel sites that can be targeted for the treatment of symptomatic
  fibroids. GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate.
