caption: 'a Summary of membrane turnover and regulation of ciliary length. Ciliary
  length remains stable because membrane insertion and membrane removal are balanced.
  Top: Cilia grow by fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles with the periciliary membrane.
  Blocking vesicle fusion by DN Rab8 or brefeldin A blocks growth and reduces ciliary
  length if membrane removal continues. Elongation of the ciliary membrane is accompanied
  by elongation of ciliary microtubules (green). Bottom: Endocytosis and ciliary fission
  reduce ciliary length. Fission can be induced by PIP2 increase (synthesis or impaired
  Inpp5e), activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) or serum exposure. Blocking
  these processes by PIP2 depletion, TMSß, DN Rac1, alisertib or tubacin increases
  ciliary length if vesicle fusion continues. Ciliary microtubules need to be severed
  for ciliary shortening. b Proposed molecular pathway of ciliary fission. Recruitment
  of PIPK and deficiency of the 5-phosphatase Inpp5e lead to an increase in ciliary
  PIP2. Serum addition and agonist binding (in the presence of DN dynamin) have the
  same effect. The PIP2 increase can be prevented by sequestering PIP2 using PH(PLCδ1)
  or by constitutive expression of the 5-phosphatase Inp54p. The PIP2 increase leads
  to polymerisation of g-actin to f-actin, presumably amplified by help of the Rho
  kinases Rac1 and Cdc42. Actin polymerisation can be prevented by TMSß and latruculin
  A. AurkA and HDAC6 likely act downstream of actin polymerisation and could work
  by microtubule depolymerisation, which is also required for ciliary fission. AurkA
  and HDAC are inhibited by alisertib, respectively, tubacin.'
