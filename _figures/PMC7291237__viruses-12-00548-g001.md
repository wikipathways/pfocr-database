caption: Late phase of the HIV-1 replication cycle. During the late phase of the HIV-1
  replication cycle, the newly synthesized Gag and GagPol precursor polyproteins,
  containing MA, CA, NC, p6 and spacer peptides [and protease (PR), reverse transcriptase
  (RT), and integrase (IN) for GagPol], are targeted to the PM for assembly. Gag and
  GagPol polyproteins are anchored to the plasma membrane via insertion of the amino-terminal
  myr group into the lipid bilayer and by specific interactions with PI(4,5)P2. In
  the meantime, through an independent pathway, the Env glycoprotein which is synthesized
  in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), traffics to the PM via the secretory pathway
  to the Golgi. Env is then incorporated into the budding particle in a process mediated
  by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). The replication
  cycle is concluded by the maturation step, which involves cleavage of Gag into individual
  domains and subsequent formation of the CA core.
