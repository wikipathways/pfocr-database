caption: Mechanism of activation for alternative NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. The alternative
  NLRP3 inflammasome pathway is triggered by TLR2/TLR4. LPS binds to TLR2/TLR4, which
  results in up-regulation of pro-1β, pro-18, and NLRP3 via the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  However, this type of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is mediated by the TRIF-RIPK1-FADD-caspase-8
  axis, whereas K+ efflux, ASC speck formation and pyroptosis are not required in
  this pathway.
