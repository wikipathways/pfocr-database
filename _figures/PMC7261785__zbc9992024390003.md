caption: Model for ethylene signaling. RAN1 is a copper transporter that delivers
  copper to the lumen of the ER, where it is required for the biogenesis of the receptors
  and is used as a cofactor by the receptors to bind ethylene. A, in the absence of
  ethylene, the receptors signal to CTR1, which phosphorylates EIN2. This results
  in the ubiquitination of EIN2 by an SCF E3 containing the ETP1/2 F-box proteins,
  leading to EIN2 degradation by the proteasome. Because EIN2 levels are low, an SCF-E3
  containing the EBF1/2 F-box proteins ubiquitinates EIN3 and EIL1, leading to their
  degradation by the proteasome and preventing them from affecting transcription in
  the nucleus. B, in the presence ethylene, the receptors bind ethylene via a copper
  cofactor. The binding of ethylene is modeled to cause a conformational change that
  either reduces CTR1 kinase activity or, as shown, results in CTR1 being sequestered
  by the receptors so that CTR1 can no longer phosphorylate EIN2. The reduction in
  EIN2 phosphorylation results in less EIN2 ubiquitination and an increase in EIN2
  levels. An unknown protease cleaves EIN2, releasing the C-terminal end (EIN2-C)
  from the N-terminal end (EIN2-N). One fate of EIN2-C is to bind the RNAs for EBF1
  and EBF2 and become sequestered in processing bodies (P-bodies). The reduction of
  EBF1/2 results in less ubiquitination of EIN3 and EIL1, causing higher EIN3/EIL1
  levels. The other fate of EIN2-C is to translocate to the nucleus, where it increases
  the transcriptional activity of EIN3/EIL1 via ENAP1. This leads to numerous transcriptional
  changes. In parallel with this pathway, phosphoryl transfer from a conserved histidine
  in the ETR1 DHp domain to an aspartate in the receiver domain occurs. This is followed
  by phosphoryl transfer from this residue to AHPs and finally ARRs resulting in transcriptional
  changes.
