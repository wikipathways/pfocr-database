caption: Scheme of the Na+-dependent citrate fermentation pathway. Citrate is transported
  into the cell in symport with Na+ ions by CitS (step 1) and split into acetate and
  oxaloacetate by citrate lyase CitDEF (step 2). Decarboxylation of oxaloacetate into
  pyruvate by Na+-transporting oxaloacetate decarboxylase, OadGAB (step 3), restores
  the Na+ gradient and produces pyruvate. Pyruvate-formate lyase PflD splits pyruvate
  into formate and acetyl-CoA (step 4), which is further converted into acetylphosphate
  by phosphotransacetylase Pta (step 5). Dephosphorylation of acetylphosphate by acetate
  kinase AckA (step 6) yields ATP, resulting in energy conservation. The enzymes are
  indicated by their standard gene names, where available. The fermentation end products
  are boxed. See reference  for more details.
