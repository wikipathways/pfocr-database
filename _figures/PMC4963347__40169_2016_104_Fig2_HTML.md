caption: Schematic representation of de novo and salvage pathways for NAD+ biosynthesis.
  In mammals, the de novo biosynthesis starts from l-tryptophan (Trp) which is enzymatically
  converted in a series of reactions to quinolinic acid (QA). Through quinolinate
  phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) enzyme activity, QA is converted to nicotinic acid
  mononucleotide (NAMN), which is then converted to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide
  (NAAD) by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) enzyme. The final
  step in de novo biosynthesis is the amidation of NAAD by NAD synthase (NADS) which
  generates NAD+. The salvage pathway involves NAD+synthesis from its precursors,
  i.e. Nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM) or nicotinamide riboside (NR). NA is
  catalytically converted to NAMN by the action of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAPT). NAM is converted by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) to nicotinamide
  mononucleotide (NMN), which is also the product of phosphorylation of NR by nicotinamide
  riboside kinase (NRK) enzyme. Finally, NAMN is converted to NAD by the action of
  NMNAT and NADS enzymes, whereas NMN is converted to NAD by the NMNAT enzyme. Multiple
  enzymes break-down NAD+ to produce NAM and ADP-ribosyl moiety, however only sirtuins
  are depicted in this figure
