caption: (A) A schematic diagram of the sequential proteolytic processing of PodJ,
  first by the periplasmic protease PerP, then by the Rip metalloprotease MmpA, and
  finally by an unknown cytoplasmic protease []. (B) A schematic of the regulatory
  pathway controlling the polarity determinant PodJ. SW pole indicates the flagellated
  pole of the pre-divisional cell. PodJL is synthesized in early pre-divisional cells,
  where it localizes at the SW pole and recruits PleC. Compartmentalization, monitored
  in part by PleC, activates the expression of the PerP protease. PerP cleaves PodJL
  into PodJS. The polar functions controlled by PodJL and PodJS are indicated [–].
  (C) Model of the cell cycle-dependent localization of proteins involved in polar
  in PodJ processing and polar organelles development. (D) Model of the cell cycle-dependent
  localization of the polarity determinant TipN. The new pole of the cell is marked
  by TipN throughout the cell cycle [,].
