caption: This schematic illustrates the proposed mechanisms of how SAL induces HbF.
  To achieve control of the integrated stress response, eIF2α is phosphorylated when
  one of four kinases is activated by a stress stimulus. Normally this negative feedback
  loop recruits p-eIF2α through the downstream activation of GADD34 or CReP to regenerate
  active eIF2 to control cellular homeostasis. However, SAL, a known dephosphorylation
  inhibitor of phoso-eIF2α inhibits protein phosphatase 1 enzyme function causing
  a net result of increased phoso-eIF2α levels, which activates the downstream ATF4
  transcription factor. Increased levels of ATF4 protein translocate to the nucleus
  to bind to the γ-globin promoter at the predicted binding sites, leading to an increase
  in HbF. In sickle progenitors, γ-globin synthesis is increased upon SAL treatment
  and simultaneously decreasing ROS and sickling. The dual action of SAL in sickled
  erythroid progenitors makes it an ideal candidate for SCD and other hemoglobinopathy
  treatments.
