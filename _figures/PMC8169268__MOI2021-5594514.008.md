caption: Schematic overview of the link between the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and the
  Ras/MEK/ERK pathway. Growth factors bind receptor tyrosine kinases, which activate
  both the Ras/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, by regulating a cascade of phosphorylations.
  PI3K recruits and activates Akt on T308. Thereafter, phosphorylated Akt stimulates
  mTORC1 and mTORC2. Together with the phosphorylation of T308 by PI3K, S473 phosphorylation
  by mTORC2 is necessary for full Akt activation. After full activation of Akt, mTORC1
  causes phosphorylation on T389 for pS6. mTORC1 initiates two negative feedback loops,
  firstly to Akt and secondly to IRS. Upon binding to receptor tyrosine kinases, the
  Ras/MEK/ERK pathway is also activated, eventually leading to activation of pS6 on
  S235/236. As known, activation of pS6 has an effect on cellular proliferation and
  glucose metabolism through upregulation of the expression of GLUT1.
