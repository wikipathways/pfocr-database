caption: Sphingolipid metabolic pathway. The de novo biogenesis of sphingolipids begins
  with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl CoA by SPT. Bioactive sphingolipids
  (heavily outlined boxes), generated de novo or via breakdown of sphingomyelin, function
  as potent regulators of cellular proliferation and survival. Ceramide and sphingosine
  promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, while S1P, produced by phosphorylation
  of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase, promotes cell proliferation and survival.
  Sphingosine phosphate lyase catalyzes the irreversible cleavage of S1P to phosphoethanolamine,
  facilitating movement of bioactive sphingolipids into the ethanolamine biosynthesis
  pathway. Sphingosine may also be converted to dihydroceramide and then to ceramide,
  through the actions of dihydroceramide synthase and desaturase, respectively. Enzymes
  are italicized in this figure.
