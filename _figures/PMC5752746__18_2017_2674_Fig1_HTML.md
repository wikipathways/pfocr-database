caption: 'Tryptophan metabolism through the serotonin and kynurenine pathway. Tryptophan
  (TRP) is an essential amino acid which must be supplied with the diet. Once absorbed
  from the gut, TRP is made available in circulation as free TRP and albumin-bound
  TRP fraction and/or is metabolized along the serotonin or the kynurenine pathway.
  TRP in circulation can cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to participate in serotonin
  (5-HT) synthesis in the CNS. TRP in the gut is metabolized to 5-HT in the enterochromaffin
  cells (ECs): TRP is first converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) by the rate-limiting
  enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), then the short-lived 5-HTP intermediate product
  is decarboxylated to 5-HT by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD). However,
  the vast majority of available TRP is metabolized along the kynurenine pathway.
  Kynurenine (L-KYN) is produced from TRP by the action of the hepatic enzyme, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase
  (TDO) or the ubiquitous indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). TDO can be induced by
  glucocorticoids or by TRP itself, whereas IDO is stimulated by inflammation with
  IFN-ɣ as the most potent inducer. Once L-KYN is produced, it is further metabolized
  along one of two distinct arms of the pathway with the production of neuroprotective
  kynurenic acid (KYNA) or neurotoxic quinolinic acid (QUIN). KYNA can be neuroprotective
  against QUIN-induced excitotoxicity but it can also induce cognitive impairment
  when abnormally elevated. Activation of the kynurenin pathway has a dual impact
  by limiting the availability of TRP for 5-HT synthesis and increasing the downstream
  production of neurotoxic/neuroprotective metabolites. TRP, via the kynurenine pathway,
  is involved in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) which
  is an essential coenzyme for cellular processes of energy metabolism, cell protection
  and biosynthesis. The GM can also directly utilize TRP, limiting its availability
  to the host. Certain bacterial strains may produce a tryptophanase enzyme that synthetizes
  indoles from TRP. These microbial metabolites have recently been identified as human
  aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-selective agonists. AhR signaling has a role in
  chemical/microbial defense and tissue development, while, recently, IDO–AhR axis
  has been recognized as a fundamental player in controlling the “Disease Tolerance
  Defense Pathway”. Bacteria can also synthesize tryptophan via enzymes such as TRP
  synthase (TRP synt) and specific bacterial strains can also produce serotonin from
  TRP in vitro. The balance between bacterial TRP utilization and metabolism, TRP
  synthesis and 5-HT production plays an important role in regulating gastrointestinal
  and circulating TRP availability for the host in addition to its dietary intake.
  Moreover, accumulating evidence supports the role of the GM in regulating TRP availability
  and 5-HT synthesis via modulation of the enzymes responsible for TRP degradation
  along the kynurenine pathway'
