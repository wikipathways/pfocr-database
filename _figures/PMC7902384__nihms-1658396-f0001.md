caption: Simplified model of abscisic acid (ABA) signal transduction and regulatory
  mechanisms in stomatal closure discussed herein.A reconstitutable ABA signaling
  module is enclosed in a red rectangle. Positive regulators of ABA signaling are
  presented in green boxes. Negative regulators of ABA signal transduction are presented
  in red ovals. Arrows indicate activation and bars indicate downregulation. Solid
  lines represent regulation pathways predicted to be direct, and dashed lines represent
  some of the unknown pathways that remain to be investigated further. ABA-bound PYR/PYL
  receptors inhibit PP2C phosphatase activity leading OST1/SnRK2.6 kinase activation
  by clade-B3 Raf-like M3Ks in guard cells. The S-type anion channel SLAC1, the R-type
  anion channel QUAC1/AtALMT12 and other diverse targets not shown here are activated
  via phosphorylation by the OST1/SnRK2.6, SnRK2.2 and SnRK2.3 protein kinases, thus
  triggering stomatal closure. Note that additional phosphorylation targets of SnRK2
  protein kinases are required for stomatal closure and many of these remain to be
  identified. PP2Cs downregulate SnRK2 protein kinases and also additional targets
  (not shown), including SLAC1, thus preventing non-specific Ca2+-induced S-type anion
  channel activation by calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPKs). L-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE
  1 (DES1) mediates ABA-induced hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production, and then H2S persulfidates
  OST1/SnRK2.6 on cysteine residues to enhance OST1 kinase activity. OST1/SnRK2.6
  kinase is inhibited by the SnRK2-interacting calcium sensor (SCS). CARK1 phosphorylates
  PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors to enhance ABA signal transduction. The stability of PYR/PYL/RCARs
  receptors is regulated by ALIX-mediated protein degradation. A PP2C-GEF-ROP control
  loop can ensure the off/on regulation of ABA signal transduction, with ABA triggering
  GEF trafficking to the prevacuolar compartment for degradation through CPK phosphorylation
  of GEF, thus removing ROP activity. EAR1 enhances PP2C phosphatase activity to repress
  ABA signal transduction, and PUB12/13, RGLG1/5 and BPMs regulate PP2C stability
  through the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway. ABA inhibits RGLG1 myristoylation
  through an unknown mechanism to promote its nuclear localization and PP2CA degradation.
