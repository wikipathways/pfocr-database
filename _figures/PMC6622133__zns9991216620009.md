caption: Schematic diagram of the effect of BDNF/TrkB and downstream signaling pathways
  on central sensitization following C-fiber activity. Both BDNF and glutamate are
  released from presynaptic DRG neurons following C-fiber activity by peripheral capsaicin
  treatment. Activation of postsynaptic TrkB receptor in the spinal dorsal horn by
  BDNF induces intracellular PKC activation and enhances NMDAR function via phosphorylation.
  On the other hand, BDNF also activates intracellular PI3K/Akt pathway, and then
  induces ASIC1a phosphorylation and forward targeting to neuron surface. ASIC1a channels
  sense synaptic acidosis and cause membrane depolarization via Na+ and Ca2+ influx,
  which may facilitate NMDAR activation and induce central sensitization. Blockade
  of ASIC1a channel trafficking by fusion of S25-peptide to obstruct the phosphorylation
  of ASIC1a at Ser25 attenuates BDNF-mediated mechanical hyperalgesia (right). Moreover,
  release of BDNF from spinal microglia following peripheral nerve injury () may also
  facilitate forward trafficking of ASIC1a and then induces central sensitization.
