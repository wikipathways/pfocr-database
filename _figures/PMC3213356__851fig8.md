caption: SA-mediated defense signaling networks. SA represents a key hub on the defense
  signaling networks. Genes regulate SA-mediated defense can be viewed in three types.
  Type I genes are responsible for SA biosynthesis, with SID2 contributing to the
  major SA production and SID2-independent pathway playing a minor role. Type II genes
  encode protein products that do not act directly as SA biosynthetic enzymes. It
  is possible that these SA regulators might influence SA biosynthetic processes by
  either modifying the activities of the SA biosynthetic enzymes or regulating precursor
  availability for SA biosynthesis. Alternatively, they can affect SA stability, sequestration,
  transport, and/or conjugation. Among the known type II SA genes, EDS5 plays a major
  role in regulating SA accumulation. Other components also partially affect SA levels.
  Type III genes include NPR1 as the main SA signal transducer and other signal transducers
  independent of NPR1. Expression of some SA regulatory genes is known to be regulated
  by SA, suggesting the existence of multiple signal amplification loops involving
  SA and SA regulatory genes. In this report, we described a genetic analysis based
  on the defense-sensitized mutant acd6-1 to elucidate the functional relationships
  among the SA genes. We showed that the same type of SA genes can additively interact
  with each other and they can also additively interact with other types of SA genes
  to affect SA accumulation, defense gene expression, disease resistance, and/or cell
  death phenotypes in the acd6-1 background. Nonadditive interactions were observed
  between EDS1 and PAD4 and between ALD1 and NPR1.
