caption: 'Central neuronal circuits involved in homeostatic and non-homeostatic systems.
  (A) Hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis. The Arc of the hypothalamus contains
  two groups of neurons: NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons. These neurons secrete orexigenic
  AgRP/NPY or anorexigenic POMC to the second-order neurons in the PVH and LH. In
  the PVN, neurons produce OT, TRH and CRH to decrease food intake. Neurons in the
  LH produce ORX and MCH to increase food intake. AgRP is an antagonist of anorectic
  MC4R expressed on neurons within the PVN. In the Arc, a local circuit exists in
  which POMC neurons receive GABAergic (inhibitory) input from NPY/AgRP neurons. The
  SF-1 nerve located in the VMH innervates POMC/CART neurons to enhance the anorexia
  function of POMC/CART neurons and is critically involved in the regulation of energy
  homeostasis. (B) The dopamine system, which contains connections between the midbrain
  and forebrain. The reward pathway includes dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental
  area that project to the NAc and PFC. Dopamine, which is released from dopaminergic
  neurons in the VTA, binds to D1R or D2R in the NAc and D1R in the PFC, which contribute
  to food reward. In turn, D1R also inhibits DA and GABAergic neurons in the VTA through
  different GABA receptors to form negative feedback regulation. The VTA also contains
  GABAergic cells and Pnoc neurons that project to DA neurons to inhibit DA activity.
  In addition, DA neurons located in the SN also project to the DS, which potentially
  increases food reward behavior. Hyp, hypothalamus; Arc, arcuate nucleus; LHA, lateral
