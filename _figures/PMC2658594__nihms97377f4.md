caption: Activation of the AHR pathway results in the improper expression of R-Spondin1,
  which acts through LRP6 to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. A) Over-activation
  of Wnt/β-catenin signaling causes the stabilization of β-catenin, resulting in the
  misexpression of various Wnt target genes. B) β-catenin could also be regulated
  at the post-transcriptional level by direct interactions with Sox9 controlling the
  expression of these proteins. The inhibitory effect on regeneration after AHR activation
  could be due to an interplay between these events.
