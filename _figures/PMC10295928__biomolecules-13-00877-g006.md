caption: 'MiRNA-assisted immunotherapy. Alterations in intracellular-related signaling
  have four main effects on immunotherapy resistance: (A) Excessive activation of
  intracellular MAPK kinase pathway leads to IL-8 and VEGF production and inhibits
  T-lymphocyte infiltration into tumor tissue; (B) Loss of activity of the PTEN protein
  pathway leads to increased PI3K activity and reduced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity;
  (C) Over-activation of the Wnt signaling pathway leads to impaired or even suppressed
  production of MIP-1, which reduces infiltration of CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs)
  into tumor tissue; (D) Mutations in the JAK1/JAK2 gene promote the excessive activity
  of STATs family proteins and consequently the appearance of abnormal forms of IFN-γ
  receptors on the surface of tumor cells. MiRNAs can cause or reverse targeted therapy
  resistance through the mechanisms described above'
