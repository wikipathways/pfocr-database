caption: Ingenuity Pathway Assist (IPA) analysis of significant genes involved in
  cell death. Data sets for each time point were uploaded to IPA that consisted of
  all the genes changed at the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-corrected P value of 0.05 or
  less. These data sets were then filtered using IPA software (See Materials and Methods).
  IPA biological/gene network analysis indicates the interaction of groups of genes
  with one another and how their expression decreases (in green) or increases (in
  red) over time. In addition to the visualization of the gene interactions, IPA analysis
  shows the sub-cellular localization of each of the molecules. See text for details.
