caption: 'The regulatory mechanisms for Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway: Under normal
  conditions, Keap1 mediates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Nrf2
  by binding to Nrf2 and interacting with the CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Under
  oxidative stress conditions, the accumulation of ROS prompts Nrf2 to dissociate
  from Keap1 and translocate to the nucleus, activating the expression of antioxidant
  genes such as HO-1 and NQO1. HO-1 metabolizes free heme to produce bilirubin, iron,
  and carbon monoxide, thereby regulating the antioxidant response. However, excessive
  iron and oxidative stress can trigger lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, leading
  to inflammatory responses. The expression of antioxidant genes can inhibit apoptosis
  by removing ROS. Additionally, GSK3β regulates the stability of Nrf2 through phosphorylation,
  while IDH mutations, associated with increased Nrf2 activity, can modulate the oxidative
  stress response via the NADPH/NADP+ pathway'
