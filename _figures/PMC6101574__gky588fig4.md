caption: Strand asymmetries in nick repair.A nick can be repaired by homologous SSOs
  complementary to either the nicked (cN) or intact (cI) strand. In repair via the
  cN pathway, the 3′ end of the nicked target primes new DNA synthesis using the annealed
  donor as template, transferring sequence exclusively in one direction. In contrast,
  in repair via the cI pathway, sequences on both sides of the nick may undergo conversion
  (,). Note that heteroduplex DNA is formed in both pathways. The heteroduplex can
  be corrected by mismatch repair (MMR) or persist and be replicated and then segregated
  at the next cell division.
