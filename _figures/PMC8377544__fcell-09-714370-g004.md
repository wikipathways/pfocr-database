caption: ROS functions in Drosophila stem cells and tissue regeneration. Redox homeostasis
  plays important roles in the maintenance of stem cells in Drosophila. High ROS levels
  (highlighted in green) induce germline stem cells (GSC) differentiation via the
  activation of the EGF/EGFR/Erk1/2 pathway. On the other hand, reduced ROS levels
  (highlighted in blue) promote the overgrowth of GSC-like cells. The accumulation
  of ROS caused by mitochondrial fission (inhibition of Drp1) leads to an activation
  of the EGFR pathway in adjacent somatic cyst cells in Drosophila larval testes leading
  to the loss of GSCs and spermatogonia. The ROS act in a paracrine fashion to regulate
  normal cardiac function. In pericardial cells (PCs), ROS stimulate the downstream
  MKK3/p38 MAPK pathway that regulates the cardiac function of the cardiomyocytes
  (CMs). Apoptosis or a physical damage of the wing imaginal epithelia also leads
  to a ROS-induced activation of the p38 MAP kinase, which induces moderate levels
  of JNK-mediated Upd cytokine expression, triggering the JAK/STAT pathway activation
  and cell regeneration processes.

    homeostasis plays important roles in the maintenance of stem cells in Drosophila.
    High ROS levels (highlighted in green) induce germline stem cells (GSC) differentiation

    ROS levels (highlighted in blue) promote the overgrowth of GSC-like cells. The

    larval testes leading to the loss of GSCs and spermatogonia. The ROS act in a
    paracrine fashion to regulate normal cardiac function. In pericardial cells (PCs),
    ROS stimulate the downstream MKK3/p38 MAPK pathway that regulates the cardiac
    function of the cardiomyocytes (CMs). Apoptosis or a physical damage of the wing
    imaginal epithelia also leads to a ROS-induced activation of the p38 MAP kinase,
