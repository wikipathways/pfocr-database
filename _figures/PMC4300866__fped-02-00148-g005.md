caption: Rheumatic fever (RF) and its most severe sequel chronic rheumatic heart disease
  (RHD) are chronic inflammations that follow oropharynx infection by Streptococcus
  pyogenes, whose cell wall presents several PAMPs, including M protein, lipoteichoic
  acid, and N-acetil-β-d-glucosamine. M protein shares structural homology with heart
  proteins such as myosin and tropomyosin, leading to the formation of cross-reactive
  auto-antibodies. MBL and Ficolin-2 bind N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine and lipoteichoic
  acid, respectively, inducing complement activation and phagocytosis. Although conferring
  protection against the initial infection, MBL may deposit on the altered valves,
  eliciting inflammation, and complement tissue damage in the chronic stage of the
  disease. The functional importance of the proteins may vary during infection and
  disease establishment, with MBL2 and FCN2 polymorphisms leading to high MBL and
  low Ficolin-2 levels, respectively, being associated with increased susceptibility
  to RHD.
