caption: Regulatory network construction for the overlapped genes. miR‐146a‐5p might
  interact with RAC1, PTGS2, and NRAS via VEGF signaling pathway and mediate biological
  processes with SMAD4, YES1 and IQGAP1 via adherens junction. SORT1 might be associated
  with miR‐146a‐5p via neurotrophin signaling pathway and Toll‐like receptor signaling
  pathway could be in charge for the interactions and regulations between miR‐146a
  and TRAF6 and IRAK1. The rest of genes might interact with miR‐146a‐5p via various
  pathways.
