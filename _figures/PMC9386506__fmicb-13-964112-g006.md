caption: Scheme of the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of MS19 via the inhibition of
  NF-κB signaling and HMGB1 release in LPS/TLR4 pathway. MS19 inhibits the phosphorylation
  of p65 NF-κB and release of HMGB1 induced by LPS (red solid line); MS19 does not
  inhibit the phosphorylation of TAK-1, ERK, and p38 MAPK (red cross); our previous
  study reported that MS19 inhibits the expression and nuclear translocation of IRF5
  (red dotted line).
