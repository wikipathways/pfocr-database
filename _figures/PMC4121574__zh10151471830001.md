caption: 'Using targeted and untargeted metabolomics to decipher enzyme and pathway
  functions. A and B: functional targeted and untargeted metabolomic platforms (A)
  have arisen to assist in characterizing the functions of metabolic enzymes in complex
  biological systems (B). In a typical functional metabolomic experiment, one can
  comparatively profile alterations in the metabolome, comparing a control group to
  impairment or overexpression of a given metabolic enzyme in a complex biological
  or disease sample. This experiment can be comparing groups such as wild-type (+/+)
  vs. knockout (−/−) samples, vehicle- vs. enzyme inhibitor-treated samples, shControl
  vs. shEnzyme, or control vs. enzyme overexpression. Elevated or reduced metabolites
  from blocking an enzyme will assist in assigning substrate/product relationships
  but also metabolic pathway connectivities.'
