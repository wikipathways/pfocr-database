caption: Illustration representing the sites of action of different polyphenols in
  asthma pathway. Hormonal fluctuations and airway epithelium damage trigger the secretion
  of IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP, which, in collaboration with dendritic cells, activate
  CD4+ T cells. This sequence leads to B cell stimulation of IgE production, activating
  mast cells and causing eosinophil expansion, resulting in asthma. The involvement
  of the NF-κB complex activates immune response genes, stimulating IgE and histamine
  release from mast cells. Histamine induces bronchoconstriction, contributing to
  asthma-related respiratory distress. The figure was designed by Biorender.com program
