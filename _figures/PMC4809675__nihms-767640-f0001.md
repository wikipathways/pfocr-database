caption: a | TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signalling is activated by both soluble and transmembrane
  TNF. TNFR1 bears a death domain that recruits the adaptor protein TNFR1-associated
  death domain protein (TRADD). Ligation of TNFR1 by soluble TNF or transmembrane
  TNF leads initially to the assembly of complex I, which activates nuclear factor
  κB (NFκB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). TNFR1–complex I signalling
  induces inflammation, tissue degeneration, cell survival and proliferation, and
  orchestrates the immune defence against pathogens. Alternative signalling modalities,
  associated with programmed cell death, can also be activated downstream of TNFR1.
  The formation of the complexes IIa and IIb (also known as ripoptosome) results in
  apoptosis, whereas complex IIc (necrosome) induces necroptosis and inflammation.
  b | TNFR2 is proposed to be fully activated primarily by transmembrane TNF, in the
  context of cell-to-cell interactions. TNFR2 recruits TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)
  via its TRAF domain, triggering the formation of complex I and the downstream activation
  of NFκB, MAPKs and AKT. TNFR2 mediates primarily homeostatic bioactivities including
  tissue regeneration, cell proliferation and cell survival. This pathway can also
  initiate inflammatory effects and host defence against pathogens. MLKL, mixed lineage
  kinase domain-like protein.
