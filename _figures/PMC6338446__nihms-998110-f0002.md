caption: Glioblastoma stem cells are characterized by self-renewal, the potential
  for specialization to multiple lineages and aberrant transdifferentiation. Wnt5A
  expression most likely activates the Wnt/Ca2+pathway via autocrine signalling, leading
  to their differentiation into endothelial-like cells. The lineage reprograming capacity
  of these cells remains a mystery. Will they respond to drugs targeting their endothelial-like
  phenotypes by going back to an undifferentiated state or switching their lineage?
  To what extent are the hallmarks of cancer stem cells preserved in these endothelial-like
  cells?
