caption: 'Schematic illustration of brain iron metabolism. Iron could cross BBB though
  endocytosis of holo-Tf followed by iron detached from Tf inside endosomes and FPN1-mediated
  iron efflux or transcytosis of holo-Tf through the BVECs. (1) Astrocyte: astrocytes
  could uptake Fe3+ via Tf-TfR1. DMT1, Zip14, and TRPC participate in Fe2+ absorption.
  Cp can oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ and then promote FPN1-mediated Fe2+ release. Iron can
  be stored in ferritin efficiently. (2) Microglia: Fe2+ could be transported via
  DMT1-mediated iron import and FPN1-mediated iron export. Microglia also can transfer
  Fe3+ ions to neurons by Lf/LfR-mediated pathway and store iron in ferritin. (3)
  Oligodendrocytes: iron is stored in oligodendrocytes mainly in the form of ferritin
  or Tf. Tf could be released from oligodendrocytes. Tim2-induced ferritin uptake
  is considered as the main mechanism for iron intake. Ferritin released from astrocyte
  and microglia promotes OPC maturation. BBB, blood–brain barrier; BVECs, brain capillary
  endothelial cells; Cp, ceruloplasmin; FPN1, ferroportin1; Lf/LfR, lactoferrin/lactoferrin
  receptor; NTBI, non-transferrin-bound iron; OPC, oligodendrocyte precursor cell;
  Tf/TfR1, transferrin/transferrin receptor 1; TRPC, resident transient receptor potential
  channel; Zip14, Zrt/Irt-like protein 14.'
