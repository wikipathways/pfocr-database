caption: Several different hypothetical mechanisms of PM2.5 pathogenicity. (A) PLA2R1
  has been demonstrated to be expressed in human respiratory epithelial cells. PM2.5
  is mainly composed of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals. After
  entering the respiratory tract, the alkalinization effect of PM2.5 on the airway
  may enhance the expression of PLA2R1. This conjecture has not been supported by
  direct evidence. (B) The oxidative stress response caused by PM2.5 in the respiratory
  system may cause changes in miRNAs. The promotion of ROS and the inhibition of miRNAs
  by PM2.5 may increase the expression of PLA2R1. (C) PAH components in PM2.5 have
  been shown to play a role in the imbalance of Th17/Treg ratio. This component uses
  AhR as a channel. It is not clear how AhR affects the enhancement of Th17 immune
  pathway, but miRNAs may be one of them.
