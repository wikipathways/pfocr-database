caption: The schematic model of O-GlcNAcylation regulating the Hippo pathway through
  other pathways that crosstalk with the Hippo pathway. The O-GlcNAcylation of β-catenin,
  a mediator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, competes with ubiquitinylation-inducing
  β-catenin phosphorylation, which may stabilize β-catenin and TAZ and promote β-catenin/TCF4
  complex-mediated YAP expression. Smad4 O-GlcNAcylation enhances the TGF-β/SMAD signaling
  pathway, which can upregulate SnoN gene expression, thereby inactivating LATS1/2
  by stabilizing Smad4. PKC O-GlcNAcylation is possibly related to TGF-β signaling
  in a way that TGFβRII expression is decreased by reducing PKC activities. In Gαs-coupled
  GPCR signaling, PKA O-GlcNAcylation may enhance LATS1/2 activity by increasing PKA-mediated
  LATS1/2 phosphorylation or inhibiting actin fiber formation. NOTCH1 O-GlcNAcylation
  elicits the release of NICD, which can stabilize YAP/TAZ, by enhancing the interaction
  between NOTCH1 and DLL1 or DLL4.
