caption: Nck proteins as the newly identified adaptors between the BCR complex and
  BCAP/PI3K/Akt pathway. After BCR crosslinking, Nck proteins bind to phosphorylated
  Tyr204 at the tail of Igα via their SH2 domains to recruit BCAP through their SH3
  domains. Nck may control BCR signaling by activating the BCAP/PI3K/Akt pathway and
  cross-talking with other pathways. BCAP, B-cell adaptor for PI3K; BCR, B-cell antigen
  receptor; Igα, immunoglobulin-α PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SH3, Src-homology
  3.
