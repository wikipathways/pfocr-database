caption: The hypothesized biosynthetic pathway of NM is schematically shown to proceed
  through four main phases. In the initial Phase 1, the oxidation products of DA,
  or the oxidized DA metabolites [], generated by catalytic oxidation mediated by
  Fe3+, or Cu2+, react with fibrillary seeds of aggregated peptides/proteins (blue)
  at the exposed side chains of Cys, His and Lys forming melanin (orange)-protein
  conjugates maintaining the fibrillary core as the only structural element. In Phase
  2, the undegradable conjugates are engulfed by the phagophore and isolated from
  the cytosol through a double lipid membrane (yellow). The autophagic vacuoles fuse
  with lysosomes (blue circle) in Phase 3, causing interaction between the melanin-protein
  conjugates with other proteins, enzymes and lipids carried by lysosomes, and are
  transformed into autolysosomes. The resulting autolysosomes fuses with other vesicles
  containing lipids that attach to melanin-protein conjugates to form NM. Finally,
  in Phase 4 these organelles fuse with other autophagic vacuoles containing NM precursors
  or with mature NM organelles. A more detailed description of the entire process
  can be found in Zucca et al., 2018 [].
