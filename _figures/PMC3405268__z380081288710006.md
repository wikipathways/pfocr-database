caption: Proposed mechanisms leading to increased contractile performance for the
  insulin-resistant, stressed hearts of HSD-fed rats. In presence of hyperglycemia
  and hyperinsulinemia, impaired insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt limits
  glucose transport into cardiac myocytes. Because insulin is known to stimulate the
  translocation of the fatty acid transporter CD36 at the sarcolemma (), insulin resistance
  is also likely to limit fatty acid uptake in the heart of HSD-fed rats. Both rates
  of glucose and fatty acid oxidation are increased in response to an acute increase
  in workload. However, glucose oxidation increases more than fatty acid oxidation,
  and combines to an improved mitochondrial energy coupling (reduced UCP3 levels)
  to increase contractile efficiency. The energetic response of the stressed heart
  may have been preserved by the impairment of insulin-stimulated fatty acid uptake,
  and the reduction of fatty acid-mediated inhibition of glucose oxidation. The increased
  coupling between glucose uptake and glucose oxidation limits the accumulation of
  glycolytic intermediates and their rerouting into the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This could increase the mechanical
  function of the heart by preserving the activity of contractile proteins and calcium
  homeostasis in cardiac myocytes. Dashed lines represent pathways with a reduced
  activity. Dotted lines represent possible consequences of insulin resistance that
  have not been tested directly in the present model.

  description: Proposed mechanisms leading to increased contractile performance for
    the insulin-resistant, stressed hearts of HSD-fed rats. In presence of hyperglycemia

    resistance is also likely to limit fatty acid uptake in the heart of HSD-fed rats.
    Both rates of glucose and fatty acid oxidation are increased in response to an
    acute increase in workload. However, glucose oxidation increases more than fatty
    acid oxidation, and combines to an improved mitochondrial energy coupling (reduced
    UCP3 levels) to increase contractile efficiency. The energetic response of the

    oxidation. The increased coupling between glucose uptake and glucose oxidation
    limits the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates and their rerouting into the
    pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP).
    This could increase the mechanical function of the heart by preserving the activity
    of contractile proteins and calcium homeostasis in cardiac myocytes. Dashed lines
