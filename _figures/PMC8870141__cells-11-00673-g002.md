caption: The influence of sympathetic nerves in establishing human immunodeficiency
  virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. (A) HIV-1 can infect cells of the immune system (e.g.,
  plasma dendritic cells (pDC); cytoplasm tan; nucleus, pink) via binding to Toll-like
  receptors (TLR)3/9, and activate their intracellular signaling pathway that induces
  the production of Type I interferons (IFNs), particularly IFN-β. HIV-1 infection
  increases sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) stimulating greater norepinephrine (green
  circles) transmitter release from sympathetic nerves that activate signal transduction
  (black box) in splenic plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Norepinephrine (NE) binding
  to β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-ARs) (gray semicircle) activates its intracellular
  signaling pathway (black box and arrow) that suppresses (black Xs) IFN-β secretion
  (red circles). Reduced IFN-β secretion by pDCs diminishes the suppressive effect
  of IFN-β on HIV-1 replication in HIV-1-infected splenic macrophages (black upward
  arrow). (B) The modulatory influence of β2-AR activation by NE on the intracellular
  signal transduction of virally-activated pattern recognition receptors (PRR)-induced
  stimulation of type I IFNs intracellular signaling pathway is illustrated. During
  acute HIV-1 infection, increased NE (green circles) ligation of β2-AR stimulates
  cAMP-induced protein kinase A (PKA) (yellow circle 1), which inhibits the cellular
  production of type I IFNs and secretion of IFN-β (yellow circle 2) and suppressed
  type I IFN disinhibits anti-viral replication in the nucleus (red arrow with     ),
  limits antiviral immunity and viral clearance (yellow circle 3), and increases production
  and cell surface expression CCR5 and CXCR4 (green arrow), receptors used by HIV-1
  to infect immune cells. Reduced secretion of IFN-β (black downward arrow) promotes,
  creates a permissive microenvironment for the HIV-1 infection in secondary immune
  organs by reducing innate antiviral immunity. During chronic infection in a rodent
  model of HIV-1 (when infection is well-established), sympathetic innervation of
  the spleen is lost (in part by chronic inflammation). The destruction of these nerves
  removes a major neural regulator of cellular and adaptive immunity, which contributes
  to an increase in the risk of opportunistic infection. Double black lines, plasma
  membrane PM; IRF-3, interferon regulatory factor 3—a transcription regulator of
  cellular responses essential for innate immunity; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B;
  C-C chemokine receptor type 5, CCR5; C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR-4).
