caption: Polyamine biosynthetic pathway in Leishmania parasites. The polyamine biosynthetic
  pathway in Leishmania is depicted with gray arrows. This pathway illustrates the
  sequential conversion of arginine to ornithine, putrescine, and spermidine, catalyzed
  by arginase (ARG), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), and spermidine synthase (SPDSYN),
  respectively. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (ADOMETDC) generates decarboxylated
  S-adenosylmethionine, which serves as the aminopropyl donor for spermidine synthesis.
  The two polyamines produced in Leishmania, putrescine and spermidine, are shown
  in uppercase. Unique to trypanosomatids is the reversible formation of trypanothione,
  catalyzed by the bidirectional enzyme trypanothione synthetase/amidase (TRYS) in
  Leishmania. The modification and activation of eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 5A (eIF5A) by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase
  (DOHH) occur in both Leishmania parasites and the human host. White arrows indicate
  the spermine synthase (SPMSYN) reaction and the simplified back-conversion pathway
  that is present in the mammalian host but absent in Leishmania
