caption: Therapeutics impacting lung macrophages (LMs). Macrolides increase the phagocytic
  ability of LMs, which could be related to an increase in mannose receptor expression
  (CD206) and involve the phosphoserine (PS) pathway [,,]. Statins regulate prenylation
  of the renin–angiotensin system (Ras) homolog family member (Rho)-guanosine triphosphatases
  (GTPases) that block 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase,
  decreasing the production of mevalonate and downstream prenylation substrates such
  as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Statins
  strengthen efferocytosis mediated by RhoA inhibition through GGPP in addition to
  lowering cholesterol through FPP []. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) increases the
  phagocytic ability of LMs via the Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac)
  1/2/3 signaling pathway, which mediates actin cytoskeleton rearrangement required
  for macrophage engulfment of apoptotic cells []. T-bar define blocking activity
