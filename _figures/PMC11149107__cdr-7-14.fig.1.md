caption: 'HER3 targeted therapies in the clinic and HER3 downstream signaling pathways.
  At present, the treatment strategies targeting HER3 in clinical trials mainly include
  monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates. Among
  them, monoclonal antibodies are the first developed agents with the most types.
  Since HER3 only has weak intracellular tyrosine kinase activity, HER3 is hard to
  be autophosphorylated but forms dimers with other receptors, including EGFR, HER2,
  and IGF-1R, especially HER2, and is phosphorylated by dimerization partner through
  transphosphorylation. HER2/HER3 dimers can activate PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and MEK/MAPK
  pathways, but the Src kinase pathway is predominantly mediated by the IGF-1R/HER3
  dimers. In addition, Src kinase and STAT protein can upregulate PI3K expression
  levels. Downstream effectors in the pathways such as mTOR, STAT, and MAPK can translocate
  into the nucleus and control the expression of multiple genes implicated in various
  processes involved in cancer development, such as cancer cell proliferation, survival,
  migration, invasion, apoptosis, differentiation, angiogenesis, cell cycle, and drug
  resistance. However, when antibodies bind to HER3 monomer or heterodimer, the signaling
  pathway downstream of HER3 is blocked, subsequently inhibiting the cancer progression.
