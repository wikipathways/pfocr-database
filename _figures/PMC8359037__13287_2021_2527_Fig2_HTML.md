caption: Molecular mechanisms and functions of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway
  in HFSCs. a In the absence of a Wnt signal for the binding of Wnt inhibitors (e.g.,
  sFRP1, Dkk3, or Wif), a multiprotein complex is formed with APC, Axin, and GSK3,
  which can target and phosphorylate β-catenin, leading to excessive cytoplasmic β-catenin
  degradation. b Once Wnt binds to Frizzled and lipoprotein receptor-related protein
  (Lrp5/6 receptors), the activated receptor complex induces recruitment of certain
  key components, such as Dvl, which results in the destruction complex disassembling,
  to prevent β-catenin degradation. Accumulated and stabilized β-catenin is translocated
  to the nucleus, where it can bind transcription factors (e.g., LEF/TCF family) to
  promote the expression of target genes, such as Axin2, LEF1 and Lgr5. c Wnt signalling
  shows a close association with HFSCs in quiescence, activation, and differentiation
  and even in Wnt-induced tumorigenesis. The T-shaped lines indicate inhibitory interactions
  involved in this pathway, and the solid arrows indicate activating interactions
