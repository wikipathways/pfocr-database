caption: Outline of cell cycle control and involvement of lncRNAs. The mammalian cell
  cycle is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their related pathways.
  CDKs are activated via binding to their selected cyclins in specific phases of the
  cell cycle, following which they phosphorylate their target proteins. The CDK inhibitors
  (CKIs) negatively regulate the activities of CDKs and control the cell cycle. pRB
  regulates G1/S progression. The p53 pathway plays a role in DNA damage response
  as a gatekeeper of the genome. Several lncRNAs control the expression of cyclins-CDKs,
  CKIs, pRB and p53, and participate in cell cycle regulation. Some of these lncRNAs
  are induced by DNA damage and inhibit cell cycle progression by regulating these
  cell cycle regulators
