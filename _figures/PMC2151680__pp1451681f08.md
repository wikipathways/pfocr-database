caption: Illustration of function of PsbI during PSII assembly and repair. De novo
  assembly of PSII (large black arrows) starts with association of PsbI (I) with pD1
  (step 1A) forming pD1-PsbI precomplex on one side, and association of Cyt b-559
  protein subunits α and β (E and F) with the D2 protein forming Cyt b-559-D2 precomplex
  on the other side (step 1B). Assembly continues by formation of the RC complex from
  both precomplexes (step 2). Then CP47 (step 3) and CP43 (step 4) are attached and
  resulting PSII core monomers RCC(1) form the PSII core dimer [RCC(2), step 5]. PSII
  repair cycle (white arrows) starts with inactivation of the D1 protein and monomerization
  (step 6). Then it continues by detachment of CP43 and selective replacement of the
  D1 protein (step 7). The final two steps, the CP43 attachment and PSII dimerization,
  seem to be common with the de novo assembly pathway. PsbI is important for processes
  of formation of pD1-PsbI precomplex (step 1A) and attachment of CP43 to RC47 (step
  4) as indicated by encircled arrows. For simplicity, other small and extrinsic PSII
  subunits were omitted. pD1, Unprocessed forms of D1; iD1, partially processed forms
  of D1.
