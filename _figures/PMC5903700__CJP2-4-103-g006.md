caption: Schematic diagram summarising the biological processes underlying the association
  of the 35‐gene expression signature with PTEN/AKT signalling pathways. Notably,
  PKR has been reported to be important for the tumour suppressive activity of PTEN,
  independent of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway . We hypothesized that this could
  be modulated by several genes within our gene signature. TPT1 has been previously
  reported to modulate the expression of PKR . Apart from TPT1, actins and troponin‐associated
  factors from the 35‐gene expression signature (TPM2, ACTA2, and ACTG2) were also
  reported to induce the activation of PKR. The dotted lines in the diagram thus signify
  biological associations between genes within our signature and its possible association
  with PKR that warrant further investigation.
