caption: Pathways regulating Leydig cell division activated by soy isoflavones. Present
  results indicate that the mitogenic action of genistein is mediated by estrogen
  receptors acting in concert with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT (PIK3/AKT)
  signal transduction pathway and the pathway mediated by MAPK. ESR-genistein complexes
  may act through estrogen-response elements in the nucleus to regulate gene expression
  and/or induce protein-protein interactions in the PIK3/AKT- and MAPK-mediated signaling
  pathways to influence kinase activation affecting cell-cycle progression. Modulation
  of proliferative activity in developing Leydig cells potentially alters the number
  of Leydig cells in the adult testis and affects intratesticular and serum testosterone
  (T) levels. N, nucleus.
