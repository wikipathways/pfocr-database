caption: The distribution of S1P is strictly controlled and involved in innate and
  adaptive immunity. S1P is distributed in low concentration in organ tissues, and
  in the blood circulation, S1P presents the characteristics of high-level distribution.
  In the innate immune response, S1P plays a role through the receptors on various
  immune cells, such as in TLRS, activating the NF-KB signaling pathway, promoting
  the release of a variety of pro-inflammatory factors, inhibiting immune responses
  in macrophages, and reducing migration and apoptosis in neutrophils. In the adaptive
  immune response, under the action of APC, T cells are differentiated and produce
  anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, S1P inhibits LPS-induced B cell inflammatory
  responses and promotes B cell migration and transport
