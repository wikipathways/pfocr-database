caption: Schematic illustration of the two possible pathways by which MUC1 regulates
  MRP1 gene expression in PC cells. In human PC cell lines, Capan-1 and BxPC3 MUC1,
  MUC1-induced ABCC1 gene expression is dependent on PI3K/Akt pathway. The CT of MUC1
  stimulates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which in turn increases MUC1 expression (left panel).
  In murine PC cell line, KCM, MUC1-induced MRP1 expression is independent of the
  PI3K/Akt pathway (right panel). The CT of MUC1 translocates to the nucleus and binds
  to the promoter of ABCC1/Abcc1 gene, possibly acting as a part of the transcriptional
  complex that drives the expression of this gene (left and right panels).
