caption: 'Perspective on targeting copper metabolism for the treatment of hepatocellular
  carcinoma. A: Copper metabolism in hepatocytes. Copper metabolism in hepatocytes
  is regulated by a network of copper transporters and chaperons. Following copper
  uptake mediated by the influx copper transporter, hCtr1, copper is transported intracellularly
  by copper chaperons and copper homeostasis is maintained by the outflow of copper
  mediated by the efflux copper transporter, ATP7B; B: Targeting copper metabolism
  for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Copper is required for cell
  proliferation and may play a role in the signaling transduction pathway regulating
  proliferation of HCC cells. Targeting copper metabolism with copper chelators has
  been tested for anti-copper therapy of HCC, with variable response. RNAi-mediated
  knockdown of hCtr1 and/or other copper chaperons is a potential new approach for
  targeted anti-copper gene therapy of HCC. Furthermore, ionic 64CuCl2 or 67CuCl2
  have potential as new radiopharmaceuticals for systemic radionuclide therapy of
  HCC, based on increased 64Cu uptake of HCC visualized on preclinical PET/CT images.
