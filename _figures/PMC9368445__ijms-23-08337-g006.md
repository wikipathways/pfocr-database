caption: 'Schematic of mevalonic pathway and illustration of the inhibition effect
  of simvastatin on Brucella invasion through suppression of mevalonate pathway. Simvastatin
  inhibits the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, leading to the inhibition of GGPP
  and FPP synthesis, which regulates the prenylation of some GTPase such as Ras and
  Rho families (A). Inhibiting GTPase synthesis caused by simvastatin treatment affects
  the activation of GTPase lead to the reduced B. abortus internalization into RAW
  264.7 cells (B). Abbreviations: HMG-CoA: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A;
