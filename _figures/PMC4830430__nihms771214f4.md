caption: In response to DNA damage signaling, ATM activates the NF-κB signaling pathway
  (NF-κB binds to target gene promoters) and concomitantly phosphorylates PPM1G (P),
  which in turn dephosphorylates and releases the P-TEFb kinase from the promoter-bound
  7SK snRNP complex. Upon its release, dephosphorylated P-TEFb becomes re-phosphorylated
  and activated, and thus acts on paused Pol II to induce the transcriptional pause
  release. After releasing P-TEFb, the inhibitory snRNP subunits are evicted from
  chromatin, and phosphorylated PPM1G (P-S183) binds 7SK RNA along with Hexim (7SK-PPM1G
  snRNP) to prevent the re-association of P-TEFb back into the snRNP to sustain transcription
  elongation. Once the damage is resolved, this regulatory circuitry subsides, PPM1G
  is dislodged from the snRNP (through a yet unknown mechanism), and P-TEFb recycled
  back to promote the formation of the inhibitory 7SK snRNP at the promoter-proximal
  region, thereby blocking Pol II pause release. The arrow indicates the position
  of the TSS.
