caption: The haem biosynthesis pathway. Endogenous aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is synthesised
  in the mitochondria and acts as an early substrate for the haem biosynthesis pathway.
  The penultimate molecule protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) displays bright red fluorescence
  when excited by blue/violet light. Exogenous ALA preferentially accumulates in neoplastic
  cells leading to an accumulation of PpIX that can be exploited for biophotonic diagnostics.
