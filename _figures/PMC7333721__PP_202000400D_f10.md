caption: A model of how CWIN-mediated extracellular sugar signaling may be sensed
  at the plasma membrane and transduced to the intracellular space to modulate downstream
  pathways to regulate ovule initiation. In Arabidopsis gynoecia, Suc is unloaded
  symplasmically through PD for ovule primordium formation. Some Suc must have escaped
  to the cell wall for hydrolysis by CWIN into Glc and Fru. Silencing of CWIN would
  result in changes in the extracellular sugar level or flux, thereby generating sugar
  signal, which may be sensed by (1) RLKs transmitted through a small GTPase (Rop)
  into the cytoplasm that regulate gene expression in the nucleus and (2) HXTs, including
  clade I and II SWEETs and H+/Hex symporters, to control cytosolic hexose level and
  sugar homeostasis, which may then be sensed by hexokinase or other proteins to regulate
  downstream gene expression. In this study, the expression of CWIN gene was silenced
  in the ovule initiating region. This genetic intervention reduced the expression
  of hexose/H+ symporters and SWEETs for hexoses and likely their activities, thereby
  affecting intracellular sugar homeostasis and signaling. In parallel, expression
  of RLKs and Rops was increased and decreased, respectively, in response to CWIN
  silencing, suggesting a disturbance of the RLK-Rop-mediated signaling pathway. Both
  scenarios could disrupt downstream molecular pathways required for ovule initiation,
  including genes encoding MADS TFs, such as STK, and the early auxin signaling proteins,
  SAURs, leading to blockage of ovule initiation. Solid and dash-dotted lines indicate
  known and predicted pathways, respectively.
