caption: Defence-related genes in various cellular locations are differentially expressed
  in response to infection by Vibrio coralliilyticus and pre-treatment of the probiotic
  combination at 18 hours post-fertilization in C. gigas larvae. The arrows represent
  either an increase or decrease in gene expression caused by the exposure to the
  probiotic combination alone, V. coralliilyticus alone, V. coralliilyticus in addition
  to the probiotic treatment, or all three bacterial treatment groups. Pattern recognition
  receptors bind to the bacteria, sending an inflammatory signal through the NF-kB
  and toll-like signalling cascades. The activated NF-kB transcription factor leads
  to the production of cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and immune effectors. Meanwhile,
  the tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3-like prevents activation of NF-kB
  transcription by inhibiting upstream signalling. The 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory
  subunit 10 binds to the NF-kB transcription factor and retains it in the cytosol
  as a negative regulator of the NF-kB signalling pathway. Additionally, the serine/threonine-protein
  kinase RIO3 inhibits NF-kB transcription, regulating inflammatory signalling. The
  immune effector serine protease inhibitor Cvsi2 directly interacts with endocytosed
  bacteria. Cell-surface mucins are produced and used as an inflammatory barrier of
  the cell. Apoptosis is enabled by the cell death-inducing p53-target protein 1 but
  inhibited by the baculoviral IAP repeat-containing proteins 2, 3, and 7.
