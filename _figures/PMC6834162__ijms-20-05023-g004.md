caption: MTX affects several signal transduction pathways implicated in the pathogenesis
  of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Dysfunctional intracellular signaling involving deregulated
  activation of the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription
  (JAK/STAT) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation pathways play a critical role
  in RA. MTX seems to be a potent suppressor of JAK/STAT signaling pathway which is
  responsible for the transduction of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated
  in the pathogenesis of RA. MTX reduces JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, and STAT5 phosphorylation.
  Low dose MTX strongly suppresses levels of phosphorylated STAT5. Moreover, MTX-mediated
  ROS production activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Jun-N-terminal
  kinase (JNK), and JNK-dependent induction of p53, which is the final mediator of
  inhibition of NF-κB activation. NF-κB is involved in inflammation, immune response
  and cell proliferation and survival. MTX-mediated JNK activation also activates
  prototypical JNK downstream targets, c-JUN and c-FOS, components of the AP-1 complex
  which is involved in the increased expression of pro apoptotic genes (such as TNF-α,
  Fas-L, and Bak) mediating increased sensitivity of cells to apoptosis.
