caption: Processing of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) via the amyloidogenic or
  non-amyloidogenic pathway. In the amyloidogenic pathway, AβPP undergoes sequential
  cleavage first by BACE1 or BACE2 to generate a C99 fragment, which is then cleaved
  by γ-secretase to release Aβ42. This Aβ42 is aggregate prone and can form neurotoxic
  plaques that are implicated in the amyloid cascade hypothesis to cause Alzheimer’s
  disease. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, Aβ42 can undergo further degradation
  by BACE2, which can also function as an Aβ-degrading protease (AβDP). The degradation
  products include non-toxic Aβ species Aβ19, Aβ20, and Aβ34. In addition, AβPP can
  be either cleaved by BACE2 at the θ-site, or by α-secretase to generate a C80 or
  C83 fragment, respectively. These C-terminal fragments undergo further cleavage
  by γ-secretase to release the AβPP intracellular domain (AICD) and a short fragment
  P3. In this case, no Aβ42 is generated. [Parts of the figure were drawn by using
