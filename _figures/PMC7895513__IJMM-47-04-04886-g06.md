caption: Schematic diagram of the regulatory effects of PCSK9 on endothelial cell
  pyroptosis by increasing ROS production via the inhibition of UQCRC1. PCSK9 leads
  to mitochondrial dysfunction through the inhibition of the subunit UQCRC1, and this
  promotes the production of ROS. ROS improves the action of NLRP3, which recruits
  caspase-1 and promotes inflammatory cytokine maturation and cellular pore formation.
  PCSK9, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9; UQCRC1, ubiquinol-cytochrome
  c reductase core protein 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin
  domain containing 3.
