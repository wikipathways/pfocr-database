caption: Proposed mechanism of immune dysregulation in diabetes-related liver fibrosis.
  This figure summarizes key immune cells, cytokines, and related pathways (TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB
  and IL-17/IL-23 axis) implicated in the progression of MAFLD/NAFLD, particularly
  MASH/NASH with fibrosis. Diabetes-induced ROS and AGEs drive steatosis, inflammation,
  and hepatocyte ballooning, promoting fibrosis which may be regulated by monocytes/macrophages
  and T cells [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34]. Created with BioRender.com
