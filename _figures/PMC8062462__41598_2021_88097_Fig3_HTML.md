caption: The accumulation of lipids is linked to alterations in the 1C cycle but not
  to the TCA pathway derived metabolites in the lung of HFHSD mice. Schematic diagram
  of 1C (methionine plus folate cycles) and TCA cycles, their subcellular compartmentations
  (mitochondrion in pink) and their potential link with de novo lipogenesis,. HFHSD
  causes significant modifications in 1C-derived metabolites in the lung and serum,
  and a significant modification in TCA-derived metabolites only in serum. Modified
  metabolites are represented in red, unmodified in green and non-detected in black.
  1C-derived metabolites were also altered in other organ and specifically in the
  liver but were not represented here.
papertitle: Dietary obesity in mice is associated with lipid deposition and metabolic
  shifts in the lungs sharing features with the liver.
