caption: 'Pathway analysis of hepatic genes differentially regulated by 17β-trenbolone:
  Impacts on metabolic pathways. Connections between significantly up or down-regulated
  genes in the liver and enriched Biological Processes from human homolog data were
  visualized. The red color represents up-regulation by TB and blue color represents
  down-regulation by TB compared to the samples exposed to the vehicle control. The
  intensity of the color is correlated with the degree of differential regulation.
  Red solid lines represent positive regulation of gene expression, blue solid lines
  represent negative regulation of gene expression, and grey solid lines represent
  unknown direction of regulation. Oval shapes represent individual genes and boxes
  represent GO Biological Processes. Gene abbreviations: COX2: cyclooxygenase II;
  CYBA: cytochrome b-245, alpha polypeptide; CYBB: cytochrome b-245, beta polypeptide;
  CYB5A: cytochrome b5 type A (microsomal); CYC1: cytochrome c-1;CYCS: cytochrome
  c, somatic; CYGB: cytoglobin; CYP(number)(letter)(number) for all entries: cytochrome
  P450, family number, subfamily letter, polypeptide variant number; DOCK2: dedicator
  of cytokinesis 2; EPX: eosinophil peroxidase; GUCY1B3: guanylate cyclase 1, soluble,
  beta 3;MB: myoglobin; MPO: myeloperoxidase; NOS1: nitric oxide synthase 1; NOX5:
  NADPH oxidase, EF-hand calcium binding domain 5; PRDX1: peroxiredoxin 1; SDHC: succinate
  dehydrogenase complex, subunit C, integral membrane protein, 15 kDa; TDO2: tryptophan
  2,3-dioxygenase.'
