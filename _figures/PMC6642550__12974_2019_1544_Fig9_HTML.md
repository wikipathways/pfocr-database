caption: CNS (central nervous system), NTS (nucleus tractus solitarii), HPT (hypothalamus),
  PTG (pituitary gland), ADC (adrenal cortex), BBB (blood-brain barrier), CVO (circumventricular
  organs), GLU (glutamate), GABA (gamma-aminobutric acid), PGE2 (prostaglandin E2),
  Ach (acetylcholine), GCs (corticosteroids), IL-1β (interleukin 1β), IL-6 (interleukin
  6), TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor α), upwards arrow (increase/green), downwards arrow
  (decrease/red), solid lines (afferent signaling), dotted lines (efferent signaling),
  gray lines (inactive pathways), black lines (active pathways). At physiological
  conditions (a), afferent vagal signaling provides an appropriate level of stimulating
  GLU within the NTS []. In the case of peripheral inflammation (b), the afferent
  of the vagus nerve is stimulated among others by IL-1β, that activating COX-2 and
  PGE2 synthesis in the presynaptic terminals of this fibers in within the NTS [,
  ]. PGE2 secreted by the vagus nerve stimulates other neurons in the NTS to secrete
  additional portions of GLU. This mechanism permits quick “detection” of peripheral
  inflammation and rapid “launching” of the HPA axis. This signal is also transmitted
  to the other CNS structures, resulting in specific changes in activity of neurotransmission
  systems, which, while remaining physiologically balanced, allows for a correct central
  reaction to the inflammation development. When inflammatory mediators reach the
  brain via the bloodstream (c), they stimulate vascular endothelial cells, tissue
  macrophages, and glial cells in the brain to release PGE2, which stimulates NTS
  cells to release GLU []. Glutamatergic information from the vagus nerve becomes
  unnecessary and could threaten to overstimulate (glutamate excitotoxicity, []),
  which is why it is limited by PGE2 acting on the EP3 receptors on the presynaptic
  membrane of the afferent endings of the vagus nerve []. It is possible that when
  afferent vagal signaling is absent (d), GLU concentration in the NTS may be chronically
  decreased. This could lead to disturbances in the functioning of major neurotransmitter
  systems. As demonstrated in our experiment, in some brain areas, serotonergic activity
  decreased. There was also a strong increase in extracellular dopamine metabolism
  likely secondary to a lack of glutamatergic stimulation of inhibitory GABAergic
  neurons. It is also possible that brain releases additional portions of the neurotransmitter
  (dopamine) into the synaptic cleft, to maintain the neural activity at an appropriate,
  physiological level, thus compensating for the insufficient level of GLU in NTS.
  Under such conditions, when infection appears in the periphery (e), limited sensory
  and immunosuppressive functions of the vagus nerve renders delayed detection of
  the infection. This may lead to the aforementioned significant increase in PGE2
  in blood plasma. The inflammatory signal is transferred to the brain through the
  BBB and CVO (f) causing an increase in the GLU content in NTS, and then an apparent
  “normalization” of the neurotransmitter activity of the limbic system areas. The
  HPA axis is also activated. This model is supported by fact that PGE2 is necessary
  to cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway functioning []
