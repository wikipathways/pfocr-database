caption: Role of Osteoblasts in Rheumatoid Arthritis Pathway. There were 234 genes
  in this pathway with 12 downregulated (or hypermethylated) and 12 upregulated (or
  hypomethylated) genes. Other genes are predicted to change as described in the Prediction
  Legend in Figure 6. Other predicted upregulated and downregulated genes affecting
  osteoclasts and chondrocytes in this pathway can be found in Figures S4 and S5
