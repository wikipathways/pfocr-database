caption: 'A possible pathway for EKC-induced methuosis suggested by the present studies:
  EKC caused abnormal macropinocytosis. In the presence of EKC, Rac1 was activated
  and resulted in the stimulation of macropinosome formation. At the same time, Arf6
  was inactivated which impeded the process of endosome returning to the plasma membrane.
  The abnormal macropinocytosis underwent homotypic fusion and formed huge vacuoles.
  These vacuoles failed to fuse with lysosomes and were degraded, resulting in methuosis
  ultimately.'
