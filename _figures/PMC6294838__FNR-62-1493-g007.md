caption: The signaling pathway of defensins and interleukins gene expression is regulated
  by PBA in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. Sodium phenyl butyrate (PBA) activated
  the NF-κB pathway via the phosphorylation of p65 and IκB α synthesis delayed and
  degraded. TLR2, TLR4, and EGFR were required for the PBA-mediated up-regulation
  of the HDPs. Meanwhile, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition and an increased phosphorylation
  of histone H3 on serine S10 also occurred in PBA-induced HDP expression independently
  on TLR2 and TLR4. Furthermore, p38-MAPK suppressed PBA-induced pEP2C, pBD-1, pBD-3,
  IL-8, and IL-18 expression, and ERK1/2 abolished the regulation of pEP2C and pBD-1.
  In conclusion, HDPs and interleukins expression were regulated by PBA via a complex
  route system.
