caption: De novo and salvage pathway for purine synthesis. PRPP generated from glycolysis
  and pentose phosphate pathway (green) serves as substrate for de novo purine synthesis
  (blue background). After 10-step reaction catalysed by six enzymes with different
  functional domains, IMP is produced as the end of de novo pathway. Salvage pathway
  (orange background) is mainly catalysed by two enzymes, namely HPRT and APRT. In
  this pathway, PRPP is also needed, and several nucleosides serve as co-substrates
  for the production of nucleotides. The final metabolite uric acid is further oxidised
  by uricase (grey), which is expressed in most organisms but lost in humans and a
  part of primates
