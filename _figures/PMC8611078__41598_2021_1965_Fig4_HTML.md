caption: Canonical pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in vapers and
  smokers by IPA. (A) Comparison Analysis was used to identify trends or similarities
  and differences across the datasets. The heatmap shows the top twenty canonical
  pathways impacted in vapers and smokers (based on P-value), allowing a direct comparison
  between the two groups. (B) The ‘CCR5 signaling in macrophages’ pathway was the
  top dysregulated pathway in vapers (P = 2.15E−04). Affected molecules include CACNA2D2,
  CCL3/MIP1α, CCL4/MIP1β, and GNG11. (C) The ‘Oxidative phosphorylation’ pathway was
  the top disrupted pathway in smokers (P = 2.80E−06). Affected molecules include
  ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, and ND5 (Complex I), Cyt b (Complex III), CO1, CO2, and
  CO3 (Complex IV), and ATP6 (Complex V). In both cases, Molecule Activity Predictor
  (MAP) analysis was used to predict how up-regulated and down-regulated genes in
  the datasets (red and green nodes, respectively) can affect the activity of other
  molecules on the pathway. For clarity, the affected genes are indicated by asterisks
  in the two pathways. Orange nodes, prediction of activation; blue nodes, prediction
  of inhibition.
