caption: Signal transduction pathway mediated through CLEC-2. Overall, the signal
  transduction pathway is strikingly similar to that of GPVI, involving a number of
  signaling molecules related to tyrosine kinases. Upon association with its agonists,
  CLEC-2 assumes multimerization, and Syk and Src family kinases mediates tyrosine
  phosphorylation of its hemITAM, which is followed by downstream signals culminating
  in PLCγ2 activation. Signaling molecules required for full activation of platelets
  are marked in red, those which are partially required are marked in orange, and
  those which can be spared are marked in yellow
