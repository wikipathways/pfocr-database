caption: 'The quiescent endothelium shown on the left wall of the vein is an antithrombotic
  surface. Endothelial cells prevent or limit coagulation through expression of heparan
  sulfate, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), CD39, and CD73, as well as release
  of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), prostacyclin and nitric oxide. Additionally,
  expression of endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and thrombomodulin (TM) exert
  anti-inflammatory effects and negatively regulate thrombin generation. Shown on
  the right wall of the vein, endothelial cells, in response to injury or functional
  perturbations, endothelial cells undergo shift to prothrombotic surface. There are
  increased expression leukocyte adhesion molecules (P- and E-selectin) and tissue
  factor (TF), loss of vascular integrity and expression of antithrombotic molecules,
  and production of cytokines. (Illustration credit: Erina He).'
