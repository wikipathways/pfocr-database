  TNF-α-activated TNFR1 forms Complex I by recruiting RIPK1, TRADD, cIAP1/2, and TRAF2.
  In Complex I, RIPK1 is ubiquitinated by cIAP1/2 and eventually activates NF-κB signaling
  pathway. In the presence of Smac mimetic, which leads to the degradation of cIAPs,
  RIPK1 is disassociated from Complex I and deubiquitinated by CYLD, followed by interacting
  with FADD and procaspase-8 to form a cytosolic protein complex (Complex II). This
  complex activates caspase-8 and eventually leads to apoptosis. When caspase-8 activity
  is inhibited, RIPK1 interacts with RIPK3 to form a protein complex (necrosome) via
  their respective RHIM domains, leading to activation of both RIPK1 and RIPK3. Activated
  RIPK3 further phosphorylates MLKL, which forms oligomerization and translocates
  to the plasma membrane for the execution of necroptosis. The necroptotic cells finally
  release cellular contents including DAMPs, which act as endogenous danger signals
  to elicit inflammatory responses. The RHIM-dependent interaction between RIPK3 and
  RIPK1 is also required for IFNα/β/γ-induced necroptosis. Furthermore, RIPK3 can
  be activated through interacting with other RHIM-containing proteins such as TRIF,
  DAI, and the viral protein ICP6. In TLR3 or TLR4-induced necroptosis, TRIF is recruited
  to RIPK3 through their RHIM domains. During infection of MCMV or influenza A virus,
  DAI activates RIPK3 to induce necroptosis. In the mouse cells infected with HSV-1/2,
  binding of ICP6/10 to mouse RIPK3 leads to the activation of RIPK3 and necroptosis.
  However, in the human natural host cells, ICP6/10 also can interact with human RIPK3,
  and this association results in the inactivation of RIPK3. Necroptosis can be inhibited
  by Nec-1 (RIPK1 inhibitor), GSK872 (RIPK3 inhibitor), and NSA (human MLKL inhibitor).
