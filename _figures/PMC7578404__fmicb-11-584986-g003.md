caption: Summary of the effect of S. Enteritidis 45 min exposure to EWF (A,B) on selected
  metabolic pathways. Transporters are symbolized by gray ovals. Up-regulated, down-regulated,
  and non-regulated genes are represented in red, green or black, respectively. Genes
  with a ≥4-fold change in expression are in bold. The metabolites predicted to be
  increased are underlined. Up-regulated, down-regulated and non-regulated pathways
  are represented by thick, broken, or fine arrows, respectively. Genes with different
  expression levels between the incubation in EWMM (from ) and in EWF are boxed in
  pink. Metabolic pathway data were obtained from KEGG (www.genome.jp/kegg).
