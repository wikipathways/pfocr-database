caption: Proximal T-cell signaling cascade. Proximal signaling pathways downstream
  of the T-cell receptor (TCR)-antigen presenting cell (APC)ignaling complex (as described
  in ) are responsible for the cascade of events leading to metabolic reprogramming
  including the transcription of amino acid transporter and enzymes involved in metabolism
  of nutrients and biosynthesis of polyamines []. Phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the cytoplasmic side of the TCR/CD3
  complex engage numerous cascading interactions largely mediated by phosphorylation,
  dephosphorylation or ubiquitinylation resulting in cellular activation []. The initiating
  signal is generated by lymphocyte protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) and other proto-oncogene
  tyrosine-protein kinase (Src) family tyrosine kinases including the zeta-chain associated
  protein kinase (Zap-70) that is recruited to the TCR/CD3 complex. Costimulation
  through leukocyte-associated antigen-1 (LFA1) which is an integrin involved in T-cell
  migration or CD28 interaction with CD80 (B7-1) or CD86 (B7-2) (see also ) activates
  the phosphorylation of the YXXM or YNPP signaling motifs [] which regulates glucose
  metabolism. CD28 leads to stable recruitment of the adaptor protein Grb2/GADS along
  with interleukin-2-indicible T-cell kinase (Itk), Lck, and phosphatidylinositide
  3 kinase (PI3K) heterodimer p85/p110 and SLP76. These interactions promote the activation
  of VAV-1, RasGRP, and the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk pathway downstream of phosphorylated SLP-76
  and Zap-70 modulating the TCR signal strength []. A complement of transcription
  factors nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB), Fox family transcription factor c-Fos, Jun (when in combination
  with c-Fos forms the AP-1 early response transcription factor complex, nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), an NFκB family member c-Rel,
  and c-Myc which coordinately regulate gene expression. Activation of CD28 leads
  to the phosphorylation of PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3,4 bisphosphate (PIP2) and
  phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) [] which integrates the TCR and CD28
  signaling to induce the NFκB pathway including protein kinase C-theta (PKC-θ), and
  inhibits the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl [] leading to activation of Bcl10, Malt1, Carma1
  (CBM) complex leading to IKKαβγ activation of NFκB and REL []. In addition to PKC-θ,
  phosphorylation of Akt is critical for the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes
  of mTOR that bind GβL and raptor or rictor, respectively [,]. This is a critical
  step in c-Myc-dependent transcriptional regulation that stimulates dramatic changes
  in metabolism including glucose, amino acid, nucleotide and polyamine biosynthesis
  [,]. Divalent cations such as calcium (Ca2+) are induce downstream of phospholipase
  C γ1, PIP2, and indo inositol-1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3) which mobilizes the release
  of intracellular Ca2+ stores from the endoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+-ER) a potential
  metabolic switch that suppresses intratumoral T-cell function []. Sustained signaling
  then promotes the influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the cells through calcium release-activated
  Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. Calcium-calmodulin interactions (Ca2+/CaM) then activates
  the phosphatase calcineurin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type
  IV calmodulin (CaMKIV), which dephosphorylates the cytoplasmic subunits of nuclear
  factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) exposing a nuclear localization signal resulting
  in nuclear transport and phosphorylates CREB, respectively.
