caption: A) Red, up-regulated proteins; green, significantly downregulated proteins;
  white, proteins known to be in the network but not identified in our study. The
  color depth indicates the magnitude of the change in protein expression levels.
  The shapes are indicative of the molecular class (i.e., protein family). B) IPA
  showing the pathways might involve in EBR-induced cellular alterations, C. tunicamycin,
  as an anticancer agent causing a similar effect. Lines connecting the molecules
  indicate molecular relationships. The arrow styles indicate specific molecular relationships
  and the directionality of the interaction. Reprinted from Ingenuity Pathways Analysis
