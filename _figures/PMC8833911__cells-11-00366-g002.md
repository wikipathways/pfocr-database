caption: Simplified model of the transport cycle of CLC transporters based on the
  work of Leisle et al. []. Cl− ions at the external and central binding sites are
  represented as blue circles, H+ are represented as red circles, the anion permeation
  pathway is shown in pale blue, the H+ permeation pathway in green. The gating and
  proton glutamates and the phenyalanine residues are explicitly indicated in the
  figure. (a) The gating glutamate is oriented towards the extracellular space and
  its side chain protonated. Cl− ions are present at both the external and central
  binding site. (b) The protonated gating glutamate rotates towards the interior of
  the protein along a pathway defined by two phenylalanine residues. (c) The protonated
  gating glutamate continues its movement towards the central binding site displacing
  a Cl− ion towards the extracellular space. (d) The H+ dissociates from the side
  chain of the gating glutamate. (e) The H+ binds the proton glutamate and the side
  chain of the gating glutamate moves upwards to occupy the external anion binding
  site displacing a second Cl− ion. Not explicitly indicated is an intermediate state
  following proton release to the cytosolic side in which Cl− ions from the internal
  side have access to the permeation pathway.
