caption: PGA1 binds to cysteine 118 of Ras and induces Ras·GTP loading and Raf/MEK/ERK/Elk1
  pathway activation. Overexpression of Sprouty2 (Spry2) wt or Spry2 P59A P304A double
  mutant (unable to bind Grb2) block cyP and FGF-elicited ERK phosphorylation but
  not Ras activation, probably due to an effect on Raf signaling. However, Spry2 Y55F
  mutant does not inhibit cyP and FGF-induced ERK pathway activation, although treatment
  with PGA1 was unable to promote tyrosine-phosphorylation of Spry2; in sharp contrast,
  RTK activation (mainly EGFR) provokes tyrosine-phosphorylation of Spry2 (at Y55
  residue) increasing its binding affinity to the SH2 domain of c-Cbl, which leads
  to Spry2 ubiquitination.
