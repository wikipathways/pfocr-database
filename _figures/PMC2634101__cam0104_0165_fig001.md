caption: A model summarizing some of the pathways described in this review leading
  to chemotaxis and cell motility. A number of parallel pathways are activated upon
  receptor binding chemoattractant, including PI3K, PLC, PLA2, GC and ras (red arrows).
  The PI3K pathway (activated directly and also via ras and rac) results in increased
  PIP3, producing activated small G proteins cdc42 and rac, both of which have been
  shown to activate actin polymerization through WASP/WAVE family protein stimulation
  of the Arp2/3 complex. The PLC pathway releases cofilin bound to PIP2, allowing
  it to cleave actin and stimulate new barbed ends for actin polymerization. PTEN,
  a PIP3 phosphatase which can be localized by PIP2, is more concentrated towards
  the rear of the cell, helping to reinforce a gradient of PIP3 in the cell membrane
  that is highest near the front of the cell. Ca released by the PLC product IP3 synergizes
  with the activation of PLA2 for stimulation of chemotaxis as discussed in the text
  (the direct downstream targets of PLA2 are still unclear but one downstream response
  is actin polymerization). Activation of ras also stimulates MAP kinase activity.
  Pathways stimulated by MAP kinase include activation of MLCK, resulting in contractility
  (in part via stress fibers), as well as calpain activation, resulting in cleavage
  of integrins for detachment. Activation of GC leads to increased cGMP, also producing
  increased MLCK activity and cell contraction. The net result is a bias towards activation
  of actin polymerization on the side of the cell closest to the chemoattractant source
  and detachment/contraction on the side away from the stimulus, producing cell polarization,
  protrusion and chemotactic movement.
