caption: Involvement of ROS in normal stem cell quiescence and self-renewal. In normal
  stem cells, modulation of ROS levels can determine quiescence and cell fate progression.
  At low ROS levels, which are maintained by ATM and FoxO signaling, stem cells remain
  quiescent and self-renewal activity is enhanced. On the other hand, increased ROS
  levels result in cell cycle progression, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. The
  PI3K-AKT pathway is known to elevate ROS levels by negative regulation of FoxO.
