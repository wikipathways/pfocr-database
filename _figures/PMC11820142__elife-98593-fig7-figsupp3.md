caption: Host factors secreted from innate immune cells upon Toll-like receptor (TLR)
  ligands stimulation, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-1α, act on both severe
  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected cells expressing
  spike protein and neighboring cells expressing ACE2 receptor via IL-1R1-MyD88-IRAK-TRAF6
  signaling pathway, which leads to strong enrichment of activated RhoA at cell-cell
  junction, resulting in the formation of ROCK-mediated actin bundle to prevent SARS-CoV-2-induced
  cell-cell fusion and further viral transmission through syncytia formation

  viral transmission via induction of actin bundles
