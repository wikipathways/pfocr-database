caption: LGR5 potentiates the WNT–β-catenin signaling pathway that maintains the stem-cell-like
  phenotype, impeding cellular differentiation. (a) In the presence of LGR5 and RSPO,
  the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF43/ZNFR3 are sequestered by LGR5, leading to the internalization
  and degradation of the LGR5 protein complex. In this process, RNF43/ZNFR3 are prevented
  from binding to and degrading the WNT receptor Fzd, and thus prevented from downregulating
  WNT signaling. (b) In the absence of LGR5 (or loss of WNT signaling), RNF43/ZNFR3
  target Fzd for degradation, downregulating WNT signaling [18]
