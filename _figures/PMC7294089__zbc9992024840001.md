caption: Humanizing the yeast pheromone pathway for GPCR studies. A and B, simplified
  schematics of the native (A) and humanized (B) pheromone pathway. In response to
  pheromone, the yeast GPCR Ste2 activates the intracellular Gα subunit to stimulate
  a Gβγ-driven MAP-kinase cascade that drives the expression of pheromone-responsive
  genes such as FIG1. In the humanized model, Ste2 is replaced with a human GPCR that
  is coupled to the pheromone pathway via a Gα subunit chimera in which the last five
  residues of the native yeast Gα are replaced with the last five residues of a human
  Gα (indicated in orange). C, in the 2Δ reporter strain, the GTPase-activating protein
  SST2 is deleted, the cell cycle arrest factor FAR1 is deleted, and FIG1 is replaced
  with the transcriptional reporter mTq2. D, the 3Δ reporter strain is derived from
  the 2Δ reporter strain and has the additional deletion of the native yeast GPCR
  STE2.
