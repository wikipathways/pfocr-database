caption: The RAS signaling pathway involves small GTPase switch proteins, NRAS, and
  KRAS. These proteins act downstream of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs and TKs). RAS activation status is regulated through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
  changes. Guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins
  (GAPs) play opposing roles in this regulation. Upon RTK or TK stimulation, adaptor
  proteins (such as GAB2, GRB2, and SHP2) recruit GEFs, leading to RAS-GDP phosphorylation
  and activation of RAS-GTP. Active RAS then triggers a signaling cascade, sequentially
  activating RAF, MEK, and ERK proteins. These downstream signals ultimately control
  cell functions like proliferation, survival, and differentiation. GAPs (e.g., NF1)
  inactivate the RAS pathway by promoting RAS-GTP dephosphorylation to an inactive
  RAS-GDP form. Additionally, the ubiquitin ligase CBL negatively regulates the RAS
  pathway by targeting active RTKs for proteasomal degradation
