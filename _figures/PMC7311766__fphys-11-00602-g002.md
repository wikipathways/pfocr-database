caption: DAMP/PAMP PPR pathway manipulation. (A) TLR, Mincle, and P2X7 receptor activation
  regulated by DAMP and PAMP signaling have been shown to stimulate downstream pathways
  involving various modulatory proteins (ERK, GSK3B, GIT2, SYK). This may activate
  AP-1, NFkB, IRF1/5, or inflammasome activation that leads to induction of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Studies have demonstrated different areas of modulation (1–8) that can
  manipulate DAMP/PAMP mediated inflammation associated with PTB. (B) The supporting
  table lists several interventions that demonstrate the manipulation of the DAMP/PAMP
  mediated pathways that correspond to the different areas of modulation.
