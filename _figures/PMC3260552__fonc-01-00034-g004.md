caption: 'Melanoma signaling networks, progression, and influences by the BCL-2 family.
  Melanoma originates from melanocytes in the skin that acquire a series of changes
  that promote the progression from a normal phenotype to a nevus, primary tumor,
  and eventual metastatic disease. Epigenetically silenced, mutated, or deleted genes
  that promote disease progression are listed and discussed throughout the text. In
  brief, common mutations observed early in melanoma development are in the genes
  encoding N-RAS and B-RAF, and these are often complemented by mutations in the melanocyte
  regulators such as MITF and BCL-2. Subsequent changes to PTEN, CDKN2A, and mH2A
  along with activating mutations of the AKT/PI3K pathway synergize with early mutations.
  Subsequently, alterations in pro-apoptotic sensitivity upstream (e.g., p53) and
  downstream (e.g., APAF-1) of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis are suggested.
  In parallel to these events, the expression and function of the BCL-2 family is
  altered to establish marked resistance to pro-apoptotic stimulation: there is increased
  expression of anti-apoptotic members, and coordinated downregulation of pro-apoptotic
  members.'
