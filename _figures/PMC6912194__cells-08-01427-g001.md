caption: Involvement of ACTN4 in cellular processes. ACTN4 is involved in multiple
  signaling pathways and intracellular processes. The main function of cytoplasmic
  ACTN4 is to crosslink actin filaments, thus affecting the F-actin dynamics and migration
  ability of cancer cells []. ACTN4 also regulates intercellular contacts via the
  interaction with cadherin/catenin adherent junctions. Upon loss of E-cadherin, ACTN4
  stabilizes β-catenin released from the junction complexes and hence inhibits its
  proteasomal degradation [,]. Evidently, ACTN4 migrates to the nucleus where it affects
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. However, the mutual translocation of ACTN4 and beta-catenin
  into the nucleus has not been described. Upon becoming nuclear, ACTN4 interacts
  with a large number of transcription-related proteins, influencing expression of
  various genes. This includes the association of ACTN4 with NF-kappaB promoting the
  co-activation of RelA-mediated transcription [,]. The latter, in turn, may increase
  drug resistance and activation of the EMT program. Alternatively, ACTN4 may enhance
  transcription via the association with chromatin remodeling complexes [,], thereby
  affecting various aspects of cancer development.
