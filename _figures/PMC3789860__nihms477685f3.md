caption: BDNF and its precursor signal locally (curved arrows) as well as over long
  distances (straight arrows) to modify neuronal morphology. (A) BDNF-TrkB elicit
  a retrograde Erk1/2 signal (1) to initiate immediate early gene expression (2).
  Continuing BDNF-TrkB signalling stabilises one of the immediate early genes, MKP-1,
  through phosphorylation and thus locally inhibits Jnk signalling (3), leading to
  collateral branch formation. (B) In absence of TrkB, BDNF signals through p75NTR
  to (1) dampen TrkA signaling, (2) activate the RhoA/ROCK pathway and (3) activate
  caspase-6 to initiate axonal degeneration. (C) ProBDNF signals through p75NTR to
  (1) activate the RhoA-ROCK pathway or inactivate (2) Rac and (3) fascin to initiate
  growth cone collapse.
