  analysis. (A) Network depiction of the TREM2-containing module in HIPP, showing
  all genes connected with a topological overlap measure (TOM) >0.10. TREM2 is highlighted
  in red, together with all of the genes that are directly connected to it, based
  on the TOM cut-off used. Genes that are featured in our proposed TREM2 signaling
  pathway are boxed in blue. (B) Network depiction of the TREM2-containing module
  in CRBL, showing all genes connected with a TOM >0.10. As above, TREM2 is highlighted
  in red, together with the genes that are directly connected to it, based on the
  TOM cut-off used. Genes that are featured in our proposed TREM2 signalling pathway
  are boxed in blue. (C) Proposed TREM2-signaling pathway in human brain adapted from
  the KEGG pathways for “Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis” and “Systemic lupus erythematosus.”
  Genes/complexes highlighted by data-driven network analyses are boxed in blue.
