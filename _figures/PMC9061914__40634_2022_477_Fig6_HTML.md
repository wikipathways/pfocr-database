caption: Suggested signalling pathway for EFMF-induced endochondral ossification.
  Primary osteoblasts are characterized by high constitutive wnt- and TGFß1- (TGFB1)
  signaling. The latent TGFB1 converts to its active form under control of trombospondin
  1 (THBS1). Active TGFB1 binds to its receptor TGFBR1 and regulates expression of
  ßIG-H3, which is a negative regulator of endochondral ossification. EFMF exposure
  increases calcium channel expression and results in Ca2+ influx. This increased
  Ca2+ levels activate protein kinase A (PKA). Activated PKA can phosphorylate catenin
  beta 1(CTNNB1), which prevents its degradation. The stabilized transcription factor
  CTNNB1 blocks THBS1-expression and subsequently TGFB1 activation. Reduced TGFB1
  activation and EFMF induced reduced TGFB1 expression decreased TGFB1-signalling.
  This results in reduced expression of the inhibitor ßIG-H3 and stimulation of endochondral
  ossification. Endochondral ossification linked differentiation is characterized
  by increased expression of collagen type X (COL10A1), decorin (DCN), annexin A5
  (ANXA5), osteopontin (SPP1), cathepsin K (CTSK), hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit
  α (HIF1A), vascular entothelial growth factor B (VEGFB), lactate dehydrogenase A
  (LDHA), cytochrome C oxidase subunit 5A (COX5A), ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5A1).
  and increased Ca-deposition (Fig. )
