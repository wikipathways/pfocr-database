caption: Mechanisms of fisetin on ferroptosis and oxidative stress in glutamate- and
  erastin-stimulated HT22 cells and rats after TBI, which may involve the PI3K/AKT/NRF2
  pathway. Fisetin mitigates lipid peroxidation in ferroptosis by increasing the levels
  of SLC7A11, SLC3A2, GPX4, and reduced glutathione. At the same time, fisetin activates
  PI3K/AKT/NRF2 pathway after injury, which may be closely related to the neuroprotective
  effect of fisetin in relieving oxidative stress. In addition, fisetin can also increase
  the expression level of FTH1 and PRDX1 proteins, and reduce the expression of DMT1
  and NCOA4, thereby reducing ROS level, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, alleviating
  ferroptosis, and protecting neurons. Fisetin inhibits ferroptosis and oxidative
  stress in vivo and in vitro through a variety of ways
