caption: (A) Molecular structure of betaine. (B) Metabolism of betaine and related
  sulfur amino acids (SAAs). Betaine is a substrate of choline and can be converted
  to DMG via demethylation to ultimately become glycine. Most of these reactions occur
  in the mitochondria. The demethylation reaction converts homocysteine to methionine
  and can be replaced by 5-methyl-THF, which can catalyze methylation to form THF.
  Then, methionine is successively converted to SAM and finally to homocysteine to
  form the methionine cycle. Homocysteine can also go through the transsulfuration
  pathway to form cystathionine, cysteine, taurine, or glutathione. The enzymes mentioned
  in this review are shown and marked in the cycle with individual numbers. 1. Betaine-homocysteine
  methyltransferase (BHMT); 2. Methionine synthase (MS); 3. Methionine adenosyltransferase
  (MAT); 4. SAM-dependent methyltransferases; 5. S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase;
  6. Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS); 7. Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO); 8. γ-glutamylcysteine
  synthetase (GCS). THF, tetrahydrofolate; SAM, S-adenosyl-L-methionine; SAH S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine;
  DMG, N,N-dimethylglycine.
