caption: 'The first cells to arrive in the thymus are rare progenitor cells commonly
  referred to as ETPs, which reside in the DN (CD4-CD8-) compartment. DN cells proliferate
  rapidly, partly mediated by Wnt signaling. Inhibition of the Wnt pathway by ectopic
  expression of the soluble Frizzled receptor (which acts as a decoy receptor), Dkk1
  (which inhibits binding to Ldl receptor-related protein (Lrp co-receptors) or the
  cell autonomous ICAT (which disrupts the β-catenin–Tcf interaction) leads to inhibition
  of T-cell development at various points in the DN developmental pathway. Similarly,
  incomplete blocks in T-cell development are observed at DN1, DN2 and ISP stages
  of development in Tcf1-deficient mice. Wnt signaling also regulates the survival
  of DP (CD4+CD8+) thymocytes by upregulating expression of the antiapoptotic protein
  Bcl-Xl, and stabilized β-catenin affects positive selection and IL-7 receptor signaling,
  results in the increased number of CD8+ SP thymocytes. Moreover, the levels of CD4
  on both DP and CD4+ SP cells are regulated in part by Tcf1 (not shown in the figure).Dkk1:
  Dickkopf homolog 1; DN: Double negative; DP: Double positive; HSC: Hematopoietic
  stem cell; ICAT: Inhibitor of β-catenin and Tcf; ISP: Immature single positive;
