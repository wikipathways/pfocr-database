caption: 'Ecological cooccurrence network of the significant interactions between
  Pseudonocardiaceae and Collembola taxa as well as other bacterial taxa (A). Positively
  and negatively interacting taxa are connected by green and red lines, respectively.
  The size of the circle is proportional to the average relative abundances in total
  bacterial or eukaryotic reads derived from amplicon sequencing, numbered near the
  circle. The integrated geosmin biosynthesis pathway in the pivotal Actinobacteria
  bin (B). The metabolic pathway and associated key enzymes as well as relative gene
  frequencies are detected in the whole-gene sequences of the pivotal bin (regarding
  the functions of Actinobacteria) regenerated from shotgun metagenomics from 10 samples
  in the tomb. The percentage in the parentheses near the line is the relative frequency
  of the gene-encoding enzyme in the pivotal bin. Note: The asterisk indicates that
  the relative gene frequency is lower than the detection line. DOXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose
  5-phosphate; MEP, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.

  and other bacterial taxa detected in the shotgun metagenomics of 10 tomb samples
  (C). Gene clusters coding for the biosyntheses of several representative antimicrobial
  substances in the pivotal Actinobacteria bin (D). Herein, Scaff0023184 is the gene
  cluster coding for okaramine D and neopolyoxin C; Scaff0069158 is for thienamycin;
  Scaff0018839 is for showdomycin; Scaff0013190 is for okaramine D and neopolyoxin
