caption: Targeting metabolic reprogramming in cancer. In a fast proliferating cancer
  cell, energy is most often produced simultaneously by both glycolysis and oxidative
  phosphorylation. High glucose uptake sustains increased glycolytic rates required
  for macromolecule biosynthesis (proteins, lipids and nucleotides), furthermore fueled
  by TCA cycle intermediates that can be replenished by the use of glutamine as carbon
  and nitrogen source. In certain cancers, the atypical accumulation of oncometabolites,
  such as D-2HG, may promote epigenetic remodeling. The main cellular pathway regulating
  metabolic reprograming is mTORC1, whose activity regulates several transcription
  factors to promote glycolysis and macromolecule biosynthesis. These reactions have
  been recognized as valid targets for cancer treatment and some of the current metabolic
  anti-cancer strategies are indicated in red.
