caption: Inhibition of the NOTCH pathway by NUMB. NUMB interacts with AP-2 and Eps15
  to disrupt endocytosis of Notch ligands and receptors (1). The binding of ligands
  (Delta, Jagged [JAG]) to Notch transmembrane receptors 1–4 triggers a series of
  proteolytic cleavages by ADAM family proteins (ADAM 10, ADAM 17) and a γ–secretase
  complex that lead to the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (2). The
  NICD is translocated into the nucleus, interacts with the recombining binding protein
  suppressor of hairless (RBPJ) transcription factor and the transcriptional activator
  protein Mastermind to regulate target genes such as Hes-1 and Hey-1. NUMB might
  disturb this transcriptional machinery and inhibit Notch-dependent gene expression
  (3). Phosphorylation of NICD by CDK8 leads to hAgo-dependent proteosomal degradation
  of NICD (4). NUMB prevents translocation of NCID into the nucleus (5). Strategies
  under development for the therapeutic inhibition of the NOTCH pathway are indicated
  in boxes.
