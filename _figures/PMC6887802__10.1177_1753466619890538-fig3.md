caption: Lung cancer and autophagy pathway. The blue arrows show the relationships
  between autophagy and occurrence/development of lung cancer. C-K activates mTOR
  through AMPK signal pathway, inactivation of ULKI induced by mTOR increases autophagy
  and participates in the growth and migration of tumor cells. EGFR-TKI involves in
  the development of lung cancer by inhibiting autophagy levels. The yellow arrows
  show that inhibiting autophagy enhances the sensitivity of lung cancer to chemotherapy
  drugs.AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; C-K, compound K; EGFR-TKI,
  epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor; mTOR mammalian target
  of rapamycin.
