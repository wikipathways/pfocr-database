caption: 'Proteolytic processing of APP by non-amyloidogenic pathway and amyloidogenic
  pathway.In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is sequentially cleaved by α-sec and
  γ-sec generating sAPPα, p3 and AICD fragments. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP
  is sequentially cleaved by β-sec and γ-sec generating sAPPβ, Aβ and AICD fragments.
  In both cases, the APP processing releases functionally active fragments to the
  extracellular medium (sAPPα, p3, sAPPβ and Aβ peptide) which seem to modulate or
  influence several signaling pathways (marked in yellow boxes). Also the release
  of the intracellular fragment AICD seems to act differently according to its processing
  pathway. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, AICD is rapidly degraded, while in the
  amyloidogenic pathway, AICD acts as a transcriptional regulator of several target
  genes. APP: Amyloid precursor protein; α-sec: α-secretase; β-sec: β-secretase; γ-sec:
  γ-secretase; sAPPα: soluble APP-α; sAPPβ: soluble APP-β; AICD: intracellular C-terminal
  domain; Aβ: amyloid-β; Shh: sonic hedgehog; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  PI3K/AKT: phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B.'
