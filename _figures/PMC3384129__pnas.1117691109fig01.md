caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of DMSP/DMS by marine algae through assimilatory sulfate
  reduction via methionine enzymatic biotransformation. The reaction processes involved
  in seawater sulfate assimilation by marine algae species are as follows: (1) carrier-bound
  sulfate reduction, (2) transsulfuration to methionine biosynthesis, (3) transamination,
  (4) reduction, (5) methylation, (6) oxidative decarboxylation, and (7) cleavage/degradation
  [scheme modified from Stefels () and Kiene et al. ()]. Calculated fractionation
  factors for S-bonding (α34Scompound-methionine) in metabolic intermediates are provided
  in SI Materials and Experimental Methods and Table S4.'
