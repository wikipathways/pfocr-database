caption: Activation of surface BCR complex (i.e., membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) associated
  with covalently linked CD79a-CD79b heterodimer) and other surface receptors (e.g.,
  TLRs, CXCR4, and FAS) by their ligands results in PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
  bisphosphate (PIP2) and generation of inositol triphosphate (IP3). PLCs are activated
  either by Syk and Btk tyrosine kinases which induced tyrosine phosphorylation of
  the protein (e.g., PLCγ2) or via binding to Gβγ subunits of trimeric GTP-binding
  proteins (PLCβ) that are coupled to cell surface receptors (CXCR4, FZD3, P2RY8,
  and S1PR2). IP3-bound receptors (IP3Rs) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induce
  release Ca2+ from the ER leading to activation of various cytoplasmic enzymes (Fig.
  ). CD22 forms a tripartite complex with protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor
  type-6 (Shp-1) and plasma membrane Ca2+‐ATPase (PMCA) that regulates Ca2+ efflux
  pathway. Kelch-like protein 6 (KLHL6) functions as an adaptor for Cullin-3 (CUL3),
  an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates internalisation (and possibly degradation)
  of CD22 thus negatively affecting the contribution of the protein to calcium homeostasis.
  Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks, p85/p100) and Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
  3-phosphatase (PTEN) control interconversion of PIP2 and phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate
  (PIP3) on the plasma membrane. Binding to PIP3 enhances enzymatic activity of Btk
  resulting in increased Btk-dependent phosphorylation of PLCγ.
