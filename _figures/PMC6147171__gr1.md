caption: 'A) A simplified schematic of the Wnt signaling pathway. Without Wnt ligand
  stimulation, β-cat is sequestered in the cytoplasm and degraded by the proteasome.
  This process involves four major proteins: Axin, APC, GSK-3 and CK-1α, which form
  the β-cat destruction complex. TCFs will recruit nuclear co-repressors (HDAC, CtBP1
  and Groucho) and inhibit Wnt target gene expression (left panel). Following the
  binding of Wnt ligand to the Frizzled receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptor, the destruction
  complex is disrupted by Dvl. β-cat will enter the nucleus and forms the bipartite
  transcription factor with a TCF member (right panel). In addition, β-cat can be
  activated by insulin or GLP-1 signaling cascade, involving its S675 or S552 phosphorylation.
  B) Structure of β-cat. Four S/T residues at the N-terminus can be phosphorylated
  by GSK-3 and CK-1α, leading to its proteasome degradation. The phosphorylation on
  the two S residues at the C-terminus leads to its activation. T, transactivation
  domain; Arm Repeats, the armadillo repeat domain.'
