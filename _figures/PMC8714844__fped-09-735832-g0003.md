caption: Involvement of the dysregulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in LM. In
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, the somatic mutations on PIK3CA are specifically
  discovered in LM-LECs. Also, some LM can present as part of PROS, the inhibitors
  against PI3K, i.e., LY294002, BYL719 and Wortmannin, may provide a new therapeutic
  target for the treatment of LM. The mutations on PIK3CA can increase AKT-Thr308
  phosphorylation, triggering high cellular proliferative and sprouting potential
  of LM-LECs, which could be inhibited by the specific small molecular inhibitors,
  such as ARQ092, MK-2206. MK-2206 may be worthy of further treatment of LM. Sirolimus
  can potently and specifically inhibit the activity mTOR. PIK3CA mutation can repress
  ANG2 by conducting phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of FOXO1, which is the
  essential transcription factors for ANG2 expression. The decreased expression of
  ANG2 makes lymphatic vessels more stable and muscular. Furthermore, the inhibitors
  against PI3K, AKT, mTOR, provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of LM.
