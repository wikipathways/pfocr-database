caption: Model for auxin response. In this model, TIR1 functions in an SCF ubiquitin
  ligase that targets one or more negative regulators of the auxin response pathway
  for ubiquitination and degradation. SCFTIR1 activity requires the RUB modification
  of AtCUL1 via the AXR1–ECR1 pathway. The ubiquitin–mediated degradation of the repressor(s)
  derepresses the response pathway resulting in the activation of the early auxin
  response genes (AUX/IAA genes) that may control downstream events resulting in auxin-regulated
  growth and development. E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme; E2R, RUB-conjugating enzyme.
