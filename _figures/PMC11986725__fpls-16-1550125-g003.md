caption: Anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in plants. This diagram illustrates the
  enzymatic steps involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanin. Highlighting the key
  enzymes and their respective positions in the pathway. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase;
  C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3 hydroxylase;
  F3′5′H, flavonoid 3,5 hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; UFGT, UDP-galactose flavonoid 3-O-galactosyltransferase;
  The pathway is divided into different branches, each leading to the synthesis of
  anthocyanin biosynthesis
