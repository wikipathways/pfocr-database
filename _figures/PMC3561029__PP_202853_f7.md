caption: Schematic and simplified representation of shoot- and root-specific regulation
  of proteins regulating hormonal metabolism. In the shoot,  application up-regulates  levels,
  probably via up-regulation of proteins involved in the mevalonate pathway and acetyl-CoA
  formation. This leads to up-regulation of several -related proteins predominantly
  in the shoot, potentially via Tyr phosphorylation-mediated protein stabilization
  or other type of -dependent regulation of expression. In the root,  treatment up-regulates
  several proteins involved in ethylene biosynthesis, resulting in rapid ethylene
  up-regulation as a result of root-specific  accumulation. Both  and ethylene are
  involved in the root growth response.
