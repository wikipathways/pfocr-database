caption: Mechanism and role of 4PBA and YM155. (A) 4PBA. (B) YM155.ERS is a distress
  signal triggered due to accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. 4PBA (A),
  which is an ERS inhibitor in our study, played a role in inhibiting the UPR genes
  by acting as an agent and by reducing the protein misfolding in the ER and also
  aiding in apoptosis via cytochrome-c release. The post-apoptotic signaling, Survivin,
  is released from the mitochondria block cytochrome-c and inhibits the Caspases,
  which inhibits programmed cell death. (B) YM155, which is a Survivin inhibitor,
  was found to escalate apoptosis via the caspase3/7 pathway and aiding the free flow
  release of Caspases and facilitating cell death.
