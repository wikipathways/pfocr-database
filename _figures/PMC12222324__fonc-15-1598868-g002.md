caption: Role of FOXM1 in ovarian cancer development. FOXM1 accelerates the cell cycle
  and thus promotes cell proliferation by up-regulating the expression of downstream
  target genes PLK1, KIF20A, CCNB1, CDC25B, SKP2, and CCNF and by accelerating the
  degradation of p27KiP1. OCSC in contact with TME activated the FAK-YAP pathway to
  increase the expression of FOXM1, which increased cancer stemness through the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. FOXM1 also accelerated cellular metabolic processes through the up-regulation
  of GLUT1 and HK2.FOXM1 up-regulated VEGF and PDGF to regulate angiogenesis, as well
  as through the downstream target genes KRT5, KRT7, MMP, CCNF, KIF20A and DLX1 promoted
  cancer cell metastasis
