caption: 'The proposed yeast HOG pathways. In S. cerevisiae, the Ssk2/22-Pbs2-Hog1
  MAPK module is modulated by two main upstream branches: the Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1 phosphorelay
  system and Msb2/Hkr1/Sho1/Opy2 signaling branches. In contrast, the Ssk2-Pbs2-Hog1
  MAPK module is mainly regulated by the multicomponent phosphorelay system in both
  C. neoformans and C. albicans. In C. neoformans, the Msb2/Sho1 branch pathway plays
  a minor role in phosphorylating Hog1 in the absence of Ssk1, and functions in phosphorylating
  Cpk1 for cell wall biogenesis. Although Msb2 and Sho1 are involved in mating process
  of C. neoformans, they are not directly involved in Cpk1 phosphorylation. In C.
  albicans, there is no evidence that the Sho1/Msb2/Opy2 branch pathway regulates
  the Hog1 MAPK module directly.'
