caption: Model of the signaling pathway active in effect of DHT treatment in bladder
  cells. DHT interacts with AR, and translocates to nucleus to elicit transcriptional
  regulation of target gene. Note that DHT also stimulates activation of Akt kinase
  pathway. Akt kinase, after binding to plasma membrane is activated and stimulate
  AR/DHT complex to nucleus or/and regulate GSK-3β activity via its phosphorylation
