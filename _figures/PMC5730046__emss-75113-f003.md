caption: Transcriptional re-configuration of glucose metabolism was determined by
  interrogating the microarray data for genes differentially regulated in hESCs or
  in iPSCs compared to fibroblasts (fold change 1.5, detection p value ≤0.01, and
  differential p value ≤0.01). Genes encoding for enzymes and proteins involved in
  the metabolic cascade are shown in italics. Upon its uptake into the cell, glucose
  can follow the glycolytic pathway or can be diverted into the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP). Once pyruvate has been generated, it can either be converted into
  lactate or enter the mitochondria to take part into the tricarboxylic acid cycle
  (TCA) cycle and mitochondrial respiration. Finally pyruvate or malate can be transferred
  outside the mitochondria to generate new glucose. Genes consensually up-regulated
  in all hESCs and iPSC lines compared to fibroblasts are indicated in red, whereas
  genes down-regulated in all pluripotent stem cells are presented in green.
