caption: Mechanisms of hUCMSCs injection in breast tissue engineering. HUCMSCs could
  promote vascularization in vitro via paracrine, which could activate the vital signal
  pathway of integrin β1/ERK1/2/HIF-1α/VEGF-A in endothelial cells. Moreover, hUCMSCs
  exerted an immunomodulatory effect by inhibiting M1 macrophages and differentiate
  into adipocytes and vascular endothelial cells in vivo
