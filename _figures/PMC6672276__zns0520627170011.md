caption: 'Model of regulation of vasopressin gene expression in the SCN. A schematic
  representation of potential neurotransmitter ligands and receptors in the VP cell
  membrane, signal transduction mechanisms, and kinase pathways that are linked to
  VP gene expression in the SCN is shown. The molecular components and mechanisms
  that are critical and are supported by pharmacological data presented in this paper
  are underlined. Two distinct signal transduction cascades are involved: (1) membrane
  depolarization leading to Ca influx through L-type Ca channels activates both CaMK
  and MAP kinase pathways, and (2) VIP activation of the VPAC2 receptors on VP neurons
  is coupled to adenylate cyclase (AC) generation of cAMP, which results in the activation
  of the MAP kinase pathway. Underlined words and filled arrows depict processes supported
  by data in this paper or in the literature [e.g., for Bmal/Clock ()], and arrows
  with dotted lines represent speculative processes. The downstream regulatory component
  is hypothesized to be phosphorylated CREB and/or unknown activators (?) of not yet
  identified elements. The temporal pattern of VP expression in the SCN is considered
  as requiring both a circadian oscillatory component (Bmal/Clock) to open the gate
  (Ebox) and a neural activity component (VIP and/or spikes) to drive the VP expression
  (possibly via the CRE) of the VP gene. VGCC, Voltage-gated calcium channel; GPCR,
  G-protein-coupled receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RSK, ribosomal
  S6 kinase; MSK, mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1; CaRE, calcium response element;
  GRP, gastin releasing peptide.'
