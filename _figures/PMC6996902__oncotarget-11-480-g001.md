caption: 'The complex process of osteoclastogenesis in cancer is regulated by an interaction
  between bone, immune and cancer cells. Cancer cells promote this process in two
  ways: 1) indirectly, stimulating osteoblast to activate the RankL/Rank pathway (bone
  osteoclastogenesis) and deregulating immune cells activity against osteoclasts;
  2) directly, stimulating osteoclastsogenesis by upregulation of IL-1, IL-6, PTHrP,
  GM-CSF. After cancer cells signals, immune system cells activate osteoclastogenesis
  by upregulation of TNFa, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-7, IL-8, IL-23. Once activated, osteoclasts
  protect their growth with the inactivation of immune system by TGF-beta production.
  Bisphosphonates (i.e. Zoledronic Acid) inhibit osteoclast formation, recruitment
  and adhesion to bone shift the balance towards OPG production by osteoblasts and
  induce osteoclasts apoptosis. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody with
  anti-RANKL activity, thus inhibiting osteoclast activation by Rank receptor. Initial
  data evidenced a possible role in immune system preservation by B cell/T cell differentiation
  and dendritic cell survival.'
