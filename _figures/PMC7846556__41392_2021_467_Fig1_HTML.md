caption: Inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis by necrosulfonamide, disulfiram,
  and dimethyl fumarate. Pyroptosis is a lytic cell death pathway activated downstream
  of caspase-1 and caspase-11. Activation of caspase-1/11 results in catalytic cleavage
  of the substrate gasdermin D (GSDMD), which releases the autoinhibitory C-terminal
  domain (C-GSDMD) from the pore-forming N-terminal domain (N-GSDMD). Cleavage results
  in N-GSDMD insertion into the plasma membrane and N-GSDMD oligomerization, forming
  a pore and leading to membrane disruption. Caspase-1 cleavage of IL-1β and IL-18
  is also required for cytokine activation, while pore formation by GSDMD facilitates
  cytokine release from the cytosol. Inhibitors of GSDMD activity include necrosulfonamide
  (via alkylation), disulfiram (via the addition of dithiodiethylcarbamoyl [DTC]),
  and dimethyl fumarate (via succination), which have each been shown to covalently
  modify the Cys191 residue of murine GSDMD, blocking its activity. In addition to
  directly targeting GSDMD, off-target effects of these compounds on caspase-1 cleavage
  and activation have been observed
