caption: Schema of intracellular signaling pathways involved in the antidepressant-like
  effects of sigma-1 receptors. (A) Sigma-1 receptors are activated and translocated
  to the plasma membrane to interact with the NMDAR of pyramidal cells, which would
  result in a rapid intracellular activation of CaMKII that would eventually activate
  (phosphorylate) intermediates in the ERK1/2 and mTOR pathways, thus inducing a rapid
  synthesis of PSD95, BDNF etc; (B) Sigma-1 receptors are activated and then disassociate
  from Bip thus stabilizing IP3R, maintaining the Ca2+ flow from the ER to mitochondria
  and ATP production; (C) Sigma-1 receptor activates and thus binds and modulates
  the ER stress response via ER stress sensors IRE1 and facilitates BDNF expression
  via the IRE1-XBP1 signaling pathway. (D) Sigma-1 receptors may also modulate 5HT1A
  function through sigma-1 receptor-5HT1A interaction.
