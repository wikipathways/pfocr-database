caption: BM-resident CD69+regulatory T cells (CD69+ Treg) decrease expression of CD39
  which is required for the canonical CD39/CD73 adenosine pathway. This suggests that
  an alternative adenosine pathway involving ectoenzyme CD38, expressed on malignant
  plasma cells (PC), is active in the BM niches of NDMM patients. CD8+CD57+ terminal
  effector T cells (TTE) originate from memory T cells (TM) and may (1) undergo oligoclonal
  expansion into cytotoxic CD69- TTE (TCRVβ TTE) with high expression of perforin
  and granzyme B, the ability to eliminate autologous PC in vitro and circulate between
  BM and PB or, (2) remain within the BM as non-cytotoxic BM-resident CD69+ TTE with
  high inhibitory checkpoint expression (PD-1, TIGIT, Lag3, CD160) possibly promoted
  by BM-resident CD69+ Treg. Both CD69- TTE and BM-resident CD69+ TTE produce large
  amounts of the inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor
  α (TNF-α). CD69− TTE and CD69+ TTE establish an inverse relationship within the
  BM-resident T cell compartment of NDMM patients. Changes in Treg and CD69− TTE and
  CD69+ TTE within the BM-resident T cell compartment of NDMM patients may be critical
  for myeloma surveillance at the site of disease initiation and progression.
