caption: CEACAM6 Signaling Pathway. Over-expression of CEACAM6 results in alteration
  and reorganization of the ECM and activation of the TME playing a key role in tumor
  invasion. CEACAM6 signaling increases SRC activity leading to increased IGF-I secretion
  with autocrine and paracrine stimulation of the IGF-1R activating the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  Increased IGF-I expression results in MMP-2 elaboration, subsequently altering the
  ECM promoting a malignant TME. Aggregation of CEACAM6 at the cell surface enhances
  anoikis resistance through activation of SRC in a caveolin-1-dependent manner allowing
  for phosphorylation of its substrate focal adhesion kinase (FAK). TGF-β elaborated
  in the TME binds to the type II receptor (TβRII), promoting hetero-tetramerization
  with the type I receptor (TβRI) increasing the phosphorylation of SMAD3 by activated
  TβRI. Phosphorylated SMAD3 forms a complex with Co-Smad (SD4), which translocates
  into the nucleus to bind gene promoters and activate expression of target genes,
  specifically CEACAM6. Also, TGF-β signals through the TGF-β receptors to activate
  alternate pathways such as AKT/PI3K.
