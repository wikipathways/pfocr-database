caption: Hypothesis-driven two-factor common pathway model path diagram of the metabolic
  syndrome. Rectangles represent observed variables. Circles represent latent or unmeasured
  variables. Single-headed arrows represent hypothesized casual relationships between
  variables. Double-headed arrows represent variance. Path coefficients are standardized
  parameter estimates and 95% confidence intervals are reported in parentheses. Darkened
  lines indicate significant paths. Subscripts indicate variable or factor under influence.

  triglycerides; WC, Blom transformation of waist circumference.
