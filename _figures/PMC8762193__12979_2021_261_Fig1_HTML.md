caption: Study and experimental design. CMV-seronegative participants were selected
  from the Doetinchem cohort study. PBMCs were thawed and stimulated with the indicated
  cytokines or were left unstimulated (baseline). Intranuclear immunofluorescence
  staining was performed to quantify phosphorylation of STAT1, 3, and 5 proteins,
  in combination with surface staining for lineage-specific markers to distinguish
  between B cells, monocytes, and T cells (CD8+ and CD4+)
