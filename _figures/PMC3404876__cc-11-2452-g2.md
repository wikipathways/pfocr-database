caption: Figure 2. RKIP signaling pathway regulates breast cancer metastasis to the
  bone. Highlighted with light blue rectangles are the components of the pathway that
  are also part of the RPMS. Highlighted with light blue ovals are the meta-genes
  that were added to the signaling pathway to make the RPMS.
