caption: Molecular mechanisms underlying miRNA-mediated regulation of aging processes.
  This figure illustrates the molecular basis of miRNA-mediated control over aging,
  with a focus on nutrition-sensing pathways and aging-related signaling networks.
  Across various species, miRNAs play a crucial role in regulating lifespan and key
  aging mechanisms. Lifespan and age-related processes are governed by AMPK, Sirtuins,
  and the Insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathways. The interconnection between cell metabolism,
  stress response, and longevity is established through nutrient-sensing mechanisms
  such as mTOR and the IGF1/PI3K/AKT pathway. Diet affects miRNA modulation, highlighting
  the complex link between nutrition, molecular aging pathways, and lifespan regulation.
  A comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between miRNAs and nutrient-sensing
  pathways can shed light on the causes of aging and identify potential drug targets.
