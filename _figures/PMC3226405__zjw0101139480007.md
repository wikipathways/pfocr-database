caption: 'Pathways for sulfur assimilation, cysteine and methionine biosynthesis,
  and induction of S-box regulon genes in response to NaOCl stress. The S-box regulon
  gene products that are induced in the transcriptome as a result of methionine starvation
  provoked by the S-bacillithiolation of MetE and YxjG are bold-faced in gray. The
  transcriptome induction ratios are shown below the gene products. The gene products
  of the sulfate assimilation pathway (Sat, CysC, CysH, CysJI, CysE) are not induced
  upon NaOCl stress (except for CysK). The inset shows the transcriptional induction
  of yitJ in the wild type and ΔbshA mutant using Northern blot analysis before (co)
  and at different times (10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min) after exposure to 50 μm NaOCl
  stress. Abbreviations: APS, adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate;
  OAS, O-acetylserine; N5,N10-THF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; N5 -THF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate;
  THF, tetrahydrofolate. This figure was adapted from Tomsic et al., 2008 ().'
