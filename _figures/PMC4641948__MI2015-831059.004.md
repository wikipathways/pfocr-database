caption: Thrombin-stimulated S1P secretion in human platelets. Thrombin triggers COX-1-mediated
  synthesis of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) via activation of platelet PAR-1. Consecutive
  TX release and activation of thromboxane A2 receptor (TXR) enhances platelet degranulation
  and aggregation. In parallel, TXA2-TXR signaling stimulates platelet S1P secretion.
  This pathway involves activation protein kinase C (PKC) and appears to be mediated
  by an ATP-dependent transport mechanism (ABC, ATP-binding cassette transporter).
  In a paracrine manner, platelet-derived S1P may modulate endothelial and immune
  cell responses at sites of injury.
