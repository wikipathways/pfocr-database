caption: FGF-signaling promotes neurite outgrowth by small GTPase-dependent-, ERK-
  and Akt-pathways. Activation of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 and inhibition of
  the negative effector RhoA promotes outgrowth by posttranslational mechanisms. The
  ERK and Akt pathways, however, change transcriptional profiles towards an outgrowth
  promoting state. Both pathways functionally interact with RhoA-downstream-target
  Rho-kinase (ROCK) as a central node , . ROCK thereby is important for integration
  and processing signals of the two major pathways involved in neurite outgrowth.
  Interestingly, recent findings of our group suggest a role of SMN-Profilin2a interaction
  in ROCK-pathway dependent outgrowth. SMN-reduction thereby leads to changes in phosphorylation-dependent
  regulation of ROCK-downstream targets indicated by red arrows . Moreover, SMA-patient
  derived SMN-S230L-mutation does not interact with Prof2a and acts dominant negative
  on neurite outgrowth when overexpressed in vitro . In this study, FGFR-1 was found
  to be upregulated under SMN-knockdown and consistently Akt and ERK showed hyper-phosphorylations.
  Thereby a sequestration of ROCK via Prof2a binding might enhance ERK-hyper-phosphorylation
  in a FGFR dependent manner.
