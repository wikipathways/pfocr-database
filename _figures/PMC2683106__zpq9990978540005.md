caption: 'mTOR supports hESC long-term self-renewal by promoting cell proliferation
  and repressing differentiation: A model. mTOR responds to extrinsic factors such
  as bFGF, MEF-CM, and KSR, integrates and transmits pluripotency-supporting signals.
  Activation of mTOR inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway, which combines with unidentified
  mechanisms (dotted line; question mark) to repress the transcriptional activity
  of MIXL1, Brachyury (T gene), EBF2 and PITX2 in hESCs. Repression of the developmental
  genes is necessary for the stability of the OCT-4/SOX2/NANOG circuitry. mTOR also
  suppresses growth inhibitory molecules including Cyclin G2 and PDCD4 and thus promotes
  cell proliferation.'
