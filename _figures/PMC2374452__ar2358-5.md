caption: Molecular pathways of rheumatoid arthritis-related cartilage destruction
  as reflected by the in vitro model. Illustration of differentially expressed genes
  of chondrocytes stimulated with supernatant of synovial fibroblast cell line derived
  from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RASFsn) compared with stimulation with
  supernatant of synovial fibroblast cell line derived from a normal donor (NDSFsn);
  induced genes were printed in bold, repressed genes in italics. Genes and text in
  grey are hypothetical assumptions of the established in vitro model for which further
  validations are still required. Cartilage destruction in rheumatoid arthritis was
  characterized by a disturbed homeostasis of chondrocyte function that leads to an
  enhanced cartilage catabolism involving extracellular matrix degradation via matrix
  metalloproteinases and suppressed extracellular matrix synthesis, induction of catabolic
  cytokines/chemokines and proinflammatory inducible enzymes, and activation of NF-κB
  signaling pathway. Thus, the established tissue model provided profound insights
  into the molecular processes involved in rheumatoid arthritis-related cartilage
  destruction regarding chondrocyte gene expression patterns. ADORA2A, adenosine A2A
  receptor; CMKOR, chemokine orphan receptor; COLL11A1, collagen type XI, α1; COMP,
  cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; COX, cyclooxygenase; CSPG, chondroitin sulfate
  proteoglycan; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase;
  NO, nitric oxide; PGs, prostaglandins; PGES, prostaglandin E synthase; RASF, synovial
  fibroblast cell line derived from patient with RA; RIPK, receptor-interacting serine/threonine
  kinase; SMS, spermine synthase; STAT, signal transduction and activators of transcription;
  THBS, thrombospondin; TLR, toll-like receptor; TXNIP, thioredoxin interacting protein.
