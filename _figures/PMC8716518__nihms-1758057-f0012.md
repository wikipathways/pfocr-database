caption: mRNA was isolated from RAW264.7 cells stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 24
  h in the presence or absence of 3 × 105 EVs isolated from the plasma 1, 7, and 14
  d after burn injury (n = 6 mice per time point ingenuity pathways analysis was employed
  to detect and visualize the significant changes in expression of genes within the
  key macrophage innate immune pathway of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling.
  Each group represents cell cultures stimulated with EVs from 12 source mice, with
  n = 6 different pooled EV preparations from 2 individual mice. The baseline data
  visualized is the fold change in specific genes after LPS stimulation in the absence
  of EV, relative to unstimulated cells in the absence of EV. Fold change in gene
  expression in the presence of EVs from sham injury (circle) or burn injury (squares)
  relative to LPS-stimulated cells in the absence of EV is indicated by increasing
  green representing increasing down-regulation, increasing red representing increased
  up-regulation, and gray representing no change in expression. For each gene that
  is significantly impacted by the addition of EVs, we have overlaid to the lower
  right of each gene symbol the immunomodulation of each EV type (from top to bottom,
  sham EVs (●), and then burn EVs from each time point after injury (■) days 1, 7,
  and 14 (stacked in the order shown in the legend)
