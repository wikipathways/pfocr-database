caption: 'Flow of glucose and xylose carbon via central metabolic pathways in Escherichia
  coli. NADPH is generated via pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, tricarboxyic acid (TCA)
  cycle and membrane bound trans-hydrogenase. Xylose enters PP pathway at X5P step
  thus bypassing the NADP+ reducing steps catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase which are encoded by zwf and gnd, respectively.
  In Δpgi strain, pyr is generated via channeling of Gly-3-P and F-6-P from PP to
  Embden-Meyerhof-Paranas (EMP) pathway. Connecting intermediates are indicated with
  thin broken lines. Abbreviations are as follow: G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; X-5-P,
  xylulose-5-phosphate; gly-3-P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Pyr, pyruvate; OAA, oxaloacetic acid'

  furfural in media containing glucose–xylose mixture.
