caption: Summary for reducing anti-PD-1 resistant by STING-LNP. (1) The intravenously
  injected STING-LNPs accumulate in the liver and are taken up by liver macrophages,
  leading to the activation of the STING pathway. (2) The liver macrophages secret
  type I IFNs to the blood circulation. (3) The type I IFNs activate systemic NK cells
  such as in the spleen and the lung. A portion of NK cells express PD-1. (4) The
  activated NK cells produce IFN-γ in the B16-F10 tumor. (5) The exposure of type
  I IFNs and IFN-γ promotes the expression of PD-L1 on the cancer cells, leading to
  the establishment of immunosuppression via PD-1/PD-L1 axis between PD-1+ NK cells
  and cancer cells. (6) An anti-PD-1 treatment blocks the immunosuppression, resulting
  in the reactivation of NK cells and the development of cytotoxicity against cancer
  cells. c-di-GMP, cyclic di-GMP; IFN, interferon; NK, natural killer; PD-1, programmed
  cell death 1; STING-LNP, lipid nanoparticle containing a stimulator of an interferon
  gene.
