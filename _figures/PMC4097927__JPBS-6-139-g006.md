caption: Schematic representation of polyamidoamine dendrimer-based gene delivery
  vectors. (a) Schematic illustration of the synthesis of dendrimer/RGD conjugates
  (pathway A + B) and of the indirect estimation of the number of pyridyldithiol (PDP)
  units per dendrimer by spectrophotometry (pathway A + C). Reproduced with permission
  from ref.,[] Copyright 2011, American Chemical Society. (b) Strategy of synthesis
  followed in dendrimer surface functionalization with alkyl chains (activation of
  the fatty acid + conjugation reaction). Reproduced with permission from ref.,[]
  Copyright 2010, Elsevier. (c) The two-step reaction for the synthesis of peptide-functionalized
  G5 PAMAM dendrimers (pathway A + B), and for indirect estimation of the number of
  peptide units by spectrophotometry (pathway A + C). Reproduced with permission from
