caption: The pathway analysis resulted in two networks with identical scores that
  passed the threshold. The indicated network matched to “DNA Replication, Recombination,
  and Repair” containing 29 out of the 319 significant proteins. The network itself
  consists of 35 proteins. The up-regulated proteins in early stage cervical cancer
  are marked red, while those that that were down-regulated were not identified in
  this pathway. The intensity of the color relates to fold-change. The NF-κB complex
  protein indicated with a red asterisk was identified once (99% protein- and 95%
  peptide probability with at least one peptide) by LCM, although not differential.
  The second network that passed the permutation background score is represented in
  Figure . The symbols shown in the network are explained at http://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis
