caption: The actions of anticancer drugs (left column) and flavonoids (right column)
  on a dorsal root ganglion. (a) Simplified Overview. Flavonoids counteract anticancer
  drugs and increase mitochondrial damage, proinflammatory cytokine production, receptor
  sensitization, and the likelihood of an action potential. Also depicted is how anticancer
  drugs increase satellite glial cell coupling and excitability. (b) Anticancer Drugs
  on Proinflammatory Cytokine Production at the DRG. Anticancer drugs increase the
  translation of proinflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins, and NO through SIRT1 pathway
  downregulation and NF-κB activation. This leads to receptor sensitization and an
  increased likelihood of an action potential firing; (c) Flavonoids on Anticancer
  Drug- Induced Proinflammatory Cytokine Production in the DRG. Flavonoids counteract
  anticancer drugs’ actions at the DRG by inhibiting the translocation of NF-κB, upregulating
  the SIRT1 pathway, and inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines and
  prostaglandins. These actions decrease inflammation and consequently decrease the
  likelihood of AP firing and receptor sensitization; (d) Anticancer Drugs on Ion
  Channels and NT Production at the DRG. Anticancer drugs increase the expression
  of ion channels such as TRPV1 and N-type VGCC, increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentrations
  and consequently increasing NT release. It also results in a dorsal root reflex;
  (e) Flavonoids on Anticancer Drug-Induced Increases in NT Production and Ion Channel
  Expression. 6-MeOF triggers GABAA receptors, decreasing an AP’s likelihood and consequently
  reducing NT release and alleviating pain; (f) Anticancer Drugs on the DRG’s Oxidative
  Stress Level. Anticancer drugs increase mitochondrial oxidant production, resulting
  in lipid peroxidation and tyrosine nitrosylation, lowering GSH levels in the cell
  and increases oxidative stress, causing neuronal damage; (g) Flavonoids on Anticancer
  Drug-Induced Increases in DRG Oxidative Stress. Flavonoids counteract the increase
  in oxidative stress by increasing the translation of GSH and directly scavenging
  reactive oxygen species; (h) Anticancer Drugs on Satellite Glial Cells. Anticancer
  drugs increase the expression of gap junctions that connect astrocytes surrounding
  the same and different DRGs. They also connect SGCs and neurons. Ca2+ waves travel
  through these gap junctions, reducing the membrane potential of SGCs and increasing
  the likelihood of AP firing in neurons. The Ca2+ waves are hypothetically generated
  by the anticancer drug-induced increase in P2X levels following inflammation. Oxaliplatin
  blocks the production of Kir4.1, disrupting the extracellular concentration of K+
  and leading to an increased likelihood of an AP; (i) Flavonoids on Anticancer Drug
  Effects in Satellite Glial Cells. No relevant research was found on how flavonoids
  counteract anticancer drug effects on SGCs.
