caption: The mechanism and function of therapy-induced senescence. (A) Therapy induce
  senescence-associated growth arrest by generating DNA damage or targeting reinitiation
  of senescent pathway signaling. (B) The senescent cells could reprogram with stemness
  by Suv39 h1 or p53 inactivation, Wnt stem signaling activation and/or derepression
  of the H3K9 me3 mark. (C) The SASP is an important mediator of cross-talk between
  senescent cells and nonsenescent cells. Scheme summarizing some of the functions
  associated with the SASP.
