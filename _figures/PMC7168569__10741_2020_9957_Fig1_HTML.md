caption: The regulatory roles and underlying mechanisms of ELA-APJ axis in heart failure.
  (a) ELA-54 is the full-length peptide via transcription and translation. ELA-54
  is subsequently cleaved into the mature secretary peptide ELA-32 in Golgi apparatus,
  which exerts its biologicl effects by autocrine or paracrine. (b) The combination
  of ELA and APJ receptor activates intracellular signaling pathways, which partialy
  atributes to the recruitment of β-arrestin and internalization of the ELA-APJ complex.
  In addition, ELA binds an unkown receptor (X receptor), instead of APJ receptor,
  and plays a key role in the cell growth, survival, and self-renewal of hESCs or
  the OCCC cell lines by activating the PI3K/Akt phosphorylation signaling pathway
  or by suppressing the p53 signaling pathway. More importantly, the ELA-APJ receptor
  axis has been shown to regulate cellular differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation,
  oxidative stress, fibrosis, remodeling, vasodilation, cardiac contractility, cellular
  survival, and stem cell renewal in heart failure through the MEK/ERK, GATA4/Tbx5,
  AMPK/mTOR, and TGFβ/MMP9 signaling pathways, respectively. ELA, Elabela; X receptor,
  unknown receptor; hESCs, human embryonic stem cells; ECs, endothelial cells; HUVECs,
  human umbilical vein endothelial cells; CMs, cardiomyocytes; CFs, cardiofibroblasts;
  OCCC, ovarian clear cell carcinoma cell line; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERK1/2,
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase/external-signal
  regulated kinase; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; ACE, angiotensin
  converting enzyme; Ang II, angiotensin II; AT1, angiotensin II type 1 receptor;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor κ-B; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; MMP9, matrix metallopeptidase
  9; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α
