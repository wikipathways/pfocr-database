caption: AD genetics, vascular factors, environment and lifestyle can independently
  and/or synergistically lead to cere-brovascular injuries including BBB dysfunction,
  pericyte degeneration and cerebral blood flow reductions (oli-gemia), initiating
  a cascade of events that can either 1) directly cause neuronal injury and damage
  independently of Aβ (Hit 1, blue), and/or 2) accelerate the Aβ-dependent neurodegeneration
  (Hit 2, red). In the Aβ-dependent pathway, BBB dysfunction leads to faulty clearance
  of Aβ from brain, whereas reduced brain perfusion increases Aβ production, both
  causing Aβ accumulation in the brain. Reduced brain perfusion (Hit 1) and elevated
  levels of Aβ (Hit 2) can independently and/or synergistically lead to Tau hyperphosphorylation
  (p-Tau) and formation of filamentous Tau pathology. Additionally, the two hits can
  exacerbate neuroinflammation.
