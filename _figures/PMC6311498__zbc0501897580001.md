caption: Cartoon illustrating the intracellular distribution of ATP7A, ATP7B, and
  DBH. ATP7A is located in the TGN and transports copper (green balls) into the lumen
  of this compartment. ATP7B is in vesicles where it sequesters Cu from the cytosol
  and regulates the amount of cytosolic Cu available to ATP7A. DBH receives its Cu
  cofactor as it matures within the secretory pathway (most likely from ATP7A). The
  fraction of DBH is then proteolytically processed. Soluble DBH is sorted to two
  main destinations. Some soluble DBH and a noncleaved membrane-bound DBH are sorted
  to secretory granules. In secretory granules, DBH converts DA into NE, which is
  secreted together with the soluble DBH into the extracellular space in response
  to extracellular stimuli (regulated secretion). Another fraction of soluble DBH
  is modified within the secretory pathway and sorted to vesicles, which undergo constitutive
  trafficking to the plasma membrane. The vesicles fuse with the membrane and export
  active soluble DBH in the absence of neuronal stimulation (constitutive export).
