caption: Activation of BV2 microglia could trigger a strong inflammatory reaction
  in PC12 cell apoptosis by toll-like receptor signaling pathway. LPS-treated BV2
  microglia had increased levels of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, and release of inflammatory
  mediator IL-1 β significantly increased. The inflammatory mediator up-regulated
  Bax to Bcl-2 ratio to promote PC12 cell apoptosis and injury. IL-1RA pretreatment
  protected PC12 cell from IL-1β-induced injury through down-regulating Bax to Bcl-2
  ratio to suppress apoptosis
