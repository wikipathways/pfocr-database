caption: 'Diagram (adapted from information presented in reference ) of genes and
  metabolic intermediates involved in purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Green arrows
  indicate enzymatic steps for turnover of the guanine moiety or for assimilation
  of external hypoxanthine into the guanine pool. The thick green arrow indicates
  the increased breakdown of dGTP due to elevated dGTP triphosphohydrolase activity
  in the optA1 strain. The blue arrows indicate steps in the main de novo purine biosynthesis
  pathway. The red dashed line indicates the repressive effect of accumulated guanine
  (Gua) on the PurR-controlled genes. Some indicated genes and gene product pairs
  are as follows: dgt, dGTP triphosphohydrolase; deoD, purine nucleoside phosphorylase;
  gpt, guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; hpt, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase;
  purR, PurR purine repressor; purF, amidophosphoribosyl transferase; purE, N5-carboxyaminoimidazole
  ribonucleotide mutase; purK, N5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase.
  The red cross indicates lack of Gpt activity in the gpt deletion strain. Chemical
  abbreviations: Gua, guanine; Hx, hypoxanthine; dG-Rib, deoxyguanosine; P-Rib-PP,
  5′-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP); 5-PRA, 5′-phosphoribosylamine; AIR, 5′-aminoimidazole
  ribonucleotide; N5-CAIR, N5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide; CAIR, 4-carboxy-5-aminoimidazole
  ribonucleotide; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide.'
