caption: Trimmed N-linked glycans promote ERAD of terminally misfolded proteins. The
  glycans on unfolded glycoproteins that exit the CNX/CRT cycle (a) are trimmed by
  ERMan1 (b). Successive processing by α1–2 mannosidase activity of the EDEMs yields
  protein-linked glycans on misfolded proteins with 5–7 mannose residues (c–e) that
  are recognized by the ERAD lectins OS-9 and XTP3-B (f) for targeting to the HRD1-Sel1
  complex (g) for subsequent retrotranslocation of the misfolded protein into the
  cytosol. Accumulation of hypoglycosylated misfolded glycoproteins (h, red asterisks
  indicate skipped sequons) is one cause of ER stress that is sensed by the UPR sensors
  (i). For simplicity, only a single stress sensor (Ire1, PERK or ATF-6) is shown.
  The gray arrow in diagram f indicate that the pathway shown is less favored relative
  to those shown with black arrows.
