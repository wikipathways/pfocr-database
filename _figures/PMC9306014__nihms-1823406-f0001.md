caption: a | Cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) transcription and translation
  can be activated by mitogenic stimuli and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs),, or inhibited
  by the action of several microRNAs (miRNAs),. b | CDK4–cyclin D complex assembly
  and stabilization require components of the chaperone machinery such as heat shock
  protein 90 (HSP90) in complex with the co-chaperone CDC37 (HSP90–CDC37) and HSP70,
  which assist folding and stabilization of cyclin D and CDK4 (REFS,,–). c | Canonically,
  CDK4 phosphorylates the tumour suppressor retinoblastoma (Rb; grey dots), enabling
  the transcription factor E2F to enter the nucleus and transcribe its target genes,
  promoting progression through the S phase of the cell cycle. The tumour suppressor
  p16 is an endogenous inhibitor of CDK4 function. Several signalling cascades have
  a role in the transcriptional regulation of CDK4–cyclin D kinase complex including
  MYC, RAS–mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)–extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF),. Von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) regulates
  CDK4 by controlling the expression of CDK4 and HIF,. Reciprocal activating mechanisms
  exist between CDK4 and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT–mechanistic target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (mTOR regulates CDK4–T172 phosphorylation, whereas CDK4
  phosphorylates the endogenous mTOR inhibitor tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2)),,,.
  Many genes and proteins involved in CDK4 function and regulation are known to be
  altered in renal cell carcinoma (RCC, starred proteins). PTM, post-translational
  modification; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.
