caption: Molecular mechanisms of DNA vaccines. Transfected double stranded B DNA (dsDNA)
  is sensed by cytoplasmic DNA receptors such as interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16),
  DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 41 (DDX41) and the cGAMP synthase (cGAS),
  each of which can activate the STING▸TBK1▸IRF3 pathway to induce type 1 interferon
  production. An additional cytoplasmic innate immune pathway activated nonspecifically
  by transfected dsDNA is the cytoplasmic AIM2 inflammasome. Other dsDNA receptors
  and innate immune activation pathways exist, including a recently identified STING/IRF7
  signaling pathway required for DNA vaccine immunogenicity. By contrast, the endosomal
  innate immune receptor TLR9 recognizes specific unmethylated CpG DNA motifs in DNA
  vaccines. To improve innate immune activation, addition of optimized immunostimulatory
  CpG motifs in the vector backbone may be used to increase TLR9 activation. Immunostimulatory
  RNA expressed from the vector may be used to activate alternative RNA sensing innate
  immune receptors such as RIG-I using an additional RNA Polymerase III RNA expression
  cassette (plasmid backbone adjuvant) or incorporation of RNA recognizing TLR agonist
  motifs such as CpG RNA into the 3′ UTR. Due to limited transgene expression after
  DNA vaccination in large animals, vector modifications (e.g., <500 bp bacterial
  region Nanoplasmid™ vectors; intronic bacterial region MIP vectors) and deliveries
  (e.g., Electroporation) that improve transgene expression also improve adaptive
  immunity. Adapted under a Creative Commons Attribution license from Williams, 2013.
