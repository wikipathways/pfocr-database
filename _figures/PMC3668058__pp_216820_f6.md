  lipases, which results in the release of fatty acids (green arrow) into the cytoplasm,

  acids in the . While these fatty acids would have originally been sourced from de
  novo biosynthesis, due to the lipase activity, they could now come from the -released
  cytoplasmic pool (olive long dashed arrow). This creates a futile cycle of  biosynthesis/hydrolysis
  and reduces the quantity of additional de novo fatty acids required for  biosynthesis
  in D1 leaves. In contrast, the coexpression of DGAT and Cys-oleosin in D1o3-3 leaves
  leads to the formation of stable  (dark red arrow), which prevent the exposure of
  the  core to endogenous lipases. Combined with the continual expression of DGAT,
  this creates a sustained demand for fatty acids that elevates de novo biosynthesis
