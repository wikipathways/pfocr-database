caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of action of glutamatergic modulators and other putative
  rapid-acting antidepressants. Disinhibition hypothesis: Ketamine and esketamine
  selectively block N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). These are expressed on
  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibitory interneurons, and their blockade
  decreases interneuron activity that, in turn, leads to disinhibition of pyramidal
  neurons and enhanced glutamatergic firing. Glutamate then binds to and activates
  post-synaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs).
  Inhibition of spontaneous NMDAR-mediated transmission: Alternatively, ketamine may
  induce rapid brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) translation in the hippocampus,
  reduce phosphorylation, and activate eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). Ketamine
  may also preferentially bind to NMDARs and affect neuronal NMDAR-mediating spontaneous
  excitatory transmission, which at rest keeps eEF2 phosphorylated and inhibits BDNF
  synaptic translation. De-suppression of BDNF translation then contributes to changes
  in synaptic plasticity that mediate ketamine’s antidepressant effects. AMPAR activation
  is also necessary for these effects. Inhibition of extra-synaptic NMDARs: Ketamine
  selectively blocks extra-synaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs, which are tonically
  activated by low levels of ambient glutamate regulated by the excitatory amino acid
  transporter 2 (EAAT2) located on astrocytes. Inhibition of the extra-synaptic GluN2B-NMDARs
  de-suppresses mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) function, which in
  turn induces protein synthesis. Blockade of spontaneous NMDAR activation inhibits
  eEF2 kinase (eEF2K) activity, thus preventing phosphorylation of its eEF2 substrate.
  This effect subsequently enhances BDNF translation and, ultimately, protein synthesis.
  Inhibition of lateral habenula (LHb) neurons: In animal models, local neuronal firing
  in a single brain region known as the lateral habenula (LHb) drives significant
  depressive-like behaviors. Ketamine decreases burst activity in the LHb by blocking
  NMDAR-dependent burst activity in the LHb and disinhibiting the downstream activity
  of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and serotoninergic neurons, which are responsible
  for activating the reward centers in the brain. Local blockade of NMDARs or low-voltage-sensitive
  T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels (T-VSCCs) in the LHb sufficed to induce
  rapid antidepressant effects. The role of ketamine metabolites: (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine
  (HNK) exerts NMDAR inhibition-independent antidepressant actions by activating AMPAR-mediated
  synaptic potentiation.Other glutamatergic modulators: Metabotropic glutamate receptor
  (mGluR) 2/3 antagonists are thought to enhance synaptic glutamate levels, thereby
  boosting AMPAR transmission and firing rates and extracellular monoamine levels.
  GLYX-13, which has partial agonist properties at NMDARs, is hypothesized to activate
  mTORC and subsequently induce protein synthesis. GLYX-13 requires AMPA and activity-dependent
  BDNF release, but unlike ketamine does not produce glutamate bursts. AMPAR activation
  enhances BDNF release, activates the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor,
  and subsequently promotes protein synthesis by activating the mTORC complex. AC,
