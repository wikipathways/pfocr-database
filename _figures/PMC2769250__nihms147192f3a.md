caption: (A) Heme biosynthesis is an eight-step enzymatic pathway that begins with
  the synthesis of ALA in the mitochondria from the amino acid glycine and succinyl-CoA,
  derived from the Krebs Cycle. The processes for import of glycine and the export
  of ALA for heme synthesis are unknown. ALA is then transported from the mitochondria
  into the cytosol where, in mammals. the subsequent four steps occur. The intermediate
  CPgenIII is transported back into the mitochondria for the final three steps. Researchers
  have demonstrated that ABCB6 or OGC may import CPgenIII into the mitochondria. The
  final step is the insertion of ferrous iron, transported by Mitoferrin (Mfrn), into
  the protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) ring, and this reaction is catalyzed by ferrochelatase
  (FECH). Mitochondrial enzymes are highlighted in red and cytosolic enzymes in green.
  (B) Structures of 2-oxoglutarate and the fluorescent porphyrin derivatives palladium
  meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin and palladium meso-tetra(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin.
  Compare Fig. 3B with the structure of heme b in .
