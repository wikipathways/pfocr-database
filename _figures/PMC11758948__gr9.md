caption: Model of cell division regulation by the EphA2–Ephexin4–RhoG signaling pathway.
  EphA2 and Ephexin4 are phosphorylated downstream of CDK1, and their interaction
  promotes localization of RhoG-GTP to the plasma membrane. Phosphorylated Ephexin4
  at S41 activates RhoG, which promotes M-phase progression through chromosome alignment
  (blue line). Inhibition of Ephexin4 phosphorylation leads to misalignment of chromosomes,
  resulting in delay in M-phase progression via SAC activation (red line)
