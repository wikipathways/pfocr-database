caption: 'Color codes: the orange block contains the triacylglycerol biosynthesis
  pathway; the green block contains gene manipulations for removal competing pathways
  in central carbon metabolism; the turquoise block contains the TCA cycle and the
  glyoxylate bypass pathway, which is shown in green arrows and activated through
  knockout of the regulatory repressor gene iclR.'
