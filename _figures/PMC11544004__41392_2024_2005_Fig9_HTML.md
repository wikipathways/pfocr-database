caption: 'Impact of the environment on NK cells: Phytoncide model. From the pine beetle
  to humans, a response to xenobiotics via the xenobiotic response element is mediated
  by the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is induced by natural compounds and environmental
  pollutants that bind and activate AhR. Endogenous compound FICZ derived from Tryptophan
  metabolism can bind AhR with high affinity and trigger the expression of phase I
  enzymes, IDO, TDO, and IL-22 with wide-ranging physiological effects. AhR activation
  by FICZ affects NK cytolytic activity, and migration to tumors, with possibly a
  shift in Tryptophan metabolism by the microbiome from the Kynurenine pathway, which
  mainly degrades tryptophan in the liver by TDO, and IDO, to the beneficial 5-HT
  pathway by TPH, in the gut and brain and the Indole pathway catalyzed by the gut
  microbiota to generate indoles such FICZ which reinforces this signaling loop and
  enhances cancer control'
