caption: The schematic diagram depicts the function of MSCs in enhancing the expression
  of ENaC in ALI induced by LPS. The accumulation of edema fluid in alveoli was a
  major characteristic in ALI. MSC-secreted KGF upregulates Gab1 protein expression
  and inhibits the activation of the ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby upregulating
  the ENaC protein level in AT2 cells and alleviating LPS-induced pulmonary edema.
