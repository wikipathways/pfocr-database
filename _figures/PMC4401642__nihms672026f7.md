caption: '(A) Summary diagram for m-EcDHFR, laid out as in . The sizes of the colored
  circles indicate the concentrations of the unfolded (U), native (N), misfolded (M),
  and aggregated (A) states. The radii of the circles are proportional to the cube
  roots of the concentrations. Cube roots are used to enable the lowest and highest
  concentrations to be shown on the same diagram. The circles for “Synthesis” and
  “Degradation” represent the total concentration of protein synthesized and degraded
  over the 2 h time course of the simulation. The numerical values of each concentration
  are written below the circles. Blue text: best-fit biophysical parameters from the
  fit of FoldEco to the data. Red numbers: percentages of misfolded protein molecules
  that aggregate, engage the KJE recovery pathway, or engage the Lon degradation pathway.
  Black italic numbers: percentages of degraded protein taken from the unfolded or
  misfolded states. (B) As in (A), but for m-MmCRABP1. (C) As in (A) but for m-RA114.
  Note that qualitative descriptors are used for the biophysical processes in (B)
  and (C). See also .'
