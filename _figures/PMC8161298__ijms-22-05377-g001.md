caption: 'Phenotypic differences between embryonic and somatic cells. Fertilization
  of an oocyte by a spermatozoon forms a zygote, which subsequently develops the blastocyst.
  The blastocyst contains embryonic stem (ES) cells that eventually give rise to all
  somatic cell types. ES and somatic cells can be distinguished according to multiple
  aspects: their potency, telomerase activity, self-renewal capacity, cell cycle regulation,
  and preferred DNA repair mechanism. Both germ cells and germ cells tumors are derived
  from ES derived PGCs and therefore harbor the same embryonal characteristics.'
