caption: Flux variability analysis of fermentation with and without iron reduction
  using NAD(P)H. The mean of flux values (in mmol gDW−1 h−1) from model‐based samples
  was used to calculate the ratio of fermentation with iron reduction divided by fermentation
  without iron reduction for the reactions of glycolysis, fermentation, citric acid
  cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway. Grey lines show reactions were no flux
  was present in the model and gaps in the values within the figure legend indicate
  that these range was not represented. Flux ranges greater than 1 show reactions
  with higher flux ranges in fermentation with iron reduction and those less than
  1 show those with higher flux ranges in fermentation without iron reduction. [Color
