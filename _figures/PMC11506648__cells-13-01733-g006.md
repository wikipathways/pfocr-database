caption: A schematic representation of AREG’s role in ESCC-MSC interactions. AREG
  secretion from ESCC cells, enhanced through direct contact with MSCs, promotes cell
  survival and migration via the EGFR-Erk/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. AREG also enhances
  the migration of MSCs and their differentiation into CAFs
