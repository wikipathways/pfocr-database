caption: Outline of Ammonia Metabolism by Urea and Glutamine cycles in the Human body.
  The -glutamine cycle is a metabolic pathway that describes the formation of glutamate
  (reversible reaction-red arrow) from α-ketoglutarate carried out by glutamate synthetase,
  while branch chain amino acids are converted to branch chain α-keto acid by branch
  chain dehydrogenase enzyme.
