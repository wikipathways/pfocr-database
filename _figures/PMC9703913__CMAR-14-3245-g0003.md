caption: Cofilin regulates tumor migration and invasion represented by glioma. Dephosphorylating
  cofilin on Ser3 mediates its activation. Activated cofilin promotes tumor cell migration
  and invasion by regulating cell dynamics and EMT/EMT-like process. Cofilin can be
  inactivated through phosphorylation driven by LIMKs on Ser3 site, while SSH and
  CIN can dephosphorylate cofilin to restore its’ activity. LIMK is activated by the
  Rho-GTPases including Rac, CDC42 and Rho through their effector kinases, PAK1 and
  ROCK1/2 mediating the phosphorylation of LIMK on Thr508 resulting in its activation.
  Multiply proteins known to regulate the activity of cofilin via Rho-GTPases/ROCK&PAK/LIMK/cofilin
  signaling pathway resulting in regulating the actin-cytoskeleton dynamics, are SEP17,
  P2Y2R, NKCC1, CIRP8, Nogo-A, CD73, PRP4, AKT2, PKCζ, Cathepsin B, uPAR, P4, WDR1,
  Arp2/3. Some non-coding RNAs including miR451, miR29-A/b/c and ARST are also considered
  to participate in the regulation of cofilin through similar process. Non-SMAD signaling
  of TGF-β can induce rapid activation of RhoA, followed by phosphorylation and activation
  of LIMK2/cofilin1 pathway, resulting in regulating EMT/EMT-like process. Furthermore,
  TWIST1, KITENIN, VSIG4 and β-elemene are considered to be involved in the direct
  regulation of EMT/EMT-like process. Created with BioRender.com.

    Dephosphorylating cofilin on Ser3 mediates its activation. Activated cofilin promotes
