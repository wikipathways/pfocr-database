caption: Heavy metal stress acts on the heat shock pathway by activating HSF1 which
  interacts with the HSEs of target genes. Of key importance in this respect are affinity
  and position of the HSEs within the target promoter. Consensus HSEs were used to
  generate a high sensitivity reporter construct for detection of heavy metals.
