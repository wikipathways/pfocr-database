caption: Proposed model for the interaction of LBR, Rab5, Nup205, and NXF1 in the
  PI3K/mTOR/AKT signaling pathway. The PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathway plays a role in protein
  and lipid synthesis, metabolic processes and cell survival and proliferation. This
  pathway is also necessary to promote viral replication. Four cellular proteins have
  been shown to be differentially regulated during influenza virus infection. We propose
  that these proteins tie into the PI3K/mTOR/AKT pathway to facilitate viral replication.
  (1) LBR is a structural component of the nuclear envelope. Activation of LBR causes
  the destabilization of the nuclear envelope and induction of cell division, affecting
  active transport of material across the nuclear membrane. (2) LBR has sterol reductase
  activity, a component necessary for lipid synthesis, and lipogenesis is controlled
  by this pathway. Rab5 (3) interferes with insulin-mediated activation of PI3K and
  (4) inhibits mTORC1 activation by sequestering it away from the lysosomal compartment
  which subsequently affects downstream autophagy regulation. (5) The M2-ion channel
  of influenza virus has a role in subverting autophagy. (6) Nup205 is a component
  of the nuclear pore complex and acts as a regulatory gate controlling the size of
  proteins passing through the nuclear envelope. (7) The viral protein NS1 interacts
  with NXF1 and inhibits cellular mRNA export from the nucleus. (8) NS1 can also activate
  PI3K.(9) PI3K, mTOR and AKT activation has been shown to inhibit NFX1-mediated export
  of cellular mRNAs.
