caption: Putative metabolic map of a bacterium within the miscellaneous Bacteroidales
  metagenome reconstructed from the metagenomic data. Links to the pathways of amino
  acid biosynthesis are shown in blue, and links to vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis
  are shown in green. Light colors (gray, light blue, or light green) represent steps
  in the metabolism that we think are not common for all bacteria from the metagenome.
  Dashed arrows indicate pathways that are lacking one or more essential genes. Menaquinone
  is shown in red because its biosynthetic pathway is incomplete. ABC, ATP-binding
  cassette transporter; AcCoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; AcP, acetyl phosphate; amt, ammonia
  transporter; C1, complex I; CoA, coenzyme A; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; FAD,
  flavin adenine dinucleotide; Fdx ox, oxidized ferredoxin; Fdx red, reduced ferredoxin;
  Frd, fumarate reductase; Fru6P, fructose-6-phosphate; Fuc, fucose; Fum, fumarate;
  G2P, glycerate 2-phosphate; G3P, glycerate 3-phosphate; Ga3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  Glc, glucose; Gly3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; Lac, l-lactate; LacAdh, lactaldehyde;
  Mal, malate; MG, methylglyoxal; MQ, menaquinone; 2OG, 2-oxoglutarate; OxAc, oxaloacetate;
