caption: (A) Suggested signaling of the early stages of 1,25D-induced monocytic differentiation.
  Binding of 1,25D to VDR stimulates its translocation to the cell nucleus where it
  heterodimerizes with RXR, and in myeloid precursor cells, it transactivates genes
  containing VDREs in their promoter regions. These include genes that encode proteins
  involved in calcium homeostasis and bone integrity, such as osteocalcin (hOC), osteopontin
  (hOP), and the 1,25D-catabolic enzyme 24-hydroxylase (24OHase). It is postulated
  that the regulators of signaling pathways, e.g. KSR-1, are also up-regulated in
  myeloid cells and alter Ras signaling from the cell membrane so that signaling by
  MAPKs (MEKs, ERKs, and JNKs) increases the AP-1 activity. This can have a positive
  feedback effect on differentiation by increasing VDR abundance. It is also suggested
  that a potential negative feedback mechanism is provided by p38 MAPK, as inhibition
  of its signaling by SB203580 enhances 1,25D-induced monocytic differentiation. (B)
  Later stages of 1,25D-induced differentiation. This figure illustrates that the
  transcription factor EGR-1, known to be up-regulated by 1,25D (), can increase the
  expression of p35/Nck5a (p35) activator of Cdk5. Cdk5 activated by p35 then can
  phosphorylate MEK on Thr286, a site that inactivates it (), as shown by the Θ symbol.
  This diminishes ERK1/2 activity downstream from MEK (not shown here), but Raf-1
  can activate p90RSK directly, which, in turn, activates the transcription factor
  C/EBP β, perhaps bound to pRb, and increases the expression of CD14, as part of
  monocytic differentiation. The activation of p90RSK may also be increased by the
  JNK pathway, which also activates AP-1, and may lead to VDR expression. The interplay
  between the signaling by 1,25D, growth factor, and stress add to the overall complexity
  of the induction of the monocytic phenotype.
