caption: 'The AKT/TGF-β pathway and subcellular localization of differentially regulated
  genes connected with this signaling network: Within the AKT/TGF-β signaling pathway
  a total of 26 genes were differentially expressed in Group 1 (a); whereas 21 genes
  were shown to be regulated in Group 2 (b). (Green marks indicate upregulation, red
  marks down-regulation of the respective mRNA in 229R cells.)'
