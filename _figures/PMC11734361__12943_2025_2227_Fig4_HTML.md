caption: 'Tumor-associated-mycobiome regulates the physiological and immune responses
  of cancer through different signaling pathways. Dectin-1, Dectin-2, Dectin-3, and
  Mincle are CLRs that interact with Syk to activate PLCγ and then enhance the function
  of PKCδ that is critically involved in CARD9 phosphorylation at T231 with the aid
  of Vav proteins in the coiled-coil domain, allowing the formation of CBM complex
  (CARD9-BCL10-MALT1). The CBM complex activates NF-κB and MAPK pathways, subsequently
  increasing inflammatory cytokines production. CARD9 also binds with RAS-GRF-1 and
  H-RAS to activate ERK pathways. CARD9 can free Rac1 from LyGDI to promote ROS. Fungi
  induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation in MDSCs via Dectin-3, which depends on glycogen
  metabolism-dependent glycolysis. Fungi promote transcription of NLRP3, Pro-caspase-1,
  and IL-1β genes through activation of the JAK-STAT1 signaling pathway, whereas mtROS,
  as a second activation signal, is required for fungal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. IL-1β production is regulated by two steps: transcription and maturation.
  Typical NF-κB first induces IL-1β into an inactive precursor called pro-IL-1β, and
  then pro-IL-1β is cleaved into active IL-1β by active caspase-1. SyK, spleen tyrosine
  kinase; PLCγ, phosphoinositide phospholipase Cγ; PKCδ, protein kinase Cδ; JAK, Janus
  kinase; STAT; NF-Κb, nuclear factor-κB; STAT, signal transducer and activator of
  transcription'
