caption: Mechanisms for lowering nitric oxide (NO) availability in cardiovascular
  and metabolic disorders (A). Increased angiotensin II (AngII) levels, asymmetric
  dimethylarginine (ADMA), and low plasma l-arginine concentration are all conditions
  likely to reduce NO· production. Inflamed adipose tissue (due to its expansion—obesity)
  can lead to (i) ↑ release of inflammatory cytokines; (ii) ↑ release of AngII; (iii)
  ↑ protein catabolism (due to the pro-inflammatory state); and (iv) ↑ activation
  of macrophages. Angiotensin II, acting through its receptor (AT1R), increases generation
  of superoxide (O2−), primarily through activation of reduced nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) oxidase. O2− reacts with NO∙ to form peroxynitrite
  (ONOO∙), a very reactive and destructive molecule, leading to decreased availability
  of NO∙. Moreover, superoxide is a known inhibitor of dimethylarginine dimethylhydrolase
  (DDAH), a key regulatory enzyme, which controls the metabolism of ADMA. ADMA is
  an endogenous methylated amino acid that inhibits the constitutive endothelial and
  neuronal isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). ADMA is released by protein hydrolysis;
  thus, increased catabolism induced by several inflammatory cytokines can elevate
  the ADMA levels. As DDAH uses ADMA as a substrate and regulates plasma levels of
  ADMA, it may influence the bioavailability of NO∙ and possibly contribute to changes
  in blood pressure. Homocysteine (an indirect substrate for the synthesis of ADMA)
  is also an inhibitor of the DDAH enzyme (via oxidation of a sulfhydryl group). Activation
  of macrophages (by pro-inflammatory cytokines) may lead to arginase secretion, an
  enzyme that metabolizes l-arginine to urea and l-ornithine. Chronically elevated
  arginase plasma levels can reduce plasma concentration and availability of l-arginine
  for NO∙ synthesis. l-Ornithine may also compete for the same transporter used by
  l-arginine (cationic amino acid transporter (CAT-1)) at the cell membrane level.
  In addition, low availability of l-arginine to NOS enzymes can increase superoxide
  synthesis via a mechanism known as endothelial NOS (eNOS) uncoupling (in the absence
  of sufficient l-arginine, the enzyme donates electrons to oxygen forming superoxide;
  however, considering the l-arginine concentrations in plasma/cells and the Michaelis
  constant (Km) of eNOS, the contribution of this pathway to superoxide production
  is still under debate). How l-arginine supplementation can aid the condition (B).
  l-Arginine supplementation can restore the levels of l-arginine and NO∙ by (i) preventing
  eNOS uncoupling (thus reducing superoxide formation); (ii) providing enough l-arginine
  for NO synthesis according to the physiological requirements; (iii) increasing guanosine
  triphosphate (GTP) cyclohydrolase I activity )an enzyme that is activated by l-arginine,
  and is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)—an
  essential co-factor for NOS activity). Both l-arginine and NO∙ have important metabolic
  functions, increasing protein synthesis pathways (by activating mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR)) and through activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator
  1α (PGC-1α), lead to mitochondrial biogenesis. Metabolization of l-arginine by arginase
  may lead to polyamine synthesis, essential for cell growth and angiogenesis. Altogether,
  increased blood vessels and vasodilation (induced by normalization of NO∙ availability)
  will lead to increased nutrient delivery and oxygen consumption. For details on
  mechanisms, please read References [,,]. This model describes several possibilities
  of mechanisms in a representative cell. Mechanisms may vary between cells due to
  the presence or absence of enzymes, receptors, and transporters.
