caption: 'Beginning with tryptophan through the key intermediate and the focus of
  this work, DLA. Alternative branches of the ergot pathway are indicated by the faded
  regions. Colored arrows indicate the stages of the pathway. Green: early pathway
  common to all ergot producing species, leading to the first major branch point of
  the pathway at chanoclavine-I-aldehyde. The early pathway consists of four steps,
  requiring five enzymes (DmaW, EasF, EasC, EasE, and EasD). Blue: middle and late
  pathway accounting for the diversification of ergoline products found in the various
  lineages of ergot producing species. This stage of the pathway consists of two steps,
  requiring at least three enzymes (EasA, EasG, and CloA). Orange: Alternative branches
  of the pathway that lead to other ergoline derivatives.'
