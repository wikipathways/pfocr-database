caption: Glycerol biosynthetic pathway. Glycerol is synthesized from an intermediate
  in the glycolysis, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), by two-step enzymatic reactions.
  The first enzyme is glycrol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpd1/Gpd2), which reduces
  DHAP using NADH as reducing agent. The second enzyme is glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase
  (Gpp1/Gpp2), which removes phosphate from glycerol-3-P to generate glycerol.
