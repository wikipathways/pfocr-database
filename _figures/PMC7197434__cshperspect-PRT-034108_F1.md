caption: Pharmacologic stress-responsive signaling pathway activation coordinates
  transcription and translation of chaperone pathways and folding enzymes that resculpt
  the folding free energy diagram of the mutant protein-of-interest in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), enhancing its folding and minimizing misfolding, increasing the
  population of the mutant protein in the folded state. Pharmacologic chaperones bind
  to the folded state of the mutant protein, lowering its free energy, further increasing
  its population. Collectively, these mechanisms of action create more folded mutant
  protein that can engage the trafficking machinery, leading to increased function.
