caption: 'Apoptosis works through two main, alternative pathways: death receptor-mediated
  (or extrinsic) and mitochondria-dependent (or intrinsic). The former pathway is
  initiated by ligation of specific death receptors by their ligands. The main death
  receptors—Fas and tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) related apoptosis inducing ligand
  (TRAIL) receptors DR4 and DR5—induce cell death following ligation with Fas ligand
  (FasL) or TRAIL, respectively, followed by recruitment of procaspase 8. This process
  gives rise to caspase 8 activation. The latter induces apoptosis by directly activating
  caspase 3 or by cleaving bid (BH3 interacting domain death agonist), resulting in
  mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent release of cytochrome C and activation
  of caspases 9 and 3. Caspase 3 promotes the typical apoptosis features, including
  DNA fragmentation and cell death in several tissues. The mitochondrial pathway is
  partly influenced by bcl family members bound to the mitochondrial membrane, including
  bax and bcl-2, which are, respectively, pro- or antiapoptotic regulatory proteins.
  The antiapoptotic proteins bcl-2 and bcl-XL inhibit cytochrome c release, whereas
  bcl-2—associated X protein(bax), bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (bak), and bid,
  all proapoptotic proteins, promote its release from mitochondria. Cytochrome C and
  deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) bind to apoptotic protease activating factor
  (APAF-1) to form a multimeric complex that recruits and activates procaspase 9,
  an apoptosis-mediating executioner protease that in turn activates caspase 3, resulting
  in cell apoptosis.'
