caption: 'Panel a - PGE2 can bind the EP2 receptor. This stimulates Gαs, which activates
  adenylyl cyclase (AC), which produces cyclic AMP (cAMP). This nucleotide induces
  protein kinase A (PKA) activation. The PGE2 binding to the EP2 receptor determines
  the release of Gβγ subunits, which stimulate AKT through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K). EP2 can also promote the activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway through the
  SRC protein. In the cartoon are depicted the drugs and inhibitors of some key factors
  belonging to the PGE2 signaling pathways. siEP2: siRNA against EP2 mRNA; siGαs:
  siRNA against Gαs; PP1: SRC specific inhibitor; LY294002 (LY): PI3K inhibitor; bisindolylmaleimide
  IX (BSD): PKA inhibitor; U0126 (U0): MEK1/2 specific inhibitor. COX2: cyclooxygenase
  2; PXB: parecoxib. Panel b – The IGFBP-4 release following EP2 or Gαs silencing.
  The picture shows the IGFBP-4 levels in the MSC-conditioned medium 48 hr following
  H2O2 treatment in the presence of either siRNA against EP2 (siEP2) or against Gαs
  (siGαs). Control siRNAs were indicated as siCTRL. Membrane staining with Ponceau
  S acid red was used loading control (LC). The graph shows the densitometric analysis
  of the IGFBP-4 level. The data are expressed in arbitrary units. The statistical
  difference (p<0.001) between untreated cells (first column) with sample treated
  with H2O2 (second column) is indicated with *** symbol. Statistical differences
  (p<0.001) among H2O2 treated cells (second column) with those treated with different
  siRNAs (third, fourth, fifth column) are indicated with ### symbol. Panel c – The
  picture shows the IGFBP-4 levels in MSC conditioned medium 48 hr following H2O2
  treatment in presence of either Bisindolylmaleimide IX (BSD) (PKA ⊥), or LY294002
  (LY) (PI3K ⊥), or PP1 (SRC ⊥) or U0126 (U0) (MEK1/2 ⊥). Membrane staining with Ponceau
  S acid red was used loading control (LC). The graph shows the densitometric analysis
  of the IGFBP-4 level. The data are expressed in arbitrary units. The statistical
  difference (p<0.001) between untreated cells (first column) with sample treated
  with H2O2 (second column) is indicated with *** symbol. The statistical differences
  (p<0.001) among H2O2 treated cells (second column) with those treated with different
  drugs (from third to sixth column) are indicated with ### symbol.'
