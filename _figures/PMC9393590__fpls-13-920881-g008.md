caption: Model of habitat-adapted heterologous symbiont (HAHS)-induced changes in
  the light reactions of photosynthesis and associated alternative electron transfer
  pathways. The light energy distribution (pink side) and electron transport (blue
  side) of the light reactions of photosynthesis are shown. In the control plants,
  the photochemical energy flows to NADPH, mainly via the linear electron flow (LEF)
  pathway. Reduced Y(NO) and increased Y(II) indicate a lower probability of non-regulated
  dissipation but a higher probability of energy conduction to photochemistry as observed
  for HAHS-treated plants. As a result, plants exhibited higher FV/FM values and high
  plant growth. An increase in Chl content, the Chl a/b ratio, and beta-carotene but
  a reduction of XC/Chl a+b suggests a reduction of antenna size and an increase of
  PSII reaction centers in agreement with the increase in photosynthetic performance.
  High ETRMAX with a small antenna and no PSII damage indicates highly efficient energy
  consumption in the Calvin cycle induced by HAHS interaction. Plants under salt stress
  without HAHS did not exhibit differences in Y(NO) or Y(NPQ) dissipation, indicating
  that no induced protective mechanism was present in the antenna. However, a significant
  increase in Y(II) linked to lower plant size was found, suggesting that a salt-induced
  mechanism in tomato plants without HAHS is related to the activation of alternative
  sinks such as photorespiration. Induced stomatal closure due to saline stress reduces
  CO2/O2 ratio increases the photorespiration probability. Photorespiration reduces
  the energy destined for photosynthetic Calvin Benson cycle, thereby affecting plant
  growth. In plants treated with HAHS under saline conditions, the HAHS protects plant
  photosynthesis by increasing the regulated thermal energy dissipation Y(NPQ) pathway,
  which decreases the potential for ROS formation in the LHCII antenna. This is also
  reflected in high FV/FM values compared to those of the control and control + NaCl
  plants. PsBS, pigment-binding protein associated with photosystem II (PSII); VDE,

  description: Model of habitat-adapted heterologous symbiont (HAHS)-induced changes
    in the light reactions of photosynthesis and associated alternative electron transfer
    pathways. The light energy distribution (pink side) and electron transport (blue
    side) of the light reactions of photosynthesis are shown. In the control plants,
    the photochemical energy flows to NADPH, mainly via the linear electron flow (LEF)
    pathway. Reduced Y(NO) and increased Y(II) indicate a lower probability of non-regulated
    dissipation but a higher probability of energy conduction to photochemistry as
    observed for HAHS-treated plants. As a result, plants exhibited higher FV/FM values
    and high plant growth. An increase in Chl content, the Chl a/b ratio, and beta-carotene
    but a reduction of XC/Chl a+b suggests a reduction of antenna size and an increase
    of PSII reaction centers in agreement with the increase in photosynthetic performance.
    High ETRMAX with a small antenna and no PSII damage indicates highly efficient
    energy consumption in the Calvin cycle induced by HAHS interaction. Plants under
    salt stress without HAHS did not exhibit differences in Y(NO) or Y(NPQ) dissipation,
    indicating that no induced protective mechanism was present in the antenna. However,
    a significant increase in Y(II) linked to lower plant size was found, suggesting
    that a salt-induced mechanism in tomato plants without HAHS is related to the
    activation of alternative sinks such as photorespiration. Induced stomatal closure
    due to saline stress reduces CO2/O2 ratio increases the photorespiration probability.
    Photorespiration reduces the energy destined for photosynthetic Calvin Benson
    cycle, thereby affecting plant growth. In plants treated with HAHS under saline
    conditions, the HAHS protects plant photosynthesis by increasing the regulated
    thermal energy dissipation Y(NPQ) pathway, which decreases the potential for ROS
