caption: Schematic pathway of the role of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in cell damage
  signaling. In response to a severe damage or an insult signal, the cell releases
  a huge amount of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by different mechanisms (from ATP
  dense granules, ATP channels, …) and the extracellular concentration of ATP reached
  could be enough to activate the P2X7R, facilitating a flux of large ions and the
  activation of the inflammasome. The P2X7R/inflammasome complex induces the synthesis
  of IL-1β and IL-18, also regulated by NF-κB. This hypothesis agrees with the role
  of the P2X7R in processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, and necrosis.
