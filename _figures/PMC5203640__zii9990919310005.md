caption: Working model of CheY2 functions in B. burgdorferi enzootic cycle. A simplistic
  chemotaxis signaling pathway of B. burgdorferi is depicted. Based on our findings,
  we propose that after phosphorylation by the histidine kinase CheA, CheY3-P binds
  to the flagellar switch proteins to alter bacterial swimming behavior. Consequently,
  cheY3-mediated chemotaxis is found to affect dissemination and viability of B. burgdorferi
  in mice and ticks (). Dephosphorylation of CheY3-P is mediated by CheX-CheD ().
  Our current data suggest that CheY2 does not affect motility or chemotaxis despite
  having all domains/conserved amino acid residues seen in a classical CheY protein
  (). Because the mice are not being infected or partially infected by needle inoculation
  or tick bite, we propose that CheY2, after being phosphorylated by CheA, acts as
  a virulence determinant in B. burgdorferi. Instead of controlling motility, this
  CheY2-P may act as a transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulator to modulate
  B. burgdorferi gene expression or a protein's function/activity. Alternatively,
  its elevated expression in fed ticks may alter the bacterial or host gene functions
  in order for the spirochete to transmit from the vector to the murine host. The
  function of cheY1 in the enzootic cycle is unknown. As described in the text, B.
  burgdorferi possesses five MCPs, three CheW and two CheA proteins.
