caption: Mechanism and basic players of the MIA pathway. Incoming nuclear-encoded
  and cysteine-bearing proteins destined for the intermembrane space (IMS)-localised
  MIA pathway are firstly translocated through the Tranlocase of the Outer Membrane
  TOM complex. The ITS (IMS-Targeting Signal, shown in purple) interacts with Mia40
  through the “sliding–docking” model. Following interaction with Mia40, the substrate
  is released in an oxidised and stably folded conformation. The Cysteine-Proline-Cysteine
  CPC motif of Mia40 is left in a reduced state and requires re-oxidation to continue
  participating in import reactions. The re-oxidation of Mia40 is facilitated by Erv1,
  and then, the electrons are passed directly to molecular oxygen (resulting in the
  production of hydrogen peroxide), or to cytochrome c and respiratory chain complex
  IV in aerobic conditions, or to Osm1 in anaerobic conditions. Overall, the MIA pathway
  inserts disulphide bonds into proteins, trapping them in the IMS of mitochondria.
