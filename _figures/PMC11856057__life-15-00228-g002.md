caption: Signal transduction in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. (A) Hh ligand
  secretion depends on the transmembrane transporter Dispatched. When Hh ligands bind
  to PITCH receptors, they inhibit PITCH activity, which allows Smo proteins, which
  are similar to G-protein-coupled-receptors, to be phosphorylated and transported
  to the membrane of primary cilia in vertebrates. This prevents the phosphorylation
  of Gli proteins, promoting their conversion into Gli 2-3A activator form, and moves
  into the nucleus to activate the expression of Hh-related genes [142]. (B) When
  no Hh signal is secreted, PITCH inhibits the activation of Smo. The Gli 2-3 complex
  is retained in the cytosol by SuFu and undergoes partial phosphorylation under the
  influence of a protein kinase complex (PKA, CK1, and GSK3β). The Gli 2-3 repressor
  form is synthesized (Gli 2-3R) and translocated into the nucleus, where it binds
  to the DNA and inhibits the expression of the target genes
