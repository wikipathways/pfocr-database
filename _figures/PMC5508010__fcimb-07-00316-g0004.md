caption: 'Quiescent (A) and activated (B) metabolism in differentiated mammalian cells.
  In differentiated mammalian cells, including mucosal epithelial cells (MEC) and
  non-activated immune cells, the metabolism is characterized by low catabolic and
  anabolic activities. Low carbon fluxes fed by glucose and/or fatty acids run through
  glycolysis, PPP, and the TCA cycle; oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the predominant
  source of ATP. The metabolism of metabolically activated cells (B) is characterized
  by enhanced glucose uptake, highly activated (“aerobic”) glycolysis, reduced entrance
  of pyruvate into the TCA cycle and reduced OXPHOS. ATP is mainly produced by substrate
  phosphorylation in the glycolytic pathway. In addition these cells show often increased
  glutaminolysis which replenishes the TCA cycle, leading to citrate (eventually via
  reverse IDH) which is transported into the cytosol where it is converted by the
  ATP-dependent citrate lyase (ACL) into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA, two metabolites
  serving for biosynthesis of fatty acids/lipids and amino acids. ß-oxidation is inhibited.
  Metabolites of GL: G6P, glucose-6P; F6P, fructose-6P; FBP, fructose-1,6 biphosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetonephosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3P; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
