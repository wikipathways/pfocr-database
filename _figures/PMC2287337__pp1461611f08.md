caption: This diagram shows the temporal control of F-actin polymerization and emphasizes
  the role of Ca2+ and related factors. The circular pattern represents one complete
  cycle of an oscillation in growth rate. When growth is fast, SACs open allowing
  Ca2+ influx; the Rop/RIC3 signaling pathway may contribute to the Ca2+ increase.
  The Ca2+ rise activates different actin binding proteins (villin/gelsolin/profilin)
  both directly and indirectly through the stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC) and
  the degradation of PIP2 to IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). The formation of IP3 might
  also contribute to the Ca2+ rise by releasing ions from internal stores. Combined,
  these processes cause F-actin depolymerization and a concomitant increase in G-actin.
  Growth slows, SACs close, and Ca2+ influx reduces. Ca2+ is also sequestered by intracellular
  compartments such as the ER, mitochondria (MITO), or the vacuole (VAC), and/or extruded
  to the outside by plasma membrane pumps. The reduced [Ca2+] inactivates villin/gelsolin
  and profilin, allowing F-actin polymerization, with a decrease in G-actin. We suggest
  that metabolism, involving the oxidation of NADPH and an increase in ATP, enhances
  actin polymerization. An immediate effect would be to facilitate nucleotide exchange
  of ADP-G-actin. ATP will also activate the plasma membrane H+-ATPase and increase
  the alkaline band, which in turn will activate ADF, and promotes actin turnover
  in regions of alkaline pH. The Rop/RIC4 signaling path may also contribute to actin
  polymerization. Together these processes enhance actin polymerization and stimulate
  pollen tube growth, possibly by targeting vesicles to selected sites at the cell
  surface.
