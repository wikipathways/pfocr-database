caption: Immunological response of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 facilitates its entry into
  host cell via binding of its spike glycoprotein to ACE2, Sialic acid receptor, TMPRSS2,
  extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (CD147). Viral particle can induce
  activation of Alternative and Lectin pathway causing deposition of several Complement
  Proteins which in turn mediates severe inflammatory response. Hyperinflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-6, TNF, IL-17A, GM-CSF, G-CSF are found to be associated with
  Vascular injury. On the other hand, systemically and locally increased Angiotensin-II
  implicates its pathogenesis by overproduction of ROS via binding with AT1R whereas
  Angiotensin(1–7) counteract the activity of the Angiotensin-II by eNOS production
  via binding with the MasR but increased amount of Angiotensin-II affect the microvascular
  health by impairing eNOS mediated vasodilation
