caption: 'Transcriptome effects induced by CsMADS6 overexpression in transgenic tomato
  sepals. A, Heat map of selected carotenoid-associated DEGs from the M6SvsWTS comparison.
  The column represents the comparison of M6S (CsMADS6-overexpressing sepals) with
  WTS (wild-type sepals), and each row represents an individual gene. The intensity
  of log2 (fold change) is visualized using colors: red, up-regulated; blue, down-regulated.
  Gene identifiers and names are indicated at the left of each row. B, Schematic of
  the global transcriptional regulation by CsMADS6. Solid or dashed arrows indicate
  direct or indirect reaction flows in the pathway, respectively. The carotenoid-associated
  DEGs encoding enzymes that catalyze the reaction are shown at the sides of the arrows.
  Red and blue text denote expression levels with significant increases and decreases
  (P < 0.05), respectively. Yellow boxes highlight the critical intermediates in the
  metabolic pathways. The thick red and blue arrows indicate up- and down-regulation
  of the metabolic flux, respectively. Other processes, including primary pathways,
  secondary pathways, and phytohormone and TF levels (highlighted with yellow ovals),
  and their relation to accumulation of large amounts of a specific carotenoid (lycopene)
  in the transgenic sepals, are indicated. ABA, Abscisic acid; SLs, strigolactones.'
