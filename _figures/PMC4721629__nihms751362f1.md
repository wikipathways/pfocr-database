caption: (A) Engineered T cells expressing CARs can have both therapeutic and adverse
  effects.(B) User-controlled switches. A suicide switch triggers apoptosis of the
  engineered cells. An alternative, complementary approach is keeping the cells inactive
  until addition of an activating small molecule drug signal. Such an ON-switch could
  allow for titratable control (dialing up or down) of T cell activity.(C) Molecular
  strategies to control T cell activation. The normal T cell activation pathway (left)
  entails dual activation of the T Cell Receptor (TCR) and a co-stimulatory receptor
  to trigger key cellular responses such as cytokine production and proliferation.
  The conventional CAR (middle) combines an antigen recognition domain (single chain
  variable fragment; scFv) with main signaling motifs (such as ITAMs from TCR subunit
  CD3zeta) and co-stimulatory motifs constitutively linked in a single molecule. A
  strategy for constructing an ON-switch CAR utilizing a split construct (right).
  The split CAR design distributes key components from the conventional CAR into two
  physically separate polypeptides that can be conditionally re-assembled when a heterodimerizing
  small molecule agent is present. The design resembles an AND logic gate that requires
  “antigen + small molecule” combinatorial inputs for T cell activation.
