caption: A schematic representation of the proposed TGF-β1 signaling mechanism that
  promotes EMT. Early signaling through Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK-AP-1 causes up-regulation
  in Snail expression. Snail, a well-known repressor of junction proteins, then inhibits
  expression of claudin-1, claudin-2, and occludin. Snail also provides partial loss
  of E-cadherin, thus decreasing the level of substrate for β-catenin. Further stabilization
  of cytoplasmic β-catenin is achieved through PI3K signaling. Molecules downstream
  of PI3K such as AKT phosphorylate and deactivate p-GSK-3β, which is responsible
  for degrading both β-catenin and Snail through the ubiquitin proteosome pathway.
  Smad signaling, controlled through endocytosis of TGF-β receptor complex, promotes
  transcription of LEF-1, an alternative substrate for β-catenin. On forming β-catenin/LEF-1
  complexes, these molecules will then act to transcribe genes that will induce EMT.
