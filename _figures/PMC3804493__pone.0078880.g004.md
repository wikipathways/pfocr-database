caption: As established, when Hippo signaling is intact (A), Yki is properly regulated
  and tissues maintain proper growth control. We propose that alcohol promotes activation
  of the pathway at or upstream of Hippo to target alcohol-relevant growth-promoting
  activities (B) to maintain proper growth control upon alcohol exposure. When Hippo
  signaling is impaired (C), Yki becomes overactive and promotes tissue overgrowth.
  We propose that when Hippo signaling is impaired in the presence of alcohol (D),
  Yki acts to promote overgrowth as established, and additional alcohol-relevant targets
  of the pathway act to promote further overgrowth.
