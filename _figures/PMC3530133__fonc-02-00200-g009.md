caption: Functional expansion of Nrf2 in proliferating cells. In quiescent cells,
  Nrf2 is activated in response to oxidative stress and induces the expression of
  cytoprotective genes encoding antioxidant proteins and detoxification enzymes, which
  maintains the cellular redox homeostasis. In proliferating cells, Nrf2 activity
  is augmented especially under the sustained activation of PI3K–Akt pathway. Nrf2
  activates metabolic genes in addition to cytoprotective genes, resulting in the
  redirection of glucose and glutamine into anabolic pathway, which is advantageous
  for cell proliferation.
