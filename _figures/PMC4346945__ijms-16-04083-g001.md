caption: Autophagy-related factors are involved in the regulation of signal pathways
  in erythroid cells. The mTOR pathway is an important pathway that directly modulates
  the Ulk1 complex, and the inhibition of mTOR represses autophagy-related processes.
  Atg7 and Nix/Bnip3L are required for the removal of mitochondria, inducing the conversion
  of LC3-I to its lipid‑modified form, LC3-II, to promote autophagy. miRNAs can regulate
  the expressions of key transcriptional components, and Ca2+ promotes the binding
  of 15-lipoxygenase to reticulocyte mitochondria.
