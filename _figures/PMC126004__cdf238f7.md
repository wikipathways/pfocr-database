caption: Fig. 7. Hypothetical model depicting a possible functional role of PIF4 in
  phyB-regulated seedling de-etiolation. PIF4 is proposed to act in a branch of phyB-regulated
  photomorphogenesis that controls cell expansion. The model indicates, in simplified
  fashion, that phyB and phyA regulate multiple aspects of seedling de-etiolation,
  including cell expansion and plastid development in response to Rc and FRc, respectively,
  via PIF3. PIF4, in contrast, is proposed to act specifically in the phyB pathway
  to regulate a subset of genes involved in cell expansion.
