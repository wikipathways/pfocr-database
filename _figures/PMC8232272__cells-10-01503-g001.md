caption: Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Glucose is taken up by β-cells via
  the GLUT1 (human) or GLUT2 (rodent) transporter and undergoes metabolism via mitochondrial
  oxidation, leading to the generation of ATP. When the ATP/ADP ratio increases, the
  KATP channel closes, and membrane depolarization ensues. Subsequently, voltage-gated
  calcium channels open, and Ca2+ enters to drive insulin granule exocytosis. Meanwhile,
  in the mitochondria, converion of Succinyl-CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle by
  Succinyl-CoA synthetase causes the formation of mitochondrial GTP. In addition,
  in the soluble compartment, GTP can be formed from a salvage pathway using hypoxanthine
  as a substrate. The enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT)
  catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanine
  to guanosine monophosphate to GTP. GTP can be also formed by an alternate de novo
  synthesis pathway, using phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), by the enzyme phosphoribosylglycinamide
  formyltransferase (ADE8), which then increases the GTP/GDP ratio. This causes differential
  regulation of GTPases and enhances insulin release.
