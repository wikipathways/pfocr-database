caption: In the presence of metabolic stress, there is more glucose (Glc) or fatty
  acids (FAs) being oxidized in the TCA cycle in β-cell mitochondria, which pushes
  more electron donors (NADH and FADH2) into the electron transport chain (ETC) resulting
  in more ROS production. Under moderate stress, ROS causes cardiolipin oxidation,
  which may mitigate ROS generation through its interaction with respiratory chain
  proteins or UCP2. After ROS damage, iPLA2β/MLCLAT-mediated deacylation and reacylation
  promptly repair the oxidized cardiolipin. Under conditions of high oxidative stress
  or a defect in repair system, the accumulation of oxidized cardiolipin may activate
  UCP2, impairing the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and free cytochrome c,
  triggering apoptosis, which lead to β-cell failure and, ultimately, the onset of
  type 2 diabetes. Block arrows indicate the iPLA2β-mediated deacylation. CL, cardiolipin;
  MLCLAT, monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase. Black arrows show the stimulatory pathway;
  dashed line, the inhibitory pathway.
