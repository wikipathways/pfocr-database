caption: Fig 1 The standard and alternative models of progression of Barrett’s oesophagus
  to adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus. The standard pathway to cancer is through the
  oesophagitis-metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence. Recently, however, it
  has been recognised that submucosal glands can also develop into metaplastic cells
  (alternative pathway A). In addition, squamous oesophagitis can conceivably develop
  directly into adenocarcinoma via “microscopic metaplasia” without apparently transitioning
  through endoscopically evident metaplasia (alternative pathway B). The column on
  the left shows the environmental factors that help facilitate progression of the
  Barrett’s oesophagus. The column on the right shows the genetic (blue) and epigenetic
  (red) changes in the evolution of cancer. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli gene
