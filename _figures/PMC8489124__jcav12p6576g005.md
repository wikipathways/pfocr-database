caption: Analysis based on the pharmacological network of BHGJT in lung cancer. (A)
  Compound-target network for BHGJT in lung cancer. The pink nodes represent candidate
  active compounds, and the blue nodes represent potential protein targets. The edges
  represent the interactions between them, and lines are proportional to their degree.
  (B) KEGG analysis of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway associated with BHGJT.
