caption: The bidirectional pathways of the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA) involving
  the microbiota, the intestine, and the brain. Intestinal dysbiosis and derived metabolites
  in neuropathological conditions induce the barrier permeability defects and local
  inflammation with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, MAMPs (e.g., LPS), and activation
  of immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract. These signaling mediators as well
  as microbial metabolites (e.g., SCFAs and Trp derivatives) and hormones (e.g., GLP-1,
  PYY) can distantly affect the brain function via the humoral pathway. In addition,
  dysregulated regulation of the vagus nerve can also directly modulate the brain
  function. Together, these MGBA pathways culminate in regulating neuroinflammation
  and neuronal defects of the brain and behavioral abnormalities. Refer to the text
  for details. 5-HT; 5-hydroxyltryptamine; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; MAMPs, microbe-associated
  molecular patterns; SCFAs, short chain fatty acids; Trp; tryptophan.
