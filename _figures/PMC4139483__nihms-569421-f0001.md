caption: A. Methylation signaling via H3K4me3. Trimethylation of H3K4 by the SET1
  family of KMTs leads to recognition of the methylated histone by PHD finger-containing
  proteins and downstream regulation of transcription and V(D)J recombination [-]
  (reviewed in [, , , ]). This methylation mark is removed by JARID1 family of demethylases
  (reviewed in [, , ]). B. Methylation signaling via p53K370 methylation. p53 is monomethylated
  at lysine 370 by Smyd2 []. Dimethylation by an unknown methyltransferase recruits
  53BP1 and regulates transcription []. These methyl marks can be removed by LSD1
  []. C. Methylation signaling via RelAK310me1. SETD6 catalyzes addition of one methyl
  group to lysine 310 of the NF-κB subunit RelA []. This mark is recognized by GLP
  and leads to tonic repression of target genes [, ]. GLP binding is inhibited by
  phosphorylation of an adjacent serine residue [, ]. D. Methylation signaling via
  MCM4K216me1. Monomethylation of the replication licensing factor MCM4 at lysine
  216 was identified in a proteomic screen for methylated proteins []. The writer,
  reader, eraser, and function of this mark are unknown; it provides an example of
  methylation for which the signaling pathway has not yet been established.
