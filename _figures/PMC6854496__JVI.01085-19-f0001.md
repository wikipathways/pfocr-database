caption: Schematic of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) activation by various RNAs during
  DNA virus infection. Both viral and host RNAs are recognized by RLRs and are capable
  of activating downstream signaling through interactions with MAVS. Activation of
  MAVS via the RLRs results in the production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines.
  Solid lines indicate direct effects or pathway connections. Dashed lines indicate
  indirect signaling events and are omitted here because of space. Red lines indicate
  inhibitory effects. DUSP11, dual specificity phosphatase 11; EBER, Epstein-Barr
  virus-encoded small RNA; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HSV-1, herpes simplex virus type
  1; IAV, influenza A virus; IKKε, IκB kinase-ε; IFN, interferon; IRF, IFN regulatory
  factor; KSHV, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral
  signaling protein; MDA5, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; MRPL18,
  mitochondrial ribosomal protein L18; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; NOP14, nucleolar
  protein 14; P, phosphate; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I; RNA5SP141, 5S ribosomal
  pseudogene 141 RNA; RNAPIII, RNA polymerase III; TBK-1, TANK-binding kinase 1; TST,
  thiosulfate sulfurtransferase; VA, viral associated RNA of adenovirus; vtRNA, vault
  RNA; VZV, varicella-zoster virus.
