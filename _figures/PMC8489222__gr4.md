caption: The Hippo pathway. Activation of Hippo signaling by as yet unindentified
  receptors initiates a kinase cascade with sequential phosphorylation of MST1/2 and
  LATS1/2, culminating in phosphorylation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) (or
  homologous TAZ) protein, which inducing its degradation. When the Hippo pathway
  is inactive, YAP or TAZ translocates into the nucleus, forms a complex with transcription
  enhancer activation domains (TEADs) and drives expression of proliferative genes.
  IP receptor activation by prostacyclin analogs and subsequent cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) signalling activates protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation and inhibition
  of YAP/TAZ. In contrast, TP receptor activation by U46619 activates Rho which inhibits
  MST1/2 and LATS1/2 kinases, preventing YAP/TAZ phosphorylation.
