caption: A model for the regulation of AJC disassembly in calcium-depleted cells.
  Depletion of extracellular calcium causes the disruption of homotypic E-cadherin
  interactions between neighbor cells (). GEF-H1 is activated by unknown signaling
  molecules either downstream of E-cadherin or by a putative E-cadherin–independent
  pathway. Activated GEF-H1 stimulates the exchange of ADP to ATP on Rho and thereby
  activates Rho. In its turn, Rho signals on its downstream kinase ROCK-II, resulting
  in assembly and contraction of apical acto-myosin rings. The contraction of acto-myosin
  rings provides the mechanical force for retraction of plasma membranes of adjacent
  cells resulting in the disassembly of AJC.
