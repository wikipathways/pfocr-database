caption: 'Figure 1. Model for bacteria detection by the Drosophila midgut. Ingested
  bacteria pass through the foregut (pharynx and esophagus) and reach the midgut that
  is made of four domains from anterior to posterior, the proventriculus, the ventriculus,
  the Copper cells region and posterior midgut. Bacteria are concentrated in the anterior
  domains but are able to release PGN fragments that can reach more posterior regions.
  It is unclear whether cell wall PGN or PGN released by bacteria are detected by
  the same mechanisms in the gut. One could imagine that one is detected by PGRP-LC
  while the other is a PGRP-LE ligand. The immune response in the proventriculus is
  fully PGRP-LC dependent and antagonized by PGRP-LE. It mainly consists of the production
  of antimicrobial peptides and is thought to regulate bacterial entry into the gut
  lumen. In the ventriculus, both PGRP-LE and –LC are required for IMD pathway activation.
  The more posterior domains that are devoid of bacteria are PGRP-LE dependent as
  far as IMD pathway activation is concerned. Activation of the NFkB pathway in these
  domains mainly leads to the production of IMD pathway negative regulators that by
  dampening the signaling protect the host from excessive immune response and prevent
  spreading of the immune response to remote tissues such as the fat body. This is
  a simplified model as AMP and INR are produced in all domains but at different levels.
  Some unanswered questions remain: (1) How does PGN reach or activate intracellular
  PGRP-LE? (2) How does PGRP-LE antagonize IMD pathway? (3) Why are both PGRP-LC and
  –LE required to activate IMD signaling in the ventriculus? (4) Why are AMPs mainly
  produced in anterior domains and INR in posterior domains? Does PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE
  activation lead to same transcriptional output?'
