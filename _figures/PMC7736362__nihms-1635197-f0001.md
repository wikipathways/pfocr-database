caption: 'Metabolic map of native and heterologous acetyl-CoA biosynthetic pathways
  in S. cerevisiae. Naturally, cytosolic acetyl-CoA is derived from the pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (Pdh) bypass consisting of pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase
  (Ald, purple), and acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs, pink); ethanol is also derived from
  an intermediate in this bypass (grayed box). Other native metabolic pathways include
  threonine aldolase (Gly, dark orange) and the mitochondrial shuttle system consisting
  of a CoA-transferase (Ach1, light orange). Heterologous tested pathways for the
  synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA include the following: phosphoketolase (Pk, tan),
  phosphotransacetylase (Pta, yellow), pyruvate oxidase (Po, dark green), pyruvate-formate
  lyase (Pfl, dark blue), acetylating aldehyde dehydrogenase (A-Ald, light green),
  pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdhcyto, brown), citrate lyase (Acl, light pink), citrate
  synthase (Cit, light blue), and carnitine acetyl-CoA transferase (Cat, gray). Non-native
  metabolites (acetyl-P and carnitine) and pathway (xylose catabolism) are indicated
  in red.'
