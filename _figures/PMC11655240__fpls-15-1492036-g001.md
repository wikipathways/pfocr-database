caption: The biosynthetic pathway of MT in plants. Arrows with a solid line represent
  MT biosynthetic pathways, while the one with a dotted line represents speculative
  or potential steps. TDC, tryptophan decarboxylase; TPH, tryptophan hydroxylase;
  T5H, tryptamine 5-hydroxylase; SNAT, serotonin-N-acetyltransferase; ASMT, N-acetylserotonin
  methyltransferase; AADC, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase; COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase
