caption: 'The wt TP53 LUAD females are enriched in antigen processing and presentation
  pathways with links to longevity. Numerous immune signature genes that were identified
  to be most highly differentially expressed in wt TP53 LUAD in females, compared
  to their counterpart males, occur in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) antigen processing and presentation pathways as depicted (A). Note in this
  pathway diagram, Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II DR Beta 1 (HLA-DRB1)
  is referred to as Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II (MHCII). Pathway genes
  with a positive log fold change (logFC) in females are outlined in red, while those
  with a negative logFC would be shaded blue (i.e., those more highly expressed in
  males). Grey outline indicates a logFC close to zero (i.e., similar expression levels
  between females and males). Genes with significant differential expression (p-value
  < 0.05) are indicated with a red asterisk. (B) Survival analyses for LUAD patients
  stratified by TP53 mutation status (wt or mutant) and the relative expression levels
  of the three gene signature: Sushi Domain Containing 3 (SUSD3), Major Histocompatibility
  Complex Class II DR Beta 1 (HLA-DRB1), and Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF). The numbers
  of males and females corresponding to each cohort, stratified for high or low expression
  of the respective genes, in either a wt or mutant TP53 context are tabulated below
  each plot. The ‘p’ is the p-value for the log-rank test of differences in survival
  time (significant p-value < 0.05).'
