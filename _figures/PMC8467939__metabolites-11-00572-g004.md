caption: 'Glutamine-driven mSLP as a major source of ATP synthesis in cancer cells
  and inhibition by the therapeutic IDH1(R132H) mutation. ATP synthesis through mSLP
  at the succinate-CoA ligase reaction (SUCL) in the glutaminolysis pathway (red)
  can compensate for inefficient ATP synthesis through OxPhos in tumor cells with
  mitochondrial abnormalities []. mSLP can also compensate for inefficient ATP synthesis
  through glycolysis in cancer cells that express the cytoplasmic PKM2 isoform, which
  produces less ATP than the PKM1 isoform []. These bioenergetic compensations will
  hold the ΔG’ATP hydrolysis at −56 kJ/mole, thus maintaining cancer cell viability
  in either the presence or the absence or oxygen. Oxygen consumption in cancer cells
  is used more for production of ROS, which are carcinogenic and mutagenic, than for
  ATP synthesis. Moreover, mSLP will maintain the forward operation of the adenine
  nucleotide translocase thus preventing depletion of cytosolic ATP reserves from
  the reverse operation of the F0-F1 ATP synthase [,]. Release of succinate to the
  cytoplasm can help stabilize Hif-1α, thus linking lactic acid fermentation through
  glycolysis to glutamine fermentation through glutaminolysis. Ketogenic metabolic
  therapy (KMT) will reduce availability of glucose to the glycolytic and the PPP
  pathways while diverting CoA from succinate to acetoacetate under the metabolism
  of ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) thus indirectly reducing ATP
  synthesis through the SUCL reaction. The therapeutic IDH1 mutation will further
  reduce ATP synthesis through mSLP by increasing synthesis of 2-hydroxyglutarate
  (2HG) from α-ketoglutarate and thus reduce the succinyl CoA substrate for the SUCL
  reaction [,]. Besides its potential effect in reducing glutaminolysis, 2-hydroxyglutarate
  can also target multiple HIF1α-responsive genes and enzymes in the glycolysis pathway
  thus limiting synthesis of metabolites and one-carbon metabolism needed for rapid
  tumor growth [,,,]. The down regulation of Hif1-α-regulated lactate dehydrogenase
  A (LDHA), through the action of both KMT and the IDH1 mutation, would reduce extracellular
  lactate levels thus reducing microenvironment inflammation and tumor cell invasion.
  The simultaneous restriction of glucose and glutamine, while elevating circulating
  ketone bodies, will stress the majority of signaling pathways necessary for maintaining
  tumor cell viability [,]. See text for additional details. KMT = ketogenic metabolic
