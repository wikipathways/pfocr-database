caption: 'The potential mechanism pathway of SIRT3 rs28365927 to increase the risk
  of NAFLD. Sirtuin3 rs28365927 may leads to the production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) by decreasing the activity of MRC, inactivating the ERK-CREB pathway and reducing
  the activity of MTP/LCAD/SOD2, and the production of ROS leads to the death of liver
  cells, which in turn leads to an increase in serum ALT levels [, –, –]. Abbreviations:
  SIRT3, Sirtuin3; MRC,mitochondrial respiratory chain; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  ERK,extracellular signal regulated kinase; CREB,the cAMP response element binding
  protein; Bnip3,BCL2 interacting protein 3; MTP,mitochondrial trifunctional protein;
  LCAD,long chain acyl coa dehydrogenase; SOD2,superoxide dismutase 2; NAFLD,Non-alcoholic
  fatty liver disease'
