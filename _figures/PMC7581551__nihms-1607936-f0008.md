caption: a, Folate and monapterin pathway are shown. b, Genetic complementation of
  folX and folM. Note that the production of colipterins is abolished in ΔfolX and
  ΔfolM strains. While the colipterins were not detected in both ΔfolX and ΔfolM carrying
  pBAD empty vector, complementation of folX and folM in pBAD into ΔfolX and ΔfolM
  strains, respectively, resulted in the recovery of major colipterins 3 and 4 production.
  24 h E. coli cultures were analyzed by high-resolution ESI-QTOF-LC-MS using Phenomenex
  Kinetex C18 (100Å) 5 μm (250 × 4.6 mm) column with a gradient from 10%−100% aqueous
  acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 30 min and with a 0.7 ml min−1 flow rate.
  Data are mean ± s.d. from three biological replicates (n = 3); nd, not detected.
