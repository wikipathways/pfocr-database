caption: d-2HG formation and degradation in yeast. A metabolic network, including
  the d-2HG formation and degradation reactions identified in this study, is represented.
  We showed here that yeast produces the d enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate, and we
  identified Dld3 as the major d-2HG-degrading enzyme in S. cerevisiae. Unlike in
  other organisms, d-2HG is degraded via a transhydrogenase reaction in yeast in which
  Dld3 oxidizes d-2HG to α-ketoglutarate in the first half-reaction and reduces pyruvate
  to d-lactate in the second half-reaction. d-2HG is produced by the S. cerevisiae
  phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases Ser3 and Ser33, which catalyze the conversion of
  α-ketoglutarate to d-2HG in addition to their known activity in the serine biosynthesis
  pathway. Although we found that Dld2 acts as a d-2HG dehydrogenase in vitro, deletion
  mutants of this gene displayed only a moderate increase in intracellular d-2HG levels
  if any, which, together with the subcellular localization information available
  for Dld2 (mitochondrial) and Dld3, Ser3, and Ser33 (cytosolic), indicates that d-2HG
  is mainly produced and degraded in the cytosol of yeast cells. The newly identified
  reactions seem to couple d-2HG degradation to the shuttling of reducing equivalents
  from cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial respiratory chain via the d-lactate dehydrogenase
  Dld1. DLD3 expression is induced together with CIT2, ACO1, IDH1, and IDH2 by the
  retrograde transcription factors Rtg1 and Rtg3 under conditions of mitochondrial
  dysfunction to preserve intracellular α-ketoglutarate pools. Idh1 and Idh2, but
  also cytosolic Idp2, may be additional sources of d-2HG formation.
