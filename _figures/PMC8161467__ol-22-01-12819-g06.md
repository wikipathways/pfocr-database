caption: Molecular mechanisms involved in chiMDM4, chiMDM2 and trametinib-mediated
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. ChiMDM4 and chiMDM2 reactivates p53, which decreases
  phosphorylated RB levels. The MEK inhibitor, trametinib, inhibits the downstream
  signaling pathway of mutant KRAS. RB phosphorylation is also reduced by ERK inhibition.
  As a result, E2F1 is inhibited by both pathways. Simultaneously, activated p53 induces
  pro-apoptotic proteins, and inhibition of ERK by trametinib promotes the same apoptosis
  pathway. chiMDM, DNA-chimera small interfering RNA against MDM; RB, retinoblastoma;
  MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; MDM2/4, murine double minute homolog 2/4.
