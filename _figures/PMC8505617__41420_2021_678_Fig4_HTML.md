caption: 'NF-κB consists of five subunits, RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50 (p105 precursor),
  and p52 (p100 precursor). In the canonical pathway: followed by exposure to an inducing
  stimulus, IκB is phosphorylated by activated IKKβ. The phosphorylated IκB then undergoes
  ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation along with NF-κB nuclear localization.
  In the non-canonical pathway: IκB kinase is phosphorylated by NF-κB-inducing kinase
  following receptor ligation. Activated IKKα induces p100 phosphorylation, which
  undergoes partial proteolysis to p52 and translocates to the nucleus.'
