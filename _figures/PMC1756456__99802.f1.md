caption: Internal anal sphincter (IAS) smooth muscle cell contraction is dependent
  on an increase in cellular calcium (Ca2+). This can be produced by direct influx
  of calcium through membrane Ca2+ channels or by stimulation of α1 adrenoceptors.
  The latter pathway results in release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum mediated
  via inositol-1'4'5'- triphosphate (IP3). Relaxation is induced by antagonising membrane
  Ca2+ channels or α1 adrenoceptors. Stimulation of β2 adrenoceptors results in a
  return of Ca2+ to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, mediated through cyclic adenine-3'5'-monophosphate
  (cAMP). Stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) containing non-adrenergic non-cholinergic
  (NANC) enteric neurones induces a cyclic guanosine-3'5'-monophosphate (cGMP) mediated
  decrease in cellular Ca2+. Muscarinic nerve stimulation, through release of acetylcholine
  (Ach), promotes the synthesis of NO.
