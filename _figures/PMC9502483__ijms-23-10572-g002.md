caption: A representative scheme demonstrates astrocytes’ interaction with the BBB
  and the neuroinflammation effect mediated by astrocyte activation on the BBB function.
  In AD, reduced expression of astrocytic SCARB1 and LRP1 would decrease the clearance
  of Aβ. Reactive astrocytes produce a wide range of cytokines and other inflammatory
  markers such as ROS, RAGE, COX, and MMP9 due to NLRP3 inflammasomes and NF-κB pathways
  activation. In addition, TLR4 and TLR6 activation through binding to CD36 would
  increase proinflammatory cytokines secretion leading to neuroinflammation and BBB
  dysfunction. In AD, the expression of endothelium RAGE and LRP1 are upregulated
  and downregulated, respectively, which lead to reduced LRP1-mediated clearance of
  Aβ, and increased RAGE-mediated Aβ influx into the brain, which would further increase
  the vicious cycle of brain Aβ accumulation, astrocytes activation, and BBB dysfunction.
  Astrocytes, and microglia, could also be activated via TLRs. TLRs are pattern recognition
  receptors (PRR) that recognize and bind substrates and activate the immune response
  []. TLR could be expressed on the cell surface as TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 10 or intracellular
  as TLR 3, 7, 8, and 9, and their expression varies among immune cells []. In the
  immune cells of human AD brains, TLR mRNA is overexpressed except for TLR2, which
  is not changed []. Aβ is a substrate for TLR; upon binding, it stimulates its overexpression
  []. Recent research showed that while Aβ42 did not affect the expression of TLR3,
  it increased its reactivity in cultured microglial cells []. TLR4 antagonists could
  reduce neuroinflammation in AD, yet they might interfere with Aβ clearance by lowering
  the microglial phagocytotic ability of Aβ. In contrast, TLR4 agonists might have
  a beneficial role in Aβ clearance but not in reducing neuroinflammation []. Other
  researchers reported that the deletion of TLR2 in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic mice
  caused cognitive impairment, and increased anxiety, white matter damage, and brain
  atrophy in an Aβ-independent pathway [], which collectively highlights the controversy
  regarding the role of TLR in AD [].
