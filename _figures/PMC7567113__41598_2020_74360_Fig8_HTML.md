caption: The role of BNip1-mediated apoptosis in photoreceptors. (A) The current model
  for molecular mechanism of BNip1-dependent apoptosis. In a monomer state, BNip1
  proapoptotic activity is inhibited by intra-moleculer interaction between N-terminal
  coiled-coil domain and BH3 domain. After the vesicular fusion on ER membrane, BNip1
  interacts with other components of the syntaxin-18 complex (Syntaxin18, Use1, Sec22b)
  through their SNARE domain and forms cis-SNARE complex, in which BNip1 BH3 domain
  is activated to interact with anti-apoptotic Bcl2, leading to the activation of
  Bax-dependent apoptosis. However, syntaxin-18 cis-SNARE complex is normally disassembled
  by SNAP and NSF, preventing BNip1 proapoptotic activity. In zebrafish β-snap1 mutants,
  syntaxin-18 cis-SNARE complex is abnormally accumulated on ER membrane, which subsequently
  allows BNip1 to interact with Bcl2. (B) A model for physiological significance of
  BNip1-mediated apoptosis in photoreceptor differentiation and survival. When intracellular
  vesicular transport is arrested, synthesized proteins accumulate in the ER, subsequently
  triggering the ER stress response (Right panel). On the other hand, when intracellular
  vesicular transport is abnormally activated, vesicular fusion events increase on
  target membranes along the secretory pathway. Such excessive fusion events may trap
  SNAP molecules, which reduces the relative contribution of SNAP to vesicular fusion
  on the ER membrane. In this case, the syntaxin-18 cis-SNARE complex accumulates
  and the BNip1-dependent apoptotic pathway is activated (Left panel). Blockade of
  ciliary transport functions of Ift88 or Kib3b inhibits BNip1-dependent apoptosis,
  supporting this model. In this model, BNip1 may cooperate with the ER stress response
  to maintain appropriate levels of vesicular transport in photoreceptors.
