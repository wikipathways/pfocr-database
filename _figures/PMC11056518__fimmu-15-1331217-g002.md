caption: Timeline of critical discoveries related to the IL-23 pathway. Prior to the
  discovery of IL-23, the accepted paradigm proposed to divide CD4+ Th cells into
  2 subsets (IFN-γ–producing Th1 cells and IL-4–producing Th2 cells) to explain the
  tendency of T cells to diverge into those that drive either a cellular or humoral
  immune response (29). However, this binary hypothesis did not explain the full spectrum
  of immune responses. IFN-γ–producing Th1 cells and IL-4–producing Th2 cells are
  dependent on STAT1 and STAT6, respectively, which did not adequately explain the
  regulation of STAT3-dependent CD4+ T cells in autoimmunity and infection. In addition,
  neutrophil recruitment and activation are major hallmarks of inflammation, and Th1
  and Th2 cells do not promote significant neutrophil-mediated tissue injury. Following
  its discovery (30), IL-23 was shown to be essential for development of experimental
  autoimmune encephalomyelitis and was implicated in the growth, expansion, and survival
  of a subset of pathogenic T lymphocytes characterized by the production of IL-17A,
  IL-17F, IL-6, and TNF that is distinct from Th1 and Th2 cells, now known as Th17
  cells (31, 32). TGF-β and IL-6 were later shown to be required to facilitate differentiation
  of naive T cells into Th17 cells (33–35), and the IL-23 signaling pathway was then
  linked to IMIDs by GWAS that identified variants of the IL23R gene that are associated
  with IBD and psoriatic disease susceptibility (36, 37). A little more than a decade
  later, the first phase 3 clinical trial results showing efficacy of an IL-23p19
  subunit inhibitor (guselkumab) in an IMID (PsO) were published, followed over the
  next several years by results in PsA, CD, and UC (3–7, 38). CD, Crohn’s disease;
