caption: Serine biosynthetic pathway. In vivo shRNA lethality screen and metabolomic
  profiling independently identified 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) to be
  essential in a subset of cancer cells that overexpress this enzyme. PHGDH plays
  a key role in serine biosynthesis, and cancer cells with high PHGDH activity might
  be addicted to this pathway for their viability. αKG, α-ketoglutarate; NADH, reduced
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; PSAT1, phosphoserine aminotransferase 1; PSPH,
  phosphoserine phosphatase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
