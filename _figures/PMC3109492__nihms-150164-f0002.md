caption: Activation of intestinal APCs by commensal microbes acquired by direct sampling
  of the luminal contents or via ingestion of transcytosed or invading microbes results
  in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-23, and IL-27. Along
  with TGF-β, IL-6 induces differentiation of a population of Foxp3 and RORγt ‘double-positive
  precursor’ cells, which express low amounts of both transcription factors. Sustained
  or increased TGF-β stimulation coupled with reduced IL-6 signaling in the presence
  of retinoic acid (RA) skews this population towards increased, stable expression
  of Foxp3 and down-regulation of RORγt and the Th17 program. Conversely, lower amounts
  of TGF-β signaling in the continued presence of IL-6 favor down-regulation of Foxp3
  and divergence towards RORγt-expressing Th17 cells. IL-27 can inhibit Th17 development
  while directly promoting STAT1-driven differentiation of Th1 effectors. IL-23 produced
  by TLR and/or NLR-activated APCs promotes late stages of pro-inflammatory Th17 effector
  functions. Intestinal Th1 cells might emerge from Th17 precursors, or develop independently
  of the Th17 pathway. Commensal antigen stimulation of IECs induces expression of
  TSLP and IL-25, which can inhibit Th17 maintenance by suppressing local expression
  of IL-23.
