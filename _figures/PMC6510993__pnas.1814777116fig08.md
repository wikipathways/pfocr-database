caption: Model of GQ folding within the actively extending telomerase complex. (A)
  At the completion of a telomere repeat, telomerase (with TERT depicted in gray and
  hTR in red) is annealed to the telomere DNA (blue). The schematically drawn anchor
  site (anchor symbol) is either engaged with the telomere DNA (Top pathway) or disengaged
  (Bottom pathway). Sequential repeat synthesis and primer realignment extrude telomere
  DNA from the active site to eventually allow for GQ formation. In the case where
  anchor-site contacts are maintained at this stage (Top, Middle and Right cartoons),
  the formation of a GQ may bias the enzyme complex toward another round of telomere
  repeat addition. If the anchor-site contacts are instead broken when GQ formation
  occurs (Bottom, Left and Middle cartoons), primer realignment results in product
  dissociation at this stage (Bottom, Right cartoon). (B) Extension of the mechanistic
  GQ model (A) illustrating the possibility and functional contribution of GQ formation
  in the presence of the GQ resolvase POT1–TPP1. A telomere-bound POT1–TPP1 unit engages
  the hTERT TEN domain via TPP1. Upon GQ formation, further POT1–TPP1 units are recruited
  to resolve the GQ in a 3′-to-5′ direction, resulting in fully protected telomere
  DNA. Concurrent telomere synthesis generates additional G-rich repeats for the process
  to continue in a four-repeat periodicity.
