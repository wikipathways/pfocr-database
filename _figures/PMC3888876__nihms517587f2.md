caption: A. Cryopyrinopathies (CAPS). Unlike wild-type NLRP3, mutated NLRP3 (which
  causes CAPS) is constitutively activated and thought to oligomerize and bind to
  adapter molecules apoptotic speck protein (ASC) and CARDINAL to form an active catalytic
  complex with two pro–caspase-1 molecules. Via autocatalysis, this complex generates
  active caspase-1, which cleaves inactive pro–interleukin(IL)-1β into its active
  form, IL-1β. B. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). (b.1). Wild-type pyrin can inhibit
  inflammasome activation by direct binding to caspase-1. Mutated pyrin cannot exert
  its inhibitory effect on the inflammasome, leading to unopposed inflammasome activation.
  (b.2) Wild-type pyrin can also interact directly with ASC forming the “pyrin inflammasome”,
  which is activated in the presence of FMF-causing mutations. C. Tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). TNFR1 molecules are transported
  from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi and then to the cell surface. Wild
  type TNFR1 complexes are bound to extracellular TNF, leading to NF-κB activation.
  Receptor cleavage from the cell surface abrogates receptor signaling and the soluble
  receptor can buffer soluble TNF. Mutated TNFR1 (which causes TRAPS) is misfolded
  and cannot be transported to the cell surface. Misfolded TNFR1 is sequestered in
  the ER, where it may lead to abnormal signaling through increased mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. D. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic
  fever syndrome (HIDS). Mevalonate kinase, a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis
  of sterol and non-sterol isoprenoids, catalyzes the conversion of mevalonate to
  mevalonate phosphate. In HIDS, activity of this enzyme is reduced, resulting in
  a decreased concentration of mevalonate phosphate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), leading to decreased activity of geranylgeranyltransferase
  and impaired geranylgeranylation of a number of proteins. Through an unknown mechanism,
  the reduced geranylgeranylation would lead to an increased pro-caspase-1 activation
  and consequent caspase-1 activation with resulting overproduction of IL-1 β. E.
  Deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA). Deficiency of IL-1Ra
  leads to unopposed IL-1α and IL-1β signaling. F. Chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis
  with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature syndrome (CANDLE). Proteasomes are an
  ATP dependent protein degradation system that targets intracellular polyubiquitinated
  proteins derived from self structures or foreign structures for proteolytic destruction.
  Patients who are homozygous for PSMB8 mutations show various assembly defects, with
  impaired proteolytic activity which is proposed to lead to an increase in, i.e polyubliquitylation
  of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) which might umulate in tissues from these
  patients and induce an increased inflammatory response. Serum cytokine analysis
  in CANDLE and gene expression profiling identified the IFN signaling pathway as
  the most differentially regulated cytokine pathway. G. CARD14 mediated psoriasis
  (CAMPS). Mutated CARD14 protein is mainly expressed in keratinocytes and leads to
  NF-κB activation and increased chemokine production. H. Deficiency of the interleukin-36
  receptor antagonist (DITRA). Deficiency of IL-36Ra in the keratinocyte leads to
  unopposed IL-36 signaling. I. Pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and
  acne (PAPA). Wild-type PSTPIP1, a regulatory molecule of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  binds to pyrin. Mutated PSTPIP1 is proposed to not dissociate from its binding to
  pyrin, leading to uninhibited inflammasome and “pyrin inflammasome” activities.ASC
