caption: HSPs prime immune responses responsible for eradication of premalignant cells.
  HSPs released from aberrant, membrane compromised cells engage dendritic cells locally
  or in the draining lymph nodes via the receptor CD91. Dendritic cells mature and
  cross-present HSP-chaperoned antigens to T cells. T cells are primed and NK cells
  are activated by these DCs. Activated effector cells eliminate aberrant, premalignant
  cells prior to formation of cancer.
