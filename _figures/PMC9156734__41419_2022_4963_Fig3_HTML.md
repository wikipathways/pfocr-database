caption: The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway plays an important role in DK, DED and keratitis.
  Many exogenous or endogenous molecules affect the development of corneal diseases
  through the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. Furthermore, many newly discovered drugs
  alleviate these corneal diseases by regulating the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.
  This figure uses different colours to indicate different corneal diseases and clarify
  the complex signalling network in CECs. In DK, hyperglycaemia induces insulin production,
  promotes the activation of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, and inhibits cell apoptosis.
  On the other hand, hyperglycaemia increases ROS levels. It inhibits IGF1 receptor,
  EGFR-ErbB2, TGF-β, GPCR, and other AKT upstream molecules, inducing cell apoptosis
  and inhibiting corneal wound healing. DED-induced hyperosmolarity inhibits the PI3K/AKT
  pathway and activates cell apoptosis and autophagy, leading to corneal inflammation.
  CsA and AST were also discovered reverse the changes caused by DED through the PI3K/AKT
  pathway. However, in noninfectious and infectious keratitis, overactivated AKT promotes
  inflammation. LPS, NM, and EPS-II increase the levels of inflammation-related proteins
  by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, as potential drugs, AA, C3G, and other
  molecules inhibit inflammation through the PI3K/AKT pathway. In particular, in viral
  keratitis, the PI3K/AKT pathway is also an important target for regulating viral
  (HSV-1) replication. GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; AA, asiatic acid; NM, Nitrogen
