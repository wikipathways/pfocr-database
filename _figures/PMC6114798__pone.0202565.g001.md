caption: Glucose is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate through the
  glycolysis pathway, indicated by the dashed line. Subsequently, under oxygen-rich
  conditions, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA through the pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) enzyme complex, whereupon acetyl-CoA enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
  as citrate. Under oxygen-limited conditions, pyruvate reacts to lactic acid through
  the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) pathway or to formic acid and acetyl-CoA by means
  of the pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) complex. In the absence of a functional TCA
  cycle at oxygen limitations, acetyl-CoA is transformed to acetic acid or ethanol.
