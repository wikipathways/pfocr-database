caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in ferroptosis. After entering, cystine via
  system XC− antiporter GPX4 works as an antioxidant and reduces intracellular ROS.
  However, HSPA5 enhances GPX4 antioxidant activity by stabilizing this enzyme. HSP90
  inhibits this antioxidant and subsequently increases ROS. On the one hand, ER enhances
  GPX4 via AFT4, facilitating HSPA5 expression. On the other hand, it facilitates
  PLOOH by releasing ACSL4. Mitochondria increases ROS levels via different cycles,
  including the Fenton reaction and TCA. Iron accumulation, the product of ferritinophagy
  or degradation of SLC40A1, provides an ingredient for the Fenton reaction. Ferritinophagy
  is also enhanced by autophagy receptors, NCO4, or SQSTM1. Lipid peroxidation results
  in ferroptosis and pore formation, which NUPR1 can inhibit. Abbreviations: SLC32A,
