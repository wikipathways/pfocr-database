caption: Schematic of Norrin deficiency causes deafness of ND patients through inactivating
  Wnt signal pathway. (A) When normal Norrin is existence, Norrin binds to the receptor
  complex FZD4/LRP5/TSPAN12 and Wnt signal pathway is activated, then transcription
  of the target genes turns on, thus maintaining the normal HCs and producing normal
  vascular system of the stria vascularum and hearing. (B) When Norrin is deficiency
  or mutation, which leads to destruction of Norrin/FZD4/LRP5/TSP12 complex and the
  failure of activation of Wnt pathway, which makes the key factors (marked with yellow
  and orange colors) of HCs be suppressed and HCs’ loss. At the same time, it induces
  the abnormal vascular system of the stria vascularum and then the lesions of the
  inner ear directly. And abnormal vascular system of the stria vascularum also can
  cause EH in some cases, then leads to EH related hearing loss. At last, all these
  three ways developed profound hearing loss.
