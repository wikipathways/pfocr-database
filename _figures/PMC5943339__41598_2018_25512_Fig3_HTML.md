caption: 'Top networks of differentially expressed genes in PTvs.N as identified by
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis show strong association to cancer and connective tissue
  disorders. For network analyses a threshold of log2FC > |1.5| with a p-value < 0.0001
  (corresponding to a FDR of 0.003) was used, giving an overview of involved genes
  within the networks and their differential expression. Node colour indicates up-regulated
  (red), down-regulated (green) or not significantly changed according to threshold
  (grey) genes. Lines and arrows between nodes represent direct (solid lines) and
  indirect (dashed lines) interactions between molecules. All edges are supported
  by at least one reference from the literature or from canonical information stored
  in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Node shapes represent functional classes of gene
  products: square → cytokine, triangle → kinase, rectangle → nuclear receptor, concentric
  circle → group or complex, vertical diamond → enzyme, horizontal diamond → peptidase,
  trapezium → transporter, vertical ellipse → transmembrane receptor horizontal ellipse → transcription
  regulator, circle → other. (A) Top 01 significant PTvs.N, network (Cellular Development,
  Infectious Disease, Cancer) contains 27 focus genes. (B) Top 02 significant PTvs.N
  network (Connective Tissue Disorders, Dermatological Diseases and Conditions, Cellular
  Assembly and Organization) contains 24 focus genes.'
