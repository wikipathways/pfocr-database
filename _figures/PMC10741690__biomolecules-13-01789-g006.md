caption: 'Mitochondrial dysfunction hypothesis of PD pathogenesis. Inhibition of mitochondrial
  complex I provokes the disruption of mtETC with consequent ROS and RNS production.
  Then, these reactive species damage several cellular components such as lipids,
  proteins, and DNA, causing the entry of Bax from the cytosol into the OMM. Once
  in the OMM, Bax provokes the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, leading to
  the activation of the caspase signaling pathway and finally cell death via apoptosis.
  Arrow: activation or induction of the subsequent process'
