caption: Summary of the major signaling mechanisms targeted by paeoniflorin that affect
  apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The structure of the terpine glucoside,
  paenoniflorin, ([(1R,2S,3R,5R,6R,8S)-6-hydroxy-8-methyl-3-[(2S,3R,4S,5S,6R)-3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-yl]oxy-9,10-dioxatetracyclo[4.3.1.02,5.03,8]decan-2-yl]methyl
  benzoate ) is presented in the inserts. Paenoniflorin has been reported to exert
  antiapoptic effects by attenuating the actions of the Gq protein-coupled receptors
  like the adenosine 1 (AT1R) and their interactions with the epithelial growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) by inhibiting the Gq, MAPK and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB). The anti-inflammatory effects of Paeononiflorin are
  largely related to its ability to inhibit interleukin 6 (IL-6) and other cytokine
  mediated activation of the janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer, and activator of
  transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Paeononiflorin also opposes oxidative stress by
  enhancing the activity of the Kelch ECH associating protein 1 (Keap1)-Nrf 2 signaling
  pathway which enhances the transcription and expression of antioxidative stress
  enzymes.
