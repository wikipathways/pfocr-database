caption: Multiple factors regulate MMP activities. After exposure to certain environmental
  contaminants (e.g., PCB104 and HCB), the expression of MMPs (MMP3, 10, 2, and 9)
  is markedly enhanced. IL-37 upregulates the expression of MMPs via multiple signaling
  pathways. IL-2 and IL-27 were found to maintain the balance of IL-10 and IFN-γ,
  promoting MMP2 and MMP9 expression and then inducing cell invasion and proliferation.
  IL-34 binds to CSF1R, which activated the JAK/STAT6 pathway in an autocrine manner.
  Estrogen induces MMP9 expression via the OPN. CIC3 and STIR1 improve the activity
  of MMP9, while miR-33b inhibits it. AQP1 promotes the expression of MMP2 and 9 via
  the Wnt signaling pathway. The COX2/PGE2/pAKT axis, as well as the leptin/JAK2/STAT3
  axis, serves as a significant regulator in increasing MMP2 expression. Additionally,
  MMP2 is a target of FGA and LXA4. MMP7 is a downstream component in the EGFR-mediated
  signaling pathway. Iron markedly increases EMT and MMP2/9 activities in endometriosis.
