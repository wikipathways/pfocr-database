caption: 'The biosynthesis of raffinose family oligosaccharides in the galactose metabolism
  pathway. The first square show the results of comparison 1 (C1: S1 vs. S2) and second
  and third squares show comparison 2 (C2: S1 vs. S3) and comparison 3 (C3: S2 vs.
  S3) respectively. For differential compounds, boxes in red represent down-regulated
  genes in each comparison, boxes in green represent the up-regulated genes, and boxes
  in white represent no significant change'
