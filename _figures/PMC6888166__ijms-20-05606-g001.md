caption: 'Signal transduction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Under normal
  conditions, all three endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensors (i.e., protein kinase
  double-stranded RNA-dependent (PKR)-like ER Kinase (PERK), activating transcription
  factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)) are associated with binding
  immunoglobulin protein (BiP). When unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, BiP dissociates
  from PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 to bind with the unfolded proteins. As a result, the three
  molecular sensors are activated: (a) PERK forms a homo-dimer complex and phosphorylates
  eIF2α, which attenuates translation. This inhibits the incorporation of newly synthesized
  proteins into the ER. In parallel, the selective translation of the transcription
  factor ATF4 is carried out. (b) ATF6, which has dissociated from BiP, is transported
  into the Golgi apparatus and processed by the Golgi-resident endoproteases S1P and
  S2P. The resultant ATF6 cytosolic fragment acts as a transcription factor and activates
  the transcription of ER-resident molecular chaperones, which accelerate the folding
  of accumulated unfolded proteins. (c) Activated IRE1 homo-dimerizes and self-phosphorylates.
  This conformational change determines the nonconventional splicing of X-box binding
  protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA. The resultant XBP1 spliced isoform (XBP1s) acts as a transcription
  factor and induces the transcription of three groups of molecules. (i) ER-resident
  molecular chaperones. (ii) ERAD-related molecules, to remove unfolded proteins from
  ER. (iii) Lipid synthesis related molecules. IRE1 also shows regulated IRE1-dependent
  decay (RIDD) activity to decrease the translation of ER-resident proteins, after
  completing nonconventional splicing of the XBP1 mRNA. (d) If ER stress is too severe
  to be suppressed by the above-mentioned pathways, ATF4 acts as a transcription factor
  and induces the transcription of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous transcription
  factor (CHOP) and GADD33. The ATF4/CHOP heterodimer induces apoptosis to eliminate
  stressed cells. GADD33 negatively regulates the PERK pathway, by dephosphorylating
  eI2Fα, to delay the activation of ATF4/CHOP. The dashed line indicates the nuclear
  membrane.'
