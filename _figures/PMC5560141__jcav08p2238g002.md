caption: The EGFR signaling pathway involving CEMIP mediation. When EGF signals firstly
  attach HER2 receptor, heterodimerization and phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3 will
  be automatically processed leading to enablement of EGFR signaling pathway. The
  signal will head into two branches, descending activation and degradation where
  over-expressed CEMIP acts as connected junction. The light purple color represents
  CEMIP and its simple protein structure with specific binding site, wherein survival
  signal Src targeted 60AA near N-terminal, and NRG1 bond to N-terminal. Src branch
  towards Semaphorin-3A-meidated survive and NRG1 lead to proliferation through activation
  of MEK1. Plexin A2 bond to G8 domain of C-terminal initiating suppression of apoptosis.
  The dashed arrows describe the EGF signaling routine, so do the curved arrows. Thick
  line from Plexin A2 to Semaphorin 3A means it cuts off the delivery of apoptotic
  signal to Semaphorin 3A. The participation of over-expressed CEMIP also prevent
  EGF signals from consumption of lysosomal enzyme (LAMP2).
