caption: Bioinformatics analysis of sevoflurane altered lncRNA-related pathways based
  on the dysregulated lncRNA co-expressed dysregulated mRNAs using ingenuity pathway
  analysis (IPA) software. The figure displays how each of the sevoflurane-dysregulated
  mRNAs, which are highly correlated with their corresponding co-expressed dysregulated
  lncRNAs, are involved in top disease and function (A), as well as apoptosis and
  necrosis networks (B). Each symbol represents one individual gene. Solid and dotted
  lines show a direct and indirect connection between genes. Green symbols indicate
  downregulation and red indicate upregulation following sevoflurane exposure. The
  abbreviations of the genes were defined in .
