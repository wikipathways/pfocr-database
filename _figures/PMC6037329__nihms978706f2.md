caption: Lysosome-derived free cholesterol (FC) can be transported to the plasma membrane,
  effluxed via ABCA1 and ABCG1 to HDL, or converted to cholesterol ester (CE) or enter
  the bile acid synthesis pathway in the ER. CE can be incorporated into VLDL for
  secretion into the blood, or stored in the lipid droplets (LD). Neutral cholesterol
  ester hydrolases (CEH) hydrolyze CE in the lipid droplets and the resulting FC can
  re-enter the cellular FC pool. In addition, autophagy delivers CE from the lipid
  droplets to the lysosomes where lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) converts CE to FC. Excessive
  cholesterol accumulation disrupts intrahepatic cholesterol homeostasis, resulting
  in elevated FC content in the “cholesterol poor” intracellular organelles such as
  the mitochondria and the ER. In addition, FC accumulation in the lysosomes impairs
  lysosomal function, resulting in delayed autophagosome clearance. Increased bile
  acids also inhibit autophagy gene expression. Blocking intestine bile acid re-uptake
  such as by bile acid sequestrants can decrease hepatic bile acid signaling. As a
  result, induction of CYP7A1 causes increased ER cholesterol catabolism, relative
  ER cholesterol depletion and SREBP-2 activation, leading to induction of LDLR and
  HMGCR expression to replenish cellular cholesterol. Removal of bile acids and stimulation
  of cholesterol catabolism induce autophagic flux, which promotes acidic CE hydrolysis
  to help replenish cellular FC pool.

  description: Lysosome-derived free cholesterol (FC) can be transported to the plasma

    (CE) or enter the bile acid synthesis pathway in the ER. CE can be incorporated

    Neutral cholesterol ester hydrolases (CEH) hydrolyze CE in the lipid droplets

    delivers CE from the lipid droplets to the lysosomes where lysosomal acid lipase
