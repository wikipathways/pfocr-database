caption: (A) Schematic diagram illustrating the key metabolic pathways and diet targets.1)
  Ketone bodies enter neurons via the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) and are directly
  metabolized by mitochondria.2) Glucose levels are reduced during the ketogenic diet
  as ketone bodies become the major fuel in the brain. Reduction of glucose metabolism
  in BAD mutant mice, or inhibition of glycolysis using 2-deoxyglucose, results in
  seizure protection [, ].3) Ion pumps maintain ion homeostasis and consume intracellular
  ATP. Neuronal function is energetically demanding [], which allows for changes in
  metabolism to modulate neuronal function.4) KATP channels hyperpolarize neurons
  and may link changes in metabolism to neuronal excitability [, ]. Decreases in cytosolic
  ATP, possibly via increased pump consumption of ATP, lead to increased KATP channel
  activity [, ].5) Extracellular adenosine can signal through A1 receptors and G-proteins
  to activate hyperpolarizing conductances like the KATP channel [, ]. Release of
  adenine nucleotides through pannexin hemichannels or by exocytosis can modulate
  extracellular concentrations of adenosine.6) Antioxidant capacity can be increased
  by shifts of glucose metabolism into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This improves
  cellular handling of ROS and can act to protect neurons; such neuroprotection may
  be important for antiepileptogenesis [– 65].7) Gene expression can respond to changes
  in cellular metabolism, with downstream effects on excitability. 2-deoxyglucose
  inhibits glycolysis, which results in decreased in BDNF expression []. Other changes
  in gene expression are likely to occur during the ketogenic diet.(B-D) Hypotheses
  for how metabolic changes could result in reduced hyperexcitability.B. Reduced Glycolysis
  – reduced BDNF expression. Reduced glycolysis (for instance, by application of 2-deoxyglucose)
  leads to a decrease in cytosolic NADH, which in turn represses BDNF expression [].
  BDNF and its receptor, TrkB, have been implicated in epileptogenesis (ie. in the
  development of spontaneous seizures after status epilepticus) [, ].C. Increased
  adenosine – Increased KATP. In conditions of low glucose, extracellular adenosine
  levels may be elevated via release of adenosine or ATP from neurons through pannexin
  hemichannels []. Activation of adenosine A1 receptors could then increase KATP channel
  activity and reduce neuronal excitability.D. Metabolic switch – Increased KATP.
  A switch from glucose to ketone body metabolism reduces the activity of glycolysis
  []. The reduced glycolytic production of ATP, combined with pump consumption of
  ATP during neuronal activity, could lead to reduced ATP levels near the plasma membrane.
  This in turn would increase KATP channel activity and reduce the excitability of
  neurons. The metabolic switch can be induced either by increased availability of
  ketone bodies (supplied by the liver via blood vessels, when on the ketogenic diet)
  or by mutation of BAD (white outlines) []. Ketone bodies may also be produced from
  fatty acids by neighboring astrocytes [].
