caption: A schematic model of LH/hCG-mediated mTORC1 signaling in T-I cells. The results
  of the present study support the schematic model in which LH/hCG signal triggers
  cAMP production, leading to activation of PI3K to promote AKT phosphorylation. This
  leads to inactivation of TSC2 by phosphorylating the Thr1462 residue and consequently
  the activation of mTORC1 signaling. mTORC1 enhances the phosphorylation of 4EBP-1
  and S6K1, which activates the rpS6 and consequently increases the translational
  machinery. The cell cycle regulatory proteins CDK4, cyclin D3, and PCNA are up-regulated
  via increased translation. An increase in cell cycle regulatory proteins leads to
  theca cell proliferation.
