caption: The TRAIL signaling pathway. The TRAIL ligand binds to functional receptors
  DR4 and DR5 and non-signaling receptors OPG (not shown), DcR1 and DcR2. Binding
  of TRAIL ligand or receptor-specific agonistic antibodies to DR4 and DR5 induces
  trimerization of the receptors. The cytoplasmic part of the DR4 and DR5 receptors
  contain death domains (DD) that enable recruitment of Fas associated protein with
  death domain (FADD) and procaspase 8 (proCASP8), enabling cleavage and activation
  of proCASP8 to its active form caspase 8 (CASP8). CASP8 activates downstream effector
  caspases both directly and, in some cells, through activation of the mitochondrial
  apoptosis pathway through BID cleavage. Once activated, effector caspases cleave
  downstream substrates and induce DNA fragmentation, ultimately leading to apoptosis.
