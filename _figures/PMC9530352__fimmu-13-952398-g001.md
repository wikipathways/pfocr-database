caption: Roles of carbohydrates in immune cells. Carbohydrates are involved in immune
  response against bacteria at the cellular level. Glycans contained in the glycocalyx
  of bacteria serve as pathogen-associated molecular patterns that bind with pattern
  recognition receptors (e.g., Toll-like receptor and mannose-binding lectin) and
  activate downstream immune response pathways, either promoting the expression of
  inflammatory genes or activating the complement cascade and eliminating pathogens.
  Bacteria can also be presented by antigen-presenting cells via the MHCII pathway,
  which requires NO to help degrade bacterial polysaccharide A into small molecules
  and present them to CD4+ T cells.
