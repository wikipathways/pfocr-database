caption: Graphical representation of Wnt pathway as described in the KEGG repository
  (). This pathway has a canonical Wnt/β-catenin cascade and two non-canonical pathways,
  named Wnt/Planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) pathway and Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, which conform
  the complete Wnt signaling pathway (A). Here, we represent the Wnt pathway in a
  gene expression microarray experiment in which colorectal cancer patients are compared
  with control subjects (). In the diagrams, nodes represent proteins and edges represent
  the type of interactions among them. (A) The results provided by PATHiWAYS in which
  the stimulus–response circuits with significantly decreased activity in cancer patients
  with respect to healthy control subjects are highlighted in blue. Solid edges indicate
  activations and dotted edges indicate inhibitions. (B) Representation, using the
  cytoscape program, of the individual gene expression activations (in red) or deactivations
  (in blue) when comparing the cancer samples with respect to the normal control samples.
  Edges ended in an arrow indicate activations and edges ended in ‘T’ indicate inhibitions.
  Despite many genes in many circuits increase or decrease their activity (B), only
  a few circuits are really affected by these changes (A).
