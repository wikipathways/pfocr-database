caption: Schematic summary of the IL-1β–IL-1 receptor signaling cascades identified
  in decidualizing human ESCs. Inhibitors are indicated in red ovals, and specific
  phosphorylation sites are represented by green circles. The dominant inhibitory
  effect of IL-1β on Cx43 expression (and also on prolactin and VEGF secretion as
  shown in ) is mediated via the ERK-MAPK signaling pathway, with some contribution
  from p38 MAPK, as their selective inhibitors (PD and SB203580, respectively) and
  siRNAs reverse those effects. By contrast, pro-IL-1β auto-upregulation by IL-1β
  appears to be predominantly mediated via the JNK signaling pathway. Finally, NF-κB,
  a pathway commonly attributed to the mediation of IL-1β, and mTOR were not major
  regulators of the action of IL-1β in ESCs.
