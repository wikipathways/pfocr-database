caption: Schematic representation of metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis
  and degradation of the endogenous sphingolipid ceramide. The cellular ceramide (Cer)
  accumulation induced through the activation of de novo synthesis and sphingomyelin
  pathways as well as the catabolic pathway involved in ceramide degradation are shown.
  Moreover, the blockade of the ceramide degradation by using the specific inhibitors
  of the enzymes that catalyze the transformation of proapoptotic ceramide into its
  diverse metabolites, including ceramidase, sphingosine kinase, and GCS inhibitors,
  and whose inhibitory agents can induce the ceramide accumulation-induced apoptotic
  death in cancer cells are also indicated. D-e-MAPP, D-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol;
  DMS, N,N-dimethylsphingosine; GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; OE, N-oleoylethanolamine;
  PDMP, D,L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol; PPMP, 1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol.
