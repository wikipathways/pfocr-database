caption: E. coli and other Gammaproteobacteria utilize the PlsB pathway for the synthesis
  of phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is synthesized from the successive acylation
  of G3P by the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase PlsB and 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate
  acyltransferase PlsC in E. coli. Both PlsB and PlsC are integral membrane enzymes.
  Exogenous fatty acids are converted into acyl-CoA by the acyl-CoA synthetase (FadD)
  and metabolically compartmentalized from endogenously synthesized acyl-ACP. Exogenous
  fatty acid is used for phospholipid synthesis because both acyltransferases in E.
  coli use either acyl-ACP or acyl-CoA of the appropriate length as acyl donors. Acyl-CoA
  can also be broken down via β-oxidation to generate acetyl-CoA and energy. Exogenous
  fatty acid is also used by the 2-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine acyltransferase
  (Aas) to reacylate lysophospholipids generated by lipoprotein synthesis. This reacylation
  reaction proceeds through an acyl-ACP intermediate, but the acyl-ACP cannot dissociate
  from the Aas complex and is used only for the reacylation reaction. Exogenous fatty
  acids cannot rescue inhibition of endogenous fatty acid synthesis in E. coli because
  β-hydroxyacyl-ACP generated by FASII is required for the synthesis of essential
  lipopolysaccharides. A pathway to generate β-hydroxyacyl-ACP from exogenous fatty
  acids does not exist.
