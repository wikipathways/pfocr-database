caption: 'Mechanisms of p53 activation. (A) DNA damage results in p53 activation via
  engaging the DDR pathway. Following detection of single stranded or double stranded
  DNA breaks, the kinases ATM and ATR become activated. Both ATM and ATR phosphorylate
  p53 at Ser15. ATM also phosphorylates Chk2, which phosphorylates p53 at Ser20, while
  ATR phosphorylates Chk1. Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and Ser20 causes it to
  be released from its negative regulator, MDM2. Additionally, Chk2 and Chk1 both
  inhibit MDMX, which functions to enhance the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 and inhibit
  p53. With p53 now released from MDM2, it functions as a transcription factor resulting
  in the expression of various tumor suppressive genes. For example, Bax and NOXA
  are proapoptotic proteins, while p21 functions to inhibit cell cycle progression.
  p53 also plays a role in regulating its own activity by facilitating the expression
  of more MDM2, while p21 acts to inhibit further DDR signaling by blocking the activity
  of Chk1. (B) Cell cycle progression also leads to increased activity of p53. As
  cells prepare to enter the S phase of the cell cycle, the kinases CDK4 and CDK6
  become activated. CDK4/CDK6 phosphorylate the cell cycle inhibitor protein Rb, which
  causes it to dissociate from E2F. E2F is now free from inhibition and functions
  as a transcription factor resulting in the expression of genes that facilitate cell
  cycle progression. E2F also facilitates the expression of p53 as well as ARF, which
  functions as an MDM2 inhibitor—therefore engaging p53 signaling. E2F can also facilitate
  nuclear accumulation of p53 by blocking its nuclear export signal. Legend: Arrows
  represent activation pathways, hammers represent inhibition, faded hammers represent
  inhibitory pathways that are being repressed by the signal pathway. Abbreviations:
