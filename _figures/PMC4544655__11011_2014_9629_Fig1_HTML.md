caption: Gylcogen metabolism in astrocytes. a Schematic representation of glucose
  metabolism. Glucose enters cells trough glucose transporters (GLUT) and is phosphorylated
  by hexokinase (HK) to produce glucose-6-phosphate. Glucose 6-phosphate can be processed
  into different metabolic pathways. It can be metabolized through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) or through glycolysis giving rise to pyruvate production. Pyruvate
  can enter mitochodria where it is metabolized through the Krebs cycle and oxidative
  phosphorylation. Alternatively, pyruvate can be reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH) and be released in the extracellular space through monocarboxylate transporters
  (MCT). Glucose-6-phosphate can also be used to store glucosyl units as glycogen.
  As a first step glucose-6-phosphate is converted to UDP-glucose through the action
  of phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UDPGP). UDP-glucose
  is then incorporated into glycogen by glycogen synthase (GS). Protein targeting
  to glycogen (PTG) is a specific glycogen-binding G-subunit, which is responsible
  for the targeting of protein phosphatase 1 to glycogen. Through this action, PTG
  promotes GS dephosphorylation and activation therefore favouring glycogen synthesis.
  In case of energy needs, glycogen can be broken down by glycogen phosphorylase (GP)
  to produce glucose-1-phosphate that is converted back to glucose-6-phosphate through
  the action of PGM. Adapted from (Allaman ) with permission. b Differential modulation
  of glycogen metabolism in cultured astrocytes by noradrenaline (NA). Activation
  of cAMP-dependent intracellular signalling by NA results in a short term (seconds
  to minutes, in green) glycogenolysis and in a delayed (hours, in red) glycogen resynthesis.
  This long-term response requires induction of gene expression and is accompanied
  by stimulation of mRNA expression of protein targeting to glycogen (PTG), a member
  of the glycogen-targeting subunits of protein phosphatase 1, and by the activation
  of glycogen synthase (see text for details). Adapted from (Magistretti ) with permission
