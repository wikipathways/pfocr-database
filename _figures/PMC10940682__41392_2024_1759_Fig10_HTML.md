caption: Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor proteins (GPI-APs) play a role in several
  cellular signal transduction pathways. In this section, we describe several classical
  GPI-APs and their roles in cellular signal transduction. CD109 negatively regulates
  TGF‐β signalling, while it can activate the Jak-STAT3 pathway to drive tumour metastasis.
  CD14 can activate TLR4 to trigger signalling pathways, including INF, tnf-α and
  IL-6 signalling, to initiate the immune response. Folate binds to FOLR1 to activate
  MEK/ERK signalling and the Jak-STAT3 pathway. ART could trigger NAD + -induced cell
  death. uPAR binds to Upa to stimulate the association of EGFR and β1 integrin to
  activate MEK/ERK signalling. ER endoplasmic reticulum
