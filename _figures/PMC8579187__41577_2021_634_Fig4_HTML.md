caption: a | Joint pathways of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), complement system
  and kallikrein–kinin system (KKS) on the endothelium. Certain components of the
  complement system and the KKS bind to the same surface receptor, the globular head
  of C1q receptor (gC1qR). It can bind C1q or, in complex with cytokeratin 1 (CK1),
  it binds high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK) and plasma prekallikrein (PPK). C1
  inhibitor is a common inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, activated factor XII (FXIIa),
  mannose-binding lectin (MBL) serine proteases (MASPs), C1s and C1r. Plasma kallikrein
  cleaves HK, releasing bradykinin. In vitro it was also shown to cleave complement
  factor B (FB) and C3; however, this has not been confirmed in vivo. Renin cleaves
  both angiotensinogen into angiotensin I (Ang I) and C3 into C3a and C3b allowing
  formation of more C3bBb. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) degrades bradykinin
  to metabolites and also converts Ang I to Ang II. Red lines depict inhibition, green
  arrows indicate that autoactivation of a protein can occur, blue arrows indicate
  enzymatic activity (dashed if shown only in vitro) and black arrows point to cleavage
  products. b | Mechanisms of vascular permeability and leakage induced by the RAS,
  the KKS and the complement system. Vascular permeability via the RAS is induced
  by Ang II signalling via Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R). In the KKS, vasopermeability
  is associated with bradykinin and desArg9-bradykinin signalling via the receptors
  B2R and B1R, respectively, and in the complement system with C5a signalling via
  the C5a receptor (C5aR1) and deposition of C5b-9 within the cell membrane. c | Mechanisms
  of endothelial cell injury, thrombosis, vasopermeability/oedema and inflammation
  induced by the RAS, the KKS/contact system and the complement system during severe
  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. After binding to
  pulmonary epithelial cells via surface-expressed ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes endocytosis,
  thereby reducing the amount of ACE2 on cell surfaces. This creates an imbalance
  in the RAS with increased activation of the canonical pathway. ACE2 inactivates
  desArg9-bradykinin. Decreased levels of ACE2 therefore increase desArg9-bradykinin
  levels and signalling via B1R in the KKS, leading to inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 interacts
  with C1 inhibitor, the level of which was found to be reduced in bronchoalveolar
  lavage fluid from patients with COVID-19 (ref.). Downregulation of C1 inhibitor
  will allow activation of the classical and lectin pathways of the complement system,
  and the nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were shown to bind to MASP2
  and initiate the lectin pathway of the complement system. The KKS/contact system
  is also activated because C1 inhibitor inhibits activated factor XII (FXIIa). Furthermore,
  activated FXII cleaves C1r, activating the classical pathway of the complement system.
  Endothelial cells become injured through excess activation of the three pathways.
  Endothelial cell activation leads to increased vascular permeability (as shown in
  part b), resulting in pulmonary oedema. Ang II, C3a and C5a as well as the kinin
  effectors bradykinin and desArg9-bradykinin promote neutrophil recruitment and inflammation.
  Neutrophil proteases can further activate the KKS by cleavage of HK. As listed in
  Table , effectors of the KKS and FXII, effectors of the RAS canonical pathway and
  of the complement system induce thrombosis. uPAR, urokinase plasminogen activator
  receptor.
