caption: Contribution of a GDF-15 signaling pathway in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Lungs
  infected with SARS-CoV-2 lead to tissue damage, hypoxia, and endothelialitis. Tobacco
  smoke, ultrafine particles, and air pollutants act as a co-stimulant in the direct
  release of GDF15 in the lung epithelial cells. The virus enters the host cell via
  ACE2 on type II pneumocytes causing the recruitment of leucocytes, hence, elevated
  innate immune response. SARS-COV-2 also causes direct endothelialitis after the
  destruction of the alveolar epithelia. The transmigration of leucocytes causes a
  massive release of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha, IP-10, IL-1beta,
  IFN gamma, GM-CSF, and Notch pathway. The hippo pathway favors IL-17 differentiation
  and the Wnt pathway inhibits Treg suppressor function mediated by GDF15 resulting
  in overwhelming immune system activation. Together with the formation of the syncytium,
  hyperactivation of immune response commenced leading to cytokine storm, hypercoagulation
  and elevated neutrophils-lymphocytes ratio critical in severe outcomes in patients

  description: Contribution of a GDF-15 signaling pathway in COVID-19 pathogenesis.
    Lungs infected with SARS-CoV-2 lead to tissue damage, hypoxia, and endothelialitis.
