caption: a Changes of free energy for the formation of NH3 on Co–N–C; b NH3synthesis
  pathway on single Co sites in the form of steady-state Co1–N3.5 (A represents the
  active sites); c NH3 production on dynamic cyclic sites via chemical-looping pathway
  (x is in the range of 0 < x ≤ 1.5 and VN* stands for an anionic nitrogen vacancy;
  herein CoN6/C only represents the molar ratio of each element in the Co–N–C catalyst).
