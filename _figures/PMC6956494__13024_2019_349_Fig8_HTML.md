caption: Cartoon representing of αsyn-induced effect on SIRT3 and mitochondrial dysfunction.
  Consequences of decreased SIRT3 include decreased AMPK-CREB signaling, impairment
  in mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics, and increased acetylation of SIRT3
  substrates such as SOD2 all of which contribute to increased ROS production and
  neurodegeneration. Question mark indicates pathway not supported by data in this
  manuscript
