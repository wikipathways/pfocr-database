caption: L. japonica regulation of MAPK signaling. The MAPK signaling pathway plays
  a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Upon activation by external stimuli,
  this pathway influences key kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases
  1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1, 2, and 3 (JNK1/2/3), and p38 MAPK.
  These kinases, in turn, activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
  activated B cells (NF-κB). Bioactive compounds derived from L. japonica, such as
  luteolin, cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), and quercetin, effectively inhibit NF-κB activation.
  This inhibition leads to the upregulation of tight junction proteins, which enhances
  the integrity of the intestinal barrier, thereby reducing inflammation and alleviating
  IBD symptoms
