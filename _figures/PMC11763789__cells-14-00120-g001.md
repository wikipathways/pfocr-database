caption: The mechanism of action of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Guanosine triphosphate
  (GTP) is converted into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by soluble guanylyl
  cyclase (sGC) in response to nitric oxide (NO) signaling. cGMP activates protein
  kinase G (PKG), which regulates downstream processes such as calcium (Ca2+) handling
  and smooth muscle relaxation. PDE5 hydrolyzes cGMP into guanosine monophosphate
  (5′-GMP), thereby terminating the cGMP-mediated signaling pathway. This regulation
  maintains the balance of cyclic nucleotide signaling essential for vascular and
  reproductive physiology. Created in BioRender (https://BioRender.com/c37c727, accessed
