caption: 'The convergence of the fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid catabolism, and
  phospholipid synthesis pathways in E. coli. Fatty acids are synthesized by repeated
  cycles of elongation, dehydration, and reduction of acyl‐ACP thioesters that ultimately
  yield long‐chain fatty acyl‐ACP. The E. coli pathway splits into saturated and unsaturated
  branches at the 10‐carbon acyl‐ACP intermediate C10:1(2E) ACP. FabA reversibly isomerizes
  (C10:1(2E)) with the precursor of the unsaturated pathway (C10:1(3Z) ACP). These
  precursors are irreversibly committed to the saturated and unsaturated branches
  by FabI and FabB, respectively. Phospholipid synthesis enzymes PlsB and PlsC use
  long‐chain acyl‐ACP products of fatty acid synthesis and acyl‐CoA intermediates
  of fatty acid catabolism of appropriate length. PlsB initiates phospholipid synthesis
  by transferring acyl chains from preferred ACP or CoA substrates (16:0 or 18:1)
  to the sn‐1 position of glycerol‐3‐phosphate (G3P), producing lysophosphatidic acid
  (LPA). PlsC transfers acyl groups from its preferred ACP or CoA substrates (16:1
  or 18:1) to the sn‐2 position of LPA, generating phosphatidic acid (PA). The relative
  proportions of acyl chains at sn‐1 and sn‐2 positions are determined by the corresponding
  proportion of acyl thioester substrates in the PlsB and PlsC substrate pools. Note
  that the substrate preferences of PlsB and PlsC are not absolute: PlsB incorporates
  a small amount of 16:1 acyl chains at sn‐1 [28], while PlsC incorporates a small
  amount of 16:0 acyl chains at sn‐2. PA is further converted via phospholipid headgroup
  addition and modification reactions to produce membrane phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol
  (PG) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)'
