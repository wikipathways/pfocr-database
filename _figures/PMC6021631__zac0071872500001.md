caption: Folate biosynthesis pathway and mutations identified in TMP-SMX-adapted Nocardia
  strains. The first step in the pathway involves the conversion of GTP by GTP cyclohydrolase
  I (FolE) to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate, which is converted to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin
  pyrophosphate (DHPPP) by a series of reactions. Dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS or
  FolP), which is targeted by SMX, catalyzes the reaction of para-aminobenzoic acid
  with DHPPP to produce dihydropteroate. Dihydropteroate is converted to dihydrofolate
  (DHF), which is then reduced to tetrahydrofolate (THF) by dihydrofolate reductase
  (DHFR or FolA). TMP competes with DHF for DHFR binding. THF becomes methylenated
  and is used for 1-carbon metabolism. Thymidylate synthase (ThyA) can regenerate
  DHF from N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate during deoxy-dTMP synthesis. Enzymes
  in this pathway encoded by genes mutated during TMP-SMX adaptation are identified
  by a red star. Surprisingly, mutations within a FolP homolog (FolP2), previously
  characterized and annotated as being “nonfunctional,” are sufficient to confer TMP-SMX
  resistance.
