caption: In certain cell types such as epithelial and neuronal cells, BimEL and BimL
  are sequestered to the dynein motor complex through interaction with the dynein
  light chain DYNLL1. Bim also binds Beclin-1, thus preventing autophagy. Upon exposure
  to microtubule-disrupting agents such as paclitaxel, or stress-stimuli such as starvation
  or UV radiation that activate JNK, BimEL becomes phosphorylated at Ser65 and Thr112
  and BimL at Thr56, leading to their release from the microtubule and mitochondrial
  translocation where the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated. Simultaneously,
  Beclin-1 is released from Bim resulting in induction of autophagy. Beclin-1 also
  competes with Mcl-1 for the USP9X deubiquitinase resulting in enhanced Mcl-1 degradation,
  thereby tipping the Bim/Mcl-1 balance towards Bim-induced apoptosis. In addition,
  the p53- and BRCA1-regulated stress protein GADD45a promotes Bim dissociation from
  the microtubules. GADD45a also inhibits the function of the microtubule-severing
  protein EF-1α.
