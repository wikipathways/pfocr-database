caption: 'CD112/CD155 and CD226/TIGIT/CD112R/CD96 pathway: CD226, TIGIT, CD112R, and
  CD96 on T and NK cells bound with their ligands CD112 and CD155 on tumor cells with
  different affinity. Upon binding, residues in cytoplasmic tails of CD226, CD112R,
  TIGIT, and CD96 were phosphorylated and produced co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory
  signals. (reviewed elsewhere [])'
