caption: 'Signal Transduction Pathways of Co-inhibitory Immune Checkpoints. This figure
  illustrates the complex signaling pathways mediated by various co-inhibitory immune
  checkpoints on T cells and their interactions with the corresponding ligands on
  APCs and tumor cells. The immune checkpoints depicted include the following: PD-1
  interacts with PD-L1 and PD-L2, CTLA-4 binds to CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), LAG-3
  associates with Galectin 3 and MHC class II molecules, TIM-3 pairs with Galectin-9
  and CEACAM1, and BTLA engages HVEM; VISTA interacts with PSGL-1; B7-H3 (CD276) interacts
  with TREM-LT; and TIGIT binds to CD155 (PVR) and CD112 (PVRL2). Abbreviations: PD-1,
  Programmed Death-1; PD-L1, Programmed Death-Ligand 1; PD-L2, Programmed Death-Ligand
  2; CTLA-4, Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4; LAG-3, Lymphocyte-Activation
  Gene-3; TIM-3, T-cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin-domain containing-3; BTLA, B and
  T Lymphocyte Attenuator; HVEM, Herpesvirus Entry Mediator; VISTA, V-domain Ig Suppressor
  of T-cell Activation; PSGL-1, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1; TREM-LT, Triggering
