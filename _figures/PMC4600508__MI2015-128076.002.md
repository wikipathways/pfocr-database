caption: 'Schematic overview of the multiple signaling pathways to apoptosis, necroptosis
  and autophagy. TNF-α binding to TNFR causes the assembly of a membrane-proximal
  supramolecular complex including (but not limited to) TRADD, FADD, and RIPK1 (receptor
  interacting protein kinase 1). Recruitment and activation of caspase-8 play a crucial
  role in initiation of apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Active caspase-8 cleaves
  Bid, generating tBid, with together with Bax and Bak promote the mitochondria outer
  membrane permeabilization (MOMP) allowing the release of cytochrome c. Cleavage
  of both RIP1 and RIP3 by caspase-8 leads to apoptosis, whereas phosphorylation of
  RIP1 and RIP3 protein kinases causes their activation and in turn the recruitment
  of MLKL (mixed lineage kinase domain-like). MLKL is phosphorylated by RIP3 and initiated
  structural changes that led to its insertion in the plasma membrane and formation
  channels. MLKL channels increase Na+ influx, osmotic pressure, and membrane rupture,
  ending with cell death by necroptosis. Membrane rupture promotes the release of
  cellular contents and, in particular, various endogenous DAMPs. Various chemotherapeutical
  drugs, chemical and biological stressors, cause mitochondrial dysfunctions and consequently
  increase the level of ROS (reactive oxygen species, ROS) generation and collapse
  of electrochemical gradient, which compromise the ADP/ATP exchange transporter.
  High Ca2+ upload in the matrix favors the transient or irreversible opening or closure
  of the outer/inner mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex (MPTPC) that
  is well known to participate in the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT).
  This is accompanied by mitochondrial depolarization, loss of membrane potential
  (ΔΨm), and massive swelling due to influx of ions and water into the matrix. Depending
  on the extension of cell injury, the cells undergo apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy
  programs. Autophagy of damaged organelles constitutes a survival response that prevents
  cell death. VDAC: the voltage-dependent anion channel, also known as porin; DAMPs:
  damaged associated-molecular patterns; TNFα: tumor necrosis factor α; TNFR: tumor
  necrosis factor receptor; FADD: Fas-associated death domain protein; Z-VAD.fmk:
  Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone; LMP: lysosomal membrane permeabilization;
  PTPC: permeability transition pore complex; Smac: second mitochondria-derived activator
  of caspase.'
