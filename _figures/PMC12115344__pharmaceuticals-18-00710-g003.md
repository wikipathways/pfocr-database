caption: A diagrammatic representation of the cGAS-STING signaling axis involved in
  ALD. Alcohol and its metabolic byproducts promote the release of DAMPs, such as
  mitochondrial DNA, and PAMPs, such as LPS (known inducer of mitochondrial DNA release).
  These molecules are recognized by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in the cytosol.
  Upon activation, cGAS stimulates the adaptor protein STING, which subsequently activates
  TBK1 and IRF3. This signaling cascade culminates in the induction of type I IFNs
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines, both of which contribute to liver inflammation and
  injury. Notably, certain phytochemicals have been shown to inhibit this pathway,
  thereby attenuating inflammation and hepatic damage
