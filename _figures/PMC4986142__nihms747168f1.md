caption: Mechanisms of resistance to RAF inhibitors. Before exposure to RAF inhibitors,
  BRAFV600E-mutant tumors have hyperactivated ERK signaling. This results in negative-feedback
  suppression of upstream receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. In this state, expression
  of active RAS-GTP is low and BRAFV600E signals as a monomer, which is sensitive
  to RAF inhibitors. Upon treatment with vemurafenib, ERK-dependent negative feedback
  is rapidly downregulated, resulting in the restoration of receptor signaling, RAS
  activation, induction of RAF dimers, and activation of parallel signaling pathways,
  including the PI3K–AKT pathway. Activation of PI3K/AKT, which coregulates the expression
  of some downstream effectors of ERK transformation including D cyclins, results
  in diminished dependence of RAF signaling. This rapid adaptive response to RAF inhibition
  attenuates the antitumor effects of RAF inhibitors and thus may promote the selection
  of subclones harboring coalterations that confer higher levels of RAF inhibitor
  resistance. These molecular alterations include NRAS and KRAS mutations, loss of
  NF1 function, aberrantly spliced BRAF variants that lack the RAS binding domain,
  BRAF amplification, and mutations in MEK1 and MEK2, among others.

  description: Mechanisms of resistance to RAF inhibitors. Before exposure to RAF
    inhibitors, BRAFV600E-mutant tumors have hyperactivated ERK signaling. This results
    in negative-feedback suppression of upstream receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.
    In this state, expression of active RAS-GTP is low and BRAFV600E signals as a

    of parallel signaling pathways, including the PI3K–AKT pathway. Activation of
    PI3K/AKT, which coregulates the expression of some downstream effectors of ERK
    transformation including D cyclins, results in diminished dependence of RAF signaling.
    This rapid adaptive response to RAF inhibition attenuates the antitumor effects
    of RAF inhibitors and thus may promote the selection of subclones harboring coalterations
    that confer higher levels of RAF inhibitor resistance. These molecular alterations
