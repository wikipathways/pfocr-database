caption: Postsynaptic receptors for Aβ oligomers affect different signaling pathways.
  The scheme shows that the binding of Aβ oligomers to different postsynaptic receptors
  might trigger synaptotoxicity and consequent neuronal death by activating different
  signaling pathways, as indicated, only in the case of NL-1 (neuroligin-1) and the
  PrPc (cellular prion protein), the precise pathway is not known. p75 (p75 receptor
  of neurotrophin), α7-nAChR (α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor), NMDAR (N-Methyl-D-aspartate
  receptor), and mGluR (metabotropic glutamate receptors), the signaling pathway is
  already known. In the case of the α7-nAChR, recent studies from our laboratory also
  implicated the Wnt signaling pathway.
