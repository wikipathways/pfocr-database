caption: Signaling pathways regulating ferroptosis in prostate cancer. PKC represses
  Fe2+ uptake by promoting HSPB1 phosphorylation, thus decreasing lipid ROS production.
  DECR1 is negatively associated with PUFAs, but positively associated with the expression
  of GPX4, affecting ferroptosis through the ROS. CHAC1 increases the intracellular
  lipid peroxides levels by inhibiting the GPX4 levels. SREBP1/SCD1, which are promoted
  by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, contributes to the suppression of ROS, resulting in
  mitigating ferroptosis. SLC7A11, a cystine/glutamate antiporter that imports cystine
  into cells while exporting glutamate, decreases lipid ROS by enhancing GSH levels.
  SLC7A11 can be also upregulated by PANX2 that mediated by Nrf2, a major regulator
  of the antioxidant response. Mitochondrial dysregulation plays a critical role in
  promoting ferroptosis. Iron chelator inhibits ferroptosis by suppressing Fe2+, while
  erastin, RSL3, and buthionine sulfoximine induces ferroptosis by enhancing lipid
  ROS. ROS locates on the central position of multiple ferroptosis-related genes.
