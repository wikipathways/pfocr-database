caption: Regulatory mechanisms of NRF2. Under surveillance mode, microglia maintains
  low NRF2 protein levels by its inhibition by the E3 ligase adapter KEAP1. (A), two
  NRF2-motifs, ETGE and DLG, interact with a separate Kelch-repeat domain present
  in the KEAP1 homodimer. KEAP1 and NRF2 interaction is controlled by the redox status
  of at least three critical cysteine residues of KEAP1 (Cys151, Cys273, and Cys288).
  High levels of ROS/RNS alter these cysteine residues, enabling NRF2 activation.
  (B) NRF2 is controlled by signaling cascades that are also profoundly influenced
  by ROS/RNS concentration. For instance, GSK-3β phosphorylates NRF2 and activates
  a KEAP1-independent degradation pathway that is dependent of a different E3-ligase
  named β-TrCP. (C) In addition, NRF2 is modulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including
  acetylation, CpG island methylation of its promoter region, and miRNA generation.
  β-TrCP, β-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; GSK-3, glycogen
  synthase kinase-3; KEAP1, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1.
