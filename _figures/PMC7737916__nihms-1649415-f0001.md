caption: Metabolic fate of polyunsaturated fatty acids Free fatty acids are primarily
  metabolized through β-oxidation, Cyclooxygenase (COX), Lipoxygenase (LOX or LO),
  and CytochromeP450 (CYP450). A simplistic overview of the biological action of the
  resulting metabolites is shown in parenthesis.COX 1 and COX 2 metabolize PUFA to
  PGH2 which is the precursor to other inflammatory prostanoids and thromboxanes that
  regulate the immune system (PGD2), increase pain and inflammation (PGE2) and control
  platelet aggregation (PHI2 and TXA2). []5-LO metabolizes PUFA to 5-HpETE or 15-LO
  to 15-HpETE, both are precursors to inflammatory leukotrienes and cytotoxic leukotoxins.
  These metabolites are important in exacerbating asthma by acting as powerful bronchoconstrictors,
  and they can also sustain inflammatory reactions through chemotaxis of inflammatory
  mediators. LO metabolism of omega-3 fatty acids result in pro-resolving lipid mediators
  called Resolvins, Protectins and Maresins. []CYP450 metabolizes PUFA to anti-i nflammatory
  epoxy fatty acids (EpFAs), n-terminal hydroxylated n-HETE, ω−1 oxidation, or allylic
  hydroxylations. 20-HETE regulates blood pressure by acting as a potent vasoconstrictor
  in kidneys and preventing sodium reabsorption in nephrons [, ]. The biological significance
  of mid-chain hydoxylations is less understood; however, biological significance
  has been observed with 12-HETE in corneal inflammation and neovascularization [,
  ]. Formation of EpFA, particularly if induced, is primarily accomplished by CYP2C
  and CYP2J subfamily; however, other CYP enzymes can generate EETs []. The EpFA act
  as homeostatic regulators to other metabolites in this pathway by stabilizing mitochondria,
  reducing ROS, decreasing ER-stress [] and inflammation [], regulating the vascular
  endothelium [] and increasing bronchodilation []
