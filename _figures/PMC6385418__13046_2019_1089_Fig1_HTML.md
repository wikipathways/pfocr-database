caption: The homologous recombination (HR) repair deficiency represents an opportunity
  for a synthetic lethality approach through the use of PARP inhibitors (PARPi). The
  DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) enhance the cytotoxic effects of PARPi
  by increasing the PARP1 trapping at DNA. At the same time, the accumulation of DNA
  damage, as a consequence of cell’s inability to repair the DSBs, results in a high
  tumor mutational burden and tumor surface neoantigens load associated with increased
  infiltration of T lymphocyte into tumor microenvironment. These events trigger the
  compensatory upregulation of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway offering the possibility to use
  the immune checkpoint inhibitors in order to kill the cancer cells that elude the
  immune system. Thus, targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway with immune checkpoint inhibitors
  may rappresent an attractive approach for treament of the tumor with defects of
  HR repair
