caption: Mechanotransduction and pathways regulating cytoskeleton during metastasis.
  This illustration summarizes some of the mechanisms by which a stiff ECM or extracellular
  signaling alters cell fate through mechanotransducers. A stiffened matrix prompts
  cell tension and generates mechanical force, activating different mechanosensors.
  RhoA/ROCK is located in the center position among all these molecules in the pathways.
  RhoA is facilitated by numerous effector proteins. GPCR, via activation of cAMP
  and PKA, enhances the expression of RhoA. Integrins activate the RhoA directly by
  transducing the mechanical ECM force. TRP channels and Piezo 1/2 can sense the ECM
  force and lead to the release of Ca2+. Ca2+ influx stimulates RhoA or via PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  and mDia. Downstream of RhoA/ROCK lies the key regulators of cytoskeleton LIMK/cofilin.
  ROCK activates LIMK, which subsequently inhibits cofilin via phosphorylation. Cofilin
  facilitates actin filament severing and depolymerization; therefore, its inhibition
  results in elevated polymerized actin stability. LIMK also directly enhances actin
  polymerization and myosin contractility. This, in turn, initiates a paracrine signaling
  mechanism that causes increased production of ECM components in the tumor microenvironment.
  High expression of actin contractility and inhibition of the Hippo pathway activates
  YAP/TAZ function. YAP/TAZ accumulates in the nucleus and regulates gene transcription
  together with DNA‑binding transcription factors such as TEAD. ECM directly transduces
  the mechanical force to intermediate filaments and microtubules and assists in the
  formation of lamellipodia.
