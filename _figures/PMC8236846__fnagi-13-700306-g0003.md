caption: Concentration of metabolites related to the TCA cycle of the aged hippocampus.
  Box plots of metabolites involved in the TCA cycle show the concentration change
  between young adult and aged hippocampus under HC and EE condition. TCA cycle key
  metabolites, including acetyl-CoA, citrate, aconitate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate,
  fumarate, and malate were plot according to the metabolic pathway. *p < 0.05, **p
  < 0.01; unpaired t-test.
