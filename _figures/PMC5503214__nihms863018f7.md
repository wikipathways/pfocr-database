caption: '(A) Results summary: In Dgat1Int mice, greater amounts of TAG in the ER
  lumen, similar amounts of TAG in Golgi/SVs, a trend toward smaller CLDs, and a similar
  intestinal TAG secretion rate were found compared to WT mice. In Dgat2Int mice,
  similar amounts of TAG in the ER lumen, greater amounts of TAG in Golgi/SVs, an
  increased number of CLDs, and a higher intestinal TAG secretion rate were observed
  compared to WT mice. In Dgat1−/− mice, a trend towards less TAG in the ER lumen
  and Golgi/SVs and an increase in CLD size were found in enterocytes compared to
  WT mice. Dgat1−/− mice also secrete TAG from the intestine at a slower rate within
  smaller sized CMs compared to WT mice. Some of the CLD-associated proteins are present
  in all genotypes, whereas others, such as ApoAIV and Cideb, are unique to certain
  genotype(s) and may be contributing to the altered subcellular distribution of TAG
  observed in these models. (B) Proposed model: A proposed model of coordinated, non-redundant
  roles of Dgat1 and Dgat2 in CM synthesis was generated by combining the results
  of the current study with previous knowledge of the CM synthesis pathway. CM assembly
  in enterocytes requires two distinct pools of TAG within the lumen of the ER: ApoB-containing
  nascent CMs and ApoB-free LLDs. In this model, Dgat1 is proposed to preferentially
  synthesize TAG for incorporation into ApoB-free LLDs, which determines the availability
  of TAG for nascent CM expansion and thus the size of CMs. Dgat2 is proposed to preferentially
  synthesize TAG for incorporation into ApoB-containing nascent CMs, which likely
  regulates the rate of intestinal TAG secretion. In addition, TAG storage in CLDs
  and its subsequent catabolism provides substrates for re-synthesis of TAG at the
  ER membrane that may contribute to CM synthesis and secretion at later times. Based
  on the results from the current study, Dgat1 is proposed to restrict CLD growth
  in enterocytes by preferentially synthesizing TAG that is delivered into the ER
  lumen, thus limiting TAG storage in CLDs. Dgat2, on the other hand, is proposed
  to preferentially increase TAG storage in CLDs, which may provide fatty acids for
  re-synthesis of TAG at the ER membrane for incorporation into CMs at later time
  points. Differential associations of proteins with enterocyte CLDs in these models
  may serve to regulate the localization and activity of proteins involved in dietary
  fat absorption.'
