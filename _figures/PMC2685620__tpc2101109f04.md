caption: Effect of GLK1 and GLK2 Induction on the Chlorophyll Biosynthetic Pathway.Schematic
  of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway with steps with significant changes in gene
  transcript levels following GLK induction depicted with black arrows; the relative
  strength of induction is reflected in the thickness of the arrow. Nonsignificantly
  changed steps and pathways are depicted with gray arrows. Values represent the mean
  fold ratio (mFR) change in gene expression (induced relative to noninduced) following
  induction of GLK1 and GLK2. For clarity, only genes with significantly changed transcript
  levels are shown for each step. Significance threshold of P ≤ 0.05, n ≥ 3 biological
  replicates. ns, not significant. Circled numbers refer to enzymatic steps listed
  in Supplemental Table 6 online, which details the changes in all genes involved
  in this pathway. Steps inhibited by DP are also shown. The genes are HEMA1; GUN4;
  CHLH; CHLM, Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyl transferase; CRD1, Mg-protoporphyrin IX
  monomethyl ester cyclase; PORA/PORB/PORC, protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A/B/C;
  CAO; MgProtoME, magnesium protoporphyrin monomethyl ester; DVP, divinylprotochlorophyllide;
  and MVP, monovinylprotochlorophyllide.
