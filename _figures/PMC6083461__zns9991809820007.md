caption: Proposed model for RGS9–2 regulation of NMDAR function and synaptic signaling
  in D2-MSNs. Within MSNs, RGS9–2 inactivates Gi-coupled GPCR, which inhibits the
  production of cAMP, which in turn plays a key role in positive modulation of NMDAR
  function. The change in Ca2+ influx through NMDARs then affects the production of
  AEA, which retrogradely inhibits presynaptic neurotransmitter release.
