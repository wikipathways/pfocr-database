caption: Shows a working model that describes a pathway for viral RNA synthesis in
  MHV-A59-infected cells. The model proposes that the replicase-transcriptase complex
  forms initially and creates a negative-strand template. It is then converted to
  utilize the negative strand as a template for positive-strand synthesis and, finally,
  the complex is inactivated by the degradation of negative-strand templates. It is
  also proposed that proteolytic processing of the replicase polyproteins plays a
  role in regulation of this pathway. Also depicted are the putative defects of specific
  MHV-A59 ts mutants. It remains to be shown whether or not the group IV and VI mutants
  (Wü ts38, Alb ts17, Wü ts18, and Wü ts36) are defective in negative-strand RNA synthesis
  at the non-permissive temperature.
