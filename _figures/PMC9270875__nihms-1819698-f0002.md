caption: 'During infection, microbial byproducts are detected by neutrophils in the
  bone marrow, prompting granulopoiesis. Upon arriving to the site of infection, neutrophils
  engulf pathogens into the phagolysosome. Once engulfed, superoxide and other reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) are produced by the NADPH oxidase protein complex within the
  phagolysosome in a process termed the ‘oxidative burst’ []. NADPH, the substrate
  of NADPH oxidase, is produced by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase (6PGD) in the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  and possibly by other enzymes, including NADPH-dependent isoforms of isocitrate
  dehydrogenase and malic enzyme. Shunting of carbons into the PPP is thought to be
  the predominant source of cytosolic NADPH in these cells. When glucose is limiting,
  neutrophils can maintain ATP production and carbon flux through the PPP by breaking
  down glycogen []. Glutamine uptake has also been shown to promote NAPDH oxidase
  activity in neutrophils, but whether this effect involves glutamine-dependent NAPDH
  production has not been fully examined. To suppress pathogen dissemination, neutrophils
  also secrete neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), comprising granule proteins
  and DNA fragments. These NETs bind bacteria and degrade viral and bacterial proteins.
  Metabolically, similar to the ‘oxidative burst’, glycolysis and G6PD expression
  support NET formation []. Abbreviations: α-KG, α-ketoglutaric acid; GA3P, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; GLS, glutaminase; OAA, oxaloacetic acid; 3PG, 3-phosphoglyceric acid.'
