caption: Pathway for EBV reactivation-induced Ig production. B cells newly infected
  by EBV become latency 3 and express LMP1. LMP1 activates host cells (polyclonal
  B cell activation). LMP1 stimulates AID expression through NF-κB, which enables
  host cells to class-switch Ig. EBV reactivation induces plasma cell differentiation
  and Ig production. AID, activation-induced cytidine deaminase; EBV, Epstein–Barr
  virus; Ig, immunoglobulin; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B.
