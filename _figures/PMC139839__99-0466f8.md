caption: A Model for GCC Box–Mediated Stress Signal—Dependent Transcription by ERF
  Proteins in Arabidopsis.After reception of a stress signal by plants, ERF genes
  may be upregulated via an ethylene-dependent pathway or an ethylene-independent
  pathway. ERF genes such as ERF1 () are induced by ethylene and can interact with
  GCC box–containing stress response genes. The AtERFs are able to interact with the
  GCC box sequence in an ethylene-independent manner. AtERF1, AtERF2, or AtERF5 may
  activate a specific subset of GCC box–containing genes, whereas AtERF3 and AtERF4
  may repress the expression of these genes. These data suggest that the ERF proteins
  may act as factors responsive to extracellular signals and that they are involved
  in regulating a subset of GCC box–containing stress response genes.
