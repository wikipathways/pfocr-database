caption: Functions of cGAS-like receptors (cGLRs) in Drosophila immune responses.
  cGLR1 and cGLR2 are two cGLRs in Drosophila, cGLR1 can response to RNA/DNA virus,
  while cGLR2 is not definite. The details of DNA virus activating cGLRs are not clear.
  cGLR1 requires dsRNA to be activated and synthesize 3ʹ2ʹ-cGAMP as a second messenger.
  The ligand of cGLR2 is unknown, while it can trigger antiviral immunity through
  synthesizing 3ʹ2ʹ-cGAMP and 2ʹ3ʹ-cGAMP. Sting-dependent pathway is activated after
  combining the second messengers
