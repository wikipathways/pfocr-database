caption: TRPM1 role in visual pathways. In the retina, the photoreceptors are in synaptic
  contact with bipolar neurons. (a), which in turn contact ganglion neurons, in which
  axons merge to form the optic nerve. In the dark, the rods secrete glutamate into
  the synaptic cleft, which activates the mGluR6, a G-protein coupled receptor. In
  its activated state, mGluR6 hyperpolarizes the neuron. In that status, G-protein
  Goα-GTP is bound to TRPM1, resulting in inactivation of the channel. In the presence
  of light, rods release low glutamate, which inactivates mGluR6. As a consequence,
  the dephosphorylation of GTP into GDP allows Go to bind and subunits and the complex
  binds mGluR6, inactivating it and avoiding hyperpolarization. The release of Go
  activates TRPM1, which opens, allowing calcium entry and depolarizing the bipolar
  neuron triggering the electrochemical signaling. (b) TRPM3 and autophagy in clear
  cell carcinoma. TRPM3 activity increases cytosolic calcium, which binds Calmodulin
  (CaM). Ca-CaM binds CaMKK2 and this activated complex phosphorylates AMPK. Active
  AMPK through phosphorylation, in turn, phosphorylates ULK, which, in its phosphorylated
  form, can bind ATG13 and RB1CC1. This ULK-ATG13-RB1CC1 complex allows for the formation
  of autophagosomes and the binding of the autophagosomes with lysosomes. ULK is normally
  inactive through the phosphatase activity of MTOR. Thus, in normal conditions, this
  pathway is inactive. Created with BioRender.com.
