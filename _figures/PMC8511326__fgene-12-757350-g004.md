caption: Identification of the key protein clusters using string database and MCODE
  plugin (nodes >10, score >5) and functional analysis of identified 1-5 key protein
  clusters using ClueGo plugin. (A) Color coded network of protein cluster 1 and their
  connection. (B) Bubble plot of functional enrichment analysis showing proteins in
  cluster 1 participated in a structural constituent of keratin filament and intermediate
  filament cytoskeleton. (C) Color coded network of protein cluster 2 and their connection.
  (D) Bubble plot of functional enrichment analysis showing proteins in cluster 2
  participated in chemokine signaling pathway. (E) Color coded network of protein
  cluster 3 and their connection. (F) Bubble plot of functional enrichment analysis
  showing proteins in cluster 3 participated in myofibril assembly. (G) Color coded
  network of protein cluster 4 and their connection. (H) Bubble plot of functional
  enrichment analysis showing proteins in cluster 4 participated in glycogen metabolic
  process (I) Color coded network of protein cluster 5 and their connection. (J) Bubble
  plot of functional enrichment analysis showing proteins in cluster 5 participated
  in keratinocyte differentiation. The nodes in (A) (C) (E) (G) (I) indicate proteins.
  The edges represent protein interaction. The bubbles in (B) (D) (F) (H) (J) indicate
  GO term, the dots represent proteins, and the edges represent the proteins enriched
  in GO term.
