caption: Activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway. cGAS is activated by sensing
  cytosolic DNA either from pathogenic DNA or self-DNA. Activated cGAS utilizes ATP
  and GTP to produce the second messenger cGAMP. cGAMP binds to the ER adaptor STING,
  which can also be activated by CDNs derived from bacteria. Activated STING translocates
  from the ER to Golgi compartments and recruits TBK1, which further recruits IRF3
  for phosphorylation and dimerization. The phosphorylated IRF3 dimer then enters
  the nucleus and functions in concert with NF-κB to induce the expression of type
  I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines.
