caption: The core module of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Hormone (Epo) binding
  to the EpoR results in transphosphorylation (double-headed arrow) of JAK2 and subsequently
  in tyrosine phosphorylation (P) of JAK2 and the EpoR cytoplasmic domain. Phosphotyrosine
  residues 343 and 401 in the EpoR mediate recruitment of monomeric STAT5 (x1). Upon
  receptor recruitment, monomeric STAT5 is tyrosine phosphorylated (x2), dimerizes
  (x3), and migrates to the nucleus (x4), where it binds to the promoter of target
  genes and is dephosphorylated and exported to the cytoplasm. The arrow with the
  dashed line indicates the possibility for STAT5 to reenter the cytoplasm.
