caption: 'Working model of the role of CD47:SIRPs signaling in health and during type
  1 diabetes pathogenesis: (A) CD47 and signal regulatory protein (SIRP) are expressed
  by immune cells during a healthy state. CD47 controls calcium (Ca2+) signaling in
  β-cells, through an unknown pathway, that promotes both cell adhesion and insulin
  production as well (, , , ). Also, CD47 is hypothesized to control protective autophagy
  via BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and Beclin-1 binding (, ). CD47 and SIRPα
  signaling can occur either in trans or in cis with each other or with other ligands,
  such as SIRPγ. We hypothesize that a reduction of SIRP expression and/or activity
  occurs on immune cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D), thus inhibiting peripheral immune
  tolerance. (B) Decreased CD47 and SIRPα activity in β-cells could potentially inhibit
  insulin secretion and cell survival while increasing immune cell-mediated destruction.
