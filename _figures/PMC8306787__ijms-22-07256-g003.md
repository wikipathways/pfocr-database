caption: Molecular effects of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) and myocardial infarction-associated
  transcript (MIAT) on insulin resistance. (a) High-fat diet (HFD)-induced cAMP response
  element-binding protein (CREB) activation promotes MEG3 expression. (b) MEG3 overexpression
  inhibits miR-214, promoting activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) expression,
  activating forkhead box O1(FoxO1), and increasing fatty acid synthase (FAS), leading
  to a lipotoxic environment. (c) MEG3 inhibits the action of miR-302a-3p, which leads
  to the activation of the CREB-CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator (CRTC2)
  complex, increasing their interaction with ATF4 and leading to the expression of
  gluconeogenic proteins. (d) MEG3 expression inhibits miR-185-5p, leading to early
  growth response protein-2 (EGR2) overexpression. (e) Inhibition of miR-140-5p by
  MEG3 promotes cellular senescence. (f) MEG3 overexpression increases proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma (PPARγ) expression and FAS activation, leading to the production
  of fatty acids and lipotoxic effects. Furthermore, (1) the overexpression of MIAT
  prevents the inhibition of FoxO1 by miR-139-5p, promoting FAS expression and raising
  the levels of FFAs. (2) MIAT inhibits miR-145, thereby inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway, which leads to a reduction in insulin
  sensitivity. (3) The inhibition of miR-29c by MIAT facilitates the expression and
  action of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), promoting a lipotoxic environment. (4) After
  the inhibition of miR-150-5p by MIAT, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha
  (TNF-α), and interleukins 6, and 1β increase.
