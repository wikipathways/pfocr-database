caption: 'The metabolism of cancer cells relying on the Warburg effect. Cancer cell
  metabolism is supported by glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and/or FAO. Glycolysis is
  enhanced: PFK1 is promoted by F2,6P produced by PFKFB3. Dimeric embryonic PKM2 creates
  a bottleneck at the end of glycolysis promoting branched pathway activities: PPP
  provides R5P for nucleotide synthesis, the DHAP pathway provides G3P for triglyceride
  synthesis, and SGFMP sustains protein and glutathione synthesis, as well as one-carbon
  metabolism required for methylation processes (in particular of epigenome and genome),
  and for polyamine formation. The Warburg effect is related to PDH inhibition by
  PDK1, a process stimulated by HIF1 and AKT. Lactate produced by LDH5 is expulsed
  by MCT4. Due to PDH inactivation, acetyl-CoA is produced by FAO or derives from
  oxidation of AKGα, which enters the Krebs cycle (also named the TCA cycle). Cytosolic
  citrate derives from mitochondrial export or from carboxylation of AKG deriving
  from glutaminolysis. ACLY transforms citrate into OAA and acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA
  sustains lipid synthesis and histone acetylation while OAA sustains aspartate synthesis
  or pyruvate and lactate formation. Glycolysis is green, PPP is blue, amino acid
