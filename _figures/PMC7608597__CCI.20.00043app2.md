caption: 'Evaluation and consolidation of breast cancer surgery information for 15,666
  patients with consolidated cancer diagnosis records in the Department of Defense
  Central Cancer Registry (CCR) and Military Health System Data Repository (MDR) linked
  databases: Military Cancer Epidemiology Data System (MilCanEpi). (†) Other records
  available for cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, or noncancer medical care for
  data source that does not contain the variable under comparison. (‡) Logical order
  determined by considering the same variable being compared between the databases
  (eg, diagnosis dates from both) or different variables being compared, either within
  the same database or between two databases; order of diagnosis and treatment variables
  compared with tumor site–specific clinical guidelines; reasonable expectations as
  a result of clinical working procedures (eg, surgery to remove tumor tissue prior
  to pathology for diagnosis); and reasonable time frame for diagnosis or treatment
  determined by clinical practice (eg, primary treatment within 6 months of diagnosis).
  (§) Both information and date retained from records selected via this pathway (eg,
  if CCR is the data source containing the information, then the date is also selected
  from CCR for analysis). (††) MDR data source for cancer treatment. See Methods for
  more detail.'
