caption: Rho signaling in the maintenance of amoeboid morphology and invasion/metastasis
  of sarcoma cells. The activation of Rho, ROCK and the phosphorylation of MLC are
  all crucial for the effective invasiveness/metastasis of amoeboid sarcoma cells.
  In contrast, the rounded morphology of amoeboid sarcoma cells is not dependent on
  MLC phosphorylation or non-muscle myosin II ATPase activity, suggesting another
  downstream effectors of Rho/ROCK pathway are involved in the maintenance of rounded
  morphology of cancer cells.
