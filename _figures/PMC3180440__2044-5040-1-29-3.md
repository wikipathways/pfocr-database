caption: Regulation of the late myogenic transcriptional program by the kinome. The
  figure shows the mechanisms by which the kinases described in the text coordinate
  myoblast cell cycle exit, myoblast differentiation, myocyte fusion and myotube hypertrophy.
  Cell-cell contact and N-cadherin ligation, in conjunction with transforming growth
  factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and MAP kinase kinase 3/6 (MKK), activate p38α.
  p38α induces cell cycle exit and differentiation through the phosphorylation of
  MEF2 and E47 that together with MyoD form part of an active myogenic transcriptional
  complex. A subunit of this complex is RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), which is phosphorylated
  and activated by cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9). Akt2, in response to IGF stimulation,
  phosphorylates the transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase p300,
  which is part of the same myogenic transcriptional complex. Activation of the Akt2
  pathway promotes differentiation and hypertrophy by several other mechanisms as
  well. Akt2 phosphorylates and inactivates the FoxO family of transcription factors,
  whose activities are inhibitory to differentiation and hypertrophy. Phosphorylation
  of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by Akt2 encourages protein synthesis/hypertrophy,
  partly through mTOR's phosphorylation and activation of the ribosomal protein S6
  kinase 1 (S6K). Akt2 can also phosphorylate and inhibit glycogen synthase kinase
  3β (GSK3). When active, GSK3 inhibits differentiation and hypertrophy through phosphorylation
  and cytoplasmic sequestration of NFATC3. Phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3 similarly
  prevents its nuclear accumulation and ability to activate the TCF/LEF family of
  transcription factors. Finally, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  2 (ERK2) by an unknown stimulus promotes cell fusion through the phosphorylation
  and nuclear accumulation of NFAT3 via the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2).
