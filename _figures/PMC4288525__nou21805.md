caption: TGF-β–dependent regulation of VEGF release in glioblastoma. Proposed model
  for the regulation of VEGF by TGF-β (straight arrows) and HIF (dotted arrows). TGF-β
  released from cells of the tumor microenvironment (eg, endothelial, immune, and
  microglial cells) signals via TGF-βRII and ALK-5 leading to phosphorylation of SMAD2,
  SMAD3, and SMAD1/5/8 and increased VEGF release. BMP-dependent pSMAD1/5/8 signaling
  (dashed arrows) destabilizes HIF and thereby indirectly reduces VEGF. TGF-β–dependent
  SMAD1/5/8 signaling requires, beyond TGF-βRII, a non-ALK-5-type-I-receptor (TGF-β-RI-x).
  Overall, VEGF release is modulated in a cell-specific and context-dependent manner,
  with a predominance of either hypoxia-, TGF-β–, or BMP-driven signaling for ZH-161
  GICs exhibiting low endogenous TGF-β levels but stable endogenous HIF-1α, VEGF release
  is highly resistant to TGF-β pathway inhibition at baseline conditions but is sensitive
  when TGF-β is abundant. In contrast, LN-308 cells, characterized by high endogenous
  TGF-β and pSMAD2/3 levels, are highly sensitive for TGF-β pathway inhibition via
  ALK-5 and SMAD2/3 but not for inhibition of SMAD5 at baseline. In U87MG cells, the
  duality of pSMAD1/5/8 signaling as driven both by TGF-β and BMPs becomes apparent.
  SMAD5 at baseline conditions with low endogenous TGF-β negatively regulates VEGF,
  probably via BMP-driven destabilization of HIF, but positively regulates VEGF when
  TGF-β is abundant.
