caption: 'Overview of the Complement System. Bacteria like L. monocytogenes can activate
  the complement system in one of three ways. In the classical pathway, antibodies
  (Ab) bind to the bacterial surface and undergo a conformational change allowing
  C1q to bind their Fc region. The activated C1 complex then cleaves C4 and C2 to
  generate the classical C3 convertase, C4bC2a. In the lectin pathway, mannose binding
  lectin (MBL) binds mannose residues on the surface of L. monocytogenes. MBL can
  then form a complex with MASP-1 and MASP-2 that cleaves C4 and C2 similar to the
  C1 complex. Finally, in the alternative pathway, the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3
  leads to the formation of a fluid phase C3 convertase C3(H2O)Bb that can cleave
  C3. C3b then deposits on the surface of L. monocytogenes and binds factor B (fB)
  to form the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb. This convertase allows for
  the complement amplification loop. Ultimately, all pathways converge on C3 and result
  in the generation of three types of complement effector molecules: C3b, C3a and
  C5a, and the membrane attack complex (C5b-9).'
