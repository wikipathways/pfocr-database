caption: 'Overview of differentially expressed metabolites and detected pathway abnormalities
  by group and levodopa status. Upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) metabolites
  with p-value ≤ 0.05; additionally highlighted with yellow for FDR ≤ 0.05. The lightning
  icons denote potentially impacted pathways (regardless of primary causality) based
  on abnormalities found in differential analysis and correlation analysis. Notice
  that the alterations revealed in DOPA− PD subjects with dementia are well reflected
  in metabolite concentrations after levodopa-induced Hcy challenge. Light green—enzymes;
  purple—vitamin B cofactors. Abbreviations: BHMT, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase;
  CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; CSE, cystathionine γ-lyase; MTHF, methyltetrahydrofolate;
  MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTR, methionine synthase; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; THF, tetrahydrofolate.'
