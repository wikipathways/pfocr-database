caption: Proposed scheme for the final biosynthetic reactions of the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in Escherichia coli. Initially, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate
  (DOXP) is converted into MEP by DOXP reductoisomerase (Dxr). Subsequently, the enzymes
  YgbP, YchB and YgbB catalyse the transformation of MEP into 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  2,4-cyclopyrophosphate (MEcPP), with a molecular mass (Mr) of 278. GcpE is involved
  in the next step(s) using MEcPP as substrate to produce the γδ T-cell activator,
  (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMB-PP) with Mr 262, whereas LytB
  mediates a/the subsequent reaction leading to IPP.
