caption: (A) Canonical β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) signaling response, the anti-inflammatory
  cytokine profile mediated by protein kinase A (PKA), and the major anti-inflammatory
  cellular mediators of the resulting anti-inflammatory immune response. (B) The physiological
  G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)1/2-mediated β2-AR desensitization/downregulation
  in spleen cells from rats with inflammatory arthritis, the reported directional
  changes in cytokine profiles compared with controls, and the predicted cellular
  mediators of the resulting immune response. (C) The pathological GRK5/6-mediated
  activation of the ERK1/2 pathway in immune cells from lymph node cells that drain
  the affected joints (DLN cells) from rats with inflammatory arthritis, the reported
  directional changes in cytokine profiles compared with controls, and the predicted
  cellular mediators of the resulting immune response. Predicted immune cell mediators
  are based on well-documented functions and cytokine profiles secreted by specific
  populations of immune cells, particularly the secretion of the anti-inflammatory
  cytokines, interleukin (IL)-10 and tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) by regulatory B
  and T cells (Breg and Treg, respectively), IL-10 by myeloid dendritic cells (mDC),
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by macrophages, IL-2 by Th2 cells, and interferon
  (IFN)-γ by T-helper (Th)1 and Th17/Th1 cells. Predicted M1 and M2 macrophages are
  based on their ability to drive a Th1/Th17 or Th2-type immune responses. SNS, sympathetic
  nervous system.
