caption: 'Our manuscript denotes the neuroprotective effects of many phytochemical
  classes, including those from flavonoids and alkaloids, against neurodegeneration.
  Flavonoids (luteolin and quercetin) and alkaloids (berberine, huperzine A, and caffeine),
  as demonstrated by the included studies, exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and
  anti-apoptotic activities, therefore improving pain control and promoting cognitive
  stimulation. In addition, alkaloids are neuro-stimulants, thus enhancing neurotransmission.
  Abbreviations: JAK/STAT, Janus kinase pathway and the signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; NLRP3, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 3;
  Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2; PERK, PRKR-like endoplasmic reticulum
  kinase; PI3K/Akt, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B; SIRT1, silent
  mating type 2 homolog 1; SOCS 1, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1'
