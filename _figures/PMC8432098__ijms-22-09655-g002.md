caption: The surface of the ER facilitates mitochondrial targeting of proteins that
  use the ER-SURF pathway. Precursor proteins can reach mitochondria during, or after,
  their synthesis on cytosolic ribosomes. Some mitochondrial precursors are directed
  to the ER surface. For example, metabolite carriers were observed to be bound by
  Get3, a chaperone that facilitates ER-targeting of TA proteins. Some mitochondrial
  membrane proteins, such as Oxa1 and Psd1, are recognized by the SRP. For other mitochondrial
  proteins, such as Alo1, targeting factors were not identified so far. Djp1 is an
  ER-associated protein that facilitates the transfer of ER-bound proteins to mitochondria.
