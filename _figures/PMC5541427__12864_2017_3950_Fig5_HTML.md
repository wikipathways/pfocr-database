caption: 'Effect of selecting different subsets of CpG sites in the “TNF signaling
  pathway”. Genes colored in gray do not contain any passing CpG sites. Filtering
  criteria are: (a) all CpG sites; (b) sites located at upstream or in the UTR5 of
  a gene; (c) sites with a standard deviation >0.2; (d) sites identified by Saguaro;
  (e) Gene expression; (f) sites with a high inverse correlation between methylation
  and expression. For each gene, the three boxes are colored according to average
  methylation (a-d and f) or median expression (e)'
