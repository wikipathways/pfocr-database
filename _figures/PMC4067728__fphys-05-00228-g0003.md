caption: Molecular actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 in inflammation and energy homeostasis in
  adipocytes. Stimulation via e.g., lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TNF-α via specific receptors
  e.g., Toll like receptor (TLR), IL-6 receptors (IL-6R) activate Nuclear factor kappa-B
  (NFκB) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38MAPK) signaling dependent transcription
  of inflammatory genes such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha
  (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β). 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits inflammation by inhibiting
  Inhibitor kappa-B (IκBα) phosphorylation and translocation of NFκB as well P38MAPK
  into the nucleus. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D3 affects energy homeostasis. VDR−/− mice
  increases energy expenditure through uncoupling proteins (UCPs). The arrows in the
  figure indicate activation and blunted line indicate inhibition. The red lines and
  arrows indicate the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on inflammatory signaling pathway.
