caption: mRNA in vitro transcription and innate immunity activation. (A) mRNA in vitro
  transcription. Using DNA with the antigen-encoding sequence as template, mRNA in
  vitro transcription products contain single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), double-stranded
  RNA (dsRNA), etc. The ssRNA structure normally includes five-prime cap (5′ cap),
  five-prime untranslated region (5′ UTR), open reading frame (ORF) region, three-prime
  untranslated region (3′ UTR), and poly (A) tail structure. (B) RNA translation and
  antigen presentation. Through endocytosis, mRNAs enter the cytoplasm. Some mRNAs
  combine with ribosomes of the host cell and translate successfully. Antigen proteins
  can be degraded to antigenic peptides by proteasome in the cytoplasm and presented
  to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I pathway.
  Or, they can be released out of the host cell and taken up by DCs. Then, they are
  degraded and presented to helper T cells and B cells via MHC-II pathway. B cells
  can also recognize released antigen proteins. (C) Self-adjuvant effect. Various
  of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can recognize mRNA in vitro transcription
  product. ssRNA can be recognized by endosomal innate immune receptors (e.g., Toll-like
  receptor 7 (TLR7), TLR8). dsRNA can be recognized by endosomal innate immune receptors
  (e.g., TLR3) and cytoplasmic innate immune receptors (e.g., protein kinase RNA-activated
  (PKR), retinoic acid-indu [] cible gene I protein (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5), and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthase (OAS). Based on those, mRNA
  products can stimulate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon
  (IFN), which leads to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) activation and inflammatory
  reaction. However, they can also activate antiviral enzymes that cause stalled mRNA
  translation and mRNA degradation.
