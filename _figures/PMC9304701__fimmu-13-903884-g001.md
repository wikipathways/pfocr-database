caption: Proposed model of trained immunity induced by exNef. The figure shows suggested
  sequence of events occurring when monocyte encounters Nef-containing extracellular
  vesicle (exNef). ExNef induces proteasomal degradation of plasma membrane ABCA1,
  modifying lipid rafts and increasing their abundance. Lipid raft changes promote
  dimerization and activation of TLR4 (TLR4* in the figure), which sends activating
  signal to inflammatory genes. Additionally, exNef stimulates glycolysis and cholesterol
  biosynthesis. One of the intermediate products of glycolysis, fumarate, is a negative
  regulator of the KDM5 histone demethylase, inhibition of which promotes trimethylation
  of the H3 histone on the K4 residue (H3K4me3). Another product of glycolysis, citrate,
  stimulates synthesis of Acetyl-CoA, which is a positive regulator of histone acetyltransferase
  and promotes acetylation of the H3 histone on the K27 residue (H3K27ac). Both modifications
  are associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. These events lead to epigenetic
  modifications resulting in sustained changes in lipid rafts and inflammatory cytokine
  production. ExNef also suppress ABCA1 maturation and delivery to plasma membrane,
  resulting in decreased ABCA1 and suppressed cholesterol efflux. The cell becomes
  enriched in cholesterol, and the abundance of lipid rafts further increases, exacerbating
  events described above. An intermediate product of cholesterol biosynthesis, mevalonate,
  is secreted from the cell and stimulates the IGF1R, whose representation is increased
  on overabundant lipid rafts. Signaling from IGF1R stimulates the Akt-mTOR pathway,
  which further potentiates epigenetic remodeling. Histone modifications alter expression
  of lipid raft regulating proteins (ABCA1 is shown as an example, switching from
  active to suppressed state) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF switch
  from suppressed to active state). Epigenetic changes in lipid raft regulating genes
  ensure persistent ‘activation’ of the lipid rafts, whereas epigenetic modifications
  of cytokine genes lead to overreaction to inflammatory stimuli. Together, these
  two mechanisms synergize to promote inflammation.
