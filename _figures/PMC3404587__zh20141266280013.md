caption: Scheme for MKP-1-dependent regulation of Na+ reabsorption by hypotonic stress
  in renal epithelial A6 cells. Under isotonic conditions, active (phosphorylated)
  ERK suppresses β- and γ-ENaC mRNA expression. Hypotonic stress activates p38. Active
  p38 promotes MKP-1 mRNA expression and MKP-1 dephosphorylates ERK. Dephosphorylated
  ERK is inactive and, therefore, ERK no longer inhibits β- and γ-ENaC mRNA expression,
  leading to increased accumulation of ENaC in a subapical, cytosolic pool. The final
  hypotonic stress-mediated translocation of newly synthesized ENaC in this subapical
  pool to the apical membrane is mainly regulated through other signaling pathways,
  in particular, the JNK-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which is also
  activated by hypotonicity.
