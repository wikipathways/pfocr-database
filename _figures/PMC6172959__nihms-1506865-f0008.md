caption: '(A) mTOR’s role in STING-mediated antiviral responses. Sensors (e.g. cGAS,
  IFI16, DNA-PK) activate STING, which induces ER stress. mTOR is central to the antiviral
  response as: 1) mTORC2 regulates cGAS stability; 2) reducing mTORC1 activity resolves
  STING-induced ER stress into an interferon response; 3) mTORC1 enhances translation
  of ISGs after they are induced. As lowering mTORC1 activity to resolve ER stress
  results in lower ISG translation and stimulates mTORC2 that degrades cGAS, mTORC1-mTORC2
  crosstalk carefully balances the host response pathway. HSV-1 replicates in the
  nucleus and does not need to disrupt mTORC1-mTORC2 crosstalk to counter cGAS, but
  instead encodes antagonists of nuclear sensors (e.g. IFI16, DNA-PK) as well as IFNs
  and PKR. (B) Poxvirus F17 blocks STING-mediated antiviral responses. By disrupting
  the mTORC1-mTORC2 regulatory circuit, F17 drives cGAS degradation while also blocking
  STING-mediated ER-stress resolution and IRF3 translocation to the nucleus. This
  broadly counters other DNA sensors that also signal through STING, complementing
  the activities of sensor-specific antagonists. While disrupting sensing this dysregulation
  strategy retains the benefits of mTOR-mediated stimulation of viral protein synthesis.'
