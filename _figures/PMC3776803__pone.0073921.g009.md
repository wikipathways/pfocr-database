caption: 'Overall, the study deals with the modulation of source (leaves) and sink
  (pods) strength under TU treatment. The key steps are depicted as red bold letters.
  The green and red arrows represent the increase and decrease in expression/activity
  of associated gene/protein, respectively. The broken green arrow represents the
  non-coordinated change. The TU mediated increased photosynthetic efficiency coupled
  with higher expression level of sugar transporter (TPT) and activities of FPBase
  and SPS provided building blocks for enhanced sucrose biosynthesis at cytoplasm.
  The SUT-4 dependent vacuolar sequestration and enhanced activities of INVs and SuSy
  further supported the sucrose synthesis through feed-forward regulation. After unloading
  at sink, the photoassimilates gets channelized towards ACC-mediated oil biosynthesis
  either through glycolytic or PEPC pathway. Abbreviations: 3PGA: 3-phosphogyyceric
