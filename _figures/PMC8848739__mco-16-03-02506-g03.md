caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis indicating pazopanib. The red geometric shape
  indicates an increase in measurement. The green geometric shape indicates a decrease
  in measurement. The orange geometric shape indicates an increase in prediction of
  the activity of connected signaling node. The blue geometric node indicates a decrease
  in prediction of the activity of connected signaling node. The glow around a geometric
  shape indicates activity when opposite of measurement. The orange line indicates
  an interaction leading to activation. The blue line indicates an interaction leading
  to inhibition. The yellow line indicates findings inconsistent with state of downstream
  molecule. The grey line indicates effect not predicted.
