caption: Schematic of mechanisms of steroid action on cellular responses. Genomic
  and non-genomic, ligand-dependent and ligand-independent, classic and non-classic
  receptor-mediated steroid-steroid receptor signaling pathways are shown. Membrane-Initiated
  Steroid Signaling (MISS) is also depicted, representing the rapid response initiated
  when membrane-bound estrogen receptors interact with estrogens. The receptors are
  found in the cytoplasm of target cells, where they are associated with large heat-shock
  protein-containing complexes that keep the receptors inactive. When the steroid
  hormone receptor binds to the ligand, it undergoes a series of changes. It releases
  inhibitory proteins, forms dimers, moves into the nucleus, and interacts with specific
  enhancers or hormone response elements near the promoters in target genes. This
  process of activation allows the receptors to directly interact with specific estrogen
  response elements on DNA or be attached to DNA through interactions with other transcription
  factors that are already at the enhancers. Signaling pathways like MAPK can converge
  on receptor-coregulator complexes, modifying their activity and enabling receptors
  to activate target gene transcription without a classical ligand. (Created with
