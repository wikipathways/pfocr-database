caption: 'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene and stimulated intracellular
  signaling cascades after activation of tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk)B. A: Mouse
  and rat BDNF genes (we referred to the description by Aid et al[]). Each BDNF transcript
  is comprised of one of eight 5’ untranslated exons (exon I-VIII) and the common
  3’ protein coding exon IX; B: Intracellular signaling after TrkB activation. Following
  BDNF binding, TrkB dimerization and its phosphorylation at intracellular tyrosine
  residues occur. Then, the activated TrkB stimulates three main signaling pathways:
  (1) mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK);
  (2) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K); and (3) phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) pathways.
  MAPK pathway, in which MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) is involved, plays a role in the neuronal
  differentiation and outgrowth. PI3K signaling promotes neuronal survival via Ras
  or GRB-associated binder 1 (Gab1). Following PLCγ activation, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) are both produced. DAG activates protein kinase C
  (PKC), which is important for regulation of synaptic plasticity. Meanwhile, IP3
  increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration via IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), resulting in activation of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein
  kinase including CaMKII, CaMKK, and CaMKI. These MAPK/ERK, PI3K, and PLCγ pathways
  can regulate gene transcription.'
