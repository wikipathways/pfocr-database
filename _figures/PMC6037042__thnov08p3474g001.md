caption: 'Design and proposed active mechanism for the intracellular protein delivery
  platform based on rod-like pure drug nanoparticles (PNPs) with cellular entry bypassing
  endo-lysosomes. (1) Preparation of PNPs via antisolvent-precipitation. (2) Proteins,
  such as caspase 3 or BSA, are loaded on the PNPs surface to prepare PNPplex through
  electrostatic interaction. (3) Hyaluronic acid (HA) is used to further coat PNPplex
  and form HA-PNPplex, aiming to shield the positive charge and target CD44 receptors.
  The proposed procedure in vivo: (4) HA-PNPplex are administered via intravenous
  injection (i.v.), (5) accumulate in the tumor site, (6) enter cancer cells through
  CD44-receptor mediation via the caveosome pathway without entrapment in endo-lysosomes,
  and finally (7) release protein and drug in cytoplasm for disease therapy.'
