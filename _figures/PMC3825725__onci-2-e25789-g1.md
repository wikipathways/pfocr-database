caption: Figure 1. Sterile inflammatory response induced by cyclophosphamide. The
  administration of cyclophosphamide results in the death of highly proliferating
  cells (including lymphocytes and monocytes) along with the activation of the p53
  signaling pathway and type I interferon (IFN)-regulated genes, favoring the elicitation
  of the innate immune responses. Dead cells indeed emit danger-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs) that can be recognized by pattern recognition receptors on antigen
  presenting cells, such monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). These DAMPs generally
  stimulate the phagocytosis of apoptotic corpses, exacerbate antigen presentation
  and promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the homeostatic
  proliferation and activation of T cells.
