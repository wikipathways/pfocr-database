caption: Molecular mechanism of the regulation of type I interferon signature by VGLL3
  in fibroblast-like synoviocytes of rheumatoid arthritis via targeting the Hippo
  pathway. In fibroblast-like synoviocytes of rheumatoid arthritis, VGLL3 inhibits
  the expression of WWTR1 which is the core protein in the hippo pathway. By downregulating
  WWTR1, VGLL3 enables the phosphorylation of IRF3 and drives the IRF3-induced IFN-β1
  secretion. Secreted IFN-β1 subsequently promotes the type I IFN signature expression
  through autocrine IFN-β1 signaling. Blocking type I IFN signaling with Tofacitinib
  strongly represses the VGLL3-induced ISGs expressions
