caption: 'Wnt signal transduction. In the cytoplasm, β-catenin is phosphorylated by
  the complexes of GSK-3β, APC and Axin and is then rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome
  system. The canonical pathway is activated by ligands, such as Wnt1 and Wnt3a, through
  their binding to FZD receptors and LRP5/6 complexes. Inhibition of GSK-3β induces
  accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. Accumulated β-catenin translocates into
  the nucleus and induces the expression of target genes with TCF/LEF1 and CBP. The
  non-canonical pathway is activated by ligands, such as Wnt5a, through their binding
  to FZD receptors or FZD/ Ror1/2 complexes. This binding activates the pathway without
  β-catenin. LRP5/6 has four BP domains (BP1 to BP4), with tertiary structures of
  proteins composed of β-sheets outside the cell. The BP domain is the region of Wnt
  ligand binding. The binding of DKK1 to the LRP5/6 receptors inhibits the canonical
  Wnt signaling pathway. DKK1 is known to bind to the BP1 and BP3 domains. DKK1 forms
  a complex with LRP5/6 and Kremen, which induces the internalization of the complex.
  The binding of Sclerostin to the LRP5/6 receptors also inhibits the canonical Wnt
  signaling pathway. Sclerostin is known to bind to the BP1 domain. The binding of
  Sclerostin to the LRP4 enhances its suppressive effects on the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway. The sFRP family functions as a decoy receptor of Wnt, because it has the
  CRD that can bind Wnt ligand and inhibits both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling.
  ZNRF3 and RNF43 are target genes of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and act
  as ubiquitin E3 ligases for FZD. Thus, Wnt-induced expression of ZNRF3 and RNF43
  degrades FZD proteins to suppress Wnt signaling. RSPO family of secreted proteins
  forms a complex with the LGR, which amplifies Wnt signaling via ZNRF3/RNF43 degradation.
