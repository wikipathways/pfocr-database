caption: 'Key characteristics of models used to recreate cardiac systems in vitro
  and relevant signaling pathways. (a) The canonical Wnt signaling pathway involves
  stimulation of the LRP5/6-Frizzled receptor by Wnt ligands, allowing for the destruction
  complex (CK1, AXIN, GSK3β, APC) to interact with Frizzled and thus lose its ability
  to degrade β-catenin. β-catenin is then free to translocate to the nucleus and form
  complexes with TCF/LEF, inducing transcription of various genes. The pathway can
  be similarly activated by small molecule inhibitors of GSK3β which prevent β-catenin
  degradation, allowing for its nuclear translocation. In the absence of LRP5/6-Frizzled
  stimulation, the destruction complex (CK1, AXIN, GSK3β, APC) binds and targets β-catenin
  for degradation. Protocols used for cardiac organoid derivation usually entail initial
  activation of Wnt signaling with small molecules (CHIR, BIO) that inhibit GSK3β,
  followed by Wnt signaling inhibition to induce cardiac mesoderm formation. In some
  studies, a third wave of Wnt signaling stimulation can be applied to induce pro-epicardium
  formation and increase complexity of the derived construct. Additional factors such
  as BMP4 and Activin A can be used to facilitate cardiac mesoderm formation and special
  media can be used to enhance organoid maturation by recapitulating late metabolic
  and hormonal in vivo gestation conditions. Gastruloids are usually generated through
  use of appropriate gastruloid growth medium along with additional factors depending
  on the sought-after lineages. Cardiac tissue morphogenesis generally comprises the
  initial formation of cardiac crescents, followed by migration of cardiac progenitors
  towards the midline and formation of a single heart tube. Eventually, chamber formation,
  right-sided looping and tissue growth/maturation occurs, generating late fetal cardiac
  forms arranging into the well-known cardiac shape found in postnatal and adult organisms.
  (b) Various models can be produced to recreate cardiac systems in vitro: some exhibit
  chamber formations (shown in the top left area), others are derived with protocols
  aimed at inducing structural/functional maturation (shown in the bottom area) while
  others are developed as cardiac gastruloid models (shown in the top right area).
  The characteristics of each system, along with any additional factors that induce
  special conditions; for example, the addition of LN/ET or LN521/511 to aid in chamber
  formation in some models, are noted as well. While many of these organoids exhibit
  vascular networks, others are derived with protocols specifically aimed at inducing
  vascularization (constructs noted as ‘vascularized organoids’). Organoid constructs
  not fitting in any of those three categories are pictured outside of the three circular
