caption: Model of MAPK phosphorylation-enhanced Ets-1/Ets-2-CBP/p300 interaction.
  (Upper panel) In the absence of Ras/MAPK signaling, unphosphorylated Ets-1 and Ets-2
  are bound with associated corepressors (CO-REP) to RREs. (Lower panel) Upon Ras
  pathway stimulation, ERKs become activated by phosphorylation and translocate to
  the nucleus. Activated ERKs are recruited by docking with the PNT domain to phosphorylate
  Ets-1 and Ets-2 at T38 and T72, respectively. We speculate that this association
  happens at the RRE and that CBP/p300 binding then ensues. We also illustrate that
  recruited CBP/p300 then increases transcription in part by stabilizing preinitiation
  complex formation (i.e., RNA pol II and the basal machinery) at the promoter (reviewed
  in reference ). Additional DNA binding factors, such as AP-1, Pit-1, and vitamin
  D receptors (dashed box), may also bind the activated promoter.
