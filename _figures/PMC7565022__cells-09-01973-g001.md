caption: Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. (A) In the absence of HH ligands (the OFF
  state), Patched (PTCH) inhibits Smoothened (SMO) from primary cilia, and Suppressor
  of Fused (SUFU) binds to glioma-associated oncogenes (GLIs) and inhibits their localization
  to primary cilia and nuclei. SUFU binding of GLI1 and GLI2 is degraded, leading
  to the GLI2 or GLI3 repressor forms, followed by N-terminus processing of GLI3 and
  a part of GLI2, suppressing GLI target gene expression. (B) In the presence of HH
  ligands (the ON state), one of the HH ligands binds to PTCH and prevents PTCH from
  inhibiting SMO. Next, SMO translocates to primary cilia to be fully activated. SMO
  then mainly activates GLI2, and the activated GLI2 induces GLI1 expression. GLI1
  is also activated downstream of SMO. Activated GLI2 (GLI2A) and GLI1 further upregulate
  the expression of various GLI target genes. Only core components of the HH signaling
  pathway are shown in this figure, which is modified from our previous work [].
