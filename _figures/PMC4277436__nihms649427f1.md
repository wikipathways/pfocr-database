caption: The myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway of Toll-like
  receptor signalling involves Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) dimerization between
  the receptor and the MyD88-adaptor-like protein (MAL). Recruitment of MyD88 and
  downstream activation of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) via Interleukin-1
  receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) proteins results in TRAF6-mediated activation
  of the inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) kinase (IKK) complex and liberation
  of NF-κB from the complex. Free NF-κB is then able to bind DNA and act as a gene
  transcription regulator (reviewed in REF. ). IL-33 signalling appears to share many
  of these properties and events downstream of IL-33 stimulation may include phosphorylation
  of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, p38 MAPK, JNKs as well as activation
  of NF-κB. It has been proposed that caspase-1-dependent cleavage of pro-IL-33, subsequent
  lysosomal navigation and fusion with the cell plasma membrane results in release
  of IL-33 into the interstitium as an active cytokine,. IL-33 binds to its receptor
  complex composed of ST2L (the transmembrane isoform of ST2) and the IL-1 receptor
  accessory protein IL-1RAcP. Subsequent sequestering of the adaptor proteins MyD88
  and MAL results in modulation of IRAK mediated TRAF6 activation and subsequent mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) and IKK/NF-κB activation,. The nature of this modulation of
  NF-κB activity by IL-33 is complex. In unstimulated cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts
  in vitro, exposure to IL-33 activates NF-κB. However, NF-κB activation via hypertrophic
  stimuli is attenuated by exposure to IL-33 (REF. ). Interestingly, although TRAF6
  appears to be required for IL-33-mediated NF-κB activation and downstream induction
  of Th2 cytokines, IL-33-mediated ERK activation might be TRAF6 independent. Furthermore,
  IL-33 might activate the transcription factor AP-1 independently of its effects
  on NF-κB. Exactly where the pivotal points of IL-33 signal regulation reside along
  this pathway from IL-33 receptor activation to NF-κB activity modulation is still
  unclear. Even before IL-33 binds to its receptor, its action could be altered by
  the decoy receptor soluble ST2 (sST2). sST2 is a variant of the full-length ST2
  gene lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains contained within the structure
  of the transmembrane isoform of the gene. sST2 in the extracellular environment
  might bind free IL-33, thereby effectively decreasing the concentration of IL-33
  that is available for ST2L binding and reducing the biological effect of IL-33 (REF.
  ).
