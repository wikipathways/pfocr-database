caption: The ferroptotic induced peroxidation of phospholipids is mediated by the
  cyst(e)ine/GSH/GPX4 regulatory pathway. The system Xc antiporter mediates the exchange
  of extracellular cystine with intracellular glutamate. When cystine is internalized,
  it gets reduced to cysteine which is one of the precursors for the biosynthesis
  of GSH. GPX4 utilizes GSH as a cofactor for the reduction of toxic lipid peroxides
  into the respective alcohols. Depletion of either GSH or GPX4 will cause an increase
  in lipid peroxides that will damage the cell membrane, and lead to ferroptotic cell
  death—a form of cell death implicated in a wide variety of human diseases.
