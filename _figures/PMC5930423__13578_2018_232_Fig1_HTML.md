caption: PD-L1 on either tumor cells or host immune cells is proposed to function
  in preventing T cell-mediated tumor killing. PD-1 is highly expressed in exhausted
  effector T cells. PD-L1 is constitutively expressed in some tumors and host immune
  cells, and its expression can be induced or maintained by many factors. PD-1-PD-L1
  interaction drives T cell dysfunction, which results in a weaker tumor killing ability
  in effector T cells. Therefore, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies-mediated specific blockade
  of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can enhance antitumor immunity
