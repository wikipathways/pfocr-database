caption: The upper panel depicts PTH-activated survival pathways, and the negative
  feedback on these pathways caused by stimulation of Runx2 degradation. The lower
  panel depicts the transient anti-apoptotic signaling and the changes in Runx2 that
  occur upon each injection of PTH. The net result is a temporary delay in osteoblast
  apoptosis. As injected PTH disappears from the circulation, Runx2 returns to basal
  levels and the cells are positioned to generate another episode of anti-apoptotic
  signaling in response to a subsequent injection. With sustained PTH elevation, on
  the other hand, the negative feedback pathway remains active, and further anti-apoptosis
  signaling is abrogated.
