caption: Representation of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway and the secondary cell
  wall domain embedded with expression data of lignin-related genes. Color code represents
  expression depicted as log2 fold change (FC) of transcripts per million (TPM) normalized
  by the expression value of each gene at 0 h. Only genes detected as differentially
  expressed in at least one comparison are shown. Each heatmap shows one hom(e)ologous
  genes per line for a given gene family and columns denote the different samples.
  Black and gray bars on the top of each heatmap indicate control and induced samples,
  respectively. Figure was adapted from MapMan4 () and includes all enzymatic steps
  toward monolignol biosynthesis, in addition to monolignol p-coumaroylation and oxidation.
