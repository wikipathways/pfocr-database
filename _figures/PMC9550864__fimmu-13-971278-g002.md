caption: Hyal2 translocation is required for the degradation of extracellular hyaluronan.
  In a quiescent state, the Hyal2 molecule in myeloid cells resides predominantly
  in intracellular space (A). However, activation of the CD44 signaling pathway results
  in translocation of Hyal2 to the cellular membrane, enabling the degradation of
  extracellular HA (B). Depicted yellow crosses indicate the activated status of the
  enzyme Hyal2.
