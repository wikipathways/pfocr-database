caption: Dietary or host-derived substrates may be metabolized by different microbial
  groups, which are divided in this schematic by major metabolic function (e.g., acetogen).
  The sequential action of glycolytic and fermentation pathways (shown within the
  green box representing a Bacteroides cell; ED= Entner–Doudoroff pathway, EMP= Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
  pathway, and PP= pentose phosphate pathway) result in fermentation end-products
  that become the metabolic inputs for other syntrophic microbes, such as acetogens,
  sulfate-reducers and butyrate-producers, or the host.
