caption: Pathway maps of the metabolic profile of mouse liver under conditions of
  food restriction. (A–E) Metabolic pathways involved in the liver metabolites significantly
  altered in aged mice. Heatmap showing the fold-change in the level of each metabolite
  in the liver of aged mice (n = 9) (compared with young mice; n = 14) and hochuekkito
  (HET)-treated aged mice (n = 10) (compared with control aged mice; n = 9). The red
  and blue regions indicate increases and decreases in the metabolite levels, respectively.
