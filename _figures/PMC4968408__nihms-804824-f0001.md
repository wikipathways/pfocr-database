caption: Major cellular events of GPCR signaling and trafficking. (1) Binding of agonist
  ligand to the GPCR initiates signaling by increasing guanine nucleotide exchange
  activity for cognate heterotrimeric G protein, activating the alpha subunit (Gα)
  and releasing the beta-gamma subunit (Gβγ), each of which can transduce signals
  downstream. (2) Many GPCRs are phosphorylated after agonist-induced activation,
  often by members of the GPCR kinase (GRK) family that selectively recognize agonist-occupied
  receptors. (3) Phosphorylated receptors are preferred substrates for association
  with arrestins. (4) Several arrestin isoforms also bind components of endocytic
  lattices (clathrin heavy chain, AP2 alpha subunit and PIP2), promoting agonist-dependent
  clustering of GPCRs in clathrin-coated pits. (5) GPCRs that engage the clathrin-dependent
  endocytic machinery internalize and are delivered to early endosomes, where it is
  thought that ligand dissociation and receptor dephosphorylation events occur, and
  where receptors engage distinct molecular sorting machineries that determine later
  trafficking fate. (6) Receptor sorting to lysosomes results in their proteolytic
  destruction and contributes to a long-term attenuation of cellular responsiveness
  (`down-regulation') that is often observed after prolonged agonist exposure. (7)
  Receptor sorting into a recycling pathway mediates non-destructive return of receptors
  to the plasma membrane. This is thought to support sustained cellular responsiveness,
  or promote functional recovery of cellular responsiveness from a desensitized state
  (`resensitization') after repeated agonist exposure.
