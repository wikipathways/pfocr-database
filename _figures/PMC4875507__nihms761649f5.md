caption: (A) Changes in central carbon metabolism through the cell cycle in wild type
  and storage mutant cells. (B) Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis, comparing wild
  type and storage mutant cells through the cell cycle, identifies pathways with significant
  changes in metabolites. (C) Changes in valine biosynthesis, and (D) amino sugar
  metabolism through the cell cycle in wild type and storage mutant cells. Temporal
  profiles represent mean values of 2 individual biological and 2 technical replicates.
  The corresponding p-values are from a repeated measure corrected ANOVA comparing
  wild type and nth1Δnth2Δgph1Δ storage utilization mutants. (E–G) Fractional labeling
  of metabolites in (E) glycolysis (F) cell wall synthesis, and (G) nucleotides following
  addition of 13C ethanol to the media at 30 minutes after release. The addition of
  13C ethanol resulted in 50 % of the ethanol in the media being labeled (see also
  ).
