caption: Apoptosis pathways in mammalian cells. Apoptosis activation by the extrinsic
  pathway involves the binding of extracellular death ligands (such as TNF ligand/TRAIL)
  to death receptors, provoking the recruitment of adaptor proteins, such as the Fas-associated
  death domain protein (FADD) and recruiting caspase-8. Active caspase-8 then activates
  effector caspase-3 and/or -7. In some situations, extrinsic death signals can crosstalk
  with the intrinsic pathway through caspase-8-mediated proteolysis of BID (BH3-interacting
  domain death agonist). Truncated BID (tBID) can promote mitochondrial cytochrome
  c release and assembly of the apoptosome. In the intrinsic pathway, stresses such
  as radiation or chemotherapeutic agents target mitochondria and induce efflux of
  intermembrane space proteins, such as cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, into the cytosol,
  by the formation of BAK–BAX oligomers on mitochondrial outer membranes. On release
  from mitochondria, cytochrome c can join the apoptosome assembly. Active caspase-9
  then propagates a cascade of further caspase activation events. The inhibitors of
  apoptosis proteins (IAPs) is an important class of intrinsic cellular apoptosis
  inhibitors that function as potent endogenous apoptosis inhibitors by directly binding
  to and effectively inhibiting both initiator caspase-9 and effector caspases -3/-7.
  Smac can neutralize IAP inhibition of caspases thus functions as an endogenous IAP-antagonist.
  Functional blockade of IAPs by Smac results in facilitating caspase activation and
  apoptosis.
