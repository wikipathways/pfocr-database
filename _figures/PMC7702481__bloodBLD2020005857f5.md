caption: Stepwise model for MCD/C5s and PENLs pathogenesis. (1) During normal immune
  responses, SHM or DNA replication errors stochastically introduce off-target founder
  mutations in GCBs, favoring the development of an immature long-lived MB population
  with increased tendency to acquire a GCB-like profile on recall, at the expense
  of terminal PC differentiation. (2) Cyclic reactivation of these MBs over extended
  periods of time favors their clonal expansion and increases the chances of acquiring
  additional off-target mutations. Repeated activation may be driven by a self-reactive
  BCR or chronic exposure to foreign agents and could occur in the context of canonical
  GCs or in a GC-independent manner. (3) Founder or secondary-acquired mutations,
  targeting BCR and TLR pathway mediators, lower the immune activation threshold of
  these MB-like CPCs, driving them into a semipersistent activated state. At this
  stage, cells are predicted to become less dependent on canonical costimulatory signaling.
  (4) Persistent activation in the context of MBs intrinsic phenotypic plasticity
  traps CPCs in a nearly cell-autonomous oscillatory state, navigating between MB-like,
  pre-GC–like, and PB-like phases, whereas somatic mutations block full lineage commitment.
  (5) These CPCs intermittently undergo bursts of proliferation and AID activation,
  allowing the acquisition of ulterior genomic lesions that, paired with transcriptional/epigenetic
  remodeling, enable complete immune evasion and overt tumor development.
