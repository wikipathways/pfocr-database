caption: 'Aspects of CD36 signaling and trafficking that may have potential relevance
  to the regulation of intestinal lipid metabolism. The figure proposes some hypothetical
  working concepts regarding steps that may be involved in the effect of intestinal
  CD36 to facilitate fatty acid (FA) uptake and chylomicron formation. A: CD36 is
  highly expressed on enterocytes of the proximal intestine and localizes to the apical
  side of intestinal villi (, , ) where it interacts with FA released from the digestion
  of dietary triglycerides. While CD36 functions in facilitating uptake of FA by proximal
  enterocytes (, ), it does not contribute quantitatively to FA absorption (, ), since
  it would be rapidly saturated at the levels of monomeric FA present in the lumen.
  However, CD36-mediated FA uptake and associated signaling, operating at the very
  early stages of absorption, may promote intracellular events that facilitate chylomicron
  assembly (, , ). CD36 signaling is in most cases initiated via the CD36-associated
  Src kinases and downstream via the extracellular regulated kinase ERK1/2 (). This
  signaling pathway may be important for phosphorylating proteins required for coordinating
  ER processing of prechylomicron vesicles (PCTV). CD36 has also been identified in
  the protein complex that is required for formation of the PCTV (). B: recent data
  indicate that CD36 signaling may also be mediated by a rise in intracellular calcium.
  Calcium release from the ER promotes membrane CD36 localization, which regulates
  calcium influx via the store-operated calcium channel. The sustained increase in
  intracellular calcium could influence multiple events related to lipid processing
  or secretion (, ). B also illustrates the concept that CD36 is downregulated by
  FA via ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation (), and this feedback loop may work
  to reduce CD36 function in the presence of high concentrations of long-chain fatty
  acids (LCFA) (). In the enterocytes, the LCFA-induced decrease in CD36 associates
  with reduced activation of ERK1/2 which may serve to upregulate MTTP abundance ().'
