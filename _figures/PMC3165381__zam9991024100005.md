caption: Pathway for production and consumption of PHB in M. parvus OBBP. The pathways
  are based primarily on the work of Lidstrom () and Hanson and Hanson (), and all
  references are included in italics on the figure. An asterisk indicates that the
  results of this work support the proposed step in the pathway. The conversion of
  acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-coA) to glyoxylate is shown as a dotted line because it
  was not observed under conditions of the present study. Note that PHB is used as
  a source of reducing power upon entering the TCA cycle.
