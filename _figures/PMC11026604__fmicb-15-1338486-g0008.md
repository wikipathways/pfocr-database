caption: Schematic models of hydrogen flow through relevant central metabolic pathways
  (CMPs), corresponding isotopic fractionations, and relative 2H-enrichment of leucine
  and valine upon growth of microbes on different carbon substrates. Reactions potentially
  having a strong influence on the hydrogen isotope compositions of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA,
  and thus on the amino acids investigated in this study, are highlighted. Arrow widths
  indicate flux magnitudes estimated based on 13C-based metabolic flux maps reported
  in Gerosa et al. (2015). Dashed lines summarize a series of reactions not shown.
  Filled circles in the TCA cycle metabolites trace the methyl group of acetyl-CoA
  through succinyl-CoA. Open circles trace the methyl group of acetyl-CoA into malate
  and through citrate via the glyoxylate shunt (acetate metabolism) and the methylene
  group of oxaloacetate into citrate (succinate metabolism). The asterisk traces the
  alcohol carbon position in isocitrate to oxaloacetate via the glyoxylate shunt (acetate
  metabolism). The color gradient representing the relative 2H-enrichments or 2H-depletions
  of hydrogen within biomolecules is shown as an inset in the “Pyruvate metabolism”
  box. Isotope effects (KIEs and solvent IEs) shown are reported from Rétey et al.
  (1970), Lenz et al. (1971), Meloche (1975), O'Leary (1989), and Bollenbach et al.
