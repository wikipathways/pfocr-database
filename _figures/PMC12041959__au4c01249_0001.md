caption: Metabolic pathway of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) conversion to
  DOPEGAL and DOPAL by monoamine oxidase (MAO). These molecules are further processed
  by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and aldehyde reductase (AR) to nontoxic dihydroxyphenylglycol
  (DHPG) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). Dysregulation of ALDH and AR
  leads to accumulation of DOPEGAL and DOPAL, which can form covalent cross-links
  with biological nucleophiles leading to disease states
