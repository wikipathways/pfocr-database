caption: Mitochondrial iron co-factor biosynthetic pathways are reliant on FXN iron
  chaperone function. (A) Heme biosynthesis. The final step is ferrochelatase (FECH)-mediated
  Fe2+ insertion into protoporphyrin IX. FXN-Fe2+ serves as the iron source for this
  heme maturation process. (B) The mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) biosynthetic
  pathway is depicted. The ISC scaffold includes NFS1, ISD11, and ISCU dimers. Delivery
  of the Fe2+ by FXN follows sulfur addition by cysteine desulferase (not shown).
  The final step of the formation before release of ISCU containing ISC centers for
  addition into an apo-enzyme. Protein structure provided through The Protein Data
  Bank (; ).
