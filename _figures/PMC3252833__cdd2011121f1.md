caption: Fas-induced apoptotic signalling pathway. Whereas in the so-called type 1
  cells (e.g. thymocytes, resting T lymphocytes), activation of Fas rapidly proceeds
  from caspase-8 activation to effector caspases (-3 and -7) activation and cell demolition,
  this direct pathway is relatively ineffective in type 2 cells (e.g. hepatocytes,
  pancreatic β-cells). In the latter, Fas-induced apoptosis requires caspase-8-mediated
  proteolytic processing of Bid into tBid, which transmits the apoptotic signal to
  the Bcl-2-regulated apoptotic pathway, activating Bax/Bak, thereby triggering MOMP
  with release of apoptogenic proteins. These include cytochrome c, required for apoptosome
  formation and caspase-9 activation, as well as Smac/DIABLO, an antagonist of XIAP.
  XIAP is a potent inhibitor of active effector caspases, and thus constitutes an
  important attenuator of Fas-induced apoptosis signalling in type 2 cells
