caption: 'Immune cells interacted with jaw stem cells by signaling pathways. (A) TGF-β
  signaling pathway: The immune cell-derived IL-4 can activate ligands of TGF-β signaling
  pathway, and macrophages can directly produce ligands to activate this pathway.
  (B) Hedgehog signaling pathway: Immune cells can upregulate Ihh and Shh via the
  TL1A/TNFR2 axis and secreting TNF-α, while CD168+ macrophages can directly express
  ligands of the Hh signaling pathway. (C) Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway: Both T
  cells and macrophages can produce ligands for this pathway. (D) Piezo1 signaling
  pathway: Under mechanical load, the pathway is activated and can promote the expression
  of ligands of the wnt signaling pathway. Immune cells triggers the activation of
  these four signaling pathways, which subsequently enhance the expression of osteogenic
  factors and facilitate the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs through intracellular
  signal transduction'
