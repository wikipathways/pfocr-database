caption: A model illustrating the possible mechanisms by which NKCC1 influences SBI
  by phosphorylation of NF-κB. After SBI, microglia cells are activated, p-NKCC1 expression
  rapidly increases, and NF-κB in the nucleus is phosphorylated. The increase in p-NF-κB
  expression triggers the release of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α inflammatory factors,
  which leads to neuroinflammation, damages the BBB, ultimately leading to brain edema
  and nerve function injury.
