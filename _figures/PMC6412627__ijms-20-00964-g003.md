caption: The regulation of the expression and cleavage of sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and the transcriptional activation of the acyl-CoA:glycerol-sn-3-phosphate
  acyltransferase1 (GPAT1) gene. A heterodimer consisting of the liver X receptor
  (LXR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) binds to the SREBP-1c precursor gene promotor
  region at the LXR response element for transcriptional activation. The SREBP-1c
  precursor resides at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with the SREBP cleavage-activating
  protein (SCAP) and insulin-induced gene (INSIG) proteins. The complex, consisting
  of the SCAP and the SREBP-1c precursor, translocates to the Golgi, where the SREBP-1c
  precursor undergoes proteolytic cleavage. This translocation is involved in the
  mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-mediated indirect activation
  of protein kinase B (Akt), a downstream kinase of insulin signaling. In addition,
  Akt decreases INSIG2 mRNA and translocates the SCAP-SREBP-1c precursor complex from
  the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. The mature SREBP-1c translocates into the
  nucleus, where this transcriptional factor binds to the sterol regulatory element
  (SRE) response element to activate the transcription of the lipogenic genes, including
  GPAT1. The metabolic products in GPAT1-mediated triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis,
  including phosphatidic acid (PA) and diacylglycerol (DAG), reduce the insulin pathway,
  suggesting that GPAT1 is involved in insulin resistance (see below).
