caption: Drug addiction, obesity, and binge eating disorder (BED) have a significant
  degree of overlap in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway. (A) Both natural and
  drug rewards exert their mechanisms of effect in the ventral tegmental area (VTA)
  to augment activity of GABAergic and DA neurons. The VTA receives GABAergic input
  from D1-medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which have iGlu and group I metabotropic glutamate
  (mGlu) receptors located on the terminal. The VTA also receives Glu inputs from
  the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) as well
  as cholinergic input from the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPn) and mesopontine laterodorsal
  tegmental nucleus (LDTn). (B) MSNs within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) receive DA
  input from the VTA, Glu input from the PFC, thalamus, amgydala, and hippocampus
  (HPC), as well as GABA input from the ventral pallidum (VP). MSNs also receive cholinergic
  modulation via NAc cholinergic interneurons. (C) GABAergic neurons in the VP receive
  input from both D1- and D2-MSNs, DA input from the VTA, and cholinergic modulation
  from cholinergic interneurons.
