caption: Illustration of the NF-κB pathway. The NF-κB1 transcriptional factor (p50
  and its precursor p105) is active upon dimerization (p50:p65) in the cytosol. At
  rest, NF-κB dimers are bound to inhibitory IκB proteins. After activation (here
  via PRR signaling), IκB proteins are phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex,
  which releases the NF-κB dimers. p65-containing heterodimers can then translocate
  into the nucleus and regulate gene expression. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations
  in NFKB1 are associated with reduced protein levels of the p105 and/or p50 subunit
  and lead to the development of a complex immunodeficiency
