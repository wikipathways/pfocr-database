caption: Binding of a Hh ligand to Patched (PTCH) de-represses SMO, causing activation
  and translocation to the nucleus of GLI2, which initiates the transcription of target
  genes including PTCH and GLI1. Cyclopamine, its derivative, IPI-926, and its mimics
  GDC-0449 and NVP-LDE225 all bind competitively to a site within the transmembrane
  portion of SMO; the SMO missense mutations indicated by yellow asterisks decrease
  binding and confer resistance to these drugs. Itraconazole inhibits SMO by a distinct
  mechanism and ATO inhibits the pathway at the level of GLI.
