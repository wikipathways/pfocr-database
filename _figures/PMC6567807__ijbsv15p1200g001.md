caption: Curcumin modulates cancer progression by controlling diverse signal transduction
  pathways. Attachment of ligands (e.g., growth factors and cytokines) to their corresponding
  receptors induces the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt,
  JAK/STAT, and MAPK pathways. These pathways play an important role in cell survival,
  proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. Curcumin can orchestrate
  these three pathways and thus serves a pivotal role in cancer progression. Akt activation
  restrains the p53 signaling and Bad-mediated apoptotic pathway contributing to cancer
  cell survival. Akt also initiates the NF-ĸB signaling pathway. NF-ĸB favors the
  expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, thereby leading to the inhibition
  of cancer cell apoptosis. Curcumin acts as an inhibitor of NF-ĸB and functions in
  activating the caspase cascade. Therefore, curcumin facilitates cancer cell apoptosis.
  Wnt binds to Frizzled receptor to trigger the canonical Wnt pathway. In the absence
  of Wnt signaling, GSK3-β induces the phosphorylation of β-catenin and results in
  its degradation. Wnt binding to its receptor can inhibit the activation of GSK3-β,
  thus allowing stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. Accumulated
  β-catenin eventually translocates into the nucleus and induces the expression of
  multiple oncogenes and EMT-inducing transcription factors. Curcumin is capable of
  repressing the EMT process in cancer cells through inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling. FasL, Fas ligand; Bid, BH3-interacting domain death agonist; tBid, truncated
