caption: Notch implication during the early fetal stages of ILC commitment and differentiation.
  Notch signaling is differentially implicated in the development of the diverse subsets
  of fetal liver precursors. The common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) expresses the Notch1
  receptor and CLPs could further differentiate into lymphoid precursors expressing
  the α4β7 integrin at the surface (1). Named α-lymphoid precursors (αLP), the α4β7-expressing
  cells comprise a mix of lymphoid precursors differentially committed. Thanks to
  the use of RBP-Jk deficient embryos, this first developmental step was shown to
  be Notch-independent and to coincide with the loss of B cell potential. Among αLP,
  Flt3+ cells maintain Notch1 expression and their T cell potential. For T cell development
  to occur, a constant Notch signal is needed. The constant Notch activation limits
  any other possible fate as the constitutive NICD expression restrains the Id2 expression
  and drives αLPs toward T cell development. Flt3- αLP precursors are Notch2+ cells,
  heterogeneously composed of primed ILC precursors dedicated to ILC1, ILC2, ILC3
  and LTi cell lineages. The developmental step (2) concurs with the acquisition of
  Id2 expression and the loss of T cell potential. This step was demonstrated to be
  independent from the activation of the Notch pathway. While ILCPs acquire Zbtb16
  expression (3), LTiPs are separated as precursors expressing Tcf7 independently
  from the Notch signaling pathway (3′). During the priming of ILCPs, only the fraction
  enriched in ILC2Ps is found sensitive to the abrogation of the Notch pathway. Hence,
  Notch signaling has a primordial role in enhancing the proliferation of ILC2Ps.
  Moreover, it was determined that Notch signaling in that context was probably intermittent
  but not constant. The commitment of ILCPs toward ILC1P and ILC3P branches is similar
  after the blockade of Notch signaling. The figure was created using BioRender.com.
