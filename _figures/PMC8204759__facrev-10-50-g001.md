caption: Shown are components of the TORC1 pathway located at the Golgi. All of the
  components are located at the trans-Golgi network. Some components are also located
  at the cis-Golgi, as indicated. The components that have been reported to regulate
  mTORC1 activity at the Golgi are indicated by solid lines, whereas other components
  that activate mTORC1 at a location yet to be defined are indicated by broken lines.
  The mechanisms by which the Golgi components regulate mTORC1 remain poorly understood.
