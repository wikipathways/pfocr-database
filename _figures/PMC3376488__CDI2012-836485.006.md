caption: TRIF signal pathway. In TLR1-TLR13, TRIF is the sole adaptor of TLR3 and
  also an adjunct adaptor of TLR4. Here, the TLR3-TRIF signal is illustrated as an
  example of TRIF pathway. dsRNA that is internalized in endosome binds to TLR3, which
  possesses two dsRNA binding sites near the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively.
  When combined with dsRNA, a sole dsRNA molecule associates two TLR3 molecules through
  four dsRNA binding sites in an “m” shape. TLR3 TIR domain combines with the TIR
  domain of TRIF. The interaction of TRIF with RIP1 or TRAF6 and Peli1 results in
  polyubiquitination of RIP1, the latter binds ubiquitin receptors TAB2 and TAB3 which
  activates TAK1. Activated TAK1 induces phosphorylation of IKK complex composed of
  IKKα and IKKβ and NEMO. This results in the degradation of IκB which ultimately
  causes the nuclear translocation of NF-κB to activate the specific gene promoter
  A20. TAK1 also interacts with JNK and p38 to activate c-JUN and ATF2. This results
  in the activation of the AP-1 transcription factors family. TRIF also activates
  TBK1 and IKKε through NAP1 inducing phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
  IRF3 culminating in IFN-β production. TRAF3 binds with the TBK1/IKKε complex inducing
  IRF3 activation. Combination of TRIF results in phosphorylation of Tyr759 and Tyr858
  in the TLR3 TIR domain which subsequently induces the phosphorylation and degradation
  of IκB leading to NF-κB release. Phosphorylated Tyr759 recruits PI3K and phosphorylates
  kinase Akt and activates nucleic IRF3. Tyrosine kinase c-Src also plays a role in
  Akt activation. The unique signaling of TRIF is that it interacts with FADD through
  RIP1 and activates procaspase-8 to initiate cell apoptosis.
