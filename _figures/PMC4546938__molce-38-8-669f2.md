caption: Posttranslational modifications involved in the activation of FANCD2. (A)
  The FA core complex consists of three modules plus a lesion recognition unit, FANCM.
  Recognition of a DNA ICL by the FANCM-FAAP24-MHF complex activates ATR checkpoint
  signaling. (B) ATR and its effector CHK1 phosphorylate components of the FA core
  complex and the FANCD2-FANCI complex to control their activities. (C) The FANCB-FANCL-FAAP100
  module constitutes a minimal catalytic core to monoubiquitinate FANCD2. FANCI phosphorylation
  potentiates FANCD2 activation. (D) ‘SUMO spray’ of FANC proteins may ensure balanced
  protein dosage required for the functional integrity of the FA pathway during DNA
  repair. For instance, FANCA and FANCD2 undergo controlled degradation by the integrated
  SUMO-ubiquitin signaling.
