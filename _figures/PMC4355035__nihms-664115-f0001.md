caption: Carboxyl methylation of L-isoaspartyl residues in proteins is catalysed by
  PIMT using SAM (methyl donor) to form an L-isoaspartyl-O-methylester and SAH. SAH
  hydrolysis to homocysteine and adenosine is catalysed by SAH hydrolase (SAHH), and
  can be inhibited by tubercidin. Re-methylation of homocysteine to methionine is
  provided by either vitamin B12 dependent methionine synthase (MS) activity or from
  the activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) using betaine. The
  conversion of methionine to SAM by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) utilizing
  ATP completes this cyclic part of the methionine metabolic pathway.
