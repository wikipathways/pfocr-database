caption: 'Schematic diagram of anti-metastatic mechanisms of herbal medicine in lung
  cancer: Herbal medicine can suppress angiogenesis, metastasis and proliferation
  by inactivating sequential cascades below such as epithelial mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) and matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs). Vascular endothelial growth factor A
  (VEGFA) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling activate the downstream pathways
  such as phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src and protein
  kinase B (AKT). Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) can also activate
  AKT, which generally begins from phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). This activates
  nuclear factor kappa B cells (NF-κB) affecting MMPs and EMT processes, which are
  the basic steps for metastasis. In the process of EMT, Snail activates zinc finger
  E-box-binding homeobox-1 (ZEB-1), vimentin, N-cadherin, while down-regulating epithelial
  cadherin (E-cadherin). On the other hand, ERK/p38/MAPK pathway which is activated
  from various factors such as C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), cluster of
  differentiation 31 (CD31), electron transport chain (ETC), also induces MMPs. Furthermore,
  natural antioxidants can affect reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cascades,
  promoting apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and some metastatic changes. As a reaction
  to DNA damage from oxidative stress, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is cleaved
  and regulates the stability of p53. DNA damage by ROS also mediates ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM)/ATM and Rad3-related (ATR)-p53 signaling pathway. P53 affects B-cell
  lymphoma (Bcl) and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) which leads to caspase 3/9 cleavage
  for apoptosis. Additionally, p53 activates p21 expression which is highly related
  to cell cycle arrest, especially G1 phase. P53/miR34a axis is proposed to induce
  cell cycle arrest and suppress some of the EMT process. Herbal medicine can also
  stimulate T cell apoptosis and suppress Tregs immune function by inhibiting indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase
  (IDO) expression. Abbreviation: ACEE, Antrodia cinnamomea ethanol extract; EBGF,
