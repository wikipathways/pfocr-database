caption: Common regulatory networks of 3′ UTR-derived sRNAs. (A) In V. cholerae, the
  transcription factor FadR activates the expression of FarS and its parental mRNA
  fabB, of which the latter is involved in fatty acid synthesis. Simultaneously, FadR
  and FarS repress fadE expression that is part of the opposing β-oxidation pathway
  for fatty acids. Thus, this mixed feed-forward loop enables an efficient fatty acid
  metabolism. (B)The autoregulatory sRNA OppZ ensures a proper balance of the different
  proteins of the Opp peptide uptake system in V. cholerae. Through causing premature
  transcription termination of its parental mRNA, for all but the peptide-binding
  protein OppA, OppZ limits expression of oppBCDF as well as itself. (C) Mixed feed-forward
  loops can also be involved in the regulation of stress. As exemplified by the CpxR-dependent
  protein CpxP and sRNA CpxQ of the Enterobacteriales. Through translational inhibtion
  of diverse IMPs, CpxQ reduces the CpxR-mediated transcription of CpxP as well as
  the sRNA itself. Both components of the Cpx pathway ensure a reduction of misfolded
  IMPs and thus alleviate IM stress.
