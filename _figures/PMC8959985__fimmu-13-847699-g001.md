caption: Bcl-3 regulates atypical NF-κB signaling pathways. Bcl-3 acts as a regulator
  of the atypical NF-κB pathway by binding to processed p50 and p52 homodimers to
  repress or activate a subset of NF-κB regulated genes. In terms of transcriptional
  inhibition, Bcl-3 delays the turnover of DNA binding inhibitory p50 homodimer by
  inhibiting the ubiquitination of p50 homodimer and subsequent proteasome hydrolysis,
  so as to produce a stable DNA binding complex and inhibit transcription. In addition,
  the recruitment of co-repressors such as CtBP and HDAC3 may be another mechanism
  by which Bcl-3 inhibits transcription of NF-κB target genes. In terms of transcriptional
  activation, Bcl-3 removes repressive p50 homodimers from NF-κB sites, allowing NF-κB
  heterodimers associated with classical signaling (p65/p50) to activate transcription
  at these sites. Bcl-3 can also directly transactivate NF-κB-dependent transcription
  with N-terminal and C-terminal domains by binding to p50 and p52 homodimers. Although
  Bcl-3 can directly interact with p52 homodimers, the mechanism of Bcl-3 regulating
  p52 homodimer activation still remains unclear and we speculate that it follows
  a similar mechanism to that of the p50 homodimers.
