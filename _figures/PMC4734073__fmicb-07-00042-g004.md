caption: 'Strategies evolved by Staphylococcus aureus to counteract innate immune
  response. (A) Secreted bacterial factors that inhibit neutrophils extravasation,
  chemotaxis and activation. Neutrophil rolling is modulated by staphylococcal superantigen-like
  5 (SSL5) that binds P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), blocking its interaction
  with P-selectin. The adhesion of neutrophils to the endothelium and consequent transmigration
  is inhibited by extracellular adherence protein (Eap), which binds to intercellular
  adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). In addition to inhibiting PSGL-1, SSL5 inhibits neutrophil
  responses to chemokines and to anaphylatoxins, by binding to different chemokine
  receptors. Several staphylococcal molecules impair neutrophil chemotaxis and important
  co-signaling events during migration and phagocytosis: chemotaxis-inhibitor protein
  of S. aureus (CHIPS) binds and inhibits formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) and C5a
  receptor (C5aR); formyl peptide receptor-like 1 inhibitor (FLIPr)-like inhibit FPR1;
  FLIPr and FLIPr-like inhibit FPR2; staphopain (ScpA) cleaves Chemokine (C–X–C Motif)
  Receptor 2 (CXCR2); staphylococcal SSL3 inhibits toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated
  signaling, the bicomponent leukocidins Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), gamma-hemolysin
  (Hlg) ABC, leukocidin (Luk) FM, Luk GH/AB, and Luk DE interact with chemoattractant
  receptors of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Both Hla and Luk GH/AB
  induce cell lysis by binding ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10) and CD11b,
  respectively. The cytolytic peptides phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) have an amphipathic
  alpha-helical region that likely contributes to their lytic activity, presumably
  by membrane insertion and pore formation. (B) Secreted bacterial factors that inhibit
  opsonization and phagocytosis by neutrophils. The secreted metalloprotease aureolysin
  inhibits phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by neutrophils by cleaving C3. Staphylococcal
  complement inhibitor (SCIN), SCIN-B, and SCIN-C associate with and inhibits C3 convertase,
  thereby preventing the production of C3a, C3b, and further C5a and consequently
  interfering with complement activation. The extracellular fibrinogen binding protein
  (EFB) and the extracellular complement-binding protein (ECB) also inhibit complement
  activation by inactivating C5 convertase and staphylococcal SSL7 targets C5. Staphylococcal
  binder of immunoglobulin (SBI) affect both the function of complement and immunoglobulin
  binding, blocking the classical complement activation pathway, and associates with
  C3 inhibiting the alternative pathway. Staphylokinase (SAK) forms enzymatically
  active complexes with C3b blocking complement activation. Staphylococcal SSL10 binds
  IgG, affecting Fc receptor (FcR) recognition and complement activation.'
