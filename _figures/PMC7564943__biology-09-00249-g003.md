caption: AhR activation contributes to alterations in mitochondrial metabolism as
  does suppressed pineal melatonin. By increasing CYP1B1 and suppressing 14-3-3, AhR
  activation lowers mitochondrial and cytoplasmic melatonin, thereby decreasing sirtuins
  and superoxide dismutase (SOD)2, contributing to suboptimal mitochondrial function.
  The decrease in circadian pineal melatonin in the aged, as well as from increased
  cytokines and gut permeability, lowers Bmal1 induction, which is crucial to upregulating
  pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and its conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.
  Acetyl-CoA is a necessary co-substrate of AANAT and therefore for the initiation
  of the melatonergic pathway. The release of melatonin by cells of the ‘cytokine
  storm’ is necessary for their switch to a quiescent/phagocytic phenotype and this
  seem co-ordinated with SPMs induction. Acetyl-CoA is necessary for optimized oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle ATP production. Acetyl-CoA
  also inhibits the COX2/PGE2/EP4 pathway that underpins exhaustion and is necessary
  for the increase in glycolysis that is required for anti-viral cells to become activated.
  The AhR and pineal melatonin act to regulate immune cell metabolism, activity and
  response to viral infection.
