caption: The process of apoptosis. There exist two distinct pathways that can result
  in apoptosis, namely the intrinsic pathway (also known as the mitochondrial pathway)
  and the extrinsic pathway (also known as the death receptor pathway). Despite their
  differences, these pathways can converge and trigger apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway
  is activated by various cytotoxic agents, growth factors, or nutrient deficiencies,
  leading to an increase in the expression of BH3-only proteins that exhibit a strong
  affinity for BCL2, a pro-survival protein that plays a role in anti-apoptosis. The
  interaction between NH3-only proteins and BCL-2 results in the release of BAX and
  BAK, which subsequently oligomerize and assemble into structures that breach the
  outer membrane of mitochondria, leading to MOMP and the release of cytochrome C
  into the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic cytochrome C then binds to APF1, promoting apoptosome
  formation and inducing apoptosis. This process recruits the precursor of apoptosis
  initiator pro-caspase9 to the apoptosome, where it is cleaved and becomes bioactive
  caspase 9. Apoptosis may be induced by TNF/FASL through binding to TNFR/FAS, which
  leads to the activation of pro-caspase8 to caspase8 via FADD or TRADD. The resulting
  bioactive caspase8 can directly proteolyze effector caspase3/7. In addition to its
  direct role in apoptosis, caspase8 can also induce apoptosis indirectly. Specifically,
  caspase8 activates Bid, which is then transformed into tBID and, in conjunction
  with the intrinsic pathway, initiates apoptosis.
