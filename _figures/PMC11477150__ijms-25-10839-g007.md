caption: A schematic representation of the PTN/PTPRZ1 signaling pathway that includes
  ανβ3 integrin and leads to cMet and mTORC1 activation and enhanced protein synthesis.
  (A) PTN binds to PTPRZ1 and leads to cMet activation, as previously shown [3]. PTPRZ1
  deletion is also known to lead to cMet activation [3]. cMet activates mTORC1, which
  results in enhanced protein synthesis and cell migration. (B) LM609 and PTN112–136
  bind to ανβ3 integrin and activate cMet, mTORC1, and protein synthesis. The arrows
  signify up-regulation
