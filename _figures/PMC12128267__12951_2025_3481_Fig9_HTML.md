caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of gastrointestinal exposure
  to SiO2 NPs induced AD-like neurotoxicity. A Gastrointestinal exposure of mice to
  SiO2 NPs B induces intestinal pathological changes and inflammatory reactions, disrupting
  the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota and metabolite SCFAs, C damages the gut-brain
  barrier integrity, D activates neuroinflammation signaling pathway of TLR4/NF-κB
  p65, and interferes with HDAC3, HDAC1/OGG1 signaling pathways, and with the synaptic
  function in the brain, E causes AD-like neurotoxicity including cognitive impairment,
  neuroinflammation, basement membrane lysis, neuronal damage, and Aβ accumulation.
