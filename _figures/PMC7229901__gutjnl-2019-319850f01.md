caption: Mechanisms of Treg-mediated suppression. Tregs use a multitude of mechanisms
  to promote a tolerogenic microenvironment and tissue repair. (A) Secretion of the
  anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10, TGF-β and IL-35, not only inhibit Teff proliferation
  but also suppress Th1 and Th17 effector function, both of which are key mediators
  of IBD. (B) Tregs express the high-affinity IL-2 receptor α-chain (CD25) consuming
  local IL-2 with greater affinity than effector cells. Teffs which are ‘starved’
  of IL-2 exhibit restricted proliferation and undergo apoptosis. (C) Tregs coexpressing
  CD39 and CD73 disrupt metabolic processes in effector cells by converting ATP into
  pericellular adenosine, a potent inhibitor of Teff function. Additionally, adenosine
  stimulates TGF-β production, promoting development of pTregs. (D) Tregs are capable
  of secreting perforin, granzyme B and galectin-1 which are directly cytotoxic against
  Teffs. Activated Tregs also express TRAIL, inducing apoptosis of Teffs through the
  TRAIL/DR5 pathway. (E) Expression of CTLA-4 degrades DC-derived CD80 and CD86 leading
  to impaired CD28-mediated costimulation of T cells. DC function is further inhibited
  through the interaction of Treg-derived TIGIT and CD155 on DCs. This induces IL-10
  production and suppresses IL-12. (F) In response to alarmins, Tregs produce AREG,
  an important regulator of tissue repair and regeneration. AREG, amphiregulin; CTLA-4,
