caption: The native pheromone-induced GPCR signalling pathways of wild-type and engineered
  yeast S. cerevisiae. (A) The native pheromone-induced signalling pathway mediated
  by yeast GPCRs, Ste2 and Ste3, in wild-type yeast S. cerevisiae. In the native pathway,
  the GPCR ligand, α- or a-factor, is bound by Ste2 or Ste3, respectively. This leads
  to exchange of GDP to GTP on the Gα subunit, Gpa1, of the heterotrimeric G protein,
  and subsequently dissociation of the Gβ:Gγ dimer, Ste4 and Ste18, from the Gα subunit.
  Release of Ste4:Ste18 dimer activates an MAP-kinase cascade, targeting the transcription
  factor Ste12 for phosphorylation, and subsequently translocation to the nucleus
  and induction of pheromone-responsive genes required for yeast mating. (B) An engineered
  signalling pathway in yeast expressing a heterologous GPCR (Het. GPCR). In this
  pathway, all major engineering hotspots of the signalling pathway are numbered and
  engineering strategy listed. Importantly, when expressing heterologous GPCRs in
  yeast, the native GPCRs Ste2, Ste3 and Gpr1 are usually deleted to avoid signalling
  crosstalk. Ultimately, activation of the engineered core pheromone pathway using
  coupled heterologous GPCRs activates reporter genes most often encoding gene products
  for growth on selective media or fluorescence read-outs.
