caption: tRNAs play a protective role in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. An internal
  stimulus, e.g., DNA damage or viral infection, causes the loss of mitochondrial
  membrane potential and leads to a release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) to the cytoplasm.
  Cytosolic Cyt c binds to the death adaptor apoptotic protease-activating factor-1
  (Apaf-1) and ATP, triggering assembly of the oligomeric apoptosome complex, which
  recruits procaspase-9, leading to its activation. Caspase-9 activates effector caspases,
  e.g., caspase-3/7, and eventually leads to cell death. In this pathway, tRNAs directly
  bind to Cyt c and prevent Cyt c association with Apaf-1 and apoptosis.
