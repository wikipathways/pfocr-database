caption: 'Cellular pathways that mediate apoptosis. A family of death receptors can
  initiate apoptosis, and their relative importance depends on the cell type. Two
  major pathways are shown here: the Fas receptor pathway and the receptor-independent
  mitochondrial pathway. The various membrane receptors share some components of the
  signaling pathways shown. DcR3 is unique, however, as it is a truncated receptor
  that does not signal. The soluble form of DcR3 functions as a decoy receptor that
  blocks receptor/ligand-mediated apoptosis.'
