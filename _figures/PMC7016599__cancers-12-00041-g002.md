caption: Some of the signaling pathways regulated by integrin α6β4 in colorectal cancer
  cells. First is the cooperation between receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), which via
  Src family of kinases (SFK) trigger phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of
  β4 to activate the ERK and PI3K signaling pathways, which in turn regulate various
  cellular functions such as migration, proliferation and survival by the modulation
  of specific transcription factors (TFs) and activation of the Rho-GTPases. Second
  are the regulatory effects of the α6 subunit on cell proliferation where α6A promotes
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the expression of downstream effectors such as MYC
  while α6B appears to inhibit MYC activity by a possible interaction with the protein
  bridging integrator 1 (Bin1). MYC appears also as one key regulator of integrin
  expression since both ITGB4 and ITGA6 have MYC-responsive elements in their promoters
  as for ESPR1 that encodes a splicing factor that regulate ITGA6A expression. Adapted
  from [,,,].
