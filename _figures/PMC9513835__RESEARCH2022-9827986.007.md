caption: 'A schematic summary of the molecular mechanisms of two spawning habits for
  the adaptive radiation of endemic East Asian cyprinids. (a) The mechanisms underlying
  the hydration of semibuoyant eggs. ① Three pathways of yolk protein degradation.
  (i) Vtg degradation pathway, (ii) zinc metalloproteinase pathway, and (iii) ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. ② The pathways of Ca2+ and Mg2+ active transport. ③ The molecular structure
  of the egg envelope permeability transition pore. Proteins in red and blue show
  significant upregulation and downregulation in semibuoyant eggs, respectively. (b)
  The mechanisms underlying adhesiveness formation of adhesive eggs. ① The crosslinks
  of microfilament-associated proteins and adhesive-related proteins. ② The hardening
  of the egg envelope. Proteins in red show significant upregulation in adhesive eggs.
  Details are shown in Tables  and . ③ The biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
  in the ovary, including the biosynthesis of immediate precursors of GAG determined
  by proteomics analysis (details are shown in Table  and Figure ) and the synthesis
  and modification of heparan sulphate (HS) and chondroitin/dermatan sulphates (CS/DS)
  by transcriptomics analysis (details are shown in Table  and ). EE: egg envelope;
  PVS: perivitelline space; Yp: yolk protein; FAA: free amino acids; Vtg: vitellogenin;
  Ub: ubiquitin; CaC: Ca2+ channel; CA: cortical alveoli; PM: plasma membrane; AL:
  adhesive layer.'
