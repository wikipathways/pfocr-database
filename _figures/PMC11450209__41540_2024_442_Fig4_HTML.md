caption: The Pathways tab displays interactions from a selected pathway from KEGG
  database. The Domains tab displays interactions of proteins that share a selected
  domain. If the selected protein sets do not include kinases, expanding the network
  to include adjacent proteins can reveal regulatory interactions. a The folate biosynthesis
  pathway. This network, selected in the Pathways tab, shows a number of metabolic
  enzymes and no kinase-substrate interactions. b The expanded view reveals regulatory
  interactions such as phosphorylation of SPR by CAMK2 kinases. c Proteins with the
  histone deacetylase domain. This network, selected in the Domains tab contains multiple
  HDAC proteins and no kinases. d The expanded view reveals the wide range of kinases
  that phosphorylate HDACs, as well as other interactions
