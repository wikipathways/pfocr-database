caption: Unfolded protein response and cell survival or death. (a) PERK provides cancer
  cell survival. PERK can activate ATF4, which upregulates the genes with roles in
  antioxidant response for survival. Moreover, PERK can stimulate Nrf2 to inactivate
  cell death signaling, CHOP, and phosphorylated elF2α to attenuate translation for
  survival. Another transmembrane protein of the UPR membrane, IRE-1, and ATF6 also
  have crucial roles in cancer cell survival. Under the moderate level of ER stress,
  activated IRE-1 removes the introns of inactivated XBP1 to form spliced XBP1 (XBP1s).
  XBP1s serves as a transcription factor and binds with the promoter of chaperone
  and ERAD genes for modifying or degrading misfolded proteins for cell survival.
  Besides, ATF6 translocates from the ER membrane to the Golgi body. After moving
  to the Golgi body, ATF6 is cleaved to release the transcription factor (active segment)
  that induces the expression of chaperones and ERAD []; (b) When cells are overloaded
  with misfolded proteins, three transmembrane proteins of UPR are inclined to trigger
  cell death signals. Activated PERK phosphorylates elF2 to block protein synthesis.
  Furthermore, inactive elF2 will induce ATF4, a transcription factor that promotes
  Noxa and CHOP (both are pro-apoptotic transcription factors). Then, CHOP stimulates
  Bim, a pro-apoptotic protein of Bcl-2 families, and directly activates Bax and Bak
  on the membrane of mitochondria to trigger apoptosis. Furthermore, once IRE-1 is
  phosphorylated by extensive UPR, it will recruit TRAF 2 and activate apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase 1 (ASK1) to phosphorylate JNK. Activated JNK can inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins,
  such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL, to trigger cell death signaling. Another pathway, cleaved
  ATF6, also induces CHOP expression and leads to apoptosis.
