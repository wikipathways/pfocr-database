caption: Glycolysis and the PPP provide biosynthetic intermediates and reducing power
  for cell growth and proliferation. In immune cells, select branches provide key
  metabolites for immune function such as reducing power for the synthesis of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants in phagocytic cells and for phospholipid synthesis
  in dendritic cells. In contrast, suppression of PPP by carbohydrate kinase-like
  protein (CARKL) induces an anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype. Hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway provides substrates for glycosylation of lipids and proteins
  important for Treg and M2 macrophage lineages. In rapidly proliferating cells such
  as T cells and M1 macrophages, glycolysis-derived pyruvate is reduced to lactate
  to regenerate NAD+ and exported out of the cell. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate;
  GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; MCT1, monocarboxylate transporter 1; PDH, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; PDK1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate;
