caption: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling as a critical regulator
  of desmosomes (created with biorender.com). (Upper panel) Modification of desmosomes
  by EGFR signaling. Binding of EGF family growth factors to their receptors activates
  the canonical RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling pathway. Several kinases of the pathway can
  phosphorylate desmosomal cadherins and PKPs, thereby affecting their stability as
  well as their localization at the cell membrane. At the same time, EGFR signaling
  alleviates transcription of desmosomal genes and promotes cell cycle gene expression
  thereby controlling the balance between proliferation, differentiation and cell-cell
  adhesion. (Lower panel) Impact of desmosomal proteins on EGFR signaling. The desmosomal
  cadherins DSG1-3 and DSC2 as well as PKP2 co-localize or interact with the EGFR
  at the cell membrane, thereby either activating or inhibiting RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling.
  DSC1/3 and PKP3 affect RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling probably without interfering directly
  with the EGFR.
