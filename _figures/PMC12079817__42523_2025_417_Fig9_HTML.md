caption: The network summary of microbial-metabolite association. Colored squares
  represent metabolic pathways. Diamonds and circles depict metabolites and microbes,
  respectively, that have shown significant differences in abundance. Nodes frames
  are colored red and blue to indicate up-regulation and down-regulation, respectively.
  Connections between nodes are illustrated with lines, where red and blue lines represent
  positive and negative correlations, respectively. Darker shades of red and blue
  lines denote correlations that are significantly strong
