caption: Opposing effects of PPAR gamma and canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling in
  gliomas. Circadian rhythms disorders are observed in Gliomas, with decreasing of
  Per and increasing of Bmal1 and Clock. Overexpression of Bmal1 induces activation
  of WNT pathway. Upregulation of canonical WNT and downregulation of PPAR gamma are
  observed in gliomas. PI3K/Akt pathway and PGE2 also activate beta-catenin. The activation
  of beta-catenin induces transcription of WNT targets genes such as PDK, MCT-1, c-Myc,
  and cyclin D. PDK inhibits the PDH complex in mitochondria, thus pyruvate cannot
  be fully converted into acetyl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle. c-Myc and cyclin D activates
  LDH-A which converts cytosolic pyruvate into lactate. MCT-1 favors lactate extrusion
  out of the cytosol which favors angiogenesis. This effect is called aerobic glycolysis.
  Activation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, and then results
  in cell proliferation, nucleotide synthesis, protein synthesis and angiogenesis
  in gliomas. PPAR gamma agonists induce activation of Bmal1 and the formation of
  heterodimers Clock/Bmal1, and then inhibit the WNT pathway. PPAR gamma agonists
  directly inhibit activation of beta-catenin and its nuclear translocation and then
  inhibit transcription of WNT targets genes. Using PPAR gamma agonists may interest
  to stop gliomas progression through inhibition of aerobic glycolysis via inactivation
  of canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway.

  description: Opposing effects of PPAR gamma and canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling
    in gliomas. Circadian rhythms disorders are observed in Gliomas, with decreasing

    of WNT pathway. Upregulation of canonical WNT and downregulation of PPAR gamma
    are observed in gliomas. PI3K/Akt pathway and PGE2 also activate beta-catenin.
    The activation of beta-catenin induces transcription of WNT targets genes such
    as PDK, MCT-1, c-Myc, and cyclin D. PDK inhibits the PDH complex in mitochondria,
    thus pyruvate cannot be fully converted into acetyl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle.
    c-Myc and cyclin D activates LDH-A which converts cytosolic pyruvate into lactate.
    MCT-1 favors lactate extrusion out of the cytosol which favors angiogenesis. This
    effect is called aerobic glycolysis. Activation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway induces
    aerobic glycolysis, and then results in cell proliferation, nucleotide synthesis,
    protein synthesis and angiogenesis in gliomas. PPAR gamma agonists induce activation
    of Bmal1 and the formation of heterodimers Clock/Bmal1, and then inhibit the WNT
    pathway. PPAR gamma agonists directly inhibit activation of beta-catenin and its
