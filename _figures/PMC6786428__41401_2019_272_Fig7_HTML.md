caption: Schematic diagram of mTORC1/NF-κB/DPP4 signaling pathway activation in HPH.
  Hypoxia activates the Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway in PASMCs; mTORC1 phosphorylates
  IKKα/β, and IKKα/β then phosphorylates IκB. This leads to the degradation of IκB
  and thus the release and activation of NF-κB. Activated NF-κB moves to the nucleus
  and induces the expression of its target gene DPP4. Inhibition of DPP4 by sitagliptin
  can attenuate HPH
papertitle: Crosstalk between the Akt/mTORC1 and NF-κB signaling pathways promotes
  hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension by increasing DPP4 expression in PASMCs.
