caption: Proposed mode of M reg action. (1) When administered prior to transplantation,
  donor M regs migrate to spleen, where they present donor antigen through the direct
  pathway to alloreactive T cells and either delete or anergise them, or induce expansion
  of regulatory T cells. Human M regs have been shown to delete activated T cells
  through a contact-dependent mechanism and to suppress T cell proliferation through
  IDO; however, other suppressor mechanisms may also contribute to M reg function,
  such as IL-10 and TGF-β secretion, or iNOS activity. (2) It is likely that M regs
  serve as a source of donor alloantigen, which is captured and presented by immature
  recipient DCs to alloreactive T cells via the indirect and semi-direct pathways
  of alloantigen recognition. In consequence, responding T cells may be deleted or
  anergised, and antigen-specific T regs may be induced. (3) Through these mechanisms,
  the recipient T cell pool is enriched for T regs and depleted of donor-reactive
  T cells. (4) After transplantation, recipient T regs could induce tolerogenic DCs
  in secondary lymphoid organs. (5) Recipient tolerogenic DCs could then suppress
  activation of T cells. (6) In consequence, an immunological environment conducive
  to allograft acceptance is established.
