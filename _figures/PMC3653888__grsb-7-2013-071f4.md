  Differences in color denote expression level of genes comparing EWS and NWN treatments
  (black to grey background according with the level of expression; black color (highly
  upregulated) to grey color (modest upregulation). Also shown are all significant
  (P < 0.05) positive correlations (thick continuous lines) and non-significant correlations
  (thin dotted lines) due to treatment × time in EWS and NWN.'
