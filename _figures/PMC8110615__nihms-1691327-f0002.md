caption: Activation of different T-cell populations through different pathways of
  antigen presentation. After host cell internalization, Staphylococcus aureus generally
  route through the phagosomal degradation pathway that, under normal circumstances,
  terminates into a highly degradative organelle with a low pH, the phagolysosome.
  1) To circumvent lysosomal degradation, S. aureus can adapt to a low pH tolerant
  small colony variants (SCV)-like phenotype. 2) Staphylococcus aureus can also hide
  in autophagosomes where it prevents fusion with lysosomes preventing degradation
  and presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. 3)
  Staphylococcus aureus that end up in the cytosol are ubiquitinated but not targeted
  for proteasomal degradation and subsequent MHC class I presentation escaping a cytotoxic
  T-cell response. 4) Staphylococcus aureus can also manipulate the expression of
  co-stimulatory molecules preventing an effective T-cell response
