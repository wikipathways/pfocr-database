caption: Mechanism of action of warfarin relevant to pharmacogene identification (further
  details provided in the Data Supplement). Blue box highlights the pharmacokinetic
  warfarin (warf.) metabolic pathway; purple box the Vitamin K cycles and pharmacodynamic
  warfarin pathway. Genes encoding participating proteins are highlighted in yellow.
  Warfarin exerts its anticoagulant effect by inhibiting the functioning of the VKOR
  enzyme, which results in a reduction in coagulation factors. In detail, warfarin
  is ① transported to the liver, where it is absorbed and ② metabolised to active
  metabolites. At this point, some of the drug is ③ eliminated. The remaining active
  metabolites interfere with the Vitamin K cycle by ④ inhibiting vitamin K epoxide
  reductase encoded by VKOR. Vitamin K1 is ⑤ reduced to Vitamin K1 dihydroquinone,
  which is an essential cofactor to γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Γ-glutamyl carboxylase
  ⑥ carboxylates multiple proteins involved in the clotting cascade, including Factor
  (F)II, FVII, FIX, FX, Protein C, Protein S and Protein Z (encoded by PROC, PROS1
  and PROZ respectively); proteins involved in bone and tissue modulation such as
  osteocalcin (encoded by BGLAP); circulating matrix Gla protein (encoded by MGP),
  and apoptosis-related Gas6 (encoded by GAS6). The Vitamin K-independent cycle is
  not included in the diagram. ⑦ The Vitamin K cycle is completed by VKOR and Epoxide
  Hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) which reduce Vitamin K epoxide to Vitamin K
