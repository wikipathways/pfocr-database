caption: Tumor immune mechanism. T cells express PD-1 and CTLA-4 on their surface.
  Interaction with its ligands, PD-L1 and CD80/CD86, respectively, results in negative
  regulation of T cells. Therefore, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 pathway antibodies
  would induce an upregulation of T cell activity.
