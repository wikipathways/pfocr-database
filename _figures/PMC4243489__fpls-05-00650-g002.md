caption: Scheme of the ethylene signaling pathway leading to the onset of leaf senescence.
  (A) In mature leaves, the detection of ethylene activates the downstream signaling
  pathway leading to SAG induction and leaf senescence. (B) In young and mature leaves,
  the receptors constitutively repress the downstream signaling in the absence of
  ethylene. (C) In young leaves, the detection of ethylene activates the downstream
  signaling pathway, but does not itself induce leaf senescence. Note that EIN2 and
  EIN3 are active and induce some ethylene responses, but not leaf senescence by an
  uncharacterized mechanism, in which some regulators of leaf development are likely
  involved. Arrows and bars at the end of each line show positive and negative regulations,
  respectively. Solid lines and black gene names designate the active form, while
  dotted lines and gray gene names indicate the inactive form. Several transcription
  factors (TFs) and signals such as jasmonic acid are not drawn in this scheme owing
  to space limitations. A detailed description on the scheme is presented in the main
  text.
