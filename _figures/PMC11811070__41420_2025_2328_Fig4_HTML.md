caption: The necroptosis pathway is initiated by the interaction between ligands and
  their death receptors, such as Fas, TNFR1, IFNRs, TLRs, or DNA-sensing molecules
  like ZBP1/DAI. In the TNFR1-dependent pathway, TNF-α binds to TNFR1, forming complex
  I (DISC) where RIPK1 is polyubiquitinated by cIAP1 or LUBAC, activating NF-κB signaling
  to promote cell survival. When NF-κB activation is suppressed, RIPK1, FADD, and
  caspase-8 form complex IIa, inducing apoptosis. If caspase-8 is inhibited or suppressed,
  RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8 form complex IIb, leading to RIPK3 and MLKL activation,
  which forms the necrosome. Phosphorylated MLKL translocates to the plasma membrane,
  forming pores, resulting in membrane rupture and necroptosis
