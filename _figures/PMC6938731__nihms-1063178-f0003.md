  in the presence of NAPDH and cofactors such as BH4, FMN, FAD, and eNOS catalyze
  the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline and NO. Further, one electron oxidation
  of NO catalyzed by ceruloplasmin in plasma and cytochrome c oxidase in tissues yields
  nitrite, further with relatively faster two-electron oxidation yielding nitrate
  by heme proteins in blood and tissues. In the absence of oxygen (hypoxia), nitrite
  is reduced by reductases, including xanthine oxidase, deoxyhemoglobin, deoxymyoglobin
  to produce NO. Further, oxidative stress leads to BH4 oxidation and eNOS uncoupling
  leading to superoxide production.'
