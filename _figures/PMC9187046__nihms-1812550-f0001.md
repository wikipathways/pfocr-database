caption: T-cell activation is regulated by IRs PD-1, LAG-3 and CTLA-4. GSK-3 inactivation
  by GSK3 small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) or siRNA causes the upregulation of Tbet
  (Tbx21) transcription and expression, which in turn, represses the transcription
  and expression of PD-1 and LAG-3. Some inhibition is mediated via TCR-CD28 mediated
  activation of PI 3K, its activation of AKT (and ERKs) which phospho-inhibit GSK-3;
  however, the effects of this pathway are partial. The use of GSK-3 SMIs and siRNAs
  provides a much more potent bolus Inhibition of GSK-3 resulting in the potent generation
  of PD-1 and LAG-3 down-regulation. The downregulation of both IRs removes the inhibitory
  effect of the IRs on T-cell function, allowing for more potent reactivity against
  tumor antigens in cancer immunotherapy. At the same time, it is possible that PD-1
  and CTLA-4 themselves can also affect the activation status of GSK-3. PD-1 and CTLA-4
  inhibit AKT activation via different mechanisms resulting in enhanced GSK-3 inhibitory
  functions. Blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 with antibodies might block function and
  sequester the receptors away from CD28 resulting in enhanced AKT, reduced GSK-3
  and reduced PD-1 and LAG3 expression. Lastly, the Inhibition of GSK-3 liberates
  β-catenin from proteasomal degradation and allows it to translocate to the nucleus
  to upregulate progenitor transcription factor, TCF-1. TCF-1 regulates T-cell exhaustion
  and progenitor pool. This figure was created by biorender.com [].
