caption: Plasmalogen de novo biosynthesis. On the left panel, a cartoon of a cell
  with a focus on the organelles where plasmalogen de novo biosynthesis takes place,
  i.e., peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum. On the right panel, the enzymatic reactions
  of plasmalogen de novo biosynthetic pathway are separated by the organelles where
  they take place. The reader is referred to the text for the names of the enzymes.
