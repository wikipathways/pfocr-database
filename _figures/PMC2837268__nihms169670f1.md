caption: Cholesterol metabolism in the brain. (a) An abbreviated cholesterol biosynthetic
  pathway is shown in which key intermediates and enzymes are highlighted. Statins
  reduce the flow of intermediates through the biosynthetic pathway by inhibiting
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase. Farnesyl diphosphate
  (farnesyl-PP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate are polyisoprenoid end products of
  the pathway. Knockout of the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase gene causes cholesterol
  accumulation and activation of a negative feedback pathway that suppresses the reductase
  enzyme as well as others in the pathway and subsequently decreases cholesterol synthesis.
  Redrawn from . (b) Cholesterol synthesis and accumulation in mouse brain as a function
  of age of the animal.
