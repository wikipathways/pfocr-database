caption: Simple metabolic route for producing valuable compounds from lignin-derived
  aromatics. Lignin monomers are converted to acetyl-CoA as a final intermediate of
  protocatechuate metabolism in β-ketoadipate pathway. Lipid and polyhydroxyalkanoates
  are generated from the significant intermediate of acetyl-CoA via natural catabolic
  pathways in Rhodococci opacus (pink) and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (orange), respectively
  [, ]. Rhodococcus sp. RHA1 is engineered to accumulate a significant amount of vanillin
  from feruilic acid by deleting vanillin dehydrogenase (Vdh) gene (green). Cis, cis-muconate
  has been proved to improve its yield in the engineered strain of P. putida by deletion
  of muconate cycloisomerase (CatB) gene and insertion of protocatechuate decarboxylase
  (AroY) gene (blue) []
