caption: Schematic representation of signaling pathways activated by E2 and its crosstalk
  with GH. Estradiol can regulate GH actions in liver by modulating GH responsiveness
  which includes changes in hepatic GHR expression and crosstalk with GH-activated
  JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway. Estrogens can induce SOCS2 expression which in turn
  negatively inhibits GHR-JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway.
