caption: 'Major signaling pathways that regulate SREBP2 activation during cholesterol
  synthesis: (A) P53 pathway, and (B) Akt pathway. In the p53 pathway, mutant p53
  binds to SREBP2 and subsequently activates the Ras, RhoA, YAP/TAZ pathways, while
  p53 blocks the activation of SREBP2 through ABCA1. Once SREBP2 is activated, it
  signals the mevalonate pathway to synthesize acetyl-CoA into cholesterol. In the
  Akt pathway, growth factors bind to receptor tyrosine kinases to activate PI3K,
  which then activates Akt. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits TSC2, which inhibits RHEB
  and activates mTORC1. MTORC1 works with other targets to stimulate and activate
  SREBP2. However, the activation of Akt may directly phosphorylate GSK3B, which will
  mediate phosphorylation and inhibition of transcription factors including SREBP2.
  This promotes proteasomal degradation'
