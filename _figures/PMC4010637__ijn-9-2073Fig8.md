caption: 'A hypothetical mechanism of C60(OH)24-mediated cell protection from H2O2.
  Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of many detoxification
  or antioxidant enzymes. It is plausible that C60(OH)24 transiently increases the
  intracellular level of ROS and/or activates p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which may
  possibly lead to facilitating the dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap. The resultant
  Nrf2/ARE activation induced phase II detoxification or antioxidant enzyme, thereby
  potentiating cellular defence capacity against H2O2-induced cell death.Abbreviations:
  ARE, antioxidant response element; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; Keap, Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NQO, quinone oxidoreductase; γ-GCS,
  glutamylcysteine synthetase.'
