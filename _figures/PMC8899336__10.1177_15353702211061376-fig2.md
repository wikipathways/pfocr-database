caption: Illustration of the effects of Wnt pathway in embryonic biliary epithelial
  cell development. Wnt pathway is precisely regulated in every development stage
  from embryonic stem cells to functional mature cholangiocytes, biliary epithelial
  cells. Wnt activation can potentiate the definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation
  from ESC, while it must be inhibited to pattern the DE into foregut fate. However,
  Wnt activation determines the hepatic fate from foregut along with BMP4 and FGF
  signaling. Wnt pathway is also important for the proliferation and survival of hepatoblasts.
  Wnt activation plays a critical role in the differentiation of cholangiocytes from
  the hepatoblasts. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)
