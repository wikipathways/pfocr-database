caption: The potential mechanism of downregulated LAMA4 inhibiting oxidative stress-induced
  apoptosis of RGCs in glaucoma by suppressing the MAPK signaling pathway. When RGCs
  showed oxidative stress in glaucoma, LAMA4 was upregulated, thus activating the
  MAPK signaling pathway and transcription factor p53 and promoted cell apoptosis.
  While silenced LAMA4 could reverse the above effect. LAMA4, laminin α4; RGC, retinal
  ganglion cell; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
