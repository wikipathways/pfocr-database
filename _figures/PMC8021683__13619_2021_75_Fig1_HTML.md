caption: Summary of signaling pathways regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation. Hippo/YAP
  signaling is inactive when p-YAP is bound to the dystrophin glycoprotein complex
  (DGC). Binding of Agrin to the DGC leads to the translocation of p-YAP to the cytoplasm,
  phosphorylation of YAP is regulated by the kinase complex (Mst1/Lats2/Salv), and
  dephosphorylation of p-YAP by PP1/PP2A or others results in YAP activation and translocation
  to the nucleus. FGF signaling activates the MAPK pathway and induces the expression
  of Dusp6, a negative regulator of pERK, and Dusp6 protein is post-transcriptionally
  modified and degraded by H2O2. The PI3K-AKT signaling is regulated by NRG1/ErbB2/4,
  periostin/integrin, small molecule carbocyclin, and Wnt signaling pathways, which
  fine-tune β-catenin activity and its translocation into the nucleus. Binding of
  ligands such as Delta/Jagged to Notch receptors leads to Notch intracellular domain
  (NICD) activation and translocation to the nucleus. Together with injury-induced
  activation of chromatin remodeling factor Brg1/Dnmt3ab, the Yap/pERK-β-catenin/NICD
  activation in the nucleus regulates the expression of cell-cycle regulators including
  cyclins and cyclin inhibitors

  description: Summary of signaling pathways regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation.
    Hippo/YAP signaling is inactive when p-YAP is bound to the dystrophin glycoprotein
    complex (DGC). Binding of Agrin to the DGC leads to the translocation of p-YAP
    to the cytoplasm, phosphorylation of YAP is regulated by the kinase complex (Mst1/Lats2/Salv),
    and dephosphorylation of p-YAP by PP1/PP2A or others results in YAP activation
    and translocation to the nucleus. FGF signaling activates the MAPK pathway and
    induces the expression of Dusp6, a negative regulator of pERK, and Dusp6 protein
    is post-transcriptionally modified and degraded by H2O2. The PI3K-AKT signaling
    is regulated by NRG1/ErbB2/4, periostin/integrin, small molecule carbocyclin,
    and Wnt signaling pathways, which fine-tune β-catenin activity and its translocation
    into the nucleus. Binding of ligands such as Delta/Jagged to Notch receptors leads
    to Notch intracellular domain (NICD) activation and translocation to the nucleus.
    Together with injury-induced activation of chromatin remodeling factor Brg1/Dnmt3ab,
    the Yap/pERK-β-catenin/NICD activation in the nucleus regulates the expression
    of cell-cycle regulators including cyclins and cyclin inhibitors
