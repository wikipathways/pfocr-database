caption: Altered metabolism as the source of nadph biosynthesis. The principal metabolic
  pathways that generate NADPH are numbered in blue with key enzymes shown in red.
  These include (1) the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in which conversion of Glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P) to 6-phosphogluconolactone (6-PGL) and 6-phosphogluconate (6-PG) to ribulose-phosphate
  (Ru5P) generates 2 NADPH molecules. (2) Another mechanism of NADPH production is
  via the conversion of malate to pyruvate by malic enzyme 1. (3) The third reaction
  mediating NADPH production is the methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD)-mediated
  conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF) to methenyltetrahydrofolate
  (CH-THF). (ME1). (4) Iso-citrate dehydrogenases (IDH) and (5) nicotinamide nucleotide
  transhydrogenases (NNT) are other routes of NADPH production in cancer cells. (LAT
