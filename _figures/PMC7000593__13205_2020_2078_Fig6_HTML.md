caption: Role and pathway acquired by keratin, cytokines, and interleukins in horn
  SCC. a Role of keratin type I and II in cancer. Deregulation of keratins in different
  layer of epithelial cell displays their action in different aspects of carcinoma
  i.e. cell proliferation, migration metastasis, and skipping apoptosis. b Molecular
  network of cytokines and interleukins in cancer. Pathways presented for cytokines
  in general and interleukins (IL1b, 6, 8, 17) are acquired from established human
  cancer pathways. All of them believed to contribute in SCC of horn via intermediate
  pathways like JAKs, STAT (1, 3, 5), TAK1, TAB1, TRAF6, PI3K, Akt, NF-kB, and FAK
