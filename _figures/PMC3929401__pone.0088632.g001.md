caption: The workflow diagram shows times and type of sample collection before and
  after IFN-β administration and sample processing and analysis. Concentrations of
  NAbs (against IFN-β) and IFN-β were measured in sera. mRNA used for gene expression
  measurements was extracted from whole blood. For signaling pathway analysis by phosphoflow,
  immune cell subtypes were identified and phosphorylation levels of various Stat
  proteins quantified in single cells. If present in sera, NAbs prevent the initiation
  of the IFN-β signal at the cell surface. In the absence of NAbs IFN-β binds to its
  cognate receptor and forms an activated receptor complex with associated kinases
  that phosphorylate Stat proteins at specific residues. The Jak/Stat pathway is the
  major signaling pathway activated by IFN-β.
