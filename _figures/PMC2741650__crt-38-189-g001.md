caption: Genetic alterations during the development of colorectal cancer. Significant
  genetic alterations at different junctures during the transformation of colon epithelia
  to invasive adenocarcinoma are depicted. Induction of FGF-BP expression is an early
  event that is driven by mutations and activation of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway
  (Adapted and modified from Tassi E. and Wellstein A., Sem. Onc., in press).
