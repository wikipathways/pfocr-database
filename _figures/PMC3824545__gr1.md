caption: Model overview.  represents the synaptic space, where active synapses release
  glutamate and K+, and  is the astrocyte intracellular space, where K+ enters the
  astrocyte through the Na-K pump, NKCC, and KirAS channels. Na+ enters via NKCC and
  exits via the Na-K pump. Glutamate binds to metabotropic receptors on the astrocyte
  endfoot, effecting IP3 production inside the astrocyte wall, which leads to release
  of Ca2+ from internal stores, causing EET production. Ca2+ and EET open BK channels
  at the perivascular endfoot, releasing K+ into the perivascular space . Meanwhile,
  buildup of intracellular K+ in the astrocyte results in K+ efflux through the perivascular
  endfoot KirAV channel.  is the arteriole smooth muscle cell intracellular space,
  where KirSMC channels are activated by the increase in extracellular K+. The resulting
  drop in membrane potential closes Ca2+ channels, which reduces Ca2+ influx, leading
  to SMC relaxation and arteriole dilation (strain, ϵ). The arteriole dilation (ϵ)
  stretches the membrane of the enclosing astrocyte perivascular endfoot, which activates
  Ca2+ influx through TRPV4 channels. The prohibition sign on the channel is meant
  to indicate the inhibition mechanism of the channel, as the TRPV4 channel is inhibited
  by intracellular and extracellular Ca2+. Note that the diagram here is not to scale.
  The perivascular endfoot is actually wrapped around the arteriole, but here we show
  them separated to make clear the ion flow at the endfoot-vessel interface. Dashed
  arrows indicate ion movement; solid arrows indicate causal relationships, and dotted
  arrows indicate inhibition. Thin dashed arrows in astrocyte Kir channels indicate
  the ion flux direction at baseline or, in the vessel Kir, the change in flux direction
  when extracellular K+ reaches over 15 mM. The potassium signaling pathway is highlighted
  by blue arrows. To see this figure in color, go online.
