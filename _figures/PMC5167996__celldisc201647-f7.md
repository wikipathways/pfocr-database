caption: A model on how BLM complex promotes FANCM recruitment to stalled forks and
  replication traverse of ICLs. A cartoon illustrates that the recruitment of FANCM
  to stalled forks is an event downstream of ATR but upstream of both FA repair pathway
  or the replication traverse pathway to repair or traverse ICLs. Two different scenarios
  when replication forks collide with ICLs (single fork-stalling and double-folk stalling)
  [] are shown. The stalled single forks can continue past ICLs in the FANCM-dependent
  traverse pathway [], whereas the stalled double-forks can initiate Fanconi anemia
  pathway to repair the ICLs []. BLM complex can act at multiple steps in the two
  pathways. It may enhance FANCM hyperphosphorylation (step 1) by direct protein–protein
  interactions. Alternatively, it may promote FANCM recruitment to stalled forks using
  its DNA binding and helicase activity (step 2). Moreover, it may stimulate the downstream
  traverse reaction using BLM helicase activity (step 3). FANCM is required for recruitment
  of FA core complex (marked by FANCA) and BLM to stalled forks []. Because FANCM,
  BLM and FA core complex form a highly stable multi-subunit complex [, , , , ], they
  may be co-recruited to stalled forks. Their recruitment depends on DNA translocase
  activity of FANCM and helicase activity of BLM, which may explain the observation
  that FANCM and BLM mutually depend on each other for their recruitment [] (this
  study), and FA core complex depends on FANCM for its recruitment []. ‘D2-I’ refers
  to the FANCD2–FANCI complex, which is monoubiquitinated by the FA core complex in
  response to replication stress. The ubiquitination is marked by ‘Ub’, hyperphosphorylation
  is marked by ‘P’. FA, Fanconi anemia; ICL, interstrand crosslink; MMC, mitomycin
