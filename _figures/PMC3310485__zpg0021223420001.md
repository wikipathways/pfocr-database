caption: Overview of BDNF signaling through TrkB receptors. Upon binding to BDNF,
  the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB becomes phosphorylated. Phosphorylation at various
  sites leads to activation of downstream pathways. The PI3K pathway activates protein
  kinase B (AKT), leading to cell survival. The MAPK/ERK pathway leads to cell growth
  and differentiation. The PLCγ pathway activates inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor
  to release intracellular calcium stores leading to enhanced calmodulin kinase (CamK)
  activity, leading to synaptic plasticity. All three pathways converge on transcription
  factor CREB, which can up-regulate gene expression. DAG, diacylglycerol.
