caption: Involvement of Ang-II, ACE2, and Ang-1–7 in atherogenic pathways. The Ang-II
  binding into AT1R can activate Nox5 through a calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathway.
  The activated Nox5 induces the formation of ROS and stimulates the RhoA/ROCK pathway,
  which in turn, activates MAPKs and induces the transactivation of several transcription
  factors such as NF-κB. The expression of several genes is regulated by NF-κB, for
  instance cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), chemokines (MCP-1), adhesion molecules (P-selectin,
  ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), which are involved in Ang-II-induced migration of mononuclear
  leukocytes. In addition, Ang-II is cleaved by ACE2 and produces Ang-1–7, an important
  RAS counter-regulator. Ang-1–7 shows the potential to negatively regulate atherogenic
  pathways, inducing anti-inflammatory effect, weakening monocyte migration and decrease
  of vascular lipids accumulation. These actions attributed to Ang-1–7 are related
  to the reduction of oxidative stress and the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines
  due to inhibition of the Nox4 and NF-κB-mediated pathways. Furthermore, Ang-1–7
  stimulates the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to phosphorylation of eNOS and NO formation,
  which improves the endothelial function. Ang-1–7 is also capable of promoting endothelial
  activation of AT2R, which also stimulates the NO cascade. In VSMC, Ang-1–7 inhibits
  muscle cell migration and proliferation, in contrast to Ang-II which possess proliferative
  and hypertrophic effects.
