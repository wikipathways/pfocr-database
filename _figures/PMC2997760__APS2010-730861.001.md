caption: Pathway for the control of penile erection and detumescence. Stimulation
  of erection originates in the higher centers of the brain that result in upregulation
  of NANC and cholinergic activity and withdrawal of sympathetic activity in the nerves
  innervating the corpora cavernosa and small arteries of the penis. This increase
  in NANC and cholinergic activity results in upregulated NO release from the endothelium
  and NANC nerve terminals. The NO diffuses into the smooth muscle of the corpora
  cavernosa and small arteries/arterioles of the penis and binds to the reduced heme
  iron of soluble guanylate cyclase, activating the enzyme and increasing the formation
  of cGMP from GTP. cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity opens potassium channels
  in smooth muscle cells and increases the uptake of calcium into stores. This leads
  to a decrease in intracellular calcium concentration and smooth muscle cell relaxation.
  This increases blood flow into the corporal sinuses and the cavernosal sinuses expand
  trapping blood in the corpora producing a penile erection. Detumescence is initiated
  by release of vasoconstrictors from sympathetic terminals and endothelium. A cGMP
  specific phosphodiesterase (type 5) breaks down the cGMP to GTP and terminates the
  actions of cGMP. Three new pharmacologic targets for the treatment of erectile dysfunction
  (sGC stimulators/activators, Rho-kinase inhibitors and sodium nitrite) have been
  identified and may be effective in patients refractory to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor
  treatment. Recent experiments have shown that nitrite is capable of generating bioactive
  NO in the corpora cavernosa. Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators (YC-1, A-350619,
  CFM-1571, and the Bayer compounds BAY 41-2272, BAY 41-8543, and BAY 63-2521) have
  been shown to act directly on the sGC enzyme and synergize with available NO which
  could be beneficial in disease states with low NO production and bioavailability.
  sGC activators (BAY 58-2667, BAY 60-2770 and HMR 1766/S3448) have also been shown
  to act on oxidized and heme-deficient sGC. Rho-kinase/RhoA activation has been shown
  to mediate detumescence and maintain flaccidity. Rho kinase inhibits the regulatory
  subunit of myosin phosphatase within smooth muscle cells and maintains contractile
  tone under low-cytosolic calcium concentrations. Upregulated Rho-kinase activity
  has been reported in ED, so Rho-kinase inhibitors (Y-27632 and SAR 407899) have
  potent erectile effects and offer another therapeutic target for the treatment of
  ED.
