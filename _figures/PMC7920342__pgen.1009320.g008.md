caption: 'Lhx6 labels a group of progenitor cells that contribute to the odontoblasts
  and dentin bridge in the furcation. In these progenitors, Lhx6 is critical for activating
  the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which in turn is important for the differentiation
  of Lhx6+ progenitor cells into odontoblasts. One mechanism through which Lhx6 mediates
  the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is by inhibiting the expression of Wnt antagonist
  Sfrp2, thereby promoting the role of Wnt10a in inducing odontoblast differentiation.
  In the absence of Lhx6, the progenitors residing in the middle apical area (MAA)
  have significantly decreased canonical Wnt signaling activity, so they cannot differentiate
  into odontoblasts and form the dentin bridge. One important reason is that without
  Lhx6, the expression level of Sfrp2 in the MAA increases sharply, and the increased
  Sfrp2 antagonizes the induction by Wnt10a. The arrowhead indicates absence of furcation.
  Epi: epithelium.'
