caption: When an estrogen molecule binds to an estrogen receptor, the hormone-receptor
  complex then moves to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and initiates transcription.
  B, Estrogen-mediated nongenomic action, membrane-initiated steroid signaling. In
  the case of the nongenomic, that is, MISS estrogen signaling pathway, estrogen receptors
  are located in the cell membrane. Their activity is linked to the PI3K/Akt or MAPK
  pathway, resulting in a rapid, nonnuclear effect, and is associated with the novel
  growth factor GPR30.
