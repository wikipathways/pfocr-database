caption: Schematic presentation of proposed effects of ER agonists and CA inhibition
  on metabolism. Imbedded graphs show metabolite concentration changes following acetazolamide,
  17β-estradiol and ferulic acid treatment in MCF10A, MCF7 and MCF7HER2 relative to
  untreated controls in the same cell lines. Horizontal dotted line in each graph
  shows a value of 1 (relative effect value in untreated cells). Dashed arrowed lines
  show indirect (through several steps in the pathway) connection between metabolites;
  solid arrowed lines show direct pathway connection between metabolites. Values are
  from 3 to 5 independent experiments.
