caption: Schematic representation of the Gαq and Gαs pathways that regulate neurotransmitter
  secretion in C. elegans. Gαq signaling causes increased DAG levels, whereas the
  Gαs pathway causes increased cAMP levels. C. elegans protein names are shown in
  uppercase letters and mammalian homolog names are shown in parentheses. The blue
  box surrounds the Gαq pathway and the red box surrounds the Gαs pathway. Proteins
  labeled in blue inhibit neurotransmitter release and those in green promote release.
  Lines ending in arrows are positive regulation; lines ending in balls are negative
  regulation. Figure modeled after .
