caption: Resisting cell death. One of the major roles played by HPV oncoproteins in
  resisting cell death is evading apoptosis. Both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic
  pathways are deregulated to attain this function by HPV-E5, -E6 and -E7. The extrinsic
  apoptotic pathway is activated upon receptor trimerization and the subsequent recruitment
  of adaptor molecules and procaspase 8 to the DISC. The activation of caspase 8 then
  leads to the activation of downstream executioner caspases 3 and 7, leading to cell
  death/apoptosis. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated by external stimuli
  (UV-radiation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, starvation, etc.), leading to the formation
  of pores in the mitochondrial membrane and release of mitochondrial inner membrane
  proteins (cytochrome c, SMAC) into the cytosol. Released cytochrome c and pro-caspase
  9 form the apoptosome, leading to activating caspase 9, which, in turn, activates
  downstream executioner caspases 3 and 7, leading to apoptosis. E5 can downregulate
  the Fas receptor and perturb the formation of the DISC complex, thus abrogating
  the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Further, E5 can perturb ROS-induced Bax activation
  and inhibit the apoptotic response to UV B radiation. E6 can block extrinsic pathways
  by binding the death domain, leading to its proteasomal degradation. E6 inactivates
  p53, Bax and Bak, thus abrogating MOMP and the release of cytochrome c and, thus,
  inhibiting the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. E6 can also inhibit antiapoptotic c-IAP2,
  blocking the formation of the apoptosome and activation of the executioner caspases.
  E7 seems to have a dual function in activating and abrogating apoptosis; however,
  E7 has been demonstrated to perturb TNF receptor-induced apoptosis by upregulating
  c-IAP2 and suppressing caspase 8. FADD—Fas-associated protein with death domain,
  TNF—tumour necrosis factor, TRAIL—FasL and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand,
  TRAF2—TNF receptor-associated factor 2, DISC—death-induced signalling complex, c-IAP2—cellular
  inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2, RIP—receptor interacting protein and MOMP—mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization.
