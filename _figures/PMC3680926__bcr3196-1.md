caption: 'Estrogen receptor functional domains and signal transduction schemes. (a)
  Different domains of estrogen receptor (ER). Both ERα and ERβ isoforms consist of
  five functional domains: an N-terminal A/B domain, a DNA binding domain (DBD), a
  hinge domain, a ligand binding domain (LBD) and a C-terminal domain. The A/B domain
  contains a constitutively active, estrogen-independent, transcriptional activation
  domain (activation function 1 (AF1)) and is involved in co-activator binding and
  transcriptional activation of target genes. The DBD contains two zinc finger motives
  by which binding of the receptor to the estrogen response elements (ERE) of target
  genes is mediated. This domain contributes to dimerization and activation of the
  receptor. The LBD consists of 12 α-helices that form a hydrophobic pocket, responsible
  for ligand binding. In addition, the LBD contains an estrogen-responsive transcriptional
  activation domain (activation function 2 (AF2)). The region between the LBD and
  the DBD is called the hinge region. Finally, the C-terminal domain is probably involved
  in differentiating between agonists and antagonists. (b) ER signal pathway. In the
  classical genomic pathway, ER binds directly to the DNA. Estradiol (E2) binds to
  ER, which induces the release of heat shock protein (hsp) 90. ER dimerizes and translocates
  to the nucleus, where it can bind to EREs. The nonclassical genomic pathway differs
  from the classical genomic signaling pathway in that ER does not bind to the DNA
  directly, but the ER dimer interacts with other transcription factors that bind
  to the DNA. As such, other subsets of genes are regulated. In the nongenomic pathway,
  ER does not stimulate transcription by binding to the DNA but ER activates a subset
  of secondary signaling pathways: ER binds to the p85α regulator subunit leading
  to activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt. Another mechanism in

  Ras, which activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K signaling
