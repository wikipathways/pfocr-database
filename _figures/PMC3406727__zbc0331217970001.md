caption: 'Simplified schematic drawing of metabolic pathways in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
  (adapted from Ref. ). Electron flow in the stroma is represented in red, and ATP
  is shown in blue. Acetate assimilation is shown in green, and gluconeogenesis is
  shown in purple. Numbers in parentheses refer to glycolytic enzymes: (1), amylase,
  phosphorylase; (2), hexokinase; (3), phosphoglucose isomerase; (4), PFK; (5), aldolase,
  triosephosphate isomerase; (6), GAPDH; (7), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Enzymes
  of the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway were as follows: (8), G6P dehydrogenase;
  (9), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Letters refer to acetate assimilation, glyoxylate
  cycle and the first steps of gluconeogenesis: (A), acetyl-CoA synthase or acetate
  kinase and phosphate acetyl transferase; (B), isocitrate lyase; (C), succinate dehydrogenase
  (SDH), (D), fumarase; (E), malate dehydrogenase (MDH); (F), PEP carboxykinase; (G),
  enolase and phosphoglycerate-mutase. G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 6-PG, 6-phosphogluconate;
  Fd, ferredoxin; FNR, ferredoxin NADP reductase; NDH, NADPH dehydrogenase; MV, methylviologen.'
