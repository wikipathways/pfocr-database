caption: Ideograph for demonstrating molecular mechanism of PrPC promoting Ems progression.
  EMs is an estrogen-dependent disease, the ectopic lesions demonstrates a state of
  disordered cholesterol metabolism, and the accumulated cellular cholesterol activates
  the steroid biosynthesis process, thus augmented local estradiol level promotes
  PrPC expression. Up-regulating expression of PrPC hinders PPARα expression, which
  decreases ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and increases HMGCR-mediated cholesterol
  biosynthesis, further promotes cellular cholesterol accumulation and estradiol biosynthesis,
  thus promotes ESC proliferation, migration and invasion and encourages EMs progression.
