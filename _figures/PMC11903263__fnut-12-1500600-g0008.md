caption: Diagram of the central pathways impacted in the serum and urine of puppies
  (at 2 days) by maternal supplementation with Saccharomyces boulardii. The arrow
  (↓) means a lower abundance of metabolites and the arrow (↑) a higher relative abundance
  in Saccharomyces boulardii compared to the placebo group. Urine metabolites are
  written in red, urine metabolites in green and metabolites found modified in both
  in orange (Hydroxyphenyl lactate)
