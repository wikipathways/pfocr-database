caption: (A,B) Relative abundances of the genes involved in (A) the HP/HB cycle (modified

  seawater metagenomes as depicted by the width of solid lines. The yellow line indicates
  abundance higher in sediments, the blue line indicates higher in seawater, and the
  black line indicates no difference. The dashed line indicates little to no support
  for a pathway. The numbers/abbreviations in red indicate statistical significant
  between the three sediment and the three seawater metagenomes (P < 0.05).
