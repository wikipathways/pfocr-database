caption: CgIgR-Mediated Pathway Induced CgICP Production to Promote Hemocyte Phagocytosis
  and Degradation of V. splendidusUpon recognizing V. splendidus and LPS, CgIgR formed
  dimers and transferred signals to intracellular CgSyk. The activated CgSyk induced
  CgERK phosphorylation, which then promoted the enrichments of CgH3K4me2 on CgICP
  promoters to induce the production of CgICPs. CgCAICP-1, CgICP-2, and CgLRRIG-1
  all containing a TM domain could locate on hemocyte membrane to recognize V. splendidus
  and promote hemocyte phagocytosis toward V. splendidus, which were then degraded
  by lysosomes in hemocytes. CgIgR upon recognizing V. splendidus and LPS could activate
  Syk-ERK pathway to induce CgICP production, which eventually promoted hemocytes
  to phagocytize and eliminate the invading bacteria.
