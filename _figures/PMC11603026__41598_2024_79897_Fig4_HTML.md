caption: Drug repurposing discovery in Mpox infection. This figure illustrates the
  results of the Steiner tree analysis used to uncover molecular pathways connecting
  DEGs in Mpox infection, focusing on (A) kinases and (B) transcription factors. The
  analysis identifies critical nodes and edges within the kinase and transcription
  factors networks, highlighting the key signaling pathways disrupted by Mpox. The
  screening of repurposed drugs was conducted based on these identified biological
  processes and signaling pathways significantly impacted by the infection. This analysis
  provides insights into potential therapeutic strategies for managing Mpox infection
  through the repurposing of existing drugs. Proviral genes associated with Mpox infection
  are represented by red ovals, while antiviral genes are shown in green ovals. FDA-approved
  drugs targeting proviral genes are indicated by green diamonds, and those targeting
  antiviral genes are shown in red diamonds. Additionally, yellow diamonds represent
  drugs that target both antiviral and proviral pathways
