caption: 'Regulation of Akt phosphorylation. PI 3-K activated downstream of RTKs phosphorylates
  PIP2 generating PIP3. PDK1 and Akt are transiently docked to the membrane by their
  PIP3-binding module, the PH domain, thereby exposing their catalytic domain. By
  this mechanism, PDK1 and Akt relocate in close proximity to one another and PDK1
  phosphorylates Akt at Thr308. Phosphorylation at Ser473 is carried out by mTORC2,
  leading to full activation of Akt which then redistributes to discrete subcellular
  locations where it phosphorylates target proteins containing the RxRxxS/T motif.
  Dephosphorylation of PIP3 by PTEN, and direct dephosphorylation of Akt by PP2A at
  Thr308 and PHLPP at Ser473 all contribute to terminate Akt signaling. Abbreviations:
  mTORC2, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; PDK-1, phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1; PH, pleckstrin homology; PHLPP, PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein
  phosphatase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5- trisphosphate; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin
  homolog deleted on chromosome ten; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.'
