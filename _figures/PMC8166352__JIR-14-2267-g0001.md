caption: 'The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of complications and mortality
  in obese patients with COVID-19 based on the association of low-grade inflammation,
  adipose tissue dysfunction and endothelial dysfunction: In obese patients with COVID-19
  or SARS-CoV-2, as well as, the bacterial endotoxins (LPS) of the intestinal bacterial
  translocation promote the activation of TLR4 in favor of the MyD88-dependent pro-inflammatory
  pathway. The activation of NF-κB is linked to the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6,
  IL-12 and other cytokines, contributing to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes
  and increased expression of ECA2. In the adipose tissue of patients with COVID-19,
  there is an increase in the expression of ECA2, promoting greater entry of SARS-CoV-2,
  making this tissue a viral reservoir. Metabolic inflammation in obese patients is
  characterized by dysfunctional adipose tissue, with mitochondrial dysfunction and
  decreased fatty acid oxidation, causing an amount of inflammatory cells showing
  an increase in the influx of M1 macrophages and chemotactic signaling, via MCP-1
  and release of IL-8 by adipocytes, associated with an increase in reactive oxygen
  species. Associated with this process of immune activation, obese patients with
  COVID-19 have systemic microvascular dysfunction and a predisposition to thrombus
  formation that is exacerbated by higher levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines,
  such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, worsening the outcomes in COVID-19.'
