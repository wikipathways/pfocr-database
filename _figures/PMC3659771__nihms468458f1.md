caption: Ligands of the Jagged (JAG1, JAG2) and Delta-like (DLL1, DLL3, DLL4) families
  (upper cell) interact with Notch family receptors (NOTCH1 through NOTCH4) on an
  adjacent cell. The Notch receptor exists at the cell surface as a proteolytically-cleaved
  heterodimer consisting of a large ectodomain and a membrane-tethered intracellular
  domain. The Fringe proteins (Lfng, Mfng and Rfng) glycosylate Notch family receptors,
  potentiating signaling from DLL family ligands and suppressing signaling from JAG
  family ligands. The receptor/ligand interaction induces additional proteolytic cleavages
  in the membrane-tethered intracellular domain. The final cleavage, catalyzed by
  the γ–secretase complex, frees the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the cell
  membrane. NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the RBPJ
  protein, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)/corepressor (CoR) complex from
  the RBPJ protein. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone
  acetyltransferases (HAc) are recruited to the NICD/RBPJ complex, leading to the
  transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.
