caption: A schematic representation of the signaling pathway involved in the rapid
  arrest of leaf primordium growth upon low R/FR perception. Low R/FR light in a canopy
  is sensed through the phytochrome system, and the perception of a varying R/FR ratio
  is achieved through a change in the equilibrium of the Pr and Pfr forms of phytochromes.
  Phytochrome-mediated signals rapidly induce auxin changes perceived by TIR1. When
  auxin concentrations increase, auxin binds to the TIR1 receptor in the SCFTIR1 complex,
  leading to recruitment of the Aux/IAA repressors to TIR1. Once recruited to the
  SCFTIR1 complex, the repressors enter a pathway that leads to their destruction
  and the subsequent activation of ARF transcription factors. Among the ARF targets
  are the Aux/IAA genes themselves, which produce nascent Aux/IAA proteins that restore
  repression upon the pathway in a negative feedback loop. ARF activators bind to
  auxin-response elements in promoters of auxin-response genes. Among them is AtCKX6
  a gene encoding a cytokinin oxidase involved in cytokinin breakdown. The activity
  of AtCKX6 resulting in a reduction of cytokinin levels diminishes cell proliferation
  in developing leaf primordia.
