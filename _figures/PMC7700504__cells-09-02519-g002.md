caption: Main mechanisms involved in MAMs development and their role in tumor cell
  progression. (A). Calcium homeostasis is crucial to promote cell survival. A reduced
  flow of Ca2+ into mitochondria blunts Oxphos activity, thus, reducing ATP production.
  Moreover, Ca2+ induces the glycolytic pathway (Warburg effect), which eventually
  support cancer cells’ survival and proliferation. (B) Mitochondria fusion and fission
  programs are strictly controlled to be balanced in a physiological condition. However,
  during cancer progression, ER mediates mitochondria fission and shifts the equilibrium
  towards the fragmentation process. DRP1 and MFN2 are the main proteins involved
  in this context—the former enhances fission while the latter regulates mitochondrial
  fusion. (C) Tumor cells’ survival depends on the ER-mitochondria distance. Apoptosis
  happens as a consequence of their proximity, while a greater distance is associated
  with cell survival, as shown for Tpm, Nogo-B/Reticulon, and FATE1 proteins. (D)
  ER-mitochondrion tethering alters mitochondrial lipid composition. Specifically,
  their binding increases cholesterol levels, boosting up aerobic glycolysis and reducing
  Oxphos activity.
