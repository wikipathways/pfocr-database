caption: Schematic of the PG recycling pathway and its role in AmpC β-lactamase induction.
  During growth, GlcNAc-1,6-anhydro-MurNAc tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptides (only the
  tripeptide species is shown) are excised from the PG and transported into the cytoplasm
  via the AmpG permease. The removal of GlcNAc by NagZ produces 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc
  peptide (boxed at the right), and either the tri- or pentapeptide species is believed
  to be responsible for the activation of AmpR to express ampC from the ampC-ampR
  operon. AmpD clears the muropeptide from the cytoplasm by removing the stem peptides
  from both GlcNAc-1,6-anhydro-MurNAc and 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc. These PG degradation
  products are eventually recycled into UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide (boxed at the left),
  a precursor molecule of PG synthesis and a repressor of AmpR. Exposure to β-lactams
  causes an increased cytosolic concentration of the 1,6-anhydro-MurNAc peptide that
  is sufficient to convert AmpR into an activator of ampC transcription.
