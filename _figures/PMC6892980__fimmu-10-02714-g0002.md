caption: Macrophage exposure to Magnéli phases activates gene expression profiles
  associated with apoptosis and mitochondria dysfunction. (A) Gene expression was
  evaluated using real time PCR based Superarrays (Qiagen). For each gene target on
  the array, fold change was calculated based on ΔΔCt values. Genes found to be ±2-fold
  change in expression from untreated specimens were defined as significant. The resultant
  data was evaluated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to define pathways and
  global correlations between gene expression profiles and biological functions. Cell
  death signaling, specifically apoptosis, was the top pathway up-regulated in the
  macrophages following Magnéli phase exposure. IPA further identified gene expression
  profiles consistent with mitochondria dysfunction as a potential factor associated
  with the increased apoptosis signaling. (B) Pathways associated with inflammation
  and specifically inflammation associated cell death (i.e., pyroptosis and necroptosis)
  were significantly down-regulated at the level of gene transcription. Either fold
  change in gene expression or z-score values are displayed for each node as appropriate.
