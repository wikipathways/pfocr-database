caption: A model showing crosstalk between different phytohormones under the influence
  of NaCl and exogenous Kn. Application of salts enhances biosynthesis of ABA and
  JA which antagonize signaling of each other. Enhanced biosynthesis of ABA induces
  the expression of salt-responsive genes. Simultaneously, cytokinin (CKs) signaling,
  along with the biosynthesis of GAs and SA are antagonized in salt stressed plants.
  Application of Kn (a type of CKs) restores CKs signaling by activating transcription
  factors ARRs via its receptors in membrane, i.e., AHKs and downstream response regulators
  AHPs thereby delaying senescence, restoring photosynthesis and enhancing the biosynthesis
  of GAs, SA, and JA accompanied by decline in ABA concentration and signaling. The
  shaded pathway is indicating the biosynthesis of isoflavones in legumes, where the
  expression of two key enzymes, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and isoflavone
  synthase (IFS) is induced by CKs and SA, respectively.
