caption: G protein-coupled receptor subunits Gαq and Gβγi interaction with the Ras-Raf
  pathway. G-proteins are heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins with
  α-, β-, and γ-subunits. When a ligand binds to the extracellular portion of the
  receptor, it confers a guanine nucleotide exchange factor confirmation that induces
  the α-subunit to exchange its bound GDP to GTP. This causes the α-subunit to disassociate
  from the receptor and βγ- subunit. Both the α and βγ subunits effect changes in
  the cell, before the α subunit hydrolyzes the GTP and returns the receptor complex
  to its inactive state [,,,]. Both αq and βγi activate phospholipase C-β (PLCβ) to
  create the second messengers of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate
  (IP3) through the hydrolyzation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  []. DAG activates PKC, which directly phosphorylates and activates Ras proteins
  [,]. IP3 stimulates the calmodulin pathway and Pyk2 kinase by way of inducing calcium
  release from the endoplasmic reticulum []. The resulting phosphorylation provides
  the base for Shc anchoring and recruitment of Ras’ guanine exchange factor complex
  []. Both DAG and IP3 play a role in allosterically controlling CalDAG-GEF1, a guanine
  exchange factor for Rap1 [,]. Once Rap1 has exchanged its bound GDP for GTP, it
  can activate BRaf in the place of Ras []. Furthermore, βγi activates phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K), which augments cell signaling from tyrosine kinase receptors to
  increase Dynamin II [], an additional anchor for Shc and Ras’ GEF complex [,,].
