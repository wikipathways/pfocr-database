caption: Schematic showing biological processes regulated by TGM-2 as well as interactions
  between TGM-2 and muscarinic receptor pathway (analyzed using Pathway Studio 6.0).
  The interaction between TGM-2 and muscarinic receptors becomes involved through
  the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway. These findings suggest that
  TGM-2 may be a mediator of muscarinic receptor signaling, potentially mediating
  some of the muscarinic receptor effects on wound healing or scleral remodeling.
