caption: 'Metabolic model of energy conservation by Desulfomonilia_A DPOMs [adapted
  from Figueroa et al. ()]. Reactions are diagramed in their hypothesized locations
  in relation to the inner membrane (IM) and outer membrane (OM) of a bacterial cell.
  Dashed lines represent mechanisms that have not been biochemically confirmed. Balanced
  equations are provided for phosphite oxidation and CO2 reduction to d-lactate. Dissimilatory
  phosphite oxidation proteins: 1) PtdC, phosphite-phosphate antiporter; 2) PtxDE-PtdFHI,
  putative phosphite dehydrogenase protein complex. CO2 reduction (reductive glycine
  pathway) proteins: 3) FdhAB/FdoGHI, formate dehydrogenase; 4) Fhs, formate:tetrahydrofolate
  (THF) ligase; 5) FolD, methylene-THF dehydrogenase/methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase;
  6) glycine cleavage system (GcvH, lipoyl-carrier protein; GcvPAB, glycine dehydrogenase;
  GcvT, aminomethyltransferase; Lpd, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase); 7) GlyA, serine
  hydroxymethyltransferase; 8) SdaA/IlvA, serine dehydratase/threonine dehydratase;
  9) LdhA, d-lactate dehydrogenase. Energy conversion proteins: 10) ATP synthase complex;
  11) Rnf, sodium-translocating ferredoxin:NAD oxidoreductase complex; 12) NfnAB,
  NAD-dependent ferredoxin:NADP oxidoreductase.'
