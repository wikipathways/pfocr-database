caption: Role of histone lactylation changes in tumor-associated macrophages. During
  tumor development, macrophages exhibit significant phenotypic plasticity. They utilize
  lactate, a key metabolite in the tumor microenvironment (TME), to modify their phenotype
  through histone lactate modifications, influencing tumor progression. In colorectal
  cancer (CRC), tumor-derived lactate inhibits the transcription of the RARγ gene
  in macrophages via H3K18 lactylation, stimulating the TRAF6-IL-6-STAT3 signaling
  pathway to support tumor growth. In prostate cancer, PI3K-inhibited tumor cells
  suppress histone lactylation in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), promoting their
  anti-cancer phagocytic activation. This activation is enhanced by androgen deprivation
  therapy (ADT) combined with anti-PD-1 treatment but is countered by the feedback
  activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Similarly, in glioblastoma (GBM), lactate
  induces H3K18 lactylation in macrophages, upregulating the expression of CD39

  description: Role of histone lactylation changes in tumor-associated macrophages.
    During tumor development, macrophages exhibit significant phenotypic plasticity.
    They utilize lactate, a key metabolite in the tumor microenvironment (TME), to
    modify their phenotype through histone lactate modifications, influencing tumor
    progression. In colorectal cancer (CRC), tumor-derived lactate inhibits the transcription
    of the RARγ gene in macrophages via H3K18 lactylation, stimulating the TRAF6-IL-6-STAT3
    signaling pathway to support tumor growth. In prostate cancer, PI3K-inhibited
    tumor cells suppress histone lactylation in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs),
    promoting their anti-cancer phagocytic activation. This activation is enhanced
    by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with anti-PD-1 treatment but is
    countered by the feedback activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Similarly,
    in glioblastoma (GBM), lactate induces H3K18 lactylation in macrophages, upregulating
    the expression of CD39
