caption: Metabolic influence of oxidative stress on DNA and histone methylationTo
  maintain the correct amount of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the main substrate used
  by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTs), homocysteine
  (Hcy) produced by methylation reactions must be recycled for continuous synthesis
  of SAM. This occurs through interplay between the folate and methionine cycles.
  An excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can inhibit methyl adenosyltransferase
  and increase demand for reduced glutathione produced in the transsulfuration pathway
  that competes for homocysteine, limiting Hcy entry into the methionine cycle. Note
  that several reactions implicated directly and indirectly in the synthesis of SAM
  require micronutrients as enzyme cofactors (arrow dashed lines). 5-CH3THF, methyl-tetrahydrofolate;
  aKG, alfa-ketogluta-rate; CH2THF, methylene-tetrahydrofolate; Cys, cysteine; DHF,
