caption: Components of the purine metabolic pathway []. The de novo synthesis pathway
  uses 5-phosphate ribose (Ribose-5P) as the raw material. It generates phosphoribosyl
  pyrophosphate (PRPP) via phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate kinase (PRS), which then synthesizes
  inosinic acid (IMP) through 10 consecutive reactions catalyzed by various enzymes.
  In the de novo synthesis pathway, IMP is converted into adenylate (AMP), or to xanthosine
  (XMP) and then guanylate (GMP), and finally to ATP and GTP. In the rescue pathway,
  free adenine and guanine in cells synthesize AMP and GMP under the action of adenine
  phosphoribosyltransferase (APT). The purine degradation pathway first converts purine
  nucleotides, such as AMP and GMP, into xanthine by various enzymes. Xanthine is
  finally degraded to produce uric acid.
