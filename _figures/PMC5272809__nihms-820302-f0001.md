caption: The de novo purine biosynthetic pathway in humans consists of 10 highly conserved
  steps (green) that transforms phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generated through
  the pentose phosphate pathway (blue), into inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP). Six enzymes
  catalyze these ten steps and include PRPP amidotransferase (PPAT, EC 2.4.2.14),
  trifunctional phosphoribosylglycinamide synthetase (GARS, EC 6.3.4.13)/phosphoribosylglycinamide
  formyltransferase (GAR Tfase, EC 2.1.2.2)/ phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase
  (AIRS, EC 6.3.3.1) (GART), phosphoribosyl formylglycinamidine synthase (FGAMS, EC
  6.3.5.3), bifunctional phosphoribosyl aminoimidazole carboxylase (CAIRS, EC 4.1.1.21)/phosphoribosyl
  aminoimidazole succinocarboxamide synthetase (SAICARS, EC 6.3.2.6) (PAICS), adenylosuccinate
  lyase (ADSL, EC 4.3.2.2), and bifunctional 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide
  formyltransferase (AICAR Tfase, EC 2.1.2.3)/IMP cyclohydrolase (IMPCH, EC 3.5.4.10)
  (ATIC). Pathway cofactor, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-fTHF) is a product of one-carbon
  metabolism (denoted with a *, for biosynthetic pathway see ). Intermediate SAICAR
  was shown to allosterically activate pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2, EC 2.7.1.40)
  in glycolysis (red) [-]. AICAR is also a byproduct of histidine biosynthesis (purple).
  Downstream purine biosynthesis of IMP requires the use of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH,
  EC 1.1.1.205), GMP synthase (GMPS, EC 6.3.5.2) to make GMP whereas AMP can be generated
  by reactions catalyzed by adenylosuccinate synthase (ADSS, EC 6.3.4.4) and ADSL.
  Purine salvage (orange) can also be used to generate IMP and GMP using hypoxanthine-guanine
  phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT, EC 2.4.2.8) and AMP from adenine phosphoribosyl
  transferase (APRT, EC 2.4.2.7).
