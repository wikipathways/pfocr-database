caption: 'The mechanisms of the miR-449a tumor suppressive function in neuroblastoma
  cells. Our results support that miR-449a functions as a tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma
  through 2 molcular pathways: The cell differentiation pathway, which is mediated
  by down-regulating its direct targets MFAP4, PKP4 and TSEN15; The cell cycle pathway,
  which is mediated by down-regulating its direct targets CDK6 and LEF1. The induced
  cell differentiation and cell cycle arrest will result in reduced cell proliferation
  and increased cell apoptosis, which will lead to tumor growth arrest. However, it
  is possible that miR-449a also targets genes in the cell proliferation and apoptosis
  pathways that are independent of the cell cycle/differentiation-regulating pathways—this
  potential mechanism needs to be further investigated in the future.'
