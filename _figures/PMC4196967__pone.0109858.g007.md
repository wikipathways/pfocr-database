caption: NCL-WT and phosphorylation-deficient mutant (6/S*A) activate p53 checkpoint
  and increase corresponding p21 levels. However, NCL-WT expression allows cells through
  S-phase progression and resumes cell cycle. On the other hand, NCL-6/S*A acts as
  a dominant-negative mutant that negates NCL-WT functions possibly through oligomerization
  causing inhibition of cell proliferation and initiating apoptotic pathway.
