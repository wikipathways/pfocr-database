caption: Synthesis of EPA, DPA and DHA from ALA. The longer chain omega-3 polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFAs) are synthesized from ALA by a progressive series of enzymatic
  desaturation and chain elongation steps, initially in the endoplasmic reticulum.
  In the final stage tetracosahexaenoic acid (24:6n-3) is translocated to the peroxisome
  and is shorted by one cycle of the β-oxidation pathway to form DHA (22:6n-3). For
  further details refer to the text. Figure adapted from Dyall and Michael-Titus ().
