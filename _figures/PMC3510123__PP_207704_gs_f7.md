  and the rate of stomatal opening through its impact on  and  as predicted by the
  OnGuard model (; ). Note that effects on tonoplast transport and on  are not included
  for clarity, but they are complementary (see text). Black arrows indicate the wild
  type, and gray arrows indicate slac1. A, SLAC1 is a major pathway for Cl− efflux
  during stomatal closure and is facilitated when Ca2+ channels activate to raise
  . The K+ channel () and H+-coupled Cl− transport enable osmotic solute uptake during
  opening. B, The slac1 mutation eliminates an inward current (anion efflux), leading
  directly to Cl− and  accumulation and membrane hyperpolarization (1) in the guard
  cell (Supplemental Figs. S1–S3). Membrane hyperpolarization promotes Ca2+ entry
  by activating plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (2) and elevates  (; Supplemental Fig.
  S6), which in turn suppresses  (3; ; Supplemental Fig. S7). Elevated Cl− and  suppress
  H+-coupled Cl− transport (4; see Supplemental Fig. S2) and  synthesis (5; Supplemental
  Fig. S3), thereby reducing the H+ load on the cytosol and raising  (Supplemental
  Fig. S5). The rise in  also suppresses  (6). The predicted increases in , , and
  their consequences for the K+ channels were confirmed experimentally ( and ). C,
  Suppressing the rise in  and  by buffering (7) was sufficient to recover K+ channel
  activity and the rate of stomatal opening, thus validating the model ().
