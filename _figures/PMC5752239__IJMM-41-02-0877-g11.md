caption: Schematic representation of the putative mechanism involved in the transdifferentiation
  from SESCs to CECs. The homeostasis of CECs is maintained by stabilized high PAX6
  expression, which can inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The inhibitory
  effect of PAX6 may be enhanced by NEUROD1 and DOCK9. In SESCs, the expression of
  PAX6 is inhibited by miR-10b and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway together. PAX6,
  miR-10b and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway are the critical factors that predominate
  the transdifferentiate process. CECs, corneal epithelial cells;SESCs, skin epidermal
  stem cells; DOCK9, dedicator of cytokinesis 9; NEUROD1, neuronal differentiation
  1; miR/miRNA, microRNA; PAX6, paired box protein Pax-6; DKK2, Dickkopf-related protein
  2; sFRP, secreted frizzled-related protein.
