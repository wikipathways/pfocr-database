caption: Didymin is involved in lung cancer cell signaling pathways. The main pathway
  of apoptosis of A549 and H460 cells induced by didymin is the Fas/Fas ligand apoptotic
  system. Fas is a cell surface receptor when its ligand (FasL) recognizes and activates
  Fas; it leads to oligomerization of the intracellular death domain and recruitment
  of the intracellular adaptor Fas-associated death domain (FADD). After binding,
  FADD can activate procaspase-8 and procaspase-10 in the death-inducing signaling
  complex, causing A549 and H460 cells apoptosis or death without the mediation of
  p53 and p21/WAF1.
