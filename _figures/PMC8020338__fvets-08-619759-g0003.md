caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway
  in the DH82 cell line treated with B. canis. (A) TLR signaling pathway in 24 h on
  coculture model, (B) TRAF6-associated pathway on TLR signaling pathway, (B) is enlarged
  from a rectangle of (A) genes with upregulation are shown in red, and genes with
  downregulation are shown in green. Orange indicates the predicted activated genes,
  blue indicates the predicted inhibited genes, and an uncolored node indicates that
  the genes were not differentially expressed in this pathway. The IPAs were produced
  using QIAGEN's IPA (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).
  A distinct change in gene expression was observed in the TRAP6-related pathway,
  and the coculture model confirmed that the expression of the related genes was increasing
  gradually.
