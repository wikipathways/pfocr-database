caption: 'Reactions not available at KEGG are highlighted in red. The components of
  suberin, lignin, and waxes are underlined. The C:16 and C:18 fatty acids produced
  in the plastid are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they can be elongated
  and unsaturated, and follow the suberin monomer biosynthesis pathway. Cytochromes
  P450 (CYPs), peroxygenases, epoxy hydroxylases, ω-oxo-fatty acid dehydrogenases,
  and ω-hydroxy-fatty acid dehydrogenases catalyse successive reactions to produce
  the aliphatic monomers. Farnesyl diphosphate, produced from isopentenyl diphosphate
  provided by the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway or by the plastidic methylerythritol
  phosphate (EMP) pathway is used as the initial precursor of steroids in the ER.
  2,3-Epoxysqualene is converted into sterols and terpenoids, monomers of the wax
  component of the phellogen. The phenylpropanoid pathway uses phenylalanine produced
  in the leaf’s chloroplasts, to produce cinnamate. The pathway follows in the cytosolic
  surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, and then in the cytosol, producing the lignin
  monomers. 4CL– 4-Coumarate CoA ligase, AMO: β-amyrin monooxygenase, C3H: p-coumarate
  3-hydroxylase, C4H: cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, CAD: cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase,
  CCR: cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, COMT: Caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, EH: epoxide
  hydroxylase, FDFT: farnesyl diphosphate farnesyltransferase, FS: friedelin synthase,
  HFADH: ω-hydroxy-fatty acid dehydrogenase, LS—lupeol synthase, OFADH: ω-oxo-fatty
  acid dehydrogenase, PAL: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, PO: peroxygenase, SQE: squalene
  monooxygenase. A. thaliana identifiers were used for the nomenclature of CYPs for
  convenience. The IDs of the reactions catalysed by these enzymes can be found in
  Table L in S2 File.'
