caption: Fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition during fibrogenesis, a key event in
  renal fibrogenesis. Following tissue injury, resident macrophages secrete cytokines
  such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 to promote infiltration of more immune cells (such
  as macrophages and neutrophils). Macrophages also release TGF-β1 and ACE, which
  convert Ang I to Ang II, both of which are pro-fibrotic factors that directly promote
  fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation, via a Smad-dependent pathway. Furthermore,
  the balance between the matrix-degrading MMPs and their inhibitors, TIMPs, is dysregulated,
  leading to impaired ECM turnover. In summary, the excessive matrix deposition observed
  in fibrotic kidneys results from a combination of overproduction of ECM proteins
  and defective ECM degradation.
