caption: Schematic representation of poly-P and inositol pyrophosphate structures
  and inositol metabolic pathway. A, minimal structure of a poly-P molecule, with
  n from 1 to a few hundred. When n equals 1, the minimal poly-P is constituted by
  three phosphate residues; therefore, pyrophosphates (two phosphates) are not classified
  as poly-P. B, elongated representation of poly-P to show the bounds targeted by
  endo- and exopolyphosphatases. C, structure of inositol pyrophosphates. IP6Ks, such
  as Kcs1, phosphorylate position 5 of IP6 to generate the isomer 5PP-IP5 (). PP-IP5Ks,
  such as Vip1, are able to phosphorylate position 1 or 3 to generate the isomer (1/3)PP-IP5
  of IP7 (). Note that the 1- and 3-positions (indicated in gray) are enantiomeric
  ring positions and therefore cannot be distinguished by NMR studies. IP6K, using
  IP5 as substrate, is able to phosphorylate position 1/3, generating the isomer (1/3)PP-IP4
  (). D, metabolic pathway of the synthesis and degradation of inositol polyphosphates
  in budding yeast. PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
