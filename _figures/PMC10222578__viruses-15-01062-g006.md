caption: 'Interconnection between sfRNA-affected biological processes in ZIKV-infected
  human brain organoids. Individual networks were reconstructed from sfRNA-affected
  genes related to the most enriched pathways and GO BP terms: Wnt signaling pathway,
  nervous system development, neuron differentiation, axon guidance, brain development,
  regulation of apoptotic processes, p53 signaling pathway, and nucleosome assembly.
  Networks were then merged using the union method and gene names as query keys. The
  resulting network was analyzed to determine betweenness centrality values for the
  nods (visualized as nod size). The logFC values are for ((WT−Mock) − (Mut−Mock))
  comparison.'
