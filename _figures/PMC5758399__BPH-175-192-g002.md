caption: 'Top section: Mechanisms responsible for the cytoprotective and anti‐inflammatory
  effects of PARP inhibitors on non‐oncological diseases. From left to right: First
  subpanel shows PARP activation and consequent NAD+ depletion. These processes can
  lead to cellular energetic deficit and cell dysfunction; inhibition of PARP prevents
  these processes and exerts cytoprotective effects (inhibition of cell necrosis).
  Second subpanel shows the role of PARP activation and free PAR polymers in inducing
  mitochondrial release of apoptosis‐inducing factor (AIF), which in turn induces
  cell death (parthanatos). Inhibition of PARP suppresses these processes and inhibits
  parthanatos. Third subpanel shows the role of PARP in liberating free PAR polymers,
  which on their own exert cytotoxic effects; inhibition of PARP prevents free PAR
  polymer formation and suppresses cell death. Fourth subpanel shows that PARylation
  contributes to activation of the proteasome through an interaction with RNF146;
  PARP inhibitors suppress these processes. Fifth subpanel shows the role of PARP
  in contributing to pro‐inflammatory signal transduction via enhancing JNK‐mediated
  (left sequence) and NF‐κB‐mediated (right sequence) activation of multiple genes
  and gene products. By inhibiting PARP, these processes are attenuated and inflammatory
  signalling can be attenuated. The five scenarios shown here can either be cell‐type
  and stimulus‐ and contex‐ dependent or can also occur simultaneously, depending
  on the pathophysiological condition. Taken together, PARP inhibitors, by blocking
  these processes, protect against cell death and suppress inflammatory responses.
  Bottom section: Mechanisms responsible for the cytotoxic effects of PARP inhibitors
  on oncological diseases. From left to right: The left side of the first subpanel
  shows that PARP contributes to single strand break repair, either through facilitating
  nucleotide excision repair (NER) via interactions with the WD40‐repeat protein DDB2
  and the chromatin remodelling enzyme ALC1. The right side of the first subpanel
  shows that PARP contributes to BER through interaction with a variety of proteins
  including polynucleotide kinase 3′‐phosphatase (PNKP), X‐ray repair cross‐complementing
  1 (XRCC1), aprataxin (APTX), Lig3 (DNA ligase 3) and APLF (a human protein putatively
  involved in DNA damage response). The second subpanel shows the role of PARP in
  DNA strand repair; the left side of this subpanel depicts the interactions of PARP
  with Lig IV (DNA ligase IV) and XRCC4 in the context of NHEJ (nonhomologous end
  joining); the right side of this subpanel depicts the interactions of PARP with
  components of the homologous repair (HR). In this context, PAR is recognized by
  several repair machineries, such as the BRCA1–BARD1 complex, the MRN complex and
  the hSSB1–INTS complex. The third subpanel depicts the role of PARP in the context
  of transcriptional regulation of WNT signalling, a pathway implicated in the process
  of androgen receptor expression. The fourth subpanel depicts the role of PARP in
  the maintenance of telomere length and chromatin stability, and the fifth subpanel
  shows the role of PARP in mitotic spindle formation. By inhibiting these processes,
  PARP inhibitors exert antiproliferative effects and cytotoxic effects, which can
  be exploited, with beneficial effects, in the therapy of various forms of cancers.'
