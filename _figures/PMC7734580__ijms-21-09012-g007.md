caption: Model depicting how Sigma receptor inhibition may induce cell death in cancer
  cells. (a) Cancer cells have to deal with a large load of unfolded proteins due
  to unfavorable microenvironmental conditions. Unfolded proteins are removed by proteasome
  degradation. Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER also induces main UPR sensor
  activation (PERK, IRE1a, ATF6). IRE1 splices XBP1 to an active transcription factor
  that mediates adaptation of the ER to high secretory demand. PERK phoshorylates
  eIF2a which, in turn, activates ATF4, a transcription factor involved in the antioxidant
  response. SRs contribute to cell survival thanks to their chaperone function, stabilizing
  IRE1a and regulating Ca2+ homeostasis through the stabilization of the IP3R3 receptor.
  (b) SR modulators inhibit IRE1a stabilization, causing high ROS generation, and
  impair Ca2+ homeostasis, leading to cytochrome C release and apoptosis induction.
  The inhibition of the pro-survival function of these receptors induces chronic ER
  stress, causing UPR to shift from an adaptation pathway to a cell death signal (terminal
  UPR). The activation of the terminal UPR induces apoptosis mediated by the activation
  of the transcription factor CHOP, leading to cancer cell death.
