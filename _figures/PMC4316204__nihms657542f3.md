caption: A| Ductal elongation and branching of the mammary and submandibular glands.
  Aa | Collagen is locally synthesized and aligned to increase extracellular matrix
  (ECM) stiffness and create a mechanical anisotropy that will drive branching. Collagen
  synthesis is mediated by the activation of the RHOA–RHO-associated protein kinase
  (ROCK) signalling pathway. The ECM at the end bud tip is much thinner than in cleft
  region and around the duct. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP14 are expressed
  and active at the end bud tip, whereas MMP3 is involved inside branching. Ab | Cleft
  formation and deepening in the submandibular glands. Fibronectin is locally assembled
  in the basement membrane and induces BTBD7 at the base of forming clefts, which
  in turn upregulates the transcription factor SNAIL2 and downregulates the adhesion
  molecule E-cadherin. These molecular events promote alterations in cell shape, decreasing
  cell–cell adhesion and promoting a motile phenotype to promote cleft progression.
  Fibronectin assembly requires focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation and RHOA–ROCK-mediated
  actomyosin contraction. B | Role of elastin and collagen deposition in alveolar
  branching in the lung. Elastin and collagen deposition promotes ECM stiffness in
  the neonatal lung and facilitates signalling through the endothelial lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5)–TIE2 (also known as angiopoietin 1 receptor) pathway,
  which is required for normal lung development. Consistent with this, disrupting
  lung collagen I, III and VI and elastin expression and localization through treatment
  with β-aminopropionitrile, an inhibitor of the collagen crosslinking enzyme lysyl
  oxidase (LOX), softens neonatal mouse lung tissue and downregulates the expression
  of LRP5 and TIE2, which leads to an inhibition of vascular and alveolar morphogenesis
  in neonatal mice. Ca | Heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) bind fibroblast growth
  factors (FGFs) with different affinity and help to create a concentration gradient
  that can control cell fate in submandibular glands. In contrast to FGF10, FGF7 binds
  HSPG with low affinity and diffuses broadly, promoting branching in the submandibular
  gland. Cb| HSPGs such as perlecan bind FGF10 with high affinity. Following cleavage
  by heparanase, perlecan releases FGF10, which can then diffuse locally and promote
  duct elongation. FGFR2, FGF receptor 2; MLC, myocin light chain; MYPT, myosin phosphatase.
