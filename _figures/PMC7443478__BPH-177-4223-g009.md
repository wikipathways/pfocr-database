caption: Pathways of facilitation of mGlu1/5 receptor‐mediated pain under inflammatory
  conditions. The increase of TrkA signalling by NGF in inflamed tissue stimulates
  the expression of TRPV1 channels and its scaffolding protein AKAP5, leading to an
  increase in AKAP5‐dependent phosphorylation of TRPV1 protein on S800. The stimulation
  of mGlu1/5 receptors (mGluR1/5) by glutamate and DHPG generates TRPV1‐mediated inward
  current via the PLC‐DAG pathway to directly excite the nociceptive neurons. The
  facilitation of mGlu1/5 receptor‐mediated excitation in nociceptive neurons by endogenous
  glutamate release exacerbates inflammatory pain
