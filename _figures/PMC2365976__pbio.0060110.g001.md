caption: (A) Overview of the mating cycle in C. albicans. White MTLa and MTLα cells
  must switch to the opaque state to undergo mating and formation of a mononuclear
  tetraploid a/α cell. A reduction in ploidy back to the diploid (or near diploid)
  can occur by random chromosome loss.(B) A scheme for selection of diploid progeny
  strains from tetraploids. A tetraploid strain, RBY18, heterozygous for the GAL1
  gene on Chromosome (Chr) 1 and for all four MTL alleles on Chr 5 was constructed
  by mating MTLa and MTLα diploid strains, as shown. After induction of chromosome
  instability, strains that had undergone a reduction in ploidy were selected for
  by growth on 2-deoxygalactose (2-DOG) medium, as only strains that have lost the
  GAL1 gene are able to grow on medium containing 2-DOG. Progeny strains were subsequently
  analyzed by PCR of the MTL locus and by flow cytometric analysis to confirm they
  were diploid strains. Strains were then analyzed by SNP and CGH microarrays to determine
  their genetic content.
