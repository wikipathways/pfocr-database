caption: 'Simplified schematic of different metabolites and processes in the brain
  that can be interrogated using 1H MRS, 31P MRS, 13C MRS, and DNP 13C MRS. 1H and
  31P MRS show endogenous metabolites; 13C MRS requires exogenous 13C-enriched substrate,
  while for DNP 13C MRS the exogenous 13C-enriched substrate is hyperpolarized before
  administration, transiently boosting 13C signal. Pathways include uptake of glucose
  that is metabolized via glycolysis in the cytosol [with a low yield of ATP per mole
  of glucose consumed] producing pyruvate. Pyruvate can enter mitochondria where it
  is converted into acetyl-CoA that enters the TCA cycle. Pyruvate remaining in the
  cytosol can be converted into lactate, simultaneously recycling NADH into NAD+ allowing
  glycolysis to continue. The rate of glucose uptake and glycolysis can be interrogated
  with 13C MRS (glucose and lactate appearance) whereas the relative flux of “anaerobic”
  metabolism vs. aerobic mitochondrial metabolism can be measured with DNP 13C MRS
  (lactate vs. ) and 1H MRS (lactate). The TCA cycle drives the mitochondrial electron
  transport chain for high-yield ATP synthesis. The rate of the TCA cycle can be calculated
  by the rate of appearance of 13C labeled glutamate (Glu) (13C MRS) and ATP produced
  measured with 31P MRS (γ-ATP, β-ATP, and Pi). Neuronal integrity and mitochondrial
  function can be measured indirectly by detection of NAA with 1H MRS (and 13C MRS).
  Neuronal–glial coupling is represented by Glu–glutamine (Gln) cycling detected by
  13C MRS, whereas total combined Glu and Gln that may be raised in pathological excitotoxicity
  can be measured with 1H MRS. Cell membrane integrity and damage and turnover may
  be represented by 1H MRS (choline and lipid) and 31P MRS (PME/PDE ratio), which
  also can detect the balance and consumption of high-energy phosphates (ATP, PCr,
  and Pi). Further details of the above, and other MRS-detectable molecules (including
