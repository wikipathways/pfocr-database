caption: '(A) Schematic diagram of LPS clearance: LPS entering the systemic circulation
  binds to HDL in the blood to form an LPS–HDL complex. This complex circulates through
  the bloodstream and binds to endocytosis receptors on the surface of LSECs, primarily
  stabilized proteins. It is then transported intracellularly to lysosomes, where
  the LPS clearance effect is exerted. (B) Schematic diagram of the TLR4 signaling
  pathway: LPS entering the systemic circulation binds to LBP in the blood to form
  a complex. This complex interacts with TLR4 receptors on the surface of LSECs, activating
  the signaling pathway. When the MYD88 pathway is activated, it interacts with the
  downstream NF-KB pathway, promoting the release of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. When
  the TRIF pathway is activated, it stimulates the release of proteins such as selectins,
  ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, influencing the progression of inflammatory responses'
