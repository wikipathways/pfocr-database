caption: Nucleotide-linked sugars (not shown) are used to build the PG precursor lipid
  II and the O-antigen precursor Und-PP-O-antigen on the membrane-bound lipid carrier
  Und-P. The first Und-P glycosyltransferase in each respective pathway are MraY (not
  shown) and WecA. After each Und-PP-linked intermediate is synthesized in the inner
  leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, flippases MurJ and Wzk translocate them across
  the bilayer. At the periplasmic leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, the disaccharide-pentapeptide
  component of lipid II is used to build glycan chains that are crosslinked into the
  preexisting PG matrix, while the O polysaccharide portion of Und-PP-O-antigen is
  transferred onto LPS molecules by the WaaL ligase (not shown). After these steps,
  the lipid carrier is recycled (green dotted arrows). The O polysaccharide is composed
  of N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc, grey hexagon labeled G), galactose (green squares),
  and fucose (orange triangles); the disaccharide in lipid II is composed of N-acetyl
  muramic acid (MurNAc, black hexagon labeled M) and GlcNAc (grey hexagon labeled
  G), while the pentapeptide is composed of L-Ala (light blue circle), D-Glu (green
  circle), meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid (meso-A2pm, red circle) and two D-Ala (dark
  blue circle) residues.
