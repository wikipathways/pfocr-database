caption: 'Model for the proposed role of TgACS1 in extracellular parasites: metabolic
  activation of fatty acids through PTS1-based re-localization in peroxisomal-like
  patches allowing parasite motility by putatively fueling parasite β-oxidation pathway.
  Inactivated FAs from the extracellular environment, the host, and/or de novo made
  by the parasite are incorporated into the glycerolipid pathway of the parasite to
  form TAGs, which are stored in parasite lipid droplets. When TgACS1 is present with
  its predicted PTS1 sequence, the protein relocates in peroxisomal-like structure/patch
  where it likely fuels the parasite β-oxidation to provide energy and allow parasite
  motility by activating parasite fatty acids from any source (central part of the
  diagram). Upon the depletion of TgACS1 in extracellular parasites, parasite lipid
  droplet levels increase, while there is a significant decrease in FFA levels, leading
  to a significant reduction in parasite motility (right side of the diagram). When
  TgACS1 is lacking its PTS1 (TgACS1ΔPTS), there is a milder increase in LD number
  than without TgACS1. The pool of TgACS1 lacking its PTS is found scattered throughout
  the parasite’s cytosol, preventing the protein to activate FA in bulk at peroxisomal-like
  patches.'
