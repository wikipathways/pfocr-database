caption: Model predictions of the central metabolism inferred from Izimaplasma genomes.
  Both genomes illustrate the potential for metabolizing a variety of simple sugar
  compounds that feed into the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas glycolysis pathway (symbolized
  by black circles). Reducing equivalents (NADH) generated through glycolysis can
  be oxidized either by the conversion of acetate to ethanol, using a membrane-bound,
  sodium-pumping NADH:Ferredoxin oxidoreductase (RNF complex) or by a proton-pumping
  NADH:Quinone oxidoreductase (complex I). Both complex I and the cytochrome bd oxidase
  interact with the quinone pool, however no quinone synthesis genes were identified
  in the genome. Two types of hydrogenases act in catabolism to regenerate oxidized
  ferredoxin, or in anabolism to regenerate NADPH used during lipid and nucleotide
  synthesis. Izimaplasma sp. HR2 contains a protein microcompartment that links the
  degradation of DNA or RNA to the production of acetyl-CoA and intermediates of glycolysis.
  2DR5P, 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
