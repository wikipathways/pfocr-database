caption: 'A model for the apoptotic signaling pathway mediated by NGF withdrawal.
  Removal of the survival agent, NGF, activates the small GTPase Cdc42. Activated
  Cdc42 leads to the activation of ASK1 and MLK3. Activation of MLK3 requires two
  steps: dimerization (1) and autophosphorylation (2); then it translocates to the
  plasma membrane. Activation of ASK1 and/or MLK3 leads to an increase in JNK activity
  via the formation of a multiprotein complex. Phosphorylation of c-Jun activates
  its transcriptional activity, which then turns on the transcription of genes that
  are necessary for neuronal apoptosis to proceed.'
