caption: TGF-β signaling pathway. Activated TGF-β ligands with or without αVβ8 integrins
  bind at serine/threonine protein kinase type II receptors, sometimes with the assistance
  of the co-receptors such as endoglin. The type II receptors subsequently phosphorylate
  type I receptors to form a tetrameric receptor complex, which subsequently phosphorylates
  the SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8 to form a trimeric complex with SMAD4
  in cytoplasm. The SMAD complex then translocates into nucleus and binds at special
  loci under the guidance of the SDTFs and LDTFs to initiate the transcriptional response.
  Besides, TRIM33, a modulator of TGF-β signaling, is able to regulate chromatin accessibility
  and remodeling. In addition to the canonical TGF-β signaling, there are SMAD-independent
  pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK and MKK/JNK/MAPK downstream of the TGF-β receptors.
  TGF-β signaling is negatively regulated at multiple levels. Various ligand traps
  (noggin, chordin, follistatin, gremlin, coco, and cerberus) can prevent TGF-β ligands
  from binding to receptors, while FKBP12 and BAMBI can dock at cytoplasmic domain
  of TGF-β type I receptors to inhibit TGF-β signaling. In addition, inhibitory SMADs
  including SMAD6 and SMAD7 play a critical function in suppressing the SMAD-mediated
  signaling.
