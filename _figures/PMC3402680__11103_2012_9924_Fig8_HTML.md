caption: Regulatory changes in the pathway of plant hormone signal transduction between
  female and male flowers. Colored rectangles correspond to genes involved in the
  pathway. Up-regulated genes (red) in female flowers and those participated in the
  pathway present in Arabidopsis but undetected in our data (jade-green) are indicated
