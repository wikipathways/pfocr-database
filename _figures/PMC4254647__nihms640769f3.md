caption: FA/BRCA DNA damage response pathway. Following DNA damage, the proteins represented
  by A, B, C, E, F, G, L and M form the core complex, which is required for ubiquitination
  of the I and D2 proteins, which are in turn required for the downstream complex
  of D2-ubi, I-ubi, and D1/BRCA2, J/BRIP1, N/PALB2, BRCA1, O/RAD51C, P/SLX4, Q/ERCC4,
  and BRCA1 to form DNA repair foci. Only BRCA1 has not yet been proven to be a Fanconi
  gene. Adapted from Shimamura and Alter [].Reprinted from Blood Reviews, Volume 24/Edition

  failure syndromes, Pages 101-22, 2010, with permission from Elsevier.
