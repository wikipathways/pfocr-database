caption: Mucosal Immunity in IgAN and the Role of HCQ. In patients with IgAN, accumulated
  uremic toxins promote the release of inflammatory substances, alter intestinal permeability,
  and impair intestinal epithelial tight junctions. Consequently, pathogens have an
  increased likelihood of crossing the intestinal mucosal barrier. LPS on the bacterial
  surface specifically activates the TLR4 signaling pathway, which generates IL-6,
  IFN-α, and IFN-β via the MyD88-NF-κB and MyD88-IRF7 pathways. Intracellular TLRs
  TLR9 and TLR7 are also present. The endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes intact TLR9/7
  molecules. TLR9/7 exit the endoplasmic reticulum, traverse the Golgi apparatus,
  and reach the lysosome. In the lysosome, their ectodomains are cleaved and hydrolyzed,
  forming signaling-competent TLR9/7 molecules. Upon activation by ligands, TLR9 engages
  two signaling pathways, MyD88-NF-κB and MyD88-IRF7. In contrast, TLR7 activation
  leads to IL-6 production exclusively through the MyD88-NF-κB signaling pathway.
  IL-6 up-regulates APRIL, promotes Th17 cells production and inhibits the Cosmc gene
  expression. In the presence of Cosmc, C1GALT1 transfers β-galactose to 1,3-GalNAc
  via the UDP-galactose transporter, facilitating IgA1 formation. However, LPS and
  IL-6 inhibit Cosmc expression and decrease expression and activity of C1GALT1, decreasing
  the transfer of β-galactose to 1,3-GalNAc on IgA1. This results in an elevated level
  of Gd-IgA1, exacerbating the immune response and establishing a vicious cycle. HCQ
  repairs intestinal epithelial tight junctions, safeguards the junctional proteins
  ZO-1 and Occludin, and restricts pathogen translocation across the intestinal barrier.
  Additionally, HCQ inhibits lysosomal acidification, blocking the cleavage of the
  ectodomains of TLR9/7. It also prevents the binding of TLR9/7 to their ligands.
  At a concentration of 30 µM, HCQ completely suppresses the TLR-MyD88-NF-κB and TLR-MyD88-IRF7
  signaling pathways. IgAN, IgA nephropathy; HCQ, hydroxychloroquine; Gd-IgA1, galactose-deficient
