caption: The Polistes life cycle incorporates fundamental elements of the bivoltine
  ground plan. Larvae respond during development to a food cue and diverge onto one
  of two trajectories. Scanty provisioning leads to the G1 pathway, which is signaled
  by slow larval development (due to low nutrient inflow), short pupation time (),
  and no storage protein residuum in emerging adults (). More abundant provisioning
  leads to more rapid larval development, longer pupation time (, ), and residual
  storage protein in emerging G2 adults (). G1 females have a “reproduce now” phenotype,
  and they forage for protein, care for the brood, and construct nests. The expression
  of these behaviors is conditional, as indicated by branching points in the G1 sequence.
  If the queen is lost, a G1 female can develop her ovaries, mate if males are present,
  and become a replacement queen. If a queen is present but the number of workers
  is low, a G1 female will alloparentally express maternal behaviors (i.e., nest construction,
  nest defense, brood care, and foraging) as a worker at her natal nest. Finally,
  if a queen is present and the number of workers is high, a G1 female may depart
  the natal nest and found a satellite nest in midseason. Because the cold tolerance
  of G1 females is low, they do not survive quiescence, and lifetimes are short. In
  contrast, G2 females have a “reproduce later” phenotype. They express no maternal
  behaviors the first year, but after emerging from quiescence, they break reproductive
  diapause and shift to the reproduce now phenotype.
