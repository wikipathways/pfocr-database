caption: Cross control between Wnt and TGF-β in part through Runx2 in osteoblasts.
  A model based on results from these studies proposes that, in differentiating osteoblasts,
  Wnt pathway induction stabilizes β-catenin and increases TCF/LEF-dependent gene
  expression in parallel with β-catenin-independent complex formation between TCF-4
  and Runx2. Activation of either Runx2 or TCF-4 coenhances TCF and Runx2 activity
  and increases TβRI expression. Imposed on this, Wnt pathway induction has complex,
  stimulatory, and inhibitory effects on TGF-β activity. Specific downstream genes
  regulated by these individual or combined effects on the TCF, AP-1, or Smad nuclear
  factors await further studies. APA, Alkaline phosphatase activity.
