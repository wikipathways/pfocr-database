caption: 'Routes for the in vivo production of glyceraldehyde (GA)/methylglyoxal (MGO).
  The glycolytic intermediate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P) is generally catabolized
  (glycolysis) by the enzyme GA3P dehydrogenase (GAPDH). However, decreases in the
  enzymatic activity of GAPDH result in the intracellular accumulation of GA3P. As
  a consequence, GA3P is metabolized via an alternative pathway, which increases the
  concentration of GA. Fructokinase phosphorylates fructose to fructose 1-phosphate
  (F1P), which is then converted into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and GA by
  aldolase B (fructolysis). MGO is mainly produced as a byproduct of non-enzymatic
  reactions with GA3P or DHAP during glycolysis. The most effective MGO metabolic
  pathway is the glyoxalase system, which converts MGO to D-lactate. G6P: glucose
  6-phosphate; F6P: fructose 6-phosphate; F1,6DP: fructose 1,6-diphosphate; AR: aldose
  reductase; SDH: sorbitol dehydrogenase; FK: fructokinase; GLO1: glyoxalase 1; GLO2:
  glyoxalase 2.'
