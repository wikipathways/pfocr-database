caption: Modulation of the MyD88 and TRIF signaling pathways and downstream responses
  by the protein-based adjuvants rSIP and FLH in APCs. (A) FLH interacts with mannose
  receptors and activates the TLR4 signaling pathway, which recruits MyD88 and TRIF.
  FLH activates NF-kB and IRF. MyD88 recruitment is involved in the expression of
  the IL-6, CD80, IFIT-1, and CD86 mRNAs, while TRIF is involved in the expression
  of IL-6 and IP-10. Regarding the secretion of cytokines, only TRIF is involved in
  the secretion of IL-6 and IP-10. FLH then promotes OVA cross-presentation, and its
  effect is dependent on MyD88 and TRIF. (B) rSIP activates the TLR4 signaling pathway,
  which recruits MyD88 and TRIF. rSIP activates NF-kB and IRF. MyD88 recruitment is
  involved in expression of the IL-6, COX-2, CD80, IFIT-1, and CD86 mRNAs, while TRIF
  is involved in the expression of IL-6, COX-2, and IP-10. Regarding the secretion
  of cytokines, both MyD88 and TRIF are involved in the secretion of IL-6 and IP-10.
  rSIP then promotes OVA cross-presentation, and its effect is dependent on MyD88
  and TRIF.
