caption: Ras inhibition by FTS acts differently on Foxp3 expression in immune cells
  and in cancer cells. In immune cells, Ras regulates Foxp3 expression via the MAPK
  pathway. Its inhibition results in upregulation of Foxp3 expression, thereby augmenting
  Foxp3+regulatory T cells (Tregs) [-]. The upregulated CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs induce an
  anti-inflammatory effect by secreting tolerogenic cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-β,
  which attenuate the proliferation of effector T cells and thus help to maintain
  immune tolerance []. In the glioma cancer cells, Ras regulates Foxp3 expression
  via both the MAPK and the PI3K pathways. Treatment of the cancer cells with FTS
  results in downregulation of Foxp3, which in turn attenuates expression of the immunosuppressive
  cytokine TGF-β from glioma cells. A similar effect of Foxp3 on TGF-β expression
  levels has been demonstrated in melanoma cells []. The decrease in TGF-β produces
  an inflammatory tumor microenvironment, which promotes robust proliferation, migration,
  and activation of antitumor CTLs. This effect on the CTLs intensifies their antitumor
  character, resulting in decreased tumor growth.
