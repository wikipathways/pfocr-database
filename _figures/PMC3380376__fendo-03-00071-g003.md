caption: The relationship between binding of ligands to the pattern recognition AGE
  receptor (RAGE) and inflammation, gene expression, oxidative and nitrosative stress,
  and damage to the macro- and microvasculature. Elevated levels of glucose bind to
  proteins and form AGEs, which bind to RAGEs. RAGE signaling activates NADPH oxidase
  and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased ROS increases advanced
  oxidation protein products (AOPPs), more AGEs, and AGE-modification of oxidized
  LDLs (oxLDLs). Furthermore, increased ROS may deplete glutathione, thereby suppressing
  glyoxalase I activity, a mechanism favoring further AGE accumulation. AGEs, AOPPs,
  macrophage glycoprotein (MAC-1), and AGE-oxLDL ligands of RAGE sustain stimulation
  of RAGE, and these processes, together with increased ROS, activate key transcription
  factors such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and Egr-1, which increase gene transcription
  factors and activate inflammatory mechanisms. Consequences include increased migration
  and activation of RAGE-expressing neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, T-cells, and
  dendritic cells. This results in the release of the pro-inflammatory RAGE ligands
  S100/calgranulins and high-mobility group protein box-1 (HMGB1). In this inflammatory
  environment, further AGEs may be formed as well. Via interaction with RAGE, these
  ligands magnify activation of NF-κB, Agr-1, and other factors, thereby amplifying
  cellular stress and tissue damage leading to neurovascular dysfunction. Soluble
  RAGE (sRAGE) is formed from the cleavage of RAGE by disintegrins such as ADAM 10,
  a metalloproteinase, and β- and γ-secretases. sRAGE or a spliced variant (esRAGE)
  compete for binding of ligands to RAGE, and a deficiency could theoretically initiate
  the sequence of events activating an inflammatory cascade with an increase in the
  expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [E-selectin, endothelin-1 tissue factor,
  vascular endothelial growth factor, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6
  and tumor necrosis factor-α)] and damage to neurons, kidney, eye, the vasculature,
  and even bone. Increasing sRAGE or its administration could competitively reduce
  activation of the AGE/RAGE pathway and it consequences. In addition endogenous and
  exogenous ligands bind to Toll-like receptors (TLR) also targeting NF-KB as well
  as inducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines which activate afferent
  sensory neurons reaching the brainstem via axons in the vagus. This in turn activates
  the cholinergic anti-inflammatory efferent arc which inhibits response in cytokine
  producing immune cells and signal through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit
  α7 (α7nACHR). This in turn inhibits NF-κB activation. Thus the pathways of AGE/RAGE
  activation of the inflammatory cascade and the inflammatory ligands target activation
  of an inflammatory cascade that can be abrogated by either competing with the binding
  of ligands to RAGE or by vagal activation of the anti-inflammatory reflex. Thus
  central to curtailing unbridled activation of the inflammatory cascade is the integrity
  of parasympathetic autonomic function or balance between the two arms of the autonomic
  nervous system.
