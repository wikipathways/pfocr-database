caption: WWOX/WOX1 and signaling networks. (A) A schematic structure of WWOX/WOX1
  (414 amino acids; molecular size 46 kDa) is shown. Two N-terminal WW domains are
  encoded by exon 1–4 of the WWOX gene, and the ADH/SDR domain by exon 4–8. There
  is a NLS (nuclear localization signal) between the two WW domains, and a NSYK motif
  in the ADH/SDR domain. The C-terminal tail D3 domain possesses an apoptotic function.
  The conserved phosphorylation sites are indicated [–]. (B) WWOX interacts with binding
  proteins via PPXY motifs. Protein of these categories are p73, activator protein
  2γ (AP-2γ), ErbB4, ezrin, small integral membrane protein of the lysosome/late endosome
  (SIMPLE), c-Jun [–]. WWOX is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the HGF (hepatocyte
  growth factor)/MET pathway. WWOX acts synergistically with p53 to mediate apoptosis,
  and that JNK and Zfra block the effect. Complement C1q induces an unconventional
  apoptosis of prostate cancer cells [, , ]. WWOX prevents neurodegeneration by inhibiting
  Tau hyperphosphorylation caused by ERK and GSK-3β [, , ]. Hyaluronidase Hyal-2 acts
  as a receptor for TGF-β1. During signaling, WWOX is activated and binds Smad4 and
  the protein complex is accumulated in the nucleus, which may lead to cell survival
  or death [, , ].
