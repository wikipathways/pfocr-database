caption: (A) Schematic representation of the oxidation of 2-Cys Prx by H2O2 and potential
  oxidation and activation of target proteins by Prx*. H2O2 oxidises the peroxidatic
  cysteine free thiol of Prx to sulphenic acid. A condensation reaction occurs between
  CP and CR of different Prx molecules to form disulphide bridges leading to the formation
  of Prx homodimers (a). Oxidised Prx in the sulphenic form can also be further oxidised
  by excess H2O2 leading to the formation of sulphinic or sulphonic acids, a process
  termed hyperoxidation (b). Oxidised Prx in the dimeric form can be reduced back
  to the monomer by thioredoxins (Trx) (indicated in dark grey) which become oxidised
  and subsequently recycled back to the reduced form by thioredoxin reductases (TrxR)
  with oxidation of NADPH (c). Oxidised Prx in the dimeric form can alternatively
  interact with reduced Cys in target proteins (indicated in blue) forming mixed dimers
  as part of a redox signalling pathway. In this latter process the oxidising equivalent
  is transferred to the target protein, potentially leading to activation of downstream
  pathways. The Prx is itself reduced, and reverts to the monomeric form (d).(B) Example
  of a non-reducing Western blot used to identify the Prx monomers and dimers showing
  the 2 forms of Prx3 identified using this technique.*Note, the schematic illustrates
  oxidation of Prx as observed using non-reducing gels for detection since oligomeric
  Prx decamers/dodecamers are not seen using this method. (For interpretation of the
  references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version
