caption: Overactivation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway in mutant HRAS (mtHRAS)
  astrocytes (green) results in both early Ras-specific gliogenesis and an extracellular
  response, which can be in part reduced by FTI-277 and SNAI2 knockdown. Subsequently,
  extracellular matrix remodeling occurs and leads to an experience-independent accumulation
  of PNNs surrounding inhibitory cortical neurons (gray), which may possibly alter
  critical period plasticity.
