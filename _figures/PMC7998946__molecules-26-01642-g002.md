caption: Metabolism of activated T cell and the effect of cancer-induced tumor microenvironment
  (TME) acidification on T cell response. High glycolytic cancer cells strongly consume
  glucose available in the TME and in return they produce massive quantities of lactate.
  TME acidification and lack of nutrients, together with the higher cancer-dependent
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, impair the activation of T effector cells.
  T cell activation requires higher level of glucose to support an increased glycolytic
  rate, and the derived metabolites are also needed for pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) and lipidic synthesis. Red arrows indicate the effects of altered cancer metabolism
  on T cell activity and black arrows indicate the involved pathway in T cell activation.
