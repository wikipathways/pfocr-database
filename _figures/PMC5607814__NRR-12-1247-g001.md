  to form a complex with NgR1 and P75/TROY (Mi et al., 2004; Ahmed et al., 2013).
  This enables the complex to activate when bound to the myelin derived proteins,
  Nogo, OMgp and MAG. Myelin derived protein binding permits the activation of RhoA
  by local RhoGDI. Activated RhoA induces ROCK signaling leading to the activation
  of cytosolic LIMK and myosin light chain (MLC) on actin filaments. LIMK inhibits
  cofilin resulting in actin depolymerization (Fujita and Yamashita, 2014). MLC activation
  also leads to a shortening of the actin filaments. These effects are likely to promote
  growth cone. A similar pathway could function in oligodendroglia as actin filaments
  are involved with the cell cycle and production of processes required to initiate
  contact with neurons (Lourenco and Graos, 2016). Both LINGO-1 and AMIGO3 can bind
  homophilically (Kuja-Panula et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2006). In the case of LINGO-1,
  this has been shown to increase RhoA signaling and it is likely that AMIGO3 could
  mediate a similar response (Jepson et al., 2012). AMIGO3: Amphoterin-induced gene
  and open reading frame-3; GTP: guanosine-5′-triphosphate; LIMK: LIM-kinase gene;
  LINGO-1: LRR and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing protein 1; MAG: myelin associated
  glycoprotein; NgR1: neurite outgrowth inhibitor-66 receptor 1; Nogo: neurite outgrowth
  inhibitor; OMgp: oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein; RhoA: Ras homolog gene family
  member A; RhoGDI: Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor; ROCK: coiled-coil containing protein
  kinase; TROY: tumor necrosis factor receptor family member.'
