caption: Hypothetical time course of the unfolded protein response in mammals. It
  has been proposed that the translation repression by PERK and IRE1-dependent decay
  (RIDD) occur early in response to ER stress, followed by ATF6-induced upregulation
  of ERQC and ERAD related genes. The upregulation of UPR target genes by XBP1 and
  PERK-ATF4 occurs next, since the activation of XBP1 and ATF4 themselves also require
  de novo protein synthesis. The responses in all three arms of the UPR undergo attenuation
  after the onset of stress, even under continuous stress conditions. While the IRE1
  response attenuates quickly within eight hours through phosphatase-regulated IRE1
  dephosphorylation, the ATF6 activation response lasts for about 20 h and, then,
  is suppressed by its own induced NUCB1 and WFS1. On the other hand, the PERK-mediated
  response persists even after 30 h and finally attenuates through eIF2α dephosphorylation
  regulated by GADD34/P58IPK, which are also induced by the PERK pathway itself.
