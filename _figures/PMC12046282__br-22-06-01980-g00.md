caption: After CNPs enter cells through endocytosis, they induce the expression of
  TNF-α and BMP2. Specifically, TNF-α enhances RUNX2 expression by regulating the
  transcription factors MSX2 and AP-1, while BMP-2 activates the XBP1 signaling pathway,
  both contributing to osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, CNPs stimulate ROS
  production, which activates STAT3 and other pathways, further promoting osteogenic
  differentiation. On the other hand, CNPs can disrupt cell membrane stability, alkalize
  lysosomes, and stimulate mitochondria to produce excessive ROS, leading to damage
  in cellular structures such as the cell membrane, mitochondria, and lysosomes. The
  generated ROS not only activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and initiate the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, causing inflammatory damage, but also trigger autophagy and apoptosis via
  the ROS-JNK signaling pathway. During apoptosis, CNPs facilitate the aggregation
  of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and extracellular matrix, forming a calcification
  core. Apoptotic cells release matrix vesicles containing CNPs, which damage surrounding
  cells, expand the inflammatory response, and promote continuous expansion of the
  calcification core, ultimately resulting in pathological calcification. CNPs, calcified
  nanoparticles; RUNX2, dwarf-related transcription factor 2; MSX2, homeobox transcription
  factor muscle segment homeobox 2; AP-1, activator protein 1; XBP1, X-box binding
  protein 1; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; BMP2, bone morphogenic
