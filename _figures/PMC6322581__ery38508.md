caption: A working model for ADFs involved in the regulatory network between ABA signaling
  and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. ABA/drought activates downstream kinases such
  as CKL2, which phosphorylate ADFs (ADF1/2/3/4) and repress their actin severing/depolymerizing
  activity. This cascade disrupts actin cytoskeleton dynamics and subsequently inhibits
  stomatal closure via post-translational modification (PTM). Transcriptional regulation
  (TR) may be complementary to the ABA signaling pathway for the activity of ADFs
  during stomatal movement. Transcription factors (TFs) such as AREB/ABFs up-regulate
  the expression of ADF5, which stabilizes actin filaments to promote stomatal closure.
  Additional ADFs (ADF1/2/3/4/6) may also be involved in ABA-regulated stomatal closure
  via TR.
