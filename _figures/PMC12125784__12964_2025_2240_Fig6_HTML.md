caption: Working model. Pharmacological activation of AMPK promotes mitochondrial
  fission via the mTOR pathway, as siRNA targeting TSC2 reverses the mitochondrial
  changes induced by AICAR. AMPK activation through AICAR or nutrient deprivation
  impairs mitochondrial connectivity and function. Similarly, rapamycin-induced mTORC1
  inhibition alters mitochondrial phenotype and reduces oxidative capabilities. Constitutively
  active mTORC1 (via TSC2 silencing) prevents AMPK-induced changes in mitochondrial
  morphology and function, highlighting mTOR’s key role in this pathway. Additionally,
  mTOR inhibition by rapamycin significantly reduces phosphorp70S6K levels and promotes
  mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction in cultured rat cardiomyocytes. Genetic
  interventions with siRNAs targeting Oma1 and TSC2 and mTOR knockout mice confirmed
  mTOR’s role in inducing mitochondrial fragmentation through OPA-1 processing. Rapamycin
  treatment also increased ubiquitinated PHB1 levels. Prohibitin proteins are crucial
  for mitochondrial fragmentation under rapamycin-induced stress, and this regulation
  of Prohibitins and mitochondrial morphology changes in cardiomyocytes is intricately
  linked to their metabolic status, driven by AMPK activation and mTOR signaling
