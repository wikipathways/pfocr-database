caption: Anabolic pathway of renal sulfatides. SL synthesis starts out at the endoplasmic
  reticulum with the condensation of serine and a long chain acyl-CoA, in most cases
  palmitoyl-CoA. This is also the rate-limiting step, regulated by ORMDL proteins
  (ORM1-like proteins). After reduction of 3-keto-sphinganine to sphinganine, condensation
  with a variety of acyl-CoAs yields dihydroceramides, which are modified by dihydroceramid-Δ4-desaturase
  (Des)1 or Des2 to result in Cers or phyto-Cers, respectively, by that creating the
  huge diversity of Cer anchors found in renal sulfatides SM4s and SM3. Gray areas
  mark the structural changes in the molecules caused by the previous enzymatic step.
  3-KSa-red., 3-ketosphinganine reductase; Sms 1 and 2, sphingomyelin synthase 1 and
  2; LacCer-synthase, lactosylceramide synthase; Ugcg, UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase.
