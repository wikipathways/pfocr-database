caption: 'Potential generation and maintenance phases of the metabolic alkalosis that
  may develop from a secretory villous adenoma. (A) Generation phase from colonic
  losses. Normal colonic mucosa features two cell types: the predominant cell is the
  absorptive cell. Dysfunction of the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger in absorptive cells or activation
  of the chloride efflux pathway via cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
  in secretory cells could result in significant stool chloride losses. (B) Maintenance
  phase in the kidney. Kidney tubular response to volume depletion. Angiotensin II
  (Ang II) promotes reabsorption especially in the proximal tubule by activating the
  sodium hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) antiporter. Hypokalemia promotes production and
  excretion of ammonium, which perpetuates the alkalosis. In the distal nephron, there
  is little remaining sodium and chloride delivery. Elevated intracellular pH activates
  pendrin, an apical Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, but there is insufficient chloride available
  for exchange with bicarbonate, thus preventing reversal of the alkalosis.'
