caption: Summary of genetic and pharmacological evidence implicating Wnt signaling
  in developmental cognitive disorders. This diagram depicts the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway which consists of Wnt binding to the Frizzled-LRP5/6 co-receptor complex
  and inhibiting the disassembly of the destruction complex which results in stabilized
  β-catenin levels, translocation to the nucleus, and initiation of Wnt-dependent
  gene transcription. Several genes in the canonical Wnt pathway are also identified
  as high-risk genes associated with autism and intellectual disability (CHD8, DDX3X,
  and TCF4). Furthermore, listed are a number of pharmacological agents and drugs
  that target Wnt signaling molecules and can modulate the pathway. Many of the genes
  listed are shared between different upstream ligand-receptor pathways
