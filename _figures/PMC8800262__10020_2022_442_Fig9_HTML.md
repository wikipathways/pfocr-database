caption: The mechanism by which eriodictyol inhibits AD. Eriodictyol alleviated cognitive
  injury by preventing neuronal ferroptosis, and its mechanism may be associated with
  VDR-mediated activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Eriodictyol up-regulated VDR expression
  and then activated the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway by promoting the phosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, thus regulating the expression of proteins related
  to ferroptosis
