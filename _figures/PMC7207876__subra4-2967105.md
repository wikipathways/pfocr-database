caption: 'Fingerprint global chromatin profiling in breast cancer signaling. The crosstalk
  among histone signature pathways is depicted by linking inferred proteins/protein
  complexes generated from STRINGdb PPI for signaling pathways that may interact with
  the CDK pathway in cancer signaling landscape. As part of cell cycle regulation,
  inhibition of CDK by flavopiridol and dinaciclib is highlighted showing molecular
  cascades of interactions among BRD4, NSD3, SRRM2, NOLC1, MYC with the P-TEFb complex
  and its recruitment to promoter region to block transcriptional elongation of RNA
  Pol II (the first blue dashed oval). As a consequence, reduced levels of H3K27me3K36me3,
  H3K4me1, and H3K4me2 are observed. Examples of crosstalk includes: Ikkb inhibiting
  TPX2 which binds to AURKA to activate CDK targeting the intrinsic kinase activity
  directed towards RNA Pol II (pink dashed oval); reduction of Map3K7 brings JNK level
  down resulting in an increase of H3K56me2 level; hyperactive RAS acts as a signaling
  switch to convert JNK''s role from pro- to anti-tumor signaling through the regulation
  of Hippo signaling activity by inhibiting PDPK1 protein (the second blue dashed
  oval). NOLC1 interacts with the EJC junction formed by SRRM2, CASC3, EIF4A3, and
  RBM8A proteins. It mediates Wnt/Notch signaling activity through the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD) and monoubiquitylation of H3K23 (H3K18ac0K23ub1) by translocating

  suppressors (green), oncoproteins (red), inferred proteins (teal) and phosphoproteins
