caption: The role of p38 MAPK in the induction of pemphigus vulgaris (PV). There are
  at least three potential p38-MAPK-related mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis
  and/or the progression of PV. (a) The binding of pathogenic autoantibodies targeting
  Dsg3 in keratinocytes initiates an array of signals leading to the activation of
  p38 MAPK cascade with subsequent phosphorylation of MAPKAPK (mitogen-activated protein
  kinase-activated protein kinases 2/3) and heat shock protein 27 (Hsp 27). The final
  outcome of these events is actin filaments reorganization and induction of acantholysis
  []; (b) p38 MAPK, MAPKAPK, and Hsp27 may form a complex (signalosome) that regulates
  the reorganization of actin filaments and the induction of acantholysis []; (c)
  studies in p38−/− keratinocytes demonstrate a p38 MAPK-independent blister formation.
  The subsequent activation of this pathway, however, can lead to de novo depletion
  of multiple desmosomal molecules, further facilitating spontaneous blister formation
  []. This latter hypothesis indicates that p38 MAPK signaling may not be responsible
  for the induction of PV but could play a role for the progression of the disease.
