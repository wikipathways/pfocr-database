caption: MHC-I antigen presentation during protein synthesis and turnover. The process
  of protein biosynthesis (left column) leading to stable, functional protein comprises
  multiple steps. Errors may result in DRiPs, which are targeted for ubiquitin-dependent
  proteasomal degradation and therefore can sample newly synthesized proteins for
  antigen presentation. The RQC pathway (top gray panel) functions to degrade stalled
  polypeptide chains in a manner independent of their folding state. This situation
  mainly arises from errors in mRNA synthesis and maturation. Our results suggest
  that failed cotranslational insertion into membranes of proteins with multiple transmembrane
  segments also causes stalling and triggers RQC-mediated degradation. Folding-dependent
  protein quality control pathways survey structural cues to identify errors in protein
  folding and assembly as well as mature protein damage (lower gray panel).
