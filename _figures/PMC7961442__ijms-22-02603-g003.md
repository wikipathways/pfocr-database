caption: Main signaling molecules involved in the communication between pollen tube
  and transmitting tract during its growth in this tissue, towards the ovule. This
  image aims to focus mainly on the transmitting-tract-secreted signals, rather than
  on the signals generated by the pollen tube, well described in many reviews. TTS
  (transmitting-tissue-specific) is shown at the surface of the TT cells either still
  intact or being deglycosylated (scissors) by the growing PT. The glycosylated TTS
  is decreased after the arrival of the PTs in the TT, thereby establishing a gradient
  of increasing TTS glycosylation from the top to the bottom of the style. AGPs (arabinogalactan
  proteins) are also present in the TT cells and ECM and are thought to play essential
  roles in PT growth, by some signaling pathway which remains to be unraveled. AGPs
  are represented by the branched glycans acting as Ca2+ reservoirs (green dots),
  which are probably involved in Ca2+signaling pathways in the PT. LTP (lipid transfer
  protein) represents the SCA, stylar cysteine-rich adhesion molecule, secreted by
  the TT cells, forming an adhesive matrix with pectins between the PT and the TT
  surface. Chemocyanin is also shown, which has a chemotropic guidance effect on PTs
  by acting together with SCA. VGD1 (VANGUARD1) is a pectin methylesterase (PME) from
  the PT, acting on pectin demethyesterification and leading to TT cell wall loosening
  to facilitate PT growth, possibly by coordinated action with endopolygalacturonases.
  A GABA (γ-amino butyric acid) gradient created by male POP2 (POLLEN ON PISTIL 2),
  a GABA transaminase, is thought to provide cues for PT growth along the TT. Besides
  this, GABA may modulate Ca2+ channels from the PT, influencing the dynamic extracellular
  and intracellular Ca2+ gradient essential for PT growth along the pistil tissues.
  Also involved in Ca2+ gradient changes is D-serine from the pistil tissues, which
  induces Ca2+ permeable GLRs (glutamate receptor-like channels) at the PT tip. Created
