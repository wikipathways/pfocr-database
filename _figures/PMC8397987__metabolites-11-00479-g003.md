caption: 'Fructose metabolism in cancer. Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to
  support the greater energy demand for cell growth and proliferation. Often, fructose
  can be used as an alternative fuel source in low glucose conditions. The ability
  of fructose to be metabolized through various pathways (i.e., glycolysis, gluconeogenesis,
  glycosylation, nucleic acid synthesis, lipogenesis) paves the way for a number of
  metabolic alterations to occur in cancer, which are shown in the diagram above.
  The upregulation of cell membrane transporters, such as GLUT, induce increased fructose
  metabolism. Furthermore, the altered expression of enzymes, such as KHK, FBP1, and
  ALDOB, contribute to substantial clinical presentation of tumor progression in cancers,
  such as breast, prostate, gastric, ccRCC, and CRC. Enzymes are shown in bold red,
  metabolites are black, pathway outcomes are italicized navy. Cancer types are shown
  in light green text boxes. Red and blue arrows are indicative of expression or activity
