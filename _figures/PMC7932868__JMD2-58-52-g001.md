caption: Phenylalanine/tyrosine metabolic pathway. 4‐hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase
  (4‐HPPD) and homogentisate 1,2‐dioxygenase (HGD) are involved in the metabolism
  of tyrosine to fumaric acid. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is involved in the process
  of converting tyrosine to catecholamines and tyrosinase (TYR) in melanin production.
  The pathway to ochronotic pigment is shown (dashed arrows). Enzymes are in italics
papertitle: Expression of tyrosine pathway enzymes in mice demonstrates that homogentisate
  1,2‐dioxygenase deficiency in the liver is responsible for homogentisic acid‐derived
  ochronotic pigmentation.
