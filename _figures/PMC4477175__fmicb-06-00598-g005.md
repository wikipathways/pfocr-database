caption: Accumulation profile of compounds related to the 13-LOX oxylipin pathway.
  Non-mycorrhizal (Nm), F. mosseae (Fm) and R. irregularis (Ri) colonized roots were
  processed for relative quantification analysis by HPLC–QTOF MS. Concentration of
  metabolites was determined in all the samples by normalizing the chromatographic
  area for each compound with the dry weight of the corresponding sample. For those
  compounds matching two or more identification criteria (exact mass, positive fragmentation
  spectrum, or chemical standards) names are assigned. Those compounds tentatively
  identified are assigned by an m/z ratio together with their putative names. Dotted
  arrows mean multiple metabolic steps, straight arrows mean single steps. Data in
  the same plot not sharing a common letter differ significantly (p < 0.05) according
  to the Newman–Keuls test.
