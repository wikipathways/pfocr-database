caption: 'Proposed integrative view of DYN/KOR system main effects and regulations.
  Dynorphin (DYN) is mainly released by stress and binds to KOR, which triggers its
  effects through two signaling pathways: the β-arrestin-2 pathway and the Gi protein
  signaling pathway. Some compounds can create an imbalance between these two main
  effects, such as estradiol at the molecular level that decrease β-arrestin-2 signaling
  and increase Gi protein signaling (), promoting analgesic effects and decreasing
  dysphoric effects. Similarly, G-protein biased KOR agonists tend to promote analgesia
  without dysphoric side effects (; ) KOR also mediate central and peripheral analgesia,
  by acting on primary sensory neurons, the spinal cord and the brainstem. In turn,
  dysphoric effects are potentially induced through a DA release decrease in the brain
  by inhibiting the VTA dopaminergic neurons and by an increased release of CRF and
  HPA axis activation. Stress-induced analgesia is KOR dependent in the case of inescapable
  stress. This may somehow be related to dissociative states, following an emotional
  shutdown, thought to involve KOR activation, increasing opioid dependent analgesia
  and producing alterations of mood and perception (). CRF, Corticotropin Releasing
  Factor; DA, dopamine; HPA axis, Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal axis; KOR, Kappa Opioid
  Receptor; VTA, ventral Tegmental Area.'
