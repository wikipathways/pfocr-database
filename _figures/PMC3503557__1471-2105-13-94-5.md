caption: Network and pathway structure for biologically informative priors in the
  cancer drug response data study. Network constructed using information from cellsignal.com.
  Square nodes represent fully connected subnetworks consisting of iso-forms and phospho-forms
  of the named protein (see Additional file ). Node colouring represents pathway structure.
  Red, blue, yellow, green and purple nodes denote 5 pathways. Orange nodes are in
  both the red and yellow pathways. Light grey nodes are in all 5 pathways. Dark grey
  node is in all pathways except the purple pathway. White nodes are not assigned
  to a pathway.
