caption: Model for Pah1 localization and stability regulated by phosphorylation and
  dephosphorylation and for its role in lipid synthesis. The expression of PAH1 is
  regulated during growth by nutrient status as mediated by the Opi1/Ino2-Ino4 (Henry)
  regulatory circuit and transcription factors Gis1, Rph1, and Zap1 (, ). Pah1 is
  phosphorylated (small white circles) by multiple protein kinases in the cytosol
  and translocates to the nuclear/ER membrane through its dephosphorylation by the
  Nem1-Spo7 complex (, ). Dephosphorylated Pah1 that is associated with the nuclear/ER
  membrane via its amphipathic helix () catalyzes the conversion of PA to DAG (),
  which is converted to TAG for storage in lipid droplets (LDs). The DAG is also used
  for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine via the Kennedy
  pathway when cells are supplemented with choline or ethanolamine (, ). Unphosphorylated/dephosphorylated
  Pah1 or protein kinase C (PKC)-phosphorylated Pah1 () is degraded by the 20S proteasome
  (indicated by the dashed-line arrows) ().
