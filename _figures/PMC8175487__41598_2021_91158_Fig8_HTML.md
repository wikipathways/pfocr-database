caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the effect of nobiletin on bovine embryo development
  during the two EGA phases (MNEGA and MJEGA). Nobiletin a class of polymethoxylated
  flavone, is easily absorbed across the cytoplasmic membranes due to its structure
  and lipophilic nature, but the specific mechanism of action is not clear yet. Nobiletin
  supplementation during EGA has a positive effect on preimplantation bovine embryonic
  development, also increase the abundance of CDK2 (cell cycle progression), H3-3A,H3-3B
  (development) and GPX1 (oxidative stress) transcripts in 8-cells and 16-cells embryos.
  In addition, the nobiletin effect in the produced blastocysts was reflected by stimulating
  mitochondrial activity, decreasing the cytoplasmatic accumulation of lipids and
  promoting the expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism and protect against
  oxidative stress. Besides, these positive responses of nobiletin on embryonic development
  and quality of the produced blastocysts in vitro could be modulated by activation
  of the AKT signaling pathway. In our study increased AKT phosphorylation might be
  related to the increase in the production and the expression of genes that favor
  the progression of the cell cycle (CDK2) and reducing lipid content (PPARα). However,
  further studies are needed to fully elucidate its mechanism of action in early embryos.
