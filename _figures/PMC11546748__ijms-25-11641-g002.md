caption: Molecular and hormonal pathways contributing to insulin resistance in gestational
  diabetes. (A) Produced by the placenta, Human Placental Lactogen (hPL) levels increase
  during pregnancy, promoting lipolysis and reducing maternal glucose uptake by inhibiting
  insulin action. This ensures glucose availability for the fetus but also contributes
  to insulin resistance by inducing serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, disrupting downstream
  signaling pathways essential for glucose uptake. (B) Elevated cortisol levels in
  GD enhance gluconeogenesis and lipolysis, increasing blood glucose and free fatty
  acids. These free fatty acids activate Protein Kinase C (PKC), which further promotes
  serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, exacerbating insulin resistance. (C) Dysfunctional
  mitochondria in GD produce excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative
  stress. This oxidative damage further impairs insulin signaling by promoting aberrant
  serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, contributing to metabolic disturbances. (D) Cytokines
  such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-18, and leptin, secreted by adipocytes and immune cells,
  activate stress kinases (JNK and IKK). These kinases further inhibit insulin signaling
  by promoting serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, linking chronic inflammation with
  impaired glucose uptake. (E) Overactivation of the mTOR pathway in GD, partly due
  to reduced adiponectin levels, leads to increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1,
  disrupting insulin signaling. This pathway also impacts cellular growth and autophagy,
  exacerbating metabolic dysregulation. (F) Klotho, a protein overexpressed in trophoblastic
  cells in GD, interferes with normal insulin signaling by promoting serine phosphorylation
  of IRS-1. This disruption reduces PI3K and Akt activation, impairing glucose uptake
  and contributing to hyperglycemia
