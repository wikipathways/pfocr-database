caption: Schematic overview of pioglitazone effects on TLR and interferon (IFN) pathway.
  Pioglitazone decreased Tlr4 and Tlr2 receptor expression together with Mal and Myd88
  (marked in orange). The major effect was observed in decreased expression of downstream
  pathway components such as Irf3 and Irf7, whose activation subsequently upregulates
  IFN and IFN-inducible gene expression, as found in our gentamicin-treated OCs. Pioglitazone
  upregulated Pias1 (marked in green). PIAS1 can interact with IRF3 and inhibit its
  DNA-binding activity. PIAS1 acts as a mediator of IRF7 sumoylation. Irf7 expression
  is dependent on the activated IFN I and TLR pathways. IRF7 protein itself promotes
  IFN-α and Irf7 gene expression by binding to interferon-sensitive response element
  (ISRE), and interference with its activation and nuclear translocation could lead
  to decreased Irf7 mRNA levels. We have discovered increased phosphorylation of IRF7
  protein in samples exposed to gentamicin, whereas pioglitazone-treated samples had
  levels similar to control samples. The third point of PIAS1 interaction with the
  IFN pathway could be the blocking of STAT1 and subsequent activation of ISRE-mediated
  gene transcription. By interfering at any of these points, PIAS1 could decrease
  IFN and IFN-inducible gene expression, leading to inhibition of IFN-dependent IFN-pathway
  activation (red arrow).
