caption: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) cell entry and replication. E2 glycoprotein binds
  to the membrane receptor Mxra8, inducing the translocation of clathrin molecules
  to the plasma membrane (1). GAG, DC-SIGN, CD147, and TIM are also described as CHIKV
  co-receptors, but their role for entry process is not well elucidated. CHIKV entry
  occurs via clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway (2) and once the early endosome
  is formed, clathrin molecules dissociate from the endocytic vesicle (3), and the
  endosome proceed in the endocytic pathway. The pH acidification of endocytic vesicles
  triggers the detachment of E1-E2 heterodimers, exposing the fusion loop, which will
  culminate in the fusion of the endosomal with the viral membranes (4). Then, the
  nucleocapsid is released in the cytoplasm, genomic RNA is exposed, and translation
  of the non-structural polyprotein P1234 will take place (5). The P1234 protein is
  thus cleaved by the viral protease nsP2, releasing the individual non-structural
  proteins, which will form the viral replicase complex (6). The replicase complex
  is responsible for the synthesis of the negative-strand RNA (7) that will be the
  template for new positive-strand RNA (8) as well as for the synthesis of 26S subgenomic
  RNA (9). The subgenomic RNA, in its turn, is translated into the structural polyprotein
  C-pE2-6K-E1 in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) (10). The C protein, which
  contains a protease domain responsible for its self-cleavage, dissociates from the
  polyprotein just after its translation (10b) and will attach to the positive polarity
  genomic RNA to form the nucleocapsid in the cytoplasm (11). In this meantime, the
  pE2-6K-E1 precursor will be addressed to the lumen of the ER (10a), where its maturation
  process will take place (13). The structural proteins will proceed in the exocytic
  pathway (14), until the end of E1-E2 heterodimers is mature (15). E1-E2 dimers will
  be deposited in the cell membrane forming the ‘virus budding microdomain’, a membrane
  domain where the budding process will occur (16). The recently assembled nucleocapsid
  migrates to this region, and new virions will be released to the extracellular milieu
  by budding (17).
