caption: 'Schematic of modular design to enhance NAD+ biosynthesis and EET rate in
  S. oneidensis MR-1. a The NAD+ biosynthesis pathway of the wild-type S. oneidensis
  MR-1 (as revealed by genomic studies) is categorized into three modules. Module
  1 involves de novo biosynthesis by assimilating L-aspartate (L-Asp). Module 2 involves
  salvage biosynthesis from the precursors Na (nicotinic acid) and Nm (nicotinamide).
  Module 3 involves universal biosynthesis from a common portion of the de novo and
  salvage biosynthesis pathways. b Recombinant S. oneidensis SN5 harboring five homogeneously
  and heterogeneously introduced genes (ycel, pncB, nadM, nadD*, and nadE*) to enhance
  NAD+ biosynthesis. Specifically, in Module 2, to enable simultaneously assimilation
  and metabolism of Na and Nm, the gene ycel encoding a bifunctional niaP transporter
  for Na and Nm from Bacillus subtilis and the gene pncB encoding nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase
  from Salmonella typhimurium were heterogeneously expressed. In Module 3, the gene
  nadM encoding an NMN adenylyltransferase from Francisella tularensis was efficient
  in EET enhancement. Additionally, the gene nadE* (encoding NAD+ synthetase) and
  nadD* (encoding nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase) from Escherichia
  coli were confirmed to be involved in promoting the EET rate. The enzymes are represented
  by the corresponding protein (in rectangles on the arrows)—NadA: quinolinate synthetase,
  NadB: L-aspartate oxidase, NadC: quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase, NadD*: NaMN
  adenylyltransferase, NadE*: NAD synthetase, NadM: NMN adenyltransferase, NadV: Nm
  phosphoribosyltransferase, PncB: Na phosphoribosyltransferase, PncC: Nm mononucleotide
  deamidase, NadM: NMN adenylyltransferase, niaP: Na and Nm transporter. Abbreviations:
