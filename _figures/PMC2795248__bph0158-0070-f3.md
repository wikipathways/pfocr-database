caption: Anti-inflammatory effects of EPAC in VECs. EPAC mediates at least three anti-inflammatory
  signalling pathways in VECs. IL-6 signalling via STAT3 is inhibited by EPAC-dependent
  SOCS3 induction; this occurs via Rap1 and C/EBP transcription factors (black pathway).
  EPAC mediates activation of integrins involved in adhesion of VECs to the basement
  membrane; the signalling pathway between EPAC-activated Rap1 and integrin activation
  is not known, but may involve RIAM and talin, as reported for the αIIbβ3 platelet
  integrin (purple pathway). Agents such as thrombin and TNFα reduce adhesion of VECs
  to adjacent cells at adherens junctions via Rho, actin reorganization to reduce
  cortical ring and increase contractile stress fibres and destabilization of microtubules,
  resulting in reduced cadherin-mediated adhesion, increasing inter-endothelial gaps
  and thus increasing endothelial permeability (red pathway). In the presence of permeability-increasing
  agents, EPAC reduces endothelial permeability by inhibiting Rho activation and actin
  cytoskeleton reorganization, by promoting microtubule lengthening and by unidentified
  signalling pathways not requiring Rho or the cytoskeleton, all of which result in
  increased cadherin-mediated adhesion (blue pathway). C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding
  protein; EPAC, exchange protein activated by cAMP; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor;
  MT, microtubule; RIAM, Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule; SOCS3, suppressor
  of cytokine signalling 3; VECs, vascular endothelial cells.
