caption: KATP Channel Inhibitors and Their Effects on Cancer Cell Signaling. KATP
  channel inhibitors, including Glyburide, Glipizide, Gliclazide, Nateglinide, and
  Repaglinide, modulate key signaling pathways in cancer cells. These agents impact
  angiogenesis through VEGF signaling, induce TRAIL resistance via the p-Akt and p-mTOR
  pathways, promote cell cycle arrest by activating AMPK and enhancing p53/p21, inhibit
  cell growth through NF-κB pathways, and affect oxidative stress management through
  the FOXO3 axis. The representation underscores the multifaceted roles of KATP channel
  inhibitors as modulators of cancer cell dynamics. Cartoon in Figure 5 was created
