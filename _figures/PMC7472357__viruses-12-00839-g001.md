caption: 'G0-to-G1 transition presents a window of opportunity for HIV-1 infection.
  G0-to-G1 transition: Macrophages in the G0 state express the negative cell cycle
  regulator p21(Waf1/Cip1). In this state, CDK1 levels are low and SAMHD1 is activated/dephosphorylated,
  thus decreasing dNTP levels. Macrophages in this state are highly refractory to
  HIV-1 infection. The activation of the MEK/ERK signalling pathway triggers monocyte-derived
  macrophage (MDM) entry to a G1 state where p21 is downregulated and CDK1 is expressed
  and inactivates SAMHD1 by phosphorylation. The dNTP levels are increasing, and the
  macrophages are permissive to HIV-1 infection. G1-to-G0 transition: When MDM in
  G1 state are exposed to danger signals (e.g., DNA damage, HDACi and immune stimuli),
  they can revert back to the G0 state. This is accompanied by an increase in p21
  levels, CDK1 downregulation and SAMHD1 dephosphorylation/activation, leading to
  the blocking of HIV-1 infection.'
