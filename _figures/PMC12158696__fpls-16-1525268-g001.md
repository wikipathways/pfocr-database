caption: 'Schematic summary of biosynthesis pathway of the main HCAAs reported in
  rice. HCAAs are produced by inducible HTs acting on free amine of polyamines or
  aromatic monoamines and the thioester derivatives of phenolic acids produced through
  phenylpropanoid pathway, which also regulate the biosynthesis of flavonoid and lignin.
  Abbreviations of some key enzymes in different metabolic process are indicated.
  Phenylpropanoid: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamic acid 4hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate‐CoA ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; CSE, caffeoyl shikimate esterase; COMT, caffeate/5‐hydroxyferulate
  3‐O‐methyltransferase; F5H, ferulate 5‐hydroxylase. Flavonoid: CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3‐hydroxylase; F3’H, flavanone 3′‐hydroxylase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; NOMT, naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (Sakuranetin). Lignin:
  CCR, cinnamoyl‐CoA reductase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; POD, peroxidases;
  LAC, Laccases. Polyamine: ADC, arginine decarboxylase; AIH, agmatine iminohydrolase;
  CPA, carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase; SPDS, spermidine synthase; SPMS, spermine
  synthase. HCAA: HTs, N-hydroxycinnamoyl transferases; THT, tyramine hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; TBT, tryptamine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; AHT, agmatine hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; PHT, putrescine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; SHT, spermidine hydroxycinnamoyl
