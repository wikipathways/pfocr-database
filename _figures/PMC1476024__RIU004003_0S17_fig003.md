caption: Biochemistry of myosin, the Rho kinase pathway, and maintenance of tone.
  Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), acting through Ca+2 and calmodulin (Ca4CaM), is
  responsible for phosphorylation of myosin. Phosphorylated myosin interacts with
  actin to increase smooth muscle tone. This maintains the penis in a detumescent
  state. Conversely, myosin phosphatase (MP) dephosphorylates myosin to reduce tone.
  Rho kinase, in combination with ATP, prevents phosphorylation of MP, thereby maintaining
  the latter molecule in the inactive state. Thus, constant tone is maintained even
  in the absence of NE. This may explain how the penis is kept in the detumescent
  state. Rho kinase inhibitors in vivo and in vitro relax cavernous smooth muscle,
  raise intracavernous pressure, and trigger penile erection. A variety of signal
  transduction pathways (shown) are responsible for maintaining a constitutive increase
  in Rho kinase. Gq, G-protein; PLC, phospholipase C; PiP2, inositol biphosphate;
  DAG, diacyl glycerate; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; PKC, protein kinase C; GEF, guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor; Aa, arachadonic acid; RLC, regulatory light chain; GDP,
  guanidine diphosphate; Y-27632, selective inhibitor of Rho kinase. Reproduced from
