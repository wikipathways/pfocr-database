caption: The mitochondrial electron transport chain. The subunits of the respiratory
  chain are encoded by nDNA and mtDNA. Mitochondria produce ATP via the OXPHOS pathway;
  a process that takes place at the inner mitochondrial membrane involves the channeling
  of electrons through four-electron transport chain (ETC) complexes (Complex I–IV).
  The electron transport results in subsequent translocation of protons from the matrix
  into the intermembrane space, this proton gradient in combination with the inward-negative
  mitochondrial membrane potential drives the molecular motor, ATP synthase (complex
  V), to produce ATP. An impairment in the ETC or its assembly complexes results in
  metabolic malfunction in cells and tissues. The ETC is a vast complex comprising
  ∼90 different subunits which make up the five enzyme complexes of OXPHOS. Of these
  subunits, mtDNA encodes 13 subunits while the nuclear DNA (nDNA) encodes ∼77 subunits.
  Together, the nDNA and mtDNA coordinate the synthesis of subunits that come together
  to form the individual complexes that compose the ETC, subsequently allowing the
  mitochondria to function as the core energy producer for cellular needs. Specific
  genes encoded by nDNA and mtDNA in the context of LS are listed.
