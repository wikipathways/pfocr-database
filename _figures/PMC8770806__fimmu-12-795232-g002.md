caption: Immune modulatory effects of QDs on the respiratory system. The picture shows
  that after being exposed to QDs, resident pulmonary macrophages, lung epithelial
  cells, and fibroblast swallowed QDs, and then QDs would activate inflammatory-related
  pathway like TLR signaling, which promoted cells to release proinflammatory cytokines
  (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and chemokines (CXCL-1/2/5/MIP-1α,γ/CCL-2). Sequentially
  neutrophils would be recruited firstly, and then monocyte and adaptive immune T
  cells would follow. Besides, QDs activated AT II cells and released IL-33 which
  activated ILC2 cells.
