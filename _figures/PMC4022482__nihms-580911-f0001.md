caption: Working model of phrenic motor facilitation (pMF). pMF is initiated by multiple
  Gq (5-HT2A/B) or Gs (5-HT7 and A2A) protein coupled metabotropic receptors (the
  Q and S pathways, respectively). NADPH oxidase is necessary for the Q pathway to
  pMF. Here, we have given PCPA (tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor), with and without
  methysergide (broad spectrum 5-HT antagonist), with and without apocynin (NADPH
  oxidase inhibitor), and/or MSX-3 (adenosine A2A receptor antagonist) in an effort
  to identify Q and S pathway contributions to the mechanism of compensatory respiratory
  plasticity in motor neuron disease. By blocking these mechanisms, we originally
  hypothesized that ventilatory capacity would decrease in end-stage SOD1G93A rats.
