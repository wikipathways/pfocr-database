caption: a | Transcription factors, including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor
  α (IκBα), are regulated through post-translation modifications. Phosphorylation
  of IκBα by the IκB kinase (IKK) outside a phosphorylation-dependent small ubiquitin-related
  modifier (SUMO) motif (PDSM) inhibits its SUMO modification by ubiquitin-like conjugating
  enzyme 9 (UBC9) and promotes modification by ubiquitin, targeting IκBα for degradation
  and releasing the transcription factor NF-κB to turn on target gene transcription.
  SUMO modification of IκBα in the absence of phosphorylation inhibits transcription
  by blocking IκBα turnover and release of NF-κB. b | Phosphorylation of the transcription
  factor myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) by cyclin-dependent kinase 5
  (CDK5) within a PDSM enhances its modification by SUMO, inhibiting transcription
  and resulting in synapse maturation. Calcium signaling results in dephosphorylation
  by the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and acetylation of MEF2A by the
  histone acetyl transferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, converting it from
  a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator and causing synapse disassembly.
