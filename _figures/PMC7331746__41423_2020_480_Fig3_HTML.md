caption: Different roles of mitochondrial dynamics in macrophages. a Mitochondrial
  dynamics are involved in the polarization of macrophages to satisfy their different
  metabolic demands. M1 macrophages require increased glycolysis, and M2 macrophages
  require increased fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore,
  fragmented mitochondria were produced in M1 macrophages by increasing mitochondrial
  fission mediated by DRP1, while elongated mitochondria were produced by mitochondrial
  fusion in M2 macrophages. b In BMDMs, MIGA2 deficiency promoted mitochondrial fission
  and inhibited fusion to increase the production of IL-12 via the parkin-CHIP-IRF1
  signaling pathway. c Mitochondrial dynamics induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation
  via different signaling pathways in BMDMs. Mitochondrial fusion provided elongated
  mitochondria to facilitate the interaction of NLRP3, MFN2, and MAVS for the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome after RNA virus infection. However, mitochondrial fission
  promoted the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by increasing mitochondrial damage
  and suppressed the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by decreasing the interaction
  of NLRP3 and ASC in different conditions. Mitochondrial transport also promoted
  the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by creating optimal sites for the interaction
  of NLRP3 and ASC. Mitophagy eliminated damaged mitochondria to suppress the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome. d Mitochondrial fission induced by exposure to apoptotic
  cells (AC) in macrophages was essential for AC corpse degradation and vesicular
  trafficking, which were necessary for continued efferocytosis
