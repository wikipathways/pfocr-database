caption: Integration of unfolded protein response (UPR) and NF-κB signaling. (A) In
  the absence of signals, most cells have no or very low basal activity of the UPR
  and of the canonical NF-κB pathway. The protein kinases IRE1α and PERK are kept
  inactive by binding to the chaperone BIP/GRP78 within the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) lumen. Most of the IκBα inhibitor is bound to NF-κB subunits retaining them
  in the cytoplasm. (B) Different classes of chemical stressors (tunicamcyin, thapsigargin
  or dithiotreitol (DTT)) increase the unfolded protein load in the ER causing massive
  auto-phosphorylation and activation of both IRE1α and PERK. IRE1α binds to the adapter
  protein TRAF2 and (indirectly) to the protein kinase IKKβ. PERK phosphorylates the
  eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α causing translational shut-off for
  multiple proteins including the free unbound IκBα. Destruction of free IκBα also
  requires phosphorylation by IRE1α-associated IKKβ. (C) During infection, inflammation
  or cancer, strong activation of NF-κB by cytokines or toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists
  occurs in parallel to ER stress. In this case, the formation of specific signaling
  complexes at PERK and IRE1α sensors by still putative “UPRosomes” is suggested to
  restrict maximal ER stress, thereby contributing to context-specific gene activation
  or repression.
