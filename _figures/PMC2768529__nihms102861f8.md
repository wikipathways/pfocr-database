caption: Proposed interplay between IL-15 and TNF-α signaling in skeletal muscle.
  Binding of TNF-α to TNF-R1 triggers the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Chronic
  IL-15 stimulation may result in downregulation of TNF-R1 and subsequent prevention
  of TNF-α-mediated apoptosis (solid line). Actions of IL-15 may be transduced by
  its cell surface trimeric receptor. IL-15 may also interact with IL-15Rα on the
  plasma membrane and be presented to adjacent cells (or portions of a muscle fiber)
  expressing the γc/IL-2Rβ heterodimer. Soluble IL-15Rα (sIL-15Rα) may be important
  for secretion, stabilization and activity of IL-15. Additionally, in the presence
  of an acute apoptotic stimulus, IL-15Rα might counteract DISC assembly and promote
  the production of anti-apoptotic proteins such as FLIPs and cIAPs via NF-κB activation
  (dashed lines).
