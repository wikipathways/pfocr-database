caption: 'A response is triggered in both the ephrin-expressing cell (a) and the EPH-bearing
  one (b). Following EPH–ephrin interaction, an action is triggered in both cells
  through complex molecular mechanisms, as EPHs/ephrins interact with various molecular
  cascades to further convey the message into the cytoplasm. Forward signaling includes
  interaction of EPHs with the Src family kinases, resulting in the regulation of
  synapses formation, with Rho GTPases leading to junction stabilization as well as
  interaction with Ephexins and the ERK/MAPK pathway leading to cell proliferation.
  Moreover, EPHs interact with FAK and the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in modulation
  of cell adhesion. Mechanisms implicated in reverse signaling include, among others,
  interaction between ephrins and Src, Erk, Rac, AΚΤ, paxillin, and p75, leading to
  integrin-dependent cell adhesion as well as with Src, Grb4, PTP-BL, and PDZ-RGS3,
  regulating various actions such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation.
