caption: Canonical and non-canonical pathway. (A) In the canonical pathway, a ligand,
  Ptch1 or SMO activation, and transcription factors are involved. (B) In the non-canonical
  Hh ligand-independent pathway, in which Ptch1 interacts with cyclin B1 and recruits
  this first form of an apoptotic complex to its C-terminal domain that consists of
  adaptor protein Dral, the CARD-containing protein Tucan-1, and caspase-9. Caspase-9
  activation is followed by caspase-3 activation, which results in apoptosis. (C)
  In the ligand-dependent non-canonical signaling pathway, the linkage of Ptch1 with
  cyclin B1 and the proapoptotic complex is disrupted by Hh binding, most likely due
  to a conformational shift in Ptch1, resulting in enhanced proliferation and survival.
  Red-highlighted and grey-shaded caspase shapes indicate active and inactive caspases,
  respectively.
