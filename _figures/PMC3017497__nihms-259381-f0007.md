caption: Stimulation of the mating pheromone response pathway leads to the phosphorylation
  and activation of both Kss1 and Fus3. Both MAPKs participate in the induction of
  mating genes. Active Fus3 potentiates a feedback mechanism that limits the magnitude
  and duration of Kss1 activation, thereby plugging a Kss1-mediated leak that would
  otherwise result in inappropriate hyperactivation of FRE-driven transcription. Active
  Fus3 also limits its own phosphorylation (not shown), presumably by the same mechanism.
  Finally, active Fus3 also inhibits filamentation by a Kss1-independent mechanism
  (data not shown).
