caption: NLRP3 inflammasome activation evoked by α-syn aggregates. In Parkinson’s
  disease, the imbalance between the α-syn synthesis and clearance contributes to
  the aggregation and accumulation of α-syn in the neurons. Neurons release α-syn
  in distinct ways, including passive and active mechanisms; the type of release depends
  on the different forms of α-syn. Exosomes are also involved in the release of aggregated
  α-syn. The α-syn aggregates released into the extracellular space provide the priming
  signal for the activation of NLRP3 through binding to TLR2, triggering NF-κB-dependent
  upregulation of NLRP3 and production of pro-inflammatory cytokine. In addition,
  α-syn aggregates impair mitochondrial function following the internalization of
  α-syn fibrils by microglia, thereby inducing the generation of mtDNA and mtROS.
  Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed for mitochondrial dysfunction, including
  the reduction of SIRT3 via the AMPKα-CREB signaling pathway, the blockage of TOM20
  and the engagement of CD11b. The aforementioned process provides the second “activation”
  signal for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which induces activated caspase-1-mediated
  release of mature IL-1β and IL-18. The inflammatory cytokines are capable of augmenting
  cytotoxicity and α-syn accumulation. Several therapeutic approaches exert a neuroprotection
  effect by targeting the α-syn/TLRs/NF-κB/NLRP3 process, including immune antibodies,
  molecular compounds, the repurpose of pre-existing drugs and natural extracts. NLRP3,
  leucine-rich repeat- and pyrin domain-containing 3; TLRs, toll like receptors; IL-1β,
  interleukin-1β; IL-18, interleukin-18; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer
  of activated B cells; TOM20, the translocase of the outer membrane receptors; CD11b,
  the α chain of a non-covalently associated heterodimeric transmembrane receptor
  integrin αMβ2; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein; SIRT3, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase.
