caption: PI3K activation can occur through RAS mutation or increased activation of
  growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) like EGFR. Activation or mutation
  of RAS results in stimulation of the RAS/RAF/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK) pathway resulting in increased tumor proliferation. This increase in proliferation
  can be identified through the use of diffusion MRI, 18F-fluorothymidine (FLT) PET,
  or amino acid PET imaging techniques that have been shown to correlate with cellularity
  and proliferation rates (e.g. 18F-FET, 18F-fluorodopa, or 11C-methionine PET). Activation
  of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway after RTK or RAS signaling results in increased angiogenesis
  through expression of nitric oxide (NO) or through HIF-1α upregulation and secretion
  of VEGF. To measure changes in vascularity within the tumor, a variety of perfusion-sensitive
  MRI techniques can be used including dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) or dynamic
  contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI. Changes in oxygenation within the tumor can also be
  measured using imaging techniques, including oxygen-sensitive R2’ imaging or radiotracers
  like 18F-FMISO that is sensitive to tumor hypoxia. Activation of growth factor RTKs
  like EGFR also increase glucose metabolism (specific glycolysis) through activation
  of AKT, MYC, or a variety of other signaling mechanisms. This increase in glucose
  metabolism can be quantified through the use of 18F-FDG PET, hyperpolarized 13C-glucose
  or pyruvate, or glucose enhanced CEST imaging (i.e. “glucoCEST”). Lactate and lactic
  acid production, byproducts of glycolysis, can also be measured using imaging technologies
  such as pH-sensitive amine CEST MRI, lactate MRS, or hyperpolarized 13C-glucose
  or pyruvate. RTK = receptor tyrosine kinase; MEK = mitogen-activated protein kinase
