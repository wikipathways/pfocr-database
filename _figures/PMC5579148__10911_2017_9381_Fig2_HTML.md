caption: α9nAChR involved signal pathway in breast cancer. The three abundant α subunits
  expressed in breast tissue are able to form one homopentameric nAChR (α9nAChR) and
  two possible heteropentameric structures (α9α10-, α9α5-) of nAChRs. NNK and nicotine
  with estrogen stimulation can activate downstream transcription factors, AP1 and
  VDR through the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. The activation of AP1 and
  VDR transcription factors has been known by association with various cancer phenotypes
  including cell proliferation and migration. Binding of these transcription factors
  on the promoter region of α9-nAChR leads to a strong positive feedback loop
