caption: 'Tetrapyrrole Biosynthetic Pathways of Various Eukaryotes.Distribution of
  different types of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway (B) among chromalveolates
  (A). (1) Canonical C4 pathway of heterotrophic eukaryotes; localization differs
  between animal cells () and yeast (). (2) Canonical C5 pathway that is shared by
  most of the photosynthetic eukaryotes. (3) Tetrapyrrole pathway of C. velia with
  putative localizations based on in silico predictions using SignalP and TargetP,
  respectively (). (4) Heme biosynthesis of Apicomplexa; localization differs between
  P. falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii (; , , , ; ; ; ). Numbers of the individual
  steps of the synthesis represent the enzymes: 1, ALAS; 1a, GTR; 1b, GSA-AT; 2, ALAD;
  3, PBGD; 4, UROS; 5, UROD; 6, CPOX; 7, PPOX; 8, FeCH. The abbreviations of the enzyme
  names are explained in the text. The colors of the enzymatic steps stand for the
  origin of the genes, which are inferred from the phylogenetic trees (see Supplemental
  Figure 1 online). *Only incomplete information is available: Schizochytrium possesses
  ALAS, Perkinsus uses the C4 pathway as well as ALAD and UROD of the same origin
  as in primary heterotrophs. From Oxyrrhis marina, the sequence of the gene encoding
  PBGD shows a relation to the phototrophic PBGDs.'
