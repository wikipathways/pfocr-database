caption: Synthesis and function of NAD+ in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the de novo
  synthesis pathways, NAD+ is synthesized from dietary L-tryptophan (Trp). Trp is
  converted to quinolinic acid through several reactions. Quinolinic acid is then
  transformed into NAMN and NAAD; these reactions are catalysed by QPRT and NMNAT,
  respectively. In the salvage pathway, nicotinamide riboside (NR) or nicotinamide
  (NAM) is used to produce NAMN and NMN, which are then converted to NAD+. Cellular
  NAD+ levels are an energy level sensor, and low levels of NAD+ subsequently induce
  cell death. NAD+ functions as a cofactor of SIRT and PARP. As the cofactor of SIRT,
  NAD+ participates in protein deacetylation to regulate the gene expression and production
  of second messengers. As the cofactor of PARP, NAD+ participates in the transfer
  of ADP-ribose subunits from NAD+ to target proteins to regulate processes such as
  DNA repair, gene expression, cell survival and cell cycle progression, chromatin
  remodelling, genomic stability and RNA expression.
