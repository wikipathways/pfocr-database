caption: Working model to illustrate the TAP1-involved innate signal pathway against
  broadly viral infections. TAP1 plays a critical factor in the profound virus-host
  interactions, especially in innate and adaptive immunity. TAP1 can regulate adaptive
  immunity through promoting the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-mediated
  antigen presentation. Additionally, our study also demonstrated that TAP1 could
  promote type I interferon production through activating the TBK1-IRF3 signal pathway.
  Subsequently, Type I IFNs can bind to IFNAR2, then recruit IFNAR1, and consequently,
  form a signaling-competent ternary complex to activate the transcription factor
  IRF9 and ISGF3 complex, which is comprised of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2, through
  the JAK-STAT signal pathway. The activated ISGF3 can translocate to the nucleus
  and bind to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the upstream promoter regions
  of ISGs, which can encode the numerous proteins with potent antiviral activities.
