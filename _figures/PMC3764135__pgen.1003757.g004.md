caption: '(A) Linear cascading relationships among regulators involved in HOG signaling
  pathway in response to osmotic stress were correctly inferred. (B) The predicted
  relationships between the SIR complex and the STE/FUS3/KSS MAPK signal transduction
  pathway are consistent with their roles in mating process. Purple nodes: components
  of the SIR complex; Cyan nodes: single or double mutants of protein kinases. The
  parameter in the DM_BN algorithm for generating these predictions was set to . See
  section “Novel regulator-regulator interactions predicted by DM_BN” for more details.'
