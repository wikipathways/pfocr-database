caption: A model for DOG-1 function in genome stability and ICL response. The left
  panel illustrates DOG-1's role in G-tract maintenance. G4 formation on the lagging
  strand is resolved by the helicase function of DOG-1 and replication proceeds efficiently.
  In the absence of DOG-1 HR mediated by the FA pathway resolves a subset of stalled
  forks. Repair utilizing the mutagenic NHEJ repair mechanism results in deletions.
  The right panel describes a possible model for DOG-1 ICL sensitivity. In the presence
  of DOG-1, G4 structures may be resolved and not available as substrate for ICL stabilization.
  In the absence of DOG-1 G4 structures are available as substrate for ICL stabilization
  leading to an in increase in fork stalling, which is interpreted as an ICL sensitivity
  phenotype.
