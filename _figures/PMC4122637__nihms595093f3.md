caption: A representative diagram of a renal proximal tubule epithelial cell and the
  drugs that are involved in preventing the reabsorption of uric acid into the body.
  Uric acid is reabsorbed into the interstitium/blood by transport from the tubular
  lumen across the apical membrane into the cell and then across the basolateral membrane.
  It is transported across the apical membrane for excretion in the urine. Depicted
  are genes that represent the transporters involved in uric acid transport across
  the apical and basolateral membrane of the cell. Commonly used names for the transporter
  proteins are indicated in parenthesis under the gene name. Uric acid in the blood
  links to the interconnecting Uric Acid-Lowering Drugs Pathway (). Genes/proteins
  that are putatively involved in uric acid transport are also shown in the shaded
  bottom half of the diagram, representing potential novel drug targets or the potential
  for repurposing of drugs known to target these proteins. An interactive version
  of this pathway can be found at http://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA166114721. The
  majority of uric acid found at physiological pH is in the form of urate anion [];
  here we used the term ‘uric acid’ to encompass urate.
