caption: (a) The Weimberg pathway is heterologous to E. coli, however, it provides
  an efficient route for xylose assimilation that bypasses the central carbon metabolism
  and most biomass precursor molecules. To the left of the Weimberg pathway is shown
  the natural route for xylose assimilation in E. coli through the pentose phosphate
  pathway. Succinate dehydrogenase, which converts succinate to fumarate is an ideal
  candidate as a metabolic valve (shown in blue) as it allows flux to the TCA cycle
  and supports gluconeogenic pathways for cell growth. (b) The orthogonal routes for
  ethylene glycol assimilation examined in this study. Malic enzyme is an ideal candidate
  for a metabolic valve (shown in blue) as malate decarboxylation to pyruvate can
  support cell growth. The degree to which the pathway overlaps with the central carbon
  metabolism is captured by the orthogonality score for each specific pathway.
