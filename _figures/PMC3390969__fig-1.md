caption: Important molecules involved in negative immune regulation. The JNK, p38,
  and NF-κB pathways were found to be regulated by the TIPE2 action. In addition to
  NF-κB signaling pathways, the biological function of HSP-specific regulatory T cells
  can recognize induced HSP as presented by stress cells at the site of inflammation
  by production of suppressive cytokines such as IL-10. Zinc finger protein A20 is
  found to belong to a subfamily of 14 deubiquitination enzymes, which is also involved
  in negative regulation associated with TLR ligation. JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  I-κB, inhibitor of κB; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κb; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α;
  TIPE2, TNF-α induced protein 8 like-2; HSP, heat shock protein; IL-10, interleukin
  10; TLR, toll-like receptor; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase.
