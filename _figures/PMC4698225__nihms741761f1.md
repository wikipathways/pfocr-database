caption: NO/S-nitrosylation signaling under physiological and pathological conditions
  in the central nervous system. Physiological activation of NMDA receptors localized
  at synapses triggers calcium influx through the NMDA receptor-associated ion channel
  and stimulates nNOS tethered to the NMDA receptor protein complex. Physiological
  (basal) levels of NO thus produced contribute to normal neuronal functions, e.g.,
  via S-nitrosylation of NMDA receptors (SNO-NMDAR) to prevent their overactivation.
  Under pathological (neurodegenerative) conditions, excessive activation of extrasynaptic
  the NMDAR-nNOS pathway (or iNOS expression in glia cells) can lead to overproduction
  of NO. Under these conditions, excessive generation of ROS can also occur. These
  pathways cause aberrant SNO-protein formation, such as SNO-GAPDH and SNO-PDI, augmenting
  pathological processes; in some cases nitrosothiol formation is followed by reaction
  of the same cysteine residue with ROS to form –SOxH adducts (with × = 1–3).
