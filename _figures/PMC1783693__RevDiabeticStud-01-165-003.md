caption: The JNK pathway in the liver is activated by factors such as oxidative stress,
  free fatty acids (FFAs), and TNF-α. The levels of these factors are elevated under
  obese diabetic conditions. Serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1
  (IRS-1) inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and leads
  to an increase in insulin resistance. Expression of wild type JNK in the liver of
  normal mice decreased insulin sensitivity. Suppression of the JNK pathway by the
  treatment with Ad-DN-JNK enhances insulin signaling which leads to a decrease in
  gluconeogenesis and amelioration of glucose tolerance.
