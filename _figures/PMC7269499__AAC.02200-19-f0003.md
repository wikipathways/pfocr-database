caption: Perturbations of biochemical pathways for K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA 2146 exposed
  to colistin, including gluconeogenesis (blue), the TCA cycle (purple), arginine
  biosynthesis (pink), enterobactin biosynthesis (yellow), porphyrin and chlorophyll
  metabolism (green), and ROS removal (orange). Notably, porphyrin and chlorophyll
  metabolism represents the biosynthesis of vitamin B12 but not chlorophyll. The colors
  of proteins correspond to their clusters (cluster 1, red; cluster 2, blue; cluster
  3, orange; cluster 4, purple; unidentified, gray). The regulation of pathway reactions
  is presented as upregulation (green vector), downregulation (red segment), or no
  change (black vector). Data are shown in Data Set S4 in the supplemental material.
