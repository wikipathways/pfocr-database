caption: ' Neddylation in IBD. MLN4924 prevents neddylation by inhibiting the E1 enzyme
  (NAE); a hypoxic microenvironment triggers the accumulation of adenine nucleotide
  metabolites, which cause the increase of cullin 1 and subsequent inhibition of the
  binding of cullin 1 to NEDD8; HIF-1 regulates oxygen homeostasis and adenosine signal
  transduction, and inhibits neddylation to relieve mucosal inflammation; ROS produced
  by bacteria control the esterification state of cullin 1, and inhibit the NF-‍κB
  signaling pathway by inhibiting neddylation. IBD: inflammatory bowel disease; NEDD8:
  neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8; NAE: NEDD8-activating
  enzyme E1; HIF-1: hypoxia inducible factor-1; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SENP8:
