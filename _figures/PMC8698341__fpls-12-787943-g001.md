caption: Experimental design and affected enzymes in the studied strains. (A) All
  strains were pre-cultured under high CO2 (5%, HC) and then shifted for 24 h into
  low CO2 (ambient air, 0.04%, LC) and afterwards again into HC conditions. At defined
  time points (indicated by arrows) samples were taken for glycogen and metabolome
  analyses. (B) Schematic display of the primary carbon metabolism in cyanobacteria
  with the CBB cycle, the oxidative pentose-phosphate (OPP) pathway, the glycolytic
  Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) and the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathways. The absence
  of specific enzymes in the mutants Δpfk, Δzwf, Δgnd, and Δeda are indicated by red
  crosses. (blue – EMP pathway, red – ED pathway, yellow – OPP pathway, green – CBB
  cycle).
