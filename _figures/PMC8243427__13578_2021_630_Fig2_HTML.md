caption: Biogenesis of miRNAs. Canonical microRNA biogenesis, miRNAs formation starts
  with transcription, during which pri-miRNAs are generated by RNA Pol II and III.
  Microprocessor complex composed of Drosha and DGCR8 excises pri-miRNAs, and pre-miRNAs
  is produced in the nucleus. Then, the nuclear Exp5 forming complex with the Ran-GTP
  exports pre-miRNAs to the cytoplasm, where the pre-miRNA is cleaved by Dicer, generating
  a mature double-stranded miRNA duplex. Subsequently, the guide strand of the miRNA
  duplex is incorporated onto Ago protein complex, forming RISC to recognize and interact
  with the 3’-UTR of their targets. Conversely, the passenger strand is deemed non-functional
  and degraded once released. Drosha-independent miRNAs biogenesis, the Drosha-independent
  mirtron genes do not undergo Drosha cleavage but demand mRNA splicing and debranching
  forming a stem-loop structure analogous to the pre-miRNA synthesized in the canonical
  approach. The subsequent generation process of miRNAs is similar to canonical pathway.
  Dicer-independent miRNAs biogenesis, the Dicer-independent pathway is mainly involved
  in the generation of miR-451 family, which is processed by the microprocessor complex
  Drosha/DGCR8 in the nucleus. Then, a short pre-miRNA was generated and transported
  to the cytoplasm by Exp5. The pre-miR-451 is cleaved by Ago2 and trimmed by PARN
  engendering the mature miR-451, which integrated into Ago to constitute the functional
  core of RISC
