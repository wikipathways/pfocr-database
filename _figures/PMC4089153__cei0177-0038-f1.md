caption: 'Sooner and later. The immediate response to immunological insult (in the
  form of injury, allergens or other toxic products) that causes epithelial cell stress
  and death, is the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such
  as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), dsDNA, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and f-actin.
  Concurrently with, or consequent to DAMP release, the alarmin cytokines interleukin
  (IL)-1α, IL-33, IL-25 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are induced. Both
  DAMPs and alarmins result in activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and group 2 innate
  lymphoid cells (ILC2). The responses occurring soon after immune stimulus are coloured
  green. ILC2 produce the type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13, resulting
  in subsequent expansion of effector cell populations such as eosinophils and goblet
  cells which can occur at both early (green arrows) and late (blue arrows) phases.
  ILC2-derived IL-13 also induces maturation and migration of DCs to the draining
  lymph node, where DCs present antigen to naive T cells. Although ILC2 express major
  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, it is unknown whether they present antigen
  directly to T cells in vivo. Through the combined efforts of ILC2 and DC, antigen-specific
  T helper type 2 (Th2) cells differentiate, and produce type 2 cytokines, further
  stimulating, recruiting and activating type 2 effector cells, as well as IL-2, activating
  and expanding ILC2 cells (blue arrows). Regulatory T cells (Tregs) produce immunosuppressive
  cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, suppressing T cells
  and DC responses (blue solid line), and may also suppress ILC2 responses (blue dashed
  line). Helminths and their products are known to suppress through at least five
  key mechanisms (indicated in numbered red circles): (1) secretion of apyrases, enzymes
  which can degrade the inflammatory DAMP ATP to non-inflammatory adenosine monophosphate
  (AMP) ,; (2) secreted products which inhibit the release of IL-33 ; (3) a range
  of products suppress DC maturation to Toll-like receptor (TLR) signals –; (4) secretions
  induce Tregs through the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway ; and (5) secreted
  enzymes degrade eotaxin, a chemokine required for eosinophil attraction .'
