  NEMO: The NF-κB essential modulator NEMO, a regulatory scaffold protein without
  enzymatic activity. ① During C. albicans infection, HMGB1 translocates and activates
  the NF-κB signaling pathway (p-IKK, IKK, P-IκBα, IκBα, NF-κB p65) and the inflammatory
  response (TNF-α and IL-6). ② mmu-miR-146b-5p specifically binds to the 3′-UTR of
  HMGB1, inhibits HMGB1 expression and translocation, suppresses NF-κB pathway (p-IKK,
  IKK, P-IκBα, IκBα, NF-κB p65) activation, and reduces the release of inflammatory
  mediators(TNF-α and IL-6)'
