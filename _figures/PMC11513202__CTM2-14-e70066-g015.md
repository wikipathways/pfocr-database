caption: Relationships between DNA methylation and adhesion, invasion and metastasis
  of HCC. DNA hypermethylation considerably decreases the expression of E‐cadherin,
  M‐cadherin and H‐cadherin protein, then diminishing the adhesive capacity of tumour
  cells to a certain extent and enhancing their invasive and metastatic potential.
  Meanwhile, hypermethylation of TIMP3 and TFPI‐2 gene promoter significantly decreases
  their protein expression, then reduces the expression of TNF‐α receptor in HCC cells
  and increases the expression of MMP1, MMP3, plasmin and trypsin, finally promoting
  the invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. Besides, DNA hypermethylation‐activated
  full‐length empty spiracles homeobox 1 (EMX1) binds to the EGFR promoter, enhancing
  EGFR transcription and activating the EGFR‐ERK signalling pathway, significantly
  promoting HCC invasion and metastasis
