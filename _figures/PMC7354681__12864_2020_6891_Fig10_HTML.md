  homosphaera. The metabolites are shown in black, and the enzymes are shown in yellow.
  G3P: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, MA: malic acid, OAA: oxaloacetate, PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate,
  3-PGA: 3-phosphoglycerate, Pyr: pyruvate, RuBP: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, BCT:
  bicarbonate transporter, CA: carbonic anhydrase, MDH: malate dehydrogenase, ME:
  malic enzyme, PC: pyruvate carboxylase, PEPC: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, PPDK:
  pyruvate, phosphate dikinase, RuBisCO: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase,
  PHO: phototropins, CRY: cryptochromes, PHY: phytochrome. In nutrient transport,
  a solid line or circle indicates that the gene has been identified, and a dashed
  circle indicates that the gene may be present. Metabolic pathway reconstruction
  was performed based on the KEGG database'
