caption: PI3′K signaling modules in mammals and nematodes have implications for cancer.
  (a) The C. elegans AGE-1 PI3′K homolog is recruited by the DAF-2 IRL protein. PI3′K
  generates PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, whereas the DAF-18 PTEN homolog degrades this second
  messenger. PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and its derivative PtdIns-3,4-P2 lead to the activation
  of Akt-family kinases. AKT-1 and AKT-2 may directly phosphorylate the DAF-16 forkhead
  transcription factor, thereby antagonizing its function (). DAF-16 forkhead activity
  leads to induction of the dauer state (, ). Loss of DAF-16 activity prevents dauer
  formation. (b) In mammals, PTEN and PI3′K similarly antagonize one another to regulate
  local PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 levels and thus Akt activation. Although C. elegans Akt homologs
  have not been shown to play a role in nematode programmed cell death, mammalian
  Akt can potently protect cells against apoptosis. DAF-16 homologs () of the FKHR
  family () may play a role in the regulation of apoptosis by Akt. (c) PTEN and PI3′K
  regulate the integration of extracellular survival signals into the normal cell
  division cycle. Loss of PTEN results in increased Akt activity and increased cell
  survival even in the presence of the proapoptotic cues induced by aberrant cell
  division.
