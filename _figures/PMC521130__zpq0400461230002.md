caption: The S. cerevisiae GAL pathway and its degeneration in S. kudriavzevii. Pseudogenes
  and degenerate or missing components of S. kudriavzevii are shown in red. (A) Regulation
  of the GAL pathway and other Gal4p target genes in S. cerevisiae (refs. – and –;
  SGD) and corresponding S. kudriavzevii loci. Genes are represented by arrows for
  genes on the Watson strand (pointing right) and genes on the Crick strand (pointing
  left). Roman numerals indicate chromosome number. A single Gal4p UAS (, ) from S.
  cerevisiae is indicated by a single bar, and multiple UASs for a given gene are
  indicated by a double bar. A single Gal4p UAS allows moderate activation of transcription
  in the presence of galactose and low-level activation in the absence of galactose,
  whereas multiple Gal4p UASs allow strong activation in the presence of galactose
  and almost no activation without galactose (, , ). Gal4p UASs activate downstream
  promoters, but both divergent promoters are not always affected; GAL1, GAL10, GCY1,
  and MTH1 are activated by Gal4p, but RIO1 and RNH202 are not (, , ). Consensus Mig1p
  binding sites () responsible for catabolite repression () are indicated by filled
