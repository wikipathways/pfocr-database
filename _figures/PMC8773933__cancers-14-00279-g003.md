caption: Bcl-2 family of proteins and their role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
  The anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) inhibit the activity of the pro-apoptotic
  proteins. The anti-apoptotic proteins are inhibited by sensitizer BH3-only proteins
  (Bik, Bad, Noxa) and activator BH3-only proteins (Bid, Bim). Activator BH3-only
  proteins, through binding to pore-forming proteins (Bax, Bak) induce their conformational
  change, oligomerization, and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. This causes
  the release of cytochrome c, which associates with APAF1 to form the apoptosome
  activating procaspase-9. The apoptogenic factor SMAC released from the intermembrane
  space inhibits XIAP, an apoptosis inhibitor that binds caspases. Created with BioRender.com
