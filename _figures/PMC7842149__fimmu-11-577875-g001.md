caption: 'The roles of the RAAS in health and COVID-19: A better and worse scenarios—(A)
  Basal angiotensin system. Figure representing the classic RAAS pathway. Angiotensin
  I (ANG I) is produced from angiotensinogen by renin. ANG I is converted to Angiotensin
  II (ANG II) by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE). ANG II exerts its actions by
  binding to AT1R. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), is responsible for converting
  ANG I to Angiotensin 1-9 (ANG 1-9) and ANG II to Angiotensin 1-7 (ANG 1-7). ANG
  1-7 has opposite effects to ANG II, counterbalancing ANG II physiological outcome.
  ADAM 17 and TPMRSS2 are sheddases responsible for cleaving tACE2 into its soluble
  form, sACE2. ADAM17 cleaves tACE2 in a constitutively manner, while TMPRSS2 is implicated
  in SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting virus entry the cell host. (B) COVID-19 Best
  Scenario (for a better understanding, follow the order of numbers). Increased TMPRSS2
  activity due to viral entry resulting in reduced tACE2 and consequent increase in
  sACE2, unable to convert ANG II in ANG 1-7. This will lead to increased ANG II levels,
  and increased AT1R activation, resulting in higher ADAM-17 activity. Higher ADAM-17
  activity will increase biologically active sACE2 levels, able to convert ANG II
  in ANG 1-7, resulting in no alteration in ANG 1-7 levels. In this scenario, the
  intense tACE2 cleavage promoted by ANG II/AT1R/ADAM-17 axis will reduce virus entry
  into the cells. (C) COVID-19 Worst Scenario Note that this scenario is closely related
  to an incapacity in promote the ANG II peak or AT1R down-regulation, as suggested
  to the use of ACE inhibitors, genetic factors (i.e. A blood type), diabetes mellitus
  and cardiovascular diseases. (for a better understanding, follow the order of numbers).
  Increased TMPRSS2 activity due to viral entry resulting in a mild reduction tACE2
  as well as a mild increase in sACE2, unable to convert ANG II into ANG 1-7. Consequently,
  ANG II levels will remain equal or even decrease, as well as AT1R activation, and
  resulting in ANG 1-7 decrease. In this scenario, the equal or low levels of ANG
  II, AT1R, and ADAM-17 activities will be associated to a mild decrease in tACE2
  and a substantial increase in sACE2 produced by TPMRSS2, increasing the virus entry
  into the cells.'
