caption: Recognition of microorganisms and induction of innate immune responses in
  Drosophila. (A) The primary humoral response, i.e. activation of the proPO cascade
  leading to melanization, is induced by the cleavage of proPO to PO by a serine protease,
  proPO-activating enzyme (PPAE). (B) A constitutive hemolymph protein, PGRP-LE, binds
  to monomeric and polymeric DAP-type peptidoglycans (PGNs), which are components
  of many Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria, and activates the proPO cascade
  upstream of PPAE. PGRP-LE is also involved in activating the secondary humoral response,
  the imd pathway-dependent induction of antibacterial peptides. (C) Membrane PGRP-LC
  is also required for monomeric and polymeric DAP-type peptidoglycan-mediated activation
  of the imd pathway. (D) PGRP-SA in the hemolymph is involved in the recognition
  of Gram-positive bacteria with Lys-type peptidoglycans and is required for activation
  of the Toll pathway in cooperation with GNBP1. PGRP-SD has some redundant functions
  with PGRP-SA and GNBP1. (E) GNBP3 is involved in yeast-mediated activation of the
  Toll pathway. (F) The activation of the Toll pathway is mediated by its active ligand,
  Spz, cleaved from pro-Spz by the serine protease cascade, including the SPE, Spheroide,
  Spirit, Sphinx, Persephone, ModSP and Grass. (G) In addition to the extracellular
  functions, PGRP-LE induces anti-microbial peptides through the imd pathway and autophagy
  in the cytoplasm. Signaling via the Toll or imd pathway activates NF-κB and subsequent
  transcription of genes for anti-microbial peptides such as Drosomycin and Diptericin.
