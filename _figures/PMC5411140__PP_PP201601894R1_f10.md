caption: A proposed pathway for 10:0-rich TAG assembly in transgenic camelina seeds
  coexpressing CvLPAT2 and CpuDGAT1. Acyl-CoA species of 10:0 and 18:1 are sequentially
  esterified to glycerol-3-P (G3P) at sn-1 and sn-2 positions by GPAT and LPAT, forming
  LPA and PA. The release of P from PA by phosphatidic acid phosphatase forms DAG.
  The subsequent acylation of DAG at sn-3 catalyzed by DGAT forms TAG. DAG can be
  converted to PC via the action of DAG/CPT and/or PDCT. DAG molecules containing
  10:0 at the sn-2 position arise from the specialized activity of the Cuphea LPAT
  CvLPAT2. DAGs containing 10:0 at the sn-2 position are selectively used for acylation
  with 10:0-CoA at the sn-3 position by activity of the specialized Cuphea diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase CpuDGAT1 to form TAG species enriched in 10:0. DAG molecules containing
  10:0 appear to be poor substrates for PC synthesis, or 10:0 is rapidly removed from
  PC formed from 10:0-DAG species. As such, 10:0 accumulation in TAG appears to proceed
  primarily by the Kennedy pathway rather than through PC via activity of enzymes
  including PDCT and phospholipid/diacylglycerol acyltransferase, which catalyzes
  the transfer of fatty acids at the sn-2 position of PC to the sn-3 position of DAG
  producing TAG and lysophosphatidylcholine. The PC route of fatty acid flux for TAG
  synthesis involves primarily flux of 18:1 for desaturation to 18:2 and 18:3. LPC,
  lysophosphatidylcholine; PAP, phosphatidic acid phosphatase; PDAT, phospholipid/diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase.
