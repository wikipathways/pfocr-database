caption: Proposed mechanisms driving localized decidualization in the cycling human
  endometrium. Prostaglandins can enhance the decidualization process in the human
  endometrium. In vivo, decidualization originates in the stroma surrounding the vascular
  endothelium. Activation of endothelial cells by physiological cues such as shear
  stress forces can induce the prostaglandin pathway in endothelial cells and promote
  the secretion of prostaglandins. Specifically, PGI2 and to a certain extent PGE2,
  but not PGD2, can accelerate decidualization in adjacent endometrial stromal cells
  via their respective prostaglandin receptors. These events promote the enhanced
  response to progesterone (P4) via cAMP activation that lead to increased decidualization.
