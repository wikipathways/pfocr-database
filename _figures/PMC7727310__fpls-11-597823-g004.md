caption: 'Pathway map summarizing the effect of growth stage (flowering) and photoperiodic
  lighting treatments: NL, NL + photoperiodic lighting with fluorescence light (FL),
  NL + photoperiodic lighting with LEDs R:FR 3:1 (R:FR 3:1), and NL + photoperiodic
  lighting with LEDs R:FR 1:3 (R:FR 1:3), on leaves and tuberous roots of the two
  hybrids MBO (A) and MDR (B) of Ranunculus asiaticus L. The heat map results were
  calculated as Logarithm base 1.5 (Log1.5) of single values/total average values
  and visualized using a false-color scale, with red indicating an increase and blue
  a decrease. The significant ratios were indicated in the squares.'
