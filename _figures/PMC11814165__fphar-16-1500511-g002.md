caption: Illustrating of the binding mechanisms of berberine with PLA2, MD2, BACE1,
  Aβ1-42, TGFBR1, and JAK2 in human cells. (A) Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) converts phospholipids
  into arachidonic acid, which is then transformed into prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) by
  cyclooxygenase-1/2 (COX-1/2) and subsequently into prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) by hematopoietic
  prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS). Berberine exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by
  inhibiting PLA2, thereby reducing arachidonic acid production. (B) Lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS) initiate inflammatory responses via the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/MD-2 signaling
  pathway. Berberine disrupts this pathway by binding to MD-2, mitigating the inflammatory
  response. (C) In the amyloidogenic pathway, amyloid precursor protein is cleaved
  by beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) to generate amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides. The accumulation
  and aggregation of Aβ peptides lead to neurotoxic amyloid plaques, inducing senile
  plaques, apoptosis, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) within mitochondria.
  Berberine inhibits BACE1 and Aβ, exerting anti-aging and antioxidant effects. (D)
  Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) binds to heteromeric receptor complexes
  composed of TGF-β receptor 1 (TGFBR1) and TGF-β receptor 2 (TGFBR2), triggering
  signal transduction. This leads to the phosphorylation of SMAD family members, which
  then migrate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Berberine inhibits the
  binding of TGF-β to its receptor complex, reducing the expression of inflammatory
  genes, including RORγt, RORα, and IL-22. Additionally, berberine inhibits the phosphorylation
  of STAT proteins by inhibiting Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), further exerting anti-inflammatory
  effects
