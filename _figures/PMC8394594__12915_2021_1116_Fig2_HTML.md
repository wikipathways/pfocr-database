caption: Local increase of cAMP and Ca2+ coupled to odorant receptors expressed at
  the cilia and at the axon terminal. Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway coupled
  to the odorant receptors (OR) expressed at the cilia and at the axon terminal of
  olfactory sensory neurons. Both the ORs expressed at the cilia and the ORs at the
  axon terminal are coupled to local increase of cAMP and Ca2+. At the cilia, the
  influx of Ca2+ through the CNG channels leads to the opening of Ca2+-dependent Cl-
  channels (not shown in figure). The presence of these Cl- channels also at the axon
  terminal remains elusive. AC III adenylyl cyclase III, CaM Calmodulin, PDE phosphodiesterase,
  PEBP1 phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein-1 indicated by blue dots, at the
  axon terminal, while odorant molecules are indicated by dots of different colors,
  at the cilia
