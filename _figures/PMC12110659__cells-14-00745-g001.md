caption: 'Immune Resistance Mechanisms. (A) Immunosuppressive Cells and Cytokines:
  Recruitment of Tregs, MDSCs, TAMs; secretion of IL-10, TGF-β, VEGF suppresses anti-tumor
  immune responses. (B) MHC/HLA-1 Degradation: Downregulation of MHC I; mutations
  in antigen-processing machinery, impaired antigen presentation, and immune recognition.
  (C) Signaling Pathway Mutations: JAK/STAT mutations: disrupt IFN-γ signaling, reducing
  PD-L1 upregulation or the immune-activating effects of interferons, promoting immune
  evasion and tumor survival. (D) Dynamic Changes of PD-L1 Expression: Tumors increase
  PD-L1 expression in response to inflammatory signals in the microenvironment. Tumors
  may downregulate PD-L1 expression temporarily to avoid detection by PD-1/PD-L1-targeting
  immunotherapies, enabling tumors to escape immune detection while adapting to changes
  in the immune microenvironment or therapy. (E) Genetic Mutations: Tumor cells acquire
  genetic mutations that directly or indirectly impact immune recognition and response.
  Drives immune evasion and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. High mutational
  burden generates neoantigens that recruit the immune system, but certain mutations
  (e.g., in β2-microglobulin or JAK1/2) suppress immune recognition and response.
