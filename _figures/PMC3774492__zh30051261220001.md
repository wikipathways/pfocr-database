caption: Major molecular pathways mediating cholangiocyte proliferation. Regulation
  of cholangiocyte proliferation occurs through 1) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)-induced
  cAMP production and downstream PKA and/or exchange proteins activated directly by
  cyclic AMP (EPAC) activation; 2) GPCR activation of Ca2+, or PKC pathway, or inhibition
  by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) pathway; and 3) tyrosine kinase activation
  and JAK/STAT or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. Induction of these
  pathways can activate transcription factors for genes involved in proliferation
  and the synthesis of growth factors that participate in an autocrine loop. AC, adenylyl
  cyclase; LKB1, liver kinase B1.
