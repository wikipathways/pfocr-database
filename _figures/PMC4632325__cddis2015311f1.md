caption: Autophagy dysfunction in mutant FUS-linked ALS (a) Initiation of autophagy
  occurs at the ER. Firstly, an omegasome is formed from the ER membrane. The omegasome
  is characterised by the presence of DFCP1, which is mobilized from the Golgi apparatus.
  The isolation membrane then forms the omegasome. Additional membrane obtained from
  Golgi vesicles, containing membrane associated proteins ATG9, TRAPP as well as Rab1,
  is added to the isolation membrane to form the double layered autophagosome. LC3,
  a widely used autophagosome marker, is then recruited to the autophagosome membrane.
  Autophagic receptors p62 and NBR1, which both bind to ubiquitinated proteins and
  target ubiquitinated protein to autophagosomes, are also recruited to the autophagosome
  membrane. The autophagosome then fuses with the lysosome to form the autolysosome.
  In cells expressing mutant FUS, mutant FUS inhibits the formation of the autophagosome,
  omegasome, and autolysosome. (b) In fALS patients, (1) although autophagosomes do
  not form as readily in mutant FUS expressing cells, over the course of human disease,
  eventually functional autophagy is inhibited, leading to the accumulation of autophagosomes
  (dashed arrow). (2) The lack of autolysosomes may lead to an increase the number
  of autophagosomes in human patient motor neurons. (3) Another possibility is that
  the increase in LC3 vesicles in fALS patient motor neurons is due to induction of
  the non-canonical autophagy pathway (red dotted arrow). mFUS, mutant FUS
