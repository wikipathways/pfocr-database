caption: 'Molecular mechanisms in Carney complex (CNC) and McCune-Albright syndrome
  (MAS): Receptor activation (ligand binding) makes Gsα to exchange GDP to GTP, Gsα
  is then freed from the β-γ dimer and activates adenyl cyclase (AC). Under normal
  conditions intrinsic turn off takes place through GTP-to-GDP exchange and Gsα gets
  inactivated. In McCune-Albright syndrome patients, GNAS mutations inhibit Gsa intrinsic
  turn off and leads to constant Gsa and AC activation. Activated AC produces cAMP,
  cAMP causes dissociation of the inactive protein kinase A (PKA) tetramer and then
  the catalytic subunits are freed to mediate serine-threonine phosphorylation of
  target molecules, including CREB. Phosphorylated CREB and other downstream targets
  will activate the interacting pathways that control metabolism, growth or proliferation.
  PRKAR1A inactivating mutations in Carney complex patients will result in less binding
  of the catalytic to the regulatory subunits and excessive cAMP signaling. PDE8B
  and PDE11A mutations in patients with adrenal hyperplasias lead to less cAMP degradation
  and to excess cAMP signaling. Downstream effects of the excessive cAMP/PKA signaling
  in Carney complex patients include higher CREB phosphorylation, possible MAPK and
  Rb/E2F pathway activation among others, SMAD3 inactivation, and increased β-catenin
  nuclear localization (activation of the Wnt pathway) at least in adrenal lesions
  of patients with Carney complex.'
