caption: Alarmins and regulated-cell-death pathways modulate the release of DAMPs
  from airway macrophages (AMs). (A) Alarmins are a class of danger signals that are
  actively secreted from cells before they die, and some can precondition AMs to boost
  intracellular concentrations of biologically active DAMPs available for efficient
  release. Exposure to pathogenic particles or pathogens can induce LMP, which can
  induce activation of the inflammasome and oxidative stress (solid green arrows).
  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) boost inflammasome activation, and the rapid release
  of TNFα from AMs, and promote formation of dsHMGB1 (immunostimulatory disulfide
  form of high-mobility group box 1) (solid orange arrows). TNFα binds to membrane-associated
  TNFR1, leading to the activation of NF-κB (solid red arrows), a transcription factor
  that induces expression of full-length IL-1 family cytokine precursors, which are
  retained in the cytosol or cleaved into their mature forms by active CASP1. In stressed
  cells, TNFR1 is internalized and activates CASP8 and CASP3 (solid black arrow).
  CASP3 initiates the apoptotic program (solid purple arrow), leading to fragmentation
  of nuclear chromatin into nucleosomes, disruption of the nuclear membrane, and alterations
  in mitochondrial function and permeability. (B) Small DAMPs (micro-DAMPs) are easily
  released by AMs after pore insertion in the plasma membrane induced by secondary
  necrosis, pyroptosis, or necroptosis (programmed necrosis). In the absence of additional
  mechanical stressors, AMs are able resist lysis and efficient release of larger
  DAMPs via this pathway alone (solid cell boundary). (C) LMP can induce parallel
  induction of programmed necrosis culminating in pore insertion (cylinder with black
  arrow) and lysosome-dependent cell death that can induce osmotic lysis of AMs and
  the release of larger, more immunogenic DAMPs (macro-DAMPs). Cathepsins released
  into the cytosol from leaky lysosomes activate cytosolic calpains (solid black arrows)
  to break down the cytoskeleton. This further destabilizes the plasma membrane in
  AMs and allows pore insertion to result in rupture of the plasma membrane (dashed
  cell boundary) and efficient release of both micro- and macro-DAMPs (solid black
  arrows). ASC = apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD; ET = extracellular
  trap; mtDNA = mitochondrial DNA.
