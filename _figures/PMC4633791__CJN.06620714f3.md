caption: 'Induction of cell lines of spy cells into functionally distinct Treg lines.
  The most common method of expanding natural T regulatory cells (nTregs) is polyclonal
  activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 with high concentrations of IL-2 (top pathway).
  This expands nTregs that retain the nTreg phenotype and have no increased potency
  to suppress. In the last few years, it has been appreciated that nTregs (CD4+CD25+CD127loFOXP3+T)
  are not an end line of cells that only functions to suppress the initiation of immune
  cells in a nonantigen-specific manner. The pathways for activation of nTregs with
  T cell receptors that recognize the specific antigen are as complex as those described
  for activation of effector T cells, which are outlined in . With antigen and high
  concentrations of IL-2, nTregs within days express receptors for Th1 cytokines,
  IFN-γ, and IL-12 () (middle pathway). They have enhanced capacity to suppress to
  specific antigen. This is a first step in activation of these cells, which we call
  Ts1 cells (). If inflammation persists, Th1 cytokines IFN-γ and IL-12 (in the absence
  of IL-2) can further expand the antigen-specific Treg (). These are highly potent
  Th1-like Tregs that express both FOXP3 and T-bet (the Th1 transcription factor)
  and produce IFN-γ but not IL-2 (). Other cytokines induce separate pathways: Th2,
  Th17, and Tfh responses induced Th2-, Th17-, and Tfh-like Tregs, respectively. As
  an example, specific antigen and IL-4, in the absence of IL-2, activate antigen-specific
  Ts2 cells that express receptor for IL-4 and IL-5 but not for IFN-γ and IL-12 ()
  (bottom pathway). They enhance antigen-specific suppressor capacity and can be further
  activated by specific antigen and IL-5 in the absence of IL-4 to Th2-like Tregs
  that have a very potent antigen–specific suppressor capacity.'
