caption: 'Iron-dependent lipid peroxidation is the hallmark of ferroptosis. The cystine/glutamate
  transporter, consisting of the SLC3A2 and SLC7A11 (alias xCT) subunits, (collectively
  known as system xc−) imports cystine in exchange for glutamate. Glutamate is produced
  via glutaminase (GLS) -dependent glutaminolysis of glutamine. If not exported, glutamate
  can either be converted into α-ketoglutarate and enter the TCA cycle or participate
  to glutathione (GSH) synthesis via two sequential reactions catalyzed by glutamate–cysteine
  ligase (GCL) and glutathione synthetase (GSS). Glutathione peroxidase GPX4 uses
  GSH to buffer lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protect cells from ferroptosis. The oxidized
  glutathione (GSSG) is then reduced to GSH via glutathione–disulfide reductase (GSR)
  using NADPH as electron donor. GSH is a tripeptide antioxidant derived from glutamate,
  glycine and cysteine, which is turn produced by the reduction of cystine catalyzed
  by the thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXRD1). Along with the GPX4/GSH system, the TXRD/TXN
  and the peroxiredoxin (PRDX) systems can convert the phospholipid hydroperoxides
  (H2O2 LOOH) to alcohols and water (H2O LOH). The AIFM2 (FSP1)–CoQ10 can also counteract
  LPO and ferroptosis. Moreover, the mevalonate pathway, can indirectly inhibit ferroptosis
  giving rise to CoQ10 and producing the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) that is the
  precursor for the selenium (Se)-containing GPX4. Also, the GCH1–dihydrofolate reductase
  (DHFR) system protects lipid membranes from autoxidation catalyzing the biosynthesis
  of the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Many proteins involved in iron transport, storage
  and metabolism are key determinants of ferroptosis execution: these include transferrin
  (TF), lactotranferrin (LTF), transferrin receptor (TFRC), solute carrier family
  40 member 1 (SLC40A1), heme oxygenase (HMOX1) and ferritin components (FTH1 and
  FTL). Also, the mitochondrial proteins cysteine desulfurase (NFS1) and iron–sulfur
  cluster assembly (ISCU) can reduce the availability of iron by sequestering Fe2+
  for the biosynthesis of iron–sulfur clusters (2Fe–2S). The iron-regulatory proteins
  CISD1, CISD2, ACO1 and FBXL5/IREB2 usually negatively regulate ferroptosis. However,
  under low 2Fe–2S, ACO1 and IREB2 can translationally regulate iron metabolism-related
  proteins (such as TFRC, SLC11A2, SLC40A1, FTH1 and FTL), thus facilitating ferroptosis.
  Lipid synthesis and metabolism also play a central role in ferroptosis, by regulating
  the availability of substrates for LPO. Acetyl- CoA carboxylase (ACC)/FASN axis
  mediates the synthesis of fatty acids (FA), mainly saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated
  (MUFA), which have low susceptibility to LPO. SFA/MUFA are conjugated to CoA by
  the long-chain fatty acid–CoA ligase 3 (ACSL3) prior to be incorporated into membrane
