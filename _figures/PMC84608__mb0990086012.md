caption: Model for the central role of the E2F transcription factors in cell proliferation
  and apoptosis. The stimulation of resting cells with growth factors results in the
  induction of a signal cascade leading to the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
  protein (pRB) by D-type cyclins in association with CDK4 or CDK6, as well as the
  activation of the E2F transcription factors. The E2F transcription factors are essential
  for controlling several genes whose products are required for DNA replication, cell
  cycle progression, and/or growth. Deregulation of E2F activity as a result of upstream
  mutations in the pathway leads to premature entry into S phase of the cell cycle
  and—depending on the genetic status of the cell—to hyperproliferation or apoptosis.
  E2F-induced apoptosis occurs via p53-dependent and -independent pathways. One of
  the connections between the pRB and p53 pathways is provided by ARF, and the transactivation
  of ARF by the E2Fs may be involved in p53-dependent apoptosis. Presently we do not
  know which gene products are implicated in p53-independent E2F-induced apoptosis.
  PIGs, p53-induced genes; IGF-BP3, insulin growth factor-binding protein 3.
