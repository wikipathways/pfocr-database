caption: A mechanism of the CIRP-enhanced Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway. Abnormally
  increased cytoplasmic CIRP in NSCLC cells promotes CTNNB1 protein expression through
  post-transcriptional regulation. That is, it binds to the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR of CTNNB1
  mRNA to increase its mRNA stability and facilitate its IRES-dependent translation.
  The elevated CTNNB1 protein persistently activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  which results in an increase in downstream oncogene expression and promotes NSCLC
  progression
