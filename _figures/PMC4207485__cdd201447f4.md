caption: Survival pathways activated by the binding of NGF to TrkA. The binding of
  NGF to its receptor TrkA can activate the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, which can
  inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival. The binding of NGF to TrkA triggers
  the activation of the small GTP-binding protein Ras. The subsequent activation of
  Akt through PI3K can inhibit apoptosis by phosphorylating, and therefore inactivating,
  proapoptotic proteins such as the BH3-only protein Bad and the transcription factor
  FOXO. The binding of NGF to its receptor TrkA can also activate the Raf-MEK-ERK
  signalling pathway. This pathway promotes survival by inhibiting the expression
  of Bim, and by activating Rsk, which phosphorylates and activates the transcription
  factor CREB, which can activate the transcription of the bcl-2 gene
