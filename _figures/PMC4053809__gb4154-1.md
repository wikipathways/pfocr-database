caption: piRNA biogenesis. Two pathways, primary piRNA biogenesis and the Ping-Pong
  cycle, have been implicated in generation of piRNAs in Drosophila germ cells, whereas
  only primary piRNA biogenesis operates in follicular cells. Long RNAs transcribed
  from piRNA cluster regions are exported from the nucleus to nuage granules, where
  many protein components involved in the piRNA pathway localize and where piRNA biogenesis
  is believed to occur. During primary piRNA biogenesis long piRNA precursors are
  cleaved by an endonuclease, possibly Zucchini, located in the outer membrane of
  mitochondria, generating the 5′ end of the future piRNA. The cleaved transcript
  is loaded into Piwi proteins (Piwi and Aub) and then trimmed from the 3′ end by
  an unidentified trimmer nuclease to its final length. In the Ping-Pong cycle, Aub
  loaded with piRNAs recognizes and cleaves complementary RNAs such as transposon
  (TE) mRNAs or transcripts derived from the opposite strand of the same piRNA cluster.
  This cleavage produces the 5′ end of a new piRNA that is loaded into Ago3 and in
  turn can induce cleavage of complementary RNA. This generates a new piRNA that is
  identical in sequence to the piRNA that initiated the cycle.
