caption: 'Genetic polymorphisms more consistently associated with non-alcoholic fatty

  domain-containing protein 3 is a lipase involved in the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol
  and is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and directly on the surface of lipid
  droplets. Patients with the I148M variant have a reduced enzymatic activity which
  impairs the mobilization of fatty acids and favors the development of steatosis.
  Transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 is involved in the enrichment of triglycerides
  to apolipoprotein B100 in the pathway of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion
  from hepatocytes. The E167K variant causes a retention of triglycerides in hepatic
  lipid droplets and a reduced secretion of VLDL. A lower expression of membrane bound
  O-acyltransferase domain containing 7 associated with the rs641738 allele determines
  changes in the hepatic phosphatidylinositol acyl-chain remodeling, increased hepatic
  fat content and histological damage. Finally, glucokinase regulatory gene regulates
  de novo lipogenesis by controlling the influx of glucose in hepatocytes. The P446L
  variant increases hepatic fat accumulation by stimulating lipogenesis and glucose
  uptake. PNPLA3: Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3; TM6SF2:
