caption: 'Molecular mechanisms for the functions of estrogen receptors. Genomic pathway:
  Estrogen binding leads to dimerization of ERs, then ERs translocate into nucleus
  and interact with transcriptional co-activators and/or co-repressor and bind to
  genomic DNA at specific sequences known as estrogen response elements (EREs) to
  activate or repress the transcription of specific genes. Non-genomic signaling pathway:
  Membrane ERs interact with SRC/G protein and activate PI3K/Akt signaling. Both MAPK
  signaling initiated by binding of growth factors to receptor tyrosine kinases and
  PI3K/Akt signaling can modify cytosolic ERs, which may interact with other transcription
  factors and modulate the transcription of specific genes. GF: Growth factor; RTK:
  Receptor tyrosine kinase; GP: G proteins; CoA: Transcription co-activator; CoR:
  Transcription co-receptor; TFs: Transcription factors; MAPK: Mitogen activated protein
  kinase; PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3 kinase; ERs: Estrogen receptors.'
