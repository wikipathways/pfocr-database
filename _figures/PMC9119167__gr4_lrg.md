caption: 'The antiviral mechanisms of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). Yellow box: 25HC
  inhibits cholesterol transport by reducing the expression of Niemann–Pick protein
  C1 (NPC1) or interacting with oxysterol-binding proteins (OSBP) and NPC1 directly,
  which both result in accumulation of cholesterol in late endosome (LE) that impedes
  viral vesicle fusing with LE. Blue box: 25HC disturbs prenylation of viral proteins
  by reducing production of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP) in the dependent pathway of sterol-regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP)-2;
  25HC promotes production of abnormal viral glycoprotein by increasing the sensitivity
  of the N-linked glycan to endoglycosidase. Green box: 25HC impairs lipid raft in
  the cytomembrane by stimulating expression of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette
  (ABC) A1/ABCG1 in the dependent pathway of liver X receptor (LXR) and may reduce
  clathrin-coated pits by inhibiting NPC1 in order to suppress viral entry; 25HC depletes
  the level of cholesterol in the membrane and disturbs the synthesis of intracellular
  lipids required for viral invasion by activating LXR and cholesteryl ester by acyl-coenzyme
  A: cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT) and inhibiting the SREBP pathway.'
