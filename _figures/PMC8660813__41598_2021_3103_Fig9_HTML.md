caption: Schematic of the mechanism of the Kin-PCD signalling pathway based on the
  suggestions presented by Doniak et al. and Kunikowska et al. and the results described
  in the present study on the root cortex of Vicia faba ssp. minor seedlings. Kin
  transported to the cell through purine transporter (PUP) is converted to riboside
  and then to ribonucleotide (ribotide). The ribotide activates histidine kinase (HK)
  receptors (i.e., HK4), which activates the ethylene (ETH)-dependent signalling pathway
  using histidine-containing phosphotransmitter (HPT) and Ca2+-dependent channels.
  These channels are needed to release Ca2+ (also from MIT), which is important for
  the activation of Ca2+-dependent ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) synthase
  (Ca2+-ACS). Then, the action of serine and cysteine proteases and exo-/endonucleases
  of the execution/dying phase lead to protoplast and cell wall degradation, appearing
  as aerenchyma formation. Simultaneously, HPT may stimulate a cytokinin response
  regulator (RR-B) and synthesis of Ca2+-dependent ACC oxidase (ACO), which may enhance
  the PCD effect by activating ETH-dependent genes through ethylene response elements
  (EREs). Moreover, by stimulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism enzymes
  with HPT (CK-dependent genes), the protective role of Kin against Kin-PCD might
  be activated. (1) Cytokinin histidine kinase 4 (HK4) receptors; (2) ETH histidine
