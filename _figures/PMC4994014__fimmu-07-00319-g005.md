caption: B-cell apoptosis. IL-21 can also induce apoptosis of B-cells when activated
  by LPS, TLRs, CpG, anti-IgM, or IL-4 in the absence of T-cell signals. In the absence
  of such molecules, the balance between STAT1 and STAT3 regulates B-cell apoptosis
  via the IL-21 signaling pathway. STAT1 induces cell death, while, conversely, STAT3
  exerts an anti-apoptotic effect. Bim also plays an apoptotic role and BCL-XL an
  anti-apoptotic role.
