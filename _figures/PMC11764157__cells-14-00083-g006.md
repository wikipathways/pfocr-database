caption: Effects of CBG on AD models. In the DNCB-induced AD model, the JAK/STAT signaling
  and NF-κB signaling pathways are activated by the combination of various inflammatory
  cytokines that have been found to have therapeutic effects on AD by modulating the
  signaling of these pathways. CBG, cannabigerol; AD, atopic dermatitis; DNCB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene
