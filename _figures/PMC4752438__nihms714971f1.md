caption: Olfactory receptor (OR) signaling pathways. A) The canonical OR signaling
  pathway in the olfactory epithelium. OR-ligand binding activates Golfactory (Golf)
  leading to increased cAMP via Adenylate Cyclase 3 (AC3) and the subsequent depolarization
  of olfactory sensory neurons. B) The potential OR signaling pathways in the kidney.
  As Golf and AC3 are not ubiquitous in the nephron, it is likely that an activated
  renal OR binds a stimulatory G protein (Gs) leading to cAMP production by different
  adenylate cyclases and changes in renal function.
