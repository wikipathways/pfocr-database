caption: Melatonin signalling in Schwann cells. MT1 is the dominant receptor mediating
  melatonin signalling in Schwann cells via three coupled G–proteins—Gi, Gs, and Gq,
  and also the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Activation of Gs leads to a conversion of
  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by the adenylyl
  cyclase (AC). In turn, cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) to phosphorylate mitogen
  activated protein kinase (MEK) and Raf. MEK activation via Gs occurs through sequential
  phosphorylation of multiple kinases—beginning with cAMP, followed by PKA, phosphatidylinositol–3–kinase
  (PI3K), phosphoinositide–dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), PKC, and MEK. Activation of
  Gs inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and the corresponding downstream signalling. Gq,
  which is coupled to the MT1 receptor, activates phospholipase c (PLC) and hydrolyses
  membrane–located phosphatidylinositol–4,5–biphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol (DAG)
  and inositol–1,4,5–triphosphate (IP3). IP3 activates a calcium channel in the endoplasmic
  reticulum and induces calcium release into the cytosol. DAG and calcium ions synergistically
  activate protein kinase C (PKC), which can regulate also MEK. In summary, MEK seems
  to be the central hub of the melatonin–mediated signalling, where all regulatory
  pathways converge. However, the upstream kinase of the MAPK cascade Ras becomes
  also activated by the MT1 receptor (the mechanism is not fully clear). Melatonin
  upregulates SOX2 (Schwann cell de–differentiation), SHH and Gli1 (signalling components
  of the Sonic hedgehog pathway mediating Schwann cell migration), as well as BDNF
  and GDNF (brain and glial derived neurotrophic factors supporting the axo–glial
  interaction). Melatonin elevates the expression of parkin, which mediates mitophagy
  in Schwann cells, thus reducing the amount of reactive species as well as oxidative
  stress. Collagen and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which are components of
  the extracellular matrix, are being downregulated, while the focal adhesion kinase
  (FAK) that regulates the interplay between a Schwann cell and its basal lamina is
  upregulated.
