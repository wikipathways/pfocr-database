caption: Caspase signaling and its modulation. In the extrinsic pathway, DISC formation
  leads to caspase-8 activation. Two signaling pathways downstream from the receptor
  were established. In type I cells (shown in light blue) caspase-8 directly cleaves
  caspase-3, which starts the death cascade. In type II cells (shown in light red)
  an additional amplification loop is required, which involves tBid-mediated cytochrome
  c release from mitochondria followed by apoptosome formation. Initiation of the
  intrinsic pathway results in mitochondria-mediated apoptosome formation, followed
  by caspase-9 and -3 activation, leading to destruction of the cell. Caspase action
  can be modulated on several levels. Activation of caspases at the DISC is inhibited
  by c-FLIP proteins; activation of effector caspases is inhibited by IAPs (see text).
  Effector caspases are shown in light green; cellular caspase inhibitors are presented
  in yellow. The targets for pharmacological modulation are shown with an orange arrow.
