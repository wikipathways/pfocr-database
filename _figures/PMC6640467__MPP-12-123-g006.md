caption: Proposed regulatory pathways involving two transcriptional activators, TSF1
  and EfSTE12, and leading to the production of elsinochrome (ESC) and conidia in
  Elsinoë fawcettii. On exposure to light, ESC assumes an activated triplet state
  which reacts with oxygen to produce superoxide (O2·−) through a reducing substrate
  (R) or singlet oxygen (1O2) via an energy relay reaction. A cross indicates an inhibitory
  effect for ESC biosynthesis, presumably by blocking the expression of TSF1 and thus
  of the elsinochrome‐biosynthetic genes. A filled rectangle indicates the inhibitory
  activity of expression of the ESC biosynthetic genes. TSF1 is also required for
  conidiation. The regulation of ESC biosynthesis by EfSTE12 bypasses TSF1 and is
  probably controlled by a mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK)‐mediated signalling
  pathway.
