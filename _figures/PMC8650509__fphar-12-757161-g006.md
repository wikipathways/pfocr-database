caption: SN neuron DA metabolism. In addition to the uptake of DA by the DA transporter
  (DAT) from outside, DAergic neurons in the SN produce DA under the action of tyrosine
  hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in the cytosol. The
  amino acid tyrosine is converted to L-dopa using TH, and the second L-dopa is converted
  to dopamine using AADC. The newly synthesized or taken up DA is immediately transported
  to and stored in the monoaminergic vesicles by VMAT-2, preventing the existence
  of free dopamine in the cytosol. Cytosolic DA oxidizes to dopamine o-quinone (DAQ),
  which is immediately cyclized to aminochrome, which induces mitochondrial dysfunction,
  endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), oxidative stress (OS), the aggregation of alpha-synuclein,
  and the dysfunction of protein degradation. Dopamine in the cytosol can be degraded
  by monoamine oxidase-mediated degradation to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL),
  hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia, which is converted to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
  acid (DOPAC) by aldehyde dehydrogenase. DA can be taken up into glial cells and
  degraded by catechol-o-methyltransferase (CMOT) or monoamine oxidase (MAO) to form
  homovanillic acid (HVA).
