caption: Stress Induced Reprogrammes of Metabolism, Cellular Respiration and Fatty
  acid oxidation. a Hyperactive mTORC1 inhibits mTORC2, resulting in the depletion
  of nutrients, which has a starvation effect and inhibits the mTOC1. Stress activates
  the sympathetic nervous system, and cAMP pathway and the anchorage independent cell
  proliferation. Starvation effect activates the fatty acids uptake and metabolism.
  The binding of fatty acids to the cell surface receptors activate the downstream
  GPCR signalling (Inset box), which activates the second messengers, the diacyl glycerol,
  Inositol phosphates, Ca++ ions, as well as the protein kinases, PKA and PKC signalling
  (see of the text for details). Fatty acids entry into the cells activates the peroxisome
  proliferator activated receptors (PPARα,β and γ), which activate the fatty acids
  uptake and β-oxidation in mitochondria, inhibition of mTORC1 activates AMPK, which
  activates the autophagy and increases the membrane plasticity for enhanced communication
  between the cytoplasm, nucleus and organelles. b EMT induces the PKM2 translocation
  into mitochondria, and together with PDH and the p300 activates the epigenetic trans
  acetylation of histones, p53 and MDM2. The tumour protein p53 is inactive in stem
  cells, acetylation activates the protein. P53 has multiple functions in the survival
  of pluripotent stem cells, in response to amino acids deprivation, it transcribes
  the cell cycle inhibitors and arrests the cell cycle, it activates the transcription
  of components of the cytochrome oxidase (COX2) (complex IV) of the respiratory chain
  in mitochondria and activates respiration. The mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly
  and increases the respiration and metabolic reprogramming. GCN2 dependent activation
  of ATF4 activates the survival pathways of proliferative cells (see Fig. ). c String
  gene network produced by feeding the putative genes (TGFB1 , EPAS1 , ACO1 , IDH1
  , SOD1 , PKM2, HIF1, GCN2 and AMPK) involved in the EMT and metabolic reprogramming

  complex (COX2) assembly, the IDH and aconitase and SOD pathways, which link the
