caption: Interferon synthesis and signaling pathways. Interferons are crucial molecules
  for creating antiviral status. E5 stimulates IFN synthesis through activation of
  NF-κB signalling pathway and IRF-1 protein. (1) PRR/MAVS (Mitochondrial antiviral
  signaling) activates IKK that liberates NF-κB. (2) NF-κB, IRF-3 and ATF-2/c-Jun
  form a transcriptional complex that recruits the (3) CPB/P300 enhancer to IFN-β
  promoter. (4) This complex (along with IRF-1) binds to (5) particular DNA regions
  (PRDI, PRDII and PRDIV) which results in (6) IFN-β gene transcription. In IFN-independent
  way, (7) viral dsRNA induces (8) PKR-IRF3 signalling. The produced IFNs exert their
  activities in keratinocytes by (9) interacting with specific IFN-type receptor and
  (10) triggering JAK/STAT signalling pathways. IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-λ interact with
  receptors associated with JAK1 and Tyk2 tyrosine kinases which induce the activation
  and dimer formation of the transcriptional factor STAT1/STAT2 by phosphorylation.
  This dimer forms a complex with IFN-stimulatory gene factor- 3γ (ISGF-3γ), also
  called IFN regulatory factor-9 (IRF-9) or P48, which bind to the ISRE sequence of
  DNA. In turn, IFN-γ binds to receptors associated with Jak1 and Jak2 tyrosine kinases
  that induce the formation of the Stat1/Stat1 homodimer. Finally, (11) the binding
  of transcription factors to specific responsive elements (i.e. ISRE and GAS) of
  DNA leads to (12) ISGs expression []. This IFN-induced activities create an antiviral
  state which leads to the destruction of infected cells with episomal HPV [], whereas
  cells with integrated viral DNA can survive and transcription of E6-E7 oncogenes
  are no longer regulated by E2 leading to persistent infection and cancer formation
