caption: '(a) Synthesis pathway of phenazine metabolites with half-wave redox potentials
  (E1/2) relative to Ag/AgCl at pH 7. (b) A schematic of the sensor fabrication and
  functionalization process: The 3-electrode pattern is created by laser engraving
  machine, then the working electrode (WE) was functionalized with Pt nanoparticles,
  following electrodeposition silver (Ag) on the reference electrode (RE). Finally,
  the sensor is spin-coated with Nafion membrane and attached to the connector for
  electrochemical testing. Two sets of electrochemical tests are performed using the
  sensors: in vitro analysis with broth and simulating medium (WSM) and long-term
  monitoring of colony biofilms on agar. Example pictures of the as-fabricated sensor
  and after attachment to the test connector are shown.'
