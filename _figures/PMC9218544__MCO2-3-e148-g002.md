caption: Biased signaling of Mu opioid receptors (MORs). The analgesic effects and
  adverse effects of MORs ligands are mediated by the G‐protein pathway and β‐arrestin
  pathway, respectively. The analgesic effects are mediated by G proteins, which inhibit
  AC, activate IRP channels, inhibit T‐type Ca2+ channels, and finally decrease the
  excitability of neurons. The adverse effects such as tolerance or respiratory depression
  are mediated by β‐arrestin 2, which leads to the internalization of the receptors.
  AC, adenylyl cyclase; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; Ca2+, calcium ion; Na+,
  sodion; IRP, inwardly rectifying potassium channels; GRKs, G‐protein receptor kinases;
  PKC, protein kinase C
