caption: Proteins co-translationally entering into the ER in non-native conformations
  engage ER-localized chaperones (e.g., BiP, GRP94, CNX, CRT) and folding factors
  (e.g., PDIs, PPIases) that facilitate their folding into their proper three-dimensional
  conformation (green box). These proteins are then packaged into vesicles for trafficking
  to downstream secretory environments such as the extracellular space (blue box).
  However, proteins unable to fold in the ER are directed towards degradation pathways
  such as ER-associated degradation where they are retrotranslocated from the ER to
  the cytosol and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (purple box). This
  partitioning of proteins between ER protein folding/trafficking or degradation pathways
  is referred to as ER quality control and functions to limit secretion of non-native
  protein conformations to downstream secretory environments. The primary impact of
  activating each UPR signaling arm on ER quality control is also depicted. PERK-dependent
  translation attenuation decreases the import of newly-synthesized proteins entering
  the ER, reducing ER protein folding load (top). Alternatively, IRE1/XBP1s and ATF6
  activation induces transcriptional remodeling of ER proteostasis pathways involved
  in protein import, folding, degradation and trafficking.
