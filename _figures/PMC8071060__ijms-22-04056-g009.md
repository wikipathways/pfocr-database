caption: Illustration of the mechanism of NaIO3-induced retinal injury and the effects
  of quercetin. NaIO3 induces mitochondrial dysfunction through the PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway and then Bax activates Cytochrome C, which causes apoptosis. Finally, IS-OS
  disruption occurs, which mimics AMD changes within the retinal tissue. Quercetin
  can activate Bcl-2 and inhibit apoptosis, thereby reducing the accumulation of oxidative
  damage.
