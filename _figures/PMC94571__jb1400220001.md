caption: Biosynthetic pathway for thiamine synthesis. Enzymes for the catalysis of
  each reaction are indicated above the relevant arrow. Enzymes that have not been
  demonstrated but are predicted to function at certain steps in thiamine biosynthesis
  are in parentheses. Putative [Fe-S]-containing enzymes are marked by asterisks.
  The dotted lines represent predicted reactions in the PurF-independent formation
  of phosphoribosyl amine (PRA). PRPP, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate; AIR, 5-aminoimidazole
  ribotide; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate.
