caption: Heterologous anthocyanin pathway for conversion of the flavan-3-ol substrate
  (+)-catechin to the O-methylated anthocyanin product peonidin 3-O-glucoside (P3G).
  Substrate (green) was supplied in media, while cofactors (orange) required for each
  enzymatic step were co-opted from endogenous E. coli metabolism
papertitle: CRISPRi-mediated metabolic engineering of E. coli for O-methylated anthocyanin
  production.
