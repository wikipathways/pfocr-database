caption: The signaling pathways involved in the effects of hydrogen sulfide on endoplasmic
  reticulum stress. H2S exerts neuroprotective effect by inhibiting 6-hydroxydopamine
  induced ERS through activating Akt-Hsp90 signaling pathway; H2S plays an antidepressant
  role through inhibiting ERS by activating BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway; H2S improves
  the survival rate of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells and IVDD by suppressing
  ERS-induced apoptosis through activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway; H2S alleviates
  VILI by inhibiting ERS through suppressing NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway. ERS, endoplasmic
  reticulum stress; Akt-Hsp90, protein kinase B-heat shock protein 90; BDNF-TrkB,
  brain derived neurotrophic factor-tyrosine kinase receptor type 2; PI3K/Akt, phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase/protein kinase B; NF-κB/MAPK, nuclear factor kappa-B/mitogen-activated
  protein kinases; VILI, ventilator-induced lung injury; IVDD, intervertebral disc
  degeneration.
