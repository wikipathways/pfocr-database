caption: 'Arginine metabolism, the partial reactions of the urea cycle, the L-arginine-NO
  pathway, a citrulline-NO cycle, and a branch point leading to the formation of guanidino
  compounds with special reference to conifers in eastern Canada. Enzymes: 1. ornithine
  carbamoyl transferase, 2. argininosuccinate synthetase, 3. argininosuccinate lyase,4.
  arginase, 5. nitric oxide synthase, 6. arginine deiminase, 7. arginine decarboxylase,
  8. numerous enzymes acting on arginine and responsible for the formation of guanidino
  compounds. Reactions 1 to 4 comprise the partial reactions of the urea cycle in
  plants. Not shown is the synthesis and turnover of proteins which alters the pool
  of available arginine and other protein amino acids. Reactions 2, 3, and 5 comprise
  the L-arginine-NO pathway and the citrulline-NO cycle, which are responsible for
  the stress-induced formation of NO from arginine and oxygen. 6. Arginine deiminase
  is not yet known in conifers but has been reported in other plants. Steps 7 and
  8 remove arginine from the urea and citrulline-NO cycles and divert N into the naturally
  occurring guanidino compounds some of which are inhibitors of respiration. During
  the onset of winter dormancy, arginine N, the guanidino compounds and proline N
  accumulate in the physiological fluids. Arginine is stored in reserve proteins to
  provide N for amino acid, amide, and renewed protein and nucleic acid synthesis
  in the spring. The conversion of proline to glutamine via glutamic acid now provides
  transferable hydrogen atoms making proline a readily available and highly-water
  soluble source of energy and reducing power for the photosynthetic assimilation
  of carbon dioxide.'
