caption: Functions of BAG families in mitochondrial homeostasis and PCD in mammals
  and plants. (A) Balance between anti-apoptotic and anti-survival Bcl-2 proteins
  determines the levels of the pro-death and pro-survival pathways. In addition, 6
  isoforms of BAG proteins are coded in mammals, among which BAG1 mainly participates
  in unfolded protein response [,]; BAG3 induces autophagy by competing with BAG1
  and binding with p62 as well microtubule regulator, or by directly binding with
  OMM protein to promote autophagy [,,,]; BAG4 and BAG5 both inhibit mitophagy by
  suppressing Parkin activity and pro-survival pathway [,]; BAG6 forms a ternary complex
  in the nucleus to promote pro-apoptotic activity via REAPER, and also participates
  in proteasome-mediated unfolded protein response []. (B) In plants, although no
  homologues of Bcl-2 proteins have been identified, seven isoforms of BAG proteins
  are found, which have diverse distributions. BAG1-3 has been implicated in binding
  to HSC70, mediating the unfolded protein response [,,,]; BAG4 has been shown to
  interact with the potassium channel KAT1 to participate in stomatal movement [];
  BAG5 is a mitochondrial-localized protein, whose activity is switched by Ca2+ levels
  via regulating its binding affinity towards CaM and Hsc70 []; BAG6 requires a proteolytic
  process in the vacuole for its activation, which participates in pathogen response
  and autophagy as well [,]; BAG7 is an ER-localized protein, which forms a complex
  with Hsc70 ortholog BIP protein and bZIP28 upon ER stress []. Additionally, after
  cleavage, BAG7 will undergo SUMOylating and tranlocation to interact with the WRKY29
  in the nucleus to regulate the expression of several anti-stress genes [].
