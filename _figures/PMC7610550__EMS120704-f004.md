caption: a | Failure to disengage the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) reflecting compulsive
  alcohol consumption. Rats are trained to seek alcohol under a seeking–taking chained
  schedule of reinforcement (similar to that in  but in which, during training, pressing
  the taking lever leads to presentation of ethanol from a drinking port). Alcohol
  reinforcement depends on dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the acquisition
  of seeking responses depends on DA in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) (both shaded
  blue in the striatal schematic on the left). The maintenance of well-established
  alcohol seeking loses its dependence on the DMS and becomes dependent on dopaminergic
  transmission in the anterior DLS (aDLS) (shaded dark blue in the striatal schematic
  on the right). b | A vulnerable subgroup of rats persists in seeking alcohol even
  when the seeking lever is probabilistically punished; that is, they are compulsive.
  Rats that seek alcohol compulsively are unable to disengage the aDLS; in these rats,
  seeking remains sensitive to DA receptor blockade in the aDLS. By contrast, rats
  that refrain from seeking lose their sensitivity to aDLS DA receptor blockade; that
  is, their seeking responses are no longer decreased by this manipulation as was
  the case earlier in training, when drug seeking was goal-directed. The development
  of compulsive alcohol seeking is therefore predicted both by engagement of the aDLS
  and by an inability to disengage it when compulsive, suggesting the maladaptive
  nature of compulsive alcohol-seeking habits. c | Optogenetic DA neuron self-stimulation
  (oDASS) results in the emergence of a bimodal distribution of compulsive seeking
  behaviour. Light stimulation leads to strong activation of the mesolimbic pathway
  and saturating DA transients in the NAc. Here, a seeking–taking chained schedule
  is illustrated during which medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) control of the NAc undergoes
  synaptic plasticity through DA modulation of glutamatergic afferents. d | During
  the test phase, pressing the seeking lever is punished, which results in some animals
  renouncing pressing the taking lever, whereas others persist in pressing it. Strengthened
  orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-to-DMS projections are the neural correlate of compulsive
  oDASS. DAT, dopamine transporter. Schematic in part b inspired by REF.
