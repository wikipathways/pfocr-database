  GL1 and EGL3 to inhibit trichome development. Some regulators affect trichome development
  by endoreduplication pathway. In addition, KAK and RPT2a inhibit the expression
  of GL3/EGL3 causing reduced trichome branching. In addition to regulating trichome
  initiation, GL3/EGL3 is also involved in trichome branching. TCP4 suppresses trichome
  branching by direct transcriptional activation of GIS (). (B) Key regulators are
  involved in cotton fiber development. MYB, bHLH, and HD-ZIP TFs are important regulators
  in cotton fiber development. GhMYB25 and GhMYB25-like have been identified as regulators
  of fiber initiation, and GhJAZ2 negatively regulates fiber initiation by interacting
  with GhMYB25-like. GhMML4 is known to regulate the fiber development by binding
  with GhWDR. GhHD1 regulates fiber initiation, while GhHOX3 regulates fiber elongation.
  GhHOX3 interacts with GhHD1, enhancing transcriptional activity of GhHOX3. In fiber
  elongation stage, GhMYB212 directly controls expression of sucrose transporter gene
  GhSWEET12 (). GhFP1 directly binds to GhDWF4 and GhCPD promoters to activate BR
  biosynthesis and signaling to regulate fiber elongation. GhMYB7 directly regulates
  fiber cellulose synthesis by binding to three different cis-elements in the GhCesA4,
  GhCesA7, and GhCesA8 promoters. GhTCP4 maintains the balance between cotton fiber
  cell elongation and cell wall synthesis by interacting with GhHOX3.
