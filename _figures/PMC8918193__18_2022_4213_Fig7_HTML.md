caption: The Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation induced by S100A16–HRD1–GSK3β/CK1α
  pathway in renal fibroblasts under IRI condition promotes the occurrence of AKI.
  Schematic diagram shows the increased expression of S100A16 in fibroblasts during
  renal ischemia and hypoxia. The expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 is elevated,
  and the members of β-catenin degradation complex, GSK3β and CK1α, are destroyed
  via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, thereby promoting the accumulation of β-catenin
  and its transfer to the cell nucleus. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway then inhibits the transcription of the downstream HGF that secreted by fibroblasts,
  and this procedure eventually leads to unrepairable kidney injury and renal dysfunction
