caption: Saccadic eye movements are supported by a distributed network of cortical
  andsubcortical regions. Saccades are initiated by direct signals sent from the parietal
  or frontal eye fields (PEFs or FEFs) to the superior colliculus (SC), which drives
  the oculomotor network (ON) in the brainstem. An indirect “gating” circuit arising
  from the FEFs and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) projects via the basal
  ganglia (caudate nucleus, globus pallidus [GP], and subthalamic nucleus [STN]) to
  the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). The SNr inhibits the SC, preventing
  saccade generation. To switch off this inhibition, when the FEFs and other frontal
  structures are activated before a saccade, the caudate nucleus is activated, which,
  in turn,hibits the SNr via an inhibitory pathway.
