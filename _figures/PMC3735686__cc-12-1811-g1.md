caption: 'Figure 1A. Potential roles of NER in DLBCL cells chemoresistance. (A) Doxorubicin
  induced DNA adducts: Repair of DNA adducts by transcription-coupled NER or by global
  genomic NER differs in their initial steps. Transcription-coupled NER involves Cockayne
  syndrome WD repeat protein A (CSA) and CSB, whereas in GG-NER recognition is dependent
  on XPC-HR23B and DDB proteins. XPA, replication protein A (RPA) and TFIIH are involved
  in both pathways. Thereafter, the steps are common, with excision of the damaged
  oligonucleotide by XPG and ERCC1-XPF, then resynthesis of the intact oligonucleotide
  and ligation are accomplished by DNA polymerase-δ or polymerase-ε and DNA ligase
  3 (LIG3). (B) Cyclophosphamide or doxorubicin induced ICLs: Progression of replication
  forks will be blocked by ICL. Stalled replication forks triggers surveillance mechanisms
  and the initial event, the incising of ICLs by serial or combined activities of
  XPF-ERCC1 and MUS81-EME1. These nucleases cut one strand of the damaged DNA, unhooking
  the ICL and leaving a gap that is bypassed by translesion synthesis polymerases
  (TLS). NER removes monoadducts and repairs the gap. The remaining DSB is repaired
  by homologous recombination repair.'
