caption: A schematic representation of the hypothetical model proposed by us outlining
  the role of the LKB1-AMPK signalling pathway in activating metabolic stress-mediated
  MMP-9 expression during cancer progression. The schematic shows that the LKB1-AMPK
  signalling pathway induces the expression of MMP-9 through an integrated network
  of signals. Metabolic stresses such as glucose starvation initiate LKB1-AMPK signalling
  via the generation of controlled levels of ROS, to eventually affect a host of different
  intracellular functions such as energy metabolism, autophagy, oxidative stress response,
  and cellular motility to establish metabolic adaptation and cancer progression.
