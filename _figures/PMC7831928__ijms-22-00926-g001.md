caption: Three distinct muscarinic signalling pathways leading to transient receptor
  potential (TRP)-like cationic channel opening in ileal myocytes (redrawn from Tanahashi
  et al. 2020 []). The M3/Gq/11/phospholipase C (PLC) pathway activates brief opening
  states of 70-pS and 120-pS cationic channels and concurrently evokes InsP3-induced
  Ca2+ release. Opening of the lower conductance channel is induced by relief from
  PIP2 inhibition following PLC-mediated hydrolysis, while the higher conductance
  channel is activated by PLC-generated diacylglycerol (DAG). The M2pathway transmits
  M2 signals via Gi/o proteins to the 70-pS channel, which shifts the gating state
  from the brief to a longer opening mode, and also inhibits adenylyl cyclase. The
  M2/M3pathway transmits M2 signals via Go protein, and M3 signals via Gq/11/PLC,
  to the 70-pS cationic channel, resulting in channel gating with a much longer open
  mode. This pathway is the major contributor to the generation of mIcat, but is inactive
  when either the M2 or M3 receptor is absent, or when either Go, Gq/11 or PLC is
  inactivated. In other words, the activity of this pathway is conditional, occurring
  only when both M2/Go and M3/Gq/11signalling pathways are activated. Studies of mAChR-KO
  mice [,] and TRPC-mutant mice [] indicate that these 70-pS and 120-pS cationic channel
  activities are mediated by TRPC4 and TRPC6, respectively. The M2/M3pathway, but
  not the M2 or M3pathway, involves a signalling step in which Ca2+ has a potentiating
  effect on TRPC channel activation, suggesting that the M3pathway may facilitate
  M2/M3pathway function through InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. Whether the M2/M3pathway
  has a significant role in stimulating InsP3/DAG formation or inhibiting cAMP accumulation
  is currently unclear. One study suggested that Go protein is not involved in adenylyl
  cyclase inhibition by M2 receptors of intestinal smooth muscle []. These three pathways
  may also converge on voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) to suppress Ca2+ influx
  via the same G-protein pathways mediating cationic channel activation (see Figure
  10B in Tanahashi et al., 2009 []).
