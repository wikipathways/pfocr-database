caption: The schematic model of miR-375-3p as a role in regulating functions in CRC
  cells. In CRC, miR-375-3p is frequently downregulated and directly targets YAP1
  and SP1 in CRC. Low expression of miR-375-3p leads to the release of YAP1 and SP1,
  resulting in chemoresistance and tumorigenesis. The mechanism of YAP1 mediated by
  miR-375-3p promoting drug resistance and proliferation is that release of YAP1 leads
  to YAP1 increase in CRC cells, thereby activates the downstream genes of Hippo-YAP1
  pathway, causing CTGF, Cyclin D1 and BIRC5 (Survivin) upregulate, which ultimately
  promotes CRC proliferation and drug resistance and inhibits apoptosis.
