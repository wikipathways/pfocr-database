caption: Schematic diagrams of DA dynamics and signaling in (A) Drosophila cuticle,
  (B) Drosophila brain, and (C) mammalian brain. (A) DA is synthesized in epidermal
  cells by enzymatic action of TH and Ddc upon molting or eclosion. Secreted DA becomes
  oxidized into melanin by phenoloxidases such as Laccase2. Yellow, a putative enzyme
  with unknown molecular function contributes to cuticle pigmentation. Enzymes such
  as Ebony, Black, Tan, and aaNAT are involved in metabolism of DA into NBAD and NADA.
  Melanin derived from DA (dopamine-melanin) is necessary for pigmentation, while
  NBAD and NADA contribute to the hardening of the cuticle. L-DOPA has also been proposed
  to be secreted and contributes to melanin (dopa-melanin) production. Little is known
  about how DA and its derivatives are secreted during this process. (B) DA is synthesized
  by TH and Ddc in presynaptic DArgic neurons and loaded into exocytic vesicles by
  VMAT. Exocytosis of DA through synaptic vesicles is considered to be the main mechanism
  of DA release. DA binds to DA receptors present on the postsynaptic neurons and
  triggers a signaling cascade. Excessive DA becomes metabolized into NADA by aaNAT.
  DAT mediates presynaptic DA reuptake. Ebony, Black, and Tan mediate the recycling
  of DA between glia cells and DArgic neurons. (C) Most genes involved in synthesis,
  transport, secretion, signal reception, and signal transduction are conserved between
  Drosophila and mammals. However, the major enzymes involved in DA metabolism are
  different between the two species. DA becomes metabolized into DOPAC or 3-MT and
  then HVA by MAO and COMT in mammalian brains. In addition, a DA recycling pathway
  between glia cells and neurons has not been identified in mammals.
