caption: Schematic representation of the LPS-TLR4 MAPK pathway stimulated by 1% ECVE
  treatment of LPS-matured MoDCs. (Based on data presented in Fig. ). Molecules that
  were found to be upregulated by 1% ECVE treatment are shown in red. Molecules that
  were unchanged or down-regulated by 1% ECVE treatment are shown in blue. Molecules
  that were not investigated in this study are shown in grey (color figure online)
