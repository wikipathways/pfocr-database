caption: Model depicting pathways involved in activation and inactivation of  nPKCη.
  nPKCη is activated by ADP via P2Y1 receptor  coupled to the Gqpathway. Furthermore,
  nPKCη is down-regulated  by activated integrin αIIbβ3 induced  outside-in signaling
  via PP1cγ phosphatase. Upon activation, nPKCη  positively regulates ADP-induced
  thromboxane generation without affecting  platelet aggregation and dense granule
  secretion.
