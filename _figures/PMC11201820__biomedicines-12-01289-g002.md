caption: Schematic of interaction between activated ECs and pericytes/vascular smooth-muscle
  cells (vSMCs) and their targeted inhibitors in red. PDGFB secreted from the EC binds
  to its receptor on the mural cell, causing activation of both P13K/AKT/mTOR and
  RAS/RAF/ERK pathways. Activated ECs have greater ANGPT2 expression, which in the
  presence of ANGPT1 will inhibit TIE2 receptors, causing enhanced vascular permeability.
  Altogether, there is decreased pericyte recruitment, enhanced MMP activation, and
  reduced vascular stability in this interaction
