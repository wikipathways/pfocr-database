caption: 'Representation of the top Canonical Pathways, Functional Annotations and
  Upstream Regulators detected upon analysis of target genes and their co-regulated
  genes. A reconstructed gene network was created using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  Software (IPA) on the basis of the target molecules, the molecules from the 10-top
  Canonical Pathways (see Table , Molecules) and the 10-top Upstream Regulators (see
  Table ). Solid lines in grey display the IPA-identified direct interactions between
  the molecules; dashed lines display indirect interactions. The multigene approach-based
  correlation analysis was used to find additional biological associations between
  the target genes. Statistically significant study-based associations (SPSS program,
  Additional file : Table S5) are displayed by dashed lines; red for correlation coefficient
  ≥ 0.6, p < 0.001; blue for correlation coefficient < 0.6, p < 0.001. The 10-top
  Canonical Pathways are listed according to the IPA-based ranking (from left to right).
  For a complete overview, also the most significant Functional Annotations & Diseases
  are shown (see Tables ,  and )'
