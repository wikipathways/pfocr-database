caption: 'Different roles of Hh signaling in cancer. Hh signaling in cancer may function
  in three manners: (1) a tumor driver; (2) a tumor promoter; and (3) a treatment
  resistant factor. In mice, activation of Hh signaling, via mutations of PTCH1 or
  SMO, drives development of basal cell carcinomas, medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcomas
  and GISTs, indicating that Hh signaling is the tumor drive for these four types
  of cancer. In the humans, gene mutations occur frequently in these tumor types.
  For small cell lung cancer, activation of Hh signaling is not sufficient to drive
  tumor formation. However, expression of mutant SMO, SmoM2, accelerates development
  of SCLC derived from Rbl/p53 deletion and Smo deletion reduces the tumor development.
  Thus, Hh signaling is a tumor promoter for SCLC. In addition, Hh signaling is activated
  in chemoresistant cancer cells in prostate and ovarian cancer, and inhibition of
  Hh signaling can sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy'
