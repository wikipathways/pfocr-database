caption: 'Basic preferences of DC metabolism. DCs originates from the common dendritic
  progenitors (CDPs) in the bone marrow (BM) that use mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) as a key metabolic energy source and have increased mitochondrial biogenesis.
  These DC-committed progenitors egress the BM and circulate in the bloodstream and
  tissues as naïve immature DCs that promoted mitochondrial OXPHOS and shifted with
  the metabolic preferences upon allergen uptake and toll-like receptor (TLR) activation.
  The early glycolytic surge in activated DCs is primarily mediated via AKT pathways
  that phosphorylate and activate hexokinase II (the rate-limiting enzyme of the glycolytic
  pathway), whereas a late-occurring event of increased glycolysis is maintained by
  activated mTORC-HIF1α and is NO-dependent. NO: nitric oxide; mTORC1: mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 1; HIF1α: hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha.'
