caption: The insulin receptor (IR) with its two subtypes IR-A and IR-B, the insulin
  growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) and the hybrid receptors (IGF-1R/IR-A and IGF-1R/IR-B).
  Structurally, IR and the IGF-1R have two extracellular α-subunits and two transmembrane
  β-subunits that are jointed to each other by disulfide bonds. Affinity, insulin
  binds with high affinity to IR-A or IR-B but has low affinity for IGF-1R, while
  insulin has no binding to the hybrid receptors. IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1R and to
  the hybrid receptor IGF-1R/IR-A or IGF-1R/IR-B. IGF-2 binds to IR-A, IGF-1R or to
  IGF-1R/IR-A hybrid receptor. Signaling, ligand binding to insulin receptor-A or
  to IGF-1 receptor mediates the mitogenic signaling pathway, while ligand binding
  to insulin receptor-B activates metabolic signaling. Binding to the hybrid receptors,
  leading to mitogenic or metabolic signaling, is determined by the IR isoform that
  formed the hybrid receptors. Reproduced by permission of the RMMJ .
