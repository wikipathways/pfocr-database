caption: 'The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)–3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein
  kinase-1 (PDK1) pathway. (A) Schematic representation of the pathway activated by
  PI3K through PDK1. Receptor-stimulated class I PI3Ks generate phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP3), which bind directly to the pleckstrin homology domain
  of PDK1, which in turn activates a plethora of downstream targets, a selection of
  which is shown, with different mechanisms (kinase-dependent or -independent; pleckstrin
  homology (PH) domain-dependent, etc.); (B) PDK1 structure. PDK1 contains an N-terminal
  kinase domain and a C-terminal PH domain. Inside the kinase domain, there are two
  important sites: the PDK1 interacting fragment (PIF)-pocket and the activation loop;
  the latter comprises serine 241, which is essential for PDK1 kinase activity and
  is constitutively phosphorylated.'
