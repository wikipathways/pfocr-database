caption: 'Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) condition is responsible for the activation
  of several signaling pathways which lead to harmful conditions for endothelium functionality.
  Firstly, HHcy creates a severe oxidative stress due to the formation of reactive
  intermediates (Hcy-thiolactone, Hcy persulfide etc.) which contribute to the imbalance
  of crucial REDOX enzyme systems (inhibition of SOD or activation of NADPH oxidases).
  Furthermore, HHcy and ROS activate NF-kB signaling pathway resulting in a marked
  inflammatory response through the production of cytokines (TNF-α, Il-1β); simultaneously
  pro-atherosclerotic mediators are overexpressed (ICAM-1, MCP-1, VCAM, E-selectin)
  contributing to the formation of atherosclerotic lesion. HHcy also activates MMPs
  increasing endothelium permeability which facilitates leukocyte infiltration in
  the underlying tissues. Furthermore, HHcy is responsible for a decrease in the bioavailability
  of fundamental vasodilator molecules, including NO and H2S promoting vascular hypertrophy
  and hypertension. In this context, H2S is able to beneficially act at different
  levels: H2S is a well-known ROS scavenger, thus exogenous administration of H2S-donor
  significantly reduces the oxidative stress, limiting the vascular inflammation.
  Furthermore, H2S directly reduces the Hcy plasma levels, thus preventing the activation
  of the downstream pathways. Finally, H2S limits the HHcy-induced hypertension and
  vascular hypertrophy.'
