caption: PLP1 mutations, associated phenotypes, and molecular mechanisms. (A) Different
  PLP1 mutations result in distinct molecular mechanisms underlying a wide variety
  of clinical phenotypes (Inoue, ). (B) Mutant PLP1 and associated cellular pathology.
  Misfolded mutant PLP1 (mutPLP1) accumulates in the ER and evokes ER stress, which
  triggers unfolded protein response to rescue the cells by reducing translation and
  increasing ER chaperones, or to turn on the proapoptotic pathway to induce cell
  death (Southwood et al., ; D'Antonio et al., ; Clayton and Popko, ). Disease-causing
  mutations in PLP1 is known to cause oligomer formation in the ER (Swanton et al.,
  ), binding to CNX and delayed clearance from the ER (Swanton et al., ), and impaired
  ER-Golgi trafficking (Numata et al., ).
