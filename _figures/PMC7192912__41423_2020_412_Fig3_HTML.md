caption: Downstream effects of chemoattractant-induced GPCR activation. Activation
  of chemoattractant receptors by their cognate ligands evokes a conformational change
  and the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine trisphosphate (GTP),
  followed by dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein into a Gαi subunit and
  a Gβγ dimer. The Gαi subunit mediates the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC), resulting
  in a reduction in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations.
  The Gβγ dimer initiates two parallel signaling cascades. Activation of phospholipase
  Cβ (PLCβ) enables the processing of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and the downstream
  activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Second, the activation of phosphoinositide
  3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) facilitates the conversion of PIP2 into phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) and the downstream activation of extracellular signal–regulated
  kinases (ERK) and phosphokinase B (Akt). Activation of Src kinases presumably occurs
  via an independent yet uncharacterized pathway (indicated by question marks). Phosphorylation
  of the receptor at the COOH-terminus enables binding of the β-arrestin adaptor proteins
  that uncouple the receptor during conventional G protein-dependent intracellular
  events
