caption: Model of ARV entry and signal pathways involved in this process. The incoming
  virion initially attached to the cell receptor is mediated by the outer capsid protein
  σC (, ) followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis. This study establishes the endocytic
  pathway used by ARV and the roles of various signaling molecules during ARV entry
  by examining the effects of selective inhibitors, DN mutants together with siRNAs
  targeting the caveolin-1 and dynamin-2. Left side depicts the major route of ARV
  entry, and the right side shows the signal pathways triggered by ARV. ARV induces
  Ras, p38 MAPK, Src, and Rac1 signaling during the early stage of the virus life
  cycle. Both p38 MAPK and Src were associated with caveolin-1 and dynamin-2 as demonstrated
  by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation assays. p38 MAPK and Src signaling pathways
  triggered by ARV are involved in mediating phosphorylation of caveolin-1 and dynamin-2
  expression. p38 MAPK and Src are upstream inducers of Rac1 facilitating cell syncytium
  formation.
