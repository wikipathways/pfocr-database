caption: 'TLR/NF-κB mediated inflammatory signaling and involvement of E3 and DUBs.
  Upon the activation of TLRs by their respective ligands or cytokines, TLR2/4 and
  TLR7/8/9 recruit adaptor proteins, such as TIRAP, MyD88, and RAKs, leading to the
  assembly of the MyD88 signaling complex. TRAF6 is subsequently engaged, catalyzing
  the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that serve as scaffolds for recruiting
  TAK1 and the IKK complex (IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ). The IKK complex phosphorylates
  IκB, marking it for ubiquitination and degradation. This process releases NF-κB,
  composed of p50 and p65 subunits, allowing its translocation into the nucleus to
  promote the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α.
  E3 ligases, represented by green rectangles, ubiquitinate specific components in
  the pathway, while DUBs, depicted as orange rectangles, remove ubiquitin modifications
  to regulate signaling. TLR: Toll-like receptor; NF-κB: Nuclear factor-kappa B; DUB:
  Deubiquitinating enzyme; IL-1β: Interleukin-1 beta; IL-6: Interleukin-6; TNF-α:
  Tumor necrosis factor-alpha; MYD88: Myeloid differentiation primary response 88;
  IKK: IκB kinase; IKKγ: Inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit gamma'
