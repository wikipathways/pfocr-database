caption: 'Synthesis and salvage of pyrimidines.In green, the central pyrimidine pathway
  for biosynthesis. The specific pathway for cytosine derivatives is in red. The dotted
  arrows mark catabolism. Additional routes are shown with dashed lines: purple for
  lipid synthesis and green for protein glycosylation. In blue we have shown the key
  enzyme which allows the recycling of pyrimidines via uracil. The parallel pathway
  for cytosine has not been discovered in any organism to date. [Correction statement
