caption: 'Known heterologous reactions leading to the production of liquiritigenin
  (white circular node). Squares represent reactions and circular nodes represent
  molecules. Dark green nodes are present in the host organism, E. coli K-12, light
  green can be produced via enzyme catalyzed reactions and red ones cannot. Liquiritigenin,
  a highly selective estrogen receptor β agonist, is represented by the white node
  v1. Side products not consumed in this pathway are not represented for simplicity.
  Four pathways lead from the host compounds to the production of the target molecule,
  one for instance is the pathway involving reactions R1, R2, R4, R7. Legend: v1:
  liquiritigenin, v2: ATP, v3: NADH, v4: NADPH, v5: NADP+, v6: oxygen, v7: CoA, v8:
  acetate, v9: H+, v10: L-tyrosine, v11: malonyl-CoA, v12: 4-hydroxybenzoate, v13:
  trans-cinnamate, v14: p-coumaroyl-CoA, v15: cinnamoyl-CoA, v16: 4-coumarate, v17
  isoliquiritigenin, v18: cinnamaldehyde, v19: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate, v20: 4-hydroxycinnamyl
  aldehyde.'
