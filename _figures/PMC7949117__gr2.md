caption: ACPs play a central role in type II polyketide biosynthesis. The ACP is first
  activated by the PPTase-catalyzed attachment of the Ppant arm, which holds the polyketide
  intermediate (see A for structure of the Ppant arm). The Ppant arm is then acylated
  with malonyl-CoA by either interaction with MAT or self-malonylation. The subsequent
  elongation cycle adds two carbon units at a time to the growing β-keto chain. The
  growing chain is transferred to the KSCLF via a transacylation reaction, which makes
  the ACP available to participate in additional rounds of chain elongation. The general
  steps for the biosynthesis of the prototypical type II polyketide actinorhodin are
  outlined in this figure as an example. Type II PKSs tend to build C14-C30 β-keto
  chains (), with the actinorhodin pathway involving a C16 chain. In actinorhodin
  biosynthesis, final modifications include the reduction of the C9 carbonyl catalyzed
  by the ketoreductase (KR) enzyme and ring closures catalyzed by aromatase (ARO)
  and cyclase/re (CYC), before release by the thioesterase (TE). ACP, acyl carrier
  protein; CoA, coenzyme A; KSCLF, ketosynthase chain length factor; PKS, polyketide
  synthase; Ppant, phosphopantetheine.
