caption: Schematic of lung-centric inflammation and immunothrombosis in response to
  SARS-CoV-2 infection. Resident alveolar macrophages mount an inflammatory response
  to infection of the lungs by SARS-CoV-2. Macrophages detect viral material e.g.,
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs activate the NFκB pathway
  which generates pro-IL-1β and components of the inflammasome. Assembly and functional
  activation of the inflammasome results in caspase-mediated cleavage of pro-IL-1β
  to the mature IL-1β. Caspase cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) allows it to enter
  the plasma membrane and oligomerize, forming pores. IL-1β as well as other inflammatory
  mediators, such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) exit the macrophage
  through the GSDMD pores. The inflammatory response is amplified by feed-forward
  mechanisms and recruitment of additional leukocytes, e.g., neutrophils. Activated
  neutrophils can extrude neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a meshwork of decondensed
  DNA decorated with granule-derived proteases and antimicrobials. Inflammasome-derived
  caspase as well as granule-derived elastase activate GSDMD to form the pores for
  NET release. NETs formed in the alveolar space can induce lung injury while NETs
  generated within blood vessels sequester platelets and coagulation factors to promote
  thrombogenesis. Modified from ().
