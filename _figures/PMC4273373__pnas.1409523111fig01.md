caption: Sensor selector design and pathway optimization through toggled selection.
  (A) Sensor selector genetic architecture. (B) Methods for tuning sensor selectors
  to reduce escape rate and shift operational range. Escape rate is reduced by (i)
  adding a degradation tag, (ii) mutating the RBS of the selector, (iii) including
  multiple orthogonal selectors, or (iv) including an additional copy of the sensor.
  Activating an exporter shifts the sensor selector operational range. (C) Toggled
  selection protocol for biosynthetic pathway optimization through multiple rounds
  of evolution. Negative selection eliminates cheaters; subsequent positive selection
  identifies higher-producing clones from a diverse library.
