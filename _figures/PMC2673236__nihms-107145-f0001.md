caption: Schematic illustration of one-carbon metabolism pathway. Key genes involved
  in one-carbon metabolism include methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), thymidylate
  synthase (TYMS), methionine synthase (MTR), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR),
  cytosol serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR),
  and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). Reduced folate carrier (RFC1)
  and human folate receptor (hFR) transport the dietary polyglutamyl folate (the predominant
  form of folate in diet) in intestinal absorption. B vitamins are co-factors of one-carbon
  enzymes as shown. Chemotherapy drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) targets TYMS and methotrexate
  targets DHFR to block DNA synthesis. Hcy, homocysteine; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine;
  SAH, adenosylhomocysteine; THF, tetrahydrofolate; DHF, dihydrofolate; dUMP, deoxyuridine
  monophosphate; dUTP, deoxythymidine monophosphate.
