caption: 'Figure 3. Gero-oncometabolite mitochondrial retrograde-like signaling: A
  new candidate signaling pathway linking aging with cancer. Mitochondrial retrograde
  signaling is a pathway of communication from mitochondria to the nucleus under normal
  and pathophysiological conditions. It involves multiple factors that sense and transmit
  mitochondrial signals to effect changes in nuclear gene expression; these changes
  lead to a reconfiguration of metabolism to accommodate cells to defects in mitochondria.
  Although during aging there is a specific loss of mitochondrial, but not nuclear,
  encoded OXPHOS subunits, the pseudohypoxic state that disrupts the PGC1-α/β-independent
  nuclear–mitochondrial communication can contributes not only to the decline in mitochondrial
  function with age, but can also mediate an undesirable trade-off between Warburg
  reprogramming and oncometabolites production in normal cells. Glutamine-derived
  α-ketoglutarate is reductively carboxylated by the NADPH-linked mitochondrial IDH2
  to form isocitrate, which can then be isomerized to citrate. However, the increased
  IDH2-dependent carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate in hypoxia has
  been associated with a concomitant increased synthesis of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG)
  in cells with wild-type IDH1 and IDH2. Moreover, reprogramming of metabolism by
  HIF1α in the absence of hypoxia is sufficient to induce reductive activity on α-ketoglutarate
  that is uncoupled from carboxylation, thus producing the oncometabolite 2HG. This
  hypothetical scenario offers a plausible connection between gerometabolites-induced
  pseudohypoxia and oncometabolites-induced block in differentiation to promote tumorigenesis,
  likely through epigenetic mechanisms.'
