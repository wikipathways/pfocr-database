caption: TLR11 and TLR12 are the first molecules to recognize TgPRF. TLR7 and TLR9
  are receptors for detecting T. gondii RNA and genomic DNA, respectively. UNC93B1
  binds to endolysosomal TLRs in the endoplasmic reticulum, and stimulation of TLRs
  activates MyD88-dependent signaling. The MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, which
  depends on the activation of IRF8, induces IL-12 production in DCs. TLR2, TLR4,
  and TLR9 play central roles in the production of IFN-γ. However, the production
  of IL-12 is induced by TLR11 and TLR12. Activated IL-2 induces the differentiation
  of CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells expressing T-bet, which is involved in IFN-γ production.
  In addition, the production of IL-2 and IL-21 by CD4+ T cells helps maintain memory
