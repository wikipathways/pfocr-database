caption: Signaling networks that regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  in colorectal cancer (CRC). The signaling pathways can induce EMT by the activation
  of the transcription factors (TFs) SNAI1/2, ZEB1/2, TWIST, and SLUG. Transforming
  growth factor β (TGF-β) induces EMT by phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which
  localize to the nucleus with Smad4 to activate EMT TF. Wnt inhibits glycogen synthase
  kinase-3 (GSK3) to stabilize β-catenin. When β-catenin is active, it translocates
  to the nucleus to directly activate ZEB1 and SNAI1. Several growth factors that
  act through tyrosine kinase receptors, such as platelet-derived growth factor growth
  factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
  promote EMT through the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade,
  the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) axis, and nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB). Both pathways inhibit GSK3 as well as integrin activation, thus
  cooperating with Wnt signaling. The urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) bonds
  to its specific cellular receptor (uPAR) to concentrate proteolytic activity at
  the cell surface, with this being important for extracellular matrix remodeling.
  Finally, the E-cadherin present on cell surface binds to cadherins on adjacent cells,
  whereas its intracellular region contains binding sites to interact with catenins
  and other regulatory proteins. When the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex is disrupted,
  it not only affects epithelial integrity but also the Wnt-signaling pathway. Hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1 (HIF-1) is activated by intracellular ROS and modulates EMT TF activity.
