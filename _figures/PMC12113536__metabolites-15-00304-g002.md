caption: A summary of the role of SMARCB1 deficiency as a driver of the hallmarks
  of cancer in RTs. SMARCB1 loss promotes sustained proliferative signalling via upregulation
  of Myc, EGFR, and Aurora kinase A and facilitates evasion of growth suppressors
  through Rb hyperphosphorylation. Deregulated cellular energetics are marked by enhanced
  nucleotide synthesis and mevalonate pathway activation. It is important to note
  that upregulation of nucleotide synthesis has yet to be confirmed as a causal outcome
  of SMARCB1 deficiency. Tumour-promoting inflammation involves expression of CXCL10,
  PRF1, and CLEC9A, while immune evasion may be mediated through elevated IL-10, PD-L1,
  and HAVCR2. Non-mutational epigenetic reprogramming further supports oncogenesis
  and is driven by increased EZH2/PRC2 activity and histone methylation. Up arrows
  in figure indicate increased activity of protein or pathway. Figure created with
