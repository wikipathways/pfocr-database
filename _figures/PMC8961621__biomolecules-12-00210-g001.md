caption: 'Core components of the PKA pathway. In its inactive form, PKA exists as
  a tetramer of two regulatory subunits (Bcy1) and two catalytic subunits (Tpk1, Tpk2
  or Tpk3). Binding of cAMP to Bcy1 leads to dissociation of the complex and activation
  of the catalytic subunits. Two main routes of activation of adenylate cyclase Cyr1
  exist: via the G protein-coupled receptor Gpr1 and its G protein alpha subunit Gpa2
  and via the small GTPases Ras1/2.'
