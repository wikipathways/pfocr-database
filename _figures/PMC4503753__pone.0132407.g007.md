caption: The EpCAM aptamer siRNA chimeric construct (EpApt-siEp) binds to the EpCAM
  receptor and gets internalized (1) and released in the cytoplasm where gets into
  Ago complex with dicer enzyme (2) to generate siRNA. The siRNA loaded into RISC
  complex (3) binds to the EpCAM mRNA (4) and leads to mRNA degradation (5). The EpCAM
  proteolysis leads to release of EpICD (EpCAM intracellular domain), shedding of
  EpEx (EpCAM extracellular domain) from EpTM (EpCAM transmembrane domain) (6) and
  the EpICD complexes with Wnt signaling mediators, β-catenin, FHL2 and TCF (7) to
  translocate to nucleus and regulate the gene transcription of pluripotency markers,
  SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, EpCAM, CD133, CD44 and aids in proliferation (8) upon EpCAM silencing
  these markers are downregulated (9) and cell proliferation is hampered(10). The
  EpCAM silencing leads to apoptotic cell death by downregulation of pluripotency,
  CSC markers, survivin, IAPs, Bcl2, p27, HSP70, catalase and claspin, by affecting
  intrinsic apoptotic pathway (11) leading to cell death(12). Overall, the knockdown
  of EpCAM using EpApt-siEp chimera leads to the inhibition of the nuclear signaling
  mediated by the EpICD, thereby decreases the cancer stem cell marker expression
  and induces apoptosis that brings down the tumorigenicity.
