caption: 'The experimental design of this study. The SD female rats divided into two
  groups: The VCD-treated group and Control group. The two group rats were sacrificed
  at the same time every day (D1-D15) for 15 consecutive days. After estrous cycle
  testing, the POF model rats also were collected. Each rat was detected with serum
  hormone levels (E2, LH, FSH, and AMH) and screened for early differential expression
  of target miRNAs from those significantly differentially expressed on POF model
  rats (miRNA-190a-5p, miRNA-98-5p, miRNA-29a-3p, miRNA-144-5p, miRNA-27b-3p, and
  miRNA-151-5p). Subsequently, ovarian tissues from rats on the 6th (D6), 10th (D10),
  15th (D15), and 45th (D45) of VCD injection were selected to detect the expression
  levels of target genes of target miRNAs and mRNAs and proteins on the primordial
  follicle hyperactivation signaling pathway.'
