caption: Exosome-mediated communication between immune cells and keratinocytes contributes
  to the development of psoriasis. Neutrophil-derived exosomes containing olfactomedin
  4 (OLFM4) increase the expression of IL-1β, IL-36G, IL-18, TNF-α and CCLs in keratinocytes
  by activating MAPK and NF-κB pathways. Macrophage-derived exosomes enhance the asymmetric
  division of basal stem cells by activating the Par3/mInsc/LGN signaling pathway.
  Mast cell exosomes transfer phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to CD1a-reactive T cells from
  psoriatic patients, inducing the production of IL-17A and IL-22. T cell-derived
  exosomes stimulate mast cells to degranulate and release IL-24, which in turn activates
  keratinocytes. Keratinocyte-derived exosomes containing miR-381-3p promote T cell
  differentiation into Th1/Th17 cells under psoriatic conditions. These exosomes also
  increase the release of NETs and production of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α in neutrophils
  by activating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways and promoting the proliferation and
  M1 polarization of macrophages by delivering miR-4505 and leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein
  1 (LRG1). (Upward, vertical and red arrows denote increasing)
