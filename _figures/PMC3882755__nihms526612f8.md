caption: During vascular homeostasis, Notch2 is not present in arterial VSMC, while
  Notch3 is primarily expressed. Following vascular injury or the progression of disease,
  cytokine release and changes in the microenvironment lead to the induction of Skp2,
  which suppresses p27kip1. These factors contribute to loss of the contractile phenotype
  and VSMC proliferation. Notch2 is induced during this remodeling process in the
  VSMC. Unlike Notch1 and Notch3, Notch2 expression co-localized with p27kip1 to the
  non-proliferative medial VSMC. Our in vitro data supports a mechanism whereby Jag-1
  activation of Notch2 inhibits Skp2, resulting in reduced ubiquitination and decreased
  turnover of p27kip1 in VSMC. As a result of increased stability, total p27kip1 and
  p-p27 S10 accumulate in the cell, inhibiting cyclinE/CDK2 functions. We hypothesize
  that reduced expression of cyclinE/CDK2 is a result of increased p27kip1 levels
  and accounts for dramatically decreased levels of p-p27kip1 T187. This pathway is
  required for Jag-1 inhibition of VSMC proliferation in vitro. Notch2 function is
  required for the full VSMC maturation since suppression of either Notch2 or Notch3
  suppresses their differentiated, contractile phenotype.
