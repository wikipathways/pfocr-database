caption: Apical transport during influenza A virus infection. The viral infection
  cycle starts with a recognition of a glycan receptor (e.g., sialylated glycan) on
  the cellular membrane by viral HA. The virus enters the cell through endocytosis
  (); in the acidic environment in the endosome, protons traverse the viral membrane
  through M2, facilitating viral fusion and release of the viral genome into the cellular
  cytoplasm. Then the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) are transported into the nucleus
  followed by transcription and replication. Next vRNPs are cotrafficked with Rab
  proteins and use Rab11-dependent vesicular and microtubule-based transport pathway
  to be transported from the nucleus to the plasma membrane through the pericentriolar
  recycling endosome. The membrane proteins HA, NA, and M2 proteins traffic from the
  Golgi to the apical membrane. Finally, the viral particle buds and is released by
  the action of NA to the extracellular media.
