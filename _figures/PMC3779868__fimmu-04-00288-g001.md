caption: Phosphoinositide signaling and its regulation by phosphatases. PI3K converts
  PI(4,5)P2 to a key secondary messenger PI(3,4,5)P3. Phosphatases like PTEN and SHIP1/2
  regulate cellular levels of PI(3,4,5)P3 by hydrolyzing it to PI(4,5)P2 and PI (3,4)P2
  respectively. PLCγ converts PI(4,5)P2 to IP3 and DAG. IP3 a soluble inositol phosphate
  is required for Ca2+ mobilization while DAG can activate the Ras-Raf-ERK1/2 pathway.
  IP3 3-Kinases convert IP3 to IP4, another important soluble inositol poly-phosphate
  that either positively or negatively regulates the binding of PI(3,4,5)P3 to PH-domain
  containing proteins. The SHIP1/2 product PI(3,4)P2 is hydrolyzed by INPP4A/B into
  PI(3)P by removal of the phosphate at the 4-position of the inositol ring. PI(3,4,5)P3
  and/or PI(3,4)P2 enable recruitment to the plasma membrane of several PH-domain
  containing proteins including PDK1, AKT, BTK, ITK, and thus regulate pivotal cellular
  processes including activation, proliferation, and survival. PH-domain containing
  adaptor proteins (GABs, SKAPs, Bam32, and TAPP) can also bind to phosphoinositides
  and regulate cell signaling (indicated as green boxes). AKT, Protein Kinase B; PDK1,
  phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, PLCγ phospholipase Cγ; ITK, IL-2-inducible
  T cell kinase) and BTK, Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase.
