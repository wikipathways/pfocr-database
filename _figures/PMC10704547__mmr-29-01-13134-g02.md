caption: Effects of AhR ligands on different types of breast cancer cells. (A) TCDD,
  as a typical exogenous AhR ligand, affects the proliferation, apoptosis and migration/invasion
  via different pathways in different types of breast cancer cells. It promotes proliferation
  and inhibits migration/invasion in ER-positive cells, inhibits proliferation, apoptosis
  and migration/invasion in HER-2-positive cells, and inhibits apoptosis and promotes
  or inhibits proliferation and migration/invasion in TNBC cells. (B) Other PAHs and
  HAHs, endogenous and synthetic and pharmaceutical AhR ligands mainly exhibit tumor-suppressive
  characteristics. However, PAHs and HAHs not only promote the proliferation of ER-positive
  and HER-2-positive cells, but also promote the migration/invasion of TNBC and ER-positive
  cells. Endogenous ligands not only inhibit the proliferation of TNBC and ER-positive
  cells, but also inhibit the migration/invasion of TNBC and HER-2-positive cells.
  Moreover, synthetic and pharmaceutical ligands not only inhibit the proliferation
  and promote apoptosis of the different types of breast cancer cells, but also inhibit
  the migration/invasion of TNBC cells. (a) Effects of PAHs and HAHs on different
