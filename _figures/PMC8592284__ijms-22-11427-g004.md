caption: Specific amino acids regulate autophagy by inhibiting mTORC1 and increasing
  LC3-II expression. (The red arrow connects the left to right side of the diagram,
  representing the transition from mechanism to function; plus signs are used to present
  that amino acids promote autophagy.) (A) Arginine deficiency has been shown to upregulate
  autophagy via diverse pathways. (B) Leucine deficiency fails to induce autophagy
  in melanoma due to an overactivated RAS-MEK pathway. Leucine deficiency and its
  metabolite acetyl-CoA induce autophagy through mTORC1 in other cell types such as
  293T cells and MEFs. (C) Glutamine-metabolizing enzymes GLS, GDH, and GS, which
  are enhanced by FOXO3 in Ba/F3 cells, are involved in glutamine synthesis and glutaminolysis.
  Glutaminolysis produces ammonia and α-ketoglutarate, ammonia promotes mTORC1-independent
  autophagy, and α-ketoglutarate inhibits mTORC1-dependent autophagy. Glutamine starvation
  upregulates SLC7A5 expression, increases intracellular uptake of leucine, activates
  mTORC1, and inhibits autophagy. (D) Knocking out MsrA increased p62-positive inclusion
  bodies and upregulated LC3-II expression in VSMC. SAM, synthesized from methionine,
  methylates PP2A to dephosphorylate the substrate Npr2p, thereby releasing the inhibition
  of mTORC1 by Npr2p, which suppresses NNS-autophagy.
