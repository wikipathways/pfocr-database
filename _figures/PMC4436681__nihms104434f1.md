caption: Illustration of the deformation-induced ATP release pathway, highlighting
  the importance of glucose metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway. Activation
  of the G-protein (Gs) coupled receptor (GPCR) by mechanical deformation leads to
  the conversion of ATP to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by adenylyl cyclase
  (AC), which results in phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
  (CFTR) by protein kinase A (PKA), upon which, stimulates ATP release from the cell.
  Here, the pentose phosphate pathway includes the conversion of glucose to glucose
  6-phosphate (G6P) via hexokinase (HK), leading to the production of NADPH as glucose
  6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) produces 6-phosphogluconolactone (6GP). NADPH is
  essential in the production of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) from its disulfide
  form (GS-SG) by way of glutathione reductase (GSHR). GSH protects spectrin from
  oxidation and maintains the deformability of the cellular membrane, which is necessary
  for mechanical deformation-induced ATP release.
