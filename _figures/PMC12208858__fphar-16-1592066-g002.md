caption: 'Intravascular release and mechanism of pH-responsive TwHF nanocarrier. Folate-conjugated
  F127, pH-sensitive peptides, and TwHF were co-assembled to construct a pH-responsive
  nanocarrier for the drug TwHF. In the in vivo environment, the TwHF nanoparticles
  are transported to inflammatory areas via blood vessels, where they disassemble
  due to the reduced pH at these sites. This process facilitates the release of TPL,
  allowing it to exert its anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities at the targeted
  locations. At inflammatory sites, TwHF exhibits various mechanisms of action on
  different cell types: it is absorbed by endothelial cells, inhibiting the release
  of adhesion factors VCAM-1 and ICAM-2 through the inhibition of the IKK signaling
  pathway, thereby reducing the adhesion of these factors to endothelial cells. In
  Th17 cells, it suppresses the transcription and translation of the pro-inflammatory
  factors IL-17 and the chemokine MMP-9 by inhibiting the SMADs and RORγT signaling
  pathways. In macrophages, TwHF promotes the differentiation of macrophages into
  M1 macrophages by inhibiting the JAK, STAT1, MyD88, and NF-kB signaling pathways.
  Concurrently, it enhances the activation of the JAK, STAT3, and STAT6 signaling
  pathways through the promotion of PPAR-γ signaling, further facilitating the differentiation
  of macrophages into M2 macrophages. In inflammatory cells, TwHF can inhibit the
  synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteins by targeting IKKs, NF-kB (P65),
  and TAK1 signaling pathways, and by interfering with the translation program of
  RNA polymerase II'
