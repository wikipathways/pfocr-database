caption: G1 cell cycle checkpoints. Progression through G1 of the cell cycle is shown
  as having 3 major obstacles for which specific genetic alterations need to occur
  during tumorigenesis. After completing mitosis, the first obstacle is passing R
  where cells avoid quiescence. Passage of this site is dependent on growth factor
  instructions or, in the case of a cancer, a mutation to Ras or another component
  of the Ras pathway that leads to cyclin D expression. After passing R, the next
  obstacle involves the activation of signals that indicate sufficient nutrients for
  the cell to double in mass. We refer to this site as the “cell growth” checkpoint.
  A focal point of this checkpoint is mTOR, which suppresses TGF-β signaling, which
  stimulates the expression of p27Kip1, which suppresses cyclin E–CDK2.
