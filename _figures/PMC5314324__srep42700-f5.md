caption: Autophosphorylated active DNA-PKcs phosphorylates Akt1 at S473 at the DNA
  damage site. Activated Akt1 is now able to stabilize nearby D-NHEJ complexes via
  phosphorylation of UBE2S at its T152 leading to an enhanced association of UBE2S
  with Ku70 and the repair complex. At a later stage of the repair Akt1 might introduce
  the dissociation of the D-NHEJ complex by phosphorylation of XLF at its phosphorylation
  site T181. The phosphorylation of XLF triggers the dissociation of XLF from the
  DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 complex as a final step of the DSB repair. Furthermore, Akt1
  functions as a switch upon genotoxic stress between cell cycle arrest/survival or
  apoptosis.
