caption: Working model for regulation of elicited cell death in soybean roots. The
  intact WGE from P. sojae is of very high molecular mass. Responses to this elicitor
  require an endo-β-1,3-glucanse (PR-2) for the release of elicitor active fragments
  (). While this enzyme is constitutively expressed at relatively low levels, elicitor
  fragments strongly activate further transcription of PR-2 (), amplifying the signaling
  pathway. Responses to WGE include the induced gene expression of CHR and IFS (M.Y.
  Graham, unpublished data), daidzein and glyceollin accumulation (), and cell death.
  Silencing of PR-2 or either IFS or CHR leads to suppression of the induction of
  daidzein and glyceollin and suppression of cell death in both WGE-treated tissues
  and incompatible infected tissues. Cell death is hypothesized to require both the
  accumulation of 5-deoxyisoflavonoids and generation of AOS, which may oxidize the
  isoflavonoids (e.g. to free radicals) that cause cell death. Although WGE is sufficient
  to induce cell death in uninfected tissues of all cultivars, in compatible infections
  we postulate that a virulence factor(s) from P. sojae suppresses either elicitor
  release (e.g. ) and/or the cell death process. We further hypothesize that interactions
  of Avr-1 gene products with their respective Rps 1 gene products, in turn, may act
  to counteract this suppression of cell death (not shown in the model).
