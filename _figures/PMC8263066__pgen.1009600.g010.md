caption: (A) Infection by D. coniospora activates a pathway involving SNF-12 and STA-2.
  The translocation of STA-2 into the nucleus leads to an increase in the expression
  of nlp and cnc genes. An uncharacterized parallel pathway, potentially linked to
  surveillance of translation, activates ifas-1, which is negatively regulated by
  STA-2. (B) DcEntA, via its interaction with host ARF GTPases and other protein partners
  (brown circle), through ADP ribosylation, potentially interferes with the normal
  innate immune response at multiple levels. It alters SNF-12 localization, blocks
  STA-2 nuclear translocation and AMP gene expression. It inhibits translation, leading
  to an increase in ifas-1 expression, accentuated by the loss of the repressive function
  of STA-2. DcEntA interferes with endocytosis, disrupts the cytoskeleton and causes
  increased cuticle fragility, potentially further increasing susceptibility to infection.
  (C) When DcEntB is expressed in hyp7, it localises to the nucleolus. Expression
  of DcEntB drives STA-2 into the nucleus, leading to an increase in nlp and cnc gene
  expression and suppressing ifas-1 expression. DcEntB alters the shape and size of
  the epidermal nucleoli. This provokes a surveillance mechanism leading to the expression
  of nlp but not cnc genes.
