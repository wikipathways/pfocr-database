caption: Autophagy involves the formation of double-membrane vesicles from phagophores,
  i.e., autophagosomes, which engulf cytoplasmic contents and organelles. Fusion of
  the autophagosome with a lysosome forms an autolysosome that results in the degradation
  of its contents, nutrient recycling and autophagic cell survival. However, prolonged
  autophagy in certain settings can also lead to non-apoptotic autophagic cell death.
  Two core regulators of autophagy include the PERK/eIF2α pathway that is activated
  by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway. Iron chelators
  have been demonstrated to modulate both these pathways and subsequent autophagic
  processes, and also enhance expression of LC3-II, which is recruited to autophagosomal
  membranes during induction of autophagy (see text for more details). Molecules negatively
  regulated by iron chelators are indicated by red boxes, and those positively regulated
  are indicated by green boxes.
