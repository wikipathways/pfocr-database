caption: Genomic and structural organization of Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec showing the position
  of human mutation. (A) The primary structure of human Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec is shown
  in a cloverleaf model, with the location of C65G TRU-TCA1–1 mutation identified
  in the patient indicated (circled red). The acceptor stem constitutes paired 5′
  and 3′ terminal bases, with the D arm, the anticodon arm, the variable arm, and
  the TψC arm depicted. Mammalian Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec undergoes post-transcriptional
  modification at positions 34 (mcm5U or mcm5Um), 37 (i6A), 55 (ψ), and 58 (m1A).
  (B) Schematic of the TRU-TCA1-1 gene showing the coding region (black boxes) and
  regulatory elements (gray boxes) (), with the location of C65G mutation identified
  in the patient. (C) The two Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec isoforms, containing either mcm5U or
  mcm5Um modifications of the uracil at position 34 in the anticodon arm, differ from
  each other by a single methyl group on the 2′-O-ribosyl moiety. This reaction is
  catalyzed by an unknown methylase, and abundance of the mcm5Um isoform increases
  with selenium concentration (). (D) Crystal structure showing catalytic and non-catalytic
  dimers of the SEPSECS tetramer bound to tRNA[Ser]Sec (), with the position of the
  C65 nucleotide indicated. Other nucleotides in tRNA[Ser]Sec (cyan) and amino acids
  in SEPSECS (yellow) involved in RNA–protein interaction are also highlighted, as
  are the nucleotides (red) toward the position of Sec and the pyridoxal-5-phosphate
  substrate (green) within the catalytic domain. (E) A close-up of the structure around
  C65, showing H-bonds (dashed green lines) formed between C64 and the C64–C65 backbone
  with residues (E37 and K38) situated in helix 1 (H1) of the non-catalytic dimer
  of SEPSECS. mcm5U, 5-methoxycarbonyl-methyluridine; mcm5Um, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2′-O-methyluridine.
