caption: 'Pathways correcting DNA polymerase errors. During DNA synthesis, rare polymerase
  errors [base•base mispairs (left) or primer•template slippage (right)] impede primer
  extension and thus trigger transfer of the growing DNA strand from the polymerase
  active site POL) to the 3′→5′ exonuclease active site (EXO) where the errant bases
  are excised by proofreading. Errors that escape 3′→5′ exonucleolytic proofreading
  are corrected, at least in part, by two partially redundant pathways of the MMR
  system. Studies in yeast indicate that Pol proofreading and MMR act in series along
  a common pathway [, ]. MutSα and MutSβ have overlapping substrate specificities,
  and MutSα also recognizes DNA damage and signals apoptosis. [Note: mammalian Pms2
  (shown here) is equivalent to yeast Pms1.]'
