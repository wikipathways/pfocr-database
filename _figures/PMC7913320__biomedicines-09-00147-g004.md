caption: EC glucose and glycogen metabolism in hypoxia and nutrient-deprivation conditions.
  Under hypoxia and nutrient-deprivation conditions, cellular energy levels are decreased
  and autophagy is upregulated by the AMPK–mTORC1 pathway. The autophagy–lysosomal
  pathway promotes the recycling of nutrients, including glucose, for cell survival.
  In response to environmental changes, ECs use glycogen as a backup energy source.
  Upon nutrient deprivation, TFEB translocates to the cell nucleus, where it activates
  target genes involved in lysosomal function and autophagy. Upregulated autophagy/lysosomal
  activity supports ECs to resist the detrimental effects of hypoxia and nutrient
  deprivation. Red color represents the key metabolic genes.
