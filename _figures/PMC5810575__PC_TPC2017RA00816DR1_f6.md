caption: Proposed Phytosterol and BR Biosynthetic Pathway for S. viridis Shows Where
  Genes Encoding Enzymes in the Pathway Were Differentially Expressed in bsl1-1 Mutant
  Inflorescences and Where Changes in Metabolites Were Observed.BR biosynthesis is
  highlighted in gray. Subpathways highlighted in purple (from light to dark/left
  to right) represent the parallel early and late C-6 oxidation pathways and the early
  C-22 oxidation pathway for BR biosynthesis, respectively. Intermediates that were
  quantified in wild-type and bsl1-1 mutants are boxed by a dotted line. Those that
  were significantly decreased in the mutant are boxed in red. Steps catalyzed by
  enzymes encoded by genes that were differentially expressed in the RNA-seq analyses
  are boxed by dashed lines (purple = Bsl1; turquoise = SvROT3; dark blue = SvBR6OX1;
  burnt orange = SvBAS1-L2). Each of these DE genes (asterisks) is associated with
  two or more metabolic steps, each noted by a blue (upregulated in the mutant) or
  dark-red (downregulated in the mutant) square. Log2 fold change is indicated for
  DE genes, their close paralogs, and for SvCYP92A6-L1/2.
