caption: 'Exosome biogenesis and regulation. Schematic representation of exosome biogenesis
  and uptake. Exosomes are initially formed as intraluminal vesicles by multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs). MVB formation has two mechanisms. The endosomal sorting complex required
  for transport (ESCRT)-dependent pathway requires a complex constituent of ESCRT,
  Vps4 (vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein), and Hsp70 (heat-shock protein).
  The typical proteins Tsg101 and Alix for exosome identification belong to the ESCRT
  complex and represent ESCRT. The other pathway involves ESCRT-independent pathways,
  which are dependent on Hsp70 binding phospholipids to assemble MVBs. After secretion,
  the recipient cells mainly uptake those exosomes in three ways: (1) endocytosis,
  by which exosomes enter into the recipient cell cytosol directly; (2) fusion, by
  which the exosome cargo is mainly released to the recipient cytosol; or (3) ligands,
  by which exosomes interact with the recipient cells either by inducing internalization
  or eliciting intracellular signaling cascades without being internalized.'
