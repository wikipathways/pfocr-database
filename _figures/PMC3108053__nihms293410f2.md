caption: 'A. Canonical replication checkpoint activated by a lesion on one strand
  of the DNA. The lesion results in DNA polymerase stalling that becomes uncoupled
  from the MCM DNA helicase. The resulting ssDNA-RPA intermediates activate the ATR-CHK1
  checkpoint pathway (Byun et al., 2005). This checkpoint is activated in response
  to UV lesions, DNA polymerase inhibition but also intra-strand crosslink generated
  by crosslinkers such as cisplatin.B. Checkpoint activation and ICL repair in G1.
  In G1, the core and ID complexes associated to ICL damage and a checkpoint is activated.
  It is not known whether ssDNA-RPA accumulates prior to, or as a consequence of an
  incision in the proximity of the crosslink. Several hypothetical modes of ssDNA-RPA
  are presented. For clarity, accumulation of ssDNA-RPA is shown only on one side
  of the ICL but could take place on both sides. Repair will proceed following unhooking,
  via translesion synthesis and NER.C. Checkpoint activation and ICL repair in S phase.
  In S-phase, FANCD1/FANCJ/FANCN (Downstream FA) associate to the fork stalled at
  the ICL independently of the core and ID complexes. Hypothetically, ssDNA-RPA could
  be generated following the incision and/or unhooking of the ICL on the lagging strand.
  In addition, the resected DSB generated following incision could be an additional
  source of ssDNA-RPA to activate a checkpoint. Note that the MCM helicase is thought
  to be loaded around dsDNA and therefore unable to unwind DNA passed the ICL. Therefore,
  the mechanism of checkpoint activation at an ICL is presumably distinct from the
  polymerase-helicase uncoupling described in A. Repair will proceed following unhooking,
  via translesion synthesis, NER and HDR. Note: a color version of the figure is available
  online.'
