caption: Schema of directed differentiation of iPSCs to lymphocytes, alveolar cells
  and lung organoids in vitro. hiPSCs in a monolayer are directed to an endoderm fate
  by inhibiting the TGFβ and BMP pathways and subsequently to early ventral anterior
  foregut cells by activating WNT and FGF signaling along with the TGFβ and BMP pathways.
  The anterior foregut cells are directed toward a lung progenitor cell fate by stimulating
  the WNT, FGF and RA signaling pathways. Downstream differentiation of lung progenitors
  can be achieved by employing protocols that activate FGF, WNT and RA signaling or
  by simultaneously activating the RA pathway and inhibiting the BMP pathway to derive
  lung organoids and alveolar cell types, respectively. By recapitulating key stages
  of lymphocyte development, T and NK cells can be derived from iPSCs. First, the
  iPSCs are induced to hematopoietic stem cell phenotypes, which undergo further specification,
  giving rise to hematopoietic progenitor cells using cytokines and factors activating
  the TGFβ and FGF signaling pathways. The hematopoietic progenitors can be directed
  toward a T-cell fate using a co-culture system in the presence of molecules that
  primarily activate the Notch pathway. NK cell derivation from hematopoietic progenitor
  cells requires the presence of various cytokines. The markers of each of the cell
  types are shown in blue. The signaling pathways are shown in red when inhibited
  and in green when stimulated. Small molecules and recombinant proteins used for
  directed differentiation processes are shown in purple. ATRA, all-trans retinoic
  acid; BMP, bone morphogenic protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FGF, fibroblast
  growth factor; OCT4, octamer-binding transcription factor 4; RA, retinoic acid;
  SAG, smoothened agonist; SCF, stem cell factor; SOX2, sex-determining region Y box;
