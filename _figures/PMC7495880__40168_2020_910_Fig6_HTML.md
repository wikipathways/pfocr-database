caption: 'Proposed ecological roles of MDM in Shark Bay microbial mats. Orange rectangular
  indicates metabolic pathways, green oval represents MDM in Shark Bay microbial mats
  while blue circles represent genes found in both a previous study [] and the current
  study. CO2/CO, H2 and ribose are proposed as main energy currencies of Shark Bay
  MDM, enclosed in red boxes. Dashed arrows indicate putative metabolic exchange/microbial
  interactions. Within the dashed box are genes involved in environmental adaptation.
  HM hydrogenotrophic methanogens, WL pathway Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, 3HP/4HB pathway
  3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway, EPS extracellular polymeric substance,
  DGR diversity-generating retroelements. A more detailed proposed ecological model
  of Shark Bay microbial mats combining MDM with other community members is illustrated
  in Additional File : Figure S16'
