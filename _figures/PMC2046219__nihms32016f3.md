caption: Schematic representation of nAChR localization within the nigrostriatal pathway
  based on receptor binding, antibody immunoprecipitation and functional studies.
  The nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals express three subtypes, the α4β2*, α6β2β3
  and α6α4β2β3 nAChR populations. The results of lesion studies in animal models suggest
  that α6α4β2β3 subtype is localized to a select population of dopaminergic terminals
  that are particularly vulnerable to nigrostriatal insults (black “X”). The α4β2*
  and α6β2β3 subtypes are most likely present on terminals other than those expressing
  α6α4β2β3 nAChRs since they are reduced only with more severe dopaminergic lesions
  (grey “X”). It is not known whether these latter two subtypes are on the same or
  separate dopaminergic terminals. The precise postsynaptic localization of the α4β2*
  nAChR subtype in striatum is presently uncertain, but they may be present on cholinergic
  and/or GABAergic neurons. α7 nAChRs are located on glutamatergic afferent terminals
  from the cortex. ACh, acetylcholine; DA, dopamine; Glu, glutamate; SN, substantia
  nigra. The * indicates the possible presence of other nAChR subunits in the receptor
  complex.
