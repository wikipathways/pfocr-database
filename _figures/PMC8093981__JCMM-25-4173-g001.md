caption: The main roles of 14‐3‐3 Proteins in cell signalling pathway. A, Regulation
  of 14‐3‐3 proteins in cell cycle. In G2/M phase, 14‐3‐3 proteins interact with CDC25C,
  which prevents CDC25C‐mediated interaction between CDK1 and Cyclin, thus blocking
  the cell cycle in M phase. CDC25C mediated by CHK1 is phosphorylated at Ser216 and
  binds to 14‐3‐3 proteins, making CDC25C blocked in the cytoplasm and inhibiting
  the cell cycle. In the G1/S phase, CHK1 kinase phosphorylates CDC25A at Ser178 and
  Thr507. Then, CDC25A binds to 14‐3‐3 proteins, thereby blocking the activation of
  the CDK/Cyclin complex, resulting in G1/S phase blockade. 14‐3‐3 proteins can degrade
  P21 in an ubiquitin‐dependent manner, thereby promoting the G1/S phase of the cell
  cycle. B, Regulation of 14‐3‐3 proteins in apoptosis. The AKT phosphorylates Ser136
  on Bad, and then Bad interacts with 14‐3‐3 proteins, blocking BAD into the cytoplasm
  and not entering the mitochondria, thereby inhibiting apoptosis. The interaction
  of ASK1 with 14‐3‐3 proteins after the phosphorylation at Ser996, they form a complex,
  thereby inhibiting the activity of ASK1 kinase, thereby inhibiting apoptosis. As
  an anti‐apoptotic factor, 14‐3‐3 proteins interact with FKHRL1, which is phosphorylated
  at Thr24, to inhibit FKHRL1‐induced apoptosis. C, Regulation of 14‐3‐3 proteins
  in autophagy. 14‐3‐3 proteins can interact with phosphorylated PRAS40 which is at
  Ser183 and Ser221 and phosphorylated TSC2 at Ser939, thereby inhibiting the initiation
  of autophagy. 14‐3‐3 proteins interact with phosphorylated ULK1 at Ser555, blocking
  the formation of pre‐autophagosomes induced by ULK1, thereby inhibiting cellular
  autophagy. 14‐3‐3 proteins interact with hVps34 at a phosphorylated site Ser212,
  and the interaction between them hinders the activity of hVps34. Beclin‐1 is also
  an important molecule in the formation of autophagosomes. Beclin‐1 interacts with
  14‐3‐3 proteins through phosphorylation at Ser234 and Ser295, thereby promoting
  tumourigenesis by inhibiting autophagy
