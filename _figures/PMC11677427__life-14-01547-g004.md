caption: Under physiological conditions, insulin binding to its receptor (IR), which
  is auto phosphorylated at Tyr residues and consequently promotes the phosphorylation
  of its substrate, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), activates the signaling pathway.
  Once activated, IRS1 functions as a scaffold protein, leading to the PI3K/Akt axis
  activation, which is essential for linking upstream effectors (IR and IRS1) with
  downstream proteins that mediate insulin neurotrophic outcomes. Activation of the
  PI3K/Akt axis is regulated by the phosphatase PTEN, which reduces PIP3 levels required
  for Akt activation as well as for increasing the expression of PKCζ. Akt promotes
  the phosphorylation of several targets, among which are GSK3β (on Ser9, inhibitory
  site) and AS160 (on Thr642, activating site). This latter, together with PKCζ, is
  responsible for translocating GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane to
  mediate glucose uptake. Along with GLUT4, the vesicles also contain other proteins,
  some of which are involved in the regulation of memory processes, such as insulin-like
  growth factor 2 (IGF2) receptors (IGF2R), insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP),
  and the Ras GTPase activator-like protein IQGAP1 [138,139,140]. Therefore, the recruitment
  of GLUT4 to the cell surface will simultaneously recruit these proteins (and vice
  versa), so that the increase in GLUT4 in the plasma membrane could be correlated
  with the cognitive effects of insulin, associated with the peptides with which it
  is co-transported. The GLUT4 translocation pathway shows points of connection with
  the action pathways induced through ER α and β, specifically about glucose metabolism
  through PI3k and Akt, the binding of estradiol to membrane-associated α and β-ER
  activates numerous signaling cascades, many of which are linked to neuroprotection.
  It also activates the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor (IGF1R), which
  mediates neuroprotective signals through the transcriptional increase of IGF1 [88]
