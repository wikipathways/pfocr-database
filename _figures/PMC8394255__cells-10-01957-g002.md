caption: Müller glia regeneration-associated molecular cascades in zebrafish. A hypothetical
  pathway representing Müller glia activation in response to injury and the sequence
  of events that leads to retinal regeneration in zebrafish (black text). Müller glia
  are quiescent in absence of injury, a process regulated by TgfB/Smad pathway. Upon
  injury, Müller glia are encouraged start reprogramming and enter the cell cycle
  in a complex of events involving B-catenin, Mapk/erk and Jak/Stat3 signalling pathways,
  which stimulate proliferation. These pathways stimulate injury-dependant Ascl-1
  expression, which regulates the generation of Müller glia-l-derived progenitor cells
  (MGPCs). Those sequences of events also occur in mammalian systems. However, the
  MGPCs in zebrafish retina expand and migrate to regenerate the injured retina. This
  regeneration potential is inefficient in mammalian systems. Intervention at key
  steps in the zebrafish Müller glia reprogramming might stimulate the regeneration
  potential in mammalian Müller glia (purple arrow).

  description: Müller glia regeneration-associated molecular cascades in zebrafish.
    A hypothetical pathway representing Müller glia activation in response to injury
    and the sequence of events that leads to retinal regeneration in zebrafish (black
    text). Müller glia are quiescent in absence of injury, a process regulated by
    TgfB/Smad pathway. Upon injury, Müller glia are encouraged start reprogramming
    and enter the cell cycle in a complex of events involving B-catenin, Mapk/erk
    and Jak/Stat3 signalling pathways, which stimulate proliferation. These pathways
    stimulate injury-dependant Ascl-1 expression, which regulates the generation of
    Müller glia-l-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs). Those sequences of events also
    occur in mammalian systems. However, the MGPCs in zebrafish retina expand and
    migrate to regenerate the injured retina. This regeneration potential is inefficient
    in mammalian systems. Intervention at key steps in the zebrafish Müller glia reprogramming
    might stimulate the regeneration potential in mammalian Müller glia (purple arrow).
