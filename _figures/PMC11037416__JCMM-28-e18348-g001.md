caption: Pyroptosis mediates macrophage reprogramming of the tumour immune microenvironment.
  The effector of tumour cell pyroptosis has the ability to reshape tumour immune
  microenvironment. ATP initiates macrophages to secrete IL‐8 to recruit neutrophils
  for infiltration, and IL‐1β promotes antigen presentation mediated by DC cells to
  prepare for T‐cell infiltration. In addition, it can also promote the functional
  activation of NK cells and CD4+ T cells and chemotaxis of macrophages to polarize
  M1 phenotype. The secretion of macrophages can crosstalk with other tumour cells
  in tumour microenvironment, which promotes the progress of tumour cell pyroptosis.
  TNF‐α can bind to the receptor on the surface of tumour cells, activate the pyroptosis
  of tumour cells through two different pathways and enhance the occurrence of anti‐tumour
  immune response. In addition, IL‐1α, IL‐1β, ATP and HMGB1 can all complete the pyroptosis
  of tumour cells by stimulating inflammatory body NLRP3. It is worth noting that
  GZMB has higher cutting efficiency than GZMA, which is helpful to inhibit tumour
  progression
