caption: Internalization of DOX-EBP conjugate into P-gp-overexpressing cells via endocytosis.
  (A) Resistance model of cells to free DOX by P-gp pump (Aller et al.,; Eckford and
  Sharom,). The two cytoplasmic, nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) of P-gp polypeptide
  bind and hydrolyse ATP, while the two transmembrane domains (TMD) form a pathway
  for substrates to cross the plasma membrane. DOX approaching the cell is rapidly
  partitioned into the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer and is closely bound to
  the drug-binding sites within the TMD. Then the cytosolic NBD is opened with the
  DOX-binding cavity formed by TMD facing towards the cytosol. This is followed by
  an ATP-dependent closure of the NBD and a concomitant alteration of P-gp to an outward-facing
  conformation, and the DOX is subsequently released outside of the cell. As a result,
  DOX is removed from the plasma membrane leaflet before entering the cell interior,
  leading to a lowered intracellular DOX level and thus drug resistance of the cell.
  (B) Cellular internalization model of DOX-EBP conjugate bypassing the P-gp pump.
  When approaching the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, the DOX-EBP conjugate
  cannot partition into the lipid bilayer and instead binds to the extracellular fragment
  of the EGF receptor (EGFR) on the cell surface, forming a receptor–conjugate complex.
  The conjugate is accumulated in an endosome and transported into the cell via receptor-mediated
  endocytosis. Once inside the cytoplasm, the conjugate is hydrolysed by a cellular
  esterase and the active DOX is released. Upon entering the nucleus, the DOX exerts
  its pharmacological action. Therefore, the DOX-EBP conjugate can bypass the P-gp
  pump by entering the DOX-resistant cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis and as
  a result overcomes the DOX resistance of the cell.
