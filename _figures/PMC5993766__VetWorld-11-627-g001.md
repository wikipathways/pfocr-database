caption: The cyclooxygenase pathway of the arachidonate cascade. In response to chemical
  and mechanical stimuli, arachidonic acid, a 20-carbon fatty acid with four double
  bonds (20:4), is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Prostaglandin
  endoperoxide H2 synthase (PGHS) catalyzes the bis-oxygenation of free AA into the
  unstable endoperoxide PGG2 and the reduction of PGG2 into PGH2, by the coordinated
  activity of the cyclooxygenase (COX) and the peroxidase domain (POX). PGH2 is further
  metabolized by cell-specific terminal isomerases and reductases to yield prostanoids.

  (PG) E2 synthase; PGFS, prostaglandin (PG) F2a synthase; PGIS, prostaglandin (PG)
  I2 synthase. TXA2 and PGI2 are unstable metabolites and hydrolyzed within minutes
  from their synthesis into the inactive metabolites, TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1α (Adapted
  from[]).
