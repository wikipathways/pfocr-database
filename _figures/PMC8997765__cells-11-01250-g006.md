caption: 'A schematic illustration for the phosphorylation events through cAMP signaling
  mechanisms. Shear stress in blood flow could be sensed via Piezo1 and GPCRs that
  trigger cAMP signaling or crosstalk between signaling pathways. Closed lines show
  an inhibition and black arrows represent a phosphorylation event. GPCR: G protein-coupled
  receptors, PDE: Phosphodiesterase, PKC: Protein kinase C.'
