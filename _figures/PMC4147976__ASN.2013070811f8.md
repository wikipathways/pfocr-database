caption: Proposed mechanisms of protective role of TRB3 in diabetic kidney disease.
  The diabetic milieu activates the ER stress pathway, including protein kinase RNA–like
  ER kinase (PERK). PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor-α
  to inhibit protein translation with selective translation of ATF4, which induces
  expression of CHOP and drives TRB3 expression. We demonstrate that in kidney cells
  TRB3 binds to Rictor and mTORC2 to inhibit phosphorylation of pAKTSer473, which
  can reduce inflammatory gene expression, including IL-6, MCP-1, and Lcn2/Ngal. ROS,
  reactive oxygen species.
