caption: (A) The pathway for the biosynthesis of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in yeast. The Vps15/34p-dependent
  phosphorylation of PtdIns leads to the production of PtdIns(3)P. A pool of this
  lipid then either traffics to the lumen of the vacuole for degradation or remains
  cytoplasmically exposed, serving as a substrate for a second, Fab1p kinase domain-dependent
  phosphotransfer reaction resulting in the synthesis of PtdIns(3,5)P2. Below the
  phosphorylated lipid products, roles for these lipids are indicated. PtdIns(3)P
  is required in anterograde traffic from the Golgi to the vacuole, whereas PtdIns(3,5)P2
  may regulate the efflux of vacuolar membrane material. (B) A model for Fab1p-mediated
  regulation of vacuolar membrane recycling/turnover. Activation of Vps34p by the
  membrane associated lipid kinase Vps15p, leads to the site-specific synthesis of
  PtdIns(3)P at the Golgi/endosomal membrane. The production of PtdIns(3)P is not
  only required for this biosynthetic trafficking route (highlighted by the solid
  arrows), but also is used by the Fab1p lipid kinase for the synthesis of PtdIns(3,5)P2.
  A large pool of PtdIns(3)P is turned over in a hydrolase-dependent manner, possibly
  by being sorted into the inner leaflet of endosomal invaginations which are transported
  to the lumen of the vacuole and, together with PtdIns(3)P, degraded. A separate
  pool of PtdIns(3)P must remain in the cytoplasmic membrane leaflet in order to be
  available to Fab1p. The presence of PtdIns(3,5)P2 may then serve to recruit factors
  involved in the efflux of membrane to earlier compartments (top, dashed lines) or
  cause the internalization of vacuolar membrane into the lumen for degradation.
