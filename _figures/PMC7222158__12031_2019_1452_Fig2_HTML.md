caption: 'Gene network of positive regulation of fat cell differentiation (obtained
  using Pathway Studio v. 12.1.0.9). Processes are highlighted in yellow, genes are
  in red, disease (PD) is in purple, and cell (neuron) is in blue. The colored arrows
  indicate the relationship between the gene and the object: regulatory pathways are
  in gray, genetic changes are in burgundy, arrows marked with + indicate positive
  links'
