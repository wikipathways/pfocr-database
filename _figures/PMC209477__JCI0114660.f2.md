caption: gp130 cytokine family pathways on anterior pituitary cells. Following immune
  (e.g., LPS) or hormonal (e.g., PACAP) stimulation, systemic or anterior pituitary
  gp130 cytokines, expressed by FS cells among others, induce the stimulation of ACTH
  (detailed in the scheme) in the pituitary. In this pathway, which is distinct from
  another mechanism activated by CRH or IL-1, POMC expression and ACTH secretion are
  stimulated through STAT3, providing a new powerful mechanism for regulation of corticotroph
  function.
