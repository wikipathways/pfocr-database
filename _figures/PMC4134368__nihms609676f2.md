caption: Biosynthesis of spiruchostatins. (A) A comparative map of the spiruchostatin
  biosynthetic (spi) gene cluster and the FK228 biosynthetic (dep) gene cluster. Genes
  are color-coded in dark red for nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes, in orange
  for polyketide synthase genes, in yellow for genes of tailoring enzymes, in blue
  for resistance genes, and in green for regulatory genes. (N) in grey indicates a
  pseudogene depN previously defined []. A solid line connects two genes whose deduced
  products have a significant sequence homology and a similar functionality; a dotted
  line connects two genes whose deduced products may function similarly but do not
  share a sequence homology. (B) A proposed model for the biosynthesis of spiruchostatins
  A and B by a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase pathway
