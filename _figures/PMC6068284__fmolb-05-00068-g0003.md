caption: 'Fumarase functions in the human and yeast DNA damage response (DDR) to double-strand
  breaks (DSBs). Two DSB repair pathways in human and yeast are non-homologous end
  joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). Left panel: Upon DSB formation
  in human cells, fumarase (FH) is phosphorylated on Thr236 by the DNA-dependent protein
  kinase (DNA-PK) complex. This modification induces the recruitment of fumarase to
  the DSB and local generation of fumarate. Fumarate inhibits the lysine demethylase
  2B (KDM2B), thereby facilitating the dimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 36 (H3K36me2)
  by the SET domain and mariner transposase fusion protein (SETMAR). This leads to
  the repair of the break by the NHEJ pathway. Right panel: The repair of a DSB by
  the HR pathway, requires that the DNA flanking the DSB undergoes resection. In yeast,
  the resection process is orchestrated by the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex, Sae2, Exo1,
  and the Dna2-STR complex. The yeast cytosolic fumarase and the metabolite fumarate
  affect the DSB resection process, by regulating the protein level of the resection
  factor Sae2.'
