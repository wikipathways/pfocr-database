caption: 'Celastrol: mechanisms of heat shock response and antioxidant response leading
  to up‐regulation of cytoprotective heat shock proteins (HSPs). Activation of the
  rapid and transient cellular defence mechanism: Celastrol hinders KEAP1, the repressor
  of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (NRF2),
  thereby allowing translocation of NRF2 to the nucleus and binding to antioxidant
  response element (ARE), which activates transcription of protective enzymes including
  haem oxygenase 1 (HSP32). Activation of the cellular pathway ensuring extended protection
  and survival: Celastrol antagonizes the essential co‐chaperone of HSP90 and CDC37,
  which results in dissociation of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) from
  its chaperone repressor HSP90. This leads to HSF1 phosphorylation, trimerization,
  nuclear translocation and binding to heat shock element (HSE), thereby inducing
  transcription of cytoprotective HSPs. Induction/amplification of protective signalling:
  Celastrol stimulates ROS production, which modulates activity of chaperones and
  repressors including HSP90 and KEAP1, leading to reactive protective signalling'
