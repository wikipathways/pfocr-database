caption: Working model illustrating the role of ET in modulating the NPR1 dependency
  of SA-JA cross talk. Attack of Arabidopsis by the necrotrophic fungus A. brassicicola
  and the herbivorous insect F. occidentalis results in the biosynthesis of JA and
  the activation of the JA signaling pathway in which the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFCOI1
  and jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins that repress the transcription of JA-responsive
  genes are central components (; ). Activation of the JA signaling cascade leads
  to the activation of JA-responsive genes such as PDF1.2 and VSP2. SA suppresses
  JA-responsive gene expression in an NPR1-dependent manner. However, when ET signaling
  is stimulated, such as upon infection by the ET-inducer A. brassicicola, the NPR1
  dependency of SA-JA cross talk is bypassed, resulting in wild-type levels of suppression
  of JA signaling in the npr1-1 mutant background.
