caption: Putative schematic of the Rac1 signaling pathways involved in different neurodevelopmental
  disorders. The upstream effector, such as Kal-7, AUTS2, NMDAR, or FMRP, activates
  or inhibits Rac1 activity to modulate its downstream signaling cascades, primarily
  via the PAK-cofilin pathway, which orchestrates neuronal cell migration, spinogenesis,
  and synaptic plasticity. Abnormalities in this Rac1-related signaling complex are
  common features of neurodevelopmental disorders. The dashed lines indicate certain
  mechanisms that remain unclear and require further investigation.
