caption: Hypothetical pathway where infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV)-triggered
  reactive oxidative species (ROS)/Nrf2 stress signals either modulate the apoptotic
  Bax/Bak death pathway or reduce viral replication in fish cells. ISKNV shows a unique
  approach, using the ROS-mediated stress response that can either upregulate the
  death factor genes Bax and Bak or induce oxidative stress signals in the early viral
  replication stages in fish cells. In the ISKNV-induced Bax/Bak cell death pathway,
  these signals are also connected to changes in mitochondrial function, observed
  as MMP loss (ΔΨm) and caspase-9/-3 activation in fish cells. On the other hand,
  the oxidative stress response can also upregulate the stress transcriptional factor
  Nrf2 and antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase, Cu/MnSOD, and ZnSOD, which are correlated
  with the metabolism of ROS, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, and thus the
  recovery of biological function in proteins or molecules. We found that the ISKNV-induced
  ROS/Nrf2-mediated Bax/Bak death pathway and viral replication can be inhibited by
  treatment with antioxidants such as GSH and NAC, providing a new strategy for viral
  control.
