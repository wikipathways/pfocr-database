caption: 'Pre-pro ET-1, the canonical precursor is synthesized as a product of transcription
  from preproendothelin , a 203-amino acid peptide that cleaved at dibasic sites by
  furin-like endopeptidases to form intermediate ETs, and then big ET''s which are
  38 to 40 amino acid residues. The intermediate and big ET''s have no biological
  activity but undergo cleavage at Trp-21- Val/Ile-22 by specific endothelin-converting
  enzymes (ECE), to yield a the mature 21aa ET-1 which is biologically active (from
  Khimji AK and Rockey DC. Endothelin-biology and disease. Cell Signal 2010 11: 1615
