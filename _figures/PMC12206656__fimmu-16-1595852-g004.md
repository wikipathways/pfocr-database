caption: Copper is closely associated with various forms of PCD. On the one hand,
  an excess of copper can enhance p53 expression and ROS levels or initiate inflammation,
  causing cell apoptosis. On the other hand, copper exposure increases ROS levels
  or reduces GPX4 expression, which subsequently leads to ferroptosis or pyroptosis
  via specific pathways. It has been shown that copper induces necroptosis mediated
  by ZBP1. Furthermore, copper can also trigger autophagy and mitophagy by inhibiting
  the AMPK/mTOR pathway or activating the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway, respectively.
  It is noteworthy that recent research has shown copper could induce cuproptosis,
  a newly discovered cell death type, characterized by the accumulation of lipoylated
  proteins and the depletion of Fe-S clusters. Possible connections are shown with
  dashed arrows
