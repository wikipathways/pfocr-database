caption: Representation of the LPS biosynthetic pathway. This image represents the
  different determinants involved in the biosynthesis of LPS (modified from the KEGG
  PATHWAY Database). Components marked with red symbols indicate differentially expressed
  genes between the SL1344 strain and its mutant lacking yedF detected in the RNA-Seq
  assay.
