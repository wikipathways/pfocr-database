caption: Compromised DNA repair downregulates mitophagy in aging-related disorders
  such as Ataxia telangiectasia, Werner syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, and Alzheimer’s
  disease. When DNA breaks occur, the DNA break sensor PARP1 detects break sites and
  initiates DNA repair signaling through generation of PAR, a process called PARylation,
  which consumes NAD+. A decrease in NAD+ and an increase upon DNA damage, nuclear
  SIRT1 can be activated to facilitate DNA repair. After lethal levels of nuclear
  DNA damage, SIRT1 is inhibited by the DNA damage response, leading to p53 acetylation
  and cell death. Loss of SIRT1 activity decreases the stimulation of mitophagy through
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC1α)- and AMP-activated
  kinase (AMPK)-dependent pathways. SIRT1 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy
  through deacetylation of PGC1α, and it also interacts with AMPK to regulate mitophagy.
  In response to DNA damage, ATM is auto phosphorylated within an MRN multiprotein
  complex that binds DSBs. Activated ATM initiates a pathway that results in activation
  of AMPK and activates the mTORC1 inhibitor protein tuberous sclerosis complex 2
  (TSC2), thereby further activating autophagy. AMPK also positively regulates PGC1α
  activity, which stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis. AMPK phosphorylates and activates
  p53, which propagates pro-apoptotic signals. p53 also has been well characterized
  in the response to genotoxic stimuli, in which it transcriptionally activates pro-apoptotic
  proteins such as BAX and p21 while simultaneously inhibiting the ULK1-containing
  autophagy-initiating complex. In addition, p53 activation may lead to decreased
  expression of parkin and decreased activation of parkin–PINK1-mediated mitophagy.
  Damaged DNAfrom nuclear or cytoplasm release into the cytosol. Aberrant localization
  of DNA in the cytosol activates the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway, leading to enhanced
  inflammatory gene expression. Activation of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway may stimulate
  autophagy/mitophagy via a cGAS/beclin-1 interaction–dependent mechanism. The cGAS-cGAMP-STING
  pathway also promotes autophagy/mitophagy by TBK1-dependent phosphorylation and
  activation of receptors OPTN and p62 (SQSTM). PINK/Parkin-induced mitophagy inhibits
  cGAS-cGAMP-STING signaling and innate immunity by mitophagy-mediated mtDNAclearance.
