caption: Schematic representation of lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis pathways.
  Citrate is cleaved by ACLY in the cytosol librerating acetyl CoA. ACACA synthesises
  malonyl CoA from acetyl CoA and malonyl CoA is subsequently converted to palmitate
  by FASN. Following this, SCD and ELOVL6 are responsible for creating long chain
  fatty acids. Acetyl CoA can also be utilised by ACAT1 in cholesterol homeostasis
  pathways which also feature HMGCS2 and HMG-CoAR
