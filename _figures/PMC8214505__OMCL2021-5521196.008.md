caption: 'A schematic pathway for CORM-3-induced HO-1 expression in RBA-1 cells. CORM-3
  enhanced NADPH oxidase and/or mitochondrial respiratory complex activity, which
  resulted in the accumulation of intracellular ROS. Oxidative stress promoted the
  phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and the activation of FoxO1 and Nrf2. After nuclear
  translocation, FoxO1 and Nrf2 bind to the ARE2 region of HO-1 promoter and increase
  the expression of the HO-1 gene in RBA-1 cells. Abbreviation: FRE: canonical forkhead
  response element; HMOX1: gene of HO-1.'
