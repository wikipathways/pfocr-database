caption: GPR126 regulates both radial sorting and myelination. A) Immature SCs migrate
  through the PNS, enveloping several axons before undergoing radial sorting and then
  proceeding down one of two distinct pathways. The first pathway involves the SC
  selecting and ensheathing a single axon (as a promyelinating SC) and then continuing
  on to myelinate that specific axon. The second involves becoming a non-myelinating
  SC that creates “Remak bundles” of non-myelinated axons. These Remak cells also
  play important roles in repair of myelin damage. The developmental expression of
  GPR126 is not known. However, current literature suggests that GPR126 is expressed
  in both immature and mature SCs. Loss of GPR126 leads to a breakdown in both pathways,
  with SCs arrested in the promyelinating phase, as well as decreased numbers of non-myelinating
  SCs. B) Collagen IV binds to GPR126 in the region of the CUB-PTX domains which leads
  to elevation of cAMP. C) In the beginning stages of development, laminin-211 exists
  as monomers and does not have sufficient interaction with GPR126 to stimulate downstream
  cAMP signaling. As the basal lamina matures, laminin-211 self-polymerizes and generates
  adequate force to facilitate GPR126 tethered agonist mediated signaling, increasing
  downstream cAMP and initiating myelin formation. D) The most recently discovered
  ligand of GPR126 is PrPc, a prion protein, that has an amino-terminal flexible tail
  that contains a cAMP inducing domain similar to that found on collagen IV. Application
  of this moiety was enough to induce a GPR126-dependent cAMP response.CUB, C1r/C1s
  domain; PTX, pentraxin domain.
