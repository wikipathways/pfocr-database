caption: The regulatory function of TRAP1 in the crosstalk between mitochondrial and
  endoplasmic reticulum. TRAP1 is characterized by different subcellular localizations/functions.
  The majority of the protein is localized in mitochondria where it is part of a supramolecular
  complex with HSP90 and cyclophilin D, responsible for regulating mitochondria integrity
  and apoptotic cell death by controlling the mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore, the cytochrome c release and the caspase cascade. The 18kDa sorcin isoform
  is part of this complex, being a TRAP1 client protein involved in the regulation
  of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis. TRAP1 is also localized on the outside of the
  endoplasmic reticulum, at the interface with mitochondria, where proteasomes are
  also present. In this context, TRAP1 is in a multiprotein complex with the 19S proteasome
  regulatory subunitTBP7, and is responsible for the quality control and intracellular
  protein ubiquitination of mitochondria-destined proteins. This TRAP1/TBP7 regulatory
  function is relevant in judging whether a protein can be repaired and reach the
  final mitochondrial destination or, if damaged, needs to be degraded through the
  ubiquitin-proteasome system.
