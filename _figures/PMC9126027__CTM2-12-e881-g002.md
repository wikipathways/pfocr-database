caption: Diagram of the FL118 mechanism of action to elucidate why FL118 possesses
  extraordinary antitumour efficacy. DDX5 (also called p68) is a multifunctional master
  regulator involved in (1) co‐activation of transcription of many oncogenes through
  the direct interactions of different transcription factors (e.g., c‐Myc) in the
  oncogenic gene promoters, (2) regulation of miRNA and pre‐RNA splicing (e.g., U1,
  U2, U3, … snRNP), and (3) ribosome biogenesis (e.g., 32S rRNA, pre‐ribosome). The
  novel small molecule drug FL118 binds to and functionally dephosphorylates and degrades
  the DDX5 protein (without decreasing DDX5 mRNA) through the proteasome degradation
  pathway, suggesting that FL118 could glue both DDX5 and ubiquitin‐involved protein
  stability/degradation regulators (i.e., FL118 acts as a “molecular glue degrader”).
  All the DDX5 downstream protein targets are known to be involved in cancer initiation,
  development, metastasis, recurrence and treatment resistance. Therefore, indirectly
  blocking DDX5 downstream targets through direct dephosphorylation and degradation
  of DDX5 by FL118 could result in FL118 high antitumour efficacy as demonstrated
  in this study, which used human CRC and PDAC cell and tumour models.
