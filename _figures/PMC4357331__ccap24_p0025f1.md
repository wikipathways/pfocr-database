caption: 'One-carbon metabolism and methotrexateMTX enters the cell via the reduced
  folate carrier (RFC[1]) by using an endocytic pathway activated by a folate receptor
  (FOLR [α, ƴ]) (a) (; ). MTX inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR),
  blocking the the conversion of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF), both
  in nuclear and cytoplasmic OCM (b). The resulting reduction of thymidylate synthesis
  leads to inhibited DNA synthesis and consequenty limits cancer cell proliferation
  (c). MTX-induced depletion of THF pools blocks the main pathway to remethylate homocysteine
  to methionine (e), which could result in an excess of homocysteine (f). To compensate
  for a loss in folate, a choline-dependent scavenger pathway (g) may be recruited
  to release the required methyl groups to regenerate SAM. Choline is usually anchored
  in the cell membrane in the form of phosphatidylcholine (PCh) and phosphatidynisitol
  (PI). The release of choline from the membrane to support methylation reactions
  may reduce the amount of phospholipids such as sphingomeylin (SM).One-carbon metabolism
  requires a number of enzymes (black boxes), including dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR),
  serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1 and 2), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase
  (MTHFD1), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase reductase
  (MTRR), methionine synthase (MTR), cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), thymidylate
  synthetase (TYMS), and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT). The black
  ovals labeled B2/6/12 refer to B vitamins. The reductive regeneration of B12 cofactor
