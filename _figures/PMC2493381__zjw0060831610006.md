  the proteins on the map to STZ-induced diabetes. The various proteins on this map
  are represented by different symbols (representing the functional class of the protein).

  kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; LIMK, LIM kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase;
  MLCP (cat), myosin light chain phosphatase, catalytic; MLCP (reg), myosin light
  chain phosphatase, regulatory; MRLC, myosin regulatory light chain; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; PI(4)P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PIPKI, phosphatidylinositol
  phosphate kinase type I; N-WASP, neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; MELC,
