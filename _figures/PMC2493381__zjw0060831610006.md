caption: 'Integrin-mediated cell adhesion pathway showing the response of some of
  the proteins on the map to STZ-induced diabetes. The various proteins on this map
  are represented by different symbols (representing the functional class of the protein).
  Thermometers with blue or red shading next to symbols depict proteins identified
  in the present study: blue color represents the proteins that were down in the STZ-induced
  diabetic relative to control group. P indicates phosphorylation, B indicates binding,
  Cn, competition; T, transformation; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; ROCK, Rho-associated
  kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; LIMK, LIM kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase;
  MLCP (cat), myosin light chain phosphatase, catalytic; MLCP (reg), myosin light
  chain phosphatase, regulatory; MRLC, myosin regulatory light chain; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; PI(4)P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PIPKI, phosphatidylinositol
  phosphate kinase type I; N-WASP, neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; MELC,
  myosin essential light chain; CRKII, v-crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog.'
