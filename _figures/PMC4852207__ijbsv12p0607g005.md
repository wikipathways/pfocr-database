caption: Action model of the brown planthopper wing polymorphism regulated by the
  PI3K/Akt/FOXO Signaling pathway. Pathway genes marked by (*) showed marked effects
  on wing phenotype when perturbed, suggesting a functional role in wing growth in
  animals. Genes whose actions are marked by (X) had no effect on wing phenotype when
  perturbed, implying that they were inactive in 4th instar wings of these animals.
