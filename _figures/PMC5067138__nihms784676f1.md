caption: Diagram illustrating the biosynthetic pathway of omega-3 fatty acids. The
  biosynthesis of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) from dietary α-linolenic acid
  (18:3n-3) requires a series of microsomal elongation (ELOVL5) and delta-5 (FADS1)
  and delta-6 desaturase (FADS2) mediated reactions. The final synthesis of DHA is
  catalyzed by β-oxidation within peroxisomes. Metabolism of DHA yields inflammation-resolving
  docosanoids. Preformed DHA and EPA can also be obtained directly from the diet.
