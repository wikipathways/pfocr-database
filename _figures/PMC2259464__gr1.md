caption: The RAS signaling pathway. RAS proteins are transiently activated by a wide
  range of extraneous signals, such as binding of growth factor ligands to the cognate
  growth factor receptor. In its active state, RAS is bound to GTP, and inactivation
  occurs through guanosine triphosphate-activating proteins (GAPs), which promote
  GTP hydrolysis. RAS proteins engage a number of downstream effector pathways, including
  RAF-mitogen activated protein kinase (RAF-MAPK), phosphoinsositide-3-kinase (PI3K),
  and RalGDS pathways. The proximal proteins in these signaling cascades, in turn,
  activate downstream intermediaries (eg, MEK/ERK, AKT, RAL) that mediate diverse
  cellular functions such as proliferation, cell survival, and cell motility. Oncogenic
  mutations of the KRAS2 gene, which compromises the intrinsic GTPase activity of
  the encoded protein, render the pathway constitutively active in pancreatic cancer.
