caption: List of genes involved in the complement and coagulation cascades pathway
  generated by KEGG of the differently expressed genes between C. irritans-infected
  and non-infected S. marmoratus, 24 h (group B) and 48 h (group C) post-challenge
  and uninfected fish were sampled as control (group A). a group B vs group A; b group
  C vs group A. Red indicates significantly increased expression; green indicates
  significantly decreased expression; and pink indicates unchanged expression. Blue
  denotes genes that were not identified in the expression profile analysis
papertitle: Transcriptomic analysis reveals the key immune-related signalling pathways
  of Sebastiscus marmoratus in response to infection with the parasitic ciliate Cryptocaryon
  irritans.
