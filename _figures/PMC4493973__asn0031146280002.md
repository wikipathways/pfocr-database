caption: Proposed mechanisms for discriminating DAMPS from PAMPs and limiting the
  immune response. Several groups have recently proposed mechanisms that share a common
  theme involving coreceptors that pair with receptors for DAMPs and PAMPs to allow
  cells to distinguish between these related molecules and perhaps elicit downstream
  immune responses that may be specific for the ligand. For simplicity, these examples
  are illustrated only with inflammation as the target response, but selective signaling
  mechanisms may also result in varied inflammatory responses and provide specificity
  that may or may not include activation of adaptive immunity and tissue repair processes.
  (1) The CD24-Siglec pathway can distinguish DAMPs from PAMPs and can suppress DAMP
  signaling to prevent an unrestrained immune response and excessive collateral tissue
  damage.– By interacting with sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectins (Siglec-G (mouse)
  or Siglec-10 (human)), CD24, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecule
  (also known as heat-stable antigen) with diverse T-cell homeostatic functions, negatively
  regulates the TLR- or NLR-mediated immune response to HMGB1 and heat-shock proteins
  but not PAMPs (LPS or poly(I:C)) perhaps by facilitating association with phosphatases,
  like SHP-1. (2) Others suggest that although PAMPs and DAMPs bind to some of the
  same receptors, interaction with different coreceptors may account for a divergence
  in downstream effects. (3) A mechanism for discriminating DAMPs from PAMPs has also
  been demonstrated for two other cell surface proteins, CD14 (which recognizes DAMPs
  in the absence of TLR2 and promotes both TLR2-DAMP and TLR2-PAMP responses) and
  myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2; responding to and enhancing only exogenous
  PAMP responses in complexes with CD14-TLR2 or CD14-TLR4), that form complexes with
  Toll receptors. (4) Similarly, biglycan binding and induction of a multireceptor
  complex with TLR2/4 and purinergic P2×4 or P2×7 receptors activates the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  and this complex may regulate immune cell infiltration and tissue injury in kidneys
  (not illustrated here).
