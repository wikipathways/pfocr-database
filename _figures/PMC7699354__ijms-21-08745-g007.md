caption: 'Lactonization or glucuronidation of statins. Conversion of statin acids
  into statin lactones is mediated by UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT), or by the
  CoASH-dependent pathway. This reaction is reversible and occurs via hydrolysis of
  the lactone by esterases or paraoxonases. Statins have an oxidative interconversion
  pathway which involves the Cytochrom P450 family. Reprinted from Pharmacology and
