caption: Schematic representation of signaling pathway of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth
  in PC12 cells. In the early phase (0–10 min), global activation of PI3-kinase upon
  NGF stimulation recruited Vav2 and Vav3 to activate Rac1/Cdc42 in broad areas. Lamellipodial
  protrusion at the cell periphery was concomitantly observed. Sos1 partially mediated
  Cdc42 activation only in cell bodies immediately after NGF addition. In the late
  phase (10–30 min), NGF/TrkA signaling drives a cycling of positive feedback loop
  comprised of PI3-kinase, Vav2/3, Rac1/Cdc42, and actin cytoskeleton; this feedback
  loop promotes neurite outgrowth by regulating morphological dynamics.
