caption: Model of IP-10-induced enhancement of latent HIV infection and reservoir
  establishment in resting memory CD4+ T cells. A signaling pathway common to HIV
  (gray solid line) and IP-10 (black solid line) induces actin activation. IP-10 binds
  to CXCR3 expressed on the surface of resting memory CD4+ T cells; Rac stimulates
  p21-activated kinase (PAK), which activates LIMK, leading to cofilin phosphorylation
  and actin polymerization. Another reported signaling pathway for latent HIV infection
  of resting CD4+ T cells (dotted line) involves HIV binding to CXCR4; the signal
  is transferred to CDC42, which activates Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome family protein
  (WASP) and actin-nucleating protein (Arp2/3) to promote actin assembly.
