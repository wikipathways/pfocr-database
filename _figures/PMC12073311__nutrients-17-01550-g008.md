caption: Working hypothesis. (A) Chronic alcohol consumption leads to an increase
  in circulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, locally, to an increase in the
  mitochondrial protein Hsp60. Hsp60, in the presence of oxidative stress, could translocate
  from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm via a voltage-dependent anion channel located
  on the mitochondrial membrane and interact directly with IκB. The dissociation of
  IκB from NF-κB would induce the phosphorylation of NF-κB (pNF-κB) and its translocation
  to the nuclear level, where it could induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines,
  including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10, as well as the reduction of the expression of
  markers responsible for mechanisms of muscle regeneration and differentiation, such
  as Pax7 and MyoD. These events would be responsible for the atrophy of muscle fibers
  found in animals treated with alcohol for 8 and 12 weeks. (B) The potential effects
  of L. fermentum may involve modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway [24]. The
  probiotic L. fermentum, through the production of the antioxidant glutathione, could
  induce the reduction of local Hsp60 levels as a protective mechanism against oxidative
  stress. In this way, Hsp60 would not be exported from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm
  and would not interact with IκB. NF-κB would therefore remain associated with IκB
  in an inactive complex and could not activate the expression of inflammatory cytokines.
  Consequently, the negative effects of alcohol-induced damage, such as the reduction
  of markers of muscle regeneration and differentiation (Pax7 and MyoD) at the muscle
  level, may be enhanced. These phenomena would contribute to counteract the atrophy
  of skeletal muscle fibers induced by chronic EtOH consumption, suggesting a possible
  protective role of the probiotic L. fermentum
