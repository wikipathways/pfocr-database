caption: 'The TGF-β signaling pathway: at the blood-brain barrier, TGF-β signaling
  is mediated by 2 distinct receptors designated activin receptor–like kinase 1 (ALK-1)
  and ALK-5. Activation of ALK-1 by binding of BMP-9 triggers phosphorylation of Smads
  1, 5, and 8, whereas activation of ALK-5 via TGF-β triggers phosphorylation of Smads
  2 and 3. Once phosphorylated, these Smad signal-transducing proteins bind to the
  common Smad (ie, Smad4) and form a complex that translocates into the nucleus and
  regulate transcription of target genes. TF indicates transcription factor; TGF-β,
  transforming growth factor β. Figure is an original and previously unpublished drawing.'
