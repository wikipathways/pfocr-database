caption: Model illustrating the signaling pathways activated by optimal DA and hyperdopamine.
  A, under normal conditions, optimal DA through activation of D1-coupled Gs/olf protein
  activates the classic AC/cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32 pathway, which reduces the activity of
  protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). In addition, phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by Cdk5 causes
  inhibition of PKA, inactivation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and decreased
  dephosphorylation of DARPP-32. Inhibition of PKA also results in decreased phosphorylation
  of DARPP-32 and, therefore, inactivation of PP1. Inhibition of PKA and activation
  of PP1 synergistically regulate the phosphorylation of various substrates, such
  as AMPA and NMDA receptors, and thus induce long-term plasticity and enhance cognitive
  functions. B, under hyperdopaminergic conditions, however, the signaling pathways
  activated by DA are much more complicated. On the one hand, by sequentially activating
  DA D1 receptors, PKA and PP2A reduce the level of DARPP-32. Dephosphorylation of
  DARPP-32 by PP-2A removes the inhibition of PKA. Activation of PKA also results
  in increased phosphorylation of DARPP-32 and inhibition of PP1. Activation of PKA
  and inhibition of PP1 synergistically increase the phosphorylation of various substrates
  such as glutamate receptors. On the other hand, emerging evidence indicates that
  a high concentration of DA likely activates D2 receptors more than it does D1 receptors.
  Under hyperdopaminergic conditions, Akt/GSK-3β signaling cascade critically mediates
  DA actions via D2-like receptors. This cAMP-independent signaling pathway involves
  β-arrestin and PP2A in the upstream and regulation of glutamate receptors and synaptic
  plasticity in the downstream. Consequently, increase of GSK-3β activity would cause
  a cognitive deficit. In the striatum, it has also been reported that under a high
  concentration of DA, the D1/D2 heterooligomer couples to Gq/11 or Gβγ to activate
  the phospholipase C/IP3/PP2B pathway and to regulate synaptic functions.
