  lines indicate homolog axes associated with HORMAD1. Red “explosions” represent
  unrepaired DSBs. Transparent boxes indicate repair pathways that are unavailable
  following desynapsis in diplotene. Inter-sister repair is actively impeded by RNF212-dependent
  reassociation of HORMAD1 with desynapsed homolog axes. Consequently, residual DSBs
  persist and robustly signal via the DNA-damage response pathway. The integrated
  level of damage signaling from all residual DSBs dictates whether an individual
  oocyte undergoes apoptosis or survives to form a primordial follicle and become
  established in the ovarian reserve.
