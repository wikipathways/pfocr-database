caption: a | Ca2+ influx into cells is regulated by noradrenaline signalling and levels
  of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3, which is produced from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PtdIns(4,5)P2) by phospholipase C) in the cells; increased intracellular Ca2+ binds
  to calmodulin, facilitating the formation of the calmodulin–myosin light chain kinase
  (MLCK) complex. This leads to the phosphorylation of MLC, resulting in smooth muscle
  contraction and a flaccid penis. Noradrenaline signalling also inhibits adenylyl
  cyclase and modulates the RHO-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway, which increases
  the sensitivity of MLC to Ca2+, a process negatively regulated by testosterone.
  Endothelins and prostaglandins from the endothelium also trigger an increase in
  intracellular Ca2+ to promote smooth muscle contraction. b | When the smooth muscle
  is contracted, inflow of blood through the cavernous artery is minimal, and blood
  outflows freely through the subtunical venular plexus. ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  MLCP, myosin light chain phosphatase.
