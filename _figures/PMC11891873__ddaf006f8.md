caption: Dysregulation of LXR/RXR signalling pathway at P18 in Smn2B/− mice. Visual
  representation of LXR/RXR canonical signalling pathway generated by IPA. Pathway
  reflects known interactions between proteins as evidenced in hepatocytes and macrophage.
  This schematic diagram is obtained by conversion of overlaid datasets into fold-change
  ratios representing expression alteration in the Smn2B/− mouse model compared to
  its control using ingenuity pathway analysis. The blue represents predicted downregulation,
  red represents an upregulation in expression, orange represents a predicted upregulation,
  grey represents a change less than the 20% threshold, white represents proteins
  that are involved in the pathway but are not expressed in the dataset
