caption: Actions of metformin in eukaryotic cells. Metformin needs to be transported
  into cells by transporters for cationic compound like organic cation transporters
  (OCTs). Then, according to reports, metformin has the potential to affect cell metabolism
  and cell signalling (, ). In fact, multiple activities have been described in normal
  and tumor cells. Metformin can induce energetic stress by inhibiting complex I ()
  and mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) (, ). Metformin-mediated
  inhibition of mitochondrial respiration leads to oxidative stress which in turn
  can enhance the activity of the transcription factor ATF3, as observed in rat pituitary
  tumor cells (). At the same time, the decrease of ATP levels can lead to the activation
  of AMP-activated protein kinase signalling (AMPK). AMPK activation is believed to
  mediate some stimulatory or inhibitory effects of metformin on different signalling
  pathways downstream of cell-surface receptors which, in turn, regulate cell growth
  and differentiation, programmed cell death, protein synthesis in normal- and tumor
  cells (, , ), including pituitary tumor cells (). In skeletal muscle cells, metformin
  can activate AMPK through the inhibition of AMP deaminase, in the absence of significant
  changes in ATP levels (). AMPK-independent effects of metformin on cell signalling
  have been also shown. The underlying mechanisms of action have not been fully described.
  In pituitary tumor cells, metformin inhibited STAT3 signalling (). In normal primate
  pituitary cells, the effects of metformin on pituitary hormone secretion were found
  to be dependent on PI3K-mTOR pathway activation. Morover, the drug was able to increase
  the expression of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (i.e. somatostatin receptors)
  and tyrosine-kinase receptors (TRKs) (i.e. insulin and IGF-1 receptors) in the same
  cells (). See related text paragraph for details.
