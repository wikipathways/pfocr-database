caption: Viral sensing, following either direct fusion with the plasma membrane, or
  receptor-mediated endocytosis, initiates innate immunity and regulates virus-induced
  disease. Depending upon the viral genome content and entry mechanism, viral nucleic
  acids, or replicative intermediates, are recognized by one of the cellular sensing
  molecules such as DAI, RIG-I/MDA5, or one of the endosomal TLRs (3, 7, 9), and an
  innate anti-viral program is activated. Recognition of RNA viruses (RIG-I/MDA5)
  and DNA viruses (DAI) by the intracellular sensors stimulates innate immunity that
  limits replication and promotes protection. In the case of the TLR pathway, viral
  sensing by endosomal TLRs may lead to a protective innate and adaptive immune response.
  For certain ssRNA viruses, the delivery of viral PAMP to the late endosome/lysosome
  compartment is mediated by autophagy. Conversely, these interactions may exacerbate
  virus-induced disease, leading to a poor outcome for the host. Likewise, plasma
  membrane TLRs may also promote virus-induced inflammation. Together, these examples
  highlight how viral-TLR interactions affect virus-induced disease both in a positive
  and negative fashion.
