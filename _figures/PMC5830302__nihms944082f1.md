caption: Biosynthetic pathways to precolibactins. Compounds 1–13 (complete structures
  are shown in ) are proposed to be generated by the NRPS/PKS hybrid proteins ClbNBCHIJ.
  The extender unit 2-aminomalonyl (AM, highlighted in red) is produced by ClbDEF
  together with the first A domain of ClbH. The absence of ClbQ (in a ΔclbP ΔclbQ
  mutant of clb+E. coli), allowed identification of 2-AM containing compounds 14–16,
  via pathway A. The presence of ClbQ (in a ΔclbP background) directs to pathway B,
  compounds 17–19. A, adenylation; ACP, acyl carrier protein; AT, acyl transferase;
  C condensation; Cy, cyclization; DH, dehydratase; E, epimerase; KS, keto synthase;
  Ox, oxidase; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein.
