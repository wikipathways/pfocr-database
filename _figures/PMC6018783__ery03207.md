caption: 'Model of spatial repression of rutin biosynthesis by JA-responsive MYB factors
  in F. tataricum. Left panel: FtMYB13, FtMYB14, FtMYB15, and FtMYB16 are synthesized
  in the cytoplasm. FtMYB13, FtMYB14, and FtMYB15 are recruited by an importin protein,
  Sensitive to ABA and Drought 2 (SAD2). FtSAD2 recognizes the nuclear pore complex,
  which then transports the FtSAD2/FtMYB13, FtSAD2/FtMYB14, and FtSAD2/FtMYB15 complexes
  into the nucleus, increasing the repression activity of FtMYB factors in stem and
  inflorescence. FtMYB16 specifically acts as a repressor, depending on the EAR motif,
  in root. In the nucleus, FtJAZ1 interacts with FtMYB13 and acts as a co-repressor
  to repress expression of the FtMYB13 target genes of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
  via binding to MYB binding sites (MBS), mainly in stem, leaves, and inflorescence.
  Right panels: Simplified transcriptional networks of JA signaling in rutin biosynthesis.
  (Upper panel) Binding of the JAZ repressor to FtMYB TFs represses the expression
  of rutin biosynthesis pathway genes. (Lower panel) The presence of bioactive JAs
  results in COI1-mediated degradation of JAZ and FtMYB repressors via the 26S proteasome
  pathway, thus inducing rutin accumulation. Arrows indicate activation, and T-shaped
  lines indicate inhibition. SCF, Skp–Cullin–F-box protein.'
