caption: Exposing to allergens promotes Th0 cell to differentiate towards Th2 cells,
  stimulate B cells to produce IgE, IgE bind to mast cell and activate them. Once
  mast cells are triggered, it releases their pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
  Together with Th2 cell-released cytokines, the leukocytes are recruited and activated
  lead to the airway allergic inflammatory symptoms. NF-κB pathway is activated to
  more amplify the inflammatory situation. Here, FA showed their anti-allergic inflammatory
  effect by balancing the Th1/Th2 ratio, suppressing the NF-κB signaling, and inhibiting
  mast cell degranulation.
