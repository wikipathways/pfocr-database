caption: Proposed pathways for colorectal tumorigenesis in proximal/whole-colon (upper
  panel) and distal serrated polyposis (SPP) associated with a family history of SPP
  and/or polyps/colorectal cancer (SPP-FHP/CRC) (bottom panel). Both of these forms
  may follow a KRAS (alternate) or a BRAF (serrated) pathway, (A and B), respectively,
  in the upper and lower panels. In addition, in distal SPP, an adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC) (traditional) pathway may also occur [(C) in bottom panel]. Each lesion
  or molecular alteration in these proposed pathways is hypothesized based on the
  results obtained in the present study and we do not exclude that, in some cases,
  some of these molecular alterations may not occur, or even that other molecular
  alterations may also be found. The steps involving lesions that were not analyzed
  in this study and about which we have previously published information are represented
  by broken arrows. In some pathways a broken line was used to represent the increase
  in microsatellite instability (MSI) with tumor progression, to suggest a lower frequency
  in those cases. Ca, carcinoma; H P, hyperplastic polyp; MMR, mismatch repair; SSA,
  sessile serrated adenoma; TA, tubular adenoma; TSA, traditional serrated adenoma;
  TVA, tubulovillous adenoma.
