caption: 'Schematic diagram of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (A) and its regulation
  by the MBW complex (B) in plants. (A) The enzymes shown in light blue hexagons,
  while reactions products are drawn in black: PAL phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, CHS
  chalcone synthase, CHI chalcone isomerase, F3H flavanone-3β-hydroxylase, FLS flavonol
  synthase, GT unidentified enzyme encoding a glycosyl transferase for flavonol glycone
  synthase, DFR dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, LAR leucoanthocyanidin reductase, LDOX
  leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, ANR anthocyanidin reductase, and UFGT UDP-glucose:flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase.
  (B) The transcriptional regulators bHLH and MYB bind the DNA at specific responsive
  elements (BRE and MRE, respectively), while the WDR protein stabilizes the MBW complex.'
