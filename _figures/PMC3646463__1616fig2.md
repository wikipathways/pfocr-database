caption: 'Ceramide metabolic pathways in mammalian cells. Here we constructed a simplified
  pathway of ceramide metabolism in the cell. Ceramides are the simplest sphingolipids
  and are at the center of sphingolipid metabolism. There are two major pathways for
  ceramide synthesis in a cell: de novo biosynthesis and hydrolysis from complex sphingolipids.
  Also shown in the figure is the ceramide catabolic pathway, along with specific
  enzymes, expression of which has been studied. SPT, serine palmitoyl transferase;
  CerS, ceramide synthase; SMase, sphingomyelinase; Gba, glucosidase, β, acid; GCS,
  glucoceramide synthase; ASAHs, acyl-sphingosine amidohydrolases (ceramidases); SPHKs,
  sphingosine kinases; S1PP, sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase; SGPL, sphingosine-1-phosphate
  lyase; CERK, ceramide kinase; C1PP, ceramide-1-phosphate phosphatase.'
