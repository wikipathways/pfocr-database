caption: (A) The PIM biosynthetic pathway in mycobacteria. According to the currently
  accepted model, the mannosylation steps of the PIM derivatives start in the cytosolic
  face of the IM with the consecutive mannosylation of PI, catalyzed by PimA and PimB
  to form PIM2. PIMs are further acylated by PatA and by a not yet identified acyltransferase,
  to form Ac1PIM2 and Ac2PIM2, at the cytosolic face of the IM, respectively. It is
  worth noting that the inner leaflet of the inner mycobacterial membrane is likely
  composed nearly entirely of Ac2PIM2 (). Although Ac1PIM2/Ac2PIM2 and Ac1PIM6/Ac2PIM6
  are the most abundant forms of PIMs in M. bovis BCG, M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and
  M. smegmatis 607, all forms of PIM2 could eventually translocate to the outer leaflet
  of the IM by an unknown mechanism, which could involve the action of a flippase.
  PimE (Rv1159), an integral membrane glycosyltransferase family C (GT-C) enzyme that
  use polyprenyl-linked sugars as donors, is involved in the biosynthesis of higher-order
  PIMs in the periplasmic phase of the IM (). Other mannosyltransferases involved
  in the biosynthesis of polar PIMs remain to be identified. (B) Specifically, PatA
  catalyzes the transfer of a palmitoyl moiety from palmitoyl-CoA to the 6-position
  of the mannose ring linked to 2-position of myo-inositol in PIM1 and PIM2.
