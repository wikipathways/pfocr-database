caption: 'Mechanism of action of PIs, immunomodulators, and HDACi.Notes: Proteasomes
  are intracellular structures which catabolize proteins that are marked with ubiquitin.
  PI block this mechanism of action causing accumulation of proteins triggering cell
  death. New molecular target identified for IMiD is cereblon, which is a key component
  of E3 ubiquitin ligase. This binding catalyzes ubiquitination of transcription factors
  IKZF1/IKZF3 eventually degrading them. IMiDs also modulate and inhibit angiogenesis
  and activate NK cells. HDAC enzymes regulate acetylation of the N-terminals of histones
  and other transcription factors. This is blocked by HDACi causing downregulation
  of protein expression. HDAC is also known to activate aggresome–proteasome pathway,
  which is blocked by HDACi. Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publisher Ltd:
