caption: Interaction of lactobacilli with transformed cells. A. Peroxidase (POD) released
  from DUOX (#1) and NOX1 (#2) cooperate in HOCl signalling. NOX1-derived extracellular
  superoxide anions dismutate to H2O2 (#3), which is used by POD as substrate for
  HOCl synthesis (#4). HOCl interacts with superoxide anions (#5), generating hydroxyl
  radicals (#6) that cause lipid peroxidation, followed by apoptosis. However, this
  process requires a sufficient density of transformed cells and is relatively slow
  (see  for details). Lactobacilli (LB) (#7) generate H2O2 in abundance (#8) which
  penetrates into the cells through aquaporins (#9) and causes intracellular Fenton
  chemistry (#10) and subsequent apoptosis induction (#11). B. In the presence of
  MPO (#8), lactobacillus-derived H2O2 (#7) is used as substrate for HOCl synthesis
  by MPO (#9). HOCl (#10) then interacts with NOX1-derived superoxide anions (#11),
  leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals (#12) that cause lipid peroxidation
  (#13) and apoptosis induction through the mitochondrial pathway (#14).
