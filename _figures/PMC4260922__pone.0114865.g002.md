caption: Detected transcripts for the different immune pathways are indicated in solid
  boxes, relevant proteins in the pathway that were not found are depicted in dashed
  boxes. Transcripts with more than twofold changes in expression between symbiotic
  and aposymbiotic bugs are indicated by arrows (red  =  up-regulated in aposymbiotic
  bugs, blue  =  down-regulated in aposymbiotic bugs).
