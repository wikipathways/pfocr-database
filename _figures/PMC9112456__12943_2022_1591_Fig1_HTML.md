caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway in vertebrates. a In the absence of Hh ligand,
  Ptch inhibits the cilia translocation and activation of Smo. The Gli-Sufu-Kif7 complex
  forms, and the full-length Gli is subsequently phosphorylated by PKA, GSK3β and
  CK1 to become GliR with truncated form. The GliR enters the nucleus to inhibit the
  transcription of Hh target genes. b The binding of Hh-Ptch releases the inhibition
  of Smo. Activated Smo promotes Gli to escape from the bondage of Sufu and free to
  become GliA in a full-length form, entering the nucleus to induce target gene expression
