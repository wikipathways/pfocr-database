caption: 'FAT1 is a transmembrane protein that undergoes complex processing. (A) FAT1
  structure showing its large extracellular domain (ECD) bearing 34 cadherin repeats,
  5 EGF-like motifs, and one laminin A-G motif. FAT1 also has a single transmembrane
  spanning domain and an intracellular domain (ICD). EGF, epidermal growth factor.
  (B) In vascular SMCs the FAT1 ICD has been found in mitochondria and nuclei, suggesting
  that FAT1 undergoes proteolytic processing that releases the ICD. Studies of FAT1
  in cancer biology propose two processing pathways: classical (left panel) and alternative
  (right panel). The classical pathway involves three sequential proteolytic events:
  1) furin-mediated cleavage that occurs in the secretory pathway and results in expression
  of a heterodimer on the membrane, 2) a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)-mediated
  cleavage of the ECD that results in ectodomain shedding, and 3) a γ-secretase complex-mediated
  cleavage in the transmembrane region that releases the ICD. In the alternative pathway,
  intact full-length FAT1 is expressed on the plasma membrane and cleaved in its extracellular
  domain by an unknown protease. Proteolytic processing has not been formally studied
  in vascular SMCs, thus whether FAT1 follows classical or alternative proteolytic
  processing (or both), and the identity of the proteolytic enzymes involved (E1,
  E2, E3, and E4) remain unknown. Whether FAT1 cleavage is regulated by ligand binding
  is also an open question (see also refs (, ).'
