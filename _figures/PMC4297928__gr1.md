caption: Simplified pathophysiology of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and etheno-DNA
  adduct formation. Inflammation driven cytokine secretion results among others in
  NFκB activation and in the activation of NADPH oxidase (NADPH-Ox) as well as myeloperoxidase
  (MPO). NFκB is also activated by acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol oxidation.
  NFκB stimulates lipoxigenase (LOX), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), and inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS). As a result ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are generated,
  which lead to lipidperoxidation with the occurrence of lipidperoxidation products
  such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), 4-hydroxyhydroperoxy-2-nonenal (HPNE), and malondialdehyde
  (MDA). These adducts react with DNA bases to form exocyclic etheno/propane-DNA adducts.
  Chronic alcohol consumption results in the induction of cytochrome P-4502 E1 which
  is involved in ethanol oxidation through the microsomal ethanol oxidizing pathway.
  During this reaction ROS is generated without inflammation. Other compounds such
  as free fatty acids or acetone also induce CYP2E1 which is especially relevant in
  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), when the liver is loaded with fat and
  in patients with diabetes mellitus when acetone is generated in the liver.
