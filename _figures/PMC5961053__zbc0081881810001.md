caption: Production, elimination, and signaling of ROS. Mitochondria and NADPH oxidases
  (NOXs) are the main sources of superoxide (O2˙̄), which is converted to hydrogen
  peroxide (H2O2) by superoxide dismutases (SODs). H2O2 can subsequently (a) oxidize
  thiols within redox-regulated proteins to conduct cellular signaling or (b) be reduced
  to water by antioxidant systems largely composed of NRF2-regulated enzymes. The
  peroxiredoxin (PRX)/thioredoxin (TRX) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX)/glutathione
  (GSH) systems are fueled by NADPH. This key reducing equivalent is generated by
  a complex network of metabolic pathways and enzymes involving the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs), malic enzymes (MEs), and one-carbon
  metabolism. Interestingly, NADPH is also a substrate for the ROS-generating NOXs.
  This suggests that the antioxidant systems and ROS producers are equally important
  for biological processes, and they work in concert to regulate redox environments
  that permit the ROS-mediated signaling without incurring oxidative damage.
