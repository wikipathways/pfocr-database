caption: Proposed model to illustrate the regulation of quiescence stage of persisting
  chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) leukemic stem cells by their microenvironment. (Left)
  Leukemic stem cell dormancy of cells that interact with stromal cells of the niche
  is partly driven by BMP4 binding to its BMPR1B receptor over-expressed in those
  cells. This leads to phosphorylation of the Smad signaling (P-Smad 1/5/8) canonical
  pathway. It co-operates with the activation of Jak2/Stat3 signal through P-Stat3
  induced directly by BMPR1B and/or by other cytokines binding to their receptors
  repressing proliferation while inducting quiescence genes expressions. (Right) Using
  a chemical inhibitor toward BMPR1B (E6201) in combination with a Jak2 inhibitor
  (AG490), targeting LSC could induce their proliferation and repress their quiescence.
  In addition, E6021 is preventing BMP4-induced production by stromal cells upon AG490
  exposure, allowing a simultaneous dual targeting of the LSC and their leukemic protecting
  microenvironment.

  on BMPR1B, Stat3 and BMP4-niche signals to persist in patients in remission.
