caption: 'Nucleotide salvage pathway. Reactions not present in S. elongatus are indicated
  by dashed black arrows, essential reactions are indicated by red arrows, nonessential
  reactions are indicated by blue arrows, and those essential in the model but not
  analyzed in vivo are indicated by red-outlined arrows. Reactions important for nucleotide
  salvage are numbered as follows: 1, uricil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPPRT); 2,
  cytosine deaminase; 3, thymidine phosphorylase; 4, guanine phosphoribosyltransferase;
  5, xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; 6, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase;
  7, and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (ADPT). Reaction and metabolite abbreviations
  are given in BiGG format (bigg.ucsd.edu) and found in .'
