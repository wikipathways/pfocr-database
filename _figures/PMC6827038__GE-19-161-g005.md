caption: Effect of Ad-Cyp8b1 on liver and intestine gene expression and mTORC1 signaling
  in HFD-fed mice. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were injected with Ad-CYP8b1 (n = 11) or
  Ad-GFP control (n = 11) and fed with high-fat diet (60% kcal from fat) for 2 weeks.
  Mice were fasted for 6 h before sacrifice. (A) qPCR analysis of bile acid synthesis
  gene mRNA expression. (B) qPCR analysis of liver lipogenic gene mRNA expression.
  (C) qPCR analysis of liver ceramide synthesis gene mRNA expression (left) and triglyceride
  synthesis gene mRNA expression (right). (D) Immunoblot analysis of nSREBP-1c and
  phosphorylation of S6K and AKT. (E) qPCR analysis of ileum FXR target gene and ceramide
  synthesis gene mRNA expression. Results shown are means ± SE. Student’s t-test was
  used for statistical analysis. *Statistically significant difference (p < 0.05),
  Ad-Cyp8b1 versus Ad-Control mice.
