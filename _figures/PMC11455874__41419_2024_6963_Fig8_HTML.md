caption: Intracellular C5aR1 activates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which transduces
  signals into the nucleus. These signals then increase METTL3 expression and stabilize
  the m6A level of GPX4, thereby upregulating GPX4 expression to prevent ferroptosis
  in GBM cells and ultimately promoting GBM progression. In addition, treatment with
  the p-ERK1/2 agonist Ro 67-7476, overexpression of METTL3, and overexpression of
  GPX4 strongly protect GBM cells from ferroptosis caused by C5aR1 knockdown
