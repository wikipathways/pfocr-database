caption: 'Different downstream KOR signaling pathways mediate distinct functions.
  The G protein-mediated KOR signaling pathway plays an inhibitory role by activating
  G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir3s) and blocking voltage-gated
  Ca2+ channels. Gα mediates a decrease in cAMP via Gαi and causes ERK phosphorylation
  (early phase: 5–15 min after agonist treatment). This classic pathway mediates the
  analgesia induced by KOR ligands. Separately, KOR activation also recruits arrestin
  and leads to the activation of several kinase cascades including ERK (late phase:
  2 h after agonist treatment) and p38, which mediate the adverse effects induced
  by KOR ligands. Biased KOR agonism of the G protein-dependent pathway should lead
  to effective analgesia with fewer side effects. Arrows: activation steps, T lines:
  inhibition of function. Kir3, G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel;
  VGCC, voltage-gated Ca2+ channel; P, phosphorylation; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate;
  GRK3, G protein-coupled receptor kinase.'
