caption: Proposed mechanism of associated vWF activating GPIIb/IIIα. Lateral associated
  vWF are formed by different multi-vWF through disulfide bond. Associated vWF binds
  to GPIb-IX-V through A1 domain (in yellow), leading to a shift of GPIIb/IIIa conformation
  from a low-affinity to high affinity. After the conformation alteration, activated
  GPIIb/IIIa binds to the C domain (in red) of associated vWF by RGDS within C domain.
  The generally known signaling pathway from GPIb-IX-V to GPIIb/IIIa is shown in the
  left platelet which depends on the out-inside and inside-out signaling. Here we
  have depicted the events subsequent to the interaction between vWF and GPIb-IX-V.
  The activated GPIb-IX-V subsequently increases the level of intracellular calcium,
  which is regulated by PLCγ2 derived second messengers inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The elevated Ca2+ and DAG together increase CalDAG-GEFI
  activity that in turn activates RapIb. This leads to the formation of an “activation
  complex” consisting of RapI, RIAM and talin, which finally cooperates with kindlin3
  to activate GPIIb/IIIa. Another possible pathway from GPIb-IX-V to GPIIb/IIIa is
  shown in the right platelet. On the other hand, lipid rafts may serve as a platform
  to concentrate activated GPIb-IX-V and GPIIb/IIIa in their respective local membrane
  when vWF self-association occurs. The formation of lipid rafts is required for out-inside
  signaling in contrast with the activation of receptor itself by ligand only. They
  can change the recruitment of these intracelluar receptors and their adaptor proteins
  in close proximity manner.
