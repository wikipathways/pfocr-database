caption: 'Iron cycle in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In the tumor cell, TFR1
  internalizes Fe3+-loaded TF through an endocytosis-mediated mechanism. In addition,
  NTBI uptake is mediated by DMT1, ZIP8/14, and the L-type voltage-dependent calcium
  channels. When not used or stored, excess iron can be exported through FPN, an iron
  efflux pump coupled with HEPH or CP, two proteins with ferroxidase activity, to
  maintain iron homeostasis. FPN activity is decreased by hepcidin that directly binds
  to it. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-17 upregulate the NF-κB
  pathway while IL-6 acts on STAT3 pathway. Macrophages are major actors for iron
  metabolism, exportation, and storage in the tumor microenvironment. They can supply
  iron to support tumor growth by multiple transport pathways. Activated macrophages
  sequester iron through TF via TFR1 or through NTBI via ZIP8/14 transporters. Furthermore,
  hemopexin-heme and haptoglobin-hemoglobin, whose uptake is mediated by the interaction
  with CD91 and CD163, respectively, are consumed into endosomes. The iron-binding
  glycoprotein Lactoferrin colocalizes with LCN2, which, in turn, sequesters iron
  in the extracellular space and stabilize MMP-, thus promoting cell survival and
  EMT. FtH can be accumulated in circulating T cells preserving immune functions.
  Moreover, T cells can secret cytokines like TNF-α and IFN-γ, which increase DMT1
  and decrease FPN level, resulting in increased iron retention. Abbreviations used:
  TFR-1, transferrin receptor; TF, transferrin; DMT1, divalent Metal (Ion) transporter
