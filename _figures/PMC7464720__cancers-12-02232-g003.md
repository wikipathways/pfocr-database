caption: RyR-mediated Ca2+signaling in ovarian physiology and cancer. RyR1 expression
  was not evidenced in either non-pregnant and pregnant myometrium nor in cultured
  myometrial cells. Meanwhile, RyR2 are expressed only in pregnant myometrium, and
  RyR3 are expressed both in non-pregnant and pregnant myometrium. Cultured myometrial
  cells express only RyR3, and TGF-β treatment upregulates both RyR2 and RyR3. Distinct
  subcellular expression of RyR subtypes was evidenced []. Persistent depletion of
  the ER Ca2+ deposits promotes apoptosis (+), while RyR inhibits (−) apoptotic cell
  death []. In ovarian cancer, RyR may contribute to the reduction of cancer progression
  by modulating the FAK//CREB/TNNC1 signaling pathway [] and may modulate the ERα–PLCγ–IP3R
  pathway [] (red line).
