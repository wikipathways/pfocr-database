caption: Differential regulation of fibrogenic phospho-Smad signaling between HSC
  during acute liver injury and MFB during chronic liver injury. (A) Phospho-Smad
  signaling involved in tissue repair. TGF-β inhibits HSC growth by down-regulating
  c-Myc expression by pSmad2C and pSmad3C pathways (left); TGF-β signaling in turn
  enhances HSC growth and collagen synthesis via the CDK4-dependent pSmad2L/C and
  pSmad3L/C pathways induced by PDGF signal (right). However, Smad7 induced by pSmad3L/C
  signal terminates the fibrogenic phospho-Smad signaling. This negative-feedback
  mechanism of the fibrogenic TGF-β/PDGF signal results in a transient collagen synthesis
  in the activated HSC, which may thus contribute to tissue repair. (B) Phospho-Smad
  signaling involved in fibrogenesis. In MFB, PDGF activates JNK, which phosphorylates
  Smad2L and Smad3L (left). The JNK-mediated Smad3L phosphorylation leads to hetero-complex
  of Smad3 with Smad4 in the nucleus where the complex stimulates MFB growth by upregulation
  of c-Myc transcription. After COOH-tail phosphorylation of cytoplasmic pSmad2L by
  TGF-β signal, pSmad2L/C translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the pSmad3L
  and Smad4 complex, which then stimulates plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1
  transcription (right). In contrast of Smad7 induction in HSC via pSmad3C pathway,
  pSmad3L cannot induce Smad7 in MFB (left). Under a low level of Smad7, the fibrogenic
  phospho-Smad signaling can constitutively promote ECM deposition by MFB, which may
  eventually develop into accelerated liver fibrosis.
