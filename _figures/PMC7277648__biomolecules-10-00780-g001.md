caption: 'Anti-aging mechanisms of metformin: From metabolic controller of longevity
  to the sentinel of epigenetic information. (A) The insulin/insulin-like growth factor
  1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway has prominent aging-modulating effects, which are coupled
  with the activation status of central nutrient sensors such as sirtuins, AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK), and mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR); the ability of
  metformin to block the insulin/IGF1 signaling while promoting proficient nutrient-sensing
  pathways (e.g., by activating Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and AMPK while suppressing mTOR)
  can promote organismal metabolic fitness to suppress aging-associated diseases.
  (B) Chromatin-modifying enzymes that catalyze aging-accompanying epigenetic alterations
  utilizes substrates and cofactors generated by intermediate metabolism; the ability
  of metformin to regulate the abundance of epimetabolites and/or the activation status
  of certain epigenetic writers and erasers can directly impact the link between metabolism
  and the epigenetic control of aging. (C) In the context of a reformulated Waddington’s
  landscape that incorporates the information-theoretic nature of the epigenome [,,,],
  the ultimate anti-aging mechanism of metformin might involve the global preservation
  of the epigenome architecture, thereby ensuring cell fate commitment and phenotypic
  outcomes despite the challenging effects of aging noise.'
