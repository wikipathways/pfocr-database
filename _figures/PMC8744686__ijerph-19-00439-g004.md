caption: 'Hypothetic scheme for both RAGE-dependent and RAGE-independent cellular
  signaling pathways. The AGE-RAGE-dependent signaling pathways activate various cellular
  downstream pathways including the NADPH–NF–κB axis and the Ras–MAPK axis, which
  result in inflammatory reactions []. The Ras–ERK1/2 axis is also involved in the
  inflammatory reactions. The Ras-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) axis is associated
  with apoptotic cell death. The RAGE-independent pathway is involved in the BM thickening
  by disturbing the ECM protein turn-over rate [,]. The AGEs upregulate the CCAAT-enhancer-binding
  protein homologous protein (CHOP) levels and induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related
  cell death in retinal pericytes []. In addition, AGEs, and Amadori products become
  the source of the ROS. Raf: rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; Rac1: PAS-related
  C3 botulinus toxin substrate 1; MEK1/2: MAPK ERK kinase 1/2; MKK4/7: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 4/7; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; PERK: protein kinase-like
  ER eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha kinase; IRE1: inositol-requiring ER-to-nucleus
