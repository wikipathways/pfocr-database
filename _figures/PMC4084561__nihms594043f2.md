caption: On engagement, the interferon-α receptor (IFNAR, which is composed of the
  IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits) activates Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase
  2 (TYK2). Phosphorylation of the receptor by these kinases results in the recruitment
  of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, phosphorylation,
  dimerization and nuclear translocation. The three predominant STAT complexes that
  are formed in response to type I interferon (IFN) control distinct gene-expression
  programmes. The interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex (which is composed
  of STAT1, STAT2 and IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9)) binds to IFN-stimulated response
  element (ISRE) sequences to activate classical antiviral genes, whereas STAT1 homodimers
  bind to gamma-activated sequences (GASs) to induce pro-inflammatory genes. STAT3
  homodimers indirectly suppress pro-inflammatory gene expression, probably by the
  induction of as-yet-unknown transcriptional repressors. Type I IFN-activated STAT3
  is bound by the co-repressor complex SIN3 transcription regulator homologue A (SIN3A),
  which suppresses induction of direct STAT3 target genes by promoting de-acetylation
  of STAT3 and histones. Type I IFNs also activate STAT4 and can activate STAT5 and
  STAT6 in a context-dependent manner (not depicted). CXCL9, CXC-chemokine ligand
  9; MX1, IFN-induced GTP-binding protein Mx1; OAS, 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthase;
  P, phosphate.
