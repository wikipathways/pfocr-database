caption: Model of regulation of angiogenesis by the ancillary receptor endoglin. TGF-β
  can stimulate two distinct type I receptor/Smad signalling pathways with opposite
  effects in ECs. The TGF-β/ALK5 signalling pathway leads to inhibition of cell proliferation
  and migration, whereas the TGF-β/ALK1 pathway induces EC proliferation and migration.
  Endoglin, an accessory TGF-β receptor, highly expressed during angiogenesis, is
  essential for ALK1 signalling. In the absence of endoglin, the TGF-β/ALK5 signalling
  is predominant and maintains quiescent the endothelium. High endoglin expression
  stimulates the ALK1 pathway and indirectly inhibits ALK5 signalling, thus promoting
  the activation state of angiogenesis.

  description: Model of regulation of angiogenesis by the ancillary receptor endoglin.
    TGF-β can stimulate two distinct type I receptor/Smad signalling pathways with
    opposite effects in ECs. The TGF-β/ALK5 signalling pathway leads to inhibition
    of cell proliferation and migration, whereas the TGF-β/ALK1 pathway induces EC

    during angiogenesis, is essential for ALK1 signalling. In the absence of endoglin,
    the TGF-β/ALK5 signalling is predominant and maintains quiescent the endothelium.
    High endoglin expression stimulates the ALK1 pathway and indirectly inhibits ALK5
    signalling, thus promoting the activation state of angiogenesis.
