caption: Signal transduction pathway regulating seasonal reproduction in birds. Light
  information received by deep brain photoreceptors is transmitted to the pars tuberalis
  (PT) of the pituitary gland, a regulatory hub for seasonal reproduction. Long day-induced
  thyrotropin (TSH) in the PT acts on ependymal cells to induce a thyroid hormone-activating
  enzyme, DIO2. The bioactive thyroid hormone, T3 is converted by DIO2 from the prohormone,
  T4. T3 regulates seasonal morphological changes in GnRH nerve terminals and glial
  processes, thereby regulating or modulating GnRH secretion.
