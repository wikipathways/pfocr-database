caption: 'a Left: in a physiological condition, the membrane transporter LAT1 participates
  in the transport of methionine which reacts with ATP to produce SAM. SAM can in
  turn be used by PRC2 to induce trimethylation of H3K27, resulting in a PcG-mediated
  silencing of its targets genes. Lat1 expression depends on RXRα. Right: in cancer
  cells, Lat1 is overexpressed, enhancing SAM production and inducing H3K27 hypermethylation
  of the chromatin landscape. The Lat1 negative regulator, RXRα, is thus repressed
  resulting in a positive feedback loop whereby EAF2 transcriptional silencing dependent
  on PRC2 results in overexpression of HIF1, which can in turn stimulate Lat1 expression.
  Therefore, an excess of LAT1 at the cellular membrane increases the transport of
  BCAAs, thereby enhancing protein synthesis. b Controlling the immune system is of
  a major importance in cancer. Cancer cells use different mechanisms to do this.
  First, PRC1 is able to increase the transcriptional expression of CCL2, which will
  dampen Treg immune response. In addition, PRC2-mediated silencing of the MHC-I antigen
  processing pathway results in MHC-I absence at the cell membrane, concealing cancer
  cells from cytotoxic T cells. Finally, PCGF4 overexpression in cancer cells stimulates
  the expression of GATA2, which will inhibit MICA/B transcription and reduces its
  presence at the membrane. This prevents the recognition of cancer cells by NK cells.
  These mechanisms enhance the immunosuppressive response and inhibit the cytotoxic
  response that would otherwise kill the cancer cells. c Oncohistones are a new line
  of research, analyzing the effect of mutations on histone genes that could have
  an impact on tumorigenesis. H3K27M has a dominant negative effect on EZH2 catalytic
  activity. Left: in a wild-type condition, PRC2 is recruited to nucleation sites
  that present unmethylated CGIs. Trimethylation of H3K27 occurs and spreads around
  the nucleation site. The boundaries of Polycomb domains are decorated with H3K36me2.
  Right: in the presence of the H3K27M oncohistone, that represents 10% of all H3,
  an epigenetic remodeling occurs. The spreading of H3K27me3 is inhibited and active
  histone marks, such as H3K27ac, are present on the oncohistone. BCAAs, Branched-chain
