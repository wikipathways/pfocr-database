caption: Network of several major anabolic and catabolic pathways results in energy
  production as well as generates protein, lipids and nucleotide biosynthesis through
  glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and pentose phosphate pathway. These metabolic
  pathways exert control over signaling via regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  acetylation, and methylation. [PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
