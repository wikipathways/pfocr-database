caption: NAD+ can be synthesized de novo or salvaged from intermediates and small
  precursors such as NA, NAM and NR. Yeast cells also release and re-uptake these
  precursors. The de novo NAD+synthesis (left panel) is mediated by Bna2,7,4,5,1,6
  proteins leading to the production of NaMN. The NA/NAM salvage pathway (center panel)
  also produces NaMN, which is then converted to NaAD and NAD+ by Nma1/2 and Qns1,
  respectively. NR salvage (right panel) connects to the NA/NAM salvage pathway by
  Urh1, Pnp1 and Meu1. NR turns into NMN by Nrk1, which is then converted to NAD+
  by Nma1, Nma2 and Pof1. For clarity, this model centers on NA/NAM salvage (highlighted
  with bold black arrows) because standard growth media contain abundant NA. Arrows
  with dashed lines indicate the mechanisms of these pathways remain largely unclear.
