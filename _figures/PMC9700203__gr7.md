caption: A proposed model for ROS as a specific regulatory signal in the adaptation
  of D. cochinchinensis.An external wound leads to a burst of ROS. Excessive levels
  of ROS cause DNA damage. Most of the positively selected genes in the genome were
  enriched in DNA-repair pathways such as base excision repair, nucleotide excision
  repair, and mismatch repair; these processes play crucial roles in maintaining genomic
  integrity. ROS, as signaling molecules, also activate transcription factors, thus
  activating the flavonoid synthesis pathway to synthesize a large amount of flavonoids.
  Flavonoids are the main components of dragon’s blood and act as a defensive substance
  to resist further damage. In turn, flavonoids, together with enzymes in the ROS
  scavenging system, scavenge the excess ROS that have accumulated in vivo to maintain
  homeostasis.
