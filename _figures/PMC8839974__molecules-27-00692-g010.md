caption: Components-targets analysis highlighting the putative interactions between
  the extracts’ phytochemicals and bacterial proteins. (A) The KEGG analysis conducted
  on E. coli via the platform STITCH showed the potential influence of benzoic acid
  and coumaric acid on the bacterial pathways KEGG00360 (phenylalanine metabolism)
  and KEGG01220 (degradation of aromatic compounds). (B) The components-targets analysis
  conducted on T. rubrum showed putative interactions of quercetin, cinnamic acid,
  and benzoic with different dermatophytes enzymes, without identifying any discrete
  metabolic pathway affected by the aforementioned phytochemicals.
