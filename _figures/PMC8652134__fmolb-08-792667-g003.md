caption: Overview of potential therapeutic targets of Notch signal pathway in NAFLD.
  Summarize the recent critical advances evolving Notch signaling in the NAFLD. Intrahepatic
  lipid levels depend on the balance between lipid acquisition and disposal. Therefore,
  lipid accumulation is the result of uptake of fatty acids and de novo lipogenesis
  exceeding export as VLDL and oxidation of fatty acid, which is also a main pathophysiological
  change of NAFLD. The five potential pathways to intervene in NAFLD are focused on
  (1) hepatic lipid accumulation, (2) insulin resistance, (3) oxidative stress, (4)
  inflammation and fibrogenesis, and (5) autophagy (lipophagy) progression. Although
  several aspects of these functions remain to be fully understood, these findings
  offer an intriguing rationale for investigating Notch-based therapies in patients
  with NAFLD. Furthermore, the “hepatokines” secreted by hepatocytes may help reveal
  the complex molecular regulation in NAFLD. (NICD, Notch intracellular domain; FFAs,
  free fatty acids; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex one; FOXO1, factor
  forkhead box protein O1; G6PC, glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit; PCK1, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxy kinase; TGs, triglycerides; VLDL, very-low-density lipoprotein; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; PRDX6, peroxiredoxin 6; ECM, extracellular matrix; HSC, hepatic
  stellate cell; LSEC, liver sinusoids endothelial cell).
