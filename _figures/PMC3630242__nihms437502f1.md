caption: Leptin and adiponectin activate signaling components that integrate PI3K/Akt,
  RAS/MAPK, and pAMPK/mTor pathways. Green arrows indicate activation of target protein,
  while red lines indicate inhibitory effects. Leptin stimulation of the long receptor
  isoform leads to JAK2 phosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine
  residues 985 and 1138, which confer PI3K/Akt and STAT3 pathway activation. Leptin
  stimulation can be prevented with c-reactive peptide, soluble leptin receptor (Ob-Re)
  or leptin antagonists. Chronic stimulation leads to an increase in SOCS3 which negatively
  regulates leptin signaling by inhibiting JAK2 activities. Additionally, leptin receptor
  stimulation activates SHP2 leading to increased Ras/RAF/ERK signaling. Adiponectin
  receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and receptor 2 (AdipoR2) are preferentially stimulated by the
  globular (gAdn) and high molecular weight (HMW Adn) oligomers of adiponectin respectively,
  although both receptors respond with lower affinity to other adiponectin oligomers.
  Serum levels of adiponectin can be increased through thiazolidinediones or fenofibrates,
  while the receptor levels can be increased with rosiglitazone or exercise. Adiponectin
  receptors associate with adaptor protein APPL1 to activate AMPK and PPAR alpha.
  Adiponectin can antagonize leptin mediated proliferation through activation of phosphatase
  PTP1B, leading to inhibition of JAK2, dephosphorylation of STAT3, and dephosphorylation
  of ERK1/2; as well as phosphatase PP2A to decrease phosphor-Akt. Adiponectin also
  inhibits leptin action through increased AMPK inhibition on mTORC1 directly as well
  as indirectly through TSC2. Metformin additionally antagonizes leptin action through
  activation of AMPK. Adiponectin activation also leads to modulation of NFkB, TP53,
  eNOS, ACC, and ceramidase activity; yet direct antagonism of leptin through these
  mediators is unclear. Ultimate outcome for a particular pathway in cancer is highly
  dependent upon genetic integrity and deficiencies in key regulatory mediators will
  dictate which pathway will dominate.
