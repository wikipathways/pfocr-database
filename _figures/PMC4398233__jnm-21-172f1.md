caption: 'This figure illustrates the interactions between microbiome, gut and brain
  which modulate responses to visceral pain. These interactions occur at the level
  of the gastrointestinal mucosa, and via local neural, endocrine or immune activity,
  as well as by the production of factors transported through the circulatory system,
  like bacterial metabolites or hormones. Endocrine Factors: in germ free mice, chemical
  changes were associated with an exaggerated hypothalamic pituitary stress response,
  eg, elevation of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone. Immune Pathway:
  the intestinal microbiota secretes factors that alter the mucosal permeability and
  macrophage release of IL-10. Neural Pathway: while the visceral pain results from
  the activation of nociceptors in the abdominal viscera, the visceral nociceptive
  afferent fibers further project onto spinal nociceptive neurons located in the superficial
  laminae, the lateral neck of the dorsal horn and lamina X of spinal cord that convey
  information to supraspinal centers. Gut: the microbiota produces a large range of
  metabolites which include short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and a variety of neuroactive
  metabolites such as serotonin. It is hypothesized that hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide
  may be bacterial metabolites responsible for visceral hypersensitivity. For example,
  in mice, hydrogen sulfide directly triggers visceral nociceptive behavior through
  sensitization and activation of T-type channels in the primary afferents.'
