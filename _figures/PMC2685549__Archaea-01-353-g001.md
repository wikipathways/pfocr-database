  The hydrogenotrophic pathway can operate from               formate or H2/CO2, obtaining
  reducing               potential from formate or H2, respectively. The               aceticlastic
  pathway obtains electrons from the oxidation of CO               produced by the
  splitting of acetate. The methylotrophic pathway               can operate in two
  ways: (1) the methylated C-1 compound is a               source for a methyl group
  as well as electrons (one molecule               oxidized to CO2 provides electrons
  for three molecules               to be reduced to methane, dotted green arrows);
  and (2) the               methylated C-1 compound is reduced to methane using electrons
  from               H2. The names of the proteins studied here are               indicated
  on the pathway. For the synthesis of the cofactors,               mptH plays a role
  in the biosynthesis of               tetrahydrofolate of M. jannaschii, and               mptN
  is involved in the biosynthesis of               methanopterin. Both tetrahydrofolate
  and methanopterin are               intermediate C1 carriers in methanogenesis.
  The biosynthesis of               the coenzyme F420 rests on the cof enzymes               (cofC,
  cofD,               cofE, cofG and               cofH). The aks enzymes (aksA,               aksD,
  aksE and               aksF) participate in 2-oxoacid elongation steps               of
  coenzyme B9 biosynthesis, which partners with coenzyme M in the               final
  step of methanogenesis. This lastcoenzyme is the smallest               known organic
  cofactor, but an essential terminal methyl carrier               during methanogenesis
  and is produced by the com enzymes               (comA, comB,               comC,
  comD and               comE) ().'

    The hydrogenotrophic pathway can operate from               formate or H2/CO2,
