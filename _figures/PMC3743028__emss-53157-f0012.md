caption: In mice fed a high-salt diet, the WNK-OSR1/SPAK-NCC phosphorylation cascade
  is down-regulated through a low plasma aldosterone level (left panel). However,
  this newly-described insulin signaling pathway, which is independent of aldosterone,
  increases phosphorylation of Akt through PI3K and activates the WNK-OSR1/SPAK-NCC
  phosphorylation cascade. As a result, phosphorylation of NCC in hyperinsulinemic
  mice fed a high-salt diet is not down-regulated effectively (right panel).
