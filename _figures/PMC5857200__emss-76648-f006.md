caption: Replication-coupled dilution of H4K20me2 in nascent chromatin, together with
  concomitantly increased concentrations of unmethylated H4K20, which helps recruit
  components of the HDR machinery (), complement global HDR-promoting signaling events
  by providing a means to locally discriminate pre- from post-replicative chromatin
  throughout S phase. DSBs in unreplicated DNA are associated with a high density
  of H4K20me2, allowing high-affinity bivalent chromatin binding of 53BP1 and its
  downstream effectors to efficiently inhibit DNA end resection. In contrast, DSBs
  in replicated DNA are associated with a lower density of H4K20me2 (and higher density
  of H4K20me0) resulting in a reduced affinity of 53BP1, thus lowering the threshold
  for its displacement by the HR machinery.
