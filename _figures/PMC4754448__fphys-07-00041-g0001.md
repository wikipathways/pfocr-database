caption: Actin associated proteins regulate YAP activity. The transcriptional coactivator
  YAP shuttles into the nucleus, where it activates TEAD mediated gene expression.
  After phosphorylation by LATS1/2 kinase, YAP binds to 14-3-3 proteins, leading to
  its cytoplasmic retention and degradation. YAP activity is regulated by the actin
  cytoskeleton. Actin stress fibers connect to the lamin meshwork in the nucleus via
  the LINC-complex. Rho GPTases are regulated by GPCR signaling which in turn regulates
  actin dynamics and YAP activity (dashed lines). Actin-binding proteins, like angiomotin
  (AMOT) or neurofibromin 2 (NF2/Merlin) are also known to regulate YAP activity,
  either through LATS or by direct interaction with YAP. Akt, a key regulator of the
  IGF-1- mTor pathway also binds to actin stress fibers, crosstalks to the Hippo pathway
  by interacting with MST1/2 and by YAP induced expression of a microRNA (miR-29)
  which inhibits the inhibition of Akt by targeting PTEN.
