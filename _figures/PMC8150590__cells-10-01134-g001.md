caption: Schematic network of interactions between type I IFNs and IL-1β. Pathogens-
  or danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, DAMPs) interact with their cognate
  pattern recognition receptor (PRRs). In the example shown here, DNA binding and
  activation of the cGAS/STING pathway leads to type I interferons (IFNs) secretion,
  while monosodium urate (MSU) crystals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which induces
  IL-1β release. In most cases, both cytokines exert antagonistic activities, mutually
  repressing their expression levels by various mechanisms.
