caption: A model summarizing the three effects of ionizing radiation on MHC class
  I antigen presentation. The early effects are caused by the degradation of proteins
  that may be triggered or damaged by irradiation. Later effects are caused by activation
  of the mTOR pathway, which results in increased protein translation of proteins,
  and an increased generation of peptides from (the RDPs of) these new proteins. The
  increased peptide pool will enhance MHC class I assembly because peptides are the
  limiting factor. In addition, unique proteins will be expressed/up-regulated in
  response to ionizing radiation, resulting in novel peptides presented by MHC class
  I molecules.
