caption: 'MicroRNA biogenesis and introduction of exogenous RNAi triggers. Endogenous
  miRNAs are usually transcribed by RNA Pol II to produce primary miRNA transcripts
  (pri-miRNA). Pri-miRNAs are processed in the nucleus by the Drosha/DGCR8 complex
  to produce precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) that are subsequently exported to the cytoplasm
  (left panel). Cytoplasmic pre-miRNAs undergo further cleavage by Dicer, yielding
  a 22-nucleotide double-stranded RNA duplex that is incorporated into the RISC complex
  to mediate mRNA silencing. Exogenous RNAi triggers (right panel, in red) can mimic
  each of these stages: miR30-based shRNAs are incorporated into the pathway at the
  Drosha/DGCR8 processing step, stem loop shRNAs resemble pre-miRNAs and are exported
  to the cytoplasm, and synthetic siRNA duplexes mimic Dicer cleavage products.'
