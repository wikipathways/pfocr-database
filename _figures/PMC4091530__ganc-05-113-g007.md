caption: (A) SW48 cells are initially sensitive to GDC-0941. GDC-0941 resistance develops
  with autocrine (AREG/EGFR) signaling and activation of the MAPK pathway. Cells eventually
  lose PTEN protein as resistance develops. (B) Resistant cells must be maintained
  on GDC-0941 to prevent signaling flare. In the absence of GDC-0941, resistant cells
  signal strongly through the PI3K pathway.
