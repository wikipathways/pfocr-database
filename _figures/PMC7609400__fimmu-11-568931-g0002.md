caption: The extrinsic function of the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis in cancer. T cells
  play an important role in modulating immune responses against tumor cells, but tumors
  can exhibit immune inhibitory mechanisms like overexpressing PD-L1 to avoid T cell-mediated
  killing. (A) When PD-L1 binds to PD-1 expressed on the surface of T cells, T cells
  become inactivated through the recruitment of SHP1/2 which subsequently inhibits
  TCR and CD28 co-stimulatory signaling by preventing the phosphorylation of ZAP70
  and PI3K, leading to T cell anergy or apoptosis and ultimately immune evasion. (B)
  Monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis have been developed
  to restore immune-mediated eradication of the tumor. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade allows
  co-stimulatory signal transduction from the TCR and CD28 on T cells upon interaction
  with APCs or tumor cells. TCR binding to the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) in the
  MHC complex leads to the phosphorylation of ZAP70, which then phosphorylates P38
  and LAT resulting in activation of calcium-dependent and MAPK pathways. Simultaneously,
  CD80 binding to CD28 phosphorylates PI3K which activates PIP3 leading to AKT-mTOR
  pathway activation. These signaling pathways promote T cell activation, cytokine
  production and pro-survival factor expression stimulating anti-tumor immunity.
