caption: U2OS cells were treated with 50 μM of DMSO or TChal for 24 h. The RNA was
  isolated, and then RNA-Seq analysis was performed. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) software was applied to analyze the differential gene expression data. The
  p53 signaling pathway was activated by TChal, and the downstream effects of p53
  activation induced by TChal was determined using the tools available on the IPA.
