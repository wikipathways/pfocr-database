caption: 'HNF4α Depletion Mediated by p-STAT3 Signaling in Hepatocytes Drives Metabolic
  Disruption and HCC Progression: Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6,
  and TNF-α, secreted by macrophages and infiltrating T cells, activate the p-STAT3
  signaling pathway in hepatocytes. This activation downregulates HNF4α, a key regulator
  of liver metabolism and tumor suppression. ultimately contributing to HCC progression.
