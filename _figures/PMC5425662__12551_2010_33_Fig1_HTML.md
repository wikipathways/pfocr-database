caption: Schematic view of photosynthetic electron transport. Two thylakoid membranes
  and the luminal space between them are shown. Multiprotein complexes photosystem
  1 (PSI), photosystem 2 (PSII), and cytochrome bf (cyt bf) are embedded in the membrane.
  Mobile electron carrier protein plastocyanin (Pc) diffuses in the lumen. The arrows
  denote electron transport. The connection with the Calvin cycle is carried out by
  mobile carriers Fd or Fld via FNR. Inside the multienzyme complexes of PSI, PSII,
  and cyt bf complex, the electron follows the “electron pathway” via a fixed sequence
  of carriers in the multienzyme complexes
