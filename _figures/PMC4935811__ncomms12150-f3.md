caption: In cancer and chronic inflammation, the bone marrow and spleen increase the
  output of mature and immature myeloid cells that comprise a spectrum between monocytes
  and neutrophils. In mice, MDSC toward the monocytic end of the spectrum (M-MDSC)
  are CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G−, while towards the neutrophil end of the spectrum (PMN-MDSC)
  are CD11b+LyG+Ly6C−. Within solid tumours M-MDSC develop through intermediate steps
  towards macrophages where Ly6C is progressively downregulated and MHCII, F4/80 and
  CX3CR1 are upregulated. Under chronic inflammation, monocytic lineages show an increasing
  requirement for anti-apoptotic survival pathways (mediated primarily by GM-CSF signalling)
  to block the intrinsic mitochondrial death pathway. A similar scheme is likely to
  occur in humans; however, the cell markers are different.
