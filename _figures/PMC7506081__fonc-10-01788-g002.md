caption: Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBPs) mediate the uptake, efflux,
  and storage of cholesterol. (A) Extracellular cholesterol is carried by low density
  lipoprotein (LDL) and binds to LDL receptors (LDLR) on the cell surface. After binding,
  cholesterol is transported to the cells and decomposed by the lysosome into intracellular
  cholesterol. (B) Intracellular cholesterol binds to the sterol transporter ATP binding
  cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1)/ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1
  (ABCG1) and is transferred to the extracellular space to complete the uptake and
  discharge of cholesterol. miR-33 which is embedded in introns of, and co-transcribed
  with SREBPs can inhibit the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1, thus inhibiting the reversal
  of cholesterol. (C) Excess cholesterol in the cells binds to SREBP-mediated fatty
  acids and esterifies them into cholesterol esters to avoid the negative regulation
  of cholesterol. These measures provide a large amount of energy and nutrients and
  protection for tumor cell proliferation.
