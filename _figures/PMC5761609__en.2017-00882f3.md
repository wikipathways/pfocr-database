caption: Activation signals of inflammasomes. Signal 1 is provided by ligands of other
  pattern recognition receptors like TLR4, which, upon binding to exogenous pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns like LPSs, activates the downstream NFκB signaling pathway. NFκB
  translocates to the nucleus and induces expression of NLRP3 as well as other proinflammatory
  cytokines. Signal 2 includes organelle dysfunction (e.g., loss of plasma membrane
  integrity, lysosome rupture, mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS production, or autophagy
  induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress), invasion of microbial products (e.g.,
  microbial protein, DNA), and perturbed homeostatic set points of cellular processes
  (e.g., aberrations in metabolites or influx of ions). Once assembled, the inflammasomes
  activate caspase-1, which subsequently cleaves the proinflammatory IL-1 family of
  cytokines into their bioactive forms, leading to pyroptosis. ASC, apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  NLRP3, NOD-like receptor protein 3; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
