caption: Key molecular pathways in collecting lymphatic vessel contractile activity
  under physiological and obesity/metabolic syndrome conditions. In normal physiological
  conditions, lymphatic contraction is critical for lymph flow modulation and regulated
  by intracellular Ca2+ in LMCs, NO from LECs, LMC membrane potential, and LEC VEGFR3
  signaling. Ca2+ homeostasis is critical for lymphatic pump regulation and SERCA2a
  mediates intracellular Ca2+ by up taking intracellular Ca2+ back to SR. Intracellular
  Ca2+ stimulates MLCK and induces MLC20 phosphorylation, a critical lymphatic contractile
  regulatory protein. Flow-mediated NO from eNOS is an important lusitropic mediator
  in lymphatic contraction. VEGFR3 signaling via LECs might be a critical molecular
  signal that controls lymphatic contractility by directly impacting LMCs or indirectly
  mediating eNOS. K+ permeability is critical for resting membrane potential regulation
  that governs lymphatic muscle excitability and contractile activity. KATP channels
  mediate lymphatic contractility by negatively regulating electrical excitability.
  In metabolic syndrome, SERCA2a expression and activity are diminished that disturbing
  intracellular Ca2+ homeostatic resulting impairs lymphatic phasic contractions.
  Elevated intracellular Ca2+ promotes MLC20 phosphorylation via MLCK. Metabolic syndrome
  diminishes NO bioavailability by impairing LECs PI3K/AKT pathway. Decreased NO contributes
  to constricted vessels and impairs lymphatic contraction and lymph flow. VEGFR3
  signaling pathways might be diminished in obese LECs that reduces lymphatic contraction
  directly impacting LMCs or indirectly via NO mediation. KATP channels are hyperactivated
  results in hyperpolarization of LMCs. The hyperpolarization by active KATP channels
  inhibits action potential generation in LMCs resulting in lymphatic contractile
  dysfunction in obesity. Generated with BioRender.com (Toronto, ON, Canada).
