caption: DEGs mapped to the plant hormone signaling transduction pathways in the leaves
  of S. argel plants under salt stress conditions. (A) Auxin signaling pathway, (B)
  gibberellin signaling pathway, (C) ABA signaling pathway, (D) salicylate signaling
  pathway, and (E) ethylene signaling pathway. The red box r indicates up-regulated
  pathway compared with the control. At the same time, the green box indicates down-regulated
  pathway compared with the control. The fold change (FC) and P-value ≤ 0.05 are shown
  in .
