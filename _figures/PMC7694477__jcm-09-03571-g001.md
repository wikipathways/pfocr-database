caption: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and the transforming growth factor
  beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Heterodimers of bone morphogenetic
  protein 9 (BMP9) and BMP10, among other members of the TGF-β family, bind to an
  endothelial cell surface receptor complex composed by the type I (R-I) receptor
  named ALK1 and the type II (R-II; BMPR2, ActR2A, ActR2B) receptor, both serine/threonine
  kinases, as well as the auxiliary receptor endoglin. The heterodimeric association
  between different R-I and R-II determines the specificity of the ligand signaling.
  Upon ligand binding, the R-II transphosphorylates ALK1, which subsequently propagates
  the signal by phosphorylating the receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) family of proteins,
  Smad1/5/8. Once phosphorylated (P-), R-Smads form heteromeric complexes with a cooperating
  homologue named Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate the
  transcriptional activity of different target genes, in turn modulating endothelial
  cell function. The involvement of other components of the TGF-β pathway has been
  omitted for simplification []. BMP9, Endoglin, ALK1, and Smad4 proteins are encoded
  by GDF2, ENG, ACVRL1, and MADH4 genes, whose pathogenic mutations give rise to HHT5,
  HHT1, HHT2, and JPHT, respectively. BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; GTM, general
  transcription machinery. Adapted from Ruiz-Llorente et al. [].
