caption: Scheme of appoptosin-mediated apoptotic pathway in neurodegeneration. Appoptosin
  is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then transported to the mitochondria. A part
  of appoptosin can interact with APP and thus is retained in the cytoplasm. Appoptosin
  mediates transport of δ-ALA across the mitochondria membrane for heme synthesis.
  Upon neurotoxic insults, the levels of appoptosin are increased for more heme synthesis.
  Excessive heme, especially free heme, causes overproduction of ROS and cell toxicity
  and apoptosis, finally leading to neurodegeneration.
