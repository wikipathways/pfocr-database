caption: 'Routes of coronaviruses infection. Coronavirus entry routes into the central
  nervous system (CNS). ➀ Olfactory pathway: Coronaviruses enter from the mouth and
  bind to the surface receptors of the olfactory nerve. It is transmitted by the olfactory
  nerve to the olfactory bulb and thence to the nerve center. ➁ Receptor binding:
  Coronaviruses bind to the host cell receptors by the surface proteins with the assistance
  of TMPRSS2. On the one hand, coronaviruses enter the host cells through endocytosis
  and use Cat L to clear S2. Thus coronaviruses can use plasma membrane fusion so
  that nucleic acid is released. On the other hand, coronaviruses fuse with the host
  cell membrane through the viral outer membrane, allowing the nucleic acid to enter
  the host cell. ➂ Trojan horse mechanism: Coronavirus-mediated cytokine storm. After
  attachment and entry into the epithelial cells through the ACE-2 receptor, the virus
  may activate the pro-inflammatory pathway through NF-κB signaling, followed by the
  formation of an inflammasome. Various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  are released, including CCL-2, CCL-4, and CXCL-10. These proteins attract different
  immune cells in the circulation, like the monocytes, macrophages, and T cells at
  the site of infection. Additionally, the T lymphocytes release substances (e.g.,
  TNF-β, IL-6, IL-4, IL-12, and IL-23) that in turn affect macrophages and accumulate
  in the body, creating a pro-inflammatory feedback loop. These cytokines may damage
  the BBB and activate astrocytes and microglia. In response, the activated microglia
  and astrocytes produce IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8. Elevated levels of these inflammatory
  cytokines can impart neurotoxic effects leading. ➃ Neurons retrograde: After infection
  of peripheral neurons, coronaviruses spread through retro-transsynaptic neurons
  (from postsynaptic neurons to presynaptic neurons in reverse), and infect synaptic
  connected central neurons or other peripheral neuron cell bodies. The solid line
  shows the process of virus infection, and the dashed line shows the possible route
  of virus infection.'
