caption: AQ-dependent quorum-sensing pathway in P. aeruginosa—transformation of HHQ
  to PQS. Action of the PqsABCD proteins result in HHQ, which is converted to PQS
  by PqsH. Autoinduction occurs when either HHQ or PQS binds to PqsR and amplifies
  the expression of the pqsABCDE operon. PqsE is a putative metallohydrolase of unsettled
  enzymatic function targeting multiple downstream genes; its target appears to be
  the function of RhlR. Later studies have revealed the role of PqsE in HHQ biosynthesis.
  PqsE acts as thioesterase, hydrolyzing the biosynthetic intermediate 2-aminobenzoylacetyl-coenzyme
  A to form 2-aminobenzoylacetate, the precursor of HHQ []. PQS has additional functionalities
  as a potent iron chelator, which induces expression of the P. aeruginosa siderophores
  (pyoverdine and pyochelin). Filled arrows represent positive regulation, whereas
  blunted lines represent negative regulation []. AQ—alkyl quinolone, HHQ—2-heptyl-4-quinolone,
  PQS—Pseudomonas quinolone signal. Figure reproduced from Ilangovan et al., 2013
