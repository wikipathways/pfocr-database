caption: Major double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways in human cells. DSBs in G1
  of the cell cycle are primarily repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (Top).
  This pathway is initiated by the Ku heterodimer, which recognizes broken DNA. NHEJ
  leads to repair with minimal alteration to the original sequence. DSBs in S/G2 phases
  are subjected to resection leading to stretches of single-stranded DNA. Resected
  DSBs are substrates for homologous recombination (HR) with a critical role of Rad51
  leading to an accurate repair synthesis. When HR is defective (for example when
  BRCA genes are mutated), an alternative pathway named Pol theta-mediated end-joining
  (TMEJ) can act as a back-up repair pathway. Polθ promotes the synapsis of the opposing
  ends, identifies internal microhomologies, which can be annealed, and performs a
  repair DNA synthesis with poor processivity and frequent aborted synthesis, resulting
  in a high rate of mutations. Single-strand annealing (SSA) is a HR sub-pathway in
  mammalian cells with the essential role of RAD52 DNA-binding protein. SSA is an
  error-prone repair leading to large deletions between the homologous repeats.
