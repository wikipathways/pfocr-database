caption: On the basis of this study and outside literature, a multi-step model for
  tumor development is proposed in WS patients and other human cell types with reduced
  functionalities of WRN. We speculate that either complete or partial loss of function
  of WRN can lead to both increased genomic instability and an increase of somatic
  mutation rate, which in turn can result in an increased susceptibility for the gain
  or loss of functions of other genes. The functional loss of WRN in combination with
  a deficiency in other key regulators of the cell cycle or DNA damage repair pathway
  may result in an accelerated conversion from pre-cancerous to cancerous cell line,
  thus allowing for rapid progression of tumorigenesis and cancer formation in WS
  patients and other diseases related to WRN deficiency.
