caption: Chronic production of inflammatory mediators by microglial cells, particularly
  the generation of ROS and NO by activated microglia, mediates the majority of DA-neuronal
  degeneration and cell death. As resident brain macrophages, microglia continually
  survey the surrounding tissue where they remain in an inactive, quiescent state
  under tight regulation such as by the interaction of cell-surface molecules CD200
  (expressed on neurons) and CD200R receptor on the microglia. Microglia become activated
  when they encounter extracellular triggers such as those from the pathogens, structurally
  or genetically altered proteins, toxins, and dead or dying neuronal cells. Activated
  microglia generate a strong proinflammatory response including the production of
  inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β) and an oxidative stress response.
  Most notably, the activity of the oxidative-stress enzyme, NADPH oxidase, appears
  to play a central role in the pathology of DA-neuron death and the progression of
  PD. This oxidative stress response occurs in microglia through the activation of
  the ERK signaling pathway by proinflammatory stimuli, leading to the phosphorylation
  and translocation of the p47phox and p67phox cytosolic subunits, the activation
  of membrane-bound PHOX, and the production of ROS. Therapeutic anti-inflammatories
  which prevent DA neurodegeneration in PD models, including anti-inflammatory cytokines,
  morphinan compounds, NADPH oxidase inhibitors, NF-κB inhibitors, and β2-AR agonists,
  all function to inhibit the activation of the PHOX complex and ROS production in
  microglial cells.
