caption: Several types of TG2-containing adhesive / signaling complexes present on
  the cell surface. Solid black lines indicate TG2-mediated activation of cytoplasmic
  targets by transmembrane signaling receptors. Dotted black line marks binding of
  activated PKCα to the integrin cytoplasmic tails, which causes their redistribution
  on the cell surface. Red dashed line outlines the activation of syndecan-2 by intracellular
  PKCα, and green dashed line - syndecan-2-mediated activation of ROCK, which induces
  stress fiber and focal adhesion formation. Blue dashed line marks nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin which leads to its complex formation with Tcf/Lef and activation of
  gene transcription. Curved black line indicates the principal pathway of surface
  TG2 internalization.
