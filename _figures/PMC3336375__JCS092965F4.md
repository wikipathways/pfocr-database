caption: Model for the regulation of Torso- and EGFR-dependent responses in the Drosophila
  blastoderm embryo. Both RTK pathways are activated almost simultaneously but in
  different spatial domains, marked with grey (Torso) and blue (EGFR). In each case,
  Ras-MAPK signaling induces the expression of specific genes, such as hkb (Torso)
  or ind (EGFR). Both responses depend on CIC activity – CIC represses hkb and ind
  expression outside of their normal domains, whereas the RTK signals counteract CIC
  repression and allow activation by different factors. One direct activator of ind
  is Dorsal (DL) (; ), whereas hkb expression possibly requires the binding of BCD
  and LILLI activators to its enhancer (; ). The combination of CIC derepression and
  distinct activation inputs regulates specific hkb and ind expression downstream
  of each pathway. Note, however, that EGFR signaling might also have a direct positive
  input on ind expression (dashed arrow affecting a hypothetical factor X), as seen
  for mirr and argos regulation. Patterns of lacZ expression directed by hkb and ind
  enhancers are shown below (; ). Parts of this figure have been modified with permission
