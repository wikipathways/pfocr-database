caption: 'Two signal model of NLRP3 activation. There is two-step process involved
  in activation of NLRP3 inflammasome: Priming (signal 1, left) and Activation (signal
  2, right). The priming is mediated by PAMPs/DAMPs recognized by TLRs, leading to
  the transcriptional upregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome components including NLRP3
  itself, pro-IL-1β, Pro-IL-18 and Pycard via an NF-κB-dependent pathway. Caspase-8,
  FADD and IKK complex are also involved in priming via the regulation of NF-κB activation
  pathway. Additionally, posttranslational modification can activate NLRP3 inflammasome
  components by JNK1 and BRCC3. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome can be triggered
  by numerous stimuli, such as particulates and crystals, which alter cellular ionic
  flux and organellar disturbances including ion flux (K+, Cl−, and Ca2+), mitochondrial
  ROS production, mtDNA, oxidized mitochondrial DNA (Ox-mtDNA) and lysosomal damage.
  Viral RNA mediates NLRP3 activation via a complex of MAVS and MFN2. Subsequent to
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-1β and IL-18 secretion occur.'
