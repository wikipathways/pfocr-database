caption: BAs play central roles in orchestrating lipid and glucose metabolism. BAs
  are important metabolic regulators of lipids and glucose via targeting FXR and other
  nuclear receptors. BAs activate hepatic FXR–SHP pathway, preventing hepatic triglyceride
  (TG) accumulation via inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis by interfering with the promoters
  (carbohydrate response elements, ChOREs) of glucose-regulated genes and SREBP-1C.
  SREBP-1C induces acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl
  CoA desaturase (SCD). In addition, FXR-SHP pathway acts on de novo cholesterol synthesis
  by inhibiting SREBP-2. FXR activation regulates cholesterol uptake by inhibiting
  PCSK9; alleviates the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and TG secretion by repressing
  the expression of microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP); induces phospholipid transfer
  protein (PLTP) and angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3); promotes FA β-oxidation
  though engaging PPARα. Intestinal FXR activation leads to FGF15/19 secretion and
  thereby inhibiting expression of NPC1-like intracellular cholesterol transporter
  1 (NPC1L1) in intestine and cholesterol absorption. In addition, FXR induces ApoE
  but suppresses hepatic ApoC-III expression and thus inhibiting lipoprotein lipase
  (LPL). For glucose metabolism, BA–FXR signaling inhibits gluconeogenesis and promotes
  glycogen synthesis by negative regulation of G6Pase and carbohydrate responsive
  element-binding protein (ChREBP). In intestinal L cells, BA–TGR5 signaling leads
  to GLP-1 expression and secretion, whereas BA–FXR signaling inhibits GLP-1 production.
  Activation of TGR5 in brown adipocytes positively regulates cAMP–D2 signaling pathway,
  promoting mitochondrial fission and beige remodeling of white adipose tissue as
  well as provoking FFAs release. FXR in β cell stimulates insulin secretion via KATP
  channel inhibition. TGR5 activation augmented a hyperglycemia-induced switch from
  glucagon to GLP-1 synthesis in islet α cells by GS/cAMP/PKA/cAMP-response element-binding
  protein-dependent activation of polycystin-1 (PC1) to promote glucose homeostasis.
