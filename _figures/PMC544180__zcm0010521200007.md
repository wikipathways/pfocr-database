caption: Proposed mechanism of Claisen-type condensation for the synthesis of α-mycolic
  acid by Pks13 in M. tuberculosis. FadD32 converts the α-meroacyl-S-ACP derived from
  the FAS-II system to α-meroacyl-AMP. The hexacosanoyl-S-CoA derived from FAS-I is
  carboxylated by acyl-CoA carboxylases (AccD4 and AccD5) to yield 2-carboxyl-C26-S-CoA.
  These two products are the substrates for the condensation reaction catalyzed by
  Pks13. Reaction 1 is the loading step in which the two substrates are covalently
  attached to Pks13. Reaction 2 is the transfer of a meroacyl group from the N-terminal
  PPB domain to the condensing enzyme (KS). Reactions 3 and 4 together are the condensation
  step and reduction of the 3-oxo group to the secondary alcohol by an unidentified
  reductase to yield the mature α-mycolate. Domains of Psk13 are the two nonequivalent
  PPB domains (signature motif of ACP), KS domain, AT domain, and TE domain.
