caption: 'The role of periostin inthe pathogenic process of subepithelial fibrosis.
  Briefly, Th2-polarized inflammation leads to the recruitment of various immune cells
  and these secrete IL-4 and IL-13 in combination with TGF-β to stimulate fibroblasts
  and epithelial cells to produce periostin. Periostin, in turn through an autocrine
  pathway (indicated with green colored receptors), acts on fibroblasts and epithelial
  cells, thereby leading to a vicious cycle. Additional functions of periostin include:
  the promotion of fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts, the induction of
  fibroblast migration, and as a co-factor of TGF-β, periostin promotes ECM production
  and the differentiation of myofibroblasts. Periostin further enhances fibrosis by
  binding to other ECM proteins (e.g., collagen I, fibronectin, and tenascin-C) and
  by inducing collagen fibrillogenesis. Adapted from []'
