caption: Multifaceted antitumour mechanisms of Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) in
  liver cancer. This figure illustrates the diverse mechanisms through which APS exert
  antitumour effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). APS inhibit tumour proliferation
  by downregulating cyclin D1 and p53 and upregulating p21, leading to cell cycle
  arrest. They promote apoptosis via mitochondrial pathways, characterised by increased
  Bax, cytochrome c, and caspase-3 levels and reduced Bcl-2 expression. APS also suppress
  the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis by upregulating E-cadherin
  and downregulating mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin, vimentin, and TGF-β.
  Immunomodulatory effects include activation of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK)
  cells, increased secretion of IL-2 and IFN-γ, and reduced Treg activity. Furthermore,
  APS remodel the tumour microenvironment (TME) by repolarising TAMs from the protumour
  M2 phenotype to the antitumour M1 phenotype and downregulating angiogenic factors
  such as VEGF and HIF-1α. Together, these mechanisms position APS as promising multifunctional
  agents for integrative liver cancer therapy
