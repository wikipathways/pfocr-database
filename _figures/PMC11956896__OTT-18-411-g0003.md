caption: Mechanisms of the regulatory effects of PCSK9 in T cells and tumor cells.
  The binding of PCSK9 to LDLR impedes the recycling of LDLR and TCR back to the plasma
  membrane, consequently suppressing the effector function of cytotoxic T cells. By
  physically associating with MHC-I, PCSK9 instigates lysosomal degradation within
  tumor cells, which in turn diminishes the surface presentation of MHC-I, thereby
  facilitating tumor immune evasion. Moreover, PCSK9 triggers an increase in intracellular
  cholesterol levels, culminating in lipid accumulation within macrophages. PCSK9
  modulates the activation of cytotoxic T cells via MAPK-mediated activation of NFATc1.
  Certain treatments can prevent T-cell apoptosis and promote T-cell survival through
  the PI3K/Akt pathway. Conversely, PCSK9 can promote apoptosis by inhibiting the
  PI3K/Akt pathway. PCSK9 drives Th cell differentiation by activating the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. Additionally, PCSK9 augments vascular inflammation and promotes Th cell
  differentiation by upregulating or activating the TLR-4/NF-κB pathway. Finally,
  PCSK9 facilitates the expansion of Tregs through the JAK/STAT pathway
