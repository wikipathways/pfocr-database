caption: The interplay between host and bacterial factors leads to tissue destruction,
  vascular leakage, and hyperinflammation in invasive GAS disease. Plasminogen is
  recruited to the GAS cell surface directly (PAM/Prp, SEN, and GAPDH) or indirectly
  (fibrinogen receptors). Activation of plasminogen is mediated by bacterial (Ska)
  or host (uPA/tPA) plasminogen activators. Subsequent plasmin activity contributes
  to fibrin degradation, tissue destruction, and vascular leakage. Complexes of soluble
  M protein and fibrinogen cross-link to β2-integrins on the neutrophil surface, triggering
  the release of proinflammatory mediators. Soluble M protein fragments also mediate
  the activation of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation by triggering tissue factor
  synthesis and platelet aggregation. Contact activation at the GAS cell surface (M
  protein, fibrinogen, and kininogen) leads to the formation of a fibrin network and
  bradykinin generation, contributing to vascular leakage. The secreted toxins SLO
  and SLS trigger apoptosis of host cells, leading to tissue destruction. SLO also
  mediates neutrophil platelet aggregation. Secreted superantigens (Sags, Spes, and
  SmeZ) bind to the beta-chain of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and CD4+ T cells,
  triggering the release of proinflammatory mediators and overstimulation of the immune
  response.
