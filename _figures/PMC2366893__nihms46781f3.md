caption: Overview of iron homeostasis. Iron is oxidized (Fe3+) in the intestinal lumen
  and in the serum, but is reduced (Fe2+) before transport into cells. Iron (Fe2+)
  is transported into ENTEROCYTES by DMT1 after extracellular reduction perhaps by
  DCytb. Iron uptake by visceral ENDODERM cells is apparently not dependent on DMT1
  and could require the transferrin uptake system. Iron is transported out of cells
  by Ferroportin and is thought to be subsequently oxidized (Fe3+) by membrane bound
  Hephaestin and Ceruloplasmin. Iron, inflammation and hypoxia regulate Hepcidin,
  a polypeptide hormone made by the HEPATOCYTE. Hepcidin binds to Ferroportin resulting
  in degradation of the transporter. In the serum, Fe3+ binds to Transferrin. Developing
  ERYTHROBLASTS (heme is the major pool of iron) and many other cell types take up
  iron via the transferrin-mediated endocytic pathway (see GENERIC CELL). After binding
  to the transferrin receptor, the iron–transferrin complex is internalized and iron
  is released from transferrin in the acidified endosome, reduced by a Steap metalloreductase
  and then transported into the cytoplasm by DMT1. Apo-transferrin and the transferrin
  receptor are returned to circulation and plasma membrane, respectively, via the
  recycling endosome pathway. All nonerythroid cells store iron complexed with the
  ferritin heavy and light chains (Ferritin) which can store up to 4,000 atoms of
  iron per molecule. Cytoplasmic iron is transported into mitochondria by mitoferrin
  where it is loaded into Fe-S clusters in a process that requires Frataxin. A substrate
  essential for Fe-S assembly in the cytoplasm is transported out of the mitochondria
  by the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB7 (see GENERIC CELL). In the erythroblast,
  mitochondrial iron is primarily utilized for heme synthesis. A major fraction of
  iron is recycled by the reticulo-endothelial MACROPHAGE which phagocytoses aged
  red blood cells (RBC). The iron is solubilized in the lysosomes, reduced by a Steap
  metalloreductase and exported out of the lysosome by NRAMP1. Iron is released from
  the macrophage by ferroportin, subsequently reoxidized by Ceruloplasmin, and conveyed
  again via transferrin through the systemic circulation.
