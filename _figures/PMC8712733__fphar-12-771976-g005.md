caption: IsA protects against HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by regulating BA metabolism.
  Red and blue arrows indicate upregulation and downregulation after IsA treatment,
  respectively. This effect potentially involves (1) induced hepatic alternative BA
  synthetic pathway to increase cholesterol consumption, (2) accelerated BA efflux
  and suppressed BA uptake in the liver by regulating BSEP and NTCP, and (3) increased
  BSH-containing gut bacteria to increase fecal BA excretion.
