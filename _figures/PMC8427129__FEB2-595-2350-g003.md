caption: 'Summary of main metabolic changes in SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected Huh7 cells at 72 hpi.
  The mitochondrial ETC and oxidative phosphorylation are downregulated, reducing
  ATP production from the TCA cycle but potentially providing protection from apoptosis.
  The components of the TCA producing intermediates for viral amino acid synthesis
  are upregulated. While the production of ATP is reduced in the TCA, the energy‐producing
  reactions of glycolysis are upregulated, producing ATP for the viral production
  of amino acids and RNA. Fatty acid synthesis is also upregulated, producing fatty
  acids for the synthesis of the viral envelope. The production of anti‐inflammatory
  polyunsaturated fatty acids and the electron transport chain are both downregulated.
  Upregulation of inflammatory proteins IP10, eotaxin, MIP‐1β and IL‐6 has been linked
