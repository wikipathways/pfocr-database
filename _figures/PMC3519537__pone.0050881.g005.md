caption: (A) The link between the inactivated S6K and activated CHICO is found in
  several sub-paths in the lnK and the InR mutant and is suggested to act as a secondary
  effect, reducing lifespan by FOXO inhibition. (B) Another commonly found link in
  several sub-paths of Lnk and InR and some paths of chico is the activation of AKT1
  by TOR-C2, suggesting a secondary effect and a crosstalk between TOR and IIS pathways.
  (C) The link of L inactivating TOR-C1 by inhibition is found in both Lnk and InR,
  as well some paths of chico. In the InR experiment L appears to be up-regulated,
  further supporting a possible secondary effect on longevity through TOR-C2 and AKT1.
  (D) Another route to AKT1 activation by TOR-C2 activation, also found in both InR
  and Lnk sub-paths, as well as some paths of chico, involved the inactivation of
  RHEB by the TSC1 and TSC2 complex.
