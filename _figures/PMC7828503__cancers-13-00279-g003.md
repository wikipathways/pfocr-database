caption: Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family receptor (SLAMF) 3 signal
  transduction is mediated via self-ligation and cell–cell interactions. (A) SLAMF3
  recruits SAP at two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) domains, and
  the SLAM–SAP–Fyn signaling pathway promotes T cell activation. (B) On multiple myeloma
  (MM) cells, SLAMF3 activates the ERK signal transduction pathway. This function
  is mediated via self-ligand interactions between MM cells and SHP2 and GRB2 formation,
  which accelerates cell proliferation and antiapoptotic signaling to increase the
  malignant potential of MM.
