caption: In individuals with high macrophage aggregation around dead adipocytes as
  CLS, activation stimuli such as IL-1, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipopolysaccharide
  binding protein (LBP), and TNF-α bind to their appropriate membrane receptors. Transduction
  of signal from receptors activates the NF-κB pathway, which results in transcription
  of several secreted molecules and downregulates insulin signaling. In adipocytes,
  MCP-1 recruits macrophages and MMP9 stimulates adipocyte enlargement, whereas secreted
  ILs and TNF-α further activate inflammatory cascades and participate to insulin
  resistance development. TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNFR, TNF receptor.
