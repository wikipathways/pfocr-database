caption: 'Model illustrating the development of necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility
  (NETS) in a compatible interaction and PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) in an incompatible
  interaction with the participation of NEs SnToxA, SnTox1 and SnTox3 and enzymes
  of redox metabolism of the host plant (NADPH-oxidases localized on the plasmallema
  also known as respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs), peroxidases (POD) superoxide
  dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)) in the S. nodorum–T. aestivum pathosystem. Legend:
  Ch—chitin, ERF1—transcription factor Ethylene responsive factor 1, NPR1—Nonexpressor
  of PR Genes1, TaPrx—gene encoding anionic peroxidase, —positive regulation, —negative
  regulation, ???—unknown signal transduction pathway.'
