caption: Model of the extracellular network of proteins that control D–V patterning.
  Crescent was shown here to be a component of the extracellular biochemical network
  that controls D–V patterning. Arrows in blue represent transcriptional regulation
  by BMPs, arrows in black symbolize direct protein–protein interactions, and the
  red arrows indicate flux of Chordin/ADMP/BMP from the dorsal toward the ventral
  side of the embryo. Each protein–protein interaction indicated here is supported
  by biochemical and embryological studies in Xenopus. (A) The BMP/Chordin gradient
  plays a central role in D–V patterning. (B) Tolloid metalloproteinases are inhibited
  by Crescent from the dorsal and Sizzled from the ventral side. (C) The extracellular
  biochemical pathway of D–V development in Xenopus embryos, including the flux of
  Chordin/BMP complexes from dorsal to ventral. Two important regulators of the Chordin/BMP
  pathway have been omitted for simplicity in this diagram. One is Ont-1, an adaptor
  Olfactomedin-related protein that binds both Chordin and Tolloid, which facilitates
  Chordin proteolysis (). The other regulator is Twisted-gastrulation (Tsg), a protein
  that binds both BMP and Chordin, facilitating BMP signaling, the binding of BMP
  to Chordin, and the cleavage of Chordin by Tolloids (; ).
