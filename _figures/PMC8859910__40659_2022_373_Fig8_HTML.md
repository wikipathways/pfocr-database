caption: Molecular oxidative stress response of P. xenovorans LB400 during exposure
  to paraquat and H2O2. Green arrows indicate upregulation of genes and/or proteins,
  while red arrows indicate downregulation. Dashed arrows indicate the transport of
  O2, H2O2 and paraquat through the cell membranes. Dotted arrow indicates Fenton
  reaction, a process during which metal ions (mainly Fe2+) react with H2O2 forming
  hydroxyl radical. Glucose is converted into gluconate 6-phosphate (gluconate-6P)
  by glucokinase and the Pentose Phosphate (PP) pathway. Blue arrow indicates the
  transformation of the gluconate-6P to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and pyruvate
  via the Entner–Doudoroff pathway. Purple arrow indicates the conversion of G3P into
  pyruvate via the lower Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway. OM outer membrane,
