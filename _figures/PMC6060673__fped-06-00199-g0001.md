caption: 'Immunomodulatory approaches for the treatment and prevention of neonatal
  sepsis. (A) PTX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, mediates most of its functions by
  enhanced cyclic AMP (cAMP) due to a reduced degradation of cAMP (, ). Relatively
  high concentrations of adenosine are present in neonatal blood plasma and neonatal
  mononuclear cells demonstrate increased sensitivity to the cAMP-mediated inhibitory
  effects of adenosine (, ). As immunomodulatory properties of PTX are mediated via
  adenosine-dependent pathways, adenosine and PTX in combination, lead to a profound
  inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine production (). On neonatal APCs,
  PTX demonstrates anti-inflammatory properties by (1) down-regulating TLR4 expression
  and signaling, (2) downregulation of surface molecules such as CD14 and CD11b, and
  (3) inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production (). (B) The microbiome of premature
  infants has a smaller proportion of beneficial bacteria and higher numbers of pathogenic
  bacteria compared to term infants, likely owing to higher frequencies of cesarean
  sections, antibiotic use, exposure to the hospital environment, and artificial feeding

  (1) decreasing proinflammatory cytokines, (2) increasing the production of anti-inflammatory
  cytokines, and (3) decreasing the permeability of the gut to bacteria and toxins
