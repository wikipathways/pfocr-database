caption: Schematic diagram showing the mechanisms of sesquiterpenoids in regulation
  of insect eusociality. (A) The effect of JH on reproduction and polyethism in ants.
  The elevation of JH represses ovary development in simple, queenless societies but
  promotes queen production and vitellogenin expression in complex societies. JH also
  induces threat responsiveness and reduces interest in intraida works in ants, and
  may also increase their body size. (B) The effect of JH on reproduction and polyethism
  in wasps. JH generally stimulates the production of queens and ovary development,
  and mediates cuticular hydrocarbon blend resembling reproductive status in young
  workers of swarm-founding wasps. Besides, JH triggers the guarding and foraging
  behavior. (C) The queen releases QMP which downregulates JH and Kr-h1 and thus inhibits
  ovary development of workers and the transition from in-hive worker to forager in
  bees. (D) The increase of JH in JH-Met signaling pathway induces TGFβ and 20E signals
  that promote the modification molts from worker to soldier in the sterile caste
  of termite Z. nevadensis.
