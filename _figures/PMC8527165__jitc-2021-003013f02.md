caption: 'The redundant signaling networks of immunosuppressive metabolites. Kynurenine
  (KYN) pathway (left—green): KYN enters the cell via the LAT1, LAT2 or PAT4 transporters.
  In the cytoplasm, KYN binds the AhR-cPGES-Hsp90-AIP complex. AIP dissociates from
  the complex after KYN binds, and the KYN-AhR-cPGES-Hsp90 complex translocates into
  the nucleus. within the nucleus, cPGES and Hsp90 dissociate, and AhR forms a heterodimer
  with Arnt that modulates gene expression in a widespread manner. Kynurenic acid
  (KYNA) also agonizes the extracellular GPR35 receptor, which inhibits Akt, p38,
  and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and quinolinic acid (QUINA) agonizes the NMDA receptors
  to increase intracellular Ca2+ and ROS and decrease IFN-γ and TNF-α production.
  Adenosine (ADO) (top center left—yellow): ADO can agonize four different G-protein
  coupled receptors (GPR35), of which A2AAR and A2BAR stimulate cAMP generation and
  downstream immunosuppression mediated by the cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway, shown in orange.
  (Nor)epinephrine (NOR) (top center right—magenta): NOR and epinephrine (EPI) can
  agonize either α-adrenergic or β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR). Agonism of all three
  β-AR elicits immunosuppressive signaling cascades through cAMP-PKA-CREB. Prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE2) (top rightadrenergic—blue): similar to ADO, PGE2 can agonize four receptors,
  of which two (EP2 and EP4) elicit immunosuppressive signaling cascades through cAMP-PKA-CREB.
  cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway: cAMP production is increased by ADO, NOR, and/or
  PGE2 signaling through Gs-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase. adenylate cyclase
  generates cAMP from ATP, and cAMP then activates PKA. A cAMP-PKA complex enters
  the nucleus where it phosphorylates the CREB transcription factor. phosphorylated
  CREB recruits HAT and CBP and then modulates target gene expression. All proteins
  are denoted by text within shapes while metabolites are free-floating text. Straight
