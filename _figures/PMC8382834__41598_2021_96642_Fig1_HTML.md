caption: Schematic figure showing an overview of interactions between proteins involved
  in HSP and associated stress-response pathways in response to hypoglycemia. These
  interactions decide the fate of the downstream signaling pathway. The HSPs and associated
  proteins interact with the cell surface receptors and/or with each other in response
  to different stimuli, including accumulated unfolded/misfolded proteins, hormones
  and cellular/environmental stress (including hypoglycemia) (as indicated by upward
  red arrows) and regulate different molecules affecting a spectrum of biological
  functions such as apoptosis, autophagy, cell migration and alterations in the immune
  response. Schematic created using Biorender (https://biorender.com).
