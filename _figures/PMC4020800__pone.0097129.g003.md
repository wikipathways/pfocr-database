caption: A proposed schematic view of how propofol and OA interfere with neurite retraction.
  Propofol binds to GABAAR and causes neurite retraction through the RhoA/ROK pathway
  by activating the acto-myosin complex (blue box), where phosphorylation of myosin
  via myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) causes contraction of the neurite. When myosin
  is de-phosphorylated via myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) the neurite extends.
  OA binds to OXR and activates PLD, increasing DAG, which activates PKCε by increasing
  the phosphorylation of PKCε Ser729. The activated PKCε translocates from the cytosol
  to the cell membrane. The now activated PKCε then interfere with a membrane effector,
  possibly the GABAAR, which might cause a decrease in the amount of GABAAR at the
  cell surface. PKCε also have an actin binding motif, that could directly interfere
  with the cytoskeletal actin involved in the contractile response causing neurite
  retraction. PKCε stabilizes F-actin when bound, and then retraction could not take
  place. Propofol reduces the phosphorylation of PKCε Ser729 below the amount in unstimulated
  cells, suggesting that propofol counter-balances the normal activity of cellular
  PKCε; the signalling pathway of propofol might include PLD as inhibition of PLD
  restore PKCε Ser729 phosphorylation. The exact pathway used, is yet to be determined.
