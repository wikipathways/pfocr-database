caption: Molecular mechanisms of the HVD. Acute hypoxia of 5 to 30 min leads to a
  decrease in ventilatory drive, or a hypoxic apnea. The underlying mechanism of this
  HVR is poorly understood but evidence indicates mediation at both the peripheral
  chemoreceptors (A) and within the CNS (B). (A) At the peripheral chemoreceptors,
  DA release may inhibit hypoxia-mediated carotid body depolarization and reduce carotid
  sinus nerve activity and thus downstream phrenic nerve activity. (B) At the synapse
  between the carotid sinus nerve and NTS second-order neurons, GABA accumulation
  due to chronic activation of GABAergic interneurons or conversion of excessive synaptic
  glutamate to GABA by GAD inhibits the electrical excitability and downstream phrenic
  nerve activation. DA may act on either the carotid sinus nerve afferent or GABAergic
  interneurons to decrease GABA accumulation via these putative pathways. Activation
  of adenosine and opioid receptors has also been implicated in this pathway, potentially
  via inhibition of glutamatergic NMDAR activity mediated by inhibitory g protein
  signaling. (C) Physiologically, STP manifests as decreased ventilation (data shown
  are from hypoxic chemodenervated dogs; adapted from () with permission.
