caption: Scheme of HO-1-regulated ferroptosis. HO-1 plays a dual role in ferroptosis,
  pro-ferroptotic and anti-ferroptotic effects. Erastin and sorafenib (xCT inhibitor)
  and RSL3 (glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) inhibitor) can deplete glutathione, leading
  to ROS generation. In response to oxidative stress, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2 (Nrf2) disassociates from Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1),
  and then migrates into nuclei, where it binds the antioxidant-response element (ARE)
  site of target genes such as HO-1 and ferritin. HO-1 catalyzes heme degradation
  to generate ferrous iron (Fe2+). Ferrous iron is highly reactive as a pro-oxidant
  and, thus, produces ROS. Excessive ROS damage intracellular structures and DNA,
  causing the peroxidation of lipid and protein and eventually cell death. Nrf2 induces
  ferritin expression to chelate ferrous iron, avoiding ROS overload. Recently, some
  small molecules were identified to possess a pro-ferroptosis effect through HO-1.
  Heme can directly activate HO-1 expression. Similar to erastin and sorafenib, BAY117089
  can deplete GSH and increase ROS production, resulting in Nrf2−HO-1 activation and
  ferroptosis. Withaferin A directly targets Keap1 and releases Nrf2, followed by
  HO-1 activation, iron accumulation, and cell death. Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate
  (MgIG) increases HO-1 expression and free cellular iron level. By contrast, the
  activation of HO-1 might provide a cytoprotective effect. For example, in erastin-,
  sorafenib-, and RSL-stimulated cells, ferritin expression is increased through the
  Nrf2−HO-1 pathway and neutralize iron toxicity. Nrf2-targeted antioxidant gene expression
  also benefits the acquisition of drug resistance. Artesunate also induces the Nrf2−HO-1
  signal to assist cells to acquire drug resistance.
