caption: Proposed hypothesis for the effect of melittin on formation of osteoclast-like
  MNCs. Stimulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) to macrophages
  activates an adaptor protein TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) in the cytoplasm,
  sequentially mediates induction of phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs) particularly ERK, together with activation of NF-κB. Expression
  of osteoclastogenic genes including TRAP, cathepsin K, matrix metalloproteinase-9
  (MMP-9), and carbonic anhydrase II was induced through phosphorylation of c-Fos
  and nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) at the downstream
  in signal transduction of MAPK pathway. In addition, the stimulation of macrophages
  with RANKL induces an increase in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression, which may contribute
  to osteoclastogenesis. These signals are effectively inhibited by melittin targeting
  TRAF6 and IL-1β.
