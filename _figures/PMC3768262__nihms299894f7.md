caption: Spatial organization in natural enzyme systems. (A) Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase
  utilizes a physical channel that protects the labile intermediates ammonia, carboxy
  phosphate, and carbamate from the cellular environment. (B) In the fungal shikimate
  pathway, a pentafunctional polypeptide is utilized to catalyze the five reactions
  required to convert 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate to 5-enolpyruvylshikimate
  3-phosphate. (C) The breakdown of cellulose requires multiple enzymes of the glycosyl
  hydrolase superfamily, including reducing and non-reducing end exoglucanases as
  well as endoglucanases. The spatial organization of cellulosomes allows the modular
  docking and exchange of different enzymes in a single scaffold for synergistic and
  tunable degradation of the sugar polymer (CBM, celluolose binding module). (D) Formation
  of the purinosome complex between the enzymes that catalyze de novo purine biosynthesis
  is believed to protect the short-lived intermediates, phosphoribosylamine (PRA)
  and 4-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR), in the mammalian pathway between
  5-phosphoribosyl-α-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and inosine monophosphate (IMP). In most
  bacteria, yeasts, and plants, the precursor to CAIR, N5-carboxy-4-aminoimidazole
  ribonucleotide (N5-CAIR, t½ = 15 s), also exists as a short-lived intermediate but
  is channeled by a multifunctional enzyme in mammals.
