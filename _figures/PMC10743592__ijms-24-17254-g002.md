caption: Presentation of the action of ghrelin on autophagy. The effects of ghrelin
  on autophagy mainly focus on the mTOR/ULK signaling pathway. Ghrelin has positive
  or negative regulation on autophagy. On the one hand, ghrelin can increase the level
  of AMPK to enhance autophagy to provide treatment for cardiovascular diseases, intestinal
  sepsis, and neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, ghrelin can prevent autophagy
  by increasing the levels of PI2K/Akt or MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling pathway, which can
  be applied in liver fibrosis, COPD, glaucomatous injury, NAFLD, COH, and others.
  The rising arrow represents the increased levels, while the falling arrow represents
  the decreased levels. The figure is made using Biorender
