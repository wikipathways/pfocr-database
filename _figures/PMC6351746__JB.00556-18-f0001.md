caption: 'Biochemical pathways of R. sphaeroides linking 3-hydroxypropionate assimilation
  to central carbon metabolism. Precursor metabolites are represented in boxes. (A)
  Metabolic scheme showing possible routes by which 3-hydroxypropionate can enter
  central carbon metabolism at both the level of acetyl-CoA via an oxidative path
  and at the level of succinyl-CoA via a reductive path. An oxidative path has not
  been demonstrated for R. sphaeroides, and acetyl-CoA may also be formed by pyruvate
  oxidation. Acetyl-CoA can be used directly for the synthesis of cell constituents,
  such as fatty acids, or could enter the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway. (B and C) The
  series of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes specific to the ethylmalonyl-CoA
  pathway and the reductive 3-hydroxypropionate assimilatory pathway of R. sphaeroides
