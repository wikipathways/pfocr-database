caption: β-catenin and TCF-4 repress basal and Tat transactivation of the HIV LTR
  through distinct mechanisms and are in turn antagonized by HIV Tat. (a) Under basal
  LTR activity (without significant Tat level), the TCF-4/ β-catenin/SMAR1 complex
  represses LTR activity and transcription is low or silent. Low levels of Tat may
  be produced but are primarily retained in the cytoplasm by association with TCF-4.
  (b) When β-catenin signaling is disrupted by pro-inflammatory mediators (IFNγ) or
  any other signal that down regulates the β-catenin pathway, this complex is disrupted
  and LTR activity increases. Once the level of Tat reaches a certain threshold, Tat
  will a) transactivate the HIV LTR by inducing chromatin remodeling and recruiting
  positive transcription elongation factor b (pTEFb), allowing for efficient viral
  replication; and b) antagonize β-catenin signaling through mutual binding/inhibition
  with TCF-4 and enhanced degradation of β-catenin to maintain a permissive state
  for HIV replication. The broader biological consequences of productive infection
  in astrocytes include raising the CNS viral load and increasing production of neurotoxic
  HIV proteins (Tat, gp120, Vpr), potentially leading to neuronal injury and neuroinflammation.
