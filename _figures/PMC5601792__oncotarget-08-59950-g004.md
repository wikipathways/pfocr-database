caption: Activated CD147 might increase tumor invasion by inducing the release of
  MMPs and uPA in the surrounding stromal cells. It also stimulates tumor angiogenesis
  by elevating VEGF and MMP expression in neighboring fibroblasts and epithelial cells
  via microvesicle shedding. Hyaluronan, caveolin, or integrin α3β1 interacts with
  CD147 in cancer cells and enhances the effect of CD147 on adhesion, invasion and
  MMPs secretion. Up-regulated CD147 expression is induced by TGF-β coupled with epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition, and targets PIP3, No/cGMP, and MAPK to induce EMT for cancer invasion
  and metastasis. Additionally, CD147 suppresses the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis
  via Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. CD147 expression is controlled by the cell survival PI3K/Akt/GSK3β
  signaling pathway, and is directly regulated by the transcription factor Slug. CD147
  overexpression promotes the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which up-regulates
  the transcriptional level of TCF-4, VEGF and Zeb1.
