caption: Mechanism of Mn effect on MEK5/ERK5 and apoptosis. The MN9D cells produce
  a large amount of ROS after manganese exposure; the oxidative stress activates the
  MEK/ERK5 cascade pathway. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by ERK5 reduces Bcl-2’s anti-apoptotic
  function, while the increased expression of Bax and Caspase-3 after Mn exposure
  enhances the pro-apoptotic activities. These effects, in combination, lead to a
  damaged mitochondrial membrane, increased ROS production, and aggravated apoptosis,
  and functionally reduces DA production and secretion.
