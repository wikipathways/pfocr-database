caption: 'Regulatory activities of nuclear receptors on the NLRP3 inflammasome priming
  and activation steps. The priming (first step) of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires
  the binding and activation of PRRs (TLRs,…) by PAMPs such as LPS, cytokines or ox-LDL,
  resulting in the transcription of the NLRP3 inflammasome components. Its activation
  (second step) is the result of recognition of PAMPs (such as the bacterial pore-forming
  toxin nigericin) or DAMPs which are released by damaged or dying cells (such as
  ATP) following injury or metabolic imbalance (such as mtROS), or accumulate in tissues
  (such as crystals). These lead to lysosomal damage, mitochondrial damages (exposition
  of cardiolipin, mtDNA) which ultimately modify ion (K+, Ca2+) fluxes. Upon this
  two-step process, the NLRP3 inflammasome assembles, caspase 1 is activated, Gasdermin-D
  and pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 are cleaved, leading to mature cytokines secretion and
  cell death by pyroptosis. The activity of nuclear receptors on each step is indicated
