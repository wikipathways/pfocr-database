caption: Mitophagy resists two forms of cell death. Mitophagy is mediated by PINK1/Parkin
  as well as autophagy receptors NIX, BNIP3 and FUNDC1, and is regulated by p38/MAPK14
  and autophagy regulatory pathways. Mitophagy resists pyroptosis and ferroptosis
  by ablating damaged mitochondria and the mtROS they produce. In terms of pyroptosis
  induction, mtROS can induce pyroptosis as well as release of IL-1β, IL-18 through
  the NF-κB/NLRP3-Caspase-1-GSDMD pathway and BAX-Caspase-3-GSDME pathway. In the
  pyroptosis pathway, cleaved N-terminal GSDM proteins lack membrane selectivity,
  causing damage to mitochondria, leading to the release of mtDNA and mtROS, and exacerbating
  pyroptosis. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α upregulates both NLRP3 to promote pyroptosis
  and BNIP3 to promote mitophagy mitigating pyroptosis. In terms of ferroptosis induction,
  ferritinophagy increased LIP and ROS, promoting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.
  Mitochondrial VDAC opening-mediated mitochondrial labile iron uptake reduces LIP.
  As the continuous accumulation of mitochondrial labile iron exacerbates mitochondrial
  damage and induces mitophagy. Ultimately, mitochondrial iron is released into the
  cytoplasm, inducing ferroptosis in a mitophagy-dependent manner. The inhibition
  of mitochondrial complex I triggers mitophagy and mitophagy-dependent elevation
  of mtROS levels, which subsequently induces ferroptosis. FUNDC1 recruits GPX4 into
  mitochondria while activating mitophagy, leading to reduced GPX4 and enhanced ferroptosis
