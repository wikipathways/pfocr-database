caption: 'Comparison of nonsynonymous substitution rates among members of RB and p53
  signaling pathways. Unrooted trees are scaled on dN estimated by maximum likelihood
  under a codon substitution model. Connections between genes describe evolutionary
  relationships between sequences. Labels above denote the relative rate of accumulation
  of changes (e.g., exon 2 gains nonsynonymous mutations 3.2 times faster than its
  interacting gene, CDK4, whereas the rates of amino acid substitutions between the
  two exons of INK4a are equal). (A) The evolution of ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway. ARF safeguards
  tumor suppressor activity of p53 by binding and inhibiting one of its antagonists:
  MDM2. (B) INK4a-CDK4/6-RB pathway. INK4a maintains RB, a tumor suppressor that prevents
  cells from entering the S phase and initiating DNA replication, in active nonphosphorylated
  state by inhibiting cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6.'
