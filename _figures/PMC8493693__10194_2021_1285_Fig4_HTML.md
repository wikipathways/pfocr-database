caption: Oxidative phosphorylation was implicated as a significantly altered metabolic
  pathway based on the ranked list enrichment analysis of all genes whose transcripts
  were detected from PBMC samples. Results of the analysis between ictal vs. interictal
  (upper panel) and interictal vs. healthy (lower panel) samples are shown. All detected
  genes are mapped to the pathway map. Original figure was rendered by Pathview
