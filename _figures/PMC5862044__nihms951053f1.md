caption: Metabolism plays an important role in T cell proliferation and differentiation
  and dysregulation of metabolism is often linked to autoimmune diseases. Upon activation,
  T cells primarily use aerobic glycolysis and produce lactate as a byproduct to support
  the biosynthetic precursors that are required for cellular proliferation. Increased
  lactate and abnormal glycolytic function are frequently observed in T cells from
  asthma and rheumatoid arthritis patients. During activation, T cells increase the
  expression of glutamine transporters and glutamate metabolism to support T cell
  proliferation and differentiation. Interestingly, increased levels of glutamate
  and glutamine are observed at the site of demyelination and axonal degeneration
  in MS patients. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) promotes activation and differentiation
  of the T effector cells, and down-regulates Treg differentiation. Also, the Akt-mTOR
  pathway act as a negative regulator of Treg cells. Activation of mTORC1 promotes
  glycolysis through hypoxia-induced factor 1α (HIF1 α), and dysregulation of mTOR
  is frequently observed in MS patients. These changes in metabolism provide a unique
  opportunity to target specific pathways for disease treatment purposes.
