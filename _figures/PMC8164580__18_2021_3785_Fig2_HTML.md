caption: Mechanisms underlying synaptic scaling in hippocampal neurons. Synaptic scaling
  can serve as a feedback mechanism to prevent excitotoxicity by scaling down excitatory
  synapses (left panel) and increasing inhibitory synapses and transmission (right
  panel). Initially, HIV tat may increase NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activity by either
  directly interacting with the receptor or by promoting phosphorylation or membrane
  trafficking of intracellular NMDA receptors. Ion flux through NMDA receptors then
  activates the serine–threonine kinase Akt, which phosphorylates the E3 ubiquitin
  (Ub) ligase Mdm2. Mdm2 then ubiquitinates PSD95, an important structural component
  of dendritic spines, which promotes PSD95 degradation and corresponding de-potentiation
  of the synapse. Increased inhibition is mediated by both the initial ion influx
  via NMDA receptors and by gp120-mediated secretion of IL-1β from glial cells. First,
  IL-1β binds to neuronal IL-1 receptors (IL1R), which activates a P38-mediated pathway
  that leads to membrane insertion of α5-containing GABAa receptors (GABAaR) and enhanced
  inhibitory transmission. Additionally, IL1 receptor and NMDA receptor signaling
  activate the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src, which at a later point leads to the
  synthesis of gephyrin, an important structural component of inhibitory synapses,
  its translocation to the membrane, and an increased number of inhibitory synapses
