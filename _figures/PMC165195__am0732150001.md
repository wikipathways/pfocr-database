caption: 'Methanol metabolism in B. methanolicus. Methanol is initially oxidized to
  formaldehyde, which may be dissimilated to CO2 or assimilated to pyruvate via the
  RuMP pathway. From pyruvate, the carbon flow is split between entering the TCA cycle
  or conversion to aspartate and its related amino acids. Abbreviations: TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; RuMP, ribulose monophosphate pathway; PYR, pyruvate; ASP, aspartate;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; OG, 2-oxoglutarate; GLU, glutamate; LYS, l-lysine; CoA, coenzyme
  A. Enzymes: 1, pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDH; 2, citrate synthase, CS; 3, pyruvate
  carboxylase, PC; 4, glutamate:oxaloacetate aminotransferase, GOT; 5, aconitase,
  ACN; 6, isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH; 7, glutamate synthase, GOGAT; 8, 2-oxoglutarate
  dehydrogenase, OGDC.'
