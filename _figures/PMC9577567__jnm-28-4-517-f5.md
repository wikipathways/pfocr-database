caption: 'Potential drug target sites in the complex events of post-operative ileus
  (POI). Several potential sites could be targeted to dampen the effect of POI. Four
  main intertwined events could be targeted: ➊ Neuroinflammation, ➋ Inflammatory pathways,
  ➌ Epithelial barrier disruption, and ➍ Gut microbiota. CRF, corticotropin-releasing
  factor; HPA, hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal; TJPs, tight junction proteins; PAR-2,
  protease activated receptor-2; CAIP, cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; 5-HT4,
  5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptor; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecules-1; iNOS,
  inducible nitric oxide synthase; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2. X means inhibition of
  POI.'
