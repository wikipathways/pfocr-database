caption: 'Wnt signaling is regulated by the cytoplasmic β-catenin destruction complex,
  which consists of the core proteins AXIN, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase
  1, and glycogen synthase kinase 3[]. Wnt ligands bind to the frizzled and low-density-lipoprotein-related
  protein 5/6 coreceptor complex and cause the accumulation and nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin. In the nucleus, β-catenin engages the T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid
  enhancer-binding factor transcription factors to activate the Wnt transcriptional
  program[]. In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, Tea polyphenols (TPs) can inhibit β-catenin/TCF-4
  activity and reduce β-catenin protein expression and further reduce the expression
  of two downstream signaling targets, namely, cyclin D1 and c-Jun. Black TPs can
  also suppress the accumulation of β-catenin by suppressing the phosphorylation of
  GSK3β by decreasing the activation of PI3Knase and Akt. Furthermore, TPs also promote
  the degradation of β-catenin by inhibiting β-catenin response transcription. APC:
  Adenomatous polyposis coli; CK1: Casein kinase 1; GSK3: Glycogen synthase kinase
  3; TCF: T cell factor; TP: Tea polyphenol; LEF: Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor;
  LRP5/6: Low-density lipoprotein-related protein 5/6; CRT: β-catenin response transcription.'
