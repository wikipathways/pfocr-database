caption: Schematic diagram of metabolic pathways of soybean root and leaf in response
  to Mn toxicity. The dashed line frame represents the metabolic pathway of the root
  in response to Mn toxicity, and the solid line frame represents the metabolic pathway
  of the leaf in response to Mn toxicity.
