caption: 'Endolysosome-mediated therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2: SARS-CoV-2
  enters cells following interactions between viral spike proteins and cell surface
  ACE2 receptors. Once endocytosed, spike proteins in endosomes are primed in late
  endosomes/lysosomes by cathepsin enzymes (B/L); this enhances virus entry. Post-fusion,
  virus is either released from or degraded in endolysosomes. SARS-CoV-2 once released
  from endolysosomes, enters the cytosol where it produces a replication complex to
  generate viral genomic and sub-genomic RNA. Following replication, viral structural
  proteins get inserted into the ER and move to the ERGIS (endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi
  intermediate compartment) secretory pathway for virus assembly. Following assembly,
  virions are transported to vesicles and released from cells by exocytosis. Thus,
  various stages are targetable for intervention. The first target might be fusion
  between spike proteins and host ACE2 receptors. A second target might be de-acidification
  of endolysosomes and blocking the priming of spike proteins by deactivating serine
  proteases. A third target might be clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Fourth, TPC and
  NPC1 inhibitors could effectively inhibit the virus infection by de-acidifying endolysosomes
  and blocking the trafficking of cholesterol. Endolysosome acidification may also
  be a therapeutic target because of its capacity to block the escape of viral RNA
  to the cytosol and enhance the degradation of the virus in lysosomes. Shown in the

  steps in the virus cycle. SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2;
