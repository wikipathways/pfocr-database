caption: Peripheral blood was collected in patients that displayed reduced joint disease
  (DMARD responders, Resp) and those that did not (DMARD non-responders; Non-Resp)
  6 months after treatment initiation. Peripheral blood lipid mediator profiles were
  established using LC-MS/MS-based lipid mediator profiling. a, b OPLS-DA of lipid
  mediator profiles from Resp and Non-Resp. a Score plot, b Represents the loading
  plot with mediators displaying VIP score >1 highlighted in green or blue and correspond
  with either Resp or Non-Resp, respectively. c, d Pathway analysis for the differential
  expression of mediators from the c DHA and n-3 DPA and d EPA and AA bioactive metabolomes
  in Non-Resp when compared to Resp. Statistical differences between the normalised
  concentrations (expressed as the fold change) of the lipid mediators from the Non-Resp
  and Resp groups were determined using a two-sided t test followed by multiple comparison
  correction using Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Up- or downregulated mediators are
  denoted with using upward and downward facing triangles, respectively, and on changes
  of the node’s size. Bolded mediators represent statistical differences between the
  two groups when adjusted p value <0.05. Results are representative of n = 27 for
  Resp and n = 17 for Non-Resp. Source data are provided as a Source data file.
