caption: 'Biogenesis of exosomes, and cellular uptake and journey of internalized
  and endogenously produced exosomes. a Biogenesis of exosomes. Extracellular constituents
  along with cell surface proteins enter cells through endocytosis of plasma membrane
  segments. This resulting plasma membrane bud leads to the formation of Early sorting
  endosomes (ESEs) or fuses with ESEs pre-formed by the constituents of the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), trans-Golgi network (TGN), and mitochondria. ESEs give rise to Late
  sorting endosomes (LSEs). Invagination in the LSE results in the Multivesicular
  bodys (MVBs) generation containing Intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) as future exosomes.
  MVBs can ultimately undergo degradation in the lysosomes with the degradation products
  recycled by the cells. MVBs can also be transported to the plasma membrane and dock
  on the luminal side of the plasma membrane. Exocytosis follows and results in the
  release of the exosomes. b Cellular uptake and journey of internalized and endogenously
  produced exosomes. In the recipient cell (which can be the exosome-producing cell
  itself), exogenous exosomes may be internalized by multiple pathways and can undergo
  various fates. Depending on the cell type, extracellular exosomes can dock either
  at the plasma membrane to release their intraluminal contents into the cytoplasm
  of recipient cell by fusion. They can remain bound to the surface (for example,
  to integrins) and initiate intracellular signalling pathways (for example, antigen
  presentation). Extracellular exosomes may also be internalized by various types
  of endocytosis: phagocytosis, micropinocytosis, clathrin-dependent endocytosis,
  lipid raft dependent endocytosis, and caveolae endocytosis. Internalization will
  target exogenous extracellular exosomes into the canonical endosomal pathway, whereby
  they reach MVBs, in which the internalized exosomes are likely to mix with endogenous
  ILVs. Exosome biogenesis and cellular uptake pathways intersection results in a
  composition of net production of mixed endogenous and exogenous exosomes population.'
