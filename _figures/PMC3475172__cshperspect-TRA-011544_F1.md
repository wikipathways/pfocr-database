caption: Model of canonical eukaryotic translation initiation pathway. The pathway
  is shown as a series of discrete steps starting with dissociation of 80S ribosomes
  into subunits. Binding of factors is depicted both as a single step via the multifactor
  complex and as two separate steps, with eIFs 1, 1A, and 3 binding first followed
  by binding of ternary complex and eIF5. The resulting 43S preinitiation complex
  (PIC) is then loaded onto an activated mRNP near the 5′ cap. Subsequent scanning
  of the mRNA allows recognition of the start codon, which triggers downstream steps
  in the pathway including eIF1 release from the PIC, Pi release from eIF2, and conversion
  to the closed, scanning-arrested state of the complex. eIF2·GDP released after subunit
  joining is recycled back to eIF2·GTP by the exchange factor eIF2B. eIF5B in its
  GTP-bound form promotes joining of the 60S subunit to the preinitiation complex,
  which triggers release of eIF5B·GDP and eIF1A to form the final 80S initiation complex,
  which can begin the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Throughout, GTP is depicted
  as a green ball and GDP as a red ball. (Modified from ; reproduced, with permission,
