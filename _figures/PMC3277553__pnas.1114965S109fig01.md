caption: Selection of T cells to be produced (repertoire selection) by ganglioside
  selection. (A) The core biosynthetic pathway of gangliosides. Staining by CTx-B
  detects not only GM1a ganglioside but also extended-GM1b. (B) Distinct difference
  of lipid rafts in individual T-cell subsets. The repertoire selection from immature
  thymocytes to mature T-cell subpopulations is accompanied by selective ganglioside
  expression. Analysis confirms that CD4+ T cells dominantly express a-series gangliosides
  due to up-regulation (increased expression) of GM3S genes. Meanwhile, CD8+ T cells
  carry o-series gangliosides due to down-regulation (decreased expression) of GM3S
  genes and up-regulation of GM2/GD2S expression. This result suggests that each T-cell
  subset has unique rafts composed of different ganglioside types and that these rafts
  provide distinct functions following stimulation of T cells via their receptors
  (TCRs). This ganglioside selection process may be indispensable in the formation
  of distinct and functional lipid rafts in mature T cells.
