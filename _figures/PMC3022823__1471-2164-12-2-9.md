caption: Pathway analysis of FBPA clustering on gene expression in the bystander response.
  FBPA clusters 2, 3 and 4 are shown here as networks generated by mapping genes using
  Agilent IDs and using the "grow" tool in IPA to identify potential transcriptional
  regulators upstream of genes in that cluster. Arrows indicate the direction of activity
  of a protein (empty node) interacting with the gene or gene product that is differentially
  regulated (colored node). Nodes are colored by log2 gene expression ratios in irradiated
  cells at 4 hours. On the scale bar, red indicates up-regulation and green, down-regulation
  of mRNA compared to sham-irradiated controls. Highlighted nodes indicate known transcriptional
  regulators involved in the radiation gene response in IMR-90 fibroblasts (violet
  outline) and potential new regulators of transcription (orange outline) suggested
  by the IPA analyses.
