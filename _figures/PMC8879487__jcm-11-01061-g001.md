caption: 'Metabolic pathway of Phe and BH4. Phe metabolism is crucial for protein
  synthesis, as well as for the synthesis of Tyr and its derivatives. The major catabolic
  pathway involves Phe hydroxylation to Tyr by PAH. In one of the minor pathways,
  Phe may undergo conversion to Phenylpyruvic acid. An essential cofactor and regulator
  of PAH is BH4, whose biosynthesis and regeneration depend by different enzymes.
