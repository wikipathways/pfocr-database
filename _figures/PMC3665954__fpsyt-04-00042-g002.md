caption: 'Summary Model of Reinstatement Related BNST and VTA Connectivity. CRF+ neurons
  modulate the activity of VTA-projecting BNST neurons. Evidence (Kudo et al., ) shows
  that at least three types of VTA-projecting neurons are located in the BNST: (1)
  a GABAergic projection (∼90% of all BNST projection neurons) that selectively innervates
  VTA GABA neurons to provide disinhibition of VTA DA neurons; (2) a glutamatergic
  (Glut) projection that selectively targets VTA DA neurons; and (3) a mixed GABA/Glut
  projection that also targets VTA DA neurons. These projection neuron populations
  may exist in both the dorsal and ventral BNST subregions (d and vBNST, respectively)
  and each projection pathway may have distinct and coordinated responses to chronic
  drug exposure, withdrawal, and reinstatement. Coordinated activity of dBNST and
  vBNST projection neurons is likely regulated by dBNST interneurons, of which CRF+
  neurons may be a critical component. This local CRF neuron coordination of BNST
  activity might also be altered by chronic exposure and withdrawal and may be an
  important target for the prevention of relapse-like behaviors.'
