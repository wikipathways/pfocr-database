caption: ( A) Healthy MuSK-mediated postsynaptic differentiation pathway at the neuromuscular
  junction (NMJ). Neural agrin secreted by the motor nerve terminal binds to LRP4,
  low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4), which causes the dimerisation
  of MuSK. MuSK dimerisation causes phosphorylation of MuSK and associated proteins
  of the MuSK pathway, including Dok7 and the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) β-subunit.
  Rapsyn is recruited to the phosphorylated AChRs, stabilising postsynaptic clusters
  of AChRs. ( B) Impaired postsynaptic differentiation in animal models of MuSK myasthenia
  gravis. MuSK autoantibodies are mainly of the immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 subclass. They
  block the assembly of the agrin-LRP4-MuSK complex. Interruption of MuSK kinase signalling
  leads to slow disassembly of the postsynaptic AChR clusters. A resultant decline
  in miniature endplate potential (mEPP) and EPP amplitude (not shown) results in
  failure of the muscle action potential and fatiguing weakness. Co-existing IgG1-3
  antibodies, although lower concentration, may contribute but their pathogenic roles
  are not yet well defined. The compensatory presynaptic upregulation of quantal release
  found in AChR MG does not occur in MuSK MG.
