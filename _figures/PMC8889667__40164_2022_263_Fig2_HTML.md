caption: 'Function of dysregulated PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in AML. Upon exposure to IFN-γ and
  TNF-α, PD-L1 levels are increased in MDS blasts via MEK and pSTAT1/pSTAT3 activation.
  Similar to MDS blasts, TP53 mutation also plays important roles in PD-L1 upregulation
  via MYC upregulation and miR-34a downregulation, thus regulating PD-L1 levels at
  a post-transcriptional level. In addition, miR-34a and miR200c are regulated by
  DICER, cJUN and MUC1. Furthermore, PD-L1+ AML blast-mediated pathogenesis occurs
  through PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, by the following mechanisms: ① blasts expressing PD-L1
  confer proliferative advantages, including enhanced cell glycolysis and higher levels
  of Cyclin D2, via activation of pJNK, resulting in more active growth; ② the interaction
  of CD200 on AML blasts with CD200R on effectors leads to the upregulation of PD-1,
  which is also regulated by increased Bmilp-1, promoting the inaction of these effector
  T cells; ③ the binding of PD-L1 on AML blasts with PD-1 on effector T cells suppress
  activation of these effector T cells, and promote conversion of Tregs from conventional
  CD4+ T cells, which triggers the secretion of IL-35 and upregulates PD-L1 on AML
  blasts via pAkt activation'
