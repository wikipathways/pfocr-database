caption: Role and regulatory mechanism of LAPTM4B in tumors. (A) Overexpression of
  LAPTM4B leads to overexpression of MMP-2, MMP-9, CDK12, and HIF-1α, and the PPRP
  motif of LAPTM4B can interact with these signaling proteins (containing SH3 structural
  domains) to promote cell invasive metastasis. (B) The AP4-LAPTM4B-c-myc axis forms
  a positive feedback regulatory loop. (C) Cells with high levels of LAPTM4B expression
  exhibit increased clearance of ceramide from late endosomes, thereby increasing
  cellular sensitivity to ceramide-induced apoptosis. (D) LAPTM4B interacts with the
  E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 and inhibits the binding of Hrs to ubiquitylated EGFR,
  thereby affecting the endosomal sorting and lysosomal degradation of EGFR, ultimately
  promoting cell proliferation and chemoresistance. (E) LAPTM4B activates the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway through its PPRP motif. Active AKT phosphorylates GSK3b, which
  attenuates c-Myc phosphorylation, leading to c-Myc accumulation. Active AKT also
  phosphorylates Forkhead box O4, which in turn affects P27 gene transcription. (F)
  LAPTM4B interacts with and stabilizes inactive EGFR in endosomes, thereby recruiting
  ATG5 to dissociate Beclin 1 from the RUBICON - Beclin 1 complex, which triggers
  autophagy. (G) LAPTM4B regulates autophagy through the EGFR signaling pathway. (H)
  The role of LAPTM4B in mTORC1 activation through recruitment of leucine transporters
  to lysosomes. (I) LAPTM4B is a determinant of the sphingolipid profile and membrane
  properties of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). LAPTM4B depends on its third
  transmembrane structural domain, containing the sphingolipid interacting motif (SLim),
  to be efficiently sorted into the luminal vesicles (ILVs) of multivacuolar endosomes
  (MVEs), which are released into the extracellular space as sEVs
