caption: Diagram of LPS-induced TLR4 signaling. LPS, the breakdown bacterial component,
  binds to LBP, and then is released from the LPS-LBP complex, and is presented to
  CD14 and TLR4 on APCs, leading to the activation of TLR4. With the assistance of
  MD-2, an important component of activated TLR4, termed Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR)
  homologous domain, binds to the C-terminus of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins MyD88,
  while the death domain (DD) at the N-terminus of MyD88 interacts with intercellular
  enzyme IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), eventually resulting in the phosphorylation
  of IRAK and the activation of TNF-α receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6). The phosphorylated
  IRAK binds to the activated TRAF, and the complex activates TGF-β-activated Kinase-1(TAK1),
  triggering the activation of inhibitor of κ polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells
  (IκB) kinase, eventually activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. The NF-κB signaling
  pathway upregulates the expression levels of the target gene. The activated NF-κB
  signaling initiates the expression of target genes, leading to the damage of target
  organs. TLR4 = Toll-like Receptor-4; LBP = lipopolysaccharide-binding Protein; TIR
