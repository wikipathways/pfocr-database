caption: Hypothetical model of the cross talk between melatonin and different phytohormones
  of Valencia sweet orange leaves. In this model, we propose that infection with Ca.
  L. asiaticus bacterium and infestation with D. citri vector, as well as exogenous
  melatonin supplementation, might induce the biosynthesis of phytomelatonin and several
  phytohormone groups, including SAs, tJA, ABA, and auxins. Briefly, exogenous melatonin
  plays a dual role in the activation of both the SA-mediated pathway against pathogen
  infection and the JA-mediated pathway against herbivory, which are the most common
  defensive pathways in vascular plants. Besides these well-known pathways, our findings
  show that melatonin is involved in the activation of both ABA and auxin pathways.
  ABA and auxins play a key role in citrus defense response against HLB. The activation
  of four phytohormone pathways leads to complex cross talk among them, which interact
  synergistically or antagonistically together, and link back to the SA-mediated pathway
  and the JA-mediated pathway. Solid lines with arrows indicate well-established/confirmed
  pathways, dashed lines with whiskers signify negative reactions, and dotted lines
  represent hypothetical mechanisms or uncharacterized elements. DAHP, 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic
  acid 7-phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
