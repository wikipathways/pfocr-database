caption: Alternative staphylococcal mechanisms for cellular entry. Staphylococcal
  protein A (SpA) directly interacts with host tumor necrosis factor α receptor 1
  (TNF1a) [], host receptor gC1qR/p33 on endothelial cells [], and host vWF in the
  extracellular matrix of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (1) []. SpA has been
  shown to activate TNF1a and EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling cascades that will re-configure
  the cytoskeleton for staphylococcal internalization [,]. Staphylococcal protein
  EAP may also enhance attachment of SpA to the endothelium by upregulating host receptor
  gC1qR/p33 on endothelial cells via TNFα release in the bloodstream (2) []. S. aureus
  (SA) has been additionally shown to stimulate its own uptake by upregulating β1
  integrin expression in the host cell through the secretion of α-hemolysin (HLA)
  (3) [,]. S. aureus HLA will disrupt cell-matrix adhesion by activating FAK signaling
  via interaction with transmembrane protein ADAM10 with the consequent acceleration
  of focal contact turnover to overcome the defensive barrier function of the airway
  epithelium (4) []. This FAK will also cause plasma membrane depolarization and activates
  p38 MAP kinase []. The β1 integrin is additionally involved in transient activation
  of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, which might play a crucial
  role in β1 integrin-mediated internalization of S. aureus [].
