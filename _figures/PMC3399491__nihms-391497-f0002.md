caption: 'Pathway for cytochrome (cyt) P450–catalyzed metabolic reactions. Initially,
  the ferric iron–heme (P-Fe) enzyme has water bound to the distal side (1) and binds
  substrate RH to eliminate the water (2). Substrate is bound in 2 above the iron
  heme in a hydrophobic pocket. Next, 2 is reduced to 3 by NADPH-dependent reductase
  to yield ferrous heme enzyme, which then binds dioxygen to form ferrous dioxygen
  or ferric superoxy complex (4) (31). This complex is reduced to P-Fe(III)-OOH via
  NADPH reductase to yield 5 and is then protonated to 6. P-Fe(III)-OOH (6) may also
  be generated by peroxide via the reversible peroxide shunt. Protonation of 6 and
  dioxygen cleavage lead to active heme-iron(IV)-oxo radical cation (7), which transfers
  oxygen to the bound substrate to yield the product ROH. Exposure of ferrous form
  3 to carbon monoxide (CO) yields P-Fe(II)-CO complex 9, which absorbs 450-nm light,
  hence the name cyt P450 (28). Abbreviation: CPR, cytochrome 450 reductase.'
