caption: Regulation of YAP/TAZ activity by key signaling events. Schematic representation
  of the core components of the Hippo pathway. When the pathway is ON, a cascade of
  core kinases, composed of MST1/2 and LATS1/2, trigger phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ,
  which results in degradation or cytoplasmic retention of YAP/TAZ by 14-3-3. Various
  other signaling pathways and upstream effectors such as GPCRs (G protein-coupled
  receptors), TAOK family kinases, cell polarity, and adhesion regulators influence
  the activity of YAP/TAZ [,,,]. Mechanical cues relayed by extracellular-matrix-binding
  integrins and GPCR-mediated actin polymerization can inactivate the pathway. Unphosphorylated
  YAP/TAZ translocate into the nucleus, where it interacts with TEAD(1-4) and other
  cofactors. Together, they fuel the expression of pro-tumorigenic genes that can
  contribute to metastasis, transcriptional addiction, and drug resistance. Figure
