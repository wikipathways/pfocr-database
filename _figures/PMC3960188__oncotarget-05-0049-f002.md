caption: mTOR can be shared by two different complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Phosphorylation
  of mTOR at Ser2448 and Ser2481 are indicative of mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation, respectively.
  mTORC1 can be activated by nutrients (amino acids, glucose), growth factors (Insulin,
  Insulin-like Growth Factor-1), hormones (leptin), and stresses (starvation, hypoxia,
  and DNA damage). Through mTORC1, these signals accelerate the synthesis of key proteins,
  involved in growth, division, metabolism and angiogenesis. mTORC1-activated p70
  S6K1 and Grb10 mediate IRS-1 degradation, thus inhibiting PI3K/Akt activation. Grb10
  also leads to negative feedback inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway. Finally, activated
  p70 S6K1 inhibits mTORC2 signaling by phosphorylating Rictor on Thr1135. Allosteric
  mTOR inhibitors exert an incomplete inhibition of mTORC1 and are inactive against
  mTORC2 under short-term conditions. Moreover, they disrupt the mTORC1-dependent
  negative feedback loop to IRS-1/PI3K, MAPK/ERK and mTORC2. As a consequence, treatment
  with mTOR allosteric inhibitors often results in increased mTORC2 activity. mTORC2
  functions upstream of Akt providing the critical second phosphorylation of Akt at
  Ser473, which is necessary for Akt full activation. mTORC2 also regulates cytoskeletal
  dynamics by activating PKCα, and regulates growth via SGK1 phosphorylation. The
  upstream regulation of mTORC2 is not well defined although ribosome association
  appears to be a major, if not the sole, mechanism of mTORC2 activation. Catalytic
  mTOR inhibitors are able to suppress activity of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes,
  avoiding oncogenic signaling pathway activation
