caption: 'Ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSC) can be enriched after chemotherapy. The
  OCSCs may be related with several mechanisms including cell cycle arrest, increased
  DNA protection and repair enzyme system, inherent epigenetic aberration, the activation
  of some cell signaling pathways related to cell survival, inactivation of some cell
  signaling pathway correlated with cell death, as well as the high ATP binding cassette
  drug transporter system. These mechanisms contribute to ovarian cancer invasion,
  metastasis, recurrence and chemoresistance. EMT: epithelial mesenchymal transition.'
