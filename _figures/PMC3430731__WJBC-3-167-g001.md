caption: 'Signaling pathways regulating lipogenesis in cancer cells. This scheme represents
  the main regulation of lipogenesis in cancer cells. Lipid metabolizing enzymes are
  regulated by oncogenic signals. Growth factor-activated PI3K-AKT or hypoxia-induced
  HIF stimulates glucose transporters and hexokinases to promote glycolysis, providing
  more synthetic precursors for fatty acid synthesis. Akt also activates the lipogenic
  enzyme activity and expression through direct phosphorylation or SREBP-mediated
  transcription enhancement of lipogenic genes. The tumor suppressor, p53, plays a
  role in glucose uptake, pentose phosphate pathway and anaplerosis of citrate. As
  a transcription factor, p53 also enhances the expression of glucose transporters
  and Glutaminase 2. The inductive effect on TIGAR and the activity inhibition of
  G6PDH caused by catalytic effect of p53 constitute a complex regulation on pentose
  phosphate pathway imposed by p53. LKB1/AMPK pathway, the master regulator in cellular
  energetic metabolism, modulates ACC activity either by direct phosphorylation or
  through SREBP-1. Myc is involved in lipid metabolism and promotes citrate anaplerosis
  through increasing glutamine transporters and glutaminase 2 expression. The activity
  and expression of lipogenic enzyme, ACL, ACC and FASN, are regulated at multiple
  levels through mTOR, MAPK, USP2a, Sp1, etc. Glut: Glucose transporter; HK: Hexokinase;
