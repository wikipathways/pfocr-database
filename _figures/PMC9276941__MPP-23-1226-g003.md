caption: Alternative splicing (AS) of CPK28 regulates plant immunity. The pathogen‐associated
  molecular pattern (PAMP)‐triggered immunity response triggered by flg22 is mediated
  by the pattern recognition receptor complex FLS2 and BAK1. FLS2 together with BAK1
  phosphorylate the cytoplasmic kinase BIK1, which acts as a positive regulator of
  the FLS2 signalling pathway. BIK1 phosphorylates RBOHD (RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE
  HOMOLOGUE D) to regulate reactive oxygen species production. BIK1 also phosphorylates
  MPK4, one of the mitogen‐activated protein kinases that constitute the PAMP‐induced
  signalling cascade leading to the activation of transcription factors that control
  the expression of defence genes. MPK4 regulates AS of a number of pathogen response
  genes, splicing factors (SFs), transcription factors (TFs), cysteine‐rich receptor‐like
  kinases (CRKs), and RNA‐binding proteins (RBPs). CPK28 acts as a negative immunity
  regulator through the association and phosphorylation of BIK1, which facilitates
  its turnover, and also through the phosphorylation of E3 PUB25/26 ligases, which
  polyubiquitinate BIK1 for proteasome‐mediated degradation. In turn, CPK28 activity
  requires its autophosphorylation or transphosphorylation by BIK1 at Ser318. The
  synthesis of a full‐length active CPK28 involves canonical splicing of its pre‐mRNA,
  which is promoted by association of the phosphorylated RNA‐binding protein IRR.
  During activation induced by plant elicitor peptides (Peps), IRR is dephoshorylated
  and dissociates from CPK28, resulting in accumulation of the PTC‐containing intron
  retention (IR) variant that yields a truncated inactive protein, leading to BIK1
  stabilization and consequently a stronger defence response.
