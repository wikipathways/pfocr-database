caption: Fluxes (mmol/gDW/h) of P. chrysogenum Wisconsin 54-1255 through the central
  metabolic pathway calculated with the genome-scale metabolic model (IAL1006) using
  the RAVEN toolbox. (a) 60% dissolved oxygen, (b) 20% dissolved oxygen, (c) 10% dissolved
  oxygen and (d) 5% dissolved oxygen. The specific rates calculated in  are used as
  model inputs, with maximization of cell growth as the objective function. The direction
  of the arrow indicates the direction of the flux and the thickness of the arrow
  indicates the magnitude of the flux.
