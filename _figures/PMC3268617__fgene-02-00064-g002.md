caption: The Dys–Syn–nNOS pathway and miRNAs coordinate the muscle differentiation
  program. Dys–Syn–nNOS signaling regulates the epigenetic profile of muscle cells
  via nitrosylation of HDAC2 that influences gene expression by altering the acetylation
  status of histones. miR-221 and miR-222 share the same seed sequence and both target
  cell cycle inhibitors, p27 and p57. miR-222 also targets β1-Syn implying an impact
  on nNOS signaling. miR-31 temporally targets terminal differentiation genes including
  Dys. miR-1 and miR-133 are transcriptionally controlled by the nitrosylation state
  of HDAC2, which is regulated by nNOS. miR-133 targets SRF during proliferation,
  which in a self regulatory manner promotes expression of miR-133. miR-1 targets
  G6PD and HDAC4 during differentiation, and since HDAC4 regulates the transcription
  of muscle differentiation genes, Dys–Syn–nNOS signaling indirectly promotes differentiation.
  In a self-promoting regulatory loop, the expression of muscle differentiation genes
  results in miR-1 expression. miR-29 is also transcriptionally controlled by the
  nitrosylation state of HDAC2. Additional regulation of miR-29 comes from YY1, a
  member of NF-κB signaling. The skeletal muscle specific miRNA, miR-206 is also upregulated
  by muscle gene expression and aids in cell cycle inhibition by targeting DNA Pola1
  and Pax7. Utrophin is another target of miR-206 providing another link between it
  and the DGC.
