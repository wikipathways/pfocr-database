caption: a| Under fasted conditions, glycogenolysis is activated and glycogen synthesis
  is suppressed. Activation of the glucagon receptor (GCGR) induces increased intracellular
  concentrations of cyclic AMP (cAMP; indicated by an up arrow), which leads to the
  activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Activated PKA inhibits the transcription of
  the glucokinase (GCK) gene; inhibits the dissociation of GCK from glucokinase regulatory
  protein (GKRP), and thus induces the nuclear sequestration of GCK; phosphorylates,
  and thus inactivates, glycogen synthase; and phosphorylates and activates phosphorylase
  kinase, which activates glycogen phosphorylase by phosphorylating Ser15. Phosphorylated,
  active glycogen phosphorylase also binds to and inhibits the GL subunit of protein
  phosphatase 1 (PP1), which prevents the PP1-dependent dephosphorylation and inactivation
  of glycogen synthase. The coordinated activation of glycogen phosphorylase and inhibition
  of glycogen synthase result in net glycogenolysis. b | Under fed conditions, hormonal
  and allosteric mechanisms coordinate the stimulation of glycogen synthesis through
  direct and indirect pathways. Glucose promotes the dissociation of GCK from GKRP,
  which leads to the cytoplasmic translocation of GCK; glucose also allosterically
  inhibits glycogen phosphorylase. The ‘direct pathway’ of glycogen synthesis involves
  the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and its subsequent incorporation
  into glycogen, with all six carbons of the glucosyl unit intact. The ‘indirect pathway’
  of glycogen synthesis involves the conversion of glucose to pyruvate, and pyruvate
  to glucose-6-phosphate, before incorporation into glycogen. Glucose-6-phosphate
  both allosterically activates glycogen synthase and is a substrate for glycogen
  synthesis. Insulin activates AKT, which, in turn, induces the transcription of GCK
  and the cytoplasmic translocation of GCK and activates phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B),
  which decreases intracellular levels of cAMP (indicated by a down arrow) and leads
  to the inhibition of the PKA-dependent processes described in part a. Active PP1
  with its GL targeting subunit dephosphorylates and inactivates glycogen phosphorylase,
  and dephosphorylates and activates glycogen synthase. The coordinated inhibition
  of glycogen phosphorylase and activation of glycogen synthase result in net hepatic
  glycogen synthesis. In parts a, b the insulin receptor (INSR) and glucagon receptor
  (GCGR) are shown in faded colours for context, and grey inhibitory arrows depict
  the processes in which they are not dominant. The dashed arrows indicate dephosphorylation.
  Small up and down arrows indicate an increase or decrease, respectively, in protein
  level or activity. GLUT2, glucose transporter 2; pSer15, phosphorylated Ser15.
