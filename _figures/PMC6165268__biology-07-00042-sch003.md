caption: The upper styrene degradation pathway is initiated by the FAD-dependent epoxidation
  of styrene to (S)-styrene oxide. FAD is recycled by a NADH-dependent oxidoreductase
  StyB. StyA is usually part of a gene cluster that allows further degradation via
  a “classical” (A) or glutathione-dependent (B) pathway to the central intermediate
  phenylacetic acid, which is funneled via several steps into the TCA cycle.
