caption: 'A scenario of cytokine-stimulated gene transcription mediated by the signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation pathway is shown.
  One of the core factors of the altered secretory profile of senescent fibroblasts
  is the cytokine IL-6, a major activator of the STAT3 pathway. A: IL-6 binding to
  the IL-6R on the fibroblast surface initiates an activation cascade. B: STAT3 recruitment
  to Janus kinase 1 (JAK) (not shown), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, results in STAT3
  phosphorylation, dimerization, and translocation to the nucleus to mediate the transcription
  of target genes. C: persistent feedback loop potentially influencing autocrine and
  paracrine signaling has been identified where by STAT3-mediated transcription of
  sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1) induces pSTAT3 through Jak2 activation
  (). This positive feedback loop is thought to constituently activate STAT3, upregulating
  IL-6 transcription, ultimately resulting in its release to the local environment.
  A negative feedback mechanism for STAT3 does exist and is mediated by the suppressors
  of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins (); however, loss of this negative feedback
  loop has been shown to be a feature of disease (), and the SOCS/STAT3 silencing
  mechanism has also been reported to be diminished in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-derived
  fibroblasts ().'
