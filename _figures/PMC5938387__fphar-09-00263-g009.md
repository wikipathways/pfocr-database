caption: A schematic pathway illustrating the protective effects of STS against CS-induced
  COPD in mice. STS decreases the phosphorylation of ERK, p38 MAPK and JNK, which
  is responsible for HIF-1α down-regulation, resulting in protection against inflammatory
  responses, oxidative stress, emphysema and lung function decline in CS-exposed lungs.
