caption: The abundance of each metabolite and hormone is represented by a heat map.
  The grayed metabolites were not detected. The relative changes in the metabolites
  levels at callus and RS stage were calculated by determining callus/cotyledon or
  RS/cotyledon ratio of individual metabolites for each genotype. Log2 ratios of fold
  changes are given by shades of different colours depicted in scale bar (-20 ↔ +20)
  on top left-hand corner. In the metabolic pathway, sugars (red), amino acids (black),
  organic acids (green), fatty acids (yellow), monoamines (pink), nucleotides (green),
  hydroxycinnamic acids (brown) and phytohormones (blue) are shown with respective
  color. The solid arrow indicates direct conversion between metabolites, the bidirectional
  arrow shows inter-changeable metabolites, two arrows signify metabolite conversion
  includes two to three steps and the long dotted arrow indicates conversion includes
  more than three steps.
