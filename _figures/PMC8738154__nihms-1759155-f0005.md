caption: Distinct activities of the MAPK and PI3K pathways and suggestive treatment
  approaches in NF1-mutant (NF1-MT) colorectal cancer. In the presence of inactivating
  NF1 mutations, activated RAS constructively promotes both the MAPK pathway and the
  parallel PI3K pathway. NF1-MT tumors more frequently harbor mutations of PIK3CA
  (25.0% vs 16.7%) and PTEN (24.0% vs 4.2%) than NF1-wild type (NF1-WT) tumors, which
  may contribute to activation of the PI3K pathway. It is possible that these molecular
  backgrounds underlie resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in NF1-MT tumors. Although
  MEK inhibitors can only inhibit the MAPK pathway, a combination with PI3K/AKT inhibitors
  may be more efficient because such treatments can also block the parallel PI3K pathway
  of escape from MEK inhibition in NF1-MT tumors.
