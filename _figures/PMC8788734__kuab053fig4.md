caption: 'The organization of the rif cluster and proposed regulation mechanisms.
  (A) Schematic representation of the ∼90 kb rif cluster of Amycolatopsis mediterranei
  U32 organized in 10 operons encoding for the synthesis of the precursor AHBA; assembly
  and modification of the polyketide backbone, downstream, conversion, and export
  of rifamycin; and regulatory expression genes. (B) Schematic representation of the
  regulation of the rif cluster by the global regulator RifZ and proposed indirect
  regulation of the rif cluster by GlnR. The role of GlnR in the direct regulation
  of the expression of the AHBA synthase enzyme encoded by rifK, results in the increased
  biosynthesis of AHBA. The proposed role of RifQ on the expression of rifamycin transporter
