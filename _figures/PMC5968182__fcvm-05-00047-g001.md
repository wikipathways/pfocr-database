caption: Hypothetical roles of linear and circular ANRIL lncRNA in regulating inflammation
  and cell survival in human vascular endothelial cells and potential drug targets.
  TNF-α triggers NF-κB activation, which induces ANRIL transcription (). Linear ANRIL
  can be converted to circular ANRIL (). Linear ANRIL interacts with the transcription
  factor yin yang-1 (YY1) to form a functional complex that binds to and regulates
  expression of target genes such as IL-6/8. Circular ANRIL interacts with pescadillo
  homologue 1 (PES1) to form a complex with the pre-ribosomal assembly complex, that
  impairs ribosome biogenesis, leading to activation of p53 and a subsequent increase
  in apoptosis and decrease in the proliferative rate (). This pathway may promote
  atheroprotection by eliminating over-proliferating cells in atherosclerotic plaques.
  Neither TNFα nor NF-κB antagonists do seem suitable for wide-spread use in anti-inflammatory
  therapies of PD or CAD, because of their serious side effects. Since ANRIL is located
  downstream of TNFα and NF-κB, ANRIL or its downstream targets may be better suited
  as drug targets to inhibit the pro-inflammatory activities linked to this signaling
  pathway [modified according to ref. ()].
