caption: 'Metabolic pathways in the synthesis of omega-6 and omega-3 FAs. Omega-6
  and omega-3 are shown with their common/scientific names, their abbreviations used
  in this study and their chemical structure (length of carbon chain: number of unsaturated
  bonds). Metabolic stages are labelled with E for elongation with two carbon atoms,
  β for beta oxidation or Δ-5 or Δ-6 indicating desaturation at positions 5 and 6
  from the carboxyl terminus. The two isomers for docosapentaenoic and tetracosapentaenoic
  acids have been arbitrarily labelled as α or β for the omega-3 or omega-6 variants,
  respectively. There is an equivalent pathway for omega-9 FAs (not shown) starting
  with oleic acid (18:1) converting to mead acid (22:3) via Δ-6, elongation, Δ-5 and
  elongation stages.'
