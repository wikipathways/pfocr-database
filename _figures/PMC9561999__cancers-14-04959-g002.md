caption: 'Effect of UA on fructose metabolism in liver. Phosphorylation of fructose
  in liver is catalyzed by fructokinase (enzyme 1), which is not subjected to feedback
  inhibition and phosphorylates fructose as rapidly as it can, leading to intracellular
  ATP and phosphate depletion. The formed fructose-1-phospahte is cleaved by aldolase
  B (enzyme 2) into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde (GA). GA
  is phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P) (triokinase, enzyme 3), which
  can enter the glycolytic pathway or can be converted by triose phosphate isomerase
  (enzyme 4) into DHAP. In turn, DHAP, by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (enzyme
  5), is reduced to glycerol-3-phosphate (Gly-3-P), which contributes to the synthesis
  of triglycerides. As a consequence of ATP catabolism, AMP is generated. The deamination
  of AMP, catalyzed by AMP deaminase (enzyme 6), is accelerated, and AMP is channeled
  towards IMP, which is hydrolyzed by cytosolic-5’-nucleotidase II (enzyme 7) to inosine
  (Ino). In turn, Ino is phosphorolytically cleaved into hypoxanthine (Hyp) and ribose-1-phosphate
  (Rib-1-P) by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (enzyme 8). Rib-1-P can be mutated
  to ribose-5-phosphate and then converted to 5-phosphoribosyl-1- pyrophosphate (see
  ), thus contributing to the increase in purine de novo synthesis. Hyp, through the
  action of xanthine oxidoreductase (oxidase, enzyme 9 or dehydrogenase, enzyme 10),
  is converted to UA. UA exerts an inhibitory effect on AMPK (see Figure 4) and an
  activatory effect (through stimulation of ChREBP) on fructokinase (enzyme 1). UA
  also activates aldose reductase (enzyme 11) (through stimulation of NFAT5), enabling
  endogenous fructose production from glucose. In addition, UA promotes the translocation
  of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) from cytosol to mitochondria, which increases mitochondrial
  ROS generation with inactivation of aconitase (enzyme 12). Citrate is released by
  the mitochondrion and then converted back, by cytosolic ATP-citrate lyase (enzyme
  13), to acetyl-CoA, necessary for the synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides.
