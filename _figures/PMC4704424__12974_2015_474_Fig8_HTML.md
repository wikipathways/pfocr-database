caption: 'Diagram showing that the proposed CXCL5-mediated signaling pathway, triggered
  by LPS-sensitized HI, CXCL5-sensitized HI, or CXCL5 alone, plays a crucial role
  in neuroinflammation and BBB disruption and subsequent white matter injury in the
  immature brain. Neuroinflammation and BBB damage are two mutually potentiating mechanisms
  leading to sustained neuroinflammation and BBB disruption in white matter injury
  of the developing brain. White matter injury can be induced by different neuroinflammatory
  mechanisms: predominant microglial activation by LPS-sensitized HI, microglial activation
  and neutrophil infiltration by CXCL5-sensitized HI, and predominant neutrophil infiltration
  by CXCL5 alone'
