caption: Tryptophan metabolism in astrocytes, microglia and 5HT neuron. Tryptophan,
  precursor of serotonin is transported to brain with the aid of non-specific competitive
  L-type amino acid transporters. At homeostatic conditions tryptophan is metabolized
  to KA in astrocytes and 5HT in serotonergic neurons. KA is an NMDA and α7nAch receptor
  antagonist, hence acts as anti-excitotoxic and anticonvulsant, thus provide neuroprotection.
  Increased activation of inflammatory cascades either by psychological stress and
  LPS activates microglia (microgliosis). Increased inflammation due to psychological
  stress or LPS activates the enzymes of neurotoxic branch of kynurenine pathway in
  microglia. This leads to increased production of QA. Psychological stress and activation
  of inflammatory cascades diverts the metabolism of tryptophan towards QA. This shift
  hampers the neuroprotection provided by KA and decreases synthesis of 5HT in serotonergic
  neurons thus contribute to the depression pathophysiology. TRP, tryptophan; IDO,
