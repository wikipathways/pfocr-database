caption: The shown anti-hypoxia—A2-adenosinergic drugs exist since fortuitously they
  have been developed for other therapeutic indications. 1) The inhibitors of hypoxia-HIF1
  alpha stage –including the inhibitors of HIF-1alpha-can be used in order to weaken
  the hypoxia and promote the destabilization and degradation of HIF-1alpha in anti-tumor
  T and NK cells. 2) Blockers or inhibitors of CD39 ecto-ATPase/ADPase and CD73 5′-nucleotidase
  may be used to prevent the accumulation of extracellular adenosine in TME and thereby
  decrease the intensity of immunosuppressive signaling through A2AR or A2BR. 3) The
  commercially available stabilized adenosine deaminase preparations may be tested
  to degrade the extracellular adenosine. Alternatively, the enzymes such as adenosine
  kinase may be tested for the ability to decrease the levels of extracellular adenosine
  by re-phosphorylating it into AMP. 4) Antagonists of A2A adenosine receptor compete
  with the tissue-produced adenosine for binding to the same binding site of adenosine
  receptor, but –in contrast to endogenously generated adenosine, antagonists do not
  activate the A2AR receptor to increase the intracellular cAMP levels.
