caption: Schematic model of the proposed mechanisms of this study. Compared with LM
  breast cancer cells, the exosomes released by HM breast cancer cells are rich in
  EPHA2. Exosomal EPHA2 is delivered from HM breast cancer cells to endothelial cells
  and mediates activation of the Ephrin A1-EPHA2 forward signaling, which further
  activates the downstream AMPK-HIF-1α signaling pathway and promotes angiogenesis.
