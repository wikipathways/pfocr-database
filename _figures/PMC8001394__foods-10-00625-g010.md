caption: A summary of post-harvest UV-C application regulating the quality development
  of grape berries. The gene transcription part mainly included ROS homeostasis, hormone
  synthesis pathway, transcriptional regulatory factors, and quality component-related
  metabolism. Hormones and transcriptional regulators with obvious changing patterns
  and the differential metabolic pathways commonly present in the two cultivars after
  UV-C treatment were all listed in the summary. In the metabolites section, flavonoids
  and other differential metabolites (the top three most significant metabolites in
  the pos and neg modes according to the p-value) were listed. Green represents the
  upregulated transcription or accumulation level, while red represents the downregulated
  transcription or accumulation level. Purple represents a significant difference
  compared to the control.
