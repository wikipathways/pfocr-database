caption: Following their import into the IMS by the TOM complex, matrix proteins pass
  through the IM-embedded TIM23 (translocase of the inner membrane 23) complex, the
  central junction for the import of matrix proteins. TIM23 is composed of Tim23 and
  its subunits Tim17 and Tim50, and also interacts with components of the PAM complex
  (Tim21, Tim44, Pam16 and Pam18) (1). Proteins associate with Hsp70 bound to the
  matrix side of TIM23 and are translocated across the IM (2). The incoming proteins
  are cleaved by MPP, and the activity of Hsp70 is regulated by the nucleotide exchange
  factor Mge1 (3).
