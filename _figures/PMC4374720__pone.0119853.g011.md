caption: SA blocks electron flow, and inhibits the function of mtETC components such
  as CYT pathway, resulting in increased mtROS. On one hand, mtROS causes mitochondrial
  dysfunction associated with morphology transition and depolarization of membrane
  potential. On the other, the expression of the unique alternative components of
  mtETC (AOX) appears to increase in response to discruptions in respiratory homeostasis,
  and further, AOX contributes to defense response to invading pathogens in whole
  plants.
