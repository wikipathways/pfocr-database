caption: a Target gene induction may depend on the dynamics of signaling pathway activation,
  such as the duration, frequency, or area under the curve of pathway activity. In
  such cases, the signal-decoding circuitry may be thought of as a dynamic filter.
  b Target gene induction may also depend on the combination of pathways that are
  activated, such that signal decoding may be thought of as implementing a logic gate.
  c The induction of Fos protein is a canonical example of dynamic decoding, where
  sustained but not transient pulse of Erk results in protein accumulation. Erk-mediated
  regulation of FOS transcription, fos mRNA stability, and Fos protein stability is
  thought to mediate this response. d IL-2 induction by T cell stimulation and co-stimulation
  is thought to occur via combinatorial control. Neither TCR nor CD28 alone are sufficient
  for protein output but the two together allow for accumulation of IL-2 protein through
  a multi-step circuit.
