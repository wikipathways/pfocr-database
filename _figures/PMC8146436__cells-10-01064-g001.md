  (OEs), PLDα1 was induced upon cold stress, causing a decrease in the ratio of PC
  to PA leading to membrane instability and freezing sensitivity []. In contrast,
  transgenic Arabidopsis Class I AtACBP6-OEs were conferred freezing tolerance via
  the PLDδ-mediated pathway in rosettes and the ABA-mediated pathway in flowers, resulting
  in changes in lipids, sugars and stress-related genes [,]. During drought, transgenic
  Arabidopsis Class II AtACBP2-OEs exhibited elevated AtAREB1 and AtRBOHF expression

  salinity, AtACBP1 and AtAREB1 expression were upregulated in wild-type seeds [].
  The overexpression of AtACBP1 in transgenic Arabidopsis triggers nuclear translocation

  AtAREB1 target genes (PKS5 and RAB18), thereby promoting stronger ABA responses
