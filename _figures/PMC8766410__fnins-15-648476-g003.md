caption: Adenosinergic signaling as a therapeutic target for GB treatment. (1) After
  hypoxia or other insults, microglia and astrocytes become reactive, contributing
  to the release of ATP into the extracellular space. (2) Our hypothesis is that rapid
  conversion of ATP to ADO via CD73 activity expressed by both tumor cells and A2-astrocytes
  in the TME promote immune escape. (3) ADO can sensitize P1 receptors, mainly A2AR,
  contributing to the maintenance of escape from immune surveillance, and consequently,
  increasing tumor malignancy and progression. (4) ADO promotes an immunosuppressive
  TME, which inhibits T lymphocyte recruitment and induces M2-like macrophage/microglia
  polarization. (5) In contrast, a therapeutic approach blocking CD73 may alter this
  entire pathway, (6) leading to decreased extracellular ADO. (7) A decreased ADO
  concentration in the TME may contribute to A1-astrocyte polarization and consequent
  impairment of tumor growth. A1-astrocytes overexpress A1R, A2BR, and A3R, but this
  effect has not been elucidated in tumors. (8) In summary, a therapeutic approach
  aimed at blocking adenosinergic signaling would establish an immune-attractive tumor
  microenvironment, resulting in the recruitment of effective immune cells to combat
  tumor cells. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ADO, adenosine;
