caption: Ionizing radiation leads to the release of tumor associated antigens (TAA)
  and damaged DNA that can stimulate the production of type-I interferon via the cGAS/STING
  pathway in tumor cells. The subsequent secretion of IFN-I and interferon-stimulated
  genes (including CXCL10) promote the recruitment and activation of BATF3-DCs. Once
  in the tumor, BATF3-DCs take up the TAA and tumor-derived DNA to further stimulate
  the production of IFN-I. Activated BATF3-DCs then migrate to the tumor draining
  lymph node where they can prime CD8+ T cells to initiate cytotoxic T-cell responses.
  Once activated, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) migrate to the irradiated tumor and
  eliminate residual cancer cells, and to distant metastatic sites leading to systemic
  tumor regression (abscopal effect).
