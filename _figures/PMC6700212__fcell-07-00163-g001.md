caption: Dual sequential cell death checkpoints in the TNFR1 signaling pathway. (A)
  In most cells, binding of TNF to its receptor TNFR1 does not trigger cell death.
  This is due to the presence of two sequential cell death checkpoints. The early
  checkpoint occurs rapidly following TNFR1 ligation when RIPK1 is conjugated with
  K63- and M1-linked poly-ubiquitin chains catalyzed by the TRAF2/cIAP1/2 and LUBAC
  E3 ligases, respectively. When this occurs, RIPK1 functions as pro-survival signaling
  molecule and does not associate with the FADD/CASPASE 8 death-signaling complex.
  This early checkpoint is reinforced by IKK-mediated phosphorylation of RIPK1 and
  CYLD to further inhibit their death-signaling capabilities. The late checkpoint
  occurs when NFκB translocates to the nucleus to upregulate expression of pro-survival
  genes. The two checkpoints function in different ways to protect cells from death;
  the early checkpoint does not require de novo gene transcription whereas the later
  checkpoint does. (B) The early checkpoint fails when RIPK1 ubiquitination is disrupted.
  This happens when the ubiquitin E3 ligases (e.g., TRAF2, cIAP1/2, LUBAC) is inhibited
  or deleted. An increase in the activity of deubiquitinases (e.g., CYLD), which remove
  ubiquitin from RIPK1, can similarly lead to the disruption of the early checkpoint.
  Impaired ubiquitination of RIPK1 leads to its association with FADD and CASPASE
  8 to initiate apoptosis, or with RIPK3 to induce necroptosis if apoptosis is inhibited.
  We use the term ripoptocide to denote this RIPK1-dependent death, which can lead
  to inflammation.
