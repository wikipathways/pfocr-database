caption: A proposed model showing the concerted effects of ATP and OGA on plant cell
  signal transduction pathways mediating stress, wound and defense responses. Wounding
  releases ATP and OGA into the plant cell wall space, each binding to distinct receptors.
  Activation of the ATP receptor leads to an influx of calcium from the ECM through
  a cation channel (either directly or indirectly), whereas activation of the OGA
  receptor leads to a release of calcium from unknown internal stores []. Downstream
  production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) could represent a point of convergence,
  inducing an increase in the levels of the stress hormone ethylene. MAPK family members
  likely interact with the signaling pathway at multiple points [–], and it is the
  concerted effects of all of these signaling mechanisms that ultimately alter gene
  expression. The dotted line refers to post-translational regulation of key wound
  and stress enzymes by MAPK activity.
