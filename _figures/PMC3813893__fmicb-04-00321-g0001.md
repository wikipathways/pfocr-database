caption: Mechanisms of action of cationic antitumor peptides. (1) Modification of
  the lysosome membrane leading to an acidification of the intracellular environment
  and cell death. (2) Amplification of the proteasome activity. (3) Induction of mitochondrial
  pathway of apoptosis by either the cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm or activation
  of the caspase cascade. (4) Pore formation by the carpet model. (5) Increase of
  the influx of Ca2+. (6) Formation of pore by either the toroidal or the barrel-stave
  models. (7) Activation of an immune modulatory pathway by induction of NK and IFN.
  (8) Inhibition of genes involved in DNA replication. (9) Arrest of cell cycle G0,
  G1, or S phases. Lfcin, lactoferrcin; BMAP, bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide;
  Cr-AMP, Chlorella pyrenoidosa antitumor polypeptide.
