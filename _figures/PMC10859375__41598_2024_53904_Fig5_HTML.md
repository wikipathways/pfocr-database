  muscle of broiler chickens. Cells are metabolically stimulated by oxidized low-density
  lipoproteins to activate PPARγ signaling pathway, which boosts lipid uptake and
  synthesis intracellularly to process excessive surrounding lipids. [oxLDL: oxidized
  low-density lipoproteins; FA: fatty acids; TAG: triacylglycerol; FC: free cholesterol;
