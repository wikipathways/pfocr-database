caption: A. Long-term exposure to NNK and arecoline synergistically increased anti-apoptotic
  activity via the EGFR/AKT pathway. B. Such exposure also synchronized the induction
  of the EMT phenomenon with morphological alterations via NFκB/Snail signaling, ultimately
  leading to tumor progression, drug resistance, and stemness.
