caption: 'Circadian rhythms are driven by a vast network of oscillators regulated
  by multiple interconnected feedback loops that, in turn, synchronize the entire
  organism. Here, we show a simplified system with three interconnected components:
  the hypothalamus, brain stem/spinal cord, and the periphery (including behavioral
  rhythms as feeding/fasting and activity/rest). In the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic
  nucleus (SCN) sends synchronizing signals to different hypothalamic areas such as
  the medial preoptic (MPO), paraventricular (PVN), dorsomedial (DMH), and the arcuate
  (ARC) nuclei. All these are interconnected and send feedback information to the
  SCN. In addition, PVN efferences connect to two main endocrine outputs: (1) a polysynaptic
  pathway relaying in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) which controls the production
  and release of melatonin from the pineal gland via its sympathetic innervation and
  (2) the secretion of corticotrophin-releasing hormone, acting on the pituitary for
  the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (HPA axis) and controlling adrenal glucocorticoids
  (corticosterone in rodents). The SCN exert a circadian control on PVN outputs for
  most autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions, driven at the brain stem/medulla
  through parasympathetic motoneurons in the vagal dorsal motor nucleus (DMV), and
  by sympathetic motoneurons in the intermediolateral column (IML). The nucleus tractus
  solitarius (NTS) acts as an integrative center for signals coming from the hypothalamus,
  peripheral ANS reflexes transmitted to the DMN and the IML, and feedback to the
  hypothalamus (not shown). Blood-borne factors like glucose, feeding/fasting regulatory
  hormones and, factors derived from physical exercise, can modulate circadian rhythms
  at peripheral organs, as well as regulate the ANS feedback to the hypothalamus.'
