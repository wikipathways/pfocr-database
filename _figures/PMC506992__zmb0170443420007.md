caption: Model of MUC20 suppression. (A) A MUC20 monomer has less ability to associate
  with Met. In this condition, Grb2 is recruited to HGF-activated Met, followed by
  activation of signaling cascades leading to proliferation. (B) MUC20 oligomerization
  caused by either an overproduction of MUC20 or an unknown endogenous factor(s) leads
  to the association with Met, blocking Grb2 recruitment to Met and suppressing the
  Grb2-Ras pathway, but does not affect Gab1 recruitment. The oligomerizing domain
  in MUC20 is referred to as the self-oligomerizing domain (SOD). PLCγ, phospholipase
  C-γ.
