caption: A potential role for PRC in orchestrating a balance between cell cycle entry
  and the inflammatory response to metabolic stress. (Panel A) Under normal conditions
  (green pathway), PRC protein levels are transiently upregulated during entry to
  the cell cycle. This coincides with the normal initiation of cell growth or as a
  response to serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts. In this capacity PRC is
  thought to activate genes encoding the respiratory chain and other growth-related
  functions through interactions with its target transcription factors. Alternatively,
  PRC protein levels can be induced in response to severe metabolic stress (red pathway)
  brought about by nutrient starvation or chemical uncoupling. This is associated
  with the activation of an antioxidant-sensitive inflammatory/stress program possibly
  leading to abnormal proliferation or cell death. Genes from this program have been
  associated with the tumor microenvironment and with cellular senescence. (Panel
  B) Evidence for elevated PRC protein levels in some solid tumors. A commercial immunoblot
  from DNA Technologies containing protein samples from several different tumors and
  the adjacent normal tissue was probed with affinity-purified rabbit anti-PRC antibody
  or rabbit anti-Tfam. The results show a robust PRC signal in breast, lung and liver
  tumors compared to modest expression in the surrounding normal tissue. Surprisingly,
  the PRC signal from breast tumor migrated at a higher molecular mass. The Tfam control
  was expressed at much reduced levels in several tumor samples compared to the surrounding
  tissue possibly reflecting the decreased mitochondrial mass associated with the
  glycolytic nature of many tumors.
