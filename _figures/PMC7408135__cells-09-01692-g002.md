caption: Ether phospholipid synthesis pathway in peroxisomes. The blue line indicates
  the peroxisome membrane. Membrane transporters are shown in light blue boxes. Enzymes
  that catalyze the metabolic reactions are in beige boxes. Genes that are dysregulated
  in cancer are red. The representative structure of plasmalogen, a final product
  of ether phospholipids with initial synthesis steps that are processed in peroxisomes,
  is in the right corner. G3P—glycerol 3-phosphate; DHAP—dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
