caption: After insulin binds to the insulin receptor, autophosphorylation of tyrosine
  residues in the intracellular subunit of each of the receptors causes docking and
  phosphorylation of Irs1/Irs2, followed by activation of the downstream kinase cascades,
  such as the PI3K/Akt pathway. For induction of SREBP1c, mTORC1 activation and concomitant
  inhibition of FoxO1 via the PI3K/Akt pathway are required. In addition to the DAG-PKCε
  pathway inhibiting physiological phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, hyperinsulinemia
  leads to downregulation of hepatic Irs2 expression, resulting in the progression
  of hepatic insulin resistance. GLUT2 is the major glucose transporter in hepatocytes.
  In response to an increase in the intracellular glucose concentration, ChREBP induces
  expression of various genes related to lipogenic enzymes, independent of insulin
  signaling. Due to elevated Irs1 expression in the perivenous (PV) zone, which is
  the primary site of lipogenesis, insulin signaling is rather enhanced in the presence
  of hyperinsulinemia despite the downregulation of Irs2, resulting in increased lipogenesis
  and development of steatosis. Independent of insulin signaling, ER stress also activates
  SREBP through increased cleavage of S1P by caspase-2.
