caption: Various mechanisms contribute to cyst formation in renal tubules including
  loss of cilia and/or ciliary function, increased cell proliferation or abnormal
  apical-basal polarity. It was also proposed that lack of PCP protein function might
  contribute to cystogenesis. Accumulated experimental data have shown that core PCP
  proteins are polarized along the tubular axis in the developing kidneys, and that
  PCP signaling tightly controls the tubular diameter via CE and OCD. However, loss
  of core PCP proteins does not lead to cyst formation.
