  for proliferative diseases including cancer and autoimmune disorders, for instance
  by the approved drug mycophenolic acid, and as a broad spectrum antiviral by Ribavirin.
  While Ribavirin has activity against SARS in vitro, it has low tolerability, something
  that might be addressed by the more selective Merimepodib, which is in phase II
  clinical trials. (c) The mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a master

  to Rapamycin, the mTOR pathway can be indirectly modulated by metformin, a widely
  prescribed diabetes drug, and by Sapanisertib, a drug in clinical trials for solid
  tumors.
