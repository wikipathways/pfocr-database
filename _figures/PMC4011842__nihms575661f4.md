caption: The functional importance of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs)
  and VEGF receptors — that is, neuropilins (NRPs) and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs) — that are expressed by tumour cells, in particular those that are expressed
  by cancer stem cells (beige cells), provides an important opportunity for the development
  of new therapeutic approaches, especially for highly aggressive tumours. These approaches
  have the potential to promote tumour regression and to improve the response to standard
  chemotherapy and radiation therapy. So far, strategies that inhibit VEGF signalling
  have primarily focused on targeting angiogenesis using either bevacizumab to inhibit
  VEGF or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target VEGF RTKs such as VEGF receptor
  2 (VEGFR2). NRPs are becoming recognized as crucial effectors of autocrine VEGF
  signalling in tumours, and more emphasis should be placed on targeting them therapeutically.
  Although some side effects were observed during the initial clinical use of a humanized
  NRP1 antibody, targeting NRPs is still a potentially effective strategy, and approaches
  need to be developed that minimize these side effects. It is also important to note
  that bevacizumab does not inhibit the binding of VEGF to NRPs, which highlights
  the importance of targeting NRPs directly and developing VEGF-specific reagents
  (such as placental growth factor (PLGF)-specific antibodies) that inhibit NRP binding.
  Targeting NRPs can result in compensatory signalling by other growth factor receptors,
  which indicates the potential importance of using a combination therapy. This possibility
  is shown by the compensatory insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signalling
  that occurs in prostate cancer, and it is likely that other mechanisms of compensation
  in response to VEGF pathway inhibition will be discovered for other tumour cells.
  These approaches may benefit from the use of conventional chemotherapy to reduce
  overall tumour burden.
