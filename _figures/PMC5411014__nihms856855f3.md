caption: Pathophysiology and management of CVD. Certain genetic, environmental and
  behavioral risk factors cause an increase in venous hydrostatic pressure in the
  lower extremity saphenous and femoral veins leading to valve dysfunction and venous
  reflux. Increased venous hydrostatic pressure also increases vein wall tension leading
  to increases in MMPs. Increased venous hydrostatic pressure could also cause endothelial
  cell injury, increased permeability, leukocyte infiltration, and increased adhesion
  molecules, inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to further
  increases in MMPs. Increased MMPs may cause VSM hyperpolarization and relaxation
  as well as ECM degradation leading to vein wall dilation, valve dysfunction and
  progressive increases in venous hydrostatic pressure (vicious cycle). Increased
  MMPs generally promote ECM degradation particularly in atrophic regions. Other theories
  (indicated by interrupted arrows) suggest a compensatory anti-inflammatory pathway
  involving prostaglandins and their receptors that leads to decreased MMPs and thereby
  ECM accumulation, particularly in hypertrophic regions of VVs. Persistent valve
  dysfunction, and progressive vein wall dilation and tortuosity lead to different
  stages of CVD and CVI. Current treatment of CVD and CVI (presented in shaded arrows)
  includes physical, pharmacological and surgical approaches. Inhibitors of the activity
  or action of MMPs (also presented in shaded arrows) may provide potential tools
  for the management of CVD/CVI.
