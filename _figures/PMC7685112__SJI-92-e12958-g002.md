caption: 'Pathogenesis of PR3+ AAV—plausible mechanisms:Predisposition is likely a
  multifactorial process, influenced by (A) environmental factors, for example exposure
  to smoke, dust and radiations and/or (B) molecular mimicry due to exposure of antigens
  from bacteria, for example S. aureus derived cPR3 peptides and/or (C) genetic factors
  including HLA‐DPB1*04:01 and endogenous exposure of autoantigens by increased NETosis
  and defects in clearance of apoptotic bodies and/or (D) other infections due to
  known/unknown agents. Immune triggering includes activation of CD4+ T cells following
  recognition of cPR3/PR3/other antigens presented on APCs complexed with HLA‐DP.
  Such T cells can differentiate into either tissue‐resident memory cells or effector
  cells (Th1, Th17, TFH) and perform various effector functions, including helping
  B cells in generating cPR3/PR3‐specific antibodies. Disease development: Neutrophils
  can be activated and release endogenous PR3 (stored in azurophilic granules) to
  their membrane or by generating net‐like structures to engage the neighbouring endothelial
  cells. This membrane form of PR3 has been proposed to be a major antigenic target
  in the disease. Dying cells can trigger different levels of disease manifestations
  ranging from tissue damage to inflammation and granuloma formation. Organ manifestations
  include ear, nose, throat, upper respiratory tract, lungs, cardiovascular system
  or kidneys, and affected sites can have cell infiltrates containing pathogenic T
  and B cells as well as innate immune cells secreting pro‐inflammatory cytokines.
  Treatment strategies: The clinical goal is drug‐free remission. Higher relapse rates
  associate with specific organ manifestations and PR3‐ANCA titres. DMARDs or cyclophosphamide
  can potently reduce inflammation, and complement system component C5a blocking is
  a new pathway under investigation. To completely avoid relapse, a strategy to eradicate
  the disease‐specific immune memory would be warranted, for example by targeting
  the autoreactive cells. However, these cells are still incompletely explored'
