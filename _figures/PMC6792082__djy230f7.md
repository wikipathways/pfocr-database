caption: Targeting NRF2 antioxidant pathway for IDH1-mutated cancers. IDHWT cells
  exhibit normal reactive oxygen species (ROS) burden. NRF2 is recognized by KEAP1
  and constitutively removed through proteasomal degradation. In IDH1R132H cells,
  elevated ROS burden leads to NRF2 stabilization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional
  activation of antioxidant genes. NRF2 downstream genes not only assist ROS homeostasis
  in IDH1-mutated cancer but also serve as potential resistance mechanism for chemotherapies.
