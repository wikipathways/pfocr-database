caption: Proposed model for the signaling pathway of PLC-γ1 activation mediating calcium-induced
  human keratinocyte differentiation. Calcium (Ca2+) binding to the calcium receptor
  (CaR) () stimulates src and fyn, which activate PI3K via phosphorylation of p85α
  leading to PIP3 accumulation. PIP3 and then stimulates PLC-γ1 activity, which increases
  IP3 production. Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) release from endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) and Golgi stores mediated by IP3 binding to the IP3 receptor (IP3R) triggers
  human keratinocyte differentiation.
