caption: Schematic summary.A, WT macrophages ingest IgG-opsonized human red blood
  cells (IgG-hRBCs) with high efficiency via rapid (2–3 min) phagocytic cup formation,
  which includes extension of ruffles, especially peripheral ruffles. Phagocytic cup
  formation after application of IgG–RBCs is abrogated in both Fcer1g−/− macrophages,
  which lack the Fc receptor γ chain, and NOTAM macrophages, which express a mutant
  Fc receptor γ chain with a nonsignaling ITAM. Phagocytic cups are also lacking in
  Syk conditional KO (cKO) macrophages. In contrast, phagocytic cups become elongated
  and cylindrical in Itgb2−/− (complement receptor 3 [CR3] KO) macrophages presented
  with IgG–hRBCs. A model of the signal transduction underlying Fcγ receptor (FcγR)–mediated
  phagocytosis is shown on the right. Note that phagocytic cups can form upon a filopodium
  and cup closure can pinch off the tips of cells, as shown in the lower panel. B,
  whereas FcγRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV associate with the FcR γ chain, which contains
  an ITAM, the inhibitory FcγR (FcγRIIb) contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytosolic tail. Phagocytic cup formation was less
  efficient in NOTAM macrophages (which have surface expression of all four FcγRs,
  but lack a functional ITAM) than WT macrophages, but largely blocked in Fcer1g−/−
  (FcR γ chain KO) macrophages, which do not express surface FcγRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV.
  Thus, in Fcer1g−/− macrophages, FcγRIIb has less competition for binding to opsonic
  IgG, which would promote ITIM signaling, as shown in the model on the right. C,
  WT macrophages ingest dual IgM– and complement C3b/iC3b–opsonized hRBCs via phagocytic
  cup formation, extended ruffles, and varying degrees of sinking. Dual IgM– and C3b/iC3b–opsonized
  hRBCs are not ingested by Itgb2−/− (CR3 KO) macrophages, implying that CR3, rather
  than CRIg, induces phagocytic cup formation and sinking phagocytosis. Notably, IgM,
  in contrast to IgG, is not recognized by Fcγ receptors. CR3-mediated phagocytic
  cup formation, but not sinking phagocytosis, is abrogated in macrophages lacking
  Syk (Syk conditional KO [cKO] macrophages) or the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  activation motif (ITAM) adaptors FcR γ chain and DAP12 (Fcer1g/Tyrobp double KO
  [dKO] macrophages). The endocytic pathway during sinking phagocytosis is restricted
  in diameter and hRBCs, which are highly deformable, are squeezed into the cell interior,
  producing a characteristic intermediary hourglass morphology. A model of the signal
  transduction underlying CR3-mediated phagocytosis is shown on the right. IgG, immunoglobulin
  G; IgM, immunoglobulin M; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif;
  NOTAM, No ITAM.

  description: Schematic summary.A, WT macrophages ingest IgG-opsonized human red
