caption: Oxidative stress, defined by an imbalance between antioxidants (AOs) and
  ROS, ultimately leads to DNA damage, protein dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation,
  thereby contributing to the development of HACE. Figure adapted from Lee et al.
  (25) and Burtscher et al. (3). ① Hypoxia-induced ROS inhibit the degradation of
  Nrf2, thereby promoting its translocation into the nucleus. Following interaction
  with Maf proteins, this complex subsequently activates the expression of target
  genes. ② Hypoxia-induced ROS activate HIF, leading to increased expression of BNIP3L
  and promoting mitophagy. ③ ROS can also induce Ca2+ accumulation, which in turn
  activates the CaMKK-AMPK pathway, thereby reducing metabolic demand. ④ ROS induce
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, resulting in ER dysfunction and the accumulation
  of unfolded or misfolded proteins, initiating inflammatory responses. Additionally,
  it increases NF-κB levels and stimulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines,
  further triggering inflammatory responses
