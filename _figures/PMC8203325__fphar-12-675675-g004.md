caption: Schematic diagram of the NF-κB pathway. When the inflammatory factors such
  as tumor necrosis factor A/inteeleukin-1/Toll-like Receptors combine with the related
  receptors, they cause the configuration changes of the latter receptors, like RIP,
  NIK, or MEKKs. Then IKKs are activated, which can phosphorylate IκBα, and ubiquitination
  under the action of the ubiquitin ligase p-trcp. The ubiquitin ligase p-trcp can
  be recognized and degraded by 26S proteasome. Therefore, NF-κB can be released from
  the cytoplasm of NF-κB/IkBα complex, activate and expose the activate site domain,
  and rapidly transfer nucleus. Through P50 subunit binding with target genes, the
  expression of target genes such as TNF-α,IL-1.
