caption: 'Quantitation of chemotaxis signaling pathway proteins within mouse BMDMs.
  LC-PRM assays were performed to quantitate proteins of the chemotaxis signaling
  pathway. Some proteins were targeted but were not detected (white nodes), possibly
  because their abundance was below the limit of detection of the LC-MS. Selected
  clusters of nodes are indicated by encircled numbers: 1. G-protein coupled receptors,
  2. phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinases, 3. guanine nucleotide exchange
  factors, and 4. small GTPases. This signaling network is described in detail in
  our earlier article. n.d., not detected. n.t., not targeted.'
