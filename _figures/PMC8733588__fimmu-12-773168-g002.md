caption: Key mechanisms of resistance to anti-PD-1 inhibitors. The mechanisms of resistance
  including internal and external causes. The internal causes focus on the inherent
  characteristics of tumor cells, it includes defective tumor immunorecognition, epigenetic
  regulation, abnormal oncogenic signaling, and IFN-γ signal pathway. The external
  causes are mainly emanated from the tumor microenvironment, such as exhaustion of
  T cells, immunosuppressive cells and cytokines, tumor metabolites, new immune checkpoints,
  and intestinal microflora. B2M, B2-microglobulin; LAG3, lymphocyte-activation gene
  3; TIM3, T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 3; VEGF, vascular
  endothelial growth factor; JAK, Janus kinase.
