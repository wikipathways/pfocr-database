caption: 'Conceptual diagnostic framework and test delivery maze. A: The diagnostic
  test, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–authorized in vitro diagnostic (IVD)
  assay or self-developed laboratory-developed test (LDT), lives in the clinical testing
  environment [Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) –certified laboratory]
  where personnel apply their skill, knowledge, and experience to perform diagnostic
  procedures. Competency (assessment): six specific assessment procedures are the
  minimal regulatory requirement for competency for all personnel performing laboratory
  testing [42 CFR 493.1451(b)(8), Legal Information Institute, https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/493.1451,
  last accessed July 6, 2021]. The team is depicted using exemplary professional degrees
  and years of experience after training of the least experienced team member serving
  in each role. Proficiency (testing): testing of unknown samples (eg, sent to a laboratory
  by a US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)–approved testing program)
  and submission of laboratory results to the administrator of the program. Proficiency
  testing is a legal requirement for each nonwaived test and CLIA certificate (42
  CFR subchapter I). Proficiency testing is a tool to verify the accuracy and reliability
  of the entire testing process, including competency of the testing personnel. When
  an FDA-authorized IVD assay is implemented with a different (off-label) pre-analytic
  or postanalytic process, the entire diagnostic procedure requires establishing the
  performance (ie, validation), and the diagnostic test is considered an LDT. A laboratory
  typically has numerous diagnostic procedures (eg, using nasopharyngeal swab, anterior
  nasal swab, or saliva) that can be coupled to the same or different diagnostic tests
  (eg, LDT or IVD assay). The diagnostic procedures interface with a health care delivery
  system to form diagnostic services to establish and maintain best practices (including
  order entry and information about eligible sample types, service contracts, International
  Classification of Diseases, and Current Procedural Terminology coding processes,
  technical and professional billing, and payor operations). For any patient, the
  diagnostic quality relies on attributes of the diagnostic test, diagnostic procedure,
  and diagnostic service. B: To implement diagnostic tests (12 o''clock) for patient
  care (center court of the maze), laboratory directors must navigate through a maze
  of technical, professional, regulatory, and administrative hurdles. Depending on
  the diagnostic test and setting, the pathway will differ. The perimeter of the maze
  is formed by governing concepts, and the maze lists some of the relevant organizations.
  As depicted, the maze is solvable; however, when attempting to account for all relevant
  governing aspects of a specific diagnostic test, redundancy will be encountered.
  Redundancy can be regarded as an added benefit (eg, extra strength in case of failure)
  or as duplicative waste when not strictly necessary for functioning (eg, perceived
  as regulatory misalignment). AABB, American Association of Blood Banks; AAHHS, Accreditation
