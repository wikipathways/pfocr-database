caption: MC-GAG induces osteogenic differentiation of primary hMSCs via an autogenous
  activation of the canonical BMPR signaling pathway with phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8
  (Mechanism 1, green arrow). MC-GAG directly inhibits viability, proliferation, and
  resorptive activity of osteoclasts even in the absence of differentiating hMSCs
  (Mechanism 2A, red lines). MC-GAG also upregulates OPG expression through an ERK1/2
  dependent pathway, correlating to an indirect inhibition of resorptive activity
  but not viability or proliferation in co-culture with differentiating hMSCs (Mechanism
  2B, red arrows and lines).
