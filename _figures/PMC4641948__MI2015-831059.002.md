caption: Thrombin effects in endothelial cells involve S1P signaling. Activation of
  the classical thrombin receptor PAR-1 interrupts endothelial barrier integrity by
  induction of endothelial contraction through stimulation of G12/13 subunit and Rho
  signalling pathway (left). Conversely, thrombin also induces expression of SphK1
  and increases S1P generation. This involves PAR-1-induced signaling via activated
  protein C (APC) and the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR). S1P in turn transactivates
  S1PR1 leading to Gi-dependent activation of the Rac-1 signaling pathway. This effect
  improves endothelial integrity to counteract and limit thrombin-induced endothelial
  damage and vascular leakage (right).
