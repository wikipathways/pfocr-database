caption: The diagram depicting the regulation of OCN effects on FLHS via the JNK signaling
  pathway [25]. ucOCN exerts its protective function through the ROS–JNK signaling
  pathway. In the liver, excess triglycerides lead to increased ROS synthesis, consequently
  increasing cellular membrane injury, hepatocyte apoptosis, and inflammatory reaction
  and upregulating the JNK signaling pathway. OCN functionally alleviates hepatocyte
  injury and associated mitochondrial damage, ROS synthesis, and inflammatory cytokine
  production by inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway.
