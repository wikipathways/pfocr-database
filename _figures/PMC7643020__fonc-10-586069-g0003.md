caption: Mechanism of crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis. (A) Under normal
  cellular conditions, Beclin-1 binds to Bcl-2, keeping autophagy and apoptosis inactivated.
  (B) However, if the cell experiences low-level stress conditions (e.g., nutrient
  deprivation), JNK1 phosphorylates Bcl-2, disturbing Bcl-2/Beclin-1 union. As a result,
  isolated Beclin-1 activates the autophagic pathway. (C) However, if the stressful
  stimulus crosses a threshold of time, JNK1 promotes Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation,
  inducing its dissociation with Bax and the subsequent activation of the intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway. In addition, c-FLIP, a suppressor of extrinsic apoptosis, also
  inhibits autophagy through interaction with ATG3, reducing LC3 lipidation. Moreover,
  caspase activation mediates autophagy-related proteins, such as Beclin-1 and ATG5.
  Additionally, the C-terminal fragment generated by caspase-mediated cleavage of
  Beclin-1 translocates to the mitochondrial membrane and stimulates intrinsic apoptosis.
  Furthermore, ATG5, after cleavage by calpains, suppresses autophagy activity and
  induces apoptosis.
