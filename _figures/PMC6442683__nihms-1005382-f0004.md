caption: Within the dendritic spine, AMPA receptors (AMPARs) govern fast synaptic
  transmission in response to glutamatergic signalling. Glutamate binds to, and activates,
  AMPARs in response to synaptic activity. The resulting influx of sodium and potassium
  ions through the open channel results in depolarization. NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation
  occurs in response to glycine and glutamate binding concurrently with depolarization.
  In addition, depolarization results in the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels
  (VGCCs; including L-type, Cav1.2/1.3-containing channels). Depolarization and VGCC
  activation result in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) exocytosis. Calcium
  influx activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CAMKII), resulting
  in activation of GTPase signalling by phosphorylation of kalirin and/ or triple
  functional domain protein (TRIO). These guanine nucleotide exchange factors regulate
  RAS-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC)/transforming protein RhoA (RHOA)
  to alter cytoskeletal dynamics. GTPase activation can either increase (RAC pathway)
  or decrease (RHOA pathway) actin polymerization through serine/threonine protein
  kinase PAK (PAK) or Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathways to promote spine
  growth or retraction, respectively,. In addition, calcium results in the activation
  of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), phosphorylation of elongation
  factor 2 (EF2) at Thr56 (REF. ) and inhibition of BDNF translation at ribosomes.
  BDNF release results in the activation of the BDNF/NT3 growth factor receptor (TRKB;
  also known as NTRK2) and induction of the RAS pathway through growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2 (GRB2) and son of sevenless homologue 1 (SOS1; not shown), which in turn
  activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) and/
  or extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, contributing to long-term
  potentiation via AMPAR trafficking and membrane insertion within the spine. Many
  regulatory compounds targeting key synaptic signalling proteins have been isolated
  (indicated in the pink boxes). These, or other related small molecules, may have
  utility in neuropsychiatric disorders by regulating synaptic function and spine
  dynamics. CCBs, calcium channel blockers; FTIs, farnesyl transferase inhibitors;
  mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PAM, positive allosteric modulator; TARP, transmembrane
  AMPAR regulator protein. TRIPα, TRIO inhibitory aptamer; Question mark indicates
  unknown mechanism.
