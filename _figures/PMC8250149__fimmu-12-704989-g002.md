caption: Schematic representation of regulation of the NF-κB and IFN-I pathways and
  MHC I gene expression by NLRC5 (1) NLRC5 inhibits the NF-κB pathway by binding to
  IKKα/IKKβ subunits and blocking their phosphorylation. The expression of NLRC5 itself
  is regulated by NF-κB activation to form a negative regulatory feedback loop. (2)
  NLRC5 can also suppress RIG-like receptor-mediated IFN-I responses by interacting
  with RIG-I/MDA5. (3) Stimuli such as IFN-γ, viral infection, and bacterial infection
  induce NLRC5 to bind directly to the GAS site in the NLRC5 promoter by activating
  the STAT1 homologous dimer. Subsequently, NLRC5 shuttles from the cytoplasm to the
  nucleus and combines with the S-X-Y motif to form a potent enhanceosome and to induce
  MHC I transcription.
