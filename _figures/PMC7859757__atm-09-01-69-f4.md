caption: (a) ER stress can be triggered by alcohol, bile acids, pancreatic toxins,
  and increased protein synthesis. UPR is caused by an increase of misfolded or unfolded
  proteins in the ER. (b) ATF6 is transferred to the Golgi apparatus and is cleaved
  by S1P and S2P. The N-terminal transcription activation domain is released and transferred
  to the nucleus as a transcription factor to promote transcription of the target
  gene. (c) PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α shuts off mRNA translation, decreasing
  the protein folding load and preventing misfolded proteins from being accumulated.
  ATF4 upregulation can result in CHOP expression, inducing cell apoptosis. (d) When
  the IRE1 signaling pathway is activated, IRE1 excises a 26 nucleotide intron to
  form the XBP1s. The protein encoded by the XBP1 is rapidly degraded (ERAD), relieving
  ER stress. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; ATF, activating
  transcription factor; PERK, PRK-like ER kinase.
