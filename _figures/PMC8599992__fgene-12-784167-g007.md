caption: 'Current models of replication-coupled ICL repair by the NEIL3 glycosylase
  (left) and Fanconi anemia (right) pathways. Repair is activated when replisomes
  converge at the ICL. The NEIL3 pathway is preferentially activated by abasic and
  psoralen-induced crosslinks, whereas the Fanconi anemia pathway is activated by
  lesions caused by cisplatin, mitomycin C and acetaldehyde. In the NEIL3 pathway,
  one of the two N-glycosyl bonds that form the ICL are cleaved by the NEIL3 glycosylase,
  unhooking the crosslink without generating a double-strand break. This reaction
  does not require CMG unloading or FANCI-FANCD2. After unhooking, the gaps are filled
  in via translesion synthesis polymerases. If the NEIL3 pathway fails or the replisomes
  converge at a cisplatin-induced crosslink, the Fanconi anemia pathway is activated
  and repairs the lesion via dual incisions in the phosphodiester backbone. This reaction
  requires unloading of the CMG helicase and activation of the Fanconi anemia core
  complex. The core complex catalyzes the monoubiquitination of FANCI-FANCD2, causing
  it to clamp around double-stranded DNA. This is thought to trigger the recruitment
  of SLX4 and its associated endonucleases to execute crosslink unhooking via dual
  incisions in the phosphodiester backbone. The resulting double-strand break is repaired
  through the actions of translesion synthesis polymerases and homologous recombination.
  In both pathways, the nucleotide adduct is removed by nucleotide excision repair.
  Circles indicate 5′-termini. Arrowheads on nascent DNA indicate 3′-termini. Abbreviations:
  ICL, interstrand crosslink; Ub, ubiquitin.'
