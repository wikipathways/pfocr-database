caption: Aβ production from APP. (A) Schematic depiction of the Aβ production pathway.
  APP is sequentially cleaved by β- and γ-secretases to release Aβ into the extracellular
  space. Aβ monomer is prone to aggregate, forming oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils.
  (B) Diagram of the APP (above) and sequence of Aβ (below). The transmembrane segment
  (TM) is highlighted in yellow. The bold letters below the Aβ sequence indicate the
  missense FAD mutations within the Aβ sequence. The above and below the number of
  the Aβ sequence follow the numbering of the longest isoform of APP and Aβ amino
  acid sequence, respectively.
