caption: Proposed model for metal ion involvement in the mechanism underlying the
  LC-induced toxicity. Based on our current knowledge, redox-active transition metals,
  particularly copper, drive the ability of cardiotoxic LC to produce ROS in vivo.
  The excessive production of ROS can directly target the pharyngeal cells, damaging
  the organelle functions and the ultrastructure, particularly at the mitochondrial
  level. ROS can be also produced as a result of the mitochondrial dysfunction requiring
  copper and iron for the activation of the enzymes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway. Intracellular signaling events aimed at limiting and repairing the stress-induced
  damage are activated. Mitochondria reacts to ROS by inducing the expression of the
  scavenger protein SOD-3. In addition, the chaperone HSP-16.2, an αB-crystallin-related
  protein, is activated as well as the nuclear translocation of the FOXO/DAF-16 transcription
  factor. This last one can trigger a secondary ROS-induced cellular response by inducing
  the transcription of stress-responsive genes, including hsp-16.2 and sod-3, and
  controlling longevity. FOXO, forkhead transcription factors.
