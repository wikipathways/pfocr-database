caption: Interaction network and subcellular localization of differentially regulated
  genes by dasatinib in K562 cells. Regulated genes in response to dasatinib are shown
  according to their subcellular localization (Mito, mitochondria; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum) and reflected in the node shapes (rectangle, nucleus; ellipse, cytoplasm;
  lozenge, membrane; diamond, Mito or ER; triangle, extracellular). Nodes corresponding
  to proteins having more than one localization have an intermediary shape. Downregulated
  genes are indicated in green, upregulated genes in orange. Regulated gene products
  that interact directly are indicated with blue lines, interactions that can be established
  over one‐additional partner in‐between are shown by violet lines. Line thickness
  indicates the number of paths (1–12) linking one protein to another protein. Nine
  proteins are involved in the JAK–STAT signaling pathway (thick red border).
