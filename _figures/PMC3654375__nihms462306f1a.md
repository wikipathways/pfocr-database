caption: 'Plexin-B1 and Plexin-A1 are shown in black, with the intracellular C1 and
  C2 domains represented by black rectangles and the linker region in between as a
  black circle. A: Sema4D signaling in the nervous system. Proteins in the R-Ras pathway
  are shown in red: in the presence of Sema4D, Rnd1 is recruited to Plexin-B1. Plexin-B1
  R-RasGAP activity is activated and downregulates the active form of R-Ras. The decrease
  of active R-Ras inhibits PI3K-Akt activity, decreasing GSK3β phosphorylation and
  activing it. GSK3β then phosphorylates and deactivates CRMP2 and causes microtubule
  disassembly. Proteins in the RhoA pathway are shown in blue: in the presence of
  Sema4D, receptor tyrosin kinase ErbB2 binds and subsequently phosphorylates Plexin-B1
  (as indicated by the double-headed arrow) and then activates PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG, which
  associates with Plexin-B1. PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG activates RhoA, causing actin depolymerization
  through ROCK. Proteins in the Rac1 pathway are shown in green: Upon Sema4D binding,
  activated Plexin-B1 competes for active Rac1 with PAK. The shift on the equilibrium
  between Plexin-B1- and PAK- bound Rac1 results in decrease of PAK activity, LIMK
  activity, and Cofillin phosphorylation, thus causing actin depolymerization. This
  pathway so far has only been shown in heterologous cells, as indicated by the dashed
  box. Both the actin depolymerization and microtubule disassembly lead to axon growth
  cone collapse. B: Sema4D signaling in the vascular system. Proteins in the RhoA
  pathway are shown in blue: in the presence of Sema4D, the receptor tyrosine kinase
  Met binds and phosphorylates Plexin-B1 (as indicated by the double-headed arrow)
  and then activates PDZ-RhoGEF, which activates RhoA and leads to endothelial cell
  migration through the ROCK, Pyk2, and PI3K pathway. It is not clear how this pathway
  affects actin dynamics or microtubule dynamics in vascular system. C: Sema3A signaling
  in the nervous system. Rac1 regulating proteins are shown in green: in the presence
  of Sema3A, FARP2 is released from PlexinA1 and actives Rac1. Rac1 then activates
  PAK and LIMK and, as a result, phosphorylates Cofilin, which finally causes actin
  depolymerization. R-Ras regulating proteins are shown in red: in the presence of
  Sema3A, Rac1 facilitates Rnd1 recruitment to PlexinA1, which induces PlexinA1’s
  R-RasGAP activity and downregulates active R-Ras. Decrease of active R-Ras downregulates
  PI3K-Akt activity and leads to axon growth cone collapse through 3 different pathways:
  reduced phorporylatesGSK3β, reduced phosphorylation of ERM, and activation of myosinII.
  Kinases are shown in blue: in the presence of Sema3A, FARP2 inhibits PIPKIγ661 and
  suppresses integrin-induced adhesion. Fer and Fes are activated upon Sema3A binding
  to Plexin-A1 and phosphorylate and inactivate CRMP2, which leads to microtubule
  disassembly. Fyn is also activated after its binding to PlexinA1 and inactivates
  CRMP2 by phosphorylating and activating Cdk5. Both actin depolymerization and microtubule
  disassembly lead to axon growth cone collapse. D: Sema3A signaling in the vascular
  system. Sema3A, through an unknown mechanism (possibly through Npn-1 and/or a co-receptor,
  shown as a dashed line and question mark), inhibits VEGF-induced activation of Src
  and FAK and contributes to angiogenesis. Sema3A may also function through Npn-1
  to inhibit integrin-mediated adhesion of endothelial cells to the ECM. Sema3A can
  induce VE-cadherin phosphorylation and causes vascular permeability through unknown
  mechanisms (indicated by question marks), in which PI3K-Akt is involved.'
