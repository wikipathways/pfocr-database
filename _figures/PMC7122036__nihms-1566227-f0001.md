caption: Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling in aortic aneurysms and dissections
  (AAD). TGF-β ligands are produced as a large latent TGF-β complex consisting of
  mature TGF-β, latency-associated peptide (LAP), and a latent TGF-β–binding protein
  (LTBP). TGF-β activates canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways. In the canonical
  pathway, TGF-β binds and induces heteromeric complex formation between TGF-β type
  I receptor (TβRI) and TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII), leading to TβRI phosphorylation
  (P). TβRI, in turn, phosphorylates and activates downstream transcription factors
  such as SMADs (i.e., R-SMADs SMAD2 and SMAD3). SMADs then translocate to the nucleus,
  where they bind to the promoters of target genes and transactivate their gene expression.
  The canonical TGF-β signaling pathway promotes aortic development and maintains
  aortic wall homeostasis. Mutations in genes encoding TGF-β ligands, receptors, and
  downstream transcription factor SMAD cause thoracic AAD. In the noncanonical pathways,
  the activated TGF-β receptor complex transmits signals through other pathways, such
  as TGF-β–activated kinase 1 (TAK1), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK),
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB). The noncanonical TGF-β pathways promote aortic destruction and
  AAD development.
