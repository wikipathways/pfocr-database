caption: The schematic diagram regarding key parts of this study. During the TSDO
  process, neutrophils undergo phenotypic conversion to the Jun-Neu phenotype in response
  to mechanical force and secrete OSM through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. OSM
  subsequently promotes osteogenic differentiation by binding to OSMR or LIFR receptors
  expressed on SuSCs

  promotes craniofacial bone regeneration for midface hypoplasia treatment
