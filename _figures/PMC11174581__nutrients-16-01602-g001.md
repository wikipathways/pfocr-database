caption: 'Promotion mechanisms of microecologics on sports performance. GABAB: gamma-aminobutyric
  acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the CNS, GABAB is a receptor
  in the constituent GABA structure; CORT: corticosterone, excessive corticosterone
  levels reflect the appearance of anxiety symptoms; 5-HT6: Human 5-hydroxytryptamine
  receptor 6 belongs to the human serotonin receptor family and plays an important
  role in regulating emotion and cognition; AMPK/Sirt1/PGC-1α is an important signaling
  pathway that activates mitochondrial activity; GLUT4: glucose transporters type
  4 is important in skeletal muscle glucose uptake for muscle contraction; pp-1: is
  glycogen synthesis-related genes, promoting glycogen synthesis in the body; UCP1:
  uncoupling protein 1, adjust heat production in human brown fat to avoid low metabolism
  or hypothermia; ROS, NO, CK can serve as a physiological indicator of the degree
  of oxidative stress in vivo or vitro; Keap1/Nrf2: It is closely associated with
  anti-oxidation, and it reduce the harm of oxidation products to the body by reducing
  TGF-α expression and malondialdehyde (MDA) production. The blue straight arrow represents
  a rise or fall in expression'
