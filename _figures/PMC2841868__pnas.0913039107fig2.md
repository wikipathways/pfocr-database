caption: 'Graphical representation of the HMF (A) and furfural (B) metabolic pathway
  in C. basilensis HMF14. B has been adapted from Koenig and Andreesen (). Colored
  hexamers and triangles indicate enzymes with the following activities: orange hexagon,
  furfural/HMF oxidoreductase; red and green triangles, 2,5-furan-dicarboxylic acid
  decarboxylase; blue triangle, 2-furoyl-CoA synthetase; yellow triangle, furoyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase; purple triangle, 2-oxoglutaryl-CoA hydrolase. Colors correspond to
  the genes depicted in A. ▪; indicates a lactone hydrolysis that may occur spontaneously,
  or may be catalyzed by a generic lactone hydrolase. Double-pointed arrows indicate
  keto-enol tautomerizations. Reactions marked with (*) can be catalyzed either by
  HmfH or by (probably nonspecific) dehydrogenases. ACC; acceptor, which is oxidized(0000ox)
  or reduced(0000red).'
