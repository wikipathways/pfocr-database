caption: Tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism and endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling.
  (a) The first step in the de novo synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is the
  rate limiting reaction involving the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH1), whose
  substrate is GTP. An alternative salvage pathway for BH4synthesis is the reduction
  of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2) to BH4 by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).
  BH2 is generated from sepiapterin by the sepiapterin reductase enzyme (SR). Oxidative
  stress may be an environmental condition that promotes the oxidation of BH4 to BH2,
  decreasing the bioavailability of BH4. (b) Under physiological conditions, nitric
  oxide synthases (NOS, coupled NOS) generate nitric oxide, following the metabolism
  of L-arginine into L-citrulline in the presence of BH4. However, uncoupling NOS
  (uncoupled eNOS) with these enzymes may result in the generation of a superoxide
  anion (O2∙−). This phenomenon results from a deficiency in BH4 and an increased
  BH2 bioavailability (from data in [, , ]).
