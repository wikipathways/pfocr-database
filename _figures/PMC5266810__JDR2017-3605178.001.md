caption: The interorgan crosstalk involved in β-cell failure. Representative pathways
  from metabolic organs involved in a reduction of functional β-cell mass are illustrated.
  Although adiponectin, preferentially secreted from lean adipose tissue, may have
  protective effects on β-cells, leptin, which is secreted more from obese adipose
  tissue, negatively impacts β-cell function and mass via direct and indirect pathways.
  Leptin suppresses the bioactivity of osteocalcin, which is essential for β-cell
  function and expansion, through the modulation of sympathetic tone signals delivered
  to osteoblasts, creating a feed-forward interplay among adipose tissue, the brain,
  bone, and β-cells. Conversely, insulin enhances osteocalcin bioactivity through
  the activation of osteoclastic bone resorption. Meanwhile, excess FFA spillover
  from obese adipose tissue induces insulin resistance in insulin sensitive organs
  such as muscle and liver, resulting in overload of β-cells by excess insulin demand.
  Additionally, skeletal muscle and liver might exert detrimental effects of β-cell
  function by secreting proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in this setting.
  Glucagon promotes Kisspeptin 1 production in hepatocyte, which mediates an alternative
  pathway from liver to β-cells. Furthermore, FFA induces the production of chemokines
  in β-cells, recruiting M1 macrophages into islets. In the diabetic milieu, hyperglycemia
  and IAPP derived from β-cells synergistically promote inflammatory responses through
  the promotion of IL-1β biosynthesis in M1 macrophages.
