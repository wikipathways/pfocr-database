caption: 'Models of prophase checkpoint in oocytes. (A) Schematics of chromosome configurations
  in early (left) and late (right) stages of meiotic recombination in normal meiocytes.
  (B) Models of prophase checkpoint in oocytes. Upper panel, dual checkpoint model:
  Persistent DSBs activate DNA damage sensor kinases, which leads to perinatal oocyte
  elimination if DSBs are unrepaired till late prophase (top checkpoint pathway).
  HORMAD1/2-dependent recruitment of ATR to unsynapsed axes activates an ATR signalling
  pathway (bottom pathway) that does not require DSBs. This pathway serves as a synapsis
  checkpoint mechanism that eliminates asynaptic oocytes perinatally. Lower panel,
  DSB-dependent checkpoint model: HORMAD1/2 activates the prophase checkpoint primarily
  by delaying DSB repair, which increases the steady state numbers of unrepaired DSBs.
  HORMAD1/2-dependent axis binding of ATR plays lesser or no direct role in checkpoint
  activation (hence, it is omitted from the scheme). Note that a combination of the
  two models is also possible. HORMAD1 has a role in enabling SPO11-mediated DSB formation
  in early prophase but not in late prophase. Hence, this function does not directly
  contribute to checkpoint activation in late prophase, but it is important for synapsis
  formation. Processes, activation and inhibition are marked by black double-line,
  blue and red arrows, respectively.'
