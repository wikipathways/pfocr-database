caption: Hypothetical scheme of the proposed mechanisms contributing to the induction
  of tolerance by SIT. (A) Natural exposure to an allergen leads to activation of
  Th2 cells. (B) nTreg cells are generated in thymus, but can also develop from conventional
  CD4+ T-cells by specific condition or signals. nTreg cells induce IDO expression
  on dendritic cell (IDO+DC). This is partially mediated via the interaction of CTLA-4
  expressed on nTreg and CD80 (B7) expressed on DC. (C) IDO catalyzes the initial
  and rate-limiting step of tryptophan degradation. (D) IDO expressing DC induces
  development of Treg after allergen IT by a mechanism at present not completely defined.
  (E) 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits transcription factor NF-κB thereby inhibiting maturation
  of DC and resulting in tolerogenic DC, which direct the induction of Treg cells.
  Treg cells suppressed Th2 responses and effector cells by the release of immunoregulatory
  cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β. (F) The role of allergen-specific IgA is unclear. Dotted
  arrows represent immune response pathway to SIT; blocked lines represent inhibition.
