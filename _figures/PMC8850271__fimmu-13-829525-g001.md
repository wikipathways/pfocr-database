caption: Bile acid synthesis, recirculation and microbial modifications in the gut.
  Bile acids are synthesised in the liver from cholesterol. In the classical pathway,
  cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) converts cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol
  which can then form either of the PBAs, CA and CDCA, through multistep pathways
  involving cytochrome P450 enzymes. In the alternative pathway, sterol-27-hydroxylase
  (CYP27A1) initiates the conversion of cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol which
  mainly forms CDCA. These PBAs are then conjugated with either taurine (T) or glycine
  (G) to make them water soluble, before being released into bile where they form
  mixed micelles. As bile enters the duodenum via the ampulla of Vater, absorptive
  micelles are formed which facilitates the absorption of fatty acids, monoglycerides,
  fat soluble vitamins, and cholesterol in the small intestine. In the terminal ileum,
  95% of conjugated BAs are reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation, whilst
  the remaining 5% enter the colon. Here, BAs undergo a number of chemical modifications
  by gut bacteria including deconjugation, desulphation, dehydrogenation, dehydroxylation,
  and epimerisation reactions to form the SBAs, LCA and DCA, and their oxo, iso, and
  epi-derivatives. PBAs, primary bile acids; SBAs, secondary bile acids; CA, cholic
  acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; DCA, deoxycholic acid; LCA, lithocholic acid;
  T, taurine; G, glycine; CYP7A1, 7α-hydroxylase; CYP27A1, sterol-27-hydroxylase.
