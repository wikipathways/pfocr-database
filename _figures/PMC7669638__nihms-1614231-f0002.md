caption: Following nerve injury, cytokines including Transforming growth factor beta
  (TGF- β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), Interleukin
  6 (IL-6) and bradykinin are released. All of these activate the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway by activating extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2). Neurotrophins including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) are
  also released. Of these, NGF and GDNF have been found to also activate the MAPK
  signaling pathway via activation of ERK. ERK subsequently activates early growth
  response 1 (Egr-1) which promotes the expression of p35. This allows for increased
  association with Cdk5 and activation. GDNF also, by interaction with GDNF family
  receptor alpha-1 (GFRα1), activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway which
  also activates p35 into increased association with Cdk5. BDNF, another neurotrophin
  released, can activate Cdk5 via tyrosine receptor kinase B’s (TrkB) phosphorylation
  of Cdk5. This phosphorylation increases Cdk5 activity and can be catalyzed by Fyn,
  a tyrosine kinase. Alternately, BDNF activates Cdk5 by activating protein kinase
  C δ’s (PKCδ) promotion of p35 expression. Following excitatory glutamate signaling,
  N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and kainite receptors are stimulated to permit
  a calcium influx. Long-term signaling and high calcium influx will promote the association
  of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α (CAMKIIα), p35, calpain and
  GluN2B subunit. This will induce calpain cleavage of p35 to p25 resulting in hyperactive
  Cdk5. Short-term signaling will transiently activate Cdk5 via calmodulin activation,
  thus phosphorylating p35 and destining it for degradation by the ubiquitin protease
  rendering Cdk5 inactive. G-tubulin binding to Cdk5 prevents Cdk5 association with
  p39 and p35 and promotes its inactive state. Finally, α- actinin-1 and CAMKIIα are
  known to interact with both p35 and p39. These complexes can then interact with
  Cdk5/p35 and Cdk5/p39 complexes and are suspected to affect Cdk5 activity.
