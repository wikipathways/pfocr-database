caption: Metabolic pathways with compounds that can be used as molecular imaging probes
  for HP MRI. A wide variety of metabolic pathways have already been visualized or
  have the potential to be visualized using hyperpolarization technology that can
  be applied to different pathological states of the cell including cardiovascular
  disease and a large variety of cancers. 1. Metabolism of C1 (red dots) in pyruvate.
  The asterisks on selected compounds represent enrichment of 13C in the second pass
  of pyruvate in TCA cycle. 2. Metabolism of C1 (brown dots) in DHA using a pool of
  NADPH derived from the pentose phosphate pathway. 3. Metabolism of C1 (blue dots)
  and C5 (green dots) of glutamine. 4. Metabolism of C1 and C4 (purple dots) of fumarate
  unrelated to TCA metabolites. 5. Metabolism of extracellular bicarbonate (gray dots).
