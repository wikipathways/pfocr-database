caption: P2Y13 receptors couple to the survival promoting pathway of GSK3 signaling
  inhibition in granule neurons. P2Y13 receptor stimulation by the agonist 2MeSADP
  triggers the activation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3 pathway in granule neurons. GSK3 phosphorylation
  inhibits its catalytic activity towards its substrates, allowing cytosolic stabilization
  and nuclear translocation of the transcriptional targets, β-catenin and Nrf2. β-catenin
  regulates transcription of Tcf/Lef-1-dependent genes involved in survival, differentiation
  and cell cycle dynamics. The transcription factor Nrf2 activates ARE-dependent genes
  involved in antioxidant cell response, such as heme oxigenase-1 (HO-1). Activation
  of the Nrf2/HO-1 axis in response to 2MeSADP stimulation in granule neurons functions
  as an important antioxidant defense mechanism that protects against ROS production
  and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis evoked by treatment with H2O2.
