caption: Function of autophagy in different stages of myogenic differentiation. (i)
  During aging, the ability of MuSCs to clear damaged cellular materials (specially
  mitochondria) through basal autophagy declines, which will result in higher levels
  of ROS. ROS can inhibit the expression of downstream target genes (related to cell
  cycle) by activating p16INK4a, so as to cause quiescent MuSCs to lose reversible
  quiescence by switching to an irreversible pre‐senescence state. (ii) The AMPK/p27Kip1pathway
  may regulate the balance between autophagy and apoptosis in MuSCs, thus maintaining
  them in a steady‐state resting state. In senescent MuSCs, the phosphorylation of
  AMPK and its downstream target P27Kip1 decreased, and the resulting stress of suppressed
  autophagy makes MuSCs more prone to apoptosis. (iii) Sex steroid hormones controlled
  by the HPG axis transcriptionally induce the expression of Tfeb in MuSCs. TFEB systemically
  controls autophagosome clearance in MuSCs and reduces the accumulation of ROS. Accordingly,
  the HPG‐TFEB‐autophagosome pathway maintains stemness and quiescence of MuSCs. (iv)
  SIRT1 activates autophagy by mediating ATG7 deacetylation and AMPK phosphorylation.
  The increased level of autophagy promotes ATP production and mitochondrial activity
  to meet biological energy demand for MuSCs during this key transition from quiescence
  to activation. (v) In the process of differentiation, myoblasts first clear the
  original mitochondria of glycolysis mode through mitophagy, and then regenerate
  mitochondria of new metabolic mode (oxidative phosphorylation) to meet the increased
  energy demand of myotubes. PINK1 and ULK1 may be involved in the regulation of mitophagy.
  (vi) Autophagy regulates mitochondria‐mediated apoptotic signalling during myoblast
  differentiation, and protects differentiating myoblasts from apoptotic cell death.
