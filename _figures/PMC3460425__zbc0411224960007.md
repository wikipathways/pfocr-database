caption: Schematic of neural control of immune homeostasis by ARR-1 signaling. In
  addition to OCTR-1, at least another receptor may signal through ARR-1 in ASH and
  ASI neurons to control abu gene expression. ARR-1 function in AQR, PQR, and URX
  neurons appears to play only a small role in the control of abu genes, whereas ARR-1
  function in ADF and AFD neurons plays a more important role. ARR-1 signaling in
  ADF neurons also partially regulates longevity. Chemosensory ADF and thermosensory
  AFD neurons have unidentified receptors that may be regulated by ARR-1 to control
  abu gene expression and immune homeostasis.
