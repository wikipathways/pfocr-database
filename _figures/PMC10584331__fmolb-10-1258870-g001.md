caption: Ferroptosis mechanisms. Ferroptosis is mainly caused by the iron metabolic
  pathway (orange line), GSH function (green line), lipid peroxidation (blue line),
  and VDAC pathway (purple line); regulation of ferroptosis by the ferroxidase inhibitory
  protein 1-coenzyme Q10 is shown by the pink line. After iron overload, free Fe2
  + can form hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction, promoting lipid ROS leading
  to ferroptosis, and excessive iron accumulation can also lead to ferroptosis. Massive
  exploitation of VDAC channels leads to mitochondrial hyperpolarization, increased
  ROS accumulation, ferroptosis. GSH levels reduced, leading to reduced antioxidant
  levels; it can lead to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Lipid metabolism
  leads to lipid peroxidation through a series of reactions.
