caption: 'Top panel: canonical reductase capability of RNR-α promotes high-fidelity
  DNA-replication. Active reductase requires minimally a heterodimeric quaternary
  state as shown. Currently the preponderance of data indicate that ATP-induced active
  hexamers also form,. Lower panel: This work uncovers a novel oligomerization-dependent
  reductase-activity-independent moonlighting function of RNR-α. This function—negative-regulation
  of DNA-replication—uniquely proceeds via nuclear-RNR-α translocation allowing direct
  binding to ZRANB3. Also see  Indicated nucleotides are capable of converting lower-order
  RNR-α species into conformationally-distinct α6RD hexamers. Also see  Only a fraction
  of α6RD—likely those that selectively interact with importin-α1—translocates into
  the nucleus. IRBIT is a negative regulator of this nuclear translocation. This novel
  signaling pathway occurs in diverse mammalian cells not exposed to DNA-damage inducers.
  PCNA antagonizes this interaction. The ZRANB3–RNR-α direct interaction in the nucleus
  provides the molecular basis of the long-elusive, stage-specific tumor-suppressor
  role of RNR-α.'
