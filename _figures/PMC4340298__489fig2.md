caption: Hypothetical model illustrating the MAG and the G3P pathways in TAG synthesis
  in the ER of enterocytes. TAG products of the DGAT reaction may be channeled into
  the cores of cytosolic lipid droplets or TAG-rich chylomicrons for secretion. MGAT2
  and DGAT1 with epitope tags have been shown as homotetramers (, ), and these two
  enzymes may form heterodimers when coexpressed in cultured cells (). Several enzymes
  in the G3P pathway have also been located on the cytosolic lipid droplets. Plin,
