caption: Cytokinin homeostasis maintenance pathway involving in situ cytokinin biosynthesis
  (catalyzed by ATP-ADP IPTs and tRNA-IPTs), activation (catalyzed by specific phosphoribohydrolases
  encoded by LOG genes), irreversible inactivation (catalyzed by N-glucosyltransferases),
  reversible inactivation (catalyzed by O-glucosyltransferases), reactivation (catalyzed
  by β-glucosidases) and irreversible degradation (catalyzed by cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenases).
  Cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenases substrates are highlighted in red (Modified from
