caption: '(A) Gene expression for p53 signaling in SY cells co-cultured with B. burgdorferi
  exhibits through up-regulation of transcript for protein kinase B (AKT), thrombospondin
  (TSP)-1 and Bcl2-like (Bcl-XL) combined with decreased transcript for damage-regulated
  autophagy modulator (DRAM) and p16, a mode of cell survival and proliferation. (B)
  The inclusion of microglial cells in the co-culture of SY cells with B. burgdorferi
  causes a shift in SY gene expression more in line with preparation for apoptosis
  than cell survival. There is increased transcript expression for pro-apoptotic phosphatase
  and tensin homolog (PTEN), Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced
  protein (NOXA)-1 genes combined with a reversal to decreased transcript for the
  anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-xL. There is also increased expression of the cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor, p21 and down-regulation in cyclin dependent kinase CDK2, both
  indicating a potential preparation for cell cycle arrest at G1/S. See also, . Values
  were obtained using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software version 6. Fold change
  was ≥1.5 with p≤0.05. The human array chips contained approximately 22,000 unique
  annotated genes and all genes in these pathways were represented on the chips. Red:
  increased gene expression. Green: decreased gene expression. Microglia were physically
  separated from the SY cells by 3.0-micrometer pore diameter transwell culture inserts.
  Individual transcript can be accessed through the online supplemental data ( and
  ).'
