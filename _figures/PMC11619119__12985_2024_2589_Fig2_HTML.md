caption: The key IFN signaling pathway targets disrupted by HBV components. The figure
  depicts the type I interferon (IFN) pathway, illustrating both the induction of
  IFN expression and the downstream antiviral effects. Key components include TLRs
  (TLR3, TLR7/8, TLR9), RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5), and cytosolic DNA sensors (DAI/ZBP1, STING)
  that recognize viral nucleic acids and activate signaling pathways leading to IFN
  production. IFN signaling through IFNAR1/2 activates JAK1 and TYK2, which phosphorylate
  STAT1 and STAT2. Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 form a complex with IRF9, translocating
  to the nucleus and binding to ISRE, activating ISG expression. HBV evasion mechanisms,
  such as HBx, HBsAg, and SP1/2/3, inhibit various aspects of the IFN pathway. ISGs,
  including MX1/2, OAS1-3, IFIT1, ISG15, ISG20, RNASEL, and Viperin, are induced by
  IFN signaling. SOCS1 and SOCS3 are induced by IFN signaling and negatively regulate
  JAK-STAT signaling
