caption: AHR-dependent metabolic activation of PAHs by CYP1 isoforms. Lipophilic PAHs
  can easily pass the plasma membrane and activate the canonical AHR signaling pathway.
  The resulting induction of CYP1 isoform expression and enzyme activity accelerates
  the oxidative metabolism of the invading chemicals. In case a proper detoxification
  of the resulting reactive PAH metabolites by the conjugating enzyme system (not
  shown) fails, reactive PAH-diol epoxides may covalently bind to the DNA and form
  highly mutagenic bulky DNA adducts.
