  The optimal dNTP pool is determined by the balance between de novo synthesis, consumption
  of synthesized nucleotides, and their degradation. RNR is the key enzyme that provides
  the balanced supply of dNTPs by converting ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides.
  The nucleotide salvage pathways contribute to the dNTP pool by converting nitrogen
  bases and nucleosides back to nucleotides. SAMHD1, a dNTP hydrolase, degrades nucleotides
  to maintain low levels of dNTPs in the G1 phase. ADA and PNP are the key enzymes
  of the purine salvage pathway. ADA converts deoxyadenosine to deoxyinosine, and
  adenosine to inosine, respectively. PNP converts guanosine and deoxyguanosine to
  guanine, inosine, and deoxyinosine to hypoxanthine. The accumulated dAdo in ADA
  deficiency inhibits SAH hydrolase, leading to accumulation of SAH, which inhibits
  transmethylation of various biomolecules. The effects of the inhibition or deficiency
  of RNR, SAMHD1, ADA, and PNP are also summarized. RNR: ribonucleotide reductase;
