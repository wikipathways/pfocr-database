caption: IQGAP1 regulates cell homeostasis through mTORC1. A model depicting the action
  of IQGAP1 in coupling cell growth and division through a previously unidentifed
  CDC42-mTORC1–S6K1–Akt1 pathway in response to nutrient or mitogenic signal. Black
  arrows and lines denote previously identified regulation of cell size by IQGAP1
  and a known mTORC1–S6K1 negative feedback loop (NFL), and red arrows and lines denote
  new finings in this study. In closed conformation, IQGAP1 enhances insulin secretion,
  protein synthesis and cell growth (; ) through mTORC1–S6K1. In open conformation
  IQGAP1-P promotes cell division and proliferation () through IQGAP1 S1443-P↑, mTORC1
  and S6K1↓, and Akt1 S473-P↑ and suppresses differentiation and/or apoptosis by attenuating
  ERK1/2 and GSK3α/β. IQGAP1 attenuates S6K1 T389-P activity to enhance Akt1 S473-P
  activity, which in turn activates mitosis where IQGAP1 has a role in cell abscission.
  Thus IQGAP1 may act like a rheostat to modulate the NFL of S6K1 T389-P→Akt1 S473-P
  and maintain cell homeostasis, dysregulation of which could underlie tumorigenesis
  and/or aberrant insulin signaling in diabetes.
