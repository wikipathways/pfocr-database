caption: Crosstalk between hormones and ShB. IAA, ETH, SA, JA, BR, GA, ABA, CTK, and
  SL regulate ShB resistance. PIN1a is an auxin efflux carrier responsible for auxin
  polar transport in rice. PIN1a positively regulates rice resistance to ShB. siR109944
  expression is suppressed by R. solani inoculation. ACS2 leads to over-accumulation
  of ethylene. PBZ1 expression level is significantly induced in response to pathogen
  attacks. Following pathogen inoculation, the ACS2 levels and ethylene contents in
  ACS2-overexpression lines are significantly up-regulated, resulting in enhanced
  resistance to ShB. EIL1, the core component of the rice ethylene signaling pathway
  which regulates the expression of ethylene-responsive genes, positively regulating
  rice resistance to ShB. The SA signaling pathway in rice has two branches, one is
  the same NPR1-mediated pathway while the other is regulated by WRKY45. WRKY45 overexpression
  rice plants results in resistance to blast disease and leaf blight disease but has
  no positive effects (OPE) on ShB resistance. The function of NPR1 in the rice-ShB
  interaction remains unknown. Constitutive expression of transcription factor WRKY30
  promotes JA accumulation and PR gene expression to increase ShB resistance in rice.
  JA positively regulates rice resistance to ShB. BR is a negative regulator of rice
  resistance to ShB. WRKY53 directly activates the expression of SWEET2a, a negative
  regulator of rice resistance to ShB, to confer susceptibility to ShB. SLR1 is the
  only DELLA protein in rice that inhibits GA signaling and its mutation significantly
  increases the disease susceptibility to leaf blight disease. ABA is primarily a
  negative regulator of immunity that regulates rice resistance to leaf blight disease
  and blast disease. The effects of SLs and CTK on the ShB process are not clear and
  require further investigation.
