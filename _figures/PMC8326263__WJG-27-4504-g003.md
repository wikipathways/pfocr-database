caption: 'Mechanism of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease
  2019. (1) Gut-lung axis: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
  binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter the lung, which leads
  to the accumulation of angiotensin II (ANG II) and the reduction of Angiotensin
  (1-7). ANG II combined with angiotensin 1 receptor stimulates cytokine release and
  causes an upsurge of C-C chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) CD4T cells. Chemokine
  (C-C motif) ligand 25 subsequently enhances the recruitment of CCR9 CD4T cells into
  the small intestine. The changing flora then stimulates the polarization of T helper
  17 cells, and eventually, interleukin 17A induces the recruitment of neutrophils.
  Cytokines and intestinal bacteria also enter the lung through the bloodstream, further
  affecting lung inflammation; and (2) Gut-liver axis: SARS-CoV-2 binds with ACE2
  to enter the intestine, prevents absorption of the B0AT1/ACE2 transport pathway,
  and then decreases the stimulation of mammalian target of rapamycin to diminish
  the expression of antimicrobial peptides which result in gastrointestinal tract
  symptoms or enhanced ANG II that leads to the upregulation of tissue factor VIII,
  Von Willebrand factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression by endothelial
  cells resulting in mesenteric thrombosis. The intestinal flora, through the portal
  vein, is transferred to the liver, where it binds to toll-like receptors resulting
  in hepatitis. Additionally, the liver, can transport metabolites to the intestine
  via the biliary tract,. COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019; SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute
