caption: Proposed GHSR induced mechanism of signal transduction in relation to the
  IR. Here, the possible GHSR-induced molecules are shown to exert their effects by
  activating or inhibiting several signalling pathways. More importantly, it has been
  proposed that the inhibiting mechanism of AKT kinase by ghrelin is responsible for
  the disassociation of the IRS1-PI3K-AKT pathway. Taken in part from Murata et al.
  [].
