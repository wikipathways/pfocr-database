caption: Schematic representation of PPARs-dependent oncogenic metabolic pathways
  highlighted in this review. The representation concerns the metabolic mechanisms
  that are activated/inhibited in tumor cells under the transcriptional control of
  PPARs. These hypotheses of molecular mechanisms are based on evidence obtained by
  different cancer types. For each PPAR isotype, the specific activated/inhibited
  metabolic pathways are reported together with some of the PPARs’ target genes. (A)
  Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) can active PPARα, which in turn activates the
  transcription of specific genes resulting in high glycolysis, high glycogen storage,
  and high proliferation rate (glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), c-Myc, and cyclin D1).
  However, PPARα activation is also related to the induction of fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO) by upregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). In addition, PPARα
  induces fatty acid synthesis by upregulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) enzymes.
  It is noteworthy that mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2)
  is upregulated by PPARα; besides, HMGCS2 can form a heterodimeric complex with PPARα
  to induce Src expression. The phosphorylation of Src triggers the mevalonate (MVA)
  pathway, resulting in high levels of cholesterol (CHOL). Lipid components and cholesterol
  are useful for membrane synthesis, and their large amounts are confined in lipid
  droplets. Extracellular lipids and some intracellular lipids (from lipid droplets)
  can be PPARα ligands; they are delivered to the nucleus by fatty acid binding protein
  (FABP). (B) PPARγ transcriptional activity activates some proteins related to fatty
  acid synthesis, such as FAS, c-Myc, PBP (PPARγ-binding protein), NR1D1 (nuclear
  receptor subfamily 1, group D, number 1), and ODC1 (ornithine decarboxylase 1).
  ODC1 is able to inhibit krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), which in turn is unable to
  inhibit PPARγ. Other PPARγ-dependent mechanisms are able to reduce palmitate toxicity
  by confining it into lipid droplets. Moreover, PPARγ 41 kDa fragment, which is derived
  from caspase 1 cleavage, is able to inhibit FAO. (C) PPARβ/δ stimulates glycolysis
  by the overexpression of GLUT1, angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase 1 (PDPK1), and PI3K/Akt; likewise, PDPK1 and PI3K/Akt can activate
  PPARβ/δ expression. Fatty acid synthesis and FAO are activated by PPARβ/δ transcriptional
  activity on FAS and SLC1A5 (solute carrier 1 A5) genes. SLC1A5 is linked to the
  uptake of amino acids; thus, anaplerosis is also positively affected by PPARβ/δ.
  Anaplerosis also supports FAO. Interesting, PPARβ/δ upregulates cytokines expression;
  for example, interleukin 8 (IL8) and cytokines in concert with PPARβ/δ induce STAT3
  overexpression. The MVA pathway is a downstream process triggered by STAT3. The
  thin black continuous lines with arrows indicate upregulation events. The thick
  black continuous lines with arrows indicate a stimulation of the metabolic pathway.
  The thin blue continuous lines with bars indicate inhibition events. The thick blue
  continuous lines with bars indicate the inhibition of a metabolic pathway. The HIF-1-mediated
  upregulation of PPARs is represented by a grey dash dot and arrow at the end, while
  FABP-mediated ligand-dependent activation of PPARs is represented by a gold dash
  dot and arrow at the end.
