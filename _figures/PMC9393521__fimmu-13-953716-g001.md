caption: Mechanisms of ITP medications. Fostamatinib impairs Syk-mediated phagocytosis
  of platelets. Rilzabrutinib and orelabrutinib block FcγR signaling pathway transduction
  by inhibiting BTK. PRTX-100, Fc receptor-targeting biologics, rozrolimupab and anti-CD44
  inhibit macrophage phagocytosis by blocking IgG binding to Fc receptors. Oseltamivir
  inhibits glycoprotein-induced desialylation, protecting platelets from clearance
  by hepatocyte Ashwell-Morell receptors. Sirolimus acts on mTOR on megakaryocytes
  to regulate autophagy. Decitabine not only promotes megakaryocyte maturation but
  also regulates Treg cells and CTLs. Enhancement of the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway
  could restore the balance of Th cells. Chidamide increases the immunosuppressive
  functions of Treg cells and inhibits macrophage phagocytosis. Mesenchymal stem cells
  could upregulate Treg cells. Bortezomib stimulates apoptosis in LLPCs and short-lived
  plasma cells, thus decreasing antiplatelet antibodies. In the context of depleting
  B cells, adding Belimumab to block BAFF can reduce the number of splenic plasma
  cells. Atorvastatin improves endothelial progenitor cells function to promote megakaryopoietic
  production.
