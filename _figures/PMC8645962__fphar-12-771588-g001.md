caption: 'HADCs regulate tumor immunity and tumor immune microenvironment. Deacetylase
  regulates tumor immune response through multiple pathways. HDAC1,3,4,6,8,9 and Sirt1,2,6,7
  regulate the expression of PD-L1 by regulating the IFN signaling pathway. HDAC1,2,6
  regulates the expression of MHC, which affect the recognition of tumor cells by
  T cells. Sirt1, 2, 3 affect tumor immunity by changing the activity of T cells,
  HDAC1, 2, 10 could affect the function of Treg cells, and HDAC5 promotes the differentiation
  of naive T cells into Treg cells. Sirt2,3 could affect the activity of NK cells.
  HDAC7 both enhances the anti-tumor function of macrophages and the antigen presentation
  function of DC cells. HDAC1, 5, 6, 11 and Sirt1, 4, 5 modulate the tumor microenvironment
  by affecting the secretion of cytokines. Red lines and text colors represent the
  promoting effects of tumor immunity, while blue represents the tumor immunosuppression
  effects. Dotted lines indicate the regulation and function of cytokines. Abbreviations:
  T cell, T lymphocyte; NK, natural killer cell; DC, dendritic cells; MDSC, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cell; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; IFNγ R, interferon-γ receptor; IL, interleukin;
  JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TNF-α,
  tumor necrosis factor-α; Treg, regulatory T cell; IRF, interferon regulatory factor;
  PD-L1, programmed death-ligand 1; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Sirt, sirtuins;
  HDAC, histone deacetylases.'
