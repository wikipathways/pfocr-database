caption: Toll-like receptor signaling – general features of the canonical pathway.
  The myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) is an innate immune signal
  transduction adaptor common for almost all TLR (except for the TLR3), which recruits
  interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). The IRAK interacts with adapter
  protein tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), leading to nuclear factor
  kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) translocation to the cellular
  nuclei. The TLRMyD88 signaling pathway results in increased pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and interferon production.
