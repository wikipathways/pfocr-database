caption: Molecular pathways in the regulation of osteosarcoma by ferroptosis. The
  anticancer drug cisplatin-induced ferroptosis by reducing STAT3 levels and increased
  the sensitivity of OS cells to cisplatin by inhibiting STAT3, while Bavachin also
  triggered OS cell ferroptosis and prevented OS cell spread by inhibiting STAT3 expression.
  PEITC and EF24 activated MAPK and HMOX1 signaling pathways, respectively, which
  can increase the lipid peroxidation level, intracellular iron concentration, and
  ROS level of human OS cells, thus inducing ferroptosis. TPZ induced ferroptosis
  in OS cells by inhibiting the expression of SLC7A11 in the classical ferroptosis
  signaling pathway.
