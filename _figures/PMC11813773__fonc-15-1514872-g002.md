caption: 'The dual roles of SBAs in colon cells: anticancer and cancer-promoting effects.
  (A) Anticancer effects of SBAs in colorectal cancer (CRC): LCA inhibits inflammatory
  signals and activates p53, which binds to MDM4 and MDM2, thereby preventing cell
  proliferation. DCA induces the expression of apoptosis-related genes (GADD153, AP-1,
  and C/EBP), key regulators of the cell cycle and apoptosis. UDCA suppresses c-Myc
  expression, promotes endocytosis and degradation of EGFR, and blocks PI3K, MAPK,
  or cAMP pathways to induce apoptosis. Partially inhibits DCA-induced apoptosis by
  disrupting the EGFR/Raf-1/ERK signaling pathway. Both UDCA and TUDCA inhibit interleukin
  β1, NF-κB, and AP-1 activation. (B) Cancer-promoting effects of SBAs in CRC development:
  DCA and LCA are major pathogenic factors that activate signaling pathways such as
  PI3K-AKT, NF-κB, NADH/NADPH oxidase, and PLA2, leading to ROS generation, DNA damage,
  and inflammatory responses. LCA: activates Erk1/2, which suppresses STAT3 phosphorylation,
  inducing IL-8 and miRNA-21 expression, thereby contributing to tumor progression'
