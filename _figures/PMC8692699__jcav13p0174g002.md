caption: Regulatory network of HOTAIR in lung cancer. HOTAIR regulates the growth
  and proliferation of lung cancer cells by inhibition of p53 and p21. HOTAIR-mediated
  epigenetic gene expression is dependent on its function as a scaffold for PRC2 and
  LSD1regulating PTEN, HOXD10, β-catenin and Wif1. Through the methylation of HOXA1,
  HOTAIR activates the NF-kB signaling pathway. HOTAIR also acts as a ceRNA for regulation
  of miRNAs, such as miR-329 and miR-214.
