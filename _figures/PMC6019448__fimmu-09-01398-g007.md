caption: 'Model of avian and mammalian OASL involvement in RNase L and RIG-I signaling.
  As a sensor, ancient and enzymatic OASL in birds and mammals contain three aspartic
  acids (D), which are homologous to D75-D77-D148 in hOAS1 and required to synthesize
  2–5As, and three key positively charged amino acids (R/K-K/R-K), which are homologous
  to R195-K199-K205 in human 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1). Both avian
  and mammalian OASLs develop the potential ability to switch the OAS/RNase L and
  OASL/RIG-I signaling. In natural, avian OASL activates and magnifies the OAS/RNase
  L pathway to exert antiviral activity in an UBL-dependent manner, where both its
  OAS-like domain (OLD) and UBL domains bind dsRNA. While some enzymatic mammalian
  OASLs activate and magnify the OAS/RNase L pathway to exert antiviral activity in
  an UBL-independent manner, where only their OLD domains bind dsRNA and synthesizes
  2–5A like human OAS1. Some non-enzymatic mammalian OASLs lose 2–5A activity, switch
  to activate, and enhance RIG-I signaling to inhibit the replications of RNA viruses
  in a UBL-dependent manner when their three conserved D sites are mutated. Such natural
  switching between the OAS/RNase L and OASL/RIG-I using OASL molecules were recently,
  thus, both avian and mammalian OASL may reversibly to activate and magnify one of
  the above signaling when we introduce mutations at three conserved D sites. Five-pointed
  star (red): D residue; Five-pointed star (blue): D sites serving as metal ion ligands
  were mutated to A residue, or E81, E83, and T152 site in hOASL; Four-pointed star
  (black): three key positively charged amino acids; Four-pointed star (green): three
  key positively charged amino acids (RKK or KKK) were mutated to E. Abbreviations:
  OLD, OAS-like domain; UBL, ubiquitin-like domain; ARD, ankyrin repeat domain; KEN,
