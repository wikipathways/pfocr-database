caption: The precursor to anti-parasitic agent, currently marketed as Bravecto™, isoxazoline
  19, can be prepared efficiently and in high enantiomeric purity through a pathway
  that features the enantioselective allyl addition to commercially available 3,5-dichlorophenyl-2,2,2-trifluoromethyl
  ketone 3r. The key allyl addition delivers the highest e.r. value (95:5) with 10
  mol % Zn(OMe)2 as the base and the boron-based complex that is derived from adamantyl-substituted
  aminophenol 1d. The resulting tertiary homoallylic alcohol 4r is then converted
  to β-hydroxy ketone 18, the product that would be expected from a ketone aldol addition
  to 3r in 56% overall yield.
