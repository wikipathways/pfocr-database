caption: Exosome biogenesis. Through endocytosis and plasma membrane invagination,
  fluid and extracellular constituents such as proteins, lipids, metabolites, small
  molecules and ions can enter cells. This process leads to the formation of early
  endosomes or the possible fusion of the gem with endosomes performed by the constituents
  of the endoplasmic reticulum and of the Golgi network. Early endosomes give rise
  to late endosomes. Late endosomes evolve to multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with a
  defined collection of intraluminal vesicles (future exosomes). MVBs can also fuse
  directly with lysosomes for degradation (not shown). MVBs that do not follow this
  pathway can be transported to the plasma membrane. Exocytosis follows and leads
  to the release of exosomes with a lipid bilayer orientation similar to that of the
  plasma membrane. Exosomes can contain different types of cell surface proteins,
  intracellular proteins, RNA, DNA, amino acids and metabolites.
