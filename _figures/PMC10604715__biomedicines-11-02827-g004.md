caption: 'Polyamine degradation pathway via fetal bovine serum amine oxidase. BSAO
  in ruminant sera such as bovine serum catalyzes the oxidation of spermine and spermidine
  to spermidine and putrescine, respectively. The acrolein produced in this process
  is very toxic and can cause cell damage and death. Abbreviation: BSAO, bovine serum
  amine oxidase.'
