caption: Role of neurofibromin (NF-1) in the regulation of intracellular Ras signaling
  within DRG neurons. a, When activated, the guanosine-nucleotide exchange factor
  Son-of-Sevenless (SOS) displaces GDP from inactive Ras. This allows GTP, which is
  abundant in the cytosol, to bind Ras passively. GTP-bound Ras can then activate
  downstream effectors such as Raf-1. The GAP neurofibromin promotes Ras to convert
  GTP to GDP and thereby prevents downstream signaling (). b, Although Ras activates
  various pathways, its involvement in the MAP kinase pathway has been studied most
  intensively. This pathway involves the dimerization of receptor tyrosine kinases
  (e.g., Trk receptors) that then activate SOS. After Ras activation, a phosphorylation
  cascade ensues, with subsequent activation of Raf-1, MEK, and Erk-1 and Erk-2, which
  ultimately results in the transcription of genes encoding Ets family transcription
  factors ().  showed that neurofibromin negatively regulates activation of the MEK–Erk
  pathway, which may underlie its plasticity-limiting influence on spared sensory
  projections to the deafferented spinal cord.
