caption: Epigenetic regulation of miR-126 by metabolic changes in malignant mesothelioma.
  MiR-126 suppresses IRS1 by binding to its 3′-UTR, with ensuing inhibition of the
  insulin/IGF-1/AKT pathway. This contributes to the change of glucose metabolism.
  The flux trough glycolysis determines the NAD+/NADH ratio, which is involved in
  the activation of sirtuin histone deacetylases (SIRTs). The NAD+-dependent PARP1
  is involved in the maintenance of H3K4me3 in the trimethylation form, a marker of
  permissive chromatin. The ATP/AMP ratio can activate AMPK, a kinase that can phosphorylate
  histones. In addition, miR-126 inhibits ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thus increasing
  the cytosolic citrate, which is converted to acetyl-CoA and used as a donor for
  histone acetyltransferases (HAT)-mediated histone acetylation.
