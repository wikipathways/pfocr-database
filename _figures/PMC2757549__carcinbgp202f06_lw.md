caption: Diagram depicting the inhibitory and activating effects of OSU-A9 on the
  Akt–NF-κB signaling axis and stress response signaling, respectively. The ability
  of OSU-A9 to affect these two signaling networks and thus target different facets
  of breast malignancy underlies its high potency in suppressing tumor growth.
papertitle: OSU-A9, a potent indole-3-carbinol derivative, suppresses breast tumor
  growth by targeting the Akt–NF-κB pathway and stress response signaling.
