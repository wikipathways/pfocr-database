caption: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The canonical
  MAPK cascade is activated by a wide variety of stimuli and receptors promoting cell
  survival and proliferation. This pathway includes a set of adaptors, such as SHC
  and GRB2, linking the receptor to a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) such
  as SOS and C3G, transducing the signal to small GTP-binding proteins (Ras), which
  in turn activate the core unit of the cascade composed of a MAPKKK (Raf), a MAPKK
  (MEK1/2 (MAPK/ERK kinase-1/2)) and a MAPK (ERK). An activated ERK dimer, in turn,
  regulates several targets in the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus where it
  phosphorylates a variety of transcription factors regulating gene expression. Negative
  regulators of ERK pathway include MKPs. Pathway objects and links are described
  separately in the .
