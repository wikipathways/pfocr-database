caption: 'A: In the current model, activation of PI3K results in activation of Akt
  via mTORC2 and PDK1, a process that can be reversed by PTEN. Subsequently, Akt regulates
  amongst other proteins TSC1/2 that together with RHEB control mTORC1 and its downstream
  targets S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Both molecules are involved in the regulation of protein
  translation and cell proliferation. Crosstalk between the PI3K and the MAPK pathway
  has been demonstrated from PI3K/IRS to RAS and from ERK1/2 to TSC1/2 and PI3K. B:
  According to the present results, in urothelial carcinoma mTORC1 regulates activity
  of S6K1/S6RP whereas 4E-BP1 activation status is regulated via PI3K. Both, 4E-BP1
  and S6K1 are involved in regulating cell proliferation. Inactivation of PI3K and
  also S6K1 results in phosphorylation of RAS and ERK1/2. The inhibition of MEK1/2
  induces Akt but neither S6K1 nor 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Potential target molecules
  and stratification marker are shaped elliptical.'
