caption: '(A) ER-stress: Mutant SOD1 was shown to interact with Derlin1, a protein
  that plays a major role in the transport of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) lumen to the cytosol. This mutant SOD1-Derlin1 interaction results
  in accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER-lumen and thereby ER-stress. The
  latter provokes activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 ASK1 by a yet
  unidentified mechanism. It is not known exactly in which cells Derlin-1 and mutant
  SOD1 interact. (B) Superoxide production: A strong interaction of mutant SOD1 with
  Rac1 was recently demonstrated to result in keeping Nox in the activating stage.
  This led to the production of increased amounts of superoxide in the extracellular
  space that is toxic for neighboring cells. While the Nox pathway is intrinsically
  active in both motor neurons and glia, the disease relevant cellular site of the
  Rac1/SOD1 interaction remains unclear.'
