caption: 'Molecular cascades underlying colorectal cancer responsiveness and resistance
  to targeted therapy. Virtually all colorectal cancers (CRCs) are characterized by
  upregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway. If MAPK
  cascade is activated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) receptor, the administration
  of anti-EGFR therapeutic antibodies results in the cessation of tumor growth. There
  are instances of EGFR-independent activation of MAPK pathway caused by mutations
  in the molecules located downstream to EGFR (KRAS, NRAS or BRAF) or by collateral
  signaling (e.g., HER2 overexpression); these CRCs are resistant to EGFR blockade,
  however they may be sensitive to appropriate targeted drugs. CRC: Colorectal cancer;
  EGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor.'
