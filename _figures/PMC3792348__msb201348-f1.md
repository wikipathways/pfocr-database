caption: Synthetic circuits based on the rewired cell-signaling pathways. (A) Guanabenz-induced
  synthetic circuit for the treatment of metabolic syndrome. Cells engineered to express
  the chimeric trace amine-associated receptor (cTAAR1) respond to Guanabenz by activating
  endogenous cAMP signaling. Increased levels of cAMP activate PCRE-driven transgene
  expression of Glp-1-Leptin via a cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1).
  When implanted in mice developing symptoms of metabolic syndrome, the circuit enabled
  simultaneous targeting of several metabolic disorders (). (B) Blue light- and (C)
  radio wave-induced synthetic circuits enabling glucose homeostasis. (B) Cells engineered
  to trigger calcium influx through transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs)
  by expressing blue light-responsive melanopsin, link blue-light sensing to transgene
  expression via an NFAT-responsive promoter (PNFAT). Implanted in diabetic mice,
  the circuit enabled blue light-controlled glucose homeostasis when expressing glucagon-like
  peptide 1 (). (C) Cells engineered to trigger calcium influx through temperature-sensitive,
  His-tagged TRPCs (TRPV1HIS). Antibody-coated nanoparticles for His-tag recognition
  (NP) enabled local nanoparticle heating of TRPV1HIS, consequently allowing for calcium
  influx, linking radio-wave exposure to transgene expression via an NFAT-responsive
  promoter (PNFAT). Implanted in mice, the circuit enabled radio wave-controlled regulation
  of blood glucose levels by expressing insulin (). (D) Synthetic circuit responsive
  to endogenous proteins allow for disease-targeted cell death. The RNA-based devise
  is composed of specific aptamers for p50/p65 recognition (white circle), localized
  at key intronic positions near an alternative spliced exon harboring a stop codon
  (red area) in a three-exon, two-intron minigene fused to a suicide gene (HSV-TK).
  Activation of the NF-κB pathway by stimulation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
  (TNFR) with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) enables p50/p65 regulation of exon exclusion,
  thereby linking disease markers to the killing of the diseased cells ().
