caption: Schematic of rhythmic intestinal electrolyte transport during defecation
  in worms. Resting pH of the intestinal cell and the pseudocoelomic fluid that bathes
  the cell's basolateral surface is near a physiological norm of 7.4. Lumen of the
  intestine is acidic, with pH closer to 4. Cell-autonomous oscillatory calcium signaling
  involving activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) underlies
  the defecation pacemaker and triggers calcium inflow through the transient receptor
  potential melastatin channels GTL-1 and GON-2. A calcium wave propagates through
  the intestine, moving between adjacent intestinal cells through the gap junction
  protein INX-16. Elevations in calcium appear to cause the apical membrane to become
  permeable to protons, which enter the cell through an unknown mechanism. As protons
  flow down the transmembrane gradient, the cell acidifies and the lumen alkalinizes.
  In response to acidification and, perhaps, calcium as well, the Na+/H+ exchanger
  PBO-4/NHX-7 extrudes protons across the basolateral membrane. Protons trigger the
  first muscle contraction (pBoc) in the defecation motor program by binding to the
  muscle cell receptor PBO-5. Calcium returns to baseline levels in part through the
  activity of SCA-1 (SERCA), the endoplasmic reticular (ER) membrane ATPase, and pHi
  gradually recovers from acidification. This process likely involves Na+-H+ antiport
  and V-ATPase activities (see ) but does not require NHX-7, which acts in a signaling,
  rather than a homeostatic, pathway. Eventually, luminal pH reaches ∼4, at which
  point the cytoplasm begins to acidify slightly. We hypothesize that this occurs
  as a result of metabolic processes that result in proton accumulation in the cell
  and inability of VHA-6 to export these protons, because the pH gradient has become
  too steep or because of some unknown regulatory pathway involving perhaps trafficking
  or subunit disassembly. In most acid-secreting mammalian systems, proton pumping
  requires the activity of apical K+ and Cl− channels (such as KCNE2 and CFTR); whether
  this holds true in worms as well is under investigation. Finally, protons that have
  been pumped into the lumen work to allow nutrient absorption though proton-coupled
  uptake pathways such as the H+-dipeptide symporter OPT-2. This is a representative,
  rather than an exhaustive, depiction of the transporters that function in defecation.
