caption: Toll-activating signal transduction pathways in D. melanogaster and Manduca
  sexta. (A) The D. melanogaster Toll pathway based on the revised model presented
  in Ashok 2009 []. MAMP/PRR-dependent or a MAMP-independent danger signal cascades
  can both activate Toll. (B) Current knowledge of the M. sexta Toll pathway. The
  M. sexta Toll pathway can be activated by MAMPs, but the specific PRRs and proteolytic
  cascade(s) responsible for this activation have not been reported. Known components
  of Spätzle-activation include the proteases HP6 and HP8, which are most closely
  related to the danger-pathway proteases of D. melanogaster. However, the induction
  of the Toll pathway by MAMP-independent signals has not been documented yet in M.
  sexta. Dashed lines indicate potential pathways that have not been experimentally
  proven in M. sexta. Orange boxes represent key differences between D. melanogaster
  and M. sexta Toll pathway; a red border highlights proteins or pathways not yet
  identified in M. sexta. Boxes with same color are for putative orthologous steps.
  PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition protein; GNBP, gram negative binding protein; SPE,
  Spätzle processing enzyme; HP, hemolymph proteinase.
