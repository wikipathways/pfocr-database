caption: A (a) PD-1 is highly expressed on naïve B cells. In T cell–independent humoral
  immunity, activation of PD-1 signaling inhibits the B cell receptor response and
  therefore suppresses B1 cell expansion and subsequent long-lived IgG production.
  (b) In sharp contrast with the innate-like response, PD-1 signaling acts as a promoter,
  at least partially, for T cell–dependent humoral immunity. Both follicular helper
  T (TFH) and follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells express PD-1. TFH cells, with a
  phenotype of CXCR5+PD-1hiFoxp3−, are specialized for helping germinal center (GC)
  reaction, whereas TFR cells, displaying CXCR5+PD-1hiFoxp3+, potently inhibit TFH
  cell function. In the proliferation center, the ligation of PD-1 with PD-Ls expressed
  on B cells profoundly reduces the abundance of TFR cells and increases the level
  of IL-21 produced by TFH cells, leading to an enhanced GC reaction and the formation
  of long-lived plasma cells and memory cells. (B) However, a specific B cell subset
  that highly expresses PD-L1 can suppress TFH cell function in a PD-L1–dependent
  manner. PD-L1high B cells restrict CD4+ T cell differentiation to TFH cells by upregulating
  STAT5 and synchronous inhibition of Akt and STAT3 and therefore downregulate the
  GC reaction and reduce T cell–dependent humoral immunity.
