caption: The activity of AMPK can be modulated by the AMP:ATP ratio or triggered by
  the biguanide metformin, resulting in inhibition of mTORC1 as well as augmentation
  of fatty acid oxidation and increased transcriptional activity of FOXO protein.
  FOXO protein acts in tandem with intranuclear binding partners to regulate gene
  transcription, but its binding partners involved in the modulation of pro-memory
  genes are incompletely elucidated. The PI3K-AKT pathway is activated by cytokine
  receptor engagement as well as T cell receptor and co-stimulatory receptor signaling
  (not shown) resulting in the downstream activation of mTORC1. PI3K-AKT activity
  can phosphorylate FOXO protein, promoting its cytosolic sequestration (not shown).
  PI3K can be inhibited by LY294002 or a number of small molecules which have recently
  entered clinical trials. In addition to indirect inhibition through modulation of
  upstream targets, mTORC1 may also be directly inhibited by rapamycin and its analogs.
  The activity of GSK-3β inhibits mTORC1 through activation of TSC2 as well as targets
  β-catenin for proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of GSK-3β using TWS119 mimics
  Wnt signaling by promoting β-catenin accumulation and translocation into the nucleus,
  where it binds to partners including LEF and TCF to promote gene transcription.
