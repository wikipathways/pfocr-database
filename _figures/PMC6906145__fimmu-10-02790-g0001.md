caption: Regulatory pathways for Arid5a under TLR4 signaling. The schematic diagram
  shows the gene expression of Arid5a (black arrow) induced by the TLR4/IKK/NF-κB
  and IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways. LPS-bound TLR4 leads to the release of NF-κB
  from the IKK complex and activates Arid5a and other inflammatory genes, such as
  Il-6. Arid5a then stabilizes Il-6 mRNA (blue arrow), increasing the production of
  IL-6. Another pathway shows the posttranscriptional regulation of Arid5a mRNA (blue
  arrow), in which TLR4 signaling stimulates MKP-1, which in turn directs AUF-1 to
  translocate to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic AUF-1 binds to AU-rich elements present
  in the 3′UTR of the Arid5a mRNA transcript, which results in destabilization of
  the Arid5a mRNA (blue arrow). The LPS/TLR4 pathway activates p38, leading to phosphorylation
  of the Arid5a protein at serine residues 253, 433, and 458. This phosphorylation
  is associated with the ubiquitination of Arid5a at lysines 80 and 89 by WWP1 E3
  ligase and subsequent degradation of the protein.
