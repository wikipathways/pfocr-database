caption: New roles for FIH in the regulation of the HIF response. (A) The HIF-α protein
  contains two independent transcriptional activation domain (N-TAD and C-TAD), the
  N-TAD overlaps with the CODDD. PHD enzymes hydroxylate the prolyl residue present
  in the N-TAD, while FIH hydroxylates the asparaginyl residue in the C-TAD. In high
  oxygen concentration, both PHD and FIH are active, resulting in no HIF-regulated
  genes activated. As the oxygen tension decreases, PHD is inactivated, resulting
  in expression of N-TAD-sensitive genes. In strong hypoxia, both PHD and FIH are
  inactivated, resulting in expression of N-TAD and C-TAD-sensitive genes []. (B)
  FIH can hydroxylate either ARD or HIF-α proteins. Sequestration of FIH by ARD inhibits
  HIF asparaginyl hydroxylation []. (C) HIF-α can be degraded via either PHD-dependent
  or -independent pathways. FIH hydroxylation of HIF is proposed to protect HIF degradation
  via the PHD-independent pathway [].
