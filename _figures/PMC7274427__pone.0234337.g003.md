caption: (A) In a healthy scenario of cellular conditions RB binds the transduction
  factor E2F1 to arrest the cell cycle. (B) Loss of RB could induce cell proliferation,
  however, the presence of p53 tumour suppressor will induce apoptosis of damaged
  cells, avoiding tumour development. (C) The loss of RB and the dysregulation of
  p53 pathway due to MDMX or MDM2 will promote cell proliferation and tumour development.
