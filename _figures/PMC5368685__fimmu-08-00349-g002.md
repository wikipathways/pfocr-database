caption: 'Pro-inflammatory response through TLR: various antigenic molecules are recognized
  differentially by TLRs, which produce pro-inflammatory responses. Hemozoin, released
  on rupture of infected erythrocyte, triggers MyD88-mediated signals through TLR9
  receptor in host immune cells, and TLR7 is activated by unknown ligand to produce
  the same response. In dendritic cells, TLR9 activated by unknown ligand causes the
  differentiation of T cells to regulatory T cell, which suppress the activity of
  effector T cells. Antigenic protein peroxiredoxin stimulates TLR4 on mast cells,
  which activate MAPK and NF-κB pathway in MyD88-dependent manner, thereby ultimately
  releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines. TLR2 coupled with TLR 1 or TLR6 in host immune
  cells recognizes GPIs on parasitic surface to induce the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokine through the activation of NF-κB and AP-1. TLR, toll-like receptor; MyD
