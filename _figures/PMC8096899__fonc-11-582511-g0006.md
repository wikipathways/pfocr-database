caption: The signal path diagram of p38 MAPK/MDM2/p53. After treatment with 125I seed,
  MDM2 was downregulated, and the combination of MDM2 and p53 was reduced, which resulted
  in a stable transcription of p53. The p53, which has transcription activity, went
  into the nucleus via the activation of downstream apoptotic proteins, which eventually
  contributed to apoptosis.
