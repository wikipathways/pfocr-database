caption: 'Proposed model of the interaction between EV-D68 VP3 and MAVS. When cells
  are infected with SeV, or when MAVS is overexpressed in cells, MAVS is activated
  to initiate a series of downstream signals and interfere with viral replication.
  After the EV-D68 virus enters cells, it is recognized by RIG-I-like receptors and
  transmits signals to MAVS. The interaction of the structural protein VP3 of EV-D68
  with MAVS includes: (1) VP3 of EV-D68 can bind to the TM domain of MAVS and induce
  MAVS leakage from the mitochondria; and (2) VP3 negatively regulates the NF-κB signaling
  pathway downstream of MAVS. RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene I; MDA5, melanoma
  differentiation-gene 5; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; NF-κB,
  nuclear factor kappa-B; IκB, inhibitor of NF-κB. The image was created with BioRender.com'
