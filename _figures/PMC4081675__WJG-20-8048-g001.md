caption: 'Signaling pathways regulating hepatic stellate cell activation in alcoholic
  liver disease. Alcohol consumption causes hepatocyte damage, which subsequently
  induces apoptosis. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) oxidizes alcohol to acetaldehyde
  that is converted to acetate by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Acetaldehyde
  directly targets hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Alcohol reduces glutathione (GSH)
  synthesis and acetaldehyde inhibits GSH activity in hepatocytes. Levels of the S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAMe) are also markedly reduced. Alcohol consumption increases permeability of
  the intestine to bacterial endotoxin that in turn, elevates serum lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) levels. LPS directly enhances HSCs activation by upregulating transforming
  growth factor (TGF)- signaling. TGF-β1 derived from activated Kupffer cells and
  damaged hepatocytes binds to TGF receptors. Phospho-Smad2/3 and Smad4 complexes
  translocate into the nucleus, display DNA-binding activity, and activate expression
  of genes related to fibrosis. Extracellular molecules, such as LPS, tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), activate
  IκB kinase (IKK) that, in turn, phosphorylates IκB, resulting in ubiquitination,
  dissociation of IκBα from nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and eventually, degradation
  of IκB by the proteasome. The activated NF-κB is then translocated into the nucleus
  and binds to specific DNA response elements. NF-B-dependent pathways are involved
  in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2). Leptin
  binds ObRb, activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and inducing
  matrix deposition by increasing expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases
  (TIMPs). Leptin also inhibits matrix degradation by decreasing expression of Matrix
  metalloproteinases (MMPs). Osteopontin (OPN) positively stimulates the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. The cannabinoid receptor CB2 mediates antifibrotic actions; in contrast,
  activation of CB1 receptors positively stimulates the PI3K/Akt pathway to promote
  the proliferation and apoptosis of HSCs. TLR: Toll-like receptor.'
