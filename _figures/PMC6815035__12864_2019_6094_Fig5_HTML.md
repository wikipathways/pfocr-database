caption: 'The miRNA–mRNA interaction networks containing eleven lipid metabolism or
  deposition related pathways. The dot indicates miRNA, and the box indicates a target
  gene that had a negative correlation with a given miRNA. Red indicates up-regulated,
  green indicates down-regulated, and yellow indicates a miRNA that was up-regulated
  in a given comparison combination and was down-regulated in other comparison combinations.
  The eleven pathways are fatty acid degradation, fatty acid metabolism, biosynthesis
  of unsaturated fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis,
  arachidonic acid metabolism, fatty acid elongation, glycerophospholipid metabolism,
  glycerolipid metabolism, the adipocytokine signaling pathway and the PPAR signaling
  pathway. The miRNA–mRNA pairs in each pathway are shown in Additional file : Table
