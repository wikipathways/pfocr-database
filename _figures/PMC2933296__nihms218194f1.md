caption: LTβR signaling regulates mTECs development and function in various ways.
  LTβR controls mTECs differentiation, however, it remains unknown at which stage
  and how LTβR controls this process. LTβR is not essential for Aire thymic expression
  but is indeed essential for expression of some Aire-dependent and Aire-independent
  TRA on a per cell basis. In addition, LTβR might have more impact on TRA expression
  in certain subsets of mTECs than others. The underlying molecular mechanism remains
  to be determined. LTβR signaling also controls mTECs organization and chemokine
  production, which may indirectly regulate thymocyte migration or TRA expression
  and presentation to developing thymocytes. It is unclear which cells deliver which
  ligand(s) to LTβR for control of mTEC differentiation, TRA and chemokine expression;
  LT seems to play only a partial role. It is also intriguing whether TCR-pMHC interaction
  between thymocytes and mTECs is required for LTβR to exert its roles.
