caption: A, Wild type (WT) HIV-1 capsids are bound by cytoplasmic cyclophilin A (CypA)
  molecules that direct the capsid to use a specific nuclear entry pathway. The nuclear
  entry pathway involves CA binding to the cyclophilin domain of the cytoplasmic nuclear
  pore complex (NPC) component Nup358. Nup358 may mediate uncoating directly at the
  nuclear pore, liberating the pre-integration complex, which will interact with TRN-SR2
  and the nuclear NPC component Nup153. B, Inhibition of CypA-CA interaction by the
  drug cyclosporine (Cs) or by substitution of CA residues that abolish CypA binding
  directs the virus into a less productive CypA-independent nuclear entry pathway
  that displays impaired dependence on Nup358 and Nup153. This route of nuclear entry
  results in virus integration preferences in areas of higher density of transcription
  units and associated features. C, HIV-1 capsid mutants that are less sensitive to
  Nup358, Nup153 or TRN-SR2 RNAi (HIV-1 CA N57A or N74D) enter the nucleus through
  a different pathway that directs their integration into genome areas of lower density
  of transcription units. D, Depletion of Nup358 by RNAi reduces viral nuclear entry
  via the Nup358-dependent pathway and the virus gains access via an Nup358-independent
  alternative pathway resulting in phenotypically similar integration site selection
  as observed for the CA mutants N74D or N57A. Alternative nuclear entry pathways
  disturb HIV-1 integration site selection, possibly contributing to sub-optimal replication
  of the virus in spreading infection assays.

  description: A, Wild type (WT) HIV-1 capsids are bound by cytoplasmic cyclophilin
    A (CypA) molecules that direct the capsid to use a specific nuclear entry pathway.
    The nuclear entry pathway involves CA binding to the cyclophilin domain of the
    cytoplasmic nuclear pore complex (NPC) component Nup358. Nup358 may mediate uncoating
    directly at the nuclear pore, liberating the pre-integration complex, which will

    abolish CypA binding directs the virus into a less productive CypA-independent
    nuclear entry pathway that displays impaired dependence on Nup358 and Nup153.
    This route of nuclear entry results in virus integration preferences in areas
    of higher density of transcription units and associated features. C, HIV-1 capsid
    mutants that are less sensitive to Nup358, Nup153 or TRN-SR2 RNAi (HIV-1 CA N57A
