caption: A. Shown is a schematic view of the cholesterol synthetic pathway. Zymosterol
  and desmosterol are among the RORγ agonists with the highest affinity. Deficiency
  in Fdft1 or Cyp51A1, enzymes acting upstream in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway,
  inhibit the synthesis of downstream RORγ agonists subsequently leading to reduced
  RORγt activation and Th17 differentiation. FDT1, Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase
  1; SQLE, Squalene Epoxidase; LSS, Lanosterol Synthase; TM7SF2, Transmembrane 7 Superfamily
  Member 2 (C-14 Sterol Reductase); FAXDC2/SC4MOL, Fatty Acid Hydroxylase Domain Containing
  2/Methylsterol Monooxygenase 1; NSDHL, NAD(P) Dependent Steroid Dehydrogenase-Like;

  DHCR24, 24-Dehydrocholesterol Reductase. B. Schematic view of RORγ-mediated transcriptional
  activation of target genes by endogenous sterol agonists and its inhibition by antagonists.
  The circadian clock regulates RORγ expression and as a consequence the expression
  of RORγ target genes. Prox1 modulates RORγ transcriptional activity. The in vivo
  consensus RORE derived from ChIP-Seq analysis using liver tissue and an anti-RORγ
  antibody, is shown.
