caption: Signaling network of the MSC components related to protein synthesis and
  cancer. A, cancer-related signaling network mediated by the MSC-forming ARSs and
  AIMPs. LRS functioning as a leucine sensor interacts with the RagD GTPase to stimulate
  the mTOR pathway (, ). KRS forms a metastasis-promoting interaction with the 67-kDa
  laminin receptor in the cell membrane (, ). Caspase-8 cleaves the N-terminal 12
  amino acids of KRS, exposing its PDZ-binding motif at the C terminus. Syntenin binds
  to the exposed PDZ-binding motif of KRS and facilitates the exosome-mediated secretion
  of MSC-dissociated KRS (). Induced by growth stimuli, MRS is translocated to the
  nucleoli to stimulate rRNA synthesis (). MRS binds to and stabilizes CDK4 to promote
  the cell cycle in p16-negative cancers (). QRS binds to apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase 1 (ASK1) to regulate apoptosis in a glutamine-dependent manner (). EPRS forms
  the GAIT (interferon γ–activated inhibitor of translation) complex with other cell
  factors to regulate the expression of VEGF-A mRNA (). AIMP2 is one of three nonenzymatic
  factors, and it works as a potent tumor suppressor through multiple pathways, including
  TGF-β- (), TNFα- (), Wnt- (), and p53 ()-mediated pathways. AIMP3 is mobilized to
  the nucleus by DNA damage (, ) or via an oncogenic stimulus () to activate p53 via
  ATM/ATR for DNA repair. B, MRS forms a complex with AIMP3 via their GST-homology
  domains (). AIMP3 relays methionylated tRNA to the initiation factor to facilitate
  protein synthesis (). However, upon DNA damage, MRS is phosphorylated by the activated
  GCN2 at the serine 662 residue that blocks tRNAMet binding, leading to the inhibition
  of protein synthesis (). The dissociated AIMP3 is translocated into nucleus and
  activates ATM and ATR for DNA repair ().
