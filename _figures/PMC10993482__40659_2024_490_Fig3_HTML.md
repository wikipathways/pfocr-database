caption: Galectin pathways to tissue repair involving EMT. (a) Gal-2 and Gal-4 promote
  wound healing very likely involving glycan-mediated cell surface interactions and
  TGF-β-mediated signaling, as their effects are blocked by lactose and antibodies
  against TGF-β; (b) Gal-3 activates the α3β1 integrin/FAK/Rac1 pathway in a carbohydrate-dependent
  manner to promote re-epithelialization; (c) Gal-3 promotes the formation of β4-integrin/laminin332/EGFR
  clusters leading to ERK signaling activation, enhancing cell migration in a carbohydrate
  dependent manner. It also links EGFR to ALIX function that may be involved in EGFR
  pathway to endocytic recycling; (d) Extracellular Gal-3 binds to CD147 promoting
  detachment of retinal pigment epithelial cells from the epithelia in a carbohydrate-dependent
  manner through an unknown signaling pathway; (e) Matrix metalloproteinase MMP-7
  can control Gal-3 function through degradation, as shown in wound closure experiments
  with colon cancer epithelial cells; (f) Gal-7 interacts with E-cadherin stabilizing
  its location on the plasma membrane and favoring collective cell migration in a
  carbohydrate-independent manner, as shown by the lack of lactose blocking effect
