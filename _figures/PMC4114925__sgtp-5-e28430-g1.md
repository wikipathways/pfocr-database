caption: 'Figure 1. Drawing representing the MT-RhoA-mDia signaling pathway at the
  leading edge of migrating fibroblasts. Molecules are drawn schematically, roughly
  preserving relative molecular sizes and when possible, known crystallographic and/or
  functional spatial conformations. (A) Dynamic MTs: In the absence of LPA, most MTs
  in wound-facing fibroblasts are highly dynamic showing high rate of α/β heterodimer
  exchange on + tips. The MTs contain + tips proteins, like EB1 and APC having a comet-like
  appearance, being highly enriched at the most distal part of the MTs and tapering
  down within few micrometers. In the absence of LPA signaling, RhoA is inactive (GDP-RhoA),
  mDia (also inactive) doesn’t bind MTs; there are no focal adhesions and hence FAK
  remains inactivated. (B) Stable and/or Capped Microtubule: Upon LPA stimulation,
  focal adhesions start assembling in the leading edge of wound-facing fibroblasts.
  Typically, focal adhesion formation involves integrin receptor activation and accumulation
  leading to further enrichment of several other proteins involved in the regulation
  of the actin network, providing mechanical and signaling means for F-actin binding.
  Of particular importance during FA formation is the activation of FAK, which, among
  other effects, promotes the accumulation of GM1 on the leading edge plasma membrane
  (big dark-yellow arrow). GM1-enriched membranes provide sites for the insertion
  of RhoA, and activation by LPA receptor signaling. GTP-RhoA activation releases
  mDia auto-inhibitory conformation leading to its binding to MT + tips; mDia also
  binds EB1 and APC forming a trimeric protein complex which functions as a MT plus
  cap. This cap prevents heterodimer exchange stabilizing MT at the leading edge.'
