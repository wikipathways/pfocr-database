caption: Model for ethylene signal transduction that incorporates biochemical features
  of the pathway components. Soluble protein domains are shown as circles and predicting
  transmembrane structures are shown as lines. Confirmed components of the pathway
  are shown in blue; more recently proposed components are shown in orange. In air,
  ethylene receptors maintain CTR1 in an active state that serves to repress ethylene
  responses. In ethylene, the repression is relieved. Binding of ethylene inactivates
  the receptors, thereby inactivating CTR1. As a result, EIN2 is activated and a transcriptional
  cascade involving the EIN3/EIL and ERF transcription factors is initiated. Both
  families of transcription factors are involved in regulating ethylene responses.
  The protein level of EIN3 is lower in the absence of ethylene than in the presence
  of ethylene, due to degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The figure
  also incorporates components about which conflicting data has been reported, namely
  a MAPK module operating downstream of CTR1, and a two-component signalling pathway
  (AHP and ARR) functioning independently of the CTR1-mediated pathway.
