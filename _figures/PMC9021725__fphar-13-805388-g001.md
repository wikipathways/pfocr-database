caption: Molecular neurobiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. DA production generally
  regulates voluntary movements. In PD patients, initial dopaminergic neurodegeneration
  in substantia nigra pars compacta is asymptomatic. Loss of striatal–nigral neuronal
  sensitizes the D1 receptor on the medium spiny neurons of the direct pathway. This
  results in initial motor symptoms of PD (dyskinesia). The treatment with L-DOPA
  improves the initial motor symptoms and promotes BDNF release from corticostriatal
  neurons. The expressed BDNF potentiates the expression of D3Rs through the activation
  of Trκ-B receptors in nigrostriatal medium spiny neurons. Enhanced expression of
  D3Rs suppresses internalization and abnormal trafficking of membrane-bound D1Rs,
  thus intensifying D1R sensitization and associated dyskinesia. Activation of D1R
  by DA (released through L-DOPA) results in the activation of D1R/Gαolf/adenylyl
  cyclase 5 (AC5) machinery in nigrostriatal medium spiny neurons and causes cAMP-mediated
  hyperexpression of protein kinase A (PKA) and DARPP-32. The abnormal PKA/DARPP-32
  expression results in hyper-phosphorylation of GluR1 and promotes the excitability
  of medium spiny neurons contributing to the loss of long-term depression and depotentiation
  and development of LID. On the other hand, activation of D1R results in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  signaling pathway, which further potentiates Ras/Raf machinery and regulates various
  transcription and translation processes regulating LID. PKA/DARPP-32 and/or ERK/Elk/MSK1
  signaling migrates to the nucleus, leads to phosphorylation of CREB/histone H3,
  and augments the expression of immediate early genes (prodynorphin and ΔFosB), which
  are reported to contribute to the development of LID. Activated ERK further elevates
  mTORC1 expression-mediated mRNA translation and worsens LID.
