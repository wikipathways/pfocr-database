caption: Schematic representation of X. dendrorhous mutant strains. (A) In the mutant
  XdCop6, the native astaxanthin pathway has not been modified but the gene Cop6 has
  been integrated in the rDNA of the yeast allowing the mutant to produce both astaxanthin
  and α-cuprenene. (B) In the strain ΔE-Cop6 the Cop6 gene has been inserted in the
  crtE gene causing the disruption of the carotenoid production at the GGPP synthesis
  level. (C) When Cop6 is inserted in the crtYB gene, the ΔYB-Cop6 strain is created.
  While there is still expression of the GGPPS, phytoene cannot be produced anymore,
  blocking the production of astaxanthin one step downstream of the ΔE-Cop6.
