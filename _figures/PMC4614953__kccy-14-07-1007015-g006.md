caption: Model for the regulation of Hippo signaling by CEP161. In D. discoideum,
  CEP161 interacts with Hrk-svk and reduces its auto- and trans-phosphorylation ability
  presumably leading to an inhibition of the pathway. CEP161 influence on Hippo pathway
  components is shown in various colors, with black pointed arrows for direct interactions
  and red blunt lines indicating inhibitory interactions and blue arrows point to
  the affected functions.
