  Another class of secondary metabolic compounds are alkaloids. This is a diverse
  group of nitrogen containing molecules, often with a function in plant defense.
  Our expression set suggests that biosynthesis of tropane alkaloids is upregulated
  in B. cinerea infected tissue. ARGININE DECARBOXYLASE (AGD) was significantly upregulated
  (2/2). AGD converts Arginine into agmatine, which can be further converted into
  putrescine and finally tropinone. Our data contained 9 DEGs for TROPINONE REDUCTASE
  I (TR-I; 16 genes) which reduces tropinone to tropine.'
