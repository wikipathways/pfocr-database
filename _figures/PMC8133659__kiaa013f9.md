caption: A working model for the role of lipid metabolism in plant acclimation to
  different growth light levels. Growth under LL or HL promotes thylakoid stacking
  or unstacking, respectively. These changes in thylakoid architecture alter cellular
  demands for fatty acids, which trigger post-translational mechanisms that regulate
  ACCase activity and hence fatty acid synthesis. In addition, long-term changes in
  growth light levels also modulate fatty acid flow through two parallel pathways
  of glycerolipid assembly, with LL promoting the plastid but suppressing the eukaryotic
  pathway, whereas HL causes opposite effects on fatty acid flux through the two pathways.
  Growth under HL conditions enhances TAG synthesis in the chloroplast and the ER,
  manifested as increased accumulation of lipid droplets in both compartments. The
  increased TAG accumulation in HL may increase fatty acid flux toward the peroxisomal
  β-oxidation pathway. Blue and red arrows indicate increased or decreased enzymatic
  and pathway activities, respectively, under LL or HL compared with those under NL
  growth conditions. Dash arrows indicate limited pathway activities. Question marks
  denote the steps that remain to be experimentally verified. Chl, chloroplast; FA,
  fatty acid; FAS, fatty acid synthase; GL, glycolipid; PL, phospholipid.
