caption: Proposed model of how TWEAK accelerates cyst progression in ADPKD. (A) Mechanism
  of cyst formation and expansion in ADPKD. In ADPKD nephrons, all tubular epithelial
  cells contain one mutated and one unaffected copy of PKD1 or PKD2. According to
  the “two-hit” model of cystogenesis, a second mutation occurs in the unaffected
  allele in an individual tubular epithelial cell. When the level of functional PC1
  or PC2 (products of PKD1 and PKD2, respectively) falls below a critical threshold,
  cyst formation is initiated. Once cysts are formed, multiple molecular pathways
  are deregulated, and cysts progressively increase in size. Advanced ADPKD is characterized
  by macrophage infiltration, proinflammatory chemoattractants, and inflammation-dependent
  renal injury. In this study, we report that TWEAK and Fn14 are upregulated in ADPKD
  and contribute to cyst progression. (B) TWEAK pathway. TWEAK is a trimeric cytokine
  that binds to the Fn14 receptor after trimerization. TWEAK and Fn14 are present
  in epithelial renal cells and regulate cell proliferation, inflammation, NF-κB activation,
  and other pathways. We report that targeting TWEAK with a neutralizing antibody
  reduced the expression of key ADPKD-related protein markers, such as AKT and p38
  (proliferative way), Arg1 (M2 macrophage polarization), Mcp1 (M1 macrophage polarization
  and canonic NF-κB activation), and p65 (canonical NF-κB activation), and reduced
  macrophage infiltration. Our results suggest the TWEAK/Fn14 axis is a new potential
  therapeutic target for ADPKD.

  description: Proposed model of how TWEAK accelerates cyst progression in ADPKD.
    (A) Mechanism of cyst formation and expansion in ADPKD. In ADPKD nephrons, all
    tubular epithelial cells contain one mutated and one unaffected copy of PKD1 or
    PKD2. According to the “two-hit” model of cystogenesis, a second mutation occurs

    of functional PC1 or PC2 (products of PKD1 and PKD2, respectively) falls below
    a critical threshold, cyst formation is initiated. Once cysts are formed, multiple
    molecular pathways are deregulated, and cysts progressively increase in size.
    Advanced ADPKD is characterized by macrophage infiltration, proinflammatory chemoattractants,
    and inflammation-dependent renal injury. In this study, we report that TWEAK and
    Fn14 are upregulated in ADPKD and contribute to cyst progression. (B) TWEAK pathway.
    TWEAK is a trimeric cytokine that binds to the Fn14 receptor after trimerization.
    TWEAK and Fn14 are present in epithelial renal cells and regulate cell proliferation,
    inflammation, NF-κB activation, and other pathways. We report that targeting TWEAK
    with a neutralizing antibody reduced the expression of key ADPKD-related protein
