caption: CRAC channel regulation by multiple Ca2+-sensing molecules in the ER and
  cytoplasm. (A) Schematic showing a possible mechanism of CRAC channel regulation.
  Under resting conditions, Orai1 and STIM1 are distributed at the PM and the ER membrane.
  Junctate is located at ER-PM junctions in a Ca2+-bound form via its ER-luminal EF
  hand domain (indicated in gray). Cytoplasmic Ca2+ sensors such as CRACR2A and calmodulin
  are not bound to Ca2+ in resting conditions. (B) Upon store depletion, STIM1 oligomerizes
  by sensing ER Ca2+ depletion with its ER-luminal EF-hand domain, and translocates
  to form clusters at the ER-PM junctions. By physical interactions with Orai1 through
  the CAD/SOAR domain (depicted in red), clustered STIM1 recruits and activates Orai1
  in the ER-PM junctions. During the process, junctate loses bound Ca2+ and supports
  STIM1 recruitment into ER-PM junctions. CRACR2A is recruited into the Orai1-STIM1
  complex to stabilize their interactions. (C) Following the increase of cytoplasmic
  [Ca2+], CRACR2A dissociates from the Orai1-STIM1 complex. Ca2+-bound calmodulin
  interacts with the N terminus of Orai1 and inactivates the channel via a mechanism
  called fast inactivation. The slow inactivation of CRAC channels depends on Ca2+
  entry and interaction with SARAF. After channel inactivation, once the ER is refilled
  with Ca2+, Orai1 and STIM1 return to the resting status.
