caption: Interaction between the WNT/β-catenin pathway and the Hippo pathway. Crosstalk
  between the YAP/TAZ and TGF-β pathways is observed. TAZ interacts with Smad2/Smad3
  [] to induce the nuclear transfer of Smad2/3 and then to transcribe the PAI-1 and
  Smad target genes. In the cytosol, TAZ is bound to the WNT/β-catenin signaling by
  a TAZ/β-catenin complex []. WNT stimulation is associated with the inhibition of
  the β-catenin destruction complex, resulting in cytosolic β-catenin accumulation
  and its nuclear translocation for stimulating the different WNT targets. Following
  WNT activation, TAZ decreases the DSH phosphorylation and liberates it from the
  destruction complex. The destruction complex is destroyed because YAP and TAZ dissociate
  from the complex. Following TGF-β1 stimulation, AXIN leads to the enhancement of
  the tail-phosphorylation of Smad2/3. The stimulated Smad2/3-Smad4 complex interacts
  with TAZ and YAP and translocates to the nucleus for the stimulation of the Smad
  targets. TGF-β1 leads to Smad2/3 and PI3K/Akt signaling overactivation. The nuclear
  translocation of β-catenin blocks the degradation of TAZ. This relationship of TAZ
  with the WNT/β-catenin pathway is independent of its role as a mediator of the Hippo
  pathway. When WNT/β-catenin signaling activity is decreased, the cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ
  specifically interacts with AXIN [].

  description: Interaction between the WNT/β-catenin pathway and the Hippo pathway.
    Crosstalk between the YAP/TAZ and TGF-β pathways is observed. TAZ interacts with
    Smad2/Smad3 [] to induce the nuclear transfer of Smad2/3 and then to transcribe
    the PAI-1 and Smad target genes. In the cytosol, TAZ is bound to the WNT/β-catenin
    signaling by a TAZ/β-catenin complex []. WNT stimulation is associated with the
    inhibition of the β-catenin destruction complex, resulting in cytosolic β-catenin
    accumulation and its nuclear translocation for stimulating the different WNT targets.
    Following WNT activation, TAZ decreases the DSH phosphorylation and liberates
    it from the destruction complex. The destruction complex is destroyed because
    YAP and TAZ dissociate from the complex. Following TGF-β1 stimulation, AXIN leads
    to the enhancement of the tail-phosphorylation of Smad2/3. The stimulated Smad2/3-Smad4
    complex interacts with TAZ and YAP and translocates to the nucleus for the stimulation
    of the Smad targets. TGF-β1 leads to Smad2/3 and PI3K/Akt signaling overactivation.
    The nuclear translocation of β-catenin blocks the degradation of TAZ. This relationship
    of TAZ with the WNT/β-catenin pathway is independent of its role as a mediator
    of the Hippo pathway. When WNT/β-catenin signaling activity is decreased, the
    cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ specifically interacts with AXIN [].
