caption: Model depicting the interaction of CArG-box and ARF binding elements in Arabidopsis
  inferred through site-directed mutagenesis, motif swapping and auxin applications.
  Black bold solid line indicates proximal promoter and black solid line symbolizes
  the large 1st intron in the coding region. Backward arrow marks the transcription
  start site. Arrow shows activation, while blocked line indicates repression. Deep
  sky blue box indicates promoter that allow constitutive expression in vegetative
  and floral tissues; *, core promoter CArG-box; Black solid box represent 200 bp
  highly conserved region in the large 1st intron in the coding region; ⊗, ARF binding
  site; White empty solid box symbolizes exon.
