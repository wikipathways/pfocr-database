caption: Uptake and export of iron from endothelial Cells of the blood–brain barrier
  are likely increased in alcohol use disorder, leading to brain iron dyshomeostasis.
  Alcohol misuse leads to systemic iron overload and to increased expression of α-synuclein.
  Recent evidence places apo- and holo-transferrin and Tim1 as central players in
  regulated iron loading at the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Ferritin is the primary
  storage form of iron in endothelial cells, and ferroportin is the main export pathway
  of iron across endothelial cells. (1) Alcohol reduces expression of the hormone
  hepcidin, leading to increases in the iron transport proteins DMT-1 and ferroportin,
  causing the build-up of the labile iron pool (LIP) Fe (II) and increased brain iron
  accumulation. (2) The mRNA of α-Syn has a uniquely configured iron responsive element
  (IRE) which binds to the translational repressor, iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP-1).
  Iron binding to the IRP removes it from the IRE, allowing the translation of α-Syn
  mRNA to proceed. (3) This leads to increases in α-Syn protein expression and increased
  functional α-Syn with intact ferriductase activity, leading to further increases
  in the LIP. (4) The resulting increase in α-Syn expression may lead to α-Syn aggregation
  and, in the absence of increased ferritin (FtH) for iron storage, increased oxidative
  stress and cell death.
