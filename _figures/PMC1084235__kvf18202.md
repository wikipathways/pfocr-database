caption: Fig. 2. Schematic representation of calcineurin regulation of gene expression
  in mammalian cells. Activation of phospholipase C in response to an external calcium
  mobilizing signal generates 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DG). IP3
  induces calcium release from internal stores (shown in yellow). Calcium binds to
  calmodulin (CaM), which binds and activates calcineurin (CN). CN dephosphorylates
  cytoplasmic NFAT (NFAT-P), thereby exposing a nuclear localization signal. Upon
  removal of calcium, the sites dephosphorylated by CN are phosphorylated by glycogen
  synthase kinase (GSK3), and NFAT is rapidly exported from the nucleus. Thus, persistent
  activation requires refilling of the IP3-sensitive stores by calcium influx from
  the external medium. NFAT induction of cytokines and activation of genes involved
  in morphogenesis is dependent on the concomitant activation of the protein kinase
  C (PKC) pathway by DG. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, phosphorylation by a calcium-stimulated
  kinase and dephosphorylation by CN of different serines activates the myocyte enhancer
  binding factor 2 (MEF2). Activation of both MEF2 and NFAT are implicated in muscle
  differentiation, cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis. The immunosuppressive drugs
  FK506 and cyclosporin A (CSA) inhibit the dephosphorylation of NFAT and MEF2.
