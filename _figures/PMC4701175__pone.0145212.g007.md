caption: The nuclear receptor mediated pathway is activated by E2 and blocked by Tamoxifen
  (Tam) in most cell types. Activation of GPR30 is inhibited by G15 and initiated
  by E2, Tam or G1, leading to activation/secretion of MMP-9, which cleaves occludin
  in extracellular Domain D, resulting in a defective HCV receptor.
