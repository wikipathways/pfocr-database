caption: During hypoglycemia, the initiation and coordinatation of the counterregulatory
  response is mediated by a network of glucose sensing neurons in the hypothalamus,
  including the ventromedial nucleus (VMN), arcuate nucleus (ARC) and lateral hypothalamus
  (LH). Glucose sensing also occurs in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and dorsal
  motor nucleus of the vagus (DVN) in the hindbrain. The NTS also receives afferent
  information from peripheral glucose sensors, including the portal vein. Hypothalamic
  and hindbrain neural networks project to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
  (PVN) in order to elicit autonomic and neuroendocrine counterregulatory responses.
  Although not directly glucose sensing, parvicellular neurons in the PVN initiate
  sympathetic autonomic responses via pre-ganglionic spinal efferents. Parasympathetic
  (vagal) innervation is relayed from the PVN to the dorsal vagal nucleus (DVN) which
  then relays to peripheral organs. In addition, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  axis is also initiated from a distinct set of medial parvicellar neurons within
  the PVN that secretes corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). CRH acts on the anterior
  pituitary (Pit) to stimulate the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
  which circulates to the adrenal cortex to increase cortisol secretion. Interneurons
  involved in the neural glucose sensing and autonomic response network shown in black.
  Afferent glucose sensing pathways are shown in green. Efferent autonomic responses
  to hypoglycemia shown in brown. Post-ganglionic vagal parasympathetic efferent pathway
  shown in red. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis shown in blue.
