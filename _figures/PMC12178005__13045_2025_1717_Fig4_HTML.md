caption: Signaling pathways of diverse types of collagen affecting tumor progression
  by regulating tumor immunity. This figure illustrates mechanisms of diverse types
  of collagen (COL) regulating tumor immunity. The deficiency of COL I can upregulate
  CXCL5 through SOX9, leading to the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells
  (MDSCs) and the suppression of anti-tumor immune response. The interaction between
  cleaved COL I and DDR1 activates the DDR1/PKCθ/SYK/NF-κB signaling pathway in the
  PDAC, promoting CXCL5 synthesis. Additionally, DDR1/PYK2/JNK1/c-Jun is another signaling
  pathway through which cleaved COL I regulating tumor immunity. At the same time,
  intact COL I exerts the reverse effect. Moreover, an immunosuppressive microenvironment
  is formed by the activation of the downstream Integrin α3β1/FAK/AKT/ERK signaling
  pathway. The interaction of COL with LAIR-1, an inhibitory receptor expressed on
  the surface of immune cells, activates downstream SHP-1, inducing CD8+ T cell exhaustion.
  LAIR2 inhibits this process. The endotrophin peptide (ETP), a c5 fragment of COL6A3
  cleavage, enhances tumor metastasis by inducing TGF-β-dependent epithelial mesenchymal
  transition. In addition, COL VI ETP increases macrophage recruitment and upregulates
  inflammatory factors such as IL-6 and TNF-α to promote tumor inflammation. In human
  models of triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) and head and neck cancers, DDR1
  maintains tumor cell dormancy through COL III and STAT1. These diverse mechanisms
  highlight how collagens can exert both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic functions
