caption: EP1 signaling in keratinocytes. Ligand activation of the EP1 receptor causes
  conformation changes resulting in activation of the heterotrimeric G protein, Gq.
  Activation causes release of GDP from the Gα subunit and the binding of GTP, which
  is associated with release of Gβγ and activation of phospholipase C beta (PLCβ).
  Activated PLCβ hydrolyzes phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate to 1,2-diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 raises cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels
  via movement from endoplasmic reticulum stores, leading to activation of calcium
  signaling pathways. DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), which subsequently activates
  the MAPK pathway via Raf-1 activation. PKC can also be activated by the phorbol
  ester tumor promoters; chronic activation of EP1 may confer tumor promoting/progression
  activity through PKC
