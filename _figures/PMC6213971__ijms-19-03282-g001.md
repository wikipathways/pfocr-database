caption: Regulation of PTPIP51 interactions in normal cells (represented by the HaCat
  cell line). Activation of the EGFR via the binding of EGF induces an activation
  of Raf-1 via several signaling molecules. Raf-1 depicts the MAPKKK of the ERK signaling.
  Its activation triggers a signaling cascade via MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, which ultimately
  initiates transcription. The EGFR also phosphorylates the Tyr176 residue of PTPIP51
  and thereby inhibits its interaction with Raf-1. This mechanism prevents an overshooting
  activation of the MAPK pathway. The right side of the figure represents the interactions
  when EGFR is inhibited. The inhibition of EGFR leads to an omission of Tyr176 phosphorylation
  of PTPIP51 via the EGFR. The dephosphorylation of PTPIP51 at Tyr176 induces the
  formation of the Raf-1/14-3-3β/PTPIP51 complex and thus a stimulation of the MAPK
  pathway. This mechanism partially compensates for the EGFR inhibition (black arrows
  indicate a phosphorylation/activation; dotted black arrows indicate a reduced phosphorylation/activation)
  (A); regulation of PTPIP51 interactions in insulin resistance. Activation of the
  insulin receptor induces the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and the MAPK
  pathway, especially the ERK signaling. Here, PTPIP51 stimulates the signaling on
  Raf-1 level and potentially modulates the insulin sensitivity on transcriptional
  level. Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates the Ser46 residue of PTPIP51 and thereby
  stimulates the binding of PTPIP51 and Raf-1 via 14-3-3β (black arrows indicate a
  phosphorylation/activation) (B).
