caption: A schematic figure outlining the miR signaling pathways established by aldosterone
  stimulation through the MR. Red lines represent repression and green arrows stimulation
  of expression. It is likely that several of the miRs induced by aldosterone, feedback
  to negatively regulate parts of the RAAS signaling pathway (long feedback loop).
  There is evidence for localized feedback with miR-466 repressing the expression
  of MR and SGK1 in the same cells that are stimulated by aldosterone (short feedback
  loop). The miRs and targets depicted in this figure are discussed in the text.
