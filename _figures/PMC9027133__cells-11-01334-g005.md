caption: Roles of GPR158 in synaptic organization, ion permeability and signaling
  pathway mediation. (a) Presynaptic GPR158 can interact with presynaptic GPC4 to
  form a GPR158–GPC4 complex and organize the formation of synapse. (b) GPR158 can
  recruit RGS7 to form a GPR158–RGS7 complex, regulate cAMP concentration and further
  modulate the K+ and Ca2+ ion channel. (c) OCN are proposed to activate GPR158 and
  increase the RbAP48 level, thus affect BDNF and GPR158 level, while some hormones,
  including glucorticoid and androgen, can affect the transcription of GPR158. OCN,
  osteocalcin; GPC4, glypican 4; RGS7, regulator of G protein signaling 7; cAMP, cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate. Arrows indicate increased expression and blunt head means
  suppression.
