caption: TGF-β and AMPK signaling pathways in obesity pathogenesis. The TGF-β superfamily
  consists of TGF-β1-3, GDFs, BMPs, etc., which play a diverse role in the development
  of obesity. TGF-β shows dual effects on adipogenesis/adipocyte differentiation.
  TGF-β inhibits MSC adipocyte commitment by phosphorylating and suppressing PPARγ
  and C/EBPs expression, through Smad3 signaling. However, pulsed TGF-β1 administration
  during the commitment phase shows a promotion effect on adipogenesis in MSC by down-regulating
  SERPINB2 expression. In adipocytes, TGF-β signaling is involved in adipose tissue
  dysfunction by enhancing the expression of myofibroblast signature genes. The role
  of TGF-β in BAT-associated thermogenesis is also controversial. Activation of TGF-β
  signaling by LTBP3 promotes WAT browning by modulating UCP1 expression, while hepatic
  TGF-β signaling contributes to HFD-induced steatosis and obesity by reducing mitochondrial
  respiration and inhibiting white-to-beige fat conversion. In addition, SRF - MRTF
  - axis which transcriptionally enhances the TGF-β but attenuates BMP signaling pathway
  suppresses brown adipogenesis. TGF-β/Smad3 signaling also plays a negative role
  in insulin sensitivity by suppressing PGC-1α expression in adipose tissue. BMP seems
  to play a contrary role to TGF- β in the regulation of insulin sensitivity by up-regulating
  PPARγ expression. Similar to TGF- β, the role of BMP in BAT-associated thermogenesis
  is inconsistent. BMP4 promotes WAT browning and this process is inhibited by Gremlin-1.
  However, BMP-4 signaling during the terminal differentiation phase can impair the
  acquisition of a mature brown adipocyte phenotype. GDF15, another member of TGF-β
  superfamily, was identified as a potential target for the treatment of obesity.
  By interacting with GFRAL and followed by the activation of AKT-, ERK-, and PLC-PKC
  signaling pathway, GDF15 stimulates lipolysis by up-regulating Adrb3, ATGL, and
  HSL expressions. It also inhibits food intake in a CNS-dependent manner via an unknown
  mechanism. AMPK is a heterotrimer complex. It is activated by adiponectin, ghrelin,
  etc. in CNS and LKB1 and CaMKKβ in peripheral tissue, and inactivated by GLP-1,
  leptin, etc. in CNS and PP2Cα in peripheral tissue. Activation of AMPK in CNS results
  in hyperphagia, insulin resistance, decreased thermogenesis, and weight gain. While,
  in adipocytes, it results in inhibited adipogenesis, insulin sensitiveness, enhanced
  thermogenesis, and weight loss. However, AMPK limits lipolysis since AMPK is an
  enzyme in case of energy shortage
