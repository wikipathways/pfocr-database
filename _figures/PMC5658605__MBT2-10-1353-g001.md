caption: 'Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of PLGA and
  its copolymers from xylose.The overall strategies for the production of PLGA and
  its copolymers are shown. The native pathways in E. coli are shown in black arrow.
  Coloured arrows represent heterologous pathways introduced. The inactivated metabolic
  pathways are indicated by red X, and strengthened metabolic pathway by replacement
  of native promoter is shown in bold arrow. More than one conversion steps of metabolic
  pathways are simplified using dotted arrows. The genes shown are as follows: xylA,
  xylose isomerase; xylB, xylulokinase; xylB ccs, xylose dehydrogenase; xylC ccs,
  xylonolactonase; ldhA, d‐lactate dehydrogenase; pflB, pyruvate formate lyase; poxB,
  pyruvate oxidase; adhE, acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase; frdB, fumarate reductase;
  pta, phosphotransacetylase; ack, acetate kinase; aceB, malate synthase A; glcB,
  malate synthase G; glcDEFG, glycolate oxidase; pct540, evolved propionyl‐CoA transferase;
  phaC1437, evolved PHA synthase. Metabolites shown are as follows: Xylulose‐5‐P,
  xylulose‐5‐phosphate; AcCoA, acetyl‐CoA; LA, d‐lactate; GA, glycolate; EG, ethylene
  glycol; 2HB, d‐2‐hydroxybutyrate; GA‐CoA, glycolyl‐CoA; LA‐CoA, d‐lactyl‐CoA; 2‐HB‐CoA,
  2‐d‐hydroxybutyryl‐CoA; OAA, oxaloacetate.'
