caption: 'Chemical, biological, pathway-level and phenomic correlates of drug repositioning
  a) Chemical properties of repurposed drugs: Compounds in RepurposeDB mapped to ChEBI
  ontology (structure and role merged terminologies) b) Molecular function of repurposed
  drug targets: reduced representation of molecular function terms enriched among
  drug targets of repositioned drugs c) Targets of repurposed drugs mapped to KEGG
  metabolic pathways d) Distribution of semantic similarity of indications in RepurposeDB
  using Disease Ontology, Human Phenotype Ontology and combined scores. e) Overlap
  of posthoc validation of drug repositioning investigations in RepurposeDB using
  disease-comorbidity analyses (EHR), shared genetic architectures (SGA) and pathway
  cross-talks (PCT).'
