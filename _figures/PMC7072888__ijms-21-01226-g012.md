caption: A hypothetical model of dwarfing and “hedgehog panicle” formation. S. graminicola
  colonization inhibits the expression of YUC enzyme and thus in the IPA pathway of
  auxin biosynthesis but activates the IAOx pathway regulated by amiE and nitrilase.
  These changes may be related to the disease-resistant response of foxtail millet.
  S. graminicola promotes CPS, KO, KS, and increases gibberellin content. Blocking
  of the gibberellin signal transduction also occurs, resulting in inhibition of gibberellin
  action. Abscisic acid accumulated to a relatively high level at the early developmental
  stage, and the S. graminicola then promoted the expression of abscisic acid degrading
  enzyme CYP707A, leading to the decrease of abscisic acid content.
