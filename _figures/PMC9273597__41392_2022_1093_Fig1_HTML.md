caption: Schematic diagram demonstrating the epigenetic mechanism regulating glioblastoma
  tumor micro-environment. Left, in glioblastoma, cg16983159 of STING promoter is
  hypermethylated, silencing the cGAS–STING signaling pathway, suppressing the expression
  of Type I IFN and CXCL10, thus leading to the “cold” tumor micro-environment. Right,
  when treated with DNMTi decitabine, cg16983159 of STING promoter is demethylated,
  turning on STING expression and cGAS–STING signaling, sensitizing GBM cells to immunotherapies.
