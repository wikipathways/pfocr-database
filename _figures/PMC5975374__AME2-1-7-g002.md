caption: Pathophysiological effects of the polyol pathway activated by persistent
  hyperglycemia. Activation of the polyol pathway can (1) decrease the NADPH/NADP
  + ratio and nitric oxide production; (2) induce sorbitol accumulation and osmotic
  stress; (3) increase fructose content, leading to increased protein glycation and
  development of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD); (4) increase NADH/NAD
  + ratio leading to ROS production and oxidative stress. The consequences of these
  events are diabetic complications including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy
