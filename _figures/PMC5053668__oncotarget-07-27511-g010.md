caption: CP activates p53 and the IGF-1R/AKT pathway. p53 and IGF-1R/AKT have positive
  crosstalk in CP-treated OS cells. IGF-1R/AKT activation contributes to the accumulation
  of p53 and p53 contributes to the IGF-1R/AKT activation. IGF-1R/AKT pathway activation
  maintains p53 protein levels and p53-dependent senescence, but inhibits p53s apoptotic
  function (red line). P53 contributes to IGF-1R/AKT activation and IGF-1R/AKT dependent
  survival. P53 may also increase survival by inducing cell cycle arrests that allow
  DNA repair. IGF-1R/IR inhibition had no effect on long-term survival in p53-expressing
  cells due to opposing effects of reducing p53-dependent senescence while increasing
  p53-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, IGF-1R/IR inhibition in CP-treated cells that
  lack p53 increased long term survival by stabilizing p27.
