caption: (A) Signaling diagram of the convergence of iron restriction and IFN-γ on
  PU.1. Iron restriction is postulated to contribute through its known capacity to
  enhance PKCα/β activation (), and IFN-γ through a documented IRF1/PU.1 transcriptional
  pathway (). (B) A threshold-based mechanism, in which iron restriction and inflammatory
  signaling separately do not elevate PU.1 in early erythroid progenitors enough to
  constrain erythroid output. In combination, however, these stimuli cause PU.1 levels
  to exceed a critical repressive threshold and compromise erythropoietic capacity.
  IC restores erythropoietic capacity by retaining erythroid PU.1 levels below this
  critical threshold.
