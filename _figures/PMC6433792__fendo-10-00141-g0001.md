caption: 'The role of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in the pituitary gland: After stimulation
  of somatotroph cells via GHRH, the G protein coupled receptor is activated, which
  causes a conformational change of the receptor. The Gsα subunit detaches from the
  complex, and binds to adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to
  cAMP. Elevation of intracellular cAMP leads to dissociation of the catalytic subunit
  and the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). Activation of protein kinase
  A can then phosphorylate a number of targets that regulate effector enzymes and
  ion channels as well as activates gene transcription that play a role in cell growth
  and differentiation. PDEs are fundamental in regulating this pathway, since they
  are the only enzymes capable of hydrolyzing cAMP to its inactive 5''-AMP form. PDE4A,
  PDE4B, PDE4C, PDE4D, PDE8B, and PDE11A are increased in GH-secreting adenomas, possibly
  as a compensatory mechanism. However, gsp and AIP mutations interfere with the expression
  of these PDEs.'
