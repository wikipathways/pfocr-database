caption: Proposed model for the regulation of HRas palmitoylation under physiological
  conditions and in the presence of HPHG. HRas that has been processed by being sequentially
  farnesylated, proteolysed, and carboxyl methylated is palmitoylated at Cys181 and
  Cys184 at the Golgi membrane by the palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT) under physiological
  conditions. Palmitoylation of HRas at both sites induces exocytic translocation
  of this GTPase from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, where it mediates growth factor
  signaling, including regulating the ERK pathway that is involved in endothelial
  cell survival. At the plasma membrane, HRas is depalmitoylated by the acyl protein
  thioesterase (APT), which causes the GTPase to return to the Golgi, where it can
  then be repalmitoylated and begin the transport cycle again. This cycle is disrupted
  by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by mitochondria, which are elevated by
  HPHG and can be attenuated by increased MnSOD activity. The increased ROS from the
  mitochondria in endothelial cells treated with HPHG oxidize either Cys181 or Cys184
  on HRas, leading to S-glutathiolation on either cysteine, preventing palmitoylation
  at these sites. This results in the formation of monopalmitoylated HRas, which becomes
  trapped at the Golgi, as single-site palmitoylation is insufficient to mediate efficient
  exocytic transport to the plasma membrane.
