caption: FGF receptors signal through the evolutionarily conserved SHP2/RAS/ERK pathway
  to mediate biological responses. FGF receptor activation induces FRS2(SNT) tyrosine
  phosphorylation (black circles), which in turn induces recruitment of Grb2/SOS and
  SHP2. These initial events promote the sustained activation of RAS and the ERK kinase
  cascade leading to changes in gene transcription (–, –, ). Drosophila does not have
  FRS2(SNT) proteins, but may use a different protein, DOF, as the transducer from
  receptor to RAS/ERK activation (, ). Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3´ kinase,
  STAT-1, and Src tyrosine kinase by FGF receptors also contribute to certain FGF-induced
  biological responses (–).
