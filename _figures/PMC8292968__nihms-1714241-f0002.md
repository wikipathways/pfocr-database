caption: 'Latent TGF-β can notably be activated by integrins (notably from the αV
  class) or thrombospondins. In its active form, TGF-β can interact with a specific
  heterodimeric receptor (TGF-β-R-I and -II). Two TGF-β-dependent signalization pathways
  are described: a canonical pathway involving the interaction of TGF-β-R-I with smad
  2/3 and 4; and a non-canonical pathway, Smad independent, that notably involves
  (but is not limited to) c-Abl, TAK1, p38, JNK, SRC, RhoA/ROCK and JAK2-STAT-3. TGF-β1
  also increases SSc-related oxidative stress notably through the up-regulation of
  NADPH oxidase (NOX) 4. This upregulation of NOX4 by TGF-β1 is smad3 dependent and
  results in increased collagen type I, alpha-SMA and fibronectin 1 gene expression
  in dermal fibroblasts. These effects are suppressed by pan-NOX inhibitors such as
  diphenyleneidonium (not represented) or specific NOX1/4 inhibitor such as GKT-137831
  (not represented), highlighting that NOX4 may constitute a relevant therapeutic
  target (,). IL-6 mediates its effects through its receptor (composed of IL-6Ra or
  the soluble form of IL-6R in association with a 130kDA signaling transducer (gp130))
  that activates JAK1/2/TYK2 with subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3 (predominantly)
  and STAT 1. STAT-3 acts as a key integrator of profibrotic signals. STAT3 notably
  promotes the production of key extra-cellular matrix components such as col1a1,
  col1a2, and profibrotic markers such as CTGF/CCN2 (). CTGF/CCN2 exerts profibrotic
  properties notably as a co-factor of TGF-β signaling and as a target of YAP. CTGF/CCN2
  can interact with specific receptors (such as integrins or lipoprotein receptor-related
  proteins), extra-cellular matrix proteins (such as fibronectin or perlecan) and
  growth-factors (such as VEGF and TGF-β), with subsequent activation of fibroblast
  proliferation and myofibroblasts activation, although the specific mechanisms involved
  are still to be determined (,). Rho serves as another integrator of profibrotic
  pathways and can be activated by TGF-β, LPA agonists or integrin signaling in a
  FAK dependent manner. Rho subsequently activates ROCK that participates in a cascade
  sustaining fibrotic response and induces cytoskeleton remodeling. In return, increased
  extra-cellular matrix stiffness participates in the activation of latent TGF-β perpetuating
  a pro-fibrotic pathogenic loop. IL-4 and IL-13 participate in fibrosis by inducing
  the proliferation of fibroblasts and by increasing their production of TGF-β and
  CTGF/CCN2 in a STAT6 dependent manner (). On the contrary, α-MSH and MC1-R agonists
  may exert anti-fibrotic properties by suppressing TGF-β signaling although the precise
  sub-cellular mechanisms are still to be determined.FAK=focal adhesion kinase, LPA=
