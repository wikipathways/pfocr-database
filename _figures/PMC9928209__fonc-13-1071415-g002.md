caption: Tanshinone IIA inhibits the molecular process of hepatocellular carcinoma
  (induced by Tanshinone IIA are noted by using →, while the inhibition represented
  by ⊣ symbol). The occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma is closely related to (A)
  inflammation, (B) oxidative stress, (C) cell cycle and (D) metabolic apoptosis.1.
  Tanshinone IIA can block a by inhibiting NF-κB upstream activators released by liver
  macrophages (KCs), inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathway, inhibiting proinflammatory
  factors and promoting the release of proinflammatory factors to block process a;2.
  Tanshinone IIA can mediate autophagy to activate Nrf2 through MEK/ERK/mTOR pathway
  to eliminate ROS and other oxygen free radicals to block process b;3. Tanshinone
  IIA blocks process c by regulating apoptotic proteins through PI3K-AKT-mTOR and
  p-AMPK pathways;4. Tanshinone IIA blocks process d by regulating cyclin p-Rb and
  p53 genes.
