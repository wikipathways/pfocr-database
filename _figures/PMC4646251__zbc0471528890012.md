caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways involved in GnRH-induced
  ERK activation (red arrows) and ErbB4 cleavage (blue arrows). Stimulation of the
  GnRH receptor in GT1–7 cells leads to the activation of ERK through transactivation
  of ErbB4 and EGFR (, ). When the GnRH receptor is stimulated by high concentrations
  of GnRH for a long time, ErbB4 is cleaved by TACE (). The experiments with YM-254890
  indicated that both ERK activation and ErbB4 cleavage are completely dependent on
  Gq/11 proteins. The contribution of each molecule to ERK activation (red letters)
  or ErbB4 cleavage (blue letters) is indicated as the approximate percentage suggested
  by the experiments with inhibitors or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). DMSO, dimethyl
  sulfoxide.
