caption: IL-6-STAT3 signaling is a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 mediated
  by cytokine storm. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via cell membrane-localized ACE2 depending
  on TMPRSS2 and CatB/L activities for viral S protein priming. The viral pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns trigger IL-6 production followed by activation of the NF-κB pathway
  via PRRs in both immune and non-immune cells, leading to an inflammatory response.
  On the other hand, upon the occupancy of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2, the increased serum
  level of free Ang II due to a reduction of ACE2-mediated degradation also promotes
  activation of the NF-κB pathway via AT1R, followed by IL-6 production. Simultaneously,
  Ang II-AT1R signaling activates ADAM17 and ADAM10 protease activity, and the resulting
  production of TNF-α, sIL-6Rα, and EGF initiates the TNFR-NF-κB, IL-6R-STAT3, and
  EGF-NF-κB signaling pathways. Consequently, the concomitant inflammatory cascades
  of NF-κB- and STAT3-mediated signaling further augment NF-κB activity and establish
  an inflammatory circuit, the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 AMP), which describes an IL-6-based
  positive feedback loop for inflammation in non-immune cells. Thus, the cytokine
  storm caused by the hyper-activation of NF-κB in IL-6 AMP may cause fatal symptoms
  such as ARDS, severe pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and coagulation in a subgroup
  of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In line with this, the blockade of IL-6-STAT3
  signaling should shed light on the treatment of severe COVID-19
