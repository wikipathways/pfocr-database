caption: A KSHV uninfected cell shows upregulated expression of HIF1α which restricts
  DNA replication in hypoxic conditions. In KSHV-infected cells, KSHV-encoded LANA
  and vGPCR promotes upregulated expression of HIF1α through inhibition of its proteosomal
  degradation or by working on MAPK/P38 pathway, respectively. KSHV-encoded vCyclin,
  which is also expressed in response to hypoxia, interacts and regulates HIF1α transcriptional
  activity, as well as degrades it through the lysosomal pathway to balance HIF1α-mediated
  restriction of DNA replication in hypoxia.
