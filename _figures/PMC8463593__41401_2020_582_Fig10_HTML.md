caption: A high level of serum BAFF was found in RA, while the BAFF level was associated
  with RF, CRP, DAS28, SJC, TJC, and bone lesions. BAFF activates alternative and
  canonical NF-κB pathways by binding to BAFF receptors, thereby promoting the proliferation,
  activation, and differentiation of B cells as well as B cell survival and maturation,
  which in turn results in the production of autoantibodies, immunoglobulins and cytokines
  and BAFF receptor further expression. Immune complexes are formed by autoantibodies
  and deposit joint synovium, which results in synovitis, pannus formation, bone erosion,
  and cartilage degradation.
papertitle: BAFF, involved in B cell activation through the NF-κB pathway, is related
  to disease activity and bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.
