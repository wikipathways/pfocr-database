caption: A model explaining the modulation of the Ire1-Xbp1 pathway in enterovirus-infected
  cells by the induction of Ire1 phosphorylation and inactivation through multiple
  mechanisms, including proteolytic cleavage. The activated Ire1-Xbp1 pathway in uninfected
  (left) or enterovirus-infected (right) cells is shown.
