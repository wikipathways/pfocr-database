caption: Glycine metabolism pathways. Metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis
  of glycine, and its use for different metabolic functions. a Glycolysis, involving
  the 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA) metabolite bifurcation. b Pathway of serine and glycine
  synthesis starting from 3PGA. (b1) Reaction of glycine synthesis from serine by
  glycine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.1). This is an enzyme-branching break
  with fixed stoichiometry, which converts serine into glycine with the transfer of
  a [C1] unit to tetrahydrofolate (THF) giving 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate (THF-[C1]).
  (b2) Set of reactions that use the [C1] unit from THF-[C1] regenerating free THF
  so that it can participate again in reaction b1. (b3) Irreversible reaction of the
  glycine cleavage system (EC 1.4.4.2), which makes a sink of glycine. c Processes
  involved in THF-[C1] metabolism to different products including methyl transfers
  by adenosyl methionine (Ado-Met). d Processes of protein biosynthesis involving
  glycine, especially the synthesis of collagen. e Set of pathways that use glycine
  as metabolite for other biosynthesis processes. See Meléndez-Hevia and de Paz-Lugo
