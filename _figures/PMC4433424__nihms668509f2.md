caption: Simplified pathway maps of glycolysis (a) and the TCA cycle (b) with mRNA
  changes shown. Un-boxed inputs are the gene names. Genes that are over-expressed
  (FC>2) in the TRACK TG+ kidneys are indicated by ↑, while genes that are under-expressed
  (FC<0.9) in the TRACK TG+ kidneys are indicated by ↓. Since the under-expressed
  genes are potentially under-estimated in the RNAseq results, the fold change threshold
  for under-expressed genes is set at <0.90. * Both isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)
  and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complexes contain more than 2 transcripts that
  are significantly decreased in TRACK TG+ kidneys. The fold change and q-value shown
  are the least significant ones in these two complexes.
