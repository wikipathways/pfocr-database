caption: Pathway analysis of the differential metabolites. (A) Pathway analysis of
  40 differential metabolites. The size and color of each circle was based on pathway
  impact value and p-value, respectively. (B) Metabolic pathways were visualized by
  means of cytoscape software. The differential metabolites in our study were represented
  by red hexagons. Hexagons with green lines mean that the alteration of the biomarkers
  in CKD had statistical significance. The size of hexagons indicated the FC of the
  corresponding metabolite in CKD in relative to controls. In addition, pink hexagons
  indicated metabolites participating in the metabolic pathway but not been detected
  in our study. Diamonds mean that the metabolites convert to the products by the
  reactions.
