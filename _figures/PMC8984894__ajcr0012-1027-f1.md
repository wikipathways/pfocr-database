caption: Schematic illustration of homotypic cell membrane-cloaked biomimetic nanocarrier
  for targeted delivery of PIPD and its anti-tumor mechanism against PC cells. Enhanced
  anti-cancer efficacy can be attributed to the synergistic effects of (1) targeted
  delivery of encapsulated PIPD molecules to tumor tissues by favorable serum stability,
  biocompatibility and immunocompatibility; (2) elevated tumor uptake of bionic nanosized
  DDS via homologous cell membrane recognition; (3) inhibition of KRAS signal transduction
  pathway by efficient PDEδ degradation through hijacking the UPS system by released
  PIPD molecules in target cells.
