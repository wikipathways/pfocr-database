caption: 'Actionable nodes of the autophagy pathway. The process of autophagy begins
  with generation of the initiation complex. Its substrates include factors critical
  for phagophore nucleation. This is also called the Vps34 complex and is involved
  in initiation of autophagy as well as endosome maturation. The lipid kinase activity
  of Vps34 generates PI3P on the target membrane, forming the omegasome upon which
  the autophagy nucleation complex forms. The ER is depicted as a membrane source
  for the omegasome, but other membranous compartments have also been described. The
  autophagy elongation machinery includes an E1-E2-E3-like process that ultimately
  results in lipidation of ATG8 family proteins, thereby identifying a mature autophagosome.
  Two conjugation systems are illustrated: the ATG8 conjugation system (red) transfers
  LC3/ATG8 to the E2-like protein ATG3. The ATG12 conjugation system (green) generates
  the E3-like complex by transferring ATG12 onto ATG5. Association of the ATG5-12
  fusion with ATG16L1 forms the ATG16L1 complex; this acts in an E3-like manner to
  transfer ATG8/LC3 onto phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), thereby completing the lipidation
  process. Cysteine proteases of the ATG4 family cleave ATG8/LC3 from the cytosolic
  face of the autolysosome for re-use. ATG4 family proteins are critical in the initial
  activation of ATG8/LC3 by exposing the C-terminal glycine for conjugation. As depicted,
  several members of core autophagy machinery have been assessed in genetic and pharmacological
  models for their role in cancer biology. Additional details of genetic models are
  provided in . A more extensive list of pharmacological inhibitors is provided in
  . Created with BioRender.com.'
