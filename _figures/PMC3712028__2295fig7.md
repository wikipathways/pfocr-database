caption: Model for the mechanism of regulation of glucose metabolism in muscle and
  liver by leptin in the VMH. Ob-Rb in the VMH plays a key role in the regulation
  of glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver by leptin. Leptin-activated
  MEK-ERK signaling in the VMH increases insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization
  in red muscle through activation of MCR in the VMH. Ob-Rb–expressing VMH neurons
  likely activate POMC neurons either in the ARC itself () or at their synaptic connections
  with VMH neurons through the MEK-ERK pathway. The MEK-ERK pathway then stimulates
  synaptic plasticity for POMC neurons and MCR-expressing neurons in the VMH. Whereas
  other brain sites may contribute to the leptin-induced enhancement of the suppressive
  effect of insulin on hepatic glucose production, leptin-activated STAT3 signaling
  in the VMH mediates this enhancement by inhibiting glycogen phosphorylase a activity
  in liver. 3V, third ventricle.
