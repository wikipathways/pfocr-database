caption: 'Current knowledge about the glycosylation roles in the cancer immunotherapy.
  A Schematic view of the glycosylation, cancer immunotherapies (mAb-based ICIs and
  CAR-T cell), and their targets. Cancer immunotherapies are developed to target the
  immune checkpoints (e.g., PD-1 and CTLA-4 on the T cell or their ligands (e.g.,
  PD-L1/PD-L2 and CD80/CD86) on the tumor cell), which are processed via the glycosylation
  machinery and decorated with glycans. The glycosylation machinery is regulated by
  miRNAs (red color). These glycans might impact on the efficacy of immune checkpoints
  therapies. B Current knowledge about glycosylation on the immune checkpoint pathway:
  tumor cell (MUC1, CD80, and PD-L1/L2), T cell (PD-1 and CATLA4), and immune checkpoint
  therapeutic (ICI). C 11 well-known glycan targets (tumor glycan epitopes) of cancer
  immunotherapeutic on the tumor cells'
