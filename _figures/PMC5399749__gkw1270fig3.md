caption: 'Top. The transcriptional regulatory network obtained from clusters with
  clear regulation and expression using the AIC objective function. The hexagonal
  nodes represent transcription factors and circular nodes regulated clusters (labeled
  1–76, only clear clusters shown): colors represent cell cycle phases (peak expression
  phase for clusters, and the main phase of the regulated clusters for each transcription
  factor). Bottom. The regulatory network of transcription factors and other regulators
  extracted from the above network. Transcription factors shown are those associated
  by our algorithm to the regulation of clear clusters; other cell cycle regulators
  were identified in our gene set and overlapped with cell-cycle pathway map in KEGG
  ().'
