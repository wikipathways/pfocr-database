caption: 'LH binds to the LH receptor, stimulating the mobilization of stimulatory
  guanine-nucleotide binding proteins (Gsα). The subsequent activation of adenylyl
  cyclase and generation of cAMP leads to the phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent protein
  kinase (pPKA). Substrates for pPKA include StAR protein and a cohort of steroid
  pathway enzymes and other molecules, which collectively mobilize intracellular cholesterol
  and guide the formation of progesterone from cholesterol and the synthesis of androstenedione
  and testosterone. Androstenedione and testosterone are secreted, and within granulosa
  cells, are aromatized into estrogens as described in the text and . The inhibitory
  (−) effects of genistein and DES are shown. DHEA: dehydroepiandrosterone; HDL: high-density
  lipoprotein; P5: pregnenolone.'
