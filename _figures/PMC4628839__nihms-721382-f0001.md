  GWAS studies can greatly benefit from imputation and replication studies for loci
  discovered in the discovery phase. For some studies replication studies are limited
  to those loci (genes) that are also part of pathways for genes identified as significantly
  associated with the disease in previous studies. This is also proposed for sequencing
  studies to identify less common variants in which power issues may be partially
  addressed by limiting replication analyses based on pathway information.
