caption: 'Changes in heterochromatin and de-repression of repetitive sequences pose
  danger for both genomic and epigenomic stability. SIRT6 deacetylates H3K9 and H3K56,
  TRF2, increases association of WRN with chromatin and interacts with SUV39H to promote
  telomere stability. SIRT6 deficiency results in telomere dysfunction, susceptibility
  of oxidative stress (OS) and may lead to the expression of the telomere proximal
  genes (TPG). At the centromeres SIRT6 deacetylates H3K18 to maintain silencing of
  centromeric satellite repeats and interacts and promotes proper chromosome segregation
  during mitosis, with the defect observed in the absence of SIRT6. SIRT6 is involved
  in silencing of retrotransposable elements: SIRT6 mono-ADP-ribosylates KAP1, associated
  with HP1α, to keep a closed conformation of chromatin at LINE1 elements, preventing
  retrotransposon expression. The lack of SIRT6 results in de-repression of LINE1
  elements, produces genomic instability and innate immune response through accumulation
  of LINE1 cDNA copies and activation of cGAS-STING-IFN type I pathway.'
