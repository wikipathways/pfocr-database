caption: Schematic of pathways associated with long-term potentiation in the pre-and
  post-synaptic membrane. Binding of Wnt5a to surface receptors on the pre-synaptic
  cell membrane (initiation of the Wnt signaling pathway) leads to mobilization of
  Ca2+ from intracellular stores (initiation of Ca2+ signaling pathway) and expression
  of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) on both pre-synaptic and postsynaptic
  membranes (initiation of the glutamatergic synapse pathway). Expression of NMDARs
  on the post-synaptic membrane facilitates the entry of Ca2+ which in turn activates
  calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs) (initiation of the MAPK signaling pathway). Together NMDARs and
  MAPK lead to phosphorylation and translocation of α-amino-3-hydrozy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic
  acid receptors (AMPARs) to the post synaptic membrane where they increase synaptic
  conductance leading to long- term potentiation.
