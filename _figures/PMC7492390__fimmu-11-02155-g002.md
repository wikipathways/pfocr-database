caption: (A) Immunological basis of TCMR. Activated dendritic cells migrate to lymphoid
  tissue presenting alloantigen on MHC class I and II molecules. Interaction with
  na誰ve alloreactive T-cells in the presence of appropriate co-stimulatory molecules
  and a pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu results in proliferation of alloreactive
  CD4 + and CD8 + effector T-cells and subsequent B-cell proliferation. Migration
  to the liver is orchestrated by chemokines such as CXCL9 and CXCL10 interacting
  with the CXCR3 receptor on lymphocytes in addition to complex interactions with
  the unique immunomodulatory liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Lymphocyte subsets
  such as Th17 cells have specific recruitment mechanisms, providing potential therapeutic
  targets. Cells of the innate immune system including macrophages, neutrophils and
  eosinophils are recruited to the liver and along with the effector T-cells mediate
  tissue damage, resulting in the clinical manifestations of TCMR. (B) Three pathways
  for antigen presentation. The strongest alloimmune response is generated by the
  direct pathway which occurs in the early post-transplant period. Upon activation,
  donor-derived dendritic cells migrate to the lymph node, displaying non-self donor
  antigens within non-self donor MHC molecules. This provides potent stimulation for
  the mounting of a rejection response. The indirect and semi-direct pathways involve
  recipient-derived dendritic cells displaying self and non-self MHC molecules respectively.
  Whilst not as potent as the direct pathway, they are still able to sustain ongoing
  rejection. (C) Antigen presentation within the liver generally promotes tolerogenic
  responses. Antigen is also presented within the allograft by endothelial cells,
  macrophages, hepatic stellate cells, hepatocytes and biliary epithelium, with increased
  presentation seen during episodes of inflammation. However, most interactions with
  na誰ve lymphocytes within the liver result in tolerance rather than rejection, with
  apoptosis of effector cells and a skewing of T-cell differentiation toward the regulatory
  T-cell phenotype through an immunosuppressive cytokine profile.
