caption: Genes and signaling pathways involved in ureteric budding. Scheme of signaling
  pathways between the ureteric buds (green) and the metanephric mesenchyme (yellow-orange).
  The most important inducer of UB outgrowth is the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase signaling
  pathway mediated by Gdnf and its receptor Ret. Ret is expressed by the nephric duct
  (green) and ureteric buds (green). Gdnf is secreted by the metanephric mesenchyme
  (yellow). The coordination of different signaling pathways in the anterior mesenchyme
  and the metanephric mesenchyme play a crucial role in the development of a single
  ureteric bud.
