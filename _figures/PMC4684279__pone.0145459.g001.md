caption: All enzymes catalyzing the reactions with pyruvate (as substrate or product)
  are depicted and the pathway shown with dotted arrow is from A. nidulans. ALT- alanine
  transaminase, LDH- lactate dehydrogenase [], MAE- malic enzyme [], PDC- pyruvate
  decarboxylase, PDH- pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, PKI- pyruvate kinase [] and
  PYC- pyruvate carboxylase []. Respective K m values for the enzymes are given in
  brackets. These are either taken from Aspergillus literature or for the corresponding
  yeast enzymes from BRENDA (www.brenda-enzymes.org).
