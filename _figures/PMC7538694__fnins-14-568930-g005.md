caption: Notch signaling pathway in zebrafish and mouse. Upon interaction between
  the Notch receptor and its ligands Jagged/Delta, and through several subsequent
  cleavage steps the NICD is released and translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus,
  the NICD, together with Rbpj, activates the expression of the downstream genes Hes
  (mouse) and her (zebrafish). The Hes/Her proteins bind as homodimers to the promoter
  of proneural genes to inhibit neuronal fate. Additionally, the dimer can bind to
  its own promoter, resulting in a negative auto-regulation. bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix;
  Her, human epidermal growth factor receptor; Hes, Hairy/enhancer of split; NEXT,
  Notch extracellular truncation; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; Rbpj, Recombining
  binding protein suppressor of hairless.
