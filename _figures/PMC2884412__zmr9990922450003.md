caption: Comparison of lipoylation strategies. (A and B) In the synthesis pathway,
  the acyl chain of octanoyl-ACP is transferred by the lipoate (octanoyl) transferase
  LipB to a conserved lysine residue on the E2 subunit of the α-ketoacid dehydrogenase
  complexes or the H protein of the GCV. The octanoylated subunit is a substrate for
  the lipoate synthase, LipA, which catalyzes sulfur insertion. Alternatively, octanoyl-E2
  and octanoyl-H protein can be generated by the ATP-dependent ligation of free octanoate
  by LplA. (C) The primary role of LplA, however, is in lipoate scavenging, where
  it catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of free lipoate to proteins. (D) The mammalian
  scavenging pathway appears to use a unique approach in which free lipoate is conjugated
  to GMP in a reaction catalyzed by the lipoate-activating enzyme (LAE). The LplA
  homolog lipoyl-NMP transferase cannot use free lipoate as substrate and instead
  ligates GMP-activated lipoate to proteins.
