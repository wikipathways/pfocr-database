caption: Each rectangle represents a possible value, and arrows represent possible
  value changes (according to conditions on values of other components). The “main”
  component follows the progress of the cell toward fate assumption. The cell starts
  as undifferentiated (af); according to the activities in the EGFR and LIN-12 / Notch
  pathways, it decides whether to adopt a vulval (1or2) or a nonvulval (2or3) cell
  fate. Finally, the cell assumes one of the three cell fates. The smaller rectangles
  correspond to time delays until these decisions are made. Other components represent
  the activity level of the biological components they are associated with (lin-12,
  EGFR pathway, lst genes, LS, lin-15). Our tool also enables visualization of executions
  of this model by highlighting the current value of each component. Changes in highlighted
  values allow us to follow the execution visually.
