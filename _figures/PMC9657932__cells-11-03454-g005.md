caption: 'The Warburg effect in RAS-expressing cancer cells. RAS-expressing cells
  are exposed in the tumor microenvironment to hypoxia, acidosis, and stromal cell
  formation that significantly affect the glycolysis as well as important signaling
  such as PI3K and HIF1 (not displayed). All these lead to an additional impairment
  in the efficiency of the TCA cycle, where the OXPHOS is decreased. The major alteration
  comes from the choice of cancer cells to preferentially metabolize anaerobically
  glucose, even under normoxia, which is referred to as the Warburg effect. RAS-expressing
  cells show high glucose uptake by GLUT1, a major increase of the glycolysis and
  the massive production of lactate catalyzed by LDHA, from which only a very small
  amount enters the mitochondria. The majority of lactate is transported outside of
  the cell, further promoting low pH and tumor growth. In parallel with the decreased
  overall flux of pyruvate through the TCA cycle, there is an increase of the utilization
  of glutamine, in particular its carbon backbone and amino moiety either by entering
  the TCA cycle as -ketoglutarate or transamination to sustain biosynthetic metabolic
  pathways such as amino acid, nucleotide, and glutathione synthesis. Glutamine is
  transported to the cell through the SCL1A5 transporter, entering the mitochondria
  where GLS1 hydrolysis converts it to glutamate and ammonia. Glutamate is then converted
  by oxidative deamination to -ketoglutarate and ammonia catalyzed by GDH1 and enters
  the TCA cycle. Abbreviations: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; HIF1, hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid/Krebbs cycle; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  GLUT1, glucose transporter-1; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; NonOxPPP, non-oxidative
  penthose phosphate pathway; HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; SBP, serine biosynthetic
  pathway; SCL1A5, alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2; GLS1, K-type mitochondrial
  glutaminase (phosphate-activated amidohydrolase); GDH1, mitochondrial glutamate
  dehydrogenase.'
