caption: A summary of EMT function and D3T−downregulated AKR1B1 signaling pathway.
  (A) Diagram depicting the signal transduction pathways in DM (+) and DM (−) cataract
  patients. (B), In DM (−) cataract patients, p-AMPKT172 normal function is to regulate
  SOD2 activity to remove unwanted ROS. However, in DM (+) cataract patients, AKR1B1
  inhibits the expression of p-AMPKT172 and promotes SOD2 acetylation to form AcSOD2
  which leads to failure of ROS removal. The accumulated ROS induces oxidative stress,
  which in turn induces EMT progression, leading to the downregulation of epithelial
  marker and upregulation of mesenchymal markers (red line). In addition, N-cadherin
  and MMP9 expressions are significantly higher in DM (+) cataract patients. (C) WKY
  rats fed 10% fructose in drinking water for 8 weeks; or WKY rats fed 10% fructose
  in drinking water and administered D3T (10 mg/kg/day) via gavage for 8 weeks. (D)
  Fructose requires AKR1B1 to increase ROS generation (black line), and ROS accumulation
  further inhibits the expression of p-AMPKT172 and promotes SOD2 acetylation to form
  AcSOD2. In consequence, accumulated ROS stress induces EMT progression (red line).
  In contrary, D3T is capable of inhibiting the effect of fructose-activated AKR1B1
  signaling cascade.
