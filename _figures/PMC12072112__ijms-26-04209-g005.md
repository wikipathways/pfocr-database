caption: 'Mechanisms of insulin resistance, neuroinflammation, and tau pathology in
  Alzheimer’s disease. The interaction between insulin resistance, Aβ accumulation,
  neuroinflammation, and tau hyperphosphorylation plays a central role in AD. Astrocytes
  and microglia drive neuroinflammation by releasing proinflammatory cytokines such
  as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, along with ROS and iNOS. The activation of microglial
  RAGE by Aβ AGEs triggers signaling cascades involving TLR4, JNK3, and NF-κB, amplifying
  inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. Insulin signaling is severely impaired
  in AD, leading to brain insulin resistance. IDE, which plays a key role in the clearance
  of insulin and Aβ, becomes dysfunctional, contributing to Aβ accumulation and amyloid
  plaque formation. The disruption of IR signaling results in diminished phosphorylation
  of key downstream effectors, including PI3K, PDK1, and Akt, exacerbating oxidative
  stress, memory impairment, and autophagy dysfunction. TNF-α signaling through its
  receptor TNFR1 activates JNK3, IKK, and PKR, further inhibiting Akt and enhancing
  GSK-3β activity—a critical driver of tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary
  tangle formation. Additionally, dysregulation of mTOR, NF-κB, and FoxO pathways
  worsens oxidative stress, disrupts protein synthesis, and impairs autophagy, all
  contributing to progressive neurodegeneration in AD. Solid Arrows: indicates activation
  or conversion step in the signaling pathway. Dotted lines: indicates inhibitory
  effect. AD: Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ: amyloid beta; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor
