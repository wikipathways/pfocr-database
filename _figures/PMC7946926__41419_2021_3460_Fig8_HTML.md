caption: A Mechanism flow diagram. Under physiological conditions (non diabetic),
  most miR-483 (miR-483-5p) remained in the renal tubular epithelial cells, and only
  a small amount of miR-483 was encapsulated into MVB (multivesicular body, vesicles)
  and was secreted into the extracellular through exosomes. Therefore, the intracellular
  miR-483 blocked ECM synthesis by restraining the TIMP2/MAPK1 pathway; Under pathological
  conditions, most miR-483 was encapsulated into MVB and was secreted into the extracellular
  domain through exosomes and transferred into the urine. Therefore, miR-483 was highly
  expressed in the urinary exosomes, and the lack of miR-483 in renal tubular epithelial
  cells led to the activation of the TIMP2/MAPK1 pathway, thus promoting ECM synthesis.

  and urinary exosome miR-483-5p. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis of three
  independent experiments.
