caption: Regulatory model of methylcitrate pathway by RegX3 in Mycobacteria. Phosphate-responsive
  RegX3 and propionate-responsive PrpR competitively regulate the transcription of
  prpDBC operon involved in methylcitrate pathway (MCS, MCD, and MCL), which play
  an important role in metabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids as the main nutrient
  sources of mycobacteria during infection. It was suggested that RegX3 contributed
  to establish a direct association between phosphate and carbon metabolisms, and
  also modulate the C-P balance in mycobacteria. The wave lines indicate transmembrane
  transport. The fold line with arrow indicates signal stimulus. The red lines with
  arrows indicate positive transcriptional regulation while the light blue lines with
  arrows indicate compound synthesis process.
