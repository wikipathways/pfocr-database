caption: Canonical pathway illustrations of CBA classifier. [A] An excerpt around
  the NRF2 molecule from the illustration of the Xenobiotic Metabolism Signaling pathway,
  exported from IPA. [B] Overlapping among the canonical pathways detected as significant,
  which were divided into three clusters, exported from IPA. Each node corresponds
  to each canonical pathway detected as significant. Each link corresponds to the
  number of molecules shared between two pathways. Color depth of nodes corresponds
  to the 竏値og p value (the deeper depth is, the larger the 竏値og p values is). Line
  width of links corresponds to the number of molecules shared between two pathways
  (no line means no shared molecules between two pathways). (For interpretation of
  the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
  version of this article.)
