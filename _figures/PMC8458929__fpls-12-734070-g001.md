caption: The phenylpropanoid pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. Metabolic pathway showing
  the biosynthesis of different classes of phenylpropanoids and phenylpropanoid-derived
  compounds. For flavonoids and DCGs a molecular structure is shown representative
  for their respective class of compounds. Metabolites and metabolite classes shown
  in red are discussed in this work for their (putative) role in the phenotypes of
  lignin mutants. Blue arrows indicate enzymatic steps upon which perturbation leads
  to the accumulation of bioactive molecules that have been proposed to be implicated
  in dwarfing of lignin mutants; solid arrows represent enzymatic steps validated
  by experimental evidence; dashed arrows represent suggested enzymatic steps/pathways;
  two or more successive smaller solid arrows represent multiple enzymatic steps.
