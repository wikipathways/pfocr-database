caption: Schematic drawing to illustrate the inhibitory effect of GPs on NF-κB and
  TNF-α signal pathway and inhibitory of apoptosis of endothelial and epithelial cells.
  GPs could inhibit the phosphorylation of NF-κB, strain the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB, thus inhibiting the release of cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and
  VCAM1. GPs also help to inhibit the apoptosis of endothelial and epithelial cells
  induced by LPS challenge, which may play a significant role in the repairment of
  ALI.
