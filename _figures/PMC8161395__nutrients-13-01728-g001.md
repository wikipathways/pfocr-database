caption: Illustration of potential anti-depressive mechanisms of probiotics, fundamentally
  involving gut microbiota modulation. The restoration of gut dysbiosis, inflammation
  and gut barrier dysfunction downregulates inflammation involving the TRP/KYN pathway
  which is implicated in depression and breaks the vicious cycles involving inflammation,
  the HPA-axis and persistent stimulus in the form of chronic stress. Probiotics promote
  synthesis of neurotransmitters either directly or indirectly by increasing BDNF
  levels and/or decreasing MAO levels to mediate anti-depressive effects. Probiotics
  attenuate exaggerated HPA-axis implicated in depression through downregulation of
  cortisol, proinflammatory cytokines and restoration of neurotransmitter circuits
  involving GABA and DA neurotransmitters. The epigenetic mechanism mainly involves
  butyrate-producing probiotics which inhibit HDAC and promote histone acetylation
  while upregulating BDNF expression. Tryptophan (TRP); Kynurenine (KYN); Indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase (IDO); Serotonin (5-HT); Dopamine (DA); Noradrenaline (NE); Gamma-Aminobutyric
  acid (GABA); Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); monoamine oxidase (MAO);
  Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA); Histone deacetylase (HDAC);
  Interleukin-6 (IL-6); Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).
