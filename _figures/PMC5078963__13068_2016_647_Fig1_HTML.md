caption: Biosynthetic pathway of fatty alcohol in Yarrowia lipolytica and Lipomyces
  starkeyi. The yellow-shaded pathway from fatty acyl-CoA to fatty alcohol indicates
  the engineered steps for the fatty alcohol synthesis described in this work. ACC
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACL ATP citrate lyase; G3P glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DGA
  diacylglycerolacyltransferase; DHAP dihydroxyacetone phosphate; F-6-P fructose 6-phosphate;
