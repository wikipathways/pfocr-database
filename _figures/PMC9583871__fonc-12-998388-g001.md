caption: Mechanism of immune activation by inhibition of DNA damage repair proteins.
  PARP, ATR, CHK1/2, WEE1, ATM, and DNA-PK play roles in DNA repair pathways including
  base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), homologous recombination
  (HR), and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis,
  senescence, and/or DNA repair. Inhibition of DNA damage repair proteins (red inhibitor
  lines) results in cell cycle progression, unrepaired DNA damage, and accumulation
  of cytosolic micronuclei that contain fragments of DNA (). This results in activation
  of the STAT1 (, ), cGAS/STING (), and TRAIL pathways as well as direct activation
  of immune cells (, ) to induce an anti-tumor immune response. The STAT1 pathway
  induces IFN-γ, which can increase levels of death receptor ligands including TRAIL
  (), FasL (), and TNF (). The cGAS/STING pathway induces an IFN-I response, which
  also contributes to increased levels of death receptor ligands (–) as well as contributes
  directly to anti-tumor immunity (). Created in BioRender.com.
