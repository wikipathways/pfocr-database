caption: mTOR signals through two functionally distinct macromolecular complexes,
  mTORC1 (raptor complex) and mTORC2 (rictor complex), which are rapamycin-dependent
  and rapamycin-independent, respectively. The activity of the mTORC1 complex is negatively
  regulated by the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex and by PRAS40. TSC1/TSC2 inactivates
  Rheb, an enzyme critical to activation of mTORC1. Another protein that inactivates
  mTORC1 is FKBP38, which interacts with both Rheb and mTOR and interferes with Rheb's
  ability to interact with and activate mTORC1. FKBP38 is structurally similar to
  FKBP12, the protein that mediates the binding of rapamycin to mTORC1. Both TSC2
  and PRAS40 are substrates of Akt kinase which are inactivated upon phosphorylation
  by Akt. Through this mechanism, the activation of PI3K and Akt (through growth factor
  signaling) or by loss of PTEN, leads to activation of mTORC1, which promotes cell
  growth. Rapamycin and rapamycin analogues through association with FKBP12 disrupt
  the mTORC1 complex, leading to growth suppression. However, disruption of may promote
  the assembly of mTORC2 following the interaction of mTOR with rictor and mSin1,
  thus counteracting the anti-tumor activity of current mTOR inhibitors. Moreover,
  disruption of mTORC1 by rapamycin may relieve negative feedback suppression on mitogen
  activation of Akt, leading to elevation of cell survival signals. The ratio of raptor
  to rictor and the relative levels of PRAS40, TSC2, mSIN1, FKBP38 and IRS-I in tumor
  cells may be useful cancer prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.

  description: mTOR signals through two functionally distinct macromolecular complexes,
    mTORC1 (raptor complex) and mTORC2 (rictor complex), which are rapamycin-dependent
    and rapamycin-independent, respectively. The activity of the mTORC1 complex is
    negatively regulated by the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex and by PRAS40.
    TSC1/TSC2 inactivates Rheb, an enzyme critical to activation of mTORC1. Another
    protein that inactivates mTORC1 is FKBP38, which interacts with both Rheb and
    mTOR and interferes with Rheb's ability to interact with and activate mTORC1.
    FKBP38 is structurally similar to FKBP12, the protein that mediates the binding
    of rapamycin to mTORC1. Both TSC2 and PRAS40 are substrates of Akt kinase which
    are inactivated upon phosphorylation by Akt. Through this mechanism, the activation
