caption: Signaling cascades of RA-mediated repression of B3GALT5-LTR promoter activity
  that reduce SSEA3 synthesis in human ES cells. RA induces two pathways that repress
  B3GALT5-LTR promoter activity, and thereby downregulates SSEA3 synthesis. One pathway
  involves RA-mediated SIRT1 repression and results in STAT3 signal enhancement, which
  causes the activated STAT3 to bind and repress the activity of the B3GALT5-LTR promoter,
  thereby reducing SSEA3 synthesis. The second pathway is RA-mediated enhancement
  of lamin A level, which changes the NFYAs/NFYAl ratio, thereby repressing B3GALT5-LTR
  promoter activity and reducing SSEA3 synthesis. Several changes in splicing factor
  levels (see Discussion) involve a lamin A-dependent or -independent pathway. The
  drugs used in this study are also shown in this schematic.
