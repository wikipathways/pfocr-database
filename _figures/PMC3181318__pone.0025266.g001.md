caption: 'In contrast to the classical black box approach (black line), this scheme
  assumes two major pathways in this response, both of which mediated by shifts in
  different aspects of community structure: In the Adjustment pathway (full lines
  in blue), changes in resources trigger shifts in the level of activity and other
  cellular properties of the existing dominant phylotypes. In this scenario, change
  in community composition involves shifts in the relative abundance of the existing
  taxa, but not their identity (i.e. rearrangement, dashed blue line). In the Replacement
  scenario (red lines), resource gradients trigger shifts in the composition of the
  community, in terms of the identity of the dominant phylotypes, which have intrinsically
  different single-cell characteristics. In both scenarios, the final metabolic response
  is mediated by shifts in the physiological structure, that is, the distribution
  of activity and physiological states within the community. In either scenario, the
  response may or not include changes in biomass or cell abundance. The Adjustment
  scenario is associated to either modest environmental changes, or to communities
  that are more collectively more plastic. The Replacement scenario is associated
  to either steep environmental gradients, or to communities that are collectively
  less plastic. In this context of this scheme, functional plasticity refers to the
  breadth of capacities to perform specific processes, for example, the forms of N
  or the specific organic substrates that can be used at the community level. Metabolic
  plasticity, on the other hand, refers to the breadth of metabolic activity, in terms
  of rates of major processes such as respiration and growth, for example, associated
  to any given bacterial community composition, under varying environmental conditions.
  We quantitatively tested variations of these two basic scenarios using path analysis
  (see ).'
