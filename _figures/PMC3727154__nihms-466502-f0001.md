caption: Different signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family
  members can be activated by interferons (IFNs). STAT1 homodimers can be formed in
  response to both type I IFNs and type II IFN (IFNγ). These homodimers bind to IFNγ-activated
  site (GAS) enhancer elements in the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes, and this
  results in the induction of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic
  factors. Type I and type II IFNs can also activate STAT3 homodimers, and this can
  result in the production of both pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory
  cytokines (such as interleukin-10 (IL-10)), although the underlying mechanisms are
  not known. STAT1–STAT2 heterodimers, which are activated by type I IFNs, bind to
  IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) in the cytosol to form the IFN-stimulated gene factor
  3 (ISGF3) complex, which in turn migrates to the nucleus to bind to IFN-stimulated
  response elements (ISREs) and activate antiviral and antibacterial genes. In addition,
  type I IFNs stimulate IL-10 production either through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K)–AKT pathway or through STAT3 homodimers. Finally, in a STAT-independent manner,
  type I IFNs activate both p38, which is an upstream activator of several genes regulated
  by ISREs and GAS elements, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates
  mRNA translation. CREB, cAMP-responsive-element-binding protein; IFNAR, IFNα/β receptor;
  IFNGR, IFNγ receptor; JAK, Janus kinase; SBE, STAT3-binding element; TBX21, T box
  21; TYK2, non-receptor tyrosine kinase 2.
