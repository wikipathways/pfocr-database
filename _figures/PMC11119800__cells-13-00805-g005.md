caption: The biological function of OGT in HCC. (1) AGER enhances the O-GlcNAcylation
  modification of the proto-oncoprotein c-Jun, promoting HCC occurrence. However,
  the activation of ferroptosis forms a negative feedback pathway to inhibit the O-GlcNAcylation
  of c-Jun. The O-GlcNAcylation modification of YAP, eIF4E, and PGC1α promotes HCC
  progression. (2) The O-GlcNAcylation of ACSL4 activates the mTOR pathway to promote
  HCC proliferation. With the involvement of UAP1, O-GlcNAcylation modification occurs
  in β-catenin to promote HCC proliferation but increases the expression of the oncogene
  miR-483-3p and inhibits TP53-dependent cell apoptosis. SIX1 and F6P under the Warburg
  effect regulate the HBP pathway and increase the expression of related oncogenes,
  promoting HCC proliferation. After O-GlcNAcylation modification, the CDK inhibitors
  p21 and p27 lose the inhibitory activity on CDKs, promoting HCC proliferation. HG
  affects OGT activity and O-GlcNAcylation. OGT promotes ER stress induced by FARS
  and activates the JNK-related signaling pathway to promote HCC proliferation. RIPK3
  inhibits the cleavage of caspase-8, JNK activation, and HCC proliferation, while
  RIPK3 is modified by O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAc modification affects the expression
  of Sp1, SREBP1, and other genes to promote HCC proliferation, which is related to
  the accumulation of LD. (3) The downregulation of E-cadherin is a hallmark of cancer
  metastasis. O-GlcNAcylation of FOXA2 can reduce the transcription of E-cadherin
  and promote HCC metastasis after the same result of KAT5 and O-GlcNAcylation modification.
  miR-24-1 restricts OGT, but CAV1 can reduce the expression of RUNX2, lead to decreased
  miR24 transcription, relieve OGT restriction, and promote HCC metastasis
