caption: 'A, diagram of the touch sensory pathways to the opposite side from the head
  and trunk skin, and the hindbrain and spinal neurons controlling swimming. Tt, trigeminal
  touch sensory; RB, Rohon‐Beard touch sensory; DLC, dorsolateral commissural sensory
  pathway; hexN, hindbrain extension neurons; hdIN, hindbrain descending interneurons;
  cIN, reciprocal inhibitory commissural interneurons; aIN, recurrent inhibitory ascending
  interneurons; mn, motoneurons. Red triangles are glutamatergic excitatory synapses.
  Blue circles are glycinergic inhibitory synapses. Synapses onto a box connect to
  all neurons in the box. B, recording from a right hdIN where activity in the whole
  swimming network (seen in left ventral root (VR): green trace) could be initiated
  by positive current and terminated by negative current into this single neuron.
  The right hindbrain was transected just caudal to the otic capsules (see Fig.  C).'
