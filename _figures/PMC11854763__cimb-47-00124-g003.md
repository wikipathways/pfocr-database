caption: A signaling pathway depicting the potential for TG2 to serve as a sTREM2
  receptor and inhibit the RhoA/ROCK/GSK3β pathway. A potential adaptor molecule is
  shown, as TG2 lacks a transmembrane domain. However, what this adaptor protein is,
  and if there truly is an adaptor protein altogether, is still under investigation
