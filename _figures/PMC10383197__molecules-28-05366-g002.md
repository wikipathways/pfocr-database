caption: Sphingomyelin-related metabolic pathways. The relevant chemical structures
  are shown (above left). Ceramide (Cer) de novo synthesis starts from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), and once synthesized, can be transferred to the trans-Golgi via
  the ceramide transfer protein (CERT), or be reorganized via a salvage pathway (red
  arrow). The action of sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1) on Cer leads to the production
  of sphingomyelin (SM) (orange arrow). In response to the stimulus of apoptosis,
  phospholipid disorganization moves the isolated SM from the outer leaflet to the
  cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane so that sphingomyelinase (SMase) can act
  on them to produce apoptotic Cer, with the opposite process occurring via sphingomyelin
  synthase (SMS) (black arrow). Second, Cer can be produced via the SMase (blue arrow).
  SM can also be produced by converting Cer via sphingomyelin synthase-associated
  protein (SMSr) (green arrow). Sphingosine (Sph) is produced by the hydrolysis of
  Cer by ceramidase (CDase), which is then phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase (SphK)
  to produce sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (pink arrow). The presence of S1P lyase
  (SPL) also allows S1P to produce ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal (brown arrow).
