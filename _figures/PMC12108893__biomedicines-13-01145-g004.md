caption: In malignant cells, the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol both
  use acetyl-CoA as the starting substrate. Acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by the enzyme
  ACC1 to form malonyl-CoA, which then undergoes a multi-step condensation reaction
  catalyzed by fatty acid synthase (FASN), resulting in the production of a 16-carbon
  saturated fatty acid. Subsequently, under the action of stearoyl-CoA desaturase
  (SCD1), the saturated fatty acid undergoes desaturation to be converted into a monounsaturated
  fatty acid. The biosynthesis of cholesterol relies on the mevalonate pathway, where
  acetyl-CoA undergoes a series of transformation steps to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  (HMG-CoA), which is then reduced to mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), ultimately
  synthesizing cholesterol through a series of complex biochemical reactions. Furthermore,
  during the proliferation and development of tumor cells, the expression of fatty
  acid transport proteins such as CD36 and fatty acid-binding proteins (FABP) is upregulated,
  enhancing the activity of FASN, thereby accelerating the uptake of fatty acids and
  cholesterol. In summary, tumor cells regulate lipid metabolism through various mechanisms
  to meet their high demand for lipids and ensure an adequate supply of lipids required
  for their rapid proliferation. Therefore, disrupting these regulatory mechanisms
  may provide new strategies and potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment
