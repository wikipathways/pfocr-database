caption: a | Trauma-related and sepsis-related tissue damage are examples of complement
  involvement during severe inflammatory response syndrome. Microbial intruders (sepsis)
  or cell injury (trauma) lead to massive complement activation and stimulation of
  immune cells (for example, via the C5a anaphylatoxin). The resulting effector molecules,
  such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and NOS, respectively), cytokines
  or the membrane attack complex (MAC), cause additional tissue damage and fuel a
  vicious hyperinflammatory cycle that may lead to multiple organ failure. Whereas
  prevention of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated complement initiation
  by C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) is currently evaluated in trauma, sepsis trials
  largely focus on blocking the C5a–C5aR1 signalling axis. b | Complement is a major
  contributor to transplant-related complications. Ischaemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury
  during transplantation (but also in stroke or myocardial infarction) triggers the
  exposure of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) and/or neoantigens (Neo-Ag)
  that, upon reperfusion, are sensed by the PRR complexes of the lectin pathway and
  natural antibodies (NAb) via the classical pathway invoking a complement response.
  Similarly, mismatch with human leukocyte antigen (HL A) or ABO antigens after transplantation
  leads to pronounced classical pathway activation and may drive antibody-mediated
  rejection (AMR). In addition, these processes may contribute to immune cell activation
  and, consequently, to cell-mediated rejection. Therapeutic intervention at the initiation
  stage (using C1-INH), the amplification loop (using C3 inhibitors of the compstatin
  family) or at terminal effector pathways (using anti-C5 mAbs) are currently being
  evaluated.
