caption: Peroxisomal reactions involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis. The initial
  plastid-localized reactions that transform linolenic acid to 12-oxo-phytodienoic
  acid (OPDA) are not shown. Transport of OPDA into peroxisomes involves the PXA1
  ATP-binding cassette transporter (also known as CTS1 and PED3), but may also occur
  by a passive route (dotted arrow). OPDA reductase (OPR3) converts OPDA to 3-oxo-2(2′[Z]-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic
  acid (OPC-8:0). Following activation of OPC-8:0 to its CoA derivative by OPCL1,
  three cycles of β-oxidation shorten the carboxyl side chain to yield JA. The three
  core enzymes in the β-oxidation cascade are acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX), multifunctional
  protein (MFP), and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT). A thioesterase is presumably required
  to release JA from JA-CoA. Mutations that disrupt various steps in the pathway are
  indicated by lowercase italicized letters.
