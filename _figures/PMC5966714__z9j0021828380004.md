caption: Nutrients as donors of epigenetic marks. Components of the one carbon metabolism
  pathway and TCA cycle that directly contribute the epigenetic marks for DNA and
  histone modifications. C, cytosine; G, guanine; CH3, methyl group; CH2OH, hydroxylmethyl
  group; Ac, acetyl group; Su, succinyl group; Ma, malonyl group; Glu, glutaryl group;
  TETs, ten-eleven-translocation enzymes; DNMTs, DNA methyltransferase enzymes; HMTs,
  histone methyltransferase enzymes; HATs, histone acetyltransferase enzymes; K, lysine;
  R, arginine; 5-MTHF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine.
