caption: Through p 1, HIFα is degraded directly by k 2. In p 7, HIFα first binds with
  PHD after synthesis. HIFα:PHD is then dissociated into PHD and HIFαOH with the participation
  of oxygen. HIFαOH then binds with VHL to form HIFαOH:VHL. Finally, the dissociation
  of HIFαOH:VHL concludes HIFα degradation. The pathway p 9 differs from p 7 only
  in that HIFα first binds with ARNT after synthesization.
