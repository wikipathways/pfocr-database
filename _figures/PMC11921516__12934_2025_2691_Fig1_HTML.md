caption: 'Metabolic engineering for diterpene production in engineered C. glutamicum.
  The metabolic pathway for diterpene production in engineered C. glutamicum was divided
  into four distinct modules: OverMEP, GGPPS, DiTPS, and P450R. The parental strain,
  C. glutamicum HL01, was transformed with a series of plasmids, each encoding genes
  corresponding to these specific metabolic modules. The native pyc and crtB genes
  (shown in red) were inactivated in the strain HL01. See the Table 1 for the strains
  and plasmids used in this study. Abbreviations: Metabolite: G3P, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; Pyr, Pyruvate; DXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; IPP, isopentenyl
  diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GGPP,
