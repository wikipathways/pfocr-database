caption: The intrinsic pathway is deregulated in cancer. A wide range of stresses
  activate the intrinsic pathway in mammalian cells, which is regulated by the Bcl-2
  family. The death signals initiated by various stresses are first transmitted through
  the BH3-only proteins that are activated through transcriptional or posttranslational
  modifications as shown by several examples. Inhibition of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
  family members by BH3-only proteins leads to activation of Bax/Bak, subsequent mitochondrial
  dysfunction, and cytosolic release of apoptogenic proteins such as cytochrome c
  (Cyto c) and SMAC/Diablo. Following disruption of mitochondrial integrity, a caspase
  activation cascade is triggered to execute cell death irreversibly. tBid links the
  extrinsic pathway to the intrinsic pathway and mitochondria. Common genetic or epigenetic
  alterations (*) in both anti-apoptotic proteins (rectangle) and pro-apoptotic proteins
  (ellipse) are found in cancer.
