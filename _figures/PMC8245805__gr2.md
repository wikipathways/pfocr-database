caption: The mechanism of DNA damage repair for ALDH2 deficiency induced DNA damage.
  The ALDH2 deficiency can lead to acetaldehyde-induced DNA interstrand crosslinks,
  DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and tandem mutation, which requires the Fanconi
  anemia pathway (FA), homologous recombination pathway (HR), Y-family DNA polymerase
  mediated pathway, classical non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ), alternative
  non-homologous end-joining repair pathway (Alt-NHEJ), and NER pathway for DNA damage
  repair. The DNA interstrand crosslinks repair mechanisms involve FA and REV1 pathway.
  The difference between FA and REV1 pathways is that FA pathway needs to incise for
  unhooking the crosslink, which leads to DNA strand breaks or abasic sites. However,
  REV1 repair pathway can operate without excision and promote genome stability. The
  DSBs repair pathways of acetaldehyde-induced include HR, NHEJ, and Alt-NHEJ. When
  presents BRCA1/2 mutation or FA pathway inactivation, NHEJ, and Alt-NHEJ pathway
  are required to repair DSBs and this leads to mutagenesis. NER pathway mediates
  acetaldehyde-induced tandem mutation repair.
