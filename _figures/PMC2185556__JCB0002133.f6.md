caption: Model showing interactions of surface AChR with associated proteins and a
  suggested mechanism for the Rac/Cdc42-mediated clustering of these proteins in response
  to agrin. This scheme is similar to that proposed by Fuhrer et al., 1999. The novel
  feature is the role of Rac and Cdc42 in inducing the clustering by producing localized
  remodeling of actin-based cytoskeleton upon the activation of these monomeric G
  proteins by agrin signaling. Shown here is one possible mechanism for Rac/Cdc42-mediated
  cytoskeletal changes that involves the PAK, LIM kinase cofilin downstream effector
  pathway (; ; ).
