caption: Expression features of cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway genes.
  Red boxes represent tomato genes that were identified as differentially expressed
  in SI compared with pollinated and unpollinated styles. Light green boxes represent
  genes that have been previously identified in tomatoes. White boxes represent genes
  that belong to the KEGG pathway, but have not been identified in tomatoes until
  now.
papertitle: Dissection of the styleâ€™s response to pollination using transcriptome
  profiling in self-compatible (Solanum pimpinellifolium) and self-incompatible (Solanum
  chilense) tomato species.
