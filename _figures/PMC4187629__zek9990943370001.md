caption: Diversity in the biosynthesis pathway of the universal tRNA modification
  t6A. The formation of TC-AMP is catalyzed by the same enzyme family in all organisms
  (TsaC/Sua5). Sua5p contains a TsaC domain plus an additional C-terminal domain,
  called Sua5, that has yet to be characterized. To transfer threonylcarbamoyl (TC)
  to tRNA, bacteria require TsaBDE, while archaea and eukaryotes use the KEOPS complex
  (composed of Kae1, Bud32, Cgi121, and Pcc1 proteins; Gon7 is found exclusively in
  fungi).
