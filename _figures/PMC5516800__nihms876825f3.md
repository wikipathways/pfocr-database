caption: 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) generated by glycolysis provides the initial substrate
  for serine biosynthesis. In the first step in the serine biosynthesis pathway, 3PG
  is oxidized by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) in a reaction that consumes
  NAD+. The second step is catalysed by phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1) in
  a reaction that is coupled to deamination of glutamate (Glu) to α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG). The last step is catalysed by phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP). The conversion
  of serine to glycine generates 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF), which is
  then used in folate metabolism and in the methionine cycle. Glycine is used to generate
  glutathione (GSH), and together with ribose-5-phosphate (Rib-5P) to generate purines.
  The folate pathway can generate NADPH, and 10-formyl-THF (10-CHO-THF). 10-CHO-THF
  together with Rib-5P and glycine participates in the generation of purines. Demethylation
  of 5-methyl-THF (CH3-THF) contributes one carbon to the methionine cycle by the
  methylation of homocysteine (Hcys) to generate methionine (Met). Methionine is converted
  into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and is used by methyltransferases. Demethylation
  of SAM generates S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is converted back into Hcys
  by deadenylation. The thickness of the arrows indicatesrelative flux. 1,3BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate;
