caption: As a signal integration platform, the ectodomain of the CD44v6 molecule can
  be bound with several cytokines, such as EGF, HGF, VEGF, and CXCL12, which are known
  to be potent in inducing cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis
  through activating MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (red line) and PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway (yellow line) after binding with their receptors. Moreover, due to the existing
  crosstalk between PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin (see ref. ), β-catenin translocates
  into the nucleus to promote the expression of EMT-associated genes, thus enabling
  the invasive and metastasis capabilities of CRC cells to be improved (green line)
