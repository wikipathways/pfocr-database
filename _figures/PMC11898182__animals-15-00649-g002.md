caption: The major intracellular metabolic pathway requires cobalamin. In the mitochondria,
  adenosylcobalamin is required as a cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which
  converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. In the cytoplasm, methylcobalamin
  is required as a cofactor for methionine synthase, which converts homocysteine to
  methionine and 5-methylhydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. Adapted from Toresson et
  al., 2019 [59]
