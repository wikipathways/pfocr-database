caption: A schematic of the DNA repair pathway. The formation of a DSB induces the
  phosphorylation of ATM, which contributes to the activation of the DNA repair pathway
  and cell cycle arrest. A series of molecular signalling events lead to the deployment
  of ubiquitylation (Ub) marks on the histones (red cylinders) in the proximity of
  DNA breaks, facilitated by RNF8 and RNF168. The recruitment of 53BP1 marks the key
  crossroad of DSB repair (DSBR) pathway, which branches out into error-free HR or
  relatively error-prone NHEJ. Small RNAs have been proposed to function at two distinct
  steps in DSBR. Francia et al. suggested that it affects early signal propagation
  through ATM phosphorylation (blue arrow), while Gao et al. proposed that it only
  affects the HR sub-pathway via modulation of Rad51 binding (red arrow)
