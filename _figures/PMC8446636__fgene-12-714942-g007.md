caption: Differential expression of genes involved in citrate cycle (TCA cycle) pathway
  in TM-1 and TM-38 at three developmental stages. Heat maps depict the normalized
  gene expression values, which represent the means ± SD of three biological replicates.
  Expression values of 18 libraries are presented as FPKM normalized log2-transformed
  counts.
