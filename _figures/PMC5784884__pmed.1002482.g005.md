caption: Schematic articulation of the core metabolic and signaling pathways in neurons,
  highlighting links between glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid classes of lipid
  species identified in the current study to be associated with the severity of AD
  pathology in the brain. Nutrient transporters (SLC5A7, SLC1A5, CD36, FATPs) present
  both at the BBB as well as the neuronal cell membrane mediate the uptake of amino
  acids, long chain fatty acids, and vitamin precursors into neurons necessary for
  the de novo synthesis of glycerophospholipid and SM lipid species [,]. The “metabolic
  pathway” section of the diagram represents the core metabolic pathways involved
  in the synthesis and recycling of glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid species.
  The “signaling pathway” section connects these lipid species to the core representative
  signaling cascades implicated in mediating multiple aspects of AD pathology in the
  brain, such as formation of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and AD-like
  brain atrophy. In a condition-dependent manner, incoming free fatty acids are incorporated
  into glycerolipids or ceramides in the endoplasmic reticulum. Similarly, LCFAs are
  processed in peroxisomal organelles to generate ether lipids. Coupling with the
  Kennedy pathway, glycerolipids and ether lipids are converted to either aa or ae
  PC species []. PCs are metabolized by the phospholipase or SML enzymes to recycle
  back phosphatidic acid or DAG or to generate SM, respectively. These lipid species
  are critical in the formation of lipid rafts, which represent essential structural
  and functional domains for maintaining neuronal function []. In AD, remodeling of
  lipid rafts, especially with enhanced activity of SMLs, results in an increased
  ceramide to SM ratio, which facilitates Aβ production by posttranslational stabilization
  of BACE1 enzyme. This leads to further generation of oligomeric Aβ due to a feed
  forward regulatory loop between Aβ and the SML enzymes []. Similarly, PC with saturated
  and unsaturated long-chain fatty acyl groups positively influence activity of the
  Ƴ-secretase enzyme by modulating cell membrane thickness and the lipid microenvironment
  of the enzyme []. Meanwhile, generation of lysophosphatidylcholine from membrane
  PC by both cytosolic PLA2G4A in Land’s cycle [] as well as the secretory soluble
  PLA2G2A can lead to dysregulation of intracellular calcium signaling in a G-protein
  receptor (GPR132, G2A) coupled manner. Dysregulated Ca2+ signaling can result in
  enhanced activity of CAMKII, which, in coordination with the ceramide–PP2A–GSK3β
  pathway, results in tau hyperphosphorylation, leading to the generation of PHF and
  enhanced neurofibrillary tangle formation []. Furthermore, altered ceramide signaling
  by down-regulation of AKT kinase activity via PP2A can trigger neuronal apoptosis
  by augmenting activity of the pro-apoptotic proteins, BAD and BIMEL. aa, diacyl;
