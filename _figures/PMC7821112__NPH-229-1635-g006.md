caption: A working model of the interactions among Hd1, Ghd7 and DTH8 for regulating
  heading date and photoperiod sensitivity (PS) in rice. (a) In the hd1/ghd7/dth8
  genotype, the basal expressions of Ehd1 and Hd3a/RFT1 are regulated by other pathways.
  ‘Ehd1/Hd3a/RFT1’ means that expression of these genes is regulated independently
  by the upstream regulator(s), or Ehd1 is first regulated and then Hd3a/RFT1 are
  regulated by Ehd1, or both ways. In the absence of functional Ghd7 and DTH8 alleles,
  Hd1 shows a primary role of promoting Hd3a/RFT1 expressions and heading under both
  short‐day (SD) and long‐day (LD) conditions. Ghd7 (hGd) or DTH8 (hgD) alone have
  weak effect on suppressing heading, mainly in LD conditions. In various combinations
  among the Hd1, Ghd7 and DTH8 alleles, under LD conditions Hd1 promotes Ghd7 expression
  and is also recruited by Ghd7 and/or DTH8 to form repressive complexes that have
  differently enhanced suppression effects on the Ehd1‐Hd3a/RFT1 pathway for repressing
  heading. In SD conditions, owing to the weakened suppression effect of Ghd7, the
  repressive functions of these complexes are decreased, and Hd1 competes with the
  complexes to promoting heading with reduced extents. The interactions of the different
  gene combinations (including multiple allelic variations of the genes) produce various
  extents of suppression and promotion effects on heading in response to different
  day‐lengths, and thus control different heading dates and confer various degrees
  of PS in rice populations. The different sizes of the marks for the proteins and
  promotion and repression indicate their relatively different levels of effect. Notably,
  the HGD working model we proposed for the PS control is based on the presence of
  other possibly essential factor(s) that are involved in photoperiodic flowering
  regulation in rice. (b) Simplified rice flowering regulatory pathways mediated commonly
  by Hd1 in LD and SD conditions. Other known factors related to these two pathways
  are omitted.
