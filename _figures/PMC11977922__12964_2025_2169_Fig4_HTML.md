caption: Mechanism through which STING activation leads to insulin resistance. STING
  promotes Pax6, inhibiting to the glucose stimulated secretion of insulin. The activation
  of STING-IRF3 pathway induces the expression of AIG1, which promotes insulin secretion
  through activating GPR40 receptor. TBK1 can directly phosphorylate Irβ, blocking
  the activity of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and the subsequent downstream
  signaling pathways. On the one hand, IRF3 phosphorylates IRs1 through interacting
  with JMJD8, on the other hand, IRF3 blocks PI3 K-AKT pathway, which is considered
  essential in insulin signaling. The activation of STING-NF-κB drives the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL- 6, promoting insulin resistance
