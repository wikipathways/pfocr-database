caption: The activated methyl cycle (AMC) drives the formation of methionine and its
  subsequent conversion to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which is primarily used for
  the methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins and certain metabolites. Donation of the SAM
  methyl group leads to formation of the toxic metabolite S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).
  SAH is removed by one of two mechanisms involving either one (SAHh) or two enzymes
  (Pfs and LuxS) to generate homocysteine and complete the AMC cycle. The Pfs/LuxS
  pathway also leads to the generation of DPD which spontaneously cyclizes to generate
  the furanones which constitute AI-2.
