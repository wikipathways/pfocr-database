caption: Metabolic reprogramming in glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI)-KO cells.
  A switch from glycolytic metabolism to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) caused
  by the complete GPI disruption is shown. LS174T WT cells are highly glycolytic and
  do not use mitochondria for ATP production (A). Contrarily, cells survive GPI disruption
  by re-activating pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and OXPHOS (B). Oxygen consumption
  rate (OCR) of LS174T WT and GPI-KO cells was evaluated with Seahorse XF24 bioanalyzer
  (C). The mean ± SEM is representative of four independent experiments performed
  in quadruplicate. The figure is adapted from Ref. (). Glc, glucose, oligo, oligomycin,
  FCCP, carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone, rot, rotenone, antA,
  antimycin A.
