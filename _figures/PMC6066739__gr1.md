caption: ERα subcellular localization allows the activation of both nuclear and membrane-initiated
  signaling pathways. This schematic representation first indicates the mechanistically
  distinct molecular pathways used by ERα to regulate gene transcription. The classical
  pathway (blue arrows) sequentially includes ligand (17β-estradiol, E2) activation
  of cytosolic ERα bound to heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), ERα dimerization, and direct
  DNA binding to estrogen response elements (ERE). The tethered pathway (middle) depends
  on protein–protein interaction with other transcription factors following ERα ligand
  activation. In that case, gene regulation relies on indirect DNA binding on AP1/SP1
  sites (through such interactions with other transcription factors). The membrane-initiated
  signal (MISS) pathway, also known as nongenomic pathway (green arrows), is mediated
  by a small pool of ERα localized close to the plasma membrane through ERα posttranslational
  modifications such as palmitoylation of Cys447 (human) or Cys551 (mouse) and direct
  interaction with caveolin-1. Upon E2 activation, membrane ERα interacts with protein
  kinases (Src and PI3K) or G-coupled protein αi (Gαi), leading to distinct signaling
  cascades (Akt, PKA, ERK1/2), and activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Grey
  arrows indicate the possible impact of the MISS pathway on nuclear/genomic pathways.
