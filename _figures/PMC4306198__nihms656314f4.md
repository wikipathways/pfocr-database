caption: Choline is taken into the cell by choline transporters that are upregulated
  in cancer. The biosynthesis of choline cycle metabolites by the Kennedy pathway
  (also called the CDP-choline pathway) is shown in black arrows. The catabolism of
  choline metabolites is shown in gray arrows. The metabolites are phosphocholine
  (pCho), cytidine diphosphate choline (CDP-Cho), and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho).
  Choline kinase (CHK), the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline to
  pCho is also upregulated in cancer. The reaction catalyzed by CTP-phosphocholine
  cytidylyltransferase (CCT) is the rate-limiting step. Finally, conversion of CDP-Cho
  to PtdCho is mediated by 1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (CPT1). PtdCho
  is degraded to choline by phospholipase D (PLD), an enzyme that is also upregulated
  in cancer cells. Other enzymes that are involved in the conversion of PtdCho to
  choline are phospholipase A2 (PLA2) that yields 1-acylglycerophosphocholine (1-acyl
  GPC), lyso-phospholipase A1 (lyso-PLA1) that converts 1-acyl GPC to GPC, and finally
  the enzyme GPC phosphodiesterase (GPC-PDE) converts GPC to choline.
