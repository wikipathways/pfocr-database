caption: Model for the CK-dependent photomorphogenic response in etiolated Arabidopsis
  seedlings. Dark-grown seedlings undergo skotomorphogenesis, which is characterized
  by elongation of the hypocotyl, closed cotyledons, and the formation of an apical
  hook. In the presence of CK, a photomorphogenic response results in the inhibition
  of hypocotyl elongation. This response can be either ethylene dependent (; ; ) or
  ethylene independent (as reported in this study). In the ethylene-independent signaling
  pathway, the CK signal is mediated through AHK3, in cooperation with either AHK2
  or CRE1/AHK4, via the B-type ARRs ARR1 and ARR12 to inhibit hypocotyl elongation
  via the modulation of COP1/DET1/CIN4. ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid;
  SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine.
