caption: 'Schematic representation of adiponectin signal transduction [118]. Implicating
  crosstalk with the insulin signaling pathway: insulin and adiponectin interact with
  their respective receptors, which trigger a cascade of signaling events. Insulin
  actions are mainly carried out by PI3K/AKT pathway, resulting in increased protein
  synthesis, lipogenesis, glucose uptake and utilization, glycogen synthesis, and
  reduced lipolysis and gluconeogenesis. Interaction of adiponectin with its receptors
  (Adipo R1 and R2) results in the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including
  IRS1/2, AMPK, and p38 MAPK. Activation of IRS1/2 by adiponectin signaling is a major
  mechanism by which adiponectin sensitizes insulin action in insulin-responsive tissues.
  Adiponectin drastically increases the expression and activity of PPARα, which upregulates
  acetyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), CPT1, and uncoupling proteins (UCPs), promoting FAO and
  energy expenditure. Reproduced from Achari et al. (2017) [118]'
