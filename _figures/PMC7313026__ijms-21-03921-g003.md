caption: RNF183 and RNF182 are involved in the regulation of the NF-κB pathway. First,
  RNF183 ubiquitylates IκBα. Then, the ubiquitylated IκBα is degraded, and next, the
  NF-κB pathway is activated. The miR-7 suppresses the transcription of RNF183. TNFα
  and prolonged ER stress decrease miR-7, resulting in an increased expression of
  RNF183. RNF182 ubiquitylates and degrades the subunit p65 of NF-κB, and the TLR
  stimuli induces the expression of RNF182. Both IκBα and the subunit p65 of NF-κB
  are ubiquitylated with K48 chain. The arrows indicate activation and the T-bars
  indicate inhibition.
