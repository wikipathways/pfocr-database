caption: A pattern diagram shows that ANXA6 regulates autophagy via inhibiting the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to induce radioresistance of NPC. Irradiation (IR) increases
  the expression of ANXA6 in NPC cell lines and patient tumor tissues, which, in turn,
  directly inhibits the expression of PI3K and further reduces the phosphorylation
  of AKT and mTOR. The reduced p-mTOR increases the expression of Beclin-1 (a key
  activator of autophagy) and advances the formation of phagophore consisting of ATG16L1
  (autophagy related 16-like 1), ATG12, ATG5 (autophagy related protein 5), and LC3
  protein. Additionally, P62 binds to autophagosomal membrane protein LC3 and delivers
  itself to autophagosome, which ultimately leads to a decline of P62. Finally, autophagolysosome
  formed by the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome can phagocytize injured organelles
  to maintain/restore metabolic homeostasis, contributing to the radioresistance of
  NPC. Arrows represent promotion events, and blunt arrows indicate suppression events.
