caption: Schematic representation of SPION-induced toxicity at cellular level. SPION
  may cause direct DNA damage or result in the generation of oxidative radicals that
  in turn have the potential to cause DNA damage (indirect), have an impact on actin
  cytoskeleton by modulating the Akt signalling pathway, and also alter the expression
  of various genes such as those involved in cell cycle regulation, iron homeostasis
  and pancreatic functioning.
