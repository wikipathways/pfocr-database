caption: 'Air pollution is a complex toxin causing diverse CNS pathology through several
  interrelated mechanisms that may lead to CNS disease. These effects can be categorized
  into four major groups: 1) Systemic inflammation; 2) Particulate matter; 3) Adsorbed
  compounds; 4) Ozone. While some CNS effects have been attributed to specific components
  of air pollution, a single clear pathway responsible for CNS damage has yet to be
  identified. In fact, due to the complex nature of this environmental toxin it is
  very likely that CNS pathology is due to the synergistic interaction of the multiple
  pathways listed here, making air pollution a potent, biologically relevant environmental
  exposure and a significant challenge for mechanistic inquiry. Black dots depict
  particulate matter.'
