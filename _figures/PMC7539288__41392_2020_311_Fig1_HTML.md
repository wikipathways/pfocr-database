caption: 'Overview of the NAD+ metabolism and its physiological function. Mammalian
  cells can synthesize NAD+ de novo from tryptophan by the kynurenine pathway or from
  NA by the Preiss‐Handler pathway, while most NAD+ is recycled via salvage pathways
  from nicotinamide (NAM), a by-production of NAD+-consuming reactions. NAD+ can be
  reduced into NADH in the metabolic processes, including glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation
  and the TCA cycle. NADH, in turn, drives the generation of ATP via OXPHOS, the production
  of lactic acid from pyruvate, and the desaturation of PUFAs. NADPH plays an essential
  role in antioxidant defense and regulates cellular signaling via NADPH oxidases
  (NOXs). Moreover, NAD+ is found to decorate various RNAs in different organisms
  as nucleotide analog and serves as an alternative adenylation donor for DNA ligation
  in NHEJ repair. NAD+ also acts as a co-substrate for a wide variety of enzymes,
  including PARPs, sirtuins, CD38/CD157 and SARM1, impacting metabolism, genomic stability,
  gene expression, inflammation, circadian rhythm and stress resistance. Using NAD+
  as a co-substrate, both PARPs and sirtuins regulate their target molecules, generating
  NAM as a by-product. The CD38/CD157 and SARM1 also catalyze NAD+ to NAM, producing
  ADPR and cADPR. Abbreviations: IDOs, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; QA, quinolinic
