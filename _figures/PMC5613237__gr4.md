caption: 'A: Galactose metabolism pathway. Genes that were up-regulated after culturing
  WallMEC on LATE ECM relative to MID ECM are marked in blue and underlined. An enrichment
  score of greater than 1.3 (calculated as the geometric mean of all the enrichment
  p-values (EASE scores), was used to determine differentially expressed genes in
  the pathway. The p-value (EASE score) was determined using a modified Fisher''s
  exact test with a default cut-off of 0.1. 4B:Lysosome pathway: Genes that were down-regulated
  following treatment of WallMEC with LATE_H relative to MID_H are marked in blue
  and underlined. Criteria for determining differentially expressed genes in the pathway
  are explained in the legend for A. 4C:p53 signaling pathway: Genes that were up-regulated
  following treatment of WallMEC with LATE_H relative to MID_H are marked in blue
  ovals. Criteria for determining differentially expressed genes in the pathway are
  explained in the legend for A. 4D:Wnt signaling pathway. Genes that were up-regulated
  following treatment of WallMEC with LATE_H relative to MID_H are marked in blue.
