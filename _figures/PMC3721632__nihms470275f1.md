caption: Vaccination can induce both T cells dependent and independent immune responses.
  A) T cells independent antibody response generated by strong B cells receptor (BCR)
  signal by antigens and activation of both Toll-like receptor (TLR) and proinflammatory
  cytokine response. B) Dendritic cells derived IL-23 and IL-1β induce robust Th17
  responses. IL-17 and IL-22 produced by Th17 cells activate epithelial cells mediated
  immune responses. Th17 targeted cytokines and chemokines (G-CSF and CXCL1) released
  from epithelial cells regulate neutrophils recruitment to the mucosal sites. Th17-mediated
  neutrophils response is reported to be essential for the protection against a range
  of pathogens. Epithelial cells also directly participate in limiting pathogens multiplication
  by the release of Th17 related cytokines regulated antimicrobial peptides. Apart
  from lymphotoxin signaling, Th17 cells involve in iBALT formation in the lung tissue
  by activating chemokines (CXCL13, CXCL19) released from the fibroblast. iBALT mediated
  local immune responses (both B and T cells response) are critical for clearance
  of influenza virus. Th17 cells also regulate late Th1 responses by modulating chemokines
  especially CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 response from epithelial cells. Th1-regulated
  cytokines (IFNγ or TNFα) and activation of macrophages are required for the immunity
  against M. tuberculosis. In addition, Th17 cells regulate polymeric immunoglobulin
  receptor (pIgR) expression on epithelial cells, which is essential for influx of
  B cells to the mucosal sites, however, the relevance of this pathway in Th17 mediated
  immunity is yet to determine.
