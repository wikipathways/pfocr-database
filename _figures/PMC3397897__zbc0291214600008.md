caption: Schematic presentation of signaling pathways and their downstream targets
  that are affected by a feedback loop between hBVR and PKCδ. The pleiotropic PKCδ
  and hBVR are activated by oxidative stress-mediating agents. The outcome of their
  activation for the most part has opposing effects on apoptosis/cell death and cell
  survival. The reductase activity of hBVR is directly linked to its phosphorylation
  and is the only mechanism for reduction of biliverdin, the product of heme oxidation,
  to bilirubin, the free radical quencher (). Heme oxidation by the heme oxygenase
  enzymes is regulated by BVR through two distinct mechanisms, AP-1 activation for
  HO-1 and blockade of HO-2 turnover (, ). Oxidative stress-activated PKCδ participation
  in the multistep apoptosis pathway involves activation by tyrosine kinases (, ),
  including c-Abl, translocation of both PKCδ and c-Abl to the mitochondria (, ) leading
  to cytochrome c release, and subsequent activation of caspase-9 leading to caspase-3
  cleavage and activation (, ). PKCδ transport to mitochondria is essential for apoptosis
  (). Caspase 3 generates the pro-apoptosis catalytic fragment of PKC-δ that translocates
  to the nucleus where it phosphorylates and inactivates DNA-dependent protein kinase
  (DNA-PK ()). hBVR activation of PKCδ enhances the pro-apoptotic activity of PKCδ
  by removing the inhibitory biliverdin, concomitantly generating anti-apoptotic bilirubin.
  Activation of hBVR by PKCδ increases cellular levels of the biliverdin generating
  enzymes HO-1 and HO-2. PKCδ and hBVR transactivation mediates a varied list of functions
  that are associated with their role in cell signaling, including transcriptional
  regulation (, , , –) and immunological response (, ). hBVR and PKCδ activities are
  linked in the PKCδ ERK1/2 signaling pathway in which the reductase is the scaffold
  for ERK1/2/PKCδ interaction ().
