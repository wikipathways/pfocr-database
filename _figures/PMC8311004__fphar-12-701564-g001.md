caption: TNFR1-dependent necroptosis pathways. TNF-⍺ binds to TNFR1 and recruits a
  series of proteins, including TRADD, RIPK1, TRAF2, cIAP1, CYLD, and NEMO, which
  is called complex I. NEMO recruits IKK⍺/IKKβ, resulting in the IKK-mediated phosphorylation
  of IkB⍺. Once IkB⍺ is phosphorylated, NF-kB signaling pathways are activated. When
  NF-κB activation is inhibited, deubiquitinated RIPK1, FADD and procaspase-8 are
  assembled as complex IIa. Complex IIa is involved in apoptosis by activated caspase-8
  and cleavage RIPK1. When there is a lack of caspase-8, the cIAP1 in complex I rapidly
  ubiquitinates RIPK1, leading to the combination of RIPK1 and RIPK3, which is called
  complex IIb. Complex IIb leads to MLKL-mediated necroptosis.
