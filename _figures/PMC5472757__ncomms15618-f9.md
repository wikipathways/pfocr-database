caption: Left, treatment with a radiation regimen that causes dsDNA accumulation in
  the cancer cells cytosol without inducing the DNAse Trex1 activates interferon type-I
  pathway via cGAS/STING. Downstream recruitment of DC and activation of CD8+ T cells
  is enabled and tumour rejection occurs in synergy with anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD-1 antibody.
  Right, in tumour treated with a dose of radiation above the threshold for Trex1
  induction dsDNA is cleared from the cytosol precluding interferon-β release by the
  cancer cells. This leads to insufficient DC recruitment and activation and lack
  of CD8+ T cell activation resulting in absence of local and abscopal tumour regression
  in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
