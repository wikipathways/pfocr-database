caption: Potential Signaling Pathway of Cell Senescence. When normal cells are stimulated
  by cell stress, the p53/p21 and p16 pathways will be activated, thus inhibiting
  the activity of CDK, and, consequently, inhibiting the phosphorylation of Rb. Rb
  binds to E2F, which promotes DNA replication, and inactivates it, eventually causing
  cell replication arrested at the G1/S phase, where cellular senescence occurs. As
  senescence regulatory factors, SIRT1 can deacetylate p53 and interfere with its
  nuclear translocation process, while Klotho can also inhibit senescence signals
  by inhibiting the p53/p21 pathway, thereby regulating cell senescence.
