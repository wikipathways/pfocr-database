caption: The relationship between oxidative stress and the Nrf2 signaling pathway
  in astrocytes. ROS or compounds stimulate Nrf2 transcription into the nucleus and
  participate in the transcription of target genes. increased synthesis of enzymes
  such as HO-1, NQO1, GPx, and MRP1 counteract oxidative stress and regulate metabolism.
  Nrf2 is also involved in regulating inflammatory responses.
