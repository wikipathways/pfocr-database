caption: VEGF-A binding to VEGFR2 activates intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of
  the receptors resulting in their transphosphorylation, recruitment of Src and subsequent
  phosphorylation of VE-cadherin by Src in the junctional complex. This results in
  the dissociation of junctional complex proteins such as VE-cadherin and β-catenin,
  thus disrupting endothelial barrier, and releasing β-arrestin from VE-cadherin causing
  internalization of VE-cadherins into vesicles through endocytosis, thus rendering
  the barrier permeable to intravasation of inflammatory cells. Phosphorylation of
  MLCK by Src results in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cellular contractions leading
  to dissociation of AJs, thus contributing to leaky endothelial barrier. SFK-mediated
  activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway regulates phosphorylation of FoxO1 and
  its cytosolic accumulation thereby preventing claudin-5 expression and permeability
  control in addition to promoting growth, survival and transcriptional regulation
  of tumor cells through phosphorylation of BAD, mTOR, S6K and GSK3. (VEGF, Vascular
  endothelial growth factor; MLCK, Myosin light chain kinase; AJ, Adherens junction;
  BAD, Bcl-2 associated death promoter; mTOR, Mammalian target of rapamycin; S6K,
  Ribosomal S6 kinase; GSK-3, Glycogen synthase kinase-3)
