caption: 'Simplistic schema of the molecular processes involved in depression. Chronic
  stress stimulates (1) locus coeruleus to release noradrenaline sustained by reciprocal
  stimulation by the hypothalamus and also pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin,
  IL −1, tumor necrotic factor, TNF etc.) increase; and (2) monocyte chemoattractant
  protein (MCP-1) increase to activate monocytes release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  (3) Pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate hypothalamus release of corticotropin releasing
  hormone (CRH) that (4) activates the pituitary to release the adrenocorticotropic
  hormone (ACTH). (5) ACTH activates the adrenal gland to release the glucocorticoids
  which enters the brain by activating glucocorticoid receptors. The feedback to the
  hypothalamus and pituitary is inhibited increasing circulating glucocorticoid level.
  (6) Glucocorticoid activates monocytes to sustain the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines; together they activate the kynurenine instead of the serotonin pathway.
  (7) Serotonin is normally synthesized from tryptophan by the action of tryptophan
  hydroxylase, which declines (8) Pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulated in the presence
  of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) result in the release of nitric oxide (NO) to activate
  the synthesis of more of glutamate neurotransmitter, already supplied through the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and less GABA production. (9) Phenylalanine in the
  presence of BH4 is converted to tyrosine and then dopamine by the tyrosine hydroxylase,
  with its subsequent conversion to noradrenaline by dopamine β-hydroxylase: these
  activities decrease the monoamines and further compounded by increase degradation
  by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-0-methyltransferase (COMT). (10) Glutamate
  decarboxylase (GAD) coverts glutamate to gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). (11) Glutamate
