caption: Proposed regulatory pathway for seed coat mucilage biosynthesis. AP2 and
  TTG1, EGL3/TT8, and MYB5/TT2 complex activate GL2 and TTG2, GL2 acts upstream of
  MUM4, and AtGATL5 is positively regulated by both GL2 and TTG2. MYB61 is independent
  from the AP2 and TTG1 pathway and positively regulates AtGATL5 slightly (dashed
  arrow). This pathway cartoon was adapted from , , and .
