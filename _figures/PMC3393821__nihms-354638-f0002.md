caption: 'The upper level of the diagram depicts signaling molecules at the cell surface,
  while the lower level depicts resulting changes in gene-transcription and apoptosis-related
  pathways. IL-15 signals through a receptor complex consisting of 3 subunits: the
  IL-15Rα, IL-2Rβ, and the common cytokine receptor γ chain, γc. IL-21 signals through
  a complex consisting of the IL-21 receptor (IL21R) and γc. IFNα and related proteins
  signal through the interferon receptor (IFNAR), which consists of 2 proteins, IFNAR1
  and IFNAR2. TNFα signals through two cell surface receptors, TNFR-1 and TNFR-2.
  Interleukins, interferons, and TNFα can all signal to the nucleus by way of the
  JAK-Stat pathway depicted on the left hand-side of the figure. In addition, TNFα
  can activate both an anti-apoptotic pathway involving activation of the NF-kappaB
  (central part of figure) and a pro-apoptotic pathway leading to caspase activation
  (right hand side of figure). Proteins shown in green were up-regulated at the mRNA
  level in AD subjects compared to HD and MD subjects, while those shown in red were
  down-regulated. Additional information on each of these pathways is included in
  the text.'
