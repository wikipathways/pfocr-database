caption: Signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic chemotaxis. The compass component
  consists of G protein窶田oupled receptors and other upstream components that can sense
  spatial gradients of chemoattractant concentration. Activation of receptors leads
  to the generation of signals through several interacting pathways. PI3K (kinase)
  and PTEN (phosphatase) control the concentration of PIP3 in the membrane. These
  lipids help to build a scaffold of signaling molecules through interactions with
  PH domain窶田ontaining proteins such as PKB. Chemoattractants can also influence PKB
  activity through activation of the TOR2 complex. A third pathway involving phospholipase
  A2 is also activated by chemoattractant binding. These events control a set of coordinated
  changes in the actin cytoskeleton leading to polarization of the cell, increased
  motility, and movement toward higher attractant concentrations. Figure courtesy
