caption: Schematic diagram emphasizing a localized PKD signaling cascade that contributes
  to the dynamic regulation of Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction in cardiac myocytes.
  The diagram depicts a multistep model for stimulus-dependent PKD activation, emphasizing
  an nPKC-dependent pathway to achieve PKD activation loop phosphorylations (oval
  labeled Act. Loop phos.), which is mimicked by our caPKD construct. An electrical
  stimulus is required to achieve further activation of this kinase. This step is
  reversible and most likely reflects the stimulus-dependent autophosphorylation of
  Ser916 (rectangle labeled PKD S916 phos.) within the catalytic domain of PKD and
  possibly at other sites within the regulatory domain of PKD (). Although phosphorylation
  of Ser916 may or may not be a direct readout of PKD activation state, it is required
  for the subsequent stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser22/23 and development
  of myofilament Ca2+ desensitization (pathway 1). Pathway 2 demonstrates additional
  EC coupling targets of PKD signaling that are consistent with the spatial distribution
  of PKD and functional analyses on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load and L-type
  calcium channel (LTCC) current (ICa) (, ).
