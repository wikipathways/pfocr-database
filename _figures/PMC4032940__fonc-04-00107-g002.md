caption: Activation of T cells results in metabolic reprograming, which influences
  their proliferation, differentiation, and effector functions. Aerobic glycolysis
  becomes the predominant metabolic pathway used by CD8+ effector cells, CD4+ Th1,
  Th2, and Th17 cells, by contrast TREG and TMEM rely on lipid oxidation. T cells
  that differentiate into Th17 cells primarily rely on glycolysis controlled by HIF-1α.
  TMEM and TREG rely on lipid oxidation under the control of AMPK. Tumor specific
  TMEM cell prevalence can be enhanced through the inhibition of glycolysis following
  treatment with the hexokinase-2 inhibitor 2DG. In addition, inhibition of mTOR by
  rapamycin and activation of AMPK by the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor metformin
  can also led to increased survival of TMEM cells. Etomoxir, a specific inhibitor
  of CPT1A results in the reduction of TREG prevalence and has also shown promising
  results in delaying tumor development.
