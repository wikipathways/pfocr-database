caption: Primary mechanisms by which VitD regulates the function of dendritic cells
  and T lymphocytes. In DCs, VitD binds to the VitD-R, which is complexed with RXR
  in the nucleus. VDR/RXR complex decreases expression of MHC-II, CD40, CD80, and
  CD86 and enhances the expression of CCL22, IL-10, and IL-T3, which results in the
  induction of T-cells. The VitD stimulates TCR, which induces VDR expression via
  the alternative p38 MAPK pathway. Then, VitD binding to VDR leads to inhibition
  of proinflammatory cytokine expression, including IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-21, and the
  development of T-reg cells. DC dendritic cell, MHC major histocompatibility complex,
  CCL22 chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 22, MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase, T-reg
