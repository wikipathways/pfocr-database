caption: Hypothetical model for adenoviral regulation of stress-induced EGFR signaling
  through NFκB. We hypothesize that viral cell entry activates two host cell pathways
  converging on NFκB. Capsid binding to αV integrins induces PI3K/Akt, which activates
  a canonical NFκB signaling pathway by promoting degradation of inhibitory IκB proteins
  and also unmasks a Pin1 substrate in NFκB-p65 (1); and viral cell entry elicits
  clathrin-mediated EGFR uptake to a stable subset of non-degradative MVBs (multivesicular
  body endosomes) downstream of p38-MAPK signaling (2). Similar to other cellular
  stresses, we hypothesize that EGFRs cycle between ILVs and limiting membranes under
  regulation of ESCRT proteins Hrs, Tsg101, and Alix (3). We have shown that stress-activated
  EGFRs (EGF receptors) (red highlights) facilitate phosphorylation of the Pin1 NFκB-p65
  substrate prior to its nuclear translocation (4), which is known to subsequently
  block nuclear export of IκB/NFκB complexes (5). E3-RIDα is produced 3 to 4 hours
  post-infection (6). Our published data support a working model that E3-RIDα antagonizes
  EGFR stress signaling from MVB limiting membranes (7); and promotes lysosomal degradation
  (8), by mechanisms involving host cell proteins Alix and Rab-interacting lysosomal
  protein (RILP).
