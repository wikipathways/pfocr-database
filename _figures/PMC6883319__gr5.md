caption: MetaCore-generated pathway showing differentially expressed genes involved
  in carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) regulation. Experimental
  data from all three GSE data sets are linked to and visualized on the maps as thermometer-like
  figures. Upward thermometers have red color and indicate upregulated signals and
  downward (blue) ones indicate downregulated expression levels of the genes. Annotations
  are listed in supplemental materials.
