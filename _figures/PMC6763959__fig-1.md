caption: Major pathway of the conversion of propionyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA, which
  occurs in the mitochondria. The biotin-dependent enzyme PCC converts propionyl-CoA
  into d-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is then racemized by MCEE into l-methylmalonyl-CoA
  and isomerized by MMUT into succinyl-CoA, a citric acid cycle intermediate. MMUT
  requires the cofactor adenosylcobalamin, a vitamin B12 derivative, to be enzymatically
  active. MCEE, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase; MMUT, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; PCC,
  propionyl-CoA carboxylase.
