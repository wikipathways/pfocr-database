caption: Upon viral infection, cytoplasmic viral sensors (RIG-I) and toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) detect viral pathogens, which results in IFNβ and IFNλs gene activation via
  the adaptor molecule IPS-1. IFNβ binds to type I IFN receptors, whereas IFNλs bind
  to type III IFN receptors comprising IL10R–IL28R receptor complexes. Both receptors
  activate the Jak–STAT pathway, which upregulates a large number of ISGs by activating
  the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). IL28B promoter activity is reportedly
  lower with unfavorable IL28B SNPs.RIG-I and ISG expressions in patients with unfavorable
  IL28B genotypes tend to be high at baseline and are insufficiently induced by exogenous
  IFN administration, resulting in poor treatment outcomes with IFN-based therapy.
  IFNλ4 is created by ss469415590 variant (ΔG), which is in high linkage disequilibrium
  with rs12979860. Although IFNλ4 induces ISGs by activating ISRE, this preactivation
  of IFN signaling impairs HCV clearance and prevents further activation by exogenous
  type I and type III IFNs.
