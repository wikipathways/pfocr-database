caption: Proteins that have been shown to be upregulated during the experiment are
  indicated in red, the downregulated ones are in green. The dsDNA produced by the
  TE is recognized by the Toll-like receptor TLR9 which senses CpG DNA. This leads
  to the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 by phosphorylation, which can bind host genome
  to stimulate IFN expression. The secreted IFN would then activate the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway. The phosphorylated STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 form the ISGF3 complex, which
  is translocated into the host nucleus, and thus stimulates IFIT family genes expression.
  IFIT1 and IFIT2 directly bind eIF3 and suppress transcription. IFIT2 interacts with
  MITA (Mediator of IRF3 activation), and induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial
  pathway that is induced by the innate immune response. IFIT2 can also interact with
  microtubules and could be responsible of cytoskeleton reorganization.
