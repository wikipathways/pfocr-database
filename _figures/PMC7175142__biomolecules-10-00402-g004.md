caption: Influence of lipid mediators on ER stress-dependent pathway.Disorders in
  synthesis or action of exogenous factors, like lipid mediators (black) may lead
  to the generation and accumulation of abnormal proteins (AP). In consequence these
  proteins induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of pro-apoptotic factors
  (red font). Moreover, ER stress leads to activation of mitochondrial pathway (yellow).
  On the other hand, during endoplasmic reticulum stress also some cytoprotective
  mechanisms are activated (green font).
