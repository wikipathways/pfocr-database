caption: Summary diagram of the proposed adrenomedullin (ADM) signaling pathway in
  the retina. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation can lead to increased transcription
  of the ADM gene via a PKC enhancer element. The ADM precursor preproadrenomedullin
  is cleaved to proadrenomedullin, which is then cleaved into the secreted peptide
  ADM and the proadrenomedullin NH2-terminal peptide (PAMP). ADM is secreted and binds
  to the G-protein coupled receptor calcitonin receptor like receptor (CRLR) that
  is associated with either the receptor activity modifying protein RAMP2 or RAMP3
  to activate a signaling cascade that increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
  by activating adenylyl cyclase. Increases in cAMP levels activate protein kinase
  A (PKA), which increases calcium levels by opening membrane calcium channels or
  by releasing intracellular calcium stores. The overall increase in intracellular
  calcium can increase nitric oxide (NO) production by directly stimulating nNOS or
  by activating nNOS through the activation of the calcium-activated phosphatase,
  calcineurin (CaN), which dephosphorylates nNOS at an inhibitory phosphorylation
  site at serine847. Increases in NO production can then increase in cGMP synthesis
  by activating soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC).
