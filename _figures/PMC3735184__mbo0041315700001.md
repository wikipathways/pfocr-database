caption: Proposed model for SHP-dependent interspecies signaling. In GAS (left), pro-SHP
  peptides, encoded by shp2 and shp3, are processed by Eep () and secreted by a yet-to-be-determined
  transporter. Secondary processing (proposed) produces a mature SHP pheromone that
  is imported by Opp (). SHPs interact with Rgg3, disrupting transcriptional repression
  of shp promoters, and interact with Rgg2 to induce transcription of shp promoters.
  SHP production and response in group B and G streptococcus is proposed on the right
  half of the figure. Pro-SHP peptides encoded by rgg-adjacent genes are proposed
  to follow a secretory, processing, and importation pathway similar to that of GAS.
  RovS and SDEG_0529 are orthologs of Rgg2 and, at least in the case of RovS, display
  transcriptional activation properties described herein.
