caption: p53 regulates carbohydrate metabolism during glucose starvation. During glucose
  starvation, p53 acts to promote mitochondrial respiration (blue arrows) through
  numerous mechanisms including enhanced pyruvate flux into the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle, increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO), decreased TCA metabolite export,
  greater mitochondrial quality control, more robust electron transport chain activity,
  and utilization of glutamate as an alternative carbon source for respiration. p53
  also limits glycolysis and suppresses undue nucleotide, amino acid, and fatty acid
  synthesis through many pathways. TIGAR, Tp53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator;
  HKII, hexokinase II; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; NADPH; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PKA, protein kinase
  A; PGAM, phosphoglycerate mutase; FA, fatty acid; AA, amino acid; MIEAP, mitochondria-eating
  protein; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; ME, malic enzyme.
