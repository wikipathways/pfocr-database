caption: Self-renewal and differentiation of gastric stem cells. Gastric stem cells
  have the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into various kinds of daughter
  cells, including surface mucous cells, mucous neck cells, chief cells, and parietal
  cells. Critical signaling pathways for each differentiation route are indicated
  in blue. Characteristic genes for each of the differentiated cells are indicated
  in orange. Arf1, ADP-ribosylation factor 1; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; Calm2,
