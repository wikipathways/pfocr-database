caption: The Intrinsic pathway is triggered by a disruption in the BAX:Bcl-2 protein
  ratio at the mitochondrion. Increase in this ratio allows for the homodimerization
  of BAX, and subsequent Cytochrome c efflux into the cytoplasm activates APAF-1.
  APAF-1 triggers Caspase 9 activation and the subsequent caspase cascade. The extrinsic
  pathway is triggered by ligand binding to the death receptors. Receptor activation
  leads to downstream recruitment of adapter proteins, such as FADD, resulting in
  the activation of Caspase 8 and the subsequent caspase cascade. Both pathways converge
  on Caspase 3, leading to apoptosis.
