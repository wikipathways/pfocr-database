caption: Proposed model for lipid rafts involvement in receptor-mediated cell death.
  According to the model proposed by , engagement of membrane death receptors within
  lipid rafts promotes their aggregation and the subsequent activation of cell death
  signaling pathway. Destruction of lipid rafts by cholesterol lowering (e.g., MβCD
  treatment) inhibits cancer cell death. By contrast, favoring the recruitment of
  death receptor within lipid rafts (e.g., perifosine or edelfosine treatment), the
  activation of death signals is favored. Modified from ,; .
