caption: The anti-inflammation effects by which SCFAs alleviates the development of
  myocardial infarction. Neutrophils are the first immune cells to infiltrate infracted
  myocardium and then activated by adhesion and chemokines released from injured endothelial
  and ROS from injured endothelium after MI. Ly6chi monocytes captured by CCL2 are
  recruited early to engulf necrotic debris and apoptotic myocardial cells mediated
  by NF-κB or the NLRP3 pathway in the first phase, and anti-inflammatory Ly6clow
  monocytes dependent on CX3CR1 occur later to participate in myocardial repair by
  releasing anti-inflammatory factor. DCs activated by CCR1, CCR2 or CXCR1 present
  antigen to naïve T cell. Th1 and Th17, two of the CD4+ subsets, enhance IFN-γ, TNFα
  and IL-17 secretion, whereas Th2 and regulatory T cells reacting to activate IL-10
  or TGF-βto increase M2 macrophages polarization and dampen inflammation. In addition,
  the leak-gut effect of dysbiosis may exacerbate the pro-inflammation effect on MI.
  The imbalance between inflammatory phagocytosis and anti-inflammatory response would
  aggravate MI. In MI progression, SCFAs might promote M2 macrophages polarization
  to suppress inflammatory responses and inhibit macrophages cells secreting the pro-inflammatory
  factor and avoid aggravation of viable areas of the myocardium. Moreover, SCFAs
  play an important role in T cells polarization and activation, especially Treg cells
  which could alleviate the inflammation injury in MI progression. ASC, apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing CARD; CCR, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor; CXCR3,
  chemokine C-X3-C-Motif Receptor 1; DC, dendritic cell; NLRP3, nucleotide-binding
