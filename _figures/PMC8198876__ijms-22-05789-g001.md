caption: 'The molecular mechanisms of AML: Molecular dysregulation alters the expression
  profile of genes such as CD33, IDH1/2, FLT3, and BCL-2. The activity of gemtuzumab
  ozogamicin (GO) is derived from internalization of the CD33-GO complex after successful
  binding of the monoclonal antibody on the surface of leukemic cells, leading to
  apoptosis of leukemic cells. FLT3 mutations stimulate downstream signaling through
  JAK2/STAT5, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and RAS/MEK/ERK. AML cells with FLT3-ITD mutations have
  a high genetic instability due to DNA double-strand breaks and are associated with
  poor clinical outcomes. Midostaurin, quizartinib, and gilteritinib effectively inhibit
  FLT3-ITD mutations. IDH1/2 mutation leads to reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R2-hydroxyglutarate
  (R2-HG) as an oncometabolite. IDH inhibitors inhibit production of R2-HG and thus
  block proliferation of leukemic cells. BCL-2 and MCL-1 prevent apoptosis of leukemic
  cells by regulating effector proteins such as BAX and BAK as cell death mediators.
  The native BH3-only protein venetoclax binds to BCL-2, thereby relieving the constraints
  on BAX/BAK activation and initiating apoptosis. The HH/GLI signaling pathway is
  associated with hematopoietic stem cell function. In leukemia cells, the signaling
  pathway is involved in resistance of AML cells to chemotherapy. Glasdegib effectively
  inhibits the HH/GLI signaling pathway by binding to SMO. Abbreviations: IDH, isocitrate
  dehydrogenase; FLT3, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3; BCL-2, B-cell lymphoma-2; JAK2/STAT5,
  Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5; PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin; RAS/MEK/ERK, rat
  sarcoma/rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma/extracellular signal-regulated kinase;
  ITD, internal tandem duplication; HH/GLI, hedgehog/glioma-associated oncogene homolog;
  AML, acute myeloid leukemia.'
