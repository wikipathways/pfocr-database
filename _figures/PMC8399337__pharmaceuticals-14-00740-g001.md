caption: Signaling pathway involved in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Different
  signaling pathways can activate epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through
  the activation of EMT transcription factors ZEB1, SNAIL, and TWIST. Interleukin
  6 (IL-6) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) can bind cytokine receptors. Signaling is conducted
  through the activation of Janus kinase (JAK) and the recruitment of signal transducer
  and activator of transcription proteins (STATs); the dimer of STATs translocates
  into the nucleus to activate the transcription of genes. The transforming growth
  factor β (TGF-β) signal is conducted by SMADs protein into the nucleus, and the
  trimer activates the transcription. Tyrosine kinase receptors (RTK), such as epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), or platelet-derived
  growth factor receptor (PDGFR), induce PI3K, AKT, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB).
  The TGF-β pathway and RTK are also able to trigger the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling
  pathway. The WNT signaling results in the release of β-Catenin from the glycogen
  synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β)–axis inhibition protein (AXIN) complex. β-Catenin moves
  into the nucleus and binds to the transcription factors T cell factor (TCF) and
  the lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF). Intracellular domain of the notch receptor
  (Notch ICD) is cleaved after the activation of the receptor, then it can translocate
  into the nucleus and act as a transcriptional co-activator. Hedgehog signaling induces
  EMT-associated gene expression through the activation of GLI1.

  description: Signaling pathway involved in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition.
    Different signaling pathways can activate epithelial to mesenchymal transition
    (EMT) through the activation of EMT transcription factors ZEB1, SNAIL, and TWIST.
    Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) can bind cytokine receptors. Signaling
    is conducted through the activation of Janus kinase (JAK) and the recruitment
    of signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STATs); the dimer
    of STATs translocates into the nucleus to activate the transcription of genes.
    The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signal is conducted by SMADs protein
    into the nucleus, and the trimer activates the transcription. Tyrosine kinase
    receptors (RTK), such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), fibroblast growth
    factor receptor (FGFR), or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), induce
    PI3K, AKT, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). The TGF-β pathway and RTK are also able
    to trigger the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. The WNT signaling results in
    the release of β-Catenin from the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β)–axis inhibition
    protein (AXIN) complex. β-Catenin moves into the nucleus and binds to the transcription
    factors T cell factor (TCF) and the lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF). Intracellular
    domain of the notch receptor (Notch ICD) is cleaved after the activation of the
    receptor, then it can translocate into the nucleus and act as a transcriptional
    co-activator. Hedgehog signaling induces EMT-associated gene expression through
    the activation of GLI1.
