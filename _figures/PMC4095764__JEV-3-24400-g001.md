caption: Physiological anticoagulant characteristics of blood vessels on endothelial
  cells. (a) Heparin-like proteoglycans located on endothelial cells’ surface enhance
  the inhibition capacity of anti-thrombin (AT). (b) Tissue factor pathway inhibitor
  (TFPI) inhibits tissue factor (TF) ability to initiate blood coagulation. TFPI actually
  binds to factor VIIa when this one interacts with TF. This inhibition is strengthened
  by the binding of factor Xa also neutralized by TFPI. (c) The protein C anticoagulant
  pathway takes place on endothelial cells surface. In this cascade, thrombin (T)
  procoagulant activity is inhibited by thrombomodulin (TM) enabling the activation
  of the protein C (PC) by thrombin via the endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR).
  The activated protein C (APC) detaches from the EPCR and interacts with the protein
  S (PS) to inactivate factor Va and VIIIa of the coagulation cascade.
