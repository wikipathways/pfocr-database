caption: Therapeutic HPV vaccines. A number of therapeutic vaccines have been developed
  targeting HPV E6 and/or E7 antigen(s), including live vector-based vaccines, peptide/protein-based
  vaccines, nucleic acid-based vaccines and cell-based vaccines. These vaccines likely
  control HPV infection through cell-mediated immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) prime
  naïve T cells through MHC:Antigen (Ag) complex with the help of costimulatory molecules
  (B7 on the DC and CD28 on the T cell). Antigens are processed and presented to CD4+
  T cells via MHC class II pathway and presented to CD8+ T cells via MHC class I pathway.
  The primed effector T cells are subsequently HPV-antigen-specific T cells. Activated
  CD8+ T cells kill tumor cells by inducing apoptosis in the target cells. Induction
  of CD4+ T cell help can augment the CD8+ T cell immune response, supplementing tumor
  killing.
