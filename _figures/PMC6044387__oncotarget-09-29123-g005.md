caption: '(A) The two co-occurring pathways in PDAC that are predicted to drive oncogenesis
  based on the mutational landscape representing two common driver pathways. (B) Alterations
  in p53 and cell cycle checkpoint pathways. p-value = C-PDAC vs Other subtypes, calculated
  using Fisher''s exact test. Red indicates activating genetic alterations whereas
  blue indicates inactivating alterations. Darker shades correspond to higher alteration
  frequencies. Each node within the pathway represent a gene and the highlighted segments
  within each node and the percentage representing the alteration in the three PDAC
  subtype: C-PDAC, QM-PDAC and EL-PDAC from left, centre, and right, respectively.
  (C) The pattern of genetic alteration in selected genes that encode proteins involved
  in the p53 and cell cycle checkpoint pathways. (D) Alterations in the MAPK, RTKs
  and PI3K signaling pathways. p-values = QM-PDAC vs Other subtypes, calculated using
  Fisher''s exact test. The connectivity of network components was extracted from
  Reactome Pathways, BioGrid and the literature. (E) The pattern of genetic alterations
  in selected genes that encode components of the MAPK and PI3K-mTOR pathways.'
