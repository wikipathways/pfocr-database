caption: The p53 signaling pathway targeted by hsa-mir-34a in liver cancer. Genes
  in the graph are colored by the degree of differential expression from low to high,
  from red to white to blue, in tumor versus normal tissue. Genes on the pathway that
  have not been assayed in TCGA data or used in the computation of the PAS are colored
  gray. hsa-mir-34a is represented by the orange triangle. Gray edges denote gene-gene
  interactions. Red edges denote miRNA-gene regulatory relationships between hsa-mir-34a
  and the genes on the pathway as predicted by TargetScan. Solid red edges contain
  literature support (). The dotted red edge between hsa-mir-34a and SERPINE1 lacks
  literature support; its family member hsa-mir-34c targets SERPINE1 (). The alternating
  dotted red edge between hsa-mir-34a and TP73 also lacks literature support as predicted
  by TargetScan. Rather, TP73 has been found to modulate hsa-mir-34a expression by
  acting on the hsa-mir-34a promotor ().
