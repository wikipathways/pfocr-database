caption: Molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in AD. Overexpression of BACE1-AS, BC200,
  and BDNF-AS is associated with BACE1 activity. Elevated level of 51A in AD patient
  altered splicing mode of SORL1, causing damage to APP processing and leading to
  promotion of the Aβ deposition. Upregulation of BC1 induces APP mRNA translation
  by binding to FMRP. Enhanced expression of NDM29 induces APP synthesis. Overexpression
  of LRP1-AS is involved in regulating Aβ accumulation. NAT-RAD18 level is upregulated
  in response to Aβ40. Overexpression of 17A is tightly associated with Aβ secretion
  and Aβ42 production. Down-expression of MEG3 promotes neuroinflammation via PI3/Akt
  pathway. Significantly upregulated expression of MALAT1 inhibits neuroinflammation
  through reducing IL-6 and TNF-α. NEAT1 and linc00507 have been characterized to
  be involved in Tau. Upregulation of NEAT1 promoted Tau protein phosphorylation by
  sponging miR-107, while elevated level of linc00507 enhances hyperphosphorylation
  of Tau protein through regulating miR-181c-5p/MAPT/TTBK1 pathway. Upregulation of
  NETA1 and MALAT1 promoted cell apoptosis by targeting miR-15/107 and miR-125b, respectively.
  In addition, EBF3-AS exhibits a role in regulating neurons apoptosis.
