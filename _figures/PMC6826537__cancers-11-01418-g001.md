caption: Pathways controlling the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program
  in prostate cancer (PC). Growth factors (e.g., transforming growth factor β (TGF-β),
  fibroblast growth factor (FGF), hepatocyte-derived growth factor (HGF), epidermal
  growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) released by the tumor
  microenvironment activate their cognate receptors (GFR, growth factor receptors;
  TGFβ-R, TGFβ receptor) thereby triggering downstream pathways. Through phosphoinositide-3
  kinase (PI3-K), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), small mother against decapentaplegic
  (Smad), glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK3β), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain
  enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), growth factors increase the activity of transcriptional
  repressors of Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2), Twist, and Snail families.
  They, in turn, down-regulate E-cadherin and other epithelial cell markers, while
  inducing mesenchymal proteins [,,,,,,,,]. As the ligand-bound steroid receptors
  (SRs) trigger rapid activation of these signaling circuits [,,], it might be hypothesized
  that such activation also contributes to EMT in PC. Canonical wingless-INT (Wnt)
  is implied in EMT of PC through activation of GSK3β. Stabilization and nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin then follow. This latter event leads to phosphorylation and nuclear
  translocation of snail family transcriptional repressors 1 (SNAI1). In such a way,
  the transcriptional activity of SNAI1 is enhanced []. Neurogenic locus notch homolog
  protein (Notch) 1–4 trans-membrane receptors can be activated by membrane-tethered
  ligands in mammals. Proteolytic cleavage of Notch receptors then follows, with the
  subsequent release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which then enter nuclei
  to activate the transcription factors hairy and enhancer of split (HES) 1 and 2
  as well as HES 1 related (HEY1). Through NF-kB, they control the expression of genes
  involved in EMT, such as Snail []. Mutually reinforcing mechanisms promoting the
  EMT program also occur. HES 1 and 2 as well as HEY1, indeed, positively affect HER2
  (Erb-B2) transcription, thereby creating an activator loop of Erb-B2-dependent signaling.
  In such a way, PI3-K- and MAPK-dependent signaling is amplified. A role for the
  Notch pathway in EMT and spreading of PC has been reported [].
