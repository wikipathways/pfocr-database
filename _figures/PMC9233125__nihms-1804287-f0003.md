caption: Mutant KRAS induces the transcription of Myc via the MAPK pathway increasing
  rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes, such as RPIA known to sustain nucleotide synthesis.
  In KRAS mutant tumors, p53 triggers the accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and
  acts as a substrate for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which leads to chromatin
  modification resulting in increased cell differentiation and a decrease in cell
  fitness. Mutant KRAS can stimulate macropinocytosis and autophagy to recycle the
  necessary nucleotides, fatty acids, sugar, and amino acids required for cell turn
  over. KRAS mutations also provide near perfect conditions for cancer cells to thrive
  by elevating the levels of glucose and glycolytic intermediates, cellular redox
  potential, as well as fatty acids and glutamine uptake.
