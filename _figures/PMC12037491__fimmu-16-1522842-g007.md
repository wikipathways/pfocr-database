caption: 'Possible mechanism of central tolerance of thymic T cells induced by H.pylori
  OMVs. (A), During the positive selection phase, crosstalk might occur between the
  OMV activation pathway and the MHC pathway, which might regulate the stability of
  CHMP5 protein and promote the development of positively selected T cells. (B), During
  the negative selection phase, crosstalk might occur between the OMV activation pathway
  and the TCR signaling pathway to promote T cell apoptosis. *P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01,
