caption: Activated NF‐κB signalling pathway in OA‐FLS inflammation. CTGF promoted
  the generation of IL‐6 in human OA‐FLS through the ανβ5 integrin, ASK1, p38/JNK
  and AP‐1/NF‐kB signal transduction pathways. CTGF‐induced IL‐β in human OA‐FLS through
  αvβ3/ανβ5 integrins, ROS, and ASK1, p38/JNK, and NF‐κB signal transduction pathways,
  which attenuated by berberine, an anti‐inflammatory isoquinoline alkaloid separated
  from the Chinese herb Rhizoma coptidis (Huang Lian). CTGF enhanced MCP‐1 production
  in human OA‐FLS through the ανβ5 integrin, FAK, MEK, ERK and NF‐κB/AP‐1 signalling
  pathway. FSLT1 elevated TNF‐α, IL‐1β and IL‐6 generation in human OA‐FLS via activated
  NF‐κB signalling pathway. FSLT1 increased OA‐FLS proliferation by down‐regulating
  p53 and p21. Moreover, p21 was reported to block the elevated IL‐6 and MMPs, participated
  in the development of OA. WY‐14643, an agonist of PPAR‐α, decreased LPS‐induced
  NO, PGE2, inflammatory mediators (VCAM‐1, ICAM‐1, ET‐1 and TF), and pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines (IL‐6, IL‐1β, TNF‐α and MCP‐1) production in human OA‐FLS by suppressing
  LPS‐mediated NF‐κB activation and IkB phosphorylation. p53, a tumour‐suppressor
  protein. p21, a cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitor
