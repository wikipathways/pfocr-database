caption: Hypothetical pathway by which desflurane/hypoxia induces a vicious cycle  of
  apoptosis and Aβ generation/aggregation. Desflurane/hypoxia  induces caspase-3 activation/apoptosis.
  Caspase activation, in turn, increases  BACE levels, which serves to increase Aβ
  generation. Desflurane/hypoxia  also enhances Aβ aggregation, which further induces
  caspase-3 activation  and apoptosis. Elevated Aβ generation and Aβ aggregation then  further
  induces apoptosis leading to a vicious cycle of  desflurane/hypoxia-induced apoptosis
  and Aβ generation/aggregation.
