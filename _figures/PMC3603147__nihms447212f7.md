caption: TMZ triggers loss of K+i, Cl−i and apoptotic volume decrease (AVD), and leads
  to apoptotic cell death in glioblastoma cancer cells. NKCC1 activity may be stimulated
  via the novel Cl−/volume-sensitive regulatory kinases WNK-mediated signaling transduction
  pathway in response to TMZ. Activation of NKCC1 in TMZ-treated cells accumulate
  Na+i, K+i, and Cl−i and obligated water molecules (regulatory volume increase, RVI)
  to counteract ionic dysregulation and AVD and promote cell survival. Inhibition
  of NKCC1 activity with BMT would facilitate loss of K+i, Cl−i and AVD, thus augments
  glioma cells to TMZ-mediated apoptosis.
