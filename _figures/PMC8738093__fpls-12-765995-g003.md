caption: Regulation of the floral transition by the brassinosteroid signaling pathway
  in different photoperiods. Proteins involved in positive or negative signaling pathways
  under LD are shown in ovals with a light or dark orange background, respectively.
  Under short-day conditions, the lack of brassinosteroids resulted in a non-flowering
  phenotype. The positive regulatory interactions are depicted by blue arrows and
  negative interactions are depicted by red T-bars. The thick lines represent protein-protein
  interactions, whereas thin lines indicate transcriptional regulation. Protein complexes
  are depicted as partially overlapping ovals.
