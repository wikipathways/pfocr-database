caption: 'Antigen, Cytokines and Molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of
  LGLs. Mainly HTLV1 virus and cytokines like IL15 and PDGF acts as an antigen stimulus
  for polyclonal proliferation of LGLs this is followed by acquisition of mutations
  at various molecular pathways leading to clonal proliferation and increased survival
  of these cells. The major pathways involved are described here. JAK-STAT3 Signalling
  Pathway: STAT3 is continuously activated in LGL leukemia, it inhibits apoptosis
  by increasing the transcription of Mcl-1 which is an anti-apoptotic protein; FAS/FAS-L-mediated
  Pathway: LGL leukemia cells are resistant to FAS mediated apoptosis, soluble cleaved
  product of FAS (sFAS) is interferes with the anti-apoptotic action of FAS; RAS-RAF-1-MEK1-ERK
  Pathway: This pathway acts by modulating the transcription of Mcl-1, this pathway
  is upregulated in LGL leukemia and is associated with inhibition of apoptosis; PI3K/AKT
  Pathway: Increased activity of this is seen in LGL leukemia, it also controls apoptosis
  through Mcl-1 and is responsible for inhibition of apoptosis; NF-KB Pathway: activity
  is increased in LGL leukemia and it acts through downstream of the PI3K-AKT pathway
  to prevent apoptosis; Sphingolipid Rheostat Pathway: SP1 level is increased in LGL
  leukemia and is responsible for increased survival of the cells and when its metabolite
  ceramide levels are increased, it puts in the signal for apoptosis. It acts through
  downstream of ERK pathways and prevents apoptosis.'
