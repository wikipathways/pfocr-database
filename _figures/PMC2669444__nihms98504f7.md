caption: A. Proposed model of laminin function in neuronal migration.We hypothesize
  that laminin produced by migrating neurons is deposited around neuronal processes
  and along the radial glial fibers, and induces extension of the leading process
  toward the pia, and mediates glial-neuron interactions. When laminin is depleted,
  the leading process extension is retarded, the glial-neuron interaction is disrupted,
  and migration defects result. In addition, lack of laminin affects neurite growth
  causing abnormal neuronal morphology.B. Signaling pathways involved in laminin function
  in neuronal morphogenesis.Laminin binding to integrin receptors induces integrin
  clustering and activation, which then trigger phosphorylation of the downstream
  molecules such as FAK and paxillin. Integrin-associated molecules activate AKT by
  ILK. Activated AKT phosphorylates GSK-3β and inactivate its activity. Inactivated
  GSK-3β regulates microtubule assembly through molecules such as CRMP-2 to promote
  neurite elongation.
