caption: The new method was tested on the limonene and isopentenol metabolic pathways.
  The limonene (blue) and isopentenol (red) producing pathways are variants of the
  mevalonate pathway. Time-series proteomics and metabolomics data are used to learn
  the dynamics of both the isopentenol and limonene producing strains. Additionally,
  a kinetic model is created and compared to the machine learning approach for the
  more complex limonene production pathway (Fig. ). This pathway model is also used
  to generate simulated data to further evaluate the scaling properties of the proposed
  machine learning approach. See the original data set for enzyme and metabolite acronyms
