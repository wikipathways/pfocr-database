caption: Three different architectures that extend two-component systems beyond simple
  linear pathwaysA) One-to-many branched pathway. One histidine kinase phosphorylates
  two response regulators.B) Many-to-one branched pathway. Two histidine kinases phosphorylate
  the same response regulator.C) Connector-mediated pathway. The HK1/RR1 two-component
  system activates expression of a connector protein X, which modulates the activity
  of the HK2/RR2 system. X may act on the histidine kinase or response regulator and
  may increase or decrease RR2 phosphorylation.
