caption: '(A) The permissive candidacy portion of the PIP. GWAS lead SNPs and known
  significant genes for the phenotype of interest are encoded by the user in an MVF
  and expanded by population-specific linkage and body SNP mapping, respectively,
  to generate a list of permissive candidate variants (PCVs). (B) The ERV workflow.
  All of the PCVs are evaluated as putative regulatory SNPs using tissue-specific
  omics data on phenotype-relevant tissues encoded by the user in an MTF. They are
  evaluated according to the regulatory function of the chromatin state segment in
  which they reside, the dependence of that regulatory function on the variant allele
  and the presence of identifiable target gene relationships. (C) The coding variant
  (CV) workflow. In the CV workflow, all the PCVs are analyzed to investigate whether
  they are nonsynonymous CVs with a meaningful minor allele frequency. (D) The hierarchical
  mapping portion of the PIP. Variants passing either workflow (intermediate candidate
  variants) are associated with target genes, and those expressed in relevant tissues
  (per the MTF) are subjected to pathway mapping and gene-set enrichment in IPA®.
  Gene sets associated with significant and related pathways are regarded as substantive,
  and the variants influencing them (regulatory and coding) are considered candidate
  variants.ERV: Expression regulatory variant; GWAS: Genome-wide association study;
