caption: Stimulation of βAR leads to activation of G protein signaling to induce changes
  in transcript expression via classical cAMP-PKA-mediated signaling. βAR stimulation
  also induces the transactivation of EGFR, which alters transcript expression directly,
  or indirectly by antagonizing the classical βAR-cAMP-PKA pathway, effects that are
  blocked with Gef treatment.
