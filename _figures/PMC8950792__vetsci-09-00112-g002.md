caption: Orexin signaling pathways in mammalian (a) and avian species (b). “?” means
  that the downstream mediators are still not known or not well defined. Clear connections
  have been made to the link between orexin and the activation of energy sensing AMPK
  within the central nervous system of mammals. This provides a basis for connecting
  feeding behavior with orexin. Additionally, the ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways
  have been seen in hepatic response to orexin, inducing diverse cellular responses.
  While the main mechanism of action has yet to be determined, adipose tissue is shown
  to increase cytokines and other factors in response to orexin. In avian species,
  the ERK1/2 pathway has also been implicated in the liver response to orexin. Several
  mitochondrial related genes were shown to respond to orexin in avian muscle, but
  the direct mechanism of impact has yet to be elucidated. Culpable molecular signaling
  pathways have yet to be discovered in the avian central nervous system and adipose
  tissue response to orexin. AKT—Ak strain transforming kinase; AMPK—adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; BAT—brown adipose tissue; CaMKKβ—Calcium/Calmodulin dependent protein

  cORX-R2—chicken orexin receptor 2; CREB—cAMP-response element binding protein; ERK1/2—extracellular-signal-regulated
