caption: (A) Working model for the occurrence of bisexual flowers. After the application
  of ethephon, ABA and MeJA were significantly induced by an unknown pathway. Shikimic
  acid was significantly up-regulated and then form three essential aromatic amino
  acids including tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Subsequently, IAA was biosynthesized
  depend on tryptophan metabolism. L-phenylalanine and tyrosine were able to form
  4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and then to synthesize SA. L-phenylalanine and 4-hydroxycinnami
  acid also participate in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and generated p-coumaroyl-CoA
  can act as the precursors to synthesize many flavonoids. Besides p-coumaroyl-CoA,
  flavonoids can also be synthesized by the precursor malonyl-CoA which derived from
  carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, metabolites involved in carbon metabolism
  and nitrogen metabolism were differently expressed which led to the change of C/N
  ratio. The occurrence of bisexual flowers resulted from the interaction of multiple
  factors in melon. The pink and blue rectangle respectively represent up-regulated
  and down-regulated metabolites. The gradient rectangle represents multi-metabolites
  including up-regulated and down-regulated metabolites. The hollow rectangle represents
  the unknown variation. (B) Heat maps of differentially expressed genes involved
  in ethylene, auxin and salicylic acid signaling pathways. The blue color indicated
  lower expression while red indicated higher expression. The transcriptome data were
  acquired in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database of the National Center for Biotechnology
  Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with accession number PRJNA657708.
