caption: The role of BRCA1 in the DNA damage response was activated in intestinal-type
  GC. (a) Gene expression and pathway activity predictions in diffuse-type GC are
  shown. (b) Gene expression and pathway activity predictions in intestinal-type GC
  are shown. The genes whose expression was altered in diffuse- and intestinal-type
  GC are shown in pink (upregulated) or green (downregulated). Predicted activation
  and inhibition are shown in orange and blue, respectively.
