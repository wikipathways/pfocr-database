caption: Ethylene signaling and salt stress response. Black arrows and lines indicate
  active receptor signaling, which leads to temporary sensitive response under salt
  stress through suppression of AtNAC2 and activation of AtERF4. Red arrows and lines
  indicate active ethylene signaling, which inhibits receptor signaling and leads
  to tolerant response under salt stress. Green lines and bars indicate the pathway
  regulating the EIN3 stability. Blue arrows and lines indicate new pathway bypassing
  EIN2 and regulating ethylene response and salt stress response.
