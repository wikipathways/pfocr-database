caption: In the presence of IRGM1, damaged and IFN-γ-stressed mitochondria are removed
  by mitophagy, protecting against mitochondrial DAMP–induced interferonopathy and
  autoinflammatory responses. IRGM1 deficiency in fibroblasts promotes lysosome dysfunction,
  allowing the cytoplasmic activation of the cGAS–STING pathway by cytosolic mtDNA.
  By contrast, in bone-marrow-derived macrophages, IRGM1 promotes autophagosome–lysosome
  fusion to suppress the activation of endosomal TLR7 by mitochondrial DAMPs.
