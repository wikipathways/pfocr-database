caption: The mTOR is a serine–threonine protein kinase, which forms two complexes,
  rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 and relatively rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2 (not shown).
  mTORC1 stimulates downstream signaling mechanisms involved in ribosomal biogenesis
  (S6K and ribosomal S6) and protein translation (4E-BP1 and eIF4E). Primarily through
  regulation of protein synthesis, the mTOR pathway modulates a variety of important
  physiological functions, such as cell growth and proliferation, metabolism and brain-specific
  processes. By similar mechanisms, the mTOR pathway may influence epileptogenesis
  under pathological conditions (e.g., synaptic reorganization, ion channel expression
  and neuronal death). In turn, the mTOR pathway may be activated or inhibited by
  various physiological or pathological stimuli via various upstream signaling pathways
  and intermediary proteins (TSC1, TSC2 and Rheb). Genetic mutations in different
  elements of these upstream pathways (TSC1, TSC2, PTEN and STRADα) have been identified
  that cause hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway and may lead to various disease phenotypes,
  including epilepsy. Adapted with permission from [].
