caption: Speculative mechanisms of MuSK MG immunopathology. The proposed mechanistic
  path to autoantibody production in MuSK MG begins with naïve B cells (Steps A and
  B), which likely encounter self-antigen(s) and receive T cell help in the lymphoid
  tissue (C). They then differentiate into memory B cells (D) and antibody-secreting
  plasmablasts (E). Most autoantibodies in MuSK MG are of the IgG4 subclass. Antibodies
  of the IgG4 subclass can undergo the process of Fab-arm exchange with other antibodies
  of the IgG4 subclass. Consequently, the divalent mono-specific MuSK autoantibodies
  become monovalent bispecific autoantibodies. These autoantibodies migrate to the
  neuromuscular junction where they bind to MuSK hindering the neuromuscular transmission
  by blocking the LRP4 and MuSK pathway which is important for the clustering of the
  AChR. Several therapeutic strategies target different parts of this process in MuSK
  MG. B cell depletion by anti-CD20 antibodies is thought to remove B cells expressing
  CD20 which includes memory cells and a subset of plasmablasts. Anti CD19 antibodies
  can additionally target further subsets of plasmablasts. FcRn inhibitors increase
  the elimination of circulating IgGs, which is expected to also reduce the levels
  of pathogenic autoantibodies.
