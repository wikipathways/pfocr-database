caption: Brassinosteroid pathway is shaded green. Brassinosteroids (BR) binding to
  the cell surface receptor BRI1 (BR INSENSITIVE 1) induces association with the co-receptor
  BAK1 (BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1). BSK1 (BR SIGNALING KINASE 1) is phosphorylated
  by BRI1 and interacts with BSU1 (BRI1 SUPPRESSOR 1) family of proteins including
  BSL1 (BSU1-like 1) []. BSL1 is a target of the P. infestans effector Avr2 []. BSU1
  dephosphorylates and inhibits BIN2 (BR-INSENSITIVE 2) allowing the transcription
  factors (TF) BZR1 (BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1) and BES1 (BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1) to
  induce brassinosteroid response genes and others involved in immunity e.g. Chitinase
  TaCht20.2, and TFs WRKY11, WRKY15, WRKY18 and HBI1 (HOMOLOG OF BEE2 INTERACTING
  WITH IBH1) [,]. In a phosphorylated state, BIN2 phosphorylates BES1 and BZR1 repressing
  brassinosteroid responses. BIN2 also phosphorylates and destabilizes JAZ1 (JASMONATE
  ZIM-domain), an inhibitor of JA transcription factors inducing JA responses [].
  BSK1 is also activated by MAMP-triggered immunity, which in turn activates MAPKKK5
  (MAPK Kinase Kinase 5) inducing MAMP-triggered immunity signalling []. BES1 is a
  substrate of MPK6 (MAP Kinase 6) induced by MAMP-triggered immunity signalling [].
  ABA pathway is shaded purple. ABA binds to its receptor PYR1 (PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE1),
  which is up-regulated during biotic stress. This inhibits the activity of ABI1/2
  (ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 1 and 2) thereby activating downstream signalling via
  phosphorylation of SnRK2 (SNF1-related kinases 2), resulting in phosphorylation
  of the transcription factorsABI5/ABFs (ABRE-binding factors) inducing ABA responses
  []. Increasing ABA dampens SA signalling and induces ethylene signalling. ABI1/2
  de-phosphorylate and inactivate BIN2, activating Brassinosteroid transcriptional
  responses []. Cytokinins pathway is shaded beige. Cytokinins (CK) bind to their
  receptors; AHK2, AHK3 (HYBRID HISTIDINE PROTEIN KINASE 2, 3), CRE1 (CYTOKININ RESPONSE
  1), and CKI1 (CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT 1) that result in phosphorylation of the histidine
  kinase domain (H) and transphosphorylation of the receiver domain (D). AHPs (histidine
  phosphotransfer proteins) transmit the signal from the receptor to B-type ARRs (nuclear
  response regulators). ARR1/2/10 induce the transcription of A-type ARRs (ARR4/5/6/7)
  to induce cytokinins responses and a negative feedback loop []. The effector, HopQ1,
  from P. syringae induces the transcription of A-type ARRs to suppress immunity mediated
  by FSL2 []. Cytokinins and SA act synergistically with ARR2 binding TGA3, to promote
  the expression of PR-1 []. Strigolactones pathway is shaded blue. Strigolactones
  (SL) binds to DWARF14 (D14) receptor which induces the formation of a protein complex
  with the negative regulator SMXL6 (SUPPRESSOR OF MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 1 LIKE) and
  the F-box protein, SCFMAX2 (MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2) resulting in degradation of this
  complex. This subsequently induces activation of SL responses and transcription
  of SMXL6, 7, 8 [,]. SCFMAX2 interacts with BZR1 and BES1 resulting in their degradation
  []. Ethylene pathway is shaded pink. Ethylene receptors are ER localized and in
  the presence of ethylene (ET) are inhibited, reducing the activity of a Raf-like
  serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase, CTR1 which in turn activates the Nramp metal
  ion transporter family protein EIN2 (ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 2), allowing transcription
  factors; EIN3, EIL (EIN3-like), and ERFs (ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORS) to induce transcription
  []. The ERF Family Transcription Factors, OCTADECANOID-RESPONSIVE ARABIDOPSIS 59
  (ORA59) and RAP2.3 interact to mediate ethylene signalling []. During ethylene signalling
  ORA59 binds the ERELEE4 promoter element however when induced by JA it binds a GCC
  box promoter element to induce JA transcriptional activation []. The authors acknowledge
  that all known and emerging interaction events could not be included in this figure
  created with BioRender.com.
