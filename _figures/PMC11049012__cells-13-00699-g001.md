caption: BCG-driven activation of the bladder cancer TME involves the NFκB/TNFα signaling
  pathway and IRFs/IFN pathway. While the IRF/IFN pathway selectively induces the
  chemokines attracting the desirable effector cells, the NFκB/TNFα pathway enhances
  the induction of both the CTL-attracting cytokines, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11,
  but also amplifies the undesirable COX2/PGE2/EP4 pathway, which orchestrates the
  induction, activation, and recruitment of MDSCs and Tregs, through chemokines such
  as CXCL8, CXCL12, and CCL22. The combination of BCG with COX2- or EP4 blockers can
  selectively augment the attraction of CTLs while neutralizing PGE2-dependent suppressive
  factors and Treg and MDSC attractants, suggesting its potential to augment effective
  anti-tumor immunity in response to BCG treatment
