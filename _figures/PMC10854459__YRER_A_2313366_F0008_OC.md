caption: Schematic diagram of the anticancer role of JAC in AGS cells. JAC plays an
  anti-GC activity by accumulating ROS further induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis
  through the MAPK/STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathway, arresting cells in the G0/G1 phase
  by inhibiting the AKT signaling pathway and inhibiting cell migration by inhibiting
  the Wnt-3a/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway
