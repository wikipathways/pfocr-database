caption: (A) Network illustrates the regulatory relationship between TFs and their
  target genes in siderophore synthesis pathway. Circles indicate TF proteins, and
  squares indicate target genes. Diamond highlights the gene with auto-regulation.
  Red arrows show the binding sites located in the putative promoters of the target
  genes, establishing the regulatory relationship. Black arrows highlight the binding
  with additional experimental validation, shown in panels B and C. To save space,
  ‘PA’ is removed in the names of all TFs and their target genes. (B) Electrophoretic
  mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiment validates the binding of PA1315 (head-to-head)
  in its own promoter. By contrast, the promoter fragment of rocA1 is used as the
  negative control. Note that the up-shift bands of DNA in gel were observed in the
  experiment. The fragments of negative control DNA showed no binding to PA1315. The
  TF motif of PA1315 is shown in the upper panel of EMSA. Arrows indicate half-sites
  in dimeric binding. (C) Validation of the predicted binding for PA1413 (head-to-head)
  in the promoters of PA2384 were conducted using EMSA. Note that a binding-caused
  up-shift of the DNA bands were observed. By contrast, the promoter of PA4842 was
  used as the negative controls showing no binding. The TF motif of PA1413 is shown
  in the upper panel of EMSA. Arrows indicate half-sites in dimeric binding.
