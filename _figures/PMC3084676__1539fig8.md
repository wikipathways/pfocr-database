caption: A model of nestin as a regulator of Cdk5 signaling pathway in differentiating
  myoblasts. Nestin regulates the Cdk5/p35 signaling complex through sequestration.
  In differentiating myoblasts, nestin scaffold participates in the regulation of
  p35 processing and p25 generation, thus promoting the differentiation process. PKCζ
  is an important upstream regulator of p35, as PKCζ-mediated phosphorylation facilitates
  the calpain-dependent p35 cleavage (de Thonel et al., ). Cdk5 critically regulates
  the stability and reorganization of its own nestin scaffold.
