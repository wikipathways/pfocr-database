caption: 'Increased IL-17 induced by rituximab or irradiation promotes the growth
  of DLBCL cells. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) or irradiation promotes
  DLBCL cells to secrete IL-6, thereby inducing the secretion of IL-17 by Foxp3+Treg
  cells. This group of cells is named IL-17+Foxp3+Treg cells, which is an intermediate
  cells group between Th17 and Treg cells. The mechanisms of IL-17 promoting the growth
  of DLBCL cells are as follows: (1) IL-17 promotes the formation of tumor angiogenesis.
  (2) IL-17 promotes the expression of tumor apoptotic suppressor p53. These two mechanisms
  are confirmed. (3) IL-17 may trigger the pathway of TPL2/MAPK by binding to IL-17R.
