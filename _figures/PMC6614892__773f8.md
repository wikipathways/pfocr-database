caption: Ttk69 as a central node of a transcriptional regulatory network coordinating
  terminal cell fate acquisition and the arrest of cell proliferation. In response
  to Notch pathway activation (), Ttk69 (1) downregulates CycE expression inducing
  transition from a mitotic to endocycle mode of the cell cycle, and (2) downregulates
  ham and upregulates Su(H) expression. Downregulation of ham expression prevents
  the acquisition of neural fate induced by the combined action of Seq (Sequoia) and
  Ham (; ). Upregulation of Su(H) expression allows the terminal differentiation of
  socket cells.
