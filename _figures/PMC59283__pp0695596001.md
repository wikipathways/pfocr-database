caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathways of AsA in higher plants. Reactions and intermediates
  of the inversion pathway via d-GalUA and the osone pathway, for which there is no
  strong supporting evidence, are shown with dashed lines and italics, respectively.
  The other intermediates constitute the recently proposed biosynthetic pathway via
  d-Man and l-Gal (). 1, Hexose phosphate isomerase; 2, phosphomannose isomerase;
  3, phosphomannose mutase; 4, GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase; 5, GDP-Man-3,5-epimerase;
  6, l-Gal dehydrogenase; 7, l-sorbosone dehydrogenase; and 8, l-GAL dehydrogenase.
  d-Glucosone could also be incorporated into AsA after reduction to Fru or Man.
