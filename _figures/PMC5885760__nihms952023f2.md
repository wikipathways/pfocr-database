caption: Postprandial delivery of choline, phosphatidylcholine (PC), carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine,
  and likely other methylamine-containing source nutrient gut microbes provides substrate
  for the gut-microbial-mediated production of trimethylamine (TMA). Microbial TMA
  lyase enzymes (CutC/D, CntA/B, and YeaW/X) can then generate TMA, which enters the
  portal circulation and is ultimately delivered to the host liver. The host flavin-containing
  monooxygenase (FMO) family of enzymes, especially FMO3, can then convert TMA to
  TMAO. TMAO can then promote atherosclerosis, thrombosis, heart failure, insulin
  resistance, and kidney disease via tissue or cell type-specific reprogramming. Through
  an unknown receptor-mediated sensing mechanism (indicated as TMAO sensor), TMAO
  drives cell-specific signaling events that promote CVD pathogenesis. In platelets,
  TMAO rapidly enhances stimulus-induced calcium (Ca2+) release, which signals to
  drive pro-thrombotic programmes. In endothelial and smooth muscle cells TMAO rapidly
  activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)
  to promote the expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM and E-selectin. In
  addition, TMAO can signal through currently unidentified pathways to regulate increased
  macrophage foam cell formation. TMAO can also initiate profibrotic programmes in
  the heart and kidney via a transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) – phospho-SMAD3 signaling
  axis. Collectively, these cellular events converge to promote atherosclerosis, thrombotic
  vascular disease, and associated renal impairment.
