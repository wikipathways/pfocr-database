caption: A diagramatics representation of the estrogen signal transduction pathway.
  The ligand estrogen receptor (either alpha or beta) (ER) complex is modulated in
  its actions by coactivators (CoA) or the unoccupied receptor is neutralized by corepressors
  (CoR). Overall the pathway can be further modified by phosphorylation of the ER
  or modulator molecules via growth factor receptor signaling pathways at the cell
  membrane (and membrane bound ER). These phosphorylation pathways are enhanced in
  antihormone resistance to allow the ER to promote unregulated gene activation through
  genomic and tethered mechanisms. This aids survival by preventing cancer cell apoptosis.
