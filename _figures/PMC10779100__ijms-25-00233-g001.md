caption: Proposed mechanism of regulation of osteoclast formation by MERTK and TYRO3.
  (a) CD14+CD16− monocytes with increased TYRO3 expression are the main source of
  osteoclast precursors. GAS6 induces TYRO3 phosphorylation and ERK signaling, promoting
  osteoclast differentiation. Activation of TYRO3 increases bone resorptive activity
  of osteoclasts. (b) MERTK induces RHOA signaling in osteoclast precursor cells leading
  to enhanced osteoclast differentiation and migration. Rounded arrows indicate differentiation
  steps in osteoclastogenesis. Straight horizontal arrows indicate TAM receptor signaling
  pathway leading to different biological functions in osteoclastogenesis. Straight
  vertical arrows show upregulation of indicated biological functions. The role of
  MERTK in osteoclastic bone resorption is unknown (?). Created with BioRender.com
