caption: In the insulin signalling pathway, insulin attaches to insulin receptors
  triggering its dimerization and the intracellular autophosphorylation of their tyrosine
  residues, which constitute an attachment for IRS proteins. These molecules also
  undergo phosphorylation and form a complex with PI3K utilizing SH2 domains. PI3K
  phosphorylates PIP2, which results in the formation of PIP3 and activation of PDK1/2.
  AKT is then phosphorylated and activated by PDK1/2, subsequently eliciting phosphorylation
  of AS160. The latter is responsible for GLUT4 translocation to the cellular membrane
  as well as glucose inflow. Nutrient overload, inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress contribute to the pathological generation of ROS in obesity and T2DM.
  The mitochondria are a primary source of oxygen (O2-), which is dismutated into
  hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in the mitochondrial intermembrane
  space and SOD2 in the mitochondrial matrix. H2O2 diffuses across the membranes to
  promote the activation of Ser/Thr protein kinases such as PKC, MAPKs, JNK, and p38
  (activation of which may be partly mediated by oxidation and inactivation of MAPK
  phosphatases (MKPs)), which phosphorylate IRS-1/2 to inhibit the association of
  IRS-1/2 with the IR, thus promoting IRS-1/2 degradation and suppressing the recruitment
  and activation of PI3K. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF promote mitochondrial
  ROS generation and activate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase
  (NOX) enzymes on the plasma membrane to contribute to the development of insulin
  resistance.
