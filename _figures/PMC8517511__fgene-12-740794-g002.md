caption: CBX7 interacts with proteins in the nucleus, transcriptionally controls the
  synthesis of related proteins, and regulates different signaling pathways. (A) CBX7
  enhances the expression of Wnt antagonist DKK-1 by interacting with other molecules
  in epigenetics, leading to the blockage of downstream signal transduction of Wnt
  pathway, and then the expression of C-MYC and Cyclin D are restricted to maintain
  normal cell proliferation. But CBX7 inhibits the expression of sFRP4, which is also
  a Wnt antagonist.(B) On the one hand, CBX7 directly inhibits CTGF expression epigenetically;
  on the other hand, CBX7 antagonizes YAP/TAZ to indirectly restrict CTGF expression,
  which inhibits cell invasion and migration. (C) CBX7 cooperates with HDAC2 to promote
  the synthesis of E-cadherin in transcription to maintain cell fixed structure. (D)
  CBX7 relies on PRC1, and cooperates with PRC2 to epigenetically inhibit the expression
  of INK4a/ARF, making cell proliferation out of control.
