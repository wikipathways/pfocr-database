caption: Crosstalk relationships between signaling pathways. The TGF-β signaling pathway
  is activated by cytokines, growth factors, or mechanical stress, regulating various
  cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis,
  and ECM synthesis. The PI3K/AKT pathway is initiated by the binding of cytokines
  and growth factors to RTKs and is related to the formation of the epidermal barrier,
  collagen synthesis, and angiogenesis. The typical pathway of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway closely related to wounds is activated by stimuli such as cytokine receptors,
  TNFR, PRRs, TCR, and BCR, which improve the inflammatory microenvironment of wounds
  and regulate the immune system through their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.
  The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is activated by the binding of cytokines and growth
  factors to their specific receptors, the phosphorylation of JAKs and STATs, and
  is involved in regulating inflammation, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and migration,
  and ECM formation. The four key pathways interact with each other and work together
  at various stages of wound healing
