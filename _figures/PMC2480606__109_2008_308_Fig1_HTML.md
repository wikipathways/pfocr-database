caption: 'An outline of major signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation. The
  best characterized NF-κB activators include TCR signaling, TNF, TLR, LTβR, and INF-γR
  signaling. Activation of TNF receptor results in its trimerization and recruitment
  of the adaptor protein TRADD, which, in turn, interacts with TRAF2. Consequently,
  RIP and MEKK3 link TNF signaling to IKK activation. LPS binding to TLRs activates
  an intracellular signaling cascade that involves recruitment of MYD88 and IRAK,
  phosphorylation of TRAF6, which then signals through the TAB2–TAK1–TAB1 complex
  to activate the IKK complex. In peripheral T cells, T cell stimulation results in
  PKCθ activation, which signals via the CARMA1–BCL-10–MALT1 complex to activate the
  IKK complex. INF-γR1 can recruit MyD88, and through MLK3 activates p38. Convergence
  point for most of the above cascades is the activated IκB kinase (IKK) complex,
  which consists of three subunits: IKK1, IKK2, and NEMO. Upon IKK activation, IκBα
  is phosphorylated and degraded through the ubiquitination pathway, rendering NF-κB
  free to translocate to the nucleus and bind to its target genes (canonical pathway).
  In other cases, IKK stimulation leads to p105/p50 activation and subsequent binding
  of Bcl3 to the p50/p50 homodimers. The p50/p50-Bcl3 complex translocates to the
  nucleus and induces NF-κB dependent transcription. Some activators such as BAFF
  or LPS can activate the non-canonical pathway. Here, activation of NF-κB-inducing
  kinase (NIK) results in homodimerization of IKK1, which then phosphorylates the
  p100 NF-κB subunit, inducing its proteolytic processing to p52. Besides their NF-κB-dependent
  effects, more functions independent of the NF-κB pathway have been described for
  IKKs. IKK1 can phosphorylate histone H3, through interaction with the transcriptional
  co-activator CBP. NEMO has also the ability to translocate to the nucleus following
  DNA damage. Nuclear NEMO is sumoylated and then ubiquitinated, in a process that
  depends on ATM kinase. Then, NEMO together with ATM translocate to the cytoplasm
