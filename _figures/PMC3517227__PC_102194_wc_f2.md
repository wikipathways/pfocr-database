caption: Cytokinin, Auxin, and Mechanical Forces Provide Inputs That the Cell Responds
  to by Regulating a Range of Cellular Processes That Affect Growth.Auxin-induced
  pathways are indicated by magenta arrows, cytokinin-induced pathways are indicated
  by green arrows, and pathways induced by changes in the mechanical forces experienced
  by the cell are indicated by blue arrows. Black arrows indicate pathways that may
  be induced by more than one input. Note that many processes can be regulated by
  more than one pathway and that some pathways feedback in such a way as to change
  the input, for example, auxin concentration in the cell wall leads to changes in
  auxin transport and therefore affects auxin concentration. It is also important
  to note that growth of the cell, and those around it, will affect both mechanical
  forces and hormone gradients. Therefore, the system must not only be considered
  over multiple levels of organization but also as a dynamic system over time.
