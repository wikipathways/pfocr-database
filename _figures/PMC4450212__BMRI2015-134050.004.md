caption: 'Significant signaling pathway networks mined from phosphotyrosine-containing
  proteins in a glioblastoma tissue. Significant signaling pathway networks that are
  involved in human glioblastoma phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and that function
  in (a) cancer, organismal injury and abnormalities, reproductive system disease,
  and developmental disorder (merged Networks 1 and 3 in the Supplemental Table 3)
  and (b) cell morphology, cellular assembly and organization, cellular function,
  and maintenance (Network 2). A black solid edge denotes a direct relationship between
  two nodes (molecules: proteins; genes). A black unsolid edge denotes an indirect
  relationship between two nodes (molecules: proteins; genes). The various shapes
  of nodes denote the different functions. A curved line means intracellular translocation;
  a curved arrow means extracellular translocation.'
