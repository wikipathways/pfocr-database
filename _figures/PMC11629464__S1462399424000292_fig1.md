caption: Schematic representation of miRNA regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in
  Mtb-infected macrophage. MiR-155 and miR-223 are potential regulators of apoptosis
  and autophagy in M. tuberculosis. During Mtb infection, acyl carrier protein (AcpM;
  Rv2244) of Mtb promotes the expression of miR-155, which targets SH2 domain-containing
  inositol 5-phosphatase-1 (SHIP1) to activate the Akt1/mTOR pathway. The activated
  Akt1/mTOR signalling pathway inhibits the nuclear translocation of transcription
  factor EB (TFEB) and reduces the expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes, which
  is likely to induce antimicrobial defence and improves intracellular mycobacterial
  survival by inhibiting phagosome–lysosome fusion in macrophages (Ref. 133). MiR-155
  can abolish expression of SHIP1, leading to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3 K) signalling-mediated inhibition of pro-apoptotic factors including Bad, FOXO-1
  and FOXO-3. In addition, miR-155 and miR-223 can also directly target and suppress
  the expression of FOXO-3 which is not able to induce a variety of apoptotic stimuli
  and reducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which in turn inhibits
  a series of downstream biochemical reactions, mediates caspase inactivation and
  downregulate the apoptotic process (Ref. 134). MiR-155 is induced by TLR activation
  which inhibits suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) and activate signal transducer
  and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) to induce the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α (Refs 16, 135). miR-155 and miR-223 also
  inhibit IL-6 expression which in turn inhibits IFN-γ inducted autophagy in M. tuberculosis-infected
  macrophages (Refs 136, 137). MiR-155 also inhibits TAB2 which can abrogate the activation
  of NFκB to induce the activation of autophagy-related genes. Inhibition of TAB2
  y miR-155 also leads to the suppression of JNK pathway-related proteins to regulate
  innate immune responses in macrophages (Refs 16, 137). MiR-155 also targets Ras
  homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) and mediates the positive regulation of autophagy
  during Mtb infection (Ref. 63). Adapted from references (Refs 16, 63, 133, 134,
  135, 136, 137)
