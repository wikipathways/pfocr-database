caption: 'Summary of enriched genes and acquisition of drug resistance of cancer cells
  during bTME+ co‐culture. a) Cytoscape network map. Each node or circle represents
  a specific pathway that is enriched in either BM‐NSCLC, Astrocytes, or bECs. Red
  color indicates enrichment of the corresponding pathway and the node is divided
  into 3 separate segments, each segment reflecting activation of the pathway in BM‐NSCLCs,
  Astrocytes, or bECs. The size of the node reflects the number of genes that constitute
  each pathway, meaning that bigger nodes are comprised more genes compared to the
  smaller nodes. Last, two or more nodes are connected by an edge or a line if they
  share at least one gene in common. b) cellular responses to drug treatment and bTME.
  Black‐dashed lines indicate cellular pathways related to targeted drugs; red‐dashed
  lines indicate up‐regulated pathways induced by cytokines from bTME. The tables
  summarize drug screening results representing gene‐based prediction and cell‐based
  testing results in the microfluidic chip (G: gene‐based prediction, C: drug screening
  result without bTME, bTME: drug screening results with bTME. S: sensitive response,
  U: unknown, R: resistive response, red box: BM‐ADC, blue box: BM‐SqCC). Green arrows
  and characters mean increased cytokines and chemokines in bTME+. Red arrows and
  characters indicate increased genesets in bTME+.'
