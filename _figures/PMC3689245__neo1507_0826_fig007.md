caption: 'Proposed mechanism for MTX-induced melanosome transport in melanoma. PP2A
  is a trimeric serine/threonine phosphatase that contains the regulatory subunit
  B, which is recruited by a C-A dimer composed of the catalytic subunit C (PP2AC)
  and structural subunit A. Recruitment occurs when C is carboxyl-methylated on the
  terminal Leu309, resulting in the assembly of the active PP2A trimer. Reversible
  PP2A methylation is catalyzed by two conserved PP2A-specific enzymes: leucine carboxyl
  methyltransferase (LCMT-1) and PP2A methylesterase (PME-1). Because LCMT1 is a specific
  S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, the treatment of melanoma
  cells with MTX may result in the inhibition of the PP2A assembly. The left branch,
  corresponding with KIF3 activation, is hypothetical and inspired by the insulin-stimulated
  GLUT4 vesicle translocation process. If an atypical PKC does activate KIF3 in melanoma,
  UCN-01 treatment would result in the disruption of MTX-stimulated microtubule and
  actin-dependent melanosome transport because PDK1 is positioned upstream of the
  Akt and PKC pathways []. Green arrows represent MTX-activated pathways, whereas
  red lines indicate the site of action for the assayed drugs UCN-01 and IAKT.'
