caption: 'Proposed model of ClaPMR2 mediated resistance signaling in watermelon in
  response to P. xanthii. During the infection process, the plant pathogenic fungi,
  P. xanthii develop highly specialized structures known as haustoria to secrete specific
  effector molecules. These effectors are recognized by the sophisticated plant specific
  intracellular immune receptors (NBS-LRRs, ClaPMR2) to activate the ETI mediated
  plant defense response by activating shikimate pathway to produce elevated levels
  of melatonin (MEL) and salicylic acid (SA) in chloroplast. The increased SA levels
  further potentiate downstream signaling by triggering nuclear gene expressions of
  various pathogenesis-related (PR1, PR5) and other defense related genes providing
  resistance to pathogen. During host–pathogen interaction the pathogenic fungi can
  alters expression of diverse defense related genes from initial germination of conidia
  to hyphal development and proliferation during the 8-day time period activating
  diverse intra- and extra-cellular resistance proteins downstream to ClaPMR2 MEL
  (M): melatonin; ETI: effector triggered immunity; TFs: transcription factors; MAPKKK:
  map kinase kinase kinase; MAPKK: map kinase kinase; MAPKKK: map kinase; NBS-LRR:
  nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat.'
