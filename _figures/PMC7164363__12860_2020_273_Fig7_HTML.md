caption: Schematic diagram of the EphB4, TNFR2 and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. A
  low concentration of TNF-α first enhances the expression of EphB4, which in turn
  promoted the expression of TNFR2. The elevated TNFR2 level leads to the activation
  of the ERK signaling pathway, which eventually enhances the osteogenic differentiation
  of MC3T3-E1 cells. TNFR2, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2; TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor-alpha; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal
  regulated kinase
papertitle: EphB4/ TNFR2/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway comprises a signaling axis to
  mediate the positive effect of TNF-α on osteogenic differentiation.
