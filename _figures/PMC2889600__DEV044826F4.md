caption: An intercellular switch that distinguishes R3 from R4. Delta/Notch signaling
  and possibly also planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling are involved in generating
  a bistable switch that distinguishes between photoreceptors R3 and R4 in the developing
  Drosophila eye imaginal disc. Notch signaling promotes bistability via intracellular
  cross-antagonism and intercellular cross-activation between Notch and its ligand
  Delta. Frizzled (Fz) signaling preferentially activates Delta in the cell nearer
  the equator, causing it to become R3 while inducing its neighbor to become R4. Heterotypic
  association of different PCP complexes across the interface between the two cells,
  together with putative intracellular cross-antagonism in the formation of the two
  complexes, may also generate bistability by exploiting the same basic principle
  used by the Delta/Notch switch. In addition to activating Delta expression, Fz serves
  as a core component of the PCP signaling pathway, although it remains unclear how
  these two functions of Fz are related. For key, see  legend.
