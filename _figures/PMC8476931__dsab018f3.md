caption: 'Comparative transcriptome analysis of genes involved in the gypenoside biosynthetic
  pathway. (A) Different plant parts of G. pentaphyllum. (B) A simplified representation
  of the gypenoside biosynthetic pathway. Gypenoside enzyme-encoding genes are divided
  into two groups—early and late. Early biosynthesis genes (EBGs) encode enzymes leading
  to 2,3-oxidosqualene production, whereas late biosynthesis genes (LBGs) encode enzymes
  leading to gypenoside production. The expression value of each gene is coloured
  in log10 (FPKM) in seven tissues: root, stem, tendril, young leaf, mature leaf,
  flower, and fruit. Low to high expression is indicated by a change in colour from
  green to red. Genes showing young leaf-specific expression are indicated in red.
  Dashed arrows indicate that the gene function needs to be verified.'
