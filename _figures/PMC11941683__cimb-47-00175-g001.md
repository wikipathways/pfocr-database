caption: '(A) Summary of healing stages following a bone fracture. MSC: mesenchymal
  stem cells. (B) Overview of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) signaling pathway
  which promotes the commitment of MSCs to osteogenic lineages. BMP binds to a pre-assembled
  receptor complex composed of BMPRI, BMPRII, and BMPRII phosphorylates (specified
  as P) BMPRI, which then induces intracellular phosphorylation of small mother against
  decapentaplegic (Smad) Smad1/5/8. Subsequently, the phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 forms
  a complex with Smad4 and enters the nucleus to regulate transcription of the target
  gene Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a key transcription factor associated
  with osteoblast differentiation. (C) Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which regulates osteoblast
  proliferation and differentiation. Activated Wnt signaling pathway: Wnt binds the
  receptor frizzled and the co-receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
  (LRP5/6) and activates the cytoplasmic protein disheveled (DVL) that induces aggregation
  of the complex (AXIN: Anti-Neurexin. GSK3β: glycogen synthase kinase-3β; CK1: casein
  kinase 1; APC: Adenomatous polyposis coli gene) and GSK3β suppression. Stabilized
  β-catenin moves into the nucleus and binds to TCF/LEF transcription factors to lead
  to the target gene transcription. Inhibited Wnt signaling pathway: without Wnt,
  the β-catenin destruction complex (AXIN, CK1α, GSK3β, and APC) is activated, and
  phosphorylated β-catenin undergoes ubiquitin proteasomal degradation. (Partially
