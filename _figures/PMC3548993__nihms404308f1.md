caption: Pathways for the biosynthesis of PtdOH in bacteria. (A) PtdOH metabolism
  in E. coli is representative of the bacteria that utilize the PlsB/PlsC acyltransferase
  pathway to PtdOH. These acyltransferases use either acyl-ACP substrates produced
  by type II fatty acid synthesis (FASII) or acyl-CoA thioesters generated by the
  activation of exogenous fatty acids by acyl-CoA synthetase (FadD). The PlsB pathway
  is largely confined to the γ-proteobacteria. (B) PtdOH metabolism in S. aureus is
  representative of bacteria that utilize the PlsX/PlsY/PlsC acyltransferase pathway
  to PtdOH. Acyl-ACP generated by FASII is either used by PlsC to acylate the 2-position
  of LPA or is converted by PlsX to acyl-PO4 for incorporation into the 1-position
  by PlsY. This is the only pathway present in most Gram-positive pathogens. In both
  schemes, the G3P backbone is produced by GpsA, but may also be obtained from the
  environment by the GlpF/GlpK pathway. Many bacteria also have a transport system
  for G3P (not shown). Exogenous fatty acids are incorporated into phospholipid following
  their ligation to ACP by acyl-ACP synthetases (AAS). PlsB, PlsC, PlsY and GlpF are
  intrinsic membrane proteins. AAS, FadD and PlsX are soluble proteins that are thought
  to interact with the membrane interface.
