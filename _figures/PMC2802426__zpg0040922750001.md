caption: Schematic model of the molecular mechanisms that regulate ionotropic glutamate
  receptor distribution during hippocampal mGluR-LTD induction and expression. Activation
  of group I mGluRs leads to dephosphorylation and activation of STEP, which transiently
  dephosphorylates tyrosine (Y) residues in GluA2-containing AMPARs at the PSD. This
  may trigger lateral diffusion of AMPARs to extrasynaptic endocytic zones from which
  internalization occurs. It is likely that upon internalization, AMPARs are rephosphorylated
  by PTKs and retained at intracellular compartments until recycled or degraded. In
  parallel to STEP activation, group I mGluR activation can stimulate ERK1/2 and p38
  MAPK signaling pathways via G-protein release and activation of the small GTPase
  Rap. ERK1/2 activation could stimulate calpain proteolysis of NMDAR and AMPAR subunit
  C-termini, which facilitates loss of synaptic receptors. Protease involvement is
  also exemplified by TACE, which cleaves NPR and allows it to cluster with AMPARs
  and other NPs in endocytic vesicles. Activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway
  stimulates the formation of the GDI-Rab5 complex, which also mediates AMPAR endocytosis.
  mGluR-LTD involves regulation of gene transcription and protein translation via
  the activation of signaling pathways such as p38 MAPK and ERK. Protein synthesis
  up-regulated includes STEP, FMRP, Arc/Arg3.1, and MAP1B, which are all involved
  in regulation of AMPAR internalization. After synthesis, FMRP is rapidly degraded
  such that it can no longer inhibit translation of specific mRNAs such as Arc/Arg3.1
  and can no longer down-regulate AMPAR endocytosis. Arc/Arg3.1 forms a complex with
  endophilin2/3 (Endo) and dynamin (Dyn), which facilitates AMPAR internalization.
  MAP1B also promotes receptor endocytosis by sequestering the scaffolding protein
  GRIP away from the PSD such that AMPAR synaptic stabilization is reduced. The dotted
  line corresponds to a postulated pathway involved in mGluR-LTD, solid arrows relate
  to confirmed molecular mechanisms that promote AMPAR internalization, and the inhibitory
  arrows refer to pathways that are down-regulating protein synthesis or receptor
  endocytosis. Figure is based on data described in  and .
