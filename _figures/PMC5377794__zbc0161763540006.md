caption: Diagrams demonstrating the processing of Okazaki fragments. The flap pathway
  and the exonuclease pathway for the removal of RNA-DNA primers from Okazaki fragments
  are shown. i, the RNase H2- and Exo1-mediated exonuclease pathway. The RNA-DNA primers
  are directly hydrolyzed by RNase H2 and Exo1. DNA pol δ catalyzes DNA synthesis
  to fill in the remaining DNA gaps generated by RNA-DNA primer removal. Finally,
  DNA ligase I (Lig I) seals the nicks, and an intact lagging strand is generated.
  ii, the long flap pathway. The RNA-DNA primers are first displaced by pol δ-mediated
  displacement DNA synthesis and subsequently generate long flap structures that are
  coated by RPA. Dna2 first comes to cleave the long flaps, which leaves a flap of
  5–7 nt. Then Fen1 cleaves the remaining short flaps to generate ligatable nicks.
  iii, the short flap pathway. The pol δ-mediated displacement DNA synthesis creates
  a short flap, and this short flap is cleaved by Fen1. Through a few cycles, the
  RNA-DNA primer is completely removed.
