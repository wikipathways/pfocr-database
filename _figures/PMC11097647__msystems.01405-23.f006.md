caption: B cell receptor signaling pathway-enriched Module_01. Host genes involved
  in the immune response of B cells, including CD19, CD22, CD79B, and PTPN6, which
  were highly expressed in the cecum, co-expressed with the K01696 (trpB). These genes
  were visualized alongside bacterial species nodes that contribute to the expression
  of the microbiome genes. K01696 (trpB) expression was contributed to by Parabacteroides
  distasonis. Edges among genes indicate an absolute Spearman’s correlation coefficient
  greater than 0.8. Edges connecting microbiome genes to bacterial species are shown
  when the contribution rate of bacterial species to microbiome gene expression exceeds
  0.2. Note that the bacterial species nodes were added after the module detection
  analysis. The thickness of the edge increases with higher contribution rates
