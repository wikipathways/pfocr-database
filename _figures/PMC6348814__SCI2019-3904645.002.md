caption: Model of ALDH1A1 regulation, potential retinoid signaling pathways, and functional
  effects of ALDH in CSCs. Retinol is oxidized to retinal by retinol dehydrogenases,
  and retinal is then oxidized to RA by ALDH1 enzymes (green dotted line). In the
  classic pathway, RA enters the nucleus and binds to dimers of RARα and RXRs triggering
  the expression of its downstream target genes including RARβ (yellow dotted line).
  In the nonclassic pathway, RA binds to dimers of RXRs and PPARβ/δ to induce the
  expression of its downstream target genes including Akt (orange dotted line). In
  cells expressing ERα, RA can bind to dimers of RXRs and ERα (not shown). RA can
  also bind with RARα outside the nucleus to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. Wnt pathway
  regulates ALDH1A1 through β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription. MUC1-C induces
  ERK signaling and phosphorylates C/EBPβ. The complex of MUC1-C and C/EBPβ occupies
  the sequence upstream from the transcription initiation site of ALDH1, triggering
  ALDH1A1 expression. TGF-β-induced Smad4 downregulates ALDH1 (red dotted line). Notch
  promotes ALDH activity in CSCs through induction of deacetylase SIRT2, leading to
  ALDH1A1 deacetylation, while ALDH1A1 acetylation by acetyltransferase PCAF inhibits
  ALDH activity (blue dotted line; some parts of this figure were adapted with modifications
  from Figures  and  from Xu et al. [], with editor's permission).
