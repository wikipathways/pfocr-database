caption: Examples of protein ubiquitination and their roles in ovarian cancer. (A)
  SOX6 promotes the expression of FBXO2, which functions as an E3 ligase to target
  the glycosylated SUN2 for ubiquitination-mediated degradation, thereby preventing
  cell apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation. (B) FBXO6-mediated RNASET2 ubiquitination
  and degradation facilitate the development of OC. (C) FBXO16-mediated hnRNPL ubiquitination
  and degradation inhibit multiple oncogenic signaling, thereby acting as a tumor
  suppressor in OC. (D) SMURF1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ARHGAP26
  contribute to the progression of OC via the β-catenin pathway. (E) CUL3-mediated
  ubiquitination and degradation of BECN1 inhibit autophagic flux and subsequently
  lead to OC progression. (F) TRPM7 knockdown modulates glucose metabolic reprogramming
  to inhibit the OC growth by enhancing AMPK activation to promote HIF-1α degradation.
  (G) The deubiquitinase PSMD14 removes the K63-linked ubiquitin chains from PKM2,
  downregulates the ratio of PKM2 tetramers to dimers and monomers, and subsequently
  reduces pyruvate kinase activity and induces nuclear translocation of PKM2, contributing
  to glycolysis and oncogene expression
