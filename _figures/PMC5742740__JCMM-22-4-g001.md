caption: The Hippo signalling pathway in Drosophila and mammals. (A) The Drosophila
  Hippo pathway. In Drosophila, when Yki is relieved from inhibition through phosphorylation‐dependent
  or phosphorylation‐independent mechanisms, its nuclear translocation then drives
  target gene expression to regulate cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The phosphorylation
  mechanism depends on the core kinase cascade including Hpo, Wts, Sav and Mats. (B)
  The mammalian Hippo pathway. In mammals, YAP1 and TAZ localize to the nucleus to
  interact with TEAD, driving target gene expression to regulate cellular proliferation
  and apoptosis. After phosphorylation, MST1/2 in turn phosphorylates LATS1/2, facilitated
  by scaffold proteins SAV1 and MOB1. MOB1 also phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2.
  Activated LATS1/2 phosphorylate YAP1 and TAZ. YAP1 interacts with Mask1/2 to form
  complex.
