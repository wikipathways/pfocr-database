caption: 'Schematic diagram to represent molecular pathways, elucidating the beneficial
  effects of CAPE in AD. CAPE is known to accord benefits in the pathophysiology of
  AD through diverse mechanisms. It directly activates the PI3/Akt signaling pathway
  as well as leads to increased phosphorylation of GSK-3β to yield it inactive. It
  results in reduced hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein besides causing increased
  activation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, this Nrf2 regulates the
  translation of several proteins like HO-1, which helps in the restoration of oxidative
  stress imbalance and activation of eNOS. These events in totality help to prevent
  neuronal death in AD. AD: Alzheimer’s disease, PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase,
  Akt: Protein kinase B, GSK3β: Glycogen synthase kinase 3β, Nrf-2: Nuclear factor
  erythroid 2-related factor 2, eNOS: Endothelial nitric oxide synthase, SOD: Superoxide
  dismutase, GSH: Glutathione, MDA: Malondialdehyde, HO: Heme oxygenase. (A higher
  resolution / colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of
