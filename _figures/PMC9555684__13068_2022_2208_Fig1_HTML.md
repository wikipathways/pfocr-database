caption: Metabolic rewiring for high-level production of squalene in yeast. Schematic
  illustration of metabolic engineering strategies for squalene production from glucose,
  which include (i) optimizing the key rate-limiting enzyme expression by multiple
  integration (green box), (ii) controlling the competitive ergosterol biosynthesis
  pathway using the N-degron-dependent protein degradation system (gray box), and
  (iii) enhancing the availability of the precursor acetyl-CoA via the metabolic recycling
  of the surplus energy of LDs (yellow box). Specified pathways related to squalene
  biosynthesis are highlighted in different colored boxes (top), and corresponding
  metabolic engineering strategies are shown in boxes with the same color code (bottom).
