caption: Schematic model of possible signalling events involved in the upregulation
  of TGF-β1 expression by LTBP-2. LTBP-2 binds to an unidentified receptor (perhaps
  complexed with αVβ3 integrin and enhanced by binding to cell surface heparan sulphate
  proteoglycans (HSPGs)) and induces the phosphorylation of Akt and p38β MAPK pathways.
  The inhibition of either pathway inhibits TGF-β1 expression and secretion. The precise
  mechanisms remain to be elucidated, but in other systems blocking p38 MAPK has been
  shown to inhibit TGFB1 gene transcription and blocking Akt pathways can inhibit
  TGF-β1 transcription and/or translation. Arrows indicate positive (stimulatory)
  effects. The inhibitors used to specifically block respective signalling molecules
  are also depicted.
