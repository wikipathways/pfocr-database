caption: Regulation of cAMP signalling pathway on the MonAzPs biosynthesis in engineered
  M. purpureus HJ11. The concentration of cAMP was negatively regulated by MrPDE.
  PKA, which was activated by cAMP, modulated the expression of MonAzPs biosynthetic
  gene cluster indirectly. The enzymes from cluster produced MonAzPs. cAMP, cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; CA, adenylate cyclase
