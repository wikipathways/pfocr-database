caption: 'Overview of pyroptosis. Pyroptotic priming signals are usually triggered
  by endogenous cytokines and activate the NF-κB signaling pathway to induce the transcription
  of inactive NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. Activation signals are triggered by the stimulation
  of DAMPs or PAMPs, stimulating NLRP3 oligomerization to recruit ASC and pro-caspase-1
  and then form the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activated caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD to release
  the N-terminal domain and form the plasma membrane pore, leading to pyroptosis.
  Activated caspase-1 promotes the maturation and secretion of IL-1β. In addition,
  LPS binds to pro-caspase-4/5/11 to activate it, inducing pyroptosis via cleavage
  of GSDMD and formation of pores. Activated caspase-4/5/11 can also induce K+ efflux
  and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Abbreviations: ASC, apoptosis speck-like protein;
  DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; GSDMD, gasdermin D; IKKα/β, IkB kinase
  α/β; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PAMPs, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns; TAK1, beta-activated kinase 1; TLR, toll-like receptor.'
