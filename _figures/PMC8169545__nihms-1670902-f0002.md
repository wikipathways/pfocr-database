caption: 'TREM-2 pathway: TREM-2 interacts with one of its ligands by extracellular
  binding domain, and signal is propagated by DAP10 and DAP12, that activates PI3K
  and Syk, respectively. Splitting of TREM-2 from its stalk region by ADAMs results
  in the production of sTREM-2 which further inhibits TREM-2 signaling. Various possible
  approaches to target TREM-2 are also shown.'
