caption: 'IL-1 family cytokines regulate NK-cell responses. The combined stimulation
  of IL-12 stimulated NK cell with: (A) IL-33 mediates the activation of p38 pathway
  which resulted in enhanced IFN-γ and TNF-α expression. (B) In contrast, IL-37 was
  shown to inhibit p38 MAPK signaling pathway which resulted in reduced IFN-γ expression.'
