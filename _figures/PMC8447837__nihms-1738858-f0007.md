caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of 2. Based on the reported proposed biosynthetic
  pathway of other 2-pyridone alkaloids such as leporins and ilicicolin H (3) (see
  ), we proposed the biosynthetic pathway of 2. FinD (PKS-NRPS) and the partnering
  FinC (ER) form the tetramic acid intermediate. A P450 FinE catalyzes the oxidative
  ring-expansion reaction of the tetramic acid to the 2-pyridone compound. Then, a
  Diels-Alderase likely catalyze the Diels-Alder reaction to form the energetically
  disfavored cis-decalin ring, since the previous study showed that nonenzymatic Diels-Alder
  reaction of the analog of 2-pyridone compound in water only led to formation of
  the trans-decalin compound. Further redox modification by FinA, FinE, and FinH forms
  2.
