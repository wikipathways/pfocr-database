caption: 'Simplified divergence of sterol biosynthesis and metabolism in mammals,
  plants, and other eukaryotes (left) versus nematodes (right). De novo synthesis
  of cholesterol (cholest-5-en-3β-ol) from acetyl-CoA through the mevalonate pathway
  proceeds via several isoprenoid and sterol intermediates [left; reviewed in ()].
  In this conventional pathway, lophenol (4α-methyl-cholest-7-en-3β-ol) is converted
  to cholesterol by enzymes a to e. Sterol-C24-methyltransferases (SMTs) when active
  in this pathway allow the production of 24-alkyl-sterols such as campesterol, bearing
  a 24-methyl side chain (highlighted in green). Pathway end-products are the precursors
  of bioactive oxygenated derivatives; e.g., 25-hydroxycholesterol produced from cholesterol,
  or castasterone, a brassinosteroid plant hormone derived from campesterol. a, sterol
  4-methyl oxidase; b, 4-carboxysterol decarboxylase; c, sterone-∆3-reductase; d,
  sterol-∆5-desaturase; e, sterol-∆7-reductase. Alternatively (right), in nematodes
  such as C.elegans, lophenol is synthesized from dietary cholesterol in their environment
  [see ()]. Successive putative or demonstrated enzymes are: e’, cholesterol-∆7-dehydrogenase
  (DAF36); d’, sterol dehydrogenase (DHS16); c’, sterol-∆4-reductase; b’, sterol-4-methyltransferase
  or 4-SMT; a’, sterone-∆3-reductase. The 3-oxo-sterol substrate of the 4-SMT is also
  a precursor of a dafachronic acid (∆7-DAF). 25-OH, 25-hydroxycholesterol. C4 of
  the sterol nucleus is indicated by the red 4.'
