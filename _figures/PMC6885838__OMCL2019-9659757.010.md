caption: Schematic diagram of the effects of hydrostatin-SN10 on the JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  pathway. Hydrostatin-SN10 exerts its anti-inflammation and antioxidant properties
  via IL-6-induced JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. IL-6 binds to the IL-6 receptor on
  the cell membrane. The complex of IL-6 and IL-6R interacts the JAK2 and activates
  transcription factors of the signal transducers and activators of STAT3 and initiates
  JAK2/STAT2 signaling. STAT3 is phosphorylated and then forms dimers with other STAT.
  The activated STAT3 complex will then enter into the nucleus initiating or inhibiting
  transcription of its regulating genes (including inflammatory cytokines, oxidative
  stress, and apoptosis factors), resulting in the changes of cell apoptosis.
