caption: A new working model. LPS can induce inflammatory response in endothelial
  cells by engaging Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and activating the MAPK-AP-1 and NF-κB
  pathways. IL-35 is induced by LPS presumably in regulatory T cells, B cells, and
  dendritic cells at the same time, which suppresses LPS-induced endothelial cell
  activation by inhibiting expressions of VCAM-1 in endothelial cells, proinflammatory
  cytokines, and chemokines in plasma and monocyte adhesion to endothelium, thereby
  controlling inflammation scale in sepsis. In IL-35 subunit EBI3 gene-deficient (EBI3−/−)
  mice, endogenous IL-35 could not be induced by LPS, but exogenous IL-35 could still
  suppress LPS-induced inflammatory response in endothelial cells because of intact
  and functional IL-35 receptors and its signaling pathway(s) in EBI3−/− mice.
