caption: Route finding and retrosynthesis ‘Getting directions’ between the metabolites
  l-Phenylalanine and Homovanillate using E. coli K12 substr. MG1655 as the host organism.
  Both endogenous (white) and exogenous reactions (colored) are shown, including the
  species names for the source of candidate genes for the transgenic steps in the
  pathway.
