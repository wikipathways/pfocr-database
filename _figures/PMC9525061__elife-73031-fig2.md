caption: Compartments are indicated by grey boxes. Smaller molecules are indicated
  by circles, proteins by rectangles. Potential sites for protein modifications are
  indicated by the small circles on the boundaries of the rectangles. Reactions, including
  substrates and products, are indicated by the arrows, with the reaction numbers
  noted in the small box. Reactions, which are required for the model to return to
  the initial state, are drawn in grey. A bar at the bottom of the circle or rectangle
  indicates that this entity appears more than once in the scheme.
