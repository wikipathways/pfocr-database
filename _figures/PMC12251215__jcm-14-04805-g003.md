caption: In esophageal and gastric cancers (EC and GC, respectively), circRNAs modulate
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling through various mechanisms. CircRNAs act as sponges for
  miRNAs. They also interact with RNA-binding proteins and engage in other regulatory
  processes to upregulate Wnt pathway components including SRXN1, SOX4, FZD3, and
  WNT7A. This enhances β-catenin stabilization and nuclear translocation, promoting
  malignant phenotypes such as proliferation, migration, invasion, chemoresistance,
  and acquisition of stem-like properties. Conversely, tumor-suppressive circRNAs,
  such as circITCH, function as molecular sponges for miR-7, miR-17, and miR-214 and
  increase the expression of ITCH, which results in the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling and constrains tumor progression
