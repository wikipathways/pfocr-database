caption: This figure highlights previously established ILK signaling partners and
  emphasizes data from the current study. In quiescent cells, integrins likely have
  low affinity for extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules (i.e. such as collagen I,
  fibronectin, etc.. - which are in low abundance) and are therefore in a low affinity
  or inactive confirmation. Thus, ILK is relatively inactive. In addition, the Gα12/13
  pathway is inactive (delineated by dotted lines). Upon ligand binding (i.e., collagen
  I, fibronectin, etc), the confirmation of the integrin changes and ILK binds to
  the cytoplasmic tail of β-integrin, resulting in formation of PINCH-ILK-parvin ternary
  complexes. ILK subsequently recruits other signaling molecules. In stellate cells,
  ILK is engaged in G-protein receptor signaling cross talk, where it appears to amplify
  Gα12/13 mediated signals. Activation of this ILK/Gα12/13 signaling pathway has several
  functional consequences, including in actin reorganization (and actin synthesis),
  cell spreading, cell migration, and extracellular matrix synthesis. The pathways
  leading to synthesis of ECM are likely to be multiple, and likely include both ILK
  direct pathways, as well as those that cross talk through the Gα12/13 and the Rho
  pathway. The activated stellate cell cartoon is meant to depict these both.
