caption: The ATR signaling pathway is involved in the HPV life cycle. HPV phosphorylates
  STAT-5 in the absence of exogenous DNA damage agents to increase TopBP1 levels,
  which activate the ATR signaling pathway. HPV also phosphorylates TopBP1 to regulate
  E2F1 transcriptional activities, which is important for HPV replication. ATR activation
  is necessary for HPV genomes replication through various mechanisms. The ATR/CHK1
  DDR can regulate cell cycle arrest through E2F1 in HPV-positive cells. ATR possibly
  modulates immune response by GATA4-driven inflammation. ATR is also suggested to
  be responsible for induction of autophagy, which correlates with the GATA4 signaling
  via autophagy cargo protein p62. The ATR/CHK1 pathway can act with RRM2 to promote
  HPV DNA synthesis. The solid arrow means positive regulation, whereas the blocking
  arrow signifies inhibition. The dotted line represents that the role of the pathway
  remains uncertain.
