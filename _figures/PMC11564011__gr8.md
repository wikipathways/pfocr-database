caption: Mechanism of action of IMM2520. The binding of IMM2520 to PD-L1 on the surfaces
  of tumor cells inhibits the signaling pathway of PD-1/PD-L1, thereby enhancing T-cell
  activation and cytokine secretion. Additionally, IMM2520 induces tumor cell death
  through the Fc-dependent effect function (antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent
  phagocytosis) of PD-L1 antibody. Simultaneously, IMM2520 disrupts the interaction
  of CD47/SIRPα on macrophages, triggering an "eat me" signal that further activates
  macrophage immune responses and elicits a comprehensive immune reaction
