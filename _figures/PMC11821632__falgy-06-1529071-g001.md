caption: Canonical and non-canonical TGF-β signalling pathways. TGF-β is secreted
  in a latent, inactive form and activated in an integrin-dependent manner. Active
  TGF-β binds to TGF-β type II receptors (TGFBRII), which are transmembrane receptors
  with serine/threonine kinase activity. TGF-β-TβRII interactions lead to the recruitment
  and phosphorylation of TGF-β type I receptors (TGFBRI). In the canonical signalling
  pathway, upon activation, TβRIs phosphorylate SMAD2 and SMAD3, which then assemble
  into heterodimers and trimers with SMAD4. Complete SMAD protein complexes translocate
  to the nucleus, interact with transcription factors and influence the expression
  of TGF-β target genes. SMAD7 inhibits TGFBRII, acting as a regulatory factor in
  the signalling pathway. In the non-canonical signalling pathway, phosphorylated
  TGFBRII instead activates one of several alternative pathways, including the ERK,
  JNK, p38 and PI3K-Akt pathways. P, phosphorylation; TF, transcription factor; EMT,
  epithelial to mesenchymal transition
