caption: 'The simplified schema graph of potential mechanisms through which RIC influences
  CBF. The hypoxia induced by RIC upregulates the VEGF production, which activates
  VEGFR. Then, Dll-4 expression is induced and NCID is proteolytically cleaved to
  liberate an adjacent endothelial cell. NICD enters the nucleus and activates the
  transcription of Notch-responsive genes. The interaction between VEGF and the Notch
  signaling pathway plays a crucial role in angiogenesis. RIC can also induce the
  formation of three main gas molecules: NO, CO, and H2S. They can improve CBF by
  relaxing smooth muscle cells. RIC can also improve CBF by protecting cardiac function
  and NVU.Abbreviations: CAT, cysteine aminotransferase; CBF, cerebral blood flow;
  CO, carbon monoxide; Dll-4, Delta-like 4; EC, endothelial cell; eNOS, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase; H2S, hydrogen sulfide; HO, heme oxygenase; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion;
  3MST, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase; NCID, Notch intracellular domain; NO,
  nitric oxide; NVU, neurovascular unit; RIC, remote ischemic conditioning; SMC, smooth
  muscle cell; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor.'
