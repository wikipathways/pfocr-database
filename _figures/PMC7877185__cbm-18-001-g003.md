caption: Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) and the signaling pathways involved in
  lung cancer cell invasion and migration. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  is important in the behavior of cells during cancer progression, which confers tumor
  cells with migratory and invasive properties. The TGF-β pathway plays a central
  role in inducing the EMT in all types of tumors. TGFβs specifically bind to complexes
  of TGF-βR1, TGF-βR2, and TGF-βR3, leading to the phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3,
  which then forms complexes with SMAD4. AEG-1, XIST, LIN28B, linc00673, circPTK2,
  SNHG1, and cESRP1 as ceRNAs affect the signaling/Smad-induced EMT. In addition to
  Smad-dependent pathways in TGF-β family signaling, the TGF-β also induces the non-Smad
  TGF-β signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/GSK3β, MEK-ERK, and MAPK pathways. Smad-dependent
  pathways are involved in TGF-β family signaling. FOXO1, TP73-AS1, LINC00702, DANCR,
  and circ0074027 act as ceRNAs to participate in non-Smad TGF-β signaling pathways
  in the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer.
