caption: Nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP/PKG-I signaling pathway. In response to humoral or
  mechanical stimuli (e.g., Ach or shear stress), NO is synthesized in EC from L-arginine
  by activated form of eNOS. NO diffuses to neighboring SMC, where it activates soluble
  guanylate cyclase (sGC), which subsequently increases the intracellular production
  of cGMP from GTP. cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKG-I), which
  reduces intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and activates myosin light chain phosphatase
  (MLCP) to dephosphorylate myosin light chain (M), leading to SMC vasorelaxation.
  EC-derived NO can buffer ROS and prevent oxidative stress by inhibiting NOX activation
  in EC and SMC. It may also inhibit mitochondrial KATP channel (mitoKATP) opening,
  and consequently PTP opening, thus preventing the oxidative stress caused by mitochondrial
  ROS release.
