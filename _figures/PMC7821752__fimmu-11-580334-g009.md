caption: Schematic representation of a model VP1 inhibition of TPL2-mediated IRF3/IFN-β
  signaling. FMDV VP1 interacts with TPL2 and impairs its phosphorylation at Thr290.
  IFMDV capsid protein VP1 interacted with host TPL2 and inhibited TPL2-mediated IRF3/IFN-β
  signal pathway to immune escape and facilitate virus replication.
