caption: A) Archetypical signaling pathway, a membrane receptor senses the presence
  of the signaling molecules and transmits the signal through a kinase cascade, culminating
  in a transcriptional response. B) Prion self-assembly can provide an enduring record
  of previous exposure, maintaining the response even after the signaling molecule
  is gone. C) Prion-based self-assembly can amplify a response, recruiting more signaling
  molecules and ensuring fidelity by reducing noise in the system. All figures were
