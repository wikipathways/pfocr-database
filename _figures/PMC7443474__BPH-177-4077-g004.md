caption: The TGF‐β/Smad pathway in the process of DCU healing. TGF‐β molecules bind
  to their phosphorylated homologous receptors and activate the Smad receptor protein.
  The Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) is known as Smad cofactor that binds
  to Smad2/3, under the action of kinases to promote SARA and Smad2/3 compound phosphorylation,
  later releasing phosphorylated Smad2/3 molecules and TGFβ molecules, Next, phosphorylated
  smad2/3 combines with Smad4 and enters the nucleus. There, Smad4 acts on the miR‐31
  gene and releases single‐stranded miR‐31 under the action of pri‐miR‐31. miR‐31
  then inhibits the EMP‐1 protein or regulates TGF‐β molecules to promote keratinocyte
  proliferation and migration. miRNAs and mRNA can directly regulate the expression
  of TGF‐β molecules, promote the migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts to the
  epidermis, and accelerate the formation of skin and scarring
