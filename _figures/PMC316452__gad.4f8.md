caption: 'Autonomous and nonautonomous roles for CAR4 regulation of prestalk and prespore
  differentiation. Prestalk differentiation requires the extracellular signals cAMP
  and DIF-1. Elimination of CAR4 greatly reduces expression of prestalk genes and
  disturbs prestalk cellular patterns. However, because car4− cells accumulate sufficient
  levels of cAMP and DIF-1 for prestalk differentiation, CAR4 must act autonomously
  to activate prestalk pathways. Based on other data () and by analogy with CAR4 function,
  we suggest further that CAR2 also activates an intracellular signaling pathway for
  prestalk differentiation. Extracellular cAMP both activates and inhibits prespore
  differentiation through separate surface receptors. We suggest antagonistic mechanisms
  for cAMP regulation of prespore differentiation through CAR1 and/or CAR3 and CAR4,
  both acting cell autonomously. The prestalk morphogen DIF-1 is an inhibitor of prespore
  differentiation. DMF is an extracellular factor that modulates the sensitivity of
  prespore cells to DIF-1 inhibition but does not alter the response of prestalk cells.
  Active CAR4 is required by cells for DMF accumulation, thus defining a nonautonomous
  role for CAR4 in prespore differentiation. Currently we do not know if a specific
  population of cells is involved in DMF production. Epistatic interactions: The model
  positions DMF to antagonize DIF-1 inhibition of prespore differentiation, but the
  data cannot exclude a mechanism for the direct activation of prespore differentiation.
