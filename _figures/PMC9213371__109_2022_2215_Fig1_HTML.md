caption: Simplified overview of NF-κB signaling in Treg cells. For the canonical NF-κB
  pathway (left), T cell receptor (TCR) signaling or signaling via TNF receptor family
  members (TNF, OX40, GITR) via IκB-kinase β (IKKβ) results in the nuclear translocation
  of c-Rel and RelA whereby both Foxp3 expression, regulatory elements next to the
  Foxp3 promotor (CNS0-3) and Foxp3 target gene expression, can be regulated depending
  on context and Treg cell status/subset. The non-canonical NF-κB pathway (right)
  equally activated by TNF receptor family members signal via NIK and IKKα has a less
  pronounced effect on Treg cells but crosstalk with the canonical NF-κB pathway.
  Atypical IκB members such as Bcl-3 or IκBNS regulate specific Treg cell subsets
  or certain Treg cell features either directly or via interfering with canonical
  NF-κB family members
