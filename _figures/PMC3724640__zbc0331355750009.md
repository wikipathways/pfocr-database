caption: Proposed model for Rab-mediated trafficking of RGS4 between the plasma membrane
  and various endosomal compartments in mammalian cells. Shown is the proposed cycle
  of intracellular trafficking of RGS4 (orange color). The cycle begins at the plasma
  membrane, where RGS4 acts as an inhibitor of M1 muscarinic receptor-mediated phospholipase
  Cβ (PLCβ) activation, inositol phosphate (IP3)/inositol phosphate receptor activation
  (IP3R) and intracellular calcium release (Ca2+). The model predicts that RGS4 is
  internalized and sorted in early endosomes (EE) in a Rab5-dependent manner, and
  then it is either recycled back to the plasma membrane or transferred to a late
  endosome (LE) pool. Trafficking from the late endosome pool may direct RGS4 to the
  trans-Golgi network (TGN) via Rab7 and other sorting proteins, where it is sorted
  via unknown mechanisms (perhaps involving compartment-specific palmitoylation on
  Cys-2 and Cys-12) before it re-enters the Rab11 recycling endosome (RE) pool for
  trafficking back to the plasma membrane. The cycle is completed when the Rab11 recycling
  pathway returns RGS4 to the plasma membrane where it may once again function as
  a G-protein inhibitor. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
