caption: The circadian molecular clock and its regulation of the VTA-NAc synapse.
  (A) Rhythms of the circadian molecular clock are generated through a complex series
  of transcriptional-translational feedback loops (TTFLs). In the mammalian core TTFL,
  CLOCK (or its functional paralogue NPAS2) forms a heterodimer with BMAL1, binds
  to E-box elements in the promoter regions of DNA, and drives the transcription of
  many clock-controlled genes (CCGs), including Period and Cryptochrome. Throughout
  the day, PERs and CRYs accumulate in the cytoplasm, dimerize, and undergo phosphorylation.
  Into the night, PER:CRY dimers shuttle back into the nucleus and inhibit their own
  transcription through repressing CLOCK/NPAS2:BMAL1 activity, thus completing the
  core TTFL which cycles approximately every 24 h. Among its CCGs, CLOCK/NPAS2:BMAL1
  also regulates the expression of the nuclear receptors RORα and Rev-erbα which form
  an ancillary TTFL of the molecular clock. RORα and REV-ERBα compete at Rev-erb/Ror
  response elements (RREs) in the promoter regions of Bmal1, Npas2, and Cry1 to regulate
  their transcription, where RORα promotes expression and REV-ERBα represses. Along
  with others, this ancillary TTFL works to sustain, stabilize, and reinforce the
  core TTFL and rhythmic output as a whole, altogether temporally controlling nearly
  all aspects of cellular physiology. Arrows and (+) indicate promotion of expression,
  while bars and (−) indicate repression of expression. (B) The ventral tegmental
  area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) circuit is the key reward pathway of the
  brain. Rewarding stimuli primarily stimulate dopamine (DA) neurons in the VTA to
  release DA into the NAc, driving medium spiny neuron (MSN) activity and subsequent
  reward-seeking behaviors. The circadian molecular clock has been shown to regulate
  nearly all components of DA synaptic transmission, with synthesis, uptake, and degradation
  all showing circadian variation in expression or activity. This includes the synthesis
  enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the DA receptors (D1R, D2R, and D3R), DA release
  itself, the dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT), and the dopamine degradation enzyme
  monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). Overall rhythms in activity, molecular clock genes,
  and transcriptome wide rhythms have been detected in the VTA and NAc, with peaks
  aligning in the active phase (dark phase in nocturnal rodents). Robust rhythms have
  been detected in NAc astrocytes, as well as rhythms in GABA, glutamate, and glutamate
  receptors (GLUR) in the NAc. Red clocks indicate observed rhythms in expression
  or activity. Green dots are DA molecules. Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2)
  loads dopamine into the vesicles prior to synaptic release. Graphs illustrate representative
  wave form of overall VTA (green) or NAc (red) rhythmicity in nocturnal rodents,
