caption: 'Schematic diagram summarizing the known possible TrkB signalling pathways
  associated with neuronal plasticity. Within neurons (dotted square), BDNF can induce
  three types of Trk B dimers to form: (1) TK+ homodimer; (2) TK ± T1 heterodimer
  and (3) T1 homodimer. The TK+ homodimer results in activation of PLCγ and PKC, which
  promote synaptic plasticity. Shc proteins activate the PI3K-Akt pathway and cell
  survival while Ras-MAPK pathway activation regulates differentiation. The function
  of the TK ± T1 heterodimer remains unknown. The T1 homodimer is important in synaptic
  transmission within neurons but a mechanism for this phenomena has not yet been
  elucidated. However, T1 is the major isoform of TrkB receptors in astrocytes (grey
  box), which induces release of Rho GDI1 and is involved in a Ca2+ influx in astrocytes.
  A TTIP (truncated TrkB-interacting protein) binds T1 but its functions are not yet
  clear. Adapted from [].'
