caption: Simplified overview of the canonical and non-canonical miRNA biogenesis pathways.
  MiRNA generated by canonical pathway is transcribed by RNA polymerase II to a primary
  transcript called pre-miRNA. Subsequently, this structure is processed into the
  nucleus by DGCR8/Drosha complex; producing the pre-miRNA, which is exported to the
  cytoplasm by exportin-5. In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNA is cleaved by RNase III endonuclease
  (Dicer protein), resulting in a double stranded miRNA, which contains the mature
  miRNA. After, double strand is separated by helicases and create the mature miRNA;
  on the contrary, in non-canonical pathways, miRNA located within of mirtrons and
  are associated with spliceosome-dependent mechanisms. After, the mature miRNA produced
  by different pathways enters into the RISC complex and regulated genes through messenger
  RNA (mRNA) degradation and mRNA translation repression.
