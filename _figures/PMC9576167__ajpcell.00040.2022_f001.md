caption: Platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI)/immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motif (ITAM) and integrin signaling and role of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK),
  Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), and Src family kinases (SFK) inhibitors. Glycoprotein
  VI (GPVI) serves as the main physiological signaling receptor for extracellular
  matrix proteins including collagen, laminin, and nidogen. GPVI is coupled to a disulfide-linked
  Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ). Activated GPVI becomes phosphorylated by Src family
  kinases (SFK), namely Lyn and Fyn, on intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  activation motifs (ITAMs). Phosphorylated ITAMs then serve as a platform to recruit
  and activate Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). Syk phosphorylates a number of substrates
  associated with the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) at the LAT signalosome,
  including Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), Tec family kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K), and phospholipase C γ2 (PLCγ2). This protein complex promotes protein kinase
  C (PKC) activation, intracellular mobilization of Ca2+, granule secretion, “inside-out”
  integrin αIIbβ3 activation, and platelet hemostatic and thrombotic responses. Activated
  integrin αIIbβ3 binds to fibrinogen, triggering “outside-in” activation of platelets
  via the LAT signalosome. Notable tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target this pathway
  include SFK inhibitors (dasatinib, PP2), Syk inhibitors (fostamatinib/R406, entospletinib,
  cevidoplenib, lanraplenib), and BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, tirabrutinib,
  zanubrutinib, fenebrutinib). FcRγ, Fc receptor γ-chain; GPCR, G protein-couple receptor;
  PP2, pyrozolopyrimidine. Created with BioRender.com and published with permission.
