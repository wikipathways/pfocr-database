caption: Schematic of ICL repair. 1 UHRF1 is recruited to ICLs through its SRA domain
  shortly after ICLs are formed in the cell. 2 Single replication fork arrives at
  the ICL. 3 FANCM/MHF complex mediates the traverse of the replication machinery
  through the ICL, which allows the replication fork to proceed, and leaves the ICL
  for later repair. 4, 5 Alternatively, BRCA1 (FANCS) facilitates the unloading of
  the CMG helicase complex when the second replication fork arrives at the ICL. 6
  The replicative polymerase proceeds to the −1 position of the ICL, which leaves
  an X-shaped structure similar to the traverse mechanism. 7 ATR phosphorylates FANCD2/FANCI
  complex at multiple sites and FA core complex monoubiquitinates FANCD2/FANCI complex
  at K561 and K523, respectively. 8 FANCD2/FANCI is recruited to the ICL at the replication
  fork. 9, 10 Ubiquitinated FANCD2/FANCI complex recruits SLX4/XPF to ICL to unhook
  the ICL. 11 CtIP and the MRN complex resect the double-strand break ends generated
  by the incision in the previous step, and BRCA2 facilitates Rad51 filament formation
  on the ssDNA generated by the resection. 12 Polζ polymerizes new strand of DNA through
  the unhooked ICL. 13 Rad51 facilitates the strand invasion, which allows extension
  of the other strand. 14 SLX4 and nucleases resolve the double Holliday junction.
