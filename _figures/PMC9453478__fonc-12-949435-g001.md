caption: The Fanconi anemia pathway detects and repairs DNA interstrand cross-links.
  (A) An ICL covalently holds together the two complementary DNA strands. ICLs arrest
  the progression of the replication fork and are recognized by FANCM and its associated
  proteins. (B) The FANCM anchor complex recruits the FA core complex to the ICL site.
  The FA core complex in turn ubiquitylates the FANCD2-I complex. (C) Ubiquitylated
  FANCD2-I complex forms a filamentous array that clamps the stalled DNA replication
  fork and protects it from nucleolytic degradation. The FANCP/SLX4 is a DNA endonucleases
  toolbox that will unhook the ICL site by cleaving the surrounding DNA. (D) After
  ICLs unhooking two DNA repair intermediates appear, a DSB that will be repaired
  by the downstream FA/BRCA proteins using HR and a DNA adduct that will be processed
  with the help of TLS DNA polymerases. (E) The DSB will initially undergo a short
  resection mediated by exonuclease activity of the MRN complex. (F) Extensive DSB
  resection will be performed by the EXO1 endonuclease, and the produced DNA overhang
  will be covered and protected by RPA1 protein subunits. (G) The HR mechanism will
  start with the exchange of RPA1 by subunits of the recombinase RAD51. This exchange
  will be assisted by homologous recombination mediators including FANC/PALB2, FANCD1/BRCA2,
  and FANCS/BRCA1. (H) RAD51-coated DNA overhangs will function as recombinase filaments
  that will search for sequence homology. (I) Strand invasion will be followed by
  sequence detection, copy and synthesis of the sequence of interest, Holliday junctions
  resolution, and ligation of the phosphate DNA backbone. DSBs, double-strand breaks;
  FA, Fanconi anemia; HR, homologous recombination; ICLs, interstrand cross-links;
  TLS, translesion synthesis.
