caption: Factors influencing VSMC apoptosis and their signal pathways.  The purple
  box shows the available factors and mechanistic pathways in the  promotion of VSMC
  apoptosis. Apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf 1) is a  forkhead box (FOXO)
  3a transcriptional target, and Apaf 1 induces VSMC apoptosis  and can be transcriptionally
  induced by apoptotic effectors such as p53. Matrix  metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13)
  is a direct transcriptional target of FOXO 3a in  VSMCs, and FOXO 3a substantially
  triggers the generation and release of MMP-13 by  VSMCs and promotes apoptosis.
  MMP-7 is involved in the cleavage of N-calmucin and  thus promotes VSMC apoptosis.
  p53 often forms complexes that possess inhibitory  functions and involve Bcl-XL
  and Bcl-2 to promote apoptosis via the mitochondrial  pathway. Mast cells release
  chymase in an autocrine manner, and chymase induces  VSMC apoptosis by blocking
  nuclear transcription factor kappa B  (NF-κB)-mediated survival signals. The pink
  box shows the multiple  factors and mechanistic pathways involved in the inhibition
  of VSMC apoptosis.  AKT1 primarily targets FOXO 3a/Apaf 1 to promote VSMC survival
  in atherosclerotic  lesions. Additionally, AKT1 regulates GSK-3 phosphorylation
  and decreases VSMC  apoptosis by means of phosphorylation and the following ubiquitin-mediated  breakdown
  of Mcl1, a member of the Bcl-2 family, within VSMCs. Insulin-like  growth factor-1
  (IGF1) works against VSMC apoptosis via AKT1. Activation of Akt  by small proline-rich
  repeat protein (SPRR3) achieves a protective effect in reducing VSMC apoptosis.
  N-Calmucin can  reduce VSMC apoptosis by mediating intercellular contacts. In response
  to PDGF-BB  stimulation, TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) mediates TAGLN  ubiquitination
  and subsequently induces elevated levels of activated  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD) that stimulates increased nicotinamide  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
  production, thereby enhancing VSMC  viability and reducing apoptosis via glutathione
  (GSH) homeostasis. Created by Figdraw
