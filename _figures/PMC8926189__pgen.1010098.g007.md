caption: In healthy flies, feeding bacteria under protein scarcity promotes bacterial
  amino-acids transfer from the gut into the hemolymph. This indirectly triggers Dilps
  secretion by neurosecretory cells of the central brain _leading to the systemic
  activation of the insulin/Tor signaling pathways and the activation of SREBP in
  adipocytes in order to sustain lipogenesis. Simultaneously, gut-born PGN diffuses
  into the hemolymph where it is degraded by the secreted amidase PGRP-LBsec. Upon
  chronic inflammation due to the lack of PGRP-LBsec and accumulation of PGN, the
  constitutive activation of the IMD signaling pathway promotes lipid depletion via
  inhibition of SREBP activation in adipocytes.
