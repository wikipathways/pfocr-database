caption: The Hh signaling pathway. When the Hh pathway is inactive, PTCH inhibits
  SMO, thereby preventing the production of active GLI (GLIA). GLI proteins are additionally
  sequestered by KIF7 and SUFU, partially degraded by E3 ubiquitin ligase, β-TrCP,
  and phosphorylated by PKA, GSK-3β, and CK1 to generate the repressor GLI (GLIR).
  The repressor GLI accumulates and inhibits Hh target gene transcription. Sonic hedgehog
  (Shh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and delta hedgehog (Dhh) are Hh ligands in mammals.
  When Hh ligands bind to PTCH and co-receptors CDO, BOC, and GAS1, SMO facilitates
  the production of GLIA, which then activates the transcription of Hh target genes.
  Ginsenoside Rg3 stably binds to PTCH, inhibiting the activation of SMO. Rh2 and
  Rg3 inhibits accumulation of GLIA
