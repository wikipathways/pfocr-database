caption: a The strategy of anti-CD44v6 therapy by blocking the interaction between
  HA and CD44v6. Furthermore, the soluble CD44v6 ectodomain is used for blocking HA
  binding, and the anti-CD44 mAb is used for blocking the HA-binding epitope on the
  CD44v6 ectodomain. In addition, the small fragment of HA (sHA) is able to inhibit
  the binding of HA to the CD44v6 ectodomain as well. b The strategy of anti-CD44v6
  therapy by blocking the proximal membrane region encoded by the variant exon 6.
  Thus, the anti-CD44v6 mAb and CD44v6-specific peptide are available. c The strategy
  of anti-CD44v6 therapy by antagonizing the Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, the
  CD44v6 expression is driven by the activation of canonical Wnt (see ref. ). Selective
  inhibition of Wnt by using small-molecule compounds potently suppresses the CD44v6
  production (see ref. ). d The strategy of anti-CD44v6 therapy by using shRNA or
  miRNA. Either miRNA or shRNA can effectively limit the CD44 gene expression, thus
  reducing the production of CD44v6 (see ref. ,)
