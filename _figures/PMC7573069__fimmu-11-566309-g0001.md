caption: 'Nanoparticles as inducers of innate immune memory. Upper part: β-glucan
  or BCG-primed monocytes (left) have an enhanced glycolytic metabolic state and an
  impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
  is fueled by metabolites derived from glutaminolysis, while pyruvate is mainly fermented
  into lactate. On the other hand, LPS-primed cells (right) preferentially use OXPHOS,
  and the glycolytic pathway generates pyruvate for fueling the TCA cycle. The epigenetic
  reprogramming occurring in β-glucan- and BCG-primed monocytes mainly encompasses
  histone methylation and acetylation and involves lncRNA, modifications that are
  lacking (or established late) in LPS-primed monocytes. NP (Au, pGr) may play a role
  in the induction and modulation of innate immune memory by regulating epigenetic
  and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells (dashed arrows). Lower part:
  BCG-primed monocytes (left) show an increased reactivity after a subsequent exposure
  to LPS. When monocytes are primed with BCG in the presence of Au NP, they show a
  reduced reactivity (right). Thus, Au NP are able to reduce the BCG-induced memory
  response in human primary monocytes by shifting the memory effect from potentiation/trained
  immunity to tolerance. By contrast, pGr (left) is able to prime directly murine
  BMDM, which responds to a subsequent LPS challenge with a potentiated reaction.'
