caption: Model for regulation of ODA activity. The CP contains appendage structures
  (dark gray) that are asymmetrically oriented within the CP apparatus. The rotation
  of the CP (black round arrow) mechanically activates signaling pathways built into
  the CP and RS structures. The signal initiated in the CP is transmitted through
  the RS (arrow) to signaling molecules at the base of the RS and on the outer doublet
  microtubules. The predicted locations of signal transduction proteins [PKA, CK1,
  protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), PP2A, and calmodulin complexes] are shown. The ODA-docking
  complex (ODA-DC) at the base of the ODA contains phosphorylated DCC1. Upon activation
  of motility, DCC1 is further phosphorylated and may regulate the activity of the
  β-and γ-HCs. Alcohol may interfere in this pathway.

  description: Model for regulation of ODA activity. The CP contains appendage structures
    (dark gray) that are asymmetrically oriented within the CP apparatus. The rotation
