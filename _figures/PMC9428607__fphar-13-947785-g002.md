caption: Schematic diagram of D1-like dopamine receptor and D2-like dopamine receptor
  activation signaling cascade. Upon activation of the dopamine D1-like receptor,
  activated PKA mediates the phosphorylation of DARPP-32, which acts as an effective
  inhibitor of PP-1, which in turn dephosphorylates another phosphatase STEP. Dopamine
  D1-like receptor activation mediates dopamine-dependent inhibitory cascades by increasing
  ERK phosphorylation by blocking the dephosphorylation of STEP. Numerous studies
  have demonstrated that modulation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway can improve
  depression. D2-like receptor activation promotes phosphorylation/activation of Akt
  and phosphorylation/inactivation of its substrate GSK-3β. The physiological significance
  of this D2 receptor-activated Akt/GSK3 signaling has been extensively discussed
  in terms of neuroprotection against oxidative stress in depression. In addition,
  numerous studies have also shown that the PI3K/Akt pathway has an integral role
  in the treatment of depression. PLC, Phospholipase C; IP3, Inositol triphosphate;
