caption: A model for chromosomal context influencing genomic stability of rDNA arrays.
  rDNA arrays on acrocentric short arms are surrounded by sequences that form perinucleolar
  heterochromatin during interphase. DJ sequences (green) are localized within this
  heterochromatin, providing an anchor for the linked rDNA array (red). Introduction
  of DSBs (yellow) into the rDNA induce ATM-dependent inhibition of rDNA transcription
  by Pol I followed by subsequent nucleolar reorganization. Positioning of rDNA within
  caps on the nucleolar surface is a consequence of anchoring by DJ sequences. We
  hypothesize that this nucleolar reorganization renders damaged rDNA accessible to
  DSB repair factors normally excluded from nucleoli. Concentration of damaged and
  intact rDNA repeats within nucleolar caps promotes repair by the HR pathway. As
  this occurs in G1 cells, HR repair may be templated by repeats in cis within the
  same NOR. See the Discussion for further details.
papertitle: A localized nucleolar DNA damage response facilitates recruitment of the
  homology-directed repair machinery independent of cell cycle stage.
