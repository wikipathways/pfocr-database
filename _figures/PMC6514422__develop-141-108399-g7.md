caption: The M/E switch pathway in normal and starvation conditions. The genetic pathway
  leading to the formation of paused MES egg chambers during starvation and its reversal
  to normal development upon refeeding. Paused MES maintenance involves the activation
  of N by Cut, their concomitant activity being established through a specific regulatory
  loop. The onset of paused MES is dependent on the loss of IIS signaling inducing
  Cut activation through FoxO. Upon refeeding, cells respond quickly by downregulating
  FoxO and Cut, thus allowing oogenesis to resume.
