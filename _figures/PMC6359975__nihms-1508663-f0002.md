caption: Multiple resistance mechanisms have been identified and validated in human
  patient samples. These include two separate NRAS mutations (Q61H/L) identified in
  a mutant BRAF melanoma patient and a PI3KCA E545K mutation found in a mutant NRAS
  melanoma patient. PDK1 expression was also increased in post-palbociclib treated
  breast cancer patient samples compared to naïve tumors. In a mouse xenograft model,
  NRAS amplification mediated MEK inhibitor plus CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance. Together,
  these resistance mechanisms led to upregulation of mTOR-S6 pathway and provided
  a therapeutic window for mTOR/S6K targeting. In pre-clinical studies, other alterations
  were identified within cell cycle components, such as CDK6 and cyclin E amplification.
  Next generation CDK inhibitors are currently in development to concurrently target
  CDK2 to combat resistance.
