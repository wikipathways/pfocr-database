caption: The schematic pathway of the SCG GABAergic signalling system involved in
  sympathetic activity and arrhythmias. SCG sympathetic neurons were positive for
  both P2X7Rs and GABAARs. GABA blocked the ATP‐induced [Ca2+]i elevation in vitro.
  Our results likely show another receptor‐receptor interaction model that is commonly
  observed in central neuronal synaptic functions. By inhibiting P2X7Rs, GABA blocks
  NE release from sympathetic neurons both inside and outside of cardiac tissues.
  By regulating sympathetic activity, GABA can attenuate arrhythmias in post‐MI rats,
  indicating that the GABAergic system could be a potential therapeutic target to
  protect the heart from arrhythmias post MI
