caption: An outline of the calcineurin signaling pathway. Calcineurin, a serine/threonine
  protein phosphatase, is activated by calcium and calmodulin after intracellular
  calcium levels are elevated for a sustained period of time. Activated calcineurin
  dephosphorylates several substrates, including the NFAT transcription factors, which
  then translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and activate a tissue-specific
  set of genes. In muscle, this set of genes includes MCIP-1, the protein product
  of which inhibits calcineurin, resulting in a negative feedback loop. Nuclear GSK-3β
  rephosphorylates nuclear NFATs, so that they are inactivated and exported from the
  nucleus.
