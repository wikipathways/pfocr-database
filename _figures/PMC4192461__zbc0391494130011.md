caption: Proposed schematic for the maturation of mNT and its role in exporting mitochondrial
  Fe-S and reactivating the cytosolic apo-IRP1 into Fe-S aconitase after H2O2-induced
  oxidative and nitrosative stress. In this model, the components of the ISC (purple),
  export (brown), and CIA (gray) machineries shown are limited to those addressed
  in this study. Fe-S of mNT is built with mitochondrial ferrous iron imported by
  the inner membrane carrier MFRN-2 and sulfur provided by NFS1. The mitochondrial
  ISCU and FXN platform, on which a transiently bound Fe-S is formed, is required
  for mNT maturation, along with the HSC20 chaperone, which facilitates the release
  of ISCU-bound Fe-S. In the inner mitochondrial membrane/IMS, ABCb7 and ALR constitute
  a maturation pathway dedicated to mNT Fe-S assembly that functions independently
  of the CIA members CIAPIN1, NUBP1, and NARFL. When mature, holo-mNT in a reducing
  environment is stable and does not contribute to maturation of extramitochondrial
  Fe-S proteins. Upon NO and H2O2 exposure, the cytosolic holo-aconitase is activated
  into the RNA-binding form of IRP1 (apo-form) through Fe-S disassembly. After NO
  or H2O2 challenge, holo-mNT can recycle the cytosolic apo-IRP1 into holo-aconitase
  through an Fe-S transfer process without passing through the CIA machinery.
