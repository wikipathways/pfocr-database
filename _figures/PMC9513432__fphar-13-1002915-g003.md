caption: Compartmentalization of sphingolipid synthesis. De novo sphingolipid synthesis
  (anabolic pathway) is located at the smooth ER and ER-associated membranes - perinuclear
  membrane and mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs). Sphingolipid synthesis starts
  via the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl co-enzyme A (CoA) to form 3-ketosphinganine
  by serine palmitoyltransferase. Subsequently, 3-ketosphinganine reductase reduces
  3-ketosphinganine to sphinganine, which is acylated in order to from dihydroceramide
  by ceramide synthase. Dihydroceramide is afterwards oxidized by a desaturase, which
  results in ceramide formation. Ceramide is transported from the ER to the Golgi
  apparatus and is converted into sphingomyelin by sphingomyelin synthase or glycosphingolipids
  by ceramide glucosyltransferase. Sphingomyelin and complex glycosphingolipids synthesized
  in the Golgi apparatus are transported to the plasma membrane. Within the plasma
  membrane and other cell compartments, sphingomyelin are hydrolyzed by acid/neutral
  sphingomyelinases (SMases) to yield ceramide. Ceramide can be hydrolyzed by ceramideases
  (Cdases) to form sphingosine, which can be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase
  (SphK) to generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P can then be cleaved by S1P
  lyase to fatty aldehyde and phosphoethanolamine. Alternatively, S1P can be dephosphorylated
  back to sphingosine by phosphatases.
