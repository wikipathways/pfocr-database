caption: Comparing methods of small molecular immune potentiation. Traditional SMIP
  adjuvant NF-κB pathway. Activation of TLR7/8 with the agonist (blue) leads to downstream
  pro-inflammatory responses and responses associated with adaptive immunity (antigen
  presentation). In our work, the adjuvant contains an activation moiety and a direct
  modulation moiety which alters the NF-κB pathway. Activation of TLR7/8 with the
  dimers also results in activation of the NF-κB pathway by the adjuvant (blue), while
  the tethered modulators (red) inhibit specific parts of the pathway resulting in
  lower pro-inflammatory immune response and enhanced or unchanged adaptive immune
  response.
