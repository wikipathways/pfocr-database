caption: Involvement of autophagy in diabetogenic effects of chronic exposure with
  inorganic arsenic and the use of HFD simultaneously. Macroautophagy is inhibited
  by insulin amino acid-mTOR signaling pathway in short- or long-term patterns. Short-term
  inhibition can be generated through mTORC1 by preventing ULK1 and long-term inhibition
  is achieved through FoxO transcription factors (subgroup of the Forkhead family
  of transcription factors) controlling the transcription of genes involved in autophagy.
  FoxO is phosphorylated and inhibited by insulin-induced action of PKB (Protein kinase
  B). Continuous intake of energy and nutritional stress inhibit autophagy that causes
  metabolic stress, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. In particular, the hypothesis
  is posed that considering the role of arsenic in the induction of autophagy, it
  can be argued that reduced insulin resistance in HFD − As diabetes is mediated by
  autophagy upregulation.
