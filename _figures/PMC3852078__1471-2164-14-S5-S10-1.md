caption: Flow chart of research protocol. By analysis of BA22 microarray data and
  Roessler liver 2 sample, the significant candidate genes were screened and constructed
  the PPI network for schizophrenia and cancer. The potential complexes or drugs are
  discovered by their corresponding pathways. The right part shows the corresponding
  tools used for analysis of candidate gene resources, PPI networks and pathway databases,
  the potential pathways and drugs.
