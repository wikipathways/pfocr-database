caption: 'Potential pathways by which glycometabolism disorder damages the diabetic
  heart. Insulin resistance promotes the internalization of glucose transporter 4
  (GLUT4) that means the decrease of transmembrane GLUT4 to inhibit glucose uptake
  in the diabetic cardiomyocyte. Oxidative stress and inflammation induced by the
  disturbance of glycometabolism involve the activation of three major pathways: sorbitol
  pathway, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)/receptor of AGE (RAGE) and hexosamine
  pathway. (A) Up-regulation of sorbitol pathway augments oxidative stress through
  decreasing the reduced glutathione (GSH) and increasing reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), which causes nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)-induced
  inflammation. (B) Hyperglycemia boosts the formation AGEs and activates the AGE/RAGE
  system, which results in extracellular matrix (ECM) cross-linking, cardiac remodeling,
  nitric oxide (NO) inactivation and oxidative stress. (C) Up-regulation of hexosamine
  biosynthesis in diabetes leads to O-linked N-acetylglucosamine glycosylation (O-GlcNAcylation)
  modification of proteins, producing O-GlcNAc-A20, endothelial NO synthase (eNOS),
  Sp1 and NF-κB. O-GlcNAcylation of A20 accelerates its ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation resulting in inflammation. O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 and NF-κB activate
  the transcriptional function to up-regulate pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic
  factors. O-GlcNAc-eNOS decreases NO formation while increases superoxide anion (O2-)
  production. In addition, hyperglycemia may also activate protein kinase C (PKC),
  directly through de novo synthesis of diacylglycerol (DAG) and indirectly through
  increased flux of sorbitol pathway and hexosamine pathway, to promote inflammation
  and oxidative stress. All these glycometabolism disorders result in cardiac remodeling
  and dysfunction in diabetes. AR, aldose reductase; F-6-P, fructose 6-phosphate;
