caption: 'Simplified mTOR signaling network with interactions inferred from modeling
  approaches. Depicted is the crosstalk of mTOR with MAPK signaling pathway. Red dashed
  edges numbered as circled labels represent the interactions and nodes inferred from
  modeling approaches. Label 1: PI3K dependent regulation of mTORC2 which is independent
  of negative feedback from S6K to IRS1. Label 2: Positive regulation of AMPK by IRS1.
  Label 3: Negative regulation of S6K by mTORC1. Label 4: Gab1 was found to be an
  important adaptor protein between insulin and MAPK signaling that plays a role of
  a nonlinear amplifier of mitogenic responses.'
