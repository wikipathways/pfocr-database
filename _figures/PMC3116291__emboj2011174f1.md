caption: Regulation of Hpo pathway signalling by F-actin. Under conditions of low
  apical F-actin, Hpo pathway activity is high, leading to inhibition of Yki activity
  and inhibition of tissue growth. When apical F-actin levels are high (upon activation
  of Dia or inhibition of Cp or Capt), Hpo pathway activity is inhibited leading to
  activation and nuclear import of Yki, and upregulation of Yki targets, thereby promoting
  tissue growth. Wts appears to be the key target of negative regulation of the Hpo
  pathway by apical F-actin. Active Hpo signalling also feeds back to block F-actin
  accumulation, at least partially independently of Yki function. Physiologically,
  F-actin accumulation may be regulated by external tension cues, thereby controlling
  tissue growth via the Hpo pathway.
