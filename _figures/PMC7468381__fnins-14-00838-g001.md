caption: Prevalence of DNA repair pathways during the different stages of the cell
  cycle. A Cas-containing RGN is directed to a target site in the genome consisting
  of a PAM and a sequence complementary to the spacer portion of the guide RNA. Depending
  on the RGN type, the produced double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) present either blunt
  or staggered ends. Depending on the phase of the cell cycle (displayed as gray circular
  arrows), different DNA repair mechanisms, each of which with their own set of factors,
  will be activated for repairing the site-specific DSB. Non-homologous end joining
  (NHEJ, in red) is active during the whole cell cycle except in mitosis, and homology-directed
  repair (HDR, in green) is mainly active during the S/G2 phases. Microhomology-mediated
  end joining (MMEJ, in blue) is an alternative NHEJ pathway mainly active during
  the G1/early S phases. This pathway shares some features with canonical NHEJ and
  HDR but uses a different molecular machinery and short homology sequences to repair
  the DNA break. In post-mitotic cells, the mostly error-free, HDR pathway is not
  active. For this reason, there are several innovative CRISPR/Cas-based strategies
  (boxed acronyms) that rely instead on NHEJ or MMEJ to allow for precise gene knock-in
  in non-dividing cells.
