caption: The insulin receptor cascade was uniquely up regulated in ER− cells when
  treated with AA. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the insulin receptor cascade showing
  the expression patterns of the pathway component in ER− cells. Cells were treated
  with AA at 6 and 24 hrs. RNA was isolated and hybridized on the cDNA microarray
  slides as detailed in materials and methods. Images were analyzed using GenePix
  6.0 and data were analyzed using GeneSpring 10.1
