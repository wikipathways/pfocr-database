caption: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) stimulation reduces the inflammatory responses in
  microglia. (A) The biosynthetic pathway of the active form of vitamin D3 (1,25‐(OH)2D3).
  Vitamin D3 is derived either from diet or from de novo synthesis dependent on ultraviolet‐B
  (UV‐B)‐induced conversion of 7‐dehydrocholesterol (7‐DHC), an intermediate product
  of the mevalonate pathway. 1,25‐(OH)2D3 is produced by the sequential hydroxylation
  of vitamin D3 by CYP2R1/CYP27A1 (25‐hydroxylases) in the liver and CYP27B1 (1α‐hydroxylase)
  in the kidney. (B) Proposed actions of 1,25‐(OH)2D3 on microglial phenotype. Activation
  of VDR inhibits extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and
  arrests nuclear translocation of NF‐κB that mediates the production of pro‐inflammatory
  factors in microglia. In addition, VDR activation increases the expression of an
  anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10 that induces the expression of SOCS3, an inhibitor
  of Janus kinase (JAK)/ signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)
  signaling. VDR is also expressed in neurons and triggers the upregulation of IL‐34,
  which activates its receptor (colony stimulating factor‐1 receptor; CSF1R) in microglia
  to suppress the inflammatory responses
