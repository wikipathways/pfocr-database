caption: PAMR is related to the sealing of TJ, which is connected to the tight junction
  proteins Claudin and Occludin and forms the intestinal epithelial barrier. Studies
  have found that MLCK and MLC are involved in regulating PAMR and thereby affecting
  barrier permeability. Under normal physiological conditions, Na+/glucose cotransport
  activates MLCK and phosphorylates MLC, which can cause the contraction of the skeleton
  ring and generate tension on the TJ, thus loosening the seal between cells and increasing
  the permeability of the barrier. Under HS conditions, on the one hand, the PKC-MLC
  pathway will act, leading to the contraction of PAMR. On the other hand, under HS
  conditions, a large amount of HSP70 is produced, which binds to TLR4 and promotes
  the secretion of TNF-α. Increased pro-inflammatory factors upregulate the expression
  of MLCK by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway
