caption: Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) and their downstream signaling. Toll‐like receptors
  are membrane attached pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that initiate pathways
  that produce IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. TLR 2 and TLR9 are activated by
  viral DNA, TLR3 by viral double stranded RNA, and TLR7/8 by single‐stranded RNA.
  Toll‐like receptor 2 is located on the outer membrane of the cell, while TLR 3,
  TLR7/8, and TLR9 are associated with an endosome membrane. After activation by viral
  nucleic acids, TLRs engage adapter proteins and activate them. The complexes of
  TLRs with activated adaptor proteins phosphorylate interferon regulatory factors
  3 and/or 7 (IRF3 and/or IRF7). Phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7 relocate from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus, where they trigger type 1 IFN production. Through an alternative
  pathway, the TLR/adaptor protein complexes trigger proinflammatory cytokine production.
  Malfunction of TLR receptors or IRFs disrupts downstream pathways, making cancer
  cells vulnerable to oncolytic virus infection
