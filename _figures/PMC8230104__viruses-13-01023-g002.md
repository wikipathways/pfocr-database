caption: SeV replication cycle. (A) Genome structure of SeV. Polymerase complex genes
  nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), and large polymerase (L) are color-coded red;
  matrix (M) is colored yellow; fusion (F) is colored blue; and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase
  (HN) is colored green. (B) Replication cycle of SeV. During step 1, HN binds sialic-acid-containing
  receptors, triggering irreversible conformational changes in the F protein that
  cause fusion of the viral envelope and host cell plasmid membrane. The genome and
  associated polymerase complexes are delivered into the cytoplasm, where they remain
  during replication. In step 2, the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase transcribes viral
  genes serially starting from the 3′ end. In step 3, viral proteins are translated
  and processed. In steps 4 and 5, complementary genome is replicated and then serves
  as a template for replication of negative-sense genomes needed to produce progeny
  virions. In step 6, F and HN proteins traffic through the secretory pathway to the
  cell surface. The M protein associates with host cell proteins, viral ribonucleoproteins,
  envelope glycoprotein tails, and the plasmid membrane to help drive budding of progeny
  virions. HN receptor-destroying activity is needed for progeny virus release.
