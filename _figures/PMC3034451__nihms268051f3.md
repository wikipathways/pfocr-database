caption: '(A) The core components of the ESX-1 pathway are EccA1, EccB1, EccCa1, EccCb1,
  EccD1, EccE1 and MycP1. In the developing model of ESX export, C-terminal signal
  peptides of ESX-1 substrates (EspC and CFP-10) are recognized by cytoplasmic AAA
  ATPases (EccA1 and EccCb1). Through interactions with membrane components of the
  ESX-1 system, the ATPases are proposed to deliver these proteins to the translocation
  channel. EccD1 is the putative membrane channel through which the proteins are translocated.
  (B) The genomic ESX-1 locus of M. tuberculosis is shown along with the distally
  located espACD and espR genes. The RD1 deleted in BCG is indicated. (C) There is
  a recently introduced systematic nomenclature for genes of the ESX-1 locus []. The
  new gene names and previously used nomenclature, derived from the M. tuberculosis
  genome annotation, are shown.BCG: Bacille Calmette-Guérin; CFP: Culture filtrate
  protein; ESAT: Early secreted antigenic target; RD1: Region of difference 1.'
