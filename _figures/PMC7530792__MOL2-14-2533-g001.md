caption: Dipyridamole inhibits the sterol‐regulated feedback loop of the MVA pathway.
  Schematic representation of the MVA pathway. Statins inhibit the rate‐limiting enzyme
  of the pathway, HMGCR, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG‐CoA to MVA. MVA is
  subsequently used to synthesize various metabolites that are important for cell
  growth and survival, including GGPP and cholesterol. Statin‐mediated cholesterol
  depletion induces the cleavage and activation of SREBP2, which in turn induces the
  transcription of genes involved in MVA metabolism to restore homeostasis. We previously
  identified that the drug dipyridamole can inhibit statin‐induced SREBP2 activation;
  however, the mechanism by which dipyridamole inhibits SREBP2 cleavage remains poorly
  understood.
