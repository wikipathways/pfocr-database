caption: The molecular network of VvARFs mediating plant hormone interaction to regulate
  plant growth and development. The genes involved in CTK signaling pathway are represented
  by blue box; The genes involved in SA signaling pathway are represented by orange
  box; The genes involved in IAA signaling pathway are represented by green box; The
  genes involved in ETH signaling pathway are represented by yellow box; The genes
  involved in ABA signaling pathway are represented by grey box.
