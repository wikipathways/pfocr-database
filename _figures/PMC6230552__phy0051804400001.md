caption: Pancreatic β-cell oxidative stressInsulin secretion in β-cells is coupled
  to glucose metabolism, leading to subsequent increase in the ATP-to-ADP ratio. Mitochondria
  are pivotal for producing ATP required for nutrient-induced insulin secretion. ATP
  binds and closes the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. This depolarizes the plasma
  membrane, opening voltage-gated Ca+2 channels with the influx of Ca+2 stimulating
  secretion of insulin. NOX activation also contributes to insulin secretion, although
  the mechanism is unclear. These events observed in GSIS are depicted with black
  lines, and mechanisms by which oxidative stress is generated and contributes to
  altered GSIS are depicted with red lines and red Xs. ROS can damage mitochondrial
  components, including mtDNA and protein, which could result in reduced mitochondrial
  ATP production and increase mitochondrial-derived ROS. ROS consequently activates
  redox-responsive signaling pathway JNK, leading to nuclear exclusion of PDX-1, whereas
  activation of redox-regulated NF-κB upregulates pro-oxidant enzymes NOX-2 and iNOS.
  Both NF-κB and NRF2 increase gene expression of antioxidant defense genes. GSIS,
