caption: Shown are all submodules connected to at least one PKA catalytic subunit
  (‘PKA’) and containing a known regulator in the PKA pathway. Pink and purple filled
  circles represent the PKA catalytic subunits and members of the PKA pathway, respectively.
  Submodules are colored according to the key and annotated by the phospho-motif and
  mutant phenotype if peptide changes were defective (-) or amplified (+) in the pde2Δ
  (‘p’), or cdc14-3 (‘c’) mutants. Inhibition of PKA by Pde2-dependent cAMP decay
  is also represented. Red arrows indicate a motif match between at least one PKA
  kinase subunit and the target submodule (FDR < 0.2). Ras2 is shown in its active
  (bound to GTP) and inactive states (bound to GDP). The predicted PKA auto-phosphorylation
  is on the Tpk3 subunit.
