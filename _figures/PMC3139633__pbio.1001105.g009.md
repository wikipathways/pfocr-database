caption: (A) Hyphal development in C. albicans requires two phases of sequential changes
  in the promoter chromatin of hypha-specific genes. Initiation requires a rapid but
  temporary disappearance of Nrg1 in response to the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway,
  while the duration of hyphal development is under the regulation of the TOR pathway
  by controlling promoter access to Nrg1 through recruitment of Hda1. Black lines
  represent active regulatory relationships; grey lines represent relationships that
  are inactive. Dashed circles represent degraded proteins. (B) Hda1 is recruited
  only during the time period when Nrg1 is absent. This provides a mechanism for temporal
  integration of two major nutrient-sensing cell growth pathways in development.
