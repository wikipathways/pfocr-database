caption: Schematic view of the interplay between different cell death modalities in
  the context of infection. During immune challenge, in infected macrophages (a) an
  autophagic process can be triggered by pathogen contact and the phagocyted microorganisms
  are targeted by an ubiquitin coat to autophagosomes and then to autolysosomes to
  be eliminated by acidic and enzymatic degradation. If microbes are persistent or
  escape from vacuolar compartments, under apoptosis blockade (e.g. by caspase 8 inactivation),
  alternative cell death programmes can be activated, releasing the pathogen to be
  neutralized by other immune cells, enhancing inflammation and activating the immune
  system. Thus, the cell can go undergo autophagic cell death, necroptosis induced
  by TLRs under caspase 8 inhibition, through the RIPK1‐RIPK3‐MLKL pathway or by microbial
  DNA through DAI‐RIPK3 interactions, or caspase 1‐dependent pyroptosis triggered
  by NOD receptors. On the other hand, in infected neutrophils (b) pathogen contact
  triggers an apoptotic process that ensures the safe disposal of the microbial components
  and toxins after its degradation and at the same time regulates neutrophil population
  during immune response. Alternatively, persistent pathogens can also activate NETosis,
  through the ERK‐NOX4 pathway, massive permeabilization and releasing of granule
  contents that cause neutrophil death, but the released extracellular traps enclose
  and destroy invader pathogens. Casp, caspase; DAI, DNA‐dependent activator of IFN‐regulatory
