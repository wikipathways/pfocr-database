caption: Model of  Interaction with the b-Dependent Developmental Control Pathway.(A)
  Filamentous growth is triggered by bE/bW-dependent induction of rbf1 expression.
  Elevated levels of rbf1 are required and sufficient to trigger filamentous growth,
  G2 cell cycle arrest, the formation of appressoria, and penetration of the plant
  surface. During prepenetration stages of pathogenic development, the  pathway is
  in its “off” state. Active  signaling suppresses the formation of the infectious
  filament by reducing bE/bW and, as a consequence thereof, rbf1 transcript levels.(B)
  After plant penetration, activation of the  leads to stabilization of Clp1 via the
  Cib1/Clp1 interaction. Concomitantly,  stress tolerance is enhanced via this interaction,
  enabling constitutive activation of the  and thereby efficient secretion of effector
  molecules during biotrophic development. Increased Clp1 levels lead to suppression
  of the b-pathway through direct interaction of Clp1 with bW and Rbf1. The consequence
  of these regulatory cross-connections are (1) the rapid release of the G2 cell cycle
  block, (2) efficient transition of developmental programs, and (3) the establishment
  of a developmental checkpoint to time fungal development and the capacity for increased
  secretion of effector molecules.[See online article for color version of this figure.]
