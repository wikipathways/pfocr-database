caption: Mechanistic pathways for increased vascular inflammation in diabetes. Insulin
  resistance inhibits nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by reducing vasodilation via decreased
  activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) together with increased production of
  vasoconstrictors such as endothelin-1. Hyperglycemia and increased levels of free
  fatty acids enhance the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce NO
  synthesis via several cellular mechanisms. Free fatty acids bind to toll-like receptor
  which activates the NF-κB pathway and stimulates inflammation by increasing interleukin
  (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Additionally, toll-like receptor stimulates
  the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) followed by downregulation
  of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway and the glucose transporter GLUT-4, consequently resulting
  in reduction of NO production.
