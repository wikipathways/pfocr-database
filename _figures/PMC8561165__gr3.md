caption: 'Influence of KMO, vitamin B6, CXCL9, and IL-18 on the kynurenine pathway(A)
  Low KMO activity and low vitamin B6 (VitB6) correlate with a low ratio HAA/AA but
  not with KA (for details, see ).(B) High CXCL9 (but not IL-18) correlates with IDO
  activity (for details, see A and S5B).(C) High IL-18 correlates with high AA and
  with high KA, and there is no effect of CXCL9 on KA (for details, see  and ).(D)
  Triple-hit model of fibrosing cGVHD (hypothesis): severe fibrosing cGVHD is associated
  with strong CXCL9-induced activation of IDO. The result of this activation is influenced
  by reduced KMO activity, either because of genetic polymorphisms or because of the
  lack of vitamin B2, and is further aggravated by a lack of vitamin B6. The resulting
  metabolic deviation increases AA concentrations and reduces the 3-HAA/AA ratio.
  Finally, high IL-18 is associated with increased serum KA. These three hits result
  in a metabolic situation with high KA and a low ratio of 3-HAA/AA, which predicts
  a risk of fibrosing cGVHD. The number of replicates depend on the available measurements
  of the respective metabolites (for details, see ).'
