caption: Illustration of Hippo-p53 pathway in megakaryocytes (MKs). Low RhoA activity
  leads to increased Hippo pathway activity by increasing the expression and phosphorylation
  of LATS2 leading to increased interaction with MDM2. The interaction between LATS2
  and MDM2 inhibits MDM2-p53 interaction thereby releasing p53, which can now enter
  the nucleus and act as a transcription factor blocking cell cycle progression. At
  the same time, increased expression and phosphorylation of LATS2 increases phosphorylation
  of YAP. YAP is thus sequestered away from the nucleus, thereby blocking its transcriptional
  activity. In MKs, the cells fail to respond to decreased RhoA activity and do not
  increase the expression of LATS2 or phosphorylation of YAP.
