caption: Putative fatty acid synthase pathway of Thraustochytriidae sp. SZU445 with
  the classical fatty acid synthesis pathway and the polyketide synthase pathway.
  The enzymes colored blue are present in the classical fatty acid synthase (FAS)
  and polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways. The enzymes colored green are present in
  Thraustochytriidae sp. SZU445 and correspond to the classical FAS and PKS pathways.
  The enzymes colored red are isozymes of dehydrase and isomerase in the PKS pathway
  that exist in Thraustochytriidae sp. SZU445.
