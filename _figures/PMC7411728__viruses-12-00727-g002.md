caption: Regulation of inflammation, innate immunity, and adaptive immunity by CH25H
  and 25HC. The expression of CH25H, which encodes cholesterol 25-hydroxylase, and
  the generation of 25HC were enhanced by pathogen-induced interferon (IFN) or lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS). a, 25HC has anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing SREBP or inflammasome
  activity and interacting with myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2) to prevent
  the LPS-induced activation of Akt and the NF-κB signaling pathway. b, 25HC acts
  as an inflammatory amplifier to promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  by activating the NF-κB and ERK1/2 pathways. c, Both innate immune cells and adaptive
  immune cells can be regulated by 7α-25HC through its ligand-G protein coupling receptor
  Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2).
