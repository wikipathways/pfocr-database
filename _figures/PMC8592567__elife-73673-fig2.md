caption: Innate immune cells in the lamina propria, such as macrophages (MΦ) and Dendritic
  cells (DCs), can continuously sample gut luminal contents, for example, indigo and
  polysaccharides, by extending the phagocytic processes directly into the gut lumen
  and also by receiving materials transcytosed out of the lumen by Microfold cells
  (M cells). This capacity presumably evolved to monitor the gut microbiome and allows
  the immune system to monitor and respond to molecules that cannot cross the gut
  wall. Upon activation by xenobiotics and gut microbes, macrophages and DCs upregulate
  cytokines and chemokines either directly via NFκB or IRF3 signaling pathway, or
  indirectly by activating other immune cell types in the lamina propria, such as
  group three innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), T helper 17 (TH17) cells and regulatory
  T (Treg) cells. The intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) also perform key innate immune
  functions with their expressions of distinct TLRs and AHR.
