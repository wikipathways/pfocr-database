caption: Proposed model of cooperative D1 degradation in the PSII repair cycle. Photodamaged
  PSII generated at all light intensities migrates to stroma thylakoids from grana
  stacks, and PSII monomerization occurs. In PSII repair, processive D1 degradation
  is conducted predominantly by FtsH irrespective of the light intensity (fundamental
  degradation). In contrast, under photoinhibitory conditions, an endopeptidic cleavage
  by Deg increases the rate of D1 degradation because smaller D1 cleavage fragments
  facilitate effective degradation (escape pathway). D1 cleavage by Deg most likely
  occurs in PSII dimer, PSII monomer, and the RC47 complex. Cleaved D1 fragments are
  subjected to further degradation by FtsH, but other proteases such as SppA and Clp
  proteases participate in this pathway with a mechanism that remains unclear.
