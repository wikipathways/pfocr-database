caption: 'HIV induction by PKC activators and HDAC and BET inhibitors: NFκB is sequestered
  in the cytoplasm by IκB. PKC activators such as Prostratin and Bryostatin induce
  HIV from latency through activation of the PKC/NFκB signaling pathway leading to
  degradation of IκB and translocation of NFκB to the nucleus where it binds to NFκB
  biding sites at the HIV LTR and activates transcription. HDACs are recruited to
  the HIV LTR by several different transcription factor complexes (designated here
  as TF for simplicity) and promote transcriptional repression of the HIV LTR in part
  by removing acetyl groups from the lysine tails of histones associated with the
  nucleosome bound provirus, thus increasing the tight interaction of histones with
  proviral DNA and thereby creating an environment less conducive for transcription.
  Inhibition of HDAC activities by compounds such as Vorinostat and Panobinostat lead
  to acetylation (AC) of lysine residues on histones tails resulting in a relaxation
  of the interaction of histones and DNA, facilitating the binding of positive transcription
  factors that induce HIV transcription initiation and elongation. Finally, inhibition
  of BET protein family members BRD2 and BRD4 by BET inhibitors such as JQ1 leads
  to HIV promoter activation through separate modes of action. BRD4 competes with
  Tat for the binding of PTEF-b (composed of CDK9 and cyclin T1). Inhibition of BRD4
  allows enhanced Tat binding to PTEF-b and transactivation that is required for productive
  transcription elongation. Although less clear, it is hypothesized that inhibition
  of BRD2 may block recruitment of repressive transcription complexes (in exchange
  for activator complexes), thus promoting HIV transcription. BET, bromodomain extraterminal;
  BRD, bromodomain containing; HDAC, histone deacetylase; LTR, long terminal repeat;
