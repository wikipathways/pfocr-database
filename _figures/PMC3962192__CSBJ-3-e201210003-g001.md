caption: Glycolysis (Embden-Meyerhof pathway). The sequence of enzymatic reactions
  in the conversion of glucose to pyruvate and finally, to fermentation products.
  In blue letters, are the enzymes involved. Highlighted, are the components exchanged
  between oxidation or reduction reactions. The number of the produced molecules are
  highlighted in red.
