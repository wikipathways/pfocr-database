caption: 'Summary of the study. (Left) When ODC is suppressed, AdoMetDC activity is
  either activated or unchanged. Decreased ODC results in decreased supply of putrescine
  for polyamine synthesis. The decreased supply of putrescine does not require an
  aminopropyl group (A in circle) from dcSAM. Therefore, surplus dcSAM inhibits DNMT
  1, 3a, and 3b activities, resulting in aberrant methylation of the entire genome
  and demethylation of ITGAL. (Right) When spermine is supplied from extracellular
  sources as a result of increased polyamine intake, intracellular polyamine synthesis
  is suppressed. Spermidine is produced by the degradation of spermine via SSAT/Acetyl
  CoA and APAO, and therefore, no aminopropyl group (A in circle) is required for
  polyamine synthesis. This may result in strong inhibition of AdoMetDC (indicated
  by thick T-bar), resulting in a decrease of dcSAM concentration or dcSAM/SAM ratio.
  Decreased dcSAM re-activates DNMT 3a and 3b, resulting in regulation of the methylation
  status of the entire genome as well as hypermethylation of ITGAL. Hypermethylation
  of ITGAL suppresses aging-associated enhancement of the pro-inflammatory status
  by decreasing protein levels of LFA-1. Inhibition of aberrant DNA methylation may
  result in inhibition of various aging-associated pathological changes. Arrows indicate
  the metabolic pathway or flow of substances. T-bars indicate inhibitory activity.
  Dashed arrows indicate the consequence (downstream) induced by the change (upstream).
