caption: The hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult brain. A) The subgranular zone
  (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) niche in the rodent brain received mesenchymal
  stem cells; B) Adult MSCs can naturally secrete trophic factors and cytokines which
  are important for the generation and differentiation of newborn neurons in neurogenic
  regions of the adult brain such as SGZ of the dentate gyrus. Quiescent radial-glia-like
  type I neural progenitor cells (QNPs) can generate proliferating intermediate progenitor
  cells with transient amplifying characteristics. These intermediate progenitor cells
  can give rise to type III cells and subsequently differentiate into dentate granule
  neurons such as immature and mature granule neurons. The Notch signaling pathway
  has a critical role in maintaining active NSCs in the developing CNS. Moreover,
  WNT3 is expressed in the SGZ of the DG, and its overexpression is essential to increase
  neurogenesis. WNTs can be produced by astrocytes in the adult hippocampal niche,
  and support the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. Besides
  stem cell factors can modulate microglial functions and induce activation of the
  neuroprotective effects of microglia. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) produced
  by microglia can modulate motor learning-dependent synapse formation. Furthermore,
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can be up-regulated in AD-MSCs-treated
  animals. VEGF is a signal protein produced by cells that regulate vascular permeability
  and angiogenesis
