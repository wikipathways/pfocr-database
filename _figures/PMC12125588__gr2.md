caption: 'Mechanisms of ginsenoside Rg1 in protecting ischemic myocardium.Ginsenoside
  Rg1 (Rg1) offers significant cardioprotection in ischemic myocardium through multiple
  mechanisms. A. Anti-apoptotic effects: Rg1 prevents apoptosis in cardiomyocytes
  by promoting the dissociation of Bcl-2 and Beclin-2, regulating the HIF-α/ERK and
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, as well as inhibiting intracellular ATP depletion to suppress
  AMPK pathway activation. This leads to increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins
  Bcl-2 and Beclin-2, and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, caspase-3,
  and caspase-9. B. Antioxidant activity: Rg1 enhances oxidative stress response by
  regulating intracellular Ca2+ equilibrium, reducing ROS, and boosting mitochondrial
  membrane potential, thus preserving mitochondrial structure and function. Key pathways
  include inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway, suppression of GSTP-1 to facilitate
  OPA-1 expression, and activation of the Akt/GSK-3β pathway through P2X7 expression
  inhibition. C. Anti-inflammatory effects: Rg1 attenuates inflammatory responses
  in myocardial cells by inhibiting the NF-κB/p65 pathway through TLR4 receptor suppression,
  stimulating the AMPK/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, preventing the activation of the NLRP-3
  inflammasome, and promoting macrophage M2 polarization. Collectively, these mechanisms
  reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, thereby alleviating inflammation.Abbreviations:
