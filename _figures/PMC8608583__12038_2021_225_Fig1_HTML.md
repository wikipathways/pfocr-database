caption: Lectin mediated signalling in plant defense. (The binding of lectin domains
  with PAMP’s or DAMP’s at cell surface starts an intracellular signaling pathway,
  which includes downstream proteins phosphorylation cascade, activation of transcription
  factors, and ultimately regulation of stress-responsive genes. Nucleocytoplasmic
  lectins bind with intracellular effectors and generate defense response).
