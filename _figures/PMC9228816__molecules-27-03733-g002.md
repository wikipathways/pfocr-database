caption: MOCS2 translationally responds to inflammation, DNA alkylation signaling,
  and nutritionally challenging environments (e.g., limited acetyl-CoA and sulfur
  amino acids). MPTAC regulates sulfur amino acid catabolism in which SUOX catalyzes
  the oxidation of sulfite, which contains a sulfite ion (SO32−), to sulfate (SO42−)
  in the terminal step. This prevents accumulation of toxic sulfite and ROS generated
  from disordered sulfur amino acid catabolism. XDH activity requires Moco. XDH is
  converted into XO in the inflammatory environment. Increased XO activity produces
  superoxide ion (O2•–) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sources of alkylating agents
  that trigger DNA alkylation damage. MutSa responds to DNA alkylation damage (O6-methylguanine,
  O6meG) in a MPTAC- and ATAC-dependent manner. DNA alkylation damage signaling by
  the association of MutSa, MPTAC, and ATAC promotes mevalonate pathways, leading
  to sterol synthesis and resulting in an anti-inflammation response and a reduction
  in alkylating agents. XDH loads MOCS2 mRNA onto polysomes, promoting MOCS2 protein
  synthesis. Therefore, XDH promotes DNA alkylation damage signaling via promotion
  of MPTAC expression, which is essential for MutSa stability. Overall, in inflammatory
  environments, XDH is converted into XO, which induces apoptosis of toxic cells carrying
  mutations via the production of alkylating agents. MPTAC promotes fatty acid β-oxidation,
  which generates acetyl-CoA in nutritionally challenging environments. Acetyl-CoA
  is essential for initiation of the mevalonate pathway. MPTAC also maintains cellular
  levels of SAMe, which is required for methylation at N7G in mRNA. Thus, MOCS2 in
  MPTAC coordinates the utilization of acetyl-CoA and SAMe.
