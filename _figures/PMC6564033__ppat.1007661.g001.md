caption: (A) Model for apicoplast evolutionary history. Red algae arose following
  primary endosymbiosis, during which a eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthetic
  cyanobacterium that underwent evolutionary reduction to become a chloroplast. The
  ancestors of the Apicomplexa emerged following secondary endosymbiosis, during which
  another eukaryotic cell engulfed a red alga, which then underwent evolutionary reduction
  to become a four-membraned, photosynthetic secondary plastid. During evolution of
  the Apicomplexa, the secondary plastid lost its photosynthetic machinery but retained
  components of key metabolic pathways to become what we now know as the apicoplast.
  Note that this model is simplified and that the precise evolutionary events that
  gave rise to the apicoplast (e.g., vertical plastid inheritance from a common chromalveolate
  ancestor versus acquisition by tertiary endosymbiosis) are not yet resolved. (B)
  Model for import of lumenal apicoplast proteins via the secretory system and retooled
  ERAD machinery. Most apicoplast proteins contain a bipartite N-terminal targeting
  signal consisting of a eukaryotic SP followed by a plant-like TP. The SP mediates
  cotranslational import into the ER via the SEC61 complex and is cleaved by the signal
  peptidase complex to reveal the TP. The TP then mediates sorting and trafficking
  to the apicoplast and import across its membranes. The machinery involved in recognizing
  apicoplast proteins in the endomembrane system is unknown. Apicoplast proteins are
  presumed to traffic from the ER to the outermost apicoplast membrane via a vesicular
  trafficking pathway. After crossing the outermost apicoplast membrane, apicoplast
  proteins cross the periplastid membrane using retooled ERAD machinery. Finally,
  lumenal apicoplast cargo crosses the innermost apicoplast membranes via complexes
  related to the TOC and TIC machinery of primary plastids. The apicoplast outer membrane
