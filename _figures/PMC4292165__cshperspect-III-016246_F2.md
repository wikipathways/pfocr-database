caption: Signaling pathway of endosomal TLRs. Endosomal residents of TLR family are
  TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13. dsRNA recognition by TLR3 recruits
  TRIF to initiate signaling cascade that further activates TBK1 to induce IRF3-mediated
  type I IFN production. Concurrently, TRIF can also interact with TRAF6 to activate
  NF-κB for transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. TLR7 and TLR8 recognize viral
  ssRNA, whereas TLR9 recognizes CpG DNA from both bacteria and viruses. Ligand stimulation
  facilitates UNC93B1-dependent trafficking of TLR7 and TLR9 from ER to endosomes,
  where TLR9 undergoes proteolytic cleavage. Following this TLR7 and TLR9 recruit
  MyD88 to activate NF-κB and IRF7 to induce transcription of proinflammatory cytokines
  and type I IFN genes, respectively. TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13 recognize flagellin,
  profilin, and bacterial 23sRNA, respectively, and induce NF-κB signaling through
  MyD88 and TIRAP. Endosomal TLR signaling can be modulated by MARCH5 and viperin.
