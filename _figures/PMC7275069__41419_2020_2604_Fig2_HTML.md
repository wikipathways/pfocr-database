caption: In mice, TGF-β can activate the expression of Noxa protein and inhibit EGF-mediated
  survival signal transduction by upregulating FOXF2 expression to achieve apoptosis
  of cancer cells. FOXF2 can be upregulated by MAZ and mediate the function of MAZ
  on promoting the proliferation of cancer cells. FOXF2 can also directly inhibit
  the expression of P21 and promote the proliferation of tumour cells in mice. FOXF2
  inhibits proliferation by inhibiting the CDK2-RB-E2F cascade or the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. FOXF2 mediates the effect of SP1 to inhibit proliferation. FOXF2 can downregulate
  the expression of FOXC2 to inhibit the proliferation and EMT of tumour cells. FOXF2
  can promote EMT by downregulating the expression of E-cadherin and miR-200 and by
  upregulating vimentin expression. FOXF2 can also inhibit Twist 1 or downregulate
  β-catenin to inhibit EMT. FOXF2 promotes tumour metastasis by activating the BMP/SMAD
  pathway, and it inhibits lymphatic metastasis by inhibiting the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 pathway.
  To inhibit the migration of tumours, FOXF2 downregulates the expression of Wnt5a
  or inhibits the degradation of ECM by activating TIMP3. EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition; Zeb1, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1; MAZ, Myc-associated zinc
  finger protein; LSD1, lysine-specific demethylase 1; Wnt5a, wingless-type MMTV integration
  site family member 5a; VEGFR3, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3; TIMP3,
  tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3; and ECM, extracellular matrix.
