caption: Module function analysis of common targets of multiple disease combinations
  (COVID-19, RA, AS, GA). After the functional analysis of the module, the 99 targets
  can be aggregated into eight modules, and the circle of each color represents one
  module, which is mainly related to immune response, inflammatory progression, bacteria
  and virus expression and other functions. And there is a close relationship between
  the enriched targets on each module, and also has a certain correlation with the
  targets on other modules.
