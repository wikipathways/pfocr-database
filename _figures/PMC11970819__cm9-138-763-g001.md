caption: 'Overview of the pathophysiology and emerging therapeutic targets of IBD.
  IBD is characterized by genetically predisposed individuals exposed to environmental
  factors experiencing gut microbiota dysbiosis, leading to an increase in pathogenic
  organisms. This is accompanied by abnormal differentiation or exhaustion of intestinal
  stem cells, collectively impairing the intestinal mucosal barrier function. These
  changes trigger an imbalance between effector T cells and regulatory T cells. T
  cells differentiate into Th1 and Th17 cells via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway,
  releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cells can also migrate into the vasculature
  and circulate to inflammatory sites through S1P receptor-mediated processes. Under
  physiological conditions, the vagus nerve mediates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory
  pathway to maintain intestinal immune homeostasis. However, IBD patients exhibit
  reduced vagal nerve activity, further exacerbating inflammation. Advances in understanding
  the pathogenesis of IBD have identified novel therapeutic targets. Recently, IL-23
  inhibitors and JAK inhibitors have been approved for IBD treatment, offering new
  avenues for disease management. Furthermore, emerging therapeutic modalities such
  as FMT, probiotics, HSCT, MSCT, and VNS have shown promise in clinical and preclinical
  studies. APC: Antigen-presenting cell; CD: Crohn’s disease; FMT: Fecal microbiota
