caption: Illustration of hBM-MSC-Ex stimulates cutaneous wound healing by regulating
  the TGF-β/Smad signal pathway. hBM-MSC-Ex inhibited TGF-β1 and activated TGF-β3
  expression; TGF-β isoforms and activins stimulate intracellular signaling via Smad-2/3
  transcription factors; phosphorylated Smad-2 and Smad-3 bind to Smad-4 leading to
  the transcription and expression of α-SMA; inhibitory Smad7 are activated by the
  binding of the TGF-β super family to the cell surface receptors

  wound healing mediates through TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.
