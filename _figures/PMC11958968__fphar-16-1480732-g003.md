caption: Network representation of DSF, its modulated targets, and pathways involved
  in RF. Nodes shown in blue are DSF-modulated targets involved in the RF but are
  not enriched to be involved in the molecular pathways. The provided figure represents
  a network map showing the interactions and pathways associated with disulfiram.
  The central green node labeled “disulfiram” indicates the drug around which the
  interactions are mapped. Edges between nodes are color-coded based on edge betweenness
  and edge count, with blue, green, and red representing low, medium, and high values,
  respectively. The color gradient from blue to red represents an increasing edge
  count
