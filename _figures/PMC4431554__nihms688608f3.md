caption: Two transmembrane proteins, Six-microns-under (SIMU) and Draper, regulate
  the engulfment and phagocytosis of axosomes by glia in Drosophila. These proteins
  are homologues and have large extracellular regions with multiple epidermal growth
  factor (EGF)-like repeats and an EMILIN-like domain. SIMU and Draper function in
  the same pathway, most probably recognizing synaptic debris by binding to unidentified
  ‘eat-me’ signals on degenerating axons. SIMU seems to be involved in the initial
  recognition and uptake steps of engulfment, but it lacks an intracellular signalling
  domain. By contrast, Draper is capable of intracellular signalling and operates
  downstream of SIMU. The cytoplasmic adaptor protein CED-6 functions downstream of
  Draper, mediating the internalization and lysosomal degradation of debris. In addition,
  Draper triggers cytoskeletal rearrangements and phagocytosis through an interaction
  with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase SHARK. The kinase SRC42A facilitates the SHARK–Draper
  interaction by phosphorylating Draper.
