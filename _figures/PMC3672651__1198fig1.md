caption: 'Life cycle of Chlamydomonas and description of treatment groups. (A) Gametes
  are formed when vegetative plus and minus cells undergo gametogenesis induced by
  nitrogen deprivation. When gametes of opposite mating type are mixed, they adhere
  to each other by adhesion molecules on their flagella—SAG1 on plus gametes and SAD1
  on minus gametes. Flagellar adhesion induces gamete activation and an increase in
  cAMP that leads to release of cell walls, erection of mating structures at the apical
  ends of the gamete cell bodies (shown at top right), and several other cellular
  and biochemical changes that prepare the gametes for cell fusion. All of the events
  associated with gamete activation can be induced in gametes of a single mating type
  by incubating them in dibutyryl cAMP. The mating structure adhesion molecule FUS1
  on the plus gamete binds to an unidentified receptor on the minus mating structure,
  and the membranes of the two structures fuse through the action of the minus gamete-specific
  fusion protein HAP2. Upon coalescence into a quadriflagellated zygote, the plus
  gamete-specific homeodomain protein GSP1 interacts with the minus gamete-specific
  homeodomain protein GSM1 to form a complex essential for activation of the zygote
  developmental pathway. Within several hours, the plus and minus nuclei congress
  and undergo fusion to form the diploid zygote nucleus. Upon return to the light
  after an obligatory period (at least 5 d) in the dark, the zygote undergoes DNA
  replication and meiosis, and the resulting four haploid progeny are released (germination)
  from the remnant of the mother cell wall and enter the vegetative part of their
  life cycle (). (B) The following eight samples were analyzed by RNA-seq: asynchronously
  growing vegetative cells (V-asyn), synchronously growing vegetative cells (V-syn),

  plus gametes (PG-L), and dibutyryl cAMP-activated plus gametes (PG-A).'
