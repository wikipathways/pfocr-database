caption: Decision tree constructed using the Classification and Regression Tree (C&RT)
  approach. Each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) is expressed as a restriction enzyme
  and RF length (bp), e.g. HhaI 93-bp OTU is abbreviated as Hh93 and MspI 208-bp OTU
  is abbreviated as M208. The cut-off value of each dividing OTU was calculated from
  the OTU data of all the subjects, using the Gini coefficient with the C&RT method.
  Similar steps were repeated for the construction of a decision tree. Node-0 (the
  left end of the decision tree) is referred to as the root node, which is the starting
  point for tree construction. The details of the decision tree and the pathway indicate
  the species and quantities of OTUs, which contribute to dividing the various subject
  groups. RF, restriction fragment.
