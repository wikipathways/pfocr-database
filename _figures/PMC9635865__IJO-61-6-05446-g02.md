caption: Schematic diagram indicating the mechanisms of the effects of NSCLC rehabilitation
  approaches for patients. (A) Respiratory muscle training increases the oxygen supply
  and improves mitochondrial function and aerobic exercise capacity in skeletal muscle,
  increases the cross-sectional area of skeletal muscle fibers and decreases the proportion
  of glycolytic muscle fibers, particularly reducing the proportion of type Ⅱb muscle
  fibers. It also has therapeutic effects, such as improving the VO2 peak and increasing
  the ejection fraction and the output per stroke, and practice improves the ability
  and work efficiency of patients with NSCLC to cope with the heart and lung exercise
  load. (B) Interventions in ventilation modes change the PEEP, which leads to a physiologic
  dead space to VD/VT increase, a rise in PACO2 and then V/Q regulation, causing hypoxemia.
  Exercise may activate the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway through increasing MMP levels,
  and also activate the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, finally improving a patient's
  exercise endurance capacity. (C) Acupuncture may inhibit the PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway through inhibition of airway smooth muscle cell proliferation. (D) Exercise
  may activate the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway through increasing MMP levels and also
  activate the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, thus improving a patient's exercise endurance
  capacity. NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure;
  VD/VT, tidal volume ratio; PACO2, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial
  blood; V/Q, ventilation-perfusion ratio; VO2, volume of consumed oxygen.
