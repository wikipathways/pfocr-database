caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed signaling in RBCs from patients with
  STEMI. RBCs from patients with STEMI induce cardioprotective effects via a mechanism
  dependent on NOS activation and sGC. Activation of purinergic signaling by ATP via
  the P2Y13 receptor results in activation of the NO–sGC pathway within the RBCs which
  leads to the signaling of still unexplored mechanism(s) (dashed arrow) to activate
  PKG in the cardiomyocytes resulting in cardioprotection. ATP adenosine triphosphate,
  eNOS endothelial nitric oxide synthase, L-arg L-arginine, NO nitric oxide, PKG protein
  kinase G, RBCs red blood cells, sGC soluble guanylyl cyclase, STEMI ST-elevation
  myocardial infarction
