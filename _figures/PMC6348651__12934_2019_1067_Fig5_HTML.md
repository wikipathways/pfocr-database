caption: The Succinate synthesis pathway in the electroactive E. coli T110 assisted
  by CCM. A succinate synthesis pathway was constructed mainly by eliminating competing
  fermentation pathways and activating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Using CCM,
  PCK and PPC were supplemented with increased amounts of CO2. In the electroactive
  E. coli T110 chassis, electricity from the MES system was utilized for increased
  succinate production
