caption: 'Biosynthesis and unsaturation of fatty acids until EPA predicted from the
  metabolic annotation. Detailed legend: The biosynthesis predicted from the metabolic
  annotation in P. irregulare CBS 494.86 occurs in the cyclic process by elongation
  from 2C (Acetyl-acp) to 16C (Hexadecanol-acp), where two carbons from Malonyl-acp
  are incorporated in the fatty acids per cycle. The process involves fatty acid enzymes
  from types I (IFAS) and II (II FAS). The enzymatic complex II FAS is composed of
  two subunits Fas1 (or Fasβ) and Fas2 (or Fasα). The cyclic process involves 4 steps:
  initiation/elongation (where two carbons of Malonyl-acp are incorporated); reduction
  (where the first NADPH is reduced to NADP+); dehydration (where there is H2O liberation);
  and reduction (where the second NADPH is reduced to NADP+). The cyclic process is
  concluded when Hexadecanol-acp is produced, and converted into Hexadecanol-CoA by
  the FAS2 enzyme, fatty acid synthase subunit beta (2.3.1.86). The next steps involve
  unsaturation, by elongation and desaturation processes. The representative figure
  shows (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-Icosapentaenoyl-CoA conversion into EPA by long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA
  ligase and its export by 2.A.126# transporter family. The red dashed line marks
  the end unsaturated fatty acid (C18:1) produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae; the
  green dashed line the Yarrowia lipolytica end fatty acid (γ-linolenic acid - C18:2);
  the purple dashed line the A. thaliana end fatty acid (α-linoleic acid - C18:3);
  and the blue dashed lines, metabolites, encoded enzymes, and reactions, which demonstrate
  the M. alpine pathway into EPA'
