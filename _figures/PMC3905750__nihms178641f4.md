caption: Mitochondrial bioenergetic coupling with the epigenome. The flow of reducing
  equivalents (calories) through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation regulates
  levels of cellular ATP and acetyl-CoA. High-calorie intake increases ATP and acetyl-CoA
  levels, thereby increasing histone phosphorylation and acetylation. This opens the
  chromatin to stimulate transcription, growth, and replication. Acetylation also
  regulates major signal transduction pathways, including the insulin signaling pathway.
  Forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factors that regulate expression of PGC-1α,
  the key transcription factor to regulate mitochondrial OXPHOS and biogenesis, can
  be acetylated and inactivated. During carbohydrate metabolism by glycolysis (Glyc),
  the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio increases, thus limiting NAD+ availability for Sirt1-mediated
  FOXO and PGC-1α deacetylation. This inhibits FOXOs and PGC-1α, which down-regulate
  mitochondrial OXPHOS and biogenesis. Fatty acid and ketone body oxidation within
  the mitochondrion leaves the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ more oxidized, thereby stimulating
  Sirt1-mediated deacetylation and activation of FOXOs and PGC-1α, causing up-regulation
  of mitochondrial OXPHOS. Thus, the availability and nature of calories directly
  regulates the epigenome and modulates the bioenergetic pathways required for optimal
  caloric exploitation. (AcCoA) Acetyl-CoA, (AcAc) acetylaldehyde, (BOB) β-hydroxybutyrate,
