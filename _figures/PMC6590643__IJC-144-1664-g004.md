caption: (a) Simplified figure depicting the roles of RORC consensus pathway members,
  adapted from Yu et al. (2009) and Muranski and Restifo (2013). The figure was produced
  using Servier Medical Art (http://www.servier.com) and edited using Inkscape software.
  (b) The RORC consensus pathway was validated using STRING protein–protein interaction,
  GO biological process and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Significant enrichment
  (genome‐wide FDR < 0.05) is shown for “Positive regulation of cytokine production”
  (red), “Regulation of T‐helper cell differentiation” (purple), “Th17 immune response”
  (green), “Jak‐STAT signaling pathway” (yellow), “Pathways in cancer” (magenta),
  “HTLV‐1 infection” (dark green) and “Viral carcinogenesis” (turquoise). [Color figure
