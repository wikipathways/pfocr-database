caption: 'Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling pathway. ( "->"
  : activation, "-●": inhibition). Binding of IGF-1 or IGF-2 or insulin to the IGF-1R
  α-subunit leads to autophosphorylation of β-subunit residues, which then act as
  docking site to insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1 to 4). Bound IRS-1 results in
  PI3K activation, which in turn activates Akt. The tumor suppressor phosphates and
  tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) inhibits PI3K. Activated Akt has
  many substrates; in one pathway Akt inhibits apoptosis by inactivating BCL-2 antagonist
  of cell death (BAD), and in the second pathway Akt regulates protein synthesis by
  phosphorylating tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2). This phosphorylation removes
  the inhibition of TSC from mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR activates
  the ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1
  (4E-BP-1), leading to protein synthesis. In energy depletion expression of the suppressor
  gene LKB1 and AMP raise. AMPK is activated by both mechanisms. AMPK inhibits protein
  synthesis through direct inhibition of mTOR or indirectly by activating the TSC
  complex. Hypoxia induces REDD1.The detailed interaction between REDD1 and TSC is
  not clear yet. We conclude that the inhibition of HIF-α by TSC might be independent
  of REDD1. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway can also be activated
  by IGF-1R activation. In this pathway IGF-1R activates the adaptor proteins, Shc
  and Grb2, leading to activation of Ras, Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, which results in
  cell proliferation.'
