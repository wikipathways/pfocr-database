caption: Illustration of LAID nanoplatform for the theranostics of early-stage vulnerable
  plaques in atherosclerosis. A) The construction of LAID nanoplatform. B) The theranostic
  procedure including the active targeting, the ROS and acid dual-triggered disassembly,
  the X-CT based plaque location, the lipid recognition with fluorescent imaging,
  and the lipid-inflammation integrated regulation via inhibited lipid uptake and
  blocked NF-κB pathway
