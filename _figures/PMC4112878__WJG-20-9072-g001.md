caption: Endoplasmatic reticulum stress caused by saturated free fatty acids. Endoplasmatic
  reticulum stress caused by saturated free fatty acids, via three main mediators
  [inositol-requiring endoplasmic reticulum-to-nucleus signal kinase 1α (IRE1α), activating
  transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and RNA-dependent protein kinase (PRK)-like endoplasmic
  roticulum (ER) kinase (PERK)], results in the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) and C/ CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (EBP) homologous protein. The sequence
  of BH3 protein activation based on a sensitizer and an activator group was described
  by Gurzov and Eizirik in β-cells[,]. The sensitizers bind the anti-apoptotic proteins
  Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 and release the activators from this bond. JNK both mediates
  the induction of the sensitizer and the activator BH3 proteins and also activates
  Bax. Upregulation of Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) and p53 upregulated
  modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) was also demonstrated in liver cells as a ruslt of
  free fatty acid (FFA) induction. Proinflammatory cytokines also activate JNK. ER
  sterss also results in CHOP actvation and subsequently the activation of the activator
  BH3 proteins. This complex signaling pathway might link the metabolic (saturated
  FFAs) stress and the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines both in the pancreatic
  β-cell as well as in liver cells.
