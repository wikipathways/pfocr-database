caption: 'miRNA- and TF-mediated sub-network specific to the TGF-β signaling pathway.
  (A) The network consisted of four modules (Modules 1–4). Module 4 contains three
  miRNAs (miR-17-5p, miR-9-5p, and miR-130b-3p), two TFs (IRF1 and ZEB1), and one
  gene (TGFBR2). Edges with different colors represent their validation status as
  assessed using three independent data sets. Blue edge: Regulations were strongly
  validated by three independent data sets; black edge: strongly validated by two
  independent data sets; red edge: validated by two independent data sets; and, green
  edge: either not validated or do not exist commonly in all the three validation
  data sets. Strong validation is defined as a Spearman rank correlation P-value <
  0.05. (B) Bar plot illustrates percentage of validated targets for four modules.
  The x-axis represents the four modules. The y-axis represents percentage of validated
  targets observed for each module.'
