caption: Therapeutic agents targeting ISGs. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway, activated
  by various stimuli, leads to the expression of ISGs such as ISG15, ISG20, and PKR,
  which have been implicated in various forms of kidney injury. ISG15 is associated
  with CKD, UUO, and AKI, while ISG20 plays a role specifically in AKI. PKR, which
  can be inhibited by imoxin, contributes to kidney injury in L-NAME-induced models.
  Targeting this pathway with JAK inhibitors like ruxolitinib and baricitinib offers
  promising therapeutic potential by disrupting the cascade that leads to ISG expression
  and subsequent renal damage. These findings highlight the importance of ISGs as
  therapeutic targets and underscore the potential of pathway-specific inhibitors
  in mitigating kidney injury and fibrosis
