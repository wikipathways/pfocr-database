caption: Statin therapy for coronary heart disease. In the vascular epithelial cells,
  the key effectors are Rac1 and RhoA protein in the mevalonate pathway, Rac1 can
  maintain the stability of the cytoskeleton and promote cell migration via regulating
  NOX, and RhoA protein can keep from the ubiquitin degradation of p27, inhibit cell
  cycle progression. As the inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, statins are able
  to inhibiting the formation of Rac1 and RhoA. Meanwhile, statins can also prevent
  the transition of G1-S phase through inhibiting CDK2. Moreover, statins inhibit
  cell proliferation by depressing the transcription of MCM6 and MCM7.
