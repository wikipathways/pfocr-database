caption: Summary of the results from this study showing upstream and downstream factors
  of NFKB factors in CTCL cell lines HH and HUT-78. Chromosomal aberrations are indicated
  above. Factors and functions are shown for NFkB signaling (indicated in blue), NOTCH
  signaling (red), p53 pathway (green), and NK-cell differentiation (black).
