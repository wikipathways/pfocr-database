caption: Integrated view of mammalian autophagy. Autophagy is initiated (1) by the
  nucleation of the phagophore, also called isolation membrane. This membrane vesicle
  then elongates (2) and closes on itself as a double membraned vesicle, the autophagosome.
  It selectively engulfs proteins (black) or organelles such as mitochondria, as well
  as non-selectively a portion of the cytosol. The autophagosome usually fuses with
  endosomes coming from the endocytic pathway (3). The resulting amphisome then fuses
  with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, in which macromolecules and proteins are degraded
  in an acidic environment by lysosomal hydrolases. The Beclin1:hVps35:Atg14L complex
  controls the initiation process, and is regulated by several associated proteins,
  such as Ambra1, Bif-1, UVRAG, or Bcl-2. The kinase hVps34 allows the synthesis of
  phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), which is essential for the phagophore
  formation. In parallel, Atg9 and WIPI proteins contribute also to the nucleation
  and elongation of the phagophore. Below, LC3 proteins (Atg8 orthologs) are cleaved
  by Atg4, and linked to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by the Atg7, Atg3, and Atg12-Atg5:Atg16
  conjugation complex, to be finally included into the autophagosomal membrane. It
  plays a crucial function in the elongation process, and in cargo anchoring to the
  autophagosome inner cavity, with the help of adaptors like p62. The second conjugation
  complex, Atg12-Atg5:Atg16, is bound to the inner and the outer membrane of the elongating
  phagophore, and is supposed to play a role in the elongation as well as the closure
  of the autophagosome.
