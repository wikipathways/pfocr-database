caption: Schematic view of signaling events elicited by LPS in RPE cells. (A) PLD
  activation, ROS generation and NFκB nuclear translocation are part of the inflammatory
  signaling cascade induced in RPE cells exposed to LPS that ultimately leads to cell
  viability loss. RPE cells answer to LPS also involves the induction of the autophagic
  process which mediates cells survival. (B) When PLD1 and PLD2 are inhibited, the
  inflammatory response of RPE cells is reduced and autophagy is enhanced, possibly
  through a reduced phosphatidic acid (PA)-dependent mTORC1 activation, leading to
  RPE cell survival. Dashed arrows and question marks indicate possible but unstudied
  mechanisms.
