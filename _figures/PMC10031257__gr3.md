caption: FA signaling in cartilage. Integrins are transmembrane proteins connecting
  chemical and mechanical stimuli between the outside ECMs and inside of chondrocytes.
  The integrin-mediated signaling pathway is critical for osteoarthritis (OA) development.
  Peptides and fibronectin fragments containing the RGD cell binding sequence can
  bind to integrins and other the FA proteins which promotes expression of a number
  of pro-inflammatory mediators and matrix degrading enzymes. The combined effects
  of increased ligands as a result of cartilage damage may enable cells within OA
  joints to elicit pathogenic responses, and thereby drive the progression of OA.
  In response to integrin activation, PYK2 and/or FAK are recruited to a signaling
  complex that consists of Src, paxillin, vinculin, talin and kindlin, which result
  in activation of PI3K and/or MAPK that may lead to cell adhesion and migration.
  Further, development of OA may result from chronic signaling of inflammatory, catabolic,
  and hypertrophic molecules as well as other integrin effectors as a result of the
  increased levels of both ligand and receptor components following joint injury.
  Furthermore, kindlin-2 is related to mitochondrial oxidative stress and chondrocyte
  catabolism. In addition, kindlin-2 serves as a major controlling factor in the regulation
  of the chondrogenesis during prenatal and postnatal skeletal development by regulating
  TGF-β signalling and Sox 9 expression.
