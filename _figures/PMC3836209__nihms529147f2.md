caption: Adenosine receptors and pathophysiology of asthma. By acting on adenosine
  receptors (ARs), A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 ARs, adenosine released under conditions of
  cellular stress as seen in asthmatic airways produces bronchoconstriction and inflammation.
  The net effect of adenosine on ARs will depend on the relative expression of these
  receptors on different cell types in asthmatic airways, and is concentration-dependent,
  as adenosine frequently exhibits opposing effects through the activation of AR subtypes
  expressed on the same cells coupled to different G proteins and signaling pathways.
  By acting on A1ARs on bronchial smooth muscle cells and afferent sensory airway
  nerves, adenosine produces bronchoconstriction. By acting on A1ARs on inflammatory
  leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes, adenosine
  produces proinflammatory effects. Activation of A2AARs on the inflammatory cells
  suppresses the release of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators. Activation of
  A2AARs coupled to Gs and adenylate cyclase may also lead to bronchial smooth muscle
  relaxation via the cAMP–PKA (cyclic adenosine monophosphate–protein kinase A) pathway.
  Activation of A2BARs coupled to Gs and adenylate cyclase induce cytokine release
  from human bronchial epithelial and smooth muscle cells. Activation of A2BARs on
  murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) regulates the release of cytokines.
  The effect of adenosine on A3ARs is species dependent. In mice, rats, and guinea
  pigs, activation of A3ARs by adenosine produces bronchoconstriction, airway inflammation,
  mast cell degranulation, and mucus hyperplasia. In humans, activation of A3ARs by
  adenosine produces anti-inflammatory effects, inhibition of chemotaxis and degranulation
  of eosinophils and cytokine release from monocytes. Circled times denote inhibition
