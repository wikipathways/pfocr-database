caption: Metabolic flux distributions in the central metabolic pathways of the Ctrl
  and ﾎ馬dhF1 strains during exponential growth phase. The arrows between metabolites
  the direction of the reaction. The numbers accompanying the arrows indicate best-fit
  values of absolute metabolic fluxes. The large arrows indicate biomass formation
  fluxes required for cell synthesis determined from the specific growth rates
