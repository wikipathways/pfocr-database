caption: Models of how IFNβ and GA activate PI3Kδ/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways to induce
  sIL-1Ra production in monocytes. (A) IFNβ binds its specific receptor (IFNAR1-IFNAR2),
  which induces the activation of MEK2 and the translocation of MEK2 and PI3Kδ to
  the membrane. The activation of PI3Kδ/Akt pathway leads to sIL-1Ra production in
  monocytes; Grey kinases and proteins are activated but not implicated in sIL-1Ra
  production. The type 1IFN canonical STAT1 pathway also is dispensable to sIL-1Ra
  production. (B) GA is recognized by a receptor (cell surface) or a sensor (inside
  the cell) that transduces signal via activation of both PI3Kδ/Akt and MEK1/2/ERK1/2
  pathways. The two pathways then converge to phosphorylate/inactivate GSK3, resulting
  in the induction of sIL-1Ra production. This scheme is adapted from reference .
