caption: 'Wnt transduction pathways and their functions during synapse development,
  function and plasticity. (a) Summary of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In
  this pathway, secreted Wnts bind to Fz receptors in the receiving cell. This binding
  activates the scaffolding PDZ protein DVL, which disrupts a so-called ‘destruction
  complex’ containing GSK-3β, axin and APC. In the absence of Wnt signaling, this
  complex constitutively phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its degradation by ubiquitin-dependent
  proteasomal degradation. Wnt binding to Fz receptors disrupts the destruction complex,
  resulting in cytoplasmic stabilization of β-catenin and its import into the nucleus.
  In the nucleus, β-catenin associates with members of the LEF/TCF transcription factor
  family to regulate transcription. Also depicted are a Wnt antagonist FRP and an
  inhibitor of GSK-3, frequently rearranged in advanced T-cell lymphomas–GSK-3-binding
  protein (Frat–GBP), which can also bind to DVL. (b) The Wnt–Ca2+signaling pathway.
  In this pathway, Fz activation by Wnts leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ and
  nuclear import of the transcription factor NF-AT. (c) The Frizzled nuclear import
  (FNI) pathway. In this signaling pathway, Wnts binds to Fz2 receptors in the receiving
  cell. Fz is endocytosed and back-transported towards the nucleus in a process that
  depends on its binding to the 7-PDZ protein GRIP. At some point during this trafficking,
  the C-terminal region of Fz2 is cleaved, and the cleaved fragment imported into
  the nucleus. (d) The divergent canonical Wnt pathway. In this signaling pathway,
  Wnt binding to Fz inhibits the destruction complex, and prevents the phosphorylation
  of microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP1B, Tau and MAP2, thereby regulating
  microtubule stability. (e) The PCP pathway. In this transduction pathway, Fz acts
  through JNK to regulate the cytoskeleton. Abbreviations: CAMKII, calcium–calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor; PKC, protein kinase C.'
