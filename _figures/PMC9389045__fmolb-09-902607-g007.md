caption: 'Interaction gene-miRNAs network of ferroptosis DEGs related to the HIF-1
  signaling pathway in Cluster 1. Genes and miRNAs are presented as circular nodes
  (both in blue and yellow) and triangular nodes in red, respectively, and the miRNAs
  predicted by the miRTarBase database are colored in yellow. Abbreviations: DEGs,
  differentially expressed genes.'
