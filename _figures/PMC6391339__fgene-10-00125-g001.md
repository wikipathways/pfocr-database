caption: Biogenesis of miRNAs. In the canonical pathway, miRNAs are transcribed from
  their loci by RNA polymerase II into a long primary transcript of about 80 nucleotides
  called the pri-miRNA. Cleavage follows and is done by Drosha, a type III RNase along
  with the DGCR8 protein to produce pre-miRNA. In the non-canonical pathway, Mirtrons
  are spliced by the spliceosome to form looped intermediates referred to as lariat
  which then refold into pre-miRNAs. Next, the exportin 5, a RAN-GTP dependent transporter,
  mediates the movement of pre-miRNAs from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Further
  processing by Dicer and TARBP2 protein generates mature miRNAs, producing double-stranded
  structure of miRNA of about 21-22 nt in length. The duplex is loaded into an AGO
  protein. The passenger strand (miRNA∗) is degraded, whereas the guide strand is
  incorporated by the Ago into the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). In animals,
  imperfect complementarity occurs when the miRNA seed region, nucleotides 2-8, BPs
  perfectly with the complementary seed match site in the 3′ UTR of the target mRNA
  resulting in translational repression or degradation. GW182 a core component of
  miRISC, mediates deadenylation of mRNAs by interacting with AGO and PABP consequently
  leading to recruitment of deadenylases like CCR4 and CAF1. Translation repression
  can result from inhibited binding of PABP to the poly (A) tail of the mRNA, responsible
  for attracting the elFs to mRNA to initiate translation. The formation of the CCR4-CAF1-NOT
  complex, a poly A tail-truncating enzyme, mediated by binding of miRISC to mRNA
  results in truncation of the downstream poly A tail, reduced binding of translation
  initiation factors and translation repression. The shortening or complete removal
  of the poly (A) tail induces the removal of the 5′ cap of the mRNA. Decapping is
  also mediated by DCP1 and DCP2. Consequently, the uncapped mRNA is rapidly degraded
  by 5′-3′ exoribonucleases.
