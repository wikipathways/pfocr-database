caption: Summary of oocyte-granulosa cell and granulosa-granulosa signaling interactions.
  BMP15 and GDF9 are expressed from the oocyte and bind to receptors on granulosa
  cells, while kit ligand (KL) is regulated in the granulosa cells and binds to the
  kit receptor on the oocyte to stimulating oocyte growth and survival, at least in
  part through the PI3K pathway. BMP2, BMP4, and AMH signal in a paracrine/autocrine
  manner from granulosa cells to neighboring granulosa cells. The Gremlins are secreted
  from granulosa cells and directly bind BMP2, BMP4, and AMH to modulate their activity
  and potentially set up morphogen gradients within the somatic cells of the follicle.
  Pathways that regulate Amh expression are not fully know, but include the H19/let-7
  system.
