caption: PRV evades the IFNAR–JAK–STAT signaling pathway. Type I IFNs exert their
  antiviral effects by binding to their heterodimeric receptors, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2,
  thereby activating the downstream JAK–STAT signaling pathway, which promotes the
  production of ISGs. Some ISGs, such as ISG15, can also enhance the JAK–STAT signaling
  pathway to upregulate the production of interferon-stimulated factors and increase
  antiviral activity. PRV-encoded proteins target components of the IFNAR–JAK–STAT
  signaling pathway to inhibit signal transduction or directly interact with ISGs,
  facilitating immune evasion
