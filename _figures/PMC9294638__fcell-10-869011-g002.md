caption: A schematic diagram of the role of several lncRNAs in the modulation of cellular
  senescence through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Accumulating evidence has illustrated
  that various lncRNAs are important regulatory factors in the biological aging. It
  has been reported that lncRNA H19 via directly targeting miR-22 could promote H2O2-induced
  deregulation in nucleus pulposus cell senescence, proliferation, and ECM synthesis
  through Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade. Thereby, lncRNA H19 could enhance the expression
  levels of LEF1, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 in NPCs (). Moreover, another research has
  figured out that lncRNA-p21 via downregulating β-catenin expression could regulate
  cellular senescence in mesenchymal stem cells (). Green lines indicate the positive
  regulatory effect among lncRNAs and their targets, and red lines depict negative
  one among them.
