caption: 'Wnt protein binding to seven transmembrane Frizzled receptors leads to the
  recruitment of Axin to the plasma membrane and phosphorylation of its co-receptor,
  low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) 5/6 by casein kinase-1α (CK1α)
  and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), leading to activation of Dishevelled (Dvl)
  and destabilization of a β-catenin destruction complex. The destruction complex
  consists of Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), CK1α and GSK3β. Hypophosphorylated
  β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and is able to translocate to the nucleus,
  where it interacts with TCF/LEF to displace its co-repressors and recruit either
  positive or negative transcription co-factors to regulate Wnt target genes. Active
  β-catenin can also bind to cadherins at the cell membrane to regulate cellular adhesion.
  In the absence of Wnt binding to frizzled and LRP5/6, cytosolic β-catenin is phosphorylated
  by the destruction complex and undergoes βTrcp-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation. Image is slightly modified and reprinted from (), copyright © J Neuroimmune
