caption: The pathway information and gene annotations were obtained from the Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database. Genes that are down-regulated
  (≥1.5 fold), up-regulated (≥1.5 fold) or unchanged during development are shown
  in green, red, and black, respectively. Blue denotes genes that were not on the
  microarray. A dashed arrow between two compound names implies that the two names
  represent the same compound in different stages of polymerization or depolymerization.
