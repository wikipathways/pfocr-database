caption: Mechanistic links involved in the gut microbiota promoting carcinogenesis
  of CRC. Interactions between the gut microbiota and host contribute to the alterations
  at the molecular level, such as the biosynthesis of toxins interfering with the
  regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by Wnt/β-Catenin and NF-κB/STAT3
  signaling pathway, or damaging DNA by producing SPO, or regulating autophagy, that
  ultimately lead to the onset and progression of CRC. BFT, B. fragilis toxin; FadA,
  F. nucleatum adhesin A; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; SPO, spermine oxidase; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; TLR4, toll-like receptors 4; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa
  B; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
