caption: Affected protein networks were identified using the 40 differentially expressed
  proteins together with APP and TAU (MAPT) identified in the study by IPA. (A–F)
  Up-regulated proteins are shown in red, and down-regulated proteins in green. (A)
  Cell signaling and cellular function and maintenance was the most affected network.
  (B) The identified proteins were found to produce an over-activation of networks
  involving lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and dexamethasone. (C) Among the most affected
  cellular functions, cell activation and the calcium amount were predicted to be
  activated, together with alterations in behavior (D). (E) A lesser activation of
  TGFβ-mediated networks was predicted, and (F) the production of reactive oxygen
  species was predicted to be inhibited, when APP and Tau were removed from the dataset
  for the analysis. Fx, function; CP, cell process.
