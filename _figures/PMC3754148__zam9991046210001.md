caption: Schematic of the effect of compounds on T3SS regulation in E. amylovora.
  Solid lines indicate direct regulation (protein-protein interaction or direct binding
  to the promoter region), and dashed lines indicate indirect regulation or hypothetical
  regulatory links based on evidence shown in E. amylovora or other plant-pathogenic
  bacteria. IM and OM, inner and outer membrane, respectively. Based on genetic analysis
  in E. amylovora and biochemical evidence obtained with P. stewartii (), HrpX/Y forms
  a two-component system that activates the transcription of hrpL (). HrpL activates
  the expression of the T3SS genes such as hrpA and hrpN (, ). HrpS is a σ54 enhancer-binding
  protein that activates the transcription of hrpL, independent of HrpXY (, ). Based
  on the two-component system study in E. amylovora and the evidences in P. syringae
  (, ), it is suggested that in E. amylovora, the GacAS two-component system may activate
  transcription of hrpS. Also, based on previous work in P. carotovorum () and the
  evidence of the functional homolog of rsmB found in E. amylovora E9 (), the rsmB-RsmA
  system may regulate the T3SS by affecting the stability of hrpL mRNA in E. amylovora.
  In this study, we observed that TMCA, BA, and EHPES significantly alter the hrpA
  promoter activity through HrpS-HrpL pathway. In addition, TMCA alters the T3SS expression
  through the rsmBEa-RsmAEapathway.
