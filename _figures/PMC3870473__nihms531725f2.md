caption: Microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) can be recognized as
  non-self by the host and include compounds such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan
  (PGN), bacterial flagellin and bacterial outer-membrane proteins (Omps). MAMPs can
  initiate signalling cascades by first interacting with pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other Toll–interleukin 1 receptor
  (TIR) domain-containing proteins, peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), Gram-negative
  bacteria-binding proteins (GNBPs) and LPS-binding proteins (LBPs). Hydra spp. also
  possess Hydra leucine-rich-repeat proteins (HyLRRs), which function with Hydra TIR
  domain-containing proteins (HyTRRs) to recognize MAMPs (although the specific family
  members that function as receptors in this pathway have not yet been determined).
  Other signals that can trigger immune responses are damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs), which might result from physical tissue damage and the release
  of compounds such as monosodium urate (MSU). In Hydra spp., DAMPs can interact with
  HyLRR-2, which functions with a HyTRR to initiate immune signalling. Both MAMP-
  and DAMP-mediated signalling can initiate signalling cascades, usually through the
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or similar pathway, that lead to the activation of immune
  responses such as haemocyte trafficking and phagocytosis; induction of the complement
  pathway; and production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). OM, outer membrane.
