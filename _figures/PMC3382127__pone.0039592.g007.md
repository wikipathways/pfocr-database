caption: TLR3 signaling induces cytokine expression and mediates the internalization
  of both CXCR4 and CXCR7, as well as the degradation of CXCR4. A JAK2/STAT1 pathway
  is also activated, and subsequent upregulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 inhibits TLR3-mediated
  signaling by targeting different branches of the signaling pathways. SOCS1 inhibits
  STAT1 phosphorylation and CXCR7 internalization, while SOCS3 inhibits IRF1 upregulation
  and the internalization of both CXCR4 and CXCR7.
