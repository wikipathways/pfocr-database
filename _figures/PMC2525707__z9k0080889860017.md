caption: Proposed model of spectral and temporal processing pathways in primate auditory
  cortex. In the proposed model, the temporal processing pathway is in the caudal-to-rostral
  axis, where AI has the smallest temporal integration window and this temporal integration
  window increases in R and RT. The spectral processing pathway is in the medial-to-lateral
  axis, where AI and the other core fields have the smallest spectral integration
  window, and belt and parabelt areas have larger spectral integration windows. AI,
  primary auditory cortex; R, rostral field; RT, rostrotemporal field; ML, middle
  lateral field; AL, anterolateral field; RL, rostrolateral field; f, frequency, t,
  time.
