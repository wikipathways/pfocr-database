caption: Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog signalling pathways. Wnt/β-catenin signalling
  is transmitted through the Frizzled (FZD) receptor, thereby stabilizing β-catenin.
  Phosphorylated β-catenin translocated into the nucleus to regulate the expression
  of target genes. There is crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin signalling and Notch/TGF-β
  signalling. In Notch signalling, binding of Notch ligands to the receptor results
  in two proteolytic cleavages to release NICD. The released NICD then translocated
  into the nucleus, activating transcription factors Hes1, JAG1, and JAG2, whilst
  the Notch signal pathway interacts with Hh and Wnt signalling pathways. In Hedgehog
  signalling, Hh ligand secreted by Hedgehog secretory cells binds to PTCH or SMO
  and generates activated Gli that translocated to the nucleus, inducing target gene
  expression. These main survival pathways and sophisticated interactions between
  signalling pathways (i.e., TGF-β and MAPKs) constitute a complex regulatory network
  for the survival and proliferation of BECs.
