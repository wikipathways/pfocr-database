caption: (A-B) Hypothetical model of H2O2-induced neuronal activation, based on our
  data and on previous studies. Schematic drawing of a presynaptic button in I2 (A)
  and PHA (B) neurons, illustrating the presumptive H2O2-PRDX-2-mediated neuronal
  activation in both cases (modelled in ). High doses of H2O2 (1mM) are sensed by
  both neurons, but only PHA neurons respond to 10μM H2O2, as illustrated in red.
  In this model, H2O2 would freely diffuse through the neuron plasma membrane and
  oxidize PRDX-2, presumably leading to LITE-1 or GUR-3 activation. Receptor activation
  is likely relayed by cGMP signaling, resulting in the opening of voltage-gated calcium
  channels (in grey) and neurotransmitter release (glutamate in both cases), triggering
  an adapted response. In PHA neurons, the PMK-1/p38MAPK pathway is additionally required
  to promote neuronal response to micromolar doses of H2O2, potentially through OSM-9
  phosphorylation, as observed in ASH neurons []. See  for further details and bibliographic
  references.
