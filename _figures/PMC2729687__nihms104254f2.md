caption: The immunological synapse or the interface between an antigen presenting
  cell and a T-cell. The four confirmed APS3v susceptibility genes participate in
  the immunological synapse. These include the HLA-DR genes which present the autoantigens
  to T-cells, the CTLA-4 gene, an important co-stimulatory molecule which suppresses
  T-cell activation, the PTPN22 gene which negatively regulates the T-cell receptor
  signaling pathway, and the FOXP3 gene which is the key regulator of the differentiation
  of regulatory T cells.
