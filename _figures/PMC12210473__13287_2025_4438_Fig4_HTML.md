caption: Hh activation (left panel) and inhibition (right panel) signaling pathways
  [45]. Binding of Hh ligands, SHh, IHh, or DHh to PTCH at the cell surface causes
  PTCH to exit the primary cilium, thereby relieving its inhibition of SMO. Activated
  SMO enters the cilium and initiates a signaling cascade that converts Gli transcription
  factors into their active forms. These activated Gli proteins translocate to the
  nucleus, promoting the expression of Hh target genes. (B) In the absence of Hh ligands,
  PTCH remains localized in the primary cilium and inhibits SMO, blocking downstream
  signaling. Gli transcription factors are maintained in their repressor forms, preventing
  Hh target gene expression. Figure created with icons from biorender.com
