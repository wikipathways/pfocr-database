caption: Correlation between CXCL12 and AKI. Various pathological stimuli induce HIF-1α,
  which enhances the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, ultimately improving AKI regeneration. On
  the one hand, the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis promotes angiogenesis by VEGF and eNOS-mediated
  BMCs differentiation into ECs, SP cells-initiated recovery via Shh/Gli 1-ABCG2 pathway.
  In addition, diverse signaling pathways are also involved, such as PI3K and JNK/STAT
  signaling pathways. Additionally, the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis also increases tubular cell
  proliferation due to BMCs differentiation into the tubular epithelia and diverse
  pathways activation, such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk signaling pathways. Furthermore,
  CXCL12-induced inflammatory infiltration including neutrophils infiltration, T-cell
  depletion, and macrophage initiation is also involved in AKI. AKI, acute kidney
  injury; EC, endothelial cell; BMC, bone marrow-derived cell; eNOS, endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase; SP, side population; TEC, tubular epithelia cell.
