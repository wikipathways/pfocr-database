caption: Illustration of the multiple signalling pathways for TGF-β in the VSMC In
  the normal state, TGF-β is sequestered by microfibrils, bound to fibrillin-1 through
  LTBP-1 and fibulin-4 interactions, until its required release. Mechanical stimuli
  encourage MAGP-1 to competitively bind fibrillin-1, inhibiting binding of the TGF-β/LTBP-1
  complex (LLC). Once released, free active TGF-β can interact with its cell surface
  receptors, binding to the TGF-βR heterodimer and activating the canonical pathway
  (Smad) or non-canonical pathway (MAPK/ ERK) in the correct ratio, resulting in balanced
  activation of transcription factors. Pathological levels of free active TGF-β disrupts
  the homeostatic balance between the two pathways to favour signalling through the
  non-canonical pathway. (Adapted from (Ramirez and Sakai ; Jeremy et al. )
