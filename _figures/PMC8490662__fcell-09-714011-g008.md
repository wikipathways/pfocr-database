caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the underlying mechanism of macrophage-mediated
  bone formation in DBM modified by hucMSC-ECM. Briefly, DBM-ECM-induced bone regeneration
  depends on the osteogenic niche constructed by macrophage-derived paracrine molecules.
  MIF highly deposited in the DBM-ECM scaffolds activates CD74/CD44 expression in
  macrophages, subsequently enhances the phosphorylation of P38 and finally upregulates
  the expression of multiple osteoinductive cytokines, including FGF2, TGFβ3 and OSM,
  in macrophages, which directs the osteogenesis of BMSCs and promotes bone regeneration.
