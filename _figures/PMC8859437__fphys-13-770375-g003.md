caption: Cellular mechanisms leading to increased aldosterone production upon angiotensin
  II, ACTH, and K+ stimulation. Ang II binds to AT1R, leading to dissociation of the
  alpha subunit and activation of PLC. PLC hydrolyses PIP2 into DAG and IP3. IP3 binds
  to its receptor on the SER leading to the release of Ca2+ stores. Ca2+ activates
  CaMK, which causes an increase in ADS expression through CREB. DAG activates PKC
  to phosphorylate Src, which phosphorylates EGFR leading to activation of p42/p44
  mitogen-activating protein kinase pathway. P42/p44 phosphorylates CEH to hydrolyze
  cholesterol esters located in the lipid droplets, making them available for transport
  to the inner mitochondrial membrane by STAR. PKC also phosphorylates and activates
  STAR. Cholesterol is used for aldosterone synthesis. ACTH binds its ACTHR leading
  to the activation of adenylate cyclase, which produces cAMP from ATP. cAMP triggers
  PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of STAR. PKA also phosphorylates L and
  T type Ca2+ channels causing Ca2+ influx. PKA increases the expression of ADS through
  relieving SF1-mediated inhibition of STAR. High extracellular K+ concentration depolarizes
  cells and leads to activation of L and T type Ca2+ channels, which allow calcium
  inflow from the extracellular space. ANG II, angiotensin II; AT1R, angiotensin II
  receptor type 1; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate; SER, smooth
  endoplasmic reticulum; CaMK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; ADS, aldosterone
  synthase; CREB, cAMP-response element binding protein; PKC, protein kinase C; EGFR,
  epidermal growth factor receptor; CEH, cholesterol ester hydrolase; STAR, steroid
  acute regulatory protein; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; ACTHR, adrenocorticotropic
