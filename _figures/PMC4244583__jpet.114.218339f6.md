caption: Schematic representation of intracellular signaling pathways that mediate
  early and late biphasic changes in paracellular claudin-5 expression. This study
  suggests that the early reversible and late loss of paracellular claudin-5 expression
  in bEnd.3 endothelial cells is mediated through two different intracellular pathways.
  Pathway I is PI3K/AKT-dependent. Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K with LY294002
  (25 μM) or PI-828 (10 μM) attenuated AKT (Thr308) phosphorylation and prevented
  early reversible loss of paracellular claudin-5 expression. The early reversible
  change in paracellular claudin-5 morphology was also prevented by AKT inhibitors
  10-DEBC (10 μM) or AKT1 (25 μM). Pathway II is PI3K-dependent/AKT-independent. Pharmacologic
  inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 (25 μM) or PI-828 (10 μM) also prevented late loss
  of paracellular claudin-5 expression. However, this pathway is independent of AKT
  activation because AKT inhibitors 10-DEBC (10 μM) and AKT1 (25 μM) did not prevent
  the loss of paracellular claudin-5 expression seen at 1, 2, and 3 days.
