caption: Identification of enzymes associated with the sulfuric acid biosynthesis
  pathway. (A) Pathway for biosynthesis of sulfuric acid. Those enzymes identified
  within the anterior lobe of the Charonia tritonis salivary gland are shown as (i),
  (ii) and (iii). (B) Schematics showing enzymes (i), (ii) and (iii) including characteristic
  domains. Biosynthetic enzymes derived from C. tritonis are listed in Supplementary
  Data .
