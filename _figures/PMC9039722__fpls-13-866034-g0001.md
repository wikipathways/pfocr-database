caption: 'Schematic diagram of the cold-responsive molecular networks in Arabidopsis
  (A) and maize (B). The eight green dashed arrows that point to (A) from (B) indicate
  that the maize genes were functionally verified in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.
  The orange dashed arrows in (B) indicate that the maize genes were functionally
  studied in tobacco. The blue dashed arrow in (B) indicates that the Arabidopsis
  gene AtICE1 was transformed into forage maize. The colored ellipses represent molecular
  elements that belong to the ICE-CBF-COR pathway. Small dots represent osmotic substances.
  Brackets encompass genes with the same induction level. Straight and dashed arrows
  represent positive regulation, whereas lines ending with a bar represent negative
  regulation. At, Arabidopsis thaliana L.; Zm, Zea mays L.; Zmm, Zea mays ssp. mexicana
  L.; Nt: Nicotiana tabacum L.; CAMTA, Calmodulin-binding transcription activator;
  ZAT, Zinc-finger transcription factor; HSFC, Heat shock transcription factor C;
  JAZ, Jasmonate ZIM-domain; DREB, Dehydration responsive element binding factor;
  LTI, Low temperature induced; KIN, Cold inducible; MPK, Mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; SEC14P, Sec14-like protein; RR, Response regulator; DBP, Dehydration responsive
  element binding protein; CesA, Cellulose synthase; MKK, Mitogen-activated protein
