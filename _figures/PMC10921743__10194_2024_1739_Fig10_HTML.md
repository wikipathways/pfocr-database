caption: Mechanism of AMPK involvement in central sensitization of chronic migraine.
  The expression of AMPK decreases in the TNC region of the NTG-induced CM mouse model,
  and the increased expression of UHRF1 may block the abnormal activation of AMPK
  caused by an increase in the ADP/ATP ratio. Activation of AMPK can inhibit the synthesis
  of CGRP and inhibit the activation of the NF-kB pathway, leading to microglia M2-type
  polarization, thereby inhibiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1-β,
  IL-6, and TNF-α and promoting the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4
  and IL-10 to alleviate central sensitization
