caption: A scheme of the cholesterol synthesis pathway. 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme
  A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) is the rate-controlling enzyme of the mevalonate
  pathway involved in cholesterol synthesis. This pathway also produces the biosynthesis
  of isoprenoids. The main target of statins is the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.
