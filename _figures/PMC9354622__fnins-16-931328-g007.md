caption: Interacting signaling pathways within the ASH neuron regulate the strength
  of sensory responses. The sensory activation pathway (gold) depolarizes the neuron,
  leading to synaptic vesicle release and excitatory signaling to downstream aversive
  locomotory circuitry. Ca2+ entering through L-VGCCs, responsible for optically measurable
  somal Ca2+ transients, provides negative feedback on depolarization (dashed box).
  5-HT signaling (red) inhibits this Ca2+-mediated inhibition, and therefore disinhibits
  depolarization. Finally, OA signaling (blue) blocks sensory-dependent depolarization
  through OCTR-1, Go, and GIRK channels. Identity of signaling proteins indicated
  by text above and below pathways. Corresponding mutants shown in parentheses.
