caption: 'Literature-based connections among genes in altered modules of head and
  neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC patients were classified according to
  pathologic lymph node status (positive or negative) or tumor recurrence (recurrent
  or non-recurrent tumor) after treatment (surgery with neck dissection followed by
  radiotherapy). Gene expression was assessed by microarray and functional module
  analysis was performed. Functional modules were defined according to the following
  databases: Biocarta], GeneDecks, Gene Ontology, and to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes Pathway Database (KEGGPD). A module is considered to be induced
  or repressed when it contains a fraction of induced or repressed genes that is higher
  than expected. The p-value of this fraction was calculated using hypergeometric
  distribution and a false discovery rate of 5% was applied to correct multiple testing.
  Corrected p-values ranged between 4.1 × 10-20 and 2.1 × 10-2. Filled arrows represent
  gene connections described in KEGGPD and dotted arrows, connections described elsewhere
  (see Discussion for references). Pointed arrows represent activation of gene expression
  or protein activity, and blunt arrows, inhibition.'
