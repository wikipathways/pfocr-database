caption: The TRAIL-induced cell death pathway and its regulation. Interaction of TRAIL
  with DR4 and DR5 leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein, FADD, which then
  binds pro-caspase-8 and/or -10 leading to their activation. Activated caspase-8/-10
  are released from the DISC into the cytoplasm, where they activate the downstream,
  effector caspases, which by cleaving vital proteins commit the cell to die. Caspase-8
  can also cleave the BH3-only protein, Bid thus activating it. Truncated Bid (tBid)
  then binds and activates Bax and Bak, leading to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization
  and release of apoptotic factors such as Cyt c and Smac into the cytosol. Cyt c
  binds to APAF-1 thus initiating its oligomerization and recruitment of pro-caspase-9.
  The formed protein complex is called the apoptosome, serving as an activation platform
  for pro-caspase-9. Activated caspase-9 cleaves and activates the effector caspases,
  caspase-3/-6/-7, thus amplifying the DR-initiated apoptotic signal. Apoptosis signaling
  is kept under control at all stages of the process. First, decoy receptors (DcR1,
  DcR2) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) can sequester TRAIL thus preventing DR4/5 activation.
  cFLIP can interact and inhibit pro-caspase-8 in the DISC. At the mitochondrion,
  antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, e.g., Bcl-2 itself and Bcl-xL inhibit Smac and Cyt
  c release. XIAP can inhibit caspase-3/-7/-9 activation; while Smac can block XIAP,
  thus allowing the apoptotic program to progress. TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand; DR, death receptor; OPG, osteoprotegerin; DcR, decoy
