caption: Oxidative stress response determines pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
  cell survival in the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment augments
  cancer metabolic flows of glycolysis and glutaminolysis; the former contributes
  to the Warburg effect and activation of PPP, which gives rise to the production
  of biomass such as nucleotides and lipids. The dysfunction of SIRT3 results in the
  stimulation of the HIF pathway, whereas the dysfunction of SIRT6 induces the transcription
  of glycolytic genes and glutaminase. The inevitable production of ROS from the mitochondria
  of living cells was reduced by GSH, which can lead to ferroptosis. The response
  to oxidative stress determines cell survival or death, which may contribute to clonal
  evolution. aKG, alpha‐ketoglutarate; CD44v, CD44 variant; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase
