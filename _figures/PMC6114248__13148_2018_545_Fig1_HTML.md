caption: Biosynthetic pathway of ω-3 and ω-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
  (LC-PUFAs) from essential fatty acids and the associations of rs174570 with PUFAs
  in the ω-3 and ω-6 pathways. LA and ALA are essential fatty acids that must be obtained
  from the diet and are converted to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. LC-PUFAs
  are synthesized via a series of actions of elongases and desaturases. DPA and DHA
  are mainly obtained from the diet or indirectly obtained by de novo synthesis from
  essential fatty acids. Linear regression analysis with adjustments for age, sex,
  and BMI was performed. The associations between rs174570 and the PUFAs in the ω-3
  and ω-6 pathways are shown with β and P values in the black boxes. LA, linoleic
  acid; GLA, gamma-linolenic acid; DGLA, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid; EDA, eicosadienoic
  acid; AA, arachidonic acid; ADA, adrenic acid; ALA, α-linolenic acid; EPA, eicosapentaenoic
  acid; DPA, docosapentaenoic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; FADS, fatty acid desaturase
papertitle: FADS1-FADS2 genetic polymorphisms are associated with fatty acid metabolism
  through changes in DNA methylation and gene expression.
