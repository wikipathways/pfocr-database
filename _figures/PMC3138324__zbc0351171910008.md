caption: Schematic overview of the effects of oxysterols on brain RAS. Angiotensinogen
  (AGT) is mainly synthesized by astrocytes but also by neurons. AngI is generated
  from AGT by renin, and subsequently converted to AngII by ACE. Activation of AT1R
  by AngII results in increased activity of the JAK/STAT pathway. Oxysterols (24S-OH
  and 27-OH) enhance the expressions of AGT and AT1R and decrease renin expression
  in a LXRβ-dependent manner. Oxysterols (24S-OH and 27-OH) increase ACE expression
  by a mechanism that was inhibited by 22(S)-OH but not by LXRβ knockdown. A conversion
  of AngI to AngII independently of ACE is also possible involving chymase, cathepsin
  D, and chymotrypsin-like angiotensin-generating enzymes (). Modulation of RAS by
  oxysterols could contribute to the physiological roles of this system in the brain.
  However, a chronic increase of 27-OH (as seen in AD and other neurodegenerative
  disorders) would result in an overactivation of AT1R, which has been reported to
  lead to vasoconstriction, oxidative stress, ischemic brain damage, and several metabolic
  disorders ().
