caption: 'Exosome biogenesis. Exosome biogenesis starts with budding into early endosome
  and further matures into the late endosome, collectively known as multivesicular
  bodies. Early endosome is formed from the plasma membrane via the endocytic pathway.
  Multivesicular body (MVB) can be formed by the invagination of the endosomal membrane.
  Dependent on the function and content, MVB then can be directed to fuse with plasma
  membrane and release to the extracellular space as exosomes. During the biogenesis
  of exosomes and prior to their secretion, proteins (e.g., tetraspanin, cytosolic
  proteins, and receptor), nucleic acids (e.g., mRNA, miRNA, and DNA), and lipids
  (e.g., sphingomyelin and cholesterol) are uploaded to exosomes. MVB: Multivesicular
  body; TGF: Transforming growth factor.'
