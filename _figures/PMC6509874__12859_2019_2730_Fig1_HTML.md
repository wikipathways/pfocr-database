caption: 'The AA metabolic network in human PMNs. AA is metabolized through three
  main pathways: the 5-LOX pathway (red line), the 15-LOX pathway (blue line), and
  the COX-2 pathway (green line). PGE2, LTA4, and LTB4 are the major inflammatory
  mediators produced in the COX-2 and 5-LOX pathways. A total of 24 feedback loops,
  which are involved in the network, make important contributions to the regulation
  of inflammatory mediators'
