caption: Flavonoids metabolic pathway in tepals of Chinese narcissus and gene expression
  changes during tepal pigmentation process. The pathway is divided into five sub-pathways
  based on the functions of unigenes. The additive expression changes of unigenes
  at different tepal pigmentation stages (T2, T3, T4 and T5) are shown by color grids
  based on RPKM value. The presumed critical genes C4H, CHS, ANS, and FLS in the pathway
  are marked with blue color. Black filled arrows indicate the substance metabolism
  directions; red filled arrows indicate the main flux (from naringenin to rutin)
  of flavonoids metabolic pathway in tepals. Enzymes marked with sunlight indicate
  their catalytic activities can be influenced by light.
