caption: Binding of TNF-α to TNF-R1, a death receptor, can induce RGC death through
  receptor-mediated caspase activation, and caspase-dependent and -independent components
  of the mitochondrial cell death pathway, which includes increased generation of
  ROS leading to oxidative damage. In addition, ceramide generation and silencing
  of survival signals have been associated with TNF-α-mediated cell death. Opposing
  these cell-death promoting signals, binding of TNF-R1 can also trigger the activation
  of survival signals, which include the activation of a transcription factor, NF-KB,
  whose target genes include inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins. Another intrinsic protection
  mechanism activated after TNF receptor binding involves heat shock proteins. A critical
  balance between a variety of intracellular signaling pathways determines whether
  a RGC will die or survive the exposure to TNF-α (TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha;
  TNF-R1, TNF death receptor; aif, apoptosis inducing factor; c, cytochrome c; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; NF-KB, nuclear factor-kappaB; IKB, NF-KB inhibiting protein).
