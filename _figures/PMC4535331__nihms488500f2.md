caption: In the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, acetylcholine binding to nicotinic
  acetylcholine receptor subunit α7 (α7nAChR) leads to the inhibition of the phosphorylation
  of inhibitor of NF-κB (I κB), the downregulation of the activation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs), inhibition of the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores
  and the formation of a heterodimeric protein complex with Janus kinase 1 (JAK2),
  which activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT3). Together,
  these signalling cascades lead to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine release.
  JNK, JUN N-terminal kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; NLR, nucleotide-binding domain,
  leucine-rich-repeat-containing family; PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ; TLR, Toll-like receptor.
