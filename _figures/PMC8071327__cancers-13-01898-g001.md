caption: Sphingolipid metabolism and compartmentalization. Three significant mechanisms
  for ceramide generation are illustrated. Ceramide is synthesized via s “de novo
  pathway” in the ER from where it is transported to the Golgi bodies through CERT
  and serves as a substrate for the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids (GLSL)
  and sphingomyelin (SM). GLSL and SM are transported to the plasma membrane through
  vesicular transport. In another mechanism; ceramide can be generated by the action
  of neutral or acidic SMases (“SMase pathway”) in the plasma membrane. Finally, in
  the “salvage pathway”, ceramide is synthesized from sphingosine released from the
  lysosome by the catalytic action of CERS. (SPT, Serine palmitoyltransferase; CERS,
  Ceramide synthase; CERK, Ceramide kinase; CPP, Ceramide-1-phosphate phosphatase;
  SMS, Sphingomyelin synthase; SMase, Sphingomyelinase; ACER, ceramidase in Golgi
  bodies; ASAH, ceramidase in lysosomes; SK, sphingosine kinase; SPP, Sphingosine-1-phosphate
  phosphatase; SPL, S1P lyase) (Figure is adapted from reference []).
