caption: Examples for problems in elementary mode analysis. (A) Condensed network
  of glycolysis (dark reactions) and Entner–Doudoroff pathway (gray reactions). The
  pentose phosphate pathway has been omitted for clarity. In most analyses of glycolysis,
  the Entner–Doudoroff pathway is not considered. Hence, not all pathways from glucose
  into the TCA cycle are found, and the wrong conclusion might be drawn that only
  the pentose–phosphate pathway (not shown) can be used to bypass the knockout of
  one of the enzymes converting G6P to FDP. In vivo the knockout of the corresponding
  reactions is partially bypassed by a flux through the Entner–Doudoroff pathway ().
  (B) Modeling the Entner–Doudoroff pathway by adding an outflow of G6P and an inflow
  of G3P and Pyr only partially resolves the problem (thick arrows). Such an approach
  is often used in elementary mode analysis to avoid the consideration of some pathways
  in detail (e.g., the outflow of succinyl-CoA from the TCA cycle in , analyzed in
  Results). However, this can lead to fluxes like in C, which are not part of any
  feasible pathway when the entire network in A is considered. This is because the
  coupling of the influx of Pyr with the outflow reactions of G6P and the inflow reaction
  of G3P are neglected in B. (D) Elementary mode analysis does not allow one to analyze
  the dependencies between the subsystems S1 and S2 unless the reactions connecting
  them are taken into account. Thus, it is not possible to deduce that a zero flux
  from G6P to FDP in S1 would imply that there cannot be a positive flux from DHAP
  to G3P in S2. A list of abbreviations can be found in Supplemental material S2.
