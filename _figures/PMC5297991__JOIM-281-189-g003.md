caption: Functional analysis of the network containing validated segregating variants.
  The network was algorithmically constructed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
  software based on the functional and biological connectivity of genes (a). The network
  is graphically represented as nodes (genes) and edges (the biological relationship
  between genes). Red nodes represent genes containing identified variants; others
  (empty nodes) are those that IPA automatically includes because they are biologically
  linked to the studied genes based on evidence in the literature. This is the only
  network that was generated by the software (score 59, n = 22 associated genes).
  UBC,AKT,CTNNB1 and NFKB are central nodes computed by the software (cyan colour).
  We overlaid onto this network previously published expression data obtained from
  IgAN patients and found that differently expressed genes and complexes were included
  in this network (ABHD2, CTNNB1, CTNNβ‐LEF1, DFFA, HNRNPA1, JADE1, KRTCAP2, LDLRAP1,
  let‐7, MS4A4A, NR3C1, SETD5, TCF4‐CTNNβ, TPRA1, Ube2‐ubiquitin, UBE2G1 and Ubiquitin;
  grey shaded symbols). The most representative canonical pathways associated with
  the uploaded genes are mainly involved in innate and adaptive immunity (b). The
  glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) is the target of steroid therapy (prednisone
  and methylprednisolone) routinely used in IgAN treatment (a). The upstream regulator
  analysis identified NR3C1 as a transcriptional regulator that explains the observed
  gene expression changes in differently expressed genes in peripheral blood cells
  (c, P = 9.46 × 10−6), during the acute phase of the disease (d, P = 2.03 × 10−7)
  and in monocytes isolated from IgAN patients (e, P = 1.88 × 10−4).
