caption: High-affinity ligands for the AR are shown in green boxes. Gene names are
  in italics. Steps in the “classical” pathway that show consistent elevated transcript
  expression in metastatic or recurrent tumors are marked with a red arrow and those
  with decreased transcript level are shown with a black arrow. Changes in steps indicated
  by the open arrows need to be further studied. Drugs that are available for clinical
  use that can block each of the major steps in androgen biosynthesis are indicated
  in blue. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) can also be of adrenal origin and 3α-andostanediol
  may be produced by the backdoor pathway on route to 5α-DHT. Only the final step
  in the backdoor pathway to 5α-DHT is shown for clarity.
