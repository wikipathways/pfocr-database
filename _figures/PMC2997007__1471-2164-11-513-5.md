caption: 'Candidate master switch molecules and signaling pathways involved in LPS-induced
  inflammatory response of monocyte THP-1 cells. (A) Key node analysis was used to
  assess the possible signaling pathways or potential interactions in response to
  LPS stimulation only, at different time points. Pink circle: the putative master
  regulator/molecule; red box: the up-regulation (≥ 3-fold) of gene expression induced
  by LPS compared to vehicle treatment; green box: the down-regulation (≥ 3-fold)
  of gene expression induced by LPS compared to the vehicle treatment; gray circle:
  assigned molecule in the putative pathway; ↑: activation; ⊥: inhibition. (B) TRANSPATH
  analysis of common signaling denominators. Genes with the same expression mode in
  the "early non-response" and "early down-regulation" groups in both BF/S+L/Ep and
  cytopiloyne treatments were analyzed. Only 4 hierarchical levels of regulation were
  accepted.'
