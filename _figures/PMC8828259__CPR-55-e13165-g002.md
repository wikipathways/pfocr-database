caption: Schematic representation of the alterations in GFAP‐Tk female rats after
  adult cytogenesis ablation. Environmental information is sent from the lateral entorhinal
  cortex (LEC) through the perforant pathway to the hippocampus, where adult‐born
  neurons are involved in processing and integrating new memories. In their absence,
  as happens in adult GFAP‐Tk rats treated with ganciclovir (GCV), the hippocampal
  output to downstream centres is compromised. In this work, female GFAP‐Tk rats showed
  disrupted CORT secretion, heightened, yet delayed, stress response and BLA hypertrophy
