caption: Cultured astrocytes and microglia were stimulated with 5 µM imiquimod or
  80 nM CpG-ODN 1826 or both. RNA was isolated at 6 hps, reverse transcribed and cDNA
  was analyzed for mRNA expression by quantitative real-time PCR analysis using TLR
  signaling pathway array. Genes are presented as a schematic of their protein’s involvement
  in the TLR signaling cascade or as genes transcribed following the signaling cascade.
  Increased mRNA expression of these genes in both microglia and astrocytes is indicated
  by green lettering, in astrocytes only by bold blue lettering and in microglia only
  by bold red lettering. Tlr4 mRNA was downregulated in microglia, while Tlr5 mRNA
  was downregulated in both microglia and astrocytes. Genes indicated in black lettering
  were not altered in either cell type and in grey lettering were not analyzed for
  mRNA expression.
