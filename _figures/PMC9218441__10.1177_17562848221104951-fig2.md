caption: Novel molecules are involved in activation of intestinal fibroblasts. (a)
  YAP/TAZ activation was dependent on Rho/ROCK signaling pathway, and increased the
  expression of profibrotic-related genes and proliferation of fibroblasts. (b) The
  upregulation of miR-155 targeted HBP1 and then activated the Wnt/βcatenin signaling
  pathway, leading to the activation of fibroblasts. (c) TL1A accompanied with IL-13
  induced EMT and activated fibroblasts via TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway. (d) The pharmacological
  activation of NR4A1 with cytosporone B or 6-mercaptopurine attenuated TGF-β1-induced
  fibrosis in myofibroblasts. (e) Gp130 family- and STAT3-related genes were highly
  enriched in NOD2-mutated fibroblasts and macrophages, which led to the differentiation
  of macrophages into activated fibroblasts.EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition;
