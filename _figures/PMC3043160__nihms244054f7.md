caption: In healthy kidney cells, the cysto-protein complex interacts with tuberin.
  Hamartin and tuberin form a complex and localize in the basal body. Tuberin is a
  GTPase activating protein (GAP) which controls the activity of Rheb. Tuberin inactivates
  Rheb, thereby inhibiting the mTOR pathway. In polycystic kidneys, however, tuberin
  is no longer protected in this complex and is phosphorylated by Akt, RSK (via ERK).
  As a result, tubulin is unable to form a heteradimer with hamartin. Hence, tuberin
  is no longer able inhibit Rheb, and the mTOR pathway is activated.
