caption: TGF-β1 signaling pathway and examined TGFB1 Thr263Ile gene variant.(A) TGF-β1
  signaling occurs when TGF-β1 forms a complex with surface-bound TGF-β receptors
  1 and 2 (TGF-βR1 and TGF-βR2 respectively). Specifically, two heterodimers of TGF-βR1/TGF-βR2
  coalesce in the presence of dimeric TGF-β1, resulting in heterotetrameric complex.
  (B) The proximity of the intracytoplasmic tails of TGF-βR2 initiates the sequential
  phosphorylation of TGF-βR1 and the SMAD signal transducers, SMAD2 and -3. (Of note,
  although it is uncommon, following TGF-βR1 phosphorylation non-SMAD-mediated signaling
  can also occur.) Once SMAD2/-3 has formed a dimeric unit, it can bind SMAD4, leading
  to nuclear translocation of the trimeric pSMAD2/-3 and SMAD4 complex. Inside the
  nucleus, the trimeric complex elicits transcription of TGF-β target genes, resulting
  in a myriad of cellular responses from bone remodeling to fibrosis, to apoptosis
  and immunosuppression. (C) To appreciate the potential role of TGFB1-related SNPs
  in kidney transplant recipients and donor transplant kidneys, we assessed the association
  between transplant survival outcomes and the TGFB1 SNP rs1800472C>T, which causes
  a missense mutation (p.Thr263Ile) in TGF-β1. Ile, isoleucine; SMAD, mothers against
  decapentaplegic homologue; TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta; TGF-βR, transforming
  growth factor beta receptor; Thr, threonine.
