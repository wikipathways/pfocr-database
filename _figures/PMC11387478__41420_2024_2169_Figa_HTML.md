caption: HIRI is a thorny problem after liver surgery such as liver transplantation.
  In a murine model of HIRI, MSC-EVs enriched GAS6 effectively enhance macrophage
  efferocytosis both in vivo and in vitro through the GAS6/MerTK/ERK/COX2 signaling
  pathway and significantly mitigate liver injury. This image was drawn by the authors
