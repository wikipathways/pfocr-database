caption: 1) The rise in three proxies marked the upregulation of glycolysis in CRC
  and hyperglycaemia in CRC, both of which resulted in worsening colorectal cancer
  by affecting T cells through the rising G6PD, MondoA-TXNIP signalling pathway, and
  Akt/mTORC1-CRC cellular autophagy pathway, respectively. 2) Lactate metabolism is
  upregulated in CRC, and upregulation of LDHA downregulates CD8 + T cells through
  downregulation of TH1-INFγ, and also enables polarization of TAMs to M2 TAMs through
  G protein-coupled receptor-dependent expression of ICER. G6PD glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; LDHA lactate dehydrogenase A Gene; ICER inducible cAMP early repressor
