caption: Schematic of olfactory epithelium and PAM enzymatic reaction. A, The adult
  olfactory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium is separated from the lamina propria
  (LP) by the basal lamina (dotted line). Proliferating basal cells (BC) give rise
  to immature olfactory receptor neurons (IN), which develop into mature neurons (MN).
  Mature neurons demonstrate dendritic extension to the olfactory lumen and axonal
  extension through the basal lamina to the olfactory bulb. Sustentacular cells (SC)
  span the olfactory epithelium.B, Localization of PAM to the secretory pathway. PAM
  is a transmembrane protein that functions within the lumen of the secretory pathway
  and is generally localized to thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) and large dense core
  vesicles (LDCV). PAM requires copper (Cu) and ascorbate; cytosolic copper is transported
  into the secretory pathway via two P-type ATPase copper transporters, Menkes protein
  (MNK, ATP7A) and Wilson's disease (ATP7B) (). Chaperone proteins make cytosolic
  copper available for superoxide dismutase (SOD) and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase
  (CCO).C, PAM amidation reaction. The PHM and PAL domains are located within the
  lumen of the secretory pathway. PHM converts glycine-extended neuropeptide precursors
  into α-hydroxyglycine intermediates in a copper (Cu)-, ascorbate-, and oxygen (O2)-dependent
  manner. This intermediate is converted to the final α-amidated product by PAL.A,
  Exon A; CD, cytoplasmic domain.
