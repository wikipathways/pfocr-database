caption: Estrogen-induced ER-mediated pathways of vascular relaxation. Estrogens such
  17β-estradiol (E2) binds to endothelial ERα, ERβ or GPR30 and activates phospholipase
  C (PLC), leading to the generation of inositol 1,4,5- triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG). IP3 causes the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ca2+
  forms a complex with calmodulin (CAM), which causes initial activation of eNOS.
  E2 also activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which transforms phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), and activates Akt.
  ER-mediated activation of Akt or MAPK causes phosphorylation and full activation
  of eNOS. Fully activated eNOS transforms L-arginine to L-citrulline and produces
  NO, which diffuses through ECs and activates guanylate cyclase in VSM leading to
  increased cGMP and stimulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). PKG decreases
  [Ca2+]i by stimulating Ca2+ extrusion pumps in the plasma membrane and Ca2+ uptake
  pumps in SR and/or decreases the sensitivity of the contractile myofilaments to
  [Ca2+]i and thereby promotes VSM relaxation. E2 also activates COX to produce prostacyclin
  (PGI2) which activates cAMP-dependent pathway, protein kinase A (PKA), and promotes
  relaxation pathways similar to cGMP/PKG. E2 also induces the release of EDHF which
  activates K+ channels and causes hyperpolarization and relaxation of VSM. E2 could
  also decrease endothelial ET-1 expression and production via genomic pathway. In
  VSM, agonists such as ET-1, TXA2 and AngII activate specific VSM receptors, stimulate
  PLC, and increase the production of IP3 and DAG. IP3 stimulates Ca2+ release from
  the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Agonists also stimulate Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ channels.
  Ca2+ binds CAM, activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), causes MLC phosphorylation,
  and initiates actin-myocin interaction and VSM contraction. DAG activates PKC, which
  in turn phosphorylates calponin (CaP) and/or activate a protein kinase cascade involving
  Raf, MAPK kinase (MEK) and MAPK, leading to phosphorylation of caldesmon (CaD) and
  increased myofilament force sensitivity to Ca2+. E2 binds to VSM ERs, leading to
  inhibition of agonist-activated mechanisms of VSM contraction. E2 activates K+ channels,
  leading to membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of Ca2+ entry through Ca2+
  channels. E2 may also inhibit PKC, MAPK or the RhoA/Rho-kinase (Rho-K) [Ca2+]i sensitization
  pathway. Dashed lines indicate inhibition.
