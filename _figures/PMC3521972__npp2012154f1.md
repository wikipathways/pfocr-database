caption: 'Cocaine causes transcription-dependent neuroplasticity in the reward pathway.
  (Brain top right): Cocaine alters the dynamics of numerou neurotransmitter systems
  in the mesocorticolimbic ‘reward pathway'' of the brain, which includes the ventral
  tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). These
  brain regions are critical for reward, reinforcement, and higher cognitive functions.
  (Main panel): Cocaine indirectly enhances the levels of the neurotransmitter DA
  at the interface between VTA cells and NAc cells by binding to and blocking DAT
  (top left). The subsequent activation of D1- and D2-like DA receptors stimulates
  intracellular signaling cascades that direct TF binding to DNA, facilitating neuroplasticity
  in response to cocaine intake. (DNA inset): Nucleosomes are in equilibrium between
  transcriptionally inactive and active states. HATs and HDACs have opposing actions
  to push the equilibrium one way or the other. Histone acetylation (by HATs) generally
  allows for TF binding and gene expression while histone deacetylation (by HDACs)
  represses transcription. Adapted from  and .'
