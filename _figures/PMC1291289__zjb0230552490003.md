caption: Biosynthesis of melanin from THN in streptomycetes and fungi. (A) Proposed
  HPQ melanin biosynthetic pathway in S. griseus. The structure and HMBC correlation
  of methylated HPQ are also shown. In S. coelicolor A3(2), instead of producing HPQ
  melanin, CYP158A2 dimerizes flaviolin, which is formed from THN by MomA () to yield
  flaviolin dimers. (B) The DHN melanin biosynthetic pathway in fungi.
