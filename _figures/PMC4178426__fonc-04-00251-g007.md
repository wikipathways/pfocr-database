caption: Nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Genes belonging to all the principal
  DNA repair systems were predominantly overexpressed in tumors. The NER is the most
  analyzed pathway related to cisplatin resistance. In normal lung tissue (Normal),
  only one DNA repair gene was overexpressed, the XPC. In the COID, SCLC, SQ, and
  MESO tumors, an array of genes was overexpressed. Key genes of the whole repair
  process were overexpressed. In the SQ, 25 NER genes were differentially expressed,
  and only four were downregulated, the CUL4, XPD, ERCC2, and ERCC8. The most heterogeneous
  tumor group, AD, had the least NER genes overexpressed. Red indicates significantly
  overexpression, dark green significant downregulation, and light green no differential
  expression. COID, carcinoids; AD, adenocarcinoma; SCLC, small-cell lung cancer;
  SQ, Squamous cell lung cancer; MESO, mesothelioma.
