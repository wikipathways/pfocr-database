caption: PARP-1 signaling in healthy and stressed cells. (A) PARP-1 activation requires
  NAD+ to catalyse the addition of PAR to itself. This same pathway is also used for
  PARP-1 to add PAR to DNA repair proteins including DNA ligase II, DNA polymerase,
  and XRCC1 topoisomerases. (B) Prolonged DNA damage induces over-activation of PARP-1,
  leading to NAD+ and ATP depletion, which may promote cell necrosis. In addition,
  some PAR may translocate to the cytosol and bind to mitochondrial receptors, causing
  the release of AIF, which diffuses to the nucleus and triggers DNA fragmentation.
  This form of cell death is known as “PARthanatos”. Parts of the figure were generated
  using images from Servier Medical Art (http://smart.servier.com/ accessed on 15
