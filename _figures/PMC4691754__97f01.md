caption: Heterochromatin formation in Neurospora crassa. (A) An ∼500-kb region, including
  the centromere of LG III, is shown to illustrate the pathway leading to constitutive
  heterochromatin in Neurospora. During the sexual phase of the life cycle, the genome
  defense system RIP (repeat-induced point mutation) recognizes repeated DNA (e.g.,
  transposons and other repeated DNA shown as black rectangles) and litters them with
  C:G-to-T:A mutations (). In vegetative cells, lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) associated
  with G:C-poor DNA is methylated by DIM-5, generating H3K9me3 (orange track), which
  is bound by the HP1-DIM-2 complex (yellow track) and catalyzes DNA methylation (green
  track). Perturbation of any step in the pathway eliminates the downstream steps
  without significantly influencing earlier steps. (B) Key proteins required to form
  constitutive (left) or facultative (right) heterochromatin. Methylation of H3K9
  by DIM-5 depends on all five members of the DCDC (DIM-5/-7/-9, CUL4/DDB1 complex)
  (). HP1 directly binds to H3K9me3 (cluster of three red hexagons labeled “Me”) and
  recruits the DNA methyltransferase DIM-2 (), resulting in a genome-wide correlation
  between H3K9me3 and DNA methylation (orange hexagons labeled “Me”) (). HP1 is also
  involved in the HCHC deacetylase silencing complex () and the DMM () complex, which
  limits spreading of constitutive heterochromatin. Methylation of H3K27 (cluster
  of three blue hexagons labeled “Me”) is carried out by the PRC2 complex consisting
  of SET-7, EED, SU(Z)12, and NPF ().
