caption: Proposed model of skin-associated B cell functions in α-gal sensitization
  from tick bites. (A) The skin is comprised of the epidermis and the dermis that
  are separated by a basement membrane. Langerhans cells (LC) and dermal dendritic
  cells (DC) are capable of responding to cutaneous exposure of tick antigens, such
  as glycoproteins, glycolipids, and tick cement that contain α-gal moieties, which
  leads to the migration of these cells to the skin-draining lymph nodes and allergen
  sensitization. This response is also shaped by the migration of B cells to inflamed
  skin around the tick bite, which may contribute to allergic responses by presenting
  antigen to T cells, secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, and secreting IgE antibodies
  that trigger mast cell and basophil activation. To date, the role of skin-associated
  B cells in meat allergy is unknown. (B) Naïve T cells are primed via presentation
  of tick antigens by LCs and dermal DCs within skin-draining lymph nodes. Activated
  CD4+ T cells subsequently traffic to the skin through blood and lymphatic vessels.
  Cognate T cell help provided by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells to α-gal-specific
  B cells leads to germinal center responses, positive clonal selection of B cells
  via recognition of native antigens retained by follicular dendritic cells (FDC),
  and the development of memory B cells and plasma cells that express skin- and gut-homing
  CCR6 receptors. IgE production to cutaneous tick antigens functions through a B
  cell-intrinsic myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) pathway
  and indirect class switching of IgG1+ B cells to IgE.
