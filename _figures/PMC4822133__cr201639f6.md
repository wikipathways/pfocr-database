caption: Ser65-phosphorylation of ubiquitin in mitophagy signaling. (A) Under normal
  growth conditions, the TIM/TOM complex continually imports PINK1 into mitochondria
  (step 1). Upon entry, PINK1 undergoes proteolytic processing by the protease PARL
  (step 2) and is exported and degraded by the N-end rule pathway (step 3). USP30
  controls the basal levels of mitochondrial ubiquitination. (B) Loss of mitochondrial
  membrane potential inhibits PINK1 import and proteolytic cleavage (step 4), leading
  to insertion of its transmembrane domain into the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM)
  (step 5). PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin on mitochondrial proteins such as mitofusins
  (step 6). (C) Ser65-phosphoUb recruits Parkin to damaged mitochondria (step 7),
  and Ser65-phosphoUb binding releases the Parkin Ubl domain and enables its phosphorylation
  by PINK1 (step 8). (D) Ser65-phosphoUb binding and phosphorylation activate Parkin
  which subsequently ubiquitinates OMM proteins, and the newly incorporated ubiquitins
  are further phosphorylated by PINK1 (step 9). Parkin-mediated ubiquitination of
  USP30 facilitates its proteasomal degradation (step 10). (E) Mitophagy receptors
  NDP52 and OPTN bind to ubiquitinated mitochondrial proteins via their UBDs (step
  11). (F) NDP52 and OPTN recruit the autophagy machinery to mitochondria (step 12).
  The phagophore engulfs mitochondria and fuses with the lysosome to degrade and recycle
  its contents.
