caption: The crosstalk between ferroptosis and EMT in TNBC metastasis. Mesenchymal
  cells have higher ferroptosis susceptibility than epithelial cells, which are less
  sensitive to it. NF2-YAP pathway exhibits an inhibitory effect on ferroptosis regulators.
  In addition, HLF, which is regulated by TGF-β, controls ferroptosis sensitivity
  by targeting GGT1. The figure was created using BioRender.com
