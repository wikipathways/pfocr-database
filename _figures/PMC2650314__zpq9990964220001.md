caption: Generation of a dual labeled A1::Smo::GFP reporter construct. (A) A 12-aa
  A1 tag was added to the extracellular N terminus of human Smo, whereas GFP was fused
  to the intracellular C terminus. (B) AcpS enzyme transfers a fluorophore to the
  serine in the A1 tag (marked as red in A) through a Ppant group in the CoA-fluorophore
  substrate, thereby labeling A1::Smo::GFP with a specific fluorophore.
