caption: 'Regulation of Hippo signaling and tissue growth by Fat signaling. (A) Schematic
  of the minimal Ds-Fat signaling and the Hippo pathway showing asymmetric localization
  of Fat (proximally), Ds, Dachs and Vam (distally) in the apical cortex. (B) Schematic
  depicting loss of Dachs and Vam polarity in fat mutants, and displacement of Dachs
  and Vam from the membrane to the cytoplasm by Fat overexpression or in app mutants.
  (C) Schematic showing the H (aa 4,733–4,900) and D (aa 4,975–4,993) regions of the
  Fat intracellular domain, locations of point mutations within the H region, and
  deletions within the H region that impair Hippo activity, including HM (4,834–4,899),
  PH (4,733–4,774), Hpo-N (4,775–4,836), Hpo-C (4,839–4,920), and H2 (4,719–4,900)
