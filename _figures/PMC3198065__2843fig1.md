caption: Schematic representation of Nox activation. Nox holoenzyme consists of cytosolic
  and membrane-associated components. Upon activation, Rac1, guanosine-5′-diphosphate
  (GDP) is converted to Rac1 guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP), which binds to p67phox,
  and the complex translocates to the membrane. Existing evidence in other cell types
  suggests that phosphorylation of p47phox also triggers its translocation to the
  membrane to form the Nox holoenzyme complex that culminates in the enzyme activation
  and associated increase in ROS.
