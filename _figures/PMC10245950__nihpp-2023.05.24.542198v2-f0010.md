caption: TCA cycle is affected by oxaliplatin. E1 component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
  complex (OGDH) enzyme (Ogdh) exhibited statistically significant downregulation.
  The remaining two subunits of this complex encoded by Dlst and Dld and other genes
  controlling the TCA cycle were not affected. The other enzymes of the TCA cycle
  remained unaffected by oxaliplatin. That includes citrate synthase (Cs) that converts
  acetyl-CoA from β-oxidation of FAs or from glycolysis to form citrate, aconitase
  isomerases (Aco1 and Aco2) that convert citrate to isocitrate, isocitrate dehydrogenases
  (Idh3b and Idh3g) that form 2-oxoglutaric acid, succinate coenzyme A ligase (Sucla2,
  Suclg1, Suclg2), succinate dehydrogenases (Sdha, Sdhb and Sdhc) that forms fumarate,
  fumarate hydratase 1 (Fh1) that produce malate, and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenases
  (Mdh1 and Mdh2) that form oxaloacetate. The pathway is derived from the KEGG database.
  Blue – upregulated genes, red downregulated genes, grey – not affected genes
