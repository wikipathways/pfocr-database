caption: 'Epigenetic regulation of CD4+ T cell differentiation. CD4+ T cell memory
  formation: During memory formation, remodeling of H3K4 methylation (green) marks
  takes place together with the removal of repressive H3K27me3 (red) marks in genes
  of the JAK-STAT pathway. Moreover, permissive H3K4me3 (green) and H3K27Ac (purple)
  marks are present in genes related to CD4+ T cell function. CD4+ T cell polarization:
  TH1 polarization is controlled by EZH2 that silences TH2-related genes and vice
  versa. KDM6B favors TH1 polarization by positive regulation of TH1-related genes
  while KMT1E negatively regulates IFNG and Tbx21 (T-bet) gene expression. HDAC1 and
  11 are general inhibitors of CD4+ T cell function through silencing of cytokine
  production, Eomes and Tbx21 (T-bet). Epigenetic regulation of FOXP3 expression in
  Treg: FOXP3 expression is regulated by epigenetic processes in Treg including (i)
  exchange of repressive HDAC5 and SIRT 1 for a permissive CPB/p300 (HAT) complex,
  (ii) permissive H3K4me3 (green) and H3 lysine acetylation (purple) in a TGFβ response
  element (CNS1), (iii) TET2 dependent DNA demethylation of a 5’UTR region (CNS2),
  and (iii) H3K4me1/2 poised state of CNS3 needed for Foxp3 expression. HDAC1, 11
  and DNMT3A represent potential targets to improve CD4+ T cell anti-tumor immunity.'
