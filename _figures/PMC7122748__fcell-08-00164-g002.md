caption: Hypothetic α-oxidation pathway for the conversion of DHA-H into HPA. DHA-H
  requires activation by an acyl-CoA synthetase. DHA-H-CoA would be subject to 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA
  lyase (HACL1) activity, leading to the formation of an intermediate polyunsaturated
  fatty aldehyde which should contain 5 or 6 double bonds. It is not clear at what
  time the double bond originally located at DHA-H carbon 4 is lost. This process
  is dependent on thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and Mg2+, and it can be inhibited by
  the competitive antagonist, oxythiamine. Aldehyde dehydrogenase would be responsible
  for conversion of the intermediate aldehyde into HPA and the subsequent metabolism
  of HPA would take place via β-oxidation.
