caption: Shedding and cleavage of transmembrane mucins. Transmembrane mucin extracellular
  domains can be released from the surface and can be detected in many biological
  fluids. The intracellular tail, and in some cases the full-length protein, is reported
  to localize to the nucleus. Several mechanisms of transmembrane mucin shedding and
  cleavage have been reported. a Shedding of the transmembrane mucin extracellular
  domain from the SEA domain. b Cleavage of the extracellular domain by metalloproteases
  or sheddases. It remains to be established if release of the extracellular domain
  leads to phosphorylation and activation of the intracellular tail and the initiation
  of signaling pathways. c RIP pathway; cleavage of the intracellular tail by a γ-secretase
  after release of the extracellular domain.
