caption: The cell cycle model shown integrates chemical kinetics, enzyme catalyzed
  reactions and discrete events, such as chromosome separation, cell division, and
  entry/exit to a combined G1SG2 phase. Tumor growth is a process that is linked explicitly
  to the cell cycle, thus providing a quantitative model that connects a molecular
  process model to a clinical manifestation. Each cell division increments tumor size,
  while a continuous apoptotic reaction causes slow decay of tumor size. Rules for
  this cell cycle model are given in the text. Simulation results are presented in
  the succeeding figures.
