caption: (A) flu mutants are unable to regulate tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, leading
  to overaccumulation of Pchlide in the dark. In the light, Pchlide generates 1O2,
  which then promotes the FtsH2-dependent proteolytic degradation of EX1 and EX2.
  This degradation is sensed through unresolved mechanisms that trigger programmed
  cell death. (B) In wild-type chloroplasts, PP IX is chelated with iron by FC1 and
  FC2, yielding haem (top). In mutants without FC2 (grey, bottom), PP IX accumulates.
  PP IX generates singlet oxygen in the light, which activates PUB4-mediated polyubiquitination
  and degradation of the chloroplast. This pathway is invoked at low frequency in
  wild-type plants as a quality control measure to degrade photo-damaged chloroplasts.
  (C) In wild-type plants, monomeric SAL1 dephosphorylates PAP to yield AMP (left).
  Under oxidative stress, such as high light, SAL1 undergoes inactivating conformational
  changes, including dimerization, that subsequently raise PAP levels. PAP leaves
  the chloroplast and interferes with XRN activity, likely due to its structural similarity
  to the 5′ ends of uncapped RNA. Stress-inducible transcripts are stabilized by PAP-mediated
  inactivation of XRNs, increasing plant stress tolerance and suppressing programmed
  cell death.
