caption: The assembly and activation of AIM2 inflammasome and subsequently regulatory
  and trigger pathways in psoriasis. Upon sensing viral DNA, self-derived dsDNA, and
  cytosolic bacterium, the HIN domain of AIM2 directly recognizes dsDNA in a sequence-independent
  manner, which triggers the assembly of the AIM2 oligomerization. The PYD domain
  of AIM2 interacts with the PYD of a recruiting adapter protein ASC, resulting in
  a high polymer complex AIM2 inflammasome. Inactive procaspases-1 are recruited into
  AIM2 inflammasome via the CARD-CARD interaction. When the main components of the
  inflammasome are connecting and the active inflammasome is formed, it directly recruits
  and cleaves pro-caspase1 into active caspase-1, which proteolytically activates
  the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. These inflammatory cytokines directly
  induce inflammatory responses and participate in the occurrence and development
  of diseases. The active IL-1β and IL-18 involve in IL23/Th17 pathway and then induce
  many kinds of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines, which trigger the development
  of psoriasis. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) promoted the expression of the AIM2 gene.
  Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), EFLA-945, obovatol, withaferin A (WFA), and RGFP966
  are inhibitory effects on AIM2. Prokineticin 2 (PK2), caspase recruitment domain
  family member 18 (CARD18), aurora kinase A (AURKA), TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9 antagonists
  are regulators of AIM2 inflammasome signaling pathway.
