caption: Scheme of the proposed cellular and molecular effects of calcium channel
  inhibition on RGC cell body and axons after optic nerve crush (ONC).(A) In untreated
  animals, ONC lesion leads to a rapid influx of calcium through different calcium
  channels, which induces axonal degeneration and retinal ganglion cells (RGC) death.
  These effects were accompanied by an increase in the activity of calpain and the
  JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway that most likely contribute to axonal degeneration and
  cell death. (B) Application of calcium channel inhibitors (amlodipine, NBQX and
  amiloride) decreased axonal degeneration, increased RGC survival and improved axonal
  regeneration. Mechanistically, calcium channel inhibition decreased the activities
  of calpain, JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway and increased the activity of Akt, which
  suggest that these mechanisms could be involved in the effects of calcium channel
  inhibitors.
