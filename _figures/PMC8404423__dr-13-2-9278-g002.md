caption: 'The integrated care pathway for non-melanoma skin cancers between different
  institutional centres. Local dermatology outpatient clinic should treat patients
  affected by low risk BCC or SCC, while, general hospital with a Dermatology Unit
  could manage intermediate and high-risk BCC or high and very high risk SCC. More
  complicated cases (i.e., locally advanced or metastatic BCC or SCC, high risk BCC,
  or very high-risk SCC) should be managed by tertiary node with skin cancer centres
  and oncologic services organised in multidisciplinary working group (MWG). GP: general
  practitioner; PDT: photodynamic therapy; MWG: Multidisciplinary working group; RT:
  radiotherapy; ECT: electrochemotherapy.'
