caption: 'Pulmonary vasoconstriction is orchestrated. Neural, hormonal, and humoral
  mediators, as well as tissue hypoxia, constrict the lung vasculature in utero and
  maintain a high level of fetal pulmonary vascular resistance. Many of these agonists
  work through a Gq-coupled receptor pathway to activate a number of intracellular
  signaling systems that lead to pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell contraction.
  These pathways are detailed in the text and ultimately cause simultaneous activation
  of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) and inhibition of myosin light-chain phosphatase
  (MLCP). The mechanisms associated with hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction
  are controversial but overlap those of the other mediators. Adult animal studies
  illustrate that the hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction response includes
  a combination of activation of L-type Ca2+ channels (CaL), ryanodine receptors (RyRs),
  Rho-kinase, nonselective cation channels, and inhibition of K+ channels. A dashed
  green arrow indicates an activation pathway; a dashed red line with a bar indicates
  an inhibition pathway; a dashed blue arrow indicates movement of calcium. CaM/CAMKII:
  calmodulin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; ClCa: calcium-activated
