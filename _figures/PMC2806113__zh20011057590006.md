caption: 'Working model of TGF-β actions in renal interstitial fibrogenesis. The canonical
  pathway through smad2/3 contributes primarily to the transition of fibroblasts into
  myofibroblasts and to the transcriptional activation of various extracellular matrix
  proteins in myofibroblasts as well as in epithelial and nonepithelial glomerular
  and tubular cells. The noncanonical (smad-independent) pathways are initiated by
  activation of PI3K which is a branch point for the activation of PAK2-Abl. The latter
  induces fibroblast proliferation, thereby increasing the number of myofibroblast
  precursors. PI3K also activates Akt. One of its downstream targets is TSC2 which
  becomes phosphorylated and thereby inactivated. Active (nonphosphorylated) TSC2
  functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) protein converting mTORC1-activating
  Rheb-GTP to Rheb-GDP. Thus, active TSC2 is an inhibitor of mTORC1, and loss of TSC2
  activity by phosphorylation increases mTORC1 activity. This activates downstream
  substrates including P70S6 kinase, a translational activator of many proteins including
  cell cycle proteins and hence, proliferation. The Akt → mTORC1 → P70S6K branch pathway
  contributes also to fibroblast proliferation. Thus, in fibroblasts, the noncanonical
  and canonical TGF-β pathways closely collaborate: the noncanonical pathway induces
  fibroblast proliferation and the canonical smad2/3 pathway induces transition of
  the increased number of fibroblasts into active myofibroblasts and acts in these
  latter cells as transcriptional activator of multiple extracellular matrix proteins
  as well as regulators of matrix accumulation.'
