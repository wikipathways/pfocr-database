caption: Significance of sulfur metabolic pathway in Mtb persistence. (a) Reductive
  branch of Mtb sulfate assimilation pathway showing biosynthesis of reduced sulfur-containing
  biomolecules. Sulfur, available to mycobacteria within the host as an inorganic
  sulfate, is activated through adenylation to APS, a reaction catalyzed by ATP sulfurylase
  (ATPS). APS is reduced by APS reductase (APSR) to sulfite (SO3−2) and subsequently
  to sulfide (HS) by sulfite reductase (SiR). Sulfide is incorporated into O-acetylserine
  (OAS) to form cysteine by OAS (thiol)lyase (OASTL). Ultimately, cysteine is used
  for the biosynthesis of proteins, MSH, and other essential biomolecules required
  for survival, pathogenesis, and antioxidant defense in persistent Mtb. (b) Mycothiol,
  a major low molecular weight thiol antioxidant, and its primary function in maintaining
  redox homeostasis.
