caption: Gene networks and canonical pathways generated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
  (A) Upregulated gene network (B) downregulated gene network including proteins and
  enzymes, G-protein coupled receptors and different regulators and receptors compared
  between TRAMP mice and non-transgenic littermates. Solid and dotted lines imply
  direct and indirect relationships between proteins. The intensity of the node color
  (red) indicated the degree of upregulation and pink color is designated as cancer
  associated molecules/pathways. The node shapes denote enzymes, phosphatases, kinases,
  peptidases, G-protein coupled receptor, transmembrane receptor, cytokines, growth
  factor, ion channel, transporter, translation factor, nuclear receptor, transcription
  factor.
