caption: The proposed mechanism through which total osteocalcin/ucOC has been reported
  to elicit atheroprotective functions in vascular cells. By improving metabolic outcomes,
  total osteocalcin/ucOC reduces pathological mechanisms, including autophagy, apoptosis,
  and ER stress, through the β-subunit of the insulin receptor (IRβ) and via the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt/NF-кβ/mTOR
  signaling pathway. Vascular function is improved via the PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling
  pathway which stimulates NO in the smooth muscle cells. ucOC = undercarboxylated
  osteocalcin, PI3K = phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt = protein kinase B, eNOS = endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase, NO = nitric oxide, IRβ = insulin receptor β, IRS-1 = insulin
  receptor substrate 1, NF-кβ = nuclear factor kappa β, mTOR = mammalian target of
  rapamycin, ER = endoplasmic reticulum.
