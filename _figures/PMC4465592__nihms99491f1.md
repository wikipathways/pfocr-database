caption: Insult to the airway (far right) by damage from toxic exposure by particulate
  matter, cigarette smoke, or inflammatory compounds like LPS, or by bacterial or
  viral infection causes recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells from the
  bloodstream (far right). In this simplified view, extracellular matrix breakdown
  is illustrated for collagen (main panel, left side) and elastin (main panel, right).
  Such substrate breakdown contributes to further inflammation in the tissue by the
  generation of matrix derived peptides active on neutrophils or macrophages in the
  cases of collagen or elastin, respectively.In the case of collagen, Collagenases
  and elastases (i.e. MMPs-2, 8, or 9) cause the fragmentation of the protein into
  peptides which are then further digested by Prolyl endopeptidase leading to generation
  of PGP, which is sometimes acetylated by an unknown mechanism to form N-a-PGP. In
  the extracellular space, the PGP molecules are then active on neutrophils as chemoattractants
  and cell activators via the CXCR receptor pathway, causing influx of cells into
  the interstitium and augmenting the inflammatory phenotype caused by the initial
  insult.When elastin is cleaved by neutrophil elastase, matrix metalloelastase, or
  other peptidases present, many peptides are produced. Among these, a 12 kDa peptide
  has been identified that can induce chemotaxis of macrophages or cause macrophage
  activation to release other inflammatory mediators including cytokines or chemokines
  like IL-8 which is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant.The end result of these matrix-derived
  signaling peptides’ activity seems to be the perpetuation of an inflammatory phenotype
  in the affected tissue. In COPD, chronic insult - by cigarette smoke for example
  – leads to chronic matrix degradation, which in turn drives chronic inflammation
  by chemoattraction and cell activation. This model for chronic inflammatory disease
  connects the reactive inflammation to noxious or infectious stimuli to extracellular
  matrix breakdown to prolonged leukocyte recruitment and chronic inflammation and
  remodeling as seen in diseased tissue.
