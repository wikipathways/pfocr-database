caption: 'Proposed signalling pathways underlying the antidepressant actions of ketamine
  enantiomers and metabolites. Top: (S)-ketamine causes glutamate release via disinhibition
  of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons. Resulting glutamate surge stimulates
  α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors leading to
  release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with resulting activation of
  tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
  signalling. This leads to increased synthesis of proteins required for synaptogenesis.
  (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine suppress resting N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor
  activity, deactivating eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, resulting in
  reduced eEF2 phosphorylation, augmentation of BDNF synthesis and TrkB-mTORC1 activation.
  Bottom: (R)-ketamine causes glutamate release via disinhibition of GABA interneurons
  with activation of AMPA receptors and BDNF release but there may be an alternative
  pathway by which (R)-ketamine stimulates AMPA receptor transmission that still needs
  to be elucidated. (R)-ketamine may cause preferential activation of TrkB-MEK-ERK
  signalling pathway leading to synaptogenesis. (2R,6R)-HNK directly activates AMPA
  receptors and inhibition of group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2) receptors may
  also be involved in this metabolite’s antidepressant actions.'
