caption: Few molecular mechanisms by which TAM affects EC.TAM releases CCL22 to bind
  to CCR4, activating the FAK/AKT signaling pathway and causing tumor cells to undergo
  EMT. Macrophages in hypoxic environments upregulate the expression of HIF-1α and
  promote the secretion of IL-8, the latter of which increases the expression of PD-L1
  in cancer cells, which in turn promotes immunosuppression. TAM promotes the expression
  of S100A8/A9 in ESCC cells, which in turn enhances tumor cell migration and invasion
  by inducing AKT and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. TAMs can secrete pro-vascular factors
  such as VEGFA and MMP9 to promote tumor angiogenesis
