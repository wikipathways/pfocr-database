caption: Proposed ERBB2 intracellular mechanism of action. (a,b) Abs treatment induces
  ERBB2 homodimerization and transactivation of Tyr1248. (b,c) ERBB2 C-terminal domain
  phosphorylation induces MAPK (ERK) pathway activation. (c,d) Active ERK binds to
  and phosphorylates ERBB2 Thr701 residue, sustaining ERBB2 C-terminal domain phosphorylation
  (positive feedback loop), and fostering the recruitment of phospho-AKT and CyPA
  onto the receptor. (d,e) CyPA binding to ERBB2 Pro702 residue possibly sequesters
  the immunophilin from the interaction with phospho-AKT, which becomes accessible
  to and is de-phosphorylated by PP2A Ser/Thr phosphatase.
