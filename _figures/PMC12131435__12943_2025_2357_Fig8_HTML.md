caption: The intricate signaling interactions between cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs) and cancer cells, highlighting key pathways involved in tumor progression,
  proliferation, migration, and metastasis. The PI3 K/AKT/mTOR and ERK signaling cascades
  are prominently depicted, showing their roles in cellular proliferation, stemness,
  and invasion. PIP2-PIP3 conversion by PI3 K and its regulation by PTEN influence
  downstream mTOR activation, facilitating tumor growth and CAF transformation. Additionally,
  cancer-derived factors such as CXCL12, IL-32, and POSTN promote EMT and metastatic
  potential through JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 signaling. The interplay between CAF-secreted
  factors and cancer cells fosters an immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting microenvironment.
  This schematic underscores the importance of targeting CAF-cancer cell crosstalk
  to develop effective therapeutic interventions. The figure is created with BioRender
