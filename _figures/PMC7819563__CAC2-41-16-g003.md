caption: 'The correlation between glucose metabolism and amino acid metabolism in
  tumor cells. Aerobic glycolysis contributes to serine metabolism, and glutamine
  metabolism and Warburg effect transmit precursors to the TCA cycle. Arginine is
  cleaved to produce urea and ornithine. Ornithine supports citrulline biosynthesis
  in the mitochondria, and subsequently to arginine renewal, and this series of reactions
  is termed as the urea cycle. And the urea cycle disorder and pentose phosphate pathway
  alter nucleic acid level. Abbreviations: G6PD, glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase;
  PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; SDH, serine dehydratase; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase
  A; IDO, indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase; IDH1, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; GLUD1, glutamate
  dehydrogenase 1; GPT2, glutamic pyruvate transaminase 2; ASNase1, asparaginase 1;
