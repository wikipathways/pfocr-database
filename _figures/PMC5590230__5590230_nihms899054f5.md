caption: (A) Representative electron micrograph of EVs isolated from astrocytes 2
  hours after stimulation with IL-1β (100 ng/ml). (B) Quantitation of astrocyte-shed
  EV size and quantity. (C) Representative Western blots from astrocyte-shed EVs stained
  for the tetraspan protein CD63 and the lipid raft marker flotillin. (D) Venn diagram
  comparing protein content of EVs constitutively released from astrocytes (control)
  with EVs released 2 hours after stimulation with IL-1β (100 ng/ml). (E) IPA was
  conducted using the protein and miRNA content of astrocyte EVs shed in response
  to IL-1β. Red fill indicates negative regulation; green fill indicates positive
  regulation; blue outline shows components identified by the protein content of EVs;
  and a double purple outline shows components targeted by multiple miRNAs. (F to
  I) ChIP assays results of NF-κB binding to (F) Ccl2, (G) IL-1β, (H) TNFα, and (I)
  IL-17 promoter regions in the liver 2 hours after striatal injections of saline
  or IL-1β (0.1 ng in 3 µl). (J and K) Representative photomicrographs (J) and stereological
  quantitation (K) of Ly6b+ leukocytes in the striatum 24 hours after striatal injection
  of saline, IL-1β, or IL-1β + fenofibrate (PPARα agonist; 10 mg/kg by tail vein infusion).
  (L and M) Representative photomicrographs (L) and stereological quantitation (M)
  of Ly6b+ leukocytes 24 hours after striatal injection of IL-1β, IL-1β + altenusin
  (50 µM), or IL-1β + altenusin + GW6471 (PPARα antagonist; 20 mg/kg by tail vein
  infusion). Data are means ± SEM, n = 3 to 6 mice per condition. **P < 0.01, ***P
  < 0.001 compared to saline; *P < 0.05 compared to IL-1β + altenusin; P < 0.01, P
  < 0.001 compared to IL-1β. ANOVA with Tukey post hoc comparisons.
