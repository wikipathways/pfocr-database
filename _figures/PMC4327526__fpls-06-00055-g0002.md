caption: LCBs, PA, MAPKs, and ROS in the signaling pathway involved in ABA-induced
  stomata closure in response to drought. ABA is synthesized as a signal upon water
  deficit and then is perceived by the guard cells that form the stoma. This is followed
  by the transduction events illustrated as follows. At the end, the MAPK cascade
  activation seems responsible of activating a slow anion channel that triggers membrane
  depolarization that is necessary to close the stoma. The signaling of ABA induces
  the synthesis of PA by PLDα1 and PLDδ. A fraction of PA in the plasma membrane recruits
  ABI1, an ABA signaling inhibitor, thereby preventing its translocation to the nucleus,
  and thus, activation of the transcription factor ATH6. Another fraction of PA is
  translocated to the tonoplast, where it activates SPHK1/2 leading to LCB-P production.
  The surge in LCB-Ps causes an increase in cytosolic calcium levels, which favors
  PLDα1 translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it is further
  activated, enhancing PA levels. PA in turns binds to GPA1, leading to activation
  of the AtrbohD/F NADPH oxidases. The ensuing production of H2O2 results in increased
  levels of NO and the activation of a MAPK cascade that includes MPK9 and MPK12,
  which play a key role in stomata closure. ABA, abscisic acid; ABI1, ABA-insensitive
  protein phosphatase 2C; AtrbohD and AtrbohF, NADPH oxidase isoforms; ATHB6, homeodomain
  protein; Ca2+, calcium ion; GPA1, G protein alpha-subunit; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide;
  LCB, free long-chain base; LCB-P, phosphorylated form of long-chain base; MPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; MP2K, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MP3K, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase; NADPH oxidase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase;
