caption: Inhibitory microglial SIGLEC receptors recognize sialylated ligands and inhibit
  microglial responses. Sialic acids are typically found on the terminal position
  of sialylated glycolipids and glycoproteins on mammalian cells. Recognition of the
  sialylated ligands by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM)-signaling
  SIGLEC receptors leads to inhibition of intracellular signals emanating from immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-signaling receptors. Consequently, the ITIM
  signaling pathway exerts a regulatory influence over various microglial responses,
  including phagocytosis, oxidative burst, inflammation, migration, and proliferation.
  SIGLEC receptors can take up their ligands via the ITIM signaling pathway, leading
  to homeostatic endocytosis. This dual functionality allows them to maintain cellular
  balance. Several cell membrane receptors likely converge on the ITAM/ITIM response
  to generate distinct signals through various intracellular second messenger pathways.
  Phosphatidylserine residues exposed on the outer membrane leaflet of damaged cells
  are recognized by triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), resulting
  in activatory signaling via the associated ITAM-containing protein transmembrane
  adapter protein transmembrane immune signaling adaptor TYROBP. Moreover, desialylation
  serves as a trigger for complement opsonization of factor C1 and complement activation
  via the C3 convertase. CR3, complement receptor 3 (depicted as a heterodimer of
