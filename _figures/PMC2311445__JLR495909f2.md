caption: Target Of Rapamycin Complex 2 (TORC2) and calcineurin regulate de novo ceramide
  and sphingolipid synthesis in yeast. TORC2 is proposed to sense growth signals and
  phosphorylate the protein kinase Ypk2 (), which, after being phosphorylated in its
  activation loop by Pkh2 () (and perhaps Pkh1), activates ceramide synthase. The
  Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin opposes the TORC2-Pkh1/2-Ypk2
  pathway to downregulate ceramide synthase activity in response to heat and other
  stresses. Environmental factors such as heat stress that increase LCBs are proposed
  to act in a feed-forward manner to activate Pkh1/2 and possibly increase the rate
  of ceramide synthesis (not shown) ().
