caption: N-glycan trimming of the HBV envelope glycoproteins. Following the attachment
  of the (GlcNAc)2Man9Glc3, precursor to nascent viral polypeptides, the ER α-glucosidase
  I (GS I) removes the terminal Glc, followed by ER α-glucosidase II (GS II) trimming
  the second Glc unit. The mono-glucosylated glycoproteins enter the protein folding
  cycle assisted by ER-resident chaperones [,]. Interaction with calnexin (CNX) was
  demonstrated for M and L proteins [,]. Subsequent to trimming of the last Glc unit
  by GS II, improperly folded proteins are re-glucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein
  glucosyltransferase (UGGT) and reenter the cycle. Correctly folded glycoproteins
  are subjected to further mannose (Man) trimming by ER mannosidase I (ER Man I),
  followed by Golgi mannosidases I and II. Finally, the N-glycan is processed by a
  series of glycosyl transferases, leading to complex structures on secreted glycoproteins
  [,]. The ER degradation-enhancing, mannosidase-like proteins (EDEMs )are also responsible
  for Man trimming, leading to Man5-7 intermediates. S and L proteins are substrates
  for the OS-9 lectin that delivers them to HRD1-SEL 1L complex for degradation. In
  contrast, EDEM trimming accelerates M protein trafficking through the secretory
  pathway [,]. Specific inhibitors for the N-glycan trimming steps are indicated [,].
