caption: The central components of three pathways are shown (arrows, activation; bars,
  repression). Signals from the stress-activated MAPK Spc1, the cAMP-dependent kinase
  PKA, and the mating pheromone-responsive kinase Pat1 converge upon Ste11 and Mei2,
  which are key positive effecters of sexual differentiation. This study demonstrates
  that Atf1-Pcr1-M26 complex transduces signals from the stress-activated MAPK pathway
  to help regulate cgs2+ and components downstream of the PKA pathway. Additional
  Spc1-dependent signals are transduced by an Atf1-Pcr1-independent mechanism (“?”
  and dotted lines). We also hypothesize that PKA represses Atf1-Pcr1 to coordinate
  signals from two sensing pathways and to activate a feedback amplification loop
  that ensures commitment to sexual differentiation (“*” and dotted lines).
