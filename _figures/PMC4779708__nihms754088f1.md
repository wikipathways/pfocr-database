caption: Schematic model of signaling pathways implicated in tumor cell vascular mimicry
  (VM). Only signaling molecules which have been specifically modulated using antisense
  oligonucletides, small inhibitory RNAs, blocking antibodies, small molecule inhibitors,
  or transient transfections are depicted -- demonstrating their ability to directly
  affect VM, and are categorized as vascular (red), embryonic/stem cell (green), tumor
  microenvironment (purple), and hypoxia signaling pathways (blue). Molecules shaded
  with two different colors demonstrate overlap between major VM signaling pathways.
  Involvement of Gal3 and IL-8 in VM has been previously reviewed (Mourand-Zeidan
  et al., 2008). Question marks indicate the potential involvement of a protein and/or
  downstream effector protein or proteins in modulating VM in aggressive cancer cells,
  for which the underlying signaling pathway or pathways are not yet clearly defined.
