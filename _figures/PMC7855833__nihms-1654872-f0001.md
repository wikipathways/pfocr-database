caption: A. Arachidonic acid pathway metabolism. Membrane phospholipids are mobilized
  by phospholipase A2. Arachidonic acid is metabolized by either cyclooxygenase enzymes
  to form prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes or lipoxygenase pathways
  to form leukotrienes and lipoxins. B. Docosahexaenoic acid pathway metabolism. Docosahexaenoic
  acid is obtained the diet and oxidized by specific lipoxygenases to form precursors
  (14-HpDHA and 17-HpDHA) which are further metabolized to form resolvins, protectins,
  and maresins. Adapted from Harizi et al.[] and Serhan and Petasis.[]
