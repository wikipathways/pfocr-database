caption: BMP signalling in micropatterned colonies. (A) Illustration of the theoretical
  periodic pattern of BMP pathway activity in large colonies. (B) Illustration of
  the interdependence between colony size and BMP concentration and its effect on
  fate patterning. (C) Diagram showing that BMP4 induces only one cell fate in microcolonies
  (same colours as in B). Small arrows indicate autocrine signalling enforcing the
  same fates within individual colonies. (D) Side view of a BMP4-treated gastruloid.
  Cell responsiveness to BMP is highest at the edge of the colony owing to differential
  receptor localisation (Da). BMP induces secondary signals (WNT, which in turn induces
  NODAL), which form inward travelling waves of signalling that regulate the emergence
  of the mesendoderm fates (Db). (E) Description of the experimental approach by  to
  test the interplay between BMP and tissue tension during neural plate (NP) patterning.
  Micropatterned colonies were grown on top of inflatable microchannels. Adding air
  pressure induces tissue folding and increases BMP responsiveness at the colony centre
  leading to the neural plate border (NPB) fate in the entire colony. Consistently,
  BMP response depends directly on cell area in single cell micropattern experiments.
  BMPR, BMP receptor; ExE, extraembryonic ectoderm; NE, neurectoderm; PPS, posterior
  primitive streak.
