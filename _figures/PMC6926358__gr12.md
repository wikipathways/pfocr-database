caption: 'Proposed mechanism of interaction between BQ and Trx1 leading to ASK1/p38-MAPK
  signalling pathway activation. The red-cross indicates the inhibition effect, and
  the down arrow indicates the level decrease. Abbreviations: Trx, thioredoxin; TrxR,

  GR, glutathione reductase; Ox, oxidized; Red, reduced; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase 1. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
