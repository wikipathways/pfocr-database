caption: (A) miRNAs are transcribed as long pri-miRNAs containing hairpin structures
  as an RNA element (i, red). The hairpin structure is cleaved by the nuclear RNase
  III enzyme Drosha at the stem (ii, dark blue) and by the cytoplasmic RNaseIII enzyme
  Dicer at the loop (ii, light blue), generating a ~22-nt miRNA/miRNA* duplex (ii,
  asterisk). The duplex is loaded into AGO proteins (iii, orange) and the passenger
  strand (miRNA*) is ejected from AGO, producing mature RISC containing the guide
  strand (miRNA) as an RNP machinery. RISC binds mRNAs containing the seed-matched
  sites and recruits GW182/TNRC6 (light green) and CCR4–NOT complex (dark green) to
  induce translation repression, deadenylation, and mRNA decay (iv). (B) In the siRNA
  pathway, long double-stranded RNAs act as an RNA element (i, red), which is recognized
  and cleaved by Dicer (ii, light blue), producing ~21-nt double-stranded siRNAs (ii,
  asterisk). Upon loading of the siRNAs duplex into catalytic AGO (iii, yellow), the
  passenger strand is expelled and mature RISC containing the guide strand is formed
  as an RNP machinery. RISC mediates RNAi by cleaving perfectly complementary target
  RNAs (iv). (C) Primary piRNAs are transcribed from piRNA clusters as long, single-stranded
  piRNA precursor transcripts that harbor unknown or no apparent RNA elements (i).
  piRNA precursor transcripts are processed by nucleases including Zucchini (ii, turquois),
  generating piRNA precursors of intermediate size (ii, asterisk). The cleaved RNA
  containing uridine at the 5′ end is preferentially loaded into a PIWI protein (iii,
  yellow-green) followed by 3′ end trimming by a Trimmer (blue). The resultant piRNA-containing
  RISC acts as an RNP machinery and silences transposon RNAs by post-transcriptional
  cleavage and transcriptional silencing (iv). (D) During secondary piRNA biogenesis,
  RNA sequences that are complementary to primary piRNAs act as RNA elements (i, red)
  and are cleaved by primary piRNA-containing PIWI (e.g., Aub; ii, green). The cleaved
  RNA fragments (ii, asterisk), which tend to have adenine at the 10th base, are loaded
  into another PIWI protein (e.g., Ago3; blue) and mature into secondary piRNAs by
  3′ end trimming (iii). Cleavage of the original piRNA precursor transcript by the
  secondary piRNA drives the ping-pong cycle of the piRNA amplification loop (iv).
  (E–G) crRNAs are transcribed as long CRISPR transcripts (pre-CRISPR) containing
  repetitive sequences as RNA elements (i, red). The repeat is cleaved by specific
  Cas6 nucleases (types I and III) or tracrRNA and RNaseIII (type II) (ii, turquois
  and purple, respectively). Cleaved crRNAs containing a protospacer and a part of
  the repeat (ii, asterisk) may be trimmed by unknown nucleases and form a complex
  with effector Cas proteins (iii) that act as an RNP machinery with sequence-specific
  nuclease activity (iv).
