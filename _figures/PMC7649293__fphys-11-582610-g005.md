caption: 'Predicted model of Msx2 and Sp6 function during amelogenesis: We show that
  the two transcription factors Msx2 and Sp6 regulate each other’s expression (red
  arrows) and that Msx2 binds directly to Sp6 promoter (thick red arrow), suggesting
  that Sp6 is a direct target of Msx2. In addition, we show that Msx2 alone, like
  Sp6 (thick red inhibition lines) inhibits follistatin expression. In coordination
  with Sp6 (thin red inhibition line) the inhibition of follistatin expression is
  less robust. Collectively, these results raise the possibility that the Sp6 and
  Msx2 transcription factors interact closely with each other and work in a concerted
  manner to form part of a network that controls ameloblast life cycle and amelogenesis,
  in a cell autonomous manner.'
