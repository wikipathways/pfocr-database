caption: (A) Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway map in the male
  group. Genes in orange were upregulated in males and those in gray were not significantly
  differentially expressed. (B) Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway
  map in the female group. Genes in orange were upregulated in females and those in
  gray were not significantly different.
