caption: Hypothetical model of MeJA mediated A/S biosynthesis and growth reduction
  in L. officinale. MeJA elicitation leads to increased biosynthesis of JA-Ile which
  might be perceived by unidentified COI1 receptors leading to degradation of JAZs
  and relieving repression of MYC2. MYC2 might then directly upregulate the expression
  of precursors (mevalonate and/or phenylpropanoid) and/or A/S pathway genes leading
  to enhanced A/S biosynthesis. LeMYB1 and WRKY40 might directly increase the expression
  of pathway genes (crossed arrow) or interact with MYC2 to regulate A/S biosynthesis.
  Cross talk of MeJA-mediated JAZs with GA signalling might have led to the reduced
  growth of L. officinale. Blunt arrows represent inhibitory effects while complete
  arrows depict promoting effects. Red letters show genes that coexpressed in the
  red subnetwork.
