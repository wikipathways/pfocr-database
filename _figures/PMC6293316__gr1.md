caption: '- Canonical TGFβ signalling pathway. Active TGFβ homodimers signal via binding
  to specific transmembrane receptor complexes comprised of two type I (TβRI) and
  two type II (TβRII) serine/threonine kinase receptors. TβRI and TβRII are structurally
  similar with small cysteine-rich extracellular domains (ECD), single transmembrane
  domains (TMD) and highly conserved intracellular serine/threonine domains (S/TKD).
  TGFβ binding to TβRII induces the assembly of TβRII and TβRI receptors into a heteromeric
  complex, within which constitutively active TβRII phosphorylates TβRI at several
  serine and threonine residues within its conserved glycine-serine domain (GSD).
  R-Smads become phosphorylated by the activated TβRI at their C-terminal SSXS motif.
  The L45 loop of TβRI and the L3 loop of the R-Smad MH2 domain determine R-Smad receptor
  specificity, with ALK5 specifically phosphorylating Smads 2 and 3. The adaptor protein
  Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) can also facilitate recognition of R-Smads
  by the receptors. I-Smads contain MH2 domains and can act to turn off Smad TGFβ
  signalling by interfering with Smad-receptor or Smad-Smad interactions. Phosphorylated
  R-Smads form a heteromeric complex with Co-Smad, accumulate in the nucleus and directly
  regulate the transcription of specific target genes.'
