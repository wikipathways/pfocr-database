caption: Summary of the protective effects and mechanisms of GEN in DR progression.
  GEN decreases HG-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, and this effect is mostly
  dependent on upregulating the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway through GLP-1R.
  Nrf2 activation inhibits ROS accumulation and decreases NF-κB activation and the
  subsequent inflammatory response.
