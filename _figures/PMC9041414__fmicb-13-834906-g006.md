  phosphorylase; glgX, glycogen debranching enzyme; treX, maltooligosyltrehalose synthase;
  treY, maltooligosyl trehalose synthase; treZ, malto-oligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase;
  treS, trehalose synthase/amylase; pep2, maltokinase; glgE, alpha-1,4-glucan:maltose-1-
  phosphate maltosyltransferase; galU, UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase;
  otsA, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; otsB, trehalose-phosphate phosphatase; ndvA,
  beta-(1– > 2)glucan export ATP-binding/permease protein. *This appears to be a single
  type of glycogen debranching enzyme in the genus Defluviicoccus; dashed line in
  pathway schematic. **As described by , in all genomes except D. vanus, pep2 (maltokinase)
