caption: The development of PI3K inhibitors represents a promising strategy to enhance
  the efficacy of cancer vaccines through the modulation of immune responses. Cancer
  vaccines enable APCs to process and present antigens, stimulating naïve T cells
  through interactions with CD80/CD86 and TCRs. This leads to the differentiation
  of T cells into memory T cells and CTLs while simultaneously activating B cells
  and driving their maturation into plasma cells through the PI3K pathway. However,
  excessive PI3K signaling may lead to immune suppression, manifesting as T cell exhaustion
  and expansion of Tregs. PI3K inhibitors mitigate these effects by reducing Tregs
  and restoring T cell homing and activation, thereby boosting memory and effector
  T cell responses. When used alongside cancer vaccines, PI3K inhibitors enhance immune
  activation, strengthening both cellular and humoral responses to produce a more
  robust antitumor effect
