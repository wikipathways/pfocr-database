caption: T‐WT and T‐HCm infections differentially regulate the auxin signalling pathway
  at 10 days post‐agroinfiltration (dpai). Representation of the elements involved
  in the auxin signalling pathway with the expression data. Red rectangles represent
  up‐regulated genes, green rectangles represent down‐regulated genes, rectangles
  with both red and green colour indicate that some genes were up‐regulated and others
  were down‐regulated, and grey rectangles represent genes whose expression remained
  unchanged. ARF, AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR; AUX, AUXIN; IAA, INDOLE‐3‐ACETIC ACID; SAUR,
  SMALL AUXIN‐UP RNA; TIR, TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE.
