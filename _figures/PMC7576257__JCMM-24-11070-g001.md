caption: The TRAIL signalling pathway. A, Apoptotic signalling pathway. The binding
  of soluble TRAIL to the homotrimer of DR4/5, the DD on receptors, the recruited
  FADD and pro‐caspase 8 form the DISC complex, which triggers autocatalytic activation
  of caspase 8 in DISC. Subsequently, in (A1) extrinsic pathway, caspase 8 activates
  caspase 3/6/7 directly; in (A2) intrinsic pathway, caspase 8 cleaves Bid into tBid
  which later interact with Bax/Bac on the mitochondrial membrane leading to lysis
  of mitochondria. The Cyt‐C released from mitochondria cleaves pro‐caspase 9 into
  caspase 9 in apoptosome complex, which in turn activates caspase 3/6/7. The effector
  caspase 3/6/7 activated by both pathways induces cell apoptosis. B, Non‐apoptotic
  signalling pathway. Adaptor proteins including TRADD, TRAF2, RIP1 and IKK‐γ are
  recruited to form the secondary signalling complex through a serious complex processes
  involving several molecules such as NF‐κB, P38/MAPK, JNK, PI3K/Akt and ERK. These
  pathways induce cell survival, proliferation and migration among other processes.
