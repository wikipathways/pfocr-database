caption: A. S. aureus strains were cultivated exponentially in TSB medium and sampled
  at OD600~0.5-0.6. Changes in relative intracellular abundance of selected amino
  acids and biosynthetic intermediates are shown and plotted on a log2 scale relative
  to UAMS-1. Mean intracellular metabolite abundances are >1.5-fold altered in the
  codY null mutant relative to UAMS-1 as judged by a Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05)
  and across all six strains as judged by Cuzick’s test for trend (p < 0.01) (). Complete
  data and statistical analysis can be found in . B. Lysine, methionine and threonine
  are derived from aspartate and are collectively known as the aspartate family of
  amino acids. Pyruvate serves as a precursor for both lysine and ILV synthesis. The
  pathway bifurcates at aspartate semialdehyde. Differential expression in the codY
  null mutant suggests increased flux through this pathway. o-acetyl-HS, o-acetyl
  homoserine; HS, homoserine; HS-P, homoserine-phosphate.
