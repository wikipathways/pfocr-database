caption: Axon injury triggers elevation of axonal Ca2+ by several mechanisms. Ca2+
  elevation leads to activation of adenylyl cyclase and elevated cAMP levels, leading
  to PKA activation. PKC may be also activated by the injury-induced Ca2+ transient.
  Injury signals, possibly Ca2+ or MT depolymerization, result in activation of DLK-1
  and the entire DLK-1/MKK-4/PMK-3 cascade. The MLK-1/MEK-1/KGB-1 pathway is activated
  in parallel by unknown signals. The DLK-1 pathway stabilizes CEBP-1 mRNA in axons,
  and is likely to have other targets.
