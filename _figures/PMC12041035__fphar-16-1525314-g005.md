caption: Exosomes mediate cell regeneration, repair, and fibrosis. HG-treated GECs
  secrete more TGF-β1 mRNA-rich exosomes, which enhance the expression of α-smooth
  muscle actin (α-SMA), promote proliferation, and lead to excessive production of
  extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs) in GMCs via the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway,
  ultimately resulting in renal fibrosis (Wu et al., 2016). EVs derived from damaged
  podocytes can activate the ERK and p38 pathways in HK2 cells, thereby increasing
  fibronectin and collagen IV expression and promoting apoptosis (Jeon et al., 2020).
  Additionally, hypoxia-treated renal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E) release exosomes
  with increased miR-150-5p expression, thus targeting cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1)
  to promote fibroblast activation and exacerbate renal fibrosis (Zhou et al., 2021)
