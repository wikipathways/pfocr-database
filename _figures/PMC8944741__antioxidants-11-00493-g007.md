caption: 'Multi-target mechanism displayed by Rutaceae family plant extracts and carbazole
  alkaloids in neurodegenerative diseases. Phyto extracts and carbazole alkaloids
  from Rutaceae family exerted a multi-target approach in ameliorating symptoms of
  AD. PP2A and BDNF activity/expression was decreased in AD, which stimulated the
  hyper-phosphorylation of Tau and APP, leading to overproduction of Aβ. Phyto-carbazoles
  prevented Aβ aggregation by inhibiting cleavage of the APP by BACE-I, as well as
  by upregulating the expression of PP2A and BDNF. This caused a shift in the non-amyloidogenic
  pathway and reduced the levels of produced Aβ. A number of phyto-carbazoles were
  shown to reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators
  (IL-6, IL-1β, NF-kβ, TNF-α, iNOS, COX-2). Nrf2/HO-1 was an antioxidant signaling
  pathway, which was required for neuronal cell proliferation and survival. Down-regulation
  of this pathway was associated with various NDs. Phyto-carbazoles provided the neuroprotection
  by upregulating the expressions of the Nrf2/OH-1 pathway. They also reduced the
  oxidative stress by increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH,
  GRD, GPx) and reducing lipid peroxidation (LPO). Caspase-3 and Bax were responsible
  for neuronal death and were up-regulated in AD. Phyto-carbazoles down-regulated
  their expressions and prevented apoptosis. ACh, a neurotransmitter essential for
  processing memory and learning, was decreased in both concentration and function
  in AD. Decreased levels of ACh could be restored by the AChE and BChE inhibitory
  activity of phyto-carbazole alkaloids. Overproduction of NO was linked to neuroinflammation,
  mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity in NDs. The increased levels of NO were
  also controlled by phyto-carbazole and plant extracts from the Rutaceae family.
