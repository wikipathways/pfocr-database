caption: Model summarising metabolic changes in sentitive versus resistant melanoma
  cells upon BRAF inhibition. a BRAFV600E, in addition to its well known effects on
  the cell cycle and anti-apoptosis, leads to upregulation of glucose uptake and LDH-A,
  promoting aerobic glycolysis and cell growth. Moreover, activation of BRAF, leads
  to the induction of genes involved in antioxidant defense. b Upon treatment with
  BRAF inibitors, or other MEK/ERK pathway inhibitors, glycolysis is inhibited. Changes
  in metabolic fluxes through the TCA cycle together with the inhibition of the transcription
  of antioxidant genes, induce ROS. The increasing levels of ROS activate PDKs, which
  in turn inactivate PDH, thus reducing pyruvate use in the TCA cycle, which in a
  negative regulatory loop, inhibit further ROS production. c In BRAF inhibitor resistance,
  the MAPK pathway is reactivated by compensatory mechanisms and as a consequence
  glycolysis and antioxidant-defence genes are reactivated. Glycolysis produces ATP,
  nucleotides (via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)), NADPH (for antioxidant defense
  via PPP) and amino acids. The cells become addicted to an oxidative metabolism with
  glutamine (Gln) feeding anaplerotically into the TCA cycle to produce NADH, amino
  acids, ATP (via Oxphos), fatty acids (via AcetylCoA) and ROS. These ROS can be kept
  in check by NADPH, which is produced by the PPP and by antioxidant gene transcription
  downstream of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. At need, PDKs are activated by ROS and
  PDH is inhibited. This prevents pyruvate from entering the TCA and ROS to reach
  toxic levels. d In BRAF inhibitor resistance of melanoma, pharmacological inhibition
  of PDKs releases the brake on pyruvate entry into the TCA and causes unchecked pyruvate
  use, associated with an increase in ROS production. This increase in ROS tilts the
  balance towards cell death. Thus potent nonomolar PDK inhibitors could efficiently
  reduce the viability of BRAFi-resistant cells or might prevent or delay BRAFi resistance
