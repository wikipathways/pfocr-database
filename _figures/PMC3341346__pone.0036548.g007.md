caption: Given the potential of Baboon to phosphorylate and activate dSmad2 and Mad,
  we present several configurations of Baboon, dSmad2 and Mad interaction that would
  generate different signaling outputs. In each schematic, only the most relevant
  pathway components are drawn. The first model represents a logic gate, where the
  ability of Baboon to phosphorylate Mad is strictly controlled by the expression
  of dSmad2 in that cell (A). Another model incorporates the observed degradation
  of dSmad2 in response to Baboon signaling (B). The final model (C) incorporates
  feed-back or feed-forward of Mad activity through dSmad2 regulation. If P-Mad positively
  regulated dSmad2 this would prevent the complete loss of dSmad2. Conversely, if
  P-Mad negatively regulated dSmad2 expression, this would enforce the switch from
  Baboon signaling through dSmad2 towards Mad.
