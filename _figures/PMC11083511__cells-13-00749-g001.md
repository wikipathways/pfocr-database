caption: Subsets and functions of CD4+ T cells. CD4+ TNs initiate immune responses
  primarily by secreting specific cytokines after activation and differentiation into
  various effector subtypes. The differentiation of each subset is dependent on the
  activation of various transcription factors. T-bet, GATA3, IRF4, RORγt, AHR, Foxp3,
  and Bcl-6 are the transcription factors for Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, Tfh, and
  Treg, respectively. Th1 cells, typically stimulated by intracellular pathogens such
  as bacteria and viruses, produce IFN-γ and TNF-α. Th1 cells enhance the host’s anti-infection
  capabilities and promote pathogen clearance by releasing cytokines, particularly
  IFN-γ, thereby playing a defensive role. Th2 cells secrete cytokines such as IL-4,
  IL-5, and IL-13 and are involved in mediating immune responses against bacteria,
  allergens, and toxins. The hallmark cytokine of Th17 is IL-17. Th17 cells can identify
  and monitor tissue damage and inflammatory conditions in the body and guide the
  inflammatory response and tissue repair process. Th17 cells interact with and regulate
  other immune cells and maintain immune system balance through self-regulation. TNs
  differentiate into Th9 cells under the promotion of TGF-b and IL-4, mainly secreted
  by Th2 cells. Although Th2 and Th9 share the STAT6 signaling pathway, there are
  other transcriptional differences that distinguish them. For example, PU.1, an ETS
  family transcription factor, is highly expressed in Th9 cells and is associated
  with the secretion of IL-9 by Th9 cells, while inhibiting Th2 differentiation. Treg
  cells primarily secrete TGF-β and IL-10, demonstrating immunosuppressive functions.
  Treg cells are mainly involved in immune tolerance and regulation, ensuring an appropriate
  immune response to foreign antigens and preventing excessive immune responses leading
  to autoimmune diseases and excessive inflammation, thus maintaining immune system
  tolerance to self-antigens. Tfh cells are located in B-cell follicles and directly
  participate in humoral immunity by promoting germinal center (GC) reactions and
  the differentiation of memory B cells and plasma cells. Tfh cells highly express
  the master transcription factor Bcl-6, inducible co-stimulatory molecule (ICOS),
  programmed death-1 (PD-1), and chemokine receptor CXCR5. Tfh-cell differentiation
  is mediated by the production of IL-6 and IL-21, which induce the expression of
  the Bcl-6 transcription factor through the STAT3 signal. Initial T cells differentiate
  into Th22 cells in the presence of IL-6 and TNF-α. The hallmark cytokine of Th22
  cells, IL-22, is a member of the IL-10 family, expressing aryl hydrocarbon receptor
  (AhR) and CCR10
