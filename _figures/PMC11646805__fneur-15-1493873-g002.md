caption: 'Diagram of endothelial cell mutant Gαq signaling (p.R183Q in GNAQ) and the
  primary affected downstream pathways, the Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK and mTOR pathways, within
  the context of the blood brain barrier. The alpha subunit becomes active when bound
  to GTP, which promotes PLCß to cleave PIP2 into DAG and IP3. DAG is able to activate
  PKC, which can then phosphorylate a variety of proteins. In this case, PKC can initiate
  the activation of the Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK pathway or phosphorylate ZO, which interacts
  with claudin-5 to maintain the integrity of endothelial tight junctions. ERK may
  stimulate cellular proliferation or also play a role in PI3K/Akt inhibition. PIP2
  may also be converted into PIP3 by PI3K; PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3 back to PIP2.
  PIP3 activates the Akt signaling pathway once bound to Akt, which can inhibit TSC1/2
  via phosphorylation. TSC1/2 are negative regulators of mTOR due to their inhibitory
  mechanism on RHEB, an activator of mTOR. The inhibition of TSC1/2 by Akt allows
  for RHEB to activate mTOR. Proper expression of mTOR activates S6K1, which then
  phosphorylates the 40S ribosomal subunit S6 protein (phosphorylated-S6). Increased
  levels of phosphorylated-S6 result in increased cellular proliferation, protein
  synthesis and blood brain barrier permeability. Sirolimus acts as an inhibitor of
  mTOR by causing rapid inactivation of S6K1, and as a result, preventing phosphorylation
  of the S6 protein and further cellular proliferation as well as vascular growth.
