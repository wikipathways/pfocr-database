caption: Human micro RNA (miRNA) pathway. The general steps of the human miRNA pathway
  are illustrated starting with expression of a primary miRNA (Pri-miRNA) from a cell’s
  chromosomes (bottom, left). The Pri-miRNA is recognized by the endonuclease Drosha
  in complex with the RNA binding protein DiGeorge syndrome chromosomal region 8 (DGCR8).
  Drosha cleaves the Pri-miRNA into a precursor miRNA (Pre-miRNA) with a 3′ overhang.
  The Pre-miRNA is then exported to the cytoplasm by the Exportin 5 transporter complex
  and recognized by the endonuclease Dicer in complex with the Trans-activation response
  RNA binding protein (TRBP). Dicer cleaves the loop off of the Pre-miRNA to generate
  a mature miRNA. Following recruitment of additional proteins, including an Argonaute
  (Ago) protein, the passenger strand of the miRNA is removed and the miRISC complex
  targets complementary sequences in mRNA transcripts for translational repression
  or targeted degradation (bottom, right).
