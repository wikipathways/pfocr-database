caption: The classical complement cascade can result in an opsonization, or marking
  of cells for phagocytosis, and lysis of bacteria. It can also result in an augmented
  inflammatory response. A. Effect of aging on complement component activation. B.
  Effect of RLX on reversal of complement activity. Red boxes indicate significant
  alterations of specific complement components. Red and blue thermometer markers
  next to specific components indicate increased and decreased component expression,
  respectively. For key describing complement components, see https://portal.genego.com/help/MC_legend.pdf.
