caption: The role of the TSCC in the mTORC1 signaling pathway. (A) The TSCC, selected
  upstream regulators and downstream effectors. The TSCC is shown comprising a pseudo-symmetrical
  TSC2 dimer (blue) interacting with two intertwined TSC1 molecules (green), and one
  TBC1D7 molecule (orange) bound to the one end of TSC1 dimer. Selected mTORC1 upstream-input
  signaling and downstream-output signaling pathways and their physiological effects
  are shown. (B) Cells with inactivating mutations within TSC1 or TSC2 possess constitutively
  activated RHEB. RHEB activates the mTORC1 signaling network, leading to increased
  protein translation and cell growth on the one hand and decreased autophagy and
  apoptosis on the other hand, among many other effects, all of which results in abnormal
  cell growth
