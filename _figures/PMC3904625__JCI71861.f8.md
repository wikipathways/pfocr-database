caption: (A) In healthy individual, RUNX1/FLI1 complex negatively regulates ANKRD26
  gene expression in MKs. The activity of the TPO/MPL/MAPK/ERK pathway progressively
  decreases during MK differentiation, which is necessary for efficient PPT formation.
  (B) In THC2 patients, the mutations in 5′ UTR of the ANKRD26 gene prevent RUNX1/FLI1
  inhibition, leading to the overexpression of ANKRD26 expression in MKs. According
  to published data (), ANKRD26 would accumulate at the inner part of the cell membrane
  and would modify TPO/MPL signaling, leading to the MAPK/ERK overactivation, followed
  by a profound defect in PPT formation.
