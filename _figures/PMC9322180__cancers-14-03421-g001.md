caption: 'Simplified representation of the proteins expressed by the genes involved
  in cholestasis disorders and the main pathway of synthesis, transport and reuptake
  of BA in the liver and in the gut. Here we summarized the primary inherited cholestatic
  disorders in which metabolic and hepatobiliary diseases cause impaired BAs excretion.
  BAs are synthesized from cholesterol by CYP7A1 and then transported into canaliculi
  through the BSEP (PFIC2). Liver storage of BAs leads to liver injury, itching and
  increased risk of HBCs. Other constituents of bile include PC, transported by canalicular
  MDR3 (PFIC3), and PS, shuttled by canalicular ATP8B1 (PFIC1). Between disorders
  of membrane transporter or polarity, there is Dubin Johnson syndrome, where mutations
  in ABCC2 cause defects in MRP2, organic anions and bilirubin glucuronide transporter.
  Instead, ATP8B1 encodes MDR1 that translocates drugs and phospholipids across the
  hepatocyte membrane; it is responsible for developing resistance to anticancer drugs.
  The TJP2 (PFIC4), Claudine (neonatal ichthyosis sclerosing cholangitis), and USP53
  (PFIC8) proteins are necessary to maintain the canalicular membrane polarity of
  hepatocytes and inhibit the reflux of BAs back into the cell: disorders of cytoskeletal
  and tight junction proteins cause cholestasis. The primary regulator of BAs metabolism
  is FXR (PFIC5): FXR inhibits CYP7A1 expression, stimulates the synthesis of FGF-19
  to inhibit CYP7A1 expression through the FGFR4 pathway in the hepatocytes, stimulates
  BSEP to export of BAs, downregulates NTCP repressing the uptake of BAs by the liver,
  finally increases the expression of OST-α/β involved in BAs excretion from the liver
  to the portal vein and in intestinal reuptake. MYO5B, responsible for a form of
  PFIC and microvillous inclusion disease, interacts with RAB11A, altering the targeting
  of BSEP to the canalicular membrane via ARE; mutations in genes encoding RE-associated
  proteins such as MYO5B, VPS33B, and VIPAR (arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and
  cholestasis syndrome—ARC) highlights the role of the RE in establishment and maintenance
  of hepatocyte polarity. BAs are carried into the hepatocyte by NTCP, OST-α, and
  OST-β on the basolateral membrane. Instead, ASBT on the ileal enterocyte reabsorbs
  approximately 95% of BAs, which enter the portal circulation via enterocyte transporters
  OST-α, OST-β, and MRP3. Mutations in SLC51A encoding the OSTα-OSTβ proteins cause
  PFIC6. Together with FXR, TGR5 is a primary BAS-sensing receptor involved in the
  interaction between BAs and microbiota; it is a negative regulator of the HCC envelope
  through its anti-inflammatory properties and abilities to guarantee correct homeostasis
  of BAs. SLC25A13 gene encodes the calcium-binding protein citrin, an aspartate–glutamate
  carrier sited within the inner mitochondrial membrane. Citrin plays a crucial role
  in protein, nucleotide, and urea synthesis in several metabolic pathways. Mutations
  in SLC25A13 lead to neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency
  (NICCD) and increased susceptibility to HBCs. Cell–cell Jagged/Notch interactions
  are critical for the differentiation of cells in the early phases of development.
  The ligand–receptor link induces proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor and
  release of the NICD. The NICD translocates into the nucleus where it activates RBPJκ,
  thus promoting Notch target genes’ transcription, including HNF1B. The persistent
  over-activation of Notch way in hepatic precursor cells leads to downstream RBPJk-dependent
  transcription activity, failing repair cell damage, induction of liver fibrosis
  and secondary HCC. Mutations in JAG1 and NOTCH2 genes are responsible for Alagille
  syndrome, while HNF1B is a target gene upregulated by NOTCH signalling. HNF1B regulates
  the differentiation of hepatoblasts into ductal plate cells and the inclusion of
  the developing duct into the portal space; mutations in the HNF1B gene have been
  associated with renal cysts and diabetes syndrome neonatal or late-onset cholestasis
  and some tumours, including liver cancer. CFTR (responsible for cystic fibrosis)
  is a chloride channel expressed by secretory epithelia, including the biliary epithelium
  in the liver. Furthermore, mutations affecting the function of CFTR can cause a
  cholestatic disorder: biliary architecture changes, severe sclerosing cholangitis,
  focal biliary cirrhosis and multi-lobular biliary cirrhosis complicated by portal
  hypertension are features of cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD). Finally, we omitted
  KIF12 in the figure since its localization in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane
  is uncertain: mutations in the KIF12 gene are associated with PFIC8. Abbreviations:
