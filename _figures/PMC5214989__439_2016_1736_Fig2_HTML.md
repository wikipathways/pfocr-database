caption: Mitonuclear gene groups associated with disease in GWAS are significantly
  enriched for protein–protein interactions. STRING networks generated from the gene
  products of mitonuclear genes associated with a cancer, b inflammatory disease,
  c neurodegenerative disease, d metabolic disease, and e cardiovascular disease.
  Number of disease-specific GWAS catalog appearances indicated by the shade of the
  network symbol. Isolated gene products with no network interactions omitted from
  these plots. f Total genes in each disease group, percentage present in each interaction
  network, and p values for enrichment of protein–protein interactions by STRING pathway
  analysis. Infectious disease and psychological disorders were not enriched for protein–protein
  interactions (see Fig. S2). g Number of network interactions for each mitonuclear
  gene appearing once or more than once in the GWAS catalog by disease group; ***p < 0.0005,
  ****p < 0.0001, †p = 0.15 by pairwise t test. (see Supplemental File 4) (C cancer,
  ID inflammatory disease, ND neurodegenerative disease, MD metabolic disease, CVD
  cardiovascular disease)
