caption: Scheme of metabolic and regulatory relationship between Gpd1p and Pnc1p and
  regulatory roles of peroxisomes as stress-relief valves. A, Gpd1p converts dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate and NADH into glycerol 3-phosphate and NAD+. The protein deacetylase Sir2p
  utilizes NAD+ as co-substrate. Hydrolysis of NAD+ by Sir2p results in the formation
  of nicotinamide and acetyl-ADP-ribose. Deacetylated histones trigger transcriptional
  gene silencing and lead to an elongated replicative life span. The nicotinamidase
  Pnc1p initiates the NAD+ salvage pathway by converting nicotinamide into nicotinic
  acid. Although high levels of NAD+ activate Sir2p, the breakdown product nicotinamide
  acts as a potent noncompetitive inhibitor of Sir2p. B, effects of hyperosmotic stress
  and stress relieve on the steady-state level of Pex21p, peroxisomal localization
  of Pnc1p and Gpd1p and modulation of the stress response.
