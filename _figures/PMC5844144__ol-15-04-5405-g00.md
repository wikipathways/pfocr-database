caption: Ferroptosis-associated metabolic networks. Several metabolic pathways are
  involved in ferroptosis in cells. The trans-sulfuration and pentose phosphate pathways
  are crucial for Cys and GSH maintenance, which promote ferroptosis. GSH synthesis
  involves selenoproteins, including glutathione peroxidase 4. The mevalonate pathway,
  which sustains isopentenyl pyrophosphate/farnesyl pyrophosphate for selenoproteins,
  may also be a major cellular redox regulator. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation is
  regulated by metabolic enzymes in lipid synthesis. Inducers of ferroptosis are indicated
  in red, and inhibitors of ferroptosis are indicated in green. The question marks
  indicate the stochastic relationships between molecules. GSH, glutathione.
