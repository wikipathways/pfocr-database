caption: Schematic representation of the therapeutic implications of miRNAs and lncRNAs
  in AKI. In this comprehensive depiction, various miRNAs and lncRNAs play crucial
  roles in modulating different aspects of AKI. (A) The MALAT1/miR-135b-5p/NLRP3 signaling
  cascade influences LPS-induced cell pyroptosis, apoptosis, and inflammation. (B)
  MiR-21-5p, through exosome-mediated delivery, attenuates sepsis-induced AKI by suppressing
  RUNX1, leading to a reduction in serum inflammatory response, enhanced renal function,
  and diminished pathological damage. (C) CASC2, through the miR-545-3p/PPARA axis,
  mitigates LPS-induced damage in renal cells. The (D) SNHG14/miR-495-3p/HIPK1 axis
  and (E) SNHG5/miR-374a-3p/TLR4/NF-κB pathway contribute to the modulation of sepsis-induced
  AKI, influencing cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammatory cytokine
  production. (F) IRAR, a lncRNA, emerges as a potential target for AKI prevention,
  controlling immune cell infiltration and proinflammatory responses. (G) MiR-874-3p,
  induced by HucMSC-Exos, controls necroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells,
  offering a strategy to lessen cell damage and improve repair. (H) LncRNA 122049,
  by inhibiting IR-induced renal cell death through the miR-330-5p/ELK1 axis, demonstrates
  a potential therapeutic intervention for ischemic AKI. (I) NORAD, through the miR-577/GOLPH3
  axis, reduces kidney injury, inflammatory response, and apoptosis in LPS-stimulated
  cells, highlighting the intricate regulatory network of miRNAs and lncRNAs in AKI
  therapeutics
