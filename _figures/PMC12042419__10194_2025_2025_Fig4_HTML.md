caption: A schematic illustration of NOTCH3 signaling pathway involvement in the pathogenesis
  of CADASIL. NOTCH3 receptor is affected by a complex processing, including cleavage
  and activation steps. In the absence of NOTCH3 mutations, NOTCH3 receptor binds
  to its ligand. Ligand binding results in the engulfment of N3 TMIC through the clathrin-dependent
  endocytosis. The N3ICD will then be cleaved by γ-secretase to be transferred into
  the nucleus to trigger the subsequent activation of NOTCH3 target genes. In the
  absence of NOCTH3, RhoA is downregulated, leading to the suppression of Rho kinase,
  which in turn decreases myosin phosphorylation. Contrarily, once the receptor, especially
  its extracellular domain is mutated (p.Cys428Ser and p.Cys455 Arg), the mentioned
  process is disrupted, affecting the ligand binding, and thus signal transduction
  mechanism. GOM deposition in the basement membrane involves the accumulation of
  NOTCH3.ECD (N3ECD) multimers. The mutant NOTCH3 triggers the generation of these
  multimers, contributing to their intracellular (N3ICD) aggregation. When the removal
  process of these aggregates is impaired, ER stress, cell death, and abnormal vascular
  smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth will be developed. GOM may also disrupt VSMC function,
  potentially affecting intramural periarterial drainage and contributing to white-matter
  degeneration. NOTCH3 signaling interacts with TGF-β via LTBP- 1 in GOM and RhoA
  to regulate vascular tone, driving CADASIL pathology [9, 100]
