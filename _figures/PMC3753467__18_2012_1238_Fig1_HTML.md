caption: IP3 instigates the activation and amplification of NFATc1. Depicted above
  is a schematic illustrating the stages of osteoclast differentiation, including
  recruitment of progenitors to the bone surface, cell–cell fusion, formation of the
  actin ring and ruffled border and bone resorption. In the early phase of differentiation
  (red-boxed), osteoclastogenesis is triggered by RANKL–RANK signaling, which activates
  PLCγ2 to generate IP3 from PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane. IP3 then stimulates
  calcium oscillations, which are required for subsequent activation of NFATc1. Knockout
  of the molecules in red have bone-related phenotypes largely because of impaired
  osteoclast differentiation (see the text for details). Red dotted lines indicate
  interactions between PIs and proteins. The dotted arrow indicates the Ca2+ oscillation-independent
  pathway to NFATc1 activation. This figure is modified from Kuroda et al., World
  Journal of Orthopedics (in press)
