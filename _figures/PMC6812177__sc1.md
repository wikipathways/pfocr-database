caption: Proposed mechanisms of inflammasome involvement in RTT OxInflammation.The
  scheme summarizes the basal and LPS + ATP-stimulated status of the inflammasome
  pathway by comparing the responses of CTR and RTT fibroblasts. As showed in the
  right panels, RTT fibroblasts were unable to further activate an inflammasome-dependent
  response to the pro-inflammatory stimulus with LPS and ATP (bottom panel). Indeed,
  already in basal conditions (upper panel), they exhibited a pre-activated state
  of the inflammasome machinery, consisting in increased NLRP3/ASC interaction, CASP1
  activation and cleaved IL-1β expression, coupled with an enhanced nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB p65 subunit. In addition, the deregulation of inflammasome pathway was
  associated with increased levels of inflammasome components in patient-derived serum.
  In conclusion, a state of constitutive inflammasome activation could play a key
  role in RTT oxinflammation by fueling and perpetuating the subclinical inflammatory
  condition observed in this syndrome.
