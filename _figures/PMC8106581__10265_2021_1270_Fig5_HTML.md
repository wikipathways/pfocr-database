caption: 'Representation of the NAC transcriptional regulatory network associated
  with stress adaptation from case studies of rice (Drought: Chung et al. , Heat:
  Fang et al. ) and wheat (Salinity: Zhang et al. , Huang et al. ). a During heat,
  ONAC003 (SNAC3) expression is induced upon perceiving stress. Binding of ONAC003
  with NAC-specific NACRS (NAC recognition sequences/site) and CDBS (Core DNA-binding
  sequence,) and is activated. This results in up-regulation of targets CATA (Catalase
  isozyme A-like), APX3 (Ascorbate peroxidase 3), APX8 (Ascorbate peroxidase 8), RbohF
  (NADPH oxidase), and Prx IIE2 (Peroxiredoxin), thereby reducing peroxide levels
  (H2O2), MDA (Malondialdehyde) and electrolytic leakage. This modulation of ROS metabolism
  by target gene up-regulation results in heat tolerance in rice plants. b OsNAC regulatory
  networks include the activation of OsNAC5, 6, 9, and 10 TFs during drought stress.
  Further, OsNAC activation leads to the up-regulation of various ERF (Ethylene responsive
  factor) domain genes. Target genes, such as OsERF1, OsERF54, OsERF57 and OsERF107,
  and OsERF9 are directly up-regulated by OsNAC5, OsNAC6, OsNAC9 and OsNAC10. The
  up-regulation of target genes (OsERF1, OsERF54, OsERF57, OsERF107, and OsERF9) leads
  to the increased expression of LAC26 (Laccase-22-like), TAG lipase 2 (Triacylglycerol
  lipase 2), Glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase 6, and OsEXP7 (expansin-A7-like), which
  altogether resulted in alteration of the root architectures for drought tolerance
  and enhanced grain yield in rice. c In case of salinity stress, TaNAC47 and TaNAC29
  expression is induced in response to stress signaling via the ABA dependent pathway.
  TaNAC47 binds to ABRE cis-elements and activates transcription. This leads to up-regulation
  of targets such as, RD29A (Responsive to desiccation A), RD29B (Responsive to desiccation
  B), GSTF6 (Glutathione S-transferase F6), RD20 (Responsive to desiccation 20), P5CS1
  (Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase 1), COR47 (Cold regulated 47) in Arabidopsis.
  This, in turn, leads to reduced water loss and increased proline and soluble sugar,
  further improving survival under salinity stress in plants. Similarly, increased
  expression of TaNAC29 during salinity stress leads to up-regulation of RD29b (Responsive
  to desiccation 29b) and ERD11 (Early responsive to dehydration) target genes, thereby
  enhancing SOD (Superoxide dismutase) and CAT (Catalase) activity, resulting in reduced
  water and enhanced salinity tolerance in Arabidopsis'
