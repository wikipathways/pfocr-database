caption: 'The proposed biosynthetic pathway of pogostone and its 4MVCoA precursor
  in P.Cablin. A, Proposed alternative pogostone biosynthetic pathways: 1) A pathway
  involving one type III polyketide synthase (PKSIII) that catalyzes the condensation
  of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to form 2-pyrone (4-Hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone), which
  is then acylated by one typical acyltransferase using 4MVCoA as substrate to form
  an unstable intermediate, followed by spontaneous rearrangement to form pogostone.
  2) A pathway involving one PKSIII that catalyzes the condensation of 4MVCoA and
  malonyl-CoA to form a tetraketide intermediate, which is then rearranged (spontaneously
  or by a cyclase) and cyclized by a cyclase to form pogostone. 3) A pathway involving
  one typical PKSIII that catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA
  to form a triketide intermediate, followed with condensation catalyzed by an unusual
  polyketide synthase with 4MVCoA as the extension unit to form a branched tetraketide
  intermediate, which is then rearranged by a cyclase to form pogostone. B, Proposed
  biosynthetic pathway of 4MVCoA. 4-Methylvaleric acid is derived from pyruvate through
  α-ketoacid elongation pathway, and catalyzed by an AAE to form 4MVCoA. PKSIII, type
  III polyketide synthase; AT, Acyltransferase; AAE. The carbon chain of the branched
  short-chain fatty acid precursor 4-methylvaleric acid and 4MVCoA is labeled in bold
  to show its incorporation into pogostone.'
