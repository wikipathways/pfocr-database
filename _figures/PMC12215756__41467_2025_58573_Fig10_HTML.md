caption: Model depicting the role of the glucose and glutamine metabolic pathways
  in the control of NCC delamination and migration. Metabolic activity undergoes significant
  changes during delamination and migration, transitioning from quiescence with reduced
  production of energy to active mitochondrial respiration for efficient energy production.
  This shift is driven in part by a change in glucose utilization from anabolism to
  active bioenergetics and by the function of GLS, a key enzyme in glutamine metabolism.
  During delamination, GLS accumulates into the nucleus under the control of glutamine,
  where it associates with β-catenin (red dots in top panels), a key player of the
  Wnt signaling pathway. Alternatively, GLS and β-catenin associate in the cytoplasm
  and are translocated together into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, GLS and β-catenin
  would participate in the control of expression of key genes, such as Snail-2, Foxd-3,
  and Cyclin-E, to regulate EMT and cell-cycle progression, two necessary events of
  the delamination process. At completion of delamination, Wnt signaling becomes inactive
  and GLS is no longer present in the nucleus. Instead, GLS displays its classical
  enzymatic activity in mitochondria to convert glutamine into glutamate, to support
  ATP production alongside glucose to promote NCC migration
