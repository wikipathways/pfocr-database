caption: Overall survival mechanism used by the Apicomplexan parasites in different
  host cells. Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium bind to the surface receptor of host
  cells through the ligands such as EGF, TNF-α, and parasitic surface proteins such
  as circumsporozoite protein (CSP). After invasion into the host cells such as enterocytes,
  macrophages, hepatocytes, etc., the parasite modify the host signaling pathway such
  as TRADD, NF-kB, PKB/AKT resulting in production and upregulation of anti-apoptotic
  proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 thereby
  stopping cytochrome-c (Cyt-c), TNF-alpha-related-apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
  and BAD, BAX production, and ensuring its survival in the host. Plasmodium parasite
  mainly modifies host PKB/AKT signaling pathway causing upregulation of anti-apoptotic
  protein and downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAD/BAX. Theileria
  schizont proliferates uncontrollably within the host macrophages and lymphocytes.
  Right after invasion, it upregulates anti-apoptotic proteins such as c-FLIP, IAPs,
  Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and proto-oncogenic proteins such as C-myc, antiapoptotic genes such
  as C-FLIP, Bcl-2, and matrix metallo-protein (MMP9) by majorly targeting host signaling
  pathways such as NF-κB, JNK/AKT, JAK/STAT, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/MAPK,
  and TGF-β2. The regulation of these host signaling pathways causes continuous survival
  and proliferations of the parasite infected cells which are also common in some
  cases.
