caption: Schematic of pathways that play important roles in melanocyte and melanoma
  development. (A) Schematic of melanocyte differentiation through the MITF axis.
  KIT receptor and kit ligand are essential for melanocyte development. NRAS, BRAF
  and MITF are activated by the KIT receptor. The expression of the MITF transcription
  factor is regulated by α-MSH that binds to MC1R. MITF is phosphorylated by ERK.
  Activation of MITF controls expression of genes that help regulate melanocyte proliferation,
  differentiation, pigmentation and survival. Mutant MITF, NRAS, BRAF and KIT are
  known melanoma oncogenes. (B) Schematic of the EGFR signaling pathway. Signaling
  is activated by a ligand binding to EGFR receptor that leads to its dimerization.
  Downstream pathways through RAS and PI3K are activated. RAS signaling occurs via
  MEK, ERK and p38; PI3K via PIP3 and AKT. Both pathways regulate cellular functions
  such as metastasis and apoptosis which are vital for melanoma progression. Mutations
  in EGFR, RAS, RAF, PTEN and PI3K occur in melanoma. (C) Diagram showing the CDKN2A/B
  locus and its signaling pathway. The top panel illustrates the genomic organization
  of the CDKN2A/B locus. CDKN2A encodes for 2 proteins, p14ARF and p16INK4a, which
  have identical DNA sequence in exons 2 and 3, while their first exons (E1a and E1b)
  are different. These proteins have different open reading frames and act in separate
  pathways. CDKN2B is located upstream of CDKN2A and encodes p15. p16INK4a and p15
  are inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6, which phosphorylate pRB, leading to progression
  from G1 to S phase. p14ARF acts as an inhibitor for HDM2 which regulates p53. The
  suppression of p16INK4A at this locus is the most common event reported in melanoma.
