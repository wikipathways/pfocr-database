caption: Schematic illustration of the biosynthetic pathway of amino acids. The abundance
  of aromatic ring containing amino acids is lower relative to other amino acids.
  The average abundance of the aromatic ring containing amino acid, Trp, is the lowest
  amongst others that are biosynthesized via phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate.
  Similarly, the abundance of Cys is relatively low compared to other amino acids.
  Ser is biosynthesized from 3-phosphoglycerate and Ser is subsequently used to produce
  Gly and Cys amino acids. The abundance of Cys is lower relative to Gly, suggesting
  the existence of allosteric feed-back inhibition of the biosynthesis of Cys by Ser
