caption: Comparative lipoate metabolism in protozoan parasites. (A) P. falciparum.
  In P. falciparum, lipoate synthesis and lipoate scavenging are segregated by organelle,
  with lipoate synthesis occurring in the apicoplast (A) and lipoate scavenging occurring
  in the mitochondrion (M). In the apicoplast, the type II fatty acid synthase (FAS)
  is believed to generate the octanoyl-ACP substrate for lipoate synthesis. Lipoate
  synthesis is then used to lipoylate the sole lipoylated complex in the apicoplast,
  the PDH. Despite the presence of the lipoate ligase LipL2 in the apicoplast, the
  PDH does not appear to be lipoylated through the scavenging pathway. In the mitochondrion,
  two lipoate ligases are present, LipL1 and LipL2, and the KDH E2, BCDH E2, and H
  protein are lipoylated through scavenging. (B) T. brucei. In procyclic-form T. brucei,
  lipoylated complexes are found in the mitochondrion (M) and appear to rely on type
  II FAS for lipoylation. Although a lipoate ligase is encoded in the genome, supplementation
  with exogenous lipoate does not restore lipoylation when lipoate synthesis is disrupted.
  In bloodstream-form parasites, the DLDH (*) localizes exclusively to the inner leaflet
  of the plasma membrane, where it may play a role in sugar transport. (C) T. vaginalis.
  T. vaginalis has two H proteins, and these are the sole lipoylated proteins encoded
  in its genome. These proteins localize to the hydrogenosomes (H). T. vaginalis encodes
  a lipoate ligase but no lipoate synthase or octanoyl transferase, and it is therefore
  expected to salvage lipoate from the extracellular milieu.
