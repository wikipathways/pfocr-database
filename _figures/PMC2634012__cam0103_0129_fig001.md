caption: A model for dTCTP function in growth control. dRheb GTPase stimulates Tor
  signaling, which in turn activates dS6K and CycE to regulate cell growth and proliferation,
  respectively. dRheb GTPase is inactivated by the GAP function of TSC1/2 complex.
  In contrast, dTCTP activates dRheb GTPases by promoting GDP-GTP exchange. dTCTP
  might have additional functions independent of the Tor pathway, such as inhibiting
  cell death. It remains to be determined if dTCTP regulates cell proliferation and
  cell survival in part through the Hippo signaling.
