caption: The T3SS regulatory network in KB (inhibitory conditions) in P. syringae.
  T3SS is inhibited in nutrient-rich media such as KB. RhpS is a histidine kinase.
  P-RhpR represses the transcription of hrpRS by binding the inverted repeats in the
  upstream regions. Other regulators, including CbrB2, EnvZ/OmpR, HrpV, and HrpT,
  also control this pathway under inhibitory conditions. CbrB2 and OmpR suppress the
  expression of hrpL, hrpK1, hrpZ1, and hrpA2. CbrB2 directly restrains hrpRS transcription.
  Lon acts as a negative regulator of T3SS by degrading HrpRS.
