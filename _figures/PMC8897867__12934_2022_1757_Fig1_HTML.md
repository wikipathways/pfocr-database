caption: 'Expression levels of Znf1 target genes during glucose–xylose shift. Relative
  expression levels of genes involved in xylose metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway,
  glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycerol metabolism and TCA cycle were examined using
  RT-qPCR. Changes in the levels of mRNAs were indicated as following: 2% xylose shift
  in the wild-type strain (the X rectangle box), in the wild-type strain relative
  to the znf1∆ strain during the 2% xylose shift (the Y rectangle box) and, in the
  wild-type strain relative to the znf1∆ strain during growth in 2% glucose (the Z
  rectangle box). Green, red or yellow color box indicated genes whose expression
  was either activated/induced, repressed or unaltered by xylose or the transcription
  factor Znf1, respectively. The relative expression levels were obtained via the
  comparative Ct method for quantification of the ∆∆Ct values. Altered expression
  more than 2-folds was considered significant. The arrowheads in the figure represent
  the direction of enzymatic reactions. Abbreviations: ADH1, alcohol dehydrogenase
