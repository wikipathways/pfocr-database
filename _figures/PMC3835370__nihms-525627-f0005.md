caption: A) Ribosomes consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit and catalyze
  protein synthesis. Small and large subunits are composed of four RNA species and
  approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. The DBA-associated proteins are
  in both the small 40S and large 60S ribosomal subunit. They are encoded by RPS19,
  RPS24, RPS1, RPS15, RPS27A, RPS10, RPS29 and RPS26 which belong to the small ribosomal
  subunit, and by RPL5, RPL11, RPL35A, RPL15 and RPL36 which are components of the
  large ribosomal subunit. The DKC1 gene encodes the dyskerin protein, which has been
  implicated in ribosomal RNA pseudouridylation (Φ). The SBDS protein appears to be
  involved in the joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits to form the mature
  80S ribosome. AR mutations in SBDS, a key component of ribosomal assembly cause
  Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), a disorder of neutropenia and exocrine pancreatic
  insufficiency. SDS is not discussed herein because NGS studies have not been published
  in this disorder. Adapted from Shimamura and Alter Blood Reviews 2010;24(3):101-22B)
