caption: Signaling pathways leading to 3D invasion of ErbB2 transformed MCF10 cells
  over-expressing p130Cas. PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2 pathways are both activated during
  invasion triggered by ErbB2 transformation of p130Cas over-expressing mammary epithelial
  cells. ErbB2/p130Cas/Erk1/2 MAPK signalling pathway preferentially targets mTOR/p70S6K,
  whereas the ErbB2/p130Cas/PI3K/Akt cascade triggers Rac1 activation. Both signaling
  pathways are required for mammary epithelia invasion in 3D suggesting that they
  cooperate in the regulation of different processes that ultimately lead to cell
  invasion. The figure is modified from [].
