caption: Exposure to 21% O2 results in increased ROS and decreased antioxidant levels
  indicating oxidative stress. The elevated oxidative stress activates TNF pathway.
  Activated TNF induces activation of NF-κB family transcriptional regulators. Increase
  in NF-κB1/RelA complex binding to its target pro-inflammatory genes result in their
  upregulation. Green arrows indicate the direction of activation and black arrow
  indicates NF-κB1/RelA translocation to the nucleus.
