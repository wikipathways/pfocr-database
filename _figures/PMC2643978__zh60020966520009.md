caption: Model showing the mechanism of β-hydroxybutyrate utilization and glucose
  conservation in the heart and brain during hibernation. Long solid lines with arrowheads
  indicate active metabolic pathways, dashed lines with arrowheads indicate pathways
  with reduced activity, and a solid block across a line indicates pathway stoppage.
  Short vertical arrows pointing up indicate an increase in concentration or activity.
  Short vertical arrows pointing down indicate a decrease in concentration or activity.
  BHB, beta-hydroxybutyrate; MCT1, monocarboxylic acid transporter 1; PDK4, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinase 4; SCOT, succinyl CoA transferase; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle.
