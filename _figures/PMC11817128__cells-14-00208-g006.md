caption: The target protein involved in NGF-NTRK1 signal transduction controls key
  protein targets. The first three proteins, GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein
  2), SOS (son of sevenless), and RAS (GTPase HRas), participate in the MAPK signaling
  pathway (KEGG map04010), and their activity is regulated via the NGF-NTRK1 signaling
  pathway (Neurotrophin KEGG map04722). Additionally, RafB (proto-oncogene serine/threonine
  protein kinase), MEK5 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1), and ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase 5) proteins regulate and are regulated under the NGF-NTRK1 neurotrophin signaling
  pathway (KEGG map 04722). ERK initiates a phosphorylation cascade (estrogen KEGG
  map 04915) that results in the activation of the SF-1 transcription factors (Steroidogenic
  factor 1), CREB (cyclic AMP-binding protein), and ER (estrogen receptor alpha),
  which control cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and gonadotropin mRNA
  expression and secretion. SF-1, CREB, and ER lead to phosphorylation events that
  affect the expression of the STAR gene. ERK also activates cPLA2 (cytosolic phospholipase
  A2), which induces arachidonic acid release from membranous phospholipids. COX2
  catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin-G2 and subsequently
  to prostaglandin-H2, which will be converted to five different prostanoids, including
  PGE2 and PGF2α. TLR4, through the activation of NFκB and HIF1α (dotted line joining
  ERK), regulates ERK activity, thereby influencing inflammatory and steroidogenic
  responses mediated by the NGF-NTRK1 pathway. Additionally, p75NTR, a low-affinity
  receptor for NGF, may act in synergy with NTRK1 to amplify these signaling pathways,
  contributing to inflammatory and steroidogenic responses. The genes assessed by
  qPCR (upregulated in SELECs with NGF addition to culture) are shown in the orange
  box, while the prostaglandins measured by ELISA (upregulated in SELEC medium with
  NGF addition) are shown in the blue box
