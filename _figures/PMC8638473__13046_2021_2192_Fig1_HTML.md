caption: Pro- and anti-tumor effects of NMD inhibition. NMD has been shown to play
  a critical role in tumors, displaying, at the same time, a pro-tumor and tumor suppressor
  activity, depending on the genetic context and tumor microenvironment. NMD, degrading
  mRNAs with a PTC, protects cells from the formation of potentially toxic proteins.
  Indeed NMD pathway inhibition results in tumor cell toxicity due to the accumulation
  of mutated protein. Moreover, immunogenic peptides, derived from these proteins,
  could act as neoantigens able to activate T-cell response against tumor cells, inducing
  so an immune-dependent reduction of tumor growth. Furthermore, NMD physiologically
  regulates genes involved in DNA damage response, so NMD inhibition results in a
  reduction of tumor capacity to respond to DNA damage and in a greater sensitivity
  to chemotherapy. On the other hand, for its tumor-suppressor role, NMD is often
  inhibited by microenvironmental cues, as hypoxia or oxidative stress, determining
  an increased expression of ISR components, like ATF3 and CHOP, or antioxidant agent
  such as SLC7A11. In this way, NMD inhibition protects cancer cells from elevated
  level of ROS and reduced oxygen concentration allowing tumor adaptation to stress
  conditions. Moreover, impaired NMD was found to favor activation of the NF-kB pathway
  so inducing an inflammatory state and favoring tumor cell survival. Adapted from
