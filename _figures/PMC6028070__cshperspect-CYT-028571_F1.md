caption: 'The cytokine signaling and their major negative regulators. There are four
  types of cytokine receptors: (1) receptors that activate nuclear factor (NF)-κB
  and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases; (2) receptors that activate the Janus
  kinase and signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway;
  (3) transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptors; and (4) growth factor receptor
  family. Typical negative regulators are also shown. TNF, Tumor necrosis factor;
  TNFR, TNF receptor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; IKK, IκB
  kinase; SOCS/CIS, suppressor of cytokine signaling/cytokine-inducible Src homology
  2 (SH2)-containing protein; Spred, Sprouty-related protein with an EVH1 domain.'
