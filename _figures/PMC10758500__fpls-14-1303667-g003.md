caption: 'Depiction of the role of WRKY in the biosynthesis of flavonoid. The complex
  role of WRKY in regulating flavonoid biosynthesis highlights its crucial function
  in this pathway and subsequent stress responses in plants. The WRKY protein modulates
  flavonoid biosynthesis by controlling the expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes
  in various ways. MdWRKY1 and VqWRKY56 can influence the transcription of CHS, while
  VvWRKY26 can control CHI expression by forming the MBWW complex. PbWRKY75 might
  enhance the expression of DFR. MdWRKY11, MdWRKY71-L, MdWRKY40, and MdWRKY75 can
  directly or indirectly control the expression of UFGT. MdWRKY72, MdWRKY11, PpWRKY44,
  and PyWRKY26 can impact anthocyanin synthesis by forming the MYB-WRKY complex. In
  addition to positive regulation, MdWRKY41 also has a role in negatively regulating
  ANR synthesis. All these pathways influence the synthesis of anthocyanin or proanthocyanidin
  ultimately. Arrows represent positive regulation, and T-bars represent negative
  regulation. CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H: flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; ANR, anthocyanin
  reductase; UFGT, flavonoid 3-O-glycosyl-transferase.'
