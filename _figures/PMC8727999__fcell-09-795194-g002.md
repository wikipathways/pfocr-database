caption: HPE arises from a confluence of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors.
  Four signaling pathways in which gene variants have been identified in HPE patients
  are shown. Variants in genes identified in HPE patients are classified as driver
  genes, silent modifier genes, and predisposing gene variants. Driver genes are defined
  as those accepted to be essential to the phenotype of the patient carrying a variant
  and include SHH, ZIC2, SIX3, FGF8, and FGFR1. A single silent modifier gene (BOC)
  is listed; see text for further discussion. All other genes are categorized as predisposing
  gene variants. Variants of these genes may function as drivers in individual HPE
  cases, but the relative infrequency of their involvement currently makes this difficult
  to assess, as it is also possible that they can function as modifiers of a more
  critical insult, genetic or environmental. Variants in some additional genes identified
  in HPE cases are not shown because their roles in these pathways are not known [see
  (; ) for complete lists]. Three environmental risk factors are shown. PBO and THC
  both directly inhibit SMO. Ethanol inhibits Nodal signaling, but the direct target
  is not known. For simplicity, not every regulator of each pathway is pictured. See
  text for further details. The figure was created with BioRender.com.
