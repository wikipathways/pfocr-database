caption: Hypothetical scheme illustrating TGF-β/EMT signalling in SS. TGF-β activates
  both the canonical SMAD2/3 pathway and the non-canonical MAPK pathway, triggering
  the EMT process. An inflammatory microenvironment including proinflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-17, IL-22, and IL-6 may induce EMT through the TGF-β/SMAD and non-SMAD
  signalling pathways. The activation of transcription factors such as Snail, promotes
  the prolonged activation of EMT, repressing epithelial marker genes, as E-Cadherin,
  and activating genes regulating the mesenchymal phenotype, as Vimentin and Collagen
  Type 1. The epithelial cells trans-differentiated in myofibroblasts are responsible
  for progressive SG fibrosis. Alternatively, TGF-β can trigger the signals via non-SMAD
  pathways, such as the MAPK signalling cascade including phosphorylated ERK1/2, that
  ultimately lead to the activation of the EMT-dependent fibrosis program. An alternative
  hypothetical mechanism was also showed mediated by IFN-γ that, through the Jak1/Stat1
  activation, causes the SMAD7-mediated inhibition of TGF-β signalling.
