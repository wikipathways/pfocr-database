caption: Therapeutic strategies targeting the CHI3L1/IL13Rα2 pathway in the tumor
  microenvironment involve the use of blocking antibodies or inhibitors. Immunosuppressive
  macrophages, activated by PD-L1/PD-1 signaling, induce CHI3L1 expression in tumor
  cells, leading to the activation of naive macrophages and promoting the accumulation
  of immunosuppressive macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. This accumulation
  fuels tumor progression
