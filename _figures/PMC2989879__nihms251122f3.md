caption: In addition to conventional cell cycle regulatory target genes, E2fs have
  been reported to interact functionally with other transcription factors, such as
  Foxos, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), nuclear factor κB (NFκB), nuclear respiratory
  factor 1 (NRF1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), to modulate
  effects on autophagy, metabolism, mitochondrial mass and the redox response of cells.
  These activities are distinct from its role in regulating pro-apoptotic genes, but
  may indirectly impinge upon the viability of cells by determining the overall levels
  of nutrients, ATP, NAD+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS). For example, E2F1 cooperates
  with HIF to induce BNIP3 expression, which promotes mitochondrial autophagy in response
  to hypoxia, thereby limiting ROS and necrosis. E2F1 has also been shown to regulate
  the expression of other autophagy regulators, such as ATG1 and ATG8 (REF. ). E2F1
  modulates cellular ROS levels through inhibition of NFκB activity mediated by direct
  protein–protein interactions between E2F1 and the NFκB subunit RELA (REF. ). Multiple
  feedback loops operate at the transcriptional level, with NFκB feeding back to induce
  HIF, and E2Fs regulating Foxo expression, which in turn negatively modulates HIF
  activity through induction of the transcriptional co-activator CITED2 (REF. ). Upstream
  of HIF and Foxos, the SIRT1 deacetylase counters the activity of p300 and is dependent
  on available NAD+ for its ability to activate Foxos, its ability to promote RB turnover
  and its downstream interaction with and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ, coactivator 1α (PGC-1α),.
