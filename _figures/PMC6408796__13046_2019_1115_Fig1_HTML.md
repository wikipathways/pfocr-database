caption: p38MAPK signalling cascade. A multitude of extracellular stimuli and mitogens
  lead to the activation of p38MAPK signalling pathway consisting of a kinase network
  as diagrammatically represented in the figure. When activated by p38, MK2 gets exported
  to the cytoplasm (NLS gets masked and NES is functional) where it controls the transcript
  stability of tumor pathogenesis related mRNAs harbouring AREs in their 3′-UTRs via
  regulation of RNA-binding proteins
