caption: In normal mammary epithelium, DKK3 binds to LRP, a WNT pathway coactivator
  of Frizzled, which prevents the activation of the pathway in the presence of the
  WNT ligand. E-Cadherin binds to cytoplasmic β-catenin, which is degraded by GSK3β
  in the absence of WNT activation. The promoter of SHH (encoding the Hedgehog ligand
  SHH) is hypermethylated and the Hedgehog pathway is silenced. In breast cancer,
  however, the DKK3 promoter is hypermethylated, which leads to its downregulation.
  In the absence of DKK3, LRP can coactivate Frizzled in the presence of the WNT ligand,
  leading to phosphorylation of DSH, which inhibits GSK3β from degrading β-catenin.
  E-Cadherin is also downregulated via promoter methylation. In addition, the SHH
  promoter becomes hypomethylated, thereby upregulating the expression of SHH and
  activating the Hedgehog pathway via GLI1. Activation of the WNT and the Hedgehog
  pathways lead to stem cell renewal, EMT, metastasis, and tamoxifen resistance.
