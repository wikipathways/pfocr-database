caption: In normal gastric mucosa TP53 is wild-type and its expression is kept in
  check by Mdm2 and Mdmx. During progression to the intermediate stage of IM the TP53
  gene continues to be maintained in the wild-type state but protein expression levels
  are slightly elevated, possibly due to a decreasing Mdm2/x expression in a small
  proportion of cases. Mutations in TP53 occur at late stage in the progressive pathway
  in 56% of GC cases, accompanied by a decrease in Mdm2/x levels. In those GC samples
  which maintain a wild-type TP53 status Mdm2/x levels continue to remain elevated.
