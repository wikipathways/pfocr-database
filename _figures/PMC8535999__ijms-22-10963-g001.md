caption: Invasive pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung, intestine, kidney, and brain.
  (A) In the lung and intestine, SARS-CoV-2 may cross the epithelium barrier by ACE2
  receptor-mediated endocytosis or paracellular leaky pathway. The virion can then
  enter the bloodstream by the paracellular leak route or ACE2-mediated transcytosis
  in vascular endothelial cells. (B) In the kidney, SARS-CoV-2 detected in urine []
  may cause acute kidney injury (AKI) [] by ACE2-mediated renal reabsorption or paracellular
  leak. (C) SARS-CoV-2 in the urine may come from urothelial cells that receive the
  released virions from vascular endothelial cells [] through ACE2-mediated transport.
  (D) In the brain, SARS-CoV-2 from the bloodstream can pass through the intercellular
  space or be internalized into vascular endothelial cells by ACE2-mediated endocytosis.
  The virions across the vascular blood–brain barrier subsequently infect brain neurons
  by NRP1-mediated transcytosis.
