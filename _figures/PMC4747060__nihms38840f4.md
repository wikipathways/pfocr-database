caption: The biosynthetic pathway of mycolyl arabinogalactan. The polymer is formed
  on decaprenyl phosphate as shown. The order of the later events is not yet known;
  the ligation to peptidoglycan is shown as the last step. However, the arabinan and
  mycolates or just the mycolates may be added after ligation to peptidoglycan. The
  addition of the succinyl residue is not shown and the addition of the GalNH2 residue
  as shown in the figure is, in fact, speculative.
