caption: β-catenin may be activated and upregulated by a number of signaling components,
  and the canonical Wnt pathway serves as one of the most critical mechanisms for
  its expression. Upon interaction of Wnt ligands with cognate Fzd receptors and LRP5/6
  coreceptors, β-catenin is activated and translocates to the nucleus to interact
  with TCF/LEF transcription factors, which leads to target gene transcription. Additional
  β-catenin activators include PI3K/AKT signaling through TLR 2,6 stimulation, CD95/ERK
  signaling, and activation via disruption of E-cadherin interactions. β-catenin/TCF/LEF-mediated
  target gene transcription results in expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines,
  such as IL-10 and IL-27, which induce Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells, and TGF-β,
  which may induce FoxP3+regulatory T (Treg) cells. In addition, vitamin A metabolizing
  enzymes (RALDH 1/2) are produced to convert vitamin A to retinoic acid (RA), which
  also induces Treg differentiation. Accumulation of Tregs in the tissue microenvironment
  may result in inhibition of pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 cells. Pharmacological inhibition
  of Wnt/β-catenin may thus result in antitumor immunity, whereas use of pharmacological
  activators may lead to regression of inflammatory autoimmunity.
