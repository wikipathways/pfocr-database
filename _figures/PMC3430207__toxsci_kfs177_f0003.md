caption: Molecular relational network of genes modulated by BaP in lung tissues enriched
  for cancer function using IPA for all three doses with p53 at the central node.
  A network is a graphical representation of the molecular relationships between molecules.
  Molecules are represented as nodes and the biological relationship between two nodes
  is represented as a line. The gene list was derived from cancer-associated genes
  determined in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis functional analysis of significantly
  differentially expressed genes (). The networks were generated from cancer-associated
  genes differentially regulated in the 25mg/kg/day (green circle), 50mg/kg/day (blue
  circle), and 75mg/kg/day (pink circle) dose groups. Red color denotes upregulation
  and green color denotes downregulation.
