caption: Heat shock proteins and immunological pathways (A) HSP27 regulates the NF-κB
  pathway. In the NF-κB signaling pathway, nuclear factor κB mainly exists as a heterodimer
  of p65 and P50, and I-κBα is a major inhibitor of NF-κB, which combines with them
  to form a complex in the resting state. The dimers are held inactive in the cytoplasm
  by their interaction with I-kBα proteins. I-κBα is phosphorylated when stimulated
  by external signals, and after phosphorylation, I-κBα proteins undergo ubiquitin-dependent
  degradation by the proteasome, after which NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus,
  where it acts as a transcription factor. The interaction of HSP27 with the 26S proteasome
  is necessary for the degradation of phosphorylated I-κBα, and overexpression of
  HSP27 enhances the proteasomal degradation of phosphorylated I-κBα. (B) HSP70 negatively
  regulates NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles. After SARS-CoV infects cells, the virus envelope
  E protein triggers the activation of the NF-κB inflammatory signaling cascade, which
  activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 induces the maturation of
  caspase-1, which in turn activates the secretion of interleukins IL-1β and IL-18.
  While IL-1β is an important factor in inducing a rise in core body temperature,
  HSP70, produced in response to the heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), reduces the inflammatory
  response blocking NLRP3 and the articulator ASC to induce caspase-1 precursor maturation
  following a rise in body temperature.
