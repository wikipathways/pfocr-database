caption: The Proposed crosstalk model between TET1, WNT, mir200b, and miR494 in CRC
  progression. The reduction in TET family enzymes leads to the demethylation of DKK
  and SFPR genes, causing disruption of the WNT pathway in cancer. In addition, the
  decline in TET enzymes is also responsible for the epigenetic inactivation of miR-200b
  following the reduction in 5hmC levels. This dysfunction of miR-200b triggers the
  WNT signaling pathway, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis
