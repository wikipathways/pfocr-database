caption: Networks involved in the analyses involving males with nPFOS exposure. The
  genes neighboring the significant CpG sites (with greater than 10% change in beta
  value per unit of nPFOS change and with more than 1 significant CpG site per gene)
  were subjected to pathway analyses. One top network involving cell cycle, nervous
  system, development and function, and cardiac proliferation was identified.
