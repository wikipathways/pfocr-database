caption: Schematic diagram of the cannabinoid receptor-dependent mechanisms whereby
  AEA leads to tumor growth suppression and/or cell death. AEA may act via the Cb1
  receptor to activate the cAMP/PKA/MAPK pathway or to increase the production of
  ceramide. These effects ultimately result in a decrease in the expression of various
  growth factor receptors and decrease cell cycle progression. Alternatively, AEA
  may activate either Cb2 or VR1 to elicit a similar response, although the mechanism
  by which this occurs is not clear.
