caption: Regeneration in the liver can be broadly characterized into hepatocellular
  or biliary regeneration. In the former context, progenitor cells irradiate from
  the portal tracts, in which they are sheathed in laminin, which facilitates their
  expansion. Upon exit from the laminin niche, these cells are subject to differentiation
  cues, such as Wnt and HGF, which activate the pro-hepatocyte transcriptional cascade
  in HPCs. In biliary regeneration, HPCs emerge in a similar fashion, but they remain
  in the laminin ECM, in which fibroblasts are able to influence their maturation
  though activation of the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway influences the activation
  of the HNF6/HNF1β transcriptional network to correctly specify cholangiocytes.
