  renal injuries in patients with severe COVID-19(A) Pathways are displayed in square
  boxes, proteins are displayed in circles, while metabolites are displayed in hexagons.
  The Z score of the activity of a pathway is displayed as dots beside the respective
  pathway in a red (for serum) or blue (for urine) box, with its size representing
  the log10(p value) of each pathway and its color representing the Z score value.
  Relative protein or metabolite expression is labeled beside the respective molecule.
