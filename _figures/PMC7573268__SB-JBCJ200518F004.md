caption: Current and future applications of Class 1 systems. A, applications of Type
  I CRISPR-Cas effector complexes include transcriptional repression/activation, generation
  of long-range genomic deletions, generation of dsDNA breaks, and insertion of large
  DNA fragments (left to right). Subunits are colored as in . B, applications of Type
  III effectors include RNA knockdown by Csm or Cmr (left) and use of the Csm6 RNase
  in RNA diagnostics (right). Subunits are colored as in . Cas13 is an RNA-guided
  RNA nuclease from the Type VI CRISPR-Cas system. Trans cleavage of an RNA substrate
  containing adenosines (yellow) and uridines (red) by Cas13 leads to release of a
  linear hexaadenylate with a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (A6>P activator). A6>P can bind
  and stimulate Csm6 to cleave a fluorescent RNA reporter. C, future applications
  of Class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems. The multisubunit Type I and III complexes could be
  fused to diverse functional domains for DNA and RNA editing. Multiple subunits per
  effector complex could also facilitate multiplexing. The cOA signaling pathway of
  Type III systems could be harnessed for control of cellular states in prokaryotes
  or eukaryotes by coupling cOA-binding nucleases to a cOA synthetase. MTase, methyltransferase.
