caption: Representation of resveratrol cardioprotective effect. Resveratrol activates
  the Nrf2 signaling pathway, increasing the expression of antioxidant enzymes. It
  also reduces the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as caspase 3, via the
  PI3K/Akt pathway. Other effects are the reduction of inflammation and ferroptosis,
  which has been associated with reduced expression of TNFα, NfκB, TfR1, and increased
  activity of GPX4 after administration of resveratrol. The activation of SIRT1 is
  related to a decrease in intramitochondrial calcium concentration, which diminishes
  mitochondrial ROS production.
