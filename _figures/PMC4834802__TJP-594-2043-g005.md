caption: CR induces many pathways that are involved in changes in mitochondrial physiology
  by activating AMPK‐ and SIRT‐dependent pathways and inducing mitochondrial turnover
  by balancing mitochondrial biogenesis with induction of mitophagy of damaged mitochondria.
  This regulation reduces the production of ROS by damaged mitochondria, thus reducing
  oxidative damage. This damage is also reduced by the induction of cell antioxidant
  activities such as CAT, SOD and GPx and by preventing the activation of proinflammatory
  processes by blocking the NFκB pathway. On the other hand, the role of plasma membrane
  redox system regulation in the CR effect on cells remains to be clarified but it
  seems that in aged cells and tissues the induction of this system by activation
  of Nrf2 not only prevents lipid peroxidation in membranes but can also regulate
  the response to external factors such as local factors or insulin. We cannot discard
  a putative role of this system in the regulation of the insulin response preventing
  insulin‐resistance in aged cells.
