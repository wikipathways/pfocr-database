caption: Metabolic model representing the direct and indirect pathways of hepatic
  glycogen synthesis. Indirect pathway sources include gluconeogenic precursors that
  are metabolized via the anaplerotic pathways of Krebs cycle (i.e., pyruvate and
  gluconeogenic amino acids) as well as glycerol from lipolysis. Indirect pathway
  sources also formally include pyruvate derived from glucose, as indicated by the
  dashed line. The metabolic pathway sites for 2H-enrichment from 2H2O of glycogen
  position 5 (2H5; in orange), namely enolase and triose phosphate isomerase, and
  position 6S (2H6S; in green), namely fumarase in the Krebs cycle are indicated.
  The remaining is either preexisting, cycled or from direct pathway (in blue). Several
  metabolic intermediates were omitted for clarity. G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; Gly-3-P,
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; OA, oxaloacetate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; AA, amino acids.
