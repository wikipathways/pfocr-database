caption: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is dependent on the activation of intracellular
  molecule β-catenin. In the absence of Wnt-binding Fz receptors, β-catenin is isolated
  into a protein, phosphorylated, and subsequently degraded by the destruction complex.
  Upon binding to the Fzl receptors and LRP5/6 co-receptors, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathways is activated while the degradation complex of β-catenin is inhibited, allowing
  the newly synthesized β-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and transfer to the
  nucleus. Nuclear β-catenin can replace the transcription corepressors in TCF transcription
  factors and promote the activation of gene transcription programs.
