caption: Inhibition mechanism of IL-12 production through interaction of TIM-3 and
  Gal-9. Graphic representation of the TLR4-signaling pathway (black arrows) when
  activated by LPS (to simplify, not all proteins involved are shown), which induces
  phosphorylation of diverse nuclear factors, such as NF-κB (p50-p65), AP-1, and STAT1.
  These nuclear factors induce production of proinflammatory molecules like IL-12.
  When TIM-3 interacts with Gal-9, phosphorylation of the intracellular portion of
  TIM-3 is induced and activates the regulatory pathway mediated by this protein.
  While we do not yet know the precise inhibition mechanism in macrophages, studies
  have identified a decrease in STAT1 phosphorylation and an increase in STAT3 phosphorylation
  (red arrows). The result of this change is reduced IL-12 production and increased
  IL-23 production.
