caption: Interference in type I IFN production by HEV proteins. Activation of the
  RLR pathway and signaling by viral dsRNA are shown. Viral dsRNA is generated during
  HEV replication. “P” indicates phosphorylation. The red boxes indicate HEV proteins
  identified in this study as inhibiting the signaling steps indicated. The HEV X
  domain inhibits IRF-3 phosphorylation. HEV PCP inhibits K63-linked polyubiquitination
  of RIG-I and TBK-1. MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral signaling.
