caption: A merged network based on eight upstream regulators, of which E2f, ERBB2,
  IL6, HGF, and RABL6 were in a predicted activation state (z-score > 2) and let-7,
  TP53, and CDKN2A were in a predicted inhibition state (z-score < - 2). P-value of
  overlap for all upstream regulators is < 0.0029. The network is based on the list
  of 370 differentially expressed probe sets and displays the expression values derived
  from the comparison group BCBM vs. prBT (Additional file ). Upregulated molecules
  include ANGPTL4, ANLN, BCL3, BLM, BNIP3, BRIP1, BUB1, C5orf22, CA9, CCNE2, CCNG1,
  CDC25A, CDC45, CDCP1, CEBPB, CKS2, DKC1, DTYMK, E2F1, FGG, KIF15, KIF24, LBP, LRP8,
  MYCN, NUSAP1, ORC1, PCLAF, PFKP, RAD51, RDH10, RFC4, S100A7, S100A9, TTK, VDR, WASF3,
  and WDR76. Downregulated molecules include CYBB, DRAM1, DUSP1, FZD7, GJA1, JAK2,
  KITLG, LY86, NR3C1, PLAZG16, PLK2, POLR3GL, PPF1BP1, RARRES2, SSPN, TRIM22, and
  ZNF655. Asterisk marks molecule with more than one probe set. The pathway was overlaid
  with the Molecule Activity Predictor to precalculate further molecular effects,
  as outlined in the prediction legend
