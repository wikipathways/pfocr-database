caption: Model depicting the relay of osmotic and oxidative stress signals to the
  Hog1 MAPK in C. albicans. Oxidative stress signaling to Hog1 requires the Ssk1 response
  regulator (), the Ssk2 MAPKKK (this study), and the Pbs2 MAPKK (). However, which
  histidine kinase(s) regulates Ssk1 in response to oxidative stress is unclear (;
  ). Although the relay of osmotic stress signals to Hog1 also requires Ssk2 (this
  study) and Pbs2 (), Hog1 is activated in response to osmotic stress in ssk1 mutant
  cells (). This, together with the finding that the Sho1–Ste11 pathway does not transmit
  osmotic stress signals to the Pbs2 MAPKK (; this study) indicates the presence of
  a novel osmotic-stress signaling pathway in C. albicans. Such a pathway may function
  in parallel with the Ssk1 response regulator to relay osmotic stress signals to
  Hog1.
