caption: Calvarial bone development and suture closure. Suture mesenchymal cells weakly
  express Runx2, and its expression is upregulated in preosteoblasts and reaches the
  maximum level in immature osteoblasts. Runx2 induces Sp7 expression at the preosteoblast
  stage. Col1a1 expression is weak in suture mesenchymal cells, slightly upregulated
  in preosteoblasts, and markedly upregulated in immature osteoblasts, which also
  express Spp1 and Ibsp. Runx2 increases the proliferation of suture mesenchymal cells
  and induces their commitment into osteoblast lineage cells through the induction
  of Fgf (Fgfr2 and Fgfr3), hedgehog (Ihh, Gli1, and Ptch1), Wnt (Tcf7, Wnt10b, and
  Wnt1), and Pthlh (Pthr1) signaling pathway genes, and Dlx5. Fgf signaling plays
  a role in proliferation, whereas the other genes function in both proliferation
  and commitment. There is reciprocal regulation between Runx2, and these signaling
  pathways and Dlx5. In the processes of commitment into osteoblast lineage cells,
  Runx2 also induces Tnc and Ncam1, which likely play roles in the condensation of
  suture mesenchymal cells, and these condensed mesenchymal cells then become preosteoblasts.
  The preosteoblasts become immature osteoblasts in the sagittal (SAG) suture, but
  not in the posterior frontal (PF) suture, where they become chondrocytes due, at
  least in part, to the reduction of Wnt signaling.

  description: Calvarial bone development and suture closure. Suture mesenchymal cells
    weakly express Runx2, and its expression is upregulated in preosteoblasts and
    reaches the maximum level in immature osteoblasts. Runx2 induces Sp7 expression
    at the preosteoblast stage. Col1a1 expression is weak in suture mesenchymal cells,
    slightly upregulated in preosteoblasts, and markedly upregulated in immature osteoblasts,
