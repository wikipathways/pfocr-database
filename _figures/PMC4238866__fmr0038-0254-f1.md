caption: 'The Snf1 protein kinase as a central player in the main glucose repression
  pathway. The Snf1 protein kinase orchestrates glucose repression of alternative
  carbon source utilization, and genes involved in respiration and gluconeogenesis.
  The Snf1 heterotrimeric complex consists of the catalytic subunit Snf1, the stimulatory
  subunit, Snf4, and one of the three β-subunits: Gal83, Sip1, or Sip2. Snf1 is active
  in phosphorylated form and the phosphorylation is performed by the three upstream
  protein kinases Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1, while the phosphatase Glc7 in conjunction
  with its regulatory subunit Reg1 is responsible for its dephosphorylation. The actual
  glucose-sensing mechanism, in which Hxk2 appears to play an important role, possibly
  activates the Glc7-Reg1 protein phosphatase to trigger dephosphorylation of Snf1.
  In its active form, Snf1-Snf4 binds to each of the three β-subunits, acquiring differential
  specificity for localization and target phosphorylation. Upon glucose exhaustion,
  a major role is played by the Snf1–Gal83 complex, which enters the nucleus to trigger
  derepression. This is accomplished by activation of the transcription factors Adr1,
  Sip4, and Cat8 and inactivation of Mig1 by dislodging its interaction with Hxk2
  and promoting its cytosolic localization by phosphorylation. This leads to the expression
  of a wide range of carbon source-responsive element (CSRE) containing genes involved
  in the use of alternative carbon sources, gluconeogenesis, ethanol, and fatty acid
  metabolism. Metabolic reactions are depicted by dotted arrows; regulatory and signaling
  interactions by full arrows.'
