caption: Signaling pathway underlying the effects of H2S donor on CaMKII. Opening
  of mPTP induced by activated CaMKII results in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis
  of myocardium in heart failure. H2S donor could release H2S in myocardium. The S-sulfhydration
  of CaMKII at cysteine-6 by H2S could restore the CaMKII activity and mitochondria
  dysfunction, to decrease apoptosis and oxidative stress in heart failure.
