caption: 'TLR ligation by bacteria or bacterial products leads to activation of PKCε.
  Hypothetically PKCε becomes phosphorylated and binds 14-3-3β in a MyD88-dependent
  manner. Activation of PKCε can occur via PI3K or PC-PLC that provides the PKCε-required
  DAG. PC-PLC and PKCε transfer signal through a so far unidentified pathway potentially
  independent of TRAF-6, but dependent on de novo-protein synthesis. Simultaneously,
  p44/42 MAPK and JNK are activated via TRAF6 and provoke translocation of activator
  protein 1 (AP-1) to the nucleus. TRAF6 also activates NFκB by IκB degradation. The
  resulting AP-1−/NFκB-induced transcription and production of anti-apoptotic and
  pro-inflammatory proteins, and the inactivation of proapoptotic proteins, together
  contribute to suppression of caspase 3 activity. Arrows mark activation, while marks
  inactivation of target proteins. Black labels are well documented events while red
  labels are hypothetical. IKK: IκB kinase; IκBα: inhibitor of NFκB; MAL: MyD88 adaptor-like;
  MEK: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MKK: mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase; TAK1: transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1; TIRAP: toll-interleukin
  1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein; TLR: Toll-like receptor; TRAF-6:
  TNF receptor associated factor 6; TREM-1: triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
  cells 1.'
