caption: 'The putative effects of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzyme inhibitors
  (PHI) in innate immune response.Notes: Hypoxia, inflammation, and innate immunity
  have intertwined relationships. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilization by
  PHI may enhance the adhesion and migration of hypoxic myeloid cells (through beta
  2-integrin transcription), and is indispensable for myeloid-cell adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) generation, survival, aggregation, and invasion in inflamed tissues. Hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1 alpha (HIF1α) stabilization likewise stimulates bactericidal effectors
  of the innate immune response such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS) (producing nitric oxide [NO]), and promotes neutrophil survival
  via nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). The
  NF-κB pathway is directly amplified by HIF1α, as well as indirectly through the
  induction of toll-like receptors (TLR). PHIs may likewise induce inhibitor of nuclear
  factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKKβ), a promoter of proinflammatory NF-κB.
  In a reciprocal self-reinforcing process, NF-κB directly stimulates HIF1α transcription.Abbreviation:
  β2-integrin, beta 2-integrin.'
