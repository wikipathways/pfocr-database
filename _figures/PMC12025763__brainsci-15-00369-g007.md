caption: AA induces increased AKT phosphorylation. (1) Glutamate is released from
  presynaptic neuron into synaptic cleft. (2) Vitamin C treatment inhibits glutamate
  reuptake by EAAT3. (3) Glutamate accumulation increases activation of ionotropic
  NMDA and AMPA/KAINATE receptors in postsynaptic cell. Therefore, intracellular calcium
  levels are increased. Calcium interacts with calmodulin forming complex that activates
  enzyme NOS. (4) NOS activation induces increase in NO production. (5) NO diffuses
  rapidly and activates PI3K signaling pathway through unknown mechanism. (6) PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway is activated, promoting changes in intracellular signaling cascades
  that regulate cellular processes such as survival, proliferation, and metabolism.
