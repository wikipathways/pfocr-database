caption: Effects of dietary compounds on extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis.
  The extrinsic pathway is triggered by death receptors and involves activation of
  the initiator caspase-8, which directly activates caspase-3 causing apoptosis. The
  intrinsic pathway is activated by different apoptotic stimuli that lead to release
  of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activation of caspase-9. The endoplasmic reticulum
  is triggered by stress and stimulates mitochondria to release cytochrome c and cause
  DNA damage. Many dietary agents affect molecules at several steps to initiate removal
  of unwanted cells by inducing apoptosis. EGCG is known to affect both the intrinsic
  as well as the extrinsic pathways and induces apoptosis in many cancer types.
