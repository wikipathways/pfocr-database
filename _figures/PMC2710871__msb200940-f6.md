caption: TrmB is a global bifunctional regulator, which coordinates the expression
  of evolutionarily diverse metabolic enzyme genes. Pathway diagram represents the
  reconstructed TrmB-specified metabolic network for H. salinarum (see  and  for reconstruction
  method). Numbered, colored boxes represent mRNA expression level for each enzyme-encoding
  gene in the ΔtrmB mutant in the absence of glucose. Numbers correspond to gene names
  listed to the right. Gene names shown in bold black type represent those whose encoded
  enzymes have been biochemically characterized in archaea (see also  for details
  on enzyme functions). Gene names in bold red indicate those that are indicated by
  the literature to be unique to the archaeal domain (). Asterisks next to gene names
  denote a gene in the second or higher position in an operon directly controlled
  by TrmB. Red boxes represent those that are induced in the ΔtrmB knockout background
  in the absence of glucose; green, repressed; the intensity of the color corresponds
  to the extent of change (see legend). Boxes bounded by black lines are direct targets
  of TrmB (according to ChIP-chip data), and those bounded by blue lines represent
  targets for which a TrmB-binding motif was identified. Magenta dots indicate central
  metabolic intermediates. Dotted lines between glycerol and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  represent putative alternative pathways for entry of glycerol into the trunk portion
  of glycolysis (). Not all 113 TrmB targets are listed in the figure for the sake
  of clarity. Explanations for abbreviations of metabolic intermediates are listed
  in . Purple and orange shaded areas represent examples of pathways with mixed evolutionary
  ancestry (see Results).
