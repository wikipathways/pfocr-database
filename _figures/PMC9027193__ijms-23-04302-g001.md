caption: Cooperation of TGF-β-Smad signaling fibrosis, the glycolysis pathway, and
  KLF5 as regulators of fibrosis. The stress or injury in the heart upregulates KLF5
  and subsequently induces TGF-β. In TGF-β-Smad signaling, TGF-β activates the Smad
  complex, resulting in an increase in the production of ECM and causing fibrosis.
  Moreover, HIF-1α may regulate TGF-β in fibrosis development and control the glycolytic
  enzymes in the glycolysis pathway.
