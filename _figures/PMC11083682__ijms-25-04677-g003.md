  In the cytoplasm of the host cell, influenza viral NS1 interacts with MOV10 and
  induces the degradation of MOV10 through the lysosome-dependent pathway, therefore
  reducing the association between MOV10 and viral NP, facilitating the assembly of
  progeny virus. NS1 is also shown to trigger the degradation of MDM2, which is a
  negative regulator of p53 signaling, thereby suppressing the MDM2-mediated antiviral
  activity. NA of H5N1 IAV triggers de-glycosylation and degradation of LAMPs, inducing
  lysosomal rupture. NA also regulates the cleavage of ACE2 receptors, resulting in
  the degradation of ACE2 through the proteasome-dependent pathway. Viral M2 induces
  the degradation of the CFTR receptor, which plays an important role in virus-associated
  inflammation and mortality. Cellular protein Cyclin D3 interferes with viral M1-M2
  interaction, which is essential for viral assembly. M2 interacts with cyclin D3,
  altering the distribution of cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, followed
  by proteasomal degradation of this protein. In the nucleus, PA and PB2 subunits
  of influenza viral RNA polymerase complex associate with host RNA polymerase II
  (Pol II) and mediate the degradation of Pol II, resulting in the inhibition of host
  gene expression. The vRNP is shown to interact with CHD6, which represses viral
  replication. Each of the three subunits of the vRNP complex is capable of binding
  to CHD6, inducing the degradation of this protein. Viral NS1 interacts with SSU72
  and elF4B, respectively, in the nucleus, inducing the degradation of both proteins,
  thus suppressing their antiviral function. NS1 also mediates SUMOylation of the
  main component of ND-10 complex, PML, leading to the disruption of ND-10, thus abolishing
  its antiviral activity. Cellular GPS2 protein inhibits IAV RNA synthesis by reducing
  the assembly of viral polymerase. Viral NS2 interacts with GPS2 and mediates its
  nuclear export, inducing the degradation of GPS2, thus abolishing its antiviral
  function. Host histone deacetylases (HDACs) display a negative effect on IAV propagation
  under certain conditions. Viral PA and PA-X induces the protein degradation of HDAC6
  and HDAC4, respectively. The protein levels of HDAC1 and HDAC2, as well as the mRNA
  levels of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC11, also decrease upon influenza virus infection
  by yet-unidentified mechanisms. The cellular NOD-like receptor NLRX1 binds to viral
  PB1-F2, thus preventing IAV-induced apoptosis in alveolar macrophages (AMs). IAV
  infection hijacks E3 ligase FBXO6 to promote the proteasomal degradation of NLRX1,
  facilitating the apoptosis of AMs and impairing AM-mediated antiviral immunity.
  H5N1 IAV activates E3 ligase Itch by an unidentified mechanism, thus promoting the
  ubiquitination of junction protein occludin, leading to its degradation. By inducing
  the degradation of occludin as well as other junction proteins, the highly pathogenic
  IAV, such as H5N1, impairs the alveolar epithelial barrier to cause severe disease.
  IAV facilitates the degradation of cortactin during the late stages of infection
  to undermine the inhibitory effect of cortactin on the release of progeny virus.
  At the early stage of infection, IAV induces lysosomal degradation of SOD1, thereby
  contributing to increased ROS generation and viral infectivity in alveolar epithelial
  cells
