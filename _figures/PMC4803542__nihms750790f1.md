caption: The epigenetic and transcriptional regulator MeCP2 controls the expression
  of hundreds of different proteins, including BDNF. When BDNF binds to TrkB, its
  receptor, the resulting signaling pathways converge with pathways known to influence
  local protein synthesis. The RNA-binding protein FMRP is directly involved in suppressing
  the translation of mRNA, but other proteins implicated in ASDs, including hamartin
  and tuberin (the proteins encoded by TSC1 and TSC2), as well as PTEN are upstream
  signaling molecules that converge on this pathway. The synaptic organizing proteins
  from the Shank and neurexin/neuroligin families influence these pathways indirectly
  by affecting the localization and function of glutamate receptors. Similarly, the
  ubiquitin protein ligase Ube3a normally suppresses the internalization of AMPA receptors,
  thereby affecting neuronal signaling and plasticity.
