caption: C. burnetii. C. burnetii cells replicate in a bacterium-modified vacuole
  that shares many characteristics with lysosomes as well as with autophagosomes.
  Although C. burnetii cells passively traffic through the default endocytic pathway,
  as evidenced by the sequential recruitment of Rab5 and Rab7, their delivery to lysosomes
  is delayed as a result of interactions with the host autophagy pathway. Interactions
  with the autophagy pathway, such as the recruitment of LC3 and Rab24, as well as
  the formation of the spacious replicative vacuole require bacterial protein synthesis.
  EE, early endosome; LE, late endosome; Lys, lysosome, AP, autophagosome.
