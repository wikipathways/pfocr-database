caption: NF-κB activation in NK cells required the coordinated engagement of coactivation
  receptors, such as 2B4 and NKG2D or 2B4 and DNAM-1. This combination was required
  to provide complementary and independent signals leading to Vav1-dependent synergistic
  signalling involving PLC-γ2 and Erk. Further, signals from synergizing receptors
  converged on NF-κB p65 subunit through selective phosphorylation of p65 serine residues,
  particularly at serine 276 via Vav1-Erk and at serine 536 via PI3K-Akt pathway,
  which was crucial to optimal activation of NF-κB. The requisite PI3K-Akt signal
  was primarily mediated by the engagement of NKG2D or DNAM-1, which recognizes ligands
  induced by cellular stress. Vav1 controlled downstream p65 phosphorylation and NF-κB
  activation, suggesting that distinct signalling checkpoints at the level of Vav1
  and p65 regulate NF-κB activation. In support, Vav1-dependent synergistic signalling
  was required for the phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 by Akt pathway, which
  was evident in SAP-deficient XLP1 NK cells following coactivation, which exhibited
  impaired p65 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, NF-κB activation and downstream
  NF-κB-dependent functions.
