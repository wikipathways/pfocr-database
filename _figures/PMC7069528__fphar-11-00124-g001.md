caption: Effect of cannabidiol (CBD) in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer' disease
  (AD). CBD antagonizes the action of cannabinoid receptors (CB1, CB2) acting as a
  reverse agonist and negative allosteric modulator of both receptors. CBD also inhibits
  fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), resulting in increased levels of endocannabinoids
  (ECs). ECs activate the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that are partially
  mediated by the actions of the CBD of transient receptor potential cation channel
  subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) [1]. CBD binds the peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptors (PPARs), antagonizes the action of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NFkB), and reduces the expression of proinflammatory enzymes
  such as inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and proinflammatory
  cytokines [2]. Activation of PPARγ by modulating the expression of proinflammatory
  mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin
  1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), iNOS, and COX-2 [3]. The CBD downregulates the
  β- and γ-secretase genes leading to a reduction in amyloid-β (Aβ) production [4].
  CBD is able to reduce the oxidative stress (OS) through the attenuation of mitochondrial
  dysregulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation or by the decrease of
  the expression of several ROS generating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADPH) oxidase isoforms [5]. The stimulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1
  (TRPV1) by CBD can activate phosphoinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt)
  signaling, which in turn inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK-3β) by phosphorylation
  of Ser9, thus reducing tau phosphorylation [6]. CBD reduces the activity of p-GSK-3β,
  the active phosphorylated form of GSK3-β, and causes an increase in the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. The activation of this pathway can protect against OS and Aβ neurotoxicity
  in AD [7].
