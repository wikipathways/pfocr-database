caption: 'Direct and indirect mechanisms of epigenetic regulation modulating NLRP3
  inflammasome activation. A variety of epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation, acetylation/deacetylation
  dynamics and miRNAs) are directly involved in the transcriptional regulation of
  inflammasome components. They are also indirectly involved through the modulation
  of factors and processes that participate in the assembly and activation of the
  NLRP3 inflammasome. (A). DNA methylation: During differentiation of monocytes to
  macrophages, regulatory regions of the ASC, CASP1, and IL1B genes are demethylated,
  thus enabling them to be expressed. In fact, NLRP3 is hypomethylated in infections
  and idiopathic syndromes to allow its transcription and further activation. ASC
  hypermethylation could condition the survival of tumor cells, and also contributes
  to alleviate cardiac failure, when exercise prevents its demethylation. (B). Acetylation/deacetylation
  dynamics: changes in the acetylation dynamics of genes involved in the NF-κB pathway
  lead to alterations in NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and IL-1β transcription. During Leishmania
  amazonensis infection, impaired acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14 in MYD88 and RelA,
  blocks IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. Similarly, in acute gouty arthritis
  and cerebral ischemia, overexpression of BRD4 allows the expression of inflammasome
  components through activation of the NF-κB pathway. The recruitment of p-STAT3 and
  the acetylation of histones H3(K9) and H4 in the NLRP3 promoter region triggers
  its expression. Moreover, acetylation of the PYD domain of NLRP3 in macrophages
  is required for proper assembly with ASC. (C). miRNAs: downregulation of diverse
  miRNAs (miR-223, miR-7, miR-30e, miR-22, and miR-495) or hypermethylation of miR-145
  during the development of the diseases leads to increased expression of all inflammasome
  components and further NLRP3 inflammasome activation. (D). Indirect regulation:
  epigenetic mechanisms involved in the expression of transcription factors (N2, C/EBPβ,
  CtBPs and XBP1), modulators of ROS production (TXNIP, and UCP2), genes encoding
  microtubule stabilization proteins, such as MARK4, and autophagy (ATG5) could facilitate
  changes in the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components and stop the inflammasome
  activation.'
