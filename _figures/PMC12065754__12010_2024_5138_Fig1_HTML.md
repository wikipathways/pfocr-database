caption: Relationship between photosystem and central metabolic pathway in cyanobacteria
  connected by NAD(P)H and ATP. In linear electron transfer, electrons extracted from
  water in photosystem II (PSII) are transferred to photosystem I (PSI) via cytochrome
  (Cyt b6f) and used for NAD(P)H regeneration. ATP is also regenerated using protons
  (H+) pumped out during the electron transfer process. In cyclic electron transfer,
  electrons from ferredoxin (Fd) or NAD(P)H are transferred to plastoquinone (PQ),
  thereby regenerating ATP without regenerating NAD(P)H. Transhydrogenase (TH) easily
  converted electron transfer between NADH and NADPH. CO2 is fixed by RuBisCO in central
  metabolic pathway using NAD(P)H and ATP produced by the photosystem
