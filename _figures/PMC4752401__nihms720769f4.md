caption: The central panel shows a schematic representation of the oxygen-dependent
  metabolic modulation mechanism. Deoxyhemoglobin under anaerobic conditions would
  bind to the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3. This would in turn results in
  the release of glycolytic enzymes from cdB3, increased levels of glycolysis, and
  deactivation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP OFF).Select metabolomics data
  for the three arms are shown in the side panels. These results are consistent with
  the model suggesting the total anaerobiosis promotes faster glucose consumption
  and accumulation of glycolytic intermediates, DPG, and end products than routine
  storage under normoxia (control). On the other hand, anaerobic storage with 5% CO2
  supplementation (AN[CO2]) promotes ATP preservation at the expense of DPG. Solid
