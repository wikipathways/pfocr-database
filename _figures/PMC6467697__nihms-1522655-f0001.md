caption: Schematic of ceramide synthesis. Serine palmitoyltransferase is responsible
  for condensing palmitoyl-CoA and serine to generate 3-ketosphinganine, which undergoes
  further modification by a series of enzymes in the generation of de novo ceramide.
  Incorporation of alanine, which resembles serine but lacks a hydroxyl group, results
  in the formation of a 1-deoxy-3-ketosphinganine. Despite lacking the 1-hydroxyl
  at the end of the sphingoid chain, this species is presumably able to undergo modification
  by other enzymes in the de novo pathway of ceramide genesis to create 1-deoxydhCer
  and 1-deoxyCer.
