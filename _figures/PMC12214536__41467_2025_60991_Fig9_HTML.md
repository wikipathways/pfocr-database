caption: In calcium-repleted conditions (left panel), calcium channels and transporters
  allow calcium transport into the cytoplasm, activating calcium sensors, like calmodulin
  (CaM), that bind to the regulatory subunit of calcineurin (CnaB), releasing the
  phosphatase activity of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin (CnaA). CnaA dephosphorylates
  the transcription factor CrzA that is translocated to the nucleus, turning on (+)
  the expression of the vacuolar calcium transporter-encoding gene pmcA-C and the
  vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger-encoding gene vcxA to avoid the excessive vacuolar storage
  of calcium and genes for stress responses and cell wall modifications. The cell
  wall integrity pathway comprises PkcA (protein kinase C), the mitogen-activated
  kinases (MAPK), MAPKKK (Bck1), MAPKK (Mkk2), and MAPK (MpkA), which are functionally
  and sequentially phosphorylated, allowing the phosphorylation and activation of
  RlmA transcription factor in the nucleus (+ sign). Active RlmA enables the transcription
  of enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis and/or remodeling of the cell wall (not
  shown in the Figure). One of them is α-glucan synthase 1 (not shown), which was
  used as a proxy for the RlmA-regulated network in the luciferase reporter assays.
  Another possible candidate is fks1, which encodes the β-1,3-glucan synthase, the
  enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of β−1,3-glucan, the main polysaccharide
  in the A. fumigatus cell wall. and the molecular target of CAS. Mitochondria are
  intact and functional during these processes. Calcium-limited conditions (right
  panel) are induced promptly upon exposure of the cells to COL + CAS. Non-competitive
  inhibition of Fks1 imposed by CAS inhibition results in a decrease in the β−1,3-glucan
  content in the cell wall. The lack of this polysaccharide weakens the cell wall
  and increases the impact of osmotic pressure, disrupting the plasma membrane integrity
  pathway. Combination of COL + CAS inhibits PkcA signaling and impairment of RlmA
  output. The transcription factor SltA plays a dual role in maintaining calcium homeostasis
  under calcium-limited conditions. A. fumigatus SltA transcription factor is activated
  upon a proteolysis modification that depends on SltB, a chymotrypsin-like serine
  protease. It is currently unknown how SltB is regulated (question mark). SltA represses
  the expression and nuclear localization of CrzA, probably by affecting the activity
  of calcineurin, decreasing the expression and activity of calcium channels and transporters
  in the cell membrane (- sign). SltA regulates the expression of pmcA, pmcB, vcxA,
  and the Golgi calcium transporter-encoding gene pmrA by directly binding to the
  conserved AGGCA motif in their promoter regions. SltA can regulate the expression
  of pmcC and the mitochondrial calcium transporter-encoding gene mcuA in an indirect
  manner (not shown). The combination of COL + CAS impairs the function of CWI, plasma
  membrane integrity, and SltA, resulting in a cell death process through a combination
  of calcium starvation, increased leakage of cytoplasmic contents, and non-functional
  mitochondria due to enhanced fragmentation. The figure was created using the software
  Affinity Designer 2 (version 2.6.2)
