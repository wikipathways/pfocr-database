caption: LncRNA mediated molecular pathways in T Cells. In CTLs and Th cells, due
  to TCR signalling, there may be a Ca2+ influx, which can activate calmodulin. This
  promotes deacetylation of NILKA promoter, causing nuclear translocation of p300
  inhibiting NF-kB pathway and activating AICD. In CD8+ cells, Lnc-NEAT1 regulates
  miR-155p mediated Tim-3 activation. While binding of Lnc-Tim-3 to Tim-3 protein
  inhibit Lck/NFAT1/AP-1 pathway and permit the localisation of Bat-3 towards p300
  mediated activation of RelA and p53. In Th1 cells, EZH2 binds to LSD1, causing nuclear
  localization of EZH2, which inactivates transcription of MAF-4 gene by recruiting
  Linc-MAF-4 and H3K27 trimethylation of the promotor. In CD4+/CD8+ cells, Lnc-NeST
  and Lnc-HOTTIP binds to WDR5 protein of SET/MLL/WRD5 complex. The NeST can even
  recruit STAT to WDR5 through methylation. STAT4, thus gets localised to nucleus
  causing activation of IFN gamma pathways
