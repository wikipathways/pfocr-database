caption: Autophagy is modulated by environmental nutrient signals via a signaling
  pathway dependent on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the mammalian (mechanistic)
  target of rapamycin (mTOR). In the absence of amino acids or in response to other
  stimuli, mTOR negatively regulates UNC-51–like kinase 1 (ULK1) through direct phosphorylation
  and destabilization of ULK1 protein, thus acting as a negative regulator of autophagy.
  Under energy depletion, AMPK negatively regulates mTOR and also directly phosphorylates
  ULK1, thereby acting as a positive regulator of autophagy. Macroautophagy is regulated
  by a set of autophagy-related proteins (ATG proteins). During macroautophagy, cytoplasmic
  constituents are engulfed in an isolation membrane that is elongated mainly through
  the action of two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems into a double-membraned autophagosome.
  Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, resulting in complete
  degradation of the sequestered cytoplasmic components by lysosomal hydrolases. In
  the case of microautophagy, cytosolic proteins are directly internalized in single
  membrane vesicles into lysosome by invaginating, protrusion and/or septation. In
  CMA, specific cytosolic proteins are transported into lysosomes via a molecular
  chaperone/receptor complex composed of HSPA8/HSC70 and LAMP-2A (the CMA receptor
  lysosome-associated membrane protein type-2A).
