caption: Proposed Role of RGA and GAI in GA Homeostasis.In the ground (GA-deficient)
  state, RGA and GAI would repress GA signaling. After the synthesis of bioactive
  GAs, RGA and GAI would be inactivated (presumably by proteolysis), leading to the
  induction of GA response. The GA signaling pathway then would reduce bioactive GAs
  through the inhibition of GA biosynthesis and the induction of GA catabolism. An
  environmental or endogenous signal would keep the level of bioactive GAs above the
  homeostatic mean and allow for GA-stimulated growth and development. After the input
  signal stopped, the system would return to its basal level. Arrows and T-bars indicate
  positive and inhibitory effects, respectively.
