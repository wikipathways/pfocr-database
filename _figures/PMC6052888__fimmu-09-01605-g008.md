caption: 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cell signaling in T cells: low/moderate
  levels of ROS promote mTOR, Myc, and nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) activation
  which is associated with increased glycolysis and inflammatory response in T cells.
  ROS levels are regulated by the glutathione pathway (GSH) and NRF2–Keap1–Cul3 trimeric
  complex. Abrogation of GSH and the trimeric complex, which may cause high levels
  of ROS, impairs the inflammatory response of T cells. In addition, high ROS and
  high adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels inhibit mTOR.
  It is reported that naïve T cells, CD4+regulatory T cells, and chronically stimulated
  T cells depend on OXPHOS as their primary metabolism method while CD8+ effector
  and CD4+ Th1 cells mainly depend on glycolysis. This metabolic switching is controlled
  by ROS.'
