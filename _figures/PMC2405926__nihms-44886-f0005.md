caption: a, During development, basal epidermal cell density is low and cells proliferate.
  As cells increase in density the number of adherens junctions at cell–cell borders
  increases. This provides a regulatory feedback loop to control Ras–MAPK activity
  and cell proliferation. b, In a wound response, adherens junctions are severed at
  the wound site, stimulating the Ras–MAPK pathway and triggering a hyperproliferative
  response and cell migration. Adherens junction protein levels also affect NF-κB,
  which, when active, results in the recruitment of immune cells (blue) to protect
  against infection. After wound repair, regulatory feedback pathways cause these
  processes to be dampened and the system returns to normal. c, Cancer and chronic
  inflammatory disorders can lead to mutations and/or permanent changes in adherens
  junction proteins. This results in a break in the regulatory circuitry, and the
  proliferative and NF-κB responses become constitutively activated.
