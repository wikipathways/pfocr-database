caption: Figure 2. Plant defense responses associated with ETI. Reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production plays important roles in plant defense response during ETI (left).
  Plasma membrane-localized NADPH oxidases contribute to the production of ROS in
  plant apoplast, which triggers programmed cell death (PCD). In plants, these NADPH
  oxidase are called respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs). Catalase is an anti-oxidative
  enzyme that prevents accumulation of peroxisomal ROS. CAT2 (Catalase 2) and NCA1
  (no catalase activity 1), which are required for catalase activities in plants,
  should in theory prevent PCD. However, both CAT2 and NCA1 contribute to autophagy-dependent
  PCD. In addition to the primary pro-death function of autophagy, autophagy downregulates
  ROS signaling in older plants or under long day condition. Autophagy limits PCD
  by a negative feedback pathway. Integrated model depicts selected transcriptional
  regulators associated with diverse R proteins to control the expression of defense
  genes (right). Association of R protein RRS1-R (WRKY52) with its cognate effector
  causes activation of defense genes, perhaps through derepression of transcriptional
  activity of WRKY domain or activation of other regulators. Upon avr pathogen infection,
  diverse activated R proteins MLA10, Pb1, SNC1, RPS4, and N are able to activate
  HvMYB6, OsWRKY45, TPR1, AtSPL6, and NbSPL6, respectively through protein-protein
  interactions, thus resulting in induction of defense genes. After perception of
  specific effector, MLA10 associates with HvWRKY1/2 repressors and thereby de-repress
  immune response. In addition, activated MLA10 enables to release HvMYB6 from HvWRKY1
  repressor, which antagonistically associates with DNA binding domain of HvMYB6.
  The corepressor TRP1 represses transcription of two negative regulators of plant
  defense (DND1 and DND2), leading to induction of defense responses. Transcription
  of two tomato SIWRKY72 genes (SIWRKY72a and SIWRKY72b) are upregulated in defense
  response triggered by Mi-1 and these genes are required in Mi-1-mediated resistance.
  Both MED14 and MED16 are involved in induction of a large number of defense genes
  and resistance to RPT2. Blue lines indicate that diverse R proteins activate (arrows)
  or repress (truncated lines) activities of corresponding transcriptional regulators
  after perception of avr effectors. Dark red lines indicate that representative transcriptional
  (co)factors positively (arrows) or negatively (truncated lines) regulate transcription
  of downstream defense genes. Simple model for ELP2, SDG8 and MORC1 (CRT1)-mediated
  epigenetic control of transcriptome reprogramming in ETI is shown below. The histone
  acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of ELP2 for histone acetylation positively regulates
  defense genes including NPR1, PR1, PR2, PR5, EDS1, and PAD4. In addition, as a DNA
  demethylase, it reduces DNA methylation levels in NPR1 promoter and PAD4 coding
  regions after infection of Pst DC3000 avrRpt2, resulting in induction of NPR1 and
  PAD4. The histone lysine methytransferase SDG8, which trimethylated histone 3 lysine
  36 (H3K36), is required for induction of LAZ5 (RPS4-like) and RPM1 R genes. Loss
  of SDG8 increases monomethylated H3K36 levels that probably is a general mark for
  transcription represson of a subset of R genes including RPM1. MORC1 (CRT1) causes
  heterochromatin condensation and is required for RPM1-mediated defense signaling.
