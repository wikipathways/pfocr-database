caption: Genotype, phenotype, and dose effects on Bcl6 inhibition upstream of the
  secreted factors canonical pathway. Upstream inhibition of the secreted factors
  canonical pathway was characterized using IPA with the Fischer’s Exact method (FDR
  < 0.10) on fold changes of log2(average AgNP/vehicle control) (n = 54) for AJ:Normal
  (A), B6:Normal (B), AJ:T2-Skewed (C), and B6:T2-Skewed (D) exposed to nominal doses
  of 0, 12.5, or 50 µg AgNP/ml media for an acute 24 h exposure. Central icons represent
  the upstream inhibitor (Bcl6), peripheral icons represent cytokine/growth factors,
  and arrows represent predicted relationships. n = 3 biological replicates.
