caption: Innate immunity regulation in C. elegans. Three key signaling pathways regulate
  innate immunity in C. elegans. The p38 MAPK cascade functions in the intestine and
  epidermis to regulate antimicrobial gene expression, and includes TIR-1, a protein
  with a conserved TIR domain, the MAPKKK NSY-1, the MAPKK SEK-1 and the MAPK PMK-1
  (A). How this pathway senses pathogens is still unclear, but the specificity of
  the nematode innate immune response suggests that several pathogen recognition receptors
  (PRRs) exist in the genome. The TGFβ family member DBL-1 is synthesized in neurons
  and controls expression of antimicrobial genes in the epidermis (B). DBL-1 signals
  via the TGFβ receptor (composed of DAF-4 and SMA-6) and a downstream SMAD (SMA-3).
  Neuronal expression of the insulin-like peptide INS-7 also regulates antimicrobial
  gene expression non-autonomously, acting on the DAF-2 receptor and downstream signaling
  components, including DAF-16 in the intestine (C).
