caption: In the absence of ERK pathway signalling, Elk-1 is kept in a repressive state
  by SUMO-mediated HDAC-2 recruitment. Following ERK activation, Elk-1 is de-SUMOylated,
  leading to enhanced transactivation capacity, and SENP1 plays a pivotal role in
  this process. SRE, serum-response element.
