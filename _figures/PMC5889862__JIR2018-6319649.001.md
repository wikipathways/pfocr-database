caption: 'Targeting MDSCs in the treatment of lung cancer. Retinoic acid can stimulate
  the differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells to dendritic cells or macrophages,
  thereby inhibiting the differentiation of MDSCs. c-KIT can inhibit the signaling
  pathway which is mediated by SCF, inhibiting the amplification of MDSCs. The inhibition
  of COX2 expression in MDSCs can decrease the release of arginine-1, Nrf2 contributes
  to the clearance of ROS in MDSCs, and both COX2 and Nrf2 can inhibit the function
  of MDSCs. The above measures will inhibit MDSCs'' immunosuppressive function on
  effector T cells and enhance the antitumor immunity. SCF: stem cell factor; VEGF:
  vascular endothelial growth factor; COX2: cyclooxygenase 2; Arg-1: arginine-1; Nrf2:
  nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2; ROS: reactive oxygen species; CTL:
  cytotoxic lymphocyte.'
