caption: (A) Average of five light-evoked AMPA-mediated EPSCs recorded at +40mV and
  −60mV before and after bath NMDAR activation.(B and C) I-V curves of the ON peak
  (B) and the OFF peak (C) of the light response before (open circles) and after (filled
  circles). Increased rectification was observed only in the ON responses. (B and
  C, n = 9; B, p = 0.002, paired t test; C, p = 0.20, paired t test). In contrast,
  the OFF peak I-V curve in the same cells did not change (C).(D and E) Summary data
  of the RI, calculated from (B) and (C) for both the ON (D) and OFF (E) responses
  in ON-OFF RGCs before and after NMDA stimulation. (D, p = 0.0005, paired t test;
  E, p = 0.54). Error bars represent SEM.
