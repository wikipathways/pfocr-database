caption: Wnt/ß-catenin driven mevalonate metabolism promotes EMT. Mevalonate metabolism
  is fueled by glycolysis. Glucose-derived pyruvate enters the TCA cycle. Since some
  citrate is exported into the cytosol for lipogenesis (i.e., mevalonate metabolism
  and fatty acid synthesis), glutaminolysis generates α-ketoglutarate to replenish
  TCA cycle intermediates. Canonical Wnt signaling, which can be activated for instance
  in response to cilia loss, promotes the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus,
  where it acts as coactivator of TCF factors in the transcription of target genes.
  In addition, ß-catenin may stimulate mevalonate metabolism by forming a complex
  with SREBP2 on the promoters of mevalonate pathway genes, including HMGCR (HMG-CoA
  reductase, the target of statins). In addition, β-catenin/TCF4 binds directly to
  the promoter of ZEB1, a key inducer of EMT, and activates its transcription. N-BPs,
  nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates.
