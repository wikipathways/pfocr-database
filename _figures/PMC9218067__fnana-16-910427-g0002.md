caption: Theroles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neurodegenerative diseases.The
  presence of hallmark protein(s) for each neurodegenerativedisease is a common trait,
  such as Tau and Aβ in AD,α-synuclein in PD, TDP-43, and SOD1 in ALS, and mHTT in
  HD.(A) In AD, ROS production serves both as a stimulus and aconsequence of activated
  Nrf2 via PI3K/AKT/GSK3β,p62, p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathways, which is demonstrated toclosely
  correlates with AD pathogenesis. Besides, ROS induced ADdevelopment through the
  inhibition of PP2A/CIP2A and the activation of JNK/P53 pathways. Some corresponding
  drugs are utilized to reverse this and exhibit some initial effects. (B) In PD,
  ROS also acts as both stimuli and a consequence of activated Nrf2 via PI3K/AKT/GSK3β,
  DJ-1, and p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathways. Additionally, ROS can activate c/EBPβ/AEP pathway,
  which leads to dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor disorders. Some drugs are found
  to reverse the pathology through the above-mentioned pathways. (C) In ALS, the inhibition
  of GSK3β is reported to activate Nrf2 via PI3K/AKT pathway. SOD1 is an important
  gene that is relevant to ROS in ALS that inhibits ROS production. ROS activates
  IκK/p-IκB/NF-κB pathway to inactivate Nrf2. The activation of SOD1 also regulates
  IGF1R/mTOR pathway to inhibit autophagy which can eliminate misfolded proteins.
  Rilmenidine is found to reduce autophagy to alleviate ALS development. (D) In HD,
  mHTT blocks autophagy, and mHTT and the over production of ROS leads to DNA damage
  to produce ROS through mitochondrial dysfunction, which results in ALS. Metabolic
  reprogramming can also induce ROS production which leads to ALS. Finally, pridopidine
  can be found to inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction to reverse this pathology (Created
