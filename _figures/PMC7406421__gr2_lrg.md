caption: 'The Mechanism of human CoVID-19 infection: 1: infected animals can infect
  Humans followed by human-to-human transmission through aerial droplets and contact.
  2: life cycle begins with S protein binds to the cellular receptor ACE2. After receptor
  binding, S protein facilitates viral envelope fusion with the cell membrane through
  the endosomal pathway. Then CoVID-19 releases RNA into the host cell. Viral genomic
  RNA is translated into viral replicase polyproteins, which are then cleaved into
  small viral proteases. The RNA polymerase generates a series of sub genomic mRNAs
  and finally translated into all viral proteins. Viral genome RNA and proteins are
  subsequently assembled into virions in the endoplasmic reticulum, then to Golgi
  and transported via vesicles and released out of the cell. 3: CoVID-19 infection
  results in activation of epithelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Antigens
  will be presented to the antigen presentation cells (APC), which triggers body''s
  anti-viral immunity and uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from
  the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β,
  IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-α, TGFβ, etc.) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5,
  CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, etc.) by immune effector cells. 4: The cytokine storm will
  trigger a violent attack of immune system to the body, results in leaky blood vessels,
  cellular oedema and collapsed alveolar function. 5: Increased amount of IL6 and
  IL-1β results in activation of prostaglandins which results in increased body temperature.
  5: System inflammation leads to decreased blood volume and increased hat ? function.
  Finally, it results in multiple organ failure, and may lead to death in severe cases.'
