caption: Hypothetical model for the trypsin-induced growth-dependent activation of
  the RumA locus in R. gnavus E1. At the early stages of growth, low-level constitutive
  transcription from the p2 and p3 promoters gives rise to the basal expression of
  the operons encoding the two-component regulatory system, the unmodified RumA-precursor
  and the biosynthetic proteins. We suggest that, at the same time, a putative inducer
  peptide (IP) is synthesized and exported by the cell as an inactive precursor, pre-IP.
  Proteolytic processing of pre-IP by trypsin can lead to the accumulation of the
  active form (IP) in the culture medium during growth. When a certain threshold concentration
  of the IP is reached, the signal transduction pathway is triggered. The interaction
  of the IP with the external domain of the histidine kinase RumK finally induces
  the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic regulator protein RumR, which in turn stimulates
  the transcription of the immunity operon and also amplifies the expression of the
  regulatory and biosynthetic operons. In the absence of trypsin, the pre-IP is not
  processed and, consequently, the signal triggering the growth-dependent regulatory
  mechanism is not effective. Hence, the transcription pattern of the RumA locus remains
  unchanged during growth. In the figure, wavy lines represent the positions and sizes
  of the transcripts. Their thickness reflects the relative amounts, as judged from
  Northern blotting (Fig. ). White boxes represent the immunity (I), regulatory (R),
  and biosynthetic (B) operons. Promoter activation is indicated by “+”. Dashed arrows
  represent the amplification of transcription from p2 and p3.
