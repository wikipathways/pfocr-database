caption: Examination of UvrC in its holo form is likely to uncover many crucial details
  regarding the activity of UvrC in vivo. Connections between FeS biogenesis machinery
  and the NER pathway (dashed, black square and dashed, purple square), cellular functions
  of apo (orange oval), holo (orange oval and cofactor) and aggregated UvrC (gray
  ovals), the role of O2 sensitivity (solid gray arrow), and DNA-mediated redox signaling
  with other repair pathways (solid blue, double headed arrow) remain to be explored.
