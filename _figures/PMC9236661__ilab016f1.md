caption: The pain pathway. A pain pathway graphic summary, including its major components.
  A nociceptive stimulus (injuries or surgeries) activates nociceptors (transduction).
  Stimulus information (ie, pain) travels through the nerve fibers such as A-δ and
  C fibers (transmission) to the spinal cord (modulation). Sufficient pain signals
  up-regulation, causing stimulus information to travel up the nervous system to the
  brain where pain perception occurs in conscious animals (perception). Commonly used
  analgesics are identified at their pain pathway action sites. *, Indicates the analgesic
  has both a standard and long-acting formulation available. §, Indicates the drug
  suppresses the perception of pain (due to a surgical anesthesia plane) but does
  not provide analgesia. Figure created by Janis Atuk-Jones.
