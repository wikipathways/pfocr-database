caption: HIV-1 Vpr induces HIF-1α that in turn induces HK and PKM2. Upregulation of
  HK expression on one hand results in conversion of glucose into glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P) and forward feed into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) for conversion into pyruvate
  by PKM2 which then enters into mitochondria for conversion into Acetyl-CoA via the
  TCA cycle. On the other hand, HK can translocate to the outer mitochondrial membrane
  to confer an anti-apoptotic phenotype. Glucose, in addition can be metabolized by
  upregulation of Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) via the pentose-phosphate
  pathway (PPP). In this pathway glucose-6-phosphate is decarboxylated to form ribose-5-phosphate
  (R5P) in a series of reaction involving 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD)
  for the synthesis of nucleotides. The pentose phosphate pathway also reduces NADP+
  to NADPH (H+), a cofactor necessary for antioxidant glutathione (GSH) regeneration
  from its disulfide form (GSSG) for attenuation of oxidative stress. Nuclear translocation
  of PKM2 can lead to Stat3 phosphorylation and activation of HIV-1 LTR.
