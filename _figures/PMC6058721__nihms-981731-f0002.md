caption: The 5 lipoxygenase enzymatic pathway. Following cellular activation, 5-LO
  migrates from the cytosol to the nuclear membrane where it is able to interact with
  the 5LO activating protein (FLAP) and by oxidizing arachidonic acid on carbon 5
  generates first 5hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), which can then be converted
  to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), or leukotriene A4 (LTA4). LTA4 can be
  metabolized in leukotriene B4 (LTB4) by the action of a hydrolase, or into leukotriene
  C4 (LTC4) by the action of a synthase. LTC4 in turn can be transformed into leukotriene
  D4 (LTD4) by the     -glutamyl transferase-1 and then into leukotriene E4 (LTE4)
  by the LTD4 dipeptidase enzyme.LTB4 action is mediated by bonding to the leukotriene
  B receptors(BLT1,and LTB2),where as the LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 action is mediated by
  their binding to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptors (CysLT). In both cases, the
  binding will elicit a GPCR-dependent intracellular signaling biological event resulting
  in immune activation and inflammatory responses.
