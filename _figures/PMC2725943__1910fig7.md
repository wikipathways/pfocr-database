caption: A model of mammalian Hh signaling. Sufu plays a pivotal role in controlling
  Gli protein levels. Sufu protects full-length Gli2 and Gli3 proteins from Spop-mediated
  ubiquitination and complete degradation by the proteasome. In this way, Sufu functions
  as an adaptor to preserve a pool of Gli2 and Gli3 that can be readily converted
  into Gli activators and repressors. This aspect of Hh signaling is evolutionarily
  conserved and independent of the primary cilium. In contrast, the primary cilium
  is required for generating Gli repressors via limited proteolysis in the absence
  of Hh signaling and converting full-length Gli proteins into activators through
  unknown mechanisms upon Hh pathway activation. These events occurs downstream from
  Smo, which translocates to the primary cilium when Hh ligand binds to Ptch1 and
  removes it from the cilium. How other Hh pathway components or ciliary proteins
  particulate in cilium-dependent and cilium-independent activity needs to be investigated
  further.
