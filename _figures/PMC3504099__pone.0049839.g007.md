caption: The non photochemical reduction of the PQ pool under dark anaerobic condition
  activates STN7 kinase which triggers state II transition (LHCII is migrated from
  PSII to PSI). During dark condition the acceleration of NDH mediated CET and PGR5
  mediated CET was reported to be absent . In the present study, since anaerobic condition
  was given in dark, the acceleration of CET contributing to the non photochemical
  reduction could be eliminated. Thus, study with crr2-2 mutant have shown that NDH
  mediates the electron transfer from stromal reductants to PQ pool. The accumulation
  of stromal reductants responsible for dark reduction of the PQ pool could be due
  to the increased starch breakdown, glycolysis and other metabolic pathways. Anaerobic
  condition was reported to inhibit mitochondrial respiration thereby blocking the
  shuttling of redox equivalents between chloroplast and mitochondria. The inverted
  T corresponds to inhibition of the pathway.
