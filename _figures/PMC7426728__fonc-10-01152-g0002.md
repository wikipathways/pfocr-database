caption: DNA methylation regulates the PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the
  resistance to therapy in cancer. (Left) PI3K induces the phosphorylation and activation
  of AKT/mTOR. This transduction signal begins with the activation of the membrane
  tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) or G-protein-coupled receptors, which promotes
  the change of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) in phosphatidylinositol
  (3-5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). The activation of PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase) is
  regulated by the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) by dephosphorylating PIP3
  into PIP2. (Right) We show the aberrant methylation of the PTEN, Spalt-like transcription
  factor 2 (SALL2), transforming growth factor beta-induced protein (TGFB1), and Lysine
  (K)-specific demethylase 5A (KDM5A) genes through the high expression of methyltransferase
  (DNMT3B), s-adenosylmethionine (SAM), H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and H3K4me3, promoting
  a continued activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway associated with resistance
  therapy in solid tumors. , phosphorylation; ↑, increase; ↓, decrease; , methylation,
