caption: Algorithmic approach to left main treatment. After establishing the significance
  of an LM lesion, the first step is to decide between percutaneous and surgical revascularisation
  strategies. If a percutaneous intervention is preferred, the key factor in deciding
  between the provisional strategy and the potential upfront two-stent technique relies
  on the assessment of the risk of SB loss following main vessel stenting. If the
  risk is high, DK crush or an inverted provisional strategy, treating the SB first
  before proceeding with the 2 nd stent, is warranted. In cases with no disease at
  the SB ostium and/or if the risk of compromising the SB is low, a provisional strategy
  with crossover main vessel stenting is preferred. If necessary, the provisional
  single-stent strategy is extended to 2 nd stent implantation following the steps
  of the T-/TAP or culotte technique.
