caption: 'CsrA plays a major role in the regulation of the bipartite metabolism of
  L. pneumophila. Module 1 comprises the ED pathway, gluconeogenesis and the pentose
  phosphate pathway. Module 2 includes the TCA cycle. 13C enrichment values for E
  and PE phase from the three labelling experiments (blue: glucose; red: glycerol;
  green: serine) are shown for Man, His, Ala, Glu and DAP. Coloured arrows represent
  main carbon fluxes from the three different nutrients in L. pneumophila wt (left)
  compared with its csrA-strain (right). Thickness of arrows indicates relative carbon
  flow intensities from the three different substrates, respectively, into metabolic
  marker metabolites His (PRPP/PPP), Ala (pyruvate/TCA) and Glu (α-KG/TCA). Thereby,
  the thickness of an arrow is not comparable between the different substrates, but
  illustrates the main carbon fluxes and differences between the two strains (wild-type
  compared with csrA-strain). Serine is mainly used in the energy generating part
  of metabolism (module 2) in the wt and csrA mutant, though serine metabolism is
  reduced in the csrA mutant. Also the carbon flux from serine into the upper part
  of metabolism is lower in the csrA-strain. Metabolic flow of glucose is mainly restricted
  to module 1, though carbon flux also occurs into the energy generating part of metabolism
  in the wt. In the csrA mutant carbon flux from glucose into the PPP was not affected,
  while glucose metabolism in the TCA cycle was reduced. The csrA mutation drastically
  changed glycerol metabolism in L. pneumophila. In the wt, glycerol metabolism is
  very low and almost exclusively restricted to the upper part of metabolism (module
  1). In the L. pneumophila csrA-strain, glycerol metabolism is dramatically upregulated.
  Carbon flow also occurs predominantly into module 1, but carbon flow from glycerol
  into the TCA cycle has also been detectable. Framed and highlighted in yellow plus
  or minus signs are representing enzymes, which are upregulated [+] or downregulated
  [−] dependent on CsrA levels. In the L. pneumophila wt strain enzymes of the second
  part of the glycolysis are induced by CsrA (lpp0151: pyruvate kinase, lpp0152: phosphoglycerate
