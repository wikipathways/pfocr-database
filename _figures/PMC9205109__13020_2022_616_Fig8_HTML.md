caption: The underlying molecular mechanisms of the protective effects of geniposide
  against the myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury of mice. Scheme summarizing the
  protective effects of GEN on MI/RI via activating of AMPK signaling and inhibiting
  of ROS/TXNIP/NLRP3 mediating inflammation and subsequent pyroptosis-related signaling
  pathways. Under physiological conditions, Trx binds to TXNIP in its reduced form
  and suppresses activity. However, MI/RI amplifies ROS overproduction, which results
  in Trx dissociating from TXNIP, and thereby TXNIP/NLRP3 activation. This process
  leads to inflammation and pyroptosis. Importantly, GEN upregulates the AMPK signaling
  pathway, contributing to inhibit MI/RI-induced oxidative stress and TXNIP/NLRP3
  activation, which were effectively inhibition inflammation and subsequent pyroptosis
