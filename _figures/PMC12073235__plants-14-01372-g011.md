caption: General biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids from p-coumaroyl-CoA. Flavanone
  is in bold, to emphasize its precursor role to other flavonoids. Arrow represents
  one biochemical reaction. CHS, chalcone synthase. CHI, chalcone isomerase. IFS,
  isoflavone synthase. FNS, flavone synthase I and II. F3H, flavanone 3-dioxygenase.
  FLS, flavonol synthase. DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase. LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase. UFGT, UDP-glucose–flavonol O-glucosyltransferase. Chalcone synthase
  (E.C.2.3.1.74) produces a chalcone from a phenylpropanoid thioester (e.g., p-coumaroyl-CoA)
  by addition and subsequent cyclization of 3 molecules of malonyl-CoA. Chalcone isomerase
  (E.C.5.5.1.6) produces a flavanone from a chalcone through an intramolecular cyclization
  of an oxygen of the malonyl portion of the chalcone with the double bond originating
  from coumaric acid (see Figure 10). Isoflavone synthase (E.C. 1.14.14.87) produces
  an isoflavone from a flavanone by migration of their aryl group, from C-2 to C-3,
  combined with an oxidation of C-2, resulting in the double bond formation between
  C-2 and C-3. Flavone synthase I and II (E.C. 1.14.20.5) (E.C. 1.14.19.76) produce
  flavones from flavanone by oxidizing C-2 and C-3, forming a double bond. Flavanone
  3-dioxygenase (E.C. 1.14.11.9) produces a dihydroflavonol from a flavanone by oxidizing
  C-3 using oxoglutarate, resulting in a hydroxyl group. Flavonol synthase (E.C. 1.14.20.6)
  produces a flavonol from a dihydroflavonol by oxoglutarate-dependent oxidation of
  C-2 and C-3, resulting in a double bond. Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (E.C. 1.1.1.219)
  produces a leucoanthocyanidin from a dihydroflavonol by reducing the ketone group
  to a hydroxyl. Leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (E.C. 1.14.20.4) produces anthocyanidin
  from leucoanthocyanidin by oxidation of the C ring, resulting in loss of hydroxyl
  groups and positive charge acquisition in the heterocycle. UDP-glucose–flavonol
  O-glucosyltransferase (E.C. 2.4.1.91) produces anthocyanin by addition of sugar
  moieties to anthocyanidins
