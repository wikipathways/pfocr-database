caption: GLP-1 acts by means of the GLP-1-R to stimulate adenylyl cyclase (AC), and
  thereby cAMP production, and to activate the cAMP-binding proteins PKA and Epac.
  PKA promotes translocation of PDX-1 to the nucleus, where it binds to regulatory
  elements within the enhancer or promoter sequences of genes important to β-cell
  growth and differentiation (, ). PKA also acts by means of CREB to up-regulate expression
  of IRS-2. Actions of Epac include a stimulation of intracellular Ca2+signaling (),
  secretory granule exocytosis (), and the promotion of β-cell survival (). Binding
  of GLP-1 to the GLP-1-R transactivates the EGFR in a manner mediated by c-Src and
  the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase)–family metalloproteinase. Liberation
  of the soluble EGFR ligand betacellulin (BTC) stimulates EGFR autophosphorylation
  and promotes formation of an EGFR-Grb2-Gab1-PI3K complex with resultant activation
  of PKB. The IR and IGF-1-R signaling pathways acting by means of IRS-2 and PI3K
  converge with the GLP-1-R signaling pathway at PKB. Activated PKB translocates to
  the nucleus, where it acts at Foxo1 to disinhibit Foxa2-dependent PDX-1 gene promoter
  activity. Phosphorylated Foxo1 (Foxo1-P) associates with 14-3-3 proteins and is
  exported out of the nucleus to accumulate in the cytosol.
