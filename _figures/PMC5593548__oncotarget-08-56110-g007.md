caption: In normoxic conditions, HIF-1/2α are first modified by prolyl hydroxylase
  (PHD) for protein hydroxylation, and removed via the VHL associated proteasomal
  degradation pathway. In hypoxic conditions, HIF-α recruits Hsp70 and Hsp90 in the
  cytoplasm, and interacts with the karyopherin importin for nuclear translocation.
  Nucleated HIF-α further recruits other cofactors such as HIF-b and p300/CBP, and
  initiates gene transcription and hypoxia signaling. HDACis act to increase accumulation
  of the acetylated form of Hsp90. The reduction of Hsp90 chaperone activity and HIF-a
  recognition results in HIF-α nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation.
