caption: Hypothetical schemes for the role IGF-1 plays in the induction and resolution
  of epileptic spasms. In saline-infused control rats, IGF-1 signaling through the
  IGF-1R signaling pathways plays a role in interneuron growth. TTX-induced neocortical
  injury diminishes IGF-1 expression and reduces signaling through its growth pathway,
  resulting in interneuron dysmaturation (impaired maturation) that likely contributes
  to the induction of epileptic spasms. Treatment with (1–3)IGF-1 restores IGF-1 levels
  in the cortex, which activates its growth signaling pathway, rescues interneuron
  growth, and abolishes epileptic spasms. Created with BioRender.com
