caption: 'Graphical illustration of the PCSK9 pleiotropic effects on platelet activation-induced
  MI. (1) In hepatocytes, increased levels of PCSK9 lead to increased levels of LDL
  and oxLDL. (2) In platelets, supported by the binding of platelet with its agonists
  (ADP, collagen, and thrombin), an increased level of PCSK9 leads to an increased
  level of P-selectin and GPIIb/IIIa, which is important for platelet adhesion and
  activation; PCSK9 binds to CD36, which activates cPLA2 and thus activates the platelet
  coagulation signaling pathways via the p38MAPK pathway that promotes thrombus formation;
  PCSK9 and CD36 binding also activates Src-, MAPK-, and NOX2-mediated ROS generation
  that induces inflammation. In addition, increased levels of PCSK9 lead to increased
  levels of LOX-1 and CD36, which results in more uptake of oxLDL; thus, inducing
  the formation of foam cells. (3) In the endothelial cells, oxLDL binds to the LOX-1,
  which induces inflammation through the ROS and NFκB pathways and promotes plaque
  formation. Synergically, all of these processes activate the platelets that enhance
  and sustain the response for atherosclerosis development, from initiation, progression,
  to aggravation, which may lead to ischemic events, and finally MI occurrence. LDL:
  low-density lipoprotein; LDL-R: low-density lipoprotein receptor; oxLDL: oxidized
  LDL; LOX-1: lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1; CD36: cluster
  of differentiation 36; ADP: adenosine diphosphate; p38MAPK: p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; cPLA2 = cytosolic phospholipase A2; AA: arachidonic acid; TXA2:
  thromboxane A2; NOX2: NADPH oxidase type 2; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
