caption: —Fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in Drosophila. This stepwise process takes
  place in many different cell types and is catalyzed by several classes of cell-type-specific
  enzymes that generate the diversity of fatty acids found in the organism. Some of
  these fatty acids are reduced to alcohols by specific reductases. In oenocytes,
  an additional step consists of the conversion of some of the very long chained (VLC)
  alcohols to hydrocarbons by a single cytochrome P450, CYP4G1, which exists in all
  insect genomes sequenced to date.
