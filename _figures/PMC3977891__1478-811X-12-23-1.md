caption: 'Hallmarks of AD, progression of the disease and mitochondrial dysfunction.
  A: The diagram shows the hallmarks in AD. B: The multiple pathogenic mechanisms
  contributing to the pathological hallmarks of AD consist of increased of ROS production,
  Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis due to impairment of mitochondrial
  Ca2+ handling ability, altered Ca2+ homeostasis, increased mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore opening, and promotion of cytochrome c release. Aβ inhibits protein
  import inside the mitochondria. APP also alters Ca2+ homeostasis leading to apoptosis.
  Mitochondrial DNA mutations and mitochondrial DNA damage are also involved in the
  pathogenesis of AD, and are associated with synaptic and neuronal loss, amyloid
  plaques, and NFTs. Perturbed cerebral energy metabolism plays a central role in
  multiple pathogenic cascades of AD. Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer’s disease; Ca2+,
  calcium; Mptp, mitochondrial permeability transition pore; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species.'
