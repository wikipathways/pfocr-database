caption: 'Top: The BH3-only Bcl-2 proteins Bim and Bmf mediate anoikis by activating
  the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In attached cells, intact integrin-mediated
  adhesions and active EGFR signaling repress these apoptotic pathway activators by
  multiple mechanisms. First, ERK1/2 signaling downstream of EGFR inhibits anoikis
  by downregulating the transcription of Bim and Bmf. Second, ERK phosphorylation
  promotes the proteasomal degradation of Bim, as well as promotes the sequestration
  of phosphorylated-Bim at microtubules. Remarkably, Bim binding to microtubules and
  the localization of Bmf to actin both function in the upstream regulation of autophagy
  via inhibiting the critical autophagy regulator, Beclin-1 (ATG6), hence suppressing
  autophagosome formation. Bottom: The loss of integrin-mediated adhesion attenuates
  EGFR signaling and destabilizes cytoskeletal-focal adhesion associations. As a result,
  the mRNA expression of Bim and Bmf is increased and the associations of Bim and
  Bmf with the cytoskeleton are lost. The subsequent recruitment of Bim and Bmf to
  mitochondria triggers the intrinsic apoptotic cascade, including BAX/BAK mediated
  cytochrome c release and caspase activation, leading to anoikis. At the same time,
  upon disassociation from Bim and Bmf, free Beclin1 promotes autophagy following
  ECM detachment. These opposing effects of Bim and Bmf on both autophagy and apoptosis
  likely dictate cell fate in ECM detached cells.'
