caption: Illustration of the complexity of the balance between A2A–D2R heteroreceptor
  and homoreceptor complexes in key brain regions for schizophrenia such as the nucleus
  accumbens. In the lower left panel, several possible receptor stoichiometries from
  heterodimers to higher order heteromers of various types are shown. In the co-activated
  state, the antipsychotic-like effects of A2A agonists are mainly due to their ability
  to counteract Gi/o mediated D2 signalling over the Gα−AC–PKA and the Gβγ–PLC pathways.
  Also, A2A activation blocks the formation of βγ dimer from Gi/o and thus counteracts
  the D2 mediated inhibition of the Cav3.1 channels over the PLC and PP2B pathway.
  It is less clear how the allosteric A2A–D2 interactions modulate the D2 Akt signalling.
  D2 agonist induces a negative modulation of Akt via the β-arrestin 2 signalling
  pathway but induces positive modulations of Akt via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)–phosphoinositide
  3 kinase (PI3k) pathways. Furthermore, agonist activation of the A2A protomer in
  the A2A–D2 heteroreceptor complexes enhanced D2 β-arrestin 2 mediated signalling.
  The adapter proteins (sigma-1 receptor) also participate in modulating the organization
  and function of the A2A and D2 homoreceptors and their higher order heteroreceptor
  complexes.AC, adenylyl cyclase; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein
  kinase A; PLC, phospholipase C; PP2, protein phosphatase 2.
