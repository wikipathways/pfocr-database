caption: Experiment protocol blueprints. This schematic diagram shows the mechanism
  of over-consumption of alcohol, and high sugar and fat diets (ACHSFDs) leading to
  metabolic hypertension (MH). BUDE regulated intestinal flora and improved the intestinal
  barrier, so as to reduce LPS production and infiltration into the blood circulation,
  inhibited the activation of the enteric-origin LPS/TLR4 pathway, and improved vascular
  endothelial function, thereby improving MH.
