caption: 'Mucins regulate metabolism through the activation of multiple signaling
  pathways. MUC1 physically interacts with HIF-1α and p300 and controls several metabolite
  intermediates in pancreatic cancer cells. BRCA1 prevents glycolysis by downregulating
  glycolytic enzymes in cancer. MUC1 promotes glycolysis by inhibiting the expression
  of BRCA1 in pancreatic cancer. MUC1 regulates PI3K/AKT/mTOR, p53, TIGAR, and HIF-1α,
  which regulate the transcription of glycolytic genes. MUC1 interacts with RTKs and
  increases the stability of the RTK membrane. As a result, the MUC1/RTK complex promotes
  glycolytic genes. MUC13 activates the phosphorylation of IκB and activation/nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB/p65. This, in turn, leads to increased expression of genes
  linked with glucose metabolism. MUC16 regulates glycolysis by activating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR/c-Myc
  pathway in pancreatic cancer. Metabolic pathways upregulated by mucins are written
  in red color. Abbreviations of metabolic genes regulated by mucins: Acetyl-Coenzyme
  A (Acetyl-CoA); Enolase 1 (ENO1); Glucose -1- Phosphate (G-1-P); Glucose Transporter1
