caption: The numbers inside the boxes correspond to the number (N) of samples. Samples
  from PD patients were randomly chosen to be part of the training or test sets of
  samples. (A) Identifying the PD risk markers using a training set. In order to identify
  putative biomarkers, the training set (training set 1) was used in the microarray
  screen. The data from the microarray analysis was analyzed by three methods in order
  to identify markers with good specificity, sensitivity and predictive accuracy.
  PD patients were compared to each control group separately, compared to pooled controls
  as a single group and using LOOCV. Splice variants that were up- or down-regulated
  by 2-fold (P<0.05) in PD patients were considered candidate risk markers. The candidate
  risk markers were manually curated to include those that may play a role in PD based
  on pathway and disease analysis (Ingenuity Systems software) and to exclude those
  for which primers could not be designed or could not be detected by qPCR. Thirteen
  of the risk markers were replicated by qPCR (Training set 1). (B) Experimentally
  testing the PD risk markers with training and test sets. The 13 risk markers were
  validated in two independent test sets (training set 2 and test set) using qPCR.
  Clinical diagnosis of the participants was based on neurological exam. (C) Statistical
  analysis. LOOCV KNN was used to determine the predictive accuracy of the samples
  from the training set (training set 1). In addition, linear discriminant analysis
  was used to test the predictive accuracy on the training and test sets. PD is Parkinson’s
  disease patients represented in green, HC is healthy controls represented in red,

  supranuclear palsy controls represented in purple and Control is HC+MSA+PSP controls
  represented in yellow. TP = true positive; TN = true negative; FP = false positive;
