caption: . TSG101 reporter cell lines to investigate protein delocalization. (A) The
  UBC-TSG101-HGS pathway is involved in endosomal sorting and exosome formation by
  linking mono-Ubc proteins to the ESCRT system. Mono-Ubc MLL fusion proteins may
  therefore lead to a translocation of TSG101 into the nucleus. This may cause a downregulation
  of p53 and a block of p21 transcription which results e.g. in enhanced growth properties.
  (B) First experiments with TSG101 sensor proteins (TSG101::mCh and TSG101::GFP)
  and co-transfected MLL fusions. Stable cell lines were selected and the expression
  of all four MLL fusion proteins was induced by Doxyxcycline for 48 hr. Translocations
  of cytosolic TSG101 into the nucleus was observed upon transfection with different
  MLL fusions (mCh::MLL-SMAP1, mCh::MLL-LASP1, GFP::SMAP1-MLL); solely GFP::LASP1-MLL
  remained in the golgi apparatus, however, was colocalizing again with the corresponding
  sensor protein.
