caption: 'Interacting compounds and PTMs of PPARγ that regulate its function in the
  endothelium. Activation of PPARγ itself inhibits phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and promotes
  the PI3K/AKT/eNOS/NO cascade. These two pathways collectively inhibit EC death,
  decrease leukocyte adhesion to the activated endothelium, and reduce permeability
  of the arterial wall. The upregulation of PPARγ can also inhibit the expression
  of NF-kB and reduce atherosclerotic inflammation. PPARγ has a reverse inhibitory
  effect on the WNT/β-Catenin signaling pathway (i.e., activation of PPARγ inhibits
  the activity of this pathway) and LOX-1 expression (via activation of AMPK and miR-590-5p,
  or inhibition of ROS and NF-kB). Upstream ERK1/2 hinders the activity of PPARγ.
  The main PTMs of PPARγ associated with atherosclerosis include acetylation and sumoylation.
  Acetylation promotes the secretion of IL-6, NOX2, iNOS and other substances responsible
  for inducing oxidative stress and inflammation. The TZD rosiglitazone has been shown
  to inhibit PPARγ acetylation. PPARγ sumoylation can be induced by HG/HF/PA via the
  ROS–IKK–PIAS1 pathway. SUMOylated PPARγ readily interacts with FOXO1, contributing
  to endothelial IR. Abbreviations: ERK, extracellular regulated protein kinase; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa B; NOX, NADPH oxidase;
  rosi, rosiglitazone; RXR, retinoid X receptor; iNOS, inducible NO synthase; IKK,
  IkB kinase; HG, high glucose; HF, high fat; PA, palmitic acid; PIAS1, protein inhibitor
  of activated STAT1; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; oxLDL,
  oxidized-low-density lipoprotein; LOX-1, lectin-like receptor for oxidized LDL;
  AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; IR, insulin resistance. The red lines represent
  promotion and the black ones represent inhibition. Meanwhile, the solid lines represent
  direct action, and the dotted lines represent indirect action, indicating omitted
  processes.'
