caption: 'Mechanisms of rituximab-mediated cell death. Rituximab-coated B cells are
  killed by at least four different mechanisms: (1) binding of rituximab to CD20 on
  the B-cell surface causes activation of the complement cascade, which generates
  the membrane attack complex (MAC), which can directly induce B-cell lysis by complement-dependent
  cytotoxicity (CDC). (2) Binding of rituximab allows interaction with natural killer
  (NK) cells via Fc receptors (FcRs) III, which leads to antibody-dependent cellular
  cytotoxicity (ADCC). (3) The Fc portion of rituximab and the deposited complement
  fragments allow recognition by both FcRs and complement receptors on macrophages,
  which leads to phagocytosis and ADCC. (4) The crosslinking of several molecules
  of rituximab and CD20 in the lipid raft determines the interaction of these complexes
  with elements of a signaling pathway involving Src kinases that mediate direct apoptosis.
