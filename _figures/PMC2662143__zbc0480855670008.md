caption: Proposed model demonstrating signaling events involved in  apo(a)-mediated
  endothelial cell contraction and increased permeability.  Binding of apo(a) to a
  putative receptor results in activation of Rho, which  binds to and activates its
  downstream effector Rho kinase (RhoK). MLC  is activated through phosphorylation
  of the MLC by  Ca2+/calmodulin-activated MLC kinase (MLCK). RhoK enhances  MLC phosphorylation
  through inactivation of MLC phosphatase by direct  phosphorylation of its 130-kDa
  regulatory subunit (MYPT1). RhoK is also able  to promote VE-cadherin dispersion.
  This, together with increased stress fiber  formation, combines to promote loss
  of cell-cell contact and thus decreased  endothelial barrier function (i.e. increased
  vascular permeability).  The effects of apo(a) are blocked by the lysine analogue
  ε-ACA.
