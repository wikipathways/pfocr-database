caption: 'Regulation of milk protein synthesis in bovine mammary gland. The Figure
  outlines the main significant pathways and cellular functions related to genes associated
  with milk proteins in bovine mammary gland, including: (i) the regulation of ion
  and cation transmembrane transport, which is related to the ability of casein micelles
  to allow transport of calcium phosphate into milk and prevent the formation of calcified,
  proteinaceous deposits containing amyloid fibrils; and (ii) hormonal and neuronal
  signaling, particularly through the concerted action of prolactin (PRL), glucocorticoids
  (GC) and insulin (INS), which are responsible for the regulation of milk protein
  contents. PIH: prolactin-inhibiting hormone; CRH: corticotropin-releasing hormone;
  ACTH: adrenocorticotropic hormone. This figure was partly created using images provided
  by Servier Medical Art (http://www.servier.com/Powerpoint-image-bank/).'
