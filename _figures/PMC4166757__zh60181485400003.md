caption: Illustration of the cellular mechanisms by which BK channels mediate β-adrenergic
  relaxation in UBSM cells with demonstration of the differential outcomes in the
  wild-type (WT) mouse (top) and the BK-knockout (KO) mouse (bottom), respectively.
  In UBSM cells from WT mice, functionally active BK channels regulate Ca2+ entry
  via L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC), and, thus, contractility (top).
  In addition, BK channels are under the local control of the so-called “Ca2+ sparks”
  caused by Ca2+ release from the ryanodine receptors of the sarcoplasmic reticulum,
  adjacent to the cell membrane. Following permanent BK channel pore forming α-subunit
  gene deletion in the BK channel KO mouse, an adaptive compensatory upregulation
  of the β-AR/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway develops. The enhanced β-AR/PKA activity
  compensates for the increased Ca2+ entry via L-type VDCC that occurs due to sustained
  membrane depolarization in the absence of the BK channels. AC, adenylyl cyclase;
  BK, large-conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ channels; β-AR, β-adrenergic
  receptors; VDCC, L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels; Gs, stimulatory G protein;
