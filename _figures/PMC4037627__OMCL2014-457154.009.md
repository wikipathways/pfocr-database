caption: 'Schematic model of the major molecular events by which rotenone provokes
  apoptosis in Jurkat cells under different glucose conditions. Rotenone inhibits
  complex-I (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) ensuing overproduction of superoxide
  anion radicals (O2∙−) which dismutate enzymatically (by superoxide dismutase, SOD)
  or nonenzymatically into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This last compound freely diffuses
  through mitochondrial membranes to cellular cytoplasm (1). H2O2 may in turn activate
  one or several kinases (e.g., the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase
  1, MEKK1; spleen tyrosine kinase, Syk; apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1, ASK)
  which can directly or indirectly activate both JNK/c-Jun (2) and NF-κB (3) via phosphorylation
  of the IκBα (i.e., the repressor of NF-κB). Once NF-κB is active, it translocates
  into the nucleus and transcribes p53 protein (4). In turn, p53 transcribes proapoptotic
  proteins (e.g., Bax) which are able to permeabilize mitochondria (5), thus promoting
  the activation of caspase-3 (6), which signals DNA fragmentation ((7), stage II
  nuclei fragmentation), and chromatin fragmentation ((9), stage I nuclei fragmentation)
  as a result of the apoptotic-inducer factor (AIF) protein action (8). Additionally,
  p53 can establish two independent but complementary vicious cycles. It can transcribe
  pro-oxidant proteins (e.g., p53-induced gene-3 (PIG3), proline oxidase (PO), (10),
  which generate more H2O2 (1) amplifying the initial H2O2 > kinases > NF-κB > p53
  cell death signaling. p53 can also transcribe Parkin protein (11), which is phosphorylated
  by the autophosphorylated PINK-1 protein, to further activate NF-κB (3), thus amplifying
  the NF-κB > p53 > Parkin death axis. The overproduction of H2O2 also causes DJ-1
  (12) oxidation (DJ-1 o) of Cysteine106 residue into cysteine sulfonate (Cys106-SO3−).
  This chemical reaction might change the structural conformation of DJ-1 into protein
  aggregates (13). However, when cells are cultured in high glucose concentration
  (e.g., 55 mM glucose) in presence of ROT, they are able to properly mount an antioxidant
  response (e.g., probably via pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to increase GSH by
  NADPH generation). Hence, functional mitochondria and normal nuclei morphology are
  preserved.'
