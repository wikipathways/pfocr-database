caption: Summary of electrophysiological changes recorded after appetitive conditioning
  in Lymnaea. A, In control animals a lip touch activates early components of the
  mechanosensory pathway, which can be recorded as extracellular spikes on the CBCs
  (box 1). Putative sensory integrating neurons in the buccal ganglia () are thought
  to distribute weak synaptic inputs to many feeding neurons, including members of
  the interneuronal CPG network and identified motoneurons, such as B3. The synaptic
  response seen on the B3 after a lip touch consists of an EPSP (box 2). This, and
  the possible synaptic response on the CPG network are subthreshold. The lack of
  activation of the CPG by the touch input means that the pathways linking the CPG
  to the motoneuronal followers (indicated by dashed arrows) do not become activated,
  and, consequently, no rhythmic fictive feeding occurs. The CPG and the B3 in inactive
  state are shown as hollow circles. B, In conditioned animals, the lip touch evokes
  facilitated extracellularly recorded spike activity on the CBC (box 1). This may
  lead to an increased activation of putative sensory integrating neurons, which in
  turn, may contribute to the facilitated synaptic drive to both CPG and motoneurons,
  such as B3 (box 2, expanded time-base trace). Rhythmic activity in the CPG, triggered
  by the CS, provides synaptic drive to the motoneuronal network, and this leads to
  the patterned activity we observe after the touch-evoked EPSP on the B3 motoneuron
  in conditioned animals (box 2, bottom trace). The CPG and the B3 in activated state
  are shown as filled circles. Satiety will selectively suppress the expression of
  CPG response to touch without affecting the facilitated EPSP response in B3.
