caption: (a) Canonical two-component systems expand and diversify through gene duplication
  and subsequent divergence. After a pathway duplication, the specificity residues
  on the two identical systems diverge, such that each pathway continues to interact
  while reducing cross-talk between the two systems. (b) Two possible model for the
  origin of the phosphorelay driving B. subtilis sporulation. (top) Two canonical
  two-component pathways could have merged, with the response regulator of one pathway
  becoming the phosphodonor to another histidine kinase which then lost autophosphorylation
  activity. (bottom) KinA could have evolved to cross-talk with an existing response
  regulator with subsequent co-option of Spo0B as a histidine phosphotransferase and
  changes in KinA to prefer Spo0F over Spo0A.
