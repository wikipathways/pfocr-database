caption: A model for H2O2-modulated permeability increase and cytoskeleton reorganization
  via MARCKS phosphorylation in endothelial cells. This figure shows a model for H2O2
  modulation of endothelial permeability and cytoskeleton rearrangement via MARCKS
  phosphorylation in endothelial cells. Data presented in this article indicate that
  H2O2 promotes MARCKS phosphorylation through a Rac1/Abl1/PLCγ1/PKCδ signaling pathway,
  associated with increased endothelial permeability and cytoskeleton reorganization.
  Some of the components of this pathway, such as PKCδ, may have additional roles
  in the modulation of basal endothelial permeability (see ).
