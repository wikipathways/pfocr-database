caption: An speculated miRNA expression regulation pathway related to hormone metabolism(a)
  Certain auxin response factor (ARF) family members are directly regulated by miRNAs
  (miR160 and miR167). (b) A possible negative feedback regulatory loop involving
  miR160, miR167, and certain ARF family members. Numerous copies of the ARF recognition
  motif are found in the putative promoter regions of MIR160d, MIR160f, MIR167a, and
  MIR167g. Also, numerous copies of gibberellin (GA) response (GAR) elements are found
  in the putative promoter regions of MIR160f, MIR160g, MIR160h, MIR167a, MIR167c,
  MIR167d, and MIR167i. We speculate that GA regulates miRNAs to inhibit the formation
  of auxin
