  plots of 21 jejunal metabolites within key metabolic pathways, with a focus on the
  Arginine-Proline metabolism (KEGG pathway: gga00330) in broiler chickens. The size
  of each bubble corresponds to the significance of the pathway, while its horizontal
  axis placement reflects the impact score. Arrow mark shows the enrichment of butyric
