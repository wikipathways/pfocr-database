caption: The biosynthetic pathway of NAPE and NAE. NAPE is biosynthesized from PE
  by cPLA2ε or PLAATs and metabolized to NAE directly by NAPE-PLD (a solid arrow)
  or through alternative pathways (dotted arrows). Closed shades indicate an NAE moiety.
  The enzymes with a question mark indicate that their enzymatic activities have been
  detected only in vitro, and their in vivo relevance has not yet been confirmed.
  G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; PL, phospholipid; NAAA, N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing
  acid amidase; FAAH, fatty acid amid hydrolase
