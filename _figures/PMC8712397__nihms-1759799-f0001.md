caption: Cells use O-GlcNAc modifications to sense metabolites resulting from altered
  nutrient or stress levels, a process that alters protein behaviors and can lead
  to disease. a) Nutrient flux through the through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  creates UDP-GlcNAc, which is dynamically cycled onto proteins as O-GlcNAcylation
  by OGT and OGA. b) O-GlcNAc events regulate diverse cellular functions depending
  on the biological context and the type of protein that is modified. c) Aberrant
  O-GlcNAcylation is observed in numerous diseases that display altered hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway flux.
