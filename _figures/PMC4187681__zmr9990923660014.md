caption: Pathway of coenzyme B12-dependent ethanolamine utilization. Ethanolamine
  degradation proceeds by a pathway analogous to that of 1,2-PD degradation (), the
  main difference being C2 intermediates rather than C3. As is the case for 1,2-PD
  degradation, the fermentation of ethanolamine provides a source of ATP and reducing
  power (NADH) but no source of cell carbon. Under aerobic conditions or during anaerobic
  respiration with tetrathionate, acetyl-CoA feeds into the TCA cycle to provide additional
  ATP and biosynthetic building blocks. *, the acetate kinase used for ethanolamine
  degradation is a housekeeping enzyme encoded outside the eut operon.
