caption: Proposed model for the increase of bioactivity of membrane-bound TRAIL. (A)
  In the case of soluble TRAIL, death receptors (DRs) trimerize and promote the sequential
  recruitment of FADD and of caspase-8, forming the death-inducing signaling complex
  (DISC). Caspase-8 processing is enough to trigger apoptosis, but the mitochondrial
  pathway (through Bid processing) is needed to induce enough caspase-3 activation.
  (B) When TRAIL is present as a membrane-bound protein, TRAIL trimers on the membrane
  surface induce receptor clusterization and the subsequent enhanced DISC recruitment.
  Consequently, a high amount of caspase-8 is processed, being enough to directly
  induce caspase-3 activation.
