caption: Schematic model showing the potential role of CD38-mediated Ca2+ signals
  in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
  cell endocytosis depends on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) catalytic
  receptor (ACE2R) and proteolytic priming (i.e., TMPRSS2 peptidase) (shown in ).
  ANG II binds to the ANG II receptor (AT1R) to induce activation of either type II-
  or type III-CD38 catalytic receptor, which in turn stimulates Ca2+ release through
  2-pore channel (TPC) and ryanodine receptor (RyR). Ca2+ influx through TRPM2 channels
  also cooperates to provide a high concentration of Ca2+ in the cytosol. The overload
  of cytosolic Ca2+ is involved in the activation of the 1) reactive oxygen species
  (ROS)/IFN-type I/IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) metabolic sequence; 2) NF-κB via pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs)/Toll-like receptors (TLRs)/MyD88-dependent pathway; and
  3) NLRP3 inflammasome. This sequence of events is proposed as the likely effects
  in COVID-19 that culminate in a cytokine storm and multiorgan fibrosis. Pharmacological
  interventions to control the CD38-dependent NAD+ metabolome are being proposed to
  create hurdles at different steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AT1R blockers (ARBs)
  and ACE inhibitor (ACEi) 1) block ANG II/AT1R activation; 2) increase expression
  of ACE2 (arrested by viral binding); and 3) induce ANG (1–7) to counterbalance the
  deleterious proinflammatory effects of ANG II/AT1R (see ). In parallel, CD38 activation
  by ANG II is reduced and consequently NAD+ levels are boosted. Similar effects might
  be obtained using CD38 inhibitors (CD38inh) or by means of NAD+ precursors supplied.
  The sACE2 acting as decoy-receptor blocks the viral entry. Therapeutic checkpoints
  are depicted as hypothesis driven but are based on observations in other viral infections,
  CD38-related diseases, and preliminary data on COVID-19 (see text). PARPs, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases.
