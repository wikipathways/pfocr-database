caption: An exemplified model for understanding the N-degron pathway involving ubiquitin
  proteasomal degradation of ERF-VII (for example, RELATED TO AP2 3, RAP2.3) TF as
  a part of the NO sensing mechanism in plants. The N-terminal methionine is cleaved
  by MAPs exposing the second residue, cysteine (Cys). Cysteine gets oxidized by the
  action of PCOs. In this step, the role of NO is also reported, so possible NO-mediated
  oxidation of cysteine residue via PTMs still needs to be explored. The oxidized
  cysteine (Cys*) of the target protein then undergoes arginylation by Arg-tRNA and
  is catalyzed by ATE1, which helps in its recognition by PRT6 N-recognin for its
  ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. MAPs—aminopeptidases; PCOs—plant cysteine oxidases;
  PTMs—post-translational modifications; ATE1—arginyl-transferases; PRT6—proteolysis
  6 E3 ligases. The model structure of RAP2.3 was obtained from UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P42736#structure
  accessed on 19 December 2021). The structure of Arg-tRNAArg and ATE1 is reprinted
