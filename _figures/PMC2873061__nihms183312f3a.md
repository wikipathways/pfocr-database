caption: (a) The eicosanoid signaling pathway is mediated by the enzymes phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and lipooxygenase (LOX). PLA2 hydrolyzes phospholipids
  from the cellular membrane releasing AA, EPA or DHA, and lysophospholipids . In
  the presence of O2, COX and LOX oxidize C=C from AA, EPA, and DHA thereby producing
  important biological eicosanoid mediators that regulate the inflammatory response,
  such as thromboxanes, prostaglandins, and prostacyclins, producing reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) in the process . (b) Inhibition of PLA2, COX, LOX, and desaturase
  delays the loss of pluripotency at day 4, as indicated by the higher expression
  of pluripotent markers Oct4 (green) and Nanog (red) relative to the DMSO control
  (green and red lines as references). Sample labeled mESC corresponds to the levels
  of expression of Oct4 and Nanog at day 0 (taken for normalization). *indicates a
  p-value < 0.05. ** indicates a p-value < 0.001. (c) Fatty acid 5Δ and 6Δ desaturase
  inhibition by curcumin and sesamin, and COX inhibition by SC236 and SC560, significantly
  delay differentiation and neuron maturation. ESC cultures were treated with either
  curcumin, sesamin, COX inhibitors, or a DMSO control at various concentrations from
  days 1–10 of differentiation. Neuronal differentiation was evaluated with βIII-tubulin
  positive or Map2ab/βIII-tubulin double positive neuron counts at day 10 of differentiation.
  Four cell culture replicates were analyzed for each inhibitor concentration. Data
  points and error bars represent mean values and s.d.
