caption: (A) Schematic representation of metabolic flux distributions in selected
  reactions. Inside each pair of growth/infected panels, arrow thickness represents
  the relative net (full) and exchange (dashed) fluxes between conditions. Absolute
  values are shown in units of nmol/106 cells/h. Percentage values represent the proportion
  of pentose-phosphates that are cycle back to glycolysis. (B) Estimated fluxes and
  associated 95% confidence lower and upper bounds of the shown reactions. ACL, ATP-citrate
  lyase; AKGDH, alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase; AT, alanine aminotransferase; IDH,
  isocitrate dehydrogenase (lumps aconitase activity); IDHe, IDH exchange flux; GDH,
  glutamate dehydrogenase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase;
  ME, malic enzyme; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PK, pyruvate
  kinase; PPPox, pentose-phosphate pathway, oxidative branch; PT, pyruvate transport
  flux; PTe, PT exchange flux.
