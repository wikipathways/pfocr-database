caption: 'Control of the downstream NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways of PRRs mediated
  by protein palmitoylationTLRs (without TLR3) are located on the membrane and endosomes
  can activate the adaptor protein Myd88 to activate the NF-κB and MAPK signaling
  pathways. Similar to TLRs, cytosolic DNA sensors, NLRs, and the components of RLRs,
  including NOD1 and NOD2, also could sensitize NF-κB signaling. During NF-κB signaling,
  p65, IκB-α, IκB-β, and IKK-β can be palmitoylated. The palmitoylation of CDC42 at
  Cys186 facilitates NF-κB signaling activation. TNFR1 palmitoylation at Cys248 inhibits
  NF-κB signaling. However, APT2 can suppress TNFR1 palmitoylation to promote signaling
  activation in NF-κB signaling. In addition, Myd88 palmitoylation mediated by the
  activation of CD36 with PA can sensitize NF-κB signaling. In MAPK signaling, ERK1,
  ERK2, JNK2, and JNK3 can be directly palmitoylated. Although it is unknown whether
  p38 MAPK proteins can be directly palmitoylated, the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP
  can inhibit p38 MAPK signaling activation. In addition, the palmitoylation site
  of ERK1 is Cys271, and ERK2 palmitoylation site is Cys254. Moreover, multiple ZDHHCs
  are beneficial for palmitoylation of ERK1/2. In contrast, APT2 depalmitoylates ERK1/2.
  The interaction of RAB27B with ZDHHC9 contributes to MRAS palmitoylation to activate
  ERK signaling. However, hPAR2 palmitoylation at Cys361 represses ERK signaling.
  CD36 palmitoylation in hepatocytes facilitates JNK signaling activation. In adipocytes,
  CD36 palmitoylation is promoted by ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC7 but inhibited by APT1, which
  facilitates the activation of ERK signaling. PA: palmitic acid'
