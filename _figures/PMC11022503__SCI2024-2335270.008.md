caption: Schematic model of the proposed mechanism of erroneous differentiation of
  TSPCs under high glucose. Under high glucose conditions, increased HMGB1 activates
  the RAGE/β-catenin signaling pathway, leading to enhanced osteogenic differentiation
  of TSPCs and decreased tenogenic differentiation, contributing to the pathogenesis
  of diabetic tendinopathy
