caption: Endothelial barrier and coagulation cascades. Lined by membrane-binding proteoglycans
  and glycosaminoglycan side chains, dearrangement of endothelial glycocalyx result
  in loss of anti-thrombogenicity and exposure of adhesion molecules, which allow
  leukocyte adhesion, platelet recruitment, and thrombus formation. Increased vascular
  permeability trigger leukocyte extravasation, plasma protein leakage, and tissue
  edema. Under immunogenic stimuli, procoagulant tissue factors were substantially
  expressed in the form of microvesicles by macrophages and neutrophils, which triggered
  extrinsic coagulation cascade and cleavage of prothrombin. Neutrophils and platelets
  work reciprocally to regulate innate immune response and bacterial clearance via
  NETosis and platelet-mediated responses. During sepsis, NET-derived histones HMGB1
  and cfDNA abundantly found serve as procoagulants that accelerate thrombus formation,
  while activated platelets and RBC recruitment result in thrombocytopenia and platelet-rich
  thrombus. In order to monitor coagulation dynamics, thrombin interacts with endothelial-bound
  TM to exhibit profound anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory effects. In the presence
  of APC-EPCR, TM/thrombin interact with coagulation–fibrolysis system to act as negative
  feedback loop. APC–EPCR interaction also allow switching of PAR-1 signaling to anti-inflammatory
  pattern and strengthened endothelial integrity via activities mediated by S1P and
  Ang/Tie axis. Besides, TM/thrombin directly inactivate procoagulant alarmins to
  further restrict immunocoagulation. During severe infection, dysregulation of Ang/Tie
  axis were associated with weakened vascular stability, which include inhibition
  of junctional protein, destabilization of cortical actin, and increased vascular
  adhesion and permeability. Finally, extensive formation of inflammatory thrombus
  and activation of coagulation cascades result in microcirculatory dysfunction and
  organ injury. TM thrombomodulin, PAR-1 protease activated receptor 1, EPCR endothelial
