caption: 'Dynamic differentially expressed (DE) genes were involved in T and B cell
  development as well as innate and adaptive immune response. Aa, Ab, and Ac were
  innate immune response including toll-like receptor signaling pathway, NOD-like
  receptor signaling pathway, phagosome and lysosome pathway. B indicates the process
  of B and T lymphocytes lymphopoiesis and the regulation genes in each step. C represents
  adaptive immune response under APEC infection. Genes in blue color were down-regulated
  while genes in red color were up-regulated. The pink color indicates significantly
  changed pathways that were not discussed here. The lowercase a, b, c, d indicate
  different contrasts: a, day 5 susceptible birds vs. day 5 non-challenged birds;
  b, day 5 susceptible birds vs. day 5 resistant birds; c, day 5 susceptible birds
  vs. day 1 susceptible birds; d: day 1 susceptible birds vs. day 1 non-challenged
  birds. LBP, lipopolysaccharide binding protein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PGN, peptidoglycan;
