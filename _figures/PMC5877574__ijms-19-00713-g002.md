caption: Schematic illustration of the signaling pathways in response to DNA damage
  and key effectors that interact with ER signaling. After perception of DNA lesions
  induced by IR directly or indirectly (by ROS generation), various biochemical signals
  are activated by cascades of protein kinases. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
  and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) kinases are upstream activators of IR-induced G1/S
  and G2/M checkpoint arrest. The G1/S checkpoint pathway is operated by p53 and Cdc25A
  in distinct branches. Firstly, ATM or Chk2 directly phosphorylates the p53 transcription
  factor and targets mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2), achieving the stabilization
  and accumulation of the p53 protein. The critical effector of p53-dependent transcription
  is p21, which is a Cdk inhibitor and binds the complexes of Cyclin E/Cdk2 and Cyclin
  D/Cdk4/6. Another branch of the G1/S checkpoint pathway is activated rapidly via
  ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Chk2. Subsequently, Cdc25A, an activator of the
  Cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase, is degraded, preventing the activation of Cdk2. The ATM/Chk2-Cdc25A-Cdk2
  axis accounts for the activation of the G1/S checkpoint via a p53-independent mechanism.
  In the G2/M checkpoint signaling pathway, the key downstream effector is the Cyclin
  B/Cdk1 protein complex, whose activation is restrained by ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1
  after IR-induced DNA damage. Moreover, Cdc25C phosphatase is also inhibited by Chk1/2
  to activate the G2/M checkpoint. Key effectors that interact with ER signaling are
  marked in blue.
