caption: 'Integrative analysis of DNA methylome, transcriptome and functional enrichment
  data. (a) In the figure are the numbers of differentially expressed genes (GE),
  differentially methylated CpG sites (meCpG) and their overlap (both) between cisplatin
  sensitive and resistant cells (M019i) before cisplatin treatment (0 μM), and changes
  detected in response to drug treatment. The putative upstream regulators with gene
  expression changes and canonical pathway enrichments common for both DNA methylome
  and transcriptome data are shown in the (b) Gene expression changes, DNA methylation
  changes or both are shown for the known direct target genes of KLF4, in different
  comparisons as indicated by the color codes in (a). (c) Comparison of differences
  observed before cisplatin treatment and in response to 7 μM cisplatin treatment
  of resistant cells as indicated in the figure. *indicates the number of differentially
  methylated sites: in integrative comparisons, the number of overlapping genes closest
  to differentially methylated sites is shown. The functional analyses and networks
  in the figure were generated by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA®, Qiagen).'
