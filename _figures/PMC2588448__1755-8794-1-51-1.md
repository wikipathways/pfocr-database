caption: Methodology for application of EPSA. A. For each perturbation in the training
  compendium, replicate log2 expression of treated vs. untreated cells were analyzed.
  B. For each perturbation, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) [] software
  was applied to identify genes with significantly altered expression. Median values
  among the replicates of log2(treated/untreated) were used to represent genes in
  a signature. C. These values were correlated with test profiles. A false discovery
  rate was calculated for each perturbation, for the average level of correlation
  with disease profiles. D. For those signatures with a statistically significant
  level of correlation, survival analysis was performed using the EPSA score, or the
  degree of signature correlation, as a factor influencing survival. Survival analysis
  was carried out using the survival package in R.
