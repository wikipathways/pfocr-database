caption: Interaction between gut microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic dysfunction‐associated
  steatotic liver disease based on current study findings and existing literature.
  Anaerostipes hadrus, Agathobaculum butyriciproducens, Roseburia inulinivorans, Roseburia
  faecis, Lachnospira pectinoschiza  and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii produce at least
  one of the short‐chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate and butyrate). Acetate and
  propionate facilitate adipocytes to produce adiponectin and leptin, which improve
  insulin sensitivity in cells and inhibit the production of free fatty acids to decrease
  visceral obesity. Butyrate can promote the assembly of tight junction proteins in
  gut epithelial cells, decrease gut permeability and inhibit immune cells to reduce
  inflammation. The pyruvate fermentation to acetate and (S)‐lactate I pathway produces
  acetate to take function, while the acetyl‐CoA fermentation to butanoate II pathway
  produces butyrate. The L‐arginine biosynthesis II (acetyl cycle) pathway and L‐arginine
  biosynthesis I (via L‐ornithine) pathway produce L‐arginine to increase the level
  of adiponectin. The superpathway of L‐lysine, L‐threonine, and L‐methionine biosynthesis
  II produces L‐lysine to increase adiponectin and L‐methionine to inhibit inflammation.
  The superpathway of L‐cysteine biosynthesis (mammalian), L‐glutamate, and L‐glutamine
  biosynthesis pathway, and L‐ornithine biosynthesis I pathway produce glutathione
  to inhibit inflammation. The CMP‐3‐deoxy‐D‐manno‐octulosonate biosynthesis pathway
  produces LPS, which promotes inflammation and dampens insulin sensitivity. LPS,
  lipopolysaccharides
