caption: 'The mechanism by which DDR affects PD-L1 expression and TME in tumors. In
  tumors, the defectiveness or inhibition of the DDR can lead to the accumulation
  of DNA damage, whereby double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA both accumulate
  in cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic DNA activates the cGAS/STING and RIG-I/MAVS pathways and
  eventually the type I interferon (IFN) pathway, ultimately recruiting both chemokines
  and immune cells (such as T cells, NK cells, and DCs). Specifically, STING promotes
  the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of type I IFN transcriptional regulatory
  factors TBK1 and IFN regulator 3 (IRF3), while also activating the NF-κB pathway
  that interacts with IRF3. RIG-I can be considered an important participant in the
  immune activation of cancers presenting with genomic instability, as it can be activated
  via DNA, and combined with the adapter molecule MAV, which then activates IKK and/or
  TBK1 when stimulated, and finally activates the type I IFN pathway through downstream
  transcription factors. The activated TIL releases IFNγ, which acts on tumor cells
  and mediates STAT1/3-dependent PD-L1 upregulation. The ATM/ATR/Chk1 pathway can
  also induce PD-L1 expression. ATM can directly activate and participate in STING-mediated
  downstream pathways, and PARPi can promote PD-L1 expression by downregulating GSK3β.
  The release of the HMGB1 protein from dying tumor cells can bind TLR-4 on the surface
  of both DCs and macrophages in order to induce INF-β (TRIF) signal transduction,
  which subsequently activates IRF3 and NF-κB pathways. In addition, TLR4 recruits
  MyD88 and activates the NF-κB pathway to promote the transcription and secretion
  of various pro-inflammatory factors. Following this sequence of events, these factors
  serve to promote DC activation and trigger an immune response. HMGB1 can also upregulate
  PD-L1 expression in adjacent surviving tumor cells via TLR4/MyD88/TRIF signaling.
  In addition, ATM inhibitors can inhibit the induction of Tregs by tumor cell-derived
  small extracellular vesicles (sEV). (ATM: Ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein;
