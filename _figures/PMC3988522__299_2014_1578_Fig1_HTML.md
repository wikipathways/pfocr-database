caption: BR-signaling pathways in rice and Arabidopsis. The left panel shows the BR
  signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis. BR directly interacts with BRI1 and
  BAK1 to form the BRI1–BR–BAK1 complex. Sequential transphosphorylation between BRI1
  and BAK1 activates BRI1, which then phosphorylates BSKs/CDG1. The active BSKs/CDG1
  phosphorylates BSU1, which dephosphorylates and inactivates BIN2. BZR1 and BES1/BZR2
  are dephosphorylated by PP2A and move into the nucleus to induce expression of PRE1,
  but repress IBH1 expression. PRE1, IBH1 and HBI1 form an antagonistic cascade to
  regulate plant growth. SBI1 (SUPPRESSOR OF BRI1) is involved in the deactivation
  of BRI1 through methylation of PP2A. The right panel shows the BR-signaling pathway
  in rice. BR binding to OsBRI1 promotes association with OsBAK1, and inactivates
  OsBIN2 via an unknown mechanism. OsBIN2 phosphorylates OsBZR1, LIC and DLT, and
  inhibits their activity. OsBZR1 induces the expression of ILI1, but represses the
  expression of IBH1, LIC and DLT; whereas LIC represses the expression of OsBZR1.
  The heterotrimeric G-protein α subunit known as D1/RGA1 in rice is involved in another
  BR-signaling pathway in which D1/RGA1 and TUD1 act together to mediate BR signaling.
  Red indicates the components play positive roles in BR signaling, whereas green
  denotes the components that play negative roles
