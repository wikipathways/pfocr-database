caption: Left half, signaling via IPS-1 following dsRNA/ssRNA recognition by RIG-I
  and MDA5. IPS-1 serves as a platform to coordinate the activation of two of the
  signaling pathways also utilized by the TLRs (cf. ), that is, the activation of
  RIP1 for NF-κB nuclear translocation and the activation of IKKs for IRF3 phosphorylation
  and translocation, leading to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-β,
  respectively. Right half, formation of inflammasomes by NLRP3. Inactive NLRP3 oligomerizes
  upon stimulation by an unknown mechanism. ASC becomes associated with the complex.
  This leads to the recruitment of procaspase-1, which dimerizes and autoactivates
  by proteolytic cleavage, generating active caspase-1. Caspase-1 mediates the activation
  of IL-18 and IL-1β from inactive pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1β, respectively. (…), the
  continuation of this pathway is outlined in .
