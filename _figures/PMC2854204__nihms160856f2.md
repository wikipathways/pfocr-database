caption: (a) Negative feedback mechanisms that limit activation of autophagy are shown
  in red. Protein degradation within the autolysosome raises the intracellular levels
  of amino acids, leading to activation of TOR through the RagA/RagC small GTPases
  and other nutrient signaling pathways. TOR activity is self-limited through an S6K-mediated
  inhibition of IRS1 (not shown), an essential component in the insulin/PI3K/Akt pathway
  upstream of Rheb. S6K is also involved in a self-limiting pathway in autophagy induction
  downstream of TOR, probably through its function in protein synthesis. Inhibition
  of TOR leads to both activation of Atg1 and inactivation of S6K; both of these kinases
  play positive roles in starvation-induced autophagy. (b) Feed-forward mechanisms
  in TOR signaling, indicated by green lines, may lead to amplification and stabilization
  of initially modest changes in TOR activity. DEPTOR, PRAS40 and Atg1 are each inhibited
  by TOR mediated phosphorylation and in turn inhibit TOR activity. In yeast, TOR
  mediates activation of Tap42, which leads to downregulation of the phosphatase Sit4
  and decreased activity of the Tap42 inhibitor Tip41, resulting in further activation
  of Tap42.
