caption: An intricate gene regulatory network controls OL differentiation. The crosstalk
  between extrinsic signals, transcription factors and chromatin modifiers determines
  the balance between repressive signals that inhibit OL differentiation and de-repressive
  signals that stimulate OL differentiation. Of all the factors described in this
  review, only those with two or more connections are illustrated in this figure.
  Red indicates repression and green represents activation. Dashed lines represent
  speculations; double-headed arrows indicate physical interactions. Reference numbers
  are marked on each pathway.
