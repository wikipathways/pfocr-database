caption: The diagram picturing two alternative pathways of sorting damaged mitochondrial
  components into mitochondrial-derived vesicles. Either is the MDVs formation initiated
  by SNX9 that recognizes and binds to the mitochondrial membrane, or the fragments
  intended for degradation are decomposed in lysosomes, which is regulated by PRKN
