caption: The AKT signaling pathway is known to be regulated by miR-21 through the
  targeting and suppression of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog
  (PTEN). Normally, PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3), preventing AKT activation. However, reduced PTEN levels due to miR-21 result
  in increased PIP3 levels and, thus, sustained phosphorylation and the activation
  of AKT. This boosts cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis resistance, all
  leading to tumor progression. The figure shows how miR-21 affects the PTEN/AKT pathway
  and its oncogenic role in cancer development [71,72]. Created with BioRender.com;
