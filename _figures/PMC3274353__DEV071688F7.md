caption: Model for the roles of FGF/MAP kinase signaling in the formation of NANOG-positive
  epiblast cells or GATA6-positive hypoblast/primitive endoderm cells. In mouse, FGF
  signaling activates MAPK, which leads to the expression of GATA6 and repression
  of NANOG. In cattle, FGF signaling represses NANOG expression via MAPK. As a result
  of NANOG expression, expression of GATA6 is inhibited. GATA6 expression is also
  activated via an as yet unknown (question mark) FGF/MAPK-independent pathway. In
  human, activation of NANOG and GATA6 expression is coordinated via unknown (question
  mark) mechanisms.
