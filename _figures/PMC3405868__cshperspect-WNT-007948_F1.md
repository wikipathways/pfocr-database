caption: The conserved Wnt/β-catenin-dependent signaling pathway. Wnt-sending cells
  are shown above, Wnt-receiving cells below. (A) In the absence of signal, the destruction
  complex (including Axin, APC, GSK3β, and CK1α) phosphorylates β-catenin, targeting
  it for ubiquitination and destruction by the proteasome. The transcription factor
  TCF interacts with repressors (including transducing-like enhancers [TLE]) to keep
  target gene expression low. (B) After processing in the sending cell, some secreted
  Wnt binds to a Frizzled/LRP coreceptor, which leads to phosphorylation of the intracellular
  domain of LRP, inactivation of the destruction complex, and stabilization of β-catenin.
  After nuclear translocation β-catenin binds to TCF at Wnt target genes and up-regulates
  their expression. Some secreted Wnt ligand is sequestered by extracellular inhibitors
  such as SFRPs.
