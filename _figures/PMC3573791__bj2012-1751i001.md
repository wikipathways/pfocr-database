caption: (A) Meprin α and meprin β are multi-domain enzymes, building dimers linked
  by one intermolecular disulfide bond between the MAM domains. Meprins are expressed
  as zymogens with a propeptide (PRO) N-terminal to the protease domain (CAT) that
  must be cleaved off proteolytically to gain full activity. Only meprin α contains
  an inserted domain (I) which is cleaved by furin during the secretory pathway, resulting
  in secretion of the protein and further oligomerization. Meprin α is the largest
  secreted protease known, up to 6 mDa in size, as visualized by electron microscopy
  of purified recombinant enzyme. Meprin β predominantly remains membrane-bound, but
  can be shed from the cell surface by ectodomain shedding through ADAM10 and ADAM17
  activity. C, cytosolic; TM, transmembrane. (B) Crystal structure of the ectodomain
  of dimeric human meprin β in different orientations (PDB codes 4GWN and 4GWM). One
  monomer is displayed with a transparent surface, revealing the ribbon structure.
  The colour code of the single domains correspond to (A). (C) Model of the membrane-bound
  form of meprin β and its orientation at the cell surface. EGF-like, transmembrane
  and cytosolic domains are displayed in grey, and phosphorylation sites are in yellow.
  Positively charged residues within the active-site cleft of the catalytic domain
  are shown in dark blue (see also F and Supplementary Movie S1 at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/450/bj4500253add.htm).
