caption: Biosynthesis pathways of acetyl-CoA and NAD cofactors, and their involvement
  in chromatin-related processes. Acetyl-CoA is produced via two pathways to metabolize
  pyruvate, involving the key catalytic action of ACL or AceCS1. Acetyl-CoA is an
  essential metabolite required for the activity of HATs involved in creating an active
  chromatin conformation via the acetylation of histones. NAD is produced via the
  NAD salvage pathway. It is an essential cofactor for the PARP and SIRT enzymes,
  among other proteins. A link exists between the two pathways, as indicated by the
  dashed lines, by virtue that the NAD-using enzyme, SIRT1, activates the AceCS1 enzyme
  via protein deacetylation, which, in turn, produces the metabolite acetyl-CoA.
