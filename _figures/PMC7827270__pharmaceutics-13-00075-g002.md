caption: 'Mechanism of action of Oxaliplatin: L-OHP is transported into the cell by
  solute carrier family 31 (copper transporter), member 1 (SLC31A1). Inside the cell,
  L-OHP forms adducts with the DNA, in particular with guanine bases, forming DNA
  crosslinks that induce apoptosis of the cell. Platinum-DNA adducts can be repaired
  by the nucleotide-excision repair pathway (NER), which involves several steps and
  enzyme complexes, including xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group G (XPG)
  which interacts with the TFIIH core complex helicase, composed by the excision repair
  cross-complementation group 2 (ERCC2) and xeroderma pigmentosum group B-complementing
  protein (XPB), unwinding the damaged DNA strand. This step is followed by an excision
  step of the damaged DNA fragment catalyzed by the endonuclease complex formed by
  the excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) and xeroderma pigmentosum,
  complementation group F (XPF), which is followed by the synthesis of a new DNA strand.
  Alternatively, platinum-DNA adducts can be repaired by the base-excision repair
  pathway (BER), in which the last step involves the binding of DNA 5′ and 3′ ends
  by the participation of X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) and DNA ligase
  III (Lig III). Both pathways lead to the elimination of platinum-DNA adducts inhibiting
  DNA damage driven apoptosis. L-OHP can be directly detoxified by glutathione S-transferase
  π 1 (GSTP1) into L-OHP-thiol conjugates that are eliminated. Polymorphisms of ERCC1,
  ERCC2, XRCC1, and GSTP1 coding genes have been associated with L-OHP response [].
