caption: Apoptosis is triggered through two major pathways referred to as the intrinsic
  and extrinsic pathways. The intrinsic pathway is activated by oligomerization of
  the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family proteins BAK and BAX. BAK/BAX oligomers form pores
  in the mitochondrial outer membrane, leading to the release of cytochrome c into
  the cytosol. Activation of BAK/BAX is regulated by proapoptotic (e.g., BAD and BID)
  or antiapoptotic (e.g., BCL-2) BCL-2 family proteins. Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1,
  which recruits procaspase-9, forming the apoptosome. In the apoptosome, caspase-9
  is activated by autoproteolytic cleavage, initiating the caspase-processing cascade.
  The extrinsic pathway is activated by engagement of membrane receptors such as Tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNFR1), death receptors, or Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs).
  These proteins induce the formation of signaling complexes involving TNFR1-associated
  death domain protein (TRADD) or Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and procaspase-8. Ubiquitylation of RIPK1
  by cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (cIAPs) stabilizes the complex and induces the
  activation of the transcription factor NFκB. FLIP, also present in the DISC, limits
  caspase-8 activity while promoting cell survival, cell proliferation, and the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines. Imbalances in this pathway, such as those imposed
  by cellular stress, allow the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-10, which in turn
  triggers the caspase activation cascade. Once active, executioner caspases (i.e.,
  caspase-2, -6, -8 and -10) bring about programmed apoptotic death. Apoptotic cells
  release messengers in the form of nucleosomal structures, shed receptors, anti-inflammatory
  metabolites or molecules packaged in apoptotic extracellular vesicles (ApoEVs).
  Phosphatidylserine (PS) molecules exposed on the outer surface of the plasma membrane
  function as “eat me” signals for phagocytes
