caption: The circadian biological clock gene pathways are intricately related but
  complex in nature. The pathways of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), the
  silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
  (SIRT1), mammalian forkhead transcription factors (FoxOs), the growth factor erythropoietin
  (EPO), and the wingless Wnt/β-catenin pathway can lead to beneficial outcomes and
  employ autophagy induction that may provide cellular protection, metabolic homeostasis,
  and prevent dementia and cognitive loss. Yet, biological clocks and alterations
  in circadian rhythm, such as during sleep disruption and fragmentation, also have
  the potential to lead to devastating effects involving tumorigenesis in conjunction
  with pathways involving Wnt that oversee angiogenesis and stem cell proliferation.
  Circadian rhythm disruption can result from shift work, exposure to artificial lighting,
  and from sleep fragmentation. A fine balance in the oversight of circadian biological
  clock gene pathways is required to foster safe and efficacious clinical outcomes
  for the treatment of dementia and cognitive loss.
