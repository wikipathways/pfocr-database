caption: 'ER stress and chemo-resistance: Role of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha
  (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 alpha (ATF6), and glucose-regulated protein
  78 (GRP78). Upon ERS, IRE splices and activates the X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1)
  that controls cycline A1 expression and regulates HIF1α targets. The activation
  of IRE1 leads to the activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), followed
  by inducing AP-1 transcriptional activity. The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is also involved
  in IRE1-mediated chemo-resistance. ATF6α possesses chemo-resistance through the
  regulation of ER chaperone BiP protein, mediated by the activation of disulfide
  isomerase A5 (PDIA5) and p38-dependent ATF6α-mTOR pathway, upon ER stress. GRP78
  exhibits its chemo-resistance properties, upon ERS, through the suppression of C/EBP
  homologous protein (CHOP), Bcl-2-interacting killer (BIK), phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced
  protein 1 (PMAIP1) or NOXA, Topo II, and induction of Bcl-2, leading to the activation
  of caspase-7 dependent apoptosis. GRP78 suppresses G1/S transition-related cyclins
  (D1, E1, and E2) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK4 and CDK6) protein expression.
  Additionally, the phosphorylation of GRP78 leads to the activation of Ras/MAPK and
  PI3-kinase downstream signaling, and the recruitment of p21 activated kinases 2
  (PAK-2) via NCK, thus, inhibiting the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2-associated death
  (Bad).'
