caption: 3 AA model for PIN1 polarization to the lobe region of PCs via a ROP signaling-based
  feed-forward mechanism.ROP2 in the lobing region is activated by extracellular auxin,
  and the activated ROP2-RIC4 pathway leads to inhibition of PIN1 internalization
  through RIC4-dependent cortical F-actin, causing PIN1 polarization to the lobing
  region. The PIN1-based export of auxin causes additional ROP2 activation to complete
  this feed-forward cycle. Recently published data implies a role for the activated
  ROP2-RIC4 pathway in the promotion of endosomal trafficking from Ara7-marked endosomes
  to recycling endosomes []. Ara7 is a Rab5 homolog and resides in an endosomal compartment
  from which many internalized proteins, including PIN1, are sorted for targeting
  to the vacuole or recycling to the PM.3 BA model for the regulatory function of
  the Cdc42-Par complex in the apical endocytic pathway.Recent data [] indicate that
  Cdc42 and the Par complex cooperate in regulating two distinct steps in the endocytosis
  of apical membrane components. Endocytosis from the plasma membrane is inhibited
  by the Cdc42–Par complex, which in turn promotes the progression of early endosomes
  (EE) to the multivesicular bodies/late endosomes (MVBs/LEs). Apical and basolateral
  proteins, including adherens junction (AJ) proteins, follow distinct endocytotic
  routes.
