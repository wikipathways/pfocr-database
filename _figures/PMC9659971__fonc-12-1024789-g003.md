caption: Fatty acid (FA) in the tumor microenvironment. The increase of FA exists
  in various tumor microenvironments. Tumor fibroblasts release a large of FA into
  the microenvironment, and some of the FA are absorbed by tumor cells for energy
  generation. Of course, tumor cells themselves also promote FA synthesis by increasing
  the activity of ACLY, ACC and FASN. Meanwhile, PCK1 induces FA synthesis through
  SREBP pathway, which is considered to be a specific way of tumor cells. FA produced
  by tumor cells can also be transported into the microenvironment and become part
  of the composition of exogenous FA. These exogenous FA are transported by CD36 receptors
  on the macrophages to activate FAO and promote M2-type polarization of macrophages.
  Macrophages themselves also adapt to this environment by down-regulation SIRT4 and
  RIPK3 and activating PPAR.
