caption: (A) Both LAR and Ptp69D are expressed in R7 axon terminals. Their ectodomains
  bind to distinct ligands whereas intracellular domains share a common downstream
  pathway. (B) Around 24hrAPF, R7 axons reach the R7 temporary layer, which becomes
  M6. When they fail to detect Lar ligands, however, they start to retract. While
  retracting, the terminals of R7 axons pass by the M3 layer. If they detect Ptp69D
  ligands, they stabilize at M3, but if unbound by ligands they keep retracting. The
  next layer is M0 where LAR ligands appear to also be present. Here, lower signaling
  levels, even without phosphatase activity, can stabilize axons. If axon stabilization
  fails across M0, M3, and M6, R7 axons retract to the lamina.
