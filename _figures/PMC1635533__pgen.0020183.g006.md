caption: We propose that the PMK-1 p38 MAPK pathway plays an active role in response
  to bacterial pathogens. PMK-1 controls basal levels of pathogen response genes on
  E. coli and also mediates induction of these genes upon infection. In contrast,
  DAF-16 controls a separate group of immune genes and does not mediate the infection
  response, but does turn down expression of some pathogen-induced genes. Certain
  pathogen response genes are induced independently of PMK-1 or DAF-16, indicating
  the existence of a third pathway. PMK-1 is required for the enhanced pathogen resistance
  of daf-2 mutants because it is the predominant pathway contributing to immunity.
  Finally, we suggest that PMK-1 contributes to enhanced longevity of daf-2 mutants
  because intact immune function promotes longevity.
