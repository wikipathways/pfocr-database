caption: Hypothetical common pathology of TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) proteinopathy
  and fused in sarcoma (FUS) proteinopathyNuclear import of TDP-43 is mediated by
  importin-α, importin-β, and Ran-GTPase. p35iso (which is derived from an alternate
  initiation codon) and p35f (proteolytically cleaved by caspase-3) do not have a
  nuclear localization signal (NLS) and are mislocalized to the cytoplasm. Wild-type
  FUS protein is transferred to the nucleus via transportin-1, transportin-2, and
  Ran-dependent transport machinery. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked mutants
  of FUS interfere with the interaction with transportin and lead to localization
  in the cytoplasm. Under certain pathologic stresses or aging-related nuclear leakiness,
  cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 and FUS lead to a common pathologic process,
  the formation of stress granules (SGs), or dysregulation of the RNA quality control
  system that may then be associated with motor neuron degeneration. Similar to inclusions
  in other neurodegenerative diseases, whether SGs are cytotoxic or cytoprotective
  remains unclear. An alternative pathway suggests that neuronal intranuclear inclusions
  (NIIs) may be associated with pathogenesis in some types of frontotemporal lobar
  degeneration (FTLD)-TDP and -FUS, especially Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal
  dementia (IBMPFD).
