caption: The signaling pathway of anti-PD-1 and EZH2 degradation that induces apoptosis
  in Burkitt’s lymphoma. EZH2 degrader suppresses the expression of c-MYC, a key oncogene
  in Burkitt’s lymphoma. Also, this degradation promotes the transcriptional regulation
  of PD-L1 through NF-kB and IRF-1, which regulate PD-L1 expression on the tumor cell
  surface. The anti-PD-1 inhibits the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway, effectively
  preventing the PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells from binding to PD-1 on the CD8+ T
  cell. This inhibition restores T cell activation, thereby enabling the release of
  cytotoxic molecules, such as IFN-γ and granzyme B. The increased level of granzyme
  B and EZH2 degradation activates apoptotic pathways, particularly by promoting the
  activation of caspase-3. Cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP signifies the induction
  of apoptosis. The combination of anti-PD-1 and EZH2 degradation amplifies the immune
  response while directly targeting apoptotic pathways, effectively inducing apoptosis
  in Burkitt’s lymphoma
