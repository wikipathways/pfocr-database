caption: (A) Ligand activation of PPARβ/δ potentiates colon cancer. In this model,
  PPARβ/δ is a downstream target of the APC/β-catenin/Tcf4 pathway and, through unknown
  target genes, leads to enhanced cell proliferation. COX-2-derived prostacyclin (PGI2)
  may be an endogenous ligand for PPARβ/δ in this model, and inhibition of COX2 by
  NSAIDs may prevent activation of PPARβ/δ and unknown target genes. Alternatively,
  there is also evidence that NSAIDs may inhibit PPARβ/δ expression leading to reduced
  anti-apoptotic activity mediated through ill-defined mechanisms. ?, pathways of
  uncertainty. PGIS, prostaglandin I2 synthase. (B) Ligand activation of PPARβ/δ attenuates
  colon cancer. In this model, ligand activation of PPARβ/δ leads to the induction
  of well-characterized target genes, including FABP and ADRP, that are associated
  with terminal differentiation and probably other unidentified target genes that
  participate. PPARβ/δ can also interfere with NF-κB and AP1 signalling, causing anti-inflammatory
  activities. The induction of terminal differentiation and anti-inflammatory activities
  are associated with inhibition of cell proliferation. RXRα, retinoid X receptor
