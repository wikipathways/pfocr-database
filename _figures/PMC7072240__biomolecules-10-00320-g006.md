caption: Cooperative regulation of genes involved in glutathione (GSH) and NADPH synthesis
  by Nrf2 and ATF4. Carnosic acid activates both Nrf2 and ATF4 and induces antioxidant
  genes and genes involved in amino acid synthesis/transport and GSH synthesis. The
  contributions of Nrf2 and ATF4 to the gene activation were analyzed by knockdown
  of Nrf2 or ATF4 and shown with color characters ([] and our unpublished observation).
  Induction of cystine transporter xCT and GSH synthetic enzymes (GCLC, GCLM, GSS,
  and GSR) was dependent on both Nrf2 and ATF4 (genes indicated with blue). Genes
  involved in serine synthesis (PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH), transsulfuration (CBS and
  CTH), folate cycle (SHMT2 and MTHFD2), and asparagine synthase (ASNS) and Ala/Ser/Cys/Thr
  transporter-1 and -2 (ASCT1/2) are dependent on only ATF4 and indicated with red.
  Colored genes are also up-regulated in HSA-UCP1-Tg mice [] except for ASCT1 and
  additionally include G6PD, PEPCK-C, PEPCK-M and MTHFD1 (indicted with black). G6PD
  is a rate-limiting enzyme of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that supplies NADPH
  and is known as an Nrf2 target gene []. PEPCKs may redirect TCA cycle metabolites
  to Ser synthetic pathway and are reported as ATF4-regulated genes [,]. Folate cycle
  converts Ser to Gly and up-regulation of mitochondrial SHMT2 and MTHFD2 may increase
  mitochondrial NADPH [].
