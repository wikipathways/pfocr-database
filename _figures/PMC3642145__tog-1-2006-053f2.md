  upregulated IL-5 receptor (IL-5Rα) and JAK2/STAT5 pathway may be involved in FIP1L1/PDGFRα
  induced disease development(; ; ). FIP1L1/PDGFRα may phosphorylate ERK1/2 though
  its direct signal or indirect signal such as transactivation(; ). There is a possibility
  that CCR3/ERK1/2 pathway is amplified by FIP1L1/PDGFRα+(). It is speculated that
  the integrated signaling may upregulate the expressions α4 integrin and Siglec-F
