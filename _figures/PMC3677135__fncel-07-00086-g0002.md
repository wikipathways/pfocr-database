caption: Shh and Wnts guide commissural axons in the vertebrate spinal cord. (A) Pre-crossing
  commissural axons (blue) are attracted ventrally toward the midline by an increasing
  gradient of Shh produced in the floorplate (green). The attractive effect of Shh
  is mediated by Smoothened (Smo) and Brother of CDO (Boc) in a transcription-independent
  manner. Instead, the activation of Src family kinases (SFK) induces cytoskeletal
  rearrangements in the growth cone. (B) The response of commissural axons to Shh
  switches from attraction to repulsion when axons reach the midline. Post-crossing
  commissural axons are pushed anteriorly by a posteriorhigh to anteriorlow gradient
  of Shh (red). The repellent activity of Shh is mediated by Hedgehog-interacting
  protein (Hhip), a receptor that is transiently upregulated on commissural axons
  at the time of their turning into the longitudinal axis. An additional signaling
  co-receptor may also be involved. (C) An anteriorhigh to posteriorlow gradient of
  Wnt activity works in parallel to Shh repulsion to attract post-crossing commissural
  axons anteriorly. Depending on the species, Wnt4, Wnt5a, and Wnt7a are attractants
  for post-crossing commissural axons via non-canonical pathways. In mouse, Fz3, in
  response to Wnt4/Wnt7b, activates a complex containing an atypical protein kinase
  C (aPKCζ). In response to Wnt5a, the PCP pathway is activated. See text for more
  details. (D) In chick, Shh was shown to shape Wnt activity indirectly. Wnt5a and
  Wnt7a are expressed uniformly along the longitudinal axis. In addition to its direct
  effect on post-crossing commissural axons, Shh induces the expression of the Wnt
  antagonist Sfrp1 in a posteriorhigh to anteriorlow gradient in the floorplate. The
  antagonistic activity of Sfrp in turn regulates the activity of Wnts in the floorplate,
  such that an attractive “activity gradient” of Wnt is formed. Thus, Shh (red) and
  Wnt (green) gradients collaborate to guide post-crossing commissural axons anteriorly.
