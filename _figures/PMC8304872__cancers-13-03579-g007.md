caption: 'Graphical summary of involved mechanisms in TQ-induced cell death. TQ promotes
  both apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death modalities: an early and critical role
  of necroptosis and cytosolic calcium. Non-apoptotic cell death involving necroptosis
  signaling is the most critical cell killing mechanism underlying TQ-cytotoxicity.
  Necroptotic features appear early after TQ treatment as evidenced by an early increase
  in cytosolic calcium and latterly by extracellular release of HMGB1. Both BAPTA-AM,
  a cytosolic calcium chelator, and nec-1, a RIPK1 inhibitor, reversed TQ-induced
  non-apoptotic cell death. Cytosolic calcium increase during TQ treatment involves
  activation of SOCE after ER-calcium depletion, which also leads to ER stress as
  manifested by increase of GRP78, HSPA1A, and sXBP1; BTP-10 and ML-9, inhibitors
  of STIM1 and ORAI, respectively, blocked SOCE. Promotion of SOCE occurs more likely
  downstream to necroptosis initiation and is potentially mediated by TRMP7; nec-1
  reduced TQ-induced SOCE. Apoptotic effect of TQ occurs through the intrinsic pathway
  as highlighted by cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and caspase-9/3 activations
  leading to PARP cleavage and potentially to DNA damage after DNA fragmentation by
  ICAD activated in turn by active caspase-3. The pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk
  blocked caspase activity, but failed to reverse the cell death in most cells except
  the less sensitive cells. DNA damage and ER stress and their upstream inducers cooperate
  to TQ-induced cell cycle arrest.'
