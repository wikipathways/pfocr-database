caption: The waves of MALT1 activation. MALT1 is recruited into CARD/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM)
  complexes after stimulation of antigen receptors or under chronic stimulatory conditions
  resulting from mutations in signaling components of the pathway, for example, gain-of-function
  (GoF) mutations in CARD11. CBM assembly triggers MALT1 paracaspase activity. MALT1
  cleaves several substrates including BCL10. MALT1 can also auto-cleave, particularly
  at R149, which is promoted by TRAF6. This process represents a feed-forward mechanism
  that releases a highly functional MALT1 species. MALT1 auto proteolysis, and cleavage
  of BCL10 by MALT1 may contribute to downregulation of the pathway.
