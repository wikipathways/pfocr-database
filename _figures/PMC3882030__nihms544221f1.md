caption: Localization of hypoxia and mechanism of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilization.
  (a) Tissue sections from healthy control or trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)
  colitis were examined for localization of the 2-nitroimidazole compound 2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,-pentafluoropropyl)
  acetamide (EF5) (red). Nuclear counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
  (DAPI) is shown in blue. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of an adjacent section is
  shown for orientation. (b) General features of HIF. Overlapping functions of HIF-1α
  and HIF-2α include the regulation of tissue development, vascular angiogenesis,
  cell proliferation, and multiple inflammation targets and genes that promote or
  suppress tumorigenesis. Specific target genes for HIF-1α include those genes involved
  primarily in metabolism, including genes within the glycolytic pathways. HIF-2α-specific
  targets include erythropoietin and gene targets involved in duodenal iron transport.
  (c) The biochemical pathway of HIF hydroxylation by the combination of α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG), molecular oxygen (O2), and the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes in normoxia.
  When O2 or prolyl hydroxylation becomes limiting (due to hypoxia or PHD inhibition),
  the HIF-1α subunit and/or HIF-2α subunit stabilize and bind to the HIF-1β subunit
  within the nucleus, where the dimer becomes transcriptionally active upon binding
  to the hypoxia-response element (HRE) DNA consensus sequence.
