caption: Tumor-intrinsic molecular mechanisms of immune suppression driven by specific
  oncogenic events. Selected examples are depicted based on mechanistic studies on
  animal models. Of note, co-occurring oncogenic events affect immune suppressive
  mechanisms, thus increasing immune heterogeneity between cancer cases. Additional
  mechanisms linked to each example have also been described but could not be included
  in this diagram due to space constraints. A, MYC has been shown to promote T-cell
  and natural killer (NK) cell exclusion, and infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages
  (TAMs), while also directly inhibiting T-cells and phagocytic macrophages via upregulation
  of PD-L1 and CD47. B, Mutant KRas has been shown to promote recruitment of myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the TME through upregulation of CXCL3. C, Mutant EGFR
  has been shown to up-regulate PD-L1 in tumor cells and to induce recruitment of
  TAMs and MDSCs. D, Loss of PTEN is associated with increased production of immune
  suppressive cytokines, which promote the establishment of an immune suppressive
  tumor microenvironment (TME) and inhibit T-cell infiltration. E, β-Catenin has been
  shown to inhibit secretion of CCL4 by tumor cells, hence preventing activation of
  CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) and subsequent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation.
  F, Loss of LKB1 down-regulates the STING pathway in tumor cells, thereby preventing
  release of type I IFNs in response to cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which
  would otherwise stimulate immune response. G, STAT3 signaling in tumor cells induces
  upregulation of multiple cytokines that contribute to the establishment of an immune
  suppressive TME by stimulating suppressive immune cells and inhibiting effector
  cells. H, Dysregulated NOTCH promotes an immune suppressive TME via multiple anti-inflammatory
  cytokines. I, FAK has been shown to stimulate regulatory T-cells (TRegs) by upregulating
  numerous cytokines.
