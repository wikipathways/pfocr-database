caption: Schematic depicting the canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling systems
  coupled to EMT in MECs. Transmembrane signaling by TGF-β ensues through its binding
  and activation of the Ser/Thr protein kinase receptors, TβR-I and TβR-II. Indeed,
  TGF-β binding to either TβR-III or TβR-II enables the recruitment and transphosphorylation
  of TβR-I, resulting its activation and subsequent phosphorylation the receptor-activated
  Smads, Smad2 and Smad3. Once activated, Smad2/3 form heterocomplexes with common
  the Smad, Smad4, which collectively translocate en masse to the nucleus to regulate
  the expression of TGF-β-responsive genes in concert with an ever expanding list
  of transcriptional coactivators and repressors. This branch of the bifurcated TGF-β
  signaling system represents the “canonical” or “Smad2/3-dependent” TGF-β pathway
  (left). Alternatively, TGF-β also activates a variety of “noncanonical” or “Smad2/3-independent”
  effectors, including Par6, NF-κB, ILK, FAK, Src, a variety of small GTPases, members
  of the MAP kinase family (e.g., ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK), and the PI3K:AKT:mTOR
  signaling axis (right). Activation of members of the Snail, ZEB, or bHLH family
  of transcription factors promote EMT by transcriptionally repressing the production
  of E-cadherin transcripts (bottom). Imbalances between canonical and noncanonical
  TGF-β signaling pathways have recently been identified and established as casual
  aberrancies underlying the initiation of oncogenic TGF-β signaling and its initiation
  of EMT in normal and malignant MECs. See text for details.
