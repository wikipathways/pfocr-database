caption: Proposed activation pathway and domain structure of Nrf1. (A) (1) Full length
  Nrf1 is glycosylated in the ER lumen (Pro-Nrf1) and subsequently retrotranslocated
  to the cytosol by VCP/p97. (2) ER membrane-bound Pro-Nrf1 is de-N-glycosylated by
  NGLY1. (3) The protease DDI2 cleaves Nrf1 between W103 and L104 and releases the
  active p95 form into the cytosol. (4) Nrf1 is immediately degraded by the proteasome
  and thus maintained at low levels in the cell. (5) In cells with insufficient proteasome
  capacity due to chemical inhibition or an overload of misfolded proteins, active
  Nrf1 accumulates and migrates to the nucleus, where it heterodimerizes with cofactors
  (small Maf proteins), binds to chromosomal targets, and activates the synthesis
  of PSMs. (B) Domain structure of Nrf1 with ER transmembrane domain, site of DDI2
  proteolysis, and possible N-glycosylation sites labeled in red. The N-terminal domain
  (NTD) contains the transmembrane sequence that anchors Nrf1 within the ER membrane
  and the proteolytic cleavage site for DDI2 between W103 and L104. The transactivation
  domain (TAD) comprises the two acidic domains (AD1, AD2) and the Asn/Ser/Thr-rich
  region (NST) with eight predicted N-glycosylation sites (orange). The serine-rich
  region (SR) was found to be multiply O-GlcNAcylated, and its glycosylation status
  dictates the ubiquitination of the transcription factor. The Nrf2-ECH homology 6-like
  domain (Neh6L) is conserved in two relatives of Nrf1, Nrf2 and Nrf3. The DNA binding
  domain comprises the cap ’n’ collar (CNC) and the basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP),
  which enable heterodimerization with Maf proteins before binding to the DNA. The
  C-terminal domain (CTD) also contributes to transcription factor activity.
