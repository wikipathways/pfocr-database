caption: 'Model of glucocorticoid (GC) actions in the airways epithelium. Simplified
  (A) and detailed (B) model of PPAR-mediated anti-inflammatory actions of GC in lung
  epithelial cells. Following activation by allergens, TLRs activate the type 1 interferon
  pathway. Interferons induce the expression of inflammatory genes mediated by phosphorylated
  STAT1 and IRF9 transcription factors. GC treatment represses the interferon pathway
  via two potential mechanisms. First, upregulation (orange boxes) of RXRA and PPARGC1A
  enhances the activity of the PPAR pathway, which inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation,
  repressing interferon signaling. Secondly, down-regulation (blue boxes) of STAT1
  and IRF9, reduces the amount of the transcriptional complex responsible for interferon-regulated
  gene expression. Clear arrowheads indicate phosphorylation. Solid arrowheads indicate
  activation. A dashed line represents transcriptional regulation (arrow: activation;
  T: repression).'
