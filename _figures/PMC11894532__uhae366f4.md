  figure illustrates the roles of various flavonoids in enhancing the cold resistance
  of horticultural plants. In tomatoes, flavonols such as quercetin and kaempferol
  are synthesized in response to cold stress, playing a crucial role in scavenging
  ROS, thus enhancing antioxidant activity and photosynthetic efficiency. In strawberries,
  the synthesis of flavonoids under cold stress is regulated by genes such as anthocyanidin
  synthase (ANS), MYB transcription factors (MYB1, MYB10), and UDP-glucose: flavonoid
  3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT). These flavonoids enhance the plant’s antioxidant
  capacity and membrane stability, ensuring better survival under cold conditions.
  In soybeans, cold stress activates isoflavone biosynthetic pathways involving genes
  such as IMaT1 and IMaT3. Isoflavones improve the activity of antioxidant enzymes
  like CAT and SOD and increase the accumulation of isoflavone 7-O-glucoside, contributing
  to enhanced stress tolerance. In blueberries, cold stress induces the expression
  of early (EBGs) and late (LBGs) flavonoid biosynthetic genes, leading to the accumulation
  of anthocyanins. These compounds enhance the antioxidant enzyme system and reduce
  MDA levels, thereby protecting the plant from oxidative damage. IMaT1, Invasive
