caption: Generations of CAR T-cells. The first-generation CAR T-cells consisted of
  an intracellular CD3 ζ- chain or FcϵRIγ domain. However, first-generation CAR T-cells
  did not generate sufficient IL-2 and exogenous IL-2 supplementation was required.
  In the second- generation, additional signaling domains comprised of T-cell cytokine
  and costimulatory receptors CAR T-cells were included in the design. Co-stimulatory
  domains promote IL-2 synthesis to enhance T-cell activation and reduce apoptosis.
  Third-generation CAR T-cells contain an antigen recognition domain, hinge, membrane-spanning
  region and a cytoplasmic domain. Third-generation CAR T-cells consist of two co-stimulatory
  signaling units, e.g., CD28 (B7), CD137 (4-1BB), CD134, (OX40), DAP10, as well as
  a CD3ζ or FcϵRIγ domain. Third-generation CARs promote cytokine secretion to increase
  T-cell proliferation and survival. Fourth-generation CARs T-cells (TRUCKs) store
  transgenic cytokine and release it when induced to attract innate immune cells.
  Some constructs also incorporate a suicide gene, e.g., Caspase-9, to rapidly withdraw
  CAR T-cells once anti-tumor effects are reached. Two examples of newly emerging
  fifth (next)-generation CAR T cells are shown. Next-generation (fifth-generation)
  CAR T-cells integrate CAR transgenes into the TCR-α constant (TRAC) locus. CAR can
  be directed to the TRAC locus, resulting in uniform CAR expression, reduced tonic
  signaling, decreased exhaustion and increased antitumor efficacy and gives the added
  benefit of producing a potential universal product. To induce JAK-STAT pathway activation
  in CAR-T cells in an antigen-dependent manner, the full-length or truncated cytoplasmic
  domain of a membrane receptor, e.g., IL-2 receptor-β can be incorporated between
  the cytoplasmic domains of CD28 and CD3z. The cytokine receptor domain triggers
  JAK/STAT signaling to promote proliferative capacity and functional activity.
