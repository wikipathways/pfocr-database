caption: Molecular mechanisms activated in 3D culture systems. (A) 3D cultures of
  cervical cancer cells result in paclitaxel and doxorubicin chemoresistance through
  increased proliferation rate and overexpression of MMP-2 and 9. Zataria essential
  oil treatment inhibits cell proliferation in 3D cultures and induces apoptosis through
  activation of caspase 3. (B) 3D culture systems in ovarian cancer. The Multicellular
  Tumor Spheroids (MCTS) allow testing of drug and photodynamic therapies. The co-culture
  of MCTS with stromal cells and macrophages in combination with hydrogels as scaffold,
  allow to mimic the tumor microenvironment providing a model to test adhesion, invasion,
  proliferation processes as well as drug response. (C) 3D cultures systems in endometrial
  cancer. Doxorubicin treatment induces chemoresistance through activation of the
  MAPK pathway. Moreover, 3D cultures of endometrial cancer co-cultured with fibroblasts
  promote invasion through overexpression of MMPs. (D) 3D cultures systems in breast
  cancer. Spheroids of breast cancer cells exhibit cell-cell and extracellular cell-matrix
  interactions promoting drug resistance. Cisplatin treatment promotes cell cycle
  progression and cellular senescence through up-regulation of trans-lesion DNA polymerase
  (TLS) expression and activation of the ATR-Chk1 pathway. Trastuzumab treatment induces
  resistance in 3D cultures through inhibition of PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK pathways,
  in addition to an increase in stem cells subpopulations.
