caption: Schematic figure showing that melatonin attenuates mechanical trauma-induced
  hepatic injury by inhibiting IP3R1-mediated MAMs formation via activating the melatonin
  receptor-ERK1/2-FoxO1 pathway. Melatonin binds to melatonin receptor and induces
  the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 that subsequently interacts with FoxO1 and induces
  the phosphorylation and inactivation of the FoxO1. Inactivated FoxO1 reduced FoxO1
  binding to the IP3R1 promoter to inhibit IP3R1-mediated MAMs. Subsequently, melatonin-induced
  downregulation of IP3R1 inhibits MAMs formation and Ca2+ overload, and mitigates
  mitochondrial dysfunction and mechanical trauma-induced hepatic injury
