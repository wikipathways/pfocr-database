caption: (A) Anti-phosphotyrosine (pY) immunoblot of samples used for mass spectrometry
  analysis. Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and associated proteins were pulled-down
  with mAb 4G10 (pY) or isotype control IgG2b mAb MOPC141 (C) from lysates of primary
  NK cells stimulated on plates for 20 min with BSA only (–), ICAM-1, and human IgG1,
  as indicated. Samples were eluted with sodium phenyl phosphate, run on SDS-PAGE,
  and immunoblotted with mAb 4G10. (B) Venn diagram of the number of proteins identified
  by mass spectrometry in the samples stimulated with ICAM-1 or human IgG1, after
  subtraction of proteins in the control samples. Selection criteria are described
  in . (C) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, http://www.ingenuity.com) of the proteins
  identified in the sample stimulated with ICAM-1 (). The intensity of the red color
  indicates the score from mass spectrometry analysis. (D) Network analysis of the
  23 proteins in the sample stimulated with ICAM-1 that had higher scores than the
  sample stimulated with human IgG1 ().
