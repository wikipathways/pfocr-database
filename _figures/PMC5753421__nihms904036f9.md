caption: A model for the induction of chick retina regeneration by NAC. Arrows in
  yellow represent the different roles of the antioxidant NAC. Arrows in red represent
  the different molecules that feed into the specific roles of NAC. When the GSH synthesis
  role of NAC was tested through the use of specific inhibitors, regeneration still
  occurred. The use of another N-acetyl amino acid, N-acetylglycine (NAG), which can
  feed into the GSH synthesis pathway, did not result in regeneration. When different
  molecules that can scavenge ROS were used, no regeneration occurred. In addition,
  N-acetylserine (NAS) which is similar in structure to NAC but lacks the thiol group
  in carbon 3, and instead has a hydroxyl group, was unable to induce regeneration.
  Our data suggests that NAC’s thiol group is essential for the activation of Erk
  and subsequent induction of retina regeneration.
