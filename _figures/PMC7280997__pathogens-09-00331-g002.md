caption: The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in the host cells. The S glycoproteins of the
  virion bind to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and
  enters target cells through an endosomal pathway. Following the entry of the virus
  into the host cell, the viral RNA is unveiled in the cytoplasm. ORF1a and ORF1ab
  are translated to produce pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins, which are cleaved by the
  proteases of the RTC. During replication, RTC drives the production full length
  (−) RNA copies of the genome and used as templates for full-length (+) RNA genomes.
  During transcription, a nested set of sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs), is produced in
  a manner of discontinuous transcription (fragmented transcription). Even though
  these sgRNAs may have several open reading frames (ORFs), only the closest ORF (to
  the 5′ end) will be translated. Following the production of SARS-CoV-2 structural
  proteins, nucleocapsids are assembled in the cytoplasm and followed by budding into
  the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi intermediate compartment. Virions
  are then released from the infected cell through exocytosis (figure created with
