caption: 'When tumor cell is inflicted with ionizing radiation, the double strands
  of DNA are broken and the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway is further initiated.
  This pathway contains three major components: sensors, transducers and effectors.
  H2AX, MDC1, 53BP1 and MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex act as the core sensors and could
  directly bind to the damaged ends of DNA fragments to start the beginning of DDR.
  At the level of transducers, ATM and ATR are proximal kinases in the central of
  the entire DDR and could recruit multiple downstream effectors, including DNA-PK,
  Ku70/80, BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, RAD52, in order to complete two types of DNA damage
  repair (NHEJ and HR) processes. Meanwhile, ATM and ATR can separately interplay
  with Chk2 and Chk1, and activate other cell cycle regulators like CDC25, CDK, p53,
  p21, so as to disturb the function of cell cycle checkpoint and interfere with the
  G1/S and G2/M phase progression.'
