caption: 'Possible mechanisms of NLRP3-inflammasome activation in podocytes and mononuclear
  phagocytes (A) and mononuclear phagocytes (B). (A): DAMPs and pro-inflammatory cytokines
  can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via the NFκ-B signaling pathway. The increasing
  of NLRP3 transcriptions by NFκ-B induces the NLRP3-inflammasome activation. The
  NLRP3 inflammasome cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 by caspase 1. These cytokines
  may cause kidney damage through an induction of inflammation and polarization of
  Th17 cells. IL-18 can also induce the formation of NETs by neutrophils, increasing
  stimuli by DAMPS. (B): A second signal provided by K+ efflux and Ca2+ flux mediated
  by P2X7 receptor induces Ros formation, enabling NLRP3-inflammasome activation.
  Similarly, necrosis and fibrosis promoted by NLRP3-inflammasome activation induce
  Ros formation through RIP3. These mechanisms together with the formation of TGF-β
  appear to contribute to kidney damage in LN. NLRP3: NLR pyrin domain-containing-3;
  TLR: Toll-like receptor; Myd88: Myeloid differentiation factor 88; TRAF-6: TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6; DAMPs: Damage-associated molecular patterns; IRAK-1: Interleukin 1 receptor-associated
