caption: 'Complement system. The complement system can be activated through 3 different
  pathways: the classical pathway (CP), the lectin pathway (LP), and the alternative
  pathway (AP). The CP is activated by antigen‐antibody complexes binding to C1q,
  and the LP is activated by binding of mannose‐residues on pathogens to mannose binding
  lectin (MBL). Activation of either the CP or the LP cleaves C4, which leads to downstream
  activation of C3. The AP is continuously activated due to spontaneous C3 hydrolysis,
  although only on low levels due to deactivation by complement regulators. However,
  when activated by external stimuli such as pathogens or surface molecules, AP activation
  is stabilized by factor properdin (P), which leads to downstream activation of C3.
  All 3 activation pathways signal through C3, which is cleaved into C3a and C3b.
  C3b splits C5 into C5a and C5b, and subsequent generation of the membrane attack
  complex (MAC) C5b‐9. The MAC is the end result of complement activation, forming
  a pore in the cell membrane which induces cell lysis. Split products C3a and C5a
  are anaphylatoxins, which further stimulate the inflammatory response'
