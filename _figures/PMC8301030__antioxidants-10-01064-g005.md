caption: Proposed mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of genistein against
  neuropathological insults of Alzheimer’s disease. In the amyloidogenic pathway,
  cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases produces Aβ peptides,
  whereas in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, cleavage of APP by α- and γ-secretases
  provoke the formation of p3 and APP intracellular domain (AICD). Protein kinase
  C (PKC) signaling pathway including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), activated by genistein,
  activates the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP cleavage by increasing α-secretase
  activity. In the amyloidogenic pathway, genistein inhibits the formation of Aβ peptides
  by decreasing γ-secretase. Further, genistein reduces Tau-mediated pathology by
  decreasing intracellular calcium concentrations, inhibiting oxidative stress-mediated
  neuronal damage and death by inhibiting the reactive oxygen species (ROS) released
  from mitochondria and promoting autophagic clearance of aggregate-prone proteins
  []. Figure adapted from Uddin and Kabir [].
