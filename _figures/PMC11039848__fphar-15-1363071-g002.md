caption: 'Bile acid synthesis pathway. In the classical synthetic pathway, Cytochrome
  P450 Family 7 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP7A1) is the first step and the major rate-limiting
  enzyme in the classical pathway catalysing bile acid synthesis, followed by generation
  of cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) by Cytochrome P450 Family 8
  Subfamily B Member 1 (CYP8B1) and Cytochrome P450 Family 27 Subfamily A Member 1
  (CYP27A1) enzymes, with the classical pathway accounting for 90% of bile acid synthesis.
  In the alternative pathway, cholesterol is catalysed by CYP27A1 and CYP78B1 to produce
  CDCA-based bile acids, and the generated CA and CDCA are then modified by bile acid-CoA
  synthetase (BACS) and bile acid Coenzyme A: amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT),
  and then enter the intestinal tract along with the bile in the form of conjugated
  bile acids, and in the intestinal tract by bile salt hydrolase (BSH), Hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase (HSDH) to become deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic
  acid (UDCA) and other secondary bile acids, and then eliminated from the body.'
