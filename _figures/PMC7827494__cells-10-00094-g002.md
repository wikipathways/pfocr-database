caption: Notch crosstalk with other signaling pathways. Activation of Notch receptors
  by ligand-presenting cells results in the release of the Notch intracellular domain
  (NICD), forming a transcriptional activator complex with CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless,
  Lag-1 (CSL) and mastermind-like protein 1 (MAML). It also interacts with other signaling
  pathways, for example, by binding to β-catenin and inducing its degradation. The
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway is involved in cell cycle regulation. NICD also interacts
  with hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1a) during hypoxia enhancing HIF1a transactivating
  activity. Likewise, SMAD transcription factors, which are activated downstream the
  TGFR and BMP pathways, also interact with NICD/CSL complex. Interactions with additional
  pathways include communication with Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), where binding to Patched
  (Ptch) results in the release of Smoothened (Smo) and activation of a cascade of
  signaling centered in Gli. Hes1, a downstream target of Notch, represses GLI, while
  Gli activation by Smo triggers downstream genes such as HES1 and other stemness
  genes. Gene symbols used according to Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37
  (GRCh37).
