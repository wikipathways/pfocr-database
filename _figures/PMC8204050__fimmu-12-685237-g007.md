caption: DMRs DEGs and DE miRNA targets intersect at the AMPK signaling pathway. Genes
  that were differentially methylated, differentially expressed, or targeted by candidate
  miRNAs were subjected to functional enrichment KEGG analysis. These genes were most
  significantly associated with the AMPK signaling pathway. Genes which are only differentially
  methylated are highlighted in cyan. Genes which are only differentially expressed
  are highlighted in red. Genes which are differentially methylated, differentially
  expressed, and regulated by one or more miRNA are highlighted in purple. Light green
  boxes represent other pathway genes that were not found to be significantly in our
  studies.
