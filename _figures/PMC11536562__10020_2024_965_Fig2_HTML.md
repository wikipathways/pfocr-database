caption: α-KG homeostasis and m6A regulation. In normal conditions, IDH converts isocitric
  acid to α-KG, which is a cofactor of TET2 demethylase and m6A eraser FTO. Active
  TET2 participates in DNA demethylation and gene activation. IDH1 R132H and IDH2
  R172K mutations produce the 2HG oncometabolite instead of α-KG, which inhibits TET2
  and leads to hypermethylated DNA resulting in the downregulation of tumor suppressor
  gene expression. 2HG production also leads to FTO inactivation resulting in the
  accumulation of m6A modification on oncogenic mRNAs, promoting their degradation
  and displaying anti-leukemia potential. In short, 2HG can exhibit both pro-leukemia
  and anti-leukemia effects through activating distinct pathways
