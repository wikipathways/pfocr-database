caption: (A) In the absence of NF1, MAF expression is suppressed through a RAS/MAPK/AP-1
  pathway. The transient effects of high MAF re-expression include an increase in
  cell death and decreases in SOX9, proliferation, and anchorage independent growth.
  (B) MAF also regulates DEPTOR, which negatively regulates TORC1 activity. TORC1
  activity can be read-out by the activity of its substrates, such as the phosphorylation
  of S6 by S6K. In turn, S6K activity causes negative feedback resulting in the decreased
  phosphorylation of AKT. Our studies suggest that sustained lower levels of MAF expression
  in vivo increase TORC1 activity and enhance tumor growth. This enhanced TORC1 signaling
  renders tumors vulnerable to TORC1 inhibition with RAD001.
