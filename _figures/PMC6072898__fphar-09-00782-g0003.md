caption: 'Mechanistic aspects of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action of berberine.
  It can be divided into three parts: Firstly, the downregulated NADPH oxidase expression
  and upregulated UCP and SOD could be involved in the berberine-induced suppression
  of oxidative stress that is likely controlled by the SIRT1/FOXO or AMPK pathways.
  Secondly, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action of berberine involves the
  activation of Nrf2 pathway, which further depends on the activated P38, AMPK and
  P13K/Akt signaling pathways. Finally, the inflammation is inhibited by berberine
  through the suppressed MAPK, Rho GTPase, NF-κB, and AP-1 pathways. The molecules
  and the pathways involved in the antioxidant activity of berberine are shown by
  the squared boxes/lines, while double squared boxes/dotted lines represent molecular
  species and pathways engaged in the anti-inflammatory activity. Additionally, the
  molecules and pathways shared by both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities
  of berberine are indicated by the encircled boxes. The pathways and the mechanisms
  that necessitate further investigations are shown by the curved bold lines. Berberine
  could terminate the malicious association between oxidative stress and inflammation.'
