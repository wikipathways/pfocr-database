caption: Schematic diagram of the main transport pathways activated in red blood cells
  (RBCs) from sickle cell patients. In RBCs from homozygous HbSS individuals, high
  cation permeability is accounted for by three main pathways [, ]. Under oxygenated
  conditions, the KCl cotransporter (KCC) is highly active. It is overexpressed in
  HbSS cells compared to HbAA ones and does not become quiescent as RBCs mature. It
  is stimulated further by low pH (reduction in extracelluar pH from 7.4 to 7). Under
  deoxygenated conditions, KCC remains active—again unlike the situation in HbAA RBCs
  []. In addition, two other pathways are observed. The deoxygenation-induced cation
  conductance (or P sickle) is activated as HbS polymerises. It mediates entry of
  Ca2+. Elevation in intracellular Ca2+ then leads to activation of the third pathway,
  the Ca2+-activated K+ channel, or Gardos channel. These three pathways result in
  solute loss, cell shrinkage and dehydration, and consequent increase in [HbS]. They
  thereby contribute to pathogenesis of sickle cell disease. They are also likely
  to be involved in solute loss from RBCs of patients heterozygous for HbS and HbC
  (HbSC genotype), though details are lacking and differences in their behaviour compared
  to that in HbSS cells are expected.
