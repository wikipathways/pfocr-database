caption: 'Blue fill indicates genes which are part of the Positive Regulation of Cytokine
  Production pathway, and red fill indicates genes which are part of the Regulation
  of T Cell Differentiation pathway as defined by GO Biological processes. Border
  colors denote the mode of gene-mapping: green (regulatory), blue (exonic), aqua
  (regulatory+exonic), red (eQTL PBMC), tan (regulatory+eQTL PBMC). No border color
  indicates the gene was a link added by StringDB.'
