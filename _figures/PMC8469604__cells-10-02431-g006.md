caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating oxidative stress response mediated by FTH1
  downregulation in hESCs. FTH1 (1) is the master scavenger molecule for intracellular
  iron homeostasis and its inactivation leads to imbalanced redox homeostasis due
  to intracellular iron accumulation (2) and ROS production (3). Surprisingly, in
  hESCs, a reduced expression of FTH1 expression is not associated with oxidative
  stress and ROS production. This phenomenon can be explained by three crucial findings:
  first, FTH1-silenced hESCs showed an enhanced transcriptional activity of Nrf2 (4–5)
  on key antioxidant target genes such as HIF-1, HMOX-1, NQO-1, GPX2/3/4, SOD1/2,
  FTL (6); second, we observed the activation of an alternative metabolic program
  from glycolysis (7–8) to pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) where the activity of the
  G6PD enzyme ensures the conversion of NADP+ to NADPH (9) involved in ROS neutralization;
  third, the mitochondrial metabolism was found to be inactive (10) in FTH1-silenced
  hESCs, as demonstrated by the upregulation of PDK1 and UCP2 genes (11), specifically
  involved in preventing pyruvate from entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
  (12).'
