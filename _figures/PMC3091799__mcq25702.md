caption: Schematic representation of endoreduplication cycle control in plants. The
  arrest of mitotic activity in endoreduplicating tissues originates from the inactivation
  of the mitotic CDKB1/CYCA2;3 complex (proposed as being the mitosis inducing factor,
  MIF). This inactivation may be achieved by fixation of a CDK inhibitor (KRP) and
  subsequent release of the cyclin moiety that is degraded by the APCCCS52A/26S proteasome
  pathway. During the endocycle, an active CDKA/CYCD complex associates and phosphorylates
  the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). The G → S transition occurs due to the release
  of the E2F transcription factor which is necessary for the transcription of S-phase-related
  genes, in particular the A-type cyclins (CYCA). At the G → S transition, the CDKA/CYCD
  complex is likely to be inhibited by KRP; CYCD is then degraded and CDKA can now
  associate with S-phase cyclins. In early S, the induced CYCA3;1 associates with
  CDKA in a complex that is necessary for the progression throughout the S phase.
  At the end of the S phase, CYCA3;1 is degraded by the APCCCS52A/26S proteasome pathway;
  CDKA is then released and available for a new round of the endoreduplication cycle.
  In early G, CDKA is inactivated by the inhibitory phosphorylation mediated by WEE1
  as to allow a proper cell growth prior to commit to another round of DNA synthesis.
