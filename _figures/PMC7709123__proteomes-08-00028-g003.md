caption: Influence of SCFAs on the relative abundance of enzymes required for the
  conversion of pyruvate to branched-chain amino acids in P. bryantii B14. This pathway
  is based on the KEGG pathway (ko00290). Grey boxes indicate the mean relative abundance
  (n = 3) of the enzymes (including EC numbers close to the arrows) and their detected
  subunits or copies, as shown by their Uniprot IDs. The color code on the right side
  displays fold change with respect to the Acet condition, which is set to one. Dotted
  arrow illustrates an undetected enzyme.
