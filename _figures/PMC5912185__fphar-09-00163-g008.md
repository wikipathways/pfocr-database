caption: Mimetic diagram of STK899704 efficacy pathway in A549 cells. STK899704 induces
  cell cycle arrest and senescence through a p53-associated pathway. STK899704 can
  induce tubulin aggregation, suffering DNA damage and p53 is activated. Mitosis arrest
  is induced by p53 and followed by cellular senescence.
