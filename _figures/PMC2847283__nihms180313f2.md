caption: 'Saturated FFAs accumulate in the ER, which leads to disturbance of ER function
  and induction of an ERstress response, mediated by the phosphorylation and activation
  of two ER-resident kinases, IRE1α and PERK. Phosphorylated IRE1α activates an apoptotic
  pathway involving JNK activation. Active JNK phosphorylates the transcription factor
  c-Jun, which leads to the transcriptional upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only
  protein, PUMA. Activation of PERK results in the induction of the transcription
  factor CHOP, which upregulates the expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein,
  Bim. Bim, in concert with PUMA, activates the proapoptotic executioner protein,
  Bax, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of effector caspases
  and apoptosis. CHOP can further upregulate the expression of death receptors, such
  as death receptor 5, which sensitize fatty hepatocytes to circulating death ligands
  (e.g., TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand).CHOP: CCAAT/enhancer-binding homologous
  protein; ER: Endoplasmic reticulum; IRE: Inositol-requiring enzyme; FFA: Free fatty
  acid; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; P: Phosphate; PERK: PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum
  kinase; PUFA: Polyunsaturated fatty acid; PUMA: p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis.'
