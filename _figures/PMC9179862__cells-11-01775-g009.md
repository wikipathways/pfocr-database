caption: Summary of protein interactions from CXCL12 signaling to PKM2. CXCL12 binding
  to CXCR4 or ACKR3 triggers the recruitment of β-arrestin 2 and endocytosis of the
  receptor. ERK2 interacts with β-arrestin 2 and PKM2. PKM2 subsequently dissociates
  from β-arrestin 2 with PKM2, showing reduced oligomerization. We measure shifts
  from PKM2 tetramers to dimers and monomers from reduced complementation signal for
  PKM2 oligomers but do not directly quantify abundance of each species associated
  with or released from β-arrestin 2. We propose that dissociation from β-arrestin
  2 and decreased oligomerization of PKM2 contribute to observed increases in metabolites
  in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, driven by CXCL12. Created with
