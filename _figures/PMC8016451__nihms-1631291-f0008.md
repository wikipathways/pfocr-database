caption: In hepatocytes, Rspo1/3 bind to their receptor LGR4 to promote phosphorylate
  of AMPKα. The activated AMPKα will further restrain the expression and nuclear translocation
  of SREBP2, therefore, downregulate transcription of genes related to cholesterol
  uptake and synthesis, including Ldlr, Hmgcs1 and Hmgcr.
