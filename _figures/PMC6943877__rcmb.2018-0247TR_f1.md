caption: Overview of pattern recognition receptors and inflammasome sensing mechanism
  during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. IAV infects cells by binding of the virion
  surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin to sialic acid that is expressed by a cell surface
  receptor and then is endocytosed. The viral hemagglutinin fuses with the endosomal
  membrane; the virion particle unravels; and the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm.
  TLR3 and TLR7 sense viral double-stranded RNA and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), respectively,
  within the endosome, whereas retinoic acid–inducible gene 1–like receptors (RIG-I
  and MDA5) recognize cytosolic ssRNA or viral RNA containing 5′-triphosphate. Via
  their C-terminal caspase-recruitment domains, RIG-I and MDA5 attach to the signaling
  adaptor protein (MAVS, found in the mitochondria), causing activation of IRFs and
  NF-κB and transcription of proforms of IL-1β, IL-18, caspase 1, and the types I
  and III IFNs. As a result of IRF and NF-κB activation (also acting as signal 1 of
  the inflammasome pathway), other components essential to formation of the inflammasome
  complex, such as ASC and NLRP3, are upregulated. NLRP3 forms one of the inflammasome
  second signal receptors, and when activated (e.g., when sensing ssRNA from IAV and
  IAV-associated DAMPs), it nucleates ASC, which bridges the inflammasome sensor to
  oligomerize pro–caspase 1, causing caspase 1 activation. Active caspase 1 cleaves
  the pro–IL-1β and pro–IL-18 proteins, generating the biologically active cytokines
  IL-1β and IL-18. ASC = apoptotic speck protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment
  domain; DAMPs = damage-associated molecular patterns; IFNAR = IFN-αβ receptor; IRF3/7 = IFN-regulatory
  factor 3/7; ISGs = IFN-stimulated genes; MAVS = mitochondrial antiviral signaling
  protein; MDA5 = melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; MyD88 = myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88; NLR = nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor;
  NLRP3 = NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3; RIG-I = retinoic acid-inducible
  gene 1; STAT1/2 = signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/2; TLR = Toll-like
  receptor; TRIF = Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-β. Adapted
