caption: Diagram depicting the current model for the regulation of NIS functional
  residency at the PM by the SRC/RAC1/PIP5K/PAK/EZRIN/NIS pathway. In brief, NIS localization
  and function at the PM depends on its binding to SRC kinase, the activity of which,
  triggered by yet-unknown factors, leads to the recruitment and activation of the
  small GTPase RAC1. RAC1 signals not through p38 nor through JNK (two kinases downstream
  of RAC1 known to participate in the transcriptional regulation of NIS [,]), but
  through PAK1 and PIP5K. The combined activity of these kinases promotes ARP2/3-mediated
  actin polymerization, and the recruitment and binding of the actin anchoring protein
  EZRIN to NIS, promoting its residency and function at the PM of normal and TC cells.
