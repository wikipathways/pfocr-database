caption: 'Signaling pathways employed by CSCs: Distinct combinations of paracrine
  and juxtracrine signals induce the EMT in different contexts. A representation of
  signaling pathways that CSCs have been reported to depend on is shown here. The
  transcription factors that are downstream of these signaling pathways act as co-factors
  and cooperate with the EMT-inducing transcription factors such as Snail to induce
  and maintain the mesenchymal/CSC state. The EMT program also activate several positive,
  self-reinforcing feedback loops in order to maintain cells in a mesenchymal/CSC
  state; shown here are three involving canonical and non-canonical Wnts as well as
  TGF-β. Nodes of the pathway that could be open to therapeutic targeting are indicated
  by red arrowheads.'
