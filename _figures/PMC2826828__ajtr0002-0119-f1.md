caption: Full length Notch is a translated and subsequently cleaved by a furin like
  convertase in the trans-Golgi network to create the mature, non-covalently bound,
  heterodimer present at the cell surface. When the extracellular potion of the heterodimeric
  receptor interacts with a ligand an initial proteolytic cleavage, mediated by TNFα
  Converting Enxyme (TACE), occurs. This initial cleavage event is followed by a second
  cleavage mediated by the Y-Secretase complex. These sequential cleavage events free
  Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) to translocate to the nucleus. NICD is capable
  of removing the co-repressor complex (CoR) from the Centromere binding factor-1
  - suppressor of Hairless - Lag (CSL) complex, replacing it with a co-Activating
  complex (CoA). Thus NICD turns the CSL element from a repressor to an activator.
  Downstream targets of this pathway include Hairy Enhancer of Split 1 and Achaete
  Scute Complex-Like 1. NICD is subsequently phosphorylated, ubiquitinylated and degraded,
  reverting CSL back to a repressing element.
