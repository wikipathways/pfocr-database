caption: 'Overview of nutrient effects on SNF. Under low N conditions, rhizobium nodulation
  factors stimulate the expression of NIN, which in turn upregulates downstream genes
  like NF-YA1, NF-YB1, and CRE1, crucial for rhizobial infection and nodule formation.
  Calcium acts as a macronutrient in legumes, serving as a secondary messenger connecting
  nodulation factors perception at the plasma membrane with changes in calcium signaling.
  Legumes require high levels of inorganic phosphate for nodule growth, facilitated
  by phosphate uptake and translocation. The phosphate transporters GmPT5, GmPT7,
  MtPHO1.1, and MtPHO1.2 influence phosphorus uptake into nodules, subsequently affecting
  both nodule size and number. Macronutrients like sulfate and magnesium, along with
  micro-nutrients such as iron, molybdenum, and zinc, also play significant roles
  in nodule formation and N fixation. N metabolism is crucial for effective symbiosis,
  where ammonium produced through SNF is transported back to the plant and converted
  into glutamine and glutamate by GS and GOGAT. In indeterminate nodules, glutamine
  and glutamate are further converted into ASP and ASN. The AON system tightly regulates
  nodule number to balance N fixation with other developmental processes. This signaling
  pathway involves root-derived signals, shoot receptors, and shoot-derived inhibitors,
  enabling root-shoot-root communication to determine the optimal number of nodules.
  Abbreviations: ENOD40, early nodulation genes; NIN, nodule inception, NF-YA1, nuclear
  factor-Y subunit A-1, AON, autoregulation of nodulation. GS, glutamine synthetase.
