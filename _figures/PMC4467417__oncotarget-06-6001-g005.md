caption: Cir-ITCH is a potential tumor suppressor acting through the control of miRNAs
  activity such as miR-7, miR-17, miR-214 and increase the concentration of ITCH,
  resulting in suppression of the canonical Wnt pathway by degradation of phosphorylated
  Dvl2, and inhibited the oncogene c-myc expression therefore inhibit canonical Wnt
  signaling.
