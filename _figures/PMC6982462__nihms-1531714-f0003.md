caption: Proposed DKK-1 function as a multifunctional immunomodulator in the tumor
  microenvironment. Tumor cells secret DKK1 to escape NK cell-mediated anti-tumor
  immunity by reducing NKG2D ligands such as ULBP. DKK1 expands MDSCs by decreasing
  the canonical Wnt pathway signaling in the TME. DKK1 inhibits Th1 cytokine production
  from CD4 T cells and promotes Th2 cytokine production that may promote tumorigenesis.
  DKK1 modulates organotrophic metastasis by differential regulation of Wnt signaling
  in two different locations. It has been proposed that platelets may secrete DKK1
  as well. DKK-1 may induce tumor cell proliferation via unconventional receptors
  such as CKAP4.
