caption: Nanomaterials modulating TAMs polarization for the treatment of HCC via the
  NF-κB signaling pathway.(A) TLR. (1) Under NIR irradiation, EcNflaB-UCNPs released
  flaB. FlaB binds to TLR5, activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, and promotes M2-type
  TAM polarization to the M1-type. (2) PLDX-PMI was composed of PCN-Len NPs and p
  (Man-IMDQ) NRs. p (Man-IMDQ) NRs release IMDQ, promote TLR7, and then activate the
  NF-κB signaling pathway, promoting M2-type TAM polarization to M1-type. PCN-Len
  NPs released Len, thereby inhibiting VEGFR in vascular endothelial cells and reducing
  tumor microvessel density., (3) NPs (SOR/R848) released SOR and R848-C16. SOR causes
  apoptosis in HCC cells, and R848-C16 promotes TLR7, thereby promoting M2-type TAM
  polarization to the M1 type., (4) MOF-CpG-DMXAA promotes the cGAS-STING–NF–κB pathway
  through TLR4 and promotes M2-type TAM polarization to M1-type, (5) DL@NP-M-M2 pep
  promotes M2-type TAM polarization to M1-type via TLR2 and TLR9, regulating PPAR-γ
  and NF-κB(B) AMP, (1) Met@Man-MPs target M2-type TAMs via Man, releasing Met and
  promoting AMP production. AMP activates AMPK and initiates NF-κB-mediated transcription,
  promoting M2-type TAM polarization to the M1-type, (2) C60(OH)x increases Arg and
  Acp activities in TAMs and promotes TNF-α secretion. Acp activity may reflect changes
  in AMP levels(C) IKKβ. The CMCS/M-IMD-CLN released CLN through H+ ions in the TME.
  CMCS and M-IMD target HCC cells and M2-type TAMs, respectively, releasing SOR and
  IMD-0354. SOR induces the apoptosis of HCC cells. IMD-0354 inhibits IKKβ, thereby
  inhibiting IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB-mediated transcription and increasing the
  content of M1-type TAMs(D) Positive role of ROS, (1) PIONs@E6 releases IONPs, generates
  ROS through the Fenton reaction, and activates the NF-κB signaling pathway to promote
  TAM polarization to M1-type. (2) Man-IONPs target M2-type TAMs through Man, release
  IONPs, increase the content of ROS in cells, and promote TAM polarization to the
  M1 type.(E) Negative role of ROS. Nanoliposome C6-Ceramide can inhibit the ROS of
  macrophages, effectively reduce the number of M2-type TAMs, and increase the number
  of M1-type TAMs in tumor tissues. TAMs, Tumor-associated macrophages; HCC, Hepatocellular
