caption: The physiological processes that BHB direct regulates. (A) BHB across the
  plasma membrane enters the nucleus and inhibits HDACs, which participate in the
  deacetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins, resulting in the increased expression
  of the claudin-5 gene in the cardiovascular endothelial cells. (B) BHB that enters
  the nucleus was activated into acetylated BHB and then β-hydroxybutyrates histone
  and nonhistone proteins, resulting in the increased expression of Foxo1 and Ppargc1a
  gene in the CD8+ T cells. (C) BHB holds back the K+ channel in the plasma membrane,
  which maintains the cytoplasmic K+ concentration and inhibits the activation of
  the NLRP3 inflammasome. BHB activates HCAR2, a seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled
  receptor of the Gi family, and inhibits the activity of the AC/cAMP/PKA signaling
  pathway. (D) the inhibition of the AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway decreases the mitochondrial
  membrane potential and promotes the transcription of M2-related genes in intrahepatic
  macrophages. (E) the inhibition of the AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway also inhibits
  the activation of NF-κB, consequently inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory
  genes in primary rat microglial cells. (F) the oxidation of BHB in the mitochondrion
  closes the channel proteins in the mitochondrial intima, which inhibits the outflow
  of ROS. BHB, β-hydroxybutyrate; BHBtion, β-hydroxybutyration; MCT, monocarboxylate
