caption: KLA increases mRNA expression of genes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis.
  Gene expression data for the sphingolipid metabolic enzymes following 24 h of treatment
  with KLA (100 ng/ml) using the KEGG-based microarray analysis tool (GenMAPP version
  2.1) that has been modified to display this pathway more completely. The coloration
  is log2-fold change in expression following treatment with KLA (100 ng/ml) for 24
  h from microarray data generated by the LIPID MAPS Consortium. The sphingolipid
  metabolites and genes (with the gene abbreviations shown in boxes or enzyme names
  where gene names are ambiguous) are given for the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA
  to form 3-ketosphinganine (3-ketoSa) by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), which
  is reduced to sphinganine (Sa), acylated to dihydroceramides (DHCer) by (DH)Cer
  synthases (CerS), and incorporated into more complex DH-sphingolipids (the 1-phosphate
  (DHCer-1-P) sphingomyelins (DHSM), glucosylceramides (DHGlcCer), galactosylceramides
  (DHGalCer)) or desaturated to Cer followed by headgroup addition. Also included
  are a number of the catabolic genes, e.g. sphingomyelinases (SMPD), ceramidases
  (ASAH), sphingosine kinases (SphK) for the formation of sphinganine 1-phosphate
  (Sa1P) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (So1P), and phosphatases for the reverse reaction
  and the lyase that cleaves sphingoid base 1-phosphates to ethanolamine phosphate
  (EP), hexadecanal (C16:0al), and hexadecenal (C16:1al).
