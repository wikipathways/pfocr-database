caption: Proposed role of glutaminolysis in nitrogen anabolism in proliferating cells.
  (A) Central roles of interconversion between α-KG and Glu in nitrogen metabolism.
  The interconversion between α-KG and Glu in cytoplasmic provides a mechanism to
  collect amino groups from excessive amino acids and redistribute them to produce
  amino acids on demand. An adequate pool of cytoplasmic α-KG and Glu is essential
  for this function. In proliferating cells, Glu is actively consumed for biosynthesis.
  Because the uptake of Glu is limited by the capacity of cell surface transporters,
  the loss of cytoplamic gluatamate is mainly replenished by glutaminolysis. Excessive
  amino acids may replenish the Glu pool, contingent on the transaminase acitivity.
  Excessive α-KG inhibits transamination from Glu to other α-KAs, impairing the biosynthesis
  of amino acids in demand. (B) Glutaminolysis and Gln-Glu/Asp exchange model. When
  Gln is available, Gln enters mitochondria and is hydrolyzed to Glu. In addition
  to being consumed by the Krebs cycle, mitochondrial Glu can exported outside to
  maintain the homeostasis of the cytoplasmic Glu-α-KG pool or used to generate Asp
  for export. (C) Recycling of ammonia for nitrogen anabolism by specific cell types.
  When Gln is scarce, some types of cells may use ammonia (in media or from catabolism
  of amino acids such as Asn) to synthesize Glu. This pathway depends on the GLUD
  activity. α-KA, α-keto acids; α-AA, α-amino acids.
