caption: 'Ionizing radiation (IR) induces p53, which increases ROS levels and induces
  apoptosis. TIGAR and NRF2 may prevent this activity. p53 induction by IR may also
  induce CXCR2, which induces phosphorylation of p38MAPK and senescence. Genotoxic
  drugs may have their activities modulated by NRF2, GSH, MDR1, JARID1B and the AKT/mTOR
  pathway, which is induced by IGF1R. Low drug concentration induces transient p53
  expression and the target genes: p21, cyclin D1 and GADD45 that directs the cell
  to senescence, which can be inhibited by HSP90. Prolonged p53 expression induced
  by genotoxic drugs is involved in upregulation of E2F1, and the pro-apoptotic genes:
  TNFRSF10b (Killer-Dr5), TNFRSF6 (Fas-Apo) and PUMA.'
