caption: lncRNAs regulate hepatic fibrosis via TGF-β signaling pathway. a MALAT1 represses
  SIRT1 to inhibit the deacetylation of Smad3. Then the deacetylation of Smad3 binds
  to fibrogenic genes, such as colIα1, to induce the expression of colIα1. b lnc-LFAR1
  is induced by Smad2/3 and in turn to promote the phosphorylation of Smad2/3, that
  provides a positive feedback loop to enhance Smad2/3 binding to the target gene,
  therefore causing the high expression of colIα1 and α-SMA. The deposition of ECM
  and activation of HSCs contribute to the hepatic fibrosis
