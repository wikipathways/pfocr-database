caption: Oxidative stress may reduce UPP activity in RPE. Impairment of the UPP in
  RPE decreases NF-κB and STAT transcription activity by stabilization of I-κB and
  SOCS, respectively. Impairment of the UPP enhances HIF activity by stabilization
  of HIFα. Impairment of the UPP also activates p38 and JNK MAP kinases via indirect
  mechanisms. Changes in activities of these signaling pathways will alter the expression
  of many genes, such as MCP-1, complement factor H, IL-8 and VEGF. The altered expression
  of these genes may trigger the development of AMD-related phenotypes, such as local
  inflammation, activation of the complement system, accumulation of drusen and choroidal
  neovascularization.
