caption: (A) Different phosphorylation sites on STAT3 mediate canonical and non-canonical
  functions of the Notch signaling pathway. In canonical Notch signaling, the cleaved
  intracellular domain of the Notch receptor translocates to the nucleus where it
  regulates transcription of target genes, including Hes1 and Hes5. Hes1 and Hes5
  are transcription factors themselves and can therefore regulate additional target
  genes downstream of Notch activation. However, they also have cytoplasmic functions
  where they form complexes with JAK2 promoting its ability to phosphorylate STAT3-Tyr
  (Kamakura et al., ). This modification leads to the induction of differentiation
  in NSCs (Bonni et al., ). A non-canonical branch of Notch signaling leads to STAT3-Ser
  phosphorylation in the absence of detectable STAT3-Tyr phosphorylation (Androutsellis-Theotokis
  et al., ). This is followed by increased transcription of Hes3. Hes3, in turn, promotes
  growth through poorly understood mechanisms. A clue as to the function of Hes3 comes
  from observations that force-expressed Hes3 in NSC cultures increases the expression
  of sonic hedgehog (Androutsellis-Theotokis et al., ), a morphogen that also acts
  as a mitogen for NSCs (Ahn and Joyner, ). (B) Different cell types interpret STAT3
  and Hes/Hey signaling in specific ways. Many mature cell types (e.g., neurons and
  astrocytes in the brain), as well as many established cell lines from different
  tissues utilize the JAK/STAT pathway that leads to STAT3-Tyr phosphorylation for
  growth. In contrast, STAT3-Ser phosphorylation is only auxiliary to the transcriptional
  strength of STAT3 and dispensable. NSCs interpret these signals in a different way.
  The JAK/STAT pathway involving STAT3-Tyr phosphorylation induces their differentiation,
  preferentially to the astrocytic fate. NSCs can now recruit the STAT3-Ser phosphorylation
  as a critical regulator of growth. An important mediator of STAT3-Ser action is
  Hes3. Cancer stem cells (from glioblastoma multiforme) are able to grow utilizing
  either the JAK-STAT or the STAT3-Ser/Hes3 signaling pathways. The ability of cancer
  stem cells to grow utilizing distinct signaling pathways blurs the line distinguishing
  cancer stem cells from more differentiated cancer cells and underlines their ability
  to evade therapy aimed at disrupting one or a limited set of signaling pathways.
