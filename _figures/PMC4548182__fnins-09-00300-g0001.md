caption: Sphingolipid metabolic pathways. Ceramide is central in sphingolipid metabolism,
  produced by de novo and recycling pathways. Serine and palmitoyl-CoA are substrates
  of serine palmitoyl-transferase (SPT), the rate limiting enzyme of de novo synthesis
  that generates ketosphinganine from serine and palmitoyl-CoA (bottom). Ketosphinganine
  is reduced to form sphinganine that is N-acylated by ceramide synthases with fatty
  acids of different chain lengths to form dihydroceramides. Dihydroceramides are
  desaturated by dihydroceramide desaturase (DES) to generate ceramides. Ceramides
  can be metabolized to sphingomyelin or glycosphingolipids. SPT generates deoxyceramides
  when utilizing alanine instead of serine. Notably, deoxyceramides only originate
  from de novo synthesis. The recycling pathway generates ceramides from sphingomyelin
  and other complex sphingolipids. Ceramidases degrade ceramides and release sphingoid
  bases, which are reutilized for complex sphingolipid biosynthesis or phosphorylated
  to sphingosine-1-phosphate. Boxed compounds indicate molecular species assayed in
  this study.
