caption: 'NFE2L2-dependent genes in ferroptosis. Ferroptosis, a form of oxidative
  cell death, can be triggered by increased iron accumulation or the inhibition of
  antioxidant systems. Fe3+ is taken up by TFRC and exported by SLC40A1. Inside the
  cell, Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+, with excess iron stored in ferritin (composed of
  FTH1 and FTL) or sequestered by MT1G. Conversely, autophagic degradation of ferritin
  via NCOA4 can elevate the labile iron pool, a process regulated by HERC2-mediated
  degradation of NCOA4 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. HMOX1 also contributes
  to the labile iron pool by catalyzing heme degradation. Iron is utilized in mitochondria
  for heme synthesis via FECH and ABCB6 or transported to the nucleus by PIR, which
  suppresses autophagy by limiting the cytosolic translocation of HMGB1. Excess iron
  can lead to oxidative stress and ROS production via the Fenton reaction, which can
  be countered by NQO1, HMOX1, or G6PD. ACSL4 is a key regulator of ferroptosis, producing
  PUFAs for subsequent ALOX-mediated lipid peroxidation. MGST1 inhibits ALOX activity
  through direct interaction, while MUFAs may competitively inhibit PUFA lipid peroxidation.
  Multiple mechanisms inhibit excessive lipid peroxidation, with GPX4 playing a central
  role by using GSH to neutralize lipid peroxides. GSH levels are positively regulated
  by the system xc--mediated cystine uptake and subsequent cysteine production, with
  SLC7A11 and SLC3A2 as key components. GCL (composed of GCLC and GCLM) is the rate-limiting
  enzyme in GSH synthesis, and GSSG can be reduced back to GSH by GSR. AIFM2 provides
  a GPX4-independent anti-ferroptotic pathway through various mechanisms, including
  the production of CoQ10 or vitamin K, or activation of ESCRT-III membrane repair
  pathways. 4-HNE, an end product of lipid peroxidation, is detoxified by the ALDH
  family. NFE2L2-dependent genes are highlighted in green, while positive regulators
  of ferroptosis are shown in red. NFE2L2: NFE2-like basic leucine zipper transcription
