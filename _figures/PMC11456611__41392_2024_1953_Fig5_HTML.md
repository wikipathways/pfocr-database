caption: Interplay between colorectal cancer pathogenesis and the gut microbiota.
  This figure illustrates the interaction between various gut microbiota and the development
  of colorectal cancer. Specific bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Escherichia
  coli (pks+ strains), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Enterococcus
  faecalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Helicobacter pylori, produce factors
  that contribute to cancer pathogenesis. These factors include FadA adhesin, colibactin,
  B. fragilis toxin (BFT), extracellular superoxide, and cytotoxin-associated gene
  product (CagA), which lead to processes like Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation,
  NF-κB signaling activation, IL-8 secretion, IL-1β secretion, DNA damage, chromosomal
  instability, genotoxic stress, and inflammation. The Figure underscores the significant
  role of gut microbiota in influencing colorectal cancer pathways
