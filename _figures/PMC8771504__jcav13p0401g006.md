caption: Schematic representation summarizes the results from the present study. Chronic
  stress changes the behaviors of anxiety and depression in mice. At the same time,
  chronic stress causes the changes of HPA axis related hormones in blood and urine.
  Chronic stress can increase the serum concentrations of catecholamine, epinephrine
  and urine VMA, a final metabolite of catecholamine, and decrease the serum concentration
  of dopamine. Salbutamol, a specific agonist of β2-AR, was selected in this study
  to simulate chronic stress in cells. Salbutamol can recognize and activate β2-AR,
  which subsequently activate its down-stream target ERK and further promote ERK phosphorylation.
  Phosphorylation of ERK functioned as a positive regulator of EMT under chronic stress,
  which subsequently promoted cancer progression of human gastric cancer cells.
