caption: Glucose is oxidized to pyruvate through the glycolytic pathway. PC replenishes
  oxaloacetate in the Krebs tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle when its intermediates
  are used for various biosynthetic pathways, depending on the tissues. In liver,
  oxaloacetate (OAA) is utilized as the precursor for gluconeogenesis whereby OAA
  can exit the mitochondria as malate before being converted back to OAA by cytosolic
  malate dehydrogenase (MDH). In some situations OAA is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) by mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-M) [,]. Cytoplasmic
  OAA is converted to glucose by the combined activities of cytoplasmic PEPCK (PEPCK-C),
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase and 7 of the 10 glycolytic enzymes.
  In fat cells, PC provides oxaloacetate to facilitate the export of acetyl CoA in
  the form of citrate that leaves mitochondria for de novo fatty acid synthesis. Oxaloacetate
  liberated in the cytoplasm by citrate cleavage enzyme is converted to PEP by PEPCK-C
  as in the liver []. PEP is then converted to glycerol by a pathway known as “glyceroneogenesis”,
  while acetyl CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). Fatty
  acid synthase (FAS) catalyses the condensation of two-carbon moieties from malonyl-CoA
  to produce long chain acyl-CoA that are subsequently esterified with glycerol to
  form triglycerides. In pancreatic β-cells, PC is involved in a ‘pyruvate cycle’
  that involves the exchange of TCA cycle intermediates and cytosolic pyruvate, catalysed
  by MDH and malic enzyme (ME) [,]. This cycle produces a large amount of NADPH which
  is one of the metabolic coupling factors. In astrocytes, α-ketoglutarate is converted
  by an aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) to glutamate, one of the neurotransmitter
  substances of neurons []. Key metabolites glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G-3-P), dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (DHAP), and enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) are indicated.
