caption: 'Oncogenic signaling network activated by bile acids. The epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is central signaling for bile acid (BA) action associated
  with colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Over-activation of this pathway in tumor
  cells is associated with tumor cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion,
  and metastasis. PI3K and Ras/Raf/MAPK are two dominant downstream signaling cascades
  of EGFR activation. Muscarinic cholinergic receptor 3 (MR3) is another actor that
  mainly contribute to CRC initiation and progression mediated by BAs. This action
  of CR3 requires cross-talk with EGFR transactivation. MR3 activation stimulates
  MMP1 expression, which promotes CRC invasion and mediates for BA-induced CSCs in
  the colonic epithelial population via Wnt pathway. NF-κB is also one of major signaling
  activated by BAs. This signaling is activated by oxidative stress and as downstream
  of PI3K signaling. It protects cells against apoptosis and enhances cell proliferation.
  Cox-2/PGE2 is one of the signaling events of BAs action, BAs increase the synthesis
  of PGE2 via Cox-2 enzyme induction. This signaling increases the expression of Bcl-2,
  that then suppresses p53-induced apoptosis thereby promoting tumorigenesis. Additionally,
  PGE2 signaling is known to stimulate cAMP production, which can stimulate tumor
  growth by suppressing apoptosis. ROS: Reactive oxygen species; RNS: Reactive nitrogen
  species, NF-κB: Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells;
  PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; EGFR: Epidermal growth factor
  receptor; MAPK: Mitogen activated protein kinase; AP-1: Activator protein 1; STAT3:
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; Cox-2: Cyclooxygenase 2; PGE2:
