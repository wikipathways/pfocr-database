caption: Immune responses mediated by (H) pylori OMVs and infected cell exosomes.
  (A) BabA and SabA, found in H. pylori OMVs, enhance adhesion to the gastric mucosa.
  Peptidoglycan within H. pylori OMVs activates the NOD1 response. During H. pylori
  infection, OMVs induce the secretion of cytokines like TNF-α and IFN-γ from T cells
  and stimulate gastric epithelial cytokine release (e.g., IL-8) via NF-κB activation.
  OMV ligands binding TLR4 and CD14 on monocytes activate NF-κB, enhancing cytokine
  release. H. pylori OMVs upregulate ICAM-1 and CD11b integrin expression, leading
  to degranulation and ECP release; these OMVs also activate NADPH oxidase in neutrophils
  through GPCR signaling and kinase pathways, inducing oxidative burst and ROS production.
  Furthermore, H. pylori OMVs can induce serum IgG responses, potentially aiding immune
  evasion during H. pylori pathogenesis. (B) Exosomes from H. pylori-infected human
  gastric epithelial cells secrete GES-1, inducing the expression of soluble IL-6
  receptor that mediates the promotion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α.
  CagA promotes the disruption of intercellular tight junctions. After H. pylori infection,
  vesicles containing p-MET are released. Macrophages subsequently take up these vesicles,
  which release proinflammatory cytokines that enhance tumor growth and stimulate
  cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Apart from the cell signaling proteins
  CD81, CD63, CD40, and MCH-I, exosomes containing miR-155 from H. pylori-infected
  macrophages also enhance the secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-23, IL-6, IL-1β,
  and TNF-α. Simultaneously, miR-155 expression activates MyD88 signaling pathways
  and NF-κB inflammatory protein in macrophages during H. pylori infection. The exosomes
  derived from H. pylori-infected cells contain a specific protein, Epi_2D, which
  triggers a Th2 immune response, producing IL-4 and IL-10. H. pylori’s CagA inhibits
  p53 and miR-34a, leading to the upregulation of PD-L1 levels in gastric cancer cells,
  which inhibits CD8+ T cell proliferation and anti-cancer response, promoting immune
  evasion in gastric cancer
