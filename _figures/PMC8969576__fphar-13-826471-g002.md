caption: Suggested pathway that chitinase 1 uses to regulate TGF-β signaling. Chitinase
  1 (CHIT1) binds with transforming growth factor beta receptor associated protein
  1 (Tgfbrap1), enhances the canonical receptor mediated Smads2/3 signaling potentially
  through recruiting of Co-Smad4. CHIT1 also interacts with transcription factor forkhead
  box O3 (FoxO3) that reduces the nuclear FoxO3 and that results into decreased the
  Smad7 expression. RI, TGF-β receptor 1; RII, TGF-β receptor 2; p, phosphorylation;
  ECM, extracellular matrix proteins.
