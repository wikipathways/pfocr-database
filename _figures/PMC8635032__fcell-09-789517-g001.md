caption: 'The regulatory pathways of ferroptosis. The figure shows the regulation
  pathway of ferroptosis, which can be simply summarized into two types. The first
  type is the metabolic pathways related to ferroptosis, such as iron metabolism,
  lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism pathways; The second type is the signaling
  pathway related to ferroptosis, such as p53, Nrf2, FSP1 pathways. Glu: glutamic
