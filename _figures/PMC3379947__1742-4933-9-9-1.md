caption: General scheme for the induction of Nrf2-signaling pathway. The antioxidant
  response element (ARE) in the promoter region of select genes allows the coordinated
  up-regulation of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes in response to dietary phytochemicals.
  This up-regulation is mediated through nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like
  2 (Nrf2) that may be activated by endogenous and exogenous molecules or stressful
  conditions. These agents disrupt the association between Nrf2 and Keap1 with subsequent
  nuclear translocation of Nrf2. In the cell nucleus Nrf2 interacts with small MAF
  protein, forming a heterodimer that binds to the ARE sequence in the promoter region
  and up-regulates transcription of many genes encoding detoxifying enzymes. We speculate
  that this signaling pathway is constitutively upregulated in long-lived individuals
  providing extension of longevity and health span.
