caption: Predicted metabolic pathways of TM6 bacteria based on the seven population
  genomes studied. Import and/or export of compounds through transporters and permeases
  in the cell membrane are indicated by uni- or bidirectional arrows. β-glucosidase,
  pentose phosphate pathway, and partial glycolysis genes were identified indicating
  that TM6 bacteria are able to hydrolyze cellobiose for energy through substrate-level
  phosphorylation. No complete pathways for the TCA cycle, fatty acid, nucleotide
  and amino acid biosynthesis were identified, and only a limited number of amino
  acids can be interconverted or synthesized from intermediate metabolites. TM6 bacteria
  most likely rely on the uptake of nucleosides and amino acids from their surroundings,
  suggesting a host-associated lifestyle. Superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin reductase
  genes suggest potential for oxidative stress tolerance. A pyrophosphate-energized
  proton pump and ATP synthase potentially serve to maintain the transmembrane proton
  gradient. The presence of ATP/ADP translocases and a degenerated cell envelope structure
  indicate a parasitic lifestyle in TM6 bacteria.
