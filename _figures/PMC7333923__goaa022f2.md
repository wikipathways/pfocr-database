caption: The downstream signaling pathway of the EGFR mainly. EGF selectively binds
  to EGFR and triggers the receptor to form a dimer that activates RAS. RAS transmits
  signals from activated transmembrane receptor EGFR to effectors in the MAPK- andPI3K/AKT-signaling
  pathway in the cytoplasm. Active GTP-bound RAS triggers RAF to engage in signal
  transmission. Activated RAF changes the phosphorylation status and activates MEK1
  and MEK2. MEK are capable of phosphorylating and activating the MAPK extracellular
  signal ERK1 and ERK2, and regulate cell survival and proliferation. The other effector
  pathway is the PI3K/AKT pathway. RAS can interact directly with the catalytic subunit
  of PI3Ks and activate it; activated PI3Ks trigger AKT participate in signal transmission.
