caption: The Complement Cascade in HIE. Hypoxic insult induces expression of ischemia-induced
  “neoantigens” on the surface of vascular endothelial cells. These neoantigens are
  recognized by natural antibodies (IgM) initiating systemic classical complement
  pathway activation by binding C1q, characterized by a series of cleavages, culminating
  in the formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC) that has lytic activity. C5a
  and C3b are intermediates in the cascade, which execute chemotactic and phagocytic
  functions, respectively, while C3a has been shown to be anti-inflammatory in the
  acute phase. Components of the classical complement pathway (C1q, C3, and C9) are
  also endogenously produced in the brain, primarily in microglia after HI injury.
  C1q facilitates a non-inflammatory uptake of apoptotic neurons by microglia, thus
  limiting the exposure of surrounding neurons to toxic intracellular contents such
  as glutamate. Thus, microglial synthesis of C1q is a neuroprotective mechanism,
  and emphasizes the role of microglia and C1q in cellular homeostasis. However, in
  HI injuries, the extent of the damage amplifies the cascade, and mediators such
  as C5a perpetuate the inflammatory damage. HT (blue arrows) modulates the complement
  pathway in HIE by decreasing the microglial expression of C1q, C3, C9, systemic
  production of C5a, resulting in decreased neuronal apoptosis.
