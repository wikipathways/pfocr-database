caption: The temporal progression of sporulation is shown from top to bottom. Transcription
  factors and sigma factors are shown in bold, and proteins enclosed in boxes directly
  participate in signaling between the mother cell and forespore (dashed boxes indicate
  that trans-septum signaling has not been tested yet). Text color denotes whether
  the factor has been detected at both the transcript and protein level (black), at
  either the transcript or protein level (purple), or has not been tested yet at the
  transcript or protein level (blue). Black arrows delineate transcriptional control
  of gene expression; red arrows indicate signaling pathways; dashed lines indicate
  that the regulatory relationship remains unknown; and thick arrows demarcate notable
  points of divergence from the pathway defined in B. subtilis. AND gates are indicated.
