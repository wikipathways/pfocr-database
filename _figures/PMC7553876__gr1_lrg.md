caption: Hypothetical mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 successfully evade the immune
  system while maintaining an inflammatory feedback loop. Following infection coronaviruses
  remain highly pathogenic at least in part due to the various viral mechanisms allowing
  them to evade and suppress the IFN response. The CoVs interfere with several processes
  in innate antiviral immunity. The SARS-CoV-2 can inhibit pattern recognition receptors
  (PPRs) and/or reduce IFN-I/III levels. ADAM17 (a desintegrin and metalloproteinase
  17)-mediated proteolytic cleavage of ACE2 is upregulated by endocytosed SARS-CoV-2
  viral particle, that results in over-production of angiotensin II (Angio II) by
  the related enzyme ACE. The elevate angiotensin II levels increase the activity
  of angiotensin 1 receptors (AT1R) as found in conditions like fibrosis and inflammation
  as well as increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and vasoconstriction.
  In turn, increased angiotensin II enhances IL-6 production via JAK/STAT pathway,
  thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Moreover, the angiotensin II/AT1 receptor
  axis activates ADAM17 that cleaves and inactivates ACE2, enhancing angiotensin II
  levels. In addition, ADAM17 induction also cleaves the membrane form of IL-6Rα to
  the soluble form (sIL-6Rα), followed by the gp130-mediated activation of STAT, further
  amplifying the IL-6 signal. The SARS-CoV-2 can also activate NF-κB signaling pathway
  through increased IκB degradation, a process that leads to the transcription of
  several pro-inflammatory cytokines that results in what is called a cytokine storm.
