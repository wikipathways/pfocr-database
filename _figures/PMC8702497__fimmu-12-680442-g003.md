caption: IL-7 signaling pathways. IL-7 must combine with the IL-7R to carry out its
  biological function. IL-7R is a transmembrane heterodimer consisting of the α chain
  and γ chain (common γ chain, γc chain). IL-7Rα is used by IL-7R and the thymic stromal
  lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR), while γc is shared by IL-7R, IL-2R, IL-4R, IL-9R,
  IL-15R, and IL-21R. JAK-STAT, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK pathways are involved in IL-7 signaling
  transduction. When IL-7 binds to IL-7Rα, the α and γc chains dimerize. JAK1 and
  JAK3 are major kinases that respond to IL-7/IL-7R signaling in the JAK-STAT pathway.
  Myc interacting zinc finger protein 1 (Miz1) recruits JAK1 to IL-7Rα. The phosphorylation
  of JAK1 and JAK3 triggers STAT5 phosphorylation and dimerization to upregulate anti-apoptotic
  gene expression and downregulate pro-apoptotic gene expression. In addition, the
  MAPK pathway is also activated by the phosphorylated JAK1 and JAK3. When p85 tethers
  to IL-7Rα, the PI3K-Akt pathway is activated. Subsequently, the Akt is phosphorylated,
  which then induces glucose metabolism regulator gene expression, and inhibits p27
  kinase inhibitor protein 1 (p27kip1) expression with phosphorylated Forkhead box
  protein 1 (FOXO1).
