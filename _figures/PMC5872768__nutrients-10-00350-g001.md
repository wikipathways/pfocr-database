caption: 'Overview of possible routes of lipid oversupply-induced insulin resistances
  associated with mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. (Orange arrow)
  Mitochondrial dysfunction and lipotoxicity theory: lipid oversupply elicits reduction
  in mitochondrial β-oxidation that induces cytosolic ectopic accumulation of fatty
  acid metabolites, such as diacylglycerol and ceramides. These lipid metabolites
  impair insulin signalling pathways, directly or indirectly, through the activation
  of an inflammasome/pro-inflammatory pathway. (Blue arrow) ROS implication: lipid
  overload induces an increase in mitochondrial β-oxidation that stimulates ROS production.
  ROS can directly target protein involved in the glucose uptake process or activate
  the inflammasome, which initiates a series of inflammatory reactions in response
  to stress. ROS production may be also induced by excessive mitochondrial Ca2+ influx
  from ER. (Black arrow) ER stress induced by lipid oversupply directly actives inflammatory
  pathways and impairs insulin action. On the other hand, ER stress also trigger Ca2+
  mobilization towards mitochondria through mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum
  membrane (MAM), where Mfn2 play a regulatory role. The subsequent opening of the
  mitochondrial transition pore leads to activation of inflammasome and inflammatory
  pathways.'
