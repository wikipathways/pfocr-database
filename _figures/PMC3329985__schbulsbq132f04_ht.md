  Analysis. Protein symbols with red were upregulated while green were downregulated.
  Hub proteins not significantly altered in this study are shown as clear. (A) The
  merged network of 2 top networks associated with 7-day MK-801 treatment. (B) The
  top network associated with 21-day MK-801 treatment.
