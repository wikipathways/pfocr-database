caption: In the absence of homologous sequences, free DSBs are repaired by nuclease
  and polymerase-dependent IR (pathway A). In the presence of a suitable homologous
  sequence, free DSBs may be repaired by RDR (pathway B). This involves resectioning
  of the DNA ends by RecBC and loading of RecA onto the ssDNA produced. These RecA-ssDNA
  filaments catalyze D-loop formation and repair of the DSB. This pathway may also
  contribute to the repair of replication forks when they encounter the free DSB.
  Finally, replication forks that encounter topoisomerases that are covalently-bound
  to the DNA are repaired by recombination-dependent fork repair (pathway C). This
  involves RecG-mediated fork regression and RuvC cleavage to produce DSEs where RecBC
  mediates RecA-ssDNA filament formation. These filaments catalyze strand invasion
  of a homologous sequence where PriA, and possibly Pol II, help to reestablish a
  processive replication fork. With sufficient accumulation of DSBs and collapsed
  forks, persistent RecA-ssDNA filaments induce levels of LexA cleavage sufficient
  to de-repress the error prone polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, which cooperate to
  induce mutations (pathway D). Once resistance-conferring mutations are made, DSBs
  and collapsed forks cease to accumulate and RecA-filaments no longer persist. Subsequently,
  the cellular concentration of LexA increases, shutting down expression of the pro-mutagenic
  polymerases. See text for details.
