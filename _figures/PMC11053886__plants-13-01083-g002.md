caption: Signaling related to flowering. Up- and downregulated genes were marked in
  red and blue, respectively. The expression of DEGs related to circadian clock was
  supplemented with the graph. (a) Pathway related to flowering in the early budding
  stage. (b) Pathway associated with flowering in the budding stage. Asterisk indicated
  the stage of DEGs at p < 0.05. Full line indicated molecular interaction or relation,
  dotted line indicated indirect link or unknown relation
