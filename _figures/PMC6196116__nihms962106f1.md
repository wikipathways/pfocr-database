caption: Schematic overview of the E2-mediated modulation of Gαi,o-coupled GABAB receptors
  via a membrane-associated receptor (mER) in hypothalamic POMC nerve terminals. E2
  binds to a mER that is Gαq-coupled to activate phospholipase C and catalyzes the
  hydrolysis of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to inositol
  1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Calcium is released from intracellular
  stores (endoplasmic reticulum) by IP3, and DAG activates protein kinase C Δ (PKCΔ).
  Through phosphorylation, adenylyl cyclase VII (AC VII) activity is upregulated by
  PKC. The generation of cAMP activates PKA, which can uncouple (dashed line) GABAB
  receptors from their signaling pathway through phosphorylation of a downstream effector
  molecule (e.g., G protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying K+, GIRK, channels). Together,
  elevated intracellular Ca2+ and attenuation of GABAB-mediated inhibition will facilitate
  the release of multiple neurotransmitters—GABA, glutamate, β-endorphin and α-melanocyte
  stimulating hormone (α-MSH)—from POMC neurons.
