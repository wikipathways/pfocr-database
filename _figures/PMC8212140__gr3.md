caption: Enhanced glycolysis in CSCs and control of oxidative stress.The transcription
  factor MYC is an important regulator of CSC phenotypes and promotes the production
  of key glycolytic enzymes. MYC can also lead to alternative splicing of pyruvate
  kinase into its M2 isoform (PKM2) to further regulate metabolism. Glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P) can shuttle into the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) for NADPH production
  to fuel antioxidant pathways, thus promoting a reductive environment for CSCs. Cluster
  of Differentiation 44 (CD44) is a common CSC marker with a role in enhancing glycolysis
  and interacts with PKM2. In addition, CD44 variant can regulate the cystine/glutamate
  antiporter system xc via stabilization of the xCT subunit. Overall, glucose can
  be shuttled through glycolysis with reduced oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria
  and multiple mechanisms utilized to reduce overall ROS.
