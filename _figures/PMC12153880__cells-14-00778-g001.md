caption: Schematic illustration of the cGAS/STING pathway. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate
  adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS), which is freely present in the cytosol,
  binds to both exogenous and endogenous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Viruses and
  bacteria can be sources of exogenous dsDNA, while endogenous dsDNA mainly originates
  from cell apoptosis, auto cellular death, and mitochondrial damage. After binding
  to dsDNA, cGAS catalyzes a reaction between ATP and GTP to form 2′,3′-cGAMP. 2′,3′-cGAMP
  then binds to the ‘stimulator of interferon genes’ (STING), located on the membrane
  of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), triggers a conformational change and subsequently
  activates STING. The activated STING is transported to the Golgi apparatus via the
  coatomer protein complex I (COP I), where it phosphorylates TANK-binding kinase
  1 (TBK1) to form a tetramer. TBK1 then phosphorylates interferon regulatory factor
  3 (IRF3), which dimerizes and enters the nucleus together with nuclear factor kappa
  B (NF-κB) to induce the expression of type 1 interferons, as well as other proinflammatory
  cytokines. Many chemical compounds are known to modulate the cGAS/STING signaling
  pathway (see green and red box). Created in BioRender. Kaddatz, H. (2025) https://BioRender.com/9kzlnt0
