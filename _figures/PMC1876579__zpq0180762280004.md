caption: Schematic diagram for signaling pathway involved in regulation of alginate
  synthesis and mucoid conversion. External stresses affect the folding of periplasmic
  proteins (PPs) and OMPs bearing the C-terminal signaling motifs such as WVF and
  YVF and may also increase their expression. The exposed signaling motifs bind the
  PDZ domain and exert an allosteric activation on the protease domain of AlgW, initiating
  the cleavage of anti-σ factor MucA, followed by the cleavage by the second protease
  MucP. The released σ-factor AlgU undergoes autoregulation and induces the overproduction
  of alginate, conferring a mucoid phenotype displayed by many clinical isolates from
  CF patients.
