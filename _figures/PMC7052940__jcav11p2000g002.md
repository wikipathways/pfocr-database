caption: Mechanism of resistance to FGF/FGFR inhibitors. (A) Gatekeeper mutation in
  the FGFR kinase domain often results in resistance to FGFR inhibitors. (B) FGFR
  inhibition can activate other membrane receptor signaling pathwayin the feedback
  way, like EGFR, ERBB3 or MET. The downstream cascades may be mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2,
  PI3K-AKT and GSK signaling pathway. (C) Loss of PTEN can increase the activation
  of PI3K-AKTsignaling pathway. (D) EMT can contribute to the resistance to FGFR inhibitors.
  (E) ABCG2 regulated drug-efflux can also contribute to the resistance to FGFR inhibitors.
  (F) RASA1 is a protein activator, which can promote the translation of activated
  RAS to inactivated RAS. The inactivation of RASA1 may induce the resistance to FGFR
  inhibitors.
