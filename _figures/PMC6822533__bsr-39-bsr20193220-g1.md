caption: 'Vacuolar and Cytosolic cross-presentation pathways inside a DC: (1) Antigens
  internalized through phagocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis are properly
  degraded in the endosomes due to varying pH and different proteases. (2) Antigen
  is loaded on to recycled MHC I in the phagosome. (3) The recycling of MHC I is mediated
  through Rab11a in Toll-like receptor (TLR) controlled process with the help of SNAP23
  dependent on MyD88 signaling. (4) Alternatively, antigens processed under the cytosolic
  pathway are translocated to the cytosol via phagosomal disruption through NOX-2
  complex and through Sec 61 translocon. (5) The antigens are lysed by proteasome
  complex. (6) Lysed antigens are transported to the ER via TAP transporter and further
  trimmed by ERAP and loaded on to MHC I. (7) Antigenic peptide in the cytosol after
  proteasomal degradation may also get retransported into phagosome through TAP which
  is further trimmed by IRAP and presented on to recycled MHC-I molecule. (8) TAP
  molecule is transported from ER with the help of Sec22b protein resident of the
  ERGIC that interacts with Syntaxin 4 on phagosome. Abbreviation: ERGIC, ER-Golgi
  intermediate compartment.'
