caption: Ferroptosis related signaling pathway affected by EBV, HTLV-I and KSHV viruses.
  The oval represents key node proteins in the signaling pathway associated with ferroptosis.
  The square represents the virus or the gene product that the virus encodes. EBV,
  HTLV-I, and KSHV all inhibit TP53 (P53) signaling, while EBV and KSHV also activate
  NRF2. Specifically, KSHV’s viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6) enhances the activity of
  the deacetylase SIRT3, leading to the deacetylation of the serpine mRNA-binding
  protein 1 (SERBP1). This deacetylation inhibits SERBP1‘s ability to stabilize lipoyltransferase
  2 (Lipt2) mRNA, resulting in the degradation of Lipt2 and the suppression of ferroptosis.
  However, the exact mechanism by which Lipt2 regulates ferroptosis remains unclear.
