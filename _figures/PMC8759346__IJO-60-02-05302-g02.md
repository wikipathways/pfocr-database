caption: CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathway blockade in immune checkpoint therapy. CTLA-4 pathway
  blockade allows for activation and proliferation of more T cells, which can reduce
  Treg-mediated immunosuppression. PD-1 pathway blockade restores the activity of
  antitumor T cells that have become quiescent. A dual pathway blockade can take a
  synergistic effect, resulting in a more powerful and more lasting antitumor immune
  response. CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; PD-1, programmed death 1; PD-L1, programmed death ligand 1; TCR, T-cell
  receptor; Treg, regulatory T cell.
