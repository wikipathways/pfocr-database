caption: DAM is activated in the photoreceptor layer of RCS rats in a CSF1R-dependent
  pathway and suppresses photoreceptor degeneration by removing dead photoreceptors
  and infiltrated neutrophils. In a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, activated
  microglia have been identified as DAM, showing a conserved transcriptional signature.
  During RP, apoptotic photoreceptors also promote DAM activation, switching from
  a homeostatic stage to an intermediate phenotype and then to the DAM phenotype.
  Initial activation following signals associated with RP pathology induced microglia
  into an intermediate phenotype, which is independent of CSF1R signaling for activation,
  and survival. However, the transition from this intermediate phenotype to the fully
  activated DAM phenotype may be a CSF1R-dependent transition involving the upregulation
  of the phagocytic ability to clear dead photoreceptors and infiltrated neutrophils.
  Treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor mainly eliminated DAM in the photoreceptor layer
  of RCS rats, which aggravated the degeneration of photoreceptors, suggesting that
  DAM play a protective role during RD.
