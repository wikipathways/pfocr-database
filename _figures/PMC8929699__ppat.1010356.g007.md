caption: A. Peptidoglycan recognizing receptors on the cellular surface recognize
  pathogens and activate the Imd signalling cascade. Both Rel and Jra are transcriptional
  effectors for this pathway and they act to evoke a robust immune response. Our data
  places Jra as an important effector and modulator of the immune GRN (left panel).
  In a scenario where Jra is resistant to SUMO conjugation (right panel), we find
  that the immune response is dampened, favouring the proliferation of the pathogen.
  B. A small fraction of SUMOylated Jra can influence the robustness of the host defense
  response in the gut. We propose that the SUMO conjugation/deconjugation of Jra is
  a dynamic process, regulated by the nuclear SUMO conjugation machinery, and occurring
  on the promoters Jra target genes. Dynamic cycles of SUMOylation fine-tunes the
  activity of Jra with SUMOylated Jra maintained at low levels, i.e. <<5% of total
  Jra. C. The mechanism for effect of SUMO conjugation on Jra mediated transcription
  in Drosophila is not clear. Multiple possibilities exist; SUMOylation may influence
  activation and/or repression by Jra, and this activity may depend on context, with
  SUMOylated Jra interacting differentially with the transcriptional machinery at
  Jra target promoters. Images for this figure have been generated using BioRender.
