caption: 'PPAR signaling pathway from KEGG. The nodes correspond to genes and other
  functional units, and edges represent interactions between those units. Nodes are
  colored based on their differential expression between case and control samples
  detected with ROTS in the ccRCC data set GSE14994. Solid borders indicate that the
  gene is highly expressed in ccRCC patient samples, and correspondingly dashed borders
  mean low expression compared with control samples. If FDR value of the node is ≤0.05,
  the color of the node is strong. The color is light if the FDR value is between
  0.05 and 0.1. Genes with white node color have FDR value >0.1. For gray nodes without
  borders, there are no measurements available. A colour version of this figure is
  available at BIB online: http://bib.oxfordjournals.org.'
