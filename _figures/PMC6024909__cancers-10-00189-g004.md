caption: The p14ARF-p53 pathway. HDM2 sustains low basal levels of p53 by its continuous
  degradation [,]. p14ARF, activated by cellular stress signals and potentially regulated
  by estrogen and progesterone hormones in the breast [,,,,], causes inhibition of
  the HDM2–p53 complex, therefore stabilizing p53. p53 is able to bring about cell
  cycle arrest at the G1/S phase through the activation of the CDK inhibitor p21,
  which inhibits downstream CDK 4 and 6 [,,]. Both CDK 4 and 6 are well-known mediators
  of G1/S cell cycle progression, hence their inhibition by p21 halts the cell cycle
  [].
