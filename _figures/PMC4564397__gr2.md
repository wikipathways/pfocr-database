caption: 'The NO/peroxynitrite signaling pathway A. Transformed cells. Arginase controls
  the level of arginine (#1) which is the substrate for NO synthase (NOS) (#2). A
  substantial concentration of NOS-derived NO is converted into  by NO dioxygenase
  (NOD) (#3) that is connected to the activity of cytochrome P 450 oxidoreductase
  (POR). The remaining NO passes the cell membrane (#4) and reacts with NOX1-derived
  superoxide anions (#5), resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (#6).
  Proton pumps in the cell membrane (#7) favour the protonation of peroxynitrite to
  peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) (#8). Peroxynitrous acid readily decomposes into NO2
  and hydroxyl radicals (#9), which cause lipid peroxidation (LPO) (#10) and apoptosis
  induction through the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (#11). The oxidation of
  NO by molecular oxygen (#12) leads to the formation of the peroxynitrite radical
  (ONOO.), which reacts with NO to form ONOONO (#13). ONOONO decomposes into 2 NO2
  (#14). NO2 reacts with NO to form dinitrogentrioxide (N2O3) (#15). NOX1 generates
  extracellular superoxide anions (#16) that dismutate to H2O2 (#17). , the anion
  of H2O2 (#18) reacts with N2O3, resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite (#19).
  The reaction between peroxynitrite and CO2 (#20, 21) leads to the formation of nitrosoperoxycarboxylate
  () (#22). Nitrosoperoxycarboxylate decomposes into NO2 and the carbonate radical
  (CO3.–) (#23). CO3·− reacts with H2O2, resulting in the formation of HCO3−+HO2·
  (#24), followed by the formation of superoxide anions (#25). NO2 reacts with NO
  to form N2O3 (#26). The reaction between H2O2 and peroxynitrite leads to the formation
  of singlet oxygen (1O2) (#27), whereas the reaction between H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals
  (#28, 29) might impair apoptosis induction. B. Tumor cells. The concentration of
  extracellular NO is controlled through steps #1–#4, as discussed under A. Nox1-derived
  superoxide anions (#5) dismutate to form H2O2 (#6) that is decomposed by membrane-associated
  catalase (#7), involving compound I as intermediate (CATFeIV=O·+). Compound I of
  catalase is generated through interaction of native catalase with one molecule of
  H2O2 and oxidates NO to (#8). Oxidation of NO impairs the formation of ONOO− (#9,
  #10). Residual ONOO− is decomposed by catalase in a two step reaction that involves
  formation of compound I (#11). The oxidation of NO and the decomposition of peroxynitrite
  by membrane-associated catalase causes a tight control of NO/peroxynitrite signaling.'
