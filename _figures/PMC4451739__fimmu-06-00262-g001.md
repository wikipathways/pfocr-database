caption: Complement activation in physiological conditions. (A) The alternative pathway
  is permanently active due to spontaneous transformation of bio-inactive molecule
  C3 to bioactive C3(H2O). This allows generation of C3b, which is rapidly inactivated
  by FH and FI in fluid phase or is covalently bound to the surface and then inactivated
  on host cells. (B) Classical and lectin pathway recognition molecules bind to apoptotic
  cells and together with C3b from the alternative pathway induce a low level of complement
  activation. Apoptotic cells are not lysed, but rapidly cleared by phagocytes in
  an immunologically silent manner. Host cells and plasma contain multiple regulatory
  proteins to assure that complement activation will be limited in physiological conditions.
