caption: (1) Heparanase levels were increased experimentally by transfection, by exposure
  of cells to chemotherapy, to recombinant HPSE (rHPSE) or to exosomes carrying heparanase
  cargo. (2) The increase in HPSE leads to activation of the NF-κB pathway, upregulating
  the expression of stemness genes GLI1, SOX2 and ALDH1A1. (3) Expression of stemness
  genes promotes drug resistance, tumor cell survival and proliferation. Treatment
  of cells with heparanase inhibitors or NF-κB inhibitors diminishes the cells ability
  to form spheroids and inhibits expression of stemness genes.
