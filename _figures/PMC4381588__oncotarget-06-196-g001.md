caption: Patient treated on Phase I study of DFMO tablets with 1000mg/m2 twice daily
  shows reduced tumor metabolic activity after one cycle of DFMO treatment, indicated
  by decreased 18F-FDG uptake in tumors. After starting DFMO treatment, the patient's
  tumor was still present, although showed negative PET avidity. Decreased PET activity
  is an indication of reduced glycolytic metabolism. B) Proposed pathway of DFMO effects
  on LIN28/Let-7 axis and glycolytic metabolism in NB. DFMO reversibly inhibits ODC,
  leading to reduced hypusination of eIF5A and a reversal of the LIN28/Let-7 axis.
  Changes in LIN28/Let-7 axis likely contribute to reduced glycolytic metabolic activity
  seen in NB cells treated with DFMO.
