caption: 'Wnt signaling pathways. When Frizzled receptor (FZD) is bound to its agonist
  Wnt it can activate one of the three pathways: (A) the canonical pathway in which
  the activation of disheveled (DVL) leads to the disassembly of the destruction complex;
  axin, adenomatosis polysis coli (APC), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) from
  β-catenin. This in turn increases the cytosolic level of β-catenin which is then
  translocated to the nucleus and binds to transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) activating the transcription of target genes. β-catenin
  is phosphorylated by GSK3β and degraded when there is no Wnt activation of FZD.
  Non canonical pathways include (B) Wnt-Calcium pathway in which DVL activates protein
  kinase C (PKC) leading to the release of intracellular calcium thereby activating
  a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and (C) Wnt-planar cell
  polarity pathway in which the activation of DVL signals to Rho GTPases (Rho or Rac
  or both). While Ras activation is signaled through the c-Jun amino (N)-terminal
  kinase (JNK), the activation of Rho-GTPases induces changes in the cytoskeleton.
  To date it has been found that Wnt signaling can not only lead to a direct activation
  of DVL independent of the heterotrimeric G proteins as seen in (A) but may also
  lead to a G protein-DVL dependent activation whereby DVL can bind to or become activated
  subsequently by the G proteins in the cell.'
