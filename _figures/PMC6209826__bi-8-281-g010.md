caption: We observed that chlorogenic acid showed binding affinity to interact with
  ctDNA, VEGF and VEGF receptors. Apigenin interacted with ctDNA, VEGF and VEGFR-2.
  Also, apigenin-7-O-β-glucuronide has affinity to interact with ctDNA and VEGF. On
  the other hand, luteolin-7-O-β-glucuronide interacted with ctDNA and VEGFR-1. Except
  stigmasterol, other polyphenols interacted with critical residues in the structure
  of VEGF and VEGFRs with different binding energies. However, due to the critical
  roles of VEGF and VEGFRs in metastasis and angiogenesis,, among receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) their mode of action have widely studied over the past decades. These
  proteins are responsible for inducing angiogenesis and activating of PLCγ-PKC-MAPK
  signaling pathway. The VEGF signaling pathway is triggered with the interaction
  between VEGF and its specific receptor tyrosine kinases and activating the receptors
  through auto-phosphorylation of intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain. As shown in ,
  the expression of VEGF-A can regulate the expression of other upstream or downstream
  proteins. Therefore, the inhibition of the interaction between VEGF and VEGFRs is
  an important way to prevent angiogenesis and the development of malignancy to other
  tissues. Various types of VEGF signaling cascade inhibitors including antagonistic
  VEGF mutants, soluble receptors, receptor antagonists, monoclonal antibodies, and
  deterrents of VEGF receptor function are used as anti-cancer drugs.
