caption: A gist of modules of size ≥ 5 of various types is shown through examples
  in the figure. The three columns show the module, the active subgraph (yellow nodes)
  of the module under the indicated carbon food source, and its proximal circuit diagram.
  The food source defines a minimal growth medium (environmental condition, EC). By
  ‘active subgraph’ we mean the SCC formed when only the reactions essential in that
  condition are taken into account and the non-essential reactions in that condition
  are excluded. (A) The Ribose module showing an example of a multigene enzyme, a
  trivial extension of a 4-node consumer motif. (B) The Idonate-Gluconate module showing
  an example of sequentially nested consumer motifs—a structure that effectively metabolizes
  multiple food sources located on a single pathway in the metabolic network. (C)
  The Citrulline-Ornithine-Arginine module showing an example of a module whose different
  subgrahs are active under different conditions. (D) The Cysteine module, a new multinode
  architecture. Nomenclature of nodes is as in .
