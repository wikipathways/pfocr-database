caption: Under normal conditions, lipophagy is regulated by the nutrient status of
  the cell. Nutrient abundance inhibits lipophagy, since cells have no need for free
  fatty acids (FFAs) as an energy source. During periods of nutrient deprivation,
  on the other hand, lipophagy is activated to allow cells to tap into their fat reserves.
  The dashed line denotes reduced pathway functionality due to upstream inhibition.
