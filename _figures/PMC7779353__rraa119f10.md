caption: Diagram of a signaling regulatory network that determines the AEC II differentiation
  phenotype. TGF-β1 promotes RILF via the induction of β-catenin to trigger AEC II
  transdifferentiation. After irradiation, TGF-β1 expression is induced. Subsequently,
  the suppression of E-cadherin and activation of β-catenin occur; as a result, Lin28
  transcription is induced, which in turn, maintains AEC II stemness in order to promote
  injury repair by repressing let-7 via a mechanism that involves the mutual negative
  regulation of these molecules. On the other hand, significantly increased β-catenin
  expression is capable of inducing AEC II transdifferentiation by promoting the transcription
  of several profibrotic cytokine and factor genes. This is a fibrotic network. High
  levels of let-7 miRNAs are required for AEC II to AEC I differentiation. This pathway
  may occur during normal injury repair.
