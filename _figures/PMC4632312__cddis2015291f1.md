caption: Model of Hippo/YAP involvement in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous
  system. Hippo/YAP participate in forming tight junction and cell-to-cell adhesion
  in Schwann cells. A potential injury or an environmental challenge, as the exposure
  to a 50-Hz electromagnetic field, may induce a merlin-dependent Hippo/YAP activation,
  in turn affecting cell proliferation, migration, chemotactic responsivity and differentiation.
  In principle, these mechanisms are supposed to be involved in nerve tumorigenesis
  and schwannoma development
