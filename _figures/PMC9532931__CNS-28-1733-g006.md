caption: Regulatory mechanism of hypoxic glioma‐derived EVs in glioma. Hypoxic glioma‐derived
  EVs harboring miR‐10b‐5p into macrophages reduced NEDD4L expression, thus diminishing
  the promotion of NEDD4L on the ubiquitylation and degradation of PIK3CA and increasing
  PIK3CA expression to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. In this way, M2 polarization
  of macrophages was promoted, ultimately potentiating the proliferation, migration,
  and invasion of glioma cells
