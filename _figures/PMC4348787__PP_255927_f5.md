caption: Early leaf infection (1–4 ) induces the expression of Z. tritici genes involved
  in the β-oxidation of lipids and fatty acids and up-regulation of the glyoxylate
  pathway. Red coloring indicates up-regulation, and no shading represents no significant
  change relative to the expression levels in  culture (adjusted P < 0.05). FA, Fatty
  acids; PM, plasma membrane.
