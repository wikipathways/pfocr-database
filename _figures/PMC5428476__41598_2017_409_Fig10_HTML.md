caption: A model depicting the involvement of autophagy-lysosomal system in apigenin-induced
  degradation of β-catenin during Wnt signaling. In the presence of Wnt, Wnt ligand
  binds to its cognate receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6. Dishevelled (DVL)
  moves from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and associates with Frizzled (step
  1). Axin complex, including β-catenin and GSK3β, will also be translocated to the
  cell membrane and bind to phosphorylated LRP5/6 through Axin (step 2). β-catenin
  is stabilized and accumulated in the cytoplasm (step 3), and then enters the nucleus
  to associate with TCF/LEF and activates the expression of Wnt-responsive genes (step
  4). Apigenin treatment suppresses the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and induces the
  sequestration and degradation of β-catenin inside the lysosome (step 5), contributing
  to down-regulation of β-catenin during Wnt signaling.
