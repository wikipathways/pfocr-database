caption: 'Schematic representation of the tyrosine integrated pathway between the
  pea aphid (light green rectangle) and its primary endosymbiont (light beige rectangle).
  Enzymes are indicated with their Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers at the corresponding
  reactions: red, pea aphid enzyme-coding genes; blue, Buchnera enzyme-coding genes;
  purple, Buchnera missing genes. Single line and double line arrows represent metabolic
  reactions and transport steps, respectively. Solid arrows indicate annotated events
  whereas dotted arrows refer to possible events. Abbreviations: Phe, phenylalanine;
  Tyr, tyrosine. Figure adapted from Rabatel et al.'
