caption: 'Biological network analysis of differentially expressed proteins using GeneSpring
  identified deregulated BDNF pathway: Nineteen proteins involved in the BDNF pathway
  were differentially expressed including the downregulation of the BDNF receptor
  protein – NTRK2. Proteins involved in BDNF mediated lamellipodia formation and neurite
  outgrowth were downregulated whereas proteins involved in BDNF mediated synaptic
  plasticity were overexpressed.'
