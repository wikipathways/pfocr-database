caption: A proposed model of the nitrate signal pathway for integration of the nitrate-CPK-NLP
  and NRT1.1-SPX-NLP modules. Plasma membrane-localized NRT1.1 functions as a nitrate
  sensor in response to nitrate provision under both high and low concentrations.
  NRT1.1 is phosphorylated by CBL1/9-CIPK23 under low-nitrate conditions and then
  triggers a low-level nitrate response. In response to high nitrate provision, through
  Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent pathway, nitrate triggers a high-level nitrate
  response. The import nitrate signal through NRT1.1 activates PLC activity and thereby
  increases the content of 1,4,5-inositol triphosphate (IP3) in the cytosol, resulting
  in the opening of Ca2+ channels and the accumulation of Ca2+ in the cytosol. Thus,
  the Ca2+ signal is decoded by CPKs, which in turn phosphorylate the NLPs to promote
  their nuclear retentions and subsequently the activation of downstream nitrate response.
  For the Ca2+-independent pathway during nitrate signal cascade amplification, NRT1.1
  recruits NBIP1 to mediate the proteasome degradation of SPXs and, therefore, initiates
  the release of NLPs and promotes the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling to activate nitrate
  response.
