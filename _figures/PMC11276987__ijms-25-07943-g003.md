caption: Maladaptive UPR and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated inflammation.
  Under ER stress, the UPR is activated, and this leads to activation of the three
  principal UPR signaling transmembrane receptor proteins, including IRE-1, PERK,
  and ATF6. Activation of the IRE-1 leads to the splicing of the mRNA of a transcription
  factor XBP1 and subsequent expression of sXPB1, a highly active transcription factor
  for the release of ER-resident enzymes and molecular chaperones. As a result, it
  leads to activation of NF-κB and CHOP, resulting in increased expression of proinflammatory
  gene products. Likewise, activated IRE-1 recruits TRAF2, and this complex causes
  activation of downstream signaling of kinases, including JNK and NF-κB, which induce
  production of inflammatory cytokines and trigger inflammation. These inflammatory
  kinases then phosphorylate and activate downstream mediators of inflammation. Phosphorylation
  of PERK/eIF2α downstream signaling pathway results in uncoupling of NF-κB from IkB.
  As a result, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus, where it activates expression
  of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a, resulting
  in persistent inflammatory response. On the other hand, autophosphorylation of PERK
  initiates activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), which further undergoes
  phosphorylation, resulting in translational attenuation of protein synthesis. Similarly,
  this downstream phosphorylation of eIF2α leads to increased expression of ATF4 and
  translocation into the nucleus, where it binds to the UPRE, resulting in transcriptional
  modification of CHOP, a proapoptotic gene transcription factor that initiates inflammation
  as well as apoptosis. IRE-1 recruits TRAF2 and causes activation of downstream signaling
  of kinases, including JNK and NF-κB, inducing the production of inflammatory cytokines.
  PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, which leads to the activation of NF-κB and CHOP to further
  promote the expression of the inflammatory gene. ER stress leads to dissociation
  of TRAF from TRAF2-procaspase 12 complex, which is located on the ER membrane, leading
  to activation of caspase 12. At the same time, IRE1–JNK complex recruits TRAF2 leading
  to the formation of the IRE1–JNK–TRAF2 complex. The ATF6 pathway also activates
  NF-κB, further intensifying the expression of inflammatory genes, which secrete
  more cytokines. Reproduced from Amen et al. (2019) [14]
