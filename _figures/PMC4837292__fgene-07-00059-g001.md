caption: (A) Components of the hypothesized Endothelin signaling pathway. Constitutively
  active mutations found in GNAQ and GNA11 in human melanocytic lesions are boxed
  in red. (B) We hypothesize that Schwann cell precursor derived melanocytes transmit
  endothelin signals through Gαq/11. Schwann cell precursor derived melanocytes are
  also susceptible to developing melanocytic lesions when either GNAQ or GNA11 are
  mutated to their constitutively active forms. This melanomagenic pathway gives rise
  to non-epithelial associated lesions. Other G protein alpha subunits may transmit
  endothelin signals in epithelial associated melanomas.
