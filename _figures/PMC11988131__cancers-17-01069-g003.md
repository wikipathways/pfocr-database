caption: Dual function of PHLDA3 as both an apoptosis inducer and inhibitor. (A) Under
  hypoxic conditions, p53 is activated through phosphorylation. This activation of
  p53 subsequently induces the expression of PHLDA3. Once expressed, PHLDA3 inactivates
  AKT, leading to the induction of apoptosis. (B) Upon ER stress, XBP1 upregulates
  PHLDA3, which suppresses pro-inflammatory pathways by inhibiting the expression
  of NFκB and iNOS, reducing the production of inflammatory mediators like nitric
  oxide (NO). Additionally, PHLDA3 helps alleviate oxidative stress by promoting the
  mRNA expression of key antioxidant genes, such as Gpx1 and Srxn1, which regulate
  ROS levels. Through these mechanisms, PHLDA3 supports β cell survival by preventing
  apoptosis induced by inflammation and oxidative damage
