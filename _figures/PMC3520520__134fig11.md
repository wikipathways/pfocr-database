caption: ETC-1002 activates AMPK and inhibits ACL to regulate lipid and carbohydrate
  metabolism. In liver, ETC-1002 free acid activates the AMPK pathway, which reduces
  the activities of key rate-limiting enzymes of lipid (HMGR and ACC) and carbohydrate
  (PEPCK and G6Pase) synthesis. ETC-1002 is also converted to ETC-1002-CoA by ACS
  and directly inhibits ACL. Inhibition of ACL results in a reduction in cytosolic
  acetyl-CoA, a common substrate supporting fatty acid and sterol synthesis, as well
  as reduces HMG-CoA and malonyl-CoA levels. AMPK-dependent inhibitory ACC phosphorylation
  and reduced enzyme substrate decrease malonyl-CoA levels, deinhibit CPT-1, and increase
  fatty acid mitochondrial transport for β-oxidation. The combination of AMPK activation
  and ACL inhibition reduces lipid and glucose synthesis from the substrate and signals
  transduction levels. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase; β-Ox,
  β-oxidation; CPT-1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1; G6Pase, glucose 6-phosphatase;
  HMGR, HMG-CoA reductase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid.
papertitle: AMP-activated protein kinase and ATP-citrate lyase are two distinct molecular
  targets for ETC-1002, a novel small molecule regulator of lipid and carbohydrate
  metabolism.
