caption: A diagram of Hh signaling in mammalian cells. SMO is the key signal transducer
  of the Hh pathway. In the absence of the Hh ligands, Hh receptor PTC is localized
  in the cilium to inhibit SMO signaling. Co-receptors of Hh include CDO (cell adhesion
  molecule-related/down-regulated by oncogenes), Brother of CDO (BOC), Gas1, Glypican
  3 (GPC3) and GPC5. Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF1) can also regulate Hh signaling
  through association with CDO, BOC or GPC5. Gli molecules are processed with help
  of Su (Fu)/KIF7, β-TRCP molecules into repressor forms, which turn off the Hh signaling
  pathway. Other negative regulators of Gli molecules include Rab23, Protein kinase
  A (PKA), Suppressor of Fused (SuFu), tumor suppressor SNF5, Culin 3 (Cul3), p66β
  and Itchy E3 ubiquitin ligase (Itch) through regulation Gli protein modifications,
  nuclear-cytoplasm shuttling as well as transcriptional activities. In the presence
  of Hh, PTC is shuttled out of cilium and is unable to inhibit SMO. The ciliary localization
  of SMO is thought to require β-arrestin 2 (βArr2) and G protein coupled receptor
  kinase 2 (GRK2). Hh reception promotes SMO conformational changes to form dimers/oligomers.
  Gli molecules are then processed to active forms (GliA), which will activate the
  Hh target genes. KIF and SuFu can inhibit this process. Mycbp and protein kinase
  C isoform τ/λ (PKτ/λ) positively regulate Gli transcriptional activity. Positive
  regulators are in red, negative regulators are in blue and target genes are in pink.
  KIF7 can function (in black) as a negative regulator or a positive regulator. The
  interacting pathways with the Hh pathway are in green. Although the role of cilium
  for Hh signaling during embryonic development is well established, cancer cells
  generally lack cilia. It has been demonstrated that lack of cilia prevents development
  of BCCs in mice, it is not clear whether this is true for all other types of Hh
  signaling-associated cancer (color figure online)
