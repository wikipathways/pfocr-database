caption: The role of OTUB2 in the Hippo pathway. OTUB2 was SUMOylated in the case
  of RAS gene mutation and interacted with the SIM of YAP/TAZ, thereby reducing the
  presence of the K48 polyubiquitin chain on YAP/TAZ. Undergraded YAP/TAZ entered
  the nucleus to stimulate the expression of downstream genes, causing a series of
  reactions that were not conducive to the normal physiological function of the human
  body.
