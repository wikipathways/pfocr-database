caption: Pathway analyses for mutant D9 and wild-type D. tertiolecta. Inositol phosphate
  metabolism, ascorbate acid synthesis, citrate cycle, pyruvate metabolism, and fatty
  acid biosynthesis pathways in D. tertiolecta constructed based on the information
  from C. reinhardtii and the transcript abundance of enzymes in D. tertiolecta. Key
  components are represented in black rectangle boxes. The green color indicates that
  the respective gene is down-regulated, and red color indicates up-regulation. The
  corresponding pathways are also represented in the yellow filled circles
