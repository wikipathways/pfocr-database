caption: 'mTOR signals through two functionally distinct complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2.
  In addition to mTOR and several other components, mTORC1 and mTORC2 contain distinct
  adaptor molecules raptor and rictor, respectively. mTOR senses and integrates various
  extracellular signals such as growth factor, cytokines, immune receptor, amino acids
  and intracellular signals including stress and energy levels. The Small GTPase Rheb
  in its GTP bound active state directly activates mTORC1. TSC1/2 complex acts as
  a negative regulator of mTORC1 via the GAP activity of TSC2 to RheB. Growth factors
  and antigen receptors signal through the PI3K-PDK-Akt pathway to activate mTORC1
  and mTORC2. In contrast, nutrients activate mTORC1 through Rag GTPases. Cellular
  energy deficits can take a direct route to suppress mTORC1 activation through LKB1
  and AMPK, which promote TSC2 activity. mTORC1 phosphorylate multiple targeting proteins
  such as S6K1, 4E-BP’s, Lipin1, CAD (carbamoylphosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase,
  and dihydroorotase), and 5’-hosphoribosyl-1’-pyrophosphate (PRPP) that promote anabolic
  processes such as protein synthesis, lipid/sterol synthesis and de novo pyrimidine
  synthesis. mTORC1 also prevents autophagy indirectly by inhibiting AMPK through
  direct phosphorylation of ULK1. Although PI3K is important for mTORC2 activation,
  the exact mechanisms that activate mTORC2 remain elusive. mTORC2 also phosphorylates
  multiple intracellular signaling molecules such as Akt at the serine 473 residue,
  PKCα at S657, PKCθ at S660/676, and SGK at S422 to regulate cell survival, nutrient
  uptake, cytoskeletal organization, and Th differentiation.'
