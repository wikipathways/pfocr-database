caption: 'The summary of mammalian Sia metabolism and the Neu5Ac-activated signaling
  pathway in cardiomyocyte. Legend: In eukaryotic cells, Neu5Ac is synthesized in
  cytoplasm and transferred to nucleus for cytosine 5′-monophosphate (CMP)-Neu5Ac
  synthesis by CMP-Neu5Ac activating acid. Then, it is transmitted to Golgi apparatus
  to form glycoconjugates by ST, which is subsequently secreted or delivered to cell
  surface. N-Acetyl-Neuraminic Acid (Neu5Ac) as a signaling molecule to trigger myocardial
  injury via activation of Rho/ROCK-JNK/ERK signaling pathway in acute myocardial
  infarction'
