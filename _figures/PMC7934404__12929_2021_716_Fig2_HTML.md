caption: GBPs regulate host antiviral innate immune signaling pathways. a GBP4 negatively
  regulates IFN-I by impairing TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination and transactivation of
  IRF7. GBP5 represses replication of IAV by interacting with the NF-κB-essential
  modulator complex to promote IFN and proinflammatory factors expression. b GBP7
  impedes NF-κB translocation to the nucleus by preventing the phosphorylation of
  IκBα and inhibits the JAK–STAT signaling pathway by attenuating the phosphorylation
  of STAT1 and STAT2. P phosphate, Ub ubiquitin
