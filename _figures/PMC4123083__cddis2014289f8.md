caption: Model of the miR-203-mediated regulation network for skeletal muscle cell
  proliferation and differentiation. miR-203 inhibits the mRNA and protein level of
  c-JUN and MEF2C, respectively. The inhibitory role of c-JUN in cell proliferation
  is p53 dependent. MEF2C is involved in many muscle-specific gene transcription networks,
  and MEF2C can interact with MAML1, Notch3 and the p38 MAPK pathway to promote muscle
  differentiation. The dashed lines represent possible regulatory roles of MEF2C and
  c-JUN based on previous studies
