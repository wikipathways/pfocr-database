caption: The PS are taken up by the malignant cells and populate in various organelles
  like mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Light of suitable wavelength activates
  the PS which in turn causes release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria; leading
  to the activation of the caspase cascade. Pro-apoptotic factors like p53 are activated,
  thus inducing apoptosis. Formation of ROS may also lead to necrosis or autophagy.
  As shown earlier, the Hippo signaling pathway can be inhibited leading to inhibition
  in cell growth.
