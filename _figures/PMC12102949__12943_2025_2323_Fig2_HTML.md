caption: 'Illustrates Various Molecular Mechanisms Facilitating the Formation and
  Survival of DTPs under Targeted Therapy and Immunotherapy. A Genomic Abnormality
  (top left): Drug-induced epigenetic plasticity and DNA instability contribute to
  alterations in chromatin status within DTPs, thereby promoting the generation of
  and subsequent tumor recurrence. In detail, epigenetic plasticity includes histone
  modifications, DNA methylation and RNA epigenetics, while DNA instability includes
  polymerase, LINE- 1 and APOBEC3. B Transcriptional Regulation (top right): DTPs
  upregulate various TFs and TCs, as well as initiate chromatin remodeling via SWI/SNF
  complexes, triggering unique transcriptome shift and leading to a phenotypic transition
  to DTP. C Metabolic Remodeling (bottom right): To endure harsh environments created
  by drug toxicity conditions, DTPs rely on metabolic reprogramming, particularly
  enhanced mitochondrial oxidative respiration, intracellular antioxidant pathways
  and ACh metabolism. The core components of mitochondrial oxidative respiration are
  FAM and OXPHOS, which generate substantial energy reserves essential for sustaining
  DTP viability. DTPs overexpress and activate NRF2, ALDH and GPX4, which endow them
  with robust antioxidant stress resistance to safeguard against oxidative stress.
  D Signaling Pathway Activation (bottom left): Drugs initiate the activation of survival
  signaling pathways (PI3 K/AKT/mTOR, RTK/RAS, ER stress) as well as developmental
  signaling pathways (FGF, Notch, WNT/β-catenin) within DTPs, ultimately enhancing
  their survival. Image made with BioRender.com'
