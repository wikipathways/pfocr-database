caption: Functions of NLRC5-dependent domains. uCARD of NLRC5 possesses intrinsic
  transcriptional activity that enhances MHC I and II transcriptional activation,
  increasing antigen-presenting capacity of cells. This enables CD8 + and CD4 + T
  cells to recognise and eliminate aberrant cells. In addition, uCARD recruits E3
  ligase CUL2, which catalyses K48-linked polyubiquitination of DENV NS3, which is
  recognised by TOLLIP receptor and undergoes autophagic degradation to inhibit viral
  infection. The NACHT structural domain of NLRC5 binds to LBD of PPARγ and promotes
  PPARγ activity. PPARγ is, in turn, recruited to promoter of NLRC5 to drive transcription
  of NLRC5. The NLRC5–PPARγ positive feedback regulates expression of downstream genes,
  including PCNA, cyclin D1, α-SMA, myosin, and calponin, which ultimately inhibits
  VSMC proliferation, migration, and dedifferentiation and suppresses neointimal formation.
  In addition, NLRC5 is involved in regulating its target, FABP4, through interaction
  of NACHT and PPARγ. Sin3A can coregulate and bind to uCARD, contributing to synergistic
  transcriptional regulation of FABP4 by NACHT and PPARγ, promoting adipogenesis.
  NLRC5 interacts with IKKα/β to form large complex IKKα/β/NLRC5. The binding depends
  on LRR domain of NLRC5 and KD amino-terminal structural domain of IKKβ. The LRR
  domain of NLRC5 inhibits activation of NF-κB by blocking phosphorylation of IKK
  complex. NLRC5 regulates type I IFN signalling pathway in non-LRR domain-independent
  manner. uCARD specifically binds to RIG-I and MDA5 to regulate phosphorylation of
  IRF3, modulating type I IFN response and further regulating anti-influenza virus
  activity. Additionally, interaction between STAT3 and NLRC5 enhances transcription
  of Ang2 and cell cycle protein D1 (CCND1), which are involved in angiogenesis, a
  process that requires structural integrity of uCARD and NACHT. NLRC5 binds to components
  of RFX factor complex assembled on W/S-X-Y motif in form of MHC enhancers, inducing
  MHC I gene expression. This process requires all three domains of NLRC5 to come
  together
