caption: Metabolism of fatty acids. Fatty acids are oxidized to form acetyl-Co A,
  which is then converted to citrate by the activity of citrate synthase. Acetyl-Co
  A can be also produced by the mitochondrial matrix and further oxidized in the TCA
  cycle. Through FAS, the TCA cycle intermediate citrate can be converted to free
  fatty acids (FFA), which can then be transported from the extracellular environment
  via the FAO pathway to produce acetyl-Co A, fueling the TCA cycle to produce significantly
  more energy in the form of ATP.
