caption: Overview of H2S synthesizing reactions. A. H2S can be synthesized by the
  transsulfuration pathway enzymes, CBS and CSE or by the cysteine catabolism pathway
  enzymes, CAT/AAT and MST. The canonical transsulfuration reactions catalyzed by
  CBS and CSE results in the conversion of serine and homocysteine to cysteine. However,
  these enzymes can also utilize cysteine and homocysteine to generate H2S. Cystathionine,
  an intermediate in the canonical transsulfuration pathway competes with cysteine
  for binding to CSE, thus inhibiting H2S synthesis (red dotted line). MST is a sulfurtransferase,
  which catalyzes the transfer of the sulfur atom from mercaptopyruvate to an active
  site cysteine thiol to form a cysteine persulfide. The latter, in the presence of
  reductants can release H2S. αKB denotes α-ketobytyrate. B. The first step in the
  reactions catalyzed by CBS, CSE and CAT/AAT is the formation of an external aldimine
  via a Schiff base linkage between PLP and the amino acid. CBS can bind either serine
  or cysteine, CSE can bind cysteine or homocysteine, while CAT/AAT can bind aspartate
  or cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) in addition to cysteine at this position. C. CBS
  has a regulatory heme cofactor that is ligated by His65 and Cys52 (human protein
  numbering). One electron reduction to the ferrous state promotes binding of exogenous
  ligands such as CO or NO leading to inactive enzyme. The heme harbors nitrite reductase
  activity and forms nitrosyl heme, which is 5-coordinate. The broken line to His65
  indicates that this residue serves as a ligand when CO but not when NO is bound.
  The ferrous nitrosyl and ferrous carbonyl forms of CBS are readily converted to
  the ferric state in the presence of O2.
