caption: (A) A systematic approach is necessary to categorize lipids as beneficial
  or lipotoxic. Bioactive lipid species have different roles in cellular responses,
  including beneficial roles in lipid homeostasis through the regulation of proliferation,
  storage, energy production, cell signaling, and lipid membrane composition. Lipids
  play a lipotoxic role by influencing cell death, ER stress, and ROS production.
  It is important to understand which lipid species maintain metabolic homeostasis
  and which disrupt essential cellular functions leading to metabolic disorders. (B)
  The role and structure of lipids are determined by uptake, synthesis, storage and
  consumption across different cellular organelles. In the anabolic pathway, lipids
  are taken to the ER and cytosol for lipid synthesis. For catabolism, lipids are
  transmitted to the mitochondria and peroxisomes. These pathways generate fatty acids,
  storage lipids, such as cholesterol, and triglycerides, signaling lipids containing
  N-acetylethanolamines (oleoylethanolamide) and cholesterol-derived bile acids. Membrane
  lipids include glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Fatty acids are building
  blocks of all lipids, and palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid,
  arachidonic acid, docosahexaneoic acid are illustrated as examples for saturated,
  monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FAs. ABCD1, ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily
  D Member 1; ACAT, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase; ATGL, adipose triglyceride
  lipase; CPT, carnitine palmitoyl-transferase; DGAT1, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase
