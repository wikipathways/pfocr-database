caption: 'The p53 signaling pathway: In normal conditions (black arrows), p53 is maintained
  at very low levels. p53 is downregulated by MDM2 (murine double minute 2) and MDMX
  (Mdm4 p53 binding protein homolog mouse). MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which
  controls p53 proteasomal degradation. MDMX lacks the E3 ligase function and suppresses
  the transcriptional activity of p53, which is independent of MDM2. It also forms
  a heterodimeric complex with MDM2 and stimulates MDM2-mediated p53 degradation.
  The expression of MDM2 is controlled by p53 itself through a negative feedback loop.
  In stress conditions (red arrows) p53 responds to a range of environmental and intracellular
  stresses, including agents that cause DNA damage, ultraviolet radiation, and oxidative
  stress.In damage response are activated several kinases (ataxia telangiectasia mutated
  (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR)), which cause conformational
  changes in p53, MDMX, and MDM2 blocking their interactions and resulting in p53
  stabilization. Activated p53 protein subsequently transactivates expression of several
  target genes, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein p21WAF1, which
  induce G1/S arrest, proapoptotic genes particularly those involved in the mitochondrial
  pathway of apoptosis, such as BAX, and genes involved in DNA repair, such as GADD45/PCNA.'
