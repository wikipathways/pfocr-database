caption: Schematic illustration for the different targets or pathways involved in
  the antidepressant-like effect of T. avellanedae taking into account present results
  and previous literature findings. As described previously by Freitas et al.,T. avellanedae
  can exert an antidepressant-like effect through the increase monoamines availability.
  The present study provides evidence that the antidepressant-like effect of T. avellanedae
  is dependent, at least in part, on the inhibition of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation;
  inhibition of NO synthesis, and reduction of cGMP levels. 5-HT, serotonin; 5-HTt,
  serotonin transporter; Ca2+, calcium; cGMP, cyclic guanosine 3′5′-monophosphate;
  DA, dopamine; DAt, dopamine transporter; GMP, guanosine 3′5′-monophosphate; GTP,
  guanosine-triphosphate; L-DOPA, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; NE, noradrenaline;
  NEt, noradrenaline transporter; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; NO, nitric
  oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; PDE5, phosphodiesterase 5; sGC, soluble guanylate
  cyclase; Trp, tryptofan; Tyr, tyrosine. Color images available online at www.liebertpub.com/jmf
