caption: Molecular mechanisms of phase separation in cGAS-STING-mediated innate immune
  responses. a Upon sensing double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from various sources such
  as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), cytosolic DNA, or foreign DNA, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase
  (cGAS) becomes activated. Activated cGAS produces cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which
  then binds to the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) located on the Golgi apparatus.
  This binding initiates the recruitment of TBK1 and leads to the phosphorylation
  and activation of IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3 translocates to the nucleus to induce
  the expression of Type I interferon. Various factors, including RNA-binding proteins
  (e.g., G3BP1), oleic acid, Spermine, and proteins such as PCBP2, BAF, and TREX1,
  can influence the phase separation of cGAS and STING. STING condensates and NF2
  mutation-mediated condensates operate to suppress the innate immune response. b
  The Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) tegument protein ORF52/VP22 competitively
  binds to DNA alongside cGAS, forming phase-separated condensates that evade immune
  detection by preventing cGAS-DNA condensate formation. During SARS-CoV-2 infection,
  stimulated mitochondria release mitochondrial DNA sensed by cGAS. However, the SARS-CoV-2
  nucleocapsid protein sequesters cGAS, forming phase separation with G3BP1 and DNA,
  thereby inhibiting innate immune signaling activation. c Upon infection with DNA/RNA
  viruses, cGAS-DNA phase separation activates the cGAS-STING pathway, leading to
  IRF3/IRF7 activation. SIRT1 deacetylates the IRF3/IRF7 dimer to further promote
  innate immune signaling
