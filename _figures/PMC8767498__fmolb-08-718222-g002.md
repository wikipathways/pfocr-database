caption: Co-infection with oral microbes strengths the pathogenicity of respiratory
  pathogens. Usually, respiratory pathogen infection (black arrow) could induce the
  Th cells to produce cytokines, then lead to the differentiation, activation and
  recruitment of effector lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages. These immune cells
  not only bring about inflammation, but also activate the death receptor apoptotic
  pathway and finally lead to apoptosis. Once oral microbes (including oral streptococci,
  P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia,
  C. albicans) inhaled into airways co-infect respiratory epithelium with respiratory
  pathogens (red arrow), the levels of multiple cytokines are elevated including TNF-α,
  IL-1ß, IL-6, as well as those signaling pathway related with apoptosis of respiratory
  epithelial cells. Besides, some oral microbes can promote the virulence of respiratory
  pathogens, for example, via increasing the virulence factor production or forming
  pathogenic partnerships. As a result, aggravated inflammation and expanded apoptosis
  is observed.
