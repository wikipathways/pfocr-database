caption: Differentially expressed proteins (derived from the lists shown in Tables
  ,  and ) are shown in a circular layout (upregulated proteins in red, downregulated
  proteins in green and non-coloured molecules predicted by the software to have interactions).
  Six statistically significantly related functions (pink cog) and diseases (blue
  cross) are displayed at points around the central circle. The top ID associated
  network identified by IPA for each of the muscle types is shown in this figure;
  gastrocnemius (A), soleus (B) and heart (C). For gastrocnemius, the most significant
  ID associated network functions (IPA top network score = 53) are skeletal and muscular
  system development and function, cardiovascular disease, organismal injury and abnormalities
  (IPA statistically significant diseases and functions sub-categories frequently
  show cancers of various kinds). For soleus, the most significant ID associated network
  functions (IPA top network score = 44) are skeletal and muscular system development
  and function, cardiovascular system development and function, embryonic development.
  For heart, the most significant ID associated network functions (IPA top network
  score = 21) were skeletal and muscular system development and function, cardiovascular
  system development and function, cellular assembly and organization.
