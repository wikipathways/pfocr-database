caption: Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to several antibiotics and can acquire
  mutations and exogenous genes that confer resistance to additional drugs. The main
  mechanisms of antibiotic resistance are shown. In Enterococcus faecium, resistance
  to ampicillin occurs through the production of penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5),
  which has low affinity for β-lactams. Enterococci exhibit intrinsic low-level resistance
  to aminoglycosides such as streptomycin or gentamicin owing to low uptake of these
  highly polar molecules. High-level resistance results from the acquisition of aminoglycoside-modifying
  enzymes or, for streptomycin, can result from ribosomal mutations that result in
  altered target binding. Resistance to the glycopeptide vancomycin occurs through
  a well-characterized mechanism of reduced vancomycin-binding affinity, involving
  alterations in the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway. Resistance of Enterococcus spp.
  to the streptogramin quinupristin–dalfopristin (Q–D) involves several pathways,
  including drug modification (by virginiamycin acetyltransferase (Vat)), drug inactivation
  (through virginiamycin B lysase (Vgb)) and drug efflux (via the ATP-binding cassette
  protein macrolide streptogramin resistance protein (MsrC)). Resistance to the oxazolidinone
  linezolid is rare, but the most common pathway involves mutation in the 23S ribosomal
  RNA ribosome-binding site. Resistance of E. faecalis to the lipopetide daptomycin
  has been shown to involve altered interactions with the cell membrane and requires
  the membrane protein LiaF and enzymes involved in phospholipid metabolism, such
  as a member of the glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase family (GdpD) and
  cardiolipin synthase (Cls).
