caption: 'Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in patients with wild-type and
  mutant BRAF and KRAS. On the right side of the figure, the normal epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is characterized by the binding of growth factor
  to the EGFR that leads to regular activation of transcription factors and cell-cycle
  progression; On the left side, mutations in BRAF or KRAS, which are mutually exclusive,
  cause the activation of the EGFR pathway and therefore an abnormal increase of nuclear
  signaling and no response to monoclonal antibodies. EGFR: Epidermal growth factor
  receptor; MEK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MAPK: Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; MoAb: monoclonal antibodies; WT: Wild type.'
