caption: The TGF-β and BMP signaling pathway in chondrocytes. When TGF-β or BMPs bind
  to type II receptor, type I receptor is transphosphorylated, which activate Smad-dependent
  signaling or non-Smad-dependent signaling (MAPK signaling). In the Smad-dependent
  signaling, R-Smads (the TGF-β-specific R-Smads is Smad2, 3 and the BMP-specific
  R-Smads is Smad1, 5, 8) are phosphorylated, and then it forms complexes with Co-Smad
  (Smad4). Next the complexes transfer into nucleus to regulate the expression of
  Sox9 and Runx2. MAPK signaling can phosphorylate Runx2 to increase its transcription
  activity, and it also can activate JNK and p38 kinases to change the balance between
  Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8.
