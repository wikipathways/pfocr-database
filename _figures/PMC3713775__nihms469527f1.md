caption: NF-κB consists of three subunits, p50, p65 and IκB. IκB is a negative regulator
  of NF-κB activity, as it can tightly bind to the other two subunits of NF-κB in
  the cytoplasm and prevent them from translocating into the nucleus. miR-30e* directly
  targets IκB and suppresses its expression, which leads to the hyper-activation of
  NF-κB and promotes its translocation into the nucleus to regulate the expression
  of downstream genes. So a NF-κB/IκB negative feedback loop is formed by miR-30e*
  to constitutively activate the NF-κB pathway. Besides, polycomb protein (EZH2, SUZ12)
  can epigenetically down-regulate the expression of miR-31 gene. Through targeting
  NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK), miR-31 negatively modulates the function of NF-κB signal
  pathway. On the other hand, NF-κB acts as a transcription factor, binding to the
  promoter region of miR-301a, and elevates its expression level accordingly. Moreover,
  miR-301a directly targets NF-κB repressing factor (NKRF) and further promotes the
  activation of NF-κB. Thus, a positive feedback loop of miR-301a, NKRF and NF-κB
  is formed to maintain the persistence of NF-κB activation. During the DNA damage
  response induced by ionizing radiation or UV lights, ATM interplays with NF-κB in
  the nucleus and plays a critical role in the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway.
