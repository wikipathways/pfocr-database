caption: (a) Reaction scheme of PKS modules processing their native full-length synthetic
  substrates 1, 2, 3 to the corresponding macrolactones. Substrate 2 is generated
  by in situ photolysis of the 2-nitrobenzyloxymethyl ether (NBOM) protected native
  hexaketide. (b) Domain architecture of the PKS modules used in this study and the
  native macrolactone products from each respective biosynthetic pathway. (c) Table
  of percent conversion for reactions with substrates 1–3. The product yield for each
  PKS module processing its native substrate is underlined. Conversion to each macrolactone
  was monitored by HPLC with data represented as the mean ± standard deviation where
  n = 3. ND = not detected.
