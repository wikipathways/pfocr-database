caption: The pathway for phosphatidic acid (PA) formation in B. subtilis (Gram-positive).
  The acyl-ACP end products of type II fatty acid synthesis are converted to acyl-PO4
  by the soluble protein PlsX. These acyl-ACPs are feedback inhibitors of type II
  fatty acid synthesis (FASII), and it is thought that regulation at the PlsX step
  coordinates fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis. Acyl-PO4 then serves as a substrate
  for PlsY, an integral membrane protein that acylates the 1-position of glycerol-P.
  The LPA is converted to phosphatidic acid by the acyl-ACP-specific PlsC. B. subtilis
  has two acyl-CoA synthetases to convert exogenous fatty acids to acyl-CoA and a
  fatty acid β-oxidation system; however, the acyl-CoA derived from exogenous fatty
  acid is not used as an acyl donor in glycerolipid synthesis.
