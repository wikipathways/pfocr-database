caption: Schematic illustration of the Wingless/Int-1 (Wnt) signaling pathway. The
  Wnt signaling pathway and its components reported to be mutated in metabolic bone
  disease are reported. Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway leads to an increase
  in bone mass. Wnt ligands interact with co-receptor LRP5/6 and frizzled (FZD) to
  activate the Wnt signaling pathway. The inhibition of Wnt signaling is mediated
  by extracellular factors, such as sclerostin (SOST) and Dickkopf-related protein
  1 (DKK-1) and leads to bone mass decrease. DKK-1 binds to the LRP5/6 co-receptor,
  thereby preventing activation by Wnt ligands. Inhibitory transmembrane protein LRP4,
  which is a SOST-interacting protein, is recruited and the Kremen proteins, which
  are high-affinity DKK-1 receptors, cooperate with DKK-1 to decrease Wnt signaling.
  In addition, secreted frizzled-related protein (SFRP) inhibits the canonical Wnt
  pathway by sequestering Wnt ligands. Mutations in Wnt signaling components result
  in pathway activation/inhibition. For example, loss-of-function mutations affecting
  SOST and LRP4 lead to Wnt pathway activation causing bone tissue sclerosteosis,
  as well as loss-of-function mutations of LRP5 and the WNT1 ligand result in Wnt
  signaling pathway inhibition leading to osteoporosis disorders.
