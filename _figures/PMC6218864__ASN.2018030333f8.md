caption: Simplified schematic of the effects of nephron-specific Jab1 deletion on
  the CUL3-KLHL3-WNK pathway. Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases cycle between an “inactive”
  unneddylated and an “active” neddylated state. Left, when in homeostasis, NEDD8
  (N) is removed from CUL3 by CSN and the substrate, WNK4, is ubiquitylated and degraded
  via interaction with CUL3 through the adaptor KLHL3, preventing NCC phosphorylation.
  Right, in KS-Jab1−/− mice, disturbed interaction of CUL3 with the CSN causes more
  neddylation of CUL3 and abnormal ubiquitylation and degradation of KLHL3, leading
  to an increase in WNK4 abundance. Phosphorylation of NCC is increased through downstream
  kinases SPAK/OSR1; however, deletion of Jab1 causes a decrease in NCC abundance
  that is independent from the WNK-SPAK pathway.
