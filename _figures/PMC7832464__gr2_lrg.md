caption: Progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammation. (A) Mild infection
  and innate immunity responses. SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication may cause primary
  inflammation through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by cellular
  damage and ADAM17-mediated shedding of sACE2, and activation of the interferon pathway.
  Mild infection possibly occurs before seroconversion and the production of neutralizing
  IgG. ADE response does not appear in this stage and subsequent events including
  ACE2 shedding and down-regulation, neutralizing activity of soluble ACE2, low level
  of inflammation, recruitment of cytotoxic immune cells, activation of innate immune
  responses, and activity of tissue-resident macrophages may lead to final viral clearance
  and recovery. (B) Severe infection and cytokine storm. Increased viral replication
  leads to the upregulation of inflammation and tissue damage, which recruits more
  immune cells to the infected area. This coincides with seroconversion and development
  of neutralizing antibodies, resulted in FcR-mediated ADE response upon generation
  of antibody-virus complexes. ADE response could cause a cytokine storm and may lead
  to severe lymphopenia via increased infiltration of lymphocytes and finally causes
  severe damage to immune cells and infected tissue.
