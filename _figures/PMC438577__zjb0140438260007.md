caption: Model of SPI2 signaling. Different colors indicate different two-component
  systems. The primary signals are detected by the EnvZ sensor kinase and are independent
  of acetyl phosphate signaling. PhoPQ is unlikely to directly regulate SPI2. Question
  marks indicate unknown phosphorylation states of response regulators. Much of the
  work that was used to synthesize this model is not cited; for this we apologize
  to the authors of relevant work. The asterisk indicates unphosphorylated OmpR at
  the ompF promoter in order to reflect the predominance of OmpF expression in conditions
  under which OmpR is predominantly unphosphorylated; however, the regulation at the
  porin promoters is considerably more complex than that depicted.
