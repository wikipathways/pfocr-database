caption: 'By binding anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), FABP1 may
  influence key aspects of the hepatic endocannabinoid system: A). FABP1 may facilitate
  AEA and 2-AG release/solubilization into the cytosol after their enzymatic cleavage/synthesis
  from plasma membrane phospholipids by N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase
  D (NAPE-PLD) and diacylglycerol lipase α and β (DAGLα and DAGLβ). FABP1 may or may
  not facilitate bound AEA and 2-AG for transport/efflux across the plasma membrane
  and activation of CB receptors on the exofacial leaflet and/or intracellular sites
  for degradation/hydrolysis. FABP1 is known to enhance the cytosolic transport of
  other bound ligands (, , , , ). B). FABP1 may facilitate the re-uptake of AEA and
  2-AG from the plasma membrane after these lipophilic ligands cross the plasma membrane
  by diffusion or via G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). Reuptake of
  2-AG may also occur via G protein-coupled endocannabinoid receptor (CB2). CB2 is
  expressed only in embryonic liver and in diseased conditions such as fatty liver
  (, ). CB1 and CB2 activation has been linked to diet-induced hepatic steatosis,
  primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, and alcoholic liver (). CB1 activation
  in mice enhances lipogenesis through the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c
  (SREBP1c) pathway which induces transcription of multiple genes in lipogenesis such
  as SREBP1c itself, acyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl
  CoA desaturase (SCD1) (). C). Upon FABP1-mediated release of plasma membrane and/or
  CB receptor bound AEA or 2-AG into the cytosol, FABP1 may transport the bound AEA
  (and 2-AG?) into the nucleus for PPARα activation. Although anandamide has been
  shown to bind PPARα and enhance PPARα activation (), liver fat accumulation in hepatic
  steatosis results in decreased LCFA oxidation—likely through saturation and/or inhibition
  of the PPARα pathway by the increasing fat load or damage by inflammation (). D)
  FABP1 may also transport the bound AEA to the degradative enzyme fatty acid amide
  hydrolase (FAAH) localized with smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, lipid
  droplets, and more rarely at the cell membrane (–) by a process analogous to that
  established for other FABP family members (FABP3,5,7) in brain (–, ). In human liver
  FABP1 may also transport AEA to/from lysosomes, where it is degraded by N-acylethanolamide
  acid amide hydrolase (NAAA) (, ). Finally, FABP1 may transport bound 2-AG for degradation
  by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), an enzyme found at lower levels in liver than
  brain or other tissues where it is localized diffusely in cytosol and less so in
  membranes without overall compartmental preference ().'
