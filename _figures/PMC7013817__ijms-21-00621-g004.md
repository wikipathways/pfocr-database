caption: Jasmonic acid perception and signal transduction during abiotic stress. In
  the absence of abiotic stimuli or at a low level of JA-Ile, the transcription factors
  are repressed by JAZ proteins, thereby preventing their activation of the promoters
  of jasmonate-responsive genes. JAZ proteins recruit TPL and adaptor protein NINJA
  to form an active transcriptional repression complex that inhibits JA responses
  by changing the open complex to a closed one through the further recruitment of
  HDA6 and HDA19. Abiotic stresses elevate JA synthesis, which is readily epimerized
  to JA-Ile. The latter is then transported to the nucleus by the JAT1 transporter.
  JA-Ile facilitates the interaction of JAZ with the F-box protein COI1 within the
  SCF complex, leading to the proteasomal degradation of JAZ. The derepressed TF binds
  to the G-box element, whereupon MED25, RNA Pol II, and GTF are recruited, resulting
  in the expression of jasmonate-responsive genes. JA, jasmonic acid; JA-Ile, jasmonyl

  description: Jasmonic acid perception and signal transduction during abiotic stress.
    In the absence of abiotic stimuli or at a low level of JA-Ile, the transcription
