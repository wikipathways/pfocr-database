caption: Role of Nrf2 in viral hepatitis-associated liver diseases. Hepatitis C virus
  was reported that impaired the protection of Nrf2 by promoting sMaf bound to NS3
  and brusatol suppressed HCV infection by promoting Nrf2 pathway. HBV-regulatory
  proteins, including its X protein (HBx) and large surface proteins were reported
  to activate Nrf2 and antioxidative responses via c-Raf and mitogen-activated protein
  kinase.
