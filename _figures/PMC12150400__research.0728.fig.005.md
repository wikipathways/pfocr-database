caption: Interaction between Trp metabolites and RA. In the Kyn pathway, QUDA can
  restrain both the proliferation and motility of synoviocytes. QA can promote the
  proliferation of human fibroblast-like synoviocytes and stimulate mitochondrial
  respiration and glycolysis. In the 5-HT pathway, melatonin inhibited Cry1 expression,
  leading to enhanced cAMP levels and activation of PKA and NF-κB. Melatonin mitigated
  inflammation with the G protein–adenyl cyclase–cAMP pathway and Met-Enk inhibition.
  Melatonin significantly reduced the production of TNF-α and IL-1β by inhibiting
  PI3K/AKT, ERK, and NF-κB pathways. Besides, melatonin elevated IL-1β and IL-6 levels
  and reduced oxidative stress. [All original elements used in the schematic figures
