caption: 'Overview of gene network enrichment analysis. Individual comparisons of
  B6 and 129 mice were performed in different tissue types (adipose, skeletal muscle,
  and liver), ages (6 weeks and 6 months), and diets (high fat, low fat, and standard
  chow). A: For each comparison, a differential expression significance value was
  determined for each gene, converted to a z score, and mapped onto a network of protein-protein
  interactions. The colors in the network represent the different ranges of z scores.
  B: A stochastic search algorithm () was then applied to search for subnetworks with
  high mean z score (high significance). Each application of the algorithm identifies
  one subnetwork; hence, to detect a multitude of subnetworks, the algorithm was run
  many times. The consensus among these subnetworks represented approximations of
  the true, differentially active network in B6 vs. 129 mice. C: A membership in differentially
  active subnetwork (MAN) score was determined for each gene. MAN scores are P values
  and represent the probability of genes to belong to the true, differentially active
  network. This score was calculated as the random chance probability that the gene
  is detected in the observed number of subnetworks computed over permutations of
  the data. D: Biological processes and pathways were tested for enrichment in genes
  with high MAN scores. Statistically significant pathways and processes were predicted
  to be differentially active in B6 vs. 129 mice. E: For each significant process
  and pathway, a network visualization was generated to aid interpretation.'
