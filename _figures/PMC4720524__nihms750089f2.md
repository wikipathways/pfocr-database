caption: (A) Regulation of biotin homeostasis is an example of transcriptional iron
  conservation response. In iron-replete cells, biotin is actively synthesized from
  its precursors by Bio2/3/4p enzymes, which require iron for their function, although
  biotin can also be imported from extracellular space by Vht1p transporter. In iron
  deficiency, yeast cells upregulate transcription of iron-independent VHT1 and inhibit
  transcription of iron-dependent BIO2/3/4 synthetic enzymes. As a result, iron-depleted
  cells preferentially acquire biotin through an iron-independent import pathway which
  reduces utilization of cellular iron.(B) Cth1/2p proteins mediate post-transcriptional
  pathway of iron conservation. In low-iron states, Aft1/2p activate transcription
  of CTH1/2, which bind to the AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3’UTR of mRNA and target
  them for degradation. Some of the Cth1/2p targets include proteins that directly
  incorporate one or several iron atoms into their structure. In addition, a subset
  of Cth1/2p targets does not code for iron-containing proteins but instead functions
  in iron-requiring metabolic pathways. Through these two mechanisms Cth1/2p optimize
  cellular iron utilization by shuttling iron away from non-essential pathways and
  conserving it for use in maintenance of cell viability. Dashed line indicates degraded
  mRNA molecules.
