caption: Canonical and noncanonical signaling options initiated via wnt3a and the
  concluded outcome. Wnt3a can bind to Frizzled and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein (LRP) 5/6 which leads to the recruitment of Dishevelled (Dsh) and Axin.
  The formation of the complex of Axin, adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), and glycogen
  synthase kinase-3β (GSK3) is prevented and thus β-catenin is not degraded by this
  complex (with the help of casein kinase 1α [CK1]) which is canonical signaling.
  With noncanonical signaling, wnt3a binds to Frizzled without LRP 5/6. Activated
  Frizzled can lead to the activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKII)
  and protein kinase C (PKC). Dsh is also able to activate Rac which in turn induces
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Moreover, Dsh can interact with DAAM1 to activate
  Rho which in turn activates ROCK. The last noncanonical pathway is through activation
  of adenylate cyclase (AC), which triggers cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein
  kinase A (PKA) inhibiting the transcription factor NFATc1. This figure is a hypothetical
  estimation based on the literature discussed in this paper. Chon, chondrocytes;
  NPC, nucleus progenitor cell; MSC, mesenchymal stromal cell; PG, proteoglycan.
