caption: A. Extracellular growth factors bind with cell receptors, activating a series
  of intricately regulated signaling. Tumor cells retain some levels of feedback inhibition,
  activation of one pathway might lead to inhibition of upstream substrates within
  the pathway, and/or the inhibition of compensatory pathways. Tumor cells depend
  on certain oncogenes for growth (“oncogene addiction”), these oncogene products
  provide good targets for molecularly targeted therapies. B. Molecular inhibitors
  suppress the overactivated growth/survival pathway, therefore tumors shrink. C.
  After prolonged treatment, induction of growth/survival signals of the same pathway
  and/or compensatory pathways leads to resistance against molecular inhibitors, which
  might be due to the disrupted feedback inhibitions. +++, overactivated signaling.
