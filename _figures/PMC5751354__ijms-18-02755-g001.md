caption: Glucose metabolism in cells. Extracellular glucose enters the cell via GLUT,
  a glucose transporter protein, that facilitates transport through the lipid bilayer
  plasma membrane. Subsequently, glucose is metabolized by pathway enzymes including
  HK, hexokinase; G6PD, glucose-6-phospahate dehydrogenase; PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase;
  PFK, phosphofructokinase; ALDO, aldolase; TPI, triose phosphate isomerase; GAPDH,
  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; PGAM, phosphoglycerate
  mutase; ENO, enolase; PK, pyruvate kinase. Mitochondrial metabolism regulatory enzyme
  PDK, Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, phosphorylates and inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  the first component of PDC, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converting Pyruvate
  to Acetyl-CoA. Oxidation of Acetyl-CoA by TCA, Tricarboxylic acid cycle chemical
  reactions in the matrix of the mitochondria releases stored energy. The TCA metabolite
  citrate can be exported outside mitochondria to be broken down into oxaloacetate
  and acetyl-CoA by the enzyme ACL, ATP citrate lyase. Cytosolic acetyl-CoA serves
  as a central intermediate in lipid metabolism. When oxygen is in short supply, LDH,
  lactate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate, the final product of glycolysis, to lactate.
  MCT, monocarboxylate transporter proteins allow lactate to traverse cell membranes.
  Solid purple arrows, metabolite transition pathways; thin solid black arrow, coenzyme
  transition; Dotted T-bar, inhibition.
