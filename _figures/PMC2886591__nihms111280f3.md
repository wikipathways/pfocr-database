caption: Ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency results in the accumulation of partially
  assembly intermediates that result in nucleolar stress signaling. Nucleolar stress,
  in turn, leads to p53 activation and either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. These
  steps are outlined in red. Interdicting mutations that subvert the p53 pathway and
  favor the outgrowth of malignant clones are shown in green. Also shown in green
  are interdicting mutations that could enhance ribosomal protein synthesis and diminish
  nucleolar stress but because of the oncogenic nature of the genes involved could
  again favor the outgrowth of malignant clones.
