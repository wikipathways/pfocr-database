caption: (A) Type I IFN binding to the Type I IFNR leads to the engagement of Erk
  and its downstream targets Mnk1 leading to the phosphorylation of eIF4E. IFN-mediated
  engagement of the JAK-STAT pathway results in ISGF3-mediated transcriptional response
  and an increase in ISG15 and ISG54 mRNA. The engagement of Mnk1 by Type I IFNs is
  critical for optimal translation of ISG15 and ISG54 and plays an important role
  in mediating the anti-proliferative effects of type I IFNs. (B) Mnk1/eIF4E phosphorylation
  is induced via IFNγ mediated engagement of Erk. IFNγ mediated engagement of the
  JAK-STAT pathway results in IFNγ induced transcription of ISGs. The parallel engagement
  of Mnk1/eIF4E facilitates the optimal translation of IRF-1 which mediates the antiproliferative
  effects of IFNγ.
