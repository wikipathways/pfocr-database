caption: Gene regulatory network of MK2. a) Representation of a gene regulatory network
  depicting the role of MK2 in the regulation of mRNA stability in the various datasets.
  The figure clearly demonstrates that MK2 regulates transcript stability via RBP-mediated
  regulation with HuR (ELAVL1) and TTP (ZFP36) playing an integral part. b), c) Gene
  regulatory network showing MAPK signaling cluster of the selected MK2 pathway genes
  (p38, MK2, AUF1, TTP, CUGBP1, CEBPδ, HuR, MKP-1, p27, TNF-α, and VEGF) in the transcriptome
  profiling data of the (b) in vitro HNSCC cell line dataset (B vs A, normoxic microenvironment)
  indicating VEGF and TNF-α downregulation. (c) In F vs E comparison, these genes
  which portray essential roles in the MK2 pathway are playing intrinsic roles in
  certain cellular pathways that are clustered into 6 major biological processes such
  as immune response, regulation of mRNA stability, regulations of cytokines, MAPK
  signaling, cell migration, and signaling pathways. The gene nodes are sized according
  to their p-values and colored according to their average log2 fold change, where
  red shows upregulation while green shows downregulation and yellow indicates baseline
  expression; processes are shown in rectangular boxes and colored in blue.
