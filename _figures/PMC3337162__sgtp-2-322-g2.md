caption: Figure 2. Regulation of cadherins by Rap1 and other downstream small GTPases.
  Rap1 induces adherens junction formation by stabilizing cadherins at the plasma
  membrane. Maintenance of cadherins at junctions can take the form of increased exocytosis,
  decreased endocytosis, increased recycling at the plasma membrane or remodeling
  of the actin cytoskeleton underneath the junctions. Those functions can be accomplished
  by the activation of different pathways downstream of Rap1 such as signals involving
  the small GTPases Ral, Rac, Cdc42 or Rab11. Rap1 also inhibits the targeting of
  cadherins for degradation through an AF6/p120-catenin pathway. Activation of Rap1
  depends on specific GEFs such as PDZ-GEF or C3G that are recruited by cadherin clustering
  or by other signals.
