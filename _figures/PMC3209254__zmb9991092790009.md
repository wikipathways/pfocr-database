caption: Model for the multiple mechanisms by which Sox2 regulates the osteoblast
  lineage. Sox2 maintains stemness and self-renewal by transcriptional mechanisms,
  fostering expression of genes such as Bmi-1 that are necessary for the self-renewal
  of osteoprogenitor cells. Sox2 also regulates transcription of genes in the Wnt
  pathway (e.g., APC, GSK3β, and Fzd receptor genes) whose upregulation or downregulation
  would inhibit Wnt signaling. Additionally, Sox2 downregulates canonical Wnt signaling
  by interacting through its C-terminal activation domain (R1) with β-catenin, thus
  inhibiting the prodifferentiation Wnt pathway.
