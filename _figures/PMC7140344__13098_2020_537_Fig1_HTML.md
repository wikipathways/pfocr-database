caption: a Melatonin improves diabetic cardiomyopathy through inhibiting mitochondrial
  fission by activation of SIRT1‐PGC1α pathway, increasing mitochondrial biogenesis
  by activation of cGMP-PKGIα, SIRT1 and AMPK-PGC1α-SIRT3 signaling pathways, inhibiting
  cardiac hypertrophy by reduction of the expression of VEGF-A, inhibiting apoptotic
  pathway by decrease the expression of caspase-3, -9, -8, Bax, PERK, Syk/MC1/SERCA,
  IRS-1/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways and inhibiting oxidative stress by increase
  the activity of SOD, CAT, GPx, cGMP-PKGIα and Nrf-2-HO-1 signaling pathways and
  the level of GSH and reduction of ROS, MDA and NO levels. b Melatonin reduces diabetic
  retinopathy through inhibiting oxidative stress by reduction of ROS, MDA and NO
  levels and activation of CAT and PI3K/Akt-Nrf2 pathway, improving blood-retinal
  barrier by reduction of the expression of HIF-1α, VEGF-A and PEDF, inhibiting apoptotic
  pathway by decrease the expression of caspase-3, Bax and MAPKs pathways, and inhibiting
  inflammation by inhibition of the expression of TNF-α, NOS and the activity of NFκB.
  c Melatonin ameliorates diabetic neuropathy through inhibiting oxidative stress
  by increasing CAT, SOD and GPx activity and GSH level and activating Nrf-2-HO-1
  pathway, inhibiting inflammation by reduction of TNF-α, iNOS, IL-6 and COX-2 expressions
  and the activity of NFκB, inhibiting apoptotic pathway by alleviation of the expression
  of caspase-3 and -9, Bax, PARP, and p38 MAPKs and elevation of PINK-1 level, and
  increasing the level of GABA and decreasing astrogliosis, which this effect leads
  to the improvement of memory and cognitive ability. d Melatonin improves diabetic
  nephropathy through inhibiting fibrotic process by reduction of the expression of
  TGF-β, inhibiting oxidative stress by enhancement of mitochondrial complex III,
  CAT, SOD, GPx and GST activities and reduction of NOX activity and MDA and NO generation,
  inhibiting inflammation by decreasing the level of IL-β, IL-6 and IL-33, inhibiting
  apoptosis by reduction of caspase-3 and Bax expression and JAK/STAT activity, inducing
  autophagy pathway by enhancement of the expression of Beclin-1, and inhibiting EMT
  by elevation the level of miR-49, which results in the alleviation of the level
  of ROCK. SIRT sirtuin, PGC1α peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator
