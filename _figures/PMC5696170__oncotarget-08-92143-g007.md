caption: 'CD74 is a single-chain type II integral membrane protein monomer; its expression
  is linked to the biosynthesis of HLA-DR, as shown in the left panel. CD74 associates
  with HLA-DR and is recycled into clathrin vesicles for peptide editing by HLA-DM.
  Cell-surface CD74 functions as a ligand for the cytokine MIF, as shown on the right
  panel. CD74 loaded with MIF interacts with CD44, a cell surface type I glycoprotein
  expressed on most cell types including cancer cells. Upon interaction CD44 activates
  the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src signal transduction pathway leading
  to NF-κB post-transcriptional regulation of genes. The role of CD74 and CD44 interaction
  in the turnover of these molecules is currently unknown. Acronyms: CD74, cluster
