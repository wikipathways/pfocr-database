caption: Schematic representation of the mechanisms by which 1,25(OH)2D3 interferes
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in human CRC cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 binds to its
  high affinity receptor VDR inducing the formation of β-catenin/VDR complexes and
  thus preventing that of transcriptionally active β-catenin/TCF4 complexes. In addition,
  1,25(OH)2D3 increases the transcription of the CDH1 gene encoding E-cadherin, which
  sequesters newly synthesized β-catenin protein at the subcortical adherens junctions.
  Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D3 upregulates the expression of the negative regulators of
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway TCF7L2 (encoding TCF4), DKK1 and AXIN1. 1,25(OH)2D3 also
  antagonizes the pathway by reducing the secretion by nearby macrophages of IL-1β,
  which inhibits GSK-3β activity in CRC cells leading to an increase in β-catenin
  levels.
