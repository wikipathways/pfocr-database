caption: LncRNAs serve as p53 regulators and effectors, participating in the p53 regulatory
  pathway. On the one hand, lncRNAs are able to regulate p53 directly or indirectly
  at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional levels such as MEG3. On the other
  hand, several lncRNAs could be induced or suppressed by p53 such as LINC-ROR, pR-lncRNA-1,
  LINC-PINT and TUSC7.
papertitle: Genetic polymorphisms of lncRNA-p53 regulatory network genes are associated
  with concurrent chemoradiotherapy toxicities and efficacy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
  patients.
