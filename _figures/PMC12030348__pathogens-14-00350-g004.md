caption: Schematic representation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in pathogenic
  fungi. This pathway responds to nutrient availability, particularly carbon and nitrogen
  sources, through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the cell membrane. GPCR
  activation stimulates cyclic AMP (cAMP) production by adenylate cyclase (Cyr1),
  which in turn activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates various effector
  proteins, including transcription factors, structural regulators, and enzymes, promoting
  key physiological responses such as morphological transition and the expression
  of virulence factors in fungal pathogens. In C. albicans, Ras1 and Ras2 regulate
  the activation of the adenylate cyclase Cyr1. The phosphodiesterase Pde1/Pde2 modulates
  cAMP levels, controlling PKA activity. In C. albicans, PKA activation regulates
  factors such as Efg1 and Nrg1, modulating the yeast-to-hyphal transition. Figure
