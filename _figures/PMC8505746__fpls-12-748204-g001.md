caption: (A) The photosynthetic electron transport chain in chloroplast thylakoid
  membrane. Linear electron transport (LET) involves both photosystems while cyclic
  electron transport (CET) involves only photosystem I (PSI). Both modes of electron
  transport contribute to the proton motive force used by chloroplast ATP synthase
  (cATP synthase) to generate ATP, while only LET contributes to NADPH production.
  ATP and NADPH support carbon fixation by the Calvin-Benson (CB) cycle. One pathway
  of CET involves the proton-pumping NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex, while
  the other pathway involves the proteins PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5 (PGR5) and PGR5-LIKE
  PHOTOSYNTHETIC PHENOTYPE1 (PGRL1). The malate valve can transfer NADPH equivalents
  from the stroma to cytosol. (B) The respiratory electron transport chain in inner
  mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Complex I, a family of other internal and external
  alternative dehydrogenases (NDin and NDex, respectively), and Complex II oxidize
  reducing equivalents. Electrons partition between the cytochrome (cyt) pathway [involving
  Complex III, cyt c, and Complex IV (cyt c oxidase)] and alternative oxidase (AOX).
  The proton motive force generated by electron transport is used by the mitochondrial
  ATP synthase (Complex V) to generate ATP. The proton gradient can also be dissipated
  by uncoupling proteins (UCP). Electron flow from reducing equivalents to cyt c oxidase
  is more tightly coupled to the generation of proton motive force (2–3 sites of proton
  translocation) than is electron flow from reducing equivalents to AOX (0–1 sites
  of proton translocation). Fd, ferredoxin; IMS, intermembrane space; and PC, plastocyanin.
