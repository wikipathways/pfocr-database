caption: IM precursors are imported into the IMS by the TOM complex, and then chaperoned
  across the IMS by small Tims to the TIM22 (translocase of the inner membrane 22)
  complex. The TIM22 complex is comprised of the main channel Tim22 and its accessory
  subunits Tim18 and Tim54. The proteins then follow one of two routes, either becoming
  embedded in the IM by TIM22 itself (1), or are released into the matrix where they
  are cleaved by the action of MPP and Hsp70 before being passed to the Oxa1 (cytochrome
  oxidase activity 1) complex for membrane insertion.
