caption: Overcrowding, hypoxia, and nutrient/serum-starved conditions caused the up-regulation
  of TRIP-Br1 in the cancer cells but not in the normal cells. Nutrient/serum starvation
  induces autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis to which increased TRIP-Br1 oncoprotein
  confers resistance in cancer cells. Increased TRIP-Br1 inhibits autophagy, apoptosis,
  and necroptosis in cancer cells in part by stabilizing XIAP and/or by inhibiting
  ROS production. Serum starvation causes the increase of TRIP-Br1 expression partly
  through the blockage of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
