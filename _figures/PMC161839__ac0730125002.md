caption: Proposed pathway for production of the 6-deoxy-5-keto-d-arabino-hexofuranose
  and aminocyclitol moieties of hygromycin A from glucose. The bold bonds indicate
  intact labeling of hygromycin A from d-[1,2-13C2]glucose (low-level intact labeling
  of C-3 and C-4 of hygromycin was also observed). The “13” indicates labeling of
  the furanose ring of hygromycin A by [1-13C]mannose.
