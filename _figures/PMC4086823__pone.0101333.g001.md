caption: The proposed model consists of the generation of IR-induced DSB, DSB repair
  system, and p53 signaling network as nuclear reactions and the apoptosis induction
  pathway as cytoplasmic reactions. Further, the reactions in the nucleus and cytoplasm
  are simulated as stochastic and deterministic processes, respectively (see  “Direct
  Hybrid Method” for details).
