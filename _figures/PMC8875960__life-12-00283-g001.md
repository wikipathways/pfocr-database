caption: Targeting the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. The BCR is constituted
  of a membrane immunoglobulin attached to the CD79a/CD79b complex. The antigen binding
  leads to the interaction between the ITAM domain of CD79a/CD79b and the Syk and
  Lyn kinases. This interaction triggers the downstream BCR signaling cascade. BTK
  and PI3K play a pivotal role in the BCR cascade and drugs that inhibit these two
  molecules are represented in the figure. TF, transcription factors.
