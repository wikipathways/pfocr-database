caption: Cell migration and function during normal wound healing. (A) Neutrophil migration
  in wound healing. Neutrophils are regulated by immune signals from macrophages and
  mast cells, as well as positive autocrine feedback, leading to migration to the
  wound site to initiate the inflammatory response. After fulfilling their role, neutrophils
  are phagocytosed by macrophages or re-enter circulation through reverse migration.
  (B) Monocyte/macrophage recruitment and polarization. Platelets, mast cells and
  endogenous chemokines recruit monocytes to the wound site, where they differentiate
  into M1 macrophages, mediating pro-inflammatory and phagocytic responses. Upon inflammation
  resolution, these macrophages shift to the M2 phenotype, promoting tissue repair
  and regeneration. (C) Keratinocyte migration and epithelialization. Inflammatory
  mediators released by macrophages, neutrophils and mast cells, along with growth
  factors secreted by fibroblasts, facilitate the migration of keratinocytes towards
  the wound site. MMPs facilitate ECM removal, thereby creating pathways that promote
  cell migration and re-epithelialization. (D) Endothelial cell migration-driven angiogenesis.
  Vascular endothelial cells, influenced by growth factors such as VEGF secreted by
  macrophages and fibroblasts, migrate both locally and systemically toward the wound
  site, thereby facilitating angiogenesis. (E) Fibroblast migration and tissue remodeling.
  Keratinocytes, macrophages and platelets secrete cytokines and growth factors that
  recruit fibroblasts to the wound site. These fibroblasts synthesize collagen to
  generate granulation tissue, differentiate into myofibroblasts to induce wound contraction
  and drive scar maturation through ECM remodeling. Created with BioRender.com. ECM,
