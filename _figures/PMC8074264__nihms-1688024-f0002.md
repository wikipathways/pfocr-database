caption: 'Adenosinergic targets within the TME. The TME is composed of a variety of
  cancer-associated and immune cells, each with differing expression of targetable
  molecules associated with the adenosine pathway; these include A2aR,A2bR,CD73, and
  CD39. While adenosine signaling induces a variety of immunosuppressive functions
  within these different cell types, targeting the various pathways may potently inhibit
  the immunosuppressive TME. Abbreviations: CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast; DC,
  dendritic cell; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor cell; MØ, macrophage; NK, natural
  killer; TME, tumor microenvironment; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; VEGF, vascular
  endothelial growth factor.'
