caption: 'Schematics of multitargeted actions of T1AM on metabolic and steroidogenic
  pathways. (A) Schematics of lipid metabolites and gene pathways in major tissues.
  The T1AM treatment group results in release of lipids from adipose tissue and consumption
  by muscle and liver while decreases lipid and cholesterol synthesis, and lipid storage
  in liver. However, T1AM results in increased estrogen synthesis in ovaries. (B) A schematic
  of T1AM action on glucose metabolism in muscle. T1AM normalizes glucose metabolism
  away from pentose phosphate pathway and lipid synthesis (by downregulation in expression
  of the P53 gene, and increased UDP‐glucose, pyruvate, and NADPH metabolites) toward
  glucose utilization in the mitochondria energy metabolism that leads to increased
  malate dehydrogenase (ME1) gene expression; (C) A schematic of the proposed T1AM
  effects on lipid and antioxidant pathways in liver. T1AM increases the hepatic antioxidant
  defense mechanism shown by glutathione accumulation. Solid arrows represent the
  direction of flow in the corresponding pathway, and dotted black arrows indicate
  one or more reactions in the corresponding pathway. Dotted arrow represents a trend
  toward the direction of the arrow. Abbreviations: Acarn: acetylcarnitine, Fatty
  acyl‐CoA: fatty acyl co‐enzyme A, FFA: free fatty acid, DNL: de novo lipogenesis.'
