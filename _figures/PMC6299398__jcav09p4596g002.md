caption: Affected pathways in SHH-activated medulloblastoma. Loss-of-function mutations
  in PTCH1 and SUFU result in activation of the SHH pathway. The SCF complex partially
  degrades Gli2/Gli3 into transcriptional repressor forms and completely degrades
  Gli1 when sequestered by SUFU. Shh ligand binds to PTCH1 and releases its inhibition
  of SMO. SMO activation decreases SUFU sequestration, allowing Gli family transcription
  factors to localize to the nucleus to promote downstream SHH transcriptional events.
  Gain-of-function mutations in CUL1 of the SCF complex may promote the ubiquitination
  of Gli transcription factors and result in transcriptional inhibition of downstream
  SHH activity. In the somatic TP53 mutant, TP53 loss-of-function and DYNC1H1 gain-of-function
  promote proliferation of cancer cells.
