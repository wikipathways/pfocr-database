caption: 'Regulatory network of LncRNAs-TFs-Driver genes and working model (a) Master
  regulatory network of LncRNA-TF-Driver genes. Regulatory interactions between lncRNAs,
  TFs and driver genes are depicted in this integrated network, b-c:EGR1 and MALAT1
  subnetwork from the master regulatory network. (b) Transcription Factor EGR1 is
  observed to be regulating three hub genes (FN1, CD44 and TIMP1) and also being regulated
  by MALAT1 (c) EGR1-MALAT1 interaction (red-colored edge) and MALAT1-mRNA interaction
  (hub genes, green-colored edges) obtained from the ENCODE transcription factor targets
  dataset of the Harmonizome database and lncRNA-mRNA interaction database, respectively,
  (d): A working model for the regulation of key driver genes associated with pan-cancer
  multi-drug resistance: Transcription factor EGR1 may regulate MALAT1 transcription.
  After being transcribed, MALAT1 is predicted to bind to different sites, 5′-UTR,
  CDS, and 3′-UTR, of specific mRNAs, thereby regulating these key driver genes through
  cis-or trans-acting mechanisms.'
