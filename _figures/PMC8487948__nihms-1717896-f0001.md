caption: In the absence of WNT ligand (inactive WNT signaling), accumulated β-catenin
  bound in the destruction complex by AXIN and APC is phosphorylated by CK1α, and
  GSK3 leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by β-TrCP/YAP/TAZ.
  In the presence of WNT ligands (active WNT signaling), LRP5/6 and FZD co-receptors
  associate leading to activation and recruitment of AXIN1/2 and DVL to the membrane,
  disrupting the destruction complex. This results in stabilization and nuclear localization
  of β-catenin. In the nucleus, β-catenin binds to the TCF/LEF, recruiting co-activators
  p300 and CBP to induce WNT target gene target transcription. Created with BioRender.com
