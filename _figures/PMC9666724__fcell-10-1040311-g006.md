caption: A molecular target for combination therapy with FAK inhibitors. FAK supports
  a variety of oncogenic processes and is beneficial in combination with a variety
  of available antitumor agents. In RAS-mutated or RAF-mutated cancer cells, blocking
  the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway with RAF or MEK inhibitors activates FAK and promotes cell
  survival by reactivating ERK signaling. Activated FAK in diffuse gastric cancer
  and uveal melanoma attenuates the negative regulation of the transcriptional activator
  YAP by large tumor suppressor 1 and 2 (LATS1/2). FAK activity can promote nuclear
  translocation of YAP, and combinations of FAK inhibitors with inhibitors of YAP
  expression [e.g., histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors] or transcriptional activity
  may be required to enhance inhibition of oncogenic YAP signaling (; ). Inhibition
  of RHOA or FAK selectively induces mutant KRAS cell death in non-small cell lung
  cancer studies (). In breast cancer sRc-3Δ4, a splice isoform of the oncogene was
  found to be a signaling adapter linking EGFR and FAK and promoting EGF-induced phosphorylation
  of FAK and c-Src (). FAK inhibitors also play a role in epigenetics (), and radiation
  treatment in combination with FAK inhibitors affects the immune microenvironment
  surrounding the tumor (). The small GTPase, RAS homolog family member A (RHOA),
  regulates the actin cytoskeleton. ECM, extracellular matrix; GPCR, G protein-coupled
  receptor.
