caption: Schematic diagram showing that cartilage matrix homeostasis is adjusted dynamically
  by TGF-β signaling pathway. Activated TGF-β binds to the TGF-β type I receptor ALK1,
  resulting in phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5, or Smad8, which form a complex with
  the co-Smad Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus to promote cartilage matrix anabolism
  by modifying gene expression. Meanwhile, the activated TGF-β type II receptor ALK5
  results in phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3 which form a complex with the co-Smad
  Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus to promote cartilage matrix catabolism by modifying
  gene expression.
