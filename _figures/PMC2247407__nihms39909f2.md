caption: The Wnt-Frizzled signaling pathway employs Akt to regulate an array of vital
  cellular functions that involve cellular protection, angiogenesis, cardiovascular
  remodeling, DNA repair, and the maintenance of membrane asymmetry in neuronal and
  vascular systems. The Wnt-Frizzled signaling pathway employs Akt to impact upon
  the survival of neurons, endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes to prevent cellular
  injury and promote angiogenesis. Through the activation of Akt, microglial activity
  is modulated to block harmful cytokine release and prevent the phagocytosis of cells
  “tagged” by cellular phosphatidylserine (PS) membrane exposure. The Wnt-Frizzled
  signaling pathway function in cardiovascular remodeling that involves regulation
  of LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) and reduction in MI (myocardial infarction)
  and HF (heart failure).
