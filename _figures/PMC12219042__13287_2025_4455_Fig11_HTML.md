caption: Schematic diagram of this work. (A) VEGF-B acts as a bridge between skeletal
  muscle type and high-fat diet-induced hyperglycemia in vivo. (B) Matched with high-fat
  diet-induced hyperglycemia accompanied by increased content of slow-twitch type
  I fibers within the skeletal muscle of VEGF-B deficient high-fat diet-fed mice in
  vivo, VEGF-B186, which was continuously administered at a single high dosage in
  vitro, inhibited myoblast differentiation/fusion and myofiber formation and glucose
  utilization via the PKA-NFATs signaling pathway
