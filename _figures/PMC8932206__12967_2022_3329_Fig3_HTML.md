caption: Integration of siRNA and Pro-Pt into uPA peptide-targeted multifunctional
  shell-core NPs for the synergistic treatment of TNBC. A The tumour-targeted CaP
  shell-core NPs were prepared using the biomineralization method, where the organic
  DSPE-PEG-uPA core encapsulates the chemotherapeutic agent Pro-Pt (Pt′) followed
  by negatively charged siRNA adsorbing in the inorganic porous CaP shell. B The intracellular
  mechanism of uPA-SP@CaP NPs in TNBC cells. (i) uPA-mediated active tumour targeting
  increased the intracellular drug concentration. (ii) CaP-mediated lysosomal membrane
  rupture resulted in lysosomal escape, along with (iii) the release of the BRCA1
  siRNA to inhibit the DNA repair pathway. (iv) SiRNA and reduction of Pro-Pt to Pt
  synergistically induced irreversible DNA damage in TNBC cells. siRNA small interfering
