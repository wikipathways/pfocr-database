caption: Potential pathway regulated by ING3. (A) GeneMANIA analysis revealed interaction
  between ING3 and a core protein of the PI3K/AKT pathway, while Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis demonstrated that ING3 may regulate the PI3K/AKT
  pathway. (B) PI3K/Akt Pathway was involved in mTOR signaling. (C) PI3K/Akt Pathway.
  (D) PI3K/ Akt pathway involved in breast cancer. ING3, inhibitor of growth 3.
