caption: A model of regulation of TM by the PDGFR axis in bladder smooth muscle. Exposure
  to PDGF in vitro or bladder wall distension in vivo causes phosphorylation and activation
  of the PDGFR, initiating downstream signaling cascades such as the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  PDGF-stimulated, PI3K/Akt-dependent signals activate specific AP-1 components (c-jun
  and Fra1), which bind to the TM promoter to increase its expression and thereby
  promote cell migration. PDGF also stimulates cell cycle transit in a Fra1-dependent
  manner.
