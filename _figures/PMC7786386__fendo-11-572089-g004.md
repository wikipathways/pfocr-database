caption: p38-signaling in white adipose tissue browning. WAT browning can be triggered
  by a variety of stimuli that converge on p38 signaling. In response to cold, hormones,
  drugs, or naturally occurring compounds, the SNS releases catecholamines to induce
  WAT browning by stimulating β3-adrenergic receptors. The ensuing PKA activation
  in turn activates p38. p38 phosphorylation and activation can alternatively be triggered
  by other molecules, such as cardiac NP acting via PKG, T3 hormone via an alternative
  pathway, or irisin released by skeletal muscle. Solid arrows represent the direct
  effects of molecular players involved in the indicated signaling pathways, while
  dotted arrows represent indirect effects, meaning that other unknown molecules might
  be involved. Active p38 phosphorylates the transcription factor ATF2, which translocates
  to the nucleus and upregulates the transcription of UCP1 and other key genes essential
  for transforming white adipocytes into beige adipocytes. AC, adenylate cyclase;
