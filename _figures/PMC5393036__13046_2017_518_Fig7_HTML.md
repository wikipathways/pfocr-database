caption: 'Schematic model of NKILA functions during the invasion-metastasis cascade
  in NSCLC. NKILA, which could be directly activated by TGF-β, inhibits NSCLC cell
  migration and invasion by binding the NF-κB: IκB complex and masking the phosphorylation
  sites of IκB from IKK to inhibit the IKK-induced IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation.
  Subdued NF-κB signal pathway activation lead to lower snail expression and then
  suppress NSCLC cell EMT'
