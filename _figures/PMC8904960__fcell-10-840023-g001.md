caption: During apoptosis “executioner” caspases (caspase-3,-6 and -7) are activated
  by upstream “initiator” caspases (caspase-8 and caspase-9). In the extrinsic or
  death receptor pathway caspase-8 is activated by ligands binding to members of the
  death receptor family. Ligand binding triggers the recruitment of proteins to a
  large complex, the Death Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC). Caspase-8 is amongst
  those proteins, and its recruitment drives the autocatalytic processing and activation
  of caspase-8. In some cells caspase-8 then cleaves and activates caspase-3 directly.
  In other cells, caspase-8 cleaves a protein called Bid, an event that allows the
  cleaved Bid to activate the intrinsic or mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In the
  mitochondrial death pathway signals cause the release of proteins from the inner
  mitochondrial membrane space. One of these proteins, cytochrome c, then binds to
  a cytosolic protein called Apaf-1. Cytochrome c binding causes Apaf-1 oligomerization
  and the formation of a protein complex (the apoptosome) that recruits and activates
  caspase-9. Caspase-9 is then able to activate the downstream effector caspases.
  Proteins of the Bcl-2 family control the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria,
  and can be both pro- and anti-apoptotic. Bax and Bak are pro-apoptotic members that
  sit in the mitochondrial membrane and are required for cytochrome c release. The
  pro-apoptotic activity of Bax and Bak is suppressed by the binding of anti-apoptotic
  members like Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. BH3-only proteins like Bid, PUMA, Bim etc are pro-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 family members that act either by inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins,
  or by directly binding the pro-apoptotic proteins. Created with BioRender.com.
