caption: . Signaling pathway network mined for proteins identified in pediatric ependymoma.
  Construction of the diagram was performed by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software,
  as described in the Materials and Methods section. Gray nodes indicate focus genes/proteins
  of ependymoma. Solid lines represent direct interactions between proteins. Direct
  interactions are defined as those where two proteins directly contact each other,
  with no intermediate step and usually comprise chemical modifications.
