caption: Pathway for 17β-estradiol formation in cancer cells. Estrone-sulfate (E1-S),
  a precursor for the most active estrogen 17β-estradiol (E2), androstenediol (5-Diol-S),
  and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) are taken up from the blood into cancer
  cells by transporters from the organic anion transporting polypeptide family (OATPs)
  and other members of the solute carriers (SLCs). In the sulfatase pathway, E1-S
  is converted through steroid sulfatase (STS) to estrone (E1), which is transformed
  via the reductive 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17β-HSD red) to E2. E2 as the
  most active estrogen binds and activates estrogen receptors (ERs). In the reverse
  pathway from E2 to E1-S, the oxidative 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17β-HSDox)
  convert E2 to E1. The estrogen sulfotransferase SULT1E1 inactivates estrogens by
  adding sulfate to hydroxyl-groups on the steroid ring. In the aromatase pathway,
  E2 is produced from testosterone by the aromatase. Testosterone itself is formed
  from 5-androstenediol (5-Diol) via 3β-HSD. 5-Diol is generated by the removal of
  the sulfate from 5-Diol-S via STS. Also 5-Diol can activate ER, but with lower affinity
  than E2. In an alternative way, testosterone is derived from the conversion of DHEA-S
  to androstenedione (4-Dione) via DHEA. Finally, 17β-HSD transforms 4-Dione to testosterone
  ().
