caption: Model of Stat3, Ascl1a, and Lin28a in inducing maximal Müller glial proliferation
  in the light-damaged zebrafish retina. In the light-damaged zebrafish retina, there
  are three groups of Müller glia (Primary and Secondary Proliferating Müller glia
  and Quiescent Müller glia). Cell death produces a damage signal to the Primary Proliferating
  Müller glia (PPMg) and possibly the other two Müller glia groups. This signal activates
  Lin28a, which activates Ascl1a and induces the PPMg to reenter the cell cycle (in
  a Stat3-independent manner). Ascl1a then activates Stat3 expression in the PPMg,
  which is necessary to generate a signal to the Secondary Proliferating Müller glia
  (SPMg). This signal to the SPMg, which may be HB-EGF (Ramachandran et al., 2012),
  activates the Lin28a pathway again to drive the SPMg to reenter the cell cycle.
  Thus, the SPMg proliferation is dependent on Stat3 expression in the PPMg. The Quiescent
  Müller glia (QMg) express Stat3, but not Ascl1a and do not proliferate. It is unclear
  if the damage signal induces Stat3 expression in the QMg or if another mechanism
  induces the Stat3 expression.
