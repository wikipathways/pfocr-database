caption: 'An alternative model for PdhS2 regulation of CtrA activity. Our data are
  consistent with PdhS2 intersecting the DivK–CtrA regulatory pathway at one of two
  points. Pathway A: canonical genetic model with PdhS2 interacting with DivK. The
  phosphorylation status of DivK then modulates CtrA activity through the CckA–ChpT–CtrA
  axis. Pathway B: DivK-independent model of CtrA regulation by PdhS2 through an unidentified
  response regulator, RR-X. Both routes to the regulation of CtrA activity ultimately
  affect the phosphorylation status of CtrA, affecting occupancy at CtrA-regulated
  promoters, and finally leading to inverse regulation of attachment (primarily through
  cdGMP pools) and separately motility. Regulatory proteins: blue text; histidine
  kinases; orange text, histidine phosphotransferase (Hpt), green text, response regulators.
  RR-X indicates a putative response regulator, yet to be identified.'
