caption: The cGAS-STING signaling pathway. The cGAS is activated following identifying
  exogenous or endogenous DNA, which catalyzes ATP and GTP into cGAMP. cGAMP binds
  to the endoplasmic reticulum adaptor protein STING to initiate the signaling cascade.
  Subsequently, activated STING transfers to endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate
  compartments and to the Golgi apparatus, where it recruits IKK to mediate canonical
  NF-κB targets, and also recruits TBK1 in parallel, which phosphorylates STING and
  IRF3 to induce type I IFN and other cytokines. Meanwhile, STING also activates NF-κB-inducing
  kinase (NIK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14,MAP3K14) mediated
  non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Finally, STING is transported to the vesicles and speedily
  turns off downstream signaling, subsequently STING vesicles are assigned to endolysosomes
  to degrade
