caption: Diagram represents an erythroblast cell during mitotic replication under
  conditions of stress. Proteins encoded by genes clustering with Cldn13 in microarray
  data are in red. KITL and its receptor KIT signal through PI3K  and regulate BIRC5

  , , . PI3K/AKt phosphorylate and activate GATA1  which physically interacts with
  retinoblastoma (RB1) and E2F2 . PI3K has been shown to be upstream of Claudin family
  members , potentially linking this pathway with CLDN13 (broken arrow). Claudin family
  members have been shown to physically interact with MPDZ (MUPP1)  (a binding partner
  of KIT) and TJP1 (ZO-1), a TJ component which interacts with EPB4.1 (4.1R)  (a key
  cytoskeletal component linking mitotic microtubules to the plasma membrane Band-3
  complex ). Under hypoxic conditions BMP4 signals through SMAD proteins (including
  SMAD5) , ,  a cascade regulating the transcription factors TAL1, GATA1, ELKF (not
  shown) and RUNX1 , . Downstream targets of these factors include TRIM10 (HERF1)
  , RHD and GYPA , . Progression through the cell cycle may be controlled by regulation
