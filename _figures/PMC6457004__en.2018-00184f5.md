caption: Schematic model in which HMW FGF2-mediated FGF23 stimulation of chondrocyte
  differentiation and OA is partially through modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
  Overexpression of HMW FGF2 enhances FGF23 expression, which results in enhanced
  Wnt7b and phospho-Lrp5 and reduced Sost and Dkk1 expression. Increased inactive
  phosphorylated Gsk3β and Axin2 allow β-catenin to accumulate and be translocated
  to the nucleus, where it binds lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor (LEF/TCF)-promoting
  transcription of OA and chondrocyte hypertrophic genes. When HMW FGF2 is not overexpressed,
  there is less FGF23 expression, resulting in reduced Wnt7b and increased Sost and
  Dkk1 expression, ultimately leading to reduced Wnt/β-catenin signaling and less
  chondrocyte differentiation.
