caption: Myostatin (GDF8), activinA/B, TGFβ, and GDF11 bind to type II receptors like
  ActRIIB/IIA that activate type I receptors (ALK4/5/7), which phosphorylate and induce
  Smad2/3 to form a complex with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus. BMP ligands
  bind BMP type II receptors like BMPRII but also ActRIIB/A and recruit type 1 receptors
  such as ALK2/3/6 to phosphorylate and activate Smad 1/5/8 that form a complex with
  Smad4. The BMP and TGFβ/myostatin/activins ligands are modulated extracellularly
  by the inhibitory action of cytokines, such as noggin and follistatin. Another level
  of regulation happens in the cytosol where Smad6 and 7 negatively modulate the BMP
  and myostatin/activin pathway. Finally, both Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8 transcription
  factors regulate mTOR activity, but the underlying mechanism are unclear. Dotted
  lines depict pathways whose molecular mechanisms and role in adult skeletal muscles
  have yet to be completely defined.
