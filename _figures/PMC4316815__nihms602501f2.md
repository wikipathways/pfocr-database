caption: 'Regulation by zinc of the ERK1/2 signaling cascade. Zinc could activate
  the ERK1/2 signaling pathway at various levels: 1 zinc inhibits phosphatases that
  are involved in ERK1/2 dephosphorylation, and zinc inhibits kinases that indirectly
  regulate the phosphorylation levels of receptors that subsequently activate the
  ERK cascade; 2 zinc can directly bind to and activate receptors (e.g., GPR39) which
  have ERK1/2 as a downstream signaling cascade; and 3 zinc can activate MMPs, which
  subsequently cleave and activate substrates (e.g., pro-BDNF) releasing ligands (e.g.
  BDNF) that activate receptors upstream from the ERK1/2 cascade'
