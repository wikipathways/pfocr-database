caption: Signal integration during the shade-avoidance response. (a) Comparison of
  a tomato plant grown under sunlight (left) with a high R:FR ratio and a tomato plant
  grown under vegetative shade (right) with a low R:FR ratio. (b) Hormone and light
  pathway interaction in response to white light (high R:FR, left) and shade (low
  R:FR, right).
