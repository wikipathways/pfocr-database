caption: Effects of non‐caloric artificial sweeteners on gut health. (A) Santos et al.
  reported that in Caco‐2 cells, saccharin activated NF‐κB, which subsequently led
  to the ubiquitination of claudin‐1 and disrupted barrier function [40]. (B) Guo
  et al. identified that sucralose enhanced DSS‐induced colitis in mice via the activation
  of the TLR5‐MyD88‐NF‐κB signaling pathway, leading to increased IL‐1β, IL‐17A, IL‐18,
  and TNF‐α production as well as microbial dysbiosis and intestinal barrier damage
  [41]. (C) Rodriguez‐Palacios and colleagues found that Splenda induced microbial
  dysbiosis through increased levels of the Proteobacteria phylum and E. coli. Splenda
  also increased ileal myeloperoxidase (MPO) and increased bacterial infiltration
  into the ileal lamina propria [42]. Image created in BioRender
