caption: The diagram shows the activation of the TLR4 signalling pathway by LPS or
  by surrogate ligands such as Aß, and activation of STAT3 and NFKB through the adaptor
  MYD88. NFKB and STAT3 activate NOS2 (iNOS), acute phase responses, complement and
  other inflammatory processes. The DOK3, TYROBP, TREM2 complex regulates the interaction
  between LPS and TLR4 and is in turn modulated by У-secretase.
