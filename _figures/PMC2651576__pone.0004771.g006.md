caption: Resistance to stress conditions is essential for melanoma cells survival.
  We propose that oncogenic BRAFV600Esignaling (left panel) protects to apoptosis
  by regulating BH3-family members and confers resistance to low energy conditions
  promoting the uncoupling of LKB1 and AMPK through Erk1/2 and p90Rsk. Under this
  condition BRAF mutant cells have a limited response to low energy conditions. On
  the right panel the inhibition of BRAF signaling allows the formation of the LKB1-AMPK
  complexes restoring the energy stress pathway and promoting the down-regulation
  of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl1. The activation of AMPK by metabolic stress
  conditions and the inhibition of BRAF signaling would have synergistic effects promoting
  apoptosis.
