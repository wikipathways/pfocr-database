caption: The functional loss of PC1-PC2 is thought to reduce intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis,
  lowering the activity of PDE1, a Ca2+ -dependent phosphodiesterase. Reduced PDE1
  activity increases basal intracellular cAMP levels and causes a greater cAMP response
  to arginine vasopressin [, ]. Lower intracellular Ca2+ de-represses BRAF, a kinase
  upstream of the MEK/ERK pathway, leading to cAMP-dependent cell proliferation [].
  Cystic cells remain poorly differentiated and have abnormal expression of TGF-β
  and periostin, a matricellular protein involved in tissue repair []. TGF-β, the
  key cytokine for ECM production, causes overexpression of laminin −332 (with a concurrent
  reduction in laminin-511), proteoglycans, and collagen types I and II. Excessive
  ECM production contributes to interstitial fibrosis and cystogenesis [, , , ]. Periostin
  binding to αVβ3-integrins causes integrin bundling, formation of focal adhesions,
  and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) []. Integrin activation stimulates
  integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a pseudokinase that is in a signaling complex with
  PINCH and α-Parvin. Periostin activation of the ILK-PINCH-Parvin complex and FAK
  stimulates pathways involved in tissue repair, including AKT/mTOR-dependent cell
  proliferation and survival, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cytoskeletal
  rearrangement, and cell migration []. Periostin binding to αVβ3-integrin is also
  thought to release TGF-β from latent TGF-β binding protein 1 (LTBP1), and active
  TGF-β stimulates the SMAD pathway to increase ECM production and cause a further
  production of periostin, causing a feed-forward mechanism for renal fibrosis. Periostin
  has also been shown to activate lysyl oxidase, an enzyme that causes cross -linking
  of the collagen fibrils leading to fibrosis. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK); PINCH
  (particularly interesting new cysteine histidine-rich protein); Ras homology family
  member RhoA; Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and its receptor (TGFβR).
