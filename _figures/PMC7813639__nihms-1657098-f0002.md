caption: a | In normal cells, human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) allosterically
  activates other HER kinases through heterodimerization in a ligand-dependent manner
  (left panel). Overexpression or mutation of HER3 drives ligand-independent association
  with its dimerization partners, such as HER2, and activation of signalling pathways
  that promote tumorigenesis (right panel). b | In normal cells, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)
  associates with its cognate receptor at the plasma membrane, and the JAK homology
  2 (JH2) pseudokinase domain of JAK2 allosterically inhibits the JH1 kinase domain.
  This inhibition is relieved upon ligand binding to the receptor, allowing transphosphorylation
  and activation of the kinase domain (left panel). Mutations in the pseudokinase
  domain associated with cancers, such as myeloproliferative neoplasms, are believed
  to disrupt the pseudokinase–kinase domain interaction, causing constitutive activation
  of the kinase domain (right panel). c | Under normal conditions, kinase suppressor
  of RAS (KSR) allosterically activates BRAF to promote phosphorylation of MEK and
  activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling. KSR also interacts
  directly with MEK, and this interaction enhances the allosteric activator function
  of KSR (left panel). Mutations associated with obesity and insulin resistance impair
  the ability of KSR to activate the MAPK pathway by disrupting its interactions with
  MEK and BRAF (right panel). d | Under normal conditions, FAM20A and FAM20C localize
  to the Golgi apparatus. FAM20A allosterically activates FAM20C, which becomes secreted
  and phosphorylates extracellular proteins that are important for biomineralization
  and proper enamel development (left panel). Mutations in FAM20A linked to amelogenesis
  imperfecta fail to activate FAM20C or promote FAM20C secretion (right panel). e
  | The transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα) promotes myeloid
  cell differentiation. Tribbles homologue 1 (TRIB1) and TRIB2 interact with C/EBPα
  and the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 to mediate ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation
  of C/EBPα (left panel). Overexpression of TRIB1 or TRIB2 induces leukaemogenesis
  by causing excessive degradation of C/EBPα in a COP1-dependent manner (right panel).
  CRD, cysteine-rich domain; NRG, neuregulin; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; STAT,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription.
