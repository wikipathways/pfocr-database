caption: Model of BR perception and signaling pathway. (a) In the absence of BR, formation
  of the receptor complex is inhibited by the C-terminal domain (CTD) of BRI1 kinase
  and by the BKI1 protein. Positive regulators of BR signaling are inactive, whereas
  the cytoplasmic BIN2 kinase phosphorylates and inactivates transcription factors,
  what results in their cytoplasmic retention, export for nucleus and degradation.
  Expression of the BR-responsive genes is repressed; (b) After BR perception by the
  BRI1 kinase the transmembrane receptor complex is formed and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
  cascade is initiated. BIN2 kinase is inhibited, what results in accumulation of
  active, dephosphorylated forms of transcription factors in the nucleus and stimulation
  of the expression of BR-responsive genes. The green arrows denote activation, whereas
  the red arrows denote inhibition; ‘P’ denotes phosphorylation/dephosphorylation,
  whereas ‘Me’ stands for methylation.
