caption: 'Hyperglycaemia may affect ten-eleven translocation (TET) and Jumonji C (JmjC)
  activity by altering Fe2+ availability. a Hyperglycaemia increases flux through
  the polyol pathway, which consumes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADPH). Reduced glutathione (GSH) and vitamin C levels may decrease as a result,
  decreasing the regeneration of Fe2+ which is required by TET and JmjC enzymes. Increased
  generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hyperglycaemia may also affect Fe2+
  regeneration. b An increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in hyperglycaemia
  may increase the intracellular labile Fe2+ pool and thus increase TET and JmjC activity.
  Abbreviations: glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
  (F1,6P2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3 BPG)'
