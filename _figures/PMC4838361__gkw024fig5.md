caption: PARI regulates the repair of single-strand gaps left behind the replication
  fork. DNA lesions induce stalling of the replication fork, which can be repaired
  by the DDT pathway. Prolonged fork stalling will result in fork collapse. After
  re-priming, single-strand gaps are left behind the replication fork, which can be
  filled by TLS polymerases as part of the DDT pathway or repaired by TS utilizing
  components of the HR machinery. RECQL5β - or FBH1 are able to disrupt RAD51 filament
  thus inhibiting HR and allowing DDT pathway to bypass the lesion and fill the gap.
  In addition, PARI can also regulate HR by blocking re-assembly of the DNA polymerase
  complex required for the extension of the invading strand or limiting the length
  of the extension and resulting in short extension products. D-loops or short extension
  products are disassembled by FANCM promoting SDSA and limiting formation of crossovers
  (CO). Long extension products can be stabilized by second-end capture resulting
  in the formation of Holliday junctions that can be dissolved by the BTR (BLM/TOP3/RMI1)
  complex or resolved by nucleases with a higher risk of CO.
