caption: 'Synthesis of stress acute and chronic response on the inflammatory pathway.
  (1-2) Stressors trigger a primary neuroendocrine response from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  (HPA) axis. Hypothalamic Parvocellular neurons from the paraventricular nucleus
  secrete a corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin. CRC induces, subsequently,
  the anterior hypophysis to release the adrenocorticotropic hormone, leading to a
  glucocorticoid secretion (cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents) by the
  adrenal cortex; (3) Acute physiological alterations prepare the human to fight or
  flight from stressors. These are evolutionary adaptive behaviors related to surveillance.
  Therefore, stress induces transient activation of HPA- axis activity paralleled
  by temporary increases in CRH transcription. Sympathetic-Adreno-Medullar axis is
  also activated in the stress response causing several physiological systemic changes.
  Acute stress also leads to an immunosuppressive state; (4) On the contrary, the
  exposure to chronic stress leads to excessive sustained elevated levels of stress
  hormones, including CRH and corticosterone, can be harmful and predispose to risk
  of several chronic non-transmissible diseases, including psychiatric disturbs; (5)
  And mechanisms involving an increase in neural apoptosis an in the levels of some
  molecules associated to stress response, especially catecholamines. These processes
  induce the production of immunogenic Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
  molecules. (6) DAMPs can activate at least three inflammatory pathways that contribute
  to the increase of brain-blood barrier permeability, promoting ingress of some systemic
  peripheral inflammatory cells into the brain contributing to the neuroinflammatory
  states cause dysfunction and increase the risk of depression. HPA: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal;
  PVN: Paraventricular nucleus; CRH: Corticotrophin-releasing hormone; VP: Vasopressin;
  ACTH: Adrenocorticotropic hormone; GC: Glucocorticoid; SAM: Sympathetic-Adreno-Medullar;
