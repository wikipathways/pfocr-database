caption: Conceptual model of the possible relationship between bilateral oophorectomy,
  premature loss of estrogen, and accelerated agingThe central part of the figure
  was derived from figures in Refs.  and . Although in our model we postulate that
  estrogen plays a major role, the link between bilateral oophorectomy and accelerated
  aging may be mediated completely or in part by the loss of other ovarian hormones
  (e.g., premature loss of progesterone, testosterone, or inhibin, or disruption of
  the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis). Hormone therapy, primarily estrogen therapy,
  can attenuate the harmful effects of the premature loss of ovarian hormones caused
  by the oophorectomy. The minus sign indicates an antagonistic effect against accelerated
  aging (protective effect against aging). The genetic variants in the estrogen synthesis
  or responsiveness pathway may increase or decrease the effects of the hormonal loss
  (plus and minus sign). Similarly, behavioral or environmental risk factors may increase
  or decrease the effects of the hormonal loss (plus and minus sign). In this scenario,
  hormonal therapy, genetic factors, and non-genetic factors play a role as effect
  modifiers (interaction variables). COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
