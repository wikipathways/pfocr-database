caption: 'Protein interaction map around some selected baits in the TGFβ pathway.
  PBS D and E interactions as well as protein interactions corresponding to the BMP
  pathway have been excluded from this map for clarity (however, all data are available
  on the PIMRider visualization platform at http://pim.hybrigenics.com). The following
  bait proteins were selected to generate a TGFβ network: Smad2, 3, 4, 7, SARA, Smurf2,
  SnoN, and SNIP1. These are represented in boxes with heavy outlining. Of the 14
  proteins selected for further functional validation, the six proteins present in
  this figure are represented in red. The (+) symbol located in the upper right corner
  of some boxes indicates that additional partners are not represented in this figure
  but are visible on the Web site mentioned above.'
