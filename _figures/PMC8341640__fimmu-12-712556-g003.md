caption: 'PARPs regulate the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses. LPS stimulates
  the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway depending on TRIF (toll-receptor-associated
  activator of interferon) and MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88). PARP12 is
  recruited and co-localized with p62 in the aggresome-like induced structures (ALIS),
  which acts as a platform for NF-κB signaling; PARP12 interacts and co-localizes
  with TRIF, leading to an enhancement of NF-κB signaling. PARP10 inhibits the activation
  of IKKγ through two mechanisms: competitively binding of K63-polyubiquitination
  to interfere with IKKγ’s polyubiquitylation and interacting with IKKγ to promote
  its mono-ADP-ribosylation, leading to the inhibition of p65 translocation into the
  nucleus. The phosphorylation of PARP1 results in the PARylation of the NF-κB subunit
  p65. The direct interaction with both subunits of NF-κB (p50 and p65) by PARP1 promotes
  NF-κB-inducible cytokine production. PARP1 mediates the PARylation of high-mobility
  group box 1 (HMGB1), following by subsequent acetylation, and then induces its release
  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.'
