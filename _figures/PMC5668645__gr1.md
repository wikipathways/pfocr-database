caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of phytoalexin in rice and GA biosynthetic
  pathway. The biosynthetic pathways of gibberellins (open arrows) and diterpene phytoalexins
  (solid arrows) are shown. Dashed arrows indicate multiple enzymatic reactions. The
  products of the biosyntheses, including momilactones, phytocassanes and oryzalexin
  S, could be analyzed by LC–MS/MS, whereas the hydrocarbon and its oxide (indicated
  by box) are usually analyzed by GC–MS.
