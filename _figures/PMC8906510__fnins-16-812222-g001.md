caption: 'The astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS). Glucose is imported into neurons
  and astrocytes by their respective transporters, GLUT1 and GLUT3, before being phosphorylated
  by hexokinase. In neurons most glucose-phosphate is subsequently metabolized along
  the pentose phosphate pathway, with the early glycolytic enzyme PFKFB3 being inhibited
  by ubiquitin action. In astrocytes glucose-phosphate is converted into glycogen
  for storage or metabolized via glycolysis to produce pyruvate, which either enters
  the mitochondria or is converted into lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 5.
  Lactate is exported by the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1 and 4 and imported
  into neurons via the MCT 2. It is then converted back to pyruvate via LDH-1 and
  enters the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation cycle. HK, hexokinase; PDHK4,
