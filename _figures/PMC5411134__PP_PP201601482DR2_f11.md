caption: A proposed model showing tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in mitochondria of gametophyte
  cells and the effect of AtHEMN1 disruption on male and female gametophyte development
  in Arabidopsis. LIN2 (hemF) and AtHEMN1 (hemN) convert coproporphyrinogen to protoporphyrinogen
  in plastids and in mitochondria, respectively. The source of uroporphyrinogen in
  mitochondria is currently unknown (locally synthesized or acquired from plastids)
  and is denoted with the dotted red arrow. We propose that the AtHEMN1 (hemN)-mediated
  conversion of coproporphyrinogen to protoporphyrinogen is affected in mitochondria
  by the Athemn1 mutation without disturbing the same in plastids. This leads to the
  accumulation of coproporphyrinogen and a drop in the levels of protoporphyrinogen
  and subsequent downstream pathway intermediates in the mitochondria in the Athemn1
  mutant. Black arrows indicate normal tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in plastids and mitochondria.
  In mitochondria, the red solid line indicates inhibition of the conversion of coproporphyrinogen
  to protoporphyrinogen. Red dotted lines between protoporphyrinogen and heme indicate
  reduced accumulation of these products in the Athemn1 mutant. Accumulated coproporphyrinogen
  leads to an increased generation of  partly attributed to its photooxidation. The
  inadequate supply of heme in the mitochondria affects the synthesis of cytochrome
  c, affects the electron transport chain, and contributes to the generation of .
  The -mediated oxidative damage of mitochondria impairs microspore development, leading
  to pollen abortion. Increased  production in the mitochondria around the central
  cell of the female gametophyte prevents the fusion of polar nuclei and thereby affects
  ovule and seed development in Arabidopsis. UPN, Unfused polar nuclei.
