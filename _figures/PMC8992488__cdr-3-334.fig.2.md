caption: 'AhR activation not only increases CYP1B1 and the NAS/melatonin ratio but
  also oxidizes S1P lyase, leading to an increase in S1P. S1P is increased and ceramide
  decreased by the elevation in acid ceramidase in GBM/GSC. The increase in the S1P/ceramide
  ratio contributes to GBM/GSC survival, proliferation, migration and chemoresistance.
  The decrease in ceramide attenuates its suppression of 14-3-3, thereby potentiating
  the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway. Pineal melatonin is taken up by PEPT1/2
  into mitochondria and induces Bmal1, which inhibits PDK, leading to disinhibition
  of the PDC, resulting in increased conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA
  increases ATP from the TCA cycle and OXPHOS, as well as being a necessary co-substrate
  for AANAT and melatonergic pathway activation. Melatonin is intimately linked with
  the regulation of sirtuins and with antioxidant enzymes, including SOD2. Melatonin
  also inhibits the oxidized S1P lyase, leading to a decrease in S1P oncogenic effects.
  It is by such processes that variations in the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway
  are intimately linked to the intra- and extracellular processes in GBM/GSC and the
  cells of the tumour microenvironment. AANAT: aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase; AhR:
