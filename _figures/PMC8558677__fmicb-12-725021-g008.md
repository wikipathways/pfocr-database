caption: 'Concept-based map illustrating putative interactions between light regime
  (non-blue light: yellow background; blue light: blue background), plant responses
  and responses of Pseudomonas sp. based on the results obtained and including literature
  knowledge. Pathways for biosurfactant and biofilm formation are based on Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) map02025 “Biofilm formation–Pseudomonas aeruginosa”
  (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/highlight_pathway?scale=1.0&map=map02025&keyword=biofilmPseudomonas).
  The yellow framed boxes on the left display pathways involved into biofilm formation
  and the dotted arrows link to the main signaling cascades. The C4-HSL = N-butyryl-l-homoserine
  lactone, links to the Rhl-system = two lux-type quorum sensing systems, and further
  to the Las-system. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa this is consisting of two components,
  namely an autoinducer synthesizing acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) from methionine
  and a transcriptional controller and mediates the formation of C4-HSL (N-butanoyl
  homoserine) which enables communication between bacterial cells among others biofilm
  formation. Interlinked between these the MvfR = transcriptional regulator moderating
  the expression of QS-based virulence factors, mediates a feedback system. The QS,
  quorum sensing, also acts into the Las-system impacting together with the Gac, global
  regulatory system for activation of antibiotic and cyanide synthesis, the RmsA,
  small RNA binding protein; the Gac/Rms pathway allows the organism to switch between
  primary and secondary metabolism; c-di-GMP, Bis-(3′–5′)-cyclic dimeric guanosine
  monophosphate, then also majorly acts on processes of the biofilm formation via
  impacting features like Polysaccharide formation, alginate biosynthesis, etc. According
  to the experimental findings, it is clear, that blue light regimes impacts several
  features of bacterial habit in the indicated way. However, it needs further investigation
  to identify the molecular mechanisms and locations of these influences.'
