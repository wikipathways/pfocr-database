caption: Unlike the 20S proteasome, the subunits of the Immunoproteasome lack functional
  EpRE binding domains, and so cannot be regulated by Nrf2. Instead, the Interferon
  gamma (IFNγ) pathway may be activated. When IFNγ is added to cells it triggers the
  activation of Jak1 and Jak2, resulting in the dimerization and phosphorylation of
  Stat1. Activation of Stat1 is also possible through oxidative stress, (without IFNγ
  addition) as hydrogen peroxide has been found to cause dimerization of Stat1. In
  turn, Stat1 translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to interferon-1 (IRF-1).
  Following translation, IRF-1 moves back into the nucleus to increase expression
  of the immunoproteasome subunits. A potential alternative route for Immunoproteasome
  regulation is through the NF-κB pathway. Upon an oxidative insult, Protein Kinase
  D (PKD) becomes phosphorylated, which acts to disassociate IκBα from NF-κB (the
  DNA binding domain protein dimers p50 and p65). In turn, IκBα is degraded by the
  proteasome and NF-κB can migrate into the nucleus where it may potentially interact
  with, and regulate the expression of, the Immunoproteasome subunits.
