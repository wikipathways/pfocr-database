caption: 'Everolimus decreases EC activation via suppressing the NF-κB pathway with
  decreased p65 translocation into cell nuclei causing the modulation of E-selectin
  and VCAM-1 expression as well as miR-181b level at transcriptional and post-transcriptional
  level, respectively. EC: endothelial cell, TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor alpha, SELE:
  E-selectin, VCAM-1: vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, RISC: RNA-induced silencing
  complex.'
