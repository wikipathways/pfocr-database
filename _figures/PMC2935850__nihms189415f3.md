caption: A) First and second generation non-steroidal antiandrogens as well as the
  novel compound BMS 641988 share a toliudide backbone with increasing bulk. MDV3100
  is a non-steroidal antiandrogen with a thiohydantoin backbone. Cyproterone actetate
  (CPA), abiraterone, and VN/124-1 are all steroidal compounds similar to progesterone.
  CPA is an antiandrogen with partial agonist properties; abiraterone is an irreversible
  inhibitor of CYP17, and VN/124-1 both inhibits both CYP17 and binds AR and causes
  its degradation. B) The steroid synthesis pathway starts with the generation of
  pregnenolone from cholesterol. CYP17 and 3β-HSD are present in both adrenal glands
  and testes and generates weak androgens androsteinedione and DEAS. 17-ketoreductase
  in the testes further generates testosterone. In peripheral tissues, testosterone
  is converted to the more potent DHT by 5α-reductase. In CRPC, the enzymes involved
  in androgen synthesis (CYP17, 3β-HSD, 17-ketoreductase, 5α-reductase) have been
  found to be cancer cells (, , ).
