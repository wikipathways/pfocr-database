caption: 'The interactions between TME and glioma cells are complex, as the multiple
  players of widespread origin show. Intracellular factors, pathways, cytokines, genetic
  alterations, or environmental properties are involved, and the molecular characteristics
  of glioma cells are dependent on these parameters. Furthermore, vice versa, the
  glioma molecular patterns influence the TME composition. The detailed interactions
  are listed in the text. Abbreviations: 1p19q, combined loss of the short-arm chromosome
  1 (i.e., 1p) and the long-arm chromosome 19 (i.e., 19q); ATRX, transcriptional regulator
  ATRX also known as ATP-dependent helicase ATRX (-mut, mutation); BRAF (human gene
  that encodes a protein called B-Raf); CCL2, CC-chemokine-ligand-2; CCR2, C–C chemokine
  receptor type 2; CDK4/6, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6; CD133, CD133–prominin
  1, PROM1, is a transmembrane protein; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor (vIII,
  variant III); EVs, extracellular vesicles; IDH1, isocitrate dehydrogenase-(1) (mut,
  mutation; wt, wild type); IL-family, interleukin family; KIAA1549-BRAAF, KIAA1549
  (protein-coding gene); LOX, lysyl oxidase, also known as protein-lysine 6-oxidase;
  MGMT, O6-methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin;
  NF1, neurofibromatosis type 1; NF-κB, nuclear factor “kappa-light-chain-enhancer”
  of activated B-cells; P53, tumor protein P53 or tumor suppressor p53; PD-L1, programmed
  death-ligand 1; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin
  homolog; RAS, RAS proteins control signaling pathways that are key regulators of
  normal cell growth and malignant transformation; RB1, RB transcriptional corepressor
  1; TME, tumor microenvironment; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; WNT, Wnt signaling pathway;
  antiporter system xc−'
