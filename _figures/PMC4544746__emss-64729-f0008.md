caption: a, In wild type embryos, the Dll4-rich leading tip cell (red) of the emerging
  sprout activates in adjacent cells higher levels of Notch signaling which directs
  them to acquire a stalk cell behavior (blue). Notch activation and target gene expression
  (Hey and Hes) downregulates the expression of VEGFR2, VEGFR3 and Dll4, and upregulates
  VEGFR1 resulting in stalk cell behavior. Downstream of Smad1/5 signaling, Id proteins
  release the negative autoregulatory loop of Hes1 in stalk cells. Conversely, increasing
  levels of the Notch target Hey1 will progressively inhibit Id steady-state levels,
  which will then indirectly cause attenuation of the Notch pathway by Hes1 downregulation.
  b, Absence of Id proteins in Smad1/5 deficient ECs will result in Hes1 downregulation.
  High levels of VEGFR2 and Dll4, and deficient Notch target gene expression in stalk
  cells turn them into a tip cell-like cell phenotype (pink) and prevents the downregulation
  of Notch1 signaling (nuclear NICD accumulation) in the leading ‘tip’ cells. The
  failure to balance tip versus stalk cell ratios and to transiently stabilize stalk
  cells, together with impaired tip cell polarity and directed migration, is likely
  to cause excessive sprouting and vessel coalescence in mutant embryos.
