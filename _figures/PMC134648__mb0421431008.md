caption: A model for the role of Axin2 in Wnt signal transduction. Upon transduction
  of a Wnt signal, transcription of the Axin2 gene is induced via the β-catenin/Tcf
  pathway. Our point mutation analysis, as well as data from cotransfection of DN-Tcf,
  suggests that Axin2 expression is controlled by Tcf/LEF factors. In addition to
  direct induction, Axin2 may be further induced by an indirect mechanism, in which
  Tcf enhances the expression of unknown transcription factor(s) X, which in turn
  enhances Axin2 expression through a mechanism not requiring the Tcf/LEF binding
  sites. Thus, Axin2 may provide a negative feedback loop for the down regulation
  of β-catenin to normal levels after a Wnt signal.
