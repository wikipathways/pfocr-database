caption: (A) The conical model for Notch pathway activation, where membrane bound
  ligands such as Jagged-1 activates Notch signaling in contacting cells.(B) Schematic
  summarizing our proposed model for paracrine activation of the Notch pathway in
  CRC cells. ADAM17 cleaves membrane bound Jagged-1 on ECs, releasing an N-terminal
  soluble fragment that binds, and activates, Notch on CRC cells.
