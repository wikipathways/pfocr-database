caption: 'Role of MALT1 in signaling to NF-κB in ABC DLBCL. Shown are two prominent
  pathways leading to NF-κB activation in ABC DLBCL: chronic active BCR signaling
  and constitutive MYD88 signaling. MALT1 plays a key role in the BCR pathway in two
  ways. First, as a component of the CBM complex with CARD11 and BCL10, MALT1 helps
  recruit and activate IκB kinase (IKK). Second, MALT1 protease activity potentiates
  NF-κB signaling by cleaving and inactivating two negative regulators of IKK, A20
  (TNFAIP3) and CYLD. Shown are recurrent mutations in ABC DLBCL tumors that cause
  or intensify NF-κB activity.'
