caption: XH influence on lipid and glucose metabolism. XH exhibits antiobesity and
  antiglycemic effects by modulating the AMPK pathway. XH increases ROS, which can
  directly activate AMPK or decrease mitochondrial coupling, resulting in an increased
  AMP/ATP ratio, and in turn activate the AMPK pathway. AMPK phosphorylates multiple
  targets, including PPAR-α and SREBP, which results in increased β-oxidation and
  lipolysis and decreased fatty acid synthesis and adipogenesis.–
