caption: Dual and context-dependent role of LIF/LIFR axis as tumor promoter and suppressor
  supporting cancer progression and metastasis. Several different molecular mechanisms
  regulate LIF/LIFR signaling in various cancers. LIF and LIFR signals through various
  mechanism (s) and function as both tumor promoters and tumor suppressors in various
  malignancies. (A) Cancer promoting role and function of LIF/LIFR signaling. In prostate
  cancer cells, a lineage-specific transcription factor ZBTB46 is activated upon androgen
  deprivation therapy. The nuclear association of ZBTB46 induces LIF and subsequently
  leads to the activation of STAT3. LIF signaling induces ZBTB46 nuclear localization
  to support ZBTB46 oncogenic function and neuroendocrine differentiation as a positive
  feedback mechanism. LIFR act as a metastasis promoter in melanoma. LIFR levels progressively
  increase from normal nevi to primary melanoma, followed by metastatic melanoma.
  Knockdown of LIFR reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 but not YAP. LIFR was demonstrated
  to promote metastasis via MMP2 regulation. In pancreatic cancer, a vicious cycle
  is maintained between stellate cells in the stroma and pancreatic cancer cells in
  the epithelia. Genetic and pharmacological blockade of LIF/LIFR signaling was demonstrated
  to inhibit pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis, mainly by modulating epithelial
  to mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype through downregulation of ZEB1. Differential
  phosphorylation of STAT3 by LIF/LIFR signaling regulates the EMT and mesenchymal
  to epithelial transition (MET) switch. In lung cancer cells, a specific CD133+/CD83+
  population acquires early migratory potential by activating LIFR/ERK/STAT3 (Serine
  727) phosphorylation, resulting in transcription regulation of Cyclin Dl, GATA3,
  and E-Cadherin. On the other hand, upon persistent treatment of bone marrow-derived
  mesenchymal stem cells, derived media exposure to other specific CD151+/CD38+ populations
  exhibit activation of STAT3 signaling by activating IL-6R/phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyrosine
  705), resulting in downregulation of E-Cadherin and upregulation of Twist1 showing
  the re-differentiation (MET) phenotype. LIF negatively regulates p53 expression.
  LIF/LIFR signaling mediates STAT3 activation, which in turn induces inhibitor of
  DNA binding 1 (ID1) gene to upregulate MDM2. Translational increases in the MDM2
  by LIF accelerate the degradation of p53 protein expression; thereby, LIF negatively
  regulates p53 function via STAT3/ID1/MDM2 pathway. (B) Tumor suppressor role and
  function of LIF/LIFR axis. In pancreatic cancer, LIFR suppresses the growth, invasion,
  and migration of PC cells in vitro and metastasis in vivo by inducing epithelial
  marker E-cadherin and suppressing mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and slug
  as well as altering β-catenin. LIFR suppresses the metastatic potential of breast
  cancer cells by inactivation of functional Hippo-Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling.
  Similar to breast and pancreatic cancer, LIFR also negatively regulates HCC metastasis
  by activating JAK1/PI3K/AKT pathway resulting in MMP13 expressional alteration forcing
  towards lung metastasis.
