caption: Mechanism of myosin II–mediated release of microparticles from endothelial
  cells activated by anti-β2GPI antibodies. In this diagram, crosslinking of β2GPI
  bound to a cell surface receptor (ie, annexin A2) leads to activation of intracellular
  signaling, including the TLR4–NF-κB pathway. ERK 1/2 and ROCK are also activated,
  though the pathways leading to activation of these kinases have not been clearly
  defined. We propose that ERK mediates activation of MLCK and that MLCK and ROCK
  mediate phosphorylation of RLC on T18/S19; activation by both MLCK and ROCK may
  be needed to achieve sufficient RLC phosphorylation to trigger subsequent events.
  Phosphorylated RLC causes the myosin heavy chain to unfold and bind actin, leading
  to submembranous actin-myosin assembly. Submembranous contractile forces promote
  budding of microparticles from the endothelial cell surface membrane. Y-27632, ML-7,
  and blebbistatin inhibit various steps in this pathway, impairing microparticle
  release. However, the expression of cell surface E-selectin is not impaired by these
  inhibitors.
