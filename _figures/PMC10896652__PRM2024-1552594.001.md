caption: Relationship between NGF/TrKA signaling pathway and KOA peripheral hyperalgesia.
  Notes. (a) The activation of NGF/TrkA promotes the release of pain-related neuropeptides
  such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) and activates
  TRPV1 on nociceptor terminal; NGF/TrKA complex is transported to DRG via cytokinesis.
  (b) The NGF/TrKA complex promotes DRG sensitivity and causes increased expression
  of TRPV1, PGP9.5, and S100, and it may also cause peripheral sensory nerve fiber
  sprouting
