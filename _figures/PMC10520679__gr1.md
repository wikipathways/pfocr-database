caption: 'Pathways involved in exosome biogenesis. Exosome biogenesis concludes several
  steps: [] Endocytosis, the process of the plasma membrane''s inward budding; []
  early endosome formation resulting from the inward budding of the plasma membrane;
  [] late endosome: in this process, the early endosome membrane buds inward to start
  the process of cargo loading; [] the ILV follows the previous process where cargo
  loading and scission of the ILVs occur; [] the MVB contains all synthesized exosomes
  and will undergo two possible processes: (6a) where the plasma membrane is agitated
  by the MVB to secrete its exosomal cargo into the extracellular environment; (6b)
  where the MVB undergoes-lysosomal degradation from the step of the early endosome
  up to the formation of the MVB, several pathways are involved in the process of
  cargo sorting into late endosomes; namely, (2a) represents the classical ESCRT machinery
  pathway, where ubiquitinated cargo proteins rely on early functioning ESCRTs (ESCRT-I,
  II, and III) to be loaded into ILV, and ESCRT-III is involved in the scission of
  these ILV to form MVB. (2b) Represents the Syndecan-Syntenin-Alix pathway with its
  regulators, SRC and ARF6/PLD2. (2c) Represents the Alix-ESCRT–III–tetraspanin pathway.
  The 2a and 2b pathways depend on Alix''s unique feature to deliver un ubiquitinated
  cargoes directly to ESCRT-III, escaping the need for early ESRTs. (2d) Represents
  an ESCRT-independent pathway mediated by Rab31 activating the EGFR receptor to later
  form a complex of Rab31-EGFR-FLOT and drive exosome biogenesis independently from
  all ESCRT machinery. Rab31 then conjugates with TBC1D2B to inactivate Rab7 and prevent
  its lysosomal degradation.'
