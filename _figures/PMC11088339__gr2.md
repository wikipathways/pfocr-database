  cardiac fibrosisTGF-β regulate phenotypes of the cells through activation of mothers
  against decapentaplegic (SMAD)-related pathway together with p38 pathway. Direct
  effects on fibroblast-to-myofibroblast conversion and activation may likely be of
  greater importance, but TGF-β-induced fibrogenesis may be further related to its
  effect on macrophage phenotype, lymphocyte differentiation and function, and cardiomyocyte
  viability (see Figure 1) as well as activation of TGF- β targets genes like matrix
  metalloproteinases (MMPs). Note: ECM, extracellular matrix; TAK, transforming growth
