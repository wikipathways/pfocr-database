caption: Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and potential therapeutic applications. (A) BC-LI-0186
  binds to the RagD interacting site of LRS, thus suppressing the lysosomal localization
  and activity of mTORC1. (B) BC-DXI-843 promotes the degradation of AIMP2-DX2 by
  blocking the interaction between AIMP2-DX2 and HSP70, thereby inducing cancer cell
  apoptosis. (C) BC-K-YH16899 not only blocks the interaction of KRS and 67LR by binding
  to KRS, but also reduces the KRS membrane localization by restraining the flexible
  N-ext of KRS. (D) Macrophages secretes GRS under the stimulation of Fas ligand released
  by tumor cells. The secreted GRS interacts with specific ERK-activated tumor cells
  through CDH6, thereby enhancing PP2A activity by releasing PP2A from CDH6. The activated
  PP2A inhibits ERK signaling by binding to ERK and thus induces apoptosis of cancer
  cells. (E) AIMP1 inhibits the lung metastasis of melanoma cells in mice through
  macrophage-mediated activation of NK cells. AIMP1 induces macrophages to produce
  TNF-α, which partially activates NK cells. Meanwhile, the activation of NK cells
  requires the direct contact between NK cells and macrophages. (F) The knockdown
  of RARS-MAD1L1 using siRARS-005 or siMAD1L1-003 inhibits cancer development by suppressing
  FBP/c-Myc pathway. ARSs, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases; LRS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase;
