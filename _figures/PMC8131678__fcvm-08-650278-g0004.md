caption: Main possible shared mechanisms underlying HF and comorbidities. HF, comorbidities,
  and risk factors may have some shared chronic conditions such as insulin resistance,
  hypoxia, and chronic inflammation, these conditions aggravate HF and cause comorbidities.
  The mechanism of comorbidities contribute to HF can be clarified similarly. Cardiac
  energy metabolic remodeling may take place in these conditions mediated by activating
  the AMPK signaling. Metabolic remodeling can activate PI3K/AKT pathway, which promotes
  myocardial over-growth and cardiac hypertrophy and can cause mitochondrial injury.
  The mTOR signaling may be activated by AMPK and PI3K/AKT pathways can cause disturbed
  autophagy which aggravates the mitochondrial injury. Ischemia and hypoxia conditions
  can activate MAPK and HIF-1 pathways, which contribute to cardiac structure remodeling.
  Innate immune cells, mainly monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, can trigger
  the immune response and systemic inflammation by secreting IL-1β and IL-6. Moreover,
  the pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate T cells to polarize to Th17 cells and release
  IL-17. Systemic inflammation can cause diastolic dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy.
