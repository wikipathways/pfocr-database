caption: The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication network linking the central
  nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal tract via neural, endocrine, immune, and
  metabolic pathways. The vagus nerve mediates direct signaling through afferent (gut-to-brain)
  and efferent (brain-to-gut) fibers, while stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  (HPA) axis, triggering cortisol release that disrupts gut motility, barrier function,
  and immunity. Gut microbiota influence the gut-brain axis by producing short-chain
  fatty acids (SCFAs), neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, dopamine and GABA), and
  hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which regulate neuro-inflammation,
  metabolism, and mood. Immune-derived cytokines from the gut can cross the blood-brain
  barrier, modulating neuro-inflammatory processes and cognition. This interplay integrates
  gut physiology with brain function, impacting stress responses, appetite, and mental
  health
