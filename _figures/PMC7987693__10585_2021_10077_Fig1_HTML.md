caption: TGFβ signaling pathways in EMT. Cleavage of the pro-domain latency-associated
  peptide (LAP) releases active TGFβ that can bind cell surface receptors. Cell surface
  receptors include the Type III receptor (TGFβRIII/betaglycan), Type II receptor
  (TGFβRII) and the Type I receptor (TGFβRI) (also see Table ). TGFβ elicits cellular
  responses by forming ligand-receptor ternary complexes. Constitutively active TGFβRII
  transphosphorylates TGFβRI on Ser-thr residues, activating its kinase activity,
  which in turn phosphorylates SMAD2/3 (blue). Phosphorylated SMAD2/3 forms heterocomplexes
  (heterotrimeric or dimeric) with SMAD4 and accumulates in the nucleus to regulate
  expression of genes associated with EMT. SMAD7 (red) terminates signaling by increasing
  turnover of the kinase receptors. TGFβ also mediates cellular responses via alternate
  signaling pathways including (from L-R) TAK1 activation by TGFβRI mediated TRAF6
  ubiquitination that can induce NF-κB, JNK, p38MAP kinase signaling; induction of
  PI3K and AKT-mTOR signaling; TGFβ also regulates the WNT/β-catenin pathway via AKT
  inhibition of GSK-3β, releasing β-catenin for nuclear accumulation; TGFβ induces
  activation of RhoA-ROCK signaling; activates MEK/ERK pathway via phosphorylation
  of ShcA by TGFβRI leading to Ras activation and downstream MAP Kinases; TGFβ promotes
  interaction between CDC42/RAC1 and PAK2. Activation of TGFβ signaling either via
  SMAD or alternate pathways can induce expression of several EMT-TFs such as TWIST,
  SNAIL, ZEB to promote EMT and lead to repression of E-Cadherin. miRNAs and lncRNAs
  also play a role in TGFβ mediated EMT by either inhibiting or stimulating EMT. miR-34a,
  -324-5p antagonizes TGFβ-SMAD induction of EMT whereas miR-155, −9, −10b, −181a
  activate EMT
