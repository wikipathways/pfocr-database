caption: Effects of the two main anabolic pathways, PTH and Wnt signaling, on osteoblasts,
  and indirectly on osteoclasts. PTH and Wnt both stimulate the proliferation of mesenchymal
  stem cells (MSCs) and the commitment of these cells into the osteoblast (OB) lineage,
  whereas the differentiation into chondrocytes and adipocytes is prevented by canonical
  Wnt signaling. In the late OB, both pathways increase the mineral apposition and
  bone formations rate (MAR, BFR). In addition, the Wnt pathway stimulates the production
  of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble decoy receptor for the RANKL, preventing osteoclast
  (OC) differentiation and function. In contrast, PTH stimulates the secretion of
  RANKL, which binds to its receptor RANK on OC precursor cells (OC-pre) and mature
  OCs, thereby stimulating OC differentiation, function, and ultimately bone resorption.
  Wnt activity is inhibited by sclerostin and Dkk1, both secreted by late OBs and
  osteocytes. PTH represses the expression of both sclerostin and Dkk1, whereas Dkk1
  expression is increased by Wnt activity, establishing a negative feedback loop.
  Thus, PTH and Wnt signaling pathways increase bone formation through several mechanisms,
  but only the Wnt pathway represses bone resorption, whereas PTH stimulates OCs via
  the induction of RANKL production by OBs.
