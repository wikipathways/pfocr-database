caption: The mitogen activated protein [MAP] kinase signalling pathways. The MAPK
  pathways include three main families (extracellular regulating kinases, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinases, and p38) that form an integrating and amplifying cascade of 3 kinase tiers.
  JNKs are activated via the sequential activation of protein kinases that includes
  two dual-specificity MAP kinase kinases (MKK4 and MKK7) and multiple MAP kinase
  kinase kinases (MKKKs) such as ASK1, MEKK1-4, TAK1-3 or MLK1-3. The top level shows
  the MKKKs, the second tier shows the MKKs, and the third tier consists of the MAP
  kinases. Each pathway activates a variety of transcription factors that regulate
  genes involved with cell survival, proliferation, and inflammation. There is considerable
  overlap of the genes regulated by the individual MAPKs. Gadd45ß is shown as a negative
  regulatory mechanism that suppresses JNK by blocking MKK7. ASK, apoptosis signal
  regulating kinase; ATF, activating transcription factor; IL, interleukin; MAPKAP,
  MAPK activated protein; MEKK, MKK kinase; TAK, TGFβ associated kinase.
