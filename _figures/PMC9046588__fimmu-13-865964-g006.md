caption: Arginine methylation and related oncogenic pathways. (A) PRMT5 increases
  H3R8 methylation in the promoter region of WNT/β-catenin antagonist genes Axin1
  and Axin2, epigenetically suppresses Axin expression to promote WNT/β-catenin signaling,
  and targets gene expression. The PRMT1-mediated methylation of Axin decreases ubiquitination
  and enhances Axin stability, which degrades cytoplasmic β-catenin levels. Furthermore,
  CARM1 and p300 are recruited by β-catenin as coactivators, and H3R17 dimethylation
  is induced to modulate endogenous WNT target gene expression. (B) The mono-methylation
  of EGFR by the PRMT5-MEP50 complex positively modulates its trans-autophosphorylation
  at Tyr 1173, which enhances EGFR-SHP1 binding, suppresses SOS phosphorylation, and
  is followed by EGFR-mediated ERK activation. Additionally, PRMT5 and PRMT6 both
  methylate CRAF to reduce its stability and catalytic activity, thereby diminishing
  the amplitude of the ERK1/2 output in the RAS signaling pathway. (C) The PRMT5-MEP50
  complex methylates PI3K to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, with PTEN asymmetrically
  dimethylated by PRMT6 which decreases PTEN phosphatase activity and impedes its
  ability to inhibit the PI3K-AKT cascade. PRMT5-mediated AKT1 methylation enhances
  AKT mRNA translation, and PRMT5 is also required for AKT phosphorylation at Thr308
  and Ser473, suggesting PRMT5 is an important upstream regulator of Akt, and induces
  the PI3K/AKT pathway. EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; SHP1, SH2-containing
  protein tyrosine phos-phatase-1; SOS, son of sevenless; ERK, extracellular regulated
  protein kinases; RAS, rat sarcoma; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT, protein
  kinase B; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog.
