caption: 'Contribution of proximal signaling complexes downstream of FcɛRI to Ca2+
  flux and ERK activation. Upon mast cell activation through FcɛRI, both LAT1 and
  LAT2 recruit SLP-76 to the plasma membrane and allow for SLP-76 phosphorylation.
  This occurs through the GADS-binding domain of SLP-76, implicating the involvement
  of GADS in this process. Three distinct molecular complexes involving PLCγ contribute
  to its activation: LAT1/SLP-76, LAT2/SLP-76, and LAT1 alone. Because LAT1, but not
  LAT2, cooperatively binds to PLCγ with SLP-76, LAT1/SLP-76 contributes most to increasing
  intracellular Ca2+ levels. LAT1 and SLP-76 both cooperatively and independently
  lead to ERK phosphorylation. Thus, deletion of both LAT1 and SLP-76 is required
  for disruption of the ERK signaling pathway. SLP-76-independent LAT1-dependent ERK
  activation may involve localization of Grb2/SOS by LAT1. The upstream molecule(s)
  involved in LAT1/2-independent SLP-76 activation leading to ERK phosphorylation
  is unknown at this time.'
