caption: 'Higher spike precision in response to cortical-like EPSPs than dendrodendritic-like
  EPSPs. A, Example unitary (top) and average (bottom) responses to focal 2p-guided
  microstimulation of a presumptive cortical feedback excitatory input to an intact
  GC. Responses to two stimuli separated by 50 ms (20 Hz; timing indicated by asterisks).
  Diagram at left indicates likely location of cortical feedback EPSP based on the
  position of the focal stimulating electrode (apical dendrite, 62 μm from the soma).
  B, Example dendrodendritic EPSPs recorded in an intact GC (blue traces). EPSPs evoked
  by activating APs in a presynaptic mitral cells within a dual simultaneous recording
  (black traces). Inset, Comparison of initial phase and peak (arrows) of average
  cortical (red) and dendrodendritic (blue) EPSPs using the same scaling. C, Example
  responses recorded in the same intact GC to short (3 ms; red) and long (10 ms; blue)
  duration current steps that mimic the rising phase kinetics of cortical and dendrodendritic
  EPSPs. Both steps adjusted to be just-suprathreshold; just-subthreshold responses
  indicated by black traces. D, Plot of AP jitter (latency SD) in just-suprathreshold
  responses to 3 and 10 ms duration current steps. ***p = 9.047E−4, T = 6.026, paired
  t test. E, Summary diagram of three different activation modes for GCs: distal stimulation
  via dendrodendritic EPSPs (left), proximal stimulation via basal dendrite inputs
  (middle), and combined distal and proximal stimulation. Red circles indicate potential
  third excitatory pathway via cortical feedback inputs. Vertical brackets indicate
  likely dendritic zone required for maximal AP (red) and LTS (black) amplitude. Arrows
  indicate likely direction of AP propagation.'
