caption: Previous work shows that centromeric cohesion is independent of Smc3/Psm3
  acetylation, and associated with Pds5 localization to the centromeres. Cohesion
  on the arms is acetylation dependent, and antagonized by Wpl1. Pds5 has both pro-
  and anti-cohesive functions on the arms. Smc5/6 antagonizes both modes of cohesin
  regulation. Top2 dysfunction affects the acetylation-dependent arm pathway, and
  any perturbation to Smc3/Psm3 acetylation results in a dependence on Top2 function
  for survival, suggesting a dynamic role in the acetylation-dependent cohesin cycle.
