caption: MiRNA and host targets are involved in common pathways. (A) NFYC-hsa-miR-30c-5p
  circuit in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is responsible
  for regulating the cell cycle and thus leads to different downstream responses,
  including metabolism, protein synthesis, glycolysis, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression
  among others. NFYC activates transcription of both CCND2 and CDKN1B, promoting G1/S
  transition. hsa-miR-30c-5p antagonizes NFYC by targeting HSP90AA1 and RAC1, thus
  leading to the repression of AKT, which results in the promotion of FOXO, which
  then represses CCND2, thus preventing G1 progression. In addition, AKT also represses
  CDKN1B, thus the repression of AKT promotes CDKN1B, once again, preventing G1 transition
  (). (B) NFYC-hsa-miR-30c-5p circuit in the focal adhesion pathway. NFYC activates
  transcription of CCND2, which promotes cell proliferation in the focal adhesion
  pathway. hsa-miR30c-5p antagonizes its host by targeting MAP2K1 and RAC1, which
  transcribe proteins found upstream of CCND2 in the focal adhesion pathway.
