caption: NF-κB pathway and inflammatory-associated carcinogenesis. NF-κB is involved
  in IBD pathogenesis. NF-κB signaling includes two pathways (the canonical and non-canonical
  pathways), and NF-κB forms a complex with the inhibitor IκB in the cytoplasm in
  both pathways. Activation of the canonical pathway results in phosphorylation of
  IκBα by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. This leads translocation of RelA/p50 into
  the nucleus, and activation of the transcription of target genes. Activation of
  the non-canonical pathway leads the degradation of the p100 to p52. The p52-RelB
  complex translocates into the nucleus and leads the transcription of target genes.
  This pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. It is also involved in the
  carcinogenesis with cytokine-induced tissue injury, tumor initiation, and tumor
  progression.
