caption: (1) SGLT1-mediated glucose transport across the brush border membrane leads
  to enterocyte depolarization and the release of glutamate from neuropod cells reaching
  into the lamina propria. The synaptically released glutamate excites glutamate receptors
  located on sensory nerve terminals originating from unknown vagal afferent neuron
  populations in both the left and right nodose ganglia and projecting through both
  left and right cervical vagus []. (2) Glucose activates via SGLT1 a selective population
  of vagal afferent neurons and in turn a selective population of proenkephalin-expressing
  neurons in the left and right NTS []. (3) Glucose metabolism can influence brain
  reward circuitries by an unknown metabolic sensor and pathway []. (4) After absorption
  and reaching the hepatic-portal vein and liver, glucose activates the mesolimbic
  dopamine system by acting in an unknown fashion on sensory terminals of vagal afferent
  fibers passing through the common hepatic branch associated with the left cervical
  vagus []. (Note that these authors speculate that the postoral sucrose may act on
  neuropod cells or hepatic-portal sensors, admit that there must be pathways in addition
  to the hepatic vagus; and their outcome behavior is operant sugar seeking) (5) The
  presence of intestinal glucose is signaled in an SGLT1-dependent fashion via dorsal
  root afferent neurons passing through the celiac ganglia to inhibit hypothalamic
  AgRP neurons []. (Note that there was no preference testing in this study). Inhibiting
  AgRP neurons conditions flavor preferences []. (6) Fatty acids (FA) derived from
  dietary fat acting in part on intestinal GPR40 and GPR120 sensors signal brain reward
  circuits via undefined pathways to condition CS+ flavor preferences and promote
  fat-seeking behavior []. (7) Dietary fat acting on unspecified intestinal sensors
  activate brain reward systems via CCK-sensitive vagal afferent fibers passing through
  the right nodose ganglion to condition relative preferences for dilute or concentrated
  fat emulsions and promote operant fat-seeking behavior []. (8) Dietary fat acting
  on unspecified intestinal sensors via vagal afferent neurons to inhibit hypothalamic
  AgRP neurons []. Note that studies in rats indicate that the upper small intestine
  is partially innervated by vagal fibers traveling in all the anterior and posterior
  celiac, the anterior and posterior gastric, as well as the gastroduodenal branch
  dividing from the common hepatic branch [].
