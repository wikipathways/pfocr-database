caption: Schematic representation of phosphorylation-dependent targeting  of CREB
  to proteasomal degradation by hypoxia. Hypoxia elicits the  rapid depletion of PP1,
  resulting in decreased dephosphorylation of  proteins within the targeting sequence.
  Resultant hyperphosphorylation  of proteins attracts ubiquitination (Ub) through
  the coordinated  activities of E1, E2, and E3. Ubiquitination of targeted peptides
  leads  to degradation via the 26S proteasome. Proteins degraded through this  targeting
  system in hypoxia include transcriptional modulators  important in transformation
  to the hypoxic phenotype.
