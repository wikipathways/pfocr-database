caption: An overview of the molecular crosslinks produced by the interaction of the
  HSCs and LSCs. AML cells infiltrate the vascular niche of HSCs and directly influence
  the LSCs that initiate the disease [60,61]. In the population of somatic cells with
  stem cell-like features (LSCs), extracellular matrix (ECM) components forced tumor-promoting
  stem cell signaling pathways like KLF4, Bmi-1, Wnt, Nanog, and Oct4, propagating
  metastasis [90,91,92]. HSCs encompass a range of molecules that play crucial roles
  in cellular processes. These markers include the T cell marker TIM3 (also known
  as CD366), which is associated with exhaustion or dysfunction of T cells [63]. Another
  marker is Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61), β-catenin, CD271, and CD146,
  proteins involved in promoting angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels
  in HSCs [86,87,88]
