caption: HCV viral RNA is recognized by RIG-I, which activates MAVS to induce the
  expression of type I IFNs. The HCV NS3/4A protease cleaves MAVS to disrupt the RIG-I
  signaling pathway and blocks the induction of IFN-β and ISGs. The ATG5-ATG12 conjugate
  can bind to RIG-I and MAVS to inhibit their activities. HCV-induced autophagy also
  inhibits the RIG-I signaling pathway, although it is unclear whether this inhibition
  is mediated by the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate. In the presence of IFN-β, autophagy can
  mediate the degradation of HCV core and NS3/4A proteins.
