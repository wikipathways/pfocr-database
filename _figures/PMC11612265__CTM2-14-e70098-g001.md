    HIF‐1a is a key regulator of glycolysis during hypoxia, upregulate the coding
    of aerobic glycolysis enzyme at the transcription level in macrophages. Several
    catalytic enzymes within the glycolytic pathway, including HK, PFKFB3 and PKM,
    along with accumulated mtDNA, could facilitate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
    and subsequent secretion of inflammatory cytokines. This process may also be regulated

    activates the NLRP3 inflammasome via the AMPK signalling pathway, whereas succinate
    promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation through HIF‐1α, leading to the secretion
    of inflammatory cytokines and exacerbating lung injury. Additionally, glucose
    metabolic reprogramming is a pivotal factor influencing macrophage phenotype transformation.
    During ALI, macrophages preferentially engage in aerobic glycolysis, which facilitates
