caption: 'Visual representation of molecular interactions in the HSF flock. The molecular
  interactions for the genes with significantly different abundance between the resistant
  and susceptible lines in the HSF flock in response to a primary Haemonchus contortus
  infection for 3 days were displayed. The network was inferred using Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA v01-13). Solid lines imply direct relationships between gene products
  while dotted lines imply indirect interactions. Red: the genes with a significantly
  higher abundance in the Resistant line than in the susceptible line. Green: the
  genes with a significantly lower abundance in the Resistant line than in the susceptible
  line. The degree of changes in gene abundance is represented by the intensity of
  the color.'
