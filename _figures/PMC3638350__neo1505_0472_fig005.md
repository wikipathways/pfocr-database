caption: A model for the effects of KLF5 on cell survival and apoptosis in ESCC. When
  KLF5 is restored in ESCC cells, KLF5 trans-activates ASK1 and MKK4 to activate the
  JNK pathway. Activated JNK signaling then phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins, leading
  to BAX release and translocation to the mitochondria, to promote apoptosis. In addition,
  KLF5 can directly transactivate BAX to increase BAX levels.
