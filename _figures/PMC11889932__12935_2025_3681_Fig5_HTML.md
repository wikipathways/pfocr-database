caption: The interaction of lipid metabolism pathways of ferroptosis with STAT proteins
  in human diseases. The figure illustrates how STAT proteins (STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6)
  regulate lipid metabolism and ferroptosis in various diseases. STAT1, activated
  by IL-10, promotes ferroptosis in diabetic nephropathy and intestinal injury by
  upregulating ACSL1/ACSL4 and enhancing lipid peroxidation. STAT3, induced by IL-9
  and IL-6, modulates fatty acid oxidation and reduces ferroptosis in acute kidney
  injury and cancers by altering lipid metabolism. STAT6, activated by IL-4/IL-13,
  suppresses ferroptosis in cervical cancer via TAM-derived miRNA-660-5p, which downregulates
  ALOX15
