caption: As part of our effort to characterize unusual sugar biosynthetic pathways
  and to collect genes useful for in vivo glycodiversification of secondary metabolites,  we
  investigated the biosynthesis of D-forosamine (1), a key structural component of
  the spinosyns, which are produced by Saccharopolyspora spinosa and Saccharopolyspora
  pogona. Spinosad, a mixture of Spinosyn A and D (2, 3, ), is a potent yet environmentally
  benign insecticide. Structure-activity studies have shown that D-forosamine is essential
  for the insecticidal properties of the spinosyns. There is also evidence that Spinosad
  promotes wound healing in humans.
