caption: Summarizing diagram of this study, MACC1 overexpression in gastric cancer
  (GC) activates the TWIST1 angiogenetic axis, which leads to upregulation of VEGF-A,
  and facilitates angiogenesis. Then angiogenesis promotes GC cell growth. Hence,
  higher rates of postoperative recurrence are seen in GC patients with increased
  expression of MACC1 and elevated MVD.
