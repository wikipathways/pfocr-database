caption: 'Reconstruction of metabolic pathway of Woesearchaeota in the central carbon
  (a) and comparison of genes relating to the ferredoxin-dependent pathways between
  organisms from oxic and anoxic biotopes (b). Metabolic predictions are mainly generated
  by referring to the interface KEGG and GenBank NCBI-nr database. Each subgroup of
  Woesearchaeota is depicted as a colored circle (see figure legend). Functional genes
  (abbreviation by referring to KEGG) encoding the relevant proteins/enzymes are labeled
  for each metabolic step where colored circles (that is, Woesearchaeotal subgroups)
  are depicted to show the potential functions of each subgroup if any. Solid arrows
  indicate the corresponding genes are detected for the pathways while dotted arrows
  indicate the corresponding genes miss from the pathways. Red “no entry” signs indicate
  the whole pathways missing. The crucial intermediates for methanogenesis are colored
  in green. All putative transporters and A-type ATPases are shown as well as secretory
  pathways (components of the Sec pathway) and predicted components of flagella (Additional file :
  Figure S4). Key metabolic predictions are supported by the gene information in Additional file :
  Dataset S4 and Fig. a. Abbreviations: THF, tetrahydrofuran; APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate;
  PAPS, 3′-Phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate'
