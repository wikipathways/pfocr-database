caption: GDF11 and MSTN are initially synthesized as precursor proteins that undergo
  proteolytic processing to generate biologically active mature dimers. After removal
  of the signal peptide (S) by a signal peptidase, pro-GDF11/MSTN is cleaved by a
  furin-like protease to produce a latent complex, in which the mature domain (MD)
  is noncovalently associated with the prodomain (PD). The latent complex is additionally
  cleaved by a BMP1/TLD-like metalloproteinase to generate the mature, disulfide-linked
  dimer (marked in dark gray) that elicits signal transduction. The latent complex
  has been shown to be capable of existing in a triggered state, allowing it to initiate
  signaling events. The mature GDF11/MSTN ligand binds to activin type 2 receptors
  (ACVR2A/2B) that subsequently recruit activin type 1 receptors (ALK4/5/7) to signal
  through the canonical SMAD2/3 pathway. Activation of noncanonical pathways, including
  ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, has also been reported. In addition, GDF11 has been demonstrated
  to activate the SMAD1/5/9 pathway in endothelial cells and osteoblasts,,,. Dotted
  lines with an arrowhead indicate noncanonical pathways, and solid lines with an
  arrowhead indicate canonical pathways.
