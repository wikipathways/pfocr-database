caption: Transcription factor CREB1 exhibits an opposite regulation in the downstream
  genes between WT and VCP TG mice in response to 2W TAC. Based on the comparison
  between 2W TAC and sham controls, in WT and VCP TG mice, respectively, an Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen’s ) of the RNA-seq data identified CREB1 as a top
  transcription factor in both WT and VCP TG mice but showing an opposite regulation
  between two groups (Data were analyzed through the use of IPA (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis)).
  CREB1 mediated signaling was predicted to be activated in WT (a) but inhibited in
  VCP TG mice (b).
