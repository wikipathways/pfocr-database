caption: The cell response to HU-induced depletion of dNTPs during replication. Origins
  licensed on the DNA strand are grouped into replication “factories” the activation
  of which is strictly defined in time, from early- to late-replicating. In normal
  conditions, only a small percentage of origins will become activated and start to
  replicate DNA; the other origins remain dormant and will be replicated passively
  unless they are needed (A). If the currently replicating factory already has the
  desired amount of active forks, an ATR/Chk1 signaling mechanism limits dormant origin
  firing and also limits the activation of other factories that are supposed to replicate
  later (C). In the absence of free dNTPs (B), active forks stall and expose fragile
  ssDNA (B,C). ATR kinases stabilize stalled forks and also trigger the signaling
  pathway of the S-phase checkpoint, which arrests the cell cycle, inhibits origin
  firing in inactive factories, and restores RNR activity (C). The cell is unable
  to enter mitosis unless DNA replication is finished and any damage repaired (C).

  description: The cell response to HU-induced depletion of dNTPs during replication.
    Origins licensed on the DNA strand are grouped into replication “factories” the
    activation of which is strictly defined in time, from early- to late-replicating.
    In normal conditions, only a small percentage of origins will become activated
    and start to replicate DNA; the other origins remain dormant and will be replicated

    has the desired amount of active forks, an ATR/Chk1 signaling mechanism limits

    stall and expose fragile ssDNA (B,C). ATR kinases stabilize stalled forks and
    also trigger the signaling pathway of the S-phase checkpoint, which arrests the
    cell cycle, inhibits origin firing in inactive factories, and restores RNR activity
