caption: ER stress signaling regulates VEGFA expression via its principal regulators
  Ire1α, Perk and ATF6α. Proposed pathway shows how ER stress signaling might affect
  growth and survival of both developing placenta as well as tumor through angiogenesis.
  This is accomplished by activating VEGFA transcription via different regulatory
  regions on the VEGFA gene.
