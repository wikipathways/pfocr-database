caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes unique to emerin-null
  cells during transition from day 0 to day 1 of differentiation. (A,B) IPA identified
  the VEGF (A) and IGF-1 (B) signaling pathways as enriched. The network was generated
  through the use of IPA (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com) on normalized mRNA
  values. Nodes represent molecules in a pathway, while the biological relationship
  between nodes is represented by a line (edge). Edges are supported by at least one
  reference in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The intensity of color in a node indicates
  the degree of up- (red) or down- (green) regulation. Nodes are displayed using shapes
  that represent the functional class of a gene product (Circle = Other, Nested Circle
  = Group or Complex, Rhombus = Peptidase, Square = Cytokine, Triangle = Kinase, Vertical
  ellipse = Transmembrane receptor). Edges are marked with symbols to represent the
  relationship between nodes (Line only = Binding only, Flat line = inhibits, Solid
  arrow = Acts on, Solid arrow with flat line = inhibits and acts on, Open circle
  = leads to, Open arrow = translocates to).
