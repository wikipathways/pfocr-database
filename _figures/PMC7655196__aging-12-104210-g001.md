caption: Summary scheme of MerTK-mediated macrophage HSC crosstalk pathway in fibrotic
  NASH. In healthy liver, MerTK in resident macrophages is inactivated due to the
  absence of GAS6. In steatosis, ATRA-induced MerTK cleavage suppresses MerTK signaling.
  However, during progression to fibrotic NASH, MerTK signaling is restored by suppression
  of MerTK cleavage, leading to TGFB1 induction and HSC activation.
