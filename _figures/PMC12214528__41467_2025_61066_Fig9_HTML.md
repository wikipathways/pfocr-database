caption: In the absence of ethylene, the active ETRs interact with CTR1, suppressing
  the ethylene signaling pathway; ethylene could cause disassociation of CTR1 and
  ETRs and the released CTR1 will initiate ethylene signaling. The ethylene-bound
  receptors were recognized by UBC32-RED module and then degraded via ERAD. Meanwhile,
  activation of ethylene signaling resulted in elevation of ETRs expression and de
  novo synthesis of active receptors, replacing the degraded ethylene-bound receptors
