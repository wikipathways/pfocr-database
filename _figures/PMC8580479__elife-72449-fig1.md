caption: Cells may be induced to senesce by different stimuli, including telomere
  erosion, oncogene activation (oncogene-induced senescence [OIS]), DNA damage, oxidative
  stress, irradiation, chemotherapy, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming,
  developmental cues, and tissue damage. These stresses trigger the upregulation of
  key cell cycle inhibitors, namely p16INK4a, p21CIP1, p53, p15INK4b, p14ARF, and
  p27KIP1, leading to a permanent cell cycle arrest (either in G1 or G2 phase). BCL-2
  and PI3K/AKT anti-apoptotic pathways also become upregulated, bestowing senescent
  cells (SCs) with resistance to apoptotic cues. Other phenotypic alterations include
  an enlarged cell size (up to 2.5 times the normal counterpart) and metabolic changes
  such as mitochondrial and lysosomal expansion, which increase the production of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as the activity of lysosomal senescence-associated
  β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal, detected at pH 6.0). ROS accumulation induces protein
  aggregates which crosslink with sugars and lipids and form insoluble lipofuscin
  aggresomes. Autophagy rate is increased during the early senescence programme but
  is highly compromised in later stages. SCs are characterized by a complex senescence-associated
  secretory phenotype (SASP) that comprises a plethora of different growth factors,
  cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and matrix components. Primary transcriptional
  activators of the SASP include nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), CCAAT/enhancer binding
  protein β (c/EBPβ), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). SASP factors, such
  as IL-6, IL-8, Gro-α, IGFBP-7, and PAI-1, reinforce the senescence programme in
  an autocrine manner, while others, like ROS, IFN-γ, TGF-β, IL-1α, VEGF, CCL2, and
  CCL20, induce paracrine senescence in neighbouring cells. Upon the initiation of
  the senescence programme, the chromatin suffers deep modifications towards the repression
  of proliferation-related genes and the stimulation of SASP-related genes. This results
  in the appearance of DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence
  (DNA-SCARS) as well as senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). Chromatin
  alterations are accompanied by a downregulation of lamin B1, a major component of
  the nuclear lamina, compromising its integrity and leading to the extravasation
  of chromatin fragments into the cytosol. Cytosolic chromatin fragments (CCFs) are
  recognized by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) which, in turn, triggers the activation
  of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The cGAS-STING pathway stimulates pro-inflammatory
  SASP responses through upregulation of NF-κB. Recent studies suggest that urokinase-type
  plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), a cell-surface protein, is also broadly expressed
  during senescence. The biomarkers in bold represent the most common hallmark features
  of cellular senescence. None of these hallmarks is exclusively specific and their
  manifestation can diverge according to the nature of the senescence trigger, the
  cell/tissue type and time of the senescence programme.
