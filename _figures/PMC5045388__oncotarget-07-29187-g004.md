caption: An increase (⇑) or decrease (⇓) in phosphorylation levels at baseline is
  indicated by white arrows. An increase (⇑) or decrease (⇓) in phosphorylation levels
  post-treatment are indicated by colored arrows, according to treatment with AZD6244
  alone (red), BKM120 alone (blue) and their combination (purple). Resistance (red
  box with white R) and sensitivity (green box with white S) to inhibitors of respective
  proteins in drug sensitivity analysis are also indicated. Also indicated is the
  increased expression of EDN1 and TGFB2 that was observed uniquely in HCT116CR cells,
  and its hypothesized activation of pathway signaling.
