caption: Working model of seed-size regulation by UGT71C4.(A) When UGT71C4 is overexpressed,
  it exhibits glucosyltransferase activity that transforms flavonoids into flavonoid
  glycosides, and metabolic flux is directed toward the flavonoid metabolic pathway.(B)
  When UGT71C4 function is lost, metabolic flux is directed away from flavonoid metabolism
  and toward lignin metabolism.(C) When UGT71C4-OE increases the metabolic flux from
  basic phenylpropane metabolism to flavonoid metabolism, the expression of core flavonoid
  synthesis enzymes increases significantly; appropriate flavonoids accumulate in
  ovules to promote cell growth and development; and the expression of genes related
  to cell differentiation and proliferation is advantageously regulated. These changes
  ultimately increase seed length and width and hence the yield. In UGT71C4-KO ovules,
  greater metabolic flux is directed from basal phenylpropane metabolism to lignin
  metabolism, which results in greater synthesis of lignin monomers and intermediates;
  significantly increased expression of related core enzymes; induction of genes related
  to lignin synthesis; and significant accumulation of lignin in the ovules. This
  in turn results in lignification of the cell wall, reduced cell ductility, and hence
  constrained seed development
