caption: A model summarizing the infection-induced protease-dependent cleavage of
  innate immunity sensors/receptors in response to pathogenic infection and tissue
  damage in Drosophila A schematic illustration of the protease-dependent activation
  of Drosophila IMD and TOLL pathways is shown. It is well established that the TOLL
  ligand Spätzle is processed by an infection-activated serine protease cascade and
  that the cleaved Spätzle binds to TOLL and thereby activates the TOLL pathway. The
  receptor PGRP-LC can be activated by binding to bacterial elicitors (monomeric or
  polymeric DAP -PGN).,, To complement the well-established mechanism of innate immune
  activation via microbial pattern recognition (PAMP), we hypothesize that PGRP-LC
  may also be cleaved by infection-induced proteases released during pathogen-host
  antagonism. The structural integrity of the sentinel receptor PGRP-LC may constitute
  a “tissue well-being” signal. The infection-induced protease release may be a “danger/damage”
  signal that may help the host cells to detect pathogen infection and tissue injury.
