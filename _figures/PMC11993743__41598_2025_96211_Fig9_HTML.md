caption: 'A schematic representation of the potential of the SA8-E6-12 antibody cocktail
  to modulate immune responses activated by S100A8. S100A8 interacts with TLR4 and
  activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in upregulation of inflammatory
  cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. The expression of cytokines can induce
  the expression of secondary response genes and activate intrinsic apoptosis signaling
  pathways, leading to upregulation of the caspase-8-caspase-3 axis. In addition,
  S100A8 can lead to activation of extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways, upregulating
  the Bax-caspase 3 axis. On the other hand, treatment with the anti-S100A8 antibody
  cocktail SA8-E6-12 modulates the negative effects of S100A8 by suppressing S100A8-triggered
  inflammatory pathways, and inhibiting apoptosis via inactivating the caspase cascades.
  Notes: the red arrows indicate enhancing actions induced by S100A8, and the green
  lines indicate inhibitory actions of SA8-E6-12. Bax: Bcl-2-associated X protein;

  Cas-9: Caspase-9; IL-6: interleukin-6; IL-8: interleukin-8; IL-1β: interleukin-1β;
