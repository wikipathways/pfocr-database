caption: Regulation of AMPAR trafficking by signaling cascades. AMPAR trafficking
  and channel properties are regulated by phosphorylation of C-terminal domain and
  subsequent alteration of protein–protein interactions. (1) Phosphorylation of GluR1at
  the PKA site S845 facilitates insertion of GluR1 into the neuronal membrane and
  is often associated with induction of long-term potentiation. Dephosphorylation
  of GluR1 by protein phosphatases (e.g. calcineurin and PP1) targets GluR1 to recycling
  endosomes, where re-phosphorylation by PKA can occur, with subsequent reinsertion
  into the neuronal membrane. (2) CREB has been shown to be important for AMPAR synthesis
  at the synapse. (3) In response to stimulation, CaMKII translocates to postsynaptic
  sites from dendrites and phosphorylates GluR1 at Ser831 to enhance AMPAR single
  channel conductance, as well as to aid in its delivery to the synapse (reviewed
  in []). (4) Ras mediates activity-evoked increases in synaptic GluR1 and GluR4 containing
  AMPARs via a pathway that requires p42/44 MAPK activation (reviewed in []). (5)
  It was recently shown that GSK-3β mediates NMDAR-induced GluR1/2 internalization
  (Professor Yu-Tian Wang, pers. commun.). Phosphorylation of Ser880 by PKC on GluR2
  causes a switch from receptor retention at the membrane by binding to ABP/GRIP,
  to receptor internalization by binding to PICK 1 to release the AMPAR from anchoring
  proteins and initiate receptor internalization (reviewed in []).
