caption: Hypothetical model to illustrate activation of the complement system, inflammation
  and coagulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Virus enters the circulation from
  the lung alveolar space. Carbohydrate structures in the viral envelope are detected
  by circulating lectins (e.g. collectin-11 and mannan-binding lectin, MBL). Enzymes
  bound to collectins (known as MBL-associated serine proteases or MASPs) lead to
  the cleavage of complement C3 (directly or via C4 and C2) followed by C5 to generate
  biologically activate fragments (C3a, C3b, C5a and C5b) and membrane attack complex
  (C5b-9). Membrane damage caused by the actions of C5a and C5b-9 and inflammatory
  cell infiltration on the blood vessel wall promotes clot (thrombus) formation by
  the coagulation pathway, while in addition, lectin-MASP complexes can directly activate
  the coagulation cascade. Reports of microscopic tissue examination in cases of COVID-19
  show evidence of small and medium size vessel injury (vasculitis) and thrombus formation
  in the presence of SARS-CoV-2, MBL, MASP, C3b and C5b-9, suggesting a causal relationship
  as depicted. Mo, Monocyte; MΦ, macrophage; PMN, polymorphonuclear neutrophil; RBC,
  Erythrocyte.
