caption: FGFR-dependent cell signaling in the development of drug resistance. Many
  drugs show reduced efficacy over time. Recent studies have linked this phenomenon
  to activation of FGFR and disruption of its downstream signaling including mutations
  of individual signaling proteins, impaired signal transduction and cross-talks between
  different cascades. The mode of action of PI3K/AKT in the development of chemoresistance
  is mainly based on the upregulation of pro-survival genes such as Bcl2-A1 or Bcl-xL
  by activation of IKKβ or inactivation of GSK3β and further nuclear translocation
  of NFκB or Nrf2, respectively. Another mechanism is inhibition of TSC1/2 affecting
  protein synthesis. Activation of ERK kinases in MAPK pathway appears to be crucial
  in the acquisition of drug resistance, as it leads to increased expression of proteins
  associated with cell cycle progression (e.g., cyclin D1) and apoptosis control (e.g.,
  Mcl-1). Another signaling pathway STAT, in particular STAT3, can directly affect
  the tumor microenvironment through increased hyaluronan (HA) synthesis, as well
  as the regulation of apoptosis through Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL. Finally, the PLCγ/PKC pathway
  is often complicit in other signaling cascades and is also able to directly activate
  multidrug resistant proteins such as P-gp.

  description: FGFR-dependent cell signaling in the development of drug resistance.
    Many drugs show reduced efficacy over time. Recent studies have linked this phenomenon
    to activation of FGFR and disruption of its downstream signaling including mutations
    of individual signaling proteins, impaired signal transduction and cross-talks
    between different cascades. The mode of action of PI3K/AKT in the development
    of chemoresistance is mainly based on the upregulation of pro-survival genes such
    as Bcl2-A1 or Bcl-xL by activation of IKKβ or inactivation of GSK3β and further
    nuclear translocation of NFκB or Nrf2, respectively. Another mechanism is inhibition
    of TSC1/2 affecting protein synthesis. Activation of ERK kinases in MAPK pathway
    appears to be crucial in the acquisition of drug resistance, as it leads to increased
    expression of proteins associated with cell cycle progression (e.g., cyclin D1)
    and apoptosis control (e.g., Mcl-1). Another signaling pathway STAT, in particular
    STAT3, can directly affect the tumor microenvironment through increased hyaluronan
    (HA) synthesis, as well as the regulation of apoptosis through Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL.
    Finally, the PLCγ/PKC pathway is often complicit in other signaling cascades and
    is also able to directly activate multidrug resistant proteins such as P-gp.
