caption: Cellular canonical pathways represented by differentially expressed proteins
  between sarcoidosis and controls implementing Overlapping Canoncial Pathway functionality
  in IPA. The 273 differentially expressed proteins map to thirty statistically significant canonical
  pathways. Each canonical pathway is represented as a node. The edges indicated at
  least two common proteins between the nodes to indicate shared biological function.
  Three clusters of overlapping pathways were identified. A larger cluster of overlapping
  canonical pathways includes diverse biological functions including IL-8, ILK, RhoA
  signaling, caveolin and clathrin-mediated endocytic signaling, NRF2-mediated oxidant
  response signaling and glucocorticoid receptor signaling (Panel A). The other two
  of have limited number of nodes and are involved in metabolic functions (Panels
  B, C).
