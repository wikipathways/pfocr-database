caption: Anti-HCV drugs targeting viral life cycle. (1) HCV viral particle interacts
  with several entry factors such as, SR-B1, CD81, CLDN1 and OCLN to enter the hepatocytes.
  Entry inhibitor, ITX-5061 inhibits the uptake of viral particles through SR-B1.
  (2) Once inside the cell, virus releases its genome by the process of uncoating.
  (3) The viral RNA is translated and the resulting polyprotein is processed at the
  endoplasmic reticulum. NS3/4A protease inhibitors inhibit viral protein synthesis
  and impair interferon signaling pathway. (4) Replication takes place in ER-derived
  membrane compartment, called as membranous web composed of single-, double-, multi-membraned
  vesicles and lipid droplets. miR-122 binding to viral genome enhances viral replication
  and translation. Drugs targeting NS5A and NS5B block viral replication. CypA interacts
  with NS5A and required for viral replication. Nucleocapsid is formed after interaction
  of core and NS5A protein with lipid droplets. The p7, NS2 and NS3-NS4A proteins
  are also involved in coordination of virus assembly. (5) HCV virion morphogenesis
  is coupled to the very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL) secretory pathway, and virus
  particles are released as lipoviroparticles (LVPs). Viral proteins and host factors
  that are the targets of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in advanced clinical development
  are indicated in the legend. CLDN1, claudin 1; CypA, cyclophilin A; miR, microRNA;
  OCLN, occludin; SR-B1, scavenger receptor class B member 1; LD, lipid droplets.
