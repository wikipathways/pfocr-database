caption: A schematic of redox regulation of CDO1 under ionizing radiation-induced
  oxidative stress Ionizing radiation promotes the glutathionylation of CDO1, leading
  a reduced enzymatic activity of CDO1, which results in the suppression of the cysteine
  oxidation pathway and an increase in the synthesis of GSH. This molecular event
  supports cell viability by preserving redox homeostasis under ionizing radiation
