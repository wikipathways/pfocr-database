caption: A complete explanation of the various steps, grouped in modules of initiation
  (fluid phase), amplification, termination, and regulation can be found below in
  Methods (Biochemical Model, Section 5.2). Initiation of the alternative pathway
  (blue) is induced through the tick-over reaction of C3, while classical pathway
  (yellow) is activated through the spontaneous intramolecular activation of complement
  complex C1. The tick-over of C3 in the alternative pathway forms the C3 convertase,
  C3(H2O)Bb, that cleaves C3 to generate nascent fluid phase C3b (nfC3b) and C3a,
  whereas activation of C1 cleaves C4 into nascent fluid phase C4b (nfC4b) and C4a.
  Subsequently, nfC3b and nfC4b can bind to host cells, form dimers such as C3bC4b
  (green), C3bC3b, and C4bC4b, or generate fluid phase C3b and C4b (fC3b and fC4b).
  Formation of fC3b and fC4b initiates a cascade of reactions that forms C3 and C5
  convertases (fC3bBb and fC4bC2a). These enzymes (fC3bBb and fC4bC2a) further cleave
  plasma C3 to produce more nfC3b and C3a. Furthermore, fC3bBb and fC4bC2a can also
  cleave C5 to generate C5a and C5b. Continued propagation of complement through C5b
  leads to C5b-7 that can also attach to host cells and initiate a cascade of reactions
  to form MAC (C5b-9n). However, healthy host cells are shielded from complement attack
  due to fluid phase and surface bound complement regulators shown in red. Regulators
  FH, FHL-1, C4BP, C1-INH, CR1, and DAF provide early-phase checkpoints for complement
  activation and propagation, while late-step regulation of the terminal cascade is
  provided by fluid regulators Vn/Cn and surface bound regulator CD59. The nomenclature
  of complement system for selected proteins, fragments, and complexes is listed in
  .
