caption: 'Lactate as substrate generates NADH via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the
  cytosol necessary for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) reaction
  of gluconeognesis (orange). Mitochondrial oxaloacetate (OAA) has four pathways to
  cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), whereas three are energetically preferable
  for gluconeogenesis: The PEPCK-M pathway (red) is the most direct pathway and uses
  mtGTP produced by succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS-GTP) in the TCA cycle. The PEPCK-C/aspartate
  pathway (blue) uses mitochondrial (mtAAT) and cytosolic (cytAAT) transamination
  reactions via aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) and needs shuttling of glutamate
  and α-ketoglutarate to generate OAA in the cytosol. OAA is converted by PEPCK-C
  that hydrolyses cytosolic GTP for the production of cytosolic PEP. The PEPCK-C/malate
  pathway (green) uses mitochondrial (mtMDH) and cytosolic (cytMDH) malate dehydrogenase
  (MDH). Mitochondrial MDH converts OAA in malate and malate is transferred to the
  cytosol, where cytosolic MDH forms OAA. This creates an excess NADH oxidized by
  the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle.'
