caption: Pro‐resolving receptor agonism to modify the phenotype of target cells. Our
  recent work has identified AMPK as the signalling determinant downstream of formyl
  peptide receptor type 2 (FPR2) activation to switch the phenotype of muscle macrophages
  from a pro‐inflammatory to a pro‐resolving reparative one (McArthur et al., ). This
  dataset prompts the hypothesis that definition of the signalling pathways is of
  importance to accelerate the development of pro‐resolving drugs, with the caveat
  that the relevant pathway may be cell and disease specific. Here we depict macrophage
  FPR2 that responds to its agonists leading to macrophage switch. Moreover, the same
  need to switch the phenotype of cells like fibroblasts and chondrocytes should prompt
  identification of the predictive signalling pathway conducive to the wanted outcome,
  for example, not activating fibroblasts to myofibroblasts or anabolic chondrocytes
