caption: 'Activity of PTX3 in innate immunity. PTX3 represents the humoral arm of
  the innate immunity. Inflammatory cytokines, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), microorganisms
  and microbial moieties stimulate secretion of PTX3 by polymorphonuclear (PMN) neutrophils,
  macrophages, and dendritic cells. (1) Release of PTX3 by PMN neutrophils occurs
  quickly and casts an immediate defensive response. In fact, these cells possesscytosolic
  granules containing a stored, ready- to-release, pool of PTX3. (2) Macrophages and
  dendritic cells are other effectors of the innate immunity, which neo-synthesize
  PTX3 upon stimulation. This newly synthesized pool of PTX3cells is responsible for
  a slower response to infective agents, which might persist even several days. Released
  PTX3 regulates inflammatory reactions by acting through several pathways/mechanisms:
  I) PTX3 released by PMN neutrophils localizesat level of neutrophil extracellular
  traps (NETs). NETs represent an extracellular fibrillary network, where some nuclear
  components, such as DNA and histones, are variously assembled with bactericidal
  proteins, such as azurocidin1(AZU1) andmyeloperoxidase(MPO). Within NETs, PTX3 and
  anti-microbial molecules converge and cooperate to enhance binding and killing of
  infective agents. II) PTX3 released in the extracellular space binds to specific
  microbial ligands and activates the complement cascade through interaction with
  C1q particles (classical pathway) or ficolins and mannose-binding lectins (lectin-mediated
  pathway). PTX3-induced complement activation enhances the inflammatory response.
  III) Finally, extracellular PTX3 opsonizes microorganisms binding to specific molecules
  on the cell surface (i.e. zymosan on Aspergillusfumigatus) and, in turn, it is recognized
  by Fcgamma receptors expressed by phagocytic cells, thus promoting microbial clearance.
  The interaction of PTX3with Fcgamma receptors indicates the antibody-like function
  of PTX3 and underlies its functional overlapping between innate and adaptive immunity
  during inflammation. (FcγR Fcgamma receptor, IL-1 interleukin-1, LPS lipopolysaccaride,
  PTX3 pentraxin 3, TNF-alpha tumor necrosis factor-alpha)'
