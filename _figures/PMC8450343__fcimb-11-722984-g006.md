caption: 'STRING protein–protein interaction (PPI) subnetworks. Representation of
  the proteins encoded by differentially expressed genes in IND and HD, which are
  described to be involved in specific pathways. PPI networks were constructed setting
  the confidence score threshold at the highest level (0.9) and active interaction
  sources, including data from published experiments, databases, co-occurrence, gene
  fusion, neighborhood, and co-expression, species limited to “Homo sapiens.” The
  colored nodes correspond to proteins involved in each biological pathway: (A) interleukin-2
  family signaling (HSA-451927) (brown) and interleukin-12 family signaling (HSA-447115)
  (green) from the Reactome Pathways Database and (B) Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation
  (HSA-04658) (blue), Jak-STAT signaling pathway (HSA-04630) (red), Th17 cell differentiation
  (HSA-04659) (yellow), and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (HSA-04650)
  (purple) from the KEGG Pathways Database. The arrows indicate whether the genes
  encoding these proteins were found to be upregulated (red) or downregulated (blue)
  in the IND versus HD group.'
