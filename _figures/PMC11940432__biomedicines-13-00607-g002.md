caption: Intracellular signaling pathways of LGR4. As a classical GPCR, upon ligand
  binding to LGR4, it activates heterotrimeric G-proteins to transduce a cytoplasmic
  signal. After ligand binding, LGR4 activates several corresponding downstream signaling
  pathways, primarily the cAMP/PKA, Gαq/GSK3β, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways.
  LGR4 mediates cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling by activating the heterotrimeric Gαs protein,
  which affects the transcription of target genes, such as Pitx2, Atf4, CD14, and
  Esr1. Meanwhile, LGR4 can interact with other ligands, such as RANKL, and activate
  Gαq, which causes intracellular Ca2+ release and suppresses the GSK3β-mediated activation
  of the nuclear translocation of NFATc1, eventually inhibiting osteoclastogenesis.
  In addition, RSPOs and Norrin have recently been identified as ligands of LGR4 that
  potentiate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. As ligands of LGR4, RSPOs potentiate Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling primarily via two methods. First, upon the binding of RSPOs to LGR4, ZNRF3/RNF43
  is inhibited, and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated. The deubiquitinating
  enzyme USP42 can protect ZNRF3/RNF43 from ubiquitination and degradation and, thus,
  inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Second, in the presence of RSPOs, IQGAP1 is recruited
  by LGR4, and its affinity towards DVL is enhanced. Through IQGAP1–DVL interactions,
  a supercomplex with the Wnt signalosome is formed. IQGAP1 moves MEK1/2 to phosphorylate
  LRP5/6, which interacts with Axin and inhibits β-catenin phosphorylation
