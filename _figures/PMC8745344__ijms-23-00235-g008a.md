caption: 'Schematic drawing highlighting metabolic pathways, calcium cycling, and
  implicated signaling pathways in Sham (A), and their directional change in MOD vs.
  Sham (B), and SHF vs. Sham (C). Green arrows promote pathway or activity. Rectangles
  show signaling pathways or proteins that were inhibited or down-regulated (green),
  respectively, and those that were activated or up-regulated (red), respectively.
  The deeper the color, the higher the intensity of activation/up-regulation or inhibition/down-regulation,
  as shown by the scale bar at the bottom of the figure. Oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS), fatty acid (FA) metabolism, and mitochondrial (mt)-FA β-oxidation were
  the most enriched/inhibited metabolic pathways in MOD vs. Sham, followed by BCAA
  catabolism and enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Glycolysis and pyruvate
  metabolism were the least enriched/inhibited in MOD vs. Sham. The metabolites taurine
  and 2′,3′cAMP were downregulated in MOD vs. Sham. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–mt
  interface protein kinase A (PKA) signaling and calcium cycling as well as PGC-1α
  signaling were attenuated in MOD vs. Sham. Glycogen degradation and protein kinase
  C isoform delta (PKCδ) signaling were activated in MOD vs. Sham. In SHF, there was
  further inhibition or activation of the aforementioned metabolic and signaling pathways,
  except for glycogen degradation, which decreased in SHF vs. MOD. Unique findings
  in SHF included decreased PKA activity throughout the cellular compartment, decreased
  AMPK and mt PKC isoform epsilon (PKCε), and mt calcium/calmodulin kinase 2 delta
  (Camk2δ) signaling. Derangements in calcium cycling and calcium homeostasis were
  also evident in SHF. Mitochondrial pathophysiological processes, other than OXPHOS,
  that are indirectly involved in or regulating OXPHOS (mt calcium uptake and efflux,
  MICOS complex, mt import and carrier proteins, and mt protein deacetylation) were
  attenuated in SHF vs. Sham. Additionally, mt translation/elongation was attenuated
  in SHF. Eicosanoids decreased in abundance in SHF vs. Sham, while 2′,3′cAMP down-trended
  in SHF vs. MOD. Abbreviations: TGFβ: transforming growth factor beta, Glut4: glucose
