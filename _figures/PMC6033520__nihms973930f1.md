caption: A. In the absence of the hedgehog (Hh) ligand, patch (Ptch) constitutively
  inhibits smoothened (Smo). This prevents the dissociation of the transcription factor
  Gli with its inhibitor Sufu, and allows Gli sequential phosphorylation by protein
  kinase A (PKA), casein kinase-1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK). Phosphorylated
  Gli is ubiquitinated through the action of transducin repeat containing protein
  (β-TrCP), which targets Gli to proteasomal degradation. The net result is the repressor
  form of Gli (Gli-R), which inhibits transcription of Gli-target genes.B. In the
  presence of Hh ligand, the Hh-Ptch complex is internalized and degraded. This removes
  the inhibitory effect of Ptch on Smo, and allows Smo entry into the primary cilium
  (PC). To become activated Smo is then phosphorylated through the action of CK1 and
  G-protein-couples receptor kinase-2 (GRK2). This allows the entry of the complex
  Sufu-Gli into the PC. At the tip of the PC, Sufu dissociates from Gli. Gli then
  returns to the cytoplasm where it undergoes partial degradation in the proteasome
  in an activated form. Activated Gli enters the nucleus, where it mediates transcription
  of Gli-target genes.
