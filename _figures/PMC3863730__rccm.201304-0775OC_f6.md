caption: Proposed schematic diagram of monocyte-macrophage activation and cellular
  response to corticosteroids in the presence of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Prevotella
  melaninogenica. H. parainfluenzae short length acyl chains lipid A LPS interacts
  with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and activates transforming growth factor-β–associated
  kinase-1 (TAK1) by MyD88 pathway, resulting in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
  phosphorylation and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, which activate transcription
  of the proinflammatory cytokines like IL-8 (, , , ). On the contrary, P. melaninogenica
  long acyl chains lipid A LPS is a poor agonist for TLR4 (). On interaction cytoplasmic
  glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with dexamethasone receptor translocates to the cell
  nuclei and activates mitogen-activated kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) mRNA production.
  MKP-1 dephosphorylates activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. GR interacts
  with NF-κB and inhibits IL-8 transcription. Monocyte-macrophage activation by H.
  parainfluenzae results in reduced cellular responses to corticosteroids. TAK1 activation
  by H. parainfluenzae inhibits GR-mediated MKP-1 production and suppresses GR inhibition
  of NF-κB–induced IL-8 production. The cells remain corticosteroid sensitive in the
  presence of P. melaninogenica.
