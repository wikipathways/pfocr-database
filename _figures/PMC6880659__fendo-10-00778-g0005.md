caption: Proposed model of TFC pyroptosis in excessive iodine-promoted HT. Excessive
  iodine enters TFCs and induces the production of ROS, which activates NF-κB signaling
  and increases GSDMD-FL. In addition, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by NF-κB
  signaling, leading to GSDMD-FL cleavage into GSDMD-N, which triggers pore formation
  in the membrane and the release of mature IL-1β from cells, causing a sterile inflammatory
  response and further contributing to pyroptotic cell death and the subsequent promotion
  of HT.
