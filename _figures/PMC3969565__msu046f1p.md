caption: 'Pathway mapping into the human DDR network. DDR components are classified
  into four main subnetworks: 1) the GR subnetwork that includes the pathways MMR,
  BER, NER, HR repair, ssbRep, dissolution of joint DNA molecules (Holliday), ICL,
  and NHEJ; 2) response at RF subnetwork which includes proteins involved in the sensing
  and repair of damage at the RF; 3) the CHK subnetwork, and 4) response at DSB subnetwork
  including sensing the damage at DSB when the NHEJ pathway fails and ATM-based repair
  takes over. This subnetwork overlaps with the HR pathway, and the CHK subnetwork,
  which includes proteins involved in blocking DNA rereplication, cell cycle delay,
  cell cycle progression, and related cell cycle arrest as a consequence of response
  to damage. Interactions of these components are manually extracted from the literature
  and depicted in this illustration by numbers in brackets that correspond to the
  PubMed identifiers (supplementary text, Supplementary Material online).'
