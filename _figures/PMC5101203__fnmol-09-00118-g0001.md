caption: Putative pathological production of Aβ and NF-κB signaling in neurons. Schematic
  representation of activators and neuronal gene targets of NF-κB under conditions
  of excessive Aβ, as in Alzheimer's disease. The transcription factor NF-κB is activated
  by several biological agents and thus may serve to integrate various cell signaling
  pathways in neurons. In the canonical pathway, neuronal stimulation (e.g., by TNFα,
  calcium, glutamate) elevates intracellular Ca2+ levels, which activates IκB kinase
  and initiates phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. Evidence suggests that this
  Ca2+-mediated activation of NF-κB is CaMKII-dependent. Once in a dimer state (prototypically
  p65/p50 subunits), NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and binds to the consensus
  sequence of neuronal gene targets, many of which are involved not only in synaptic
  plasticity and memory but also amyloidogenic processing. For example, APP appears
  to serve as both an activator and a gene target of NF-κB in neurons. The production
  of Aβ occurs via sequential cleavage of APP by BACE1, which yields sAPPβ, followed
  by cleavage with γ-secretase, which yields an Aβ peptide. Aβ can aggregate into
  oligomers. Under conditions of supraphysiological/pathological Aβ levels, stimulation
  of NF-κB appears ROS-dependent and may activate genes involved in the production
  of Aβ, including APP and/or BACE-1, further exacerbating amyloid dysregulation in
  AD. Although gene transcription associated with the p65/p50 NF-κB complex (as shown
  here) can induce downstream gene expression, NF-κB-driven transcription can also
  downregulate target genes through activation of p50 homodimers, which can repress
  gene expression. Aβ, amyloid beta; APP, amyloid precursor protein; BACE1, beta-site
  APP cleaving enzyme 1; CaMKII, calcium-calmodulin kinase II; NF-κB, nuclear factor
  kappa b; ROS, reactive oxygen species; sAPPβ, secreted amyloid precursor protein
  beta; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alpha.
