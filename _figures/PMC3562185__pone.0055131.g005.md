caption: The ovaries of female Tribolium express spo and the genes for the terminal
  hydroxylases, including shd, required for synthesis of 20E. Male accessory glands
  also express a spo-like gene, spot, and the genes for the terminal hydroxylases
  required for synthesis of E, but not shd. However, shd expression was detected in
  the carcass without the reproductive system indicating that E synthesized by the
  accessory gland might be converted to 20E in peripheral tissues, like during the
  larval stages. Alternatively, E produced by the accessory gland may be involved
  in male-specific hormone signaling or be transferred to females during mating. Multiple
  arrows indicate several steps in the biosynthetic pathway.
