caption: Possible molecular targets of the preventive effects of PT in Cr(VI)-induced
  ACD. Cr(VI) activated NLRP3 inflammasome activity and the p38 MAPK/MK2 signaling
  pathway leading to pro-inflammatory gene expression and resulting in keratinocyte
  cell death by apoptosis. The administration of PT inhibited cell death, the NLRP3
  inflammasome and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which were regulated by ROS generation
  and ER stress and were related to Cr(VI)-induced ACD.
