caption: ERBB2 signaling depicting actionable targets. Molecular mechanisms underlying
  resistance toward ERBB2 kinase inhibitors are schematically shown. Homo‐ and heterodimers
  involving ERBB2 are shown along with ERBB2 blockers (antibodies and inhibitors in
  green). Other actionable drug targets whose activity can be blocked to overcome
  drug resistance along with the examples of their available inhibitors are also shown.
  The PI3K‐AKT pathway, which is prominent in resistance toward ERBB2 blockers, is
  highlighted in red.
