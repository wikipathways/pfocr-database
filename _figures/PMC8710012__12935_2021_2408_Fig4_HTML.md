caption: New druggable agent effective in targeting YAP. The figure shows the drug
  agents that can be effective in the Hippo signaling pathway. Some of these drugs
  inhibit YAP/TAZ nuclear localization or block the transcription of target genes.
  Some others lead to the degradation of these proteins by increasing LATS activity
  and phosphorylation of the YAP/TAZ complex. LATS large tumor suppressor kinase;
  Yap Yes-associated protein
