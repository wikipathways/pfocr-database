caption: A. In response to hypoxia, RACK1 mediates the translocation of NHE6 from
  the endosomes of breast cancer cells to the plasma membrane. This results in acidification
  of endosomal compartment and sequestration of weakly basic drugs such as doxorubicin.
  B. Upon treatment of cancer cells with chemotherapy and radiation, RACK1 is released
  from the C-terminal tail of NHE9 to facilitate downstream activation of Src/Akt/β-Catenin
  and Bcl-2 pathway, resulting in chemoradiation resistance. C. In glioblastoma, NHE9
  is highly expressed, resulting in alkalinization of the endosomal lumen. As a result,
  oncogenic receptors such as EGFR escape degradation and are recycled back to the
  plasma membrane to drive tumor growth, migration and chemoresistance. D. NHE5 level
  is elevated in rat C5 glioblastoma cell line, where it acidifies the endosomal compartment.
  High levels of NHE5 are proposed to increase EGFR, MET, and integrinβ on the cell
  surface to drive proliferation and migration of cancer cells.
