caption: Model of the regulatory network controlling biofilm formation in E. coli.
  Curli production at low osmolarity results from transcriptional activation of the
  csgD promoter by OmpR and OmpR234, OmpR234 appearing to be a much more efficient
  activator than OmpR. In response to Cpx pathway activation via either RpoS, high
  osmolarity, curlin accumulation, or a combination of these factors, transcription
  of the two csg operons is repressed. The different controls are indicated by arrows
  for positive controls or by a line with a bar for negative controls.
