caption: 'Plant phytochemicals achieve hormesis through multifocal pathway inhibition.
  Our health strongly benefits from interactions of a large number of plant molecules
  in our diet with key regulators of mammalian physiology (adapted from []). Various
  plant-derived molecules are synthesized as secondary metabolites in response to
  stress. During adversity in the context of particular environmental stresses, animals
  have retained the ability to sense these stress signaling molecules synthesized
  by their distant ancestors, through enzymes and receptors which regulate inflammation-energy-metabolism
  pathways to protect and to increase the survival of the organism. Abbreviations
  used: PKC, protein kinase C; PKD, protein kinase D, IKK2, inhibitor of IkB kinase
  2; ROS/RNS, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species; NR, nuclear receptor; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  R6SK ribosomal S6 kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase
