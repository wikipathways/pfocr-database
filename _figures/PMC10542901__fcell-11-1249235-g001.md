caption: The endothelium as initiator and target of type I IFN responses. (A) Viruses
  and Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes (IE), neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)
  and cytokines such as TNF released by monocytes trigger type I IFN in the endothelium.
  STING activation is a main pathway of IFNα/β gene transcription induction in the
  endothelium. Cellular stress produced by infection or TNF causes leaky mitochondrial
  DNA that binds cGAS and generates 2′3′-cGAMP, which activates STING (1). Extracellular
  particles (EPs) derived from IE (2), as well as defects in STING trafficking across
  endoplasmatic reticulum, Golgi and lysosomal compartments (3) also activate the
  STING pathway. STING recruits TBK1 in the Golgi, which phosphorylates IRF3 and induces
  IFNβ transcription (4). TNFR signaling induces IFNβ through IRF1, in cooperation
  with other TNF-activated transcription factors, NF-κB and AP1 (5). (B) Paracrine
  IFNAR1 signaling induction by endothelial secreted IFNα/β activates the phosphorylated
  STAT1/STAT2 dimer with IRF9 complex that migrates to the nucleus and directs ISGs
  expression (1). Type I IFN signaling induces immunoproteasome activation (2) and
  promotes MHC class I antigen presentation (3). Immunoproteasome activation inhibits
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (4), which is associated with downregulation
  of tight junction components (5). On the other hand, type I IFN signaling induces
  CXCL10 secretion (6), leading to leukocyte recruitment to the endothelium, namely,
  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Activation of CD8+T cytotoxic cells through interaction with
  MHC class I peptide complexes on the endothelium layer combined with decrease of
  tight junction proteins contribute to loss of endothelial barrier function (7).

  description: The endothelium as initiator and target of type I IFN responses. (A)
    Viruses and Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes (IE), neutrophil extracellular traps

    endothelium. STING activation is a main pathway of IFNα/β gene transcription induction

    (B) Paracrine IFNAR1 signaling induction by endothelial secreted IFNα/β activates
