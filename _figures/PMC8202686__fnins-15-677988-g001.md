caption: Adenosine receptor expression and main transduction pathways activated in
  oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes (OLs). Schematic representation
  of A1, A2A, A2B and A3 receptor (A1R, A2AR, A2BR and A3R) effects on OPCs and main
  intracellular pathways involved. The activation of A1R by adenosine (ADO) or other
  selective receptor agonists promotes myelination and migration. The stimulation
  of Gs-coupled A2AR and/or A2BR leads to adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation with a
  consequent increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which
  closes IK channels and inhibits OPC differentiation, probably by a mechanism involving
  protein kinase A (PKA). A3R stimulation induces OPC apoptosis by the activation
  of an intrinsic pathway, i.e., through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
  and activation of Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis
  (PUMA) and caspase 3/9. Dotted lines are used when the intracellular pathway/s have
  not been described.
