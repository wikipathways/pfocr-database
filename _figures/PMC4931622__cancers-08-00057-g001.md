caption: 'Schematic representation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in renal
  cell carcinoma (RCC). Wnts binding to its receptors from the Frizzled family stimulates
  the canonical signaling pathway. The downregulation of Wnts and its co-receptor
  LRP5/6 antagonists by gene mutation, deletion and promotor hypermethylation also
  induces the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in RCC. Upon the activation of the pathway,
  GSK3 kinase activity is inhibited, and the destruction complex becomes disrupted.
  This allows β-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and its localization to the
  nucleus, which activates Wnts target genes’ transcription. Upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway increased the expression of the oncogenes in RCC, such as c-Myc
  and Cyclin D1. The VHL/HIF pathway is regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  in RCC. The tumor suppressor gene VHL can be silenced by mutation, deletion and
  promotor hypermethylation. LRP5/6: LDL receptor-related proteins 5 and 6; GSK3:
  glycogen synthase kinase 3; TCF/LEF: T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor; VHL:
  von Hippel-Lindau.'
