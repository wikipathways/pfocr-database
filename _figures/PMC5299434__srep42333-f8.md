  in the literature using proteomic or transcriptomic approaches in response to starvation

  for P. tricornutum; phosphorus (blue) for T. pseudonana, for P. tricornutum; silica
  for T. pseudonana (grey); iron (russet) for T. pseudonana29, for P. tricornutum;
  fluctuating light (yellow-brown) for T. pseudonana; temperature (turquoise) for
  T. pseudonana. Responses for T. pseudonana (above the line) and for P. tricornutum
  (below the line) are denoted as an increase (+), decrease (−), both decrease and
  increase (±), no change (o). If the response is not commented on in the paper or
