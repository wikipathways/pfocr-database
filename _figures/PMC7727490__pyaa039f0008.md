  (CUS) stimulation, the increased FXR levels in CA1 drives the cytoplasmic translocation
  of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein-regulated transcription
  coactivator 2 (CRTC2) by targeting CREB, thereby impairing the CREB-BDNF signaling
  pathway and inducing depression-like behaviors in mice.'
