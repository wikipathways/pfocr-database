caption: Model of the regulatory network in early gynoecium development. This regulatory
  network integrates the results that SPT, an important player of gynoecium development,
  enables cytokinin signaling in the medial domain of the young gynoecium by activating
  the transcription of type-B ARR genes (at least ARR1 and ARR12; likely ARR1 directly
  and ARR12 indirectly), which proteins become active upon phosphorylation because
  of a phosphorelay cascade initiated when cytokinin is present, and then together
  activate auxin biosynthesis (TAA1) and transport important (PIN) for growth. It
  is likely that SPT also affects other components of the cytokinin signaling pathway
  (indicated by gray arrows). Solid black arrows indicate a positive regulation and
  a T-bar indicates a repression function, a broken black arrow indicates possible
  positive regulation by auxin, a double arrowhead indicates phosphorylation, purple
  arrows indicate possible auxin flow; CK, cytokinin; P, phosphate group.
