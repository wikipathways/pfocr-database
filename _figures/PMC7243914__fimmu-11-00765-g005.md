caption: Schematic representation of the immune signaling responses occurring in chickens
  infected with Salmonella. (A) Salmonella infection of chicken macrophages in vitro
  activates TLR4 and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways leading to the activation
  of unique transcriptional activators involved in inducing pro-inflammatory responses
  (). (B) Kinome analysis of cecal tissue from Salmonella-infected chickens revealed
  differential phosphorylation of TGF-β and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways suggesting
  a dampening of pro-inflammatory responses that supports Salmonella evading host
  immune defenses and establishing a persistent local infection (). Figure is adapted
  from He et al. () and Kogut et al. (); additional signaling responses have been
  characterized through biochemical analyses of TLR4, CARD9, and the NLRP3 inflammasome
  in bone marrow-derived macrophages and are described elsewhere (–). Protein identities
  in the figure that are colored (i.e., purple, blue, and pink) were identified as
  differentially phosphorylated (p < 0.05) (, ). Figure is adapted from KEGG Pathway
  Mapper (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/mapper.html), and generated using BioRender.
  “P” designates protein in its phosphorylated state. AP-1, adaptor protein complex
  1; CAMK2A, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit alpha; CARD,
  caspase recruitment domain-containing protein; cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis;
  ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FZD1, Frizzled-1; GSK3β, glycogen synthase
  kinase-3 beta; IκB, NF-κB inhibitor alpha; IKKα, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B
  kinase subunit alpha; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; JNK, c-Jun
