caption: Fatty acid metabolism in S. aureus.Phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) is synthesized
  by the stepwise acylation of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate by PlsY that transfers a fatty
  acid to the 1-position from acyl-phosphate (acyl-PO4) followed by PlsC that acylates
  the 2-position using acyl-ACP. Acyl-ACP is produced by the type II fatty acid biosynthetic
  pathway (FASII), and PlsX catalyzes the inter-conversion of acyl-ACP and acyl-PO4.
  Exogenous fatty acids enter the cell and may be activated by either a fatty acid
  kinase or acyl-ACP synthetase pathway. Our experiments show strain PDJ39 (ΔplsX)
  requires both exogenous fatty acids and de novo fatty acid synthesis for growth
  and has fatty acid kinase activity in cell extracts. These data rule out the presence
  of an acyl-ACP synthetase (Aas, red) and show the presence of a fatty acid kinase
  (Fak, green) pathway for the incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into phospholipids.
  The acyl-PO4 may either be used by PlsY or converted by PlsX to acyl-ACP that can
  either be elongated or utilized by PlsC. The gene(s) encoding Fak are unknown.
