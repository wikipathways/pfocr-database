caption: 'Schematic representation of the main metabolic pathways involved in cancer.
  In tumors, elevated carnitine is associated with increased fatty acid oxidation
  and increased mitochondrial function. In cancer cells, glucose is the major carbon
  source for fatty acid synthesis: glucose is converted to acetyl-CoA and then to
  citrate in the mitochondria. The enzyme ACLY cleaves citrate to produce acetyl-CoA,
  which is used for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. Alterations in
  phospholipid (lysoPL) compositions, triggered by iPLA2 (calcium-independent phospholipase
  A2), are linked to tumor progression. Cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in cancer cell
  membranes act as platforms for receptor clustering and signal transduction, enhancing
  pathways such as PI3K/protein kinase B (Akt). Cholesterol and lipid accumulation
  promotes overexpression of SREBP1, enhancing lipogenesis and metastatic potential.
  Ketone bodies are metabolic by-products of fatty acid oxidation, used by tumor cells
  as an energy source to fuel rapid proliferation. Created with BioRender.com'
