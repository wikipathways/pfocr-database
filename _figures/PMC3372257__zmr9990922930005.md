caption: Schematic summary of nutritional interactions in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate
  symbiosis. 1, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) uptake. DIC is acquired either as
  bicarbonate (HCO3−) from the surrounding seawater or as CO2 from the seawater or
  host metabolism/calcification. In the case of HCO3−, it must be converted to CO2
  prior to photosynthesis by the dinoflagellate symbiont. 2, photosynthesis. CO2 is
  photosynthetically fixed through the Calvin-Benson cycle (i.e., the C3pathway),
  with the dinoflagellate ultimately synthesizing a range of organic compounds, including
  amino acids. 3, translocation. A portion of the photosynthetic products are translocated
  to the host cell. 4, reverse translocation. Organic compounds are likely translocated
  from the host to the symbiont; these compounds could arise from host metabolism
  or be in the same forms as those originally translocated by the symbiont. 5, host
  metabolism. Translocated compounds are used, alongside dissolved organic matter
  (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) taken up from seawater, to support host
  metabolism. The catabolism of nitrogenous compounds ultimately leads to the generation
  of ammonium waste that can be assimilated by the symbiont. 6, ammonium assimilation.
  Excretory and seawater ammonium can be assimilated by both the host cell (pathway
  not shown) and the symbiont, with translocated organic compounds providing carbon
  skeletons necessary for host assimilation. The assimilation of excretory ammonium
  back into amino acids by the dinoflagellate symbiont completes the process of “nitrogen
  recycling” by the symbiosis. 7, nitrate assimilation. Nitrate is taken up from the
  seawater, but only the symbiont can convert it to ammonium for subsequent assimilation
  into amino acids. 8, phosphate assimilation. Phosphate is likewise taken up from
  seawater and can be assimilated by the dinoflagellate symbiont. Note that uptake
  of nutrients can also occur from the ambient seawater via the epidermis (not illustrated),
  but for simplicity these pathways are not shown.
