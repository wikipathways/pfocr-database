caption: 'a Schematic overview of four metabolic modules. Module I is referred to
  as the 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) production module. The central carbon metabolism
  was divided into three distinct modules: the glycolysis module (II), the mitochondrial
  module (III), and the PDH bypass module (IV). To deregulate each module in the central
  carbon metabolism, five engineering strategies were employed: (1) controlling gene
  expression at the transcriptional level by a series of promoters characterized on
  xylose; (2) manipulating global transcription factors (TFs); (3) introducing heterologous
  proteins; (4) expressing mutated proteins; and (5) constructing biosensors. b The
  detailed implementations of the above mentioned five distinct engineering strategies
  in the various metabolism modules. BS binding sites, Enzymes and metabolites shown
  in the pathways: Mpc1/2/3 mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, PfkA and Pfk1/2 phosphofructokinase,
  FbaA and Fba1 fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, GpmA and Gpm1 phosphoglycerate
  mutase, PykA/F and Pyk1 pyruvate kinase, GapN NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
