caption: Scheme of CD95 pathway. The CD95 signaling pathway is of crucial importance
  for the homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Binding of CD95L to the CD95 initiates
  the signaling pathway and leads to assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex
  (DISC). Ligand binding results in a conformational change of the intracellular death
  domain (DD), which leads to the recruitment of FADD via its DD. FADD comprises a
  death effector domain (DED) through which it recruits other DED-containing DISC
  core proteins that form the DED filaments. These DED proteins include procaspase-8
  and the c-FLIP isoforms. While c-FLIPShort acts exclusively antiapoptotic, c-FLIPLong
  can act both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic. At the DISC, procaspase-8 can be activated
  both as a homodimer and as a procaspase-8/c-FLIPLong heterodimer and is cleaved
  to the heterotetrameric caspase-8. In type I cells, caspase-8 activation is sufficient
  to activate the effector caspases procaspase-3 and -7 and thus trigger apoptosis.
  In type II cells, amplification of the signal is necessary. In this case, caspase-8
  cleaves BID to tBID, which in turn leads to permeabilization of the mitochondrial
  membrane and the release of cytochrome c. Cytochrome c, together with cytosolic
  APAF1 and procaspase-9, forms the apoptosome, which serves as a platform for caspase-9
  activation. Caspase-9 activates the effector caspases and triggers apoptosis in
  type II cells. XIAP is an inhibitor of caspase-9 and the effector caspases. Through
  various stress signals, BAX and BAK are also able to permeabilize the mitochondrial
  membrane and trigger apoptosis in a CD95-independent manner. BCL-2 can inhibit BAX/BAK-mediated
  permeabilization. Figure created using BioRender.com, accessed on 26 September 2024
