caption: NFkB is the major cascade cross talked by TNF signaling. TNF mechanistic
  signaling occurs primarily via its TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors ubiquitously expressed
  in brain tissues in AD patients. The extracellular domain of TNF receptors is immediately
  characterized by the presence of cysteine-rich CCG domains that mediate the specific
  ligand receptor interaction. Other transcription factors such as p38 and c-Jun terminal
  kinase (JNK) is also activated through downstream regulation of TRAF2 and RIPK1.
  TRADD uses its death domains to bind to the TNFR1 complex where it is most likely
  to express as a scaffold to recruit TRAF proteins and FADD. MAPK signaling is also
  mediated through downstream stimulation of TNFR1 and TRAF 3. Upon activation of
  a subset of neuronal inflammation superfamily, TRAF 3 is degraded. This event causes
  the activation of MAP3K14, interleukin-1 and Toll-like receptors pathway and subsequent
  activation of IKK alpha unit which upregulates the alternative NFkB signaling.
