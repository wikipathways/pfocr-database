caption: Primary bile acid metabolism and secondary bile acid metabolism pathways
  with microbially encoded enzymes. The primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic
  acid (CDCA), are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver through two metabolic
  pathways known as the classical pathway and the alternative pathway. In the intestine,
  bile acids are transformed by intestinal microorganisms into secondary bile acids,
  specifically DCA and LCA. The combined primary bile acids (taurocholic acid (TCA),
  glycocholic acid (GCA), taurochenodeoxycholate acid (TCDCA), and glycinchenodeoxycholic
  acid (GCDCA)) travel to the large intestine, where they are broken down by bile
  salt hydrolase (BSH) from various intestinal bacterial taxa. Additionally, they
  are further metabolized by different enzymes within intestinal cells, resulting
  in various iso- and oxygenated bile acids. In rodents, CDCA is converted into α-MCA
  and β-MCA. The primary bile acids cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)
  can undergo oxidation by 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to form 7-oxoCA and 7-oxoCDCA,
  respectively. These can then be epimerized to urscholic acid (UCA) and ursodeoxycholic
  acid (UDCA) by 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Additionally, CA and CDCA can be
  converted to deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) via the 7α-dehydroxylation
  pathway by intestinal bacteria. UCA and UDCA can undergo direct 7β-dehydroxylation
  or be epimerized back to CA and CDCA, followed by 7α-dehydroxylation to form DCA
  and LCA. These bile acids can also pass through epimers, known as 'ectopic' bile
  acids. The epimers of DCA and alloDCA are designated as (allo)DCA and (allo)LCA,
  along with their derivatives. (allo)DCA, which has two hydroxyl groups, can be oxidized
  to 3-oxoDCA by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (isoA) and/or to 12-oxoDCA by 12α-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase (epiA). It can also be oxidized by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  (isoB) or 12β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (epiB) to form iso(allo)DCA and epi(allo)DCA,
  respectively. On the other hand, (allo)LCA is monohydroxylated at C3, leading to
  the production of only 3-oxo(allo)LCA and iso(allo)LCA. DCA and LCA reenter the
  liver through enterohepatic circulation, where they combine with glycine and taurine
  to form TDCA or TLCA
