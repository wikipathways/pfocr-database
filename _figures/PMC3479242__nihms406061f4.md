caption: 'Experimental evidence indicates that the expression and activity of PrfA
  must be carefully regulated in order to optimize Listeria monocytogenes fitness
  in diverse environments. Outside of host cells, the expression of prfA is low, as
  is PrfA activity, resulting in low levels of PrfA-dependent virulence gene expression.
  Under these conditions, the bacterium readily grows on preferred carbon sources
  such as glucose and cellobiose, with glycolysis being the predominant metabolic
  pathway. The bacteria exhibit robust flagella-mediated swimming motility, resistance
  to salt and acid stress and PrfA-enhanced biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces.
  Following entry of L. monocytogenes into a mammalian host, PrfA becomes highly activated
  and increases the expression and secretion of multiple gene products that enable
  bacterial survival within host cells. These gene products include those with direct
  roles in pathogenesis, as well as those that contribute to bile resistance and the
  metabolism of alternative carbon sources that are prevalent within the cytosol.BCAA:
  Branched chain amino acid; PTS: Phosphotransferase system.'
