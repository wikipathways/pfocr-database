caption: 'Proposed model for the activation of oligodendrocyte apoptosis by MHV infection.
  (a) Interaction between the viral S protein and MHV receptor (MHVR). (b) Fusion
  between viral envelope and cell membrane. (c) Integration of viral envelope proteins
  (E, M, S, S2) into the cell membrane after fusion. (d) Activation of the Fas signal
  pathway by virus–cell fusion and the post-fusion complexes. This is likely the major
  pathway leading to activation of the caspase-8 and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.
  (e) An alternative pathway of the activation of the Fas signaling. Solid lines with
  arrows indicate the steps (pathways) that are supported by experimental data, whereas
  dashed lines with arrows denote the hypothetic pathways with little or no experimental
  data. The following blocking reagents were used in the experiments to establish
  the individual steps of the pathways: the CC1 (anti-MHVR antibody), αS (anti-S protein
  antibody), Fas/Fc (chimeric soluble receptor), C8IN (caspase-8 inhibitor), C9IN
  (caspase-9 inhibitor) and Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL.'
