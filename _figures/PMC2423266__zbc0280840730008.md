caption: A schematic model of the role of the NF-κB and MEK1/2 pathways in  the induction
  of inflammatory genes by farnesol. Farnesol treatment  reduces the level of IκBα
  and induces translocation of NF-κB  transcription factors to the nucleus. Activation
  of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway  by farnesol results in the activation of MSK1 and
  subsequently the  phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 and increased p65 activity.  Together
  this leads to increased CXCL3, IL-1α, and  COX-2 expression by NF-κB. Inhibition
  of MEK1/2 by U0126 or by  siRNAs results in reduced MSK1 and p65 phosphorylation,
  whereas inhibition of  MSK1 by H89 or siRNAs represses the phosphorylation of p65
  and the induction  of these inflammatory genes. (→, induction; ⊢, inhibition).
