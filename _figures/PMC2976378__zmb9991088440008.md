caption: Schematic of α6β4-SHP2-Fyn signaling. In the inactive state, the α6β4 integrin
  and Fyn are localized in proximity in the membrane through their palmitoylation.
  However, neither Fyn nor SHP2 is active because of intramolecular inhibitory interactions.
  Upon engagement of the α6β4 integrin with its ligand laminin (active state), the
  β4 cytoplasmic domain is phosphorylated, which recruits SHP2 through an interaction
  of its C-SH2 domain with pY1440 and activates SHP2 catalytic activity through the
  interaction of its N-SH2 domain with pY1494. Fyn is recruited to the complex and
  activated upon the binding of its SH2 domain to pY580 in the SHP2 C-terminal domain.
  Although SHP2 phosphatase activity is required for Fyn activation, the specific
  SHP2 substrates involved are unknown. The localized activation of this α6β4/SHP2/FYN
  signaling pathway promotes carcinoma invasion. *, phosphorylation event.
