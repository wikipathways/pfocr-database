caption: The proposed model demonstrates how Se influences the pro-inflammatory response
  in the tumor microenvironment and cancer cells. Se may act as a pro-oxidant, generating
  ROS and stimulating the Akt and NF-κB signaling pathway. Alternatively, it may function
  as an antioxidant by driving the synthesis of selenoproteins like TrxR, which relocates
  to the nucleus to activate NF-κB, thereby promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokine genes and recruiting leukocytes. The proposed mechanism is adapted from
  [151]
