caption: Pathogen recognition systems. The innate immune system senses viral pathogens
  by recognizing distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) using various
  pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Two of the best-characterized virus-sensing
  PRRs include member of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid inducible
  gene-I- (RIG-I-) like receptors (RLRs) families. These PRRs couple the recognition
  of viral PAMPs to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines through various signaling
  cascades. The cytosolic RNA helicase receptors MDA5 and RIG-I initiate the cascade
  by recruiting the Cardif/TBK1 complex after sensing viral RNA. This activates the
  kinase TBK1 to phosphorylate interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IRF7, resulting
  in their nuclear translocation and the transcription of IFNα/β. The cell surface
  receptor TLR4, in partnership with CD14, couples the recognition of respiratory
  syncytial virus fusion protein [] to cytokine induction by signaling through the
  MyD88-dependent as well as the MyD88-independent pathways. The endosomal TLRs, TLR7,
  TLR8, and TLR9 also signal through MyD88 to activate inflammatory cytokines such
  as TNF, IL-6, and IFN-α/β. The other endosomal TLR (TLR3) signals through the MyD88-independent
  pathway via the TIR domain-containing adaptor molecule TRIF. Via TRIF, TLR3 signaling
  can activate NF-kB using TRAF6, and in addition, can induce type I IFN expression
  probably via TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3.
