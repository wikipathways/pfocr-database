caption: 'Mechanisms of oxidative stress injuries in COPD.Notes: Oxidative irritants
  including tobacco smoke directly affect the epithelial cells, macrophages, and edematous
  basal membrane. The ASM markedly increases under excess exposure of ROS. The activated
  macrophage passes oxidative signaling to neutrophils and Th cells, which causes
  imbalance in protease/antiprotease system and overexpressions of MMP-9 as well as
  NE. The increased expression of NE induces the TNF-α by the NF-κB signaling pathway,
  which accelerates apoptosis of epithelial cells.Abbreviations: ASM, airway smooth
  muscle; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; IL, interleukin; MMP, matrix
  metalloproteinase; MUC5AC, mucin 5AC; NE, neutrophil elastase; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.'
