caption: The signaling pathways activated by TMEM16A in SNI. Schematic diagram of
  the mechanism of the TMEM16A-mediated regulation of neuropathic pain in rats after
  SNI. TMEM16A may influence the expression of the substance P receptor NK-1 through
  the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, thereby participating in neuropathic pain. However,
  this effect can be blocked by T16Ainh-A01 or U0126; E-act can activate TMEM16A and
  cause pain. T16Ainh-A01 is a specific blocker of TMEM16A; U0126 is a specific blocker
  of MEK, and E-act is an agonist of TMEM16A
