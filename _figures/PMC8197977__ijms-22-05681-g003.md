caption: “Nicotinamide drain”—mediated NAD+ decrease. Overactivation of NAD+-consuming
  reactions causes extreme elevation of NAM in the cell, exceeding the capacity of
  the salvage pathway to recycle it into NAD+. The surplus of NAM is methylated by
  NNMT into MNAM to facilitate its excretion and prevent inhibition of NAD+-consuming
  reactions, thereby preserving cellular NAD+ flux. Part of generated MNAM is further
  metabolized by AOX1 to 2-PY, which, in addition to being excreted, inhibits PARPs,
  thereby limiting liberation of NAM for recycling into NAD+ and, over time, leading
  to depletion of cellular NAD+ level.
