caption: Furan fatty acids biosynthetic pathway. Shown is the activity of UfaM as
  a SAM-dependent methylase that produces 11Me-12t-18:1 from vaccenic acid (18:1)
  (). In this work, 11Me-12t-18:1 is shown to be converted into 11Me-10t,12t-18:2
  in a reaction that is catalyzed by a newly identified fatty acyl desaturase (UfaD).
  These results also show that 11Me-10t,12t-18:2 is converted into 9M5-FuFA ( and
  ) in an O2-dependent reaction catalyzed by UfaO. Finally, 9D5-FuFA is shown to be
  produced directly from 9M5-FuFA by a (–) newly identified methylase, FufM ().
