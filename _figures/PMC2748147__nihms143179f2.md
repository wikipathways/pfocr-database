caption: Sialic acid synthesis pathway. The biosynthesis of sialic acid (Neu5Ac) occurs
  in the cytosol, where glucose undergoes several modifications to become UDP-GlcNAc.
  The UDP-GlcNAC 2-epimerase activity of GNE/MNK then epimerises UDP-GlcNAc into ManNAc,
  after which its ManNAc kinase activity further converts this to ManNAc-6-P, which
  is then converted in several steps to the downstream product CMP-sialic acid. CMP-sialic
  acid is utilized by the Golgi complex to sialylate glycoconjugates. CMP-sialic acid
  can feedback-inhibit the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase enzymatic activity in its allosteric
  site. For more details, see text.
