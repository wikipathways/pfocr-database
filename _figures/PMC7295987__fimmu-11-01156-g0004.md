caption: Outline of the signaling pathways activated by CpG. CD205 (DEC-205) is the
  main cell surface receptor for CpG and has a fundatmental role inCpG uptake and
  delivery to the endosomal TLR9 (, ). In addition to CD205, TLR9 is the primary receptor
  involved in CpG-signaling pathway induction, along with its co-receptor CD14 ().
  TLR9 engagement in B cells is followed by the recruitment of the Myddosome complex,
  composed of MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-4, and IRAK-1,
  where phosphorylation of IRAK1 and 4 triggers downstream signaling resulting in
  the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways and mitogen-activated protein kinases
  (MAPK) (, ). An alternative TLR-9-dependent pathway that also controls both early
  B cell activation and proliferation is represented by the phosphorylation of CD19
  mediated by MyD88 (through interaction with PYK2/LYN complexes). CD19 can be regarded
  as one of the main regulators of PI3K activity and inducer of PDPK1 and AKT (at
  S473) phosphorylation (). Arrows indicate activating phosphorylation; dashed lines
  indicate outcome of signaling; blue boxes indicate the CpG sensors analyzed; red
  boxes indicate the molecules involved in CpG signaling transduction analyzed.
