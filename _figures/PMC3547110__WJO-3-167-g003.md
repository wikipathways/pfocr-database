caption: 'Amplifying phase. Both Ca2+ oscillation-dependent and -independent nuclear
  factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) amplification are induced. Highly
  conserved domain in receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK)-mediated RANK
  signaling and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signaling lead
  to continuous phospholipase C (PLC)γ2 activation. Regulator of G-protein signaling
  10 (RGS10) determines the Ca2+ oscillation pattern through control of PLCγ2 by competitive
  binding of Ca2+/calmodulin and phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3).
  Sustained Ca2+ oscillation contributes to NFATc1 amplification mediated by transcriptional
  auto-induction. In the Ca2+ oscillation-independent pathway, Cot kinase enhances
  NFATc1 stabilization through direct phosphorylation and contributes to its accumulation.
