caption: (Left panel) Wild-type motor neurons exhibit healthy neurites and well-elaborated
  growth cones devoid of UBQLN2 aggregates. (Center panel) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
  (ALS)-associated mutations in the proline-rich repeat (PRR) of UBQLN2 promote its
  misfolding and assembly into aggregates that trigger UNC5/DCC-dependent axonal retraction.
  UBQLN2ALS aggregates may directly initiate pathologic UNC5/DCC signaling or impact
  other aspects of cellular regulation, including the endolysosomal-autophagosomal
  pathway, leading to proteostasis deregulation and growth cone retraction. (Right
  panel) Suppression of UNC5/DCC signaling with rationally designed antibodies or
  small molecules (not shown) rescues growth cone defects in UBQLN2ALS motor neurons.
