caption: Overview of activated whole-body arginine metabolic pathway in high-active
  mice compared to low-active mice. The direction of arrows depicts significantly
  higher or lower plasma concentration (red striped), whole-body production (green
  striped), or clearance (blue checkered) for ARG, CIT, ORN, GLN, GLU, PHE and NO.
  A lack of arrow within an amino acid or NO signifies no differences between mice.
