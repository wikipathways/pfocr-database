caption: Abnormal Ca2+signaling in SNc DA neurons may cause mitochondrial oxidant
  stress, proteostasis deficits and eventual cell death. Vulnerable neuronal populations
  display spontaneous slow pacemaking activity employing Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels,
  prominent Ca2+ currents and low intrinsic Ca2+ buffering capacities. Ca2+ inside
  the neuron can be transported back across the plasma membrane either via plasma
  membrane Ca2+-ATPase at the cost of ATP consumption, or through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger
  which uses the Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane. Ca2+ is rapidly sequestered
  by interactions with Ca2+ buffering proteins or taken up into a variety of intracellular
  organelles. The ER uses a high-affinity Ca2+-ATPase [the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum
  Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA)] to pump Ca2+ into the ER lumen at the cost of ATP consumption.
  This pump is also present on cis and medial Golgi membranes, whilst secretory vesicles
  employ a secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase (SPCA) which is also be present on the trans
  Golgi complex. Ca2+ uptake into acidic organelles is mediated by a molecularly unidentified
  Ca2+-ATPase. Ca2+ flows back into the cytosol from the ER lumen through IP3 receptors
  (IP3R) or ryanodine receptors (RyR). IP3R are also present on cis and medial Golgi
  membranes, RyR on trans Golgi membranes, and RyR, TRP and TPC channels are present
  on acidic organelles. Mitochondria, often in close apposition to the ER or plasma
  membrane, can take up Ca2+ into the matrix through a mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter.
  Ca2+ transfer between ER and mitochondria involves the IP3R on the ER membrane.
  Ca2+ within mitochondria is necessary for proper ETC function to generate ATP by
  ATP synthase, but mitochondrial Ca2+ overload can cause mitochondrial oxidant stress
  (ROS). Toxins as well as familial mutations in PINK1, parkin and DJ-1 affect mitochondrial
  ATP production and Ca2+ handling, even though the molecular details remain to be
  determined. The effects of familial mutations in LRRK2 and α-synuclein on mitochondrial
  functioning are even less clear, but those mutant proteins may cause additional
  deficits in proteostasis through mechanisms involving Ca2+-regulated events such
  as autophagy. This may also include alterations in the trafficking of Golgi-derived
  vesicles to the plasma membrane, resulting in changes in vesicle secretion and in
  the steady-state levels of surface receptors. Golgi deficits may cause altered trafficking
  of enzymes destined to lysosomes, with concomitant deficits in lysosomal degradative
  capacity, or alterations in retromer-mediated retrieval from endolysosomes back
  to the Golgi. Finally, changes in acidic store Ca2+ levels may affect various endo-lysosomal
  trafficking steps or the degradative capacity of acidic organelles per se. For further
  details see text.
