caption: '(A) Inactive state: Co-localizing in a preformed nano-orgnaized complex,
  the inhibitors BKI1, BIK1 and BIR3 suppresses the activity of BRI1 in the absence
  of BL keeping the activity of H+-ATPases AHA1 and 2 at basic levels. By interaction
  with BAK1, BIR3 blocks the access of the co-receptor to BRI1. (B) Active state:
  Upon BL-binding to the receptor, the inhibitory mechanisms of BKI1, BIK1 and BIR3
  on BRI1 and BAK1 are released causing the formation of the active BRI1/BAK1 complex.
  The complex enhances the AHA activity resulting in cell wall acidification, plasma
  membrane hyperpolarization and eventually onset of cell elongation. These key constituents
  and qualitatively described processes were used for the initial establishment of
  the computational model at cellular.'
