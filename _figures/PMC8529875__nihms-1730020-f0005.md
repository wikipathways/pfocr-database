caption: 'Supposed mechanism of PGC1-α/NRF1-NRF2 pathway anti-oxidative stress cellular
  defense in chronic kidney disease patients in peritoneal dialysis treatment. Oxidative
  stress alters the interaction of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and
  Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), thereby liberating Nrf2 activity
  from repression by Keap1. NRF2 migrates into the nucleus where it activates the
  transcription of Superoxide dismutase 2, mitochondrial (SOD2). At the same time,
  oxidative stress causes the down-regulation of Peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1-α) and Nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1)
  with the consequent down-regulation of PGC-1α downstream target genes (TFAM, COX6C,
  COX7C, UQCRH and MCAD). The reduced TFAM expression causes a decrease in mitochondrial
  transcription and replication. The downregulation of all these factors suggests
  the decrease in mitochondrial OXPHOS activity to reduce ROS accumulation and creating
  an antioxidant feedback. Image taken from Zaza, G., et al., Downregulation of Nuclear-Encoded
  Genes of Oxidative Metabolism in Dialyzed Chronic Kidney Disease Patients. PLOS
