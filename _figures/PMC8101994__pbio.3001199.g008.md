caption: '(i) Activation: Following TCR/CD28 stimulation of memory T cells, MAPK/ERK
  pathway and AKT/mTOR/S6 pathway are activated. (ii) Inflammation: Activated T cells
  migrate to the sites of inflammation where they produce large amount of IFN-γ that
  induce and sustain PD-L1 expression. (iii) Conversion: PD-L1 ligation on effector
  T cells induces a reverse signal that reduces ERK phosphorylation and attenuates
  the AKT/mTOR/S6 pathway leading to the conversion into iTregs by up-regulating FOXP3
  and CTLA-4 expression and secretion of IL-10. (iv) Regulation: iTregs exert their
  regulatory functions on effector cells controlling the inflammation. These transient
  iTreg cells restrain the magnitude of the immune response bringing back the immune
  system to homeostasis. Schematic representations were created with Biorender.com.
