caption: A) Venn diagram indicating the number of neuron and astrocyte pathway modules
  altered by the KD, as well as pathways that overlapped between neurons and astrocytes
  (n = 7, 7, 7, 6). B) The insulin signaling pathway was upregulated in neurons from
  KD mice. For each gene transcript displayed, individual mice fed a KD are represented
  by vertical color bars placed over the gene name to indicate relative expression
  compared to the mean of the chow cohort for the same gene. Blue reflects a decrease
  in relative expression, red represents increased relative expression, and grey indicates
  no change. The color scheme ranges from −1 to +1 indicating a scaled color spectrum.
  C) The insulin signaling pathway was downregulated in astrocytes from KD mice. In
  (B) and (C), differences appear clustered around JNK, PI3K, Akt, Ras, Raf, ERK1/2,
  and PKA. PEPCK deviates from the overall neuron and astrocyte expression shifts,
  as its expression appears suppressed in neurons and increased in astrocytes.
