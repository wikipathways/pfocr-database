caption: While adenocarcinoma is the dominant NSCLC histology sensitive to EGFR TKIs
  (), studies with NSCLC cell lines indicate more frequent autocrine signaling in
  squamous and large cell carcinoma-derived cells through FGF2, FGF9, FGFR1-IIIc and
  FGFR2-IIIc (; ). Importantly, the homology of FGFRs with VEGFRs and PDGFRs results
  in frequent activity of VEGFR-targeted TKIs on FGFRs as well (see ). Thus, TKIs
  in this class target multiple RTKs including VEGFRs, PDGFRs and FGFRs.
