caption: The role of the alternative oxidase (AOX) pathway in mitigating the effects
  of climate change and improving plant growth. Environmental, human, and microbial
  activities lead to increased greenhouse gases (GHGs). These GHGs can elevate ROS
  and RNS directly or directly via inducing various stresses. AOX can reduce excess
  ROS and RNS while maintaining energy and carbon balance to improve plant growth.
  In the inset, a schematic representation of the plant mitochondrial electron transport
  chain (mETC) is shown. The mETC contains the classical components involved in oxidative
  phosphorylation [I, II, III, IV (or cytochrome oxidase, COX), and V], which yields
  ATP. Complexes I, III, III, and IV are also sources of superoxide (O2–) and nitric
  oxide (NO), which can be transformed into other ROS and RNS. The AOX is inserted
  at the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and diverts electrons from the ubiquinone
  (UQ) pool by reducing O2 to H2O without proton (H+) translocation into the intermembrane
  space (IMS). In this way, the AOX can stabilize the reduction level of the UQ pool
  and other mETC components, thus preventing the formation of O2– and NO. At the same
  time, the AOX activity renders respiration independent of adenylate control, thus
  allowing the reoxidation of matrix and extramitochondrial NAD(P)H under high-energy
  charge or COX restriction. Several physiological situations can require the action
  of AOX to maintain or enhance the activities of the TCA cycle and other cellular
  metabolic processes under energy and carbon imbalance. Yellow and red boxes indicate
  induced and reduced molecule levels or processes by the action of AOX, respectively.
