caption: The RAS signaling pathway. NRAS and KRAS are small GTPase switch proteins
  that act downstream receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs and TKs). RAS
  activation status is regulated by a two-stage molecular system directed by phosphorylation
  and dephosphorylation changes in RAS, which are regulated by the opposing activities
  of guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs).
  RTK/TK stimulation promotes the recruitment of adaptor proteins (such as GAB2, GRB2,
  and SHP2) and GEFs to mediate RAS-GDP phosphorylation to a RAS-GTP active status.
  Active RAS then triggers a signaling cascade that sequentially activates RAF, and
  phosphorylates MEK and ERK proteins, which ultimately signal to the nucleus to control
  specific cell functions such as proliferation, survival, and differentiation, among
  others. RAS pathway is inactivated by the activity of GAPs, such as NF1, which promote
  RAS-GTP dephosphorylation to a RAS-GDP inactive form. In addition, the ubiquitin
  ligase CBL can also act as a negative regulator of the RAS pathway by targeting
  active RTKs for proteasomal degradation. Figure was created with BioRender.com.
