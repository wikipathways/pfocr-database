caption: The WNT pathway in a normal, adult, colonic epithelial cell is depicted on
  the left-hand side of the Figure. On the basolateral portion of the cell the WNT
  receptor is activated and transmits the signal intracellularly to the APC, GSK-3β
  and β-catenin complex. GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin, marking it for proteosomal
  degradation. The WNT pathway in carcinogenesis is depicted on the right-hand side
  of the Figure. The WNT receptor may be activated and transmission of the signal
  intracellularly may occur, but inactivation of β-catenin by GSK-3β does not. Cytoplasmic
  accumulation of β-catenin leads to its nuclear translocation and binding with its
  cognate partner TCF/LEF. This heterodimerization regulates genes through transcription,
  notably of MYC.
