caption: Mechanism of DHP-mediated apoptosis in HCT116 cells. In the state of metabolic
  reprogramming, cell metabolism shifts primarily toward anabolism, and DHP promotes
  this process by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Downstream of AKT, it
  regulates ST6Gal-I in the cytoplasm and ROS in the mitochondria. Specifically, AKT
  inhibits ST6Gal-I by downregulating the sialic acid modification of Fas, thereby
  enhancing Fas ligand sensitivity and activating downstream caspase-8. This leads
  to the cleavage of Bid into tBid, which translocates to the mitochondrial membrane
  resulting in a decrease in MMP. Simultaneously, AKT promotes ROS production, and
  high levels of mitochondrial ROS further damage MMP. Together with the aforementioned
  Fas receptor pathway, this results in a significant reduction in MMP promoting the
  leakage of proteins such as cytochrome c (Cyt-c) and apoptotic protease-activating
  factor-1 (APAF-1), activating caspase-3, initiating the caspase cascade, cleaving
  nuclear DNA, and ultimately inducing apoptosis. AKT, protein kinase B; DHP, Dendrobium
  huoshanense polysaccharide; ETC, electron transport chain; FADD, Fas-associated
  death domain protein; Fas–FasL, Fas receptor–Fas ligand; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  SA α-2-6 gal, sialic acid α-2,6-galactose; UDP-GlcNAc, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine
