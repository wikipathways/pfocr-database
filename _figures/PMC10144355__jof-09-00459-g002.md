caption: 'Biosynthesis of Roquefortine C/meleagrin: (a) Roquefortine C biosynthetic
  gene cluster in P. roqueforti. The pseudogene is indicated as a black box; (b) Roquefortine
  C/meleagrin biosynthetic pathway in P. roqueforti and P. chrysogenum. The late reactions
  only present in P. chrysogenum are included within a shaded box, whereas side reactions
  suggested to involve the gmt-encoded methyltransferase and leading to the formation
  of minor methylated derivatives (e.g., roquefortine F) in P. roqueforti, are indicated
  between blue parentheses. Adapted from [].'
