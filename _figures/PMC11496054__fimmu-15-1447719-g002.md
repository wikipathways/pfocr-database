caption: The cGAS-STING signaling in female reproductive system diseases. (By Figdraw)
  (A) Hypoxia of adenomyosis lesions triggers overactivation of mitochondrial autophagy,
  leading to mitochondrial structural and functional dysfunction and the release of
  mtDNA into the cytoplasm, thereby activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and
  producing IFN1 through the STING-TBK-1-IRF3 axis to persistently activate the inflammatory
  response. (B) Cytosolic DNA promotes cGAS-STING signaling to enhance the migration
  and invasion capacity of HESCs by upregulating autophagy, thus promoting the growth
  of ectopic endometrium; and to promote chronic inflammation in the ectopic endometrium
  through high expression in HEECs. (C) HPV E7 proteins bind to STING to block its
  signaling and selectively inhibit STING-triggered NF-κB activation; HPV E2 proteins
  reduce STING and IFN-κ transcription and their downstream target genes. (D) β-estradiol-ERα
  recruited HDAC3 and induced the deacetylation of histone 3 lysine 4 by binding to
  the STING promoter, thereby reducing the expression of STING.POLE mutation leads
  to genomic instability and increased DNA damage, upregulates cytoplasmic DNA, triggers
  cGAS, and initiates downstream signaling. (E) Cancer cells deubiquitinate and inactivate
  STING by upregulating deubiquitinating enzyme USP35. Overexpression of SETDB1-TRIM28
  leads to reduced micronuclei formation, thereby inactivating the cGAS-STING pathway
