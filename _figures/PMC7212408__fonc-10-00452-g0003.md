caption: Notch signaling activity and Hippo pathway in BCSCs. As transcription factors,
  Notch1, phosphorylated Akt, and NFκB induce expression of CIAP2 and inhibit apoptosis
  through Notch signaling activity in BCSCs. On the other hand, Hippo pathway promotes
  cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and chemotherapy resistance
  in BCSCs through translocation of YAP/YAZ into the nucleus and activation of Rac
  signaling. In addition, VEGFR/NRPs promotes stemness phenotypes of BCSCs, indirectly
  through inhibition of Hippo pathway.
