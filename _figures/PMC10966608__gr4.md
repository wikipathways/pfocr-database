caption: The role of ecDNA in drug resistance. (A) Erlotinib targets the EGFR protein
  kinase structural domain and is able to remove the EGFR gene from ecDNA. Once discontinuation
  of erlotinib, the clonal EGFR mutation located on ecDNA reappeared. BRAF inhibitor
  (BRAFi) therapy targeting the MAPK signaling pathway for the treatment of BRAFV600MUT
  on ecDNA tumors results in the rapid development of acquired resistance. (B) Cancer
  cells treated with MTX led to an increased copy number of the DHFR genes, which
  leads to abundant expression of the DHFR gene, overcoming the inhibitory effect
  of MTX on folate metabolism, maintaining DNA anabolic activity and rendering the
  drug resistant
