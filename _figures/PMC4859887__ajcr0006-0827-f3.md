caption: Some RTKs regulate DDR through specific canonical pathways. The chemical-induced
  EGFR activation will activate AKT pathway to upregulate the expression of cyclin
  A, B, E and CDK 1, 2 to promote cell cycle. On the other hand, the radiation-induced
  EGFR activation will activate RAS pathways to increase expression of XRCC1 and ERCC1
  in cancer cells. MET can downregulate the expression of AIF specifically through
  the FAK pathway. Ron promotes PCNA Y211 phosphorylation through c-ABL mediated pathway.
