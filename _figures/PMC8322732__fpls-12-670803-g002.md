caption: 'Regulations of sugar catabolism, fermentation, glycolysis, and major amino
  acid metabolism associated with NAD(P) + regeneration and ATP production in terrestrial
  and wetland plants under O2-deficient conditions. Blue arrows and letters indicate
  the reactions and enzymes in the up-regulated pathways when the mitochondrial electron
  transport and the TCA-cycle flux decrease under O2-deficient conditions. Red letters
  indicate the regeneration of NAD(P)+ from NAD(P)H. In rice plants, the blue pathways
  contribute to their tolerance to long-term O2 deficiency compared with the terrestrial
  plants. Some wetland plants such as rice also have a high ability to optimally regulate
  the pyruvate level by activation of pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent phosphofructokinase
  (PFK-PPi) and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) that consume PPi instead of ATP
  for energy conservation. Besides glycolysis, PPi is consumed to regulate the cytosolic
  pH by the tonoplast H+-pumping pyrophosphatase (H+-PPiase) instead of H+-ATPase
  in wetland plants. Although two independent pathways for sucrose degradation contribute
  to the regulation of glycolytic flux in both terrestrial and wetland plants, the
  UDP-dependent sucrose synthase (SuSy) pathway is regarded as energetically more
  advantageous for survival under O2-deficient conditions than the invertase (INV)
  pathway because here, PPi is utilized instead of ATP. Sugar supply to glycolysis
  through starch mobilization is observed in species with developed storage organs
  such as tuber, rhizome, and endosperm. In NAD(P)H regeneration during the metabolisms
  of 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate associated with γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production,
  the glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) pathway without ATP consumption is more efficient
  in energy consumption than the NAD(P)H-dependent glutamine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase
  (GOGAT) pathway with ATP consumption. The accumulation of some amino acids such
  as GABA, alanine, and glutamate play an important role in avoiding carbohydrate
  loss not only during O2-deficient conditions but also during the recovery phase
  of re-oxygenation after hypoxia/anoxia. Alanine accumulation by alanine aminotransferase
  (AlaAT) can operate non-circular TCA-cycle and gluconeogenesis under O2 deficiency
  and re-oxygenation. ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; AlaAT, alanine aminotransferase;
