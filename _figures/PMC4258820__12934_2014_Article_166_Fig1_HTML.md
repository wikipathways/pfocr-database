caption: Representative ARG biosynthesis routes in prokaryotes. (A) The linear pathway,
  (B) the recycling pathway and (C) the newly discovered pathway for the ARG biosynthesis
  are shown. Dashed line indicates feedback inhibition by ARG on the first (NAGS)
  (A) and second (NAKG) (B) committed steps in the pathways. Blue arrows indicate
  argE used in the linear pathway (A). Orange arrows indicate argJ used in the recycling
  pathway (B). Green arrow indicates argF’ used in the newly found pathway (C). ARG
  catabolic pathways are also shown. Ac-GLU, N-acetylglutamate; Ac-GLU-P, N-acetylglutamyl-5-phosphate;
  Ac-GLU-SA, N-acetylglutmate-5-semialdehyde; ARG-Suc, L-argininosuccinate; GLU-SA,
  L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde; P5C, 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. The asterisk indicates
  putative NAGS that has not been characterized in many organisms.
