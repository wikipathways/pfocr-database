caption: 'Immune-inflammatory activities in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune response
  against SARS-CoV-2 under normal defense (A) and dysfunctional pathogenic (B) mechanisms.
  In normal defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2, CD4+ helper T cells contribute
  to the overall adaptive response by recruiting Th1 cells and endorsing B lymphocyte
  differentiation to produce specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CD4+ and CD8+ T
  cells also produce IFN to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. APC endorses T cell-mediated immune
  responses in the cytokine microenvironment. Dysfunctional immune response coupled
  with lymphopenia yields severe COVID-19 outcomes by endorsing a hyperinflammatory
  state referred to as a “cytokine storm.” In a cytokine-enriched environment, SARS-CoV-2
  induces pyroptosis of lymphocytes via activating NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase
  1, which results in the decline in memory Th and regulatory T cell population. APC
  activates Th17 cells that endorse neutrophilic inflammation and suppress adaptive
  immunity by activating neutrophils. This pathogenic pathway is further potentiated
  via pathogenic Th1 cells’ activation by CD4+ T cells. Arrows indicate the downstream
  cellular events, and red lines indicate inhibition. “↑” indicates upregulation/activation,
  and “↓” indicates downregulation/suppression. AE cells: alveolar epithelial cells;
