caption: Within myddosome, the C-terminal TIR domain of MyD88 interacts with TIR domains
  of TLRs and TIRAP/MAL (required for TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 signaling), whereas
  the N-terminal death domain (DD) recruits by homotypic interactions IRAK4, which
  in turn activates IRAK1 and IRAK2. These serine/threonine kinases promote both auto-phosphorylation
  and trans-phosphorylation of IRAK members with subsequent recruitment and activation
  of TRAF6, which plays as an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. Together with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzymes Ubc13/Uev1A, TRAF6 promotes polyubiquitination and activation of TAK1 complex,
  consisting of TAK1, TAB1, TAB2, and TAB3. This leads to phosphorylation of IKK complex,
  composed of IKK-α, IKK-β, IKK-γ (NEMO) subunits, and consequently of IκBα, a NF-κB
  inhibitory protein. Phosphorylated IκBα is degraded by the proteasome, freeing NF-κB
  to translocate into the nucleus and activate the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokine genes. Simultaneously, TAK1 triggers the MAPK cascades, leading to the
  formation and activation of AP-1 transcription factor complex. IRAK complex and
  TRAF6 interact also with IRF5, resulting in phosphorylation and nuclear translocation
  of IRF5, which binds ISRE motifs into the promoter regions of IFN-inducible cytokine
  genes. TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 signaling induces also type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β)
  production in a MyD88-dependent manner through nuclear translocation of IRF7 (in
  pDCs), a key transcription factor for IFN-α induction, and IRF1 (in cDCs), culminating
  into IFN-β expression. In macrophages and cDCs, downstream of dimerized TLR3 and
  TLR4, the MyD88-independent/TRIF-dependent pathway leads to the expression of IFN
  and ISGs through recruitment of TRAM, TRIF, and TRAF3. On endosomes, the bridging
  factor TRAM interacts with the dimerized TLR4 and TRIF to drive TBK1 activation
  through TRAF3 (TRAF3–TBK1–IKKε axis), resulting in IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization.
  TRIF interacts also with TRAF6 and RIPK1 to activate NF-κB and MAPKs through TAK1
  complex, and consequently AP-1. Subsequent nuclear translocation of activated transcription
  factors IRF3, NF-κB, and AP-1 leads to expression of type I IFNs, ISGs, and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Activation of constitutively expressed IRF3 together with type I IFNs
  promotes activation of IRF7, through the JAK-STAT pathway, enhancing expression
  of type I and III IFNs. Created with BioRender.com.
