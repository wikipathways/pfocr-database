caption: (a) Working hypothesis of haem d1 biosynthesis as well as incorporation of
  haem d1 into an apocytochrome to produce cytochrome cd1, based on the bioinformatics
  analysis result. The CysGA domain of the CysGA–HemD fusion protein is proposed to
  methylate uroporphyrinogen III at C2 and C7 in two consecutive steps to produce
  precorrin-2. NirJ is proposed to catalyse the decarboxylation of the acetate sidechains
  on rings III and IV. CysGB, which is a bifunctional dehydrogenase and ferrochelatase,
  is proposed to catalyse the oxidation of the single bond between C15 and C16 to
  produce a double bond and the insertion of a ferrous iron in porphyrindione d1 to
  complete the haem d1synthesis. The transport of synthesized haem d1 and its insertion
  into an apocytochrome are thought to be mediated by CcsA and Ccs1. (b) Structure
  of haem d1 labelled with enzymes proposed to be involved in converting some of the
  circled moieties. The acrylate formation in ring IV may be catalysed by CysGB, whereas
  the conversion of the propionate groups to oxo groups in rings I and II may be catalysed
  by NirJ, both of which are predicted with a lesser degree of confidence at this
  stage (labelled with ?).
