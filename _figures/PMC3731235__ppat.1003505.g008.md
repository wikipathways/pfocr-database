  are highlighted in red. A. Pathway Maps for Steroid Hormone Biosynthesis (ko00140).
  Chokepoint enzyme 1.3.99.5 is involved in a chokepoint reaction in this pathway.
  5α-Androstane-3,17-dione (C00674) and 5α-Dihydro-testosterone (C03917) are chokepoint
  compounds. Azelic acid (drug-like compound 7, DB00548) targets 3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid
  4-dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.5) as well as other targets. Exposing C. elegans to azelic
  acid led to a movement-impaired phenotype. B. Pathway Maps for Tryptophan Metabolism
  (ko00380). Enzyme 4.1.1.28 is involved in a chokepoint reaction in this pathway.
  5-Hydroxykynurenamine (C05638), Serotonin (C00780), and Trypamine (C00398) are chokepoint
  compounds. Carbidopa (drug-like compound 2, DB00190) targets DOPA decarboxylase
  (EC 4.1.1.28). Exposing C. elegans to carbidopa produced a movement-impaired phenotype.
