caption: 'Bioactive components-modified smart implants for vascularization and osteogenesis.
  (a) Schemata of construction of the Mg-enriched 3D culture system for bone regeneration.
  Mg2+ influx via magnesium transporter subtype 1 (MagT1) mediates the osteogenic
  differentiation of stem cells. (b) ALP staining of BMSCs treated with or without
  PD98059. (c) Semiquantitative analysis of ALP activity in BMSCs. Mg2+ promotes osteogenic
  differentiation through selective activation of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway (depressing
  specific inhibitor PD98059). (d) Evaluation of neovascularization in nude mice in
  vivo. Blood perfusion in each group was detected by laser Doppler imaging (LDI)
  at different time points. Implantation sites are circled. A Mg-enriched environment
  stimulated neovascularization from days 3–14 [277]. Copyright 2019, Wiley-VCH Verlag.
  (e) Schematic diagram depicting the detailed mechanisms involved in the improvement
  of osteogenesis and angiogenesis by miR-1260a derived from BMSC-Fe3O4-SMF-Exos.
