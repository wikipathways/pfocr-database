caption: Mechanism of anti‐TNF‐α‐induced liver injury. Inhibition of the TNF‐α pathway
  disrupts the balance between an inflammatory and anti‐inflammatory response through
  receptors on T cells. Depending on host characteristics, this imbalance may either
  lead to liver injury or liver regeneration.
