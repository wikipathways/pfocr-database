caption: Model for PhANG Regulation by a Network of Plastid and Light Signaling Pathways.The
  current model for the GUN1-dependent plastid-to-nucleus signaling pathway was adapted
  from . In this model, a second messenger (indicated with Y) that requires GUN1 for
  either its production or transduction (dotted arrows) triggers a plastid-to-nucleus
  signaling pathway that represses PhANGs. A plastid signal(s) that is independent
  of GUN1 (indicated with X) represses both Lhcb and Rbcs in the dark (data not shown)
  and also converts cry1 and one or more photoreceptors that perceive red light into
  negative regulators of Lhcb and Rbcs. cry1 becomes a negative regulator of Lhcb
  when X converts HY5 from a positive to a negative regulator of Lhcb. Under these
  same conditions, Rbcs is induced by cry1 and simultaneously repressed by a combination
  of blue and red light.
