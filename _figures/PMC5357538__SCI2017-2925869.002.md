caption: Wnt, Hedgehog, and Notch canonical signaling pathways. (a) In the canonical
  Wnt signaling pathway, when Wnt ligand binds to FZD and LRP receptors, the β-catenin
  destruction complex (Axin, GSK3, APC, and CK1) is decomposed, and active β-catenin
  accumulates and translocates to the nucleus for target gene transcription. (b) In
  the canonical Hedgehog pathway, when ligand binds to PTCH, the inhibitory effect
  of PTCH to SMO is removed. Subsequently GLI is activated and translocates into nucleus
  for target gene transcription. (c) In the canonical Notch pathway, delta-like or
  Jagged ligand binds to Notch receptor and a series of extracellular and intracellular
  cleavages occur, and NICD translocates to the nucleus to regulate target gene transcription.
  For the detailed pathway information, please refer to the text.
