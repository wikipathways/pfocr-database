caption: Proposed mechanism for self-DNA access to the cytoplasm. Mitochondrial stress-induced
  membrane permeability with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage and chromosomal instability/senescence
  lead to micronucleus formation from incomplete segregation of chromatin and micronucleus
  rupture induces cytosolic nuclear DNA (nDNA). Multiples pathways lead to self-DNA
  internalization within endosomal structures and we believe that endosomal pathway
  perturbation leads to cytosolic delivery of DNA and cGAS/STING pathway activation.
  Apoptotic bodies engulfment may enable self-DNA delivery in the cytoplasm. The antimicrobial
  peptide LL37 and IL-26 bind to genomic DNA and induce its translocation within endosomes
  and/or in the cytoplasm. CXCL4- and CXCL10-DNA complexes as well as cell surface
  receptors FcγRIIa or receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) bind to
  IgG- or HMGB1-bound DNA, respectively, and may lead to cGAS activation upon cytosolic
  DNA release. DNA-containing exosomes constitute another source of cGAS activation.
  Finally, cGAMP enters the cell from neighboring ones through gap junctions to directly
  activate STING.
