caption: 'The mechanism of cell entry and life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in host cell; SARS-CoV-2
  life cycle initiation is mediated by S protein binding to the ACE2. Conformation
  change in S protein following binding to ACE2 promotes its fusion with cell membrane
  via endosomal pathway. Viral genomic RNA is released and translated into viral polymerase
  proteins that synthesize the negative (−) sense genomic RNA, and thereby produce
  a series of subgenomic mRNAs to translation and residing of essential, structural
  viral proteins including nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E)
  into ER and further transport to the Golgi apparatus. Finally, viral RNA–N complex
  and S, M, and E proteins are assembled into virion and released out of the host
  cell. ACE2: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC: ER–Golgi
  intermediate compartment.'
