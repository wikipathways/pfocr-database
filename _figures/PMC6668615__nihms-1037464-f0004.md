caption: Metabolic pathway summarizing the coverage of the C. reinhardtii metabolome
  (metabolites of interest) from the combined application of NMR and GC-MS. Metabolites
  that were only identified by NMR are colored blue. Metabolites that were only identified
  by GC-MS are colored red. Metabolites identified by both methods are colored black,
  and metabolites not identified are colored grey. The embedded Venn diagram identifies
  the total number of metabolites of interest within these metabolic pathways that
  were identified by either NMR, by GC-MS or by both techniques.
