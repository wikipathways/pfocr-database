caption: 'Potential mechanism of action of oxygen-ozone therapy.Note: Oxidative stress
  is involved in NF-κB pathways activation. NF-κB signaling induces the release of
  proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, COX-2), implicated in the inhibition
  of extracellular matrix components synthesis and in matrix metalloproteinase activation
  causing cartilage damage, disturbance of the metabolic balance of the cartilage
  matrix, until apoptosis. Oxygen-ozone mixture attenuates inflammatory responses
  by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB pathway, resulting in cell proliferation and
  survival. ATP: Adenosine triphosphate; COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2; IκB: inhibitor of
  nuclear factor-κB; IL: interleukin; NF-κB: nuclear factor-κB; TNF-α: tumor necrosis
  factor-α.'
