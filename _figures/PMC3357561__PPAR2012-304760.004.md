caption: Tetrameric M2 pyruvate kinase-driven fuel-generating (green panel) and dimeric
  M2 pyruvate kinase-driven biosynthetic precursor-generating (red panels) glycolysis
  (yellow panel) in cancer cells. Tumoral M2 pyruvate kinase exists in a dimeric inactive
  form that blocks pyruvate and ATP formation from glucose. It induces the accumulation
  of energy-rich phosphometabolites found upstream in the glycolytic pathway and off
  which biosynthetic processes may branch. Interconversion to the active tetrameric
  form of the enzyme may occur when the glucose supply is high, leading to a rise
  in fructose 1,6 bisphosphate which stimulates this tetrameric conversion. When glucose
  levels are high, cancer cells may then produce energy at the same time as supplying
  biosynthetic pathways. In this situation, the rise in glycolytic intermediary rich
  energy phosphometabolites results not from a block located downstream of their production
  but from an increased load of glycolysis by glucose. When glucose levels fall again,
  the subsequent decrease in fructose 1,6 bisphosphate results in recruitment of the
  dimeric inactive form of M2 pyruvate kinase. In this case, both energy and pyruvate
  production (and hence formation of lactate) by the tumor may derive from the catabolism
  of aminoacids such as glutamine and serine. The latter sets of metabolic reactions,
  by analogy with glycolysis for glucose to lactate production, are referred to as
  glutaminolysis and serinolysis, respectively. The supply of these aminoacids to
  the tumor is associated at distance with notably muscle proteolysis, explaining
  the progression of patients towards a cachectic state when the tumor gains in growth
  and development. Cachexy may be also favored by energy wasting associated to uncoupling
  of mitochondria in some cancer cell lines. Except with tumors such as insulinoma
  and hepatoma, for instance, no hypoglycaemia is, however, induced in patients since
  a sustained production of lactate is ensured by the tumor from these aminioacids.
  Lactate may be recycled to glucose by gluconeoformator cells, mainly hepatocytes
  (Cori's cycle). Biosynthetic pathways branching off glycolysis include sialic acid,
  nucleic acid, aminoacid, ether glycerolipid, and ester glycerolipid anabolic pathways.
  The latter pathway is not emphasized here by inclusion in a red panel because in
  many cancer cell lines glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase is deficient thus reducing
  the availability of glycerol 3-phosphate and limiting incorporation of neoformed
  fatty acids into lipids. Fatty acid synthase is often overexpressed, and, along
  with the removal of fatty acids (known for immunosuppressive properties) outside
  the cell, it allows tumoral cells to cope with the massive rise in glycolysis-driven
  NADH and proton (H+) formation (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase step),
  avoiding excess acidification and consequent cell death. The threshold for reversible
  interconversion of tetrameric to dimeric M2 pyruvate kinase may be lowered by oncogenes
  in favor of the dimeric form. As mentioned in the text, the tetrameric active form
  is part of the glycolytic complex (a complex which groups most glycolytic enzymes
  for optimal metabolic function and energy production) whereas the dimeric form separates
  from this glycolytic complex.
