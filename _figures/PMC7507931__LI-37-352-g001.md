caption: RAAS and COVID-19 cascade. The SARS-Cov-2 virus enters the lung through ACE
  2, replicates, and further downregulates the ACE 2 enzyme (dotted line). The physiological
  function of ACE 2 is to degrade angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7. Downregulation
  of the ACE 2 enzyme by virus leads to an increase in Angiotensin II, which causes
  systemic injury. The upregulation of RAAS pathway is a hypothesis in SARS-Cov-2
  injury. ACEi block ACE enzyme and ARBs block ATR1 thereby potentially blocking this
  upregulated pathway. RAAS (renin angiotensin aldosterone system) SARS-Cov-2 (Severe
  acute respiratory syndrome- Coronavirus 2), ACE2 (soluble angiotensin-converting
  enzyme2), ACEi (Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), ARBs (angiotensin receptors
  blockers), ATR1 (angiotensin II receptors)
