caption: SETD7 regulates chondrocyte differentiation and glycolysis via the Hippo
  and HIF-1α. In normal conditions, SETD7 activates the Hippo signaling pathway, which
  phosphorylates YAP and retains it in the cytoplasm. In hypoxic conditions, expression
  of SETD7 is inhibited, resulting in increased YAP and HIF-1α in the cytoplasm. The
  accumulated YAP and HIF-1α translocate into the nucleus and combine to form a complex,
  which further promotes expression of glycolysis-associated genes and chondrogenic
  differentiation. SETD7, SET domain containing 7; YAP, Yes-associated protein; HIF-1α,
  hypoxia inducible factor-1α; GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase
  A; PGK1, phosphoglycerate kinase 1; PKM2, pyruvate kinase isoenzyme 2; LATS1, large
  tumor suppressor 1; SOX9, SRY-related box gene 9; Me, methylation; P, phosphorylation.
