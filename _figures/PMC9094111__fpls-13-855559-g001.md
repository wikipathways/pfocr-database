caption: Cold stress signaling in a plant cell. The plasma membrane is considered
  as one of the primary target for cold sensing and eventual transmission of Ca2+
  signals into the plant cell nuclei. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs), glutamate
  receptor-like channels (GLRs), and the MID1-complementing activity (MCA) channels
  are the main plasma membrane Ca2+ channels that allow the entry of Ca2+ ions into
  the cytoplasm. Once the Ca2+ ion enters the plant cell, they are sensed by Calmodulins
  (CaMs) and Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs), Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs),
  and Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). Upon cold exposure, plasma membrane
  associated cold sensor chilling-tolerance divergence 1 (COLD1) interacts with G
  protein a subunit (RGA). Ca2+/CaM regulated receptor-like kinase (CRLK) positively
  regulate cold triggered gene expression by inducing the MEKK1–MKK2–MPK4 pathway.
  CRLK suppress cold-induced activation of MPK3/6 and is necessary for inducer of
  CBF expression (ICE) accumulation. ICE proteins are stabilized by either phosphorylation
  (P) or sumolyation (S). Calmodulin binding transcription activators (CAMTAs) activate
  C-repeat binding factor (CBF) expression through the CM2 (CCGCGT) promoter motif.
  CBF proteins eventually activate the expression of various cold-responsive (COR)
  genes which confers cold tolerance in plants.
