caption: The serglycin signaling network. In this manuscript we identify serglycin
  to be a TGF-β responsive gene that is induced during epithelial mesenchymal transition
  (EMT), and we propose that ZEB1 might be a potential transcription factor that can
  induce serglycin expression. From previous publication, serglycin has been shown
  to be able to act in an autocrine manner through the TGF-β pathway and via the YAP
  transcriptional co-activator. Several lines of evidence show that immune and stromal
  cells are major contributors of serglycin in the tumor microenvironment, and we
  hypothesize that expression of serglycin in the tumor microenvironment can stimulate
  breast cancer cells to undergo EMT.
