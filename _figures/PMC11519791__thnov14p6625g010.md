caption: An illustration of the proposed role of cholinergic and calcium signaling
  pathways in ISIAF and WK treatment in neuronal and non-neuronal (cardiac) systems.
  The genes upregulated by ISIAF (CHAT, SLC5A7, AChE, CACNB1, ATP2A3, and CHRM3) were
  shown by the red arrow. Genes downregulated by WK (CHAT, SLC5A7, AChE, CACNB1, ATP2A3,
  and CHRM3) were marked in blue stripes
