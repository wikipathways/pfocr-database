caption: 'In glomerular podocytes, mitochnodrial dysfunction elicited by oxidative
  stress is an early event associated with aldosterone-induced podocytopathy likely
  via the non-classic mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Both the p38MAPK signaling
  and the redox sensitive glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β pathways are centrally
  implicated in aldosterone-induced podocyte injury. On one hand, activation of p38MAPK
  could induce podocyte apoptotic death via triggering the caspase death pathway.
  On the other hand, aldosterone-induced overactivity of the redox sensitive GSK3β
  could potentially cause hyperphosphorylation and overactivation of putative GSK3β
  substrates, including structural components of the mitochondrial permeability transition
  (MPT) pore. This accounts for the sensitized MPT, mitochondria dysfunction and potentiated
  podocyte death, resulting in podocytopenia. In addition, GSK3β overactivity is also
  a culprit for the disruption of both actin and microtubule cytoskeleton integrity
  and lead to podocyte shrinkage and foot process effacement, eventually culminating
  in proteinuria and progressive glomerular sclerosis.Other abbreviations: MAPK, Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; NADPH, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ROS, reactive
  oxygen species.'
