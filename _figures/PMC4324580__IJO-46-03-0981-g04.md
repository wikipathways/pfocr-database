caption: The proposed mechanism of action of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA)-induced G1-phase
  arrest in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. The G1/S cell cycle checkpoint
  controls the passage of eukaryotic cells from the first phase (G1) into the DNA
  synthesis phase (S). Two cell cycle kinases, CDK4/6-cyclin-D and CDK2-cyclin-E,
  and the transcription complex that includes retinoblastoma (Rb) and E2F are pivotal
  in controlling this checkpoint. During G1 phase, the Rb-HDAC repressor complex binds
  to the E2F-DP-1 transcription factors, inhibiting downstream transcription. Phosphorylation
  of Rb by CDK4/6 and CDK2 dissociates the Rb-repressor complex, permitting transcription
  of S-phase genes encoding for proteins that amplify the G1- to S-phase switch, and
  are required for DNA replication. Many different stimuli exert checkpoint control
  including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, TGFβ, DNA damage, contact inhibition,
  replicative senescence and growth factor withdrawal. ER stress is induced by members
  of the INK4 (p16, p18) and Kip/Cip (p21, p27) families of cell cycle kinase inhibitors.
  The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER triggers the unfolded protein response
  (UPR), which is a stress signaling pathway. The UPR coordinates the induction of
  ER chaperones, decreases protein synthesis, and causes growth arrest in G1 phase
  of the cell cycle.
