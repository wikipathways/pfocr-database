caption: Link between PROM1, GLIS2, and stem cell renewal. (A) The interaction of
  PROM1 with the ciliary protein ARL13B promotes primary cilium formation and elongation
  leading to increased activation of the hedgehog (Hh)-GLI signaling pathway and stem
  cell renewal []. (B) GLIS2 interacts with PROM1 and localizes to the primary cilium.
  Loss of PROM1 promotes nuclear localization of GLIS2 where it represses the transcription
  of target genes, including GLI1 and STAT3, thereby inhibiting CLESC renewal and
  promoting their differentiation into CLE transient amplifying cells (TA) [].
