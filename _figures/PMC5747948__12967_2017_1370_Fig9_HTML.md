caption: The top three merged networks based on the 643 probe sets that were common
  between BCBM and prBT but significantly differentially expressed between BCBM and
  BC include molecules that are related to cancer, cell death and survival, organismal
  injury and abnormalities, hereditary disorder, neurological disease, carbohydrate
  and drug metabolism, and molecular transport. Molecules that are upregulated in
  BCBM compared to BC include, APLP1, C20orf24, CCNK, CLN8, COX4I1, COX5B, CRTC3,
  CSNK2A2, CWC15, EBAG9, FUNDC2, GCFC2, GTF2A2, HAUS1, HAUS2, LSM3, MLXIPL, MRPL40,
  MRPS21, MYL12B, NDRG1, NDUFAF3, NDUFS4, MRPS24, PCDHB14, PEBP1, PHLPP2, RNU4-2,
  RNU5B-1, RPL7A (SNORD36B), RPL13A (SNORD32A), RPL18A (SNORA68), RPL23A (SNORD42A),
  RPL27A (SNORA45A), RPL31, RPL36, SOD3, TAF1D, TAF9B, TIMM8B, TMEM223, TPGS2, TUBG1,
  UBE2R2, UBL5, UFC1. Downregulated molecules include ADAMTS1, AFAP1L2, AFG3L2, ALDH18A1,
  ARMCX3, AQP3, ATP6V1H, C15orf48, CAPG, CDK5RAP3, CPA3, EWSR1, FKBP3, FST, GOLT1B,
  GTF2H2C (paralogue GTF2H2C_2 in data set), HIST1H1D, HNRNPM, ITGA4, LBR, LY75 (LY75-CD302
  readthrough in data set), MINOS1, MME, MRPL1, NDUFA4, NDUFA5, PDIA6, PLRG1, PNN,
  PRSS23, RPL5 (SNORD21), RPL22, SLC19A2, SLC25A6, SLC4A7, SNRPD3, TADA1, and UGCG.
  Integrative molecules comprise 60S ribosomal subunit, ADCY, Akt, Ck2, cytochrome-c
  oxidase, ERK, estrogen receptor, FSH, IL1, Importin beta, Lh, Mapk, mitochondrial
  complex 1, NADH dehydrogenase, Rar, Holo RNA polymerase II, RNA polymerase II, secretase
  gamma, snRNP, and Vegf. Asterisks mark molecules with more than one probe set. The
  pathway was overlaid with the Molecule Activity Predictor to precalculate further
  molecular effects, as outlined in the prediction legend
