caption: The modulation effect of TEVs on CD8+ T cell. TEVs regulate CD8+ T cells
  through their cargo and surface molecules. The surface molecules include Fas‐L,
  PD‐L1, and NKG2DL, which interact directly with the respective ligands or receptors
  to inhibit activation or trigger apoptosis of CD8+ T cells. TEVs can also modulate
  CD8+ T cell function indirectly by affecting CD39/CD73, thereby converting ATP to
  adenosine to suppress the antitumor cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells. TβRII located
  on TEV surface can induce CD8+ T cell exhaustion by activating the TGF‐b signaling
  pathway. Numerous TEV cargoes also play critical roles in immune regulation
