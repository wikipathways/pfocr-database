caption: 'Chemical structure of Gb3. Orange carbon chain: fatty acid. Purple carbon
  chain: sphingosine. Blue monosaccharide residue: glucose. Green monosaccharide residues:
  galactose. Black curved arrows represent a specific enzyme in the Gb3 synthesis
  pathway. The name of the enzyme and the link produced by the enzyme are shown above
  and below, respectively, in black. Red arrowheads represent a specific enzyme in
  the Gb3 degradation pathway. The name of the enzyme is shown below in red. Red blunt
  arrow represents the enzyme which is inhibited by different drugs (above in red)
  and indicates the changes in the fatty acid and sphingosine that can lead to the
  diversity of Gb3 isoforms and analogs, respectively. #: Enzyme induced by INFα.
  *: Enzyme induced by TNFα. GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; β4Gal-T5, β-1,4 galactosyltransferase
  5; AC, acid ceramidase; α-Gal, α-galactosidase A; GALC, GalCer-β-galactosidase;
  GlcCer’ase, GlcCer-β-glucosidase.'
