caption: 'Molecular mechanisms by which estrogens mediate chemoresistance. DNA alterations
  induce responses to DNA damage (DDR), activating different DNA repair mechanisms:
  NER, nucleotide excision repair; BER, base excision repair. DNA double-stranded
  breaks activate ATM and PK DNA effector kinases. ATM is repressed by ER through
  miR-18a and miR106a, and PK DNA phosphorylates ERα in the 118Ser residue, improving
  its transcriptional activation and preventing its degradation via proteasome. BRCA-1
  represses ERα activity and ER regulates BRCA1 transcriptionally. Single-stranded
  DNA breaks activate the ATR kinase, which is blocked by non-genomic mREα signaling
  that activates the PI3K/AKT pathway through c-Src kinase and EGFR. On the other
  hand, CHK1 and CLASPIN are repressed, inducing the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.'
