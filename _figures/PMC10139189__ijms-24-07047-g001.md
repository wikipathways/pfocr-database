caption: The migration and invasion of GBM cells is related to the inherent capacity
  and the cellular interactions that occur on the migratory front. (a) The invasiveness
  of GSCs is greater when it they are enriched in CD144, CD44, and KLRC3 markers.
  Along with the above, the activation of the signaling pathways SOX2, Wnt5a, LIF,
  TGF-β, and Hh has been related to the invasive phenotype. (b) GBM cells infiltrate
  vascular areas and interact with ECs. These cells secrete factors such as VEGF,
  Ang-1, BK, IL-8, and SDF-1, which promote cell invasion by expressing adhesion proteins
  such as N-cadherin and integrin on GSCs and non-GSCs. (c) Glial cells secrete IL-6,
  GNDF, CTGF, and ANGPT2, which promote the invasion of GBM cells (not GSC). On the
  other hand, connexin 43, whose expression is elevated in astrocytes associated with
  gliomas, is an important gap junction protein that allows direct communication between
  astrocytes and GBM cells. Activation of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 in tumor-associated microglia/macrophages
  (TAMs) increases the adhesion/migration capacity of GBM cells through the expression
  of MMP-2, -9, and -14.Finally, the secretion of Wnt3 by non-GSCs towards microglial
  cells, induce the transition to profile like M2; this activation increases the invasion
  of GBM cells.
