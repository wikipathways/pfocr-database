caption: (A) Structures of 18F D- and L-arabinofuranose analogs studied and (B) metabolism
  of D- and L-arabinofuranose highlighting the metabolic fates of the 1–5 positions
  of these molecules. Arabinose isomerases (E.C. 5.3.1.3 and 5.3.1.4 for D and L forms
  respectively) convert D-(and L-) arabinoses into D-(and L-) ribuloses, which are
  subsequently phosphorylated at 5-position hydroxyl group catalyzed by ribulose kinase
  (E.C. 2.7.1.47 and 2.7.1.16 for D and L forms respectively). Next, ribulose-5-phosphate
  epimerase (E.C. 5.1.3.1 and 5.1.3.4 for D and L forms respectively) yields 2-D-xylulose-5-phosphate,
  which finally enters the pentose phosphate pathway. Of note both 2- and 5-18F substitution
  yields 18F structures that are poor substrates for arabinose isomerase and ribulose
  kinase respectively; radiotracer incorporation for these analogs is likely mediated
  by transport and arabinose binding.
