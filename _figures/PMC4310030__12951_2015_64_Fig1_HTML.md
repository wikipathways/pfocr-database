caption: Effect of four different chemicals on inflammation-associated insulin signaling
  pathway in HepG2 cells. The QDot HCS assay was developed for various key kinases
  involved in inflammation-associated IR that are indicated with a red arrow and validated
  by specific inhibitors and anti-inflammatory drugs as shown. The p38α, JNK1, and
  IKKβ involved in the inflammatory pathway and IRS1ser307, IRS1tyr, FOXO1, and GSK3β
  associated with the insulin signaling pathway were simultaneously monitored by QDot
  multicolor cellular imaging.
