caption: Schematic model for the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways. In the canonical
  NF-κB pathway, stimulation of pro-inflammatory receptors activates the IKK complex
  (comprised of IKKα, IKKβ and IKKγ) leading to the phos-phorylation of IKBCX and
  its proteasomal degradation. This induces the translocation of p65/p50 dimers into
  the nucleus where the dimer binds to the promoter regions of a subset of target
  genes. In the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, stimulation of BAFF-R, CD40, and lymphotoxina-β
  receptor (LTβR) leads to the stabilization of NIK and results in the activation
  of the IKKα homo-dimers. Active IKKα, in turn, induces the phosphorylation of the
  NF-κB family member NF-κB2/p100 leading to its processing by the proteasome to generate
  p52. This allows the translocation of the p52/Rel B dimer into nucleus where it
  regulates the transcription of target genes. For details, see text.
