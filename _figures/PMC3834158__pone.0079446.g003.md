caption: Rats were fed a lactalbumin control diet with no added cholesterol (CNC);
  a lactalbumin control diet with 2% added cholesterol (CC); a diet containing 50%
  protein from cooked sea cucumber meal (CS50); one containing 50% protein from oven-cooked
  sea cucumber (OS50); or one containing 50% protein from lyophilized washed sea cucumber
  meal (LWS50) for 16 days. Livers were collected to analyze mRNA expression. Gene
  expression was determined by RT-PCR analysis. Data were normalized to actin mRNA
  and fold-change are shown as the mean (n=5) ± SEM. Different letters within individual
  bar graphs indicate statistical difference (p<0.05). Schematically, increased cellular
  cholesterol levels leads to decreased cholesterol biosynthesis through the 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  CoA reductase (HMGCR) pathway and increased cholesterol efflux through the ATP-binding
  cassette transporter A1 and G1(ABCA1, ABCG1). In hepatocytes cholesterol elimination
  through the bile is mediated by Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Excess
  of free cholesterol can be converted to their oxidized-derivatives the oxysterols,
  which are the natural ligands of the nuclear receptor Liver X receptor (LXR). LXR
  regulate the expression of ABCA1, ABCG1 and other enzymes involved in lipogenesis.
  High density lipoproteins (HDL) can be directly and selectively taken up by the
  liver via SCARB1. In hepatocytes, excess of lipids can be secreted via apolipoprotein-B
  (APOB)-containing lipoproteins (very low density lipoprotein [VLDL]). Triglycerides
  are synthesized from citrate through different enzymes including Acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACC1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) through the de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway.
  The carnitine acyltransferase (CROT) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT 1A)
  provide crucial steps in the transport of long fatty acids from the peroxisomes
  and to the mitochondria, respectively, regulating fatty acid oxidation. The peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and their cofactors (PPARGC1A and PPARGC1B)
  can regulate different aspects of lipid and glucose metabolism. The sterol regulatory
  element binding proteins (SREBPs) can regulate cholesterol homeostasis (SREBP2)
  and fatty acid biosynthesis (SREBP1c).The carbohydrate-responsive element-binding
  protein (ChREBP) can regulate glycolysis and de novo fatty acid synthesis in the
  liver.
