caption: KIT-mediated signaling events. Dimerization of the plasma membrane (PM)-anchored
  KIT by SCF leads to the receptor auto-transphosphorylation. This is followed by
  recruitment of SFKs LYN and FYN, SHP2, PI3K, GRB2, SHC and other SH2 domain-containing
  proteins to phosphorylated KIT. Activated PI3K generates PI(3,4,5)P3 through which
  PH domain-containing proteins such as BTK are recruited to the PM and further propagate
  the signal. An increased activity of PLCγ leads to production of DAG and IP3, responsible
  for enhanced levels of free cytoplasmic Ca2+. This is followed by actin rearrangements
  and chemotactic response. KIT also phosphorylates NTAL that can bind other adaptor
  proteins, including GRB2. Activated GRB2 orchestrates activation of RAS-RAF pathway
  by recruiting GEFs, SOS and VAV, which subsequently leads to activation of MAP kinases
  ERK, JNK and p38. Some other signaling proteins (JAK, STATs, AKT, PKC, and RAC),
  which are involved in gene transcription, survival, actin rearrangement, and/or
  chemotaxis, are also indicated.
