caption: Pathway maps for the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (a), starch
  and sucrose metabolism (b), amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism (c), and
  galactose metabolism (d), adapted from the respective pathways in the KEGG database.
  Pathways maps are limited to reactions involving putatively annotated compound names
  associated with significantly increasing (green ⦁) or decreasing (red ⦁) m/z peaks
  in response to the short-day conditions. The positive or negative fold change of
  the most stable detected m/z ion form is displayed for each putative compound name.
  Compounds that were not detected, but which are known to be involved in these reaction
  pathways, are also included (⚬). Solid black lines represent interactions between
  pathway components. Dashed lines are included when a particular metabolite is also
  included in another KEGG pathway.
