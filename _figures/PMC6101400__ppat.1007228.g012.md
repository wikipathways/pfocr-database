caption: 'After transcription, mRNAs are deadenylated, decapped and degraded by XRN4-mediated
  5’–3’ decay or exosome-mediated 3’–5’ degradation. Deadenylated, decapped, or XRN4-partially
  degraded RNAs facilitate RDR6 to transform ssRNA into dsRNA to degrade the left
  RNAs by PTGS pathway. Potyviruses encode at least two VSRs: HC-Pro and VPg. HC-Pro
  interacts with XRN4 to inhibit its slicing activity and VPg disrupts the interaction
  between NbDCP1 and NbDCP2 by targeting NbDCP2 to the nucleus. As a result, RNA decay-mediated
  plant defense is compromised. In addition, VPg interacts with SGS3 and mediates
  its degradation via ubiquitination and autophagy pathways to block RDR6-mediated
  anti-viral response [].'
