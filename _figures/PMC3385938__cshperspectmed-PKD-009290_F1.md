caption: Schematic representation of the plasma proteins that regulate ionic gradients
  following neurotransmitter release or during the time course of an action potential
  spike. Synaptic input and spiking dissipate ionic gradients maintained by pumps
  and exchangers creating a metabolic burden. Illustrated in the model are the classic
  influx and efflux of ions favored by their electrochemical gradients. Particularly,
  the electrochemical gradient for Ca2+ (∼ +128 mV under physiological conditions)
  favors a strong influx of Ca2+ ions through NMDA receptors (NR) following glutamate
  release or activation of Cav channels during pacemaking spiking activity. The tight
  regulation of intracellular Ca2+ is routed into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via
  sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pumps. However, Ca2+ influx into
  the ER can trigger the process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), displayed here
  as Ca2+ released through the IP3R/RyR pathway. Another venue of regulation of Ca2+
  depends on whether the cell expresses Ca2+-binding proteins (CBP), which help buffer
  intracellular Ca2+. Whether CBP is present or not, Ca2+ can also be extruded out
  of the cell via plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) or Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) proteins.
  SERCA, PMCA, NCX, and the Na/K ATPase all require ATP as the energy source to maintain
  these gradients, and this ATP consumption can have a strong impact on the bioenergetics
  of the cell to maintain normal levels of intracellular Ca2+.
