caption: 'Roles of autophagy in trophoblastic differentiation, placental vascular
  remodeling and angiogenesis. A) Trophectoderm of blastocysts will further develop
  into placentae. In this process, trophoblasts go through differentiation into VTs
  and EVTs, which response for villus formation and vascular remodeling/angiogenesis,
  respectively. Additionally, decidual macrophages and NK cells can also facilitate
  placental vascular remodeling. B) The detailed mechanisms how autophagy regulates
  trophoblastic differentiation, placental vascular remodeling and angiogenesis are
  focused both in stress and pathological conditions (PE and RSM). In PE pathogenesis,
  TFEB is inhibited and thus upregulates Beclin-1 and Atg9b as well as promotes the
  exosomes containing L-SMPD1 releasing from STBs. By which way, vascular remodeling
  is impaired. Shh pathway, downstream of Akt, is suppressed in RSM. Moreover, it
  presents with activated autophagy and reduced VEGFA. Importantly, the CXCL12-VEGFA-CXCR4
  axis is involved in angiogenesis, during which VEGFA relates to autophagy via the
  regulation by HIF-1α. Abbreviations: CTBs: cytotrophoblasts; CXCL12: C-X-C motif
