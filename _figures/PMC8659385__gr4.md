caption: 'The EGFR signaling pathway and its dependencies. Afatinib inhibits EGFR
  but activates the PI3K/Akt pathway. EGFR pathway activation triggers three different
  pathways: PI3K/Akt, RAS/RAF/ERK, and STAT. On AFA treatment of RHE KCs, the PI3K/Akt
  pathway is alternatively increased. Consequently, genes downstream of the PI3K/Akt
  pathway involved in proliferation, survival, and senescence were impacted, resulting
  in skin barrier function impairment. Akt, protein kinase B; ERK, extracellular signal–associated
  kinase; KC, keratinocyte; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RHE, reconstructed
  human epidermis; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.'
