caption: Networks linking genetic disorders to KEGG pathways colored by four separate
  MeSH terms. Nodes represent KEGG pathways, connected through underlying links between
  common CUIs. Networks are colored by MeSH term, specifically Nervous System Diseases
  (a), Cardiovascular Diseases (b), Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases (c), and Immune
  System Diseases (d)
