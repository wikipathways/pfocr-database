caption: The role of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)/SREBP-cleavage-activating
  protein (SCAP) in the regulation of cholesterol synthesis. When the levels of intracellular
  cholesterol are low, SREBP-2/SCAP complex is transported from endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) to the Golgi apparatus and processed to release the NH2-terminal fragment of
  SREBP-2 (nSREBP-2). nSREBP-2 is translocated into the nucleus to induce expression
  of genes related with mevalonate pathway, that increasing cholesterol synthesis.
  When the levels of intracellular cholesterol are high, SCAP forms a complex with
  insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) and SREBP-2, and remains inactive in the ER. Oxysterols
  bind INSIG, that also leads to form the SREBP-2/SCAP/INSIG complex and thereby prevents
  SREBP-2 processing. Several polyphenols, e.g., epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and
  luteolin, and soy protein derived peptides, could inhibit SREBP2 expression, reducing
  cholesterol synthesis. A soy-derived flavonoid, genistein, inhibits the processing
  and the nuclear translocation of SREBP2.
