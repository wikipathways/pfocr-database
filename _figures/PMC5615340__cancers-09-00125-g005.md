caption: Crosslinks between integrin and wnt signalling. A schematic overview upon
  important steps of wnt signalling (green) and PI3K/AKT signalling (red) with Gsk3-β
  (yellow) as centrepiece connecting both pathways. The blue section highlights the
  involvement of E-cadherin delocalisation through integrin activation in β-catenin
  accumulation in the nucleus. Canonical wnt signalling begins with the connection
  between LPR 5/6 and Fzd leading to the recruitment of Dvl and deactivation of axin,
  which is no longer able to form the destruction complex, leading to Gsk3-β destabilisation.
  Active wnt signalling ultimately leads to the transcription of wnt-targeted genes
  that are known to transcribe into pro-migratory, pro-survival, and pro-metastatic
  factors. After integrin activation, a signalling cascade involving a multitude of
  proteins is activated, two of which are PI3K and AKT, whose main phosphorylation
  target is Gsk3-β, therefore, connecting the two pathways. Moreover, E-cadherin delocalisation,
  through integrin activation, has been shown to release β-catenin into the cytoplasm,
  where it can act as an effector on the wnt-pathway.
