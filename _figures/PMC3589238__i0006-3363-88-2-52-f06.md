caption: The networks wherein various signaling pathways epigenetically affected by
  MXC exposure intersect and the relationships between affected molecules. Molecules
  are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented
  as an edge (line). All the edges are supported by at least one reference from the
  literature or from canonical information stored in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge
  Base. Human, mouse, and rat orthologs of a gene are stored as separate objects in
  the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base but are represented as a single node in the
  network. Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional
  class of the gene product. CP = canonical signaling pathway.
