caption: Simplified illustration of the signalling pathway depicting priming and activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome. PAMPs and DAMPs bind to their respective PRRs (IL-1Rs,
  TLRs, TNFRs, NLRs) to activate NF-κB, which upregulates the genes NLRP3, GSDMD,
  pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL18 within the cytosol. Concurrently, BRCC3 deubiquitinates
  NLRP3 and IRAK1/4 phosphorylates NLRP3 to also upregulate the priming of NLRP3 to
  aid inflammasome formation. Activation of NLRP3 is initiated by ion channel dysregulation,
  ROS accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lysosome disruption. Together,
  these generate key signals, including reduced K+ and increased Ca2+, Na+, ATP, ox-mtDNA,
  and cathepsin B to activate NLRP3 inflammasome formation. Activated inflammasomes
  will cleave pro-IL-1β, pro-IL18, and GSDMD to active IL-1β, IL-18, and the N-terminal
  of GSDMD to initiate pyroptosis
