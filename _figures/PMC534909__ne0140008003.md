caption: Cell survival signaling pathways. Three major pathways that inhibit Bad are
  shown. Bad is an important proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that links cell
  survival and apoptosis pathways. Bad promotes the release of cytochrome c by inhibiting
  the antiapoptotic effects of Bcl-XL. The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway
  is activated by survival/growth factors and leads to activation of Akt. Akt inhibits
  the Forkhead family of transcription factors (FKHR), caspase-9, and Bad, and ultimately
  leads to inhibition of both mitochondrial and Fas receptor pathways of apoptosis.
  ERK1/2 activation through active Ras and PKA also inhibit Bad and thereby block
  cytochrome c release by Bcl-XL inhibition.
