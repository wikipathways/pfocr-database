caption: Metabolites shown in blue decreased following PMA stimulation and metabolites
  shown in red increased; gradient red/blue shading represents an increase following
  5 min and then a decrease by 15 min with PMA activation, and vice versa. Metabolites
  shown in white were not detected but are key components of the pathway.
