caption: Pathway analysis () and structural comparisons with the C. straminisolvens-containing
  SF356 enrichment were used to generate predictions regarding saccharification and
  downstream metabolism in the F1RT consortium. Phylotypes FC3 and FC4 were predicted
  to be (facultative) aerobes and are thus likely to consume oxygen by utilizing substrates
  contained in PCS media. Crucially this provides, and subsequently maintains, the
  anoxic environment (shaded grey) that is required for FC1-2 and FC6 to degrade cellulose
  and various hemicellulose substrates, through the use of different glycoside hydrolases
  (GH) arranged in cellulosomes and/or free-enzyme systems. Metabolic reconstruction
  suggests that all anaerobic phylotypes are capable of fermenting the various sugars
  produced via cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis. The major fermentation end-products
  were predicted to be acetate, ethanol and succinate (bold text) as well as formate
  and lactate. FC3 and FC4 are able to utilize ethanol and acetate (glyoxylate cycle)
  as well as succinate (succinate to cytochrome bo oxidase electron transfer). Selected
  GH families are indicated for FC1-2 and FC6; for complete GH catalogs refer to .
  For a detailed pathway analysis of FC1-7 refer to .
