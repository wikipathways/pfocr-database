caption: UV light induces Zfra phosphorylation (pZfra) at Ser8 and translocation to
  the nuclei (Route 1). Zfra rapidly undergoes de-phosphorylation and degradation
  in the nuclei []. However, in response to stimuli for the mitochondrial pathway
  of apoptosis, Zfra becomes Ser8-phosphorylated and relocates, along with p53 and
  WOX1, to the mitochondria. Ectopic Zfra significantly downregulates Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
  (Route 2), blocks cytochrome c release by interacting with voltage-dependent anion
  channel (VDAC) (Route 3), and yet induces dissipation of mitochondrial membrane
  potential []. Alternatively, Zfra probably interacts with cytochrome c to block
  its release from the mitochondria. Zfra binds and blocks the apoptotic function
  of WOX1 (Route 4). Overexpressed WOX1 induces cytochrome c release (Route 5) [].
  By the same token, Zfra blocks apoptotic function of p53 in the mitochondria.
