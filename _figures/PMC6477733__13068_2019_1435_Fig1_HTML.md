caption: Schematic of the process flow for transcriptome and physiological response
  analyses of yeast cells engineered for enhanced lipid production. Heavily engineered
  yeast cells with high lipid content but lower cell growth and viability were first
  analysed by RNA-seq to identify the key DEG and pathway regulation, which were correlated
  with the physiological parameters of CMI, ROS, and Δψm, characterized by flow cytometry
  to determine future metabolic engineering targets. Oxidative stress mitigation was
  attempted by addition of antioxidants or cell-membrane modification. DEG, differentially
  expressed genes; CMI, cell-membrane integrity; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Δψm,
  mitochondrial membrane potential
papertitle: Flow-cytometry-based physiological characterisation and transcriptome
  analyses reveal a mechanism for reduced cell viability in yeast engineered for increased
  lipid content.
