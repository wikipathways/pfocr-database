caption: Schematic view of the integration of the Trm9 and Elongator-dependent mcm5
  modification with cellular signaling pathways. (A) Elongator is a positive regulator
  of TORC2 in fission yeast by promoting the translation of Rictor and Tor1 components
  of the complex. In turn, TORC2 downregulates the activity of Gsk3, which is a negative
  regulator of Elongator through the phosphorylation of Elp4 on S114. This creates
  the positive feedback loop required to activate TORC2 and cell differentiation in
  nitrogen starvation conditions. (B) Phosphorylations of human TRM9L by various signalling
  cascades constitute a critical regulator of oxidative stress survival. Oxidative
  stress induces the rapid and dose-dependent phosphorylation of TRM9L on serine 380
  downstream of the oxidative stress-activated MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase)-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)-RSK (ribosomal protein S6 kinase)
  signaling cascade. In addition, serine 255 phosphorylation is similarly responding
  to oxidative stress through an unknown pathway.
