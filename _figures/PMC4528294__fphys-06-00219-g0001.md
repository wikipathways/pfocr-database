caption: 'Schematic illustrating the four types of regulation exhibited by accessory
  proteins on heterotrimeric G-protein subunits. The four main types of regulation
  mediated by accessory proteins are: (1) GTPase-activating proteins; (2) Guanine
  exchange factors; (3) Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors; and (4) Gβγ-interacting
  proteins. Ligand activation promotes a conformational change in the heterotrimeric
  G-protein associated with the GPCR, which facilitates the switch from GDP to GTP-bound
  Gα subunits. Subsequently, this leads to the activation of downstream effector systems
  by Gα-GTP and unbound Gβγ. The Gα subunit has intrinsic GTPase activity to inactivate
  the signaling output and ultimately, reassociate with its native Gβγ partner. Alternatively,
  an accessory protein (Acc) functioning as a GAP can interact with Gα-GTP to accelerate
  the deactivation of the signaling pathway (A). Other accessory proteins can bind
  to the inactive form of Gα-GDP to either facilitate the activity of Gα by increasing
  the switch from GDP-to-GTP bound Gα subunits (known as GEFs; B) or bind one or more
  Gαi/o-GDP subunits to activate other non-canonical signaling pathways (known as
  GDI; C). The last major type of regulation by accessory proteins is a direct interaction
  with Gβγ in the presence or absence of the associated Gα subunit (D). As an example,
  an accessory protein (Acc), such as GRK2/3, can bind with Gβγ to distribute the
  complex to the plasma membrane and phosphorylate an active GPCR to downregulate
  its activity, or the physical interaction with Gβγ could disrupt the activated Gβγ-dependent
  signaling by the unbound dimer. It remains unclear whether accessory proteins complexed
  with Gβγ promote their own unique signal processing. GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor;
  αβγ, heterotrimeric G-protein α, β, and γ subunits; GDP, guanine dinucleotide phosphate;
  GTP, guanine trinucleotide phosphate; Acc, accessory protein.'
