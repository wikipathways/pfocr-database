caption: 'Enteric glia properties during inflammation and potential mechanisms during
  viral infection. A: gastrointestinal and enteric neural COVID-19 features and hypotheses
  are highlighted. B: upon exposure to viral protein, enteric glia seems to activate
  a glial network response in a gut-brain direction through its Cx43 connections impacting
  central neuroinflammation and cognition. C: enteric glia are able to promote immune
  responses due to TLRs expression and ability to antigen presentation, besides ACE-2
  and TMPRSS2, molecule receptors relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. D: enteric glia
  reactivity is often associated with gastrointestinal dysfunctions (e.g., inflammatory
  bowel diseases, neurodegeneration) while gastrointestinal dysfunction is correlated
  with more severe respiratory tract conditions. E: during inflammation/disease, several
  homeostatic pathways between the glia and epithelium or glia and neurons are often
  deregulated impacting gastrointestinal health. Since enteric neurons are infected
  by SARS-CoV-2, neuro-glial interactions are probably modified. F: enteric glia release
  immune mediators, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, which collaborate with the
  NF-kB pathway. Several aspects of enteric glial physiology during gut inflammation
  could be related to the gastrointestinal and even systemic condition described during
  COVID-19, acting as a direct or indirect pathological inductor. Created with Bio-Render
