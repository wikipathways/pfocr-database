  T cells (termed IL-6 ‘cluster signalling’), resulting in their differentiation to
  Th17 cells via JAK-STAT signalling. The JAK/STAT signalling (by both cis and trans
  signalling) and RAS-RAF, SRC-YAP-NOTCH and AKT-P13K promote the transcription of
  multiple downstream genes associated with T-cell clonal amplification, B-cell differentiation,
  acute phase response production.'
