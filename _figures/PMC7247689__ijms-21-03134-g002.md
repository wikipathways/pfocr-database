caption: Mitochondrial homeostasis is based on the balanced interplay between biogenesis
  and mitophagy. On the left, some of the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial biogenesis
  are represented. The peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator-1α
  (PGC-1α) induces the expression of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), which regulates
  most of the nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes (NEMGs), and transcription factor
  A (TFAM), which governs mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). On the right, some aspects of
  the mitophagy process are represented. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
  negatively regulates the clearance of damaged mitochondria through the pathway dependent
  upon the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and the parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin
  protein ligase (PARKIN). LC3 promotes autophagosomes formation.
