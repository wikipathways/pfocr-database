caption: Canonical and non-canonical interferon-mediated signaling pathways. Type
  1 interferons (IFN) can trigger signals through the JAK-STAT-mediated canonical
  pathway and the formation of transcriptional-activator complexes, which translocate
  into the nucleus and activate the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)
  or IFN-γ-activated site (GAS). The activation of ISRE leads to the transcription
  of IL-1β, which, in turn, activates the complement cascade. Type 1 IFNs, specifically
  IFNα, stimulate the activation of IL-22, through IL-22R, which can efficiently stimulate
  STAT1 and its downstream pathway. IFNs’ non-canonical pathways include IFNα/B signaling
  via MAPKs pathway, involved in chromatin rearrangement, and IFNα/B signaling via
  PI3K and NF-kB pathway, involved in survival signals, angiogenesis and cell cycle.
  The interplay with Toll like receptor (TLR)-mediated pathway is already shown. The
  activation of T:R by pathogen-associated or damage-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs, DAMPs) triggers the pro-inflammatory NF-kB-mediated signaling pathway, which
  is inhibited by SOCS3, through the myddosome degradation. Toll-IL1-R receptor activates
  IL18, which support the activation of NF-kB pathway and interplays with IL-22 to
  activate MAPK-signaling pathway.

    Type 1 interferons (IFN) can trigger signals through the JAK-STAT-mediated canonical

    IFNα/B signaling via MAPKs pathway, involved in chromatin rearrangement, and IFNα/B
