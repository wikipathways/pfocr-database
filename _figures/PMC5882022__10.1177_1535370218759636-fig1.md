caption: Schematic illustration of the regulatory roles of different sirtuins in the
  reprogramming of human skin fibroblasts to generate induced pluripotent stem cells.
  Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) has been shown to positively regulate the formation of iPSCs through
  the miR34–SIR1–p53 axis. Furthermore, many miRNAs, such as miRNA-181a, miRNA181b,
  miR-9, miR-204, miR-199a/b, and miR135a have been identified to negatively regulate
  the expression of SIRT1. By contrast, the expression of SIRT2 has been shown to
  be downregulated during the formation of iPSCs. The expression of SIRT2 can be negatively
  regulated by miR200c. SIRT3 and SIRT6 have been shown to play important roles to
  enable senescent skin fibroblasts to be reprogrammed into iPSCs through upregulation
  of the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and MnSOD, and thereby
  leading to a decrease of ROS production. SIRT4 has been shown to negatively regulate
  the senescence of skin fibroblasts that are exposed to UV irradiation. SIRT5 can
  negatively regulate the ground state pluripotency of naïve iPSCs through downregulation
  of the LIF/JAK/STAT3 pathway. The role of SIRT7 in promoting mesenchymal-to-epithelial
  transition (MET) is yet to be determined since MET is crucial for the successful
  reprogramming of skin fibroblasts to iPSCs. (A color version of this figure is available
  in the online journal.)
