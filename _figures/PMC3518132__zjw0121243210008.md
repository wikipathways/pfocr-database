caption: Proposed mechanism of alkylphospholipid (ODPC)-induced raft-based inhibition
  of cell signaling. A, lipid rafts are membrane domains enriched in shingolipids
  (green) and cholesterol (blue) that serve as a scaffold for signaling through growth
  factor receptors (purple). The correct assembly of lipid rafts containing adaptor
  proteins such as LAT2 and Grb2 is essential for proper signaling of the AKT survival
  pathway (shown in A). Alkylphospholipids (ODPC) disrupt the assembly of lipid rafts,
  displacing raft-associated adaptor proteins. As a result, signal transduction is
  inhibited (shown in B). ODPC, 10-(octyloxy) decyl-2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl phosphate;
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases; Grb2, growth factor receptor-bound protein
  2; LAT2, linker for activation of T-cell family member 2; PTEN, phosphatase and
  tensin homolog; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1); AKT, v-AKT murine
  thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate;
  PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate.
