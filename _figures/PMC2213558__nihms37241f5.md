caption: A proposed model for how SMA-9 and the Sma/Mab TGFβ and LIN-12/Notch signaling
  pathways function in the M lineage in wild-type animals. Gray boxes represent cells
  of the M lineage. We propose that in the dorsal side of the M lineage, the Sma/Mab
  TGFβ signaling pathway is activated and promotes the SM cell fate. SMA-9 antagonizes
  this action, resulting in the formation of CCs. LIN-12 activity is restricted to
  the ventral M-derived cells by the activity of LAG-2, APX-1 and DSL-1, and it also
  promotes the SM cell fate. Although SMA-9 is present in the ventral cells, it does
  not antagonize LIN-12 function, due to either the lack of a SMA-9 co-factor(s) or
  the lack of binding sites in the promoters of LIN-12 target genes. At present, we
  do not know whether the Sma/Mab TGFβ and the LIN-12/Notch signaling pathways promote
  the SM fate by activating the SM fate determinant(s) or by activating a repressor(s)
  of the CC fate determinant(s).
