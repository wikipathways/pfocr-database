caption: HPV infected tumor cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment through
  several mechanisms. Downregulation of antigen presentation on MHC by HPV E5 or mutations
  in antigen presentation pathway genes leads to decreased recognition by effector
  T cells. Upregulation of the PD-L1 immune checkpoint on infected tumor cells can
  lead to inhibition of cytolytic T cell activity. HPV also modulates HLA expression
  to engage NK cell inhibitory receptors, for example through the interaction of HLA-E
  molecules with NKG2A. There is also evidence of HPV-antigen specific FOXP3+ T regulatory
  cells, which function to suppress both CD8+ and CD4+ cells in the tumor microenvironment.
  CD4+ cells are typically skewed towards a Th2 response due to an upregulation of
  Th2 cytokines, which stimulates a humoral response. In some HPV-positive malignancies,
  a high frequency of antibodies specific to E2, E6, and E7 is also detected.
