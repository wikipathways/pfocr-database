caption: Regulation of the extrinsic pathway by Hsps. Hsps regulate at multiple points
  within the signaling pathways activated by ligation of a cell surface death receptor
  by the appropriate ligand. These include the maintenance of prosurvival signals
  generated via TNF-mediated activation of NF-κB and suppression of proapoptotic signaling
  events, e.g., JNK activity and Bid cleavage. Integration of the extrinsic and intrinsic
  pathways is mediated via the caspase-8–mediated cleavage and activation of Bid as
  well as activation of JNK, which can impact on numerous molecules that regulate
  mitochondrial integrity (shown in the shaded area).
