caption: The glycolytic pathway and the 10 enzymatic steps that break down one molecule
  of glucose into two trios molecules, ending with pyruvate (aerobically) or, with
  an 11th step, lactate (anaerobically). This dogmatic configuration has guided scientists
  and science students ever since it was elucidated in 1940.
