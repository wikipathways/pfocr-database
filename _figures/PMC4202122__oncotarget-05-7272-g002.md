caption: 'MUC1 has demonstrated to be internalization by using clathrin and caveolin-mediated
  pathway, which is dependent on Rab5a, an early endosome marker. MUC1 has many interacting
  partners including EGFR family proteins, AP-2, Grb2 and β-catenin. MUC1 possesses
  a γ-secretase cleavage site and get cleaved in early endosome: (A) Cleaved MUC1-C,
  which is still in contact with β-catenin, travels to nucleus to increase the transcription
  of various genes that are regulated by the TCF promoter; MUC1-C interacts with heat
  shock proteins for mitochondrial (B) and lysosomal (C) translocation resulting in
  reduced cell death response to DNA damage and cathepsin mediated apoptosis, respectively;
  (D) MUC1, like other glycoproteins, undergoes multiple rounds of sialylation and
  glycosylation while continuing on the itinerary to the Golgi. MUC1 also has a CQCRRK
  sequence motif, which undergoes palmitoylation. These post-translational modifications
  and interacting protein partners play important roles in deciding the fate of MUC1.'
