  B cell-like (GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Germinal center B cell-like
  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL) are characterized by the inactivation

  pathways, which both negatively modulate GC B cell migration and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K) signaling [, –, , ]. In addition, activating mutations of the histone methyltransferase
  EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homologue 2) and master regulator of the GCB phenotype promote
  epigenetic changes that, at least partly, cooperate with the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)
  and BCL6 to mediate lymphomagenesis in GCB-DLBCL [, ]. A subset of GCB-DLBCL is
  characterized by translocations affecting the c-MYC and/or the BCL2 loci [, , ].
  These translocations lead to constitutive activation of c-MYC and the anti-apoptotic
  BCL2 protein and to a malignant transformation by preventing terminal differentiation
  or blocking apoptosis. The different colors that are used in the figure indicate
