caption: EGFR family members contribute to cell survival through multiple mechanisms.
  EGFR family members activate three of the major signaling pathways for cell survival
  including the RAS/MAPK pathway, the JAK/STAT pathway, and the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  Downstream signaling increases transcription levels of survival proteins, including
  Mcl-1 and Elk-1. It has also been shown that EGFR can translocate directly to the
  nucleus and activate transcription of survival genes. Finally, equilibrium between
  recycling EGFR back to the cell surface and sending it to the lysosome for degradation
  balances continued signaling.
