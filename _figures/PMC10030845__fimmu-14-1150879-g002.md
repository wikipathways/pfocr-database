caption: In ConA-induced mice, mtROS can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activated
  caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD and releases an active GSDMD N-terminal domain, which forms
  pores in the cell membrane and triggers pyroptosis. Activated caspase-1 also cleaves
  pro-IL-1β to IL-1β. An rhil-1ra can eliminate mtROS, reduce NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  and pyroptosis, suppress the expression of IL-1β, and alleviate ConA-induced hepatitis.
  Dimethyl fumarate can reduce mitochondrial damage and the production of mtROS. It
  can also enhance the PKA signaling pathway and increase the phosphorylation of NLRP3
  on Ser/Thr at PKA-specific sites, thereby inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
  Bmsc-derived exosomes bind to the 3′UTR of the Nlrp3 mrna through exosomal miR-223,
  which interferes with protein translation and inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation,
  thereby reversing hepatocyte injury in the S100- or LPS/ATP-induced mouse AIH model.
