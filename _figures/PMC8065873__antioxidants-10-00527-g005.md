caption: 'Schematic diagram of anti-metastatic mechanisms of herbal medicine in breast
  cancer: Herbal medicine suppress metastasis by blocking a series of EMT-related
  processes which starts with TGF-β1 and sequentially provoke Smad, Snail, twist,
  N-cadherin, and, etc. CXCL also mediates EMT which contributes to metastatic micro-environment
  formation. Moreover, herbal medicine can suppress the expression of MMPs, which
  play multiple key roles in facilitating the metastasis of tumor cells by direct
  or indirect pathways. In the latter, MMP-9 is stimulated by various pathways such
  as AKT/ERK, NF-κB, STAT3, CCR7-AP-1 pathway, mRNA modulations of uPA and TIMPs.
  AKT/ERK pathways are also stimulated by Cav-1 and VEGF which is the onset of angiogenesis.
  On the other hand, NF-κB induced by TNF-α can activate MMPs, as well as metastasis
  related factors such as CXCR3-CXCL10, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Besides, herbal medicines
  also stimulate cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest which are usually mediated
  by activation of ROS and caspase-3. Expression of CDK1/cyclin B1 and p21 stimulated
  from p53 were related with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Meanwhile, there are
  two opposite ways in which herbal medicine controls the immune response as anti-metastatic
  mechanisms. First of all, excessive inflammatory responses create a favorable environment
  for cancer metastasis. Recombinant S100 calcium-binding protein A8/A9 (S100A8/A9)
  mobilizes the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, and
  TNF-α through the production of ROS, which stimulates NF-κB in peripheral blood
  mononuclear cells. Furthermore, those inflammatory chemokines produce CXCL2 and
  CXCL5 which have strong chemotactic capacities on neutrophils. Herbal medicines
  suppress those excessive immune responses and prevent metastasis. In contrast, building
  up the overall immune system can upgrade the survival ability of patients. Natural
  combinations control Tregs and MDSC population, as well as increase the anti-tumor
  cytokine. This contributes to prolongation of life span. Abbrevation: ACE, Alisma
