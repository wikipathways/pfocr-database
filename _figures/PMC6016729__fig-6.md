caption: Proposed model of leukemic transformation in bone marrow niche. HSCs are
  predisposed to accumulate mutations. The first mutations occur often in epigenetic
  regulating genes. Preleukemic HSCs acquire more mutations and expand. The final
  transforming mutation occurs in progenitor cells derived from preleukemic HSCs and
  governs the self-renewal. The Notch pathway and b-catenin signaling alterations,
  RARγ-, Dicer-1-, and Sbds deficiency among the osteoblast lineage contribute to
  the leukemic transformation. RARγ, retinoic acid receptor gamma. To see this illustration
