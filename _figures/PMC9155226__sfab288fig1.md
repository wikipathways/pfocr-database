caption: 'Derangements in lipoprotein metabolism in CKD. Reproduced with permission
  from Ferro et al. []. Endogenous pathway: very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) move
  triglycerides from the liver into the peripheral circulation. Lipoprotein lipase
  (LPL) hydrolyses these from intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) to LDLs, which
  are cholesterol-rich dense particles that transport cholesterol peripherally and
  to the liver. LDL is cleared hepatically by the LDL receptor (LDLR) and by scavenger
  receptors such as scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1). Exogenous pathway: chylomicrons
  transport dietary fats from the gut, which are then metabolized by LDL to free fatty
  acids for cellular uptake and storage. HDLs transport cholesterol from the periphery
  to the liver. Renal impairment shifts this balance towards high triglycerides, low
  HDL and increased oxidized and carbamylated LDL (ox-LDL, c-LDL). There is also increased
  oxidation of lipoprotein particles in renal disease, making them more atherogenic.
