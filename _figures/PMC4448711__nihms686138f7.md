caption: Fkh (likely in collaboration with Sage and Sens) keeps the SG alive until
  the prepupal stage by preventing expression of the apoptosis inducers reaper (rpr)
  and head involution defective (hid). Fkh (and Sage +/- Sens) in combination with
  low level ecdysone signaling activate transcription of the Salivary glue secretion
  (Sgs) genes in late larvae. High-level ecdysone signaling just prior to pupation
  activates expression of the early ecdysone-responsive genes, which encode transcription
  factors. A subset of these transcription factors repress fkh and Sgs transcription
  and activate expression of genes required for glue secretion. Thus, the glue is
  secreted when Fkh begins to disappear. In turn, the disappearance of Fkh results
  in rpr and hid expression, which overcome DIAP and activate the cell death pathway.
  Thus, the SG dies shortly after it completes its final task of glue secretion.
