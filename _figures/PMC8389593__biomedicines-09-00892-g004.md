caption: Calcium signaling-related factors in APA. Calcium signaling-related factors
  that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of APA include the potassium channels
  TASK, PCP4, and Calneurin1. TASK is functionally defective due to genetic mutations
  that cause depolarization. PCP4 is a factor that activates CaM function. Calneurin1
  is a protein that binds intracellular calcium ions and transports them to the ER,
  where they enhance calcium signaling during depolarization.
