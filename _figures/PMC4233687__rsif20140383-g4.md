caption: Simplified scheme of the HIF signalling pathway. In both cytoplasm and nucleus
  (subscript n), HIF-1α can be asparaginyl-hydroxylated (aOH) by factor inhibiting
  HIF (FIH) and/or prolyl-hydroxylated (pOH) by PHD. Prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-1α is
  targeted for VHL-mediated degradation, whereas asparaginyl-hydroxylated HIF-1α prevents
  its transcriptional activity. Under DMOG (or hypoxia), PHD is inactivated, leading
  to HIF-1α protein stabilization and translocation to the nucleus. HIF-1α, PHD, FIH
  and VHL can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Nuclear HIF-1α dimerizes
  with HIF-1β, creating a transcriptional complex that can bind to the HIF-response
  elements (HRE) of the target genes, including that of PHD, leading to upregulation
  of PHD protein and generating a negative feedback loop. (Online version in colour.)
