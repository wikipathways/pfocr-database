caption: Overexpressed Rim101 restores capsule production in the ire1∆ mutant by enhancing
  secretion. Ire1 influences the localisation of the mating pheromone transporter
  (Ste6) and receptor (Ste3/Cprα) during mating. The molecular chaperone Kar2 partially
  affects sexual-mating efficiency as a downstream effector of Ire1. Ire1 negatively
  regulates the gene expression of mating pheromone (MFα1) in a Cpk1- and Ras1-dependent
  manner. ERCRT complex contains Vps23, Vps25, and Snf7. Rim101-T represents Rim101
  transcription factor.
