caption: Schematic diagram of PHB, carotenoid, and gellan production in Sphingomonas
  elodea ATCC 31461. The common synthetic pathway is shown on the black arrow. The
  pathway for gellan biosynthesis includes the synthesis of the three-nucleotide sugar
  precursors, assembly of the repeat unit by specific glycosyltransferases, polymerization,
  and export (blue arrow). The pathway for PHB biosynthesis starts from acetyl-CoA
  (orange arrow), which is also the precursor of acetate substituent of gellan. The
  pathway for carotenoid biosynthesis starts from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (glyceraldehyde-3-p)
  (orange arrow), which is also the precursor of acetyl-CoA and glycerate substituent
  of gellan.
