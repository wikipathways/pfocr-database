caption: '(A) Carbazole-catabolic pathway in Pseudomonas strains harboring pCAR1.1
  or pCAR1.2. The conversions indicated by solid arrows are catalyzed by plasmid-borne
  Car and Ant enzymes (), whereas those indicated by dashed arrows are catalyzed by
  enzymes encoded on the host chromosome. The enzyme designations are as follows:
  CarAaAcAd, carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase; CarBaBb, 2′-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol 1,2-dioxygenase;
  CarC, 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-(2′-aminophenyl)-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid hydrolase; CarD,
  2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate hydratase; CarE, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase; CarF,
  acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acylating); and AntABC, anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase.
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid. (B) Genetic organization of the car and ant clusters on
  pCAR1.1 or pCAR1.2. Black, gray, and white pentagons indicate regulatory genes,
  catabolic genes, and other ORFs, respectively. The ORF numbers are indicated below.
  The white boxes indicate four homologous ISs (three copies of ISPre1 and a single
  copy of ISPre2). ISPre1 contains tnpA1, and the 5′ region of ORF9 (shown in gray)
  is the transposed region of ISPre1 that contains tnpA2 and the 5′ region of antA
  (). The solid and dashed arrows indicate the induced and constitutive transcripts
  originating from Pant and PcarAa, respectively (, ). Pant is regulated by the AraC-XylS
  family activator AntR in the presence of anthranilate. The black bars under the
  gene cluster indicate the regions amplified by PCR (upper) and qRT-PCR (lower).'
