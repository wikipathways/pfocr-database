caption: Scheme of the polyphenol biosynthetic pathways in grape berries during development
  and ripening. These include shikimate pathway as the phenylalanine (Phe) source,
  the general phenylpropanoid pathway and the branches of monolignols and flavonoids,
  including flavonols, proanthocyanidins (PAs) and anthocyanins (ACs) The protein
  levels of the regulated enzymes are shown in coloured squares, indicating the change
  of expression (log2 ratio) for each developmental stage in relation to the 15 mm
  stage. In sequence order (left to right), stages are displayed from FS, 4 mm, 7
  mm, 15 mm, V-100, 110 g/l, and 140 g/l. Different isoforms or subunits of proteins
  are shown as different rows. The enzyme names for each catalytic step are indicated
  in red if differentially expressed and identified, or in black if not detected.
