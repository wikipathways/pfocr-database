caption: 'Model of the response of plants to biotrophic and necrotrophic plant pathogens
  (adapted from Glazebrook (): displayed are the interactions of Arabidopsis with
  the biotrophs Peronospora parasitica and Erysiphe ssp. and with the necrotrophs
  Alternaria brassicicola and Botrytis cinerea; SA, salicylic acid, JA, jasmonic acid,
  ET, ethylene; broken line arrows indicate to a possible interaction but which was
  not found in the chosen experiments while the solid line arrows indicate to the
  observed plant-pathogen-response). The defense reaction of Arabidopsis against biotrophic
  pathogens start with gene-for-gene recognition of the pathogen followed by rapid
  activation of defense and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the so-called
  “oxidative burst,” which is by self a signal for defense activation. ROS production
  is connected with the hypersensitive response (HR), also called “programmed cell
  death,” which limits the access of biotrophs that feed on living tissue to water
  and nutrients. HR is associated with the activation of the salicylic acid (SA) dependent
  signaling pathway that is connected with systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and
  the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins. For necrotrophic pathogens a different
  defense line takes place as they feed on dead plant tissue and host cell death is
  not predicted to limit their growth. Defense against necrotrophic pathogens is mainly
  mediated by JA and ET controlled defense as well as production of phytoalexins such
  as camalexin. The broken line arrows indicate that also mixed defense lines are
  possible for other biotrophic or nectrotrophic pathogens.'
