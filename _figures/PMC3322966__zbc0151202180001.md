caption: 'Major biochemical strategies for benzoate degradation and genetic arrangements
  of the box clusters in proteobacteria. A, schemes of the first biochemical steps
  of the classical aerobic (black box) and anaerobic (gray box) benzoate degradation
  pathways and that of the aerobic hybrid box pathway (white box) are shown. The activation
  and the dearomatization/ring-cleavage steps are indicated by white and striped arrows,
  respectively. The lower pathway that funnels the dehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde
  into the central metabolism is represented by a dotted arrow. OX, benzoate dioxygenase;
  DH, benzoate dihydrodiol dehydrogenase; DOX, catechol dioxygenase (ortho (intradiol)
  or meta (extradiol) cleavage). The Box enzymes responsible for the activation and
  dearomatization/ring-cleavage reactions are indicated: BclA, benzoate-CoA ligase;
  BoxA, NADPH-dependent reductase; BoxB, benzoyl-CoA 2,3-epoxidase; BoxC, 2,3-epoxybenzoyl-CoA
  dihydrolase. B, schemes of the major arrangements of the functional modules within
  the box clusters from proteobacteria are shown. The activation (C1, bclA gene),
  dearomatization/ring-cleavage (C2, boxABC genes), and lower pathway (C3) catabolic
  modules are shown by white, striped, and dotted arrows, respectively. The putative
  regulatory module (boxR gene) is shown by black arrows. It should be noted that
  the gene composition and arrangement within the C3 module can differ even among
  strains of the same genus. Type 1 box clusters are present in many β-proteobacteria,
  e.g. strains of the Azoarcus/Aromatoleum, Burkholderia, Bordetella, Polaromonas,
  Rhodoferax, Delftia, Variovorax, Leptothrix, Verminephrobacter, Comamonas, Achromobacter,
  Ralstonia, Cupriavidus genera. Type 2 box clusters are present in some α-proteobacteria
  where the C1 module can be associated, e.g. strains of the Silicibacter and Jannaschia
  genera, or not, e.g. Magnetospirillum sp. AMB-1, to the box cluster. Although types
  1 and 2 usually contain the boxA gene within the C2 module, in some strains this
  gene is missing. Type 3 box clusters are present in other α-proteobacteria where
  the C3 module contains only one gene and the C2 module lacks the boxA gene, e.g.
  strains of the Rhodopseudomonas and Bradyrhizobium genera, or in some β-proteobacteria,
  e.g. Thauera aromatica, where the C3 module is not found between the C1 and C2 modules.
  In the genome of some δ-proteobacteria, e.g. Sorangium cellulosum, there is a boxR
  gene divergently oriented to the C2 module (boxBC genes).'
