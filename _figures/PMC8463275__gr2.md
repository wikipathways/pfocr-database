caption: The mechanism of CDK relevant synthetic lethality. a) The inhibition of CDK1/2/9
  in cancer cells with MYC amplification can induce the apoptosis pathway and lead
  to synthetic lethality. Meanwhile, there are some synergistic strategies based on
  the synthetic lethality, such as CDK7 inhibitors plus 5-FU/Nutlin-3 in P53-wildtype
  cells, and CDK1 inhibitors combining with doxorubicin in P53-mutation cells. b)
  RAS regulates the expression of cyclin D via the MAPK and PI3K signal pathway, and
  it is a synthetic lethal factor in combination with CDK4/6 or with CDK1/2. c) PARPs
  are the proteins responsible for DNA single-strand break (SSB) repair, and BRCA1/2
  are known as DNA double-strand break (DSB) homologous recombination (HR) repair
  factors. CDK12 inhibition can result in the BRCA-loss phenotype, which makes PARPs
  and CDK12 inhibitors be able to be a valid synthetic lethality anti-tumor strategy
  in the future.
