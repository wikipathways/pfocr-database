caption: 'The NAD+biosynthetic pathways in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Budding
  yeast maintains the NAD+ pool by three major pathways: de novo synthesis (left panel),
  NA/NAM salvage (center circle) and NR salvage (right circle). NAD+ can be made by
  salvaging precursors such as NA, NAM and NR or by de novo synthesis from L-TRP.
  Yeast cells also release and re-uptake these precursors. The de novo NAD+synthesis
  (left panel) is mediated by Bna proteins (Bna2,7,4,5,1) leading to the production
  of NaMN. This pathway is inhibited by Hst1 when NAD+ is abundant and therefore is
  shown in gray color. The NA/NAM salvage pathway (center circle) also produces NaMN,
  which is then converted to NaAD and NAD+ by Nma1/2 and Qns1, respectively. NAD+
  biosynthesis from the NA/NAM salvage and de novo pathways converges at the formation
  of NaMN. The NA/NAM salvage pathway is highlighted with bold black arrows because
  most yeast growth media contain abundant NA. In mammals, NAM is converted to NMN
  by NAM phosphoribosyl transferase, NAMPT or converted to NA by microbial nicotimidase
  in the gut. NR salvage (right circle) connects to the NA/NAM salvage pathway by
  Urh1, Pnp1 and Meu1. NR turns into NMN by Nrk1, which is then converted to NAD+
  by Nma1, Nma2 and Pof1. For simplicity, NaR (nicotinic acid riboside) and NRH (reduced
  NR) salvage pathways, which overlap with NR salvage, are not shown in this figure.
