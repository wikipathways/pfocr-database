caption: 'Biosynthesis of neutral complex human milk oligosaccharides (HMO). The assumed
  biosynthetic pathway starts from the activated monosaccharides and includes the
  most important enzymes only [N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (GlcNAcT)]: iβ3GlcNAcT
  attaches N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the β1–3 position to terminal galactose
  (Gal), Iβ6GlcNAcT attaches GlcNAc in β1–6 position to terminal Gal. Galactosyltransferases
  (GalT): β3GalT attaches Gal in the β1–3 position to GlcNAc and β4GalT attaches Gal
  in the β1–4 position to GlcNAc. Fucosyltransferases (FucT): α2FucT attaches fucose
  (Fuc) in the α1–2 position to terminal Gal, secretor (Se) enzyme, α3FucT attaches
  Fuc in the α1–3 position to GlcNAc, α3/4FucT attaches Fuc in the α1–3/4 position
  to GlcNAc and in the α1–3 position to Glc of the lactose core, Lewis (Le) enzyme
  . The no entry signs mean that no further elongation takes place. Fucosylation is
  indicated exemplarily for terminal type 1 and type 2 chains. Glycan structures are
  depicted according to the recommendations of the Consortium of Functional Glycomics
  using the GlycoWorkbench software tool ().'
