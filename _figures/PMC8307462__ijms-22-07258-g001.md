caption: 'Scheme of l-serine, d-serine, and glycine synthesis in the central nervous
  system. In astrocytes, l-serine is synthesized from glucose by the phosphorylated
  pathway (orange) branching from glycolysis (black). 3-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate
  of glycolysis, is converted to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
  (PHGDH). Subsequently, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate is metabolized into 3-phosphoserine
  by phosphohydroxypyruvate aminotransferase (PSAT1). Finally, 3-phosphoserine is
  hydrolyzed to l-serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH). l-Serine is converted
  into glycine by serine/glycine hydroxymethyltransferase (sgHMT) and d-serine by
  serine racemase (SR). In neurons, conditions may favor the conversion of d-serine
  into l-serine and pyruvate. In addition, l-Serine may be an important source of
  sphingolipids and phospholipids. Abbreviations: TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; PHGDH,
  3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PSAT1, phosphohydroxypyruvate aminotransferase;
  PSPH, phosphoserine phosphatase; sgHMT, serine/glycine hydroxymethyltransferase;
  SR, serine racemase; NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors; AMPAR, ⍺-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoaxzolepropionic
  acid receptor.'
