caption: Schematic for the junctional regulation of vascular-endothelial (VE-)cadherin
  by delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4)-Notch signaling. The endothelial cells, covered by
  a layer of glycocalyx, form an intercellular cleft where two endothelial cells meet.
  The cleft contains adherens junctions and tight junctions (not shown). The adherens
  junctions consist of VE-cadherin bound to multiple signaling molecules (not shown).
  Upon activation of Notch by Dll4, cAMP is generated, either directly or indirectly,
  which results in strengthening of the VE-cadherin junctions. Recent work by Polacheck
  et al. has shown that the transmembrane domain of Notch can bind to the Lar-Trio-Rac1
  complex, which is known to be activated by phosphorylation by PKA.
