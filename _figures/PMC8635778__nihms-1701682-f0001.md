caption: Two distinct renal clearance pathways in the kidneys as well as renal cell
  carcinoma (RCC) targeting of fluorescent agents. a) Glomerular filtration happens
  at the glomeruli (G) and is a passive, non-specific process to eliminate molecules
  and nanoparticles from glomerular capillaries to Bowman’s space as long as their
  sizes are below the kidney filtration threshold (≈6 nm or 40 kDa). The filtrated
  molecules are then transported into bladder by travelling through the renal tubules
  of the nephrons such as proximal tubules (PT). b) The renal tubular secretion is
  an active, specific process for removal of small molecules from peritubular capillary
  (PTC) to renal tubular lumen through 1) binding of the molecule to the transporters
  on the basolateral side of tubular cells, influx into the cells and 2) efflux from
  the luminal side of tubular cells. Arrows indicate the direction of transport of
  exogenous substances. c) RCC originates from the renal tubular epithelial cells
  because of genetic mutation. d) For fluorescent-guided partial nephrectomy for RCC,
  fluorescent agents that selectively target kidney cancers over normal kidney tissues
  (hyperfluorescent) are preferred to improve the precision of tumor removal and preservation
  of kidney functions. However, most of current agents, especially for passive targeting
  agent, are retained in and light up normal kidney tissue, resulting in hypofluorescent
  imaging of primary RCC.
