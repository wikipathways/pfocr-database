caption: Recent studies have uncovered unsuspected cross-talk between the Hippo pathway
  and other growth regulators. Cell contact is still detected in MEFs lacking both
  Mts1 and Mts2, indicating an Mst-independent input (possibly a kinase) that can
  phosphorylate and activate Lats1 and Lats2. Lats1/2 then inhibits YAP/TAZ to control
  growth. YAP can function as a transcriptional co-activator of SMADs, enhancing BMP
  signaling. YAP also can stimulate Gli transcription, enhancing Shh signaling. AKT
  can inhibit Mst1 kinase, providing another avenue for growth promotion and anti-apoptotic
  activity of PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. TAZ can bind Dishevelled (Dvl), inhibiting
  β-catenin signaling in the cytoplasm. When TAZ translocates to the nucleus, it frees
  Dvl to activate β-catenin, enhancing Wnt signaling. Nuclear YAP also regulates the
  expression of Amphiregulin, an EGFR ligand. Therefore loss of Mst or Lats in one
  cell can drive proliferation in that cell, while simultaneously activating the proliferation
  of nearby cells via the EGFR pathway.
