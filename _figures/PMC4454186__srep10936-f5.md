caption: 'The ingested glucose in the cytoplasm of H. pylori through the HP1174 transporter
  is phosphorylated to produce glucose-6-phosphate which subsequently incorporated
  with three potential metabolic routes: glycolysis, pentose phosphate and the Entner-Doudoroff
  pathway to finally produce major metabolite CO2.This major metabolite CO2 is then
  transported through the blood streams and eventually excreted as 13C16O16O and 12C16O16O
  in exhaled breath. Conversely, the major metabolite CO2 diffuses rapidly through
  the inner member into the periplasm of H. pylori, where it forms carbonic acid (H2CO3),
  catalyzed by the α-CA. The isotopic exchange between 16O of 12C16O2 and 18O of H218O
  in response to periplasmic α-CA activity leads to the generation of 12C18O16O, which
  is then transported to the lungs and is excreted through exhaled breath.'
