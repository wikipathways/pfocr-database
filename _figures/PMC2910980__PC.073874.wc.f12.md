caption: Proposition of an ABAR-Mediated Signaling Model.(A) A model of functional
  domains in ABAR molecule. Numbers of the amino acid residues are shown in the molecule.
  See text for the model.(B) A model of ABAR-mediated signaling pathway. The symbol
  <?> indicates an unknown factor or signaling cascade that may repress the WRKY40
  gene expression. Note that ABAR interacts with WRKY40 in the absence or low levels
  of ABA, and ABA at high levels promotes this bimolecular interaction and triggers
  downstream signaling cascade. See text for this model in detail.
