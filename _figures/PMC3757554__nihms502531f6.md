caption: HCV-infected hepatocytes express HCV, Gal-9, and TGF-β proteins. CD4+ T cells
  exposed to this milieu up-regulate Tim-3 expression and are driven toward a CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory
  phenotype, but there is apoptosis of CD4+CD25+Foxp3− effector T cells. This would
  counter immunopathology but favor viral persistence.
