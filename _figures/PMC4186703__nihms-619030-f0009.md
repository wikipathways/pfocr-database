caption: 'Ang II stimulates various signaling pathways including reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) that culminates in the activation of intracellular kinases (MAPK). Attenuation
  of Ang II signaling within the kidney occurs through amino and carboxy terminal
  metabolism to Ang III and Ang-(1-7) by aminopeptidase A (APN) and ACE2, respectively.
  Formation of Ang-(1-7) will stimulate the generation of nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP
  that may antagonize the actions of Ang II, as well as complex superoxide (O2−) to
  form peroxynitrite (ONOO−). In addition, Ang-(1-7) may activate intracellular phosphatases
  (PTP) to attenuate the Ang II-induced phosphorylation of kinases. ACE may abrogate
  Ang-(1-7) signaling by enzymatic conversion to Ang-(1-5) which likely does not interact
  with the AT7/Mas receptor. Although not depicted, generation of Ang III from Ang
  II may contribute to increased formation of NO by stimulation of the AT2 receptor
  pathway. Additional abbreviations: calcium (Ca++); diacylglycerol (DAG); phosphoinositol
  3 kinase (PI3 kinase); protein kinase C (PKC); endothelial NO synthase (eNOS); soluble
  guanylate cyclase (sGC). Adapted from Chappell ().'
