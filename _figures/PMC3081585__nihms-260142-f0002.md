caption: Shown is a scheme of the biosynthetic pathway for Moco biosynthesis in E.
  coli and the proteins involved in this pathway. Moco is formed from 5'GTP with Precursor
  Z and MPT as intermediates. The molybdoenzymes are classified into three different
  enzyme families, the DMSO reductase family, the sulfite oxidase family and the xanthine
  oxidase family, a categorization based on the coordination of the molybdenum center.
  For enzymes of the DMSO reductase family, Moco is further modified by the attachment
  of GMP to form MGD, and two equivalents of MGD are bound to a single molybdenum
  to form the bis-MGD variant of the cofactor. Additional molybdenum ligands can be
  an oxo- or a sulfido group in addition to a serine, a cysteine, a selenocysteine
  or a hydroxide and/or water molecule. For enzymes of the sulfite oxidase family,
  Moco is directly inserted without further addition of a nucleotide and coordinated
  by an additional cysteine ligand in the enzyme. For enzymes in the E. coli xanthine
  oxidase family, Moco is further modified by the addition of a cytosine nucleotide
  to form the MPT-cytosine dinucleotide (MCD) form of the cofactor. Additionally,
  a terminal sulfur ligand is added to the molybdenum site, generating sulfurated
  molybdenum MCD. An additional ligand at the Mo-center usually is a hydroxo-group.
  The names of the proteins involved in the reactions are colored in red, and the
  identified and characterized molybdoenzymes of each E. coli molybdoenzyme family
  are shown in blue.
