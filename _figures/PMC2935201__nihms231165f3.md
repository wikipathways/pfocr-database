caption: In the steady state, transmembrane vascular-endothelium cadherin molecules
  form a calcium-dependent zipperlike structure across adjacent cell membranes, through
  homophilic interactions. The cytoplasmic tails of the cadherin are part of an intracellular
  macromolecular complex including β-catenin, P120, α-catenin, vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGF-R2), and CD148 phosphatase. The platelet in
  the steady state maintains the molecular integrity of the adherens junction by constitutively
  releasing a panoply of endothelial trophogens including brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-activating factor (PAF),
  sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), angiopoietin (ANG), and VEGF A (VEGF-A), among others.
  These trophogens signal through their respective receptors (BDNF-R, which binds
  BDNF; EGF-R, which binds EGF; endothelial differentiation gene 1 [EDG1], which binds
  S1P; angiopoietin receptor specific to endothelial cells [TIE2], which binds ANG;
  and PAF-R, which binds PAF), induce endogenous VEGF-A production, and activate the
  autocrine VEGF-A loop, which in turn induces VEGF-R2 phosphorylation, which is required
  for maintenance of the stability of the zipper. Specific phosphorylation sites of
  the catenin and cadherin constituents in the complex control stability and integrity
  of the intercellular junction and facilitate cytoskeletal attachment through F-actin.
  The paracrine pathway of exogenous VEGF-A signaling promotes survival in the steady
  state but proliferation in the nonsteady state. Shear stress at the luminal surface
  of the vessel wall and the platelet membrane may participate in the constitutive
  triggering of these platelet responses. PAF denotes platelet activating factor,
  and VE vascular endothelial.
