caption: LT-NNK exposure simulates the condition of cigarette smoking. LT-NNK exposure
  induced upregulation of Snail, with subsequent induction of EMT phenomenon characterized
  by alterated expressions of E-cadherin and vimentin, enrichment of CSC properties,
  and increase of anti-apoptosis via the Snail–RKIP signaling pathway, ultimately
  leading to chemoresistance and treatment failure.
