caption: Mg2+ and Gd3+ interfere with phosphate-induced SOCE upregulation by the activation
  of CaSR in megakaryocytes—a schematic representation. In megakaryocytes, the phosphate
  donor ß-glycerophosphate upregulates NFAT5 and SGK1 expression, which leads to the
  degradation of the NFκB inhibitory protein IκB with subsequent nuclear translocation
  of NFκB and NFκB-dependent transcription of ORAI1 and STIM1. CaSR can be activated
  by cations such as Mg2+ and Gd3+ and inhibits phosphate-induced SOCE enhancement,
  at least partially, via the downregulation of the signaling pathway. CaSR, calcium-sensing
  receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
