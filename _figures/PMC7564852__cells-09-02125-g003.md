caption: Schematic depicting the molecular mechanism of co-activators involved in
  TCF/LEF-dependent β-catenin transcriptional activities and their functional consequences.
  (A) TBL1 (Transducin β-like protein 1) and TBLR1 (TBL1-related protein) interact
  with nuclear β-catenin, and the interaction promotes their binding to the promoters
  of Wnt target genes. Subsequently, TLE1 and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), two transcriptional
  repressors, are displaced to initiate downstream transcriptional cascades. (B) PAF
  (PCNA-associated factor) recruits EZH2, a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase, to
  the β-catenin-TCF/LEF complex. Consequently, EZH2 and the Mediator complex recruit
  RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional machinery to activate Wnt target gene
  expression. (C) Under Wnt stimulation, stabilised FOXM1 (Forkhead box protein M1)
  can release β-catenin from ICAT (aka CTNNBIP1, β-catenin-interacting protein 1),
  thus abolishing its inhibition on β-catenin-TCF/LEF complex to transcribe Wnt target
  genes. (D) TRIB3 (Tribbles pseudo-kinase 3) participates in a positive feedback
  loop. TRIB3, a downstream target of the Wnt pathway, can stabilise the β-catenin-TCF4
  complex, thus improving its transcriptional activity. (E) SATB1 (Special AT-rich
  sequence-binding protein-1) regulates TCF4 expression, and complexes with β-catenin
  to transcribe Wnt downstream genes.
