caption: Model showing effects of MI-2 on sterol synthesis. (Left) In the absence
  of MI-2, there is basal but low flux through the shunt pathway. (Right) MI-2 disproportionately
  inhibits the conversion of 2,3-oxidosqualene to lanosterol, and flux through the
  shunt pathway is increased, with concurrent decrease in flux from 2,3-oxidosqualene
  to cholesterol. Elevation of 24,25 epoxycholesterol contributes to cholesterol depletion
  by activation of LXR.
