caption: Schematic representation of TRAIL canonical signalling pro-apoptotic pathway.
  Illustration of the membrane-bound TRAIL, expressed by cytolytic immune cells such
  as NK cells inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. TRAIL binding to DR4 and/or DR5
  agonist receptors, induce their aggregation and the recruitment of FADD and caspase-8/10
  forming the DISC (death-inducing signalling complex), or complex I, which ultimately
  will lead to the activation of the effector caspases 3/6/7. Their activation by
  enzymatic cleavage is either triggered directly by the active caspase-8 or indirectly
  through caspase-8-mediated Bid cleavage. Bid cleavage allows Bax translocation to
  mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c, whose binding with Apaf-1, amplifies
  apoptosis-induced by TRAIL receptors (extrinsic pathway), through the formation
  of a soluble pro-apoptotic complex coined apoptosome, that allows activation of
  the initiator caspase-9. The active caspase-9 will in turn amplify the signal by
  cleaving and activating the effector caspases 3/6/7. The main inhibitors of this
  signalling pathway are represented in red, including the antagonist receptors (DcR1/2/3
  and OPG) which compete for TRAIL binding or c-FLIP and XIAP the main caspase-8 and
  effector caspases inhibitor inhibitors, respectively. In addition, a schematic representation
  of the non-canonical signalling associated with complex I is shown, mainly describing
  potential activation of NF-κΒ pathway, which besides protecting the cells from TRAIL-induced
  apoptosis is involved in promoting TRAIL’s pro-tumoral activity. Main TRAIL-induced
  apoptosis inhibitors are shown in red
