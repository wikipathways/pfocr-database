caption: 'Proposed model for metabolic pathways interacting with GAPCp activity. Lack
  of GAPCp activity reduces the 3-PGA precursor for the PPSB which provides Ser to
  specific non-photosynthetic cells but also 2-oxoglutarate required for ammonium
  assimilation through the GS/GOGAT pathway and/for anaplerotic reactions into the
  TCA cycle. The reduced activity of the PPSB would affect the GS/GOGAT pathway which
  would increase glutamine and would divert L-glutamate to the biosynthesis of GABA.
  This amino acid could play a role in balancing carbon and nitrogen metabolism in
  gapcp1gapcp2 by contributing to anaplerotic flux of glutamine-derived carbon into
  TCA cycle when PPSB is restricted. The enzymes participating in each biosynthetic
  pathway are as follows: Phosphorylated pathway (PPSB): PGDH, 3-phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase; PSAT, 3-phosphoserine aminotransferase; PSP, 3-phosphoserine phosphatase.
  Ammonium assimilation pathway (GS/GOGAT): GS, glutamine synthetase, GOGAT, glutamate
  synthase. Other enzymes: GAD, glutamate decarboxylase; GAPC, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; ENO, enolase; npGAPC, non-phosphorylating GAPC; PGK, phosphoglycerate
  kinase; PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase; p at the end of the enzyme name stands for
  plastidial. Translocators: GPT, glucose phosphate/Pi translocator; PPT, phosphoenolpyruvate/Pi
  translocator; TPT, triose phosphate/Pi translocator. Abbreviations used for metabolites:
