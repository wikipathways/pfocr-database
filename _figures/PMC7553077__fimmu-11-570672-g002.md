caption: Recent advances in engineering different immune cell types for immunotherapy
  applications. Engineered T cells in the B2M gene have lowered HLA class I antigen
  expression on the cell surface and have reduced the possibility of graft rejection.
  TCR/CD3 cells have been knocked out to reduce GVHD and to enable physiological CAR
  expression, thus enhancing CAR T potency. Tumor-suppressive microenvironments have
  been overcome by downregulating CTLA-4, PD1, and LAG-3. T cells have also been engineered
  to ignore suppressive signals by expressing dominant negative TGF beta receptors
  (TGBR2). On the other hand, to engraft T cells under lymphodepleting preparative
  conditions, the elimination of CD52 is required to enable T cells to resist alemtuzumab-mediated
  lymphodepletion. Targeting CD7 prevents fratricide and enables the expansion of
  CD7 CAR T cells without compromising their cytotoxic function. IL-2R has also been
  engineered to facilitate IL12P70 expression in a controlled manner. Cyclin-dependent
  kinase 5 (Cdk5), a serine/threonine kinase, whose inhibition confers antitumor immunity,
  has been identified to regulate the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. HSPCs are also gene edited
  to enhance adoptive immunotherapy. CD33-deficient human HSPCs resistant to CD33-targeted
  approaches have been produced to mitigate CART33 toxicity, to maintain myelopoiesis,
  and to prevent on-target off-tumor toxicity. Immune NK cells play an important role
  in host immunity against cancer and viral infections. Despite the low efficiency
  of viral and non-viral delivery methods, several NK cells can be edited to enhance
  their persistence, cytotoxicity, and tumor targeting (). Dendritic cells (DCs) play
  a critical role in T-cell response instructions, with triple knockout established
  as proof of concept (). A similar approach is used to target the costimulatory molecule
  CD40, whose disruption significantly inhibits T-cell activation, thus reducing graft
  damage and prolonging graft survival (). Macrophages can also be edited using CRISPR-CAS9
  by targeting USP7 and USP47, two genes that regulate inflammasome activation ().
  The Ntn1 gene, thought to be involved in cell migration disruption, can also be
  targeted in vivo using nanoparticles encapsulating CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs under the control
  of the CD68 promoter (). To elucidate its role in inflammation, the NEU1 gene can
  be targeted in macrophages using CRISPR-CAS9, thus demonstrating the role of NEU1
  macrophages as inflammation enhancers (). It is also possible to engineer B cells
  to express mature broadly neutralizing bNAb antibodies targeting IgH loci or safe
  harbor CCR 5 in the case of FIX. Figures were created by BioRender.com.
