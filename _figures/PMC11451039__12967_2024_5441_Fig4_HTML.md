caption: 'Therapeutic agents targeting the Ang/Tie2 signaling pathway. (A): AKB-9778
  is administered by subcutaneous injection. AXT107, nesvacumab and faricimab are
  administered by intravitreal injection. (B): AXT107 inhibits VEGF-mediated signaling
  pathways and promotes Tie2 activation. COMP-Ang1 activates Tie2 with stronger agonistic
  activity than the native Ang1. Both AKB-9778 and ARP-1536 inhibit the activity of
  VE-PTP, thus activating Tie2. (C): Nesvacumab is an anti-Ang2 monoclonal antibody.
  Faricimab is a bispecific antibody that can binds to VEGFA and Ang2 with high affinity.
  Vanucizumab is a bispecific antibody that targets both VEGFA and Ang2. AMG 386 is
  an antibody that effectively blocks the binding between Tie2 and ligands angiopoietin
  (Ang1 and Ang2). ABTAA is a dual functional antibody that binds Ang2 and activates
  Tie2. Created with BioRender.com'
