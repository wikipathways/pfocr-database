caption: Gene–metabolite interaction revealed using multi-omics analysis. (A) Enzymes
  in glycolysis pathway altered by estradiol treatment. (B) Commonly altered genes
  and metabolites among all three networks (see ) of HepG2 cells treated with estradiol,
  ERα specific agonist PPT, and ERβ specific agonist DPN. Each square node represents
  one metabolite and each circle node represents one gene. Sizes of nodes are proportional
  to their degree values, signifying number of their connections to other nodes. Nodes
  with higher degree values act as hubs in a network. Colors of nodes reflect their
  betweenness centrality values, signifying number of shortest paths or interactions
  going through the nodes.
