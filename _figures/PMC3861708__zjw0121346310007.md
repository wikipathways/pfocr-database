caption: Proposed models for ethylene signaling networks. A, a model of the ethylene
  signaling network is reconstructed by integrating the phosphoproteins regulated
  by either ethylene or CTR1 protein with the well-known linear ethylene signaling
  pathway. B, dual-and-opposing effect of ethylene on arginine/serine-rich splicing
  factor (ATRSP41, AT5G52040). C, dual-and-opposing effect of ethylene on plasma membrane
  intrinsic protein 2A (PIP2A, AT3G53420). D, dual-and-opposing effect of CTR1 on
  light harvesting chlorophyll A/B binding protein 1.1 (LHCB1.1, AT1G29920). E, dual-and-opposing
  effect of ethylene on flowering gene bHLH 3 (FBH3, AT1G51140). Octagons, circles,
  boxes, and hexagons represent receptors, kinases, phosphatases, and other components
  of the ethylene signaling network, respectively. Arrows represent positive effects,
  whereas stop ends represent negative effects. Red and gray lines represent protein
  phosphorylation and protein dephosphorylation, respectively, and cyan lines represent
  the regulation of gene expression. Black line represents the effect on the synthesis
  of hormones. Solid lines represent direct regulation, and double solid lines represent
  direct or indirect regulation. Dashed lines represent putative interactions. A dashed
  line with a question mark means the regulation is assumed.
