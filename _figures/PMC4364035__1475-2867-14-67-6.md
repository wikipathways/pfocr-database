caption: Model of RelB influence in 22Rv1 cells in xenograft assays. In 22Rv1 cells,
  exogenous RelB induces the activation of alternative NF-κB pathway, resulting in
  undetermined target-genes and specific cell responses. The tumor growth initiation
  in vivo, cells are suspended in semi-solid media, mimicking anchorage free conditions
  that trigger autophagy in the RelB expressing cells (green lined pink colonies).
  At this time there is a low proportion of proliferating cells (red colonies) and
  the balance autophagy/proliferation weighs in favor of autophagy. Triggered autophagy
  then protects 22Rv1-RelB cells from stress induced by suspension conditions until
  they recover optimal growth conditions once they are anchored within mouse ECM.
  The colonies continue to grow and form the tumor mass (until 500 mm3 of tumor size)
  where adherence conditions predominate. At this time the balance autophagy/proliferation
  weighs in favor of proliferation resulting in increase of tumor growth rate.
