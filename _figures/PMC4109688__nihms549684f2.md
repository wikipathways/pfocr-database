caption: (a) Multiplex immunoprecipitation detected by flow cytometry (MIF) is used
  to measure the extent to which seven members of the TCR signaling pathway appear
  together in shared complexes upon antigenic engagement. These include several well-characterized,
  proven contributors to TCR signaling, although there are many proteins involved
  in the pathway that are not depicted. The TCR/CD3 complex is depicted as a single
  entity, although it is composed of multiple protein subunits. Arrows indicate the
  potential for antigenic stimulation to induce the formation of shared complexes
  containing the indicated proteins, although tertiary (or multiple) other proteins
  not depicted may also be involved in complex formation. To simplify the figure,
  only a few of multiple known possible associations between these proteins are displayed.
  (b) Stimulation of human peripheral blood T cells by plate-bound anti-CD3 Ab (5
  minutes, 37 °C) induces the formation of protein complexes along the TCR signaling
  pathway. MIF detects the activity of multiple proteins joining each other in shared
  complexes during the early minutes of TCR/CD3 engagement. Fold induction, MIF readout
  comparing stimulated/unstimulated levels.
