caption: Following synthesis, the apoB protein remains associated with the ER bilayer
  (left-hand side). This pre-VLDL particle is trafficked to the Golgi, where apoB
  then receives lipid ligands in bulk to form a full-sized VLDL particle (bottom,
  right). ApoB topology shifts and the VLDL particle is released from membrane association,
  followed by rapid secretion from the hepatocyte (top right). MTP is necessary for
  the formation of apoB-free lipid droplets (left, bottom), but MTP enzymatic activity
  is not required to facilitate the posttranslational bulk transfer of lipids onto
  apoB in the Golgi. ApoB is subject to late-stage quality control at the Golgi, where
  apoB can be removed from the secretory pathway by autophagy machinery. Movement
  of lipid metabolites is possible from cytosolic lipid droplets (CLD) to and from
  the ER bilayer, or to autophagosomes. Metabolic regulatory cues will determine the
  relative rate at which lipid metabolites are mobilized to the ER for export as VLDL,
  stored in the cytosol, oxidized in the mitochondria (not shown) or catabolized by
  autophagy. When apoB is destroyed via autophagy, its lipid cargo may become recycled
  and enter lipid pools that are oxidized, stored or re-mobilized to the ER.
