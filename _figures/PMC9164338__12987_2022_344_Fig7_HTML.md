caption: 'Schematic representation of the proteins involved in the interferon signaling
  induced in antiviral response that are significantly predicted by Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis to be affected by the flow in hCMEC/D3 cells. Analysis gives the common
  responses to shear stress exposure at both 5 and 10 dyn.cm−2 compared to the static
  culture. Relative changes in protein levels are depicted by graduated shades of
  color coding: red, up; green, down; white, no change or not applicable; orange:
  activation predicted; blue: inhibition predicted. Proteins in surrounded of purple
  are modified only at 10 dyn.cm−2 vs static; and those surrounded of pink are modified
  only at 5 dyn.cm−2 vs static'
