caption: Biosynthetic pathway for ectoine and hydroxyectoine. The data specifying
  the activities of the ectoine (EctABC) and hydroxyectoine (EctD) biosynthetic enzymes
  were compiled from the literature (; ; ; ; ; ). EctB catalyzes the first step of
  ectoine biosynthesis; it mediates the PLP-dependent reversible conversion of L-aspartate-β-semialdehyde
  and L-glutamate into 2-oxoglutarate and L-2,4-diaminobutyrate (DAB) (black arrow).
  The red arrow indicates the “reverse reaction” of the EctB enzyme (red), which is
  also dependent on the cofactor PLP (yellow), and which was used in this study to
  assess the biochemical activities of the (Pl)EctB aminotransferase.
