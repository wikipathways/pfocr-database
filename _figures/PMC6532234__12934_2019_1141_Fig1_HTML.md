caption: Schematic representation of the signalling pathways and deletions investigated
  in the current study. a The three main sugar signalling pathways in S. cerevisiae,
  adapted from []. The Snf3p/Rgt2p pathway (green) handles expression of hexose transporters
  in response to extracellular glucose. The SNF1/Mig1p pathway (red) handles expression
  of genes related to alternative (non-glucose) carbon sources in response to intracellular
  phosphorylated glucose. The cAMP/PKA pathway (blue) handles e.g. cellular growth,
  homeostasis and stress response. b Detailed schematic map of the cAMP/PKA pathway
  with the genes that were deleted in the current study marked with a red cross. Note
  that two of the three genes (IRA2, HOG1) are closely related to the pathway, whereas
  the third one (ISU1) is located in the mitochondria and seemingly unrelated to the
  cAMP/PKA pathway. b was adapted from [, , , , –]. Solid arrows represent reactions/transport
  and dashed arrows represent induction (arrowhead) or repression (hammerhead)
