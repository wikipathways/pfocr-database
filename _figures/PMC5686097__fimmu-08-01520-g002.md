  resolution phenotype. Glucose is essential for both inflammatory and resolution
  macrophage phenotypes. In inflammatory macrophages, glucose is largely processed
  to yield lactate via aerobic glycolysis. Another major pathway in M1 spectrum macrophages
  is conversion to ribose-5P via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for synthesis
  of nucleotides and NADPH, which supports nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), and IL-1β production. In resolution macrophages, the major fate of glucose
  is the TCA/Krebs cycle via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-catalyzed conversion of
  pyruvate to AcetylCoA (AcCoA). The TCA cycle in resolution macrophages is also fed
  by fatty acids (FA) via the ATP-citrate lyase (Acly) enzyme and promotes forward
  electron transport chain (ETC), from C1 to CIV, for ATP generation. In contrast,
  while some glucose enters the mitochondria in inflammatory macrophages, where it
  is converted to citrate, the TCA cycle is broken, with stops at the isocitrate dehydrogenase
  (IDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SHD) steps. Citrate accumulation results in itaconate
  production, which inhibits SDH, and also promotes prostaglandin (PG), lipid and
  FA synthesis. In inflammatory macrophages, these blocks promote reverse electron
  transport chain (RET) from CII to CI. GLUT1, glucose transporter 1/SLC2A1; HK2,
