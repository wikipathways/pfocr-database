caption: The metabolic pathway diagram for the main phenolic metabolites. The content
  of phenolic metabolites is shown in heat maps based on the abundance in the metabolite
  profile. Blue indicates low expression and red indicates high expression. The main
  phenolic metabolites detected in this study are colored in blue and their corresponding
  metabolic pathways are colored in yellow. The metabolites in black represent that
  they were not detected
