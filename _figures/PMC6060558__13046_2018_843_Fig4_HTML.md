caption: Enriched GO network groups using ClueGO/CluePedia-based enrichment. a Network
  view for KEGG pathway of CurcuUp-Regulated proteins and b Biological Process of
  CurcuDown-Regulated proteins. Terms (each represented as node) are functionally
  grouped based on shared genes (kappa score ≥ 0.4) and are shown with different colors.
  The specific players (proteins) of each node are highlighted with the respective
  gene name Node color represents the class that they belong. The size of the nodes
  indicates the degree of significance. Within each class, the most significant term
  (indicated with colored and bold characters) defines the name of the group. Ungrouped
  terms are not shown
