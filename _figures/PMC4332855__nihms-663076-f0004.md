caption: Different body sites are colonized by diverse groups of fungi, and the communities
  are shaped by the characteristics of each environment. Epithelial cells at these
  surfaces produce antimicrobial peptides that directly modulate fungal survival.
  In response to fungi, cytokines and chemokines that recruit immune cells are also
  produced. Fungi may also be directly sensed by dendritic cells and γδT cells at
  epithelial surfaces. When epithelial barriers are breached, macrophages, dendritic
  cells, and neutrophils kill fungi and produce cytokines that promote adaptive immune
  responses. Innate lymphoid cells may also respond directly to fungi by producing
  cytokines. Genetic studies in humans have revealed proteins (indicated in red) that
  are particularly important for antifungal defence and implicate a crucial role for
  the IL-17 pathway in this process.
