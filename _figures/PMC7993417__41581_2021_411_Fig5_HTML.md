caption: a | Arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins are exposed to different
  types of blood flow as defined by its pulsatility and the level of shear stress.
  b | Glomerular capillaries are exposed to high shear stress as a result of high
  blood flow and pressure together with increasing blood viscosity due to the filtration
  process. c | Some regions of renal arteries and arterioles — which control kidney
  blood perfusion and glomerular filtration rate — are exposed to laminar blood flow,
  whereas other regions — particularly regions of vessel bifurcation — are exposed
  to disturbed blood flow. Regions of disturbed blood flow are more likely to develop
  atherosclerotic lesions. d | Endothelial cells (ECs) exposed to laminar blood flow
  inhibit glycolytic metabolism in a KLF2-dependent manner and divert glycolytic intermediates
  to pathways involved in glycocalyx biosynthesis (left panel). Laminar flow also
  induces SIRT1–PGC1α–TFAM-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, and stimulates the production
  of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-derived ATP, which activates purinergic P2X4
  receptors and further induces the activation of KLF2 and KLF4 transcription factors.
  Moreover, Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and KLF4 are upregulated in response to MEK5–ERK5
  pathway activation (right panel). Laminar blood flow promotes EC quiescence, the
  production of antioxidants, the formation of a tight endothelial barrier and the
  acquisition of an anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory phenotype, and protects against
  proteinuria while maintaining glomerular filtration. e | Disturbed blood flow represses
  the protective pathways induced by laminar blood flow. Induction of microRNA (miR)-92a
  by disturbed flow represses the endothelial expression of KLF2, KLF4 and SIRT1 and
  PPAP2B, releasing the inhibitory effect of PPAP2B on circulating lysophosphatidic
  acid (LPA). Binding of LPA to its receptor LPAR1 induces pro-inflammatory signalling.
  The induction of SREBP2 upregulates HMG-CoA reductase, which increases intracellular
  cholesterol levels, and further upregulates miR-92a. Hypermethylation of the KLF4
  promoter prevents MEF2 binding and subsequent KLF4 transcription (left panel). ECs
  exposed to disturbed blood flow also demonstrate an uncoupling of glycolysis from
  mitochondrial metabolism, with an upregulation of glycolysis. Disturbed flow also
  induces the production of NOX4-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activates
  nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), leading to the upregulation and stabilization of hypoxia
  inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). Activation of the NF-κB pathway has been linked to
  heparanase activity and consequent glycocalyx degradation (right panel). Disturbed
  blood flow ultimately triggers EC activation and oxidative stress, impairs the endothelial
  barrier, induces a procoagulant and pro-inflammatory EC phenotype, and favours the
  development of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. ERK, extracellular signal
