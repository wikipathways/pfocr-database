caption: Cell-cell crosstalk model of purinergic regulation in the epididymis. Model
  showing the participation of purinergic regulation in the coordinated interaction
  between principal cells and clear cells, leading to the establishment of an optimal
  acidic luminal environment in the epididymis. Located on the apical membrane of
  PCs, CFTR activation stimulates ATP secretion by the pannexin-1 channel (PANX-1).
  Extracellular ATP is then hydrolyzed into adenosine by ectonucleotidases (EctoN)
  that are present on the apical surface of the epithelium. Luminal ATP activates
  the P2X4 receptor, and adenosine activates the A2B receptors located on the apical
  membrane of CC. Activation of A2B by adenosine leads to an elevation in intracellular
  cAMP. Activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway then induces V-ATPase apical membrane accumulation.
  Intracellular calcium also facilitates V-ATPase membrane accumulation in CCs, following
  P2X4 receptor activation by luminal ATP. The redistribution of V-ATPase from intracellular
  vesicles to the apical membrane results in the formation and elongation of V-ATPase-enriched
  microplicae in CCs, which stimulates proton secretion. The P2X4 and A2B receptors
  are also located on the apical membrane of PC, and their role in PC function is
  currently being evaluated.
