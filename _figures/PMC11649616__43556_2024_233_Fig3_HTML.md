caption: 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts crosstalk with extracellular matrix.Cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) affect the deposition and degradation of extracellular matrix
  (ECM) and promote tumor growth by affecting the ECM. CAFs promote the degradation
  of the ECM through the secretion of metalloproteinases (MMPs) leading to the release
  of various growth factors from the ECM to activate the growth signaling pathway
  of cancer cells. At the same time, the changes in ECM counteract the CAFs and tumor
  cells. The main manifestations are: (a) the hard ECM triggers the release of Twist
  from CAFs, prompting CAFs to secrete type VI collagen fibers single chain, which
  exacerbates the hardness of ECM. (b) the hard ECM triggers Twist in cancer cells,
  which triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promotes metastasis.
  In addition, collagen fibers of ECM inhibited the Hippo pathway by connecting with
  integrins of CAFs, and up-regulated YAP expression to activate growth signaling
  and promote cell proliferation'
