caption: 'Role of TIGIT in the regulation of immune response. TIGIT transmits inhibitory
  signals via ITIM and immunoglobulin tyrosine tail (ITT)-like motifs in its cytoplasmic
  domain when it is engaged. TIGIT has multiple ligands, but it binds with greater
  affinity to CD155, which is widely expressed by immune cells and tumor cells. CD155
  expressing tumor cells bind to TIGIT expressed by immune cells inducing an immunosuppressive
  and tolerogenic microenvironment: CD4+ T cells induce a tolerogenic phenotype in
  DCs, release the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and down-regulate INF-γ; CD8+
  T cells up-express TIGIT and down-regulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokine
  IL-2, which in turn promotes a T cell immunosuppressive phenotype characterized
  by increase in Foxp3+ Tregs and Th2 compared to pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17; NKs
  cytotoxicity is suppressed; and macrophages switch to an M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype.
  This simplistic view does not integrate signals from the CD226/CD155 pathway.'
