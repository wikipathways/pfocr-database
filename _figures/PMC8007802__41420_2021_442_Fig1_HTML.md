caption: A The TP53I3-S252X and FANCM-R1931X mutation found in the OCJ19 proband (arrow)
  and has a family history of breast and ovarian cancer. B Patient OCG14 also has
  a family history of breast and ovarian cancer. No RRO represents no surgical prevention
  intervention and A&W means the relative is alive and well.
