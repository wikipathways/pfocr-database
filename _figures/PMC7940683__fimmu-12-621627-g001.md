caption: The role of Siglec-G in sepsis. (A) Damage-associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPs) are released from damaged cells during sepsis and recognized by TLR4, fueling
  inflammation. DAMPs also bind to CD24, and this di-molecular complex further binds
  to Siglec-G through CD24’s sialic acid moiety to form a tri-molecular complex. Siglec-G
  leads to SHP1 activation which downregulates NF-κB activity and pro-inflammatory
  cytokine production. In polymicrobial sepsis, bacterial sialidases remove sialic
  acid residue from CD24, abrogating the CD24-Siglec-G interaction, thus enhancing
  the inflammatory process. (B) Siglec-G regulates PAMPs-TLR4-mediated signaling during
  sepsis. Siglec-G inhibits Src activation through the activation of SHP1 via Siglec-G’s
  ITIM domain. Src inhibits TLR4-induced inflammatory cytokines and increases the
  expression of IL-10 by activating STAT3. In Siglec-G deficient macrophages due to
  less recruitment of SHP1, Src is activated at its optimal level possibly through
  TLR4 pathway. Src then promotes HIF1α degradation through activating GSK3β. HIF1α
  is critical in inducing LPS-induced inflammatory response. As such, Src-induced
  degradation of HIF1α results in less pro-inflammatory cytokines production upon
  LPS stimulation in Siglec-G deficient immune cells. Thus, Siglec-G coordinates TLR4-induced
  pro- and anti-inflammatory cascades in sepsis.
