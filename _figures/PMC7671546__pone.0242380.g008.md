caption: In the TRH neuron of the hypothalamic PVN (top) and thyrotroph of anterior
  pituitary lobe (bottom), TRβ2 associates with the Zn-finger region of GATA2 via
  protein-protein interactions, resulting in the T3-dependent interference of GATA2-dependent
  transactivation (tethering mechanism). The prepro-TRH gene is activated by multiple
  transcription factors stimulated by cognate cell membrane receptor signals (see
  main text), resulting in the fine-tuning of the set point of H-P-T axis. Broken
  lines indicate the signaling pathway via cell-membrane receptors/protein kinases.
  Although site 4 is dispensable for the T3-dependent negative regulation of the preproTRH
  gene, it may have physiological relevance at least in CV1 cells. In TRH neuron of
  the PVN, mature TRH (pyro-Glu-His-Pro-NH2) is synthesized via multiple processing
  steps. In thyrotrophs, liganded TRH receptor stimulates the TSHβ and CGA gene expression
  and TSH secretion via the PKC pathway. In the TSHβ gene, Pit1 protects the transactivation
  function of GATA2 from the inhibitory effect by suppressor region-binding protein
  (SRBP) []. PKC, protein kinase C. JAK2, Janus kinase 2. PKA, protein kinase A. CA,
  catecholamine. αMSH, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone. GRE, glucocorticoid-responsive
  element. AP-1, AP-1 binding site. CRE, c-AMP-responsive element. TRH-R, TRH receptor.
  α, CGA. β, TSHβ. nTRE, the reported negative T3 responsive element in the TSHβ gene.
