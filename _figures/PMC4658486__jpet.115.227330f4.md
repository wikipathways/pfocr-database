caption: Pathophysiology and management of CVD. Certain genetic, behavioral, and environmental
  risk factors cause an increase in hydrostatic pressure in the lower-extremity saphenous
  and femoral veins, leading to venous reflux and valve dysfunction. Increased hydrostatic
  pressure also increases vein wall tension, leading to increases in MMPs, and could
  also cause EC injury, increased permeability, leukocyte infiltration, and increased
  levels of adhesion molecules, inflammatory cytokines, and ROS, leading to further
  increases in MMPs. Increased MMPs may cause VSM hyperpolarization and relaxation
  as well as ECM degradation, leading to vein wall dilation, valve dysfunction, and
  progressive increases in venous hydrostatic pressure (vicious cycle). Increased
  MMPs generally promote ECM degradation, particularly in atrophic regions. Other
  theories (indicated by dashed arrows) suggest a compensatory anti-inflammatory pathway
  involving prostaglandins and their receptors that leads to decreased MMPs and thereby
  ECM accumulation, particularly in hypertrophic regions of VVs. Persistent valve
  dysfunction and progressive vein wall dilation and tortuosity lead to different
  stages of CVD and CVI. Current therapies of CVD and CVI (presented in shaded arrows)
  include physical, pharmacological, and surgical approaches. Inhibitors of the activity
  or action of MMPs (also presented in shaded arrows) may provide potential tools
  for the management of CVD/CVI. 15d-PGJ2, 15-deoxy-delta-12,14-prostaglandin J2;

  dehydrogenase; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.
