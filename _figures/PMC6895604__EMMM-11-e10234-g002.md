caption: (A) Most senescence‐inducing triggers converge in the activation of the cell
  cycle inhibitor pathways p53/p21 and/or p16INK4a. These result in the inhibition
  of cyclin‐dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6, which prevents the phosphorylation
  of the retinoblastoma protein (RB), leading to the suppression of S‐phase genes
  and an ensuing stable cell cycle arrest. DNA‐damaging triggers activate the DNA
  damage response (DDR) pathway resulting in the activation of p53 and p21. Ageing
  and epigenetic derepression of the Ink4a/ARF locus also lead to the activation of
  cell cycle inhibitors p16 and p21. ROS lead to the activation of the MAPK signalling
  pathway and its downstream effector p38. The aberrant expression of oncogenes or
  the loss of tumour suppressors leads to p53 activation through the Ras‐Raf‐MEK‐ERK
  or AKT signalling pathways, and TGFβ, and important factor of the SASP, leads to
  p15, p21 and p27 upregulation via SMAD signalling. Other triggers such as developmental
  cues and polyploidy activate the AKT, SMAD and/or Ras‐Raf‐MEK‐ERK pathway for p21
  upregulation, while processes such as cell fusion signal through the DDR for p53
  activation. In response to damage and different types of stress high levels of p53
  with specific post‐translational modifications (such as acetylated K117 and E177)
  target DNMT3a, a suppressor of p21 and senescence, and trigger the apoptotic programme
  by upregulating PUMA and NOXA, which in turn activate the caspase cascade leading
  to cell death. (B) SASP implementation is orchestrated by the activation of the
  transcription factors NF‐κB and C/EBPβ through upstream signalling pathways. DNA‐damaging
  agents, ROS and OIS, generally activate the expression of SASP TFs via the AKT and/or
  the Ras‐Raf‐MEK‐ERK axis. In addition, DNA fragments are also known to trigger the
  activation of the cGAS/STING signalling, resulting in the activation of the IRF3
  TF and subsequent transcription of Type 1 IFN. OIS‐derived SASP is dynamic and can
  also be orchestrated by NOTCH signalling, a process that restrains the inflammatory
  secretion by inhibiting C/EBPβ at initial stages, and allows the activation of SASP‐related
  super enhancers through NF‐κB later on. Accumulating increased levels of TFs reinforce
  the senescent phenotype through autocrine and paracrine signalling. SASP‐derived
  inflammatory chemokines such as IL‐6 and IL‐8 promote epigenetic modifications reinforcing
  the cell cycle arrest through the JAK/STAT cascade, while IL‐1α stimulates the activity
  of NF‐κB and C/EBPβ promoting a positive feedback loop on the secretion of other
  cytokines. Finally, senescence promotes survival networks by the regulation anti‐apoptotic
  pathways. This includes PI3K‐AKT signalling, which can inhibit pro‐apoptotic BAD
  and FOXO1/3, and phosphorylate caspase‐9; anti‐apoptotic FOXO4, that is present
  in senescent cells and interacts with p53; and NF‐κB, that may also promote survival
  responses by transcriptional induction of anti‐apoptotic proteins of the Bcl‐2 family.
  ATM/ATR, ataxia‐telangiectasia mutated and Rad3‐related homologue; IFN, interferon;
  OIS, oncogene‐induced senescence; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SASP, senescence‐associated
  secretory phenotype; TFs, transcription factors; TS, tumour suppressor.
