caption: 7,12-Dimethylbenz [a] anthracene (DMBA) can cause breast cancer by inducing
  Ras mutations, which cause nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkB) potentiation via the Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK
  pathway. ICAM-1 and TWIST expression will be enhanced as a result of NFkB activation.
  TWIST is a transcription factor that inhibits the production of E-Cadherin. DMBA
  can also bind to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and promote the transcription of
  Slug, an inhibitor of E-Cadherin production. Lunasin extract suppresses Ras mutations,
  which contribute to the prevention of breast cancer progression. As a result, NFkB
  potentiation does not occur, resulting in a decrease in ICAM-1 expression, and an
  increase in E-Cadherin expression. Tamoxifen, on the other hand, can suppress Toll-like
  receptors (TLR)-4 and Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β). TLR-4 suppression
  may also prevent NFkB potentiation. Furthermore, TGF-β inhibition will disrupt the
  smad/Slug and smad/Snail pathways, resulting in inhibition of E-Cadherin production.
