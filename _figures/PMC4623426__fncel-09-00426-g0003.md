caption: Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathways and aging. Binding
  of TGFβ to the type II TGFβ receptor dimer (TGFβRII) triggers recruitment of type
  I receptor dimer (TGFβRI), generating the heterotetrameric TGFβ receptor capable
  of activating the intracellular signaling pathways for TGFβ action. The activation
  of this complex activates (a) the canonical TGFβ signaling, with the phosphorylation
  of Smads 2 and/or 3 dimers, which bind to Smad 4 and translocate into the nucleus
  to regulate gene transcription, together with the activation of (b) non-canonical
  TGFβ signaling, which includes activation of MAPKs (ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; and P38) and PI3K. Aging results
  in several changes on TGFβ signaling, including an increased production of TGFβ,
  as well as inhibition of the Smad pathway and activation of the phosphatase MAPK
  phosphatase (MKP-1).
