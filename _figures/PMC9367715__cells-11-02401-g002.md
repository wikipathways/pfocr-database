caption: Non-canonical pathway of NRF2 degradation. In the absence of specific interaction
  partners, NRF2 ubiquitination occurs through the CUL3 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex,
  which promotes its proteasomal degradation. In the presence of KEAP1 binding proteins
  that antagonize NRF2 binding, or in the presence of NRF2 interactors that compete
  for KEAP1 binding, NRF2 escapes from degradation, enters into the nucleus, forms
  heterodimers with members of the small Maf proteins, and activates the transcription
  of many cytoprotective genes.
