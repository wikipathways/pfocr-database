caption: 'The interplay between maternal clearance and zygotic genome activation during
  the MZT in Drosophila. (a) Model of maternal and zygotic gene expression dynamics
  over the MZT. Maternal mRNA stores are eliminated through the action of two RNA
  degradation pathways: an ‘early decay’ pathway driven by maternally contributed
  factors following egg activation, independent of zygotic transcription; and a ‘late
  decay’ pathway directed by zygotically expressed factors. Zygotic genome activation
  (ZGA) occurs gradually over the MZT, with early onset expression of about one hundred
  zygotic genes (minor ZGA) appearing several nuclear cycles (nc) before the subsequent
  widespread activation of the zygotic genome (major ZGA). (b) Maternally loaded RNAs
  and proteins translated from these RNAs (blue) regulate molecular events governing
  the MZT, including mitotic division-cycle dynamics, maternal mRNA turnover and zygotic
  genome activation. Products of zygotic transcription (red), in turn, contribute
  to division-cycle remodelling and maternal RNA destabilization.'
