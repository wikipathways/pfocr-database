caption: 'A. Cholangiocyte secretory functions. The most widely accepted model of
  ductal bile formation involves [] secretin activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling
  pathway, which then leads to [] activation of CFTR, causing extrusion of Cl−. This
  then stimulates the [] Cl−/HCO3− exchanger which secretes HCO3− and creates an osmotic
  gradient that leads to the [] passive movement of water across AQP1. More recently,
  an alternative hypothesis suggests that [] activation of CFTR leads to the release
  of ATP, which then phosphorylates IP3R on the endoplasmic reticulum. This causes
  the release of Cl− via the [] Ca2+-dependent Cl− channel, which creates a gradient
  leading to [] activation of the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger. Ca2+ is also transported via
  a [] Ca2+- and cAMP-independent Cl− channel. Finally, the apical membrane also contains
  [] K+ channels (SK2 and IK-1) and a [] Na+-HCO3− cotransporter (mice). On the basolateral
  domain, there are two types of K+ channels: [] SK2 and [] IK-1. There is also []
  a Na+/K− ATPase, [] a Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1), [] a Na+/K+/Cl− cotransporter, []
  a Na+/HCO3+ cotransporter (rats), [] a Na+-dependent Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (humans),
  and water channels, [] AQP1 and [] AQP4. Within the cell, [] carbonic anhydrase
  allows for the production of HCO3−. Abbreviations: ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  AQP, aquaporin; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator; IK-1, intermediate-conductance K+ channel; PKA, protein kinase
  A; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; SK2, small conductance K+ channel.B. Cholangiocyte absorptive
  functions. Cholangiocytes have a number of transporters that allow the absorption
  of a variety of molecules []. Glucose is absorbed through SGLT1, Na+ is absorbed
  through [] NHE2 and [] NHE3, glutamate is absorbed through a glumate transporter,
  bile acids are absorbed through [] ASBT and [] iBAT and [] water is absorbed through
  AQP1. On the basolateral membrane, [] glucose is transported via GLUT1, bile is
  transported via [] Ostα-Ostβ and [] t-ASBT, water is transported via [] AQP1 and
  [] AQP4. Lastly, the basolateral membrane contains a [] Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3).
  Abbreviations: ASBT, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter; AQP, aquaporin;
  BA, bile acids; GLUT, glucose transporter; GT, glutamate transporter; iBAT, ileal
  bile acid transporter; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; OST, organic solute transporter alpha;
  SGLT, Na+-Glucose cotransporter.'
