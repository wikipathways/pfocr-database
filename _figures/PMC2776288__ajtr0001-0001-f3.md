caption: Crosstalk between apoptosis and NF-κB signaling by IAP-antagonist. TNFα induces
  both apoptosis and NF-κB activation in cancer cells. TNFα induces extrinsic apoptosis
  via activation of caspase cascade that involves initiator Caspase-8 and effector
  Caspase-3. IAPs (XIAP, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2) are anti-apoptotic proteins that block
  caspase-mediated apoptosis. Paradoxically, TNFα still activates NF-κB and promotes
  cell survival that counteracts with apoptosis. The classical NF-κB pathway that
  is mediated by IKKs signalosome can be triggered either by TNFα via TRAF2 and RIP1,
  or alternatively, by TGFβ via TAB1 and TAK1. Multiple studies have established crosstalk
  between IAPs and proteins that mediate NF-κB signaling pathway (see text). Smac
  mimetics that function as IAP antagonists can modulate the interaction between IAP
  proteins and NF-κB signaling proteins, which leads to TNFα-triggered apoptosis primarily
  via an autocrine manner (see text). TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alpha; TGFβ, transforming
