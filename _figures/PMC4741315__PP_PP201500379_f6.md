caption: Gene, metabolite, and hormone interactome in SUN fruit. The size of the nodes
  represents the number of edges to that node. Blue edges represent significant positive
  correlations. Red edges represent significant negative correlations. Nodes represent
  genes, metabolites, or hormones that participate in the pathway indicated. Squares
  represent genes. Diamonds represent metabolites. Hormones are represented as circles.
  Cell pattern indicates transcription factors that regulate organ polarity and patterning.
  IQDs are members of the SUN family. Calcium indicates genes involved in calcium
  transport,  binding, and proteins requiring calcium for function. Lipid indicates
  genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and regulation. A, Full interactome network
  with bundled edges. B, Subnetwork of calcium hub. BR, Genes involved in brassinosteroid
  homeostasis; celldiv, genes involved in cell division; GRF GIF, genes in the GRF
  family and GIF; TCA, enzymes that participate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle; aa,
  amino acid; MAX4, more axillary branching; met, metabolite.
