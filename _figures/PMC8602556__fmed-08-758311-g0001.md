caption: Inflammatory/Cytokine signaling regulated by UPR. Upon ER stress, the ER
  chaperone BiP dissociates from its complex with IRE1, PERK and ATF6 which results
  in the activation of the three arms of the UPR pathway as shown in the figure. All
  the three arms of the UPR regulates the production of inflammatory cytokines via
  different mechanisms which converge on NF-κB activation. PERK also regulates TXNIP
  through the induction of ATF5 which in turn modulates NLRP3 inflammasome resulting
  in enhanced inflammation. Calcium disruption induced ER stress activates STING pathway
  resulting in the production of IFN-1.
