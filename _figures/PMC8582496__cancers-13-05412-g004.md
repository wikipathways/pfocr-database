caption: BMP9 effects beyond the endothelium. BMP9 can produce cellular effects in
  non-endothelial cells as numerous studies have shown in tumor cells or fibroblasts.
  (A) BMP9 enhances tumor cell survival in several cancer cell types due to the activation
  of the Smad1/5/8 pathway through ALK2 receptor (left panel). Apart from Smad1/5/8,
  other non-canonical pathways such as p38 are activated. In different tumoral cell
  lines, BMP9 induces an anti-proliferative effect by activating the Smad1/5 pathway
  through the ALK1 receptor (right panel). (B) BMP9 can induce responses in fibroblast-like
  cells, such as CAFs, in which BMP9 promotes Id1 expression through the ALK1-Smad1/5/8
  pathway (left panel). In MEFs, BMP9 induces a profibrotic program through both Smad1/5/8
  and Smad2/3 pathways (right panel). Created with BioRender.com, accessed on 17 October
