caption: 'Energetic metabolism of cardiomyocytes. FFAs (free fatty acids), the main
  energetic fuel, are converted into long-chain acyl-CoA esters by fatty acyl CoA
  synthetase, and then, into long-chain acylcarnitine by CPT1, the rate limiting enzyme
  of long-chain FAO. Inside the mitochondria, long-chain acylcarnitine is converted
  back to long-chain acyl-CoA by CPT2, and then, several isoforms of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase,
  enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, and 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase
  (specific for different chain lengths) mediate the shortening of the fatty acyl
  moiety, generating acetyl-CoA, FADH2, and NADH. Glc is transported by GLUTs (GLUT4
  in adult heart) into cardiomyocytes, and, in the cytosol, Glc is converted into
  pyruvate through glycolysis. Pyruvate may be oxidized in mitochondria or converted
  into lactate by LDH in the cytosol. Lactate uptake and secretion is mediated by
  MCTs (MCT4 in the adult heart). MCT1 makes part of the mtLOC, which is also composed
  of CD147, LDH, and COX. Lactate may be oxidized in the mitochondria by this complex.
  Ketones, mostly βOHB, may feed TCA after being metabolized by the enzymes β-hydroxybutyrate
  dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1, the enzyme that interconverts β-hydroxybutyrate into acetoacetate)
  and succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT, the rate-limiting enzyme of ketone
  oxidation). SCFAs (including acetate, propanoate, and butyrate) can cross the mitochondrial
  membrane by diffusion, and enter FAO through SCAD, after being activated via ACSMs.
  BCAA and other amino acids, such as Glu, may be used for energetic purposes by feeding
  the TCA cycle. BCATm and BCKDH catalyze the first two enzymatic steps in BCAA metabolism.
  The contribution of these metabolic pathways changes in the injured heart. In ischemia
  (Isc), the reliance on glucose and lactate increases, but when insulin signaling
  is repressed, FAO is upregulated. During heart failure (HF) glucose oxidation prevails
  until mitochondria functionality is impaired, which happens at advanced stages of
  disease. In diabetes mellitus (DM), glucose uptake and oxidation decrease, inducing
  a higher reliance of cardiac metabolism on lipids for energetic purposes. Abbreviations:
