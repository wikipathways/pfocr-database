caption: CAFs promoted the survival of irradiated NPC cells via the NF-κB pathway.
  Irradiation kills cancer cells via DNA damage. CAFs within TME promoted irradiated
  cancer cell survival by secretion of IL-8 to activate NF-κB signaling pathway, thus
  to enhance broken DNA repair and induced formation of radioresistance. Tranilast
  sensitized cancer cells to irradiation through the suppression of CAFs functionally,
  thus promoted irradiation-induced cell death
