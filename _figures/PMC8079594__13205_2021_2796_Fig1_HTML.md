caption: Effects of metabolites of probiotics on gut. Indole 3-propionic acid has
  the ability to bind to PXR thus upregulating the expression of tight junction protein.
  The indole-3-lactic acid activates AhRs of the gut epithelium and promotes the expression
  of IL-22. Isolated from LGG, the soluble proteins P40 and P75 can activate EGFR
  and subsequently control the expression of APRIL into the epithel and, therefore,
  stimulate cell secretion of lgA via B-cells. Besides, P40 and p75 maintain gut homeostasis
  by activating EGFR–PIK3–Akt signaling pathway to. Furthermore, these two proteins
  prevent tight junctional disruption of the pathways that rely on protein kinase-C.
  Butyrate can bind to the GPCR, like GPR41, GPR109A, and GPR43, and induce colonic
  epithel to produce IL-18. Butyrate also motivates gut epithelia O2 intakes to preserve
  HIF stability and to enhance the expression of HIF target genes that prevent barrier
  protective disease. Moreover, probiotic-based bacteriocins serve as colonizing peptides
  to enable producers to gain a competitive edge over other strains and to occupy
  niches in the intestines. Alternatively, bacteriocins has the ability to act as
  a killer peptide, which specifically prevents pathogen adhesion of the mucus layer
  and strengthens the first intestinal barrier (Liu et al. )
