caption: 'The signaling pathways involved in ESG development and regeneration. From
  left to right are the Wnt, EDA-A1, Shh, BMP, and ERK signaling pathways. Wnt signaling
  pathway (; ): in the absence of Wnt signals, GSK-3β/Axin/APC/β-catenin/CK1 is a
  destruction complex. GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin, thereby inhibiting its activity
  and then β-catenin is degraded by ubiquitination. When Wnt proteins bind to a receptor
  complex, it induces the association of Axin and Dvl with LRP5/6 and Frizzled. Dvl
  inhibits GSK-3β and the destruction complex falls apart, and thus prevents the degradation
  of β-catenin, permitting β-catenin accumulation, leading to binding TCF/LEF in the
  nucleus to upregulate target genes. EDA signaling pathway (; ): in the absence of
  EDA-A1 signals, NF-κB dimers (P50–P65) are bound to inhibitory IκB proteins, which
  sequester inactive NF-κB complexes in the cytoplasm. When EDA-A1 binds to EDAR,
  stimulation of EDAR leads to the binding of EDARADD, for IKK activation. Shh signaling
  pathway (; ): in the absence of Shh signals, Ptc inhibits the activity of Smo by
  affecting its localization to the cell surface, and protein kinases (PKA, CK1, and
  GSK3β) constitutively phosphorylate Gli proteins to inhibit the Gli. The secreted
  active Shh ligand binds to Ptc and relieves the repressive effect of the Ptc on
  Smo, activating the Smo, which then translocates to the cell membrane to inhibit
  PKA, CK1, and GSK3, providing an assembly platform for the recruitment of Kif7,
  Sufu and Gli, thus activating the Gli. Subsequently, the activated Gli forms (GliAs)
  translocate into the nucleus and activate Shh target genes. BMP signaling pathway
  (): when BMPs bind to BMPRs, intracellular Smad1 becomes phosphorylated. The phosphorylated
  Smad1 binds to Smad4 and then translocates into the nucleus and activates BMP target
  genes. ERK signaling pathway (; ): Phosphorylated RTK binds to GRB2, and GRB2 binds
  to SOS, which stimulates RAS. RAS initiates activation of the MEK-ERK cascade by
  converting a molecule from GDP to GTP.'
