caption: Mechanisms of the effect of neuroinvasion on immune tolerance in NSCLC NGF
  released from NSCLC cells induces neuronal cell differentiation and axonogenesis
  in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Owing to the innervation in the TME, nerve
  fibers release neurotransmitter 5-HT, which binds to the HTR1D receptor on the surface
  of NSCLC cells, activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, enhances the Warburg effect
  in NSCLC cells, and induces tumor immunosuppression. Relieving tumor metabolic reprogramming-induced
  immunosuppression can synergistically enhance the efficacy of PD-1 monotherapy
