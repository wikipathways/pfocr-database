caption: 'STAT3 influences cardiac fibrosis through multiple pathways. (1) The crosstalk
  between STAT3 and miR manifests in several ways: STAT3 can form either a direct
  feedback or an indirect feedback loop by binding with miR; it can also mediate the
  transcription of downstream miR; meanwhile, miR can influence the translation of
  STAT3 mRNA. (2) Positioned downstream of the TGF-β/SMAD signaling cascade, STAT3
  might collaboratively regulate myocardial fibrosis with TGF-β. Their synergistic
  action could potentially be associated with the phosphorylation of STAT3. (By Figdraw)'
