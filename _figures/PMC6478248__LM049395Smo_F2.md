caption: Feedback loops based on self-sustaining kinase activation or translation,
  hypothesized to play roles in maintaining persistent LTP and LTM. A stimulus (e.g.,
  tetani or theta-bursts) releases glutamate, leading to increased postsynaptic Ca2+
  via influx through NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Consequent depolarization leads to further
  Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC). Ca2+ binds to calmodulin
  (not shown) and activates, directly or indirectly, kinases and signaling pathways
  including CaMKII, the adenylyl cyclase–cAMP–PKA pathway, and the Raf–Mek–ERK pathway.
  Upstream processes in these pathways, such as Ras activation, are omitted for clarity.
  Local protein synthesis is also activated subsequent to Ca2+ influx. Hypothesized
  positive feedback loops are indicated by plus signs. Within CaMKII holoenzymes,
  phosphorylated CaMKII subunits may phosphorylate and activate new or inactive subunits,
  persistently maintaining holoenzyme activity. The translational activator CPEB can
  aggregate in a self-perpetuating but regulated manner, possibly enabling a positive
  feedback loop that sustains increased translation. PKMζ is hypothesized to up-regulate
  translation of its own mRNA, sustaining high PKMζ activity and forming another positive
  feedback loop. ERK has also been hypothesized to persistently up-regulate its own
  activity, via phosphorylation and activation of its upstream activator, MEK kinase
  (; ). Following stimulus-induced phosphorylation of AMPARs by PKA, AMPAR dephosphorylation
  may become saturated, allowing basal PKA activity to maintain elevated AMPAR phosphorylation
  (). The activities of these kinases, and increased protein synthesis, may all cooperate
  to potentiate and maintain synaptic strength.
