caption: Model for the regulation of LHCB expression by plastid signals. Multiple
  plastid signals, including that generated by defects in plastid protein import,
  converge at GUN1. Subsequently, the plastid signal generated by import defects acts
  through the suppression of GLK1 expression but not the activation of ABI4. Although
  plastid signals generated by norflurazon and lincomycin have been shown to act through
  the GUN1-ABI4 pathway, they may also act through the GUN1-GLK1 pathway.
