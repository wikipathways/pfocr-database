caption: Four regulatory mechanisms of MM-1 on c-Myc. a Rabring7 degrades c-Myc through
  complex formation with MM-1. b MM-1 and Egr1 cooperate in the transcriptional repression
  of Wnt4, which is one of the elements of the Wnt-b-catenin pathway that positively
  controls the c-Myc gene. c MM-1 binds the N-terminal region of c-Myc, and represses
  its transcriptional activity by recruiting the TIF1β co-repressor and the histone
  deacetylase HDAC1–mSin3 complex. d Inhibition of c-Myc activity by MM-1 can be lost
  due to the missense mutation of amino acid 157 from alanine to arginine (A157R)
