caption: MicroRNA (miR)‐302/367 family participates in networks that regulate cancer
  hallmarks. Most members of the miR‐302/367 cluster inhibit the proliferation of
  tumor cells, but some contrary conclusions have been reached. The AKT signaling
  pathway plays an important role in regulating cell stemness and proliferation. In
  addition to stemness, cytostasis, and differentiation circuits, P21 and cyclin D
  (CCND) are involved in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation. Cancer cells
  show the classic hallmarks, including activation of invasion and metastasis, evasion
  of cell death and senescence, angiogenesis, the evasion of growth suppression and
  protumorigenic inflammation, as well as additional properties, such as chemotherapy/radiochemotherapy
  resistance. Some molecules, such as metadherin‐2 (MTDH2), nuclear receptor subfamily
  2 group F member 2 (NR2F2), large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2), and Yes‐associated
  transcriptional regulator (YAP), contribute to multiple signaling interactions.
  Dual contributions are orchestrated and maintained by multiple signaling interactions,
  of which only a subset is illustrated. ATRA, All‐trans retinoic acid; BCRP, ATP
  binding cassette subfamily G member 2; CCND, cyclin D; CDK, cyclin‐dependent kinase;
  CXCR4, C‐X‐C chemokine receptor type 4; DCUN1D1, cullin neddylation 1 domain containing
  1; E2F3, E2 transcription factor 3; EGFR, epidermal growth factor recptor; ER, estrogen
  receptor; ErbB4, Receptor tyrosine‐protein kinase erbB‐4; GSK‐3β, glycogen synthase
