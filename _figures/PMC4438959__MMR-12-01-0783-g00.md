caption: Signaling pathway regulation of the differentiations of adipocytes and osteoblasts.
  Adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from a common MSC pool. The balance of adipocyte
  and osteoblast differentiation requires communication between extracellular stimuli,
  as well as a coordinated network of receptors and transcription factors in the nucleus,
  including the RANKL/RANK/OPG and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, along with PPARγ.
  Disordered lipid metabolism disorder may result in an increase in oxidized lipids.
  Oxidized lipids promote the differentiation of adipocytes and inhibit that of osteoblasts,
  by activating PPARγ. The sFRP-1 binds to the Wnt receptor and blocks the Wnt signaling
  pathway, thereby inhibiting osteoblast differentiation and promoting adipocyte differentiation.
  The low-activity Wnt signaling pathway in BMSCs enhances adipocyte differentiation
  by upregulating C/EBPα and PPARγ, whereas it suppresses osteoblast differentiation
  by downregulating Runx2 expression. Furthermore, low activity of the Wnt signaling
  pathway in osteoblasts down-regulates the expression of OPG, which leads to the
  enhancement of bone resorption by enforcing RANKL-induced osteoclastic differentiation
  based on the RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway. These changes ultimately increase bone fat
  deposition and promote the development of osteoporosis. MSC, mesenchymal stem cell;
  RANKL, receptor activator for nuclear factor κB ligand; OPG, osteoprotegerin, BMSC,
  bone marrow stromal cell; C/EBPα, CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins α; PPARγ, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ; sFRP-1, secreted frizzled-related protein 1;
  Runx2, runt-related protein 2.
