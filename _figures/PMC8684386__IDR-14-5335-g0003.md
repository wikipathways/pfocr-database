caption: Regulation of LAT expression and function of LAT. (A–C) highlight the pathways
  that promote the transcriptional expression of LATs. 1–5 shows the five functional
  mechanisms of LAT latency. 1. LAT miR-H2 can inhibit ICP0 protein so that viral
  DNA cannot be synthesized, causing the silencing of the lysed gene and HSV latency.
  LAT miRNA-H6 inhibit the expression of ICP4 and lysed genes. LAT miRNA blocks ICP0/ICP34.5
  production and reduces viral DNA synthesis, which in turn inhibits the expression
  of the lysed gene and renders the virus latent. LAT miRNA can also achieve viral
  latency by targeting transformed growth factor (TGF)-β and SMAD3 in the TGF-β pathway
  to resist apoptosis. 2. LAT sRNA1 and sRNA2 can inhibit ICP0 mRNA expression by
  partial base complementation to maintain latency. LAT sRNA2 can also inhibit the
  expression of ICP4 and lysed genes to help establish and maintain virus latency.
  3. LAT lncRNA can induce facultative heterochromatin to promote lytic gene silencing
  during latency. 4. LAT sncRNA collaborates with RIG-I to stimulate NF-kB dependent
  transcription for anti-apoptosis and latency. 5. LAT ORFs inhibit ICP4 and then
  down-regulates lysed genes to make the virus latent. At the same time, LAT ORFs
  inhibit caspase 8 or caspase 9 for anti-apoptosis and latency.
