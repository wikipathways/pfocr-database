caption: Overview of Wnt signaling pathway. (a) Illustration of OFF status of canonical
  Wnt pathway. Without Wnt ligands, β-catenin is phosphorylated by β-catenin destruction
  complex (dashed box). The phosphorylated β-catenin is further degraded through ubiquitination
  by proteasome. The target genes of Wnt pathway are inhibited. (b) Illustration of
  ON status canonical Wnt pathway. The binding of Wnt ligands to Frizzled family receptors
  disrupts the β-catenin destruction complex. Dephosphorylated β-catenin accumulates
  in the cytoplasm, which is further translocated into nucleus. The β-catenin interacts
  with TCF/Lef1 triggering Wnt target genes expression. (c) Illustration of non-canonical
  Wnt-PCP pathway. After Wnts bind to Frizzled receptors and co-receptors, Vangl interacts
  with Disheveled (Dsh). Dsh forms complex with Rac1 and mediates JNK-c-Jun pathway
  to regulate cell polarity. Dsh also activates G protein Rho, which further activates
  ROCK to regulate actin. (A color version of this figure is available in the online
  journal.)
