caption: TCS connectors can promote activation of response regulators and sensor kinases.
  (A) The connector-mediated pathway from S. enterica. The low Mg2+ signal activates
  the PhoP/PhoQ TCS, which triggers the expression of the connector PmrD. PmrD binds
  to the phosphorylated form of the response regulator PmrA, thereby protecting it
  from dephosphorylation. PmrA-P binds to DNA and regulates its target promoters.
  PmrA-P represses transcription of the pmrD gene, thus establishing a negative feedback
  loop controlling PmrD expression. The PmrA/PmrB TCS can be activated directly by
  the Fe3+ signal. (B) The B1500 protein from E. coli connects the EvgA/EvgS and PhoP/PhoQ
  TCSs. In response to an unknown signal, the EvgA/EvgS system triggers the expression
  of B1500, which interacts with the sensor kinase PhoQ, thereby promoting activation
  of PhoP and resulting in transcription of PhoP-activated genes.
