caption: (A) In chordates, echinoderms, platyhelminths, and possibly other phyla,
  apoptotic conditions engage the members of the Bcl-2 family, which either promote
  (green) or inhibit (red) MOMP in response to activation of BH3-only proteins. MOMP
  results in the release of cytochrome c (cyt c) and other proteins of the intermembrane
  space. Cytochrome c binds to APAF1, which oligomerizes to create the apoptosome
  that in turn binds to and activates an initiator caspase. The initiator caspase
  cleaves and thereby activates executioner caspases. Both the initiator and executioner
  caspases are inhibited by an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP). MOMP releases
  antagonists of the IAP (IAPi), permitting the executioner caspases to orchestrate
  apoptosis. Asterisks (*) refer to active caspases. (B) In nematodes, the anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 protein sequesters the APAF1 homolog. Apoptotic conditions induce expression
  of BH3-only proteins, which bind to the Bcl-2 protein, releasing the APAF1 homolog
  to form an apoptosome. This binds and thereby activates the caspase to promote apoptosis.
  (C) In Drosophila, the APAF1 homolog appears to spontaneously form an apoptosome,
  but the initiator caspase is inhibited by an IAP. Apoptotic conditions promote expression
  of IAPi, permitting the apoptosome to now activate the initiator caspase, which
  in turn cleaves and thereby activates executioner caspases, promoting apoptosis.
  Note that MOMP, upstream of caspase activation, occurs only in the pathway shown
  in (A).
