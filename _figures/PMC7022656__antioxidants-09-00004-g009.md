caption: Cross-talks between distinct signaling pathways activated within different
  ER-to-nuclear responsive networks to the classic ER stressor TU. (A) There exist
  multiple cross-talks from the TU-induced stress signaling to different ER-to-nuclear
  responses. Inhibition of Nrf1 N-glycosylation by TU leads to subsequent blockage
  of its deglycosylation and even proteolytic processing to yield a mature CNC-bZIP
  factor, before transactivating transcriptional expression of the proteasomal (PSM)
  genes. On the contrary, disruption of Nrf1-mediated proteasomal degradation (e.g.,
  ERAD) leads to aberrant accumulation of oxidized, damaged and misfolded proteins,
  in addition to other TU-led, non-glycosylated and unfolded proteins. These, together,
  result in classic ER stress along with redox stress. Of note, distinct and even
  opposing roles of Nrf1 and Nrf2, as well as both inter-regulatory effects on cytoprotection
  against ER redox stress, are integrally unified in different cellular signaling
  responses within distinct gene-regulatory networks. (B) Our evidence demonstrates
  that Nrf1 acts as a dominant regulator of most of UPR-target genes, apart from its
  negative regulation of Nrf2. By contrast, Nrf2, besides being a direct substrate
  of PERK, is also involved in this response to TU, partially by the IRE1 signaling
  pathway, but not by its downstream XBP1. Although Nrf2 governs the transcriptional
  expression of Nrf1 and some co-target antioxidant genes, it also contributes to
  the negative regulation of ATF4, that is selectively translated by the eIF2α-based
  initiation machinery. Furthermore, Nrf1 is similar to ATF4, in that it is here predicted
  that both contain an upstream open reading frame (uORF) within their full-length
  mRNA transcripts. Thereby, it is inferable that the TU-induced ER stress might confer
  it to be translated into an N-terminally-truncated Nrf1 protein (i.e., Nrf1ΔN) that
  lacks the ER-targeting peptide and its adjacent N-terminal region, so that it freely
  translocates the nucleus to regulate cognate target genes. Notably, activated or
  blocked nodes in the signalling cascades are denoted by arrows (→) or bars (⊥),
  respectively. Some up-regulated (↑) or down-regulated (↓) nodes are also indicated,
  whereas complete abolishment is represented by red crosses (✕). In addition, the
  open questions (?) arising from this study remain to be solved.
