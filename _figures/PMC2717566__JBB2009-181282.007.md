caption: Proposed model of  p,p′-DDE-induced signaling pathways leading to apoptosis.
  ROS generation might play a critical role in the initiation of p,p′-DDE-induced
  apoptosis of Sertoli cells through two mechanisms, one was the mitochondria-mediated
  pathway including elevation of ROS, decrease in ΔΨm along with the cytochrome c
  release from mitochondria into the cytosol, and activation of the caspase-9 and
  -3 in our previous study; and the other was the elevation of ROS, which resulted
  in activation of NF-κB, expression of FasL and triggered FasL-dependent pathway
  (FasL/caspase-8/-3 signaling module) in our present study.
