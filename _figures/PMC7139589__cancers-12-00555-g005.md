caption: 'In cells where exit from the cell cycle is induced by serum starvation or
  high cell density, APC is mainly expressed in the cytoplasm. APC accumulates in
  the nucleus in cells with high Ki-67 expression. APC is known to translocate from
  the cytoplasm into the nucleus in cells with an increased degree of differentiation
  [,]. Nuclear accumulation of APC also occurs simultaneously with high Vimentin expression
  and destruction of the E-cadherin complex. A: Epithelial cells with a lower cell
  proliferation rate. B: Epithelial cells with a higher proliferation rate.'
