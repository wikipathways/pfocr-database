caption: 'Proposed mechanism of Shh contribution to the development of arteriovenous
  malformations in the brain.In the presence of a genetically or anatomically favorable
  background, inciting events, such as inflammation, ischemia, hypoxia, or traumatic
  and toxic injuries, may lead to the upregulation of Shh in a specific brain area,
  with the activation of the Gli1-dependent canonical pathway, which leads to the
  upregulation of the VEGF/Notch signaling. Shh upregulation also leads to the activation
  of COUP-TFII via a non-canonical pathway. The effect of the concomitant activation
  of Notch and COUP-TFII is the generation of a brain arteriovenous malformation.
  VEGF: Vascular endothelial growth factor; Shh: Sonic hedgehog.'
