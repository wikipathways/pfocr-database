caption: Nano-drug delivery systems and antibody drugs involved caveolin-1-mediated
  pathways in endothelial cells and tumor cells. (A) Albumin-related nano-drugs pass
  through adjacent endothelial cells by transcytosis to increase tumor accumulation;
  (B) Examples of antibody drugs and nano-based drug delivery systems for caveolin-mediated
  endocytosis to increase antitumor effects. Anti-tumor drugs or certain siRNA or
  DNA could be encapsulated in specific nanocarriers to enter tumor cells through
  caveolin-mediated pathways and arrive in ER or Golgi complex and bypass lysosomal
  degradation during intracellular trafficking. (C) Intracellular biofate of some
  nano-drugs in caveolin-mediated pathway; (D) Functional polymeric nanoparticles
  (PBEAGA-CPT) possess rapid extravasation on endothelial cells and rapid transcytosis
  in tumor cells to achieve deep penetration in tumor cells.
