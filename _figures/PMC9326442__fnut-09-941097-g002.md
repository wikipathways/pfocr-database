caption: Gut dysfunction and its impact on catabolism. Gut dysfunction contributes
  to a hypercatabolic state in many ways. Gut hypoperfusion and increased epithelial
  apoptosis contribute to the intestinal barrier impairment, which is common in critically
  ill patients, leading to the increase in gut permeability and further hindering
  nutrient absorption from the small intestine. Alterations in intestinal microbiota
  such as Escherichia coli decrease protein synthesis through the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. Changes in microbiota-derived metabolites such as SCFAs also lead to the
  development of hypercatabolism by inducing insulin resistance and lipolysis. Together,
  these alterations contribute to the hypercatabolic status in patients with PICS.
  IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; SCFAs, short-chain
  fatty acids; PICS, persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome.
