caption: Proposed pathogenic mechanism associated with SERCA2 dysfunction. (1) ATP2A2
  variants impair the function of the SERCA2b pump, a protein responsible for transporting
  calcium ions into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This leads to disrupted intracellular
  calcium homeostasis. (2) The decrease in calcium reserves within the ER compromises
  essential cellular processes, particularly protein folding. As a result, misfolded
  proteins accumulate in the ER, triggering a protective cellular mechanism known
  as the unfolded protein response (UPR). (3) The UPR involves the upregulation of
  molecular chaperones, including CHOP, GRP78, calreticulin, and BiP, which attempt
  to refold or degrade the misfolded proteins and restore normal ER function. (4)
  Although cells attempt to compensate by enhancing calcium influx through channels
  such as TRPC1, and by transporting calcium into the Golgi apparatus via SPCA1 pumps,
  these mechanisms are insufficient to fully restore calcium homeostasis. If ER stress
  becomes prolonged or severe, it activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, through
  the deregulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which play
  a key role in suppressing cell death under physiological conditions. (5) The altered
  calcium homeostasis and ER stress also has a profound impact on keratinocyte adhesion.
  This results in the disruption of cell–cell junctions (desmosomes) and a consequent
  loss of cohesion among epidermal cells (acantholysis), a hallmark feature of Darier’s
  Disease
