caption: 'Potential pathway leading to phagocytosis of senescent AD-MSCs. Molecular
  analysis showed that during a long-term culture of AD-MSCs activation of genes involved
  in immune response was observed, which in consequence leads to phagocytosis of senescent
  cells. Overexpressed genes are marked in red.AD-MSC: adipose-derived mesenchymal
  stromal/stem cell.'
