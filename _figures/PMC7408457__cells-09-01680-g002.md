caption: 'Change in the profile of proteins and mRNAs of molecular factors in the
  primary tumor of the kidney and its metastatic sites. Note: Arrows indicate changes
  in the studied factors. We found a decrease in HIF-1, CAIX, PTEN, phospho-AKT content
  and RNA levels of VEGFR2 and m-TOR in metastases compared to the primary tumors.
  NF-κB p50, NF-κB p65, HIF-2, VEGF VEGFR2 and m-TOR protein contents and HIF-1, CAIX,
  PTEN and PDK RNA levels were enhanced in secondary cancer lesions. Indicators with
  change in opposite direction are highlighted in bold. Proteins level and mRNA alterations
  show the specific trend in biological features of primary tumors and metastases.
  Despite the reduction in mRNA levels of VEGFR2 and m-TOR, the protein contents of
  these molecular factors increased. The HIF-1 and PTEN protein levels showed the
  opposite trend. The kidney cancer aggressiveness is associated with the overactivation
  of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and excess of tyrosine kinase receptors.'
