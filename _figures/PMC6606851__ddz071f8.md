caption: Pathway activity measured with luciferase reporters for canonical signaling
  (STF). (A) Wild-type WNT5A plasmid significantly inhibits endogenous canonical WNT
  signaling; however, WNT5AC83S is a less effective antagonist (a). (B) The wtWNT5A
  and variant plasmid were able to equally antagonize STF activity induced by LiCl
  (b). (C) WNT3A protein is a strong activator of canonical signaling via Frizzled-LRP
  dimers and this activity is significantly reduced by wtWNT5A but not by WNT5AC83S
  (bars with dashed outline; c). The addition of Ror2-expressing plasmid alone did
  change STF activity (bar 3). However, when Ror2 was added with WNT3A, the activation
  was greatly reduced, presumably facilitated by binding of endogenous WNT ligands
  (bar 4, c’). The addition of mutant DNA in combination with Ror2 and WNT3A significantly
  inhibited activity (bar 10, c’). Thus, WNT5AC83S may become a more potent inhibitor
  of canonical signaling when there is an excess of Ror2 receptors (c’). One-way ANOVA
  post hoc test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. APC, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli;
  DVL, Dishevelled; FZD, Frizzled receptor; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3 β; LEF/TCF,
