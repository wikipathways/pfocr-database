caption: 'Schematic representation of C. glutamicum cell factory with the metabolic
  connection between the utilization of brown seaweed-derived carbohydrates and the
  riboflavin biosynthetic pathway. Pathways: The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is
  depicted with a red-shadowed shape; the purine pathway (PP) is depicted with a green-shadowed
  shape; and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is depicted with a purple shadowed shape.
  Enzymes: Endogenous enzymatic steps are depicted in yellow boxes. G-PTS, glucose-specific
  PTS coded by ptsG; GCDBP, GTP cyclohydrolase II/3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphatesynthase
  coded by ribA; RDR, bifunctional riboflavin-specific deaminase/reductase coded by
  ribG; RSC, riboflavin synthase beta chain coded by ribH; and RS, riboflavin synthase
  by ribC. Enzymatic steps implemented in C. glutamicum are depicted in blue boxes.
  M-PTS, mannitol-specific PTS coded by mtlA or mtlAF; MtlD, mannitol-1-phosphate-5-dehydrogenase
  coded by mtlD. Pretreatment of laminarin with commercial enzymes containing cellulases,
  ß-glucosidases, and hemicellulose (CGH) is depicted in grey box. Metabolites: M1P,
  mannitol 1-phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphase; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; Ribu5P,
  ribulose 5-phosphate; and GTP, Guanosine 5-triphosphate.'
