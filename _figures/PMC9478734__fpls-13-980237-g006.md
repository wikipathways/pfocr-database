caption: Scheme of plastid retrograde signaling (PGE) in a plant/algal cell. Components
  are considered to be involved in 1O2-mediated induction of either Arabidopsis thaliana
  (At, black) or Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr, Red) genes. 1O2 accumulates during
  exposure to excess light and activates distinct signaling pathways. The 1O2 accumulated
  in the plastid is sensed and/or transmitted to the nucleus via the concerted action
  of two chloroplast proteins, EXECUTER 1 and EXECUTER 2 (EX1 and EX2). In the cytosol/nucleus,
  the blue-light photoreceptor CRY1 is involved in 1O2-mediated stress responses,
  but PRL may act as a general negative regulator of 1O2signaling. One product of
  the 1O2 -caused oxidation of carotenoids, β-cyclocitral (β-CC), may act as a second
  messenger involved in the 1O2signaling pathway in plants. A second stress response
  involves the induction of methylerythritolcyclo diphosphate (MEcPP) and phosphoadenosine
  phosphate (PAP), two important metabolites that participate in retrograde signaling
  through chromatin remodeling and changes in nuclear gene expression. Full arrows
  indicate activation or conversion, and dashed arrows indicate diffusion or transport
  of molecules. Furthermore, distinct plastid processes [redox change, plastid gene
  repression by Lincomycin (Lin), Norflurazon (NF), and Protein Import Defect (PID)]
  generate plastid signals. These signals converge at GUN1 within the plastid. Subsequently,
  the signal is sent to two transcription factors, ABI4 and GLK1. GUN1 activates ABI4,
  a negative regulator of LHCB expression and also down-regulates the expression of
  GLK1, leading to a subsequent decrease in LHCB expression.
