caption: 'Summary of the main cells and inflammatory cytokines involved in developing
  psoriasis and the role of gene polymorphisms in biopharmaceuticals. Combination
  of genetic, immunological and environmental factors (such as stress, trauma, medications
  and microorganism infections, among others) lead to activation of plasmacytoid dendritic
  cells, keratinocytes, natural killer cells and macrophages that secrete cytokines
  (IFN-β and IFN-γ, IL1B, TNF). Activated dendritic cells promote the production of
  IL-12 and IL-23, which regulate the differentiation and proliferation of helper
  T lymphocytes (Th1, Th17 and Th22), which produce more cytokines (TNF, IFN-γ, IL22,
  IL-17). This inflammatory cascade produces a hyperproliferation of keratinocytes
  in the epidermis and in the vascular endothelium, giving rise to epidermal hyperplasia
  and psoriasis development. Targeted therapy with monoclonal antibodies inhibits
  different cytokines of this pathway (TNF, IL12/23, IL17, IL23), preventing the development
  of the inflammatory cascade and subsequently epidermal hyperplasia, typical of psoriasis.
  Genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding these
  cytokines, receptors or proteins involved in this mechanism, can be associated with
  response or toxicity to treatment with biologic therapies. Plasmacytoid DC: plasmacytoid
  dendritic cells; NK cells: natural killer T cells; Myeloid DC: myeloid dendritic
  cells; Th: T helper lymphocytes; IFN: interferon; IL: interleukin; TNF: tumor necrosis
  factor; Anti-TNF: TNF inhibitor drugs; Anti-IL drugs: cytokine inhibitor drugs.'
