caption: Illustrates the TCA cycle, MVA Pathway and downstream of saponins synthesis
  metabolic pathway. Acetyl-CoA serves as a precursor, part of it enters the TCA cycle
  to synthesize citrate acid, cis-aconitate acid, isocitrate, fumarate acid, malate
  acid and other substances to produce ATP. Some of these substances are directed
  into the MVA pathway to generate mevalonate, IPP and 2,3-Oxidosqualene. 2,3-Oxidosqualene
  entered the saponin synthesis pathway, and further synthesized ginsenoside Rg1,
  ginsenoside Rf, ginsenoside Rg3, ginsenoside Rd and ginsenoside Rb1. The red box
  highlights precursor substances, the yellow box denotes TCA cycle, the blue box
  represents MVA pathway, and the green box indicates downstream pathway of saponin
  synthesis. The red font identifies the detected metabolites in the callus of P.
  notoginseng anther, while the black font denotes the undetected metabolites in the
  callus of P. notoginseng anther
