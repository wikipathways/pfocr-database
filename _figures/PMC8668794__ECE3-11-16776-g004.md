caption: Schematic representation of one‐carbon metabolism pathway. Five genes encoding
  important enzymes in this pathway are differentially expressed in response to OA
  exposure. The genes highlighted in red and blue are up‐ and downregulated, respectively.
  Both of these genes are differentially expressed in A. clausi and E. nordmanni.
