caption: Pathway of TGFβ2-TLR4 crosstalk within the glaucomatous TM. TLR4 is activated
  by endogenous ligands called DAMPs and signals through the MyD88/NF-κB signaling
  pathway to augment TGFβ2 signaling. The increased TGFβ2 signaling leads to an elevation
  in DAMP and ECM production to further activate TLR4 and downregulate BAMBI. This
  feed-forward loop and inhibition of BAMBI induced by the crosstalk between TGFβ2-TLR4
  signaling causes progressive fibrosis within the TM. BAMBI, BMP, and activin membrane
  bound inhibitor; DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; ECM, extracellular
  matrix; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B.
