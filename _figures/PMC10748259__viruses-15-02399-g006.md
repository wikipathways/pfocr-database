caption: Molecular mechanisms leading to the detection of viral genome. The detection
  of RNA or DNA from viral origin is dependent on several pathways acting in concert
  to establish a rapid and efficient antiviral response. These include the activation
  of RIG-I-like (RLR) receptors and Toll-like (TLR) receptors, but also of the inflammasome
  via NLRP3. In addition, cytosolic viral DNA or released DNA resulting from mitochondrial
  damage leads to detection through the cGAS/STING pathway. All these warning signals
  are integrated and lead to the activation of transcription factors common to these
  detection pathways, namely IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB. These transcription factors interact
  with their promoters to enable the expression of type I and III interferons, on
  the one hand, and proinflammatory cytokines on the other
