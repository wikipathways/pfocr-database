caption: A schematic representation of reactions induced by IL-10. The signaling pathway
  map depicts molecules involved in protein-protein interactions, catalysis, activation/inhibition
  and translocation events induced upon treatment with IL-10 cytokine. Information
  regarding site and residue of post-translational modification is also shown in the
  pathway. Pathway legend is provided to identify the interactions, molecular associations
  and gene regulations on the map
