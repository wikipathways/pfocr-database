caption: Diagram of the acquired immunosuppression in hypoxic TME. In the hypoxic
  TME, HIF-1 directly activates RORγt gene transcription in T cells, and then recruits
  P300 to the RORγt transcription complex to act as the promoter of the TH17 gene
  (IL-17). These activities promote TH17 differentiation. At the same time, HIF-1
  attenuates T(reg) development by binding Foxp3 and targeting T(reg) for proteasomal
  degradation. Besides, tumor hypoxia induces CCL28, CXCL12, CXCR4 expression, enhancing
  T(reg) cell recruitment. VEGF-A is a major factor in differential secretion of depleted
  CD8+T cells under hypoxia, which can promote the differentiation of PD-1+TIM-3+CXCR5+
  terminally depleted CD8+T cells. In addition, hypoxia up-regulates the expression
  of CD137 and CD25, which secretes immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, eventually inducing
  adverse T cell phenotype. MiR-24 upregulates in tumor cells and TIL, and inhibits
  MYC and FGF11 in CD8(+)T cell. Through the destruction of MFN1-mediated mitochondrial
  fusion, the generation of intolerable ROS levels, causing T cell exhaustion. Further,
  hypoxic TME up-regulates the expression of CD39 and CD73, which negatively affect
  T cell activation through adenosine signaling pathway.
