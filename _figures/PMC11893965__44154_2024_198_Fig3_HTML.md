caption: 'Schematic representation illustrating the interplay between the UV-B radiation
  and responses among ethylene (ET), nitric oxide (NO), and biologically active polyamines
  (PAs). (1–2) Plants perceive UV-B radiation through a specialized photoreceptor,
  Ultraviolet resistance locus 8 (UVR8), which undergoes monomerization. (3) The UVR8
  monomer interacts with CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), a ubiquitin ligase
  (3), and hinders its ability to poly-ubiquitinate the transcription factor ELONGATED
  HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). (4) As a result, HY5 is spared from degradation, and its levels
  increase. (5) Together, UVR8 and COP1 orchestrate UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis
  and stress acclimation in plants by stomatal closure, UV-B induced gene expression
  (for flavonoid, anthocyanin, and polyamine synthesis. (6) When exposed to UV-B,
  UVR8 triggers the generation of molecules like ABA, NO and ET. (7) ABA is internalized
  in guard cell cytoplasm through an ABA importer. (8–9) ABA causes reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) generation and ROS/H2O2-induced NO synthesis through NR/NOS-like enzymes.
  (11, 11a-12) Increased ROS concentrations result in the opening of Ca2+ channel
  (10) and cytosolic Ca2+ dependent accumulation, leading to activation of CPK and
  independent pathway regulating Open Stomata 1 (OST1) cascade downstream. (13) Activated
  OST1 also induces membrane-bound NADPH oxidase to further contribute to the ROS
  pool. (14–15) Activated OST1 and cytosolically synthesized NO cause activation of
  anion channels and inhibition of cation (K+) channels leading to stomatal closure
  which limits water loss and prevents cell damage. (16) The UV-B radiation also causes
  ET synthesis through the UVR8 signaling module. (17, 9) Synthesized ET follows the
  ET signaling pathway and triggers the synthesis of H₂O₂ through polyamine oxidase
  (PAOs) which then induces the generation of another signaling molecule, NO via activation
  of nitrate reductase/ nitric oxide synthase-like (NR/NOSl) enzyme. Chs: Chalcone
