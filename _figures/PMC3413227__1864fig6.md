caption: 'The proposed mechanism of action of MDH1 acetylation during adipogenic differentiation.
  1: Glucose enters the glycolytic pathway to generate pyruvate. Pyruvate is converted
  to acetyl-CoA in mitochondria. 2: The citrate is transported to the cytoplasm by
  the citrate shuttle. 3: The cytoplasmic citrate disintegrates into acetyl-CoA and
  oxaloacetate in the cytoplasm. This reaction provides the cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA
  used for fatty acid synthesis. Cytoplasmic oxaloacetate is converted to malate by
  MDH1, and the malate then rejoins the glycolytic pathway in a pyruvate form. The
  citrate shuttle produces two NADPH molecules per cycle. 4: The acetylation of MDH1
  increases its enzymatic activity. 5: Activated MDH1 promotes the citrate shuttle
  that provides acetyl-CoA and NADPH for fatty acid synthesis. It is suggested that
  the acetylation of MDH1 occurs only when the cytoplasmic level of acetyl-CoA is
  increased above a certain level as a result of exposure to an excess energy source.
  Therefore, the acetylation of MDH1 functions as the cross-talk mechanism between
  the intracellular energy level and adipogenesis.'
