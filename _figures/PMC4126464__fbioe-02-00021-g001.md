caption: Terpenoid biosynthesis via the 2-C-methyl-l-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)
  pathway. The MEP terpenoid biosynthetic pathway converts pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (GAP) feedstock to the C5 isomers, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), and dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate (DMAPP). The stepwise addition of IPP to DMAPP generates C10 geranyl
  pyrophosphate (GPP) and C15 farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), the respective precursors
  to monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. In this study, the heterologous expression of
  the M. spicata l-limonene synthase (MsLS) and A. grandis (E)-α-bisabolene synthase
  (AgBIS) in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was designed to draw on GPP and FPP pools,
  respectively, generated by the native cyanobacterial MEP pathway for the production
  of the non-native terpenoids l-limonene and α-bisabolene.
