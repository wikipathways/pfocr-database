caption: Interconnected processes of (i) S1P synthesis and degradation within the
  sphingomyelin/salvage pathway, (ii) S1P export and (iii) signaling through binding
  to five specific G-protein-coupled receptors, S1PR1-5. S1P can function as an autocrine,
  intracrine, paracrine, or endocrine bioactive mediator. Both osteoblasts and osteoclasts
  are among the cells which are able to produce, secrete, and respond to S1P.S1P,
  sphingosine 1-phosphate; S1PR, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor; SPHK, sphingosine
  kinase; SPP, sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase; LPP, lipid phosphate phosphatase;
  SPL,sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase; SPNS2, spinster homolog 2; HDL, high-density
  lipoprotein; PLC, phospholipase C; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Ras, rat sarcoma;
  Rho, ras homolog; ERK,extracellular-signal regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
