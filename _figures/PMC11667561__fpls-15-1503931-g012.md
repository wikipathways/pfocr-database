caption: Illustrates different hormone combinations affect TCA cycle, MVA pathway
  and saponin synthesis pathway in P. notoginseng anther callus through PnARF-3 and
  PnCRF-3. Different hormone combinations affect the expression levels of PnARF-3
  and PnCRF-3 in the callus, and overexpression of PnARF-3 and PnCRF-3 leads to a
  reduction in the entry of Acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle. This results in decreased
  ATP synthesis and a slower growth rate. Concurrently, more Acetyl-CoA is directed
  into the MVA pathway, which promotes the synthesis of IPP and enhances saponin accumulation.
  In the figure, the blue box represents the TCA cycle, while the red box highlights
  the MVA pathway and saponin synthesis pathway
