caption: The Hippo pathway’s upstream serine-threonine kinase cascade regulates YAP/TAZ.
  MST1/2 and MAP4K families are the main kinases of the Hippo- kinases cascade. When
  they are phosphorylated, which subsequently inhibits the transcriptional activity
  of YAP () and TAZ () through phosphorylating LAST1/2 (–). On the contrary, when
  the Hippo-kinase cascade is “inactive”, it leads to YAP dephosphorylation, which
  translocates to the nucleus and binds to TEAD1–TEAD4, following with the transcription
  of downstream genes (–). Such as multiple anti-apoptotic and proliferative genes,
  including CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) and CYR61 (cysteine-rich angiogenic
  factor) (–). Other molecules regulating YAP/TAZ phosphorylation have also been reported
  in the literature, such as NDR1/2 (Nuclear Dbf2-related 1/2) (), SRC (–), NLK (Nemo-like
  kinase) (, ), AMPK (5’adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) (–), and
  JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) () have all been found to directly phosphorylate and
  hence control YAP/TAZ. Finally, YAP/TAZ is regulated in a kinase-independent manner
  (, , ).
