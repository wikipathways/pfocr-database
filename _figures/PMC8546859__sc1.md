caption: Profile of acetyl-CoA metabolism in recombinant R10 cell. Except the innate
  enzymes, the additional PDH, PANK, ACS (Se/acsL641P) and DBAT are driven by strong
  T7 promoter. PDH, PANK, ACS are involved in acetyl-CoA biosynthesis and DBAT is
  responsible for 10-DAB acetylation. Glucose and acetate are primary substrates for
  acetyl-CoA biosynthesis and 10-DAB as the substrate for baccatin III formation.
  Additionally, under alkaline condition DBAT catalyzes the reverse reaction.
