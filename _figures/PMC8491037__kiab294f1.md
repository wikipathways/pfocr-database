caption: Plant lipid metabolic network of TAG assembly. TAG is synthesized from multiple
  substrate pools including at least three DAG pools and at least two acyl donors
  (acyl-CoA and PC). The path of acyl flux through the network into TAG ultimately
  determines the final oil fatty acid composition. Dotted lines indicate acyl group
  transfer, solid lines indicate flux of the glycerol backbone. A, Fatty acid modification
  on PC (e.g. desaturation, hydroxylation). B, Acyl editing cycle exchanging fatty
  acids between PC and acyl-CoA pools. C, Fatty acid elongation. D, De novo DAG(1)
  can be used directly for TAG synthesis as in the Kennedy pathway (gray shade), or
  can be used to produce PC and subsequently PC-derived DAG(2) prior to TAG synthesis
  (blue shade). A third pool of DAG(3) may be associated with the oil body and made
  up of both sources and can be used for TAG biosynthesis. G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  LPA, lyso-phosphatidic acid; PA, phosphatidic acid.
