caption: Fatty acids (FAs), taken up from tumor microenvironment through FA translocase
  (CD36), FA transport protein (FATP) or by other mechanisms (e.g., passive diffusion,
  lipoprotein endocytosis), are esterified by acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS) into fatty
  acyl-CoA (FA-CoA). These latter are used either to build structural or storage lipids
  or as energy sources through the fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) pathway. a Fatty acid
  β-oxidation. The first and rate-limiting step of long-chain acyl-CoAs (LCFA-CoAs)
  oxidation is accomplished by the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) located
  in the outer mitochondrial membrane. CPT1 converts LCFA-CoA into LCFA-carnitine,
  a necessary step to provide the LCFA-CoA entry into the mitochondrial matrix, whereas
  short- and medium-chain FA-CoAs (S- and MCFA-CoAs)) can freely diffuse through the
  mitochondrial inner membrane. Then, a carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase shuttles
  the LCFA-carnitine across the inner mitochondrial membrane where they are converted
  back to LCFA-CoAs by CPT2. Unlike saturated FA-CoA, polyunsaturated FA-CoAs (PUFA-CoAs)
  need to be sequentially converted in trans-2-enoyl-CoA by the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase
  (DECR) and the Δ3, Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI) enzymes, before to be completely
  degraded through the β-oxidation cycle. The latter, through the successive action
  of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) and the α and β-subunits of trifunctional protein
  TP, gives rise to acetyl-CoA molecules, which are further oxidized through the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle to generate ATP and the reducing equivalents NADH and FADH2. b
  De novo lipogenesis (DNL). Citrate, derived from the TCA cycle, is converted to
  acetyl-CoA into the cytoplasm by the ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). Then, acetyl-CoA
  is carboxylated by the cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) into malonyl-CoA,
  which is considered as the rate-limiting reaction. The next step is catalyzed by
  the fatty acid synthase (FAS), that synthesizes one molecule of palmitic acid from
  7 molecules of malonyl-CoA. Further elongation and insertion of double bonds in
  carbon chains from FA (provided by DNL and/or diet), are carried out by FA elongases
  (ELOVLs) and stearoyl-CoA or FA desaturases (SCDs or FADSs), respectively. Glutamine
  and acetate are also suppliers of citrate and acetyl-CoA useful for DNL. c Eicosanoid
  synthesis. The arachidonic acid (ARA), released from membrane phospholipid (PL)
  hydrolysis by the cytoplasmic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α), is further metabolized
  into either prostaglandins (PG) and thromboxanes (TX), or leukotrienes (LT) and
  hydroxyeicosatetranoic acids (HETE). Cyclooxygenases (COX) and lipoxygenases (LOX)
  constitute the respective rate-limiting enzymes of PG and LT/HETE synthesis, respectively.
  All eicosanoids are secreted and thereby exert autocrine and/or paracrine functions.
  d Neutral lipolysis. Hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (TAG) to FA and diacyglycerol
  (DAG) is driven by the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), while the DAG breakdown,
  producing monoacylglycerol (MAG) and FA, is catalyzed by the hormone-sensitive lipase
  (HSL). Finally, the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) hydrolyses MAG into glycerol
  and FA. SSO sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, ETC electron transport chain, MUFA monounsaturated
