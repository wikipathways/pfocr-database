caption: Model depicting how AMPK regulates cell fate decisions through lysosome-dependent
  control of Wnt signaling. (A) In wild-type cells, AMPK inhibition of mTOR allows
  sufficient levels of Tfeb to enter the nucleus and transcriptionally up-regulate
  endolysosomes. This organelle system is required for optimal signaling through the
  canonical Wnt pathway through its ability to sequester the GSK3β-containing DC,
  freeing β-catenin from degradation. Active β-catenin then translocates into the
  nucleus to induce target genes, many of which are important mediators of endodermal
  differentiation, including Sox17. (B) In AMPK double-knockout cells, increased mTOR
  signaling blunts Tfeb activity, leading to a defective endolysosomal compartment.
  As a result, DC inhibition of β-catenin remains intact even in the presence of Wnt,
  preventing robust activation of endodermal genes.
