caption: (1) Intracellular arrival of glucose via glucose transporter (Glut2 in β-cells)
  leads to phosphorylation by glucokinase, and routing to the metabolic pathway. The
  resulting cascade of closure of ATP-dependent potassium channel, depolarization,
  and calcium influx leads to insulin secretion; this process may be inhibited by
  statins [,]. (2) Glucokinase is inhibited by abundance of plasma cholesterol [],
  and thus is conceivably affected by statin-induced inhibition of de-novo cholesterol
  synthesis with increased uptake of plasma LDL. (3) Statin inhibition of HMG-CoA
  reductase suppresses synthesis of ubiquinone (CoQ10), an essential factor in the
  mitochondrial electron-transfer system, resulting in inhibition of insulin secretion
  due to reduced production of ATP []. (4) Statin inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase
  suppresses the synthesis of isoprenoids, thus causing downregulation of Glut4 expression
  on adipocyte cells, leading to impaired glucose uptake. (5) The inhibition of HMG-CoA
  reductase causes upregulation of LDL receptors, leading to enhanced uptake of LDL-cholesterol
  in an effort to replenish intracellular stores. However, the intracellular fate
  of plasma-derived LDL-cholesterol may be distinct from that of de-novo synthesized
  cholesterol. (6) The oxidation of LDL-cholesterol may incite an inflammatory cascade
  that compromises the functional – for example insulin secretion apparatus – and
  ultimately structural integrity of the islet β-cells. (7) Furthermore, cytokine-induced
  over-production of nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to induce β-cell apoptosis via
  the activation of calpain – a calcium-dependent protease []. ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
