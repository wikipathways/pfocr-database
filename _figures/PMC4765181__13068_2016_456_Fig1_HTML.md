caption: Metabolic pathway for n-butanol production via reverse β-oxidation in yeast.
  n-Butanol production and reverse β-oxidation are shown as a process of one or several
  rotations, respectively, of an acetoacetyl-CoA-derived synthesis pathway. This pathway
  can generate various compounds with different chain lengths. The different isoenzymes
  used in this study (Fig. , Table ) are shown for each reaction. The reaction of
  SsnphT7 (use of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA for production of acetoacetyl-CoA) is
  shown in light blue
papertitle: n-Butanol production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is limited by the availability
  of coenzyme A and cytosolic acetyl-CoA.
