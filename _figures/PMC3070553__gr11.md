caption: 'Signaling modules identified by correlational analysis of end points. A–F:
  Schematic diagram of modules identified in . End points in boxes were identified
  as part of the modules from RPPA end point correlational analysis, whereas proteins
  with ellipses were either not studied or did not cluster together with the rest
  of the module but are implicated in the pathway. Analytes in green or red text were
  globally reduced or elevated in tumors, respectively. Light blue arrows indicate
  that an end point directly or indirectly causes phosphorylation of another; and
  dark blue arrows, stimulation (direct or indirect). Solid black lines connect proteins
  that are known to complex with each other. A red perpendicular line represents inhibition.
  Because of overlap in common end points, the two signaling modules (I and F) from  were
  consolidated into a single pathway (F).'
