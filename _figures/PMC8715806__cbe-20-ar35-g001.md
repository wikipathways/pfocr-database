caption: Cover page of the assessment instrument showing a bacterial amino acid biosynthetic
  pathway and explanation of visual conventions. The figure shown here has been modified
  from the version received by students to preserve the security of the instrument.
  Pathway intermediates (shown in boxes) have been assigned names from the International
  Civil Aviation Organization phonetic alphabet. Enzymes (shown in circles) were assigned
  letter names in the original version of the instrument and have been assigned different
  letter names in this modified version.
