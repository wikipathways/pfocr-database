caption: 'Crosstalk between the estrogen receptor and EGFR/HER2/IGF1R membrane tyrosine
  kinase receptors can lead to gene expression and cell growth independent of hormonal
  activation, mainly via activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways.Notes: The estrogen
  receptor can also be regulated by these membrane receptors, which act as coactivators
  and lead to phosphorylation of estrogen receptors in the absence of estrogen (ligand-independent
  receptor activation). The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a major downstream cellular circuit,
  which leads to cell proliferation via the mTORC1 complex. The mTORC2 complex activates
  Akt, which in turn inhibits the proteolysis of cyclin D1/E.Abbreviations: EGFR,
  epidermal growth factor receptor; IGF1R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor;
  mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2;
  ER, estrogen receptor; TSC1/2, tuberous sclerosis complex proteins 1/2; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Src, steroid receptor coactivator.'
