caption: The metabolic pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis is divided into three distinct
  parts. The carbon flux to the isoprenoids pathway supplies the necessary precursors
  and cofactors for the MVA/MEP pathways, which then produce the common precursors
  DMAPP and IPP. These two precursors are then condensed to generate GPP, FPP, GGPP,
  and GFPP, which are catalyzed to form various isoprenoids. 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate
