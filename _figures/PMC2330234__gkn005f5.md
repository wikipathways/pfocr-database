caption: Model for the role of CstF in the DNA damage response. Coupling polyadenylation,
  transcription and DNA repair. After exposure to DNA damage-inducing agents, the
  elongating RNAP II-CstF holoenzyme complex stalls at sites of damage. A BRCA1/BARD1-containing
  complex is activated and recruited to sites of repair, inhibiting RNAP II and the
  associated polyadenylation machinery by ubiquitination followed by degradation of
  the RNAP IIO. This process facilitates repair by allowing access to the repair machinery,
  while simultaneously preventing polyadenylation of aborted nascent mRNAs, which
  are eliminated by exosome-mediated degradation in a nuclear surveillance pathway.
  Alternatively, the RNAP II complexes arrested at certain DNA lesions are not degraded,
  CSA and CSB proteins regulate the recruitment of chromatin remodeling and TCR factors
  (), and then RNAP II re-engages and continues transcription once repair is completed.
  Given that CstF-50 can functionally interact with all the elements of this model,
  we propose an important role for this protein in the transcription-coupled DNA damage
  response.
