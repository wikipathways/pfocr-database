caption: 'Model for ATP- and GTP-specific developmental pathways during zebrafish  embryogenesis.
  IMP feeds into the ATP and GTP pathways. The ATP pathway  facilitates retinoblast
  proliferation and S-phase exit. The GTP pathway  facilitates pigment synthesis:
  guanine in iridophores, sepiapterin in  xanthophores and eumelanin in melanosomes/melanocytes  (;  ).
  Iridophore  pathways are shaded light gray, xanthophore pathways are shaded yellow
  and  melanophore/RPE pathways are shaded dark gray. Enzymes are in red, except  those
  targeted by morpholinos, which are green.'
