caption: Pathways of 1,2-PD catabolism in Salmonella and the putative pathway of 1,2-PD
  catabolism in L. innocua Lin11. The pdu pathway steps in the upper part of the diagram
  (above the dashed line) appear to occur in both species. The 2-methylcitric acid
  cycle reactions shown in the lower part of the diagram do not appear to take place
  in Listeria. The figure has been adapted from work published in references , , and
