caption: Alkyl isothiocyanates such as sulforaphane (SFN) and erucin (ERN), produced
  by myrosinase (MYR) action on glucosinolates after decompartmentalization of broccoli
  and broccoli sprouts (chewing or processing), can be interconverted post-absorption.
  Either can be scavenged by glutathione (spontaneous or mediated by glutathione S-transferase
  (GST)) to form a glutathione (GSH) conjugate which is rapidly processed by the mercapturic
  acid pathway to N-acetyl cysteine isothiocyanate (ITC) which predominates in urine.
  SFN is used as the example here although ERN is presumably metabolized in the same
  manner. It is not known whether interconversion occurs between free ITC forms, after
  conjugation, or from either form.
