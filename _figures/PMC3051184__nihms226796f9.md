caption: A proposed model explaining upregulation of CREB expression by RA in NHTBE
  cells. In this model, RA rapidly activates protein kinase C and transmits an activation
  signal to phosphorylate nuclear CREB via the Ras/ERK/Rsk pathway, thereby increasing
  its transactivation activity. A basal CREB regulation of the positive feedback loop
  is constituted by induction of CREB, which is consequently activated by RA binding
  of CRE motifs. In addition, Sp1 protein, which is increased by RA, binds to Sp1-binding
  sites in the CREB promoter region to further activate transcription of CREB genes.
