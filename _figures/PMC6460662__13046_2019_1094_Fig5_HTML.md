caption: Mechanism of action of anti-BRAF drugs on the RAS signaling pathway. RAS
  activates both the CRAF and the BRAF pathways. Inhibitors for both BRAF and MEK
  are shown. These inhibitors act to prevent cell proliferation and growth of cancer
  cells. Sorafenib, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, cobimetinib, regorafenib, and trametinib
  are all FDA approved for the treatment of cancer
