caption: Schematic presentation of systematic chilling response mechanisms in chloroplast
  of sugar beet. Red and green letters represent proteins were significantly up- and
  down-regulated after chilling, respectively. Blue, red, yellow and purple arrows
  represent transport-related pathway, antioxidant pathway and H2O2 signal, translation
  from chloroplast DNA and starch metabolism, respectively. The dotted line represents
  the signal transduction pathway
