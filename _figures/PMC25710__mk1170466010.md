caption: Class C Vps proteins mediate the  delivery of multiple transport intermediates
  to the vacuole. The common  phenotypes of the four class C vps null mutants, as
  well  as the genetic interactions observed between the VPS33,  VPS16, and VPS18
  genes, suggest that the  class C Vps proteins function at the same transport step.
  Cross-linking  studies indicated that Vps11p, Vps18p, and Vps16p are components
  of a  protein complex that interacts with the Sec1p homologue Vps33p. A  significant
  portion of the class C Vps protein complex cofractionated  with vacuolar membranes.
  Upon shift to nonpermissive temperature,  vps18tsf cells exhibited defects in  protein
  transport along the two distinct biosynthetic pathways (I,  CPY/CPS; II, ALP), the
  endocytic pathway and autophagy. Furthermore,  overexpression of the vacuolar syntaxin
  homologue Vam3p suppressed  defects associated with vps18tsf cells.  Therefore,
  we propose that the class C Vps proteins function together  with Vam3p to mediate
  docking and/or fusion of late transport  intermediates with the vacuole.
