caption: 'Schematic showing the preliminary mechanism of Gnao1 in SCs regulating SC
  differentiation and myelination. Gnao1 deficiency triggering spontaneous differentiation
  of SCs through the following two ways: (1) The absence of Gnao1 in SCs reduced the
  content of the Gαo, resulting in the depolymerization of Gαβγ heterotrimers, which
  increased the number of free Gβγ dimers, promoted the activation of downstream signaling
  pathways (such as PI3K/AKT), and facilitates the differentiation of SCs. (2) Gnao1
  deletion in SCs led to increased synthesis of cAMP, the second messenger in the
  G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, which accelerated SCs differentiation'
