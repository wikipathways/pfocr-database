caption: Following binding with the MR, aldosterone recruits the β-arrestin/c-Src
  complex thus inducing the endocytosis of the AT1R and then leading to the activation
  of ‘genomic' and ‘non-genomic' pathways. GRK5 is part of genomic pathway since following
  AT1R activation, it binds to the Ca2+-CaM and translocates into the nucleus of the
  cardiomyocyte. Then, GRK5 acts as a HDAC5 kinase increasing the transcription of
  hypertrophic genes (that is, MEF2). In contrast, GRK2 is mainly involved in the
  non-genomic response to aldosterone stimulation. In fact, this kinase following
  NADPH oxidases and ERK activation is phosphorylated at ser670, and following the
  binding to the chaperone HSP90, GRK2 translocates to mitochondria, where it increases
  myocyte apoptosis. Aldosterone through GPER activation activates a parallel signalling
  that inhibits the phosphorylation of GRK2 and the subsequent ROS generation. Thus,
  GRK2 and GRK5 participate to ventricular dysfunction and heart failure progression
  downstream of hyper-aldosteronism. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with MR or AT1R antagonists
  or with βARKct and also knockdown of GRK2 or GRK5 them self inhibit the MR/AT1R
  signalling axis.
