caption: 'Biosynthesis of astaxanthin and ergosterol in X. dendrorhous. The production
  of carotenoids and sterols requires isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) from the mevalonate
  pathway []. Carotenoid biosynthesis begins with the production of geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate (GGPP) from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and IPP by GGPP synthase
  encoded by crtE [, ]. Then, the bi-functional enzyme phytoene-β-carotene synthase
  encoded by crtYB condenses two GGPP molecules producing phytoene []. Subsequently,
  phytoene undergoes four desaturation reactions carried out by the phytoene desaturase
  enzyme encoded by crtI, producing lycopene []. The cyclization of both ends of lycopene
  by the lycopene cyclase activity of the phytoene-β-carotene synthase produces β-carotene
  [], which is then transformed into astaxanthin via intermediate xanthophylls. To
  date, X. dendrorhous is the only known organism that produces astaxanthin from β-carotene
  through a cytochrome P450 system [], which is composed of the cytochrome P450 enzyme
  astaxanthin synthase (CrtS, encoded by crtS) [, ] and a cytochrome P450 reductase
  (CPR) (named CrtR in X. dendrorhous, encoded by crtR) []. CrtS catalyzes the hydroxylation
  and ketolation of carbons at positions 3 and 4, respectively, of each end ring of
  β-carotene to finally produce astaxanthin [], while CrtR assists CrtS in these reactions
  []. In ergosterol biosynthesis, two cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved, which
  are encoded by CYP51 (lanosterol 14α-demethylase) [] and CYP61 (C-22 sterol desaturase)
