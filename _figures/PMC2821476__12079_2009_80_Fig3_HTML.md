caption: TNFα induced signaling. TNFα is capable of inducing both pro-survival and
  pro-apoptotic signaling through its receptor TNFR1. Formation of complex 1 leads
  to activation of NFκB and its downstream effectors, while complex II can trigger
  apoptosis through activation of the caspase cascade. The apoptotic pathway is blocked
  by c-FLIP, which is targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin ligase ITCH and apoptosis
  can proceed if JNK activation is sustained (Chang et al. ). Signaling molecules
  in green provide survival functions, while those in red contribute to apoptosis.
  Those in yellow promote apoptosis only when superactivated under certain contexts
