caption: Our results are summarized in this diagram. GPHD and damulin B activate the
  PI3K and Akt pathways, which leads to the induction of several growth factors. We
  assume that these growth factors are secreted to the medium and then act as growth
  factors for hDPCs in an autocrine manner. As a result, this signal loop might be
  amplified by GPHD and damulin B. The dashed line indicates the speculation of the
  authors
