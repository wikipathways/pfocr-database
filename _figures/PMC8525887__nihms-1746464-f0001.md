caption: (A) Plasminogen pathway and PAI-1 regulation in normal condition. (B) Hepatic
  injury caused by alcohol, HCV, stress, and a high-fat diet, stimulates TGF-β synthesis
  leading to PAI-1 expression in hepatocytes. The increase in PAI-1 level induces
  AKT activation and promotes differentiation into cancer stem-like cells (CSC) with
  characteristics such as self-renewal, cell proliferation and cell survival. Differentiation
  into CSC is accompanied by increased expression of numerous oncogenes such as Cyclin
  D1, MYC, OCT, and Nanog, and ultimately plays a key role in the progression of HCC.
