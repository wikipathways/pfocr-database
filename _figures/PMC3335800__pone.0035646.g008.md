caption: IL-1β induces NFκB activation involving phosphorylation of IKK2, degradation
  of IκBα and nuclear translocation of p65/p50 leading to upregulation of Rgs4 mRNA
  expression. IL-1β also activates three MAPKs. ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK enhance while
  JNK inhibits IL-1β-induced Rgs4 upregulation. The effect of ERK1/2 is exerted on
  the canonical IKK2/IκBα/p65 pathway of NFκB activation and p38 MAPK may target at
  the chromatin level. The p38 may also inhibit JNK activity. Activation of the MEKK1-MKK4-JNK
  pathway down-regulates Rgs4 expression through transcriptional repression at the
  chromatin level (via AP1 binding) and also signal inhibition of NFκB activation
  at the level of IKK2. The intricate interactions across various transcription factors
  and chromatin remodeling need further investigation. The solid arrows indicate the
  activation while the spotted arrows represent the inhibition.
