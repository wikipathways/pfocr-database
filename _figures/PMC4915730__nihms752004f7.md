caption: 'The results suggest that P-gp overexpression not only increases EPI efflux,
  but also increases Beclin 1 expression and induces autophagy in EPI-R cells. The
  enhanced autophagy inactivates the NF-κB pathway through multiple targets to reduce
  apoptosis. This P-gp-autophagy-NF-κB pathway of inducing EPI resistance is defined
  by red arrows (as compared to effect of EPI on genomic DNA defined by black arrows).
  Key questions to this model are: 1) how is enhanced autophagy induced and role of
  P-gp in the process (red dot line) and 2) how does enhanced autophagy inhibit NF-κB
  pathway (blue dot line)?'
