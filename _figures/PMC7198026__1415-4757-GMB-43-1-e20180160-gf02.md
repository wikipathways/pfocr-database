caption: . Polypeptides bind to their associated receptors and trigger the tyrosine
  (Tyr) kinase (TK) events of the receptors, Src or JAKs. Underlying STAT-3 action
  is the stimulated receptor for phosphorylation on specific Tyr residue by TKs that
  causes STAT-3:STAT-3 dimerization and stimulation. STAT-3 mounts up in the nucleus,
  where it binds to specific DNA response elements in the promoters of target genes,
  which causes gene transcription.
