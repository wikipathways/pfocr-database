caption: Schematic representation of SGLT2/IGF1R/PI3K-regulated EMT in podocytes under
  diabetic conditions. (Left) In diabetes, glycemic dysregulation caused the overexpression
  of SGLT2 in podocytes, which then promoted the formation of an intracellular hyperglycemic
  microenvironment. In response to high-glucose stimulation, the transcriptional and
  translational capacities of IGF1R/PI3K signaling were enhanced. At the molecular
  level, IGF1 and IGF2 expression was increased and closely bound to IGF1 receptors,
  further activated the phosphorylation of PI3K, and finally led to podocyte dysfunction,
  such as enhanced EMT. Microscopically, podocyte loss or fusion and glomerular fibrosis
  occurred. Macroscopically, proteinuria appeared. (Right) When SGLT2 was inhibited,
  podocyte damage mediated by the IGF1R/PI3K signaling pathway was inhibited, such
  as decreased IGF1 and IGF2 circulating levels, and increased nephrin and E-cad.
