caption: Proposed mechanism of AP complement activation and order of events in elastase-induced
  AAA disease. (1) Elastase perfusion unmasks hidden neoepitopes (newly exposed self-antigens)
  that are recognized by IgG antibody, providing a platform for properdin-stabilized
  AP C3 convertase (C3bBbP) assembly. (2) Complement activation leads to the release
  of anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a. (3) These molecules attract immune cells called
  neutrophils. (4) Activated neutrophils release chemicals that attract other inflammatory
  immune cells, including monocytes and macrophages. (5) Macrophages release proteases
  and other inflammatory mediators that cause structural damage (weakening of the
  aortic wall) and eventual aneurysmal changes characteristic of AAA.
