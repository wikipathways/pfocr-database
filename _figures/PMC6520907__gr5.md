caption: Presumed mechanism by which inulin alleviated glucose and lipid metabolism
  disorders in ob/ob miceThe inulin-supplemented diet promotes the proliferation of
  Prevotellaceae UCG 001 in the gut of ob/ob mice. This strain degrades inulin to
  produce SCFAs, which recognized GPR41/43 on the surface of intestinal epithelial
  cells, and lead to activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. Finally, this signal
  leads to changes in downstream metabolic functions. SCFAs, short-chain fatty acids;
  GPR41/43, G protein-coupled receptors 41/43; AMPK, adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated
  protein kinase; TC, total cholesterol; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol;
  AUC, area under the curve; IPGTT, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test.
