caption: Effects of mechanical forces on various immune cells in TME. (A) The activation
  of T cells depends on the adhesion of T cells to antigen presenting cells (APC).
  In addition, the mechanical force exerted on the T cell receptor (TCR) may promote
  a conformational change in TCR/CD3 complex, thus activating T cells and signaling
  pathways. (B) B cell receptors (BCRs) sense the chemical and physical characteristics
  of antigens. Mechanical force induces more sensitive to the activation of IgG-BCR–expressing
  memory B cells. This mechanism is achieved by enriching the important signal transduction
  phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 through the positively charged IgG tail of the plasma membrane
  tethered in quiescent B cells, thus promoting the activation of IgG BCR. (C) Mechanical
  stretching (MS) enhances M1 polarization and anticancer effects. Specifically, MS
  promotes tumoricidal polarization of M1 macrophages through the FAK/NF-κB signaling
  pathway. In addition, YAP senses the hardness of the surrounding matrix and stimulates
  macrophages to transform into the immunosuppressive M2 type, which secretes many
  immunosuppressive factors. (D) In NK cell antitumor immunotherapy, one of the most
  relevant NK cell activation receptors is NKG2D, which recognizes 8 different NKG2D
  ligands (NKG2DL). NKG2D, under the influence of mechanical forces, can distinguish
  among ligands and thus induce different NK activities. (E) The complete ECM component
  high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HMW-HA) has a role in actively maintaining
  immune tolerance. HMW-HA promotes in vitro persistence of Foxp3, a key transcription
  factor for Tregs. HMW-HA also actively promotes the function of CD4+CD25+ Tregs.
  (F) Col1 associates with tumor tissue, thus generating a biophysically “rigid” microenvironment
  around cancer cells that promotes cell migration, and induces cancer cell proliferation
  and survival. High collagen deposition in the TME increases tumor density and thus
  alters mechanical properties. These alterations increase solid stress, interstitial
  fluid pressure, and hardness in tumors, and together lead to changes in tissue microstructure.
  (G) The fibroblast matrix and the associated ECM around the tumor provide physical
  constraints on infiltrating DCs. Mechanical forces are ubiquitous in organisms,
  and fluid shear stress regulates the movement patterns of DCs.
