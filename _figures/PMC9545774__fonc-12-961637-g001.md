caption: Hypoxia inhibits the immune response by inhibiting immune cells, recruiting
  immunosuppressive cells, regulating CAFs, promoting tumor cell growth, and mediating
  immune escape. (A) Anoxic metabolites, lactic acid, and adenosine inhibit T cell
  effector function and proliferation by blocking the mTOR pathway and interacting
  with the A2A receptor on the T cell surface. Hypoxia promotes T cell apoptosis and
  directly inhibits T cell proliferation and differentiation. Hypoxia upregulates
  IL-10, VEGF, and other cytokines through HIF-1α and inhibits the differentiation
  and maturation of DCs, leading to the inhibition of T cell function. Moreover, hypoxia-induced
  high levels of HIF-1α and BNIP3 promote programmed cell death in tumor cells captured
  by DC. In addition, hypoxia inhibits NK cell function by activating the PI3K/mTOR
  signaling pathway. (B) Hypoxia induced the mRNA expression of TGF-β, VEGF, IL-6,
  IL-10, and PD-L1 and promoted CAF participation in the recruitment of MDSCs, Tregs,
  and type 2 TAMs to maintain the immunosuppressive state of the microenvironment,
  promoting tumor cells to evade immune surveillance. (C) Hypoxia upregulates the
  expression of MMP adam10 and induces the immune escape of tumor cells.
