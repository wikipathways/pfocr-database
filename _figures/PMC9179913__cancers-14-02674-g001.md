caption: RT-mediated STING pathway activation results in the initiation of the antitumor
  immune response. Schematic initiation of immune responses to RT-mediated tumor DNA
  damage takes place in the presence of the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)
  that detects double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol. Following cGAMP synthesis
  by the activated cGAS, STING is also activated by direct binding to cGAMP. STING
  then translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus where it
  binds to the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and initiates signal phosphorylation processes
  that result in the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor IRF3.
  After an initial binding of IRF3 to the STING–TBK1 complex, IRF3 dissociates and
  translocates to the nucleus where it induces type I IFN production. Type I IFN (mainly
  IFN-α/β) signaling leads to activation of DC, which in turn activate CD8+ T cells
  (via presentation of tumor antigens released by the dying tumor cells) to mediate
  specific antitumor immune responses.
