caption: Regulation of Ski and SnoN protein stability by the TGF-β/Smad signaling
  pathway. TGF-β induces Ski and SnoN protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome
  system (UPS) after 15–30 min of treatment because activated R-Smads are adapters
  for ubiquitin E3-ligases APC, Smurf2, and Arkadia
papertitle: Transcriptional cofactors Ski and SnoN are major regulators of the TGF-β/Smad
  signaling pathway in health and disease.
