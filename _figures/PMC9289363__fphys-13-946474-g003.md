caption: Adaptive and pathological significance of hepatic ketogenesis in NAFL. Under
  hepatic ketogenesis sufficient conditions, the increased fatty acid entry into the
  liver during fasting and HFD can efficiently enter into ketogenesis pathway and
  protects from excessive accumulation of lipids and thereby lipotoxicity. On the
  other hand, under insufficient hepatic ketogenesis condition, the excess fatty acids
  result in the accumulation of acetyl-CoA and enter to TCA cycle, and thereby increasing
  gluconeogenesis and DNL. Thus, continuous accumulation of fatty acids results in
  lipotoxicity and NAFL progression.

  description: Adaptive and pathological significance of hepatic ketogenesis in NAFL.
    Under hepatic ketogenesis sufficient conditions, the increased fatty acid entry
    into the liver during fasting and HFD can efficiently enter into ketogenesis pathway
    and protects from excessive accumulation of lipids and thereby lipotoxicity. On
    the other hand, under insufficient hepatic ketogenesis condition, the excess fatty
    acids result in the accumulation of acetyl-CoA and enter to TCA cycle, and thereby
    increasing gluconeogenesis and DNL. Thus, continuous accumulation of fatty acids
    results in lipotoxicity and NAFL progression.
