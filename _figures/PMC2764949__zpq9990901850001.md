caption: PKC signaling hypothesis to explain stress-induced prefrontal cortical pyramidal
  cell structural modulation and PFC-dependent cognitive impairments. Stress causes
  noradrenergic hyper-sensitization and PKC activation through the α1R/Gq/PLC pathway.
  Activated PKC phosphorylates MARCKS, and phospho-MARCKS induces dendritic spine
  loss or shrinkage. This is one plausible mechanism via which PKC inhibition can
  protect against stress-induced prefrontal cortical structural modification. Structural
  connectivity is the foundation for PFC-dependent cognitive function; thus, PKC blockage,
  which prevents stress-induced structural changes, rescues the stress-induced cognitive
  impairments. Dotted lines indicate that the pathway from PKC to cognitive impairment
  may occur independently from, although in a manner correlated with, structural modification
  of pyramidal cells.

  description: PKC signaling hypothesis to explain stress-induced prefrontal cortical
    pyramidal cell structural modulation and PFC-dependent cognitive impairments.
    Stress causes noradrenergic hyper-sensitization and PKC activation through the
    α1R/Gq/PLC pathway. Activated PKC phosphorylates MARCKS, and phospho-MARCKS induces
    dendritic spine loss or shrinkage. This is one plausible mechanism via which PKC
    inhibition can protect against stress-induced prefrontal cortical structural modification.
    Structural connectivity is the foundation for PFC-dependent cognitive function;
    thus, PKC blockage, which prevents stress-induced structural changes, rescues
    the stress-induced cognitive impairments. Dotted lines indicate that the pathway
    from PKC to cognitive impairment may occur independently from, although in a manner
    correlated with, structural modification of pyramidal cells.
