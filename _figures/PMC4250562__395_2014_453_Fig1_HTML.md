caption: 'Connecting the limb to the heart in RIC. This figure shows the potential
  interplay between the neural pathway (green solid lines) and humoral pathway (broken
  red lines) in mediating RIC cardioprotection. Cycles of brief upper limb ischemia/reperfusion
  induced by inflation/deflation of a cuff placed on the upper arm produce the local
  release of autacoids, which then activate local sensory afferent neurons. One experimental
  study has shown the involvement of the neuronal activity in the brainstem dorsal
  motor vagal nucleus (DMVN) in RIC cardioprotection—this provides parasympathetic
  innervation of the left ventricle and other internal organs. A circulating blood-borne
  cardioprotective factor(s) is produced in response to the RIC stimulus downstream
  of the local sensory afferent neurons in the upper limb, but the actual source for
  its release is not currently known. Potential sites of release of the cardioprotective
  factor(s) include: (1) from the conditioned limb itself, (2) from the central nervous
  system (brainstem), (3) from pre-/post-ganglionic parasympathetic nerve endings
  within the heart (broken green lines); and (4) from a non-conditioned remote organ/tissue
  receiving parasympathetic innervation'
