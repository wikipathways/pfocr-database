caption: Similarities between EMT and BMW pathways of metastasis. The non-exhaustive
  common signatures associated with metastasis in the context of EMT and BMW pathways
  are represented. The mesenchymal state of the EMT pathway is analogous to the transformed
  state of the BMW pathway and are executed by similar biological functions but with
  different tools (Top side of the figure). Likewise, the reversible epithelial state
  of the EMT pathway is analogous to the exit phase of blebbishield emergency program
  (BMW pathway) and are executed by similar biological functions but with different
  tools (Bottom side of the figure). The main biological functions shared by EMT and
  BMW pathways are represented by vertical bars. The key molecules involved in reversible/hybrid-EMT
  is shown in the black box (far left) and the ones involved in reversible or cell
  survival and death hybrid is shown in the black box (far right). PKCs protein kinase-C,
  TSP1 thrombospondin-1, c-IAPs cellular inhibitors of apoptotic proteins, AKRs aldo-ketoreductases,
  VEGF-A vascular endothelial growth factor-A, PRMT1 protein arginine methyltransferase-1,
  ALDH aldehyde dehydrogenases, PRC2 polycomb-repressive complex
