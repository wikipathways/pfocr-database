caption: Summary of COX-2-independent AMPK-CREB-Nrf2 signalling pathway activated
  by celecoxib in the vascular endothelium. Treatment of human endothelial cells results
  in COX-2 independent signalling via phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 (pAMPK).
  This leads to activation of CREB at serine 133 (pCREB) and nuclear translocation
  of Nrf2. The CREB and Nrf2 pathways are thought to act in parallel, binding to the
  CREB response element (CRE) and the antioxidant response element (ARE) respectively
  to upregulate the expression of the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory genes heme oxygenase-1
  (HO-1) and H-Ferritin (FHC). The anti-inflammatory actions of this pathway include
  inhibition of TNF-α-mediated activation and nuclear translocation of p65. This response
  attenuated the pro-inflammatory upregulation of the cellular adhesion molecule vascular
  cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).
