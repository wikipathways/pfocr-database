caption: Figure illustrates differently the results obtained for Q6 using Explore
  Relationships tool. The results of Q6 can be visualized by entering the concepts
  (Calvin cycle and gene) in the left panel. On executing the query, all the genes
  involved in the chosen pathway are revealed. The visualized graph can be altered
  based on the user interest. Additionally, a gene could be selected (circled on the
  left) and further explored by clicking on the More Info link which directs the user
  to the information source.
