caption: Illustration Describing the Roles of PPARγ1 and 2 Isoforms. Schematic of
  the suggested roles of PPARγ 1 and 2 forms in regulating podocyte/glomerular disease
  specific effects (right panel) vs. metabolic/systemic and adipogenic effects (left
  panel). PPARγ agonism plays a well-established role in the setting of treatment
  of Type II Diabetes, and treatment with its agonists, thiazolidinediones (TZDs),
  leads to increased (‘a’ pathway) insulin sensitivity and glycemic control [,]. However,
  these beneficial effects are also accompanied with adverse effects (‘a’ pathway),
  such as increased cholesterol, adipogenesis and decreased osteoblastogenesis [].
  TZDs or PPARγ agonists have now been demonstrated to reduce podocyte injury (‘b’
  pathway) by enhancing their viability and cytoskeletal integrity and decreasing
  apoptosis [,,,,]. A few pathways involved in this process include crosstalk with
  the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), decreased caspase-3 activity and decreased TRPC6
  expression. Gain of PPARγ activity or its activation by TZDs (‘c’ pathway) has been
  shown to reduce proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in various animal models of glomerular
  disease, such as 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx), minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental
  glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and glomerulonephritis (GN) [,,,,,,,,,]. On the other
  hand, loss of PPARγ in podocyte specific Pparg KO mouse (‘d’ pathway) has demonstrated
  exacerbation of glomerular injury and proteinuria in animal disease models of FSGS
  and GN [,,,,]. Analysis of the podocyte vs. adipose tissue specific expression of
  genes downstream of PPARγ containing putative or identified PPREs () informs us
  that these downstream effects in podocytes/glomeruli are likely directed by the
  PPARγ1 splice variant, distinct from the adipocyte-regulatory γ2 variant.
