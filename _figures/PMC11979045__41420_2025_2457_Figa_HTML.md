caption: Intestinal barrier dysfunction triggers, such as endotoxin and severe burns,
  may induce the release of Metrnl from vascular endothelium. This leads to an increase
  in circulating Metrnl. Both circulating Metrnl and local Metrnl inhibit inflammation
  and the IKKβ/IκBα/NFκB/MLCK/MLC signaling pathway in enterocytes, thereby protecting
  tight junctions from disruption caused by endotoxin or burns
papertitle: Metrnl protects intestinal barrier function by regulating tight junctions
  via the IKKβ/IκBα/NFκB/MLCK/MLC signaling pathway
