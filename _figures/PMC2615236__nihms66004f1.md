caption: Upon binding IGF, the IGF-1R recruits scaffold proteins that direct the intracellular
  signaling down two major IGF-responsive pathways. Acting via Grb2 and SOS recruitment,
  IGF enhances cell proliferation by activation of the loop of cyclins and their cyclin-dependent
  kinases (left). Alternatively, recruitment of PI3-K via IRS proteins activates Akt
  (formally known as protein kinase B), which is a master switch involved in survival,
  hypertrophy, differentiation and transcriptional activation (right). These two pathways
  are not independent, as illustrated by the ability of IGF to enhance cell proliferation
  via Akt - TSC - p27 - CDK or Akt – forkhead - cyclin. Presumably, all these branches
  could be activated in most types of cells, but the requirement of any given pathway
  for a respective physiological response depends on what primary path is limiting.
  For instance, IGF-dependent Erk activation is limiting for myoblast proliferation
  [, ], but IGF-dependent PI3-K activation is the restrictive critical pathway for
  breast tumor cell proliferation [].
