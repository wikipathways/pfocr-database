caption: SOX2-expressing tumor cells as potential therapeutic targets. (A) Anti-mitotic
  chemotherapy (e.g. cytarabine) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway inhibitor (e.g.
  vismodegib) fail to kill SOX2+ MPCs and cause CSC-mediated clinical relapse (left).
  Mithramycin, a highly effective drug against SOX2+ mouse and human SHH medulloblastoma
  cells, can target SOX2+ MPCs in vitro and stop tumor regrowth (right). (B) In LSCC,
  SOX2 is overexpressed due to copy number gain at 3q26.33. LSD1 is highly expressed
  in SOX2+ LSCC cells. Inhibition of LSD1 expression by LSD1 inhibitors effectively
  reduces SOX2 expression, thereby suppressing generation of CSCs and oncogenic potentiality
  of SOX2-dependent lineage-specific survival in SOX2+ tumors. (C) Potentiality of
  vaccine development targeting SOX2 in NSCLC patients. About 50% NSCLC patients could
  elicit SOX2-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses while the remaining 50% patients
  could not. SOX2-specific immune responses are amplified upon administration of anti-PD-1
  immunotherapy to patients with SOX2-specific CD8+ T cells, thus, leading to the
  tumor regression. The rest of the patients lacking SOX2-specific T lymphocytes fail
  to respond to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, resulting in disease relapse, and thus can
  constitute ideal candidates for SOX2-targeting vaccines. APC, antigen presenting
  cell; MHC, major histopatibility complex; TCR, T cell receptor.
