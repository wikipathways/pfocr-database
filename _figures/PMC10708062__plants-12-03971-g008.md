caption: Analysis of DEGs involved in carbon fixation under osmotic stress. (a) The
  expression patterns of DEGs involved in carbon fixation; (b) major metabolism pathway
  and key enzymes of carbon fixation. The green digits represent down-regulated DEGs.
  Schemes were retrieved from KEGG (ko00710). The dashed lines represent participation,
  the dashed boxes represent pathway, the solid lines represent synthesis. The color
  spectrum of heat map ranging from white to blue represents Log2FC values from high
  to low, |Log2FC| ≥ 1
