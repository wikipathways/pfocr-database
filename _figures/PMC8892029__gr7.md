caption: Model summarizing the alterations of cholesterol homeostasis in response
  to mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads
  to an increase of cholesterol on the ER membrane. This increase in cholesterol downregulates
  the activity of SREBP2, consequently suppressing the expression of mevalonate pathway
  genes. The increase in cholesterol also posttranslationally regulates ER membrane–bound
  enzymes such as HMGCR and SQLE, reducing their abundance. This multifaceted suppression
  of the mevalonate pathway affects the output, lowering the abundance of sterol precursors.
  Other metabolites are affected in a, yet poorly understood, complex-specific manner.
  Indicated are the observed changes in this study. The hypothesized order of events
  is indicated by black arrows. The directionality of changes is indicated by boxed
  arrows, red indicating an upregulation or increase and blue arrows indicating a
  downregulation or a decrease. Proteins are indicated with gray ovals. HMGCR, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase; SQLE, squalene epoxidase; SREBP2, sterol regulatory element–binding protein 2.
