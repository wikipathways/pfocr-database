caption: Comprehensive analysis of known miRNAs was performed to uncover those that
  were increased in lung cancers relative to adjacent normal lung. (A) Initial analysis
  was performed in transgenic cyclin E-driven mouse models that recapitulated frequent
  features of human lung cancer such as presence of chromosome instability, hedgehog
  pathway activation, single or multiple pre-malignant and malignant (adenocarcinoma)
  lung lesions and even the onset of metastases. Results were confirmed and extended
  for a subset of highlighted miRNAs (see figure) within a panel of paired normal-malignant
  human lung tissues. Gain and loss of function studies were performed in murine and
  human lung cancer cells to explore the anti-neoplastic effects of each highlighted
  miRNA. This led to finding miR-31 as a key oncomir in the lung. This conclusion
  was made based on engineered loss of miR-31 that caused a significant reduction
  in lung cancer formation after transplantation of these cells into syngeneic mice,
  as discussed in the text. (B) Bioinformatic analysis was performed using the indicated
  programs shown in this panel. This uncovered the tumor suppressors (LATS2 and PPP2R2A)
  as regulators of the oncogenic effects of miR-31. The increase in arrow size conveys
  the increased stringency of selection for the highlighted miRNAs.
