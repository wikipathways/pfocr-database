caption: Graphic illustration for methyl-CpG binding protein 2-mediated pathway of
  neuronal gene transcription. The activity of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2)
  is mediated by phosphorylation, which can response to cell cycle or cellular activity.
  MeCP2 exerts pluripotent functions at genetic and epigenetic layers, including directly
  or indirectly affecting gene transcription, or modifying chromatin structures. Such
  modulatory network eventually affects both structure and function of neurons[-,,].
