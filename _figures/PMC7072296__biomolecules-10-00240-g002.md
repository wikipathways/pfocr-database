caption: Regulatory models of the Nrf2-ARE pathway induced by arsenic. Under basal
  condition, Nrf2 is associated with Keap1 and degraded by proteasomes. Under arsenic-exposed
  condition, Nrf2 is activated via the canonical and noncanonical mechanisms. Arsenic
  binds to the Ring finger domain of RING-box 1 (Rbx1), which leads to the suppression
  of Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, thereby activating the Nrf2-induced antioxidant
  signaling pathway via the canonical mechanism. Arsenic induces Nrf2 activation via
  the noncanonical mechanism by p62 accumulation due to dysregulated autophagy flux.
  p62 is a downstream gene of Nrf2, forming a positive feedback loop with Nrf2.
