caption: Schematic view of the potential mechanisms by which RNS60 protect motor neurons
  and ameliorate the neuromuscular impairment in ALS. In the motor neurons RNS60 activates
  the p-Akt mediated pro-survival pathway and prevents the decrease of Nrf2 mediated
  anti-oxidant response while reducing the mitochondrial alterations (reduced vacuoles)
  and oxidative stress (NT). RNS60 also enhances phosphorylation of p-Akt, and levels
  of Nrf2, in a subpopulation of protective astrocytes that lead to an overexpression
  of the IL-4. IL-4 then induces the polarization of CD68 microglia toward a prohealing
  M2 phenotype creating a neuroprotective environment. In the sciatic nerve RNS60
  prevents demyelination by protecting Schwann cells through the p-Akt pro-survival
  pathway and this results in the reduced NMJ denervation. This, together with the
  increased of CD68 positive macrophage recruitment in the muscle and the consequent
  debris clearing and tissue remodeling, results in the amelioration of neuromuscular
  impairment. RNS60 may also exert its protective action through the activation of
  immunomodulatory Treg, known to be negatively correlated with the severity of ALS
  in patients and animal models
