caption: The hierarchy of cholangiocarcinoma stem cells. Hepatic stem cells grow and
  differentiate into hepatic progenitor cells and mature hepatocytes (hepatocytes
  and cholangiocytes). CCA stem cells are produced by genetic abnormalities of hepatic
  stem cells, hepatic progenitor cells, or CCA cells, which then grow and differentiate
  to CCA cells. The NOTCH signaling pathway might induce mature hepatocytes to develop
  into CCA (in mice). Cholangiocytes can also transform into CCA cells through ROS
  and inflammation-induced genetic and epigenetic variation.
