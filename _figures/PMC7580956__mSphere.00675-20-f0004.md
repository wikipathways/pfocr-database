  bonds by the Fd/Trx system activates several CBC enzymes (FBP, SBP, RPIA, PRK, RBCL;
  abbreviations explained below). FTR and FD of the Fd/Trx system require for their
  functioning a posttranslationally added Fe-S prosthetic group provided by the Fe-S
  assembly system (for details on the SUF pathway of Fe-S cluster assembly in the

  equivalent (NADPH) through the exchange of DHAP/GA3P and 3PG, reflecting the cytosolic
  NADPH/NADP+ ratio and thus the overall metabolic state of the cell. In contrast,
  the E. gracilis plastid is an energy-converting organelle, harvesting light into
  chemical energy bound as NADPH and ATP, and subsequently using this bound energy
  to fix CO2 into organic carbohydrates via the CBC. Enzyme abbreviations are color
  coded according to their inferred evolutionary origin; see the key. (b) Stoichiometric
