caption: A. The Hippo pathway (mammalian) consists of the core components STK3 and
  STK4, SAV, LATS1 and 2, MOB1A and B, YAP, TAZ, and TEAD. Upon activation of the
  canonical Hippo pathway, STK3/4 phosphorylates and activates Lats1/2, which subsequently
  phosphorylates cytoplasmic Yap. During homeostasis, Hippo signaling is ON resulting
  in Yap phosphorylation (S112 in mice, S127 in humans) causing 14-3-3 binding and
  cytoplasmic sequestration. Phosphorylation of Yap can also lead to proteasomal degradation.
  When Hippo is off, YAP (in the unphosphorylated for) translocates to the nucleus
  and binds to the TEAD family of transcription factors, leading to the transcription
  of genes involved in cell survival, growth, and proliferation. Proposed cell activities
  for each state are found beneath the gene in italics. Arrows indicate positive relationships,
  while bars indicate negative activity.B. YAP activity at various levels and for
  various time periods differentially modulates cell state and phenotype.C. Multiple
  physiologic and pathologic inputs modulate YAP activity. Mechanical stress, cell
  polarity, and cell density are all factors that have been shown to modulate Yap
  activity. Additionally, knowledge of these different states is communicated via
  various signaling modalities, including the aforementioned canonical Hippo pathway,
  the Wnt pathway, GPCRs, and changes in cytoskeletal tension.
