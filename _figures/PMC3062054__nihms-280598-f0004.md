caption: 'A scheme showing the major therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking growth
  factor signaling in cancer. The strategies include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
  against the GFs and their receptors, soluble receptors (TRAPs): small molecule tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors (TKIs), blockers of heat shock proteins (HSPs), antagonists of
  specific signaling pathway proteins, as well as inhibitors of histone deacetylases
  (HDACs) and methyl-transferase (MTase). Also represented are cytotoxic treatments.
  Examples of drugs are shown in yellow boxes; therapeutic agents that were approved
  for clinical use are highlighted in red, and targets are shown in parentheses. See
  details of signaling pathways in .'
