caption: The immunological functions of STING/TBK1/IRF3 alternatively spliced isoforms
  in response to viral infection. tSTING-mini induces antiviral response after RNA
  virus infection by binding to tMDA5-tLGP2. Moreover, tSTING-mini strongly interacts
  with tIRF3 and promotes phosphorylation of tIRF3 without tTBK1. Except for tSTING-mini,
  the other spliced isoforms displayed in the figure negatively regulate IFN response
  by distinct mechanisms. E7-less hSTING isoforms promote the degradation of STING
  through the proteasome pathway. MRP also inhibits IFN response by disrupting the
  STING-TBK1 interaction. STING-β can block the interaction between STING and cGAMP
  or TBK1. TBK1s binds to RIG-I to block the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS upon
  Sendai virus infection. TBK1_tv1, TBK1_tv2 and TBK1_tv3 disrupt the formation of
  TBK1-IRF3 complexes by competitively binding to TBK1 and IRF3. In addition, TBK1_tv3
  induces TBK1 and IRF3 degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and
  lysosome pathway, respectively. Moreover, IRF3a can form a heterodimer with IRF3,
  which may prevent the binding of IRF3 to the IFN-β promoter. IRF-3e maintains the
  ability to bind to DNA and compete with IRF3 for binding to the IFN-β promoter.
  IRF3-nirs3 competes with IRF3 to bind to the IFN-β promoter sequence. IRF3-CL inhibits
  the shuttling of IRF3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. mIRF-3a binds to the IFN-β
  promoter and consequently inhibits the transcription of the IFN-β gene. The mechanism
  for IRF-3c (3f) to reduce the transactivation of the IFN-β promoter remains unclear.
  Additionally, IRF-3b (3d) has no significant effect on IFN response.
