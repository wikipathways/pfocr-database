caption: Proposed model of the effect of crocetin on cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation
  and fibrosis. Crocetin blocks the production of ROS induced by hypertrophic stimulant
  and leads to the inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. In this study,
  we have shown that the inhibitory effects of crocetin are achieved by blocking ROS-dependent
  three proposed signalling pathways. First, increased level of ROS leads to signalling
  through the IKKβ/p65/NF-κB pathway, promoting cytokine expression and leading to
  inflammation. Second, increased ROS level may also activate MEK-ERK1/2-dependent
  GATA-4 activation, activate ANP and BNP expression and subsequently lead to cardiac
  hypertrophy. Third, ROS is shown to promote the Smad signalling pathway by activation
  of MEK-ERK1/2 signalling. Subsequent expression of fibrosis markers CTGF, collagen
  (Col) I and Col II leads to collagen synthesis and fibrosis. Crocetin blocks all
  of the proposed ROS-dependent signalling pathways and then protects against cardiac
  hypertrophy, inflammation and fibrosis and the progression of heart failure.
