caption: Besides the well-characterized regulation of protein synthesis and autophagy
  by mTORC1, mTOR also forms a plasma membrane-localized, functionally segregated
  and rapamycin-insensitive complex called mTORC2, which controls cytoskeletal organization
  pathways and coordinates cell survival with cellular metabolism. mTORC2 is also
  a key activator of protein kinase Akt, which inhibits TSCC and therefore activates
  mTORC1 through Rheb. On the lysosome, the Ragulator complex interacts with several
  lysosomally-localized proteins, including the v-ATPase, SLC38A9, NPC1 and BORC complex,
  coordinating wider metabolism and lysosomal biogenesis and positioning to mTORC1
  signaling. Additionally, the FLCN-FNIP complex also regulates lysosome positioning
  through interaction with Rab-RILP complexes. The GATOR2 complex interchanges subunits
  with the NPC and COPII vesicle coat, and alongside KICSTOR, which also features
  similar architectures, may have roles in lysosome-endosome and/or lysosome-autophagosome
  tethering and fusion. As recently determined, GATOR1 exhibits two modes of interaction
  with RagA/B and this interplay may endow the Rag signaling axis with unique properties.
  Finally, the Rag and Rheb GTPases both feature GAPs, and there is evidence supporting
  the role of Ragulator as a RagA/B GEF, however GEFs have not been conclusively identified
  for RagC/D or Rheb. The Rheb-GEF may localize to the Golgi, which is postulated
  to be the site of Rheb activation.
