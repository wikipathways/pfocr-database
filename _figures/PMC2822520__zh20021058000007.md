caption: Schematic representation of a working model for endosomal transport involving
  CLC-5 and KIF3B interaction in polarized cells. CLC-5 and KIF3B are expressed in
  polarized renal proximal tubular cells which reabsorb proteins and solutes via the
  receptor-mediated endocytic pathway that uses megalin and cubilin as the apical
  plasma membrane (APM) receptors (, , ). Ligands bind to these receptors at the APM
  where CLC-5 and interacting proteins Nedd4-2, NHERF2, and cofilin are also present
  (, , ). The receptor-ligand complex is internalized in vesicles, containing CLC-5
  and CLC-4 (), which are anterogradely transported along microtubules via the Kinesin-2
  complex (). These vesicles fuse with early endosomes where acidification involves
  the vacuolar H+-ATPase, with counter ions being provided by CLC-5 (). In nonpolarized
  cells, the orientation of the microtubules is reversed (), and CLC-5 vesicles would
  be transported to the cell surface.
