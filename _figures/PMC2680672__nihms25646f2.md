caption: Regulation mechanisms for Itch-mediated Th2 differentiation.TCR triggering
  plus CD28-mediated costimulation results in the activation of MEKK1-JNK signaling
  pathway, which induces the serine/threonine phosphorylation of Itch. This phosphorylation
  event causes the increase of Itch ligase activity and the subsequent ubiquitination
  and degradation of JunB, a transcription factor involved in the production of a
  Th2 cytokine, IL-4. On the other hand, T cell stimulation also activates the Src
  kinase Fyn and induces Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphosphorylation of Itch. Phosphorylation
  of Itch on the tyrosine residue inhibits the interaction between Itch WW domain
  and JunB, thus negatively regulating Itch-promoted JunB ubiquitination. Ndfip1 is
  a membrane-bound protein which may change the subcellular localization of Itch.
