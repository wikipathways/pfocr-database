caption: Ras signalling pathways. Ras transmits signals from receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTK) to the nucleus and regulate a diverse array of biological functions. Ras functions
  as a molecular switch, being inactive when bound to GDP and active when bound to
  GTP. Activated Ras acts by regulating the cellular response through distinct Ras
  effectors proteins and their complex signal transduction cascades, such as mediated
  by the Raf serine/threonine kinases, the lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3-K) and the Ras association domain family 1, RASSF1A. The best-characterised
  signal transduction pathway of Ras is by the Raf kinases. Activated Raf phosphorylates
  MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) and the activated MEK phosphorylates the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), which becomes activated and translocates to the nucleus where
  it phosphorylates a set of transcription factors. For example, the activation of
  Elk-1 leads to the transcription of Fos, which together with the MAPK-activated
  Jun, forms the activation protein 1 (AP-1), which has been shown to induce cyclin
  D1 and therefore stimulate proliferation. Another cascade of Ras-activated signalling
  is by anti-apoptotic PI3-K, which can stimulate the activity of the protein kinase
  B, Akt. Akt subsequently phosphorylates BAD, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-family,
  and thus inhibits apoptosis (inactivating BAD enables BCL to promote cell survival
  by blocking the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and therefore inhibiting caspase
  activation). Additionally, Ras regulates a pro-apoptotic pathway by binding to the
  Ras effectors NORE1 and RASSF1A and RASSF1A can also block cell cycle progression.
