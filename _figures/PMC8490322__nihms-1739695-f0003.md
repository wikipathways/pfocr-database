caption: Proposed mechanism of senescence-mediated bone pathology in Type 2 Diabetes
  Mellitus (T2DM). Mice treated with a high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ)
  develop classical symptoms of T2DM. In bone, increased advanced glycation endproducts
  (AGEs), such as CML, accumulate and contribute to AGE receptor (RAGE) pathway signaling.
  Additionally, accelerated senescence of osteocytes occurs in mice with T2DM. This
  is accompanied by a distinct senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) consisting
  of upregulated NFκB- and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-pathway signaling. This
  senescent phenotype, together with AGEs accumulation and RAGE signaling, induce
  inflammation in the bone and are proposed to lead to reduced bone quality in T2DM.
