caption: Gene association network (GAN) 3 in lung. The network was generated with
  791 BaP-significantly modulated genes by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). (A) shows
  28 BaP-modulated genes. The gene-gene interactions reveal that NFκb can be regulated
  by 10 genes (Ecsit, Gpam, Ddost, Cops3, Birc4, Otud7b, Nedd4, Ube2, Btrc and Rnf7)
  and it may regulate other 3 genes (Fuca1, Cyb5r3 and Ccnd2). It also shows that
  core genes NFκb and Ube give central roles for the network functions protein synthesis
  and post-translational modification. Up-regulated genes are shown in red; down-regulated
  genes are shown in green. (B) the descriptions of interactions and transcriptional
  factors.
