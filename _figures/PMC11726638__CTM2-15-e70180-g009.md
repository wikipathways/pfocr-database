caption: The diagram encapsulates our hypothesis that cytidine/uridine monophosphate
  kinase 2 (CMPK2) promotes the progression of allergic rhinitis by activating the
  NLRP3 inflammasome via the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)‐STING signalling pathway. Stimulation
  by house dust mite (HDM) results in the up‐regulation of CMPK2 expression and induces
  mitochondrial dysfunction, consequently causing the release of mtDNA into the cytoplasm.
  This release activates the STING signalling pathway, which subsequently leads to
  the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Inhibition of CMPK2 and the STING signalling
  pathway can significantly mitigate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby
  alleviating allergic rhinitis. cGAS, cyclic GMP‐AMP synthase; HDM, house dust mite;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species
