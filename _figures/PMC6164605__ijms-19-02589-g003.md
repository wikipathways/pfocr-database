caption: Regulatory network of C2H2-ZFPs in floral organ development. In the ABCE
  model of flower development, A class genes specify sepals in whorl 1; A and B class
  genes specify petals in whorl 2; B and C class genes specify stamens in whorl 3;
  C class genes define carpels in whorl 4. E class genes are active in all four whorls.
  SUP and KNU directly or indirectly repress WUS and terminate the FM activity. SUP
  can repress the expression of B function genes, AP3 and PI. SUP can repress YUC1/2
  and participate in floral organ development by affecting auxin signaling, whereas
  SUP may regulate CK signaling. KNU is directly activated by the C class gene AG.
  AG may repress JAG, whereas JAG further inhibits PTL, HAN, KRP2, and KRP4. Thus,
  JAG is a direct regulator of the cell cycle during floral organ tissue growth. RBE
  is involved in the MIR164–CUC regulation pathway. UFO acts on the upstream of RBE.
  RBE can also repress TCP4 and TCP5.
