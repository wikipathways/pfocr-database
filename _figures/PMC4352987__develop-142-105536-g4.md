caption: Different combinations of transcription factors drive tissue-specific gene
  expression in immature versus hypertrophic chondrocytes. The early steps of chondrogenesis,
  including mesenchymal condensation and the expression of chondrocyte-specific extracellular
  matrix proteins, are crucially dependent upon Sox-family transcription factors,
  including Sox9, Sox5 and Sox6 (; ). By contrast, the process of chondrocyte hypertrophy
  is regulated by Runx2 and Runx3 (; ; ), Mef2c and Mef2d (), and Foxa2/3 (). Both
  direct interactions and/or regulatory relationships between these and other transcriptional
  regulators are displayed. See text for details. Acan, aggrecan; Col2a1, collagen,
  type II, α1; Col10a1, collagen, type X, α1; Mmp13, matrix metalloprotein 13; Spp1,
  osteopontin/bone sialoprotein 1; VEGFA, vascular endothelial growth factor A.
