caption: The MAPK pathway has been invoked in phospholipase A2 activity that could
  release arachidonic acid, perhaps in concert with VEGF, and thereby amplify 20-HETE
  formation (). Other critical elements of CYP4:20-HETE cancer signaling include activation
  of PI3K/Akt (), as well as roles for HIF-1α and reactive oxygen species (ROS) ().
  Very recently, Zeldin and coworkers generated a CYP4F2 transgenic mouse with selective
  endothelial cell expression (). Endothelial cells from transgenic animals exhibited
  twofold increases in levels of 20-HETE, increased growth and tube formation with
  upregulation of VEGF and the prooxidant enzyme NADPH oxidase, further underlining
  the importance of the MAPK pathway and ROS in cellular proliferation.  attempts
  to capture essential elements of the complex signaling pathways of CYP4:20-HETE
  in cancer progression. More detailed mechanistic proposals can be found in two excellent
  recent reviews (; )
