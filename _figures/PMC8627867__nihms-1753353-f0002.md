caption: Mechanisms of CCF formation. Loss of Lamin B1, through nuclear autophagy
  and possibly other mechanisms, contributes to the loss of nuclear membrane integrity
  and facilitates formation of CCF. Mitochondria are involved in the formation of
  CCF via production of mtROS, which activates the JNK1/2 signaling pathway. In the
  nucleus, 53BP1 acts as a suppressor of CCF formation, potentially by inhibiting
  MRE11-dependent resection of double strand DNA breaks. CCF are characterized by
  several markers including DNA damage marker γH2AX, heterochromatin marker H3K27me3,
  topoisomerase 1 cleavage complex (TOP1cc) which enhances DNA binding to cGAS, and
  nuclear lamina protein Lamin B1.
