caption: 'Downstream signaling pathway of TLRs. TLRs are type I integral membrane
  glycoproteins characterized by the extracellular (or the extraendosomal) domains
  and a cytoplasmic signaling domain. TLRs share a common structural framework in
  their extracellular ligand-binding domains. These domains, formed by varying numbers
  of leucine-rich-repeat motifs, all adopt horseshoe-shaped structures. After ligand
  binding, two extracellular domains form an “m”-shaped dimer sandwiching the ligand
  molecule, bringing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains into close proximity
  and triggering a downstream signaling cascade. After ligand-induced dimerization,
  the cytoplasmic signaling domain associates with adaptor molecules to transmit signaling.
  Six adaptor proteins have been identified: MyD88, MAL, TRIF and TRAM are recruited
  to TLR cytoplasmic domains to initiate signaling, whereas SARM and BCAP inhibit
  TLR responses. All TLRs, except for TLR3, associate with MyD88 and MAL proteins.
  Otherwise, TLR3 and TLR4 use a TRIF-dependent pathway. Both the MyD88-dependent
  and TRIF-dependent pathways lead to the activation of downstream molecules: NF-κB,
  AP-1, and members of the IRF family. These pathways are responsible for the TLR-mediated
  expression of inflammatory genes, type I, type II and type III IFN genes and interferon
  stimulated genes (ISGs). MyD-88, myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88;
  MAL, MyD88-adaptor-like protein; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing
  interferon-β (IFNβ); TRAM, TRIF-related adaptor molecule; SARM, sterile α- and armadillo-motif-containing
  protein; BCAP, B-cell adaptor for PI3K; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; AP-1, activating
  protein-1; and IRF, IFN-regulatory factor. Created with BioRender.com.All nine members
  of the IRF family have a conserved amino-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) [30,31,32,33,34,35]
  that recognizes the consensus DNA sequence element ISRE [36] in the gene promoters
  of IFNs and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) genes [37]. These cytokines, in turn,
  activate antimicrobial and proinflammatory activities, as well as the maturation
  of antigen-specific adaptive immune responses. IRF3, IRF5 and IRF7 are primarily
  responsible for the activation of type I IFN genes downstream of TLR activation,
  although IRF1 and IRF8 can also contribute [37]. IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and IRF8 also
  induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, CCL5/RANTES,
  CXCL10 or CCL2, and other genes in response to TLR activation [38].'
