caption: Structure of the Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1 relay and the HOG MAPK pathway. Under normal
  growth conditions, Sln1 activates Ypd1, which in turn inhibits Ssk1. Increased osmolarity
  inhibits Sln1, resulting in activation of Ssk1 and of the MAP kinase Hog1 through
  the upstream MAP3Ks Ssk2 and Ssk22 and the MAP2K Pbs2. Activated Hog1 regulates
  transcriptional and metabolic changes within the cell that increase production and
  retention of glycerol.

  prevents unintended activation of the HOG MAPK pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
