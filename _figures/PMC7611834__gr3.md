caption: Proposed mechanisms for IL-6-sustained hypofunctional Treg state in psychosis.We
  summarise mechanisms through which IL-6 might interfere with the immunosuppressive
  function of Tregs in psychosis (for references, see the main text). a) The IL-6
  pro-inflammatory pathway, named trans-signalling, is formed by IL-6 bound to its
  naturally occurring soluble receptor (sIL-6). The IL-6/sIL-6 complex associates
  with two molecules of the transmembrane signal transducer glycoprotein (gp130),
  activating the JAK/STAT3 pathway. b) It has been shown that subpopulations of human
  Tregs that are hypofunctional to suppress inflammation and related cellular mediators
  express more gp130; this renders more plasticity to Tregs, turning them more prone
  to FoxP3 destabilisation upon IL-6/sIL6R biding and conversion to pathogenic T cells
  under inflammatory conditions. c) IL-6 trans-signalling upregulates the expression
  of SMAD7, a negative regulator of TGF-β signalling, which inhibits the expression
  of FoxP3 and the generation of functional Foxp3+ Tregs. d) Complete demethylation
  of the conserved non-coding sequence 2 (CNS2), a CpG-rich island in the FoxP3 locus
  (also known as Treg cell-specific demethylated region), is crucial to Treg stability
  and suppressive function. IL-6-STAT3 induces CNS-2 methylation, resulting in FoxP3
  destabilisation. e) Hypofunctional Tregs are deficient in expressing molecules that
  are implicated in their functional capacity, such as CD25, TNFR2, GARP, CTLA-4,
  and the adenosine-producing ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 (see also  in the main text);
  adenosine is a potent anti-inflammatory molecule. The hypofunctional Treg state
  restrains the regulation of pro-inflammatory innate and adaptive forces. f) By inhibiting
  or destabilising FoxP3 expression, mechanisms c and d skew the T cell fate towards
  pathogenic T cells, triggering the expression of RORc, the Th17-transcriptional
  factor that is the polar opposite to FoxP3+ Treg differentiation. Such IL-6-induced
  FoxP3 destabilisation mechanisms are also likely relevant in naïve T cells, culminating
  in a self-sustaining state of mild peripheral immune activation with less generation
  of new competent Tregs. Figure adapted from.
