caption: BDNF-Stem cell-Nano delivery system. In the case of brain inflammation or
  brain damage, it will induce the pro-inflammatory activation of NF-kB-dependent
  microglia and release toxic mediators, such as ROS and RNS, TNF, IL-1β, etc. The
  BDNF signaling pathway in the synaptic space will be reduced. BDNF-nano delivery
  system released BDNF and BDNF induced the expression of NF-κB and stimulates PLC-γ/PKC
  signal by activating IKKα and IKKβ kinases. These kinases phosphorylate the NF-κB
  inhibitory unit IκBα, leading to ubiquitin binding and subsequent degradation of
  IκBα through the proteasome. IκBα degradation induced the release of NF-κB and the
  formation of p50/p65 dimers, which bind to DNA and induced the expression of genes
  related to neuronal proliferation and differentiation
