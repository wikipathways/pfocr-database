caption: Rac and Ras cooperate to activate Raf, while Rac stimulates the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. In addition, complement-bound CR3 () activates Lyn, which leads to the
  activation of PI3K and the accumulation of PIP3 at the immunological synapse. PIP3,
  recruits positive (Vav) and negative (GAP) regulators of Ras and Rac to the immunological
  synapse. (In this simplified model active Raf serves as a proxy for active ERK,
  as explained in the text. Red arrows denote inhibition, black arrows denote stimulation.)
