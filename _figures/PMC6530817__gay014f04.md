caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the relationship between vitamin D and AGEs
  in follicular fluid and human luteinized granulosa cells. A positive correlation
  exists between follicular fluid 25-hydoxyvitamin D (25-OHD) and follicular fluid
  sRAGE, which inhibits the circulating AGEs from activating their pro-inflammatory
  RAGE signaling pathway. AGEs affect steroidogenesis by upregulating luteinizing
  hormone receptor (LHR), which is known to induce steroidogenic acute regulatory
  protein (StAR) and P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1). AGEs also upregulate
  17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (CYP17A1) and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD)
  ultimately leading to more production and release of estradiol. Upward green arrows
  indicate upregulation by AGEs. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vit D3) downregulates RAGE
  expression and inhibits the effect of AGEs on LHR, StAR, CYP11A1 and CYP17A1, but
  not the effects on 3β-HSD.
