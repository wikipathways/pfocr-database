caption: Shared immunopathologic mechanisms of the atopic march. Environmental factors
  (i.e., food, aeroallergens, infections) and the related tissue damage can stimulate
  the epithelium to release alarmins such as IL-33, IL-25 and TSLP. Alarmins, in turn,
  activate both ILC2 and DCs which drive naïve T cells toward a Th2 differentiation
  and production of IL-5, IL-4 and IL-13. IL-5 promotes eosinophils activation and
  degranulation, whereas IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate the release of eotaxin-3 by epithelial
  cells. Eotaxin-3 together with IL-5, ultimately lead to eosinophils recruitment,
  activation, and degranulation. IL-4/IL-13 also promote DC activation, M2 macrophage
  polarization, IgE class switching by activated B cells and consequently MC and basophils
  degranulation. Cytotoxic proteins released by granulocytes lead to tissue damage,
  barrier dysfunction and epithelial remodeling. Finally, IL-4/IL-13 stimulated release
  of TGFβ1, in synergy with eotaxin-3, promote fibroblast activation and differentiation
  into myofibroblast, ultimately leading to ECM deposition and smooth muscle cells
  reduced contractility. Dupilumab, by binding to IL-4Rα, can inhibit the activation
  of the JAK/STAT6 signaling pathway by IL-4 and IL-13, thus blocking the aforementioned
  downstream inflammatory processes. EO, eosinophils; DC, dendritic cells; M2, M2
