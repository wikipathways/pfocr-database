caption: Model for the activation of immediate-early genes and the HDAC1 gene by histone
  H3 phosphoacetylation. (A) One-step model for immediate-early genes. The default
  state of these genes favors acetylation. Activation of the MAP kinase pathway by
  either growth factors or pharmacological agents like anisomycin leads to the rapid
  and transient phosphoacetylation of histone H3 and simultaneous activation of immediate-early
  gene transcription. The mechanisms to turn off gene expression are not yet elucidated
  but might involve deacetylation and dephosphorylation of histone H3. (B) Two-step
  model for the HDAC1 gene. Due to the presence of deacetylases, the default state
  of this gene favors deacetylation. Induction of the nucleosomal response can induce
  histone H3 phosphorylation but not phosphoacetylation at the promoter. In a second
  step, the local balance between deacetylases and acetylases is changed either by
  inhibition of HDACs by TSA or by dissociation of deacetylases in response to growth
  signals. Both mechanisms result in phosphoacetylation of histone H3 at the HDAC1
  gene locus. HATs might already be present but dominated by HDACs or specifically
  recruited. Active HATs prevent dephosphorylation of serine 10, thereby stabilizing
  the phosphoacetylation mark on histone H3. This mechanism would ensure transcription
  for as long as the cells proliferate.
