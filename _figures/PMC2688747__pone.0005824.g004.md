caption: Amputation of the caudal fin triggers wnt10a expression which then activates
  fgf20 in a β-catenin-dependent mechanism . Fgf signalling (most likely through FgfR1)
  activates the expression of the chemokine sdf1 and its receptors cxcr4a and b, and
  then inhibits cxcr7 expression. In return Sdf1a exerts a negative feedback on fgf20a
  expression in parallel to Wnt5b. We propose that as soon as the level of Fgf20a
  protein decreases, this allows cxcr7 expression, Cxcr7 subsequently down regulating
  fgf20a in parallel to Wnt 5b. In this context the SDF1 pathway amplifies the negative
  regulation of fgf20a expression. In summary, Sdf1 thus plays two roles in fin regeneration.
  First it mediates Fgf activity to promote proliferation of epithelial cells , second
  it subsequently switches off Fgf activity by down regulating fgf20 expression.
