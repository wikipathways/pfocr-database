caption: (A) In wild-type testes, UPD is expressed in hub cells (green) and activates
  JAK/STAT signaling in adjacent germline stem cells (GSC, dark pink) and cyst progenitor
  stem cells (CPC, blue). SOCS36E, a target and inhibitor of the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway, functions specifically in the CPCs. Asymmetric division of the GSC produces
  a gonialblast (GB, light pink) that undergoes four rounds of mitotic divisions with
  incomplete cytokinesis to form 2, 4, 8, and 16 interconnected germ cells (light
  pink) surrounded by 2 cyst cells (light blue).(B) In a socs36E mutant testes, GSCs
  are actively displaced by CPCs in the niche due to a specific increase in integrin
  levels (yellow) at the interface of CPCs and hub cells.
