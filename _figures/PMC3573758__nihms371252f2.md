caption: Crosslinking of FcεRI-bound IgE with antigen induces aggregation of two or
  more FcεRI molecules and activates the protein tyrosine kinases LYN and FYN. LYN,
  in turn, phosphorylates the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs)
  in FcεRI and activates the protein tyrosine kinase SYK (after SYK has bound to an
  ITAM). FYN phosphorylates the adaptor GAB2, activating the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
  kinase (PI(3)K) pathway. LYN and SYK phosphorylate many adaptor molecules (such
  as LAT, not shown) and enzymes, thereby regulating the activation of the RAS–MAPK
  (mitogen-activated protein kinase), phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) and PI(3)K pathways,
  as well as other pathways. (LYN also can negatively regulate FYN activity.) The
  RAS–MAPK pathway — a protein-kinase cascade that involves RAS, RAF, MEK and ERK
  — activates transcription factors (thereby regulating the synthesis of protein mediators)
  and activates PLA2, which participates in arachidonic acid metabolism (thereby regulating
  the production of lipid-derived mediators). PLC-γ activation regulates calcium (Ca2+)
  responses, by generating inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), and protein kinase
  C (PKC) activation, by generating diacylglycerol (DAG). The PI(3)K product phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) is an important lipid mediator that regulates the formation of
  other lipid mediators, such as DAG and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and the activity
  of various enzymes, such as Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and AKT. FcεRI can be
  induced to co-aggregate with FcγRIIB (a low-affinity receptor for IgG), for example
  when IgE and IgG1 are bound to the same antigen. This process inhibits FcεRI signalling
  events, and therefore mast-cell activation and product secretion, through the LYN-mediated
  phosphorylation of the FcγRIIB ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif)
  and the recruitment of the inositol phosphatase SHIP1 (which catalyses the hydrolysis
  of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to PtdIns(3,4)P2) (not shown). Some arrows do not indicate direct
  interactions or targets. NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; SPHK1, sphingosine kinase 1.
