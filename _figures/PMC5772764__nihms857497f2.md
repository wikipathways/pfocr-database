caption: Synthesis pathway for catecholamines dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine
  are depicted here with enzymes responsible for each step as well as known inhibitors
  of these enzymes. Dopamine will then bind to one of five dopaminergic receptors
  (D1 to D5) at the nerve ending. Norepinephrine and epinephrine will then bind one
  of four adrenergic receptors (α1, α2, β1, or β2). A few known drug inhibitors of
  some of these receptors are also portrayed.
