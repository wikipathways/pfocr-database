caption: 'Summary of metabolic networks in iFermCell215. Metabolites with an asterisk
  are required for biomass production. Open hexagons indicate consumption of ATP (orange),
  NADH (green), NADPH (gray), and reduced ferredoxin (red). Closed hexagons indicate
  production of these compounds and consumption of ADP (orange), NAD+ (green), NADP+
  (gray), and oxidized ferredoxin (red). For reversible reactions, larger arrowheads
  indicate the reaction directionality corresponding with consumption and/or production
  of ATP, NADH, NADPH, and reduced ferredoxin. Dashed lines indicate multiple reactions.
  Key reactions are indicated according to the abbreviations used in iFermCell215
  (). Pathways are identified by number: (1) upper glycolysis; (2) phosphoketolase
  metabolism of fructose; (3) nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway; (4) phosphoketolase
  metabolism of xylulose; (5) glycerol utilization; (6) lower glycolysis; (7) gluconeogenesis;
  (8) pyruvate formate lyase; (9) lactate metabolism; (10) pyruvate flavodoxin oxidoreductase;
  (11) pyruvate dehydrogenase; (12) acetate metabolism; (13) ethanol metabolism; (14)
  incomplete citric acid cycle with glyoxylate shunt; (15) anaplerotic metabolism
  of phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, and oxaloacetate; (16) ATP citrate lyase; (17)
  propionate production via the acryloyl-CoA pathway; (18) propionate production via
  the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway; (19) even-chain reverse β-oxidation; (20) odd-chain
  reverse β-oxidation; (21) homoacetogenesis via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway; (22)
