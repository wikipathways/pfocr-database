caption: Proposed Model for the Crosstalk between Biotic and Abiotic Stress Responses.SAR
  is induced through the SA-mediated signaling pathway, which is activated by the
  HR to avirulent biotrophic pathogens. The ABA-mediated signaling pathway is activated
  by environmental stressors, such as salinity, drought, and, to some extent, by cold.
  Crosstalk between these signaling pathways, shown as broken lines, was shown to
  antagonistically regulate each other. Arrows indicate positive regulation, and blunt
  ends denote negative regulation. White arrows indicate the activation site of SAR
  signaling pathway by the chemicals BIT and BTH. Some genes functioning in the signaling
  pathways are also shown.
