caption: The role of pancreatic intestinal lung pathway in acute pancreatitis. This
  figure illustrates the progression of acute pancreatitis (AP), beginning with localized
  inflammation in the pancreas. Digestive enzymes become trapped in acinar cells,
  leading to oxidative stress, which subsequently triggers the release of inflammatory
  molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6),
  exacerbating tissue damage. As inflammation spreads, bacteria and endotoxins are
  transported from the pancreas into the bloodstream and lungs, further amplifying
  the damage and potentially leading to complications such as acute lung injury (ALI)
  or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Moreover, inflammatory mediators
  stimulate macrophages to differentiate into the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, which
  exacerbates the inflammatory response. The figure underscores the interconnectedness
  of the pancreas, intestines, and lungs in the pathogenesis of AP, illustrating how
  the systemic inflammatory response unfolds
