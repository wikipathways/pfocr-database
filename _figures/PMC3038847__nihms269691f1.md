caption: (A) The alpha (α) and beta (β) conformations of Bu4ManNAc (1) are shown;
  throughout this study an ~1:10 α:β anomeric mixture was used. Extra- or intra-cellular
  esterases hydrolyze n-butyrate from 1 producing 3,4,6-O-Bu3ManNAc (2), a compound
  with anticancer activities that include induction of apoptosis [] and suppression
  of pro-invasive oncogenes [], or 1,3,4-O-Bu3ManNAc (3), a compound that supports
  high level of metabolic flux through the sialic acid pathway with negligible toxicity
  []. Further hydrolysis of 3 into 4 (or other diacylated species) functionally inactivates
  the compound by dramatically reducing flux into the sialic acid pathway by reducing
  membrane diffusion (i.e., “md” in panel B). (B) Bu4ManNAc (1, panel A) is subject
  to serum clearance (“sc”) or degradation by extracellular esterases (“dee”); these
  competing equilibrium hinder membrane transport (“md”) and internalization of 1
  by the target cell. Encapsulation of 1 in poly(PEG-SA) (as poly(PEG-SA):1) reduces
  “sc” and “dee” thereby facilitating membrane transport. Once inside a cell, 1 can
  support cancer drug activity (“cda”) or be hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases
  (“hie”) producing ManNAc that is converted into sialic acid (e.g., N-acetylneuraminic
  acid, Neu5Ac).
