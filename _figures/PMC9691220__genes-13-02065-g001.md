caption: Overview of the HER2 signaling pathway. Unlike the other EGFR family of receptors,
  HER2 does not bind to any known ligands. Instead, HER2 is activated following heterodimerization
  with other activated EGFR family of receptors or by heterodimerization with activated
  HER2 receptors. Receptor dimerization leads to the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues
  and resultant signal transduction. PI3K/AKT, RAS/MEK/MAPK, JAK/STAT, and PKC are
  the most common signaling pathways through which several downstream cascades are
  activated, promoting numerous effects, including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation,
  angiogenesis, and invasion. Moreover, activated PI3K/AKT also leads to the degradation
  of cell-cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 and thus promotes cell-cycle progression. EGF, Epidermal
  growth factor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor; TGF, tumor growth
  factor; NRG, neuregulin.
