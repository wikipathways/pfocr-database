caption: 'Pathways promoting cellular plasticity in PCSCs. Top left: Immune cells
  are known to play an important role in CSC plasticity, with the production of B-cell
  activating factor (BAFF) by infiltrating B lymphocytes inducing EMT and enhancing
  the motility of pancreatic epithelial cells. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs)
  secrete the immune modulatory peptide LL-37, which enhances stemness and sphere
  formation. The secretion of Nodal/Activin and TGFβ-1 by CSCs stimulates further
  LL-37 secretion to generate a positive feedback loop. TAMs also secrete interferon-stimulated
  gene 15 (ISG-15), which enhances CSC self-renewal, pluripotency, and invasion. Bottom
  left: The tumour microenvironment (TME) influences CSC emergence, with the addition
  of TME cytokines to tumour cells resulting in the acquisition of stem cell characteristics.
  Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and oncostatin (OSM)
  all induce mesenchymal/CSC properties. Pancreatic stellate cells (PaSCs) are known
  to induce CSC properties in neighbouring cells, which could be mediated in part
  by the production of TGFβ. Right: Multiple signalling pathways evoke plasticity,
  including mTOR, sonic hedgehog (Shh), Notch, Wnt, and Stat. Family with Sequence
  Similarity 83 (FAM83) proteins have been shown to drive cellular transformation,
  with FAM83A driving PDAC cell survival via the MEK/ERK signalling pathway.'
