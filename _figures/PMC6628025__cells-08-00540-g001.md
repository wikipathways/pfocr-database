caption: Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are highly conserved transmembrane
  receptors consisting of three extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains,
  a transmembrane helical region, and a cytoplasmic region with kinase activity. The
  fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand and its cofactor heparin sulfate proteoglycan
  (HSPG) bind to FGFR monomers, leading to dimerization and tyrosine cross-autophosphorylation
  of the cytoplasmic domain. This induces various signaling pathways, resulting in
  cellular proliferation, survival, migration, angiogenesis, and cell fate determination
  in embryogenesis and in response to microenvironmental signals, including therapeutics.
  FGF/FGFR signaling can be stimulated in a paracrine manner, mainly in physiological
  settings, or in an autocrine manner as demonstrated in various cancers. In melanoma,
  FGF/FGFR signaling is largely suppressed by mutation-driven enhanced activity of
  the RAS (Rat sarcoma oncogene)/BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog
  B)/MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)
  pathway (red framed). Melanoma cells that acquire the ability to secrete FGFs and
  stimulate FGFR in a paracrine or autocrine manner can contribute to angiogenesis
  and cell-fate decisions involving transitions between different phenotypes, including
  phenotypes resistant to targeted therapies (grey framed). Dab, dabrafenib; DUSP,
