caption: Proposed model for OPG signalling events driving PAH pathogenesis. (A) Multiple
  stimuli including 5-HT, inflammation and reduced BMPR2 stimulate the expression
  and release of OPG causing an increase in intracellular kinase signalling leading
  to the activation of multiple genes associated with PAH. This induces a pro-survival,
  migratory, and proliferative phenotype resulting promoting pulmonary vascular remodelling
  and PAH. (B) Inhibition of OPG reduces kinase expression and normalises the expression
  of the altered PAH-associated gene expression to reduce the anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative
  phenotype and induce reverse pulmonary vascular remodelling to normalise pulmonary
  vascular resistance and PAH. The effect of OPG on TRAIL expression is unknown but
  unpublished research suggests additional links other than direct protein–protein
  interaction.
