caption: An Ingenuity pathway analysis containing about half of the genes in subfactor
  8 of Myc factor 6. Also included are 15 of the 16 kinase genes in the set underlying
  the expression signature of Finetti et al (2008) that is linked to poor prognosis
  in patients with Luminal type breast cancer (drawn with pentagons) and 6 genes added
  by Ingenuity by a pathway search (drawn with triangles). Finally, Myc itself is
  shown as a square in the center with incoming and outgoing edges as solid lines.
  The high density of known biochemical relationships between the genes in subfactor
  8 and the kinases in the Finetti et al signature suggest that this signature and
  Myc factor 6/subfactor 8 are measuring the activity of the same pathway.
