caption: 'Trypanothione pathway. a The figure shows synthesis of trypanothione from
  glutathione and spermidine in trypanosomatids. γ-GCS: γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase;
  ODC ornithine decarboxylase. b Trypanothione peroxidase pathway. Trypanothione is
  maintained in its reduced form by the enzyme TR which uses NADPH. The reduced trypanothione,
  T[SH]2 further reduces TX followed by reduction of the enzyme TP. TP catalyses final
  reduction of peroxides to water or alcohols'
