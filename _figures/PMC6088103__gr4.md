caption: AD genes selected by cross metrics analysis and their relation with other
  diseases. The 21 genes that were overlap in RScore, PScore and SScore groups are
  highlighted in green; Gene ITGB1 that was the overlap in AScore, PScore and SScore
  groups and is highlighted in yellow. The network was built using the ‘network building’
  module of Pathway Studio.
