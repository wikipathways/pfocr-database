caption: A reconstructed antioxidant regulation pathway of detoxifying proteins. Reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) such as electrophiles, drugs, xenobiotics and antioxidants
  can trigger oxidative stress that can damage cells. The Phase II detoxification
  enzymes detoxify the ROS to reduce cellular stress together with other enzymes that
  also scavenge superoxide to protect cells. Expression of these genes is coordinately
  regulated through antioxidant response elements (AREs) and ARE-binding transcription
  factors. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Nrf1 are transcription factors that bind
  to AREs of these genes and activate transcription. In the cytosol, Nrf2 remains
  inactive forming a dimer with the cytoskeletal protein Keap1. Protein kinases and
  Map kinases activate Nrf2 and phosphorylated Nrf2 is translocated into the nucleus.
  In the nucleus, Nrf2 interacts with transcription factors in the bZIP family, including
  CREB, ATF4 and Fos or Jun and bind to AREs to activate expression of genes involved
  in detoxification. Nrf2 activation of genes is counterbalanced by interacting with
  Maf proteins, including MafG and MafK, to maintain the oxidation level of the intracellular
  environment. Protein expression changes induced by lycopene treatment are indicated
  by red (repressed) or green (induced). Over-expression of EPHX1, SOD-1, CAT, and
  TF, the four lycopene induced proteins identified from our study, were illustrated
  by different shades of green nodes based on expression values of LNCaP cells listed
  in the . CAT expression represents cytosol expression from androgen-depleted LNCaP
  cells.
