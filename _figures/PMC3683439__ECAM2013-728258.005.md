caption: Schematic cartoon of KSG-002 effects on TNBC microenvironment. KSG-002 inhibits
  breast tumor growth and metastasis by blocking NF-κB-dependent TNFα production in
  macrophages. KSG-002 in our study inhibited TNFα production from macrophages through
  blocking NF-κB pathway, resulting in the suppression of tumor cell growth and metastasis.
  As TNFα is abundant in tumor microenvironment and produced from different types
  of cells, it still remains to elucidate whether KSG-002 targets other cell types
  producing TNFα. Interestingly, KSG-002 with TNFα caused breast cancer cell death,
  indicating that KSG-002 may sensitize cells to TNFα. Thus, KSG-002 seems to have
  pleiotropic roles in tumor microenvironment, while our present data demonstrate
  its role against macrophagic TNFα production in metastatic breast cancer microenvironment.
