caption: Dysregulated polyamine pathway in cancers. The red arrows indicate established
  pathways that lead to cancer metastasis and progression. Dotted red arrows indicate
  the recently discovered role of AZINs (AZIN1 to be specific) in cancer progression.
  A putative AZIN1-interaction with proteins from other pathways is shown, the dysregulation
  of which leads to multiple cancers. RNA edited mutant form of AZIN1 can also lead
  to cancers. The blue arrows indicate the tumor suppressor function of OAZ (OAZ1
  to be specific). The black arrows indicate a normal pathway.
