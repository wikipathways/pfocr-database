caption: Syk Activation. The globular representation of Syk shows the molecule in
  its autoinhibitory state with the COOH-terminal tail interacting with the inter-SH2
  domains thereby contributing to keeping the molecule in a closed conformation. The
  binding of Syk to the phosphorylated ITAM results in a conformational change that
  exposes the COOH-terminal region. This leads to the phosphorylation of two tyrosines
  in the tail, which then keeps the molecule in an open conformation allowing for
  further phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues mostly by autophosphorylation,
  although there could be contributions by other tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation
  of Tyr-130 in the inter-SH2 domain results in Syk dissociating from the ITAM.
