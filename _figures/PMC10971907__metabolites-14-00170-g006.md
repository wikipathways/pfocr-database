caption: The proposed mechanism of re-sensitivity to TKI by regulation of glutamine
  metabolism. (a) During TKI-sensitivity, In TKI-sensitive cells, VEGF signaling pathway
  can be controlled by TKI. (b) TKI cannot fully suppress the overexpressed VEGFR2
  during TKI-resistance in TKI-resistant counterparts, leading to a continuous activation
  of VEGF signaling. (c) When regulating glutamine metabolism by ASCT2 KD, re-sensitivity
  to TKI can be inducted achieved even after TKI-resistance, by the downregulation
  of VEGFR2, activation of PTEN and suppression of VEGF signaling
