caption: Extracellular vesicle biogenesis and cargo. (a) The schematic illustrates
  the synthesis of EVs (via endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)
  dependent or independent pathway), inside the cell that begins by inward budding
  of the plasma membrane. Early endosomes formed to take up cytoplasmic cargo that
  includes biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins that play a role in cell-to-cell
  communication. Multivesicular bodies, thus, formed containing a wide variety of
  cellular cargo, soon merge with plasma membrane releasing EVs. Cell-specific surface
  antigens are known to be tagged along in certain cases while EVs emerge from a cell.
  (b) The figure depicts the wide array of biomolecular cargo (both internalized and
  surface bearing) that EVs carry and exploited as markers in the characterization
  of tumors. Tumor derived EVs bearing numerous markers (as depicted) provide efficient
  noninvasive ways of LBs that offer real-time monitoring of tumor progression and
  treatment
