caption: A lipidomic view of prostaglandin H2(PGH2), anandamide (AEA), arachidonic
  acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and leukotriene B4 metabolism by functionally
  distinct, membrane-bound CYPs. The CYPs are organized into classes based on their
  primary metabolism pathway and are shown as colored ovals. The substrates of each
  reaction are shown on the left-hand side of the enzyme, while the products are shown
  to the right of the enzyme. (A) The prostanoid- and thromboxane-producing CYPs include
  CYP5A1 and CYP8A1. While CYP5A1 catalyzes the conversion of PGH2 to Thromboxane
  A2 (TXA2), a potent vasoconstrictor, CYP8A1 produces PGI2-the opposing vasodilatory
  metabolite. (B) CYP2C8, CYP2C9, andCYP2J2 display epoxygenase activity and can metabolize
  AA, DHA, and the endocannabinoid AEA to bioactive metabolites in a regioselective
  and enantioselective manner. (C) The CYP4F class consisting of CYP4F12, CYP4F2 and
  CYP4F3. In particular, they catalyze hydroxylation reactions to produce the hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acids (HETEs) and hydroxylated leukotriene metabolites, such as leukotriene B4.
  Although hydroxylation is the primary metabolic pathway for the CYP4F class, they
  have been shown to metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids such as AA.
