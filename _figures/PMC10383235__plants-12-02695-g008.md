  analysis by qRT-PCR of genes involved in their biosynthesis in leaves collected
  from ‘Ca. P. solani’-positive plants, expressed as fold change (FC) relative to
  ‘Ca. P. solani’-negative plants. Samples were collected in May, July, August, and
  September. The reported compounds detected by HPLC ESI/MS-TOF and the key biosynthetic
  genes and relative enzymes are in red. LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; UF3GT,
  UDP-glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase.
  Red lines highlight the 2-fold change to graphically identify genes upregulated
  in positive plants compared to negative ones. ANOVA results were reported based
  on their statistical significance. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001
