caption: (A) Higher-resolution version of  with gene target names visible. Largest
  contiguous portion of TF-to-target network for TFs that are down-regulated in OS
  vs. PS. (B) Higher-resolution version of  with gene target names visible. Largest
  contiguous portion of TF-to-target network for TFs that are up-regulated in OS vs.
  PS. (C) Longest paths in TF-to-gene networks. Pathways were found by observing the
  longest contiguous TF-to-TF pathways in the networks in A and B. Because RXRA, RARG,
  and the RXRA:RARG complex all independently appear in the network in A, and all
  target RARB, it was inferred that an RARG:RXRA complex is a part of this regulatory
  pathway. RARG:RXRA inhibition of EGR1 was inferred from manual literature curation
  ().
