caption: Details of unfolded protein response activation in the venom gland. (a) heatmap
  of inferred upstream regulatory molecule activity (top) and observed differential
  expression of genes involved in the unfolded protein response (bottom), (b) Diagram
  of the unfolded protein response pathway overlaid with observed patterns of differential
  gene expression in the unextracted venom gland relative to other non-venom tissues,
  with red indicating upregulation, blue indicating downregulation, and darker colors
  indicating a higher magnitude change in expression.
