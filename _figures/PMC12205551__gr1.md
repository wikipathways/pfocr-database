caption: The impact of the progesterone stress response on cellular metabolism. The
  genes (Δ7-reductase, CYP11A1, ADR, ADX and 3β-HSD) are heterologous genes overexpressed
  in the progesterone synthesis pathway, while the gene ERG5 (shown in red) needs
  to be knocked out for the pathway's expression
