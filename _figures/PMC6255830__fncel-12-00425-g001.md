caption: Detection of volatile pheromones on the antenna. (A) The antenna of insect
  carries numerous hair-like extensions of the cuticle termed sensilla. Olfactory
  neurons extend their ciliary dendrites into the sensillum shaft that is filled with
  sensillum lymph. A subset of sensilla house pheromone-responsive neurons (PRNs).
  Support cells associated with the sensory neurons produce pheromone-binding proteins
  (PBPs) and secrete large quantities of PBPs into the aqueous sensillum lymph. (B,C)
  Volatile pheromones entering the sensillum through cuticle pores are supposed to
  be taken over by PBPs that solubilize the mostly hydrophobic molecules in the lymph
  and transfer them to a given pheromone receptor (PRx). Different models have been
  suggested for insect pheromone signal transduction. Based mainly on results from
  studies using Drosophila melanogaster (; ), a purely ionotropic mechanism has been
  proposed (B). After reaching the dendritic membrane of a PRN, the ligand-loaded
  PBP is supposed to interact with the sensory neuron membrane protein 1 (SNMP1).
  SNMP1 acts as co-receptor mediating the release of pheromones from PBPs and the
  transfer to the PRx that forms a channel complex with the OR co-receptor (Orco).
  Binding of the pheromone to the PRx opens the channel complex leading to an influx
  of cations into the cell. In an alternative model (C) mostly based on data from
  moths, notably the hawk moth Manduca sexta (; ), a role of the PRx/Orco complex
  as primary transduction channel is challenged. Instead, pheromone binding to the
  PRx is supposed to activate a G protein (Gq)/phospholipase C type β (PLCβ) signaling
  pathway that via the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into
  inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) induces opening of several
  ion channels in the plasma membrane. The rise in IP3 rapidly opens a calcium-selective
  ion channel (CaC) evoking increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. This rapid
  rise in Ca2+ gates Ca2+-activated cation channels (CC) and increases the activity
  of protein kinase C (PKC). PKC is also activated by the rise of DAG. As a result,
  enhanced PKC activity leads to the opening of further CC.
