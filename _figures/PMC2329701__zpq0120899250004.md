caption: Schematic organization of a Cyanothece cell showing central metabolic pathways.
  Pathways are divided according to the diurnal period in which they are most up-regulated.
  Double arrows show pathways that involve reversible reactions. The percentage of
  up-regulated enzymes in each pathway is in red, with the percentage of all up-regulated
  isoforms in parentheses.
