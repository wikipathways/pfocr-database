caption: Neural immune regulation in the tumor microenvironment. Sensory neurons secrete
  CGRP, which acts through the RAMP1 signaling pathway, playing a role in both innate
  and adaptive inflammatory responses. Upon activation of the RAMP1 receptor, CGRP
  causes macrophages to release the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10,
  resulting in a reduction of effector CD8+ T lymphocytes. Adrenergic stress from
  sympathetic nerves leads to the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine, which
  promote the recruitment of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the Tumor Microenvironment (TME). This prevents an effective
  anti-tumor immune response, facilitating further cancer growth and progression.
  Some nerve fibers can express immune checkpoint molecules, such as programmed death
  ligand 1 (PD-L1), which, upon interacting with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1),
  leads to exhaustion of CD8+ T cells in the TME, thereby inhibiting the anti-tumor
  immune response. Acetylcholine can directly inhibit the production of IFN-γ by CD8+
  T cells and promote the shift from Th1 to Th2. Schwann cells (SCs) release chemokine
  (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), leading to chemotaxis and specialization of immunosuppressive
  M2 macrophages. Furthermore, SCs promote the recruitment and immunosuppressive function
  of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), contributing to cancer progression
