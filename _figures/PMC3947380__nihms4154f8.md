caption: 'Potential cellular response pathways of RPE cells upon AGE stimulation.
  The two main signaling pathways suggested by our data are the NF-κB pathway and
  the JAK-STAT pathway. Extracellular receptors that bind AGE known to be present
  on RPE cells include toll-like receptors (TLRs), receptors for advanced glycation
  endproducts (RAGEs), and advanced glycation endproducts receptors (AGERs). RAGEs
  and TLRs are mainly responsible for inflammatory processes within the cell and AGERs
  are important inhibitors of these signals. Supernatant data that support the two
  pathways are shown in purple retangles. mRNA data that support the pathways are
  shown in orange ovals. Studies from the literature that support the pathways shown
  include: 1, Vlassara and Striker []; 2, Chen et al. []; 3, Yang et al. []; 4, Kim
  et al. []; 5, Oeckinghaus et al. []; 6, Kato et al. [].'
