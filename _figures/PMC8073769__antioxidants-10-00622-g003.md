caption: 'Adipose tissue expandability: proposed mechanisms whereby impaired adipogenesis
  during AT expansion may link oxidative stress to insulin resistance (IR). The most
  accepted mechanisms implicated in the impairment of AT function during excess fat
  accumulation include impaired adipogenesis and adipocyte hypertrophy, followed by
  increased FFAs release and ectopic fat deposition, dysregulation of adipokine secretion,
  increased hypoxia and AT cellular stresses such as oxidative stress. These mechanisms
  contribute in concert to the establishment of a pro-inflammatory state in AT, interfering
  with the insulin signaling pathway and leading to peripheral and systemic insulin
  resistance. Via elevated ROS production, oxidative stress may further impair AT
  function initiating a vicious cycle between AT expansion and IR. Abbreviations:
  ER: endoplasmic reticulum; FFA: free fatty acids; UPR: unfolded protein response;
  JNK: Jun N-terminal kinase; NFkB: nuclear factor-kappa B.'
