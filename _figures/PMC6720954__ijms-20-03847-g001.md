caption: Upper, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) cleavage of protease-activated receptors
  (PARs) result in increased Ca2+signaling. MMP7 processing of tumor necrosis factor
  ligand superfamily member 6 (FASL) leads to decreased apoptosis. The right side
  displays MMP7 proteolysis on tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6
  (FAS), the CD95 ligand (FasL), and PARs, leading to decreased apoptosis and increased
  Ca2+ activation. Middle, MMP12 can cleave interferon-alpha (IFNα) and interferon-gamma
  (IFNγ) at the C-terminus, leading to the termination of the tyrosine-protein kinase
  JAK1-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (JAK–STAT1) signaling
  pathway. The right side displays MMP12 proteolysis on IFNα and IFNγ, leading to
  the decreased phosphorylation of STAT1, HLA class II histocompatibility antigen
  gamma chain (CD74), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Lower, MMP2 cleaves
  C-C motif chemokine 7 (CCL7), and MT6-MMP cleaves C-X-C motif chemokine 2 (CXCL2),
  resulting in decreased migration and Ca2+ activation. The left side displays MT6-MMP
  proteolysis on CXCL2, leading to increased cell migration and Ca2+ activation. The
  right side displays MMP2 proteolysis on CCL7, leading to decreased cell migration
  and Ca2+ activation. MMPs are depicted as yellow Pacman.
