caption: Figure 1.Combination chemoimmunotherapy for vascularized solid cancers using
  HSP90 inhibitors. Based on our published results we suggest the following paradigm
  associated with improved anti-tumor efficacy for combination chemoimmunotherapy
  using the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG. (1) Patients are treated with vaccines incorporating
  antigens differentially overexpressed by (tumor or stromal) cells within the tumor
  microenvironment (TME) or they receive adoptive transfer of autologous CD8+ T cells
  specific for tumor/stromal antigens; (2) HSP90 inhibitor is applied on a daily schedule
  for up to 5 consecutive days to condition the TME for “receptivity” to circulating
  T effector cells (based on vascular normalization and the removal of hypoxia and
  regulatory immune subsets); (3) In a coordinate manner, the tumor-associated vasculature
  may become activated (VCAM-1+) and CXCR3 ligand chemokine production is induced
  within the tumor stroma, thereby recruiting Type-1 VLA-4+CXCR3+ Tc1 into the TME;
  (4) By conditionally driving overexpressed client proteins into the proteasomal
  degradation pathway, HSP90 inhibitors allow for derivative peptide epitopes to be
  presented at high stochastic levels to moderate-to-low avidity, MHC class I-restricted
  Tc1 leading to the immunogenic death of tumor cells and tumor-associated stromal
  cells; (5) Secondary uptake of locoregional antigens by mature DC allows for the
  longitudinal cross-priming of an expanded therapeutic Tc1 repertoire that may again
  be recruited into the TME upon HSP90 readministration. VEC, Vascular endothelial
  cell.
