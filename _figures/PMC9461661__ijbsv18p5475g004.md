caption: The relationship between ferroptosis regulators and DUBs. Schematic overview
  of DUBs involved in the process of ferroptosis by regulating multiple signal pathways,
  including system xc--GSH-GPX4 pathway, lipid metabolism pathways and iron metabolism
  pathway. Moreover, PdPT, a pan-DUB inhibitor, could decrease GPX4 expression through
  inhibiting various DUBs.
