caption: Results on inference with gene expression data for cancer and normal samples.
  We could verify the activation of RB/E2F pathway in the normal network and the inactivation
  of it in the cancer network. The bold dashed arrows denote the incorrectly added
  edges. The bold solid arrows denote the correctly added edges (i.e., added edges
  that are included in the original network). Since directions of edges are ignored
  in comparison with ARACNE and GeneNet, bold dashed arrows connecting to P15 are
  regarded as correct in the evaluation of accuracy in .
