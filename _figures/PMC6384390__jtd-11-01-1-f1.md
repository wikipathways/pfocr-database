caption: Mechanism of Resistance towards EGFRi in Mesenchymal EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancer
  Cells towards EGFRi. EGFR-mutant lung cancers are constituted, to varying degrees,
  by tumor cells of predominantly epithelial phenotype, and lung cancer cells of predominantly
  mesenchymal phenotype. Cells with predominantly mesenchymal phenotype express high
  levels of the EMT transcriptional regulator ZEB1. ZEB1 binds directly to the promoter
  of the gene encoding the antiapoptotic protein B and represses its transcription.
  Low levels of BIM promote resistance to EGFRi and, possibly also to other antitumor
  drugs. Lung cancer cells with a predominantly epithelial phenotype express unrepressed
  levels of BIM and promote apoptosis towards EGFRi. BIM, BCL-2-interacting mediator
  of cell death; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGFRi, EGFR inhibitor(s);
  EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transcription.

  death (BIM)—an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated drug resistance
  pathway elucidated.

  description: Mechanism of Resistance towards EGFRi in Mesenchymal EGFR-Mutant Lung
    Cancer Cells towards EGFRi. EGFR-mutant lung cancers are constituted, to varying
    degrees, by tumor cells of predominantly epithelial phenotype, and lung cancer
    cells of predominantly mesenchymal phenotype. Cells with predominantly mesenchymal
    phenotype express high levels of the EMT transcriptional regulator ZEB1. ZEB1
    binds directly to the promoter of the gene encoding the antiapoptotic protein
    B and represses its transcription. Low levels of BIM promote resistance to EGFRi
    and, possibly also to other antitumor drugs. Lung cancer cells with a predominantly
    epithelial phenotype express unrepressed levels of BIM and promote apoptosis towards
    EGFRi. BIM, BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death; EGFR, epidermal growth factor
    receptor; EGFRi, EGFR inhibitor(s); EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transcription.
