caption: APP processing pathway and and domain organization of β-secretase. (a) A
  schematic representation of the sequential cleavages of APP at the β- and γ- sites
  to generate β-amyloid. APP and β-secretase are both integral membrane proteins with
  type 1 orientation, γ-secretase is probably PS 1, a protein with eight TM domains
  (not shown). Recent data indicates that these three proteins assemble in conjunction
  with Nicastrin, a protein which interacts with PS1, in cholesterol rich microdomains
  in cellular membranes. (b) The amyloid domain of APP showing the mutations which
  are associated with early onset familial forms of AD, highlighting those which occur
  at the secretase cleavage sites. The beginning of the TM domain is shown. (c) Domain
  organization of β-secretase. The protein has a cleaved signal peptide, a prodomain
  and a catalytic domain in which the catalytic aspartic residues are located. The
  catalytic domain shows the 3 di-sulfide bridges characteristic of the pepsin family
  of aspartic proteinases and is glycosylated at 4 sites. The cytoplasmic tail contains
  a di-leucine endosomal retreival signal, cysteine residues which are palmitoylated
  and phosphorylation sites. The homolog, Asp1 (DRAP, BACE2) shows the same overall
  structural organization.
