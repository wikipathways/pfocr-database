caption: Graphical summary. RNF43 is an inhibitor of the noncanonical WNT5A-induced
  pathway. RNF43 interacts with receptor complexes of the Wnt/PCP signaling and its
  enzymatic activity results in the reduced cells sensitivity to WNT5A (A). In melanoma,
  WNT5A promotes invasion and metastasis (B) as well as resistance to targeted therapies,
  including treatments with vemurafenib – inhibitor of commonly mutated BRAF kinase
  and cobimetinib-targeting activity of the MEK enzyme (C). RNF43 blocks melanoma-invasive
  properties via interference with the nonconical Wnt pathway, leading to the increased
  sensitivity to treatment (D).
