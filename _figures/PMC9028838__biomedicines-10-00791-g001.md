caption: Differentially expressed miRNAs in hepatic IRI. miRNAs that are upregulated
  in hepatic IRI are indicated by green upward arrow, whereas miRNAs that are downregulated
  in hepatic IRI are indicated by downward red arrow. miRNAs that regulate NF-kB signaling
  are connected to NF-kB. For instance, miR-450-5b, miR-370, miR-34, miR-497-5p, and
  miR-128-3p are upregulated and inhibit their targets, causing an activation of NF-kB
  pathway during IRI. Reversely, miR-146a, miR-194, and miR-142-3p are downregulated
  in IRI, and their corresponding targets are upregulated, resulting in activation
  of NF-kB pathway.
