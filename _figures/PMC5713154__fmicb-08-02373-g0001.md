caption: Cell signaling pathway scheme of metabolic alterations due to Zika virus
  infection. The scheme shows the cell response, attempting to control the viral infection,
  with Ang I or II, Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7 signaling to inhibit autophagy process, which
  would lead to decreased viral replication. It is also possible to see the close
  participation of lipids PI, PIP2 and PIP3 as key players in this process, all of
  which were elected as biomarkers. The scheme also shows the inhibition of AKT by
  the viral proteins of ZIKV (solid and dashed red lines), which culminates in the
  activation of autophagy, so that replication can occur. In a parallel mechanism,
  it is possible to see that the same pathway is responsible for the inhibition of
  neurogenesis. Ang I / II, Angiotensin I / II; Ang 1-9, Angiotensin 1-9; Ang 1-7,
  Angiotensin 1-7; MAS1, MAS receptor; PI, 1-Phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol; PIP, Phosphatidylinositol
