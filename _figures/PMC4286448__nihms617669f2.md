caption: Hypothetical model for the formation of localized domains of PI3K-Rac1 signaling
  that determine sites of neurite formation from the cell body. (a) This model is
  derived from studies of NGF-induced neurite formation from PC12 cells, for further
  details on this model please see the paper initially describing it by . The model
  is based on the activation of PI3K and the antagonistic phosphatase SHIP2 by NGF.
  Initially, PI3K driven increases in PIP3 levels at the membrane drive the activation
  of Rac1 by Vav. Rac1 then signals back to PI3K and SHIP2 through positive (PI3K)
  and negative (SHIP2) feedback loops. The diffusion coefficient of SHIP2 is greater
  than Vav, consistent with the requirement for the negative and positive feedback
  loops in the context of a Turing's reaction-diffusion system (). (b) The function
  of the mechanism in panel (A) is to drive the initially homogenous activation of
  the PI3K-Rac1 pathway (red) at the perimeter of the neuronal cell body into discrete
  domains of activation. The discrete domains are then able to locally drive the formation
  of neurites through the positive feedback loop, while suppressing formation elsewhere
  along the perimeter through the negative feedback loop.
