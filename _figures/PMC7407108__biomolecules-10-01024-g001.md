caption: 'Overview of the Hippo pathway. The canonical Hippo signaling pathway is
  a complex network of proteins: mammalian sterile 20-like (MST) kinases 1/2, the
  adaptor proteins Salvador homolog 1 (SAV1), large tumor suppressor (LATS) kinases
  1/2, Mps one binder kinase activator protein (MOB1), the downstream transcription
  cofactors Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and its paralog transcriptional co-activator
  with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ, also known as WWTR1). When Hippo signaling is on (shown
  in red), kinases MST1/2 and SAV1 complex, phosphorylate and activate kinases LATS1/2.
  LATS1/2 interacts with the adaptor MOB1 to phosphorylate YAP and its analog TAZ.
  YAP/TAZ undergo ubiquitination and degradation after phosphorylation. When Hippo
  signaling is off (shown in green), YAP/TAZ as transcriptional co-activators translocate
  into the nucleus and interact with TEA domain family members (TEADs) and other co-factors
  such as SMAD family members (SMADs), β-Catenin, pituitary homeobox 2 (PITX2), forkhead
  box protein O1 (FOXO1), T-box transcription factor TBX5 and Runt-related transcription
  factor 1/2 (RUNX1/2) to regulate gene transcription for cellular proliferation,
  regeneration, dedifferentiation, apoptosis and chromatin reprogramming. Transcription
  cofactor vestigial-like protein 4 (VGLL4) competes directly with YAP for the binding
  of TEADs in the nucleus [,,]. Hippo pathway activity also can be regulated by several
  upstream proteins such as kidney and brain expressed protein (KIBRA), neurofibromin
  2 (NF2), FERM domain-containing protein 6 (FRMD6), mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks), striatin-interacting phosphatases and kinases (STRIPAK),
  serine/threonine-protein kinase 25 (STK25), Ras-associated domain family 1 isoform
  A (RASSF1A), thousand-and-one amino acid kinases 1/3 (TAOK1/3), P2Y2 nucleotide
  receptor (P2Y2R), protocadherin Fat4 (FAT4) and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling
  (GPCR). PKA, protein kinase A; AMOTL1, angiomotin-like protein 1.'
