caption: Cell cycle regulation pathway was modified from KEGG and a knowledge based
  pathways about NRf2-mediated oxidative stress response and IL6 and NFκB were built
  in GenMAPP program (www.gennmap.org) (). Differential gene expression was based
  on treatment versus control expression change (1.5-fold and p<0.05, t test). Red
  indicates a higher level of expression in the treatment while green indicates decreased
  level of expression in the treatments. Grey indicates that the selection criteria
  were not met but the gene is represented on the array. As3+ induced significant
  alterations in NRf2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway in both p53+/+ and
  p53−/− cells (). P53-dependent down-regulation of cell cycle regulatory genes in
  p53+/+ such as Cdc25B, Cdc25C, Ccnb1, Top2A, Ccnb2, Plk1, Cdc2, Chek2 were observed
  (). Activation of Gadd45a and Gadd45g, Chk1, Topa/b in p53−/− cells were observed.
  As3+ induced a significant down-regulation in canonical NFκB signaling and IL6 pathways
  in the p53−/− cells (C).
