caption: Effect of ubiquitination imbalance on osteosarcoma cells and its clinical
  application. Aberrant expression of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes within the ubiquitin-proteasome
  system, as well as deubiquitinases, can disrupt ubiquitination and deubiquitination
  pathways, contributing to the malignant phenotypes of osteosarcoma cells, including
  proliferation, invasion, migration, and metastasis. By investigating the impact
  of these ubiquitin modification dysregulations on osteosarcoma, researchers have
  made significant strides in evaluating tumor prognosis, overcoming drug resistance,
  and inhibiting tumor progression. Together, these findings promote the development
  of osteosarcoma treatment, such as judging the prognosis of osteosarcoma, overcoming
  drug resistance, and inhibiting tumor occurrence. As illustrated in the figure,
  corresponding solid and dashed lines at the upstream and downstream of the signaling
  pathway indicate consistent activation or inhibition, respectively. The red line
  signifies a distinct process. Upon activation of the signaling pathway, expression
  or interaction of a downstream ubiquitin ligase is induced, subsequently influencing
  tumorigenesis. This effect is independent of the illustrated upstream signaling
  events
