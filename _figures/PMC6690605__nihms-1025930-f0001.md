caption: The PDAC TME is characterized by dense desmoplastic stroma and resultant
  hypoxia, which also drives angiogenesis, immune suppression, and numerous signaling
  events that promote cancer progression, metastasis, and poor patient survival.–
  The influence of hypoxia on stromal composition and secreted extracellular protein
  such as lumican is not clearly understood. Therefore, in our recent publication,
  our major focus was to investigate the extent to which hypoxia influences stromal
  expression and secretion of lumican in PDAC. We observed that hypoxia significantly
  reduced lumican expression and secretion from pancreatic stellate cells but not
  cancer cells. Our results revealed that hypoxia stimulates HIF-1α and AMP-regulated
  protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which leads to autophagy and subsequent reduction
  in cellular and secreted lumican (). We found that AMPK activation blocked the hypoxia-activated
  mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn inhibited lumican protein synthesis (). Therefore,
  the hypoxia-activated cell signaling event reduces the level of lumican production
  by stellate cells in the ECM of PDAC.
