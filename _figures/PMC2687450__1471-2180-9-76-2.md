caption: Schematic representation of the major metabolic pathways that are up- or
  down-regulated by heat stress at 48°C. The three letter designations for the enzymes
  involved in the heat stress response can be found in the KEGG web site for S. aureus
  N135 http://www.genome.jp/kegg/. When there are several genes within the same operon
  that are increased, then the three letter designation is followed by capital letters,
  which represents the different enzymes (genes). When the gene/enzyme is not definitively
  known, then the gene number in the N315 ordered sequence tag numbering is given,
  e.g., SA1336 for glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase. Arrows before the enzymes
  indicate significant increases (upward arrow) or decreases (downward arrow) in the
  transcripts or the key metabolic product that is produced by the pathway. All of
  the steps in the metabolic pathways are not shown, rather just key branch-points,
  so as to simplify the figure. Several important changes are shown at the bottom
  of the slide that do not fit into the central metabolism of the cell.
