caption: 'Schematic representation of the biosynthetic pathway of suberin in plants.
  The scheme is proposed based on previous evidence in the literature and shows all
  genes/enzymes listed in  according to their known enzymatic reactions. The scheme
  presents genes/enzymes involved in suberin polyaliphatic monomers (blue), suberin
  polyphenolic monomers (pink), suberin monomer polymerization (orange), suberin monomer
  transport (gray) and regulation of the suberin pathway (red). Dashed lines represent
  more than one enzymatic step, while question marks above enzymatic reactions indicate
  that genes/enzymes involved in these reactions are yet to be defined. Gene/enzyme
