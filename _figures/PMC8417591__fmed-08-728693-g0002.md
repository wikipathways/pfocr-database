caption: Biological properties and pathophysiological consequences of extracellular
  vesicles in sickle cell disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) partly cause the hypercoagulant
  and prothrombotic state known in sickle cell disease (SCD). m/lEVs generated in
  vitro from stimulated monocytes, RBCs or platelets are able to trigger thrombin
  generation through TF-dependent and TF-independent mechanisms. Intrinsic coagulation
  pathway activation by RBC- and platelet-derived m/lEVs relies on the exposure of
  phosphatidylserine at their outer membrane leaflet. EVs also contribute to the inflammatory
  state of SCD patients. m/lEVs produced in vitro from sickle RBCs can be internalized
  by monocytes leading to the secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines and can
  increase the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium. m/lEVs generated in vitro
  by sickle RBCs have been shown to promote renal vaso-occlusion in sickle cell mice
  and to induce endothelial cell apoptosis and ROS production. The high level of PS
  exposed at the surface of these vesicles, as well as their content in heme, could
  play a role in their deleterious effects on the vascular function. RBC-m/lEVs directly
  isolated from SCD patients' blood samples, promote the expression of adhesion molecules
  (ICAM-1, E-Selectin) and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by cultured
  endothelial cells. The endothelial activation mediated by these EVs involves the
  TLR4 signaling pathway. These proinflammatory properties are considerably reduced
  for m/lEVs obtained from patients treated with HU, which exhibit low PS externalization.
  In contrast, m/lEVs collected from patients during vaso-occlusive crisis exhibit
  high PS exposure and have deleterious effects on endothelial cells. RBC-m/lEVs could
  decrease NO bioavailability through their scavenging effects. In addition, both
  externalized PS and heme exposed by RBC-derived m/lEVs obtained using a calcium
  ionophore, have been shown to activate complement system on endothelial cell membranes.
  In humanized SCD mice, the stimulation of platelets leads to the release of sEVs
  highly loaded with IL-1β and caspase-1, which bind to neutrophils and promote platelet-neutrophil
  aggregation. VOC, vaso-occlusive crisis; NO, nitric oxide; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; HU, hydroxyurea; PS, phosphatidylserine; TF, tissue factor; TLR4, toll
  like receptor 4; Casp.1, caspase 1; PLT, platelets; RBC, red blood cells.
