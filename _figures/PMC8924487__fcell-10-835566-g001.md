caption: Role of EVs in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN).
  The schematic diagram represents how EV components including miRNA, lncRNA, tsRNA
  and proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE and LN. In serum, EV miR-451a
  is correlated with SLE disease activity and renal damage. MiR-146a could be internalized
  into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) via circulating EVs and participates in MSCs
  senescence in SLE patients by targeting TRAF6/NF-κB signal pathway. Serum EV miR-21
  and miR-155 expression present correlations with autoantibodies and proteinuria.
  Levels of serum EV tRF-His-GTG-1 could be used to distinguish SLE with LN from SLE
  without LN. In plasma, EV miR-574, let-7b and miR-21 activate pDC cells through
  the TLR7 signaling. MSC-derived EV tsRNA-21109 inhibits the M1-type polarization
  of macrophages. UNC93B1 can be detected in RAW macrophage-derived EVs, it can recruit
  syntenin-1 to suppress TLR7 signaling and prevent autoimmunity. Overexpression of
  BPI in T cell-derived EVs suppresses Treg differentiation and induces EV-mediated
  inflammation in SLE. ECP overexpression in T cell-derived EVs induces IFN-γ production
  and tissue inflammation. MiR-26a from urinary EVs can be used as a direct biomarker
  for podocyte injury. Urinary EV miR-29c, miR-150 and miR-21 promote renal fibrosis
  through SP1 and Smad3/TGFβ signaling pathway. Urinary EV miR-135b-5p, miR-107 and
  miR-31 could meliorate renal disease by inhibiting HIF-1α. MiR-146a from urinary
  EVs negatively regulates inflammation by suppressing the TRAF6 axis. MiR-3135b,
  miR-654-5p and miR-146a-5p in urinary EVs are candidate biomarkers for Type IV lupus
  nephritis with cellular crescent (LNIV-CC). Urinary EV let-7a and miR-21 may guide
  the clinical staging of LN patients. CP, a protein from urinary EVs, could be an
  early biomarker to diagnose kidney disease.
