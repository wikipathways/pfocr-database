caption: Overview of the three metabolic pathways modeled with machine learning methods.
  (A) Lower part of E. histolytica glycolysis pathway with pyruvate (Pyr) formation
  from 3- phosphoglycerate (3PG). The L-lactate (Lac) formation (dashed lines) is
  not part of the natural pathway; however, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has been added
  in order to experimentally follow the final flux and establish a quasi-steady-state
  to Lac (Moreno-Sánchez et al., ). Metabolite inhibitions are represented in red.
  PGAM, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase; 2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate; ENO, enolase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PPDK, pyruvate phosphate dikinase. (B) Tryparedoxin-dependent hydroperoxide detoxification
  pathway in Trypanosoma cruzi (González-Chávez et al., ). Reduction of cumene hydroperoxide
  (CumOOH) is assessed here. TryR, trypanothione reductase; T(SH)2, trypanothione;
  TS2, trypanothione disulfide; TXNox/red, oxidized/reduced tryparedoxin; TXNPxox/red,
  oxidized/reduced tryparedoxin peroxidase. (C) Simplified representation of the industrial-scale
  penicillin fermentation process of Penicillium chrysogenum. The bioreactor parameters
  represented here are those that will be of interest in this study. See a more detailed
  scheme in the work of Goldrick et al. (). Experimental details for (A,B) are provided
  in section Material and Methods.
