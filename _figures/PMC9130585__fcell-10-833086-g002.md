caption: Interplay between UPS/autophagy and signaling pathways in cilia dynamics.
  (A) UPS and autophagy inhibit ciliogenesis. The E3 ligase MIB1 ubiquitylates PCM1,
  TALPID3 and CEP131, targeting them to the proteasome, while ubiquitylation of CEP290
  by MIB1 prevents its binding to TALPID3, inhibiting the formation of DAVs. OFD1
  retains BBS4 at pericentriolar satellites and prevents BBSome assembly. Accumulation
  of KIF2C and CP110 at basal body, inhibition of acting remodeling by MYH9 and proteolysis
  of IFT20 by autophagy prevent cilium elongation. The inhibition of autophagy genes
  by the nuclear factor NR1H4 is indicated below. (B) Positive role of UPS and autophagy
  in ciliogenesis. Centrosomal TALPID3/CEP290/Rab8 complex supports DAVs formation.
  UBR5 ubiquitylates and targets CSPP1 to pericentriolar satellites. Multiprotein
  complexes assembled by PCM1, CEP131 and NEK10 at pericentriolar matrix contribute
  to cilium formation. SCF E3 ligase complex ubiquitylates and degrades Dvl2, destabilizing
  HEF1. Similarly, CUL3 ubiquitylates and degrades Trichoplein, thus inhibiting AurA.
  NPHP5 accumulates at centrosome forming complexes with centrosomal CEP290 and TALPID3.
  Pericentriolar OFD1 is degraded through the autophagy pathway, allowing BBS4 to
  relocalize at ciliary compartment. Similarly, autophagic degradation of MYH9 leads
  to actin remodeling underlying to axoneme formation. CP110 is also degraded through
  autophagy leading to axoneme growth. PPARα promotes the transcription of autophagy
  genes. In absence of Shh ligand (Shh off), SMO is ubiquitylated by an unknown ciliary
  ligase and transported out of cilium by the IFT27/BBSome complex. Here, SMO is ubiquitylated
  and degraded by the E3 ligase HERC4. SUFU sequestrates Gli proteins within the cilium.
  Following binding to Shh ligand (Shh on), PTCH1 receptor exits out of cilium and
  is degraded through autophagy. Transport of SMO within the cilium activates GliA
  proteins and induces Shh-dependent nuclear gene transcription. (C) Cilium disassembly
  induced by proteolytic machineries. NPHP5 is ubiquitylated and delocalized by BBS11
  or degraded by MARCH7. Phosphorylation of Dvl2 by Wnt5a stabilizes HEF1 and induces
  its binding to AurA. Localization of HEF1/AurA complex at basal body induces phosphorylation
  and activation of HDAC6. Following EGFR stimulation, USP8 deubiquitylates and activates
  Trichoplein which, in turn, stimulates AurA. Increase of cAMP levels by AC activates
  PKA. Phosphorylation by PKA primes OFD1 to ubiquitylation and proteolysis through
  a praja2-proteasome pathway. Similarly, PKA phosphorylates the pro-ciliogenic kinase
  NEK10, promoting its ubiquitylation by CHIP and consequent proteasomal degradation.
