caption: Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the resistance to therapy
  in cancer by methylation. The canonical Wnt/ß-catenin pathway is activated by the
  binding of Wnt to the Frizzled receptor (Fzd). Then LRP is phosphorylated by casein
  kinase 1 (CK1α) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) associated with tumor
  suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). LRP phosphorylation promotes the recruitment
  of disheveled proteins (DVL) to the plasma membrane, where they are polymerized
  and activated. DVL complex interacts with Axin, which inhibits the degradation of
  β-catenin and leads to its accumulation in the cytoplasm and translocation into
  the nucleus, where β-catenin promotes the activation of LEF/TCF transcription factors
  inducing the transcription of several genes. In the absence of Wnt, β-catenin is
  a target of the destruction complex conformed by Axin, CK1α, APC, and GSK-3β. CK1α
  and GSK-3β phosphorylate β-catenin, promoting its ubiquitination by the β-TrCP ubiquitin
  ligase and degradation through the proteasome. On the other hand, this figure shows
  some aberrantly methylated key genes that increase resistance to therapeutic agents
  and the dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These genes play an
  antagonist role in the Wnt pathway, for instance, Dickkopf-related protein (DKK3),
  secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRP1, SFRP2), and WNT inhibitory factor-1 (WIF1),
  which are tumor suppressor genes and inhibit the signaling of Wnt to bind LRP5/6
  receptors. , phosphorylation; ↑, increase; ↓, decrease,, methylation.
