caption: The relationship between autophagy and cytokines. Autophagy activation can
  promote or inhibit the secretion of cytokines to control tumor development. IL-1
  can induce autophagy by SAPK/JNK signaling pathway, and autophagy represents a negative
  impact on IL-1 production by inhibiting the interaction between TLR4, TLR3, LPS
  and ROS accumulation, resulting in NF-κB signaling pathway inhibition. IL-2 boosts
  autophagy induction by promoting ATG5-beclin1-HMGB1 complex formation, however,
  autophay suppresses NF-κB-mediated IL-2 production. IL-6 exerts anti-autophagic
  effects by activating p-STAT3 and reducing the protein levels of LC3-II and Beclin
  1, in addition, IL-6 promotes autophagy AMPK activation and mTORC1 inhibition, and
  Akt activation. Mutually, autophagy promotes the release of IL-6 by activating NF-κB
  pathway. IL-10 activates the JAK/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathways, resulting in
  autophagy inhibition. IL-12 induces autophagy through suppressing the AKT/mTOR/STAT3
  and PI3K/Akt pathways and activating AMPK pathway, and autophagy decreases IL-12
  release by inhibiting inflammation. IL-23 contributes to autophagy inhibition and
  ROS accumulation by triggering AKT/mTOR/NF-κB pathway, and autophagy decreases the
  production of IL-23, TNFα and IFN by inhibiting IL-1β-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway.
  TNF represses autophagy by decreasing lysosomal acidification, and autophagy inhibits
  TNF-α expression through blocking p38MAPK phosphorylation and TRAF6 expression.
  IFNs induce autophagy by activating JAK/STAT and JAK1/2, PI3K and p38MAPK pathways,
  and suppress autophagy by decreasing autophagosome formation and the expression
  of autophagy-related genes ATG5 and GABARAP. TGF-β has been demonstrated to activate
  autophagy by Smads and JNK signal pathways, but autophagy decreases mature TGF-β
  protein levels as a result of increased degradation. In this figure, IL-10 and TGF-β
  enhance tumor development, other cytokines suppress tumor development
