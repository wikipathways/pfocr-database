caption: Proteasome inhibition modulates multiple regulatory pathways to induce anti-tumor
  effect. Accumulation of unfolded and mutated proteins in cancer cells due to uncontrolled
  gene transcription results in ER stress leading to the activation of UPR pathway.
  Inhibition of NFkB pathway by inhibiting the degradation of IkB inhibitor results
  in inhibition of many pro-survival pathways that induce cell cycle progression.
  Stabilization of p53 results in expression of p21 subsequently inhibiting DNA replication
  by binding with PCNA and inhibits cell cycle progression by interacting with CDKs.
