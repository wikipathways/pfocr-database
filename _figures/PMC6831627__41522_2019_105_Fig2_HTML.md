caption: Amino acid metabolism and entry into the TCA cycle during biofilm growth
  is increased in RM33 biofilms. The pathways of amino acids that are associated with
  the TCA cycle were determined from the information provided for 86-028NP in the
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Biocyc Pathway databases. The
  concentration of amino acids within the biofilms of 86-028NP (circle) and RM33 (square)
  were quantitated as described in “Methods” section. The red X indicates absence
  of known orthologs of enzymes involved in the TCA cycle for 86-028NP. The enzymes
  encircled in purple are significantly increased in RM33 biofilms. The enzyme encircled
  in yellow is significantly decreased in RM33 biofilms. The concentrations of aspartate
  (pink cloud) and serine (green cloud) in the spent media were below the level of
  detection (indicated by the white highlight). pp periplasm, cyto cytoplasm. The
  mean and s.e.m. are depicted for each metabolite from three independent biological
  biofilms grown for 48 h. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed
  unpaired Student’s t test (*p < 0.036; **p = 0.004)
