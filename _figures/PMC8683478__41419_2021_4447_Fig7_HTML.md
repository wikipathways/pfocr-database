caption: Under normal conditions, Keap1 interacts with NRF2 and ubiquitinates it to
  degrade via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In response to oxidative stress, RPRD1A
  competes with p62 to bind TRIM21 and inhibits ubiquitination of p62 by TRIM21. The
  process releases p62 and causes its self-oligomerization, leading to the segregation
  and degradation of Keap1, which frees and stabilizes NRF2. Then, NRF2 translocates
  to the nucleus where it binds the antioxidant response element (ARE) and activates
  the transcription of antioxidant genes.

  with p62 for TRIM21 binding.
