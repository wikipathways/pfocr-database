caption: Following Caspase 3 (green) activation by initiator caspase proteins, Caspase
  3 is inhibited by the binding of XIAP (gray). SMAC (red), also known as Diablo,
  is released from the mitochondria as a result of apoptotic signaling, which then
  displaces XIAP-Caspase 3 interaction allowing for induction of apoptosis. In addition
  to Caspase regulation, XIAP is known to interact and regulate RIPK2 (cyan) in the
  NOD pathway of bacterial activation.
