caption: The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is a key regulator of primordial follicle
  activation. Granulosa cell-induced activation of the mammalian target of the rapamycin
  (mTOR) pathway stimulates the secretion of Kit ligand, which binds to its c-KIT
  receptor on oocytes, initiating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) cascade. PI3K
  catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3), recruiting phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) to phosphorylate and
  activate AKT. Activated AKT translocates to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates
  and inhibits the transcription factor FOXO3, leading to its nuclear export and suppression
  of its dormancy-maintaining functions, thereby promoting primordial follicle activation.
  AKT also phosphorylates tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2), further activating
  mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1, in turn, regulates downstream effectors such as
  S6 kinase (S6K), ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), and eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP), promoting protein synthesis, granulosa cell proliferation,
  and overall follicular development. Created with BioRender.com
