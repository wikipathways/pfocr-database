caption: A model for the role of Win1 in controlling the fission yeast stress-activated
  Sty1 MAPK. We propose that Win1 controls the activity of Wis1 MAPKK in parallel
  with the Wak1 MAPKKK and that the Mcs4 response regulator acts upstream of both
  Wak1 and Win1. We also tentatively suggest that the Wis1 MAPKK may be controlled
  by an additional Wak1- and Win1-independent pathway.
