caption: Impact of tumor and myeloid cell-intrinsic PD-1 on tumor progression. (A)
  The effect of tumor cell-intrinsic PD-1 on melanoma, liver cancer, and other malignancies.
  PD-L1 expressed by tumor cells or other cells acts on PD-1+ tumor cells to mediate
  PD-1 signaling in tumor cells via ITIM and ITSM. The Hippo pathway and phosphorylation
  of mTOR downstream effector molecules eIF4E and S6 can enhance tumor-promoting gene
  transcription and protein expression. Anti-PD antibodies can block the PD-1/PD L1-mediated
  tumor promotion independent of adaptive immunity. (B) The role of tumor cell-intrinsic
  PD-1 in lung cancer. PD-L1 expressed by tumor cells or other cells acts on PD-1+
  tumor cells to suppress tumor growth by dampening AKT and ERK signaling. Acetylation
  of p53 promotes gene transcription of PD-1. Anti-PD antibodies block PD-1/PD-L1-mediated
  tumor suppression, leading to hyperprogression in immunocompromised patients. (C)
  Effects of myeloid PD-1 on cell development, differentiation and function. (1) PD-1
  expression promotes common myeloid progenitors (CMP) differentiation into granulocyte/macrophage
  progenitors (GMP), leading to increased MDSCs in granulocyte lineages and suppressing
  the activity of anti-tumor CD8+ T-cells. (2) PD-1 suppresses M1 polarization by
  reducing STAT1 and NF-κB phosphorylation and promoted M2 polarization by increasing
  STAT6 phosphorylation. (3) PD-1 suppresses DC maturation, survival and co-stimulatory
  molecules expression, consequently downregulating antigen-specific T-cell activity.
