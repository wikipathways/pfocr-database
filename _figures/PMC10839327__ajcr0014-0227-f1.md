caption: Overview of cellular signaling mediated by 4E-BP1 (4E binding protein 1).
  The 4E-BP1 protein is encoded by the gene EIF4EBP1 (eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4EBP1). 4E-BP1 directly interacts with the eukaryotic translation factor
  4E (4E), which prevents completion of a multisubunit scaffold that aids in the recruitment
  of 40S ribosomal subunits to the 5’ end of mRNA. In response to mTOR (mammalian
  target of rapamycin) signaling following activation of the PI3K pathway (phosphoinositide
  3-kinase)/AKT pathway, the mTORC1 complex will phosphorylate 4E-BP1. The enables
  the release of 4E, which is now free to complete the multisubunit scaffold necessary
  to activate cap-dependent translation of mRNA. Ultimately, this facilitates a broad
  range of downstream effects resulting in cell cycling and tumorigenesis.
