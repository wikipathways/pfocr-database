caption: Model for the role of pol ζ in microhomology-mediated break-induced replication.
  In break-induced replication (BIR) a single-ended DNA break is repaired by extensive
  synthesis on the sister by pol δ. If the replication fork in BIR collapses, an alternative
  repair pathway called microhomology-mediated BIR (MMBIR) can be used. A proposed
  model for MMBIR involves looping of a strand, annealing to itself at a short region
  of homology (microhomology, MH), with pol ζ carrying out DNA synthesis from this
  MH-paired primer. The extended strand re-associates with the sister strand, annealing
  at a microhomology created during synthesis, and continues synthesizes using the
  sister template. This model was proposed by Sakofsky et al. ().
