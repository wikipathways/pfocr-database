caption: Network view of associated proteins created within Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  software for visualizing molecular interrelationships. (A) TNF-α and TP53, (B) SKAP
  and GFAP associated proteins. Coloring is based on the expression values that were
  uploaded with the dataset. Gray indicates the molecule was part of the dataset.
  Lines connecting molecules indicate molecular relationships. Dashed lines indicate
  indirect interactions; solid lines indicate direct interactions. The style of the
  arrows indicates specific molecular relationships and the directionality of the
  interaction.
