caption: The activation process of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and the regulation
  of the NFκB signaling pathway by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). In the
  resting state, NF-κB binds to the inhibitory protein IκBα to form an inactive trimer
  in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing its translocation into the nucleus. Upon stimulation
  by extracellular stressors, the inhibitory kappa Bn(IκB) kinase complex (IKK) is
  activated, resulting in phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα via the
  ubiquitin-proteasome system. This leads to dissociation of the trimer, allowing
  for nuclear translocation of the p50-p65 heterodimer that exhibits NF-κB activity
  and engages in gene transcription and protein synthesis. Several key components
  within the NF-κB pathway—including IκBα, NF-κB essential molecule (NEMO), P65, IKKα,
  and IKKβ—are subject to SUMO modification. The interaction between NEMO and SUMO
  facilitates the activation of IKK; similarly, SUMO-modified RAP1 enhances this activation
  process which ultimately promotes the degradation of IκBα and triggers NF-κB pathway
  activation. Additionally, the binding of annexin-A1 (ANXA1) or mesencephalic astrocyte-derived
  neurotrophic factor (MANF) to SUMO inhibits this pathway’s activation by interfering
  with key signaling molecules involved in NF-κB regulation
