caption: Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death pathways. Both pathways internal to RGCs
  and factors released from surrounding cell types contribute to the apoptotic cell
  death of injured RGCs. The signaling protein DLK is produced in injured axons and
  transported back to the RGC cell soma. There, it activates the intrinsic Jun/JNK
  signaling pathway, which regulates key genes mediating the cellular injury response.
  Among these, Jun activates BH3 proteins, which then interact with the cell-death
  protein BAX, triggering BAX translocation to the mitochondrial outer membrane. This
  results in release of cell-death promoting molecules including cytochrome C, which
  ultimately activate the caspases. Jun also activates the ER stress signaling molecules,
  ATFs, which contribute to intrinsic apoptotic cell-death pathways. Meanwhile, external
  to the cell, high levels of zinc (Zn2+) are released from amacrine cells, which
  synapse onto RGCs, contributing to RGC cell death. Additionally, the extrinsic apoptotic
  pathway is activated by the release of TNF-alpha, FADD, and other cell-death promoting
  molecules released from nearby Müller glia and microglia. Finally, RGC cellular
  decay exposes specific membrane components to the external environment, and these
  components act as an ‘eat-me’ signal to recruit activated microglia and macrophages,
  which invade and phagocytose dying cell membranes and organelles.
