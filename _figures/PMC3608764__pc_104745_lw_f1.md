caption: The Camalexin Biosynthetic Pathway in Arabidopsis.The carboxypeptidase cleaving
  off the Gly residue of γ-Glu-Cys(IAN)-Gly or Cys(IAN)-Gly is currently unknown,
  though PCS1 has been proposed to carry out the reaction (; ). The sequential order
  of the two consecutive reactions in the conversion of γ-Glu-Cys(IAN)-Gly to Cys(IAN)
  is not known. However, γ-Glu-Cys(IAN)-Gly, γ-Glu-Cys(IAN), and Cys(IAN), but not
  Cys(IAN)-Gly, have been found in Arabidopsis plants with induced camalexin biosynthesis
  (; ).
