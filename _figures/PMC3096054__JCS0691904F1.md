caption: miRNA biogenesis pathways and regulatory networks. miRNAs begin their journey
  as long, primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) produced by either RNA polymerase II or
  III (RNA pol II or RNA pol III) in the nucleus. Many highly expressed miRNAs are
  transcribed by RNA pol II and, as a result, are under diverse transcriptional regulation
  and often have cell-specific expression patterns within a lineage. For most mammalian
  miRNAs, the pri-miRNA folds into a hairpin structure characteristic of miRNA genes.
  The hairpin is recognized and, subsequently, cleaved by an RNase III processing
  complex formed by Drosha (an RNase III enzyme) and Dgcr8 (a crucial cofactor of
  Drosha) to give rise to the pre-miRNA hairpin in the nucleus. This molecular event
  can be regulated by several proteins, for example, hnRNPA1, p53 and SMAD as well
  as Lin28, in an miRNA-specific manner. Alternative pathways, for example, direct
  transcription of hairpin RNAs and a splicing-mediated hairpin production mechanism,
  called the mirtron pathway, also exist. These miRNAs are generally expressed at
  a very low level and their biological significance is currently not clear. Regardless
  of its origin, the pre-miRNA is recognized and exported to the cytoplasm by a nuclear
  RNA-export factor, Xpo5. In the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNA hairpin is cleaved by a
  second RNase III enzyme, Dicer, to produce a short double-stranded RNA duplex. In
  mammals, all but one miRNA (miR-451) is processed by Dicer. One strand of the duplex
  is embedded with one of four Argonaute proteins (Ago1–4) to form the RISC. When
  the RISC is charged with a specific miRNA, it is guided to mRNA targets harboring
  miRNA-recognition sequences and, in most cases, it inhibits translation by deadenylation
  and direct translational inhibition. However, in several rare cases, when the miRNA
  is perfectly matched to the target mRNA sequences, it leads to the cleavage of the
  mRNA transcripts by the unique ‘slicer’ activity of Ago2.
