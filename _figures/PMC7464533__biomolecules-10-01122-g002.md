caption: Regulation mechanism of acylation in Actinomycetes. (A) Source of intracellular
  acetyl-phosphate (AcP) synthesized from glycolysis. In bacteria, acetate can be
  interconverted to acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) through acetate kinase (AckA) and phosphotransacetylase
  (Pta) reversibly. The pyruvate oxidase (PoxB) is another way for acetate synthesis;
  (B) biosynthetic pathway of Acyl-CoAs derived from acetyl-CoA; (C) regulation mechanism
  in the terms of acylation responding to extracellular nutrient fluctuation; (D,E)
  two types of regulation mechanisms in secondary metabolism through acylation. Protein
  acylation would result in suppression of enzyme activity and decreased stability;
  (D) In secondary metabolites biosynthesis, acyl-CoAs also act as important precursors
  of diverse acyl-CoA-derived natural products; (E) solid line indicates that the
  product is synthesized directly; the dotted line indicates indirect synthesis.
