caption: Histone methylation through one-carbon metabolism and serine biosynthesis
  in macrophages. Serine is biosynthesized from 3-phophoglycerol (3PG), an intermediate
  of glycolysis, by phosphoglycerol dehydrogenase (PHGDH) to form phosphopyruvate
  (p-Pyr) and catalyzed by phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT) to form phosphoserine
  (p-Ser) and then phosphoserine phosphate (PSPH) to form serine. With the aid of
  catalytic enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), serine is further converted
  into glycine donating one-carbon (a methyl group) to the tetrahydrofolate (THF)
  in the folate cycle to form sequentially 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-meTHF)
  and 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (meTHF); the methyl group of the latter is transferred
  to homocysteine (Hcy) to form methionine (Met) and S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM).
  SAM is the co-substrate of methyltransferases for DNA and histone methylation. Methionine
  and serine can also be respectively delivered from extracellular environment to
  the cells by their transporters, L-type amino acid transporter/solute carrier family
  member 5 (LAT1/SLC7A5) and alanine/serine/cysteine/threonine transporter 1 (ASCT1).
  The methyl transfer from meTHF to Hcy needs methionine synthesis (MS/MTR) and its
  co-substrate vitamin B12. In M1-MΦs, elevated nitric oxide (NO) poisons vitamin
  B12 causing deactivation of MTR and the disruption of one-carbon metabolism, resulting
  in reduced Met and SAM for histones/DNA methylation. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  MTB) infected MΦs, independent of vitamin B12, the pathogen can bypass the one-carbon
  metabolic pathway to synthesize methionine and SAM through homoserine, a product
  of aspartate metabolic pathway.
