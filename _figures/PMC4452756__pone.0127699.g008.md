caption: Diagram represents a highly simplified schematic of the transition to flowering
  in Arabidopsis thaliana and the transcriptional affect of F. oxysporum on flowering-time
  genes relevant to this study. During long days, the mobile signalling component
  FT travels from the leaf to the meristem to initiate flowering. The FLOWERING LOCUS
  C (FLC) antagonizes the flowering transition by repressing FT and other floral integrators.
  In winter annuals, FLC transcription is activated by the plant-specific protein
  FRIGIDA (FRI). FLC transcription is down-regulated by vernalization (exposure to
  prolonged cold) or by members of the autonomous pathway at ambient temperatures,
  allowing flowering to occur under conducive conditions.
