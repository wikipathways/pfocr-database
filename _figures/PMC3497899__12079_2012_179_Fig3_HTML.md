caption: A summary of how microenvironmental factors typically affect signaling pathways
  regulating alternative splicing and translation. Blue arrows indicate activating
  effects, although not necessarily an active protein, and red bars indicate inhibiting
  effects. Extracellular activation of PI3K causes an activation of AKT resulting
  in the phosphorylation of SR proteins and mTOR, directly altering splicing patterns
  and the dynamics of translation, respectively. Inhibition of mTOR enhances cap-independent
  translation through derepression of 4EBP causing inactivation of eIF4E. The RAS/MEK
  pathway is also involved in promoting cap-independent translation through other
  eIF proteins. Components of both of these pathways (AKT and ERK), also phosphorylate
  SR proteins, altering their RNA binding specificities and thus patterns of splicing
