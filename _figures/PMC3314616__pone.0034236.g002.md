caption: Networks of related genes were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) software.  shows a network of affected genes that are involved in the control
  of gene expression, cellular growth and proliferation as well as endocrine functions
  while  shows genes that are involved in that are involved cell signaling, cellular
  development, and nervous system development. Relationships are shown as lines and
  arrows. Genes colored pink to red are up-regulated whereas those colored light to
  deep green are down-regulated, with the intensity of the color representing greater
  magnitude of changes.
