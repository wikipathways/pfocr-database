caption: Hexosamine biosynthetic pathwayGlucose is converted to UDP-GlcNAc (the sugar
  nucleotide donor for O-GlcNAcylation) through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  (HBP). The rate-limiting step of the HBP is catalyzed by the GFAT (glutamine fructose-6-phosphate
  amidotransferase), which uses glutamine to convert fructose-6-phosphate into glucosamine-6-phosphate.
  Protein O-GlcNAcylation is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase
  (OGA) for the addition to and removal from the serine and threonine residues, respectively
