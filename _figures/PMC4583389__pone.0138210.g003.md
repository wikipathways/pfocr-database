caption: 'Clustering of cell lines (x-axis) according to cytotoxic responses to PLX4720,
  lapatinib, and combination treatment at three doses for each individual drug and
  a three by three dose response for the combination (y-axis) (A). Five groups were
  identified: CGA (most left, 3 lines), CGB (near left, 1 line), CGC (center, 4 lines),
  CGD (near right, 2 lines), and CGE (far right, 2 lines). Pathway enrichment analysis
  of differential gene expression to PLX4720 treatment identified ERBB signaling as
  being broadly activated in CGC (B). Refer to  for fold change values used to generate
  pathway diagram.'
