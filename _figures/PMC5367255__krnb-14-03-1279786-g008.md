caption: A model depicting role of miR-432 in regulating myogenesis. In proliferating
  cells (left), suppression of E2F3 mRNA by miR-432 resulted in transcription factor
  E2F3 decreasing in nucleus to dampen transcription of cell cycle genes and finally
  caused arrest in G1-phage. In differentiating cells (right), on the one hand, suppression
  of E2F3 by miR-432 inhibited transcription of MyoG to restrain myogenic differentiation;
  on the other hand, miR-432 contributed to phosphorylation of its downstream Akt
  and mTOR being suffocated to block myogenesis by targeted P55PIK.
