caption: NP attenuated metabolic reprogramming in pulmonary hypertension. In two weeks
  of sugen/hypoxia, increased nitration induced activation of Akt upregulated the
  glucose transporter Glut4 to the membrane, and this augmented cellular glucose influx.
  This results in increased aerobic glycolysis and anaplerosis as well as a reduction
  in glycogenesis and pentose phosphate pathway. These metabolic derangements result
  in increased cellular proliferation and vascular remodeling in lung tissue of early
  PAH. NP treatment balanced cellular glucose influx, glycogen synthesis, and the
  pentose phosphate pathway. NP corrected the glycolytic shift, improved oxidative
  phosphorylation, and inhibited anaplerotic reprogramming. Thus, proliferative pathological
  changes in PAH were found to be prevented with NP treatment. PAH, pulmonary arterial
  hypertension; NP, nitroxide-conjugated peptide; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; OXPHOS,
  oxidative phosphorylation.
