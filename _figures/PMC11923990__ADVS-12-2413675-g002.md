caption: Zbp1 Mediates central nervous system inflammation induced by AC via promoting
  macrophage inflammatory phenotypes. (A) Zbp1 enhances AC‐induced neuroinflammation
  by driving the inflammatory polarization of macrophages in the brain. In response
  to LSA, bone marrow‐derived immune cells migrate to the inflamed areas. (B) Under
  inflammatory stimulation, wild‐type macrophages adopt an M1 pro‐inflammatory phenotype
  and release chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL9. This facilitates the infiltration of DCs,
  CD4⁺, and CD8⁺ T cells, and increases NK cell toxicity, leading to elevated levels
  of inflammatory cytokines IFN‐γ and TNF‐α. Additionally, macrophages induce necroptosis
  via the RIP3/pMlkl pathway, aiding in pathogen clearance. (C) Conversely, Zbp1‐deficient
  macrophages produce less CXCL10 and CXCL9, promoting an M2 anti‐inflammatory state.
  This results in lower levels of IFN‐γ and TNF‐α and reduced necroptosis, potentially
  decreasing the inflammatory response. These findings show that Zbp1 controls macrophage
  polarization and necroptosis, supports lymphocyte infiltration, and increases NK
  cell toxicity during neuroinflammation
