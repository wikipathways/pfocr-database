caption: Strategies for immunomodulation to mitigate periprosthetic osteolysis induced
  by wear particles. Wear particles and adherent pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs) and byproducts of cell death and tissue injury (damage-associated molecular
  patterns or DAMPS) can be recognized by Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) and other receptors
  on macrophages, which then activate downstream pathways including the key transcription
  factor Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NFκB). The induced pro-inflammatory responses driven
  by NFκB activation include the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS)
  and cytokines/chemokines including Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα), Interleukin
  1 beta (IL-1b), Macrophage Chemotactic Protein 1 (MCP-1), Macrophage Inhibitory
  Protein 1 alpha (MIP-1α), and others. These events may lead to periprosthetic osteolysis
  due to reduced osteoblast and increased osteoclast activity. We have demonstrated
  that the particle-induced osteolysis can be mitigated by inhibiting (1) the TLR
  pathway; (2) NFκB activation; or (3) macrophage migration using a mutant MCP-1 called
  7ND recombinant protein. Alternatively, pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1, Left)
  can be polarized by (4) Interleukin 4 (IL-4) treatment or (5) genetically modified
  or preconditioned mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (see  for details) into an anti-inflammatory,
  pro-tissue repair macrophage (M2) phenotype (Right). M2 macrophages are identified
  by their expression of Arginase 1 (Arg1) and the surface markers CD206 and CD163.
  M2 macrophages produce Interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra),
  and Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ). Myeloid Differentiation primary response
  88 (MyD88) is a universal adapter protein that is downstream of nearly all TLRs
  (except TLR3), and leads to activation of NFκB.
