caption: a | The subgranuίar zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) provides a unique
  microenvironment where adult neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) undergo several
  consecutive developmental stages characterized by different cell types. NSPCs are
  derived from embryonic stem cells that survived in the adult SGZ. NSPCs self-renew
  and include type 1 radiaί-gίia-ίike (RGL) stem cells, which give rise to intermediate
  progenitor cells type 2a and 2b. These type 2 cells can generate type 3 progenitors
  (neuroblasts), which are capable of differentiating into immature neurons. During
  maturation, immature neurons become granule neurons and are functionally integrated
  into the DG pre-existing circuit. Type 2b and type 3 cells, immature and mature
  neurons, express the transcription factors NeuroD1 and Prox1, which are specific
  to granule cell development. Notch 1 promotes astroglial but not neuronal differentiation.
  b | μ-Opioid peptide receptor (MOP) agonists (such as morphine) inhibit NSPC proliferation
  mainly by slowing the cell cycle G2/M phase transition (prolonged S phase) in mouse
  embryonic NSPCs, though details regarding the mechanism remain elusive. Other pathways
  leading to stagnating proliferation (indicated by the dashed arrow and question
  mark) might exist. Morphine induces extraceίίuίar-signaί-reguίated kinase (ERK)
  phosphorylation in a PKCε-dependent manner, and the activated ERK in turn phosphorylates
  TRBP, which is a stabilizer of Dicer, the essential enzyme for microRNA maturation.
  The mature miR-181a-5p then inhibits the transcription factor Prox1, an inhibitor
  of another transcription factor, Notch1. Thus, increased Notch1 expression mediates
  the inhibition of neuronal differentiation. The inhibition of neurogenic differentiation
  1 (NeuroD1) phosphorylation is another pathway by which morphine affects the transition
  of NSPCs into immature neurons in adult mice. It is inferred that although both
  morphine and fentanyl affect NeuroD1 phosphorylation by inhibiting CaMKIIα, a crucial
  enzyme that catalyses NeuroD1 phosphorylation, fentanyl was able to activate NeuroD1
  via the β-arrestin-ERK-miR-190 pathway, thus reflecting the biased antagonism of
  MOP agonists. Involvement of this pathway has been demonstrated only in cultured
  primary neurons.
