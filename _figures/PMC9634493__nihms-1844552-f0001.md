caption: Potential mechanism for NMBD–mediated anaphylaxis. (a) Most individuals that
  develop anaphylaxis to NMBDs generate IgE antibodies, which bind to their cell surface
  high affinity receptors (FcεRI) mainly on mast cells (also basophils not shown).
  Subsequent administration of the drug results in the cross-linking of FcεRI-bound
  IgE leading to massive histamine release, which is responsible for the manifestations
  of anaphylaxis. (b) IgG antibodies are also be generated in response to certain
  NMBDs. These antibodies bind to FcγRI on the surface of basophils, macrophages and
  neutrophils. Subsequent exposure to the drug leads to immune complex formation and
  activation of FcγRI, resulting in the generation of PAF. This pathway could aggravate
  IgE-mediated anaphylaxis or could form the underlying mechanism of anaphylaxis in
  the absence of IgE []. (c) It has been proposed that activation of cutaneous MCs
  by NMBDs via MRGPRX2 and the subsequent mediator release leads to pseudoallergy.
  Whether or not this pathway plays an important role in NMBD-induced anaphylaxis
  remains to be confirmed. NMBDs that activate cutaneous MCs via MRGPRX2 likely cause
  local erythema and swelling (injection site reaction) due to histamine release.
