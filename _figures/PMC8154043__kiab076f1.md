caption: Metabolic network model of central metabolism with potential RL sources in
  photosynthetic C. sativa leaves. Metabolic network model with pathways including
  C3cycle, photorespiration, starch synthesis, and sucrose synthesis are shown in
  dotted lines. Plastidic, cytosolic, and mitochondrial pools are represented by (“.p”),
  (“.c”), and (“.m”). Irreversible reactions are shown with single-headed arrows and
  reversible reactions are shown with double-headed arrows. Three possible RL sources
  including the TCA cycle (blue), G6P/OPPP shunt (green), and fatty acid synthesis
  (red) pathway are shown. All remaining abbreviations are shown in .
