caption: Metabolic pathway regulated by PKM2 in cancer cells. PKM2 is a less active
  isoform of the terminal glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. The decreased enzymatic
  activity of PKM2 in the cytoplasm promotes the accumulation of upstream glycolytic
  intermediates and converts them into anabolic pathways. PKM2, pyruvate kinase muscle
  isozyme M2; P, phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; CoA, Coenzyme A; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
