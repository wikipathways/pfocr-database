caption: 'The phosphatidylinositol 3—kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Activated receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTKs) recruit and activate PI3K, leading to increased phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3) levels. PIP3 recruits many proteins to the membrane by binding to their pleckstrin
  homology (PH) domains, including the serine/threonine kinases AKT, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase (PDK1), and the phosphatase PH domain and leucine rich repeat protein phosphatase
  (PHLPP). Membrane-bound AKT is rendered fully active through its phosphorylation
  by PDK1 and the rapamycin-insensitive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex
  (mTORC2), and it is inactivated when dephosphorylated by PHLPP. Activated AKT may
  phosphorylate a range of substrates, thereby activating or inhibiting these targets
  and resulting in cellular growth, survival, and proliferation through various mechanisms.
  PI3K can also regulate downstream targets, such as RAC1/CDC42, in an AKT-independent
  manner. Activation of the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex (mTORC1) is inhibited
  by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1 and TSC2) 1 and 2, which can be regulated
  by AKT as well as through PI3K-independent signaling from LKB1 and AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK). Abbreviations: GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor—κ B; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5 bisphosphate; RAC1, Ras-related C3 botulinum
  toxin substrate 1.'
