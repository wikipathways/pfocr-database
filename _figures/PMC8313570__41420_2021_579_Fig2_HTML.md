caption: ROS-induced oxidative stress exacerbates the production of lipid peroxidation
  (LPO). LPO-induced ferroptotic cell death results in the release of damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) from dying cells, which may promote sterile inflammation
  through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) to activate NF-κB.
  On the other hand, lipid peroxidation induced the increase in modified LDL partially
  contributes to inflammation activation via macrophage polarization. GPX4, the core
  regulator of ferroptosis, its activation suppressed ferroptosis and inflammatory
  responses via inhibiting arachidonic acid (AA) oxidation and NF-κB pathway activation.
  Moreover, GPX4 can up-regulate the expression of 12-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase
  1 (COX1) that trigger inflammatory responses. AA, an unsaturated fatty acid and
  released from the cell membrane in response to various cytokines, peptides, and
  growth factors, that can be metabolized by cyclooxygenases (COXs), lipoxygenase
  (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) monooxygenases to synthesize bioactive proinflammatory
  mediators such as prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs), lipoxins (LXs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acids (HETE) and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETE) that promote inflammatory
  responses. Finally, another vital regulator of ferroptosis, iron also participates
  the regulation of immune system via modulating M1 macrophage polarization.
