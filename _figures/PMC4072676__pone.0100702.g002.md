caption: a) The Cad/Cat complexes form adherens junctions through a multi-step process.
  The adhesion is initiated by forming cadherin dimers from apposed cell surfaces
  through the trans-interactions. The clustering of cadherins through the cis-interactions
  triggers the final formation of adherens junctions. b) The process of junction formation
  is simplified by using state transition of Cad/Cat complexes. A “free” Cad/Cat complex
  can transit to “trans” state. Likewise, a “trans” Cad/Cat complex can either participate
  into clusters by transiting to “cis” state, or breaks down into “free” state. The
  endocytosis, association and dissociation of Cad/Cat complexes under different adhesive
  circumstance are also considered in our model.
