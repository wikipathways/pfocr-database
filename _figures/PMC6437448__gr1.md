caption: Biosynthetic pathway engineering for PPT production from 2,3-oxidosqualene.
  Three P. ginseng-derived genes (PgDDS, CYP716A47, and CYP716A53v2) are necessary
  for production of PPT in tobacco. PgDDS converts 2,3-oxidosqualene to a triterpene
  (DD). The triterpene subsequently undergoes hydroxylation by CYP716A47 to produce
  PPD, and PPD undergoes further hydroxylation into PPT by CYP716A53v2.

  of transgenic tobacco co-overexpressing three Panax ginseng genes: PgDDS, CYP716A47,
  and CYP716A53v2.'
