caption: Regulation of the anthocyanin pathway in two  dicot species. (Asterisks denote
  genes for which clones have been made  from Ipomoea.) The regulatory genes that
  have been  identified in Antirrhinum and Petunia are shown  along with the genes
  that they regulate. Abbreviations are listed in  the legend for Fig. .
