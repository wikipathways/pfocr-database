caption: Working model for NIK1 roles in FLS2 signalling pathway and flg22-induced
  translational control of NIK1 signalling. (I) At the resting stage, NIK1 associates
  with FLS2 or BAK1 to prevent autoimmunity without pathogens invasion. (II) Upon
  bacterial infection, flg22 is perceived by the immune receptor FLS2, which induces
  the heterodimerization with BAK1, also including RLCK BIK1 and its homologues. Phosphorylation
  events initiates the immune signalling, and BIK1 is released from the membrane to
  activate downstream signal. (III) During signalling transduction, BAK1 may phosphorylate
  NIK1 on Thr474 residues. Phosphorylated NIK1 leads to activation of an antiviral
  signal through RPL10 phosphorylation and suppression of translational machinery-related
  gene expression. (IV) At signalling attenuation stage, phosphorylated NIK1 exhibits
  higher affinity to FLS2 and BAK1, and these interactions may lead to receptor complex
  instability or disassembly, followed by FLS2 ubiquitination and degradation
papertitle: The receptor-like kinase NIK1 targets FLS2/BAK1 immune complex and inversely
  modulates antiviral and antibacterial immunity.
