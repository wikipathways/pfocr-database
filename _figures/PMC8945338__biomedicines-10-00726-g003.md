caption: The Hippo pathway in cardiac disease. (a) In myocardial infarction, the Hippo
  pathway is upregulated. Overexpression of MST1 activates mitochondrial fragmentation
  via JNK-DRP1, enhancing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. In contrast,
  its deletion activates mitophagy via MAPK/ERK-CREB. Green arrow dashed lines indicate
  cardioprotective treatments to turn off the Hippo pathway. (b) The activation of
  upstream kinases leads to the downregulation of mitochondrial genes and the upregulation
  of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, ultimately leading to lethal Dilated CM. Arrhythmogenic
  CM is characterized by adipogenesis activation, which is secondary to overexpression
  of NF2 and upregulation of upstream kinases. (c) Heart failure exhibits overexpression
  of RASSF1A, enhancing phosphorylation of MST1 and consequently YAP1 cytosolic retention.
  Upregulation of the Akt/FOXO3 pathway inhibits MST1 activation; thus, YAP1 translocates
  into the nucleus, leading to cardiac hypertrophy. Additionally, nuclear YAP2 induces
  cell proliferation and hypertrophy via Akt1 signaling. MST2 overexpression also
  induces cardiac hypertrophy via the Raf1-ERK1/2 pathway but not through Hippo signaling.
  SAV1 deletion shows a positive feedback cycle of YAP1/TEAD-OSM, which exacerbates
  cardiac injury after PO.
