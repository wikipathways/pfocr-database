caption: Dynamic regulation of macrophage autophagy in response to Leishmania. Shown
  is a model illustrating Leishmania involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR-signaling pathway and
  IMPase of phosphoinositol-signaling pathway to regulate host autophagy in infected
  macrophages. Continuous Leishmania-mediated activation of macrophage Akt sustains
  mTOR activity. This in turn suppresses autophagy at early and late stages of infection.
  At later stages of infection, Leishmania engages IMPase to induce host autophagy,
  which is independent of mTOR activity, to promote their survival. Potential mechanism
  for Leishmania-mediated host autophagy program involving Leishmania secretory factors
  is shown.
