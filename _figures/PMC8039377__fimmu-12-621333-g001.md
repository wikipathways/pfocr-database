caption: 'Molecular cascades that create epigenetic memory in HSCs. Top row: Microbial
  Training Agents and Non-Microbial Training Agents recognized by PRRs and other sensors.
  Images underneath are subsequent events occurring in descending order. (1): Activation
  of signaling pathway involving transcription factors and kinases. (2): This then
  globally alters chromatin accessibility, which leads to building new transcriptome
  profiles. Open chromatin regions (OCR) can persist longer than transcriptome changes,
  providing a basis of lasting epigenetic marks. Shown in the bottom two rows are
  (3): Duration of memory and (4): Phenotypic manifestation of memory. In all cases,
  HSC memory acquisition involves exit from quiescence, proliferation, and myeloid-biased
  differentiation of LT-HSC and progenitor cells.'
