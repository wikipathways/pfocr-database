caption: The impacts of astrocyte metabolic pathways on neurological disorders. (A)
  Targeting astrocyte metabolic pathways in depression. In depression, metabolic pathways
  are impaired in astrocytes, such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) signaling, the
  PPP, the TCA cycle, and an increase in ROS. These changes in astrocytes lead to
  a decrease in dopamine, ATP, glutamate, astrocytes and 5-HT, while reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) are increased. (B) Targeting astrocyte metabolic pathways in Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD). Some metabolic signaling is impaired in astrocytes, such as the glutamate
  uptake pathway, glycolysis pathway, and TCA cycle, while ROS are increased, leading
  to high inflammation levels. (C) Targeting astrocyte metabolic pathways in epilepsy.
  The pathways involved in epilepsy in astrocytes, such as the metabolism of glutamate,
  the synthesis of GABA, glycolysis, lactate and glycogen metabolism, were impaired,
  leading to the accumulation of glutamate, lactate and glycogen and the loss of GABA
  and glucose.
