caption: Schematic overview of effects of metformin on gene expression and metabolism
  in human adrenal H295R cells, focused on mitochondria and steroidogenesis. Based
  on the reactome pathway analysis (Table ), we mapped metformin-altered genes into
  the landscape of known mitochondrial metabolic pathways. It is known that metformin
  is transported into cells through the OCT family of transporters. In mitochondria
  metformin inhibits complex I-dependent respiration and decreases ATP production.
  Our transcriptome data indicate that metformin increases the uncoupled respiration
  by upregulating UCP2 and UCP4 gene expression, and increases glycolysis by upregulating
  GLUT4, ALDOC, ENO2, ENO3 gene expression. This may result in an increase in lactate
  production and a decrease in pyruvate, confirming our metabolome data. Additionally,
  we found that metformin decreases SCOT gene expression, which is important for ketone
  body acetoacetate formation. We also found decreased expression of the SERBF1 transcription
  factor, which regulates fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. This suggests a possible
  negative effect on cholesterol synthesis that is important for all steroidogenesis.
