caption: Schematic model of the involvement of KRAS in cell survival and growth as
  well as in tumor microenvironment through MEK→ERK and PI3K signaling pathways. This
  schematic diagram depicts the main signaling processes triggered downstream KRAS,
  namely the MEK→ERK (orange) and PI3K (green) signaling, and their relationships
  with cell growth, cell survival and autophagy. Cross-activation and cross-inhibition
  processes, through direct and indirect ways, between these signaling routes are
  indicated. The MEK→ERK signaling pathway is also involved in effects on tumor microenvironment
  through a G-CSF-mediated recruitment of neutrophils (yellow). Major actions triggered
  by MEK→ERK signaling inhibition are indicated in the highlighted box. See text for
  further details.
