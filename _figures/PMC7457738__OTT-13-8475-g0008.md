caption: The proposed schematic representation for GAST in GC development and progression.
  The scheme indicated that GAST was the direct target gene of miR-30a-3p in GC cell
  lines and tissues, suggested that miR-30a-3p was the promising tumor suppressor
  gene in GC. Furthermore, elevated GAST expression promoted cell proliferation, migration
  and invasion through STAT3 phosphorylation and up-transactivation of MMP11 expression.
