caption: Impact of ovarian cancer-exosomes on target cells during pre-metastatic niche
  formation. a. Ovarian cancer-exosomes induce apoptosis of dendritic cells, increase
  secretion of IL-6, and inhibit function of T cells and NK cells. b. Ovarian cancer-exosomes
  with their cargo, such as ATF2, MTA1, sE-cad, and CD147, which acts on human vein
  endothelial cells, inducing angiogenesis and vascular permeability. c. Ovarian cancer-exosomes
  convert fibroblasts to CAFs. d. Ovarian cancer-exosomes deliver miRNAs to macrophages
  and elicit M2 macrophage polarization by regulating the suppressor of cytokine signaling
  (SOCS)4/5/ STAT3 pathway in macrophages. e. Phenotypic conversion and apoptosis
  of PMCs, induced by ovarian cancer-exosomes, clears the mesothelial cell barrier
  of the peritoneum and omentum. OC ovarian cancer, NK natural killer, ATF2 Activating
  transcription factor 2, MTA1 Metastasis-associated protein 1, sE-cad soluble E-cadherin,
  SOCS Suppress cytokine signaling, STAT3 Signal transducer and activator of transcription
