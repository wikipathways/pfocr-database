caption: Overview of cellular Na+ transport mechanisms and important components of
  the salt stress response network in plant root cells. Na+ (depicted in red) enters
  the cell via non- selective cation channels (NSCCs) and other, as yet largely unknown
  membrane transporters (cellular Na+ influx mechanisms highlighted with orange).
  Inside the cell, Na+ is sensed by an as yet unidentified sensory mechanism. At the
  next step, Ca2+, ROS and hormone signaling cascades are activated. CBLs, CIPKs and
  CDPKs are part of the Ca2+signaling pathway (sensing and signaling components highlighted
  with blue), which can alter the global transcriptional profile of the plant (transcription
  factor families in the nucleus depicted in purple; an AP2/ERF and a bZIP transcription
  factor that negatively regulate HKT gene expression are shown as an example). Ultimately
  these early signaling pathways result in expression and activation of cellular detoxification
  mechanisms, including HKT, NHX and the SOS Na+ transport mechanisms as well as osmotic
  protection strategies (cellular detoxification mechanisms highlighted with light
  green). Furthermore, the Na+ distribution in the plant is regulated in a tissue-specific
  manner by unloading of Na+ from the xylem.
