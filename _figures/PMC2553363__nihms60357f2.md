caption: 'The ER stress pathway. The ER membrane contains 3 stress transducers: IRE1,
  ATF6, and PERK. Their activation is controlled by the ER molecular chaperone immunoglobulin-binding
  protein of B cells (BiP/GRP78). Release from BiP binding activates the ER stress
  transducers. IRE1 contains a cytoplasmic kinase domain and an endoribonuclease domain.
  The latter cleaves XBP1 to spliced XBP1 (sXBP1), leading to transcriptional activation
  of adaptive molecules to overcome ER stress, such as ER chaperones, lipid synthesis,
  and increasing ER-associated degradation (ERAD). PERK activation leads to phosphorylation
  of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, leading to global translation attenuation.
  ATF6 also transcriptionally activates UPR target genes. These processes collectively
  function to overcome and correct ER stress. In the face of sustained ER stress,
  apoptotic machinery becomes activated. PERK leads to selective translation of ATF4,
  transcription of CHOP, and activation of the apoptotic machinery. CHOP can affect
  Bim levels and death receptor 5 levels. IRE1 can also activate JNK. Active Bax/Bak
  can permeabilize the ER membrane, leading to calcium release, activation of calpains,
  and apoptosis. Growth arrest and DNA damage protein 34 (GADD34) associates with
  protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), leading to dephosphorylation of eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 2α and attenuation of the UPR.'
