caption: The biological function and therapeutic potential of apoptotic bodies. A)
  Apoptotic bodies are secreted by budding directly through the cell membrane. Apoptosis
  leads to an increase in the influx of calcium ions (Ca2+), which triggers proteases,
  and these activated proteases mediate the destruction of the cytoskeleton. ADP-ribosylation
  factor-6 (ARF-6) initiates the signal cascade, and finally activates the rho-related
  protein kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway to trigger blistering, and finally release
  of apoptotic bodies. The initiation of apoptosis also activates apoptotic enzymes
  to mediate the shedding of apoptotic bodies. B) Chemotherapy or radiotherapy-exposed
  tumor cells may initiate apoptosis and trigger the release ABs. Adapted with permission
