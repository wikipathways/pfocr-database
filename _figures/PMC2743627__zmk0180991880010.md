caption: 'Working model: mobilization of REs in response to death triggers. We propose
  that the mobilization of REs via the coordinated actions of SFKs and Cdc42 at REs,
  which would control an actin-regulated Rab11a retrograde route at the endosome–Golgi
  interface, could be part of the upstream events that relay death signals to cellular
  organelles. REs could deliver signaling moieties controlling actin dynamics, which
  in turn would contribute to the remodeling of Golgi membranes (Golgi membrane scattering)
  whose dynamic changes regulate the progression of cell death. See Discussion for
  details.'
