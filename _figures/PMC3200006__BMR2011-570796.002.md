caption: Notch canonical signalling pathway. The figure shows an overview of the canonical
  Notch signalling pathway (adapted from []). The signalling is initiated by ligand
  binding to Notch receptor (1). This binding initiates two subsequent proteolytic
  cleavages of the Notch receptor by the ADAM family protease (2) and the γ-secretase,
  respectively (3). The Notch IntraCellular Domain (NICD) is thereby released to the
  cytoplasm (4) and translocates to the nucleus where NICD heterodimerizes with the
  DNA-binding transcription factor CBF1 (also named CSL or Rbp-j). Additional coactivators
  are also recruited, including mastermind-like proteins (MAML1-3) ultimately leading
  to induction of transcriptional expression of downstream target genes, including
  those belonging to the Hes and Hey families.
