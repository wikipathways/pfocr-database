caption: H. pylori LPS biosynthesis follows a novel Wzk-dependent pathway []. The
  assembly of the very long O-antigen occurs in the cytoplasm and is initiated by
  WecA [] transferring the GlcNAc residue of the Trio onto the UndPP carrier. Successive
  glycosyltransferases are recruited to complete the synthesis of the whole O-antigen
  encompassing the conserved Trio and variable glucan, heptan and Lewis antigens.
  After assembly in the cytoplasm, the UndPP-linked O-antigen is translocated by flippase
  Wzk to the periplasm []. Also assembled in the cytoplasm, the de novo synthesized
  core-lipid A is flipped by flippase MsbA to the periplasm []. After constitutive
  modifications through dephosphorylation and deacylation [], the modified core-lipid
  A is ligated with O-antigen by the ligase WaaL [], and the Hep III residue is the
  attachment site.
