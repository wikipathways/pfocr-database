caption: NAC protects against Cd-induced germ cell apoptosis by inhibiting UPR signalling
  in the testes. First, NAC attenuates the Cd-induced UPR signalling by inhibiting
  activation of PERK signalling and the IRE1α pathway in testis. Second, NAC protects
  against the Cd-induced germ cell apoptosis by inhibiting the Cd-induced upregulation
  of CHOP, a downstream target of PERK signalling, and phosphorylation of JNK, a downstream
  target of the IRE1α pathway. ATF, activating transcription factor; Cd, cadmium;
  CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GRP78, glucose-regulated
  protein 78; GSH, glutathione; IRE, inositol requiring ER-to-nucleus signal kinase;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; p-eIF2α, phosphor-eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 2α PERK, double-stranded RNA-activated kinase-like
  ER kinase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; UPR, unfolded protein response; XBP, X
  box-binding protein.
