caption: Gene organization and proposed biosynthesis of a phosphonoformate-like compound
  in Frankia alni ACN14a. (A) Phosphonate biosynthetic gene cluster in F. alni ACN14a.
  Genes that are responsible for the production of hydroxyethylphosphonate are depicted
  in grey (minimal cassette consisting of phosphoenolpyruvate mutase ppm, phosphonopyruvate
  decarboxylase ppd and phosphonoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase adh). (B) Proposed pathway
  to a hitherto unknown phosphonate antibiotic.
