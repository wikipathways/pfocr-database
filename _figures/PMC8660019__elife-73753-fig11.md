caption: Accumulation of the hyperactivated G2019S mutant protein enhances the BMP
  ligand (Gbb) maturation via upregulation of Furin 1 translation in dopaminergic
  neurons. Secreted Gbb binds to the BMP receptor, Tkv, and turns on Mad signaling
  in glia. The G2019S mutation also decreases the Nrf2 activity in the brain, particularly
  in glia. Both upregulated Mad and downregulated Nrf2 pathways contribute to neurodegeneration.
  WGE feeding suppresses G2019S hyperactivation in neurons and restores Nrf2 activity
  mostly in the astrocyte-like and ensheathing glia. WGE-elevated Nrf2 activity in
  glia antagonizes the BMP/Mad signaling and initiates Nrf2/HO-1 axis in glia, attenuating
  the stress signals from glia and promoting neuroprotection. Red and green solid
  arrows (→) indicate the observed effects exerted by G2019S overexpression and WGE
  feeding, respectively, in the present study. Red and green dashed arrows (-->) indicate
  the proposed actions trigged by Mad signaling and WGE feeding, respectively. Red
  and green blunt-ended lines (---|) indicate the proposed inhibitions by Mad and
  Nrf2 overexpression, respectively. (P) Indicates phosphorylation. The Furin 1-mediated
  Gbb pathway labeled in gray is modified from Figure 6 of .
