caption: 'The production of N2 through anammox is presented with green arrows. Arrow
  width indicates suggested pathway importance in the south-eastern Indian Ocean.
  Marker genes for the different steps of the nitrogen cycle are in italics. The nitrous
  oxide reductase gene (nosZ) is highlighted with a dashed blue circle. Heterotrophic
  denitrification (nir/nor genes) is highlighted as a C source while the autotrophic
  anammox process (hzsA genes) is highlighted as a C sink. Note: dissimilatory reduction
  of NO2− to NH4+ and N2O is not presented on this figure. Figure adapted from Throbäck
  et al. []'
