caption: Metabolic requirements of effector CD8+ T cells (Teff). Early generation
  of effector cells requires a metabolic reprogramming from OXPHOS and FAO toward
  aerobic glycolysis with increased OXPHOS driven by FAO in late effector stage. A
  hallmark of aerobic glycolysis is elevated aerobic glycolysis and secretion of lactate.
  PPP intermediates are elevated to support synthesis of nucleotides, proteins and
  lipids for cell growth, proliferation, and effector responses. In activated effector
  cells, the HBP may utilize F-6-P to form glucosamine-6-phosphate by glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate
  transaminase in the presence of glutamine. This is a key step in the production
  of UDP-GlcNAc, a substrate for protein glycosylation. GAPDH a key glycolytic enzyme
  may disengage the 3′-UTR of effector cytokines to perform its metabolic role, thereby
  inducing cytokine production. Activated effector cells also increase glutamine uptake
  which generates α-KG via anaplerosis. This α-KG supports the TCA cycle under condition
  of limited pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. α-KG may also directly activate mTOR. CPT1a,
  carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A; FAs, fatty acids; FAO, fatty-acid oxidation;
  F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HBP,
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; UDP-GlcNAc, uridine diphosphate N-acetyl glucosamine; 3′-UTR, three
  prime untranslated region.
