caption: 'A| mTORC1 and mTORC2 integrate nutrient-sensing and signaling pathways to
  coordinate multiple biological processes. mTORC1 activates protein synthesis through
  S6 and eIF4E, stimulates nucleotide synthesis through CAD, and promotes mitochondrial
  biogenesis through PGC-1α. mTORC2 activates AKT, which inhibits apoptosis in part
  by phosphorylating and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors, such as BAD, BIM, and
  FAS. In addition, mTORC2 influences T-cell trafficking through CD62L, CCR7, and
  S1P1. B| T-cell differentiation requires changes in mTOR-dependent metabolic programs.
  Th1, Th2, Th17, and effector CD8+ T cells use glycolysis (together with amino acid
  and mitochondria-dependent metabolism) to meet their energy and biosynthetic demands;
  Treg and memory CD8+ T cells exhibit a higher dependency on lipid oxidative phosphorylation
  in some contexts. mTORC1 activation facilitates the generation of Th1, Th2, Th17,
  and effector CD8+ T cells, whereas mTORC2 activation promotes the generation of
  Th2 and memory CD8+ T cells. The absence of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity leads
  to iTreg cell generation. Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 contribute to Tfh cell differentiation
  through distinct mechanisms: mTORC1 deficiency reduces the proliferation and expression
  of ICOS that are necessary for Tfh cell differentiation; in contrast, mTORC2 deficiency
  impairs Tfh cell differentiation by inhibiting AKT activation and TCF-1 expression.'
