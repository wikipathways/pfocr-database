caption: Schematic illustration of CAE-stimulated antioxidant enzyme and insulin secretion
  pathway in pancreatic β-cells in HG and H2O2 stress conditions. Glucose enters the
  cell across the plasma membrane through glucose transporters, like GLUT-2 for rodent
  β-cells. Once inside the cell the metabolic process of glucose called glycolysis
  begins. ATP is the end product of glycolysis. Further reactions take place in mitochondria
  where more ATP is produced. In connection with the electron transport chain the
  superoxide anion results. Cytosolic or mitochondrial forms of SOD catalyze the conversion
  of superoxide anion (O2•−) to molecular oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
  Unlike glucose, H2O2 administered to cells diffuses through the cell membrane. The
  resulting H2O2 from glucose metabolism and the extracellular H2O2 are then metabolized
  to harmless water and oxygen by CAT and GPx. CAE increases the activity of SOD,
  CAT, and GPx, so the more active the metabolism of H2O2 is, the less the reactive
  species are formed in the cell. GSH levels are reduced by H2O2 and HG and restored
  by CAE. It is possible that the anthocyanins increase the insulin gene expression,
  because the CAE treatment attempts to restore the pool of insulin. Before being
  secreted out of the cell insulin is synthesized and converted to proinsulin in the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folded and transported to the Golgi apparatus. Anthocyanins
  from CAE could also influence the opening of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, leading
  to an increased fusion of insulin granule with the cell membrane.
