caption: Schematic describing the function the principle of synthetic lethality interaction
  between PARPs and BRCA1/2. When cells suffer from DNA response, single-strand breaks
  emerge. PARPs, especially PARP1, bind to the DNA break sites, which result in the
  PARylation of target proteins and recrement of the DNA damage repair effectors.
  Then the auto-PARylation on PARPs leads to the dissociation of PARPs from DNA. Treating
  HR-deficient tumor cells with PARPi, NHEJ is the only pathway to use to repair double-strand
  break, which lead to accumulation of genome instability and cell death for the low
  fidelity
