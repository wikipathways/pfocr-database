  description: The coordination of plastid development and carotenoid metabolism.
    Carotenoid metabolic sink is enhanced during chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition.
    Locations of carotenoid pathway enzymes within chloroplasts and chromoplasts are
    shown based on subplastidial proteomic identification. Nucleus-encoded chloroplast
    proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as pre-proteins and post-translationally
    imported into the chloroplast through the TOC/TIC translocons. With the integration
    of retrograde communication with nucleus and protein quality control, the plastid
    development and carotenoid metabolism adapt to each other. The various molecules
    involved in retrograde signaling are numbered. ABI4, abscisic acid-insensitive
    4; BCH, β-carotene hydrolase; CCD, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; Clp, Casein
    lytic proteinase; Cpn60, chaperonin 60; CrtISO, carotene isomerase; DXS, deoxy-D-xylulose

    PAP, 3-phosphoadenosine 5 -phosphate; PGM48, plastoglobule-localized metallopeptidase;
    PTOX, plastid terminal oxidase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SP, suppressor of
