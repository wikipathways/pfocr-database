  is the target of three enzymes: the mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mtNOS),
  mitochondrial arginase (ARG2), and the arginine decarboxylase (ADC). The mtNOS produces
  the NO and citrulline. Citrulline is exported into the cytoplasm and activates the
  CAD pathway. NO inhibits the O2 consumption by complex IV and the NADH oxidation
  by complex-I of the respiratory chain. ARG2 produces the ornithine and urea. Urea
  has feedback effect on the ARG2, but ornithine activates the polyamine biosynthesis
  (not shown in the figure). ADC produces the CO2 and the agmatine. Agmatine has activating
  effect on the fatty acid β-oxidation. The GCN2 dependent asparagine synthesis supplies
  the aspartate for CAD pathway, while proline contribute to glutamate synthesis (FIG.
  b) which produces the carbamoyl phosphate for pyrimidine synthesis in CAD pathway.
  b Proline Contributes to Glutamate Production for CAD Pathway in Proliferative cells
  EMT induces the matrix degradation and the collagen hydrolysis liberates the proline.
  Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) is a bifunctional enzyme which produces
  an intermediate delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate and inter converts the proline
  to glutamate and vice versa. The enzyme ALDH1A1 and the ALDH18A1, members of the
  aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 and aldehyde dehydrogenase gene family
  18 member A1/2, respectively catalyse the reversible conversion of the delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  to glutamate in cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively. The delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  reductase (P5CR) produces the intermediate the delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  from the proline. (ALDH1A1, is one of the markers of cancer stem cell (CSC), and
  it has been related to tumorigenesis and drug resistance in several cancers)'
