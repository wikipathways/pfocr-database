caption: Proposed model for therapeutic potential of TET1 in TNBC. (A) TNBC tumors
  can be subdivided into TET1-low and TET1-high (full length and/or alternate isoform)
  groups. Patients with high TET1 tumors have worse overall survival compared to patients
  with low TET1 tumors as indicated in the Kaplan–Meier curves. (B) Tumors with high
  TET1 are characterized by low immune response genes and are immune-cold. The model
  suggests that inhibition of TET1 will result in activation of immune pathway genes
  that could potentially respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors and improve overall
  survival.
