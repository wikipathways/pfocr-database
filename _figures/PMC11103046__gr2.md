caption: Mechanisms of the Anticancer Effects of SGLT2iSGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) inhibit
  glucose uptake by inhibiting SGLTs (SGLT-1 and SGLT-2) and glucose transporters
  (GLUTs). SGLT2 inhibitors, especially canagliflozin, inhibit mitochondrial complex
  I–supported cellular respiration, reducing adenosine triphosphate production and
  activating AMPK. Activated AMPK inhibits acetyl–coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), suppressing
  fatty acid synthesis. It also down-regulates forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) and sonic hedgehog
  signaling molecule (Shh) and inhibits mTOR and p70S6K, thereby suppressing protein
  synthesis. Inhibited mTOR results in the down-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α
  (HIF-1α). SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway.
  SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit the Hippo signaling pathway by down-regulating the heterogeneous
  nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK)/YES-associated protein 1 (YAP1) axis. Additionally,
  SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase and angiogenesis
  activators. Created using BioRender.com. ANG = angiogenin; FA = fatty acid; IL8 = interleukin
