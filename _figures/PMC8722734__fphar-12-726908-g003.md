caption: LINC00472 regulation of cell growth, and invasion. Through the ceRNA axis,
  LINC00472 regulates cancer cell growth and invasion. Regulation of the LINC00472/miR-141/PDCD4
  pathway in BC enhances cell growth, invasion, drug sensitivity and apoptosis; LINC00472
  inhibits BC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by regulating the MCM6/MEK/ERK
  pathway; LINC00472 promotes DEDD expressions by sponging miR-24-3p, inhibiting LUAD
  cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis; Effects of LINC00472 on LC cell viability,
  migration, invasion, and EMT are attributed to direct targeting of miR-196b-5p;
  Overexpressed LINC00472 upregulates KLLN, inhibiting NSCLC cell proliferation, invasion,
  and EMT via the downregulation of miR-149-3p and miR-4270; LINC00472 inhibits EMT
  by binding to YBX1, which affects the mechanical properties of cells, ultimately
  inhibiting their abilities to invade and metastasize; The miR-93-5p/PDCD4 pathway
  mediates the suppressive functions of LINC00472 in HCC cells; LINC00472 promotes
  osteosarcoma tumorigenesis by suppressing FOXO1 expressions via miR-300; In CRC,
  LINC00472 inhibits proliferation and initiates apoptosis by increasing PDCD4 expressions
  through sponging miR-196a; In PC, silencing of LINC00472 suppressed the levels of
  BID via miR-23a-3p/FOXO3, which promoted PC cell proliferation while inhibiting
  their apoptosis.
