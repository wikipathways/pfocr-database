caption: A cartoon summarizing some of the genetic regulation within the morphogenetic
  furrow of the eye imaginal disc. General proliferation associated with unpatterned
  growth of the eye disc is arrested anterior to the furrow by Hh and Dpp signaling.
  These signals also induce Ato expression. Ato heterodimerizes with Da to specify
  R8 photoreceptor cells. R8 (and other photoreceptor cells) are a source of Dl signaling
  and Notch activation, which signals through E(spl) to restrict specification of
  R8 cells through lateral inhibition, and also restrict specification of R2,3,4,5
  photoreceptor cells that are also recruited in the morphogenetic furrow. Notch signaling
  has been implicated in emc transcription but has little effect on Emc protein levels.
  Emc is a competitive inhibitor of Ato/Da function. Finally, Delta and Notch promote
  entry of unspecified progenitor cells into the Second Mitotic Wave cell cycle, through
  an unidentified gene target distinct from the E(spl) complex and which may not be
  Cyclin E. The fact that both photoreceptor differentiation and the SMW cell cycle
  are regulated by Dl through N may help coordinate the restriction of cell cycle
  entry to unspecified cells only.
