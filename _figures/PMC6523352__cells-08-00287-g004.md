caption: 'The Ras-cAMP/PKA Pathway in yeast and mammalian cells. In yeast, adenylate
  cyclase can be activated by two systems: Grp1 or the RAS pathway. In mammalian cells,
  adenylate cyclase activity is controlled by GPCR. cAMP synthesized by the adenylate
  cyclase binds to PKA regulatory subunits leading to the activation of the PKA catalytic
  subunit thanks to its dissociation from its regulatory subunits.'
