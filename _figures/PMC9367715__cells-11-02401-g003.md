caption: Non-canonical pathway of β–TrCP dependent (KEAP1-independent) NRF2 degradation.
  In absence of PI3K–AKT upstream signaling, the serine threonine kinase GSK-3 phosphorylates
  NRF2, and this post-translational modification facilitates its recognition by the
  CUL1 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex which in turn primes NRF2 for proteasomal degradation.
  The induction of the PI3K-AKT pathway phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3, which
  cannot phosphorylate NRF2. This prevents NRF2 recognition by the CUL1 ubiquitin
  E3 ligase complex and promotes its accumulation. NRF2 then enters into the nucleus,
  heterodimerizes with members of the small Maf proteins, and induces the expression
  of target cytoprotective genes.
