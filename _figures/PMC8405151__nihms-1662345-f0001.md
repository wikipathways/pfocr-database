caption: Individual panels show developmental changes and tissue tropisms observed
  in the T. brucei life cycle, with major components of the underlying signaling pathways
  shown where these are known. In the mammalian host, entry to the central nervous
  system may occur through the blood brain barrier or circumventricular organs/choroid
  plexus, but factors involved are not understood. Dermal and adipose tissues represent
  physiologically important reservoirs. Differentiation to transmission competent
  forms in the dermis (red, stumpy) and to adipose tissue forms (yellow) in adipose
  indicate response to local cues. Factors controlling movement between these sites
  and the vasculature are unknown. Within the vasculature, differentiation from proliferating
  slender forms (red, slender) to growth-arrested stumpy forms (red, stumpy) is driven
  by a quorum sensing system in which oligopeptides (blue dots) accumulate with increasing
  parasite density and these are perceived by the GPR89 oligopeptide transporter.
  Differentiation from stumpy forms (red, stumpy) to early procyclic forms (blue)
  in the tsetse fly midgut is controlled by an autoregulatory phosphatase pathway,
  with key regulatory proteins localized to a specialized “Stumpy Regulatory Nexus”
  (STuRN) near the base of the flagellum. In the midgut, early procyclic forms differentiate
  into late procyclic forms (green). Within the proventriculus, procyclic forms depend
  on cAMP signaling pathways in the flagellum to penetrate the peritrophic matrix
  and enter the ectoperitrophic space. Parasites ultimately travel to the salivary
  glands, where proliferating epimastigotes (purple) attach via their flagellum to
  the gland epithelium and differentiate into growth-arrested metacyclic trypomastigotes
  (pink) that are readied for the bloodstream of the mammalian host. Some steps of
  the life cycle are not shown (e.g. differentiation to mesocyclics and long and short
  epimastigotes in the proventriculus and differentiation of metacyclic trypomastigotes
  into slender forms in the bloodstream).
