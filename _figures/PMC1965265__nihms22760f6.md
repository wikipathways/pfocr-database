caption: A schematic representation of differential testosterone action on morphoregulatory
  gene expression in the rat VP and LP lobes. In this model, testosterone might be
  considered a proximate regulator of a cascade of both growth stimulatory and inhibitory
  genes. Genes in rectangles represent indirect testosterone targets through the Fgf10
  signaling pathway. Genes in circles represent potential direct targets of testosterone
  in stroma or epithelial testosterone target genes that are independent of Fgf10
  signaling. Pointers indicate similar responses in the VP and LP lobes. Genes shown
  in red are growth inhibitory genes. Exogenous testosterone up-regulates Fgf10/FgfR
  in both prostate lobes. In the VP, elevated Fgf10 signaling drives increased expression
  of epithelial Shh and Hoxb13. Testosterone also increases Nkx3.1 and Bmp7 in the
  VP through a Mek pathway that is independent of Fgf10. In contrast, testosterone
  increases Nkx3.1 expression in the LP through an Fgf10 and Mek-independent pathway
  and has no effect on epithelial Hoxb13, Bmp7, or Shh in that lobe. Mesenchymal expression
  of Ptc is directly increased by androgens in both lobes. Of the two mesenchymal
  inhibitory factors examined, Wnt5a expression is down-regulated by testosterone
  in the VP, whereas Bmp4 is down-regulated by androgen in the LP. We propose that
  androgen regulation of prostate development is mediated through positive and negative
  regulation of multiple genes acting in combination and through complex gene networks
  that include cross-regulation of the genes themselves in a time- and location-specific
  manner.
