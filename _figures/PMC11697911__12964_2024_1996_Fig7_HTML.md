caption: Graphical overview of the canonical role and potential regulatory mechanisms
  of the Notch signaling pathway on porcine oocyte maturation. Notch signaling-related
  transcripts and proteins were continuously detected in oocytes and cumulus cells
  during meiotic maturation. Notably, the Notch signaling regulates microtubule function,
  including spindle organization and chromosome segregation, and supports proper cytoplasmic
  maturation by maintaining homeostasis of the mitochondrial and ER systems in porcine
  oocytes. These findings provide novel insights into the canonical role and potential
  regulatory mechanisms of the Notch signaling pathway in porcine oocyte maturation
