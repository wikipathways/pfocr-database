caption: 'The NF2 gene product merlin is a key tumor suppressor protein. The NF2 gene
  product merlin acts as a scaffolding protein that links the actin cytoskeleton to
  the extracellular matrix (ECM) via transmembrane proteins such as integrin and CD44
  to maintain contact inhibition. Furthermore, merlin interacts with receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTK) and acts at cell-cell tight and adherens junctions linking cadherins
  to intracellular actin filaments. Active merlin discourages aberrant cell division
  by negatively regulating cellular proliferation and survival signaling pathways:
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2)
  and Ras homolog enriched in brain (RHEB), phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase
  B/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (PI3K/Akt/JNK), Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK), and Src/focal adhesion kinase/Rac/p21-activated
  kinase (Src/FAK/Rac/PAK). Proteins that are downregulated by active merlin are presented
  with a bold, red outline. However, merlin upregulates the Hippo pathway via the
  activation of large tumor suppressor kinase 1 and 2 (LATS1/2) to initiate yes-associated
  protein 1/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (YAP/TAZ) degradation.
  Furthermore, the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is positively regulated
  by merlin via interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) interaction thus allowing RNA
  and DNA sensing to occur within the healthy cell. Created with BioRender.com.'
