caption: The radical SAM enzyme DesII, responsible for the deamination of TDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose
  to give TDP-3-keto-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose (15 → 16, ) in the biosynthetic pathway
  of desosamine, is a particularly noteworthy example., Desosamine (see 17) is a 3-dimethylamino-3,4,6-trideoxysugar
  derivative important for the antimicrobial activity of a number of macrolide antibiotics
  including erythromycin, methymycin and pikromycin., DesII, which contains the CxxxCxxC
  consensus sequence, has been verified to be a radical SAM enzyme on the basis of
  its dependence on SAM (1) and a reduced [4Fe-4S] cluster for enzymatic activity.,
  Consistent with the established mechanisms for this class of enzymes, the DesII
  reaction is initiated with a hydrogen atom abstraction by the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical
  (4). Using [3-2H]-15 as substrate, the transfer of the C-3 hydrogen atom from 15
  to the C-5' position of SAM and/or 5'-deoxyadenosine (14) during turnover has been
  demonstrated. Subsequent radical mediated deamination of intermediate 22 (shown
  in ) to generate 16 may involve a 1,2-migration of the amino group (from C-4 to
  C-3), reminiscent of the catalytic mechanisms of ethanolamine ammonia lyase– and
  the dioldehydratases.,– The latter two enzymes rely on adenosylcobalamin instead
  of SAM to facilitate the radical induced 1,2-amino or 1,2-hydroxyl migration during
  the conversion of ethanolamine or ethylene glycol to acetaldehyde. DesII, therefore,
  represents an ideal system for detailed analysis and direct comparison of the chemistry
  underlying radical SAM versus adenosylcobalamin dependent radical mediated rearrangements
  in enzymology.
