caption: 'Simplified, schematic representation of flavonoid biosynthesis in A. thaliana
  with a focus on proanthocyanidins. Essential steps of the flavonoid biosyntheses
  leading to proanthocyanidins (PAs) in the seed are presented. Enzymes and transcriptional
  regulators (grey shaded) are indicated by bold, capital letters; corresponding mutant
  plant lines are in italics. Dashed arrows tag multiple steps which are not fully
  understood. The question mark indicates a limited knowledge of this biosynthetic
  step and a restricted understanding of the involvement of the associated factors.
  Abbreviations are as follows: ANR/BAN anthocyanidin reductase, AHA10 P-type H+-ATPase,
  CHS chalcone synthase, CHI chalcone isomerase, DFR dihydroflavonol 4-reductase,
  EGL3 enhancer of glabra3, F3 H flavanone 3β-hydroxylase, F3''H flavonoid 3''-hydroxylase,
  GL3 glabra3, GST glutathione S transferase, LAC laccase-like, LDOX leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase, MATE multidrug and toxic compound extrusion-type transporter, PAP production
  of anthocyanin pigments, TT transparent testa, TTG transparent testa glabra, UGTs
  UDP dependent glycosyltransferases. Modified from [,,].'
