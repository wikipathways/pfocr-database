caption: Schematic illustration of the enzymatic synthesis of NO, CO, and H2S and
  downstream signaling able to maintain maternal and feto-placental homeostasis. NO
  (upper panel) is formed by neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible
  NOS (iNOS) from L-Arginine. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and -2 (HO-2) enzymes degrade
  heme to generate CO, iron, and biliverdin (middle panel). Three enzymes have been
  identified to enzymatically generate H2S (Lower panel), cystathionine β-synthase
  (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase (3MST).
  CBS and CSE produce H2S using L-cysteine. In an alternative pathway, 3-mercaptopyruvate
  (3-MP), the substrate for 3MST to produce H2S, is provided by cysteine aminotransferase
  (CAT) using L-Cysteine and D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) using D-Cysteine, respectively.
  The blue arrow lines indicate downstream signals of gasotransmitters in the maintenance
  of homeostasis in pregnancy. NO and CO both can activate soluble guanylate cyclase
  (sGC) to increase cGMP, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation. The large-conductance
  Ca2+-activated K+ channel (BKCa) can also be regulated by NO and CO to elicit vasodilatation.
  Additionally, through the activation of ATP-sensitive K+-channels (KATP), H2S can
  cause vasodilation in pregnancy.
