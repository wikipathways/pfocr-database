caption: Simplified schematic presentation of the transcriptional hierarchy of essential
  factors and signaling pathways during endocrine specification of the pancreatic
  endoderm. The pdx1+/ptf1a+ population (orange) is the earliest cell type defining
  the pancreatic lineage beginning with the evagination of the pancreatic buds. With
  the fusion of the dorsal and ventral buds pdx1 and other transcription factors are
  downregulated (though still detectable) and endocrine cells that are marked by expression
  of ngn3 (green) become visible in the epithelium of the ducts. An intermediate cell
  type, presumably an hnf1b+ precursor duct cell (gray) is considered to be an ngn3-precursor.
  Proliferation of ngn3+ cells is negatively regulated by the notch signaling pathway
  via the repressor Hes1. Pax4+ cells (pale blue) are an intermediate cell type directly
  regulated by ngn3 and function as a switch to specify between β-cells (blue) and
  Δ-cells (dark green). Arrows point to the developmental step at which indicated
  transcription factors play an essential role. The time line along the bottom of
  the diagram shows the differentiation stages which have been achieved by in vitro
  differentiation alone or by a combination of in vitro differentiation and in vivo
  maturation.
