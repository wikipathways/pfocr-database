caption: Molecular mechanism of PGRN in intervertebral disc degeneration. (A) The
  expressions of PGRN, IL-10 and IL-17 in peripheral blood and intervertebral disc
  tissue of IDD patients were significantly increased. In the animal model, the loss
  of PGRN led to the decrease of IL-10 expression and the increase of IL-17 expression,
  which accelerated the loss of proteoglycan and the destruction of intervertebral
  disc. After stimulation with r-pgrn, the transcription level of IL-10 increased
  significantly. TNF-α significantly increased the transcription and protein levels
  of IL-17, while r-pgrn significantly inhibited the expression of IL-17 induced by
  TNF-α. (B) The expression levels of OB marker genes ALP, osteix, CoL-I, BSP, AXIN2
  and Runx2 were significantly increased in PGRN knockout mice, Bone formation in
  IVD. The levels of Col, MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 in cartilage tissue of PGRN-deficient
  mice were significantly increased, and proteoglycan loss and cartilage degradation
  in endplate cartilage were serious. The expressions of TRAP and Cathepsin K were
  significantly increased in the new osteoblasts, BV/TV and Th.Tb decreased significantly,
  The activity of OC increased. In addition, on the one hand, PGRN deficiency caused
  the over activation of NF-κB signalling pathway, and the levels of NF-κB, PIκB-α,
  IL-1β and iNOS were significantly increased, which led to the accelerated degradation
  of IVD. On the other hand, PGRN deficiency caused the activation of Wnt/β-catenin
  signalling pathway, and the levels of AXIN2, Runx2 and β-Catenin were significantly
  increased, which induced abnormal bone formation
