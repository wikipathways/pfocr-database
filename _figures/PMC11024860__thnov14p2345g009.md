caption: 'Working Model: HDAC6 maintains primordial follicle dormancy. HDAC6 is highly
  expressed in primordial follicles. HDAC6 forms a protein complex with NGF, BDNF,
  TGF-β, and TSC2. HADC6 deacetylates NGF, and acetylated NGF is degraded by ubiquitination.
  Low levels of NGF cannot activate the mTOR signaling pathway, rendering primordial
  follicles dormant. HDAC6 gradually decreases during the development of primordial
  to primary follicles. NGF is not modified by deacetylation and cannot be degraded
  by ubiquitination. The elevated NGF activates the mTOR signaling pathway; thus,
  primordial follicles are activated to develop into primary follicles'
