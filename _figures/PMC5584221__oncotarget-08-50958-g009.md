caption: AS indicated, LPS promoted GRP78/Src interaction and subsequent activation,
  leading to increased ROS generation and Rho activation, however, by suppressing
  GRP78/Src interaction, the CYP2J2-EETs inhibited ROS production and Rho-ROCK activation.
  At the same time, VE-cadherin and MLC phosphorylation was also interrupted, thus
  suppressed LPS induced barrier dysfunction eventually.
