caption: Schematic of the mechanism by which sodium channel inhibition exerts anti-tumor
  effects. Ouabain activates caspase through the mitochondrial pathway, induces hypoosmotic
  stress by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, sensitizes cells to anoikis, and inhibits
  tumor cell metastasis. Canagliflozin has the capacity to down-regulate oxidative
  phosphorylation, reduce the intracellular concentration of ATP, up-regulate AMPK
  phosphorylation, and induce cell cycle arrest in the G1/G0 phase, as well as apoptosis.
  The objective is to stimulate STING expression, activate the IRF3/IFN-β pathway,
  and ultimately inhibit AKT phosphorylation and tumor growth. Celecoxib was observed
  to downregulate NHE-1, increase Ca2+ content, and induce apoptosis via activated
  calpain9. Diphenylhydantoin has been demonstrated to target the Nav1.5 channel,
  reducing the content of MMP9 and MMP2, inhibiting the acidification of the extracellular
  matrix, and reducing the migration and invasion ability of tumors
