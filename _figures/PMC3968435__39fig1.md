caption: Mechanisms of action for the NO2− in cardiovascular diseases. Under normal
  conditions, NO2− is fairly stable and available from conventional L-arginine/NOS
  pathway, NO2− therapy, and dietary consumption of NO3−/NO2− leading to salivary
  NO3− secretion and reduction to NO2− by commensal bacteria. However, during ischemia,
  low pH, and hypoxia, NO2− is reduced to NO via deoxyhemoglobin, deoxymyoglobin,
  xanthine oxidoreductase, myoglobin, and aldehyde oxidase. NO induces EC migration,
  proliferation, and angiogenesis by activating cGMP/PKG, Ras-Raf, and MAPK signaling
  pathways. NO activates HIF-1 and heme oxygenase 1 pathways to increase VEGF production,
  which can increase NO in turn by upregulating eNOS activity. NO2− therapy confers
  substantial benefit to cardiovascular disease. cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate;
  HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases; NO3−,
  nitrate; NO2−, nitrite; PKG, protein kinase G; RBC, red blood cell; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; sGC, solube guanylate cyclase.
