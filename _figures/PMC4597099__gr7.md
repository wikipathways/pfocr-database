  Target Gene ExpressionEstrogen binding to ER promotes its recruitment to ER enhancers.
  A3B, recruited to these regions through interaction with ER, provides enzymatic
  conversion of C to U. Generation of U:G mismatches promotes DNA nicks through the
  action of UNG and AP endonuclease, resulting in DNA cleavage and repair by the non-homologous
  end-joining DNA repair pathway. Induction of transient C-to-U changes stimulates
  chromatin modification and remodeling and PolII recruitment to facilitate expression
  of ER target genes.
