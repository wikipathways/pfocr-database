caption: '—Domain organization and TCSs signaling. The canonical structure of HKs
  is composed of: 1) a highly variable N-terminal sequence that determines which stimulus
  is perceived by the HK (sensing-D); 2) and both histidine kinase A (H(X)) (including
  a phosphorylatable histidine residue in the H-box and an X-box) and histidine kinase-like
  ATPase catalytic (including four distinct boxes: the N-, G1-, F-, and G2-boxes)
  subdomains. In prokaryotes, TCSs usually consist of a two-step phosphorelay between
  an HK and an RR. Perception of a stimulus induces autophosphorylation of the HK
  which thus acts as a primary sensor, and the phosphate is then transferred to an
  RR which acts as a transcription factor to directly regulate a series of genes required
  for an adapted response. Most eukaryotic HKs harbor an additional C-terminal receiver
  domain (REC) characterized by the presence of a three amino acid signature (DDK).
  Thus, eukaryotic HKs are generally called hybrid HKs (HHKs). In eukaryotes, TCSs
  are composed of additional modules, such as the Hpt domain and the signaling routes
  that mediate the perception of stimuli correspond to a multistep phosphorelay between
  three families of proteins (HHK, Hpt, and RR). In most eukaryotic TCSs, the RR either
  acts directly as a transcription factor or governs downstream elements (MAPK cascades,
  the cAMP pathway, or Raf-like kinases). Note that in a few HKs, the Hpt domain is
  fused to the REC domain.'
