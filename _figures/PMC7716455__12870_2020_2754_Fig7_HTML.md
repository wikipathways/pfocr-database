caption: The protein-protein interaction networks were significantly enriched in the
  biological pathways including (a) photosynthesis, (b) flavonoid biosynthesis, and
  (c) MAPK signaling pathway. The node represents a certain gene, and the number of
  interacting proteins is displayed in the shades of color and the font size in leaves
