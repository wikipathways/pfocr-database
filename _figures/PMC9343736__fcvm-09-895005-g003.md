caption: Contribution of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition to vascular calcification.
  Endothelial cells (ECs) undergoing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT)
  are more likely to participate in vascular calcification (VC). TGF-β and bone morphogenetic
  protein (BMP) act on a tetrameric receptor complex to induce Smad-dependent signaling
  and regulate VC. TGF-β induces TGFBRII to activate TGFBRI. Type I receptors recruit
  and activate downstream Smad2/3/4 and Smad protein complexes to gather in the nucleus
  and act as transcriptional factors, thereby promoting VC. Inflammation stimulates
  decreased FGFR1 expression levels in EC. Interrupted fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
  signal transduction increases TGFBRI expression, loses the effective inhibition
  of TGF-β cascade reaction, and initiates EndMT. BMP transmits osteogenic signals
  by binding to activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)1/2/3/6 and phosphorylating Smad1/5/8.
  Smad1/5/8 and Smad4 form a quaternary complex isomer complex and translocate to
  the nucleus to promote osteogenic gene Runx2/Cbfa1 expression. The inflammatory
  factors, TNF-α and IL-1β, downregulate BMPR2 in aortic ECs, rendering ECs sensitive
  to osteogenic differentiation promoted by BMP9. TNF-α and IL-1β also promote EndMT
  by reducing JNK signal transduction. The calcification inhibitor matrix Gla protein
  (MGP) suppressed the effect of BMP2/4. Increased BMP4 expression also induces MGP
  expression; therefore, this negative feedback inhibits BMP2 and 4 osteogenesis.
  MGP deletion promotes EndMT. SOX2 is closely related to the osteogenic differentiation
  of ECs. BMP enhances SOX2 expression induced by Notch signaling, and SOX2 amplifies
  the osteogenic effect of the BMP4 signaling pathway.
