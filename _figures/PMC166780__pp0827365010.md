caption: A, The mitochondrial ETC transfers electrons from carbon oxidation to O2,
  producing water. ETC complexes I, III, and IV generate proton motive force used
  to produce ATP via ATP synthase (not shown). When some components in the ETC become
  more highly reduced, single-electron reduction of O2 gives rise to superoxide and
  subsequently other ROS. The ROS may act as important signaling molecules in the
  cell but in excess may also cause oxidative damage. The plant ETC is branched at
  ubiquinone (Q) so that electrons can pass to O2 via AOX, thus bypassing complex
  III, cyt c, and complex IV. This provides a potential mechanism to (a) modulate
  the rate of ATP production; (b) maintain electron transport when other downstream
  ETC components or ADP are limiting; and (c) modulate the reduction state of ETC
  components, thus, regulating the rate of ROS generation. B, Pathways of PCD in tobacco
  cells. H2O2 or SA induce a mitochondria-dependent pathway in which cyt pathway function
  is disabled by cyt c release. Cantharidin induces a mitochondria-independent pathway
  not dependent upon cyt c release. Both pathways cause an early general depression
  of whole-cell respiratory activity, the occurrence of which is independent of mitochondrial
  dysfunction, and both pathways result in a similar extent and timing of cell death
  and DNA laddering. Antisense cells lacking AOX have increased susceptibility to
  both PCD pathways. This may relate to the ability of AOX to modulate mitochondrial
  function or to prevent chronic oxidative stress in the cell.
