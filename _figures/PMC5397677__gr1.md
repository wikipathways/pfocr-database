  description: Signaling pathways relevant to glial neoplasms in adults and children.
    A variety of signaling pathways are activated through mutations of oncogenes or

    activation through receptor tyrosine kinase activation or downstream gene mutations
    and rearrangements (BRAF, NF1, RAS) is a universal feature of glial neoplasms.
