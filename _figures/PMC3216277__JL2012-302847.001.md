caption: 'Within the intestinal lumen, the micellar solubilization of sterols facilitates
  movement through the diffusion barrier overlying the surface of the absorptive cells.
  In the presence of bile acids, large amounts of the sterol molecules are delivered
  to the aqueous-membrane interface so that their uptake rate is greatly increased.
  The Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1), a newly identified sterol influx transporter,
  is located at the apical membrane of the enterocyte and may actively facilitate
  the uptake of cholesterol and plant sterols by promoting the passage of these molecules
  across the brush border membrane of the enterocyte. In contrast, ABCG5/G8 promote
  active efflux of cholesterol and plant sterols from the enterocyte into the intestinal
  lumen for excretion. The combined regulatory effects of NPC1L1 and ABCG5/G8 play
  a critical role in modulating the amount of cholesterol that reaches the lymph from
  the intestinal lumen. Ezetimibe may reduce cholesterol uptake by the enterocytes
  through the NPC1L1 pathway, possibly a transporter-facilitated mechanism. Absorbed
  cholesterol as well as some that is newly synthesized from acetate by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase (HMGCR) within the enterocyte is esterified by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase
  isoform 2 (ACAT2) to form cholesteryl esters. It is likely that fatty acids (FA)
  and monoacylglycerol (MG) could be taken up into enterocytes by facilitated transport.
  With the assistance of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), fatty acids and monoacylglycerol
  are transported into the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) where they are used
  for the synthesis of diacylglycerol (DG) and then triacylglycerol (TG). Glucose
  is transported into the SER for the synthesis of phospholipids (PL) through the
  phosphatidic acid (PA) pathway (abbreviation: α-GP, α-glycerophosphate). All of
  these lipids participate in the formation of chylomicrons, a process which also
  requires the synthesis of apolipoprotein (APO)-B48 and the activity of microsomal
  triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP). As observed in lymph, the core of the secreted
  chylomicrons contains triglycerides and cholesteryl esters and the surface of the
  particles is a monolayer containing phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylcholine, unesterified
  cholesterol and apolipoproteins including APO-B48, APO-AI, and APO-AIV. Therefore,
  intestinal cholesterol absorption is a multistep process that is regulated by multiple
  genes. Reproduced with modifications and with permission from [].'
