caption: 'Proposed Model of TRAIL-Susceptiblity in Breast Tumour Subpopulations: (a)
  Epithelial-like cells have cytoplasmic cFLIP and consequently are resistant to TRAIL-mediated
  apoptosis. (b) Mesenchymal-like cells have comparatively reduced cytoplasmic cFLIP
  and elevated nuclear cFLIP due to its role in the relatively more active Wnt pathway,
  and are consequently TRAIL sensitive (c) The consequences of cFLIP inhibition: sensitisation
  to TRAIL, reduction in Wnt signalling and potentially a reduction in bCSC self-renewal
  and proliferation'

  cancer stem/progenitor-like cells to TRAIL.
