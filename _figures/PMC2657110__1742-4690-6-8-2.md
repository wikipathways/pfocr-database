caption: HIV-1 modulates the interferon-induced antiviral host mechanisms, protein
  kinase R and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthesis. Structure in blue represents generic
  retrovirus transcript with highly structured 5' UTR. Left panel illustrates the
  2',5'-oligoadenylate synthesis (2-5OAS) pathway that typically results in RNAseL
  activation and cleavage of viral double-stranded RNA. Vertical lines within RNaseL
  indicate ankyrin repeats. Right panel illustrates the double-stranded RNA-inducible
  PKR pathway. PKR is depicted by the green N-terminal double-stranded RNA binding
  motif (dsRBM) with central domain and C-terminal kinase domain depicted by pink
  line. Tat transactivation response element (TAR) RNA binding protein (TRBP), Tat,
  and 2-5OAS proteins are marked. Tat 86 and Tat 72 indicate the 86 amino acid and
  72 amino acid isoforms of HIV-1 Tat. Circles labeled with P indicate phosphorylation.
  Black arrows indicate normal progression through the pathway. Red block arrows and
  text boxes outlined in red indicate points of interaction and modulation by HIV-1.
