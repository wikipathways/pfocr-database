caption: Illustration represents the polyphenols targeting the NF-κB pathway associated
  with Alzheimer's disease. Inappropriate breakdown of amyloid precursor protein by
  beta and gamma-secretase results in the creation of amyloid-beta plaque, which in
  turn leads to mitochondrial malfunction and apoptosis, which ultimately results
  in Alzheimer's disease. Cytokines and toxins also are responsible for activating
  the NF-κB pathway, which ultimately results in inflammation in the nervous system
  and ultimately leads to Alzheimer's disease state
