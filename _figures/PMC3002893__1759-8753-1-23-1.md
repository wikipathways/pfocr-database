caption: Schematic of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) induction pathway. DNA damage
  or stalled replication forks during S-phase activates a sensor complex that recruits
  Mec1 to the site. Mec1 then activates a mediator kinase; either Mrc1 at stalled
  replication forks, or Rad9 at damaged sites. The activated mediator kinase then
  activates the effector kinase Rad53, which subsequently phosphorylates Dun1. The
  activated Dun1 protein phosphorylates the transcriptional repressor Rfx1 (Crt1),
  thereby inactivating it and allowing for increased transcription of the RNR genes.
  Sml1 binds and keeps inactive the large RNR1 subunit; Dun1 phosphorylation of Sml1
  causes it to release RNR1, and the enzyme becomes active. RNR converts NTPs to dNTPs
  as needed for DNA synthesis and repair. Only the pathway components most relevant
  to this study are shown.
