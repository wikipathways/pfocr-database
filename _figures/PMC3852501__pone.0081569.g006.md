caption: Activations of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and STAT (signal transducers
  and activators of transcription) negatively regulate chondrocyte proliferation and
  differentiation. MAPK signaling includes sequential stimulation of a signaling cascade
  involving RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK. CNP binding to natriuretic peptide receptor-B
  induces the generation of the second messenger cGMP, which activates PKG and leads
  to attenuation of the MAPK pathway by inhibiting RAF activation. NF449 , A31 , and
  P3  are recently identified FGFR3 inhibitors. NF449 and A31 have inhibitory effects
  on the kinase activity of FGFR3. P3 has an affinity for extracellular domain of
  FGFR3. Meclozine attenuates ERK phosphorylation.
