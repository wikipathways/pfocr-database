caption: 'Multiple mechanisms are involved in autophagy-mediated tumor suppression:
  limit genotoxic damage and maintain chromosome stability by removing damaged or
  surplus organelles (e.g. mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum); restrict inflammation
  by controlling NF-κB activation, blocking cell necrosis, eliminating pathogens;
  regulating signaling involved in tumorigenesis (particularly, the cell survival
  and proliferation signaling, e.g. mTOR, NF-κB) by modulating signaling regulatory
  proteins (e.g. mTOR) or by degrading signaling regulatory proteins (e.g. IKK, NIK),
  long-lived proteins, proteasome and other organelles; or direct kill harmful cells
  by type II programmed cell death/autophagic cell death. While autophagy plays an
  essential role in preventing tumor formation, it may also contribute to tumor progression
  by allowing tumor cells survival under metabolic stress (low-oxygen and low-nutrient,
  a common occurrence in tumors). In addition, it may protect some tumor cells against
  anticancer treatments by blocking the apoptotic pathway and lowering immune-mediated
  tumor surveillance (also see ).'
