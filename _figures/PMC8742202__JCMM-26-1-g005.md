caption: The schematic representation of the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway in skeletal development.
  Upon ligation Wnts to their specific receptors that contain the frizzled proteins
  (FZD4) and LRP5/6, the cytoplasmic protein dishevelled is promoted to induce the
  inhibition of GSK3β. Then, as a transcription factor, β‐catenin binds to the TCF/LEF
  transcription factors and leads to the transcription of downstream target genes.
  Competitive recruitment of β‐catenin by SMAD4 controls the balance between proliferation
  and matrix synthesis of osteoblasts. SMAD4 lacking can put the availability of β‐catenin
  on increase to transactivate Tcf/Lef, hence enhancing ‘proliferation’ in response
  to canonical Wnt signalling. The figure is redrawn from Ref. []
