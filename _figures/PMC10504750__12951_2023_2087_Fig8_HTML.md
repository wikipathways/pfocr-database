caption: 'The simulation of signaling pathway by which Exo/LPS pre-Exo modulates the
  immune response to allografts. Step 1: LPS was recognized by macrophages and induced
  upregulation of NLRP3, IL-1β and IL-18 expression through the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  Step 2: After being endocytosed, LPS pre-Exo interacted with the NF-κB for preventing
  its activation and inhibited the expression of NLRP3 with suppressing the synthesis
  of NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent production of IL-1β and IL-18. Step 3: In the
  subsequent immune response, following administration of LPS pre-Exo which induced
  alternation in the polarization of macrophages for expanding the ratio of M2 with
  CD86+ macrophages. Taken together, the functional outcome is to suppress the innate
  immune response'
