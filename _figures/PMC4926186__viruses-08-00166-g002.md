caption: 'Alphavirus nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) reduces interferon (IFN)-stimulated
  gene (ISG) expression by inducing transcriptional shutoff via RNA polymerase II
  (RNA pol II)-mediated host cell transcription by degradation of RNA polymerase subunit
  RPB1 and blocking the IFN-induced janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of
  transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Viral envelope (E) proteins activate the unfolded
  protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and together with kinases
  such as protein kinase R (PKR) phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  2α (eIF2α). The subsequent induction of stress granules (SG) is inhibited by viral
  nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3), which sequesters Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding
  protein (G3BP) into viral granules that favor viral replication. General translational
  shutoff is additionally induced by alphavirus infection independent of eIF2α phosphorylation.
  Abbreviations: interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR); tyrosine kinase (TYK); interferon
  regulatory factor (IRF); interferon stimulated response element (ISRE).'
