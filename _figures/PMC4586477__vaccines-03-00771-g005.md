caption: Many signals overlap with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in tumor-specific CD8+ T
  cells. PI3K/AKT signaling is a canonical pathway enriched for molecules corresponding
  to differentially expressed genes of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells from the tumor
  relative to the periphery (p-value = 4.1E-2, right-tailed Fisher Exact Test). These
  molecules are outlined in purple with red fill representing overexpression and green
  fill representing decreased expression in T cells from the tumor relative to the
  periphery; color intensity corresponds to the extent of expression difference. mTOR
  (or FRAP1) was previously published as being down-regulated in TIL and was predicted
  by our analysis to be an upstream regulator of differential gene expression (fold-change
  = −3.1, and p-value of overlap = 2E-2, right-tailed Fisher Exact Test). Differentially-expressed
  genes and corresponding fold-changes have been previously published and were reanalyzed
  through the use of QIAGEN’s Ingenuity®Pathway Analysis (IPA®, QIAGEN Redwood City,
  www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) []. Both direct and indirect relationships were assessed
  in the Ingenuity knowledge base reference set with a confidence threshold of previous
  experimental observation in T cells.
