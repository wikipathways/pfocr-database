caption: (A) Double stranded breaks (DSB) are resolved through either homologous recombination
  or the non-homologous end joining pathway. In the loss of CHEK2 function scenario,
  the functionality of the HR pathway is reduced, and the ability to resolve double
  stranded breaks fully and accurately, is diminished. Subsequently, the DNA damage
  response pathway attempts to resolve the DSB through the NHEJ pathway, which is
  less accurate and leads to the accumulation of somatic mutations. (B) The accumulation
  of somatic mutations produces fragments of DNA that exit the nucleus through vesicles.
  When DNA is released from these vesicles, cGAS recognizes the presence of cytosolic
  DNA and activates the downstream effectors of the cGAS-STING pathway. (C) The secondary
  mechanism of immune cell recruitment including CD8 T cell infiltration because of
  CHEK2 deficiency maybe through the downstream signaling cascade leading to the production
  of Type I Interferon and chemotaxis inducing cytokines following cGAS-STING pathway
  activation
