caption: Model of nongenomic signaling of aldosterone in mouse OMCD intercalated cells
  to stimulate H+-ATPase activity. Aldosterone stimulates H+-ATPase activity through
  a major pathway requiring Gαq proteins, phospholipase C, intracellular Ca2+, PKC,
  and ERK1/2. A second interlinked pathway involves cAMP and PKA. The PKA-dependent
  pathway is likely upstream of PKC and ERK1/2 because inhibition of this pathway
  blocks the cAMP/PKA-dependent stimulation of H+-ATPase activity. Chelation of Ca2+
  may interfere at several stages because Ca2+ may be involved in stimulation of PKC
  isoforms as well as in the exocytic insertion of H+-ATPases into the membrane, which
  has been shown earlier to occur during stimulation of H+-ATPase activity (, ). Inhibitors
  and activators of signaling molecules used in this study are shown in italics.
