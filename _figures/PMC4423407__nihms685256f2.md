caption: Biosynthesis and metabolic activation of the estrogens E1 and E2. Metabolic
  activation of E1 and E2 leads to 2- and 4-catechol derivatives, which further oxidize
  to yield the corresponding reactive quinones. The quinones react with DNA to form
  depurinating DNA adducts. In the deactivation pathway, which operates in parallel,
  the catechol derivatives are methylated to form methoxy catechol estrogens; in addition,
  the quinones are reduced by quinone reductase, as well as conjugated with GSH, and,
  thus, are rendered harmless. The shift in the apparent balance between these activating
  and deactivating pathways towards formation of depurinating DNA adducts could lead
  to the initiation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
papertitle: Urinary biomarkers suggest that estrogen-DNA adducts may play a role in
  the aetiology of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
