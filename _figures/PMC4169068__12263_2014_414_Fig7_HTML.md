caption: Concept explaining the effects of the zinc matrix metalloproteinase ZMP-2
  on stress resistance in C. elegans as impaired by the transport of oxidized cholesterol
  adducts. Extracellular cholesterol can be exploited by the cells subsequent to its
  transport requiring VIT-6 and RME-2, in order to trigger the steroid signalling
  pathway. Extracellular ROS, however, can oxidize cholesterol or lipoproteins before
  their cellular uptake. Once inside the cell, oxidized cholesterol causes a cellular
  response which involves DAF-16 and consequently inhibits DAF-9 and DAF-12. Those
  effects are associated with reduced stress resistance and can be prevented either
  by reducing the uptake of oxidized cholesterol adducts or by ZMP-2, which is suggested
  to degrade such cytotoxic products
