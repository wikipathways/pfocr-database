caption: TM4SF1 promotes the development and migration of cancer cells. TM4SF1 promotes
  cancer by modulating various biological behaviors of cancer and inhibits cancer
  cell apoptosis by regulating caspase-9, caspase-3, BCL-2, Bax, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway, and ROS-related pathways, and promotes cell proliferation by modulating
  the PCNA, cyclin D1, and YAP-TEAD pathways. TM4SF1 interacts with collagen I and
  induces metastatic reactivation. Soluble collagen I induces DDR1 aggregation at
  the cell surface and recruitment of TM4SF1 and enhances the interaction between
  DDR1 and TM4SF1, thus forming DDR1-TM4SF1 clusters at the cell surface. TM4SF1 functions
  as a membrane adaptor connecting DDR1 to syntenin2. Then, DDR1 activates PKC and
  the JAK2/STAT3 pathway through TM4SF1-mediated non-canonical DDR1 signaling by promoting
  the activation of PKC via recruitment of syntenin-2, thus inducing transphosphorylation
  and activation of JAK2/STAT3. TM4SF1 upregulates the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
  TM4SF1 can form a complex with CD13 to promote cell migration and invasion. In addition,
  TM4SF1 activates the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway. TM4SF1 is a partner of DVL2 and
  positively modulates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by enhancing DVL2-Axin interaction.
  TM4SF1 is induced by Kras signaling, and reduction of TM4SF1 promotes the ubiquitination
  of β-catenin. ADAM23 and miR-206 regulate the expression of TM4SF1, and prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE2) significantly inhibits the expression of miR-206, while increasing the
  expression of TM4SF1. LINC00707 functions as a molecular sponge of miR-206, and
  in this way indirectly regulates the expression of TM4SF1. miR-203 and miR-141 inhibit
  EMT by regulating TM4SF1-mediated modulation of E-cadherin, CK19, and VEGF-A expression.
  TM4SF1 regulates E-cadherin expression through the AKT signaling pathway. MiR-30a/c
  inhibits cancer stem-like characteristics by regulating TM4SF1. TM4SF1 suppresses
  the transcription of the pluripotency factors Sox2 and Oct4, suggesting that TM4SF1
  promotes breast CSC traits. TM4SF1 interacts with integrins to stimulate VEGF-A
  to affect angiogenesis. TM4SF1 is associated with myosin-10 and β-actin, which are
  associated with filopodia generation. In conclusion, TM4SF1 promotes the migration
  of cancer cells by inducing EMT; enhancing self-renewal ability, tumor angiogenesis,
  and invadopodia formation; and regulating related signaling pathways.
