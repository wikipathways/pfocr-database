caption: 'Wnt signaling pathways. Wnt ligands can transduce their signal through at
  least three Frizzled-dependent (Fz) pathways: the canonical, the calcium, and the
  PCP pathways, all of which involve the activation of Dishevelled (Dvl). The canonical
  pathway requires the co-receptors Lrp5/6 to recruit Dvl and inhibit the “destruction
  complex” composed of Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), Axin, and Glycogen synthase
  3β (GSK3β). Wnt binding leads to the phosphorylation of GSK3β in this complex and,
  as a consequence, to the accumulation of unphosphorylated β-catenin, which can enter
  the nucleus and together with the transcription factors Tcf/Lef induce the expression
  of target genes. Activation of the calcium pathway results in an increase of cytosolic
  calcium (Ca2+) and the subsequent activation of calcium-dependent kinases (CaMKII).
  In the PCP pathway, activation of the transmembrane proteins Vangl, Celsr, and PTK7
  and the recruitment of the intracellular proteins Prickle and Daam lead to activation
  of Rho GTPases and JNK, promoting cytoskeleton remodeling. More recently, Fz-independent
  Wnt signaling has been described. Wnt ligands can bind directly to receptors such
  as Ryk or Ror. The intracellular signaling cascades activated in these cases are
  poorly understood.'
