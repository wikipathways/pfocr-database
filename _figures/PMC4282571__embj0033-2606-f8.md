caption: In unstimulated cells (ns), HP1 is brought to the promoter by histone H3K9
  methylation and acts as a transcriptional repressor.Shigella flexneri infection
  results in activation of the MAPK/MSK1 pathway, but this activation is rapidly dampened
  by OspF that dephosphorylates ERK. The combined effect of these two events is a
  moderate transcriptional activation of IL8. This causes HP1γ to leave the promoter,
  while inactivation of ERK prevents it from getting phosphorylated and join the transcription
  machinery. Consequently, accumulation of HP1γ at the IL8 gene drops.Upon ospF Shigella
  infection or treatment with PMA, the MAPK nuclear pathway is fully triggered, levels
  of histone H3 marks permissive for transcription are increased (H3S10), and the
  transcription machinery is recruited. Activation of the MAPK nuclear pathway induces
  HP1γ phosphorylation and allows for its recruitment to IL8 and other similarly regulated
  immune genes.In MEF KO cells, the loss of HP1γ eliminates an important checkpoint
  in the control of immune gene activation, leading to a deregulated possibly excessive
  gene expression in response to MAPK activation.
