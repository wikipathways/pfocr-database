caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of polyamines and 13C fractional enrichment
  of metabolites in the human and mouse fecal microbiome incubated with [U-13C]-inulin.
  (a) metabolites detected in the cellular fractions. (b) metabolites detected in
  culture media. Fresh fecal microbes were individually isolated from three healthy
  human subjects and three mice, then incubated separately with [U-13C]-inulin. The
  samples were analyzed by LC-HRMS as described in the materials and methods. The
  13C-carbons were traced through the ornithine-PUT-SPD and arginine-agmatine-spd
  pathways. The x-axis in the bar chart denotes the number of 13C atoms present in
  each metabolite, and the y-axis indicates the 13C fractional enrichment. Values
  shown are mean ± SEM (n = 3). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 as indicated
