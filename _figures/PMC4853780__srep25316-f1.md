caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for momilactones in rice. Both syn-pimara-7,15-dine
  and ent-kaurene, the key intermediates for momilactone and gibberellin, respectively,
  are synthesized from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) by sequential enzymatic reactions
  of type B and type A cyclases. In mosses and liverworts, cyclic diterpenes, such
  as ent-kaurene, are constructed by a bifunctional cyclase with type B and A activity
  in a single polypeptide.
