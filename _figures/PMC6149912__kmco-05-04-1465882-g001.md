caption: Inhibition of DDR1-BCR signaling by nilotinib. Collagens from the extracellular
  matrix (ECM) microenvironment of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells induce the kinase
  activity of DDR1 (Discoïdin Domain Receptor tyrosine kinase 1), which phosphorylates
  its substrate BCR (Breakpoint Cluster Region) on the tyrosine 177 (Y177), subsequently
  disrupting BCR/β-catenin interaction. This signaling cascade results in an increased
  β-catenin/TCF (T-Cell Factor) nuclear activity leading to the expression of critical
  target genes (including MYC, JUN, FOSL1, CD44, LGR5, CCND1) necessary for cell invasion
  and metastatic development (left panel). Inhibition of DDR1 kinase activity with
  nilotinib decreases CRC cell invasion and metastasis by reducing this β-catenin
  pathway (right panel).
