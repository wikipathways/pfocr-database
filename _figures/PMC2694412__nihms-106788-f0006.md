caption: Genetic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma frequently occur in genes of the
  MAPK signalling, p53 signalling, Wnt signalling, cell cycle and mTOR pathways. Oncoproteins
  are indicated in pink to red and tumour suppressor proteins are shown in light to
  dark blue. The darkness of the colours is positively correlated to the percentage
  of tumours with genetic alterations. Frequency of genetic alterations for each of
  these pathway members in 188 tumours is indicated. Genes (EGFR, FGFR1, FGFR4, KDR,
  EPHA3, KRAS, NRAS, MDM2 and CDK6) lying in regions of focal amplification were analysed
  for the percentage of samples with copy number amplification. Samples with greater
  than 2.5 and fewer than 1.5 DNA copies were considered as amplified and deleted,
  respectively. Selected components of each pathway are shown in the figure.
