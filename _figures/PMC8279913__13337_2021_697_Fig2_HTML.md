caption: Innate immune response to HCV infection and sites of intervention. Innate
  immune response to trigger interferon signalling upon HCV infection is depicted.
  Presence of viral RNA activates PRR (pattern recognition receptors) on the cell
  surface, cytoplasm, and endosomes and help to initiate an immunogenic response via
  PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular pattern). IRES (internal ribosome entry site)
  of HCV is recognized by RNA-dependent PKR (protein kinase R) whereas RIG-I (retinoic
  acid inducible gene I), another PRR recognizes unique features of sequences present
  in 3’ and 5’ region of HCV RNA. After viral recognition by RIG-I and PKR, longer
  HCV dsRNA intermediates activate endosomal TLR 3 (toll-like-receptor 3). Upon activation,
  PKR and RIG-I bind to MAVS (Mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein, also called
  VISA, IPS-1 and CARDIF) which via ubiquitinylation of Traf6 ultimately results in
  upregulation of interferon synthesis via the JNK pathway and activation of NFκB.
  Simultaneously, TLR3 signals are transmitted via the adapter molecule IFN-β /TRIF
  (Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing interferon-β). ds RNA activated
  protein kinase R (PKR) plays a major role in host antiviral defence, by phosphorylating
  and thereby inhibiting eIF2α (eukaryotic elongation initiation factor 2α subunit).
  Inhibition of eIF2α decreases cellular mRNA translation which may ultimately culminate
  in induction of apoptosis. HCV can however escape via induced phosphorylation of
  protein kinase R thereby inactivating it and is one of the probable reason for HCV
  persistence. Either way, viral protein synthesis is not affected by PKR induced
  stall in mRNA translation due to an IRES (internal ribose entry site) dependent
  manner. HCV can also escape immune response by NS3-4A serine protease complex mediated
  cleavage of MAVS and TRIF. This blocks the production of IFN-β in infected liver
  cells. Circulating dendritic cells and macrophages are also activated to produce
  an interferon response upon activation by PAMPS in the hepatocytes. Ultimately in
  response to activation by NFκB and JNK pathway, interferons are secreted which aim
  to create an antiviral state. Red stop dash arrows indicate points of intervention
  by viral proteins to stop the onset of immune response

  description: Innate immune response to HCV infection and sites of intervention.
    Innate immune response to trigger interferon signalling upon HCV infection is
