caption: Endoplasmic reticulum stress in Kupffer cells. Under metabolic and inflammatory
  conditions, the UPR signaling pathway is activated in the ER. In macrophages, TLR
  signaling pathway induces ER stress, and TLR2 and TLR4 induce activation of IRE1α,
  followed by activation of xbp1, through a mechanism that requires the NADPH oxidase
  NOX2 and TRAF6. ATF6, by mediating a proinflammatory synergy between ER stress and
  TLR activation is involved in the development of liver injury. The TLR signaling
  pathway adaptively inhibits the ATF4-CHOP branch of the UPR in a TRIF-dependent
  manner. Activated KCs then release cytokines such as TNF to act synergistically
  with other immune cells to exacerbate hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. TLR, toll-like
  receptor; TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated 6; TRIF, TIR structural domain-containing
  adapter-induced interferon-β.
