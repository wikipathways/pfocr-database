caption: Schematic diagram illustrates the mechanism of TGF‐β1 regulation of Cx43
  in chondrocytes. The green lines point to Smad‐dependent pathways elucidated by
  the current study, and the blue dotted lines are potential mechanisms not included
  in the present study. TGF‐β1 induced the canonical Smad signalling pathway, the
  activated TβRI phosphorylates the R‐Smads (Smad2, Smad3), transform them into transcriptional
  co‐regulator together with Smad4, and dock to potential binding site of promoter
  of Gja1 which encodes Cx43. As a result, Cx43 accumulated more on cell border and
  phosphorylated into functional gap junctions with larger size. Cx43, connexin43;
