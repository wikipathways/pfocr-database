caption: Nineteen metabolites were identified as differentially regulated between
  control and patient cells; these were used to define a network with inferred protein
  and metabolite interactions (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software [IPA]). Predicted
  activity in the network was calculated by derivation from the findings within the
  Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IKB) database between the unknown molecule and its known
  neighbours (Molecule Activity Predictor [MAP] in IPA). Purple highlight indicates
  involvement with insulin signalling (13/44).
