caption: 'Schematic overview of glycine metabolism and six genetic loci for glycine
  in/near genes encoding enzymes related to glycine metabolism. GLDC (glycine decarboxylase)
  and GCSH (glycine cleavage system protein H) are part of the glycine cleavage system,
  the major enzyme complex responsible for glycine degradation. PHGDH (phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase) and PSPH (phosphoserine phosphatase) encode enzymes involved in the
  de novo biosynthesis of serine, which can be converted into and synthesised from
  glycine. The interconversion of glycine and serine serves as an important source
  of methyl groups in the folate cycle, a metabolic pathway of which the enzyme encoded
  by ALDH1L1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1) is a component. CPS1 (carbamoyl-phosphate
  synthase 1) encodes the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step of the urea
  cycle which is responsible for the detoxification of ammonia. Glycine breakdown
  produces ammonia; changes in the efficiency of the urea cycle are therefore likely
  to have upstream effects on glycine metabolism. THF: tetrahydrofolate, 5,10-MTHF:
