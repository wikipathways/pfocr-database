caption: Visualization of metabolic changes in of H. rhodopensis during selected states
  of desiccation and recovery. Values correspond to the averaged meanings of metabolites
  in the context of sucrose biosynthesis (pink), glycolysis (red), Calvin cycle (light
  green), pentose phosphate pathway (orange), glycerophospholipid metabolism (yellow),
  valine and glutamate degradation (dark green), glyoxylate cycle (light blue), and
  TCA cycle (dark blue) metabolic pathways. Bars from left to right represent the
  C, D1, D2, D3, R1, and R2 states, respectively, as defined in Figure  The colored
  nodes represent the metabolites changes during drought with Pearson correlation
  above 0.8. The blue ones represent the metabolites increasing and the red ones represent
  those with decreasing concentrations. Circled R represents enzymatic reaction.
