caption: The transcription factor AP-1 is activated through Jun and Fos that are phosphorylated
  by JNK. AP-1 upregulates PO activity, increases hemocytes phagocytosis, and upregulates
  genes expression for ROS detoxification. JNK expression is negatively regulated
  by miRNA-184a/b. Bacterial infection downregulates synthesis of miRNA-184, leading
  to deliverance of JNK pathway and activation of immune responses consequently, to
  protect pea aphid from infection and oxidative stress.
