caption: 'Metastatic cascade of OS to the lung. (A) Stage 1: dissemination of metastatic
  OS cells from primary site. Cancer cells induce OB to secrete RNAKL, which binds
  to OC, and lead to bone resorption. The increase of MMPs and cathepsins while decrease
  of TIMPs cause ECM degradation. Cancer cells secret SDF-1 to recruit MSCs, which
  in turn promote tumor growth and metastasis by secreting CCL-5. NK cells kill cancer
  cell through the interaction between NKG2D receptor and NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL).
  (B) Stage 2: transfer of OS cells in blood. The interaction between uPAR and FPR1
  enhances invasion of cancer cell and their entry into blood. RUNX2/OPN axis promotes
  adhesion of cancer cell to endothelia cell in lung. FASN and ID1 increase anoikis
  resistance in cancer cell by upregulating p-ERK1/2 and Bcl-xL and by activating
  PI3K/AKT pathway, respectively. (C) Stage 3: colonization of OS cells in lung. The
  ER stress-initiated UPR protects cancer cell from apoptosis by activating GRP78
  and ATF6, as well as through NF-κB pathway. The mechanical restriction of circulating
  cancer cells within lung microvasculature partly accounts for the propensity of
  lung metastasis. Tumor-secreted vesicles reach the lung in advance and direct cancer
  cell to transfer to the lung. OS, osteosarcoma; OB, osteoblast; OC, osteoclast;
