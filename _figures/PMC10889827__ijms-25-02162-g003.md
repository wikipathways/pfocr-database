caption: 'Ihh signaling plays a critical role in periosteal bone biology and shows
  complex interaction with other molecules. Ihh is one of the three mammalian homologues
  of Hh protein (violet pathway). Ptc, a twelve-pass membrane protein, binds the Ihh
  ligand. In the absence of the ligand, Ptc interacts with and inhibits Smo, a seven-pass
  membrane G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). When Ptc binds Ihh, its inhibitory effect
  on Smo is released, activating Smo. Then, Smo promotes the disbandment of the Gli-composite
  complex from microtubules, allowing full-length Gli to enter the nucleus and act
  as a transcriptional activator. During bone development and fracture repair, it
  is presumed that there is a synergy between Hh and BMP signaling (blue pathway).
  Together they enhance osteogenesis. However, in terms of chondrogenetic effect,
  the conclusion has not yet been determined. Ihh signaling also has several key functional
  interactions with PTHrP (green pathway). In fracture healing, PTHrP binds its receptor
  (PTHR1), a GPCR, and mediates periosteal osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity.
  During the growth of long bones, Ihh induces PTHrP expression. In turn, PTHrP delays
  the production of Ihh. Ihh/PTHrP, acting together, initiate a negative feedback
  loop that sustains chondrogenesis and generates a cartilage tumor. Hh: Hedgehog;
  Ihh: Indian hedgehog; Ptc: Patched; Smo: Smoothened; SUFU: suppressor of Fused;
  PTHrP: parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related peptide; PTHR1: type I PTH receptor; P:
  phosphorylation'
