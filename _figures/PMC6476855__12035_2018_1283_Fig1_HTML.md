caption: 'BDNF induces survival-related signaling mechanisms: BDNF induces survival-related
  signaling mechanisms: In physiological conditions, binding of BDNF to TrkB receptor
  in either paracrine or autocrine signaling elicits three distinct downstream pathways.
  BDNF-dependent phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-γ) can induce short-term signaling by
  increasing Ca2+ neuronal response and inhibit inflammatory-dependent apoptosis cascade
  (dashed lines) by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β). Induction
  of phosphatidylinositol 3-Phosphate (PI3K) induces transcription of BDNF mRNA by
  activating mTOR-dependent translation of BDNF. Additionally, BDNF can modulate gene
  regulation by activating NF-κB and CREB transcription factors by inducing Akt and
  Erk downstream pathways, respectively. Gene modulation induces neuronal survival,
  growth, long-term potentiation (LTP), and de novo expression of BDNF. In addition,
  BDNF-independent transactivation of TrkB can also play an important role in the
  neurotrophic pathway regulation by factors, such as adenosine, zinc, epidermal growth
  factor (EGF), glucocorticoids, and pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide
  (PACAP), further enhancing TrkB signaling in the synapse'
