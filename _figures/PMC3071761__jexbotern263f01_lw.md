caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway to selected diarylheptanoids in the turmeric
  rhizome. Solid and dashed arrows are for established and proposed conversions, respectively.
  Note that compounds 9 and 10 are not proposed to be intermediates in the biosynthesis
  of curcumin 1 because they belong to a different metabolite module. Compounds derived
  from this pathway, but which would require several additional steps are shown to
  the right. Structures of the diarylheptanoids are drawn in keto-enol tautomer form,
  which is how they would exist in solution (), although they are typically named
  after their β-diketide tautomeric forms.
