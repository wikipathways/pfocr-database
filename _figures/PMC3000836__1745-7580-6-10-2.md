caption: 'SBGN representation of the DC-ATLAS human TLR3 signaling pathway. The different
  modules are represented: The Receptor/Sensing module (R/S, in yellow), the different
  Transduction modules (T1, light grey; T2, pink; T3, light blue) and the Outcome
  modules (O1, O2, O3). The outcomes modules are colored in the same way of the transduction
  module by which they derived. TRIF is the key element shared by each transduction
  module. The outcome module in grey represents the genes which expression is proven
  in human DCs but the transcription factor that regulated their expression is not
  clearly identified.'
