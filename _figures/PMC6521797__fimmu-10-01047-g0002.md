caption: Siglec-7 mediated inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity towards tumor cells.
  Trans or cis binding of Siglec-7 to its cognate ligand results in the Src kinase-mediated
  phosphorylation of the ITIM motif of Siglec-7. Phosphorylated ITIM sites recruit
  phosphatases SHP1/2 which inhibit classical NK cell activating pathways such as
  the NKG2D pathway, stimulated by the binding of NKG2D to stress ligands such as
  MIC A/B expressed by genetically damaged cells, allowing the tumor cell to escape
  and continue migrating throughout the circulatory system, eventually reaching new
  niche sites.
