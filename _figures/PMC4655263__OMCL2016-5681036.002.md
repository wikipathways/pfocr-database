caption: 'Simplified pathways of synaptic transmission and effects of nitrergic posttranslational
  modifications. (a) Left, presynapse; right, postsynapse: showing signalling steps
  involved in transmitter release and neurotransmitter receptor function. Ca2+-dependent
  activation of postsynaptic nNOS leads to nitrergic modifications of molecules (colour-coded)
  which are involved in synaptic transmission in pre- and postsynaptic compartments.
  NO diffuses within the postsynaptic cell but also into the presynapse. Presynaptic
  assembly of the prefusion SNARE complex (such as the vesicular v-SNARE complex protein
  synaptobrevin assemblies with the plasma membrane SNARE proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25)
  and membrane proteins in close proximity to the active zone (AZ) results in a prefusion
  state of the vesicle. In a further step, Munc-18 associates with syntaxin-1 when
  syntaxin-1 is in a closed conformation; as syntaxin-1 opens during SNARE complex
  assembly it enables subsequent vesicle fusion and transmitter release following
  Ca2+ influx. Ca2+ release from intracellular stores via ryanodine receptors (RyR1)
  as well as influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC, in grey) in response
  to incoming action potentials (AP) leads to the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+levels
  and promoting of vesicle fusion. After fusion pore opening, the resulting SNARE
  complexes are disassembled and vesicles are recycled (dynamin-mediated), refilled
  with neurotransmitter, and reused for release. Postsynaptic receptors, excitatory
  NMDAR, and inhibitory GABAR are S-nitrosylated. Furthermore, the scaffolding proteins
  PSD-95, Stargazin, NSF, and Gephyrin are also nitrosylated with various functional
  outcomes. Ultimately, these modifications in addition to the canonical sGC/cGMP
  pathway (in grey) will alter the synaptic response and change AP firing characteristics
  following nitrergic signalling. (b) All colour-coded proteins have been shown to
  be subject to nitrergic posttranslational modifications with their specific residues
  indicated.'
