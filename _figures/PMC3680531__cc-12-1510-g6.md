caption: Figure 6. Schematic representation of the role of Cav-1 in glioblastoma.
  Gliomas are highly heterogeneous tumors that have been demonstrated to contain populations
  of cells with varied levels of Cav-1 expression. In this case, enhanced Cav-1 expression
  among a tumor cell prevents the activation of the TGFBRI/SMAD pathway, which, in
  turn, suppresses expression of integrin subunits at the transcriptional level and
  their subsequent signaling activity. Increased Cav-1 expression is also correlated
  with a decrease in the availability of matrix metallopeptidases, downregulated activity
  of the Erk1/2, PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling pathways as well as the inhibition of
  the trans-membrane drug exporter p-gp. Together, this may implicate that tumors
  with increased Cav-1 levels are less likely to progress through the cell cycle or
  invade into surrounding tissues and are primed to undergo P53 mediated apoptosis,
  making these cells more easily targeted by standard chemotherapy regimens.
