caption: Cytosolic DNA and cGas-STING pathway activation lead to a strong immune response
  triggered by an antigen- and INF-mediated activation of adaptive immune compartments.
  The contribution of neoantigens to tumor regression of MSI tumors upon CPIs is a
  matter of fact. However, recent findings demonstrated that cytosolic DNA accumulation
  occurs in MSI cancer cells []. As consequence of this biochemical process, the cGAS-STING
  pathway is activated, resulting in the induction of type I INF mediated response
  and leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that sustain and foster
  anti-tumor response through multiple mechanisms. These findings lead to emergent
  strategies to trigger an immune response and to enroll patients with a positive
  predictive response to CPIs (PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4). Created with BioRender.com.
