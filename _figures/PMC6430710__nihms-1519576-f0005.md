caption: In the setting of a DNA ds break, HR preferentially restores DNA integrity
  in an error-free fashion (left column). In the setting of HR-deficiency, however,
  the error-prone NHEJ pathway and the less error-prone alternative NHEJ (alt-NHEJ)
  pathways (middle and right columns, respectively) play a larger role in DNA ds break
  repair. PARP inhibitors inhibit alt-NHEJ and simultaneously facilitate NHEJ, leading
  to increased chromosomal rearrangements, genetic instability, and cell death. In
  the setting of 53BP1 downregulation, an inhibitory influence on HR is removed []
  and HR is restored. In the setting of NHEJ protein down-regulation, other DNA repair
  pathways with higher fidelity repair also appear to be utilized [, ], although the
  mechanistic details are incompletely understood.
