caption: Underlying mechanism by which SNX17 increases cell surface LRP4 expression
  to promote AChR aggregation and neuromuscular excitatory transmission restoration.
  SNX17 recognizes and binds LRP4 that is internalized into early endosomes and mediates
  the transformation of LRP4 to circulating endosomes and then back to the muscle
  cell membrane. LRP4 returning to the membrane induces AChR aggregation through the
  Agrin–LRP4–MuSK signaling pathway, which binds ACh released from the presynaptic
  membrane and further restores the neuromuscular excitation transmission. AChR, acetylcholine
  receptor; LRP4, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4; MuSK, muscle-specific
  receptor tyrosine kinase; NMJ, neuromuscular junction; SNX17, sorting nexin 17.
