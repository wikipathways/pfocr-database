caption: Effector T cells generated during normal immune responses, terminally differentiated
  T effector memory CD45RA cells (TEMRA cells), which are mostly responsive to latent
  viruses, and senescent T cells are all characterized by their excessive production
  of pro-inflammatory mediators. However, the signalling and transcriptional control
  mechanisms in the different cell states differ. For effector T cells, ligation of
  T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 induces a signalling cascade that activates the mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway as well as several transcriptional
  activators. For TEMRA cells, sestrins provide a scaffold for broad mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) activation, in particular activation of p38 MAPK by the AMPK–TAB1
  complex, whilemTORC1 is inhibited. For senescent T cells, DNA damage and cellular
  stress activate signalling pathways, with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), p38, C/EBPβ
  and mTORC1 playing critical roles in regulating the senescence associated secretory
  phenotype (SASP).
