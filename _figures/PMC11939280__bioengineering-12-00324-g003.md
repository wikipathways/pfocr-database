caption: Schematic representation of the original Griffith transformation experiment
  (design 1.1) in 1928 (A; see Ref. [21]) and its canonical interpretation (B). (A)
  Donor pneumococci of serotype S (I), corresponding to 50 cc of broth culture, which
  had been attenuated by incubation with anti-S antiserum (in the presence of chocolate
  broth) or killed by heat (60 °C, 2–3 h), were injected in parallel with a limited
  amount of viable R (II) acceptor pneumococci. From the few mice that had been killed
  after the injection, S (I) pneumococci were isolated and grown in culture to fully
  virulent S (I). (B) Donor pneumococci of the (S) serotype (a) release fragments
  of their genome (brown circles) into the incubation/culture medium due to (partial)
  lysis and loss of cellular integrity in the course of their attenuation by heat
  (b) and subsequent exposure to the acceptor pneumococci. (c) Subsequent researchers
  [22] subjected the partially lysed donor pneumococci to centrifugation, heat exposure,
  chloroform extraction and/or protease treatment, etc. (design 1.2–1.X). The released
  and (eventually partially) purified DNA fragments or plasmids/episomes, possibly
  intrinsically contained in the donor pneumococci, were then taken up by acceptor
  pneumococci of the rough serotype (pink DNA circles) (d) by molecular mechanisms
  (e), which were characterized in detail. Following recombination of relevant DNA
  fragments into the genome of the acceptor pneumococci (brown and pink DNA circles)
  and their replication (f), the genes putatively encoded by the DNA fragments become
  expressed (g), including those engaged in the synthesis pathway of the specific
  LPS of the smooth serotype (pink circles). Consequently, capsule materials of the
  smooth serotype are formed ((h); for a review, see Refs. [23,24,25]). This sequence
  of events ultimately leads to the conversion of rough to smooth pneumococci and
  explains the inheritance of a “minor” difference, such as non-virulence vs. virulence,
  in bacteria
