caption: Schematic of porphyrin-synthetic pathway to illustrate potential control
  points for increased PpIX accumulation. Enzymes, with names abbreviated and relative
  locations in the pathway shown in boxes, are numbered beginning with the initial
  condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA. Substrates/products are shown in bold
  font. The intracellular location of enzymes, relative to the mitochondria and the
  cytoplasm, is indicated. See  for a fully detailed version.
