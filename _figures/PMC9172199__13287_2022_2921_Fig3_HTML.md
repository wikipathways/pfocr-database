caption: EVs function as cell communication. Target cells absorb EVs by endocytosis
  and fusion, while receptors on the membrane can facilitate EVs uptake and regulate
  cell signal pathway. EVs are characterized by specific markers, such as membrane
  proteins (CD9, CD63, CD81), major histocompatibility complex (MHC), Alix, TSG101,
  and HSP70. (Created with BioRender.com)
