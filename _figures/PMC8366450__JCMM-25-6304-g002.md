caption: CPPED1 involvement with PI3K‐AKT pathway. Schematic view of activated (A)
  and inactivated (B) PI3K‐AKT pathway. PI3K‐AKT is a conserved pathway that is involved
  in many types of cellular processes. When growth factor (GF) binds to receptor tyrosine
  kinase (RTK), RTK tyrosine residues are phosphorylated. Regulatory subunit p85 binds
  to phosphorylated tyrosine and brings catalytic subunit p110 adjacent to substrate
  PIP2. Once PIP3 is formed from PIP2 by PI3K, pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of
  PDK1, PDK2 and AKT1 bind to PIP3, which results in phosphorylation and activation
  of AKT1. PDK1 phosphorylates Thr‐308. Ser‐473 is phosphorylated by various proteins
  such as PDK2, integrin‐linked kinase (ILK), mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
  (mTORC2) and DNA‐dependent protein kinase (DNA‐PK).,  PAK4 has been shown to bind
  to p85α (also known as PIK3R1) and is required for maximal phosphorylation of AKT1.
  By contrast, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), PH domain
  leucine‐rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) and CPPED1 are known to dephosphorylate
  Ser‐473 and inactivate AKT1. Among other functions, activated AKT1 phosphorylates
  transcription factor FOXO1, which results in nuclear exclusion of phosphorylated
  FOXO1. This might also prevent formation of the FOXO‐progesterone receptor (PR)
  transcription factor complex., ,  By contrast, PI3K‐AKT pathway inhibition allows
  for formation of the FOXO‐PR complex. We found that CPPED1 bound p85β (also known
  as PIK3R2) and PAK4, which could have an effect on the PI3K‐AKT Pathway. We also
  found that CPPED1 mediated the effect of progesterone on the expression of a set
  of genes.
