caption: Metabolic model used for 13C-MFA. Free net fluxes are indicated in gray.
  For the control, elevated-temperature treatment, chex2, ana1, and chex3 were free.
  For the mannitol treatment, where NADP malic enzyme was omitted, chex2 and tca1
  were free. Free exchange fluxes for all models are indicated with circles. All other
  exchange fluxes were constrained to zero during parameter fitting. The arrows indicate
  the direction of positive flux as defined in the model. Flux names are given in
  italics. cit, Citrate; fum, fumarate; GABA, γ-aminobutyrate; αKG, α-ketoglutarate;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway. Standard abbreviations of amino
  acid names are used. Dashed boxes indicate where the subcellular localization of
  a metabolite or reaction cannot be inferred from the data or from the literature.
  The letters “p”, “c,” and “m” preceding metabolite names indicate separate pools
  of that metabolite in the plastid, cytosol, and mitochondrion, respectively. Output
  of CO2 from the system is included in the model but not illustrated here. [See online
  article for color version of this figure.]
