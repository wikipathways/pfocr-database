caption: Evaluations on Substrates of FBXL Family E3s(A and B) Known (red edge) and
  predicted (gray edge) ESIs for FBXLs. The meaning of node colors and shapes is the
  same as in . For clarity, only the high-confidence substrates (with a predicted
  probability higher than 0.65 and ranked within top-20 for corresponding FBXL) were
  shown. (A) A large part of the predicted ESIs are mapped onto cell cycle pathway
  by pathway-based associations. (B) In addition to substrates on the cell cycle pathway,
  the FBXLs were also predicted to target on other substrates across different pathways.(C)
  Boxplot of the predicted results on candidate ESIs. The putative ESIs identified
  by PAC (orange box) were observed with significant higher probabilities than the
  remaining ones (green box). *p < 0.01 (Wilcoxon test, two sided, unpaired).See also  and
