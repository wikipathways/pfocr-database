caption: Regulation of phosphatase, kinase and calcium channel signaling pathways
  by NOX. The NOX-mediated production of superoxide and resulting secondary ROS leads
  to the oxidation of cysteines on PTPs [] and calcium channels, resulting in the
  formation of disulfide bridges. PTP activity opposes that of kinases, thus regulating
  a large number of proteins involved in a variety of signaling pathways; PTP activity
  also regulates Ca2+ ion flux. Secondary ROS can also activate MAP-Ks, possibly via
  the ERK1/2 signaling pathway through activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF)
  receptors, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, which can stimulate
  Ras and the subsequent activation of the ERK pathway [].
