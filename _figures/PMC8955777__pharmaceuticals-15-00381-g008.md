caption: Mechanism of action of combined treatment afatinib–metformin. In the EGFR
  mutant LC cell lines (H1975 and HCC827), afatinib exerts its basal inhibitory effects
  over the EGFR pathway, decreasing both processes, glycolysis, and EMT transition.
  Furthermore, this inhibition can be exacerbated with the complementary effect of
  metformin through AMPK stimulation and subsequent P70S6K inhibition coupled with
  a decrease in protein synthesis. On the other hand, the A549 cell line (EGFR wild-type)
  showed stimulation of the EGFR pathway associated with afatinib treatment as a single
  drug, however, with complementary metformin treatment, the combination can counteract
  the pathway activation caused by afatinib, decreasing protein synthesis, glycolytic
  phenotype, and EMT; also, our results suggest a sensitization of this cell line
  to afatinib treatment when metformin is added, acting synergistically in cytotoxic
  induction.
