caption: Paradoxical roles of autophagy induced by the tumor microenvironment during
  different stages of tumor development. (a) Autophagy is induced by multiple stressors
  in the tumor microenvironment, including hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, inflammation,
  and ECM detachment. Hypoxia activates autophagy through AMPK, PERK and HIF-1a/FOXO3
  signaling pathways. The AMPK pathway is also activated by nutrient deprivation.
  Autophagy can be also induced by ECM detachment through the Akt-mTORC1 and IKK pathways.
  Inflammation is another inducer of autophagy that acts through the NF-κB signal
  pathway. (b) Before tumorigenesis, autophagy can suppress tumor initiation by protecting
  normal cells and inhibiting inflammation (including inhibiting inflammasome and
  necrosis). In contrast, autophagy promotes tumor growth in established tumors. Autophagy
  can promote inflammation by favouring inflammatory cells growth. Autophagy can also
  protect tumor cells and provide sufficient oxygen and nutrient.
