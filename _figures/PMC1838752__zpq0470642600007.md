caption: Proposed model showing the mechanisms underlying α1- and α2-adrenergic regulation
  of NMDAR function in PFC pyramidal neurons. α1-AR (Gq-coupled) reduces NMDAR currents
  via the PLC-IP3pathway, whereas α2-AR (Gi/o-coupled) decreases NMDAR currents by
  interfering with the microtubule (MT)/motor protein-based transport of NMDARs that
  is regulated by the PKA–ERK cascade. RGS2 is specifically involved in dampening
  the α1-AR signaling, whereas RGS4 is involved in both α1-AR and α2-AR signaling.
  The scaffold protein spinophilin selectively facilitates the RGS2/4 modulation of
  the α1-AR effect on NMDAR currents.
