caption: The lifecycle of DENV and major strategies for anti-DENV peptide drug development.
  The lifecycle of DENV involves complex interactions between viral proteins and host
  factors. Interaction begins from the E protein contacting the target host cell through
  receptor-mediated and clathrin-dependent endocytosis [-]. After internalization,
  viral genomic RNA is released from the endosome because the conformational change
  in the E protein, which is necessary for membrane fusion to occur, is triggered
  by pH alteration [-]. A single polyprotein is subsequently translated from the genomic
  RNA and autocatalytically cleaved into structural and nonstructural proteins through
  the recruitment of viral NS2B/NS3 and host proteases [, ]. All processed viral protein
  subunits are translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Nonstructural
  proteins are transported to ER-derived vesicular parcels to form a replication complex,
  while the structural proteins prM and E are embedded into the ER membrane to enclose
  the nucleocapsid derived from the association of newly synthesized viral RNA with
  C proteins [, , ]. Subsequently, an immature viral particle is generated from the
  assembly of C, prM, E, and genomic RNA, and then buds into the ER-lumen to enable
  transport through the secretory pathway. Ultimately, the mature DENV virion is released
  into the cytoplasm under a low pH through furin-mediated cleavage of prM to M in
  the trans-Golgi network and can infect the next host cell [, , -]. According to
  the DENV lifecycle, the three major strategies for developing anti-DENV peptide
  drugs are immunomodulation, anti-DENV entry, and anti-DENV replication [-].
