caption: TLR signaling and domain organization of TLR8. (a) Overview of TLR ligand
  and signaling pathways. All TLRs except for TLR3 transduce signals through the MyD88-dependent
  pathway, and TLR3 and TLR4 transduce signals through a TRIF-dependent pathway, activating
  transcription factors such as NF-κB, AP-1, IRF3 or IRF7. Finally, TLR signaling
  induces inflammatory cytokines or interferons. (b) Schematic representation of TLR8.
  The ectodomain of TLR8 consists of 26 LRRs and the N-terminal and the C-terminal
  regions. A characteristic loop, the Z-loop, is inserted between LRR14 and LRR15.
  A single transmembrane helix and the TIR domain are located on the C-terminus.
