caption: The possible mechanism of how exosomal miR-107 reversed chemotherapeutic
  drug resistance of SGC-7901/5-FU cells. Exosomal miR-107 was transmitted from sensitive
  GC cells to recipient resistant GC cells, and drug sensitivity of SGC-7901/5-FU
  cells was improved through inhibiting HMGA2/mTOR/P-gp signal
