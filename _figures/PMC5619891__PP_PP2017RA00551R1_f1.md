caption: Reconstruction of metabolism in peppermint s. A, Leaf surfaces contain abundant
  s. Eight secretory cells (gray shading), arranged in a disc, are responsible for
  the biosynthesis of monoterpenoid essential oils, which are then secreted into a
  preformed cavity. The major pathways operating in peppermint s, based on transcriptomic
  and metabolomic data, are depicted. PPP, Pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle. B, Monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and polymethoxylated flavones are the
  most significant biomass outputs of s at secretory stage, and the values in this
  table were the basis for flux balance analysis, using the menpiGT_2015 metabolic
  reconstruction, to determine the distribution of carbon flow through the network
  of reactions.
