caption: 'Schematic depiction of the significantly changed key metabolic pathways
  following AFB1 exposure and their connections. All altered pathways included the
  purine and pyrimidine metabolic pathways, fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation,
  TCA cycle, glycolysis, hexosamine pathway, and biosynthesis of sialylation. Significantly
  downregulated metabolites are shown in green rectangular box, significantly upregulated
  metabolites are shown in orange rectangular box. Abbreviations (other than standard
  nucleotide or amino acid abbreviations): P: phosphate; PRPP: phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate;
  PC: phosphatidylcholine; PE: phosphatidyl ethanolamine; CoA: coenzyme A: aKG, a-ketoglutarate;
  OAA: oxaloacetic acid; GlcN6P: glucosamine 6-phosphate; UDP-GlcNAc: UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine;
  ManNAc-6P: N-acyl-D-mannosamine 6-phosphate; Neu5Ac-9P: N-acylneuraminate 9-phosphate.'
