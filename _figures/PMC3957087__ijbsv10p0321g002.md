caption: STAMP2 links inflammation and metabolism. STAMP2 integrates nutrient, hormone
  and inflammatory signals with metabolic pathways. FFA/feeding stimuli and inflammatory
  signals (cytokines)/adipokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, leptin) modulate the expression
  of the transmembrane protein STAMP2. IL-6 and leptin (repressors) and TNF-α and
  IL-1β (inducers) regulate STAMP2 metabolic activity, similar to the insulin signaling
  pathway. STAMP2 up-regulates insulin sensitivity by increasing tyrosine phosphorylation
  of both the insulin receptor (IR) and Akt kinase, translocation of the glucose transporter
  GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, and glucose uptake. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx)
  causes metabolic disorders including insulin resistance and abnormal lipid accumulation
  in the liver. STAMP2 antagonizes HBx-mediated hepatocyte dysfunction by decreasing
  HBx protein stability.
