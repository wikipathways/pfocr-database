caption: Summary of the signaling pathways of PKMζ-mediated late-LTP. Transcription
  from an internal promoter within the PRKCZ gene expresses a PKMζ mRNA that encodes
  a PKCζ catalytic domain (green) without a regulatory domain (red). The PKMζ mRNA,
  which is transported to dendrites of neurons, is translationally repressed. During
  strong afferent synaptic stimulation, glutamate (Glu) stimulates both postsynaptic
  AMPAR and NMDARs. The increase in postsynaptic Ca2+ through the activated NMDAR
  stimulates multiple effector molecules that upregulate PKMζ synthesis and downregulate
  PKMζ degradation. The newly translated PKMζ is rapidly phosphorylated by PDK1 to
  achieve a fully active state. PKMζ enhances its own translation by phosphorylating
  PIN1. The persistent activity of PKMζ then maintains both increases in postsynaptic
  GluA2-containing AMPARs by decreasing receptor endocytosis through an NSF-dependent
  pathway, and increases in PSD-95 aggregation. Adapted from [].
