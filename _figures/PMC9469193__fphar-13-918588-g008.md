caption: 'Schematic presentation indicating the suggested mechanisms by which TP/TNF-α–induced
  gastric cancer cell death. Under a physiological state, a low dose of TNF-α stimulates
  both cell survival signals via H19/miR-204-5p/NF-Κb/FLIP pathway and cell death
  signals via activating caspase-8. The upregulation of FLIP inhibits caspase-8-dependent
  apoptosis, and the consequence of a low dose of TNF-α is cell survival. However,
  TP pretreatment inhibited H19/miR-204-5p/NF-κB/FLIP signals, and the insignificant
  level of FLIP could not counteract the prodeath signals induced by TNF-α, leading
  to gastric cancer cell death. The figure was created using BioRender.com (Agreement
  number: IQ23Z4T0E3).'
