caption: 'Cellular signaling pathways that control normal hematopoiesis and apoptosis.
  Molecules participating in these pathways could be used as therapy targets in leukemias.
  Jak/Stat pathway is very important in leukemias, since disorders of its function
  lead to malignancies, for example, chromosomal translocation TEL-Jak2. It participates
  in apoptosis regulation with various ways, for instance some Stats (2 and 3) are
  the mediators of the antiapoptotic effects of cytokines, like IL-6 and IL-2. RTKs
  are membrane-bound enzymes that phosphorylate and activate several signaling proteins.
  Example of this receptor is the FLT3R and mutations of the FLT3 gene have been reported
  in some cases of AML. Other molecules like ERKs and Akt are involved in apoptosis
  through suppressing bad mediated apoptosis. Jak: Janus kinase. STAT: signal transducer
  and activator of transcription. MEKs: MAPK kinases. MAPK: mitogen-activated protein
  kinase. ERKs: extracellular signal-regulated kinases. RTK: receptor tyrosine kinase.
  PKC: protein kinase C. FLT3R: FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor. Akt: protein
  kinase B (PKB). PIK3: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. IkB: inhibitor of nuclear factor
  kB. NF-κB: nuclear factor kB.'
