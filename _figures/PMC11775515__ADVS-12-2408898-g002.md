caption: The preparation and in vivo mechanism of C‐NPs/BT. Briefly, C‐NPs/BT relieve
  hepatocytes damage and inhibit HSC activation by eliminating oxidative stress and
  silencing TGF‐β signaling pathway synergistically, thereby interrupting the malignant
  cellular interactions. C‐NPs/BT would significantly remodel the pathological microenvironment
  and promote the resolution of liver fibrosis
