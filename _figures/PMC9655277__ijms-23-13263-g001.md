caption: 'Normal glomerular filtration barrier and its alteration in diabetic kidney
  disease. A schematic of the normal glomerular filtration barrier, comprising the
  endothelial surface layer (ESL), glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and podocyte
  foot processes with slit diaphragm. The glomerular endothelium and fenestrae are
  covered by the glycocalyx, a meshwork of membrane-bound glycoproteins and proteoglycans.
  A diabetic kidney is characterized by a fenestrated area of endothelial cells with
  a reduced amount of glycocalyx, increased levels of reactive oxygen species and
  inflammatory cytokines, and altered interaction between glomerular endothelial cells
  and neighboring glomerular cells. Glomerular endothelial cells (GEC) generate reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide (O2−) or hydroxyl (•OH) and hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2), via several endogenous pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation in
  mitochondria, NADPH oxidases, xanthine oxidase (XO), and uncoupled endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase (NOS). These ROS lead to GEC apoptosis, resulting from nuclear DNA
  dysfunction. High levels of extracellular glucose increase its uptake through the
  overexpression of glucose transporter 1, and stimulate transforming growth factor
  (TGF)-β1 signaling pathways in mesangial cells to induce the production of extracellular
  matrix proteins. The formation of oxidative radicals may inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  or stimulate Ras/Rac1 signaling, which induces the apoptosis of mesangial cells.
  The Akt/mTOR-mediated autophagy signaling pathway leads to mesangial cell proliferation
  and fibrosis. Angiopoietin-2–TGF-β1 signaling enhances the aggravation of podocyte
  hypertrophy under hyperglycemic conditions. The activation of Notch-1 signaling
  in podocytes causes vascular endothelial growth factor overexpression, nephrin underexpression,
  and apoptosis augmentation. The overexpression of the receptor activator of NF-κB
  in podocytes under hyperglycemic conditions increases glomerular oxidative stress
  and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (↑: up-regulation, ↓: down-regulation).'
