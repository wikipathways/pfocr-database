caption: Localization of key lipids and enzymes, designated by the genes encoding
  them, in different cellular compartments in S. cerevisiae. PA serves as precursor
  to both phospholipids and neutral lipids. PA is found in the ER (purple box), in
  lipid droplets (orange box), and in mitochondria (green box). In the ER, PA serves
  as immediate precursor of CDP-DAG, precursor to PI and PS. PS is converted into
  PE by decarboxylation in the mitochondria or in the endosome compartment (accented
  yellow box). PC is synthesized by methylation of PE or from DAG and CDP-choline.
  DAG is derived from dephosphorylation of PA or deacylation of TAG. Acyl-CoA is localized
  in the cytosol (light yellow box) and serves as fatty acid pool for the synthesis
  of PA, TAG, and SE. PA is also transported from the ER to the mitochondria, where
  it generates CDP-DAG and CL. The positions of PA within the metabolic network are
  boxed, the positions of DAG are circled, and the positions at which inositol and
  choline enter in the metabolic pathway are boxed. The arrows represent routes of
  metabolic conversion. The names of the structural genes encoding enzymes catalyzing
  specific metabolic conversions are shown adjacent to the arrows.
papertitle: Interaction between repressor Opi1p and ER membrane protein Scs2p facilitates
  transit of phosphatidic acid from the ER to mitochondria and is essential for INO1
  gene expression in the presence of choline.
