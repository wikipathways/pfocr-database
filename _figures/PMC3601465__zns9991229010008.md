caption: A model for Rac1, NF2/merlin, and cAMP regulate SC myelination. Rac1 regulates
  NF2/merlin phosphorylation through PAK in SC. Rac1 knock-out decreases phosphorylation
  of PAK and phosphorylation of NF2/merlin. Nonphosphorylated form of NF2/merlin negatively
  regulates cAMP-mediated myelination in the absence of Rac1. NF2/merlin mutation
  restores cAMP levels in Rac1-CKO SCs and allows myelin formation. Reduced cAMP level
  is a cause for the myelination defect in Rac1-CKO mice. Elevation of cAMP by rolipram
  rescued myelin formation in Rac1-CKO mice in vivo. Elevation of cAMP by forskolin
  also increases NF2/merlin phosphorylation. These findings support a novel pathway
  through which Rac1 regulates SC myelination through NF2/merlin and cAMP signaling.
