caption: 'We identified in our study the primary metabolic pathways exhibiting alterations
  in autism, specifically noting changes in mitochondrial function, fatty acid metabolism,
  amino acid metabolism, creatine metabolism, and sphingolipid metabolism. Carnitine
  plays a pivotal role in facilitating the translocation of fatty acids into the mitochondrial
  matrix via the CPT1 system, where these substrates undergo β-oxidation for energy
  production. Perturbations in this process can lead to impaired mitochondrial function
  and compromised energy homeostasis. Creatine synthesis is catalyzed by the sequential
  actions of AGAT and GAMT. Disturbance of amino acid metabolism and related physiological
  processes in ASD patients may lead to deviations in creatine levels in the body.
  SM is an integral component of the S1P signaling pathway, which plays a pivotal
  role in regulating inflammation, GPCR signaling, and endothelial barrier integrity.
  Dysregulated SM levels can lead to inflammatory diseases, abnormal GPCR signaling
  cascades, and neuroinflammation. Abbreviations: SM: Sphingomyelin; CPT1: carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase; GAMT: guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase; AGAT: arginine:glycine
  amidinotransferase; S1P: sphingosine-1-phosphate; GPCR: G protein-coupled receptor;
  CNS: central nervous system'
