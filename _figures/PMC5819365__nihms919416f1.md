caption: FA signaling is composed of all signaling transductions involving one or
  more FA proteins. Within the FA signaling, the FA proteins (FANCA, B, C, E, F, G,
  L, M, T and possibly I) along with FAAPs (FAAP 20/24/100 and MHF1/2) and others,
  assure the activity of ubiquitin E3 ligase for the monoubiquitination of FANCD2
  and FANCI. Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 and FANCI, in turn, orchestrate the downstream
  players, including the rest of FA proteins and other non-FA proteins to repair DNA
  damage via mechanisms of BER, NER, TLS, HR and NHEJ to maintain genome stability.
  In addition, USP1 can deubiquitinate FANCD2/I, thereby inactivating the FA-BRCA
  pathway. Most importantly, ATM, ATR and HHR6, together with others known (FANCM
  and FAAPs) or yet to identify, can act as the upstream regulators for the well-executed
  checkpoint responses upon DNA damage or replicative stresses. Red arrowheads indicate
  the canonical FA pathway. FANCM-centered sensing (upstream), possibly including
  FANCW modulation of RPA functions, would be a typical example in FA signaling to
  show pathway-independent roles.
