caption: 'Mechanism of cerebral endothelial dysfunction imparted by heavy metal intoxication.
  Heavy metal can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS)by either direct (Fenton reaction)
  or indirect pathway (activating NADPH oxidase). Reactive oxygen species bind with
  the NO and rapidly convert into the peroxynitrite resulting in decreases in the
  bioavailability of NO in endothelial cells. Reduced NO level activates the Rho-kinase.
  Elevated ROS activity causes the lipid peroxidation of endothelial cells and thus
  produces the MDA, which is further toxic to the cell. On the other hand, ROS converts
  in H2O2 catalyzed by SOD. Finally, the reunion of all these events leads to oxidative
  insults to the endothelial cell and eventually causes endothelial dysfunction. Abbreviations:
  ROS: Reactive oxygen species, NADPH oxidase: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  oxidase, SOD: Superoxide dismutase, H2O2: Hydrogen peroxide, MDA: Malondialdehyde,
  NO: Nitric oxide, ONOO: Peroxynitrite, Rho-k: Rho-associated protein kinase.'
