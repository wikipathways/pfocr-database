caption: Fig. 6. Model for potential checkpoint function of HuCdc6. Ongoing DNA replication
  is monitored either by proteins at the replication fork, including ATR, or by soluble
  factors, including HuCdc6. ATR and HuCdc6 might work in parallel pathways, both
  leading to the activation of Chk1 and consequent inactivation of Cdc25. The major
  role of the ATR pathway would be in response to stalled replication forks. Chk1
  may also increase the activity of Wee1 that further prevents the activation of MPF.
