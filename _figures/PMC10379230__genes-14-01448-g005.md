caption: The DEGs with reversed mRNA levels in rat brains at 24 h after tMCAO under
  long-term and short-term anesthesia and gene-associated pathway annotations. Cytoscape
  3.8.2 software was used for network construction. Involvement of the protein product
  of the gene in signaling pathway functioning is indicated by a line connecting the
  nodes. The KP, RP, and WP databases were used to annotate all clustered signaling
  pathways. Only DEGs and annotations with Padj < 0.05 were considered to be significant.
