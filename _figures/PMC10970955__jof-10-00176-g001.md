caption: 'Systematic engineering for the de novo biosynthesis of genistein and glycosylated
  derivatives. The black lines indicate the biosynthetic pathways of the two isoflavone
  glycosides. The outermost six modules demonstrate the strategies in this paper.

  multicopy site integration of the naringenin pathway, heme supply, intracellular
  NADPH production, multicopy site integration of the genistein pathway, and UDPG
  supply (clockwise). Notes on abbreviations: E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
