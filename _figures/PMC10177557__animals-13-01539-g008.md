caption: Mapping of key differential metabolites between H and L groups in the relevant
  KEGG pathways. The “Arachidonic acid metabolism pathway” is shown in khaki, the
  “α-Linolenic acid metabolism pathway” is in purple, the “Arginine and proline metabolism
  pathway” is in green, the “Arginine biosynthesis pathway” is in pink, the “Purine
  metabolism pathway” is in yellow, the “Taurine and hypotaurine metabolism pathway”
  is in gray, and the “TCA cycle pathway” is in blue. The up- and down-regulated metabolites
  are presented by red and blue arrows, respectively. And their font colors are also
  presented by red and blue, respectively. Dashed arrows indicate the connectivity
  to another pathway. The color of each square next to the bacteria represents the
  intensity of the bacteria abundance, the red indicates the highest abundance, and
  the yellow indicates the lowest abundance
