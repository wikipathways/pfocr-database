caption: 'Cyclin D1, at the center of MCL pathogenesis. Cyclin D1 mRNA stability and
  translation is increased by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Cyclin D1 translocates into
  the nucleus and forms a holoenzyme with CDK4/6 to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma
  protein (RB), resulting in the release of E2F transcription factors and G1/S phase
  transition. In addition, cyclin D1/CDK4 complexes have kinase-independent functions,
  notably binding of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27kip, which is thereby titrated away
  from cyclinE/CDK2 complexes further promoting cell-cycle progression. Cyclin D1/CDK4
  inhibits degradation of CDT1, the rate-limiting factor in DNA replication. Stabilization
  of CDT1 in S phase can induce the replication of already transcribed chromosomal
  segments, giving rise to increased numbers of double strand breaks and activation
  of DNA damage checkpoints. In S phase cyclin D1 is phosphorylated on threonine 286
  by GSK3β, exported from the nucleus by CRM-1, polyubiquitinated by the E3 ligase
  SCF(FBX4-αB Crystallin), and degraded through the proteasome (reviewed in Kim and
  Diehl ). GSK3β is phosphorylated and inactivated by AKT and WNT signaling. Several
  components of this cell-cycle control machinery are altered in MCL: blue symbols
  (Δ) indicate molecules inactivated or down-regulated; red symbols, molecules activated
  or overexpressed. Illustration by Paulette Dennis.'
