caption: Schematic diagram of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in the regulation of
  the NLRP3 inflammasome and macrophage pyroptosis. LPS activates p38 MAPK signaling
  pathway in macrophages through the TLR2/NF-κB signaling pathway, subsequently upregulating
  protein expression and promoting the formation of the NLRP3/caspase-1/ASC protein
  complex (NLRP3 inflammasome). The activated NLRP3 inflammasome cleaves pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18 to become active IL-1β and IL-18, which ultimately induces macrophage
  pyroptosis. The signaling pathway is suppressed by p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580.
  In addition, SB203580 upregulates caspase-3 and enhances macrophage apoptosis. ASC,
  apoptosis-associated speck-like protein; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  MAPK, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κ-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; NLRP leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing;
  TLR, Toll-like receptor.
