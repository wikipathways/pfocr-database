caption: Effectors interfering with SA-dependent signaling and gene regulation. In
  this signaling scheme, we restrict the presentation to plant components targeted
  by virulence effectors. NPR1 is a central regulator in SA-dependent signaling pathway,
  triggering the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in the nucleus (gray)
  together with the TGA2 transcription factor. SA induces monomerization of cytosolic
  NPR1 oligomers with the help of thioredoxin TRX-h5. The mycotoxin effector victorin
  of C. victoriae can inhibit NPR1 through binding to TRX-h5 without causing disease.
  However, in LOV1 expressing plants victorin activates LOV1 with the consequence
  of cell death which is prerequisite for disease by this necrotrophic pathogen. P.
  syringae effector SylA and X. campestris effector XopJ act as proteasome inhibitors
  to suppress turnover of NPR1 and interrupt SA dependent defenses. HaRxL44 interacts
  with MED19a, leading to proteasomal degradation of MED19a. Oomycete RxLR effectors
  HaRxL96, PsAvh163, and HaRxL62, as well as a bacterial effector PopS, inhibit the
  expression of SA marker gene PR-1 most likely indirectly. In the lower part a pathogen
  hypha is indicated in light pink. This hypha is surrounded by the apoplast shown
  enlarged here (light gray) encased by the plant plasma membrane (green). Effectors
  AVR2, EPIC1, EPIC2B, and Pit2 are secreted to the apoplastic space where they inhibit
  plant proteases PIP1, RCR3, CP1A, CP2, and XCP2 all induced by SA. Fungal and oomycete
  effectors are indicated by pink ovals and bacterial effectors are indicated in dark
  yellow. Plant components are indicated by green squares. Solid arrows represent
  direct activation, dotted arrows indicate indirect activation and blunt ended arrows
  indicate inhibition (for details, see text).
