caption: Wnt signaling pathway and targeted therapy in PH. In hypoxia-PH, hyperoxia
  and IPAH, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is activated, binding to the transcription factor
  TCF4 and leading to pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects. Activated Wnt/β-catenin
  also promotes EndMT and ECM remodeling. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  in PAF ultimately promotes ECM remodeling. Additionally, in PAH, Wnt/PCP signaling
  is inhibited in PAECs and pericytes, suppressing EndMT. Naked cuticle homolog 1
  and ponatinib mitigate PH by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway. PASMC pulmonary artery
