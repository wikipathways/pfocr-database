caption: (A) TNF signaling network noise normalized to the noise that is contributed
  by the common TNF–TNFR segment, based upon the data in . The map demonstrates asymmetry
  in the amount of noise contributed by the NF-κB and JNK pathways and shows that
  the majority of noise in the JNK pathway is contributed downstream of the TNF receptor
  complex. (B) Illustration of a noise decomposition of a larger network. Given a
  hypothetical signaling network of six nodes and two readouts (C and E), only three
  noise values can be ascertained. With the addition of two new readouts (F and G),
  a more comprehensive noise decomposition map can be constructed that can guide further
  investigations.
