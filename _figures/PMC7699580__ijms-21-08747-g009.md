caption: 'Proposed mechanism of sterol-coupled ATP catalysis by ABCG5/G8. (Mode 1)
  A sequential pathway is derived from experiments on the disease mutants, G5-E146Q
  and G8-R543S. ABCG5/G8 first recruits ATP and Mg2+ ions, likely causing a conformational
  change of the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) for ATP binding. CHS/sterol then binds
  the transporter and triggers ATP hydrolysis that may result in its dissociation.
  (Mode 2) A concerted pathway is derived from experiments on the putative sterol-binding
  mutant, G5-A540F. ABCG5/G8 simultaneously recruits CHS, ATP, and Mg2+ ions, induces
  a transient conformational change of the NBD, and activates ATP hydrolysis and CHS/sterol
  dissociation from the transporter. G5: ABCG5; G8: ABCG8; E: ABCG5/G8 heterodimer;
  Pi: inorganic phosphate.'
