caption: Major elements of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Genes that encode
  membrane proteins are in squares, ligands in hexagons, and scaffolding proteins
  in rhomboids. All other genes are represented by circles. Lines ending in flat heads
  represent inhibition. Lines ending in arrowheads represent excitation. Arrowheads
  alone represent proteins that act together, such as coenzymes. Large boxes surround
  genes that act at the same step in the pathway. The expression of each gene in the
  ROP rats' retinae, relative to the RAR rats' retinae, is color-coded to the bar
  in the lower left. Bold borders around a gene indicate that it was significantly
  regulated (±0.77 log2).
