caption: 'The modulation of JAK-STAT signaling by palmitoylationIn the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway, JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5α can be palmitoylated. ZDHCC3 and ZDHHC7
  can palmitoylate JAK1 at Cys541/542 to facilitate its activation. IFNAR1 palmitoylation
  at Cys463 benefits STAT1 and STAT2 activation. PA mediated by CD36 control STAT3
  palmitoylation. ZDHHC3 and ZDHHC7 promote STAT3 palmitoylation at Cys108. ZDHHC5
  increases STAT3 palmitoylation at Cys687 and Cys712. Gp130 palmitoylation mediated
  by ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8, and GSK3β palmitoylation at Cys14 mediated by ZDHHC4 contribute
  to STAT3 activation. In addition, GFAP can be palmitoylated by ZDHHC5, ZDHHC12,
  ZDHHC21, and ZDHHC23. GFAP palmitoylation at Cys291 mediated by ZDHHC23 facilitates
  CXCL-10, IL-6, and GM-CSF secretion to activate STAT3. APT2 depalmitoylates STAT3.
