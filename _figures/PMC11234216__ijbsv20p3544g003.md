caption: Signal mapping of transcription factors regulating the fate of HPCs. (1)
  FoxA1/2 inhibits cellular energy metabolism to maintain the self-renewal. (2) Kupffer
  cells and Inflammatory cells release TGF-β, induce YB-1 nuclear translocation, and
  initiate the autophagy flow. (3) YB-1 binds to Matrix metalloproteinase genes, degrades
  the extracellular matrix, and promotes EMT. (4) Foxl1 is involved in the maintenance
  of the proliferation by crosstalk fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells through
  the Hedgehog signaling pathway. (5) Macrophages acquire Wnt signals after phagocytosis
  of hepatocyte fragments, damaging Notch to create hepatocyte specifications. (6)
  Notch ligands expression in myoblasts promotes the selection of HPCs to BECs. (7)
  Snail inhibits hepatocyte lineage differentiation by directly inhibiting HNF4α and
  microRNA. (8) HNF4α restricts the migration and reduces the probability of malignant
  transformation. (9) HNF1α inhibits the tumor propensity
