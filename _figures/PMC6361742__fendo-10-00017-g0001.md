caption: '(A) Summary of the N-glycan biosynthetic pathway: N-linked glycosylation
  begins in the RER with the co-translational transfer of a dolichol-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2
  to a Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif. In the cis-Golgi cisterna, additional mannose residues
  are removed. In medial-Golgi, hybrid-, and complex-type precursors are formed by
  the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. In the trans-Golgi, sequential
  addition of galactose, and sialic acid occurs. Alternatively, sequential addition
  of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and sulfate (SO4) produces sulfated oligosaccharides.
  (B) Some of the N-linked oligosaccharide structures present on human FSH: High mannose
  and hybrid type N-glycans are incomplete oligosaccharides. Bi- and tri-antennary
  oligosaccharides are complex type N-glycans. A “bisecting” GlcNAc residue attached
  to the β-mannose of the core may be present in complex and hybrid-type oligosaccharides.
  Glycoforms lacking terminal residues such as fucose, galactose, GalNAc, sulfate,
  and/or sialic acid may also be present.'
