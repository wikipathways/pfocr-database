caption: Schematic representation of proposed signaling pathways involved in HbR-induced
  IL-8 production. Upon exposure to HbR, Erk1/2 is activated, resulting in the activation
  of NF-κB and ATF-2, which, in turn, may promote IL-8 transcription. In parallel,
  HbR activates the p38-MAP kinase pathway, which is also involved in HbR-mediated
  IL-8 upregulation through the activation of CREB.
