caption: The synthesis of compatible compounds and signaling molecules integrating
  into plant metabolism. Depending on the respective genetic potential, plants differ
  in the expression of metabolic pathways. Moreover, these preferences may vary during
  a plant’s life cycle. This has consequences for the preferences to produce individual
  compounds such as compatible solutes, hormones, and other signaling molecules. Levels
  of these molecules depend on both availabilities of substrates (precursors) and
  the activities of enzymes involved in biosynthesis.
