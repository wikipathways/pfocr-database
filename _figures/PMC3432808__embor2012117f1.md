caption: Cell-nonautonomous control of the UPR and HSR. (A) Organismal control of
  UPR responses in peripheral tissue by the nervous system in adult Caenorhabditis
  elegans. The activity of OCTR-1, expressed in sensory neurons, represses the IRE1/XBP1
  pathway, modulating innate immunity. PMK-1 might also modulate this pathway. (B)
  A related pathway also operates to control innate immunity during C. elegans development,
  involving the direct regulation of a non-canonical UPR response (abu genes). This
  pathway might be regulated by the phagocytic receptor CED-1, and does not engage
  a classical UPR response. (C) The HSR is negatively regulated by thermosensory neurons
  though GCY-8 and is modulated by the dauer pheromone. A feedback loop from peripheral
  tissue to sensory neurons modulates behavioural responses against fluctuations in
  body temperature. CED-1, cell death abnormal 1; GCY-8, guanylyl cyclase 8; HSR,
  heat shock response; IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme 1; OCTR-1, octopamine receptor
  1; PMK-1, mitogen-activated kinase 1; UPR, unfolded protein response; XBP1, X-box
  binding protein 1.
