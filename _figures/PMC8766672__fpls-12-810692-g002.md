caption: 'Simplified metabolic pathways in a white lupin cluster root cell in response
  to Al stress. Aluminum present in the rhizosphere enters the cells primarily through
  aquaporins and NRAMP transporters. Through the action of Ca2+signaling pathways,
  transcription factors and miRNAs, Al induces replication of DNA that leads to activation
  of the TCA cycle, the glycolysis pathway and the glyoxylate cycle. This leads to
  the accumulation of organic acids and phenolic compounds. Activation of specific
  transport systems (MATE, ALMT, ABC-transporters) leads to the exudation of these
  compounds into the rhizosphere. OAs and phenolic compounds chelate Al cations outside
  and inside the cells. Intracellular complexes are accumulated in the vacuole. Extrusion
  of H+ and K+ contribute to the maintenance of the membrane potential. Ethylene production
  increases, while auxin and cytokinin levels increase or decrease depending on the
  developmental stage and the different root zones. Abbreviations: 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate;
