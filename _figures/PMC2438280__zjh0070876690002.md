caption: Exogenous/endogenous, regulators/modulators of PARP activity. Various endogenous
  factors can influence PARP activity either by forming a complex with PARP or inhibiting
  the binding of its substrate NAD+ to the active site of the enzyme. Such examples
  may include estrogen (E), thyroid hormones (T), nicotinamide (NA), NAD+ metabolites,
  and vitamin D. PARP activity can also be modulated by various kinases by phosphorylation
  (eg, MAP kinases and PKC), and PARP can modulate kinase (eg, AKT) activity. Different
  exogenous factors (eg, caffeine and its endogenously formed metabolites, theophylline,
  and tetracycline antibiotics) may also modulate PARP activity.
