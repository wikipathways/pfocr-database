caption: TRAIL signalling induces the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. TRAIL triggers
  the extrinsic apoptotic pathway while conventional chemotherapeutics and radiotherapy
  trigger the intrinsic apoptotic pathway mediated by mitochondria. There is crosstalk
  between the two pathways mediated by cleavage of BID into t-BID by caspase 8. cFLIP
  and IAPs are potent inhibitors of apoptotic proteins and their inhibition could
  induce synergistic effects by simultaneous triggering of both pathways. FADD = FAS-activated
  death domain; BID = BH3 interacting-domain death agonist; BAK = Bcl-2 homologous
  antagonist; Cyt-C = cytochrome c; Apaf-1 = apoptotic protease-activating factor
  1.
