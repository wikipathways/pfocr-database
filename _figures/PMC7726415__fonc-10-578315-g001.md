caption: Regulation of major metabolism pathways by Nrf2. Nrf2 plays an essential
  role in regulating major metabolism pathways. As shown in the figure, genes in red
  and blue font indicate positive and negative regulation by Nrf2, respectively. In
  glycolysis, Nrf2 activation results in the downregulation of pyruvate kinase (PK).
  In pentose phosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase (PGD) is rate-limiting enzymes, which are positively regulated by
  Nrf2. Nrf2 also controls the non-oxidative part of pentose phosphate pathway by
  increasing the levels of transaldolase 1 (TALDO1) and transketolase (TKT). In terms
  of NAPDH metabolism, G6PD and PGD are key enzymes of NADPH production. Nrf2 also
  positively regulates malic enzyme 1 (ME1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1),
  indicating that NADPH generation depends heavily on Nrf2. Nrf2 also participates
  in glutathione metabolism. Glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) and modifier
  (GCLM) subunits regulated by Nrf2 consume NADPH in the synthesis of glutathione.
  Other ingredients of glutathione including glutamate and cysteine are leveled by
  system Xc- (xCT), another Nrf2 targeted gene, which can channel the movement of
  glutamate and cysteine. Iron metabolism is controlled by Nrf2 in the heme metabolism
  arm and iron storage arm. ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 6 (ABCG6) and
  Ferrochelatase (FECH) participate in heme synthesis. Biliverdin reductase A and
  B (BLVRA/B) and heme oxygenase (decycling) 1 (HMOX1) are enrolled in heme degradation.
  Ferritin light chain (FTL) and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) engage in iron pool
  balance. These proteins are directly or indirectly regulated by Nrf2. Ferroptosis
  induced by the accumulation of free iron results from peroxidized fatty acids, which
  can be rescued by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), regulated by Nrf2. Further, fatty
  acid metabolism is negatively adjusted by Nrf2. ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1
  (SCD1) are key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis. In terms of fatty acid oxidation,
  Nrf2 positively regulates carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and CD36, which
  channel fatty acids through the membrane of mitochondria for oxidation. The influence
  of Nrf2 on fatty acid metabolism can alter ferroptosis, as it may affect the distribution
  of fatty acids.
