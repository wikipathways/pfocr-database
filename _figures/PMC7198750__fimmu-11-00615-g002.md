caption: 'Depiction of the cGAS-STING pathway. (A) Cytoplasmic DNA challenge. (1)
  Extrinsic DNA source: extracellular DNA can be taken up into endosomes for digestion.
  Increased membrane permeability allows endolysosomal pathogenic DNA release into
  the cytosol. Viruses can release virons into the cytosol. The hexamer pore facilitates
  movement of nucleotides into the capsid. The latter can also be ubiquitinated and
  degraded. (2) Intrinsic DNA source: self-DNA from the nucleus with dysfunctional
  chromatin proteins can lead to chromatin DNA injury and gDNA presenting in the cytoplasm.
  Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) induced by mitochondrial stress
  can release oxidized mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). (3) Three-prime repair exonuclease
  1 (TREX1), DNase II, SAM domain, HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) and RNaseH2
  can restrict cytosolic DNA and DNA/RNA hybrids. cGAMP can be hydrolyzed by ectonucleotide
  pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 1 (ENPP1). (B) cGAMP transferring
  between cells. cGAMP can be transferred between cells through viruses, membrane
  fusion, extracellular vesicles and cell gap junctions. Extracellular cyclic dinucleotides
  (CDNs) can transfer directly into cells by SLC19A1. CDNs (including cGAMP) might
  be exported by some ways. (C) Inflammatory signaling mediated by the cGAS-STING
  pathway. After sensing DNA, cGAS produces cGAMP and extracellular CDNs, promoting
  stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to undergo dimerization. STING can exit from
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and be translocated from the ER to the ER-Golgi
  vesicle, and arrives at the Golgi. STING and TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) can be
  oligomerized and cluster at the Golgi. The STING-TBK1/IκB kinase (IKK) signalosome
  forms a scaffold to phosphorylate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and inhibitor
  of NF-κBα (IκBα). Then, dimerized IRF3 and the activated canonical NF-κB p50/p65
  complex can be translocated into the nucleus as transcription factors to promote
  transcription of type-I IFN. (D) Autophagy initiation and degradation. STING activation
  on ER triggers ER stress and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) dysfunction.
  ER stress and mTORC1 dysfunction can stimulate the Unc-51 like autophagy activating
  kinase (ULK1) complex and beclin1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit
  type 3 (PI3KC3) complex. Autophagy-related protein 9 (ATG9) and light chain 3 (LC3)
  are associated with genesis and elongation of the autophagosome. After autophagy
  initiation, cGAS-STING is ubiquitinated and binds with p62. Then, they are packaged
  into autophagosomes and terminally sorted to lysosomes (Bold arrows represent main
  signaling pathways, thinner arrows represent regulatory signaling pathways, and
  dashed arrows represent bypass or suspicious pathways).'
