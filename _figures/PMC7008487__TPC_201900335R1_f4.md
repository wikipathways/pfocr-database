  and light modulate PHYB activity, regulate the concentration of PIF4, and indirectly
  determine the levels of PIF4–BES1 heterodimerization. The interaction of these TFs
  determines their gene targets and leads to different cellular responses. Xylem differentiation
  is governed by the TRACHEARY ELEMENT DIFFERENTIATION INHIBITORY FACTOR signaling
  pathway. GSK3s are crucial components in this pathway, which act as negative regulators
  of xylem differentiation and enable crosstalk with the BR signaling pathway. Stomatal
  development is fine-tuned by the dual role of BIN2 and is dependent on its subcellular
  localization. When located in the nucleus, BIN2 mainly acts as a negative regulator
  of SPCH activity, whereas in complex with BASL and POLAR, it relocalizes to the
  PM polarized region of MMC and acts as a negative regulator of YDA and MKKs, leading
  to SPCH activation. BRs inhibit flowering by promoting the expression of flowering
  inhibitor FLC. Additionally, the expression BR biosynthetic genes exhibits diurnal
  changes. During the root epidermal cell fate determination process, BIN2 phosphorylates
  EGL3, leading to its trafficking from the nucleus to cytosol in trichoblast cells,
  which facilitates its movement from trichoblast to atrichoblast cells. BIN2 can
  also phosphorylate TTG1 to inhibit the activity of the WER–GL3/EGL3–TTG1 transcriptional
  complex. In the root apical meristem, BRs control the size of the stem cell niche
  by balancing the expression of BRAVO, which negatively regulates cell divisions
  in the quiescent center. BR signaling levels increase along the longitudinal axis,
  with higher levels present in cells closer to the differentiation/elongation zone.
