caption: 'Pathophysiological mechanisms linking IR and hypertension in children with

  is decreased and nitric oxide synthase activation is impaired, leading to decreased
  NOS production and therefore vasoconstriction. At the same time, insulin signalling
  through the MAPK pathway remains normally sensitive to insulin. For this reason,
  compensatory hyperinsulinemia (secondary to insulin resistance in the IRS-1/PI3K
  pathway) causes excessive stimulation of the MAPK pathway, which is involved in
  inflammation, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and atherogenesis. Ab—Abbreviations:
