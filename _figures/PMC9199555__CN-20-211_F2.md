caption: 'Processing of APP by the secretases. A) In the nonamyloidogenic pathway,
  APP is first cleaved by α-secretase within the Aβ sequence, which releases the APPsα
  ectodomain. Further processing of the resulting carboxyl terminal by γ-secretase
  results in the release of the p3 fragment. B) The amyloidogenic pathway is initiated
  when β-secretase cleaves APP at the amino terminus of the Aβ peptide and releases
  the APPsβ ectodomain. Further processing of the resulting carboxy-terminal fragment
  by γ-secretase results in the release of Aβ. C) The amino acid residues from various
  cleavage of APP. Aβ and p3 fragments of differing lengths are produced by processing
  of APP at two different sites by γ-secretase. Abbreviations: Aβ, amyloid-β; APP,
  amyloid precursor protein; APPsα, soluble amyloid precursor protein-α; APPsβ, soluble
  amyloid precursor protein-β; C83, carboxy-terminal fragment 83; C59, carboxy-terminal
  fragment 59; C99, carboxy-terminal fragment 99. The APP progressing was referred
  to literature [] and created on BioRender.com.'
