caption: Intracellular and extracellular ROS generating systems. The macrophages and
  eosinophils generate free O2−. These O2− are converted into water when they interact
  with superoxide dismutase (SOD) (dismutation). When ferric ions act on O2−, they
  get reduced to iron (Haber-Weiss chemistry), and they release free OH, which is
  the most reactive and harmful substances of ROS. H2O2 is also formed by the interaction
  with iron ion (Fenton chemistry)(Polosa ). Another pathway of producing OH is through
  the oxidation of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl is produced by neutrophils. They
  contain a high concentration of myeloperoxidase (MPO). MPO chlorinates H2O2 (created
  by O2 dismutation) to produce HOCl. HOCl is also a powerful oxidant that can cause
  several harms. Eosinophil epoxidase (EPO) is a protein found in both eosinophils
  and neutrophils. EPO brominates H2O2 to form HOBr, which is also a reactive species,
  in the same way that MPO does. The H2O2, which is less reactive, is converted to
  water by catalase or by glutathione peroxidase (Fig. 1). Through the electron donation
  to the biological system, ROS (OH, HOCl, HOBr) are highly unstable and interact
  with a wide range of molecules, leading to lipid peroxidation dysfunction (LPO)
  and increased co-inflammatory signaling. All of these cause modifications in cellular
  functions of the inflamed lung
