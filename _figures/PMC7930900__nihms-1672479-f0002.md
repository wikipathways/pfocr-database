caption: 'SEDS-bPBP pairs are associated with morphogenetic complexes to direct spatially-regulated
  PG synthesis, while movement of the aPBPs and LDTs are independent of the division/elongation
  machinery. Left panel: The importance of LDT activity varies among species. In some
  organisms, LDT-mediated crosslinking is important in specific regions in a cell,
  such as during stalk formation or unipolar growth. LDT activity also appears important
  for resistance to antibiotic treatment. Movement of the aPBPs is diffusive followed
  by periods of confinement. The bifunctional aPBPs likely act as repair machinery
  necessary for efficient growth and/or PG synthesis during stress conditions. Middle
  panel: In almost all bacteria with a cell wall, PG synthesis associated with the
  divisome is carried out by the FtsW-FtsI enzyme pair. The movement of FtsW-FtsI
  is bidirectional around the short axis of the division plane, directed by treadmilling
  of FtsZ filaments. The conserved activation pathway for FtsW-FtsI likely requires
  the divisome proteins FtsA, FtsK, FtsN, and FtsQLB. Right panel: In many rod-shaped
  organisms, RodA-PBP2 synthesize PG for elongation and are regulated by elongasome
  proteins, notably MreC. The elongation machinery moves bidirectionally about the
  circumference of the short axis of the cell but, unlike the divisome, movement is
  directed by PG synthesis rather than MreB dynamics.'
