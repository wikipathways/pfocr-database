caption: The neurohormone bursicon acts on the Gs-coupled GPCR rickets expressed in
  wing cells. The GPCR activity leads to dissociation of the heterotrimeric Gs complex
  into GTP-loaded Gαs and free Gβγ-heterodimer. Gαs[GTP] activates the cAMP-PKA pathway
  to promote apoptosis. Gβγ, on the other hand, acts to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition. These two processes, acting in coordination, lead to post-eclosion wing
  expansion and solidification. Expression of the constitutively active Gαs or cholera
  toxin stimulates the Gαs-dependent branch in this signaling. Expression of Gαo inhibits
  this signaling through sequestration of the Gβγ-subunits.
