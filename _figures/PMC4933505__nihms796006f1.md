caption: The tissue factor (TF) and contact activation pathways lead to a common pathway
  that generates thrombin. In the tissue factor pathway, tissue injury or inflammatory
  cytokines induce cell-surface expression of TF. The TF/FVIIa complex activates FX,
  which converts FII to thrombin. In the contact activation pathway, negatively charged
  surfaces (such as phospholipids and polyphosphates from activated platelets) activate
  FXII, initiating a cascade leading to FX activation and thrombin generation. Thrombin
  triggers formation of blood clots, provides feed-back amplification or inhibition
  of the coagulation activation process and engages in receptor-dependent signalling.
  Localization of the coagulation cascade to cell surfaces ensures a spatial constraint
  on thrombin generation. Feed-back amplification is provided by activation of the
  non-catalytic cofactors FV and FVIII, platelet activation and thrombin-mediated
  activation of FXI. Excess coagulation activation is averted through several anticoagulant
  mechanisms, including inhibition of the TF/FVIIa/FXa complex by tissue factor pathway
  inhibitor (TFPI), inhibition of several coagulation factors by antithrombin (AT)
  and proteolytic inactivation of FVa and FVIIIa by activated protein C (aPC). As
  aPC is generated by the FIIa/thrombomodulin complex on undisturbed endothelial cells,
  local generation of FIIa following endothelial or vascular injury triggers aPC formation
  in a spatially and temporally limited fashion. Thrombin, aPC and other coagulation
  proteases interact with protease activated receptors, initiating cellular signalling
  that regulates inflammation and tissue remodelling. a, activated; F, factor; PC,
