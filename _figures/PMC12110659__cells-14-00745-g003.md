caption: 'Antigen Processing and Presentation Via Autophagy. A multi-step process:
  (1) A double-membrane structure, called a phagophore, begins to form around cellular
  components (e.g., proteins, organelles, or pathogens). (2) The phagophore expands
  and engulfs intracellular materials to form a sealed structure called an autophagosome.
  (3) Degraded peptides from autophagy are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) via Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) proteins. (4) Inside
  the ER, peptides are loaded onto MHC class I molecules. (5) Peptide-loaded MHC class
  II molecules are transported to the cell surface via the secretory pathway. (6)
  The antigens are displayed on the cell surface for recognition by cytotoxic T-cells
  (CD8+ T-cells). (7) The peptides generated during autophagy are transferred to MHC
  class II loading compartments (MIIC), in MIICs, MHC class II molecules bind these
  peptides. (8) On the cell surface, MHC class II molecules display the autophagy-derived
  peptides for recognition by helper T-cells (CD4+ T-cells)'
