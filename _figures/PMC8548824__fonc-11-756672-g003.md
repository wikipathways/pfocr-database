caption: Schematic representation of the possible therapeutic strategies coupling
  cabozantinib to other signaling inhibitors in preclinical models of HCC. It has
  been previously shown that cabozantinib treatment on HCC cells leads to the compensatory
  activation (dotted, black line) of the FAK pathway, in which the use of FAK inhibitors
  can overcome. A synergistic, antineoplastic effect has also been observed when cabozantinib
  was co-administered to AKT/mTOR inhibitors. In addition, targeting the IGFR1 and
  FGFR1 pathways might hinder the resistance of cancer cells to cabozantinib administration.
  A possible synergistic effect could also be achieved with the concomitant treatment
  with cabozantinib and immune checkpoint inhibitors, although the data in this regard
  are contradictory (question mark).
