caption: Schematic overview of the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of DHA
  bioactive oxylipins, 11-HDHA and 14-HDHA, on platelet activation and thrombus formation.
  In platelets, 12-LOX metabolizes free DHA into 11-HpDHA and 14-HpDHA, which are
  immediately reduced to the bioactive oxylipins, 11-HDHA and 14-HDHA. Both oxylipins
  activate protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates a number of proteins, including
  vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), leading to inhibition of α-granule
  release, platelet activation and thrombus formation in response to collagen.
