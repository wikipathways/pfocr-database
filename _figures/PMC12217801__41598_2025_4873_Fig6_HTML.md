caption: Schematic representation of the proposed molecular mechanism by which PBM
  preserves erectile function in diabetic mice. PBM enhances mitochondrial function,
  activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and promoting AKT phosphorylation. This
  activation upregulates proangiogenic factors, including VEGF, eNOS, Ang-1, and FGF-2,
  supporting endothelial repair and vascular regeneration while inhibiting pro-apoptotic
  Caspase-3 signaling. Activated AKT also facilitates the synthesis of nucleotides,
  proteins, and lipids essential for tissue regeneration. PBM increases NO levels,
  which contribute to pro-survival signaling and vasodilation and induces neurotrophic
  factors such as BDNF, NGF, and NT-3 promoting neurogenesis and neural repair. These
  combined effects highlight PBM’s potential in restoring cellular, vascular, and
  neuronal functions in diabetic conditions. PBM, photobiomodulation; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase; Ang-1, angiopoietin-1; FGF-2, Fibroblast growth factor 2; NO, nitric oxide;
  BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; NGF, nerve growth factor; NT-3, neurotrophin-3
