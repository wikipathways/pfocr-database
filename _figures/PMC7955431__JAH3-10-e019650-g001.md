caption: A, The interaction of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2
  (SARS‐CoV‐2) with endothelial cells (type II pneumocytes, glomerular capillary loops,
  and small intestine capillaries). Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) imbalance
  may promote susceptibility to the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of these cell types. Furthermore,
  cell infection and induced inflammation in pericytes and endothelial cells may promote
  local apoptosis and potent inflammatory cytokines. B, Inflammatory process in the
  pulmonary alveoli, leading to pulmonary tissue edema and intravascular coagulopathy.
  C, Selection of thrombotic complications in COVID‐19 and their approximate frequency.
  D, Proposed intravascular thrombosis pathways leading to microvascular and macrovascular
  thrombosis complications. Because of the potent local and systemic cytokine production,
  the platelets are activated and interact with neutrophils. The neutrophil extracellular
  trap (NET)osis process may also stimulate thrombin production and fibrin deposition.
  The excess of fibrin deposition and fibrinolysis shutdown lead to intravascular
  thrombosis and, finally, to clinical thromboembolic complications. The pointed black
  and continued black lines denote pathway connections, pointed red lines denote inhibition,
  and green arrows denote agonism. ACE‐I indicates angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor;
  anti‐Xa, anti–factor Xa; AT1, angiotensin II receptor type 1; CAHA, COVID‐19–associated
  hemostatic abnormalities; D‐D, D‐dimer; DTI, direct thrombin inhibitor; IL, interleukin;
  LMWH, low‐molecular‐weight heparin; PAI‐1, plasminogen activator inhibitor I; PFD,
  fibrin degradation product; r‐tPA, recombinant tPA; TMPRSS2, transmembrane protease
  serine 2; tPA, tissue‐type plasminogen activator; TriS, synthesized trisulfated
  heparin; and UFH, unfractionated heparin. Data derived and visual presentation modeled
  from Bikdeli et al.
