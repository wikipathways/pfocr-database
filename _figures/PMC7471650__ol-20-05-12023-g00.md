caption: Potential signaling pathways underlying Sirt3-mediated regulation of autophagy.
  Sirt3 is involved in autophagy via the downregulation of p62. The Sirt3/FOXO3a/p62
  and macrophage stimulating 1/Sirt3 signaling pathways can downregulate p62 expression.
  In addition, Sirt3 can directly activate PI3K/AKT signaling to inhibit autophagy.
  Mechanistically, Sirt3 indirectly controls the hyperactivation of AKT by regulating
  mitochondrial ROS production and ROS-mediated Ras-PI3K-AKT activation. Sirt3 can
  activate LKB1, such that the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway serves an important role in
  autophagy. AMPK can inhibit mTOR directly to promote autophagy whilst also acting
  upstream of Sirt3. ROS can act as a trigger signal to induce autophagy through autophagy
  related protease 4. Autophagy may be suppressed by Sirt3 through the regulation
  of mitochondrial ROS production. The Sirt3/SOD2 pathway is involved in mitochondrial-derived
  O2-stimulated autophagic cell death. Sirt3-mediated deacetylation can significantly
  increase the activity of SOD2 to ultimately reduce intracellular ROS levels. Sirt3,
  sirtuin; FOXO3a, forkhead box O3; ROS, reactive oxygen species; LKB1, liver kinase
  B1; AMPK, 5′AMP-activated protein kinase; SOD2, superoxide dismutase 2.
