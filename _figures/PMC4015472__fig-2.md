caption: Expression and signaling of type I and III IFNs are modulated by miRNA and
  AU-rich element (ARE)-binding proteins (ARE-BPs). Type I and III IFNs and specific
  miRNAs are induced by pattern recognition receptors sensing microbial PAMPs (more
  details in ). Type I and III IFNs signal in an autocrine and paracrine fashion to
  activate Jak/STAT proteins upon engagement of IFNαβ receptor (composed of IFNAR1
  and IFNAR2 subunits) and IFNλ receptor (composed of IFNLR1 and IL-10R2 subunits)
  respectively. Phosphorylation of the receptor will lead to the recruitment and activation
  of the ISGF3 complex comprising STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 proteins. The phosporylated
  ISGF3 complex translocates into the nucleus and binds to promoters containing ISRE
  sequences, activating transcription of ISGs and miRNAs. miRNAs inhibit the transcription
  of type I and III IFN genes by targeting the 3′ UTR of genes downstream of MyD88
  signaling pathway (IRAK1, TRAF6, and TAB). Type I and III IFN transcripts, besides
  being miRNA targets themselves, harbor AREs in their 3′ UTR, which recruit ARE-BPs
  involved in post-transcriptional regulation. Lastly, IFN signaling is suppressed
  by miRNAs, which target the 3′ UTRs of IFNAR1, STAT1, and STAT2 genes. In contrast,
  miR-155 increases type I and III IFN signaling by downregulating SOCS1, which is
  a negative regulator of JAK/STAT signaling. ISGF3, interferon-stimulated gene factor
  3; SOCS1, suppressor of cytokine signaling; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; TAK, TGF-beta-activated kinase; TAB,
  TAK-binding protein.
