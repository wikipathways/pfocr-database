caption: 'ROS functions in cancer cells: The production of ROS is elevated in tumor
  cells as a consequence of increased metabolic rate, gene mutation, extracellular
  growth factor signaling and relative hypoxia. This increase in the baseline ROS
  level plays a crucial role in determining cancer cells’ fate: (1) ROS can drive
  cancer cell proliferation by inactivating PTEN, a tumor suppressor that acts as
  a brake on the pro-growth PI3K/Akt pathway. (2) Inversely, increased ROS can have
  a nefarious effect on the cancer cell by activating apoptotic pathways. As such,
  oxidative stress may lead to the formation of disulfide bonds in the thioredoxin
  molecule, which results in the activation of the kinase Ask1 and subsequent activation
  of key apoptotic transcription factors like JNK and p38. (3) A similar process occurs
  in the case of p53 activation, where an ROS-triggered formation of disulfide bonds
  at the Cys 2999 residues of ATM homodimer results in activation and subsequent phosphorylation
  of p53 and its inhibitory molecule MDM2. P53 alongside JNK, p38, and other transcription
  factors will shift the balance towards apoptosis by expressing proteins, such as
  Bax homodimers, BAK and PUMA, to the detriment of antiapoptotic proteins such as
  Bcl-2, Bcl-XL or MCL. (4) ROS can prevent the proteasomal degradation of transcription
  factor Nrf2 by dissociating the KEAP1-Nrf2 complex and thus allowing Nrf2 to translocate
  to the nucleus and activate antioxidant pathways that can mitigate the proapoptotic
  effect of ROS. (5) By oxidizing iron from its ferrous (Fe2+) to its ferric (Fe3+)
  state, ROS dampens the enzymatic activity of PHDs which would normally hydroxylase
  the HIF-1α protein causing its proteasomal degradation. The non-hydroxylated form
  of HIF-1α has a major role in promoting cancer cell survival, angiogenesis and metabolic
  reprogramming under hypoxic conditions. PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; Ask1,
