caption: A) During EndMT, ECs up-regulate bFGF in response to TGFβ stimulation. bFGF
  secreted by these transitioning ECs counteracts TGFβ and maintains EC identity through
  autocrine/paracrine loops. B) TGFβ signals through a TGFβR1 and TGFβR2 receptor
  complex, which activates SMAD2/3 (and non-SMAD pathways) to induce EndMT. bFGF neutralizes
  TGFβ signalling by targeting multiple nodes of the TGFβ pathway. bFGF increases
  “anti-EndMT” microRNAs including let-7 and miR-20a leading to the down-regulation
  of TGFβ receptors and a receptor-associated protein SARA. Another pathway activated
  by bFGF is the Ras/MEK/ERK branch, which can oppose TGFβ signalling by suppressing
  SMAD2 phosphorylation. Additional auxiliary regulatory mechanisms through MEK/ERK
  may also contribute to bFGF’s antagonistic activities.
