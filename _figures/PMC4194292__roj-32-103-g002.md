caption: Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) derive from multiple sources within
  the cell and in response to external stimuli (1, cellular membrane ROS predominantly
  through NADPH oxidase; 2, mitochondrial ROS and reactive nitrogen species through
  cytochrome C pathway; 3, X-rays passing through the cell interact with water and
  other cellular molecules to produce ROS). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is particularly
  damaging to cells (green circle) and is produced by all three mechanisms.
