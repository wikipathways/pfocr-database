caption: (Upper figure) Proposed mechanisms for the beneficial effects of statins
  in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cellular pathways altered by statins during the course
  of infection in COVID-19 patients. Surface expression of ACE2 in epithelial and
  endothelial cells is enhanced by statins. Statins also mitigate the MYD88–NF-κB
  pathway and the ensuing proinflammatory cytokine response following interaction
  of SARS-CoV-2 with toll-like receptors (TLRs). The anti-thrombotic effects of statins
  are mediated by suppressive effects on tissue factor, and cytosolic phospholipase
  A2 (cPLA2)-induced thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis and inactivated endothelial cells
  and platelets, respectively. Statins have also been suggested to decrease plasma
  membrane cholesterol content in the host cells, which can interfere with the replication
  of virus particles. (Lower figure) Proposed mechanisms for the anti-thrombotic effects
  of statins in SARS-CoV-2 infection SARS-CoV-2 induces activation of endothelial
  cells and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can lead to:1) over-expression
  of adhesion molecules (e.g. P-selectins, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1),
  von Willebrand factor, αvβ3) and further release of proinflammatory cytokines; 2)
  increased recruitment of leukocytes and platelets; 3) activated endothelial cells
  also express tissue factor, which activates factor VII, factor Xa, and thrombin
  formation; 4) fibrinogen is cleaved into fibrin by thrombin; 5) thrombin is essential
  for thrombus formation; 6)pro-inflammatory factors can also promote coagulation
  and accelerate platelet activation and thrombus formation; and 7)statins downregulate
  proinflammatory cytokine release from endothelial cells and mitigate coagulation
  cascade. Moreover, statins interfere with SARS-CoV-2 entry intoACE2- expressing
  endothelial cells and ensuing endothelial activation (reproduced with permission
