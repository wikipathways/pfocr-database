caption: 'The defence against oxidative and nitrosative radicals imposed by macrophages
  relies on antioxidants here represented in the thiol pool with 3 major thiols: (a)
  cysteine with 2 synthesis pathways in trypanosomatids including transsulfuration
  pathway (as in vertebrates) via homocysteine with a key enzyme cystathione β-synthase
  (CBS) (#1), and de novo synthesis from serine (as in some prokaryotes and eukaryotes)
  catalysed by cysteine synthase (CS) (#2); with sulfide possibly provided by mercaptopyruvate
  sulfurtransferase (MST) (#3) , ; (b) glutathione (GSH) synthesised by condensation
  of cysteine and glutamate with the key enzyme γ-glutamylcysteine synthase (GCS)
  (#4) ; and (c) trypanothione (T(SH)2) which is synthesised by condensation of glutathione
  and spermidine; with ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) as key enzyme of spermidine synthesis
  (#5) . Maintenance of redox balance is centred around the strong reductant T(SH)2
  and the flavo-enzyme trypanothione reductase (TR) which keeps the T(SH)2 pool reduced
  and the redox potential low (#6) , –; MST possibly also has an antioxidant role
  via thioredoxin (#7) . The drug SbV can be taken up by the parasite via an unidentified
  transporter (#8)  and the reduced form SbIII gains access via aquaglyceroporin (AQP1)
  (#9) . The reduction of SbV to SbIII involves thiols and can be a non-enzymatical
  spontaneous reduction –, or enzymatically catalyzed by thiol dependent reductase
  1 (TDR1)  or arsenate reductase 2 (ACR2)  (#10). The resulting SbIII can form conjugates
  with thiols and inhibit TR (#12), together leading to increase of redox potential
  –, . The SbIII/thiol conjugates can be sequestered by ABC transporter multidrug
  resistance protein A (MRPA) or possibly pentamidine resistance protein 1 (PRP1)
  ,  into intracellular organelles (#13), or can be directly pumped out by an uncharacterised
  transporter (#14)  (boxed names = proteins of which the corresponding genes were
  chosen for DNA sequencing and gene expression profiling in this study, unboxed names = metabolites;
  used abbreviations: ROI = reactive oxygen intermediates, RNI = reactive nitrogen
  intermediates).'
