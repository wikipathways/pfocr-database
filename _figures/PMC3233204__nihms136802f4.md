caption: Retinal progenitor cells (RPC) express characteristic genes including Rax,
  Pax6, and Chx10, and appear to remain proliferative and undifferentiated, at least
  partially, under the influence of Notch activity. Early during development, a subset
  of progenitor cells downregulate Notch activity, exit cell cycle and give rise to
  early born neurons, including retinal ganglion cells, cone photoreceptor cells,
  amacrine cells and horizontal cells. Under the influence of Notch, Rax, Chx10 and
  other progenitor genes, a fraction of the RPCs remain undifferentiated and reach
  a later stage of development during which both neurogenesis and gliogenesis is possible.
  The late RPCs downregulate Notch activity, exit cell cycle and are then able to
  commit to a neuronal or glial fate. High levels of positive bHLHs favor the neuronal
  fate. A reinitiation of the Notch pathway and concomitant upregulation of negative
  bHLHs favors the glial fate. Other pro-gliogenic factors, such as p27, Sox9, and
  EGF signaling, are most likely also involved. Neuronal insult in the form of injury,
  disease or hypoxia, leads to various changes including increased permeability of
  the blood retinal barrier and subsequent release of inflammatory mediators. These
  factors trigger glial activation, which initially manifests as a downregulation
  of the Kir channel activity. During this phase, proliferation is not observed. Decreased
  Kir channel activity along with activation of the BK channel characterizes proliferative
  gliosis. Downregulation of p27 appears to be the initial molecular alteration leading
  to cell cycle re-entry. At this time, intermediate filaments such as vimentin and
  GFAP are upregulated. Subsequent downregulation of cyclin D3 appears to limit the
  number of cell cycles that Müller glia undergo. Production of neurons might occur
  in only a subset of Müller glia, using signals that might be distinct from those
  that induce gliogenesis.
