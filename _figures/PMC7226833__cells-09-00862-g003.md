caption: 'The IGF-I receptor may form hybrids with the insulin receptor, many other
  tyrosine kinase receptors outside the insulin-IGF system and G-protein coupled receptors.
  The figure shows three examples: (A) Hybrids may be formed consisting of an alpha-beta
  subunit of the IGF-IR linked by disulfide bonds to an alpha-beta subunit of the
  IR. Downstream signaling of both receptors converge via the canonical PI3K-Akt and
  ERK signaling pathways. Most functional studies have found that hybrid receptors
  behave more like IGF-IRs than IRs (See also text). (B) Hybrids may be formed consisting
  of an alpha-beta subunit of the IGF-IR linked and a monomer of the epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR) which is also a tyrosine kinase receptor. Downstream signaling
  of both receptors converge via the canonical PI3K-Akt and ERK signaling pathways.
  Therefore, inhibition of one receptor of these hybrids may shift the signaling pathway
  in favor of the other available counterpart receptor. (C) The Thyroid Stimulating
  Hormone Receptor (TSH receptor), a typical G-protein coupled receptor, may form
  functional hybrids with the IGF-IR in the cellular membrane by forming a common
  protein complex. Bidirectional crosstalk between the IGF-IR and TSHR has been demonstrated.
  Stimulation of the IGF-IR by IGF-I/IGF-IR agonists may trigger the classical signaling
  pathway of the IGF-IR, leading to downstream kinase-cascade signaling activation.
  In addition, stimulation of the IGF-IR by IGF-I/IGF-IR agonists may also utilize
  components of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and activate pathways
  conventionally used by TSHR.'
