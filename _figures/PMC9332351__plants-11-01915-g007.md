caption: Proposed pathway of starch metabolism in different plastids. The proteins
  with red markers are unique in chloroplasts or amyloplasts, while these with blue
  markers are common in chloroplasts and amyloplasts. In the chloroplast, the Calvin–Benson
  cycle generates photoassimilates, including F6P and Triose-p. F6P can be converted
  to G1P in two subsequent steps catalyzed by PGI and PGM. G1P serves as the substrate
  for AGPase for starch biosynthesis. Triose-p can also be exported to the cytosol
  via the TPT. In the amyloplast, G6P synthesized via cytosolic PGM can be imported
  into the amyloplast by GPT. The imported G6P is then reconverted into G1P by plastidial
  PGM and as such can serve as a substrate for starch biosynthesis. F6P, Fructose-6-phosphate;
  Triose-p, triose-phosphate; TPT, triose-phosphate/phosphate translocator; PGI, phosphoglucoisomerase;
  G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; G1P, glucose 1-phosphate; PGM, phosphoglucomutase; AGPase,
  ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; SS, starch synthase; GBSS, granule-bound starch synthase;
  SBE, starch branching enzyme; GWD, glucan, water dikinase; PWD, phosphoglucan, water
  dikinase; BAM, beta-amylase; AMY, alpha-amylase; SEX4, starch excess 4; LSF, like
  starch-excess 4; DPE, disproportionating enzyme; PHO, alpha-glucan phosphorylase;
  GPT, glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator; NTT, nucleotide translocator; pGlcT,
  plastidic glucose transporter; pSuT, plastidic sugar transporter; MEX, maltose transporter;
  ESV, early starvation; LESV, like ESV; PTST, protein targeting to starch; ISA, isoamylase-type
  starch debranching enzymes; SBE, starch branching enzyme; pINV, plastidic invertase.
