caption: Identification of multiple disrupted components in a biological pathway.
  Integrative analysis identifies more genes affected in the EGFR signaling pathway
  than a single dimensional analysis alone. In this example, multidimensional profiling
  data were generated from ten lung adenocarcinomas and their paired noncancerous
  lung tissue. Analysis of DNA copy number (gene dosage) alterations that affected
  expression identified seven genes (in green) that are disrupted at ≥30% frequency.
  However, when alterations in copy number, DNA methylation, sequence mutation, and/or
  copy-neutral LOH were considered, 17 genes disrupted at ≥30% frequency were identified
  to be associated with a change in expression, with an additional gene, KRAS, harboring
  frequent mutation. The 11 additional genes are indicated in red. Genes in gray are
  not significant in this dataset as they did not meet the frequency criteria
