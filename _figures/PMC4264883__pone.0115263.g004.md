caption: 'Cisplatin induces cochlear oxidative stress by activating NOX3, which eventually
  could facilitate the nitration of cochlear LMO4. We reported a cisplatin-induced
  decrease in the expression of LMO4 in the cochlea (J Biol Chem 2012, 287: 18674–18686).
  LMO4 has been reported to act as a scaffold by associating with IL-6 receptor glycoprotein
  130 and enable the activation of JAK1, TYK2, and STAT3 (J Biol Chem 280: 12747–12757).
  Since activated STAT3 facilitates the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes, the
  cisplatin-induced decrease in LMO4 levels, probably due to proteolytic degradation
  of nitrated LMO4, appears to eventually compromise the STAT3-mediated anti-apoptotic
  machinery, resulting in ototoxicity. Moreover, LMO4 binds with BRCA1 and ESR1 and
  negatively regulates their activation (Cancer Res 65: 10594–10601). Since BRCA1
  directly binds with STAT1, which has been reported to facilitate cisplatin ototoxicity,
  and ESR1 binds with STAT3 and inhibits its activity, the cisplatin-induced up-regulation
  of ESR1 and down-regulation of STAT3 in the cochlea suggests that the LMO4 signaling
  in cisplatin ototoxicity probably involves STAT3-mediated apoptotic pathway to induce
  cochlear apoptosis.'
