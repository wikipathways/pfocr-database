caption: The clustering and selection step extracts a ‘clusterable’ subset of differentially
  expressed probesets and cluster it into a number of expression patterns. Subsequently,
  pathway enrichment is performed in each pattern and relevant significant pathways
  are selected based on literature information. The process of CRM searching is then
  applied to each gene battery which is a group of genes that belong to an expression
  pattern and a particular pathway. Eventually, 34 TFs are identified as human inflammation-relevant
  transcriptional regulators. The results show a highly dynamic perspective of regulation
  and interactions between genes, functions, and TF across the time.
