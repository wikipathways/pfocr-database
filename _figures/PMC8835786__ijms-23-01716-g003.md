caption: The primary phases of the essential signaling pathway for IFN-I-III production
  are inhibited by SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The signaling pathway for inducing IFN-I-III
  production is indicated by the blue color. The green color denotes post-transcriptional
  steps in IFN-I-III production and secretion. The blocks of the corresponding stages
  of IFN-I-III induction, production, and secretion that are produced by SARS-CoV-2
  proteins are shown in red. The direction of action effects is indicated by arrows.
