caption: 'A model for ABA receptors-mediated signaling pathway connected to FaMADS1
  regulating strawberry fruit ripening. In the presence of ABA, ABA signal activated
  ABI and TRAB transcription factors, and then FaMADS1 was inhibited. Depression of
  FaMADS1 induced the expression of anthocyanin-related FaPAL, FaC4H, Fa4CL, and FaUFGT,
  softening-related FaPL and FaXTH, and aroma-related FaQR and FaAAT. Abbreviations:
  AAT2, alcohol acyltransferase; ABA, abscisic acid; 4CL, ρ-coumarate ligase; C4H,
  cinnamicacid-4-hydroxylase; PAL6, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; PL, pectate lyase;
  QR, quinone oxidoreductase; SnRK2s, phosphorylation of ABA-activated sucrose non-fermenting
  1-related protein kinases subfamily 2; TRAB, transcription factor responsible for
  ABA regulation; UFGT, flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase; XTH, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase.
  The solid arrows indicate direct action and the dashed arrow indicates indirect
  action.'
