caption: The glycerol 3-phosphate (or phosphatidic acid) pathway represents the de
  novo lipogenesis route in the synthesis of triglycerides (TAG) and phospholipids.
  Acyl-CoA:glycerol-sn-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) catalyzes the acylation
  of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to generate lysophosphatidic
  acid (LPA), which is thought to be the rate-controlling step in TAG synthesis. PNPLA3
  seems to control this step through its transacetylation property. Fatty acyl-CoAs
  are then successively transferred to the glycerol backbone to from diacylglycerols
  (catalyzed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP)) and triacylglycerols (TAG) through
  diacylglycerol:acyl-CoA acyltransferases (DGAT). They can also esterify with sphingosine
  to form ceramides. LPA and PA require translocation through the cytosol for TAG
  synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum if they are not synthesized in the endoplasmic
  reticulum. CGI-58 controls compartmentation of DAGs. DAGs in the plasma-membrane
  fraction activate PKCε, which in turn attenuates insulin receptor activation through
  its ligand. Hydrolysis from TAG to DAG is mediated by adipose triglyceride lipase
  (ATGL). DAG can be further hydrolyzed to monoacylglycerol (MAG) by hormone-sensitive
  lipase (HSL) and subsequently to glycerol by monoglyceride lipase (MGL). These reactions
  release fatty acids. Glycerol can be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Plasma
  membrane DAG stimulate PKCε membrane translocation to inhibit the insulin receptor
  kinase.
