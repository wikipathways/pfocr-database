caption: Methyltransfer reactions in gentamicin biosynthetic pathway. The determined
  major and minor alternative pathways in the methylation network are indicated by
  boldface type and solid arrows, respectively. The dashed arrows refer to conversions
  without substantial experimental support. Methyltransferases and their roles revealed
  in this study of GenN, GenD1, GenK, and GenL are highlighted in magenta, orange,
  blue, and red, respectively. The extents of methylation are shown in the dashed
  rectangle boxes. Carbon numbering is shown with the structure of 1.
