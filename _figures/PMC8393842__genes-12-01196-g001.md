caption: 'The regulation of lysosomal-mediated degradation through the autophagy and
  multivesicular body (MVB) pathways. (A) The autophagy pathway is induced by AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibited by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Nutrient
  deprivation and oxidative stress promote AMPK activity, in turn activating the UNC-51
  like kinase 1 (ULK1) complex, which then recruits Atg5, Atg7, Atg10 and phosphorylates
  Beclin1 to promote further recruitment of the PI3K/VPS34 complex to enable phagophore
  formation. CHMP4B is a core component of ESCRT-III that further assists in mediating
  phagophore closure. The fusion between the autophagosome with the lysosome is mediated
  by CHMP2B to form the autophagolysosome, which contains cytosolic content destined
  for degradation. The absence of functional CHMP4B (CHMP4B-mutant) and either knock-down
  of VPS4 expression (red down arrow) or expression of dominant negative VPS4 or TSG101
  (TSG101-DN) prevents autophagosome-lysosome fusion resulting in autophagosome accumulation,
  and failure to degrade cargo such as the calcium-activated potassium channel 3.1
  (KCa3.1). (B) The biogenesis of MVBs and sorting of ubiquitinated cargo is regulated
  through the ESCRT pathway. The ESCRT machinery are grouped into four categories:
  ESCRT-0, ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and ESCRT-III. TSG101 is a member of the ESCRT-I complex
  that facilitates the sorting of ubiquitinated membrane-bound proteins into early
  endosomes. The ESCRT machinery sequentially assembles on the late endosome where
  it mediates the biogenesis of MVB vesicles and the sorting of ubiquitinated membrane-bound
  proteins into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs), and the ESCRT-III complex is involved
  in the recruitment of BRO1/ALIX to assist in the biogenesis of ILVs. After the biogenesis
  of MVBs and the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into ILVs, MVBs are then routed
  into the lysosome for degradation. Created with BioRender.com.'
