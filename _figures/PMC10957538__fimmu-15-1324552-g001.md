caption: 'Effects of particulate matter (PM) on mucociliary function, epithelial barrier
  integrity, and inflammatory changes in airways: PM leads to increased production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to higher oxidative stress in the cell,
  as well as lipid peroxidation and diminished antioxidant capacity. This imbalance
  causes augmented expression of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-1β,
  -6, -8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating
  factor (GM-CSF), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1 by epithelial
  cells and inflammatory cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes at
  the site of the inflammation. Increased inflammation may attract more inflammatory
  cells and lead to increased cytokine production that may cause activation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways, and nod-like
  receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome response'
