caption: NLRP3 inflammasome activation pathway. Signal 1 (priming) involves the activation
  of the TLR4 receptors found on microglia through numerous stimuli that include Aβ1–42
  and LPS. This results in the translocation of NF‐кB from the cytosol to the nucleus,
  which increases the transcription of NLRP3 and pro‐IL‐β. Following “priming,” the
  microglia need an additional stimulation from Signal 2 (activation). In this diagram,
  the efflux of K+ triggers the activation of the cascade that brings the NLRP3, ASC,
  and pro‐caspase 1 proteins together to form the NLRP3 inflammasome. This activates
  caspase 1, which cleaves IL‐1β and triggers pyroptosis resulting in cell death.
  The mature IL‐1β when released onto the surrounding cells exacerbates neuroinflammation
  and synaptic loss
