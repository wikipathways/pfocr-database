caption: 'Apoptosis pathways in cancer. Activation of the death receptor pathway by
  FAS, TRAIL or TNFα leads to two mechanisms of downstream signaling. TRAIL or FAS
  ligand promotes the interaction of the FAS receptor with FADD and caspase-8 to form
  the DISC complex. TNFα promotes transient recruitment of the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)
  with TRADD, TRAF2, TRAF5, cIAP1/2 and RIP, which form signaling complex I. Complex
  I triggers a number of downstream signals, such as NF-κB, JNK and p38, to promote
  survival by inducing the expression of antiapoptotic genes, such as cFLIP, a common
  inhibitor of TNFR signaling. However, posttranslational modifications of complex
  I, such as RIP deubiquitination, can promote the dissociation of RIP1 and TRADD
  from the complex; they bind to FADD and caspase-8/-10 to form the apoptotic complex
  II. Formation of DISC or complex 2 elicits two mechanisms leading to cell death:
  direct induction of the executioner caspases-3 and -7 in type I cells and cleavage
  of Bid (tBID), which engages the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In this pathway, stimuli,
  such as DNA damage or the presence of tBID, cause BAX and BAKk to interact and induce
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP). The resulting increase in MOMP
  leads to the release of cytochrome c and Smac into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c recruits
  APAF1 and caspase-9 to promote caspase-9 auto-activation and subsequent activation
  of the executioner caspases. Smac interacts with xIAP to prevent the inhibition
  of caspase-9 and -3.'
