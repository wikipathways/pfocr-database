caption: Schematic depicting the central role of HER3 in mediating PI3K/Akt signalling
  downstream of the HER family. Although all three receptors can bind Grb2 and activate
  the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, only HER3 can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway directly.
  EGFR and HER2 do not directly bind PI3K, HER3 has six binding sites for PI3K. When
  phosphorylated by EGFR or HER2, these HER3 phosphotyrosines bind the p85 subunit
  of PI3K leading to activation of membrane phosphoinositides to phosphoinositol triphosphate
  (PIP3). PIP3 recruits PH domain containing proteins Akt and PDK1 leading to activation
  of Akt. PIP3 phosphorylation is negatively regulated by the phosphatase PTEN. Activated
  Akt effects a diverse range of cellular programs involved in the cell cycle, protein
  translation, survival, nutrient sensing and metabolism, and gene transcription.
  Although HER TKIs can suppress the EGFR- or HER2-mediated phosphorylation of HER3
  and inactivate downstream Akt signalling, HER3 appears to be a resilient node in
  this circuitry. Two mechanisms that have been shown to allow HER3 phosphorylation
  to escape HER TKI therapy are Akt-driven negative feedback signalling that can amplify
  HER3 signalling, and amplification and overactivity of the tyrosine kinase receptor
  c-MET that can restore HER3 signalling through crosstalk. These two pathways that
  are known to mediate HER3 escape from TKI therapy are shown in blue dashed lines.
