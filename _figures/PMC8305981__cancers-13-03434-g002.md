caption: 'Regulation of CML stemness is independent of BCR–ABL1 oncogenic signaling.
  In the vast majority of mature CML cells, cell proliferation is driven by BCR–ABL1-mediated
  activation of the PI3K–Akt–mTORC1 signaling pathway. CML stem cells are able to
  maintain stem cell quiescence despite possessing the oncogene and so are TKI resistant.
  We have shown that Gdpd3 and lysophospholipid metabolism are essential for maintaining
  CML stem cell functions in vivo. Elevated lysophospholipid metabolism contributes
  to CML stemness by regulating an interaction between active Foxo3a and β-catenin
  (although the exact mechanism remains unclear). It is possible that Gdpd3-mediated
  lysophospholipid metabolism: (1) suppresses Akt via an LPA–LPARs pathway; (2) contributes
  to the biosynthesis of lipid mediators; and/or (3) participates in a gene expression
  program involving Gdpd3 and GPCRs by FOXO/β-catenin. Targeting any one of these
  elements of lysophospholipid metabolism specific to CML stem cells might provide
  fresh therapies to overcome disease relapse in many CML patients.'
