caption: 'Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing pathways and its modulation by
  different nutrients. The non-amyloidogenic pathway (A) occurs upon sequential cleavage
  by α- and γ-secretases (non-pathological situation) or by α- and β-secretases (pathological
  situation), while the amyloidogenic route (B) occurs when cleavage is carried out
  sequentially by β- and γ-secretases. Letters α, β, and γ represent each secretase.
  APP: amyloid precursor protein. sAPPα: soluble α-APP. sAPPβ: soluble β-APP. Nutrients
  that are proposed to interfere with APP processing are shown in the legend. Green
  arrows represent activation. Red truncated arrows show inhibition.'
