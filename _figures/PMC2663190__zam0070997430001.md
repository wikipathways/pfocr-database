caption: (A) Principles of metabolic network analysis with [1-13C]glucose. The 13C
  labeling pattern of pyruvate is dependent on the active metabolic pathways. For
  instance, pyruvate formed in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway contains 13C
  at position 3, while activity of the PP pathway results in loss of labeled carbon.
  Pyruvate is the precursor of valine, which is incorporated into biomass. Based on
  the labeling pattern of valine and other proteinogenic amino acids, the fluxes in
  central carbon metabolism can be resolved. (B) Major metabolic fluxes of the A.
  nidulans strains investigated, including strains A4 (wt), AR16msaGP74 (msaS), and
  AR1phk6msaGP74 (msaS+xpkA). All fluxes are relative to a glucose uptake rate of
  100 mol (arbitrary value). The dashed arrows indicate that the metabolite is a precursor
  drained for biomass formation. See File S2 in the supplemental material for abbreviations
  used for metabolites. TCA, tricarboxylic acid; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
