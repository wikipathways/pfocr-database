caption: Cellular processes leading to malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) initiation
  and growth. The asbestos fibers induce MPM by causing chronic inflammation of the
  parietal pleura recruiting phagocytes []. Phagocytes fail to degrade these fibers,
  which (i) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species resulting
  in a chronic inflammatory reaction, (ii) alters the DNA molecule of the mesothelial
  cells, with the appearance of chromosomal aberrations and mutations, (iii) impairs
  DNA repair mechanisms [, ], and (iv) leads to epigenetic alterations responsible
  for uncontrolled growth, resistance to apoptosis, and hence the occurrence of MPM
  [, , , ]. In addition to their action on the DNA of mesothelial cells, asbestos
  fibers would activate several signaling pathways (MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mammalian target
  of rapamycin) involved in the survival of mesothelial cells downstream of tyrosine
  kinase receptors such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor,
  or downstream integrin receptors. In parallel, signaling from growth factor receptors
  can be reinforced, these receptors often being overexpressed, thus accentuating
  the stimulation of the Ras association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A)/Hippo
  signaling pathway, a pathway involved when it functions physiologically in cellular
  homeostasis. Malignant pleural mesothelioma are lesions rich in T lymphocytes and
  fibroblasts, but expression of PDL-1 by tumoral mesothelial cells could inhibit
  CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation or lead to T-cell apoptosis, allowing tumor growing
  []. Finally, the interaction of hyaluronic acid with its main receptor, CD44, regulates
  matrix assembly, cytoskeleton architecture, cell migration, proliferation and differentiation
  of cancer stem cells [, ], and activates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) involved
  in tumor progression []. CD cluster of differentiation, ECM extracellular cell matrix,
  EGFR EGF receptor, MAPK mitogen activated protein kinase, PD-L1 programmed death-ligand
