caption: Graphic description of the HBP showing the position of GNPDAs. Glucose, a
  key player in the metabolic pathways, is transported into the cell and then phosphorylated
  by hexokinase (1). It is then isomerized into Fru6P and follows the glycolytic pathway
  until pyruvate. GlcN6P, a significant metabolite, is synthesized from Fru6P and
  glutamine (Gln) by GFAT (Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase or glucosamine-6-phosphate
  synthase) (2) or from NH4+ instead of Gln by the reverse reaction of GNPDA (3).
  GNPDA activity is a crucial part of the HBP, and the catabolic direction of this
  reaction is favored. GlcN6P is acetylated from Acetyl-CoA to form GlcNAc6P, the
  allosteric activator of GNPDA, by the enzyme Glucosamine-Phosphate N-Acetyltransferase
  1 (4). Deacetylation can occur according to a reverse reaction or be driven by the
  enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase (5). Phosphoacetylglucosamine
  mutase isomerizes GlcNAc6P into GlcNAc1P (6). Next, the UDP-N-acetyl hexosamine
  pyrophosphorylase produces UDP-GlcNAc from UTP and GlcNAc-1P (7). O-GlcNAc transferase
  (OGT) transfers the O-GlcNAc moiety to specific serine/threonine residues of diverse
  proteins (8). Finally, the enzyme Protein-O-GlcNAc hydrolase (OGA) removes GlcNAc
  from the modified protein (9). GlcNAc can be phosphorylated from ATP by a kinase
  to regenerate GlcNAc-1P. The fate of this metabolite depends on several conditions,
  such as the requirements of hyaluronan synthesis [1,7]. It can be recycled back
  into UDP-GlcNAc or to GlcN6P; then, GNPDA (3) can use the carbon in glycolysis and
  the ammonium in other biosynthetic pathways
