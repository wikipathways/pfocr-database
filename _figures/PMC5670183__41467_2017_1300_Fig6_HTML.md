caption: Signaling transduction by sterol sulfates in S. marinoi. The accumulation
  of sterol sulfates (StS) has a central role in regulating the diatom cell fate and
  the associated biochemical responses. Increase of their intracellular levels above
  a threshold of 0.5–0.6 pg per cell alters redox balance and induces rapid generation
  of NO. The ultimate effect is the launch of apoptotic events that lead to cell death.
  The effectors of this last process have not been identified yet but metacaspases
  are reported in S. marinoi and other diatoms. Synthesis of StS requires sulfonation
  of the sterol substrates, thus control of the pathway may concern de novo synthesis
  of sterols, mobilization of sterols from the membrane bilayer or up-regulation of
  SULT expression. Each of these processes can be triggered by environmental or physiological
  factors that, depending on the degree and type, determine the intracellular level
  of StS and, eventually, cell fate. A variety of environmental stressors or chemical
  molecules, including sterols, can activate SULT expression via specific nuclear
  receptors according to the literature on SULTs in other organisms
