  in platelet-shape change, inside-out activation of integrins, and degranulation.
  The cytosolic reduction of TXA2 concentration reduces circulating TXA2 availability
  and TXA2 receptor stimulation. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) can limit the intracellular
  levels of cyclic nucleotides and regulate platelet function by catalyzing the hydrolysis
  of cyclic adenosine 3'',5''-monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine 3'',5''-monophosphate

  production. In contrast, cilostazol is a PD3 inhibitor that blocks GMP production.
