caption: 'Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 infection pathways, spike protein
  domains, and main receptors. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein consists of two
  non-covalently linked subunits (S1 and S2). The S1 subunit first mediates virus
  binding to host cell receptors, primarily binding to ACE2 through its receptor-binding
  domain (RBD). However, other molecules, such as NRP1, TLR2/4, CD147, DPP4, nAchR,
  and TfR, can also act as receptors or co-receptors, depending on the cell type.
  Cell entry can occur via two pathways, depending on the expression of metalloproteinases
  on the cell surface. (A) In the absence or low expression of TMPRSS2/ADAM17, the
  virus enters the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently, the S2
  subunit is cleaved by endosomal proteases (such as cathepsin L) or ADAM17 in early
  endosomes, and viral-cell membrane fusion occurs within late endosomes, leading
  to the release of viral RNA. (B) In the presence of adequate levels of metalloproteinases,
  the S2 subunit is cleaved at the S2′ site at the cell membrane after conformational
  changes following the interaction of S1 with ACE2 or alternative receptors, leading
  to viral envelope-cell membrane fusion. Abbreviations: ACE2: Angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2; TMPRSS2: Type II transmembrane serine protease; ADAM17: A disintegrin
  and metalloprotease 17; NRP1: Neuropilin-1; TLR2/4: Toll-like receptors 2 and 4;
