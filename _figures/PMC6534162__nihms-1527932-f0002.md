caption: 'Exogenous signaling by growth factors, such as NRG/ERBB and IGF family members,
  activates intracellular pathways that promote cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation and
  regeneration mechanisms. The Hippo kinase pathway is an intrinsic signaling pathway
  that triggers inhibitory phosphorylation of the CM proliferation protein Yap. This
  leads to either Yap sequestration at the plasma membrane with the dystrophin glycoprotein
  complex (DGC) or in the cytosol with 14–3-3 (dashed arrows). Treatment of CMs with
  agrin or anti-Hippo (shSalv) molecules promotes localization of dephosphorylated
  Yap to the nucleus to drive expression of CM renewal genes. MicroRNAs (miRs) can
  positively or negatively regulate CM proliferation, and development of anti-miR
  antagomiR molecules have innovated cardiac repair strategies. The CM cell cycle
  can be reactivated via modulation of regulators such as Cyclin A2 and member of
  the Cyclin B and Cyclin D families. Delivery of Wee1 and TGFb inihibitor molecules
  enhances cyclin/CDK-induced cardiac repair. CM proliferation: positive regulators
  (green), negative regulators (red). . (Illustration Credit: Ben Smith).'
