caption: Putative biosynthetic pathway of collagen. Collagen synthesis begins in the
  rough endoplasmic reticulum. After protocollagen strands are translated by the ribosome,
  their globular N- and C-terminal propeptide domains establish the composition and
  register of a nascent triple helix. After extensive post-translational modification
  by CP4H and other enzymes, protocollagens form triple helices, a process facilitated
  by chaperones such as Hsp47. Procollagen triple helices are transported to the Golgi
  in enlarged COPII-coated vesicles. Ultimately, processed fibrils are incorporated
  into growing collagen fibers, which are stabilized by covalent crosslinks between
  triple helices. The inhibition of CP4H prevents triple-helix formation and likely
  leads to the degradation of protocollagens strands.
