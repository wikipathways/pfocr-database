caption: The TGF-β-mediated signaling function in epithelia including the seminiferous
  epithelium of adult rat testes. Based on recent studies in the field, TGF-βs are
  known to regulate different cellular functions in the testis following activation
  of their receptors via ligand-receptor binding, such as for cell cycle progression
  in germ cells, TJ dynamics, and α2-macroglobulin production, via ERK, p38 MAP or
  JNK (black arrows). This schematic diagram illustrates the significance of Cdc42
  in TGF-βs-mediated signaling function since this GTPase regulates not only the JNK
  signaling pathway downstream, also the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways via its cross
  talk with Ras and MEK1/2 (hatched arrows) or its direct effects on MEKK1–4 and MKK3/6
  (black arrows).
