caption: Metabolic pathways unique among metazoans and found in corals. The 2-aminoethylphosphonate
  (AEP) biosynthetic pathway was first discovered in Tetrahymena pyriformis. Phosphoenolpyruvate
  decarboxylase, shown in , is uncommon in metazoans. Homologs of the other two enzyme
  genes involved, indicated by asterisks, are also found in coral; see  for details.
