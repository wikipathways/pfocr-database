caption: 'Inhibition of atherosclerotic lesions by GA. Green arrows and red arrows
  indicate promotion and inhibition, respectively. Description: This figure illustrates
  how GA inhibits atherosclerotic lesions through multiple mechanisms. GA protects
  endothelial cells by increasing GSH levels and DNMT1 expression to reduce apoptosis,
  while improving mitochondrial function by inhibiting the ERK/CypD/NOX4 pathway.
  It also inhibits platelet activation and aggregation by suppressing thrombin activity,
  downregulating the PKC and p38/MAPK pathways, reducing Ca2⁺ influx, and decreasing
  P-selectin expression. Additionally, GA suppresses VSMC proliferation and migration
  by inhibiting the RhoA/CDC42 and PI3K-Akt-ERK1/2 pathways, while promoting VSMC
  apoptosis through the AMPK-eNOS-FAS pathway and mitigating oxidative stress caused
  by hydroxyl radicals (•OH). These effects collectively stabilize atherosclerotic
  plaques and prevent their progression. Green arrows indicate promotion, while red
  arrows represent inhibition'
