caption: The insulin signaling cascade branches into two main pathways. The PI3K/AKT
  pathway mediates insulin action on nutrient metabolism including glucose uptake.
  The Ras/MAPK pathway mediates insulin’s effect on gene expression, but also interacts
  with the PI3K-AKT pathway to control cell growth and differentiation. Activation
  of the insulin receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 thereby initiating
  signal transduction. Stimulation of the NFκB and AP-1 Fos/Jun inflammatory pathways
  results in the activation of the serine kinases, Ikkb and Jnk1, which reduce the
  signaling ability of IRS1. Additional inflammation-related negative regulators of
  IRS proteins include the Socs proteins and NO, which are induced in inflammation,
  and promote IRS degradation. NO also reduces PI3K/Akt activity by s-nitrosylation
  of Akt.
