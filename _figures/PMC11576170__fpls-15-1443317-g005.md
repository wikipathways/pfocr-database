caption: Response of hormone signaling pathways to cold stress. Cold stress increases
  the biosynthesis of plant hormones, including ABA, BR, JA, SA, ethylene and SL.
  These plant hormones further activate their signaling pathways to directly or indirectly
  regulate the CBF-COR cascade. In addition, some plant hormones (such as ABA, SA,
  SL and JA) contribute to ROS scavenging
