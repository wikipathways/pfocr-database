caption: Main signalling pathways of programmed necrosis in cardiomyocytes. Association
  of TNFR1 with the TNF trimer leads to the formation of complex I, consisting of
  TRADD, TRAF2, RIP1, CYLD and cIAP1/cIAP2, at the cytoplasmic membrane. K63‐linked
  polyubiquitination of RIP1 by cIAP1/cIAP2 leads to the recruitment of critical proteins
  and the activation of survival pathways. In the absence of cIAP1/cIAP2, RIP1, FADD
  and caspase‐8 form cytosolic complex IIa, which activates the caspase cascade and
  induces apoptosis. Under conditions in which caspase‐8 activity is inhibited genetically
  or pharmacologically (zVAD), RIP1 interacts with RIP3 and MLKL to form complex IIb,
  which is involved in the mediation of necroptosis. The kinase activity of RIP1 is
  essential for complex IIb action. RIP3 and MLKL are phosphorylated in complex IIb
  and translocate to the plasma membrane or to mitochondria‐associated membranes,
  where the complex mediates membrane permeabilization. Phosphorylated MLKL changes
  the permeability of the plasma membrane, resulting in ion exchange (Na+ and Ca2+)
  across the membrane. RIP1 and RIP3 undergo a complex set of phosphorylation events,
  and necrosis ensues through unclear mechanisms. One potential mechanism, as shown,
  may involve the activation of catabolic pathways and ROS production. A second necrotic
  pathway involves the mPTP in the IMM and its regulation by CypD. mPTP may be opened
  by increased Ca2+ concentration, oxidative stress, decreased ATP levels and other
  stimuli that occur during I/R and HF. Furthermore, mitochondrial protein kinases
  such as PKC‐1, Akt/HKII and GSK‐3β have been suggested to be recruited from the
  cytosol to mitochondria in response to the activation of GPCR receptors. As described
  in the text, mPTP opening results in profound alterations in mitochondrial structure
  and function; these changes result in decreased ATP levels and loss of ΔΨm. Furthermore,
  ischaemia leads to increased [Na+], which directly induces necrosis, and reperfusion
  leads to increased [Ca2+], which induces mPTP opening. No definitive connection
  between death receptors and mitochondrial necrosis pathways has been delineated.
  A possible connection is RIP3‐induced ROS generation (see text for details).

  description: Main signalling pathways of programmed necrosis in cardiomyocytes.
    Association of TNFR1 with the TNF trimer leads to the formation of complex I,

    K63‐linked polyubiquitination of RIP1 by cIAP1/cIAP2 leads to the recruitment
    of critical proteins and the activation of survival pathways. In the absence of
    cIAP1/cIAP2, RIP1, FADD and caspase‐8 form cytosolic complex IIa, which activates

    with RIP3 and MLKL to form complex IIb, which is involved in the mediation of
    necroptosis. The kinase activity of RIP1 is essential for complex IIb action.
    RIP3 and MLKL are phosphorylated in complex IIb and translocate to the plasma
    membrane or to mitochondria‐associated membranes, where the complex mediates membrane
    permeabilization. Phosphorylated MLKL changes the permeability of the plasma membrane,
