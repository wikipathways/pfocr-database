caption: Schematic representation of PRL signaling pathway after virus infection.
  After infecting host cells, the virus causes immune cells death and increase the
  expression of inflammatory factors, such as chemokines, interleukin, and interferon.
  Inflammatory factors stimulate the pituitary gland to increase PRL secretion. In
  addition, cells can increase PRL secretion by autocrine or paracrine pathways. Then
  PRL binds to the PRLR receptor on the cell membrane, and activates JAK/STAT, MAPK,
  and PI3K signaling pathways, thus regulating the individual immune response.
