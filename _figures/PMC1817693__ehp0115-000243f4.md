caption: 'MAPK pathway. Abbreviations: GPCR, G protein coupled receptors; GTPase,
  guanosine triphosphatases. MAPK are a family of serine–threonine protein kinases
  widely conserved among eukaryotes and are involved in many cellular programs such
  as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell movement, and cell death. MAPK
  signaling cascades are organized hierarchically into three-tiered modules. MAPKs
  (Erk) are phosphorylated and activated by MAPK-kinases (MAPKKs), (MEK1/2), which
  in turn are phosphorylated and activated by MAPKK-kinases (MAPKKKs), (Raf). The
  MAPKKKs are in turn activated by interaction with the family of small GTPases and/or
  other protein kinases (Ras, Rap1), connecting the MAPK module to cell surface receptors
  or external stimuli. An activated Erk dimer can regulate targets in the cytosol
  and also translocate to the nucleus where it phosphorylates a variety of transcription
  factors regulating gene expression.'
