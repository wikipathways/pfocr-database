caption: The Wg cleavage pathway. The diagram shows a model of known events during
  Wg signaling at the NMJ. Wg is secreted by the presynaptic motoneuron and it binds
  to postsynaptic DFz2 receptors. DFz2, perhaps still bound to Wg is internalized,
  and it is transported to the perinuclear area via an interaction between its C-terminal
  tail and the PDZ4-5 domains of dGRIP. dGRIP is present in trafficking intracellular
  vesicles that move along microtubules. Once DFz2 reaches the perinuclear area, the
  C-terminal tail is cleaved and imported into the muscle nuclei, where it is postulated
  to regulate the transcription of genes required for the differentiation of new synapses.
