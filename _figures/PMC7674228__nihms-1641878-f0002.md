caption: 'The heat stress and the sphingolipids dynamics in fungi and animals. (A)
  General effects of heat stress in the sphingolipids biosynthesis and cellular consequences
  of these effects in fungi. Heat stress in fungi induces the de novo sphingolipid
  biosynthesis, mediated by the regulatory module Pkh-Ypk-Orm. As a result, the levels
  of most sphingolipid species increase, except for MIPC. The behavior of GlcCer is
  not clear. Intermediates of the biosynthesis pathway perform several signaling functions
  that impact on different processes, such as cell cycle arrest, proteolysis, accumulation
  of the trehalose and regulation of translation. More details in the text. (B) Consequences
  of heat stress for the sphingolipids synthesis and other processes in animal and
  human cells. Heat stress in animal and human cells induces the synthesis of Cer
  and Sph through the de novo biosynthesis pathway and / or the sphingomyelinase pathway,
  depending on the cell type. As a consequence, cellular processes such as apoptosis
  and dephosphorylation of proteins that participate in the regulation of mRNA splicing
  are activated. In parallel, the expression and activation of HSPs are induced by
  heat shock and these proteins connect with many points in the sphingolipids biosynthesis
  pathway. Additionally, heat shock favors the activity of phospholipases, increasing
  the levels of lysophospholipids, which also seem to play a role in the response
  to heat shock mediated by HSPs and MAPKs. More details in the text. SLs: sphingolipids;
