caption: Regulatory scheme on the top of the eye developmental pathway. Twin of eyeless
  (toy), eyeless (ey), and possibly eyegone (eyg), three Pax genes, are master control
  genes on the top of the hierarchy. Sine oculis (so), eyes absent (eya), dachshund
  (dac), and optix are second-order transcription factors regulated by the master
  control genes. Note that the pathway is not linear but rather a network interconnected
  by feedback loops.
