caption: 'Simplified illustration of key players of the CS/CAS/KKS in COVID-19. The
  KKS is activated in COVID-19, and bradykinin generation may contribute to increased
  inflammation and vascular leakage, in particular in the lungs. ACE2 inactivates
  bradykinin metabolites, and hence its reduced activity after SARS-CoV-2 infection
  may contribute to increased KKS activity. Activation of CAS has been demonstrated
  in COVID-19 including factor XIIa and XIa leading to thromboinflammation and potentially
  thrombosis. Lastly, the CS interacts with both, the CS and KKS. MASP-1 of the lectin
  pathway of complement may mediate cleavage of kininogen, and MASP-2 is a weak activator
  of prothrombin. Abbreviations: ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; CAS, contact
  activation system; CS, complement system; HMWK, high-molecular weight kininogen;
  KKS, kallikrein-kinin system; MASP, mannose-binding lectin associated serine protease.'
