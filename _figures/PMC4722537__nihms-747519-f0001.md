caption: Shown is a summary of core, conserved molecular processes in SSc skin. This
  includes an inflammatory subnetwork that contains both interferon and M2 macrophage
  modules that interact via Ras-Rac signaling. ECM module appears to represent a transition
  state between inflammatory and fibroproliferative subnetworks and is connected to
  M2 macrophages via chemokine signaling and to proliferation module via TGF-β signaling.
  The proliferation module is connected to the M2 macrophage module via fatty acid
  signaling and to the interferon module via negative regulation by ERK/MAPK pathway.

  kinases, MAPK – mitogen-activated protein kinases.
