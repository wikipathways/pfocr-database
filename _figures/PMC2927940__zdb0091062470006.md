caption: Model depicting the possible mechanisms of β-cell failure to compensate for
  insulin resistance in HDR mice. In normal mice, an elevation of glucose leads to
  an increase in ATP/ADP ratio and intracellular Ca2+ and a decrease in fatty acid
  oxidation that allows long-chain-acyl-CoA (fatty acid-CoA) availability for glycerolipid/fatty
  acid (GL/FA) cycling, which produces lipid signaling molecules (LSMs), such as diacylglycerol,
  necessary for insulin secretion. Enhanced GL/FA cycling is an “on” signal for insulin
  secretion that contributes to the amplification arm of GSIS. Enhanced fat oxidation
  is an “off” signal for insulin secretion because it removes molecules from the cycle
  (). In HDR mice, to adapt to the elevation of circulating FFA and postprandial glucose
  and to prevent β-cell glucolipotoxicity and steatosis, fatty acid esterification
  processes and lipolysis are simultaneously decreased in association with enhanced
  FFA oxidation. The increase in fatty acid oxidation, in parallel to depleting LSM,
  reduces fatty acid-CoA availability for cholesterol ester (CE) synthesis, contributing
  with elevated blood cholesterol to free cholesterol accumulation and β-cell dysfunction
  with reduced secretion. Besides the amplification arm of GSIS, the classical triggering
  ATP/Ca2+pathway is also affected in HDR versus LDR mice due to reduced glucose-stimulated
  ATP production and a lack of compensatory increase in the rise in Ca2+ promoted
  by high glucose. GPR40 activation by FFA may contribute to maintain high level of
  secretion and hyperinsulinemia. However, in the absence of insufficient insulin
  secretion for the demand due to the marked insulin resistance, HDR mice become hyperglycemic.
  Black arrows indicate a difference between DIO group (LDR and HDR) and normal diet
  group. Striped arrows indicate a difference between HDR and LDR groups.
