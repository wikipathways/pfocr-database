caption: Network visualization with the central panel depicts a force‐directed gene‐gene
  network in 3D space. Graph clusters from OmicsNET reveal unique difference networks
  between the intersection of COVID‐19 disease‐type constructed networks and each
  type‐specific network with the genes shared by Spike. KEGG pathway analysis was
  performed for the multiomics layered network (mRNA, neighboring genes, OmicsNet).
  We revealed that the majority of the overrepresented biological processes following
  SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were regulated by the Toll‐like receptor signaling, inflammasome
  activation, intrinsic coagulation pathway, and signaling by Interleukins. COVID‐19‐induced
  cytokine storm leads to systemic complications and multiorgan damage (see Figure  and
  Table , Supporting Information). Blue/gray main nodes and blue neighbor nodes show
  gene involved in blood coagulation signaling pathways.
