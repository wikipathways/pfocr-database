caption: Inactivation of the Hippo pathway induces breast cancer metastasis. The factors
  labeled in red are examples of proteins that inactivates the Hippo pathway and induces
  metastasis. PAR1 activation and the kinase MARK4 destabilize the core complex and
  inhibits its activity. MARK4 can increase nuclear YAP and TAZ too. The activation
  of HER3 by ROB1 leads to the assembly of a complex between MAYA ncLRNA, LLGL2 and
  the methyl transferase NSUN6 that methylates and inactivates MST1. Abl kinases can
  also increase nuclear TAZ. Finally, TAZ and HIF1 and reciprocally act as transcription
  co activators for each other. The only Hippo pathway activator shown here is SKI
  which binds LATS2 and MST1 and strengthen the core complex.
