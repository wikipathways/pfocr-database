caption: 'Possible scenarios for coupling between Stim1 and Orai1 in SOC activation.
  a Activation of membrane receptors causes IP3-mediated store depletion followed
  by Stim1 reorganization into puncta. The decrease in luminal ER Ca2+ causes dissociation
  of bound Ca2+ from the low affinity EF-hand in the N-terminus of Stim1. This Ca2+
  dissociation causes Stim1 molecules to aggregate (puncta formation) and to diffuse
  into regions of ER in close proximity with the plasma membrane (PM) within 10–25
  nm. b Stim1 oligomers then interact functionally with Orai1 channels in the PM.
  Three coupling models are proposed: (i) a model involving direct protein–protein
  interaction between the C-terminal domain of Stim1 in the ER and the C-terminal
  region of Orai1 in the PM. (ii) An alternative physical coupling model in which
  the Stim1–Orai1 interaction is mediated via accessory membrane and/or cytoplasmic
  proteins, either constitutively present or recruited to the tight spaces of ER–PM
  junctions upon store depletion. (iii) A coupling model involving a diffusible calcium
  influx factor (CIF) produced or released within the ER–PM junctions to activate
  Orai1'
