caption: 'Proposed model of the molecular and cellular responses to the new CLA derivatives.
  Action of cladribine in leukemia cells: transport of 2-CdA to the cell and the mechanisms
  underlying the cellular response to genotoxic stress induced by new CLA analogs.
  DNA strand breaks lead to the activation of the DNA damage response pathway. DNA
  damage, ssDNA and dsDNA, are recognized by ATR. The consequence of this process
  is the formation of large clusters of proteins within the DNA damage necessary to
  activate effector proteins. P53 lead to cell arrest in the cycle and consequently
  to damage repair or apoptosis.'
