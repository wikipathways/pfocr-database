caption: Establishment of type 2 inflammation in ECRS. Innate response to exogeneous
  proteases from allergens, such as pollen, mite, fungi, and microorganisms, can induce
  the epithelial-derived cytokines IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP, which drive the activation
  of ILC2s to release type 2 cytokines in an antigen-independent manner. An imbalance
  between allergen proteases and EPIs might play a role in the initiation and exacerbation
  of type 2 inflammation in ECRS. Intraepithelial mast cells, showing a tryptase+,
  chymase− phenotype (MC-T), enhance type 2 inflammation. Cystatin SN enhances TSLP
  expression, and that stimulation with TSLP or IL-33 increased cystatin SN expression
  in nasal epithelial cells. Cystatin SN plays a role in eosinophilic inflammation
  in ECRS through inducing CCL11 and periostin expression in NPs fibroblast. Downregulation
  of the tPA/LRP-1 pathway reduces NO production. NO contributes to the local host
  defense through regulation of ciliary motility. mDC, Myeloid dendritic cell.
