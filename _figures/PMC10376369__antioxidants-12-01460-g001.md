caption: Amyloid β and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease. The main hallmarks of
  an AD brain are the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β senile plates (1), the
  accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau (2) and neuronal death
  (3). The areas in which these three features coexist are called neuritic plates
  (4). Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing can take place through the amyloidogenic
  pathway (A), being cleaved by β-secretase (BACE), generating the sAPPβ and CTFβ
  fragments. The latter is subsequently processed by γ-secretase, generating Aβ42
  and Aβ40, which induce amyloid β pathology in an AD brain (5) that ultimately affects
  neuronal homeostasis and induces cell death (6). On the contrary, in the non-amyloidogenic
  pathway (B), APP is cleaved by α- and γ-secretases, generating CTFα and sAPPα fragments
  that exert a neuroprotective function because a diminished APP conversion to Aβ
  and sAPPα inhibits BACE (7). On the other hand, tau is a microtubule-associated
  protein that establishes their structure. Post-translational modifications of tau,
  including phosphorylation, induce the detachment of tau and microtubule destabilization
  (8) and lead to tau aggregation (9). The accumulation of tau protein causes a failure
  of neuronal homeostasis whose final consequence is neuronal death (10).
