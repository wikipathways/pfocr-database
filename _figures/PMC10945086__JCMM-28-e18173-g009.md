caption: Schematic illustration of Bilirubin alleviating pathological and physiological
  progression of OA by relieving oxidative stress and reducing inflammation. Bilirubin
  has the ability to reduce oxidative stress by not only directly depleting radicals
  but also activating the Nrf2 pathway, as well we to decrease inflammation by suppressing
  NF‐κB pathway
