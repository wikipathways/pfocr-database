caption: Cytoprotective effect of H2S. H2S protects embryonic neurons from oxidative
  stress induced by high concentrations of glutamate. H2S enhances the activity of
  the cystine/glutamate antiporter and the cysteine transporter to increase the intracellular
  concentrations of cysteine. H2S also enhances the activity of glutamate cysteine
  lygase (GCL) to produce γ–glutamylcysteine to which glycine is added by glutathione
  synthetase (GC) to generate glutathione (GSH). H2S produced via the 3-mercaptopyruvate
  sulfurtransferase (3MST)/(CAT) pathway scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  which are abundantly generated in mitochondria. The intracellular concentrations
  of GSH are 1–10 mM, while those of H2S are only 10 nM to 3 µM. H2S efficiently suppresses
  oxidative stress by increasing the production of GSH rather than by scavenging ROS.
