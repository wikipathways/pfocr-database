caption: The ascites fluid is composed of cellular and non-cellular components that
  contribute to the progression of EOC. (A) Macrophages are recruited to the peritoneal
  cavity by IL-8, found at high levels in ascites fluid, and POSTN, released by EOC
  cells. (B) Increased vascular permeability contributes to the accumulation of fluid
  within the peritoneal cavity. ROS released by macrophages decreases VCAM1 and VLA4,
  leading to increased permeability. VEGF, released by HGSOC cells, also contributes
  to increased permeability by decreasing the junctional protein Claudin-5 between
  endothelial cells. (C) EOC spheroids floating in ascites release POSTN and mucins,
  involved in macrophage recruitment, and miRNA-containing exosomes that polarize
  macrophages towards a TAM phenotype. TAMs then release TGF-β which activates further
  POSTN release and the JAK/STAT3 pathway in HGSOC cells, involved in increasing invasion
  capabilities through MMP-9 activation. TAMs also release TNF-α which activates the
  NF-κB pathway, involved in increasing the survival, proliferation, migration, and
  invasion of EOC cells. (D) CA125 on the surface of EOC cells plays a role in the
  adhesion of cancer cells to the mesothelium by binding to mesothelin on the surface
  of mesothelial cells. CA125 is also found in a soluble form in ascites fluid and
  increases the expression of MT1-MMP on mesothelial cells, leading to increased invasion
  of EOC cells. (E) TAMs play a role in suppressing the immune system in ascites fluid.
  Pro-inflammatory cytokines in ascites upregulate B7H4 receptor on TAMs. B7H4 binds
  to T cells and decreases their proliferation. TAMs also release CCL22, that recruit
  Tregs, and miRNA containing exosomes, that activate Tregs. Created with BioRender.com.
