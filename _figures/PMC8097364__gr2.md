caption: DNA damage repair pathways. (A) Fanconi Anemia pathway described from various
  studies in somatic cells and Xenopus extracts. Stalled replication forks activate
  ATR mediated checkpoint response, which recruits the FA core complex, which monoubiquitinates
  the FANCI/FANCD2 complex. The FANCI/D2 complex with SLX4 promotes the nucleolytic
  initiation, interstand unhooking and double strand break formation. DNA replication
  is resumed by translesion synthesis polymerases. The double strand break end initiates
  resection and repair via homologous recombination . (B) Homologous recombination-meiotic
  recombination is initiated by SPO11-induced double strand breaks. Invasion structures
  are based on findings in budding yeast (see text). ZMM-complex of meiosis-specific
  proteins that are conserved and promotes double Holliday junction formation and
  their biased resolution into crossovers , . Invasion structures are unwound/disassembled
  by BLM and SMC5/6 and can re-populate the meiotic recombination pathway (crossover
  or synthesis-dependent single strand annealing for noncrossovers-not shown). Invasion
  structures that are not disassembled can be resolved by structure-specific endonucleases,
  yielding both crossovers and noncrossovers . (C) The Base excision pathway is required
  by murine primordial germ cells  and the pronucleus of embryos  to undergo demethylation,
  which is essential for gametogenesis. TET enzymes oxidize 5mC to 5HmC, which is
  oxidized. TDP glycosylase removes the oxidized base creating a single strand break
  recognized by XRCC1 and PARP1 that facilitate DNA demethylation and chromatin remodeling.
  (D) Non-homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ) - Double strand break ends are recognized
  and processed by Ku70/80 heterodimer, DNA-PKCs and other enzymes. The ends are ligated
  by DNA ligase IV/XRCC4/XLF . (E) Microhomology mediated end joining pathway (MMEJ)
  uses short homologous sequences (shown in yellow) to align the broken ends. FEN1
  mediates flap trimming and the ends are ligated by XRCC1/DNA Ligase III . End joining
  pathways are preferred double strand repair mechanisms in preimplantation embryos
  , , . List of abbreviations - BER-base excision repair; NHEJ-nonhomologous end joining;
  MMEJ-microhomology mediated end joining; HR-homologous recombination. (For interpretation
