caption: Proposed bi-phasic model for the role of Egr-1 in activation of DCs and down-modulation
  of DC maturation upon challenge with T. gondii. (A) Immediate-early phase. Similar
  to LPS, parasite antigens contained in lysate, or heat-inactivated parasites activate
  TLRs that signal through the adaptor MyD88 and the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway
  to induce rapid Egr-1 expression. MyD88-deficient DCs exhibit a strongly delayed
  Egr-1 response and MEK1/2 inhibition abolishes Egr-1 activation, with a minor contribution
  of the p38 MAPK pathway. Rapid high Egr-1 expression is consistent with cell activation
  and migration. The migratory responses of T. gondii-challenged DCs are abolished
  by inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling. (B) Extended phase. In actively invaded DCs,
  intracellular T. gondii tachyzoites replicate in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV)
  and secrete in the host DC cytosol the p38-interacting protein GRA24, leading to
  p38 phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 phosphorylation or challenge
  with GRA24-deficient T. gondii abolish a sustained Egr-1 response. Sustained Egr-1
  expression leads to a down-modulation of DC maturation. In Egr-1-silenced DCs maturation
  is elevated upon LPS or T. gondii challenge. For (A,B), vivid colored items indicate
  the predominantly active signaling pathway and gray-colored items indicate the less
  active signaling pathway.
