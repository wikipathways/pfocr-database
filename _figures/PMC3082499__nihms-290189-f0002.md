caption: Mediators of the extrinsic pathway of PCD by Fas and TNFR-1 signaling. (a)
  The protein domain structures of Fas and TNFR-1. Each receptor has cysteine-rich
  domains (CRD) in the ligand binding region, characteristic of members of the TNF
  superfamily of receptors. There is a death domain in the intracellular portion of
  each receptor. (b) Fas death signaling patheways. (c) TNFR-1 signaling pathways.
  See text for details.
