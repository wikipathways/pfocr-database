caption: Experimental design. PAH rat models are established by single abdominal subcutaneous
  injection of MCT (60 mg/kg) on day 0. Subsequently, these rats of luteolin group
  were also was intragastrically given luteolin at 100 mg/kg/day, suspended in 0.5%
  carboxymethyl cellulose sodium from days 15–28. The same volume of 0.5% carboxymethyl
  cellulose sodium was given to the control and MCT-exposed groups from days 15–28.
  At the end, various experimental methods were used to evaluated the effects of luteolin.
  MCT, monocrotaline.
