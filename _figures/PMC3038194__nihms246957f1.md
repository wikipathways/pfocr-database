caption: Heterodimers of HER2/ErbB-2 and either EGFR/ErbB-1 or the kinase-defective
  ErbB-3/HER3 (note the letter X that symbolizes a defective cytoplasm-facing kinase
  domain) are shown, along with the growth factor ligands they bind. All ligands share
  an epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif of 50–60 amino acids. They include, in addition
  to EGF, epiregulin (EPG), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), heparin-binding
  epidermal growth factor-like factor (HB-EGF), amphiregulin (AR), epiregulin (EPR)
  and betacellulin. Another group includes 4 classes of neuregulins (NRGs). Note that
  HER2 is unable to bind a ligand. Nevertheless, HER2 takes part in signaling via
  its own constitutive phosphorylation, as well as by trans-activation of its heterodimerization
  partners. Tyrosine phsphorylated receptors are coupled to several biochemical cascades,
  including the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and the extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), which belongs to the MAPK family. Activation of ERK/MAPK is mediated
  via the RAS- RAF-MEK pathway and leads to cellular proliferation via the activation
  of a number of nuclear targets, including the AP1 (FOS and JUN) complex, MYC, which
  regulates cell cycle progression, and ELK1, a member of the ETS family of transcription
  factors. SHC and GRB2 are adaptor proteins sharing the ability to bind each other,
  as well as tyrosine phosphorylated receptors. The EGFR/HER2 heterodimer also couples
  to phospholipase C (PLC) and the downstream protein kinase C. On the other hand,
  ErbB-3/HER3-containing heterodimers strongly activate another kinase, AKT, via a
  lipid kinase, PI3K, leading to activation of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin).
  Activation of AKT blocks signaling via BAD, a BH3-only protein, which contributes
  to tissue homeostasis by regulating initiation of apoptosis. Activation of AKT inhibits
  FKHR and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP. The forkhead box O1 (FKHR,
  FOXO1) transcription factor is a member of the FOXO family of transcription factors,
  involved in tumor suppression and cell death.
