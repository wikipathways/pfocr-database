caption: Schematic illustration of obese WATME. Obesity induces cellular stress, leading
  to the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by hypertrophic adipocytes. Prolonged
  cellular stress ultimately leads to the death of these cells, triggering the recruitment
  of immune cells surrounding the dead adipocytes, thereby resulting in the formation
  of crown-like structure (CLS). Moreover, the secretion of free fatty acids (FFA)
  and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by these adipocytes initiate the
  activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. The activation of the NF-κB
  downstream signaling pathway leads to the infiltration and stimulation of immune
  cells to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. These alterations in the cellular composition,
  secretory profile, and inflammatory state of WAT result in obese WATME
