caption: 'NETosis in neutrophils. (Suicidal NETosis). Step 1: Activation of PKC-α:
  Various agents such as PMA directly stimulate PKC-α. Additionally, increased intracellular
  Ca2⁺ due to antibodies and the calcium ionophore A23187 elevate intracellular calcium
  levels, subsequently activating PKC-α. FGFR activation triggers PLC-γ, producing
  DAG to enhance PKC-α activity. Step 2: Cascade of Biochemical Reactions: PKC-α initiates
  the RAF kinase/threonine protein kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (RAF/MEK/ERK) signaling pathway, which then stimulates NOX,
  leading to ROS production. Step 3: ROS-Mediated Dissociation and Granule Release:
  Elevated ROS levels cause the oxidative dissociation of Trx from TXNIP, releasing
  Trx. Furthermore, ROS facilitates the release of azurophilic granules containing
  MPO, elastase, and cathepsin, which are crucial for the nuclear processes involved
  in suicidal NETosis. Step 4: Activation of PAD4: Increased intracellular calcium,
  due to the calcium ionophore A23187 and antibodies, can directly activate PAD4.
  Furthermore, freed Trx offers an alternative activation route for PAD4, distinctively
  without utilizing its oxidoreductive function. Step 5: Inflammatory Signaling Loop:
  CXCR activation by IL-8 initiates the PI3K/PKB pathway, promoting downstream signaling
  that activates NF-κB. NF-κB activation, stimulated by the PI3K/PKB pathway and TXNIP
  after dissociation from TRX, enhances iNOS production. This is essential for NO
  generation, which exacerbates inflammation and reinforces the suicidal NETosis feedback
  loop. Step 6: Histone Citrullination and NET Formation: PAD4 converts arginine to
  citrulline in histones, leading to histone citrullination and promoting NET formation,
  essential for both types of NETosis. (Vital NETosis). Step 1: Bacterial Induction
  and Calcium Elevation Pathway: Bacteria like E. coli and S. aureus, or bacterial-specific
  molecular patterns recognized by PRRs, induce vital NETosis. Activation of receptors
  such as TLR-2, TLR-4, and CR raises intracellular Ca2⁺ levels, facilitating PAD4
  activation. Step 2: Activation of PAD4 and Histone Modification: similar to suicidal
  NETosis, elevated Ca2⁺ levels activate PAD4, which then mediates histone citrullination.
  Step 3: Histone Decondensation and NET Release: histone citrullination causes decondensation,
  and in vital NETosis, NETs are released from vesicles without causing membrane rupture
  or neutrophil death. (NETosis: neutrophil extracellular trap formation; PKC-α: protein
