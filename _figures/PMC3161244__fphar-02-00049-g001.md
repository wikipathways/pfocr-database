caption: 'Allosteric regulations of glycolysis confer metabolic plasticity with respect
  to local pO2. Enzymes are represented in italicized blue font and their substrates
  in bold black. Because the glycolytic flux is nominally faster than OXPHOS, the
  Pasteur Effect has been evolutionary selected to couple both metabolic rates. The
  energy metabolites glucose-6-P, ATP, and citrate restrain the glycolytic flux through
  allosteric inhibition of key glycolytic enzymes, as represented by the red arrows.
  Inhibition is at its climax when oxygen is not a limiting substrate for OXPHOS,
  thus allowing the full oxidation of glucose. When oxygen levels are limited or when
  the pO2 fluctuates, full glucose oxidation, and consequently the levels of ATP and
  citrate produced oxidatively are decreased. The Pasteur Effect is reset to less
  pronounced inhibition, thus allowing accelerated glycolysis to compensate for defective
  ATP production. An extreme situation characterized by full inhibition of the Pasteur
  Effect is met under severe hypoxia. The energetic crisis is associated with an increase
  in the cellular levels of fructose-1,6-bisP, ADP, AMP, and inorganic phosphate (Pi).
  These molecules exert a series of allosteric stimulations (represented by the green
  arrows) that accelerate the glycolytic flux. Glycolysis thus becomes the main source
  of cellular ATP production, a rescue situation allowing short-term cell survival
  until the pO2 is restored. Other abbreviations: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; P, phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid (cycle).'
