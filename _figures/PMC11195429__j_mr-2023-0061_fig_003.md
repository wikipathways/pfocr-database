caption: Antitumor therapies awake the cGAS-STING signaling to accelerate the antitumor
  immunity. Features of the tumor microenvironment like chromatin instability and
  growth stress can cause cytoplasmic or extracellular accumulation of dsDNA to activate
  the cGAS-STING pathway. Similarly, anti-tumor therapies such as radiotherapy and
  chemotherapy can also cause accumulation of genomic or mitochondria-derived dsDNA
  in the cytosol. Tumor-derived cGAMP can also secrete into the TME, and enter immune
  cells via the folate transporter SLC19A1. However, DNA damage recruits the cGAS
  translocating to nuclear and inhibits the homologous recombination by interfering
  the PARP1-timeless complex formation. On the other hand, antitumor therapies also
  upregulate negative regulators of cGAS-STING, as CASP9 signaling, to suppress the
  activation of the intrinsic cGAS-STING pathway. Therefore, targeting such negative
  regulators or delivery of STIGN agonists could specifically activate the cGAS-STING
  signaling in the TME. This will help to upregulate the expression of Th1 chemokines
  (CXCL9 and CXCL10) and antigen presenting molecules (MHCI), recruit CD8+T cells,
  and activate innate immune cells. However, the increase of IFN secretion may also
  enhance the infiltration of MDSC and upregulate PD-L1 and other immunosuppressive
  factors to exert an inhibitory effect. dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; cGAS, GMP-AMP
  synthase; SITNG, stimulator of interferon genes; cGAMP, cyclic GMP-AMP; CASP, caspase;
  TME, tumor microenvironment; MDSC, monocyte-derived suppressor cells
