caption: Wnt/catenin signalling and inhibition by sclerostin. Activation of the LRP5/6
  receptor by Wnt ligands reduces β-catenin phosphorylation. This actions enables
  β-catenin translocation into the nucleus, where it displaces repressors, activates
  the transcription TCF/LEF complex and initiates pro-osteogenic gene transcription
  (including Cbfa-1β) [], which stimulate osteoblast differentiation. (B) Inhibition
  of this signalling pathway is elicited by sclerostin via the LRP4 receptor, which
  “sequesters” this osteocytic protein to facilitate interaction with LRP5/6 and prevent
  its activation by Wnt ligands. When inhibited, β-catenin phosphorylates and degrades
  in the proteosome via ubiquitination, thereby preventing gene transcription. Designed
