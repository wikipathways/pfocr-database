caption: Intracellular signaling involved in cardioprotective response stimulated
  by ischemic preconditioning (PreC) in cardiac cells. This figure illustrates that
  PreC activates cellular survival pathways mediated by PI3K/Akt and increases cytosolic
  levels of NO in cardiac cells. NO activates intracellular signaling pathway mediated
  by GC/cGMP/PKG and stimulates the opening of mKATP by decreasing mitochondrial Ca2+
  overload. These cellular responses attenuate cytosolic Ca2+ overload, reduce the
  formation of free radicals, prolonged opening of MPTP channels, and increase ATP
  production, attenuating excitation-contraction decoupling, and thus reducing the
  incidence of severe arrhythmias and cellular death. The arrows represent activation
  signal and “T” bars represent inhibition signal.
