caption: Effects of hypoxic training on glucose and lipid metabolism. Changes of metabolites
  in response to hypoxic training in mice (A). Data are shown as mean ± SEM, n = 8,
  *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. (B) Summary of metabolic pathways associated with hypoxia
  training intervention. The italic metabolite represents the undetected metabolite,
  and the red font is the significantly increased metabolite of Group D vs. Group
  A. The pink box is glucose metabolism pathway, and the yellow box is lipid metabolism
  pathway.
