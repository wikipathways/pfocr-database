caption: Small-molecule compounds targeting pyroptosis pathways in cancer. There are
  two main pathways and two other pathways that exert antitumor activity by targeting
  pyroptosis. Pyroptosis pathway can be divided into classical pyroptosis pathway
  and non-classical pyroptosis pathway. The activation of classical pyroptosis pathway
  is initiated by PAMPs or damps. After NLRs or ALRs recognize specific stimuli, they
  start to assemble to form inflammatory bodies and process to form activated caspase-1.
  Caspase-1 cuts GSDMD, and the N-terminal of GSDMD is located and aggregated on the
  cell membrane to form pores. In addition, caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  to form mature IL-1β and IL-18, and the intracellular contents are secreted outside
  the membrane through the membrane pore. The nonclassical focal death pathway depends
  on the activation of caspase-4/Caspase-5/caspase-11. After stimulated by LPS in
  the cytoplasm, caspase-4/Caspase-5/caspase11 can directly bind to the conserved
  structure lipid A of LPS, cause oligomerization and activation, further cut GSDMD,
  cause the N-terminal of GSDMD to disintegrate and locate in the cell membrane to
  form membrane pores. In caspase-3-dependent cell death, GSDME is the reaction substrate
  of Caspase-3. GSDME can be cleaved by activated caspase-3 to generate its N-terminal
  fragment, which performs pyroptosis by penetrating the plasma membrane. Granzyme
  B can also participate in NK cell induced pyroptosis by cleaving GSDME. In addition,
  TNF-γ acts on TNFR, activates the N-terminal cleavage of GSDMC mediated by caspase-8,
  locates in the cell membrane, forms membrane pores, and finally induces pyroptosis.
  IFN-γ by acting on ifngr, causes the N-terminal of GSDMB to cleave and locate to
  the cell membrane to form membrane pores and induce pyroptosis. Granzyme A can also
  induce pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMB
