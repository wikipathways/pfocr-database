caption: 'Schematic depiction of pain transduction (left panel) and analgesic mechanism
  of action of opioids on the pain pathway (right panel). (Left panel) Pain pathway:
  Following activation of nociceptors, 1) signal transduction in pre-synaptic neurons
  results in activation of adenylyl cyclase and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated
  release of neurotransmitters (glutamate, substance P, calcitonin gene-related protein
  [CGRP]) into the synaptic cleft; 2) released neurotransmitters bind to specific
  post-synaptic receptors: glutamate to the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, substance P to the neurokinin-1
  (NK-1) receptor, and CGRPs to the CGRP receptors (CGRP-R); 3) Activation of AMCP
  and NMDA receptors leads to an increase in the flow of positively-charged ions such
  as Ca2+ and Na2+ and increase in pain signal; another positive ion, Mg2+, is mobilized
  following NK-1 receptor binding-mediated protein kinase C activation and acts indirectly
  by unblocking NMDA receptors; 4) Substance P also mediates an increase in the influx
  of Ca2+ into the presynaptic neuron, contributing to increased neurotransmitter
  release and signaling; 5) Although the mechanism is not completely clear, activation
  of CGRP-R(s) is also believed to contribute to neuromodulation in the periphery
  similar to its involvement in migraine headache pathophysiology. (Right panel) Opioid
  Analgesic Action: Four subtypes of opioid receptors are present on both pre- and
  post-synaptic neurons: mu (µ) opioid receptor (mOR), kappa (κ) opioid receptor (kOR),
  delta (δ) opioid receptor (dOR), and nociception-related G protein-coupled receptor
  (non-naloxone-binding; not shown in figure). 1) Both endogenous and exogenous opioids
  bind to the mOR, resulting in a series of actions that inhibit pain signaling; 2)
  Activation of mOR results in an inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, leading to an inhibition
  of cAMP release and subsequent inhibition of neurotransmitters; 3) mOR binding also
  inhibits voltage-gated Ca2* channels and influx of positive ions into the pre-synaptic
  neuron, contributing to an inhibition of neurotransmitter release; 4) Finally, binding
  of opioids to the mOR on the post-synaptic neuron results in an opening of G protein-gated
  K+ channels, facilitating efflux of K+ ions and hyperpolarization leading to decreased
  sensitization to pain signaling.'
