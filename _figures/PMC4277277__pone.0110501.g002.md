caption: 'Moderate alcohol consumption decreased expression of 15 genes throughout
  the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Blue circles denote genes with a fold change
  greater than −1.3, while green denote those less than −1.3. All enzymes (orange
  arrowheads) produced from these genes catalyzed (green arrows labeled Z) their respective
  chemical reactions (grey boxes) on their target compounds (purple hexagons). The
  first compound, Acetyl-CoA, and the last compound, Cholesterol, are denoted by black
  circles (top and bottom of figure, respectively). The figure also displays the cellular
  localization of the enzymes: the entire figure is found in the cytoplasm, pink ovals
  represent peroxisomes (e.g. IDI1), blue ovals are lysosomes (e.g. LSS), and pink
  stacks represent endoplasmic reticulum (e.g. FDFT1). Srebf1 and Srebf2, transcription
  factors that activate many of these genes, were both down-regulated (not displayed).
  Nine of these results were confirmed by qRT-PCR (). Image modified from Thomson
  Reuter''s MetaCore.'
