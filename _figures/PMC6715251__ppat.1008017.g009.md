caption: 'The following model integrates published data and results of this study
  (highlighted with blue and red numbers respectively). Step 1: HAdV-C2 internalization
  is mediated by sequential binding to host cell proteins CAR (coxsackie/adenovirus
  receptor) and αV integrins [,]. Step 2: The interaction between HAdV-C2 and αV integrins
  activates a PI3K/Akt signaling pathway contributing to NFκB-dependent cytokine expression
  through phosphorylation and consequent degradation of IκB inhibitory protein [,].
  Step 3: Similar to other cell stresses, capsid escape to cytosol activates a p38-MAPK/MK2
  signaling cascade []. Step 4: Adenovirus exposure induces phosphorylation of EGFR
  residues Ser1046/1047, which are known p38-MAPK/MK2 substrates required for stress-induced
  internalization from clathrin-coated pits []. Step 5: Stress-internalized EGFRs
  are sorted to ILVs with the capacity to back-fuse with MVB limiting membranes under
  regulation of Hrs, Tsg101, and Alix. Step 6: Adenovirus cell entry activates an
  EGFR signaling pathway leading to phosphorylation of the Thr254-Pro motif in NFκB-p65.
  Step 7: Stress-induced EGFR signaling is associated with accumulation of nuclear
  NFκB-p65 protein and enhanced NFκB gene transcription. Step 8: PhosphoThr254-Pro
  is a known substrate for Pin1, which attenuates negative feedback control of NFκB
  activity by preventing IκB rebinding and nuclear exit []. Step 9: RIDα-C2 attenuates
  stress-induced EGFR signaling from MVB limiting membranes through an interaction
  with Alix 3 to 4 hours post-infection. Step 10: The interaction between RIDα-C2
  and RILP induces lysosome-mediated EGFR degradation without affecting autophagy,
  in the absence of functional Rab7.'
