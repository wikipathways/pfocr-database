caption: Annotated glutathione metabolism pathway with associated metabolite ion images
  by IR-MALDESI. Ion images are separated by disease classification respectively with
  orange, green, and pink boxes (sALS, control, C9Pos). Metabolomic conversions are
  indicated by arrows with white and/or purple circles based on protein detection.
  The number of circles with each arrow are indicative of the number of proteins involved
  in metabolite conversion as reported by KEGG database.
