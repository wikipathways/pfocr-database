caption: 'Central metabolic pathways of L. hongkongensis HLHK9 deduced from its genome
  sequence. The intermediary metabolic steps of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, gluconeogensis,
  glyoxylate cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism
  are shown. The function predictions were based on sequence similarity to proteins
  with experimentally verified functions. Individual pathways are shaded as indicated:
  yellow for gluconeogenesis, green for TCA cycle, and blue for pentose phosphate
  pathway. Arrows indicate the flow of intermediates.'
