caption: Overview of the roles and regulation of Rab1 and how it may be affected in
  PD. Activity and association with membranes of Rab1 are regulated by TRAPPIII (a
  guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GEF), TBC1D120 (a GTPase-activating protein,
  GAP), PRA1 (a GDI displacement factor, GDF), and αGDI (a GDP dissociation inhibitor,
  GDI). This activity is also regulated by the PD-related protein LRRK2. Rab1 regulates
  the early steps of the secretory pathway and autophagy through many effectors (see
  the full text for details). In addition, it regulates Hrr25, a member of the casein
  kinase 1 family, which also regulates these pathways. The expression of mutant forms
  of α-synuclein or overexpression of the wild type impair the secretory pathway,
  resulting in the activation of the UPR, the fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon, and
  the failure of the lysosomal route. These PD-associated alterations also affect
  autophagy. PD-related mutants of LRRK2 may enhance the activity of this GTPase,
  impairing secretory and autophagy pathways. Unbalanced secretory/autophagic/endolysosomal
  routes may lead to the formation of Lewy bodies.
