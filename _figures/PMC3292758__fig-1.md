caption: 'Overview of agent classes and functions in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)
  agent-based model (ABM) and schematic for Hill equations. (A) Interactions between
  states of the three cell types represented in the NEC ABM: Neonatal gut epithelial
  cells (NGECs), goblet cells, and abstracted bacteria. Intracellular pathways of
  NGECs are displayed in detail and color-coded according to function: Cellular metabolism
  (yellow), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and management (green), senescence
  and apoptosis (orange), nuclear factor kappa-beta (NF)-κB (blue), tight junction
  (TJ) metabolism (gray), Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 (violet), tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF)-α (red), nitric oxide (pink), and necrosis (black). Goblet cells include all
  these pathways (represented abstractly as block labels) plus the ability to produce
  mucus. Abstracted bacteria have movement rules, release pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs), and can adhere to NGECs with impaired TJs if there is no mucus
  intervening. Detailed descriptions of the agent rules and interactions can be found
  in . (B) How NGEC metabolism and oxidative stress (OS) management are modeled with
  Hill equations. Each NGEC incorporates the following pathway for ROS management,
  with a unique Hill equation used to represent each part of the pathway. The replenishment
  rate for nutrients (nutrient inflow) in the system was adjusted on scale by a variable
  in its Hill equation. Hill equations for ROS and ROS clearance interact to produce
  a final, overall metabolic ROS value. The interactions between the Hill equations
  represent the control architecture of management of baseline metabolic OS. For details
  on the specific Hill equations, see . Abbreviations: DAMPs=damage-associated molecular
  patterns; IκB=NF-κB inhibitor; RIP=receptor-interacting protein kinase.'
