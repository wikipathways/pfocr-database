caption: 'BCAAs metabolic cycle and related signaling pathways. BCAAs enter the cell
  via transporters and are metabolized by BCAT1 or BCAT2, generating branched-chain
  keto acids (BCKAs). These BCKAs are then processed by the BCKDH complex, which consists
  of three subunits: E1, E2, and E3. The catalytic efficiency of BCKDH depends on
  its phosphorylation status, regulated by BCKDK and PPM1K. BCKDK phosphorylates E1α
  to inhibit BCKDH, while PPM1K dephosphorylates the same site to activate BCKDH.
  Ultimately, acetyl-CoA is produced, entering the TCA cycle. Metabolites generated
  during this process may be associated with tumor development, immune evasion, therapeutic
  resistance, and the tumor microenvironment'
