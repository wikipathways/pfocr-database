caption: 'Common binding sites in cooperating genes suggest miR-622 to function as
  a superior pathway regulator in HCC. (A) In silico screening strategy for identification
  of further drug resistance and/or stemness related target genes of miR-622 in HCC.
  Potential novel miR-622 targets were predicted applying miR-target interaction databases
  ("miRTarBase 2020"; "miRDB"; "TargetScan"; "miRNAMAP 2.0), "string" pathway analysis,
  and comprehensive literature search applying Medline/PubMed (key terms: "cancer",
  "stemness", "drug resistance", "liver cancer", "hepatocellular carcinoma" and "microRNA").
  (B) Hypothesis of potential regulation of both LIN28A and ZCCHC11 by miR-622 in
  HCC. Binding of let-7 precursors (pre-let-7) by LIN28A and subsequent oligouridylation
  by its cooperating partner ZCCHC11 was described to induce depletion of let-7-miRNA
