caption: Increased rate of DNA double strands breaks due to deficiency in HR might
  evolve with molecular events that lead to challenges in restoring immune responses
  through immune checkpoint inhibitors. (1) DNA double-strand breaks association with
  CNV and large structural genetic alterations contribute to an increased flux of
  unstable mRNA and, ultimately, proteins that may saturate critical chaperones and
  the proteasome complex, thus leading to a dysfunctional tumor antigen presentation.
  (2) ATM plays a central role in recognizing DNA strand breaks but can also upregulate
  glycolysis and PPP to replenish nucleotides and NADPH supply for the upcoming anabolic
  reactions to restore DNA damages. This metabolic regulation might deprive glucose
  in the tumor microenvironment and export acid lactic, impacting immune responses.
  (3) CHK1 is crucial to repair strands breaks but may also activate the STAT1-STAT3-IRF1
  signaling pathway that contributes to upregulating PD-L1 expression. (4) Cytosolic
  DNA censoring can lead to STING-IRF3 production of IFN-I, which might recruit monocytes
  that will be further exposed to a range of tolerogenic stimuli in the tumor microenvironment.
  Moreover, the STING signaling pathway might induce IDO1, and the expression of IFN-I
  might upregulate CD73, thus contributing to producing inhibitory molecules in the
  tumor microenvironment. Created with BioRender.com.
