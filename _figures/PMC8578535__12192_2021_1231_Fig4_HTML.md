caption: A schematic representation of the contributory role of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  in AD pathogenesis. Activation of TLR4 on microglia cells recruits the PI3K/Akt
  signaling axis to increase the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which can enhance
  the expression level of genes encoding inflammatory mediators. Notably, excessive
  secretion of these molecules would eventually cause neuronal damages and interrupt
  synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia cells results
  in ROS and iNOS expressions which synergistically re-activate NF-κB to boost inflammatory
  responses that result in neurodegeneration, neuronal damage, and neuron cell death.
  In neurons, on the other hand, Aβ oligomers attenuate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  significantly. As a result, the intracellular level of SOD is reduced to the degree
  that it fails to neutralize ROS in neurons. It is well established that the excessive
  production of ROS can propagate signaling within neural cells to increase the production
  of Aβ plaques. For instance, ROS can increase the production of inflammatory cytokines
  and mediators in the neural cells via integrating with the ERK and MAPK signaling
  axes. ROS-mediated stimulation of NF-κB signaling pathway can also increase the
  expression of BACE1, an enzyme that is involved in the production of Aβ oligomers.
  Additionally, ROS engages with the activated GSK-3β and impairs the balance between
  pro- and anti-apoptotic-related proteins in favor of apoptotic death. Apart from
  the indicated mechanisms, when the production of Aβ exceeds more vigorously in the
  advanced stages of the disease, the activation of autophagy is not effective anymore;
  autophagosomes begin to accumulate and they themselves induce neuronal damage
