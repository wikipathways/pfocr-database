caption: Core analyses network predictions for HBoV-infected CuFi-8 cells. This analysis
  shows that the 54 HBoV-specific genes are involved in apoptosis, necrosis and (re-)organization
  of the extracellular matrix. (a) Interaction of the different genes with phosphorylation
  processes (1), apoptosis (2), cell death in general (3) and of pancreatic cancer
  cells (4) and tumor cell lines (5) in particular, as well as necrosis (6). (b) Influence
  of the HBoV-specific genes on the organization of connective tissues, including
  growth (1), proliferation (2) amongst others of fibroblasts (3), and the quantity
  of cells (4). (c) Prediction legend. Orange indicates an upregulation, and blue
  represents a downregulation of the respective pathway. Grey indicates that no pathway
  alterations based on single transcripts could be predicted. Brighter color indicates
  a weaker alteration, whereas darker color indicates a strong regulation.
