caption: Mechanism of glucose metabolism reprogramming of VECs  in atherosclerosis.
  Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) reduces lactate  production and prevents barrier
  dysfunction. Furthermore, the activation of  σ1 enhanced endothelial barrier function.
  In contrast, increased  glycolytic flux promotes endothelial cell dysfunction and
  can damage barrier  function by affecting the level of VE-calmodulin. Increased
  lactate induces  ERK1/2 for VE-calmucin hydrolysis and increases cell permeability.
  PFKFB3 can  break vascular barriers by upregulating VE-calmucin endocytosis, inhibit  N-calmucin
  or upregulate the expression of NF-κB. The PI3K/Akt signaling  pathway not only
  induces GLUT1, but also inhibits autophagy induced by mTOR.  SIRT3 can stimulate
  ATG5 and up-regulate the expression of PKM2 dimers. Activated  Beclin-1, LC3-II
  and inhibited p62 can stimulate the autophagy. Furthermore,  PFKFB3 stimulates autophagy
  by activating NF-κB. In addition, glycolysis  mediated by PFKFB3 can help the activation
  of macrophages and VECs, the disturbed  flow can activate HIF-1α regulated by NOX4-derived
  ROS, thereby  promoting the expression of glycolysis-related enzymes and PDK-1.
  Furthermore,  PRKAA1 can enhance glycolytic flux and induce the proliferation of
  VECs by  mediating AMPK and HIF-1α pathway. The production of TNF-α by  VECs and
  macrophages is involved in activating the HIF-1α pathway. The  proliferation of
  VECs can also be stimulated by activated VEGF and FGF. TIGAR, TP53 induced glycolysis
