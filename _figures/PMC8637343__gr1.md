caption: Schematic representations of BH-EGCG&NAC@MM nanosystem for inflammatory diseases'
  theranostics. (A) Scheme displaying the preparation of BH-EGCG@MM and BH-EGCG&NAC@MM
  using extrusion method. (B) The response mechanism of BH-EGCG toward ROS. (C) Scheme
  showing multiple actions of BH-EGCG&NAC@MM, including diagnosis of ConA-induced
  autoimmune hepatitis and CAR-induced hind paw edema via NIR fluorescent imaging
  and optoacoustic imaging, and efficient therapy of ConA-induced acute autoimmune
  hepatitis and CAR-induced hind paw edema via inhibiting NF-κB pathway and suppressing
  NLRP3 inflammasome formation.
