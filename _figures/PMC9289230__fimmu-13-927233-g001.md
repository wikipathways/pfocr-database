caption: 'The role of circulating neutrophils and neutrophils at the tumour site.
  Left: ① Glioma stem cells (GSCs) express S100A4 to promote the mesenchymal transition
  of glioma cells (). ② The release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils
  in the early stage of glioma development may be related to the antitumour neutrophil
  effect (). ③ Neutrophils secrete elastase, which destroys brain tissue and aids
  glioma invasion (). Middle: ① Astrocytoma and GBM cells express IL-1 and TNF and
  high levels of IL-8 under alpha stimulation, which recruit neutrophils (). ② Neutrophils
  form high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and bind to receptor for advanced glycation
  end products (RAGE) expressed in glioma tissues, activates the NF-κB signaling pathway
  to secrete IL-8, and promote neutrophil infiltration (). ③ Expression of FasL on
  glioma cells activates Fas signaling in the TME to express IL-8, leading to neutrophil
  aggregation (). ④ LINC01116 promotes the expression of IL-1β by recruiting the transcription
  regulator DDX5 to the IL-1β promoter, which promotes the recruitment of neutrophils
  (). ⑤ The ectopic expression of CD133 induces an increase in IL-1β expression, which
  causes neutrophils to aggregate in the TME (). Right: Neutrophil degranulation and
  elevated levels of serum arginase I induce immunosuppression in GBM patients ().
  Neutrophil expression of CD11b is an early predictor of tumour progression ().'
