caption: (A) T cell development. (B) B cell development. Each lineage is represented
  with distinguishing markers for corresponding stages, and where cell commitment
  occurs. Arrows indicate potential points along the development pathway where immune
  tolerizing interventions might be targeted in neuromyelitis optica/spectrum disorder.
  CAR = chimeric antigen receptor; CD = class designation marker; CLP = common lymphoid
  precursor; DN = double-negative thymocyte; DP = double-positive CD4+/CD8+ thymocyte;
  Ig = immunoglobulin; ImmB = immature B cell; ISP = immature single-positive CD8+
  thymocyte; LPreB = large PreB; MatB = mature B cell; PreB = pre-B cell receptor
  B cell; ProB = progenitor B cell; SP = single positive CD4+ or CD8+ thymocyte; SPreB
  = small PreB; TcR = T cell receptor; Treg = regulatory T cell.
