caption: 'Schematic diagram of the main related metabolic pathways related to immunoregulation
  of PG. PC: PC (18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)/15:0), PE:PE (18:0/16:1(9Z)), and PS:PS (18:0/20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)).
  The red and light blue words indicate metabolites significantly increased and reduced,
  respectively, in the PG-treated group compared with the control group. The yellow
  boxes indicate metabolites that are affected by PG using network pharmacology analysis.
  The solid lines indicate that one metabolite produces another metabolite in less
  than two steps in KEGG metabolism pathway maps.'
