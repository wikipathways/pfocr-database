caption: Schematic depicting the primary SIRT3 regulated metabolic pathways within
  mitochondria including oxidative phosphorylation (Ox Phos), fatty acid oxidation,
  ketogenesis, branched chain amino acid catabolism (BCCA), the TCA cycle, and the
  urea cycle. Circles represent constituent proteins or protein complexes within each
  pathway with the number of SIRT3 regulatory sites indicated. Abbreviations include
  Acetyl-CoA (AcCoA), acetoacetyl-CoA (AcAcCoA), β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHβ), succinyl-CoA
  (SuccCoA), malonyl-CoA (MalCoA), ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2), glutamate
  (Glu), proline (Pro), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Iso), cysteine (Cys),
  adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and phenylacetylglycine (PhenAcGly).
