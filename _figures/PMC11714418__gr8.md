caption: The schematic diagram of MT1B regulated by Zn2+ delaying MASH progression
  by inhibiting AKT/PI3K signaling pathway. Under normal conditions, intracellular
  Zn2+ in the cytoplasm facilitates the nuclear translocation of transcription factor
  MTF1, thereby upregulating MT1B expression and suppressing the AKT/PI3K pathway.
  In MASH, however, reduced nuclear translocation of MTF1 results in downregulated
  MT1B expression that promotes activation of the AKT/PI3K pathway, consequently exacerbating
  hepatic lipid metabolic disorder and increasing inflammatory factors. MT1B, metallothionein
  1B; MASH, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis
