caption: 'Schematic representation of the AAA pathway in Escherichia coli including
  its transcriptional and allosteric regulatory control circuits. Central carbon metabolism
  intermediates and genes shown: PPP (pentose phosphate pathway); TCA (tricarboxylic
  acid cycle); E4P (erythrose-4-P); PGNL (6-phospho D-glucono-1,5-lactone); PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate);

  6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase); tktA (transketolase I); pykA, pykF (pyruvate kinase
  II and pyruvate kinase I, respectively); lpdA, aceE, and aceF (coding for PYR dehydrogenase
  subunits); gltA (citrate synthase); pckA (PEP carboxykinase); ppc (PEP carboxylase);
  ppsA (PEP synthetase). Shikimate pathway intermediates and genes shown: DAHP (3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate);
  DHQ (3-dehydroquinate); DHS (3-dehydroshikimate); SHK (shikimate); S3P (SHK-3-phosphate);
  EPSP (5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate 3-phosphate); CHA (chorismate); aroF, aroG, aroH (DAHP
  synthase AroF, AroG and AroH, respectively); aroB (DHQ synthase); aroD (DHQ dehydratase);
  aroE, ydiB (SHK dehydrogenase and SHK dehydrogenase / quinate dehydrogenase, respectively);
  aroA (3-phosphoshikimate-1-carboxyvinyltransferase); aroC (CHA synthase). Terminal
  AAA biosynthetic pathways intermediates and genes shown: ANT (anthranilate); PRANT
  (N-(5-phosphoribosyl)-anthranilate); CDP (1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1''-deoxyribulose
  5''-phosphate); IGP ((1S,2R)-1-C-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate); trpE, trpD (ANT
  synthase component I and II, respectively); trpC (indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase
  / phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase); trpA (indoleglycerol phosphate aldolase);
  trpB (tryptophan synthase); PRE (prephenate); PPN (phenylpyruvate); HPP (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate);
  tyrA, pheA (TyrA and PheA subunits of the CHA mutase, respectively); ilvE (subunit
  of the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase); aspC (subunit of aspartate aminotransferase);
  tyrB (tyrosine aminotransferase). Continuous arrows show single enzymatic reactions,
  black dashed arrows show several enzymatic reactions, long-dashed blue arrows indicate
  allosteric regulation and dotted blue arrows indicate transcriptional repression.
