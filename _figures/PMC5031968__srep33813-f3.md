caption: (A) Pentose phosphate pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway was induced
  in larvae feeding in sugar maple. Genes highlighted in blue were more highly induced
  in larvae feeding in sugar maple while genes highlighted in yellow were more highly
  induced in larvae feeding in artificial diet. (B) Expression patterns of glycoside
  hydrolases detected in larval midguts. Several genes with the ability to metabolize
  non-plant cell wall carbohydrates were induced in larvae fed in either sugar maple
  or artificial diet. Blue indicates high expression levels and yellow indicates low
  expression levels. (C) Expression patterns of other digestive related genes detected
  in larval midguts. Aldo-keto reductases, GMC oxidoreductases, and heme peroxidases,
  have been previously hypothesized to be involved in woody tissue degradation in
  wood-feeding insects. Blue indicates high expression levels; yellow indicates low
  expression levels.
