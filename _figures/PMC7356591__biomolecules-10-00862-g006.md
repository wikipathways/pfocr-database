caption: Overview of the Protein-metabolite interactions connecting metabolism and
  signal transduction pathways in different species. The central carbon metabolism
  influences the activity of Ras/PKA and SNF1/AMPK/SnRK1 pathways, but also the mitochondrial
  retrograde response, in yeast, mammals and plants (shown respectively in yellow,
  red and green). The availability of specific amino acids controls the activity of
  TOR pathway both in yeast and in mammals, while in plants its activity is influenced
  by mitochondrial respirations.
