caption: p62 in osteoclast signaling and protein trafficking. The binding of RANKL
  to the receptor protein RANK at the plasma membrane induces the formation of a trimer,
  triggering the recruitment of a series of adaptor proteins. TRAF6 catalyses Lys63-linked
  autoubiquitination via intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is regulated
  by the UBA domain of p62, and eventually deubiquitinated post-recruitment of CYLD
  to p62. In the interim, this ubiquitination permits activation of the TAB1-TAB2-TAK1
  complex, in turn activating the MAP kinases, as well as NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK),
  which leads to phosphorylation and activation of IKKβ. Activation of TRAF6 and p62
  also leads to activation of the Akt/PKB pathway. Simultaneously, p62 binds aPKC
  through its N-terminal PB1, allowing for the phosphorylation of IKKβ by the aPKC.
  Once activated, IKKβ phosphorylates IκB, which is subsequently ubiquitinated, and
  degraded through the proteasome system, liberating NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus
  and interact with transcription promoters.
