caption: 'Activated c-erbB3-AKT signaling network in node-negative NSCLC correlates
  with poor overall survival. A focused analysis of five biochemically linked signaling
  proteins (ERBB3, PRAS40, FOXO1, GSK3, and AKT) found within the overarching protein
  activation signature shown in  is shown using a signaling cartoon of AKT signaling
  network (reproduced courtesy of Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., www.cellsignal.com)
  along with the individual statistically significant KM plots (ERBB3: p = 0.0089;
  PRAS40: p < 0.0001; FOXO1: p = 0.0006; GSK3: p = 0.0125; and AKT: p = 0.089) of
  each phosphoprotein shown numbered in the map. For the KM plots, red shows low levels
  of activation of the cognate protein and blue shows high relative phosphorylation
  levels (median intensity value of each protein was used as the cutpoint for statistical
  analysis). ERBB3,; PRAS40,; FOXO1,; GSK3,; AKT,; NSCLC, non–small-cell lung cancer;
  KM, Kaplan–Meier.'
