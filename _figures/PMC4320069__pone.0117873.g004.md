caption: The IPA Upstream Regulator tool was used to identify potential upstream regulators
  based on the statistical significance of genes in the gene list that function downstream
  of this regulator. The top 5 upstream regulators identified were flufenamic acid,
  androgen receptor (AR), cadmium chloride, prostate transmembrane protein, androgen
  induced 1 (PMEPA1), and prefoldin-like chaperone (URI1). Upstream regulators (red);
  upstream regulator and on the gene list (purple shading); genes from the gene list
  (blue).
