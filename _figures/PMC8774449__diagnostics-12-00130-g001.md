caption: Vitamin D metabolism pathway. Vitamin D active form is produced in a multi-step
  process, including the ultraviolet B (UVB) rays’ irradiation of a cutaneous precursor
  [7-dehydro-cholesterol (7-DHC)], and two hydroxylation steps. In addition to the
  synthesis of Vitamin D, 7-DHC can be oriented toward the production of cholesterol
  by Kandutsch–Russell biochemical pathway.
