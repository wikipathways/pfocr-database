caption: Proposed model depicting regulation and role of METTL3 and FTO in BMSC adipogenesis
  and osteogenesis with regard to osteoporosis. Working model of the mechanism of
  METTL3 knockdown increased JAK1/STAT5/C/EBPb pathway, decreased PTH/Pth1r signaling
  axis, decreased expression of RUNX2, Osterix, and Vegfa and decreased PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway. Overexpression of FTO in a GDF11-C/EBPα-dependent mechanism resulted in
  increase of the Pparg mRNA and the promotion of adipogenesis.
