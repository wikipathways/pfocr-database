caption: A schematic of the maize terpenoid pathway showing differentially expressed
  enzyme‐encoding genes in the H95 (susceptible) and H95:Rp1‐D (resistant) lines 12,
  24, and 120 hr postinoculation (hpi) infected with Puccinia sorghi IN2 and the relative
  levels of accumulation of specific metabolites in H95 (green bar) and H95:Rp1‐D
  (pink bar) plants infected with P. sorghi IN2 or mock‐inoculated plants (black bar)
  24 and 48 hpi. Metabolite peak intensities (n = 4, average ± SEM) are depicted on
  the primary y axis. Letters (a–c) represent significantly different treatments (p
  < .05, one‐way analysis of variance comparison followed by Duncan's test). The vertical
  scale bar in the top left shows the colours assigned to levels of differential expression
  (log2[fold change] values) compared to mock. Pink arrows represent accumulated metabolites
  in the H95:Rp1‐D line, while yellow arrows represent accumulated metabolites in
  both H95 and H95:Rp1‐D lines. Green lines indicate the stages in the metabolic pathways
  the protein encoded by each gene is thought to catalyse. Asterisks indicate no significant
  change (p > .05)
