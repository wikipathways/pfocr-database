caption: Proposed schematic for events involved in p300/β-catenin- and CCN-dependent
  alveolar epithelial repair. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such
  as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) create a chemokine gradient, including keratinocyte
  chemokine (KC), that recruits neutrophils to migrate through the alveolar epithelial
  layer, leading to neutrophil elastase (NE)-dependent cleavage of E-cadherin (ECad)
  and release of β-catenin (βcat) into the cytoplasm. With nuclear translocation,
  β-catenin can then bind to lymphoid enhancer factor-1/T-cell factor (LEF-1/TCF)
  and other cofactors. p300/β-catenin-dependent transcription results in expression
  of targets promoting epithelial repair, a process which is promoted further when
  binding of β-catenin to cAMP-response element binding protein (CBP) is inhibited
  (for example, by the small molecule ICG-001). Among the many downstream targets
  of the p300/β-catenin axis, the CCN proteins Wnt-inducible signaling pathway protein
  1 (WISP1) and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61) are expressed by epithelial
  cells in areas of injury, promoting repair of the alveolar epithelial cell layer.
