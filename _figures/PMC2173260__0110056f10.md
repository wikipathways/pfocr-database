caption: Moderate dose H2O2 mediates EC calcium influx through a PECAM-1–regulated
  NSC channel activated via a tyrosine kinase-dependent, phosphoinositide-independent
  signaling pathway. After moderate dose hydrogen peroxide (100–400 μM), the PECAM-1
  cytoplasmic domain and (most likely) other central downstream components undergo
  tyrosine phosphorylation, possibly by Src family tyrosine kinases. The tyrosine-phosphorylated
  PECAM-1 intracellular Y663/Y686 motif then interacts either directly with a plasmalemmal
  NSC channel or through one or more intermediaries. Alternatively, phosphorylated
  PECAM-1 may inhibit or sequester a channel suppressor, thus indirectly activating
  the channel. The PECAM-1–regulated channel is independent of calcium store release
  or IP3 receptor activation, manifests only partial trivalent cation sensitivity,
  and is neither [Ca+2]i nor voltage gated, suggesting a calcium signaling pathway
  distinct from capacitative calcium entry mechanisms. Once activated, this PECAM-1–regulated
  plasmalemmal channel conducts a prolonged NSC current that mediates the calcium
  transients observed in ECs and PECAM-1–transfected REN cells following moderate
  level (100–400 μM) hydrogen peroxide exposure.
