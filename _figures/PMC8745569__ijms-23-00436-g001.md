caption: 'The main signaling cascades implicated in the four types of TH actions.
  A. Type 1 comprises the nuclear TRs-dependent TH actions, induced by recruitment
  of TRs to TREs. Binding of T3 (represented by the brown triangle) to TRs results
  in dissociation of CoR from the TR/RXR hetero-dimers and recruitment of CoA, inducing
  target gene transcription. B. Type 2 comprises the TRs-dependent actions of TH exerted
  through tethering to other chromatin proteins binding of T3-bound TRs to DNA. C.
  Type 3 TH actions comprises the nuclear TRs-independent TH actions exerted through
  direct or indirect binding to DNA. Especially, interaction of T3 with cytoplasmic
  TRs or with the truncated TRα isoforms p30 TRα1 at the plasma membrane stimulates
  signaling transduction that results in promotion of transcription; D. Type 4 comprises
  various nuclear TRs-independent TH actions as follows. D1. Binding of T3 to integrin
  αvβ3 activates the Src/PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to the shuttling of cytoplasmic
  TRα to the nucleus, promoting transcription. D2. Binding of T4 (represented by the
  green rhombus) and of T3 to integrin αvβ3 activates PI3K/Akt and MAPK)/ERK1/2 pathways
  via PLCP and KCα. Activated MAPK induces the sodium proton ex-changer (Na+/H+),
  increases activity of the sodium pump (Na, K-ATPase), and modulates intracellular
  protein trafficking of proteins, such as ERα and TRβ1, from the cytoplasm to nucleus,
  promoting the transcription. Activated PI3K transduces also signaling that promotes
  transcription. D3. Type 4 includes also the TH actions on polymerization of actin.
  D4. Type 4 includes the action of T3 as regulator of Crym. Abbreviations: A, sodium
  pump Na, K-ATPase; Akt/protein kinase B (PKB); AP, actin polymerization; CoA, coactivators;
  CoR, corepressors E, sodium proton exchanger (Na+/H+); ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; P, proteins; PI3K, PKCα, protein kinase Cα; PLC, phospholipase C; PKGII,
  type II cGMP-dependent protein kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR,
  mammalian target of rapamycin; NOS nitric oxide synthase; NP, nucleoproteins; RXR,
  retinoic acid X receptor; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; TRα1, TRalpha isoform 1;
  TRβ1, TRbeta isoform 1; TREs, thyroid response elements.'
