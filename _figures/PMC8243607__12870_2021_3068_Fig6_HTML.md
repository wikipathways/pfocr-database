caption: Determination of key defensive mechanisms taking place in Qingliu sheaths
  under BPH infestation. a GO enrichment of upregulated genes identified in Qingliu
  sheaths in response to BPH infestation. Enriched GO terms from biological process
  (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF) GO categories are shown
  with bar length depicting enrichment significance and color intensity of bars depicting
  gene number. MapMan pathway annotation of DEGs with respect to b receptor kinases,
  c biotic stress and d overview of metabolism. Upregulated genes are shown in red
  and downregulated genes are shown in blue
