caption: 'The landscape of synergic epigenetic interactions with P13K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway in PD development. P13K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is activated due to overexpression
  of lncRNA UCA 1 and miR-181b, which leads to ROS production and other inflammatory
  responses. Similarly, CDR1-AS sponge with miR-7 and increases mTOR signaling. Moreover,
  lower expression of PGC-1α also regulated the inflammatory phenotype of microglia
  and enhanced P13K/Akt/mTOR pathway signaling. Activated P13K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway enhances NF-κβ activity that further releases pro-inflammatory cytokines
  along with iNOS and COX-2. Altogether, these epigenetic mechanisms interact with
  each other and with P13K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways to induce neuroinflammation
  in PD development. Note: ↓ shows downregulated expression, and ↑ shows an upregulated
  expression.'
