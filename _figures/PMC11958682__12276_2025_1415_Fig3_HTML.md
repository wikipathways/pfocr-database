caption: The intricate interactions between various metabolic pathways that influence
  acetyl-CoA metabolism and redox homeostasis in HCC cells. a, Acetyl-CoA production
  is significantly reduced in HCC due to the downregulation of its biosynthetic pathways.
  This reduction impacts both energy metabolism and protein acetylation, subsequently
  affecting gene expression and cellular differentiation. b, HCC cells manage oxidative
  stress by enhancing antioxidant defenses, primarily through the glutathione–glutamine–glutamate
  pathway. Despite elevated levels of ROS, these adaptive mechanisms are essential
  for maintaining redox homeostasis, which is crucial for cancer cell viability, progression
  and recurrence. Upregulation of GLS1 in HCC increases glutamate production, thereby
  boosting antioxidant capacity and promoting characteristics associated with cancer
  stemness. Proteins and pathways that are upregulated in HCC are marked in red, while
  those that are downregulated are indicated in blue, providing a clear visual representation
  of the metabolic changes in HCC
