caption: Transcriptional regulation of PDPN expression. PDPN expression can be upregulated
  by a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-22, IL-6, IFN-γ, TGF-β,
  IL-1β, and TNF-α, but the signaling pathways involved are largely unknown. PDPN
  upregulation induced by TGF-β requires Smad2/3 and 4 activity, while upregulation
  induced by IFN-ψ depends on STAT1 and STAT3 and that of IL-6 and IL-22 depends on
  STAT3. The PI3K-AKT-AP-1 pathway can also induce PDPN expression in brain tumors
  that have lost the negative regulation normally provided by PTEN. AP-1, a transcription
  factor comprised of Fos and Jun proteins, binds to the tetradecanoylphorbol acetate-responsive
  element (TRE) in the promoter of PDPN, which is heavily methylated.
