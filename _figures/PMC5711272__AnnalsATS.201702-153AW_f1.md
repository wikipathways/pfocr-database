caption: Central role of mitochondria in energy production, biosynthesis, and redox
  regulation. Mitochondria integrate energy metabolism, biosynthesis, and redox balance.
  (1) Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) to glucose-6-phosphate (Glucose-6-P),
  which undergoes glycolysis in the cytoplasm to produce pyruvate. Under normal, aerobic
  conditions, most of the pyruvate that enters is converted to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
  by the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex in the mitochondrial matrix, whereas
  a small proportion of it is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
  Glycolytic intermediates also feed into biosynthetic pathways. Glucose-6-phosphate
  is redirected into the pentose phosphate pathway to produce the nucleotide precursor,
  ribose-5-phosphate, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
  required for the maintenance of reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. (2) Fatty acids
  are transported into the mitochondrion after their conjugation to carnitine by carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), to undergo fatty acid oxidation, leading to acetyl-CoA
  production. (3) Acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetate (OAA) to form citrate, which
  enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the mitochondrial matrix, generating
  electron carriers, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide
  (FADH2). Citrate produced by the TCA cycle is converted, by ATP-citrate lyase (ACL),
  to cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA, which is required for fatty acid synthesis. (4) Cells
  with increased energy demands, such as rapidly proliferating cells, use glutamine
  for energy production. Glutamine is converted to glutamate by glutaminolysis through
  the action of glutaminase (GLS). Glutamate acts as a precursor for glutathione synthesis,
  but can also be converted, by glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), into α-ketoglutarate,
  which feeds into the TCA cycle. Glutamine also provides nitrogen for amino acid
  and nucleotide synthesis. (5) Electrons (e−) are transferred from NADH and FADH2
  to molecular oxygen (O2) through redox reactions facilitated by a series of electron
  carrier protein complexes (I–IV) located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM),
  a process termed “oxidative phosphorylation” (OXPHOS). The energy released by the
  electron flow drives the movement of protons into the intermembrane space (IMS)
  creating a membrane potential (ΔΨm). ΔΨm drives the influx of protons back into
  the mitochondrial matrix via the ATP synthase complex (complex V), which phosphorylates
  ADP to ATP. Electron leakage during OXPHOS leads to univalent reduction of oxygen
  to form superoxide anion (O2−). O2− is converted to the less reactive oxidant, hydrogen
  peroxide (H2O2), which is eliminated through the action of catalase and GSH. (6)
  In response to oxidative stress and/or mitochondrial dysfunction, adaptive metabolic
  reprogramming, involving increased glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and glutaminolysis,
  ensures maintenance of ATP production, biosynthesis, and redox balance required
  for cell survival and normal function. Impaired metabolic reprogramming in chronic
  obstructive pulmonary disease may lead to prolonged mitochondrial dysfunction and
  an inability of cells to respond to stress, leading to cell senescence and death.
  Conversely, extensive metabolic reprogramming, due to overadaptation to hypoxia
  or inflammation, could lead to increased survival and proliferation of airway smooth
  muscle cells and myofibroblast activation. MnSOD = manganese superoxide dismutase.
