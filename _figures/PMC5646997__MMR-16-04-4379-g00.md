caption: Schematic representation of the effects of mitochondrial damge and ER stress
  in ALS pathogenesis. Dysfunction of glial cells results in decreased levels of chaperone
  proteins, including HSPs and members of the PDI family. The impaired expression
  of chaperone proteins results in protein misfolding, which impairs ER-Golgi apparatus
  trafficking. The UPR signaling pathway is activated due to ER stress caused by impaired
  ER-Golgi trafficking, and initiates cell apoptosis. In addition, mutations in superoxide
  dismutase 1 cause mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress, ultimately leading
  to abnormalities in axonal transportation. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ALS, amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis; HSP, heat shock protein; PDI, protein disulphide isomerase; UPR,
  unfolded protein response; PERK, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase;
  ATF, activating transcription factor; IRE, inositol-requiring enzyme.
