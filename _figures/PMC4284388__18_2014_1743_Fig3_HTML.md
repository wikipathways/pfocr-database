caption: Platelet signaling induced by GPIb-IX-V and required for αIIbβ3 activation.
  GPIb-IX-V-induced platelet activation is the result of the activation of several
  molecules. Whereas the involvement of Src family, Rac1, PI3kinase/Akt and the activation
  of PLCγ1 which leads to Ca2+ release is well established, the signaling pathway
  involving NO and the activation of PKG is still controversial. The subsequent activation
  of the small G protein Rap1 which allows the recruitment of talin to β3, is essential
  for αIIbβ3 activation
