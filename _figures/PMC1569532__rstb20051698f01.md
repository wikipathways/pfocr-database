caption: Different types of regulatory T cells. The four panels depict the four main
  types of regulatory T cells that have been characterized so far on the left of each
  panel, together with an indication of their interaction with antigen presenting
  cells (APC) on the right. (a) Natural regulatory T cells (Treg) are CD4+CD25+foxP3+
  cells that are associated with TGF-β for their generation and some of their functions.
  They can down-modulate APC by CTLA4 cross-linking of CD80/86 molecules, the induction
  of indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO) and the catabolism of tryptophan. Th3 cells that
  make predominantly TGF-β may be similar to these Treg. (b) Anergic T cells are associated
  with T cell activation in the absence of costimulation and are hyporesponsive to
  antigen due to the induction of the E3-ubiquitin ligases GRAIL, Itch and cbl-b that
  cause degradation of the T cell receptor signalling pathway. Anergic cells may suppress
  by competing for IL-2 and costimulation. (c) Tr1 cells are dependent on IL-10 for
  their generation, and some of their suppressive functions. They can also modulate
  the APC via CTLA4, CD80/86 and IDO. (d) The CD8+CD28−foxP3+ suppressor T cell is
  also associated with an IL-10 rich environment and is able, at least in the human
  system, to modulate the dendritic antigen presenting cell to express the molecules
  ILT3 and ILT4 that present to further T cells to induce anergy and CD4+CD25+ Treg
  cells.
