caption: Apoptosis signalling pathways. Two important pathways of caspase activation
  exist in mammalian cells, one involving death receptor and the other involving mitochondria
  (see also text); (→ activation; ⊣ inhibition). The extrinsic cell death pathway
  (dotted line) is mediated by death receptors (the best studied death receptor is
  Fas).The binding of Fas ligand (FasL) leads to receptor activation. The Fas receptor
  contains a death domain (DD) in its cytoplasmic region which interacts with the
  adaptor protein (FADD), forming the DISC (Death-Inducing Signalling Complex). DISC
  formation results in the activation of caspase-8,-10 which in turn will activate
  downstream effector caspase (caspase-3,-7). In the mitochondrial pathway (continuous
  line), which is initiated by multiple forms of cellular stress, Bax and Bak are
  activated at mitochondria. Also, Bid (activated by caspase-8 cleaveage in extrinsic
  cell death pathway) activates Bax and Bak to mediate the release of cytochrome c
  in the cytosol. Cytochrome c and dATP trigger the assembly of the Apaf1-apoptosome,
  which recruits and activates caspase-9. This, in turn, cleaves and activates caspase-3.
  The activation of caspase-3, -7 is antagonized by IAPs, which in turn can be inhibited
  by Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2.
