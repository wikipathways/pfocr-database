caption: 'Insights into urushiol biosynthesis(A) Putative biosynthetic pathway of
  urushiols in lacquer tree. Enzymes involved at each step of the volatile terpenoid
  biosynthesis pathway are shown in black. Relative expression profiles of genes implicated
  in volatile lipid acid and derivative chalcone biosynthesis among lacquer cultivars
  (TV, the wild lacquer; HoM, Hongmao Guizhou; DHP, Dahongpao; GBC, Gaobachi; HuM,
  Huangmao Guizhou) are presented as heatmaps.(B) Syntenic analysis among T. vernicifluum

  chr. 19. Co-synteny regions are linked with gray belts.(C) Phylogenetic relationships
  of TvPKSs of T. vernicifluum. The protein sequences were aligned by Clustal X and
  generated the phylogenetic tree using MEGA 11.0 by the maximum likelihood method.

  colored branches.(D) The protein-protein interaction network of TvPKS by cytoscape.'
