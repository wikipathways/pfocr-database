caption: Comparison of protein and gene expression studies. Interaction network diagram
  combining a subset of differentially expressed proteins detected in iTRAQ-MS pilot
  study, and gene products from two microarray-based gene expression studies investigating
  bortezomib resistance [,]. Up-regulated (red) and down-regulated (green) proteins
  in the 8226/R5 cell line from each of the three studies are connected by intermediate
  interactors (white). Expression of DEK oncogene was observed in both iTRAQ-MS and
  Mulligan [] studies; proteasome (prosome, macropain) 26S subunit non-ATPase 1 (PSMD1)
  was expressed in both iTRAQ-MS and Buzzeo [] studies. Integration of the pilot proteomics
  data with gene expression datasets indicates complimentarity at the protein interaction
  and pathway level. Differentially expressed proteins (fold-change = 1.5) measured
  by iTRAQ-MS are shown to interact directly with a number of oncogenic signaling
  molecules including TP53, c-Myc, NF-kB, STAT, and PI3K, suggesting possible roles
  as upstream effectors or indicators of anti-apoptotic and/or tumorgenic processes.
  Other direct interactors of measured proteins include therapeutic targets in multiple
  myeloma, including PSMB5 (bortezomib), CDK2 (flavopiridol), and RRM2 (fludarabine
  phosphate). Protein interactions and illustration were generated with Ingenuity
  Pathways Analysis version 8.0-2602. Protein interactions were restricted to direct
  types (default selections) with the term "cancer" as a disease annotation in human/mouse/rat
  and in uncategorized species.
