caption: 'DNA glycosylases and APE1 (green) scan DNA to detect damaged bases and abasic
  sites. Subsequent to encountering damage, the repair is initiated, and a metastable
  complex is formed. Encounter with XRCC1-pol β or free pol β facilitates damage release
  and transfer of the damaged DNA to pol β or to another more appropriate enzyme in
  the repair pathway (lower left). Occasional unfacilitated dissociation of the protective
  APE1 or DNA glycosylase from the damage intermediate complex results in an unprotected
  strand break, followed by PARP1 activation, and recruitment of XRCC1 via the BRCT1-PAR
  interaction (lower right). Highly basic regions of XRCC1 involved in DNA binding
  are indicated in blue. Abbreviations: APE1, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1;
  PBB, XRCC1 N-terminal pol β-binding domain.'
