caption: Impaired insulin signaling/ secretion involved in the progression of dementia
  This schematic diagram depicts both normal and abnormal insulin signaling in the
  brain. Insulin activates signaling pathways such as AKT, PI3K, JNK, NF-KB, GLUT4
  and GSK3. Synaptic plasticity and memory are both linked to the PI3K pathway. The
  PI3K pathway is linked to synaptic plasticity and memory. As a result, aberrant
  insulin binding can cause neuroinflammation by activating proinflammatory cytokines
  and lowering cognitive capacities via JNK and NF-KB. Long-term memory loss is caused
  by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation caused by GSK3
  and its hyperphosphorylation. It also elevates the expression of caspase-3 and 9,
  which ultimately leads to neuronal cell death.
