caption: 'Initial oviposition depression during the 0- to 24-hr acute response period
  and information transmission during social learning 24- to 48-hr periods are not
  coupled. Sustained oviposition depression requires learning and memory genes in
  both teachers and students. Alleles tested for indicated genes were ninaBP315, Orb2ΔQ,
