caption: The endothelial cilium regulates various signaling pathways involved in the
  vascular barrier, such as HH and Notch pathways. The binding of SHH to PTCH1 leads
  to SMO activation and enrichment at the cilium. GPR161, the negative regulator of
  the HH pathway, then is internalized from the cilium. Subsequently, the GLI2/SUFU
  complex is transported to the ciliary tip by the IFT complex. After the complex
  is dissociated, GLI2 is activated and translocated to the nucleus. In addition,
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces the expression of delta like canonical
  Notch ligand 4 (DLL4), which then binds to Notch1 to activate downstream events.
