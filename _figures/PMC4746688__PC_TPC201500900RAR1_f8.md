caption: 'Initial Model for Bayberry Surface Wax Biosynthesis.(A) The pathway proposed
  here is supported by multiple lines of evidence (see text), including lipid structural
  analysis, radiolabeling, and the identity of very highly expressed acyltransferase
  transcripts in Bayberry knobs (sn-2 GPAT, DCR, and GDSL-motif). The pathway begins
  with acylation of  by 16:0-CoA and synthesis of sn-2  catalyzed by bifunctional
  sn-2 GPAT (1). The intracellular pool of sn-2  is then used as a substrate for  synthesis
  by a putative MAG:MAG transacylase (2). The  product and a portion of the sn-2  are
  transported outside of cells.  synthesis occurs when sn-2  donates an acyl chain
  to  through a proposed extracellular : transacylase (3). The : transacylase and
  : transacylase reactions proposed are based on radiolabeling data and have not been
  demonstrated by direct assays with purified enzymes. Other enzyme reactions and/or
  an alternative scenario in which  synthesis occurs outside cells cannot be ruled
  out.(B) The Kennedy pathway for  synthesis is also presented to illustrate the contrasting
  reactions of oilseed  synthesis to Bayberry surface wax synthesis.'
