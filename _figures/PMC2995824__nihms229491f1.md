caption: Regulation of muscle protein synthesis. Simplified schematic of the integrating
  role of mTOR in controlling diverse cellular signals, such as hormones, nutrients,
  and stress, regulating protein synthesis. The mTORC1 consisting of mTOR, raptor
  (regulatory associated protein of mTOR), GβL (also known as mLST8), PRAS40, and
  DEPTOR stimulates translation initiation and protein synthesis by increasing phosphorylation
  of both 4E-BP1 (eIF4E BP-1) and S6K1 (ribosomal protein S6K1). In contrast, mTORC2,
  consisting of mTOR, rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), GβL, DEPTOR,
  mSIN1 (mammalian stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein), and PRR5
  (proline-rich protein 5), seems to have minimal impact on muscle protein synthesis.
  The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 decreases the inactive 4E-BP1 00B7 eIF4E complex and
  increases the eIF4E 00B7 eIF4G complex, thereby enhancing cap-dependent translation.
  Activation of S6K1 phosphorylates a host of proteins, which can differentially regulate
  protein synthesis. Growth factors, such as insulin and IGF-1 (insulinlike growth
  factor 1), signal through binding to their cognate receptors and regulate mTORC1
  via a PI3K-Akt–dependent pathway. Akt destabilizes the TSC1/TSC2 protein-protein
  complex, thereby activating mTOR via the small GTPase Rheb (Ras homolog enriched
  in brain). In addition, nutrients, such as the branched-chain amino acid leucine,
  increase translation via a mechanism affecting mTOR probably distal to or at the
  level of Rheb and possibly mediated by the family of Rag G-proteins or Vps34 (vacuolar
  protein sorting 34). The cellular energy status (i.e., AMP/ATP ratio) is transduced
  by LKB1 modulation of AMPK (52032-AMP activated protein kinase) activity.
