caption: A schematic diagram of the role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS),
  miRNA, and NF-E2-related factor 2 NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway in the induction
  of gastric motility in diabetes. Loss of nNOS dimerization increases the levels
  of miRNA processing proteins DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region Gene 8 (DGCR8) and
  HIV1-1 transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP), leading to the biogenesis
  of miRNA-28, which targets NRF2, causing reduced nitrergically mediated gastric
  motility. Supplementation of sepiapterin normalizes the gastric function by restoring
  the pathways outlined above. Arrow indicates activation, whereas bar indicates inhibition.
  ↑ and ↓ marks in the parenthesis indicate increase and decrease in levels, respectively.
