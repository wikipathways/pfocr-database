caption: The xanthine alkaloid biosynthetic network in plants potentially includes
  12 unique paths leading from XR and xanthine to caffeine. Ring nitrogen atoms are
  numbered on X and XR to show that the order in which N1, N3, and N7 are methylated
  differs between each pathway. Several of these appear to be utilized across angiosperms.
  Dotted arrows show the presumed pathway through which the majority of flux is achieved
  in Coffea using XMT-type enzymes and Camellia using CS-type enzymes. Dashed arrows
  show the presumed network utilized by Citrus which uses XMT-type enzymes. Solid
  thick and thin lines show the common pathway hypothesized for Paullinia and Theobroma,
  respectively, although the final step to CF from TB is unclear for the latter. Both
  Paullinia and Theobroma utilize CS-type enzymes to catalyze the reactions shown.
  Enzyme names are provided next to reactions they catalyze. Distinct structure colors
  are kept consistent with subsequent figures.
