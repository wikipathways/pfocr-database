caption: Role of purinergic receptors in regulation of insulin secretion and β-cell
  survival. The facilitative GLUT-2 transporter mediates glucose entry. Glucose metabolism
  results in production of ATP, which closes the ATP-sensitive channel, KATP. The
  channel comprises of four Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits. Closure of KATP depolarises
  the cell membrane potential and thus opens voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels eventually
  leading to generation of Ca2+ action potentials. Exocytosis of secretory vesicles
  containing insulin (and ATP) is triggered by increases in the cellular Ca2+. ATP
  can be also released from parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. P2 receptors can
  boost and amplify signals associated with the glucose effect on insulin secretion
  and on proliferation or apoptosis of β-cells. P2X receptors facilitate Ca2+/Na+
  influx and membrane depolarisation, and as a result, they can elicit insulin secretion
  even at low glucose concentrations. Some P2Y receptors increase cellular Ca2+ and
  activate protein kinase C (PKC) pathways. In addition, other P2Y and adenosine receptors
  affect the cyclic AMP pathway and possibly Epac signalling. At high adenosine concentrations,
  adenosine would be transported into the β-cell and exert metabolic effects. Receptors
  leading to increased insulin secretion are shown in green, those inhibiting insulin
  secretion are in red. Receptors affecting cell proliferation are in blue and those
  stimulating apoptosis purple. Receptors depicted here are taken from functional
  studies and the prefixes refer to rat, mouse or human receptors. (Reproduced from
