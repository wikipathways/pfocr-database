caption: 'Effect of aberrant activation of the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway on PD-L1
  expression in various tumors: increased PD-L1 expression in NSCLC by activating
  the downstream pathway PI3K-AKT-mTOR. In glioma, MET overexpression increased PD-L1
  expression by activating the downstream STAT4 pathway. In hepatocellular carcinoma,
  MET promotes PD-L1 expression through activation of the MAPK signaling pathway,
  followed by activation of the downstream NF-κBp65 transcription factor and interaction
  with the proximal region of the PD-L1 promoter. In pancreatic cancer, MET activates
  the downstream STAT1 pathway to promote PD-L1 expression and maintains PD-L1 stability
  with the help of CMTM6. In gastric cancer, upregulation of MACC1 can cause MET overexpression,
  which increases PD-L1 expression by activating the downstream pathway PI3K-AKT-mTOR.
