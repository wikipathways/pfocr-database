caption: 'In response to renal injury, resident renal cells and infiltrating immune
  cells produce a number of factors that initiate the processes of renal fibrosis,
  including TGF-β and ROS. These factors act in concert with various reinforcing factors,
  such as the sustained activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), to activate
  signal transduction intermediates that drive ECM accumulation and renal fibrosis
  by multiple means, involving: the formation of fibroblasts with a synthetic phenotype
  (myofibroblasts) from resident fibroblasts or via the processes of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) or endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), cell death, and
  the production of pro-inflammatory or profibrotic cytokines (including TGF-β) that
  feedback to perpetuate the inflammatory and fibrotic cycle. Recent studies have
  defined a number of endogenous molecules that dampen the fibrotic process by targeting
  either the reinforcing factors or signaling intermediates. See text for additional
  details.'
