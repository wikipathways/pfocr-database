caption: Model for synergism between Rb family and miR-17∼92 in tumorigenesis. Rb
  family member loss leads to compensatory p21Cip1 up-regulation, which may be suppressed
  depending on the level of miR-17∼92. Genomic miR-17∼92 amplification in Rb/p107DKO
  mice leads to suppression of p21Cip1 and to bypass of cell cycle exit/arrest. High
  miR-17∼92 expression in some cells (e.g., human retinoblastoma cells) may allow
  for evasion of this compensatory pathway even without genomic alterations.
