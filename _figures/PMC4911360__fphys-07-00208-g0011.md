caption: Gene-network of not isolated genes selected by Adalnet in the TCGA ovarian
  dataset. Each node represents a gene and an edge between two nodes means that the
  two genes belongs to the same pathway. Different colors are used for different pathways.
  The color of each node represents the p-value of the interaction between the gene
  and ovarian cancer (Huttenhower et al., ). Genes with p > 0.10 are represented in
  green.
