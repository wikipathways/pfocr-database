caption: A model mechanism on the ability of piceatannol to induce apoptosis and suppress
  cell proliferation in CaP cells is proposed. (a) For induction of apoptosis, the
  effects of piceatannol is postulated to occur secondary to DNA damage accompanied
  by increased phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser139, which facilitate and culminate in
  the cleavage of caspase 3 and AIF. (b) for suppression of proliferation, piceatannol
  is proposed to inhibit the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway resulting in suppression of
  CaP cell proliferation and survival.
