caption: Network analysis by Ingenuity®Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicated molecules
  associated with rheumatic disease and inflammation of joint. The network analysis
  was performed by IPA software to indicate networks involved in the 13 candidate
  genes from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) osteoblasts. Ten of the 13 candidate genes
  were grouped in one network associated with cardiovascular system development and
  function, cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation. Molecules including
  ADAMTS12, BDKRB1, BDKRB2, BMP1, FGF2, FOXO1, KCTD20, NOTCH4, PPARG, TGFB1 and miR-146a-5p
  were associated with rheumatic disease and inflammation of joint in the network,
  as indicated in purple frames. Molecules in green indicated down-regulated expressions,
  and molecules in red indicated up-regulated expressions in RA osteoblasts compared
  to normal osteoblasts. The green and red color scales disclosed the relative gene
  expression values of RA to normal osteoblasts.
