caption: Effects of phytoestrogens on ECs and VSMCs. In ECs, phytoestrogens such as
  genistein or daidzein bind ERs and GPER and increase [Ca2+]i, PI3K/Akt, MAPK and
  cAMP which cause phosphorylation and activation of eNOS and promote the production
  of NO. NO release activates guanylate cyclase (GC) in VSM leading to increased cGMP
  and stimulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). PKG decreases [Ca2+]i by
  stimulating Ca2+ extrusion pump in the plasma membrane and Ca2+ uptake pump in the
  sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and/or decrease the sensitivity of the contractile myofilaments
  to [Ca2+]i. Phytoestrogens also activate cyclooxygenase (COX) to produce prostacyclin
  (PGI2) and in turn activate adenylate cyclase (AC) and the PGI2-cAMP-PKA pathway,
  leading to VSM relaxation. Phytoestrogens may also induce EDHF release and activate
  Ca2+-activated K+ channels causing hyperpolarization and relaxation of VSM. Phytoestrogens
  also inhibit ET-1 release and thereby decrease VSM contraction. In VSM, phytoestrogens
  may activate K+ channels, leading to membrane hyperpolarization, inhibition of Ca2+
  entry through Ca2+ channels, and inhibition of Ca2+-dependent MLC phosphorylation
  and VSM contraction. Phytoestrogens through activation of plasma membrane ERs may
  also inhibit protein kinase C (PKC), Rho-K and/or the MAPK pathway and thereby further
  inhibit VSM contraction.
