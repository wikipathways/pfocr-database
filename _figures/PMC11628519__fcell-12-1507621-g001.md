caption: 'Upon ligand binding to its receptor, the JAK-STAT pathway is initiated by
  receptor dimerization, which facilitates the proximity of JAK proteins, enabling
  mutual phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of the receptor. Phosphorylated
  tyrosine residues on the receptor serve as docking sites for STAT proteins, which
  are subsequently phosphorylated by JAKs. The activated STAT proteins dimerize and
  translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to DNA and regulate gene transcription.
  The pathway is tightly controlled by several regulatory mechanisms: SOCS proteins
  inhibit JAK activity, while PIAS and PTPs modulate and dephosphorylate STATs, respectively,
  ensuring precise signal termination'
