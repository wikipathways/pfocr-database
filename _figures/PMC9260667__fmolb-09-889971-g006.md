caption: Schematic illustration of the effects of exposure to EtHg/TmHg on the Thioredoxin
  system both in the cytosol (TrxR1/Trx1) and in mitochondria (TrxR2/Trx2) (1a, 1b).
  As a result of Trx oxidation peroxiredoxins are dimerized (2a, 2b) causing a reduction
  in antioxidant capacity and accumulation of ROS (3a, 3b). At the same time, the
  reduction in TrxR/Trx activity and expression likely promotes Nrf-2 signaling as
  an attempt to recover enzymatic activity levels (4). Overall, oxidation of Trx,
  leads to caspase-3 activation, and eventually, apoptosis takes place (5). Nevertheless,
  some of these mechanisms need to be further confirmed, so the dashed arrows refer
  to those mechanisms such as analyzing the Nrf-2 signaling pathway, confirming Prx3
  dimerization, and associated molecular events such as cytochrome c release, activation
  of caspase-8 and -9.
