caption: 'The integrated stress response (ISR). ISR is activated by several stress
  stimuli. In mammals, these are sensed by four kinases: general control non-depressible
  2 (GCN2), protein kinase R protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), Heme-regulated
  eIF2α kinase (HRI) and double stranded RNA dependent protein kinase (PKR), each
  of which respond to a set of stimuli. These kinases undergo autophosphorylation
  and phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which inhibits its
  catalytic activity and its function of delivering the initiator tRNA to the ribosome,
  thereby arresting global translation. Under these conditions, only certain mRNAs
  (such as that encoding ATF4) are translated. ATF4 functions either as a homodimer
  or heterodimer to transactivate its target genes. The pathway is referred to as
  ISR because signaling mediated by diverse stress stimuli converge upon a common
  pathway (eIF2α/ATF4 axis).'
