caption: 'The cyclical nature of the sleep–diet relationship. (a) Mechanisms by which
  sleep influences food selection and energy intake. Poor sleep increases sensitivity
  to food reward and may alter taste sensitivity or perception as well as release
  of appetite-regulating hormones, leading to selection of energy-dense foods and
  increased snacking. (b) Pathway by which a healthful diet rich in food sources of
  tryptophan, serotonin, or melatonin leads to good-quality sleep. The correct functioning
  of the sleep–wake cycle is promoted by melatonin, exclusively synthesized from dietary
  tryptophan, via serotonin, obtained from ingested foods. Melatonin is synthesized
  enzymatically by the sequential actions of four enzymes (TPH1/2, 5-HTP decarboxylase,
  AANAT, HIOMT) and requires Mg and B vitamins as cofactors. Abbreviations: AANAT,
  arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase; HIOMT, hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase; 5-HTP,
  5-hydroxytryptophan; Mg, magnesium; NAS, N-acetylserotonin; TPH1/2, tryptophan hydroxylase.'
