caption: MicroRNA-mediated metabolism. The figure shows aspects of microRNA-mediated
  glucose and glutamine metabolism in cancer. Black arrows show the catabolic and
  anabolic processing of metabolites. The larger black arrows represent pathways that
  are upregulated in HCC, and the broken arrows signify that metabolic intermediates
  are not shown. MicroRNAs in blue are downregulated in HCC, and those in orange are
  upregulated. MicroRNA-mediated regulations are shown in red for inhibition and green
  for activation. The broken arrows represent mechanisms in which the microRNA does
  not directly target an enzyme within the specified metabolic pathway. The question
  marks next to some of the miR-155 regulations indicate mechanisms that are yet to
  be elucidated. GLUT, glucose transporter; MCT4, monocarboxylate transporter 4; G6PD,
  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; TKT, transketolase.
