caption: The PI3K pathway in the context of BCR signaling along with various targets.
  The BCR pathway is activated through antigen binding followed by recruitment and
  stimulation of LYN/SYK, resulting in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on adapter
  proteins on the BCR as well as CD19. This enables the docking of PI3K regulator
  subunit to the BCR and CD19 and activation of the PI3K pathway. Activated PI3K phosphorylates
  PIP2 into PIP3 which stimulates PH domain signaling molecules including Akt. LYN/SYK
  also activate the BTK pathway which instigates PLCγ2 activation. The result of these
  processes is intranuclear transcriptional activation promoting cell survival. PTEN
  is a prominent negative regulator of this pathway. Also shown is the role of follicular
  T-helper cells and the PD-1/PDL-1 pathway. Created with BioRender.com.
