caption: Proposed pathway for the synthesis of CoQ10via alternative ring precursors.
  4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HB) is the canonic aromatic ring precursor used in CoQ10
  biosynthesis. The alternative ring precursors 2,4-diHB and vanillic acid also serve
  as substrates for COQ2. After attachment of the decaprenyl tail, the other COQ polypeptides
  that participate in the canonic biosynthetic pathway serve to modify the ring so
  that CoQ10 may be produced. This allows bypassing of certain steps. Some of the
  late-stage CoQ intermediates are needed to stabilize the Q complex (CoQ synthome).
  Cells with deficiencies in certain steps of the pathway show stabilization of certain
  COQ polypeptides in the presence of the alternate ring precursors, which can bypass
  the deficient steps. 4HB, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid; DMQ, demethoxy-coenzyme Q; DMeQ,
  demethyl-coenzyme Q; decaprenyl PP, decarprenyl pyrophosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate; 2,4-diHB, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid.
