caption: 'Schematics showing the entire Drosophila third instar (wandering) larval
  lymph gland. Uninfested – primary lobe is demarcated into the niche/PSC (purple),
  progenitor/MZ (green), and differentiated/CZ (red) zones. Posterior lobes harbor
  a heterogeneous progenitor pool that is not segregated into zones. Posterior progenitor (PP)
  markers identified from this study are indicated in light blue (extracellular ligands,
  matrix components, and receptors) or black (transcription factors) font. The status
  of JAK-STAT signaling is indicated below for each lobe. Upon wasp infestation, JAK-STAT
  pathway is downregulated in anterior progenitors leading to lamellocyte differentiation
  (dark blue) and histolysis. Systemic signals lead to production of ligands such
  as Upd (pink) that may be selectively trapped by extracellular matrix components
  such as Dlp around the posterior lobes (light blue border), leading to increased
  JAK-STAT signaling, in an Asrij-independent and Latran-dependent manner. PPs are
  maintained and few coalesced cells are seen (dark green). Pri. indicates primary
  lobes, Sec. indicates secondary lobes, and Tert. indicates tertiary lobes. PSC:
  posterior signaling center; MZ: medullary zone; CZ: cortical zone.'
