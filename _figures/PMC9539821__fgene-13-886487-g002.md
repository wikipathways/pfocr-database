caption: 'Wnt Signalling Pathway: DKK3 binds to LRP, a WNT pathway coactivator of
  Frizzled, in normal mammary epithelial cells, preventing the pathway from being
  activated in the presence of the WNT ligand. In the absence of WNT activation, E-Cadherin
  binds to cytoplasmic -catenin, which is destroyed by GSK3. The DKK3 promoter, on
  the other hand, is hypermethylated in breast cancer, resulting in its downregulation.
  LRP can coactivate Frizzled in the presence of the WNT ligand in the absence of
  DKK3, resulting in phosphorylation of DSH, which prevents GSK3 from degrading -catenin.'
