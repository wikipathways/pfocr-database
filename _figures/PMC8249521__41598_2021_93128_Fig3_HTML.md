caption: 'TimeNexus extracts active subnetworks from the yeast cell cycle interactome
  enriched in relevant biological terms related to cell cycle from early and late
  cell cycle stages. (a) Aggregated network of the S. cerevisiae cell cycle pathway,
  containing core components of the yeast cell cycle as defined by KEGG. Yellow nodes
  are differentially expressed query nodes in the first three time points (0 min,
  5 min, 10 min) of the first full cycle in the time-series expression dataset, blue
  ones are differentially expressed query nodes in the late time points 60 min – 70 min;
  those with a gradient from yellow to blue are differentially regulated and therefore
  query nodes in both, early and late time points. Blue lines (intra-layer edges)
  represent protein–protein interactions, red ones protein-DNA interactions. Dotted
  lines represent inter-layer edges. The interaction data were extracted from HitPredict
  and the YEASTRACT + databases, respectively. (b) An active subnetwork was extracted
  from the first three time points of the yeast cell cycle (0–10 min), containing
  genes differentially expressed in early phases of the cell cycle. Layer 1 (0 min):
  28 nodes and 58 intra-layer edges; layer 2 (5 min): 41 nodes and 134 intra-layer
  edges; layer 3 (10 min: 35 nodes ad 95 intra-layer edges. (c) Enrichment analysis
  with genes in the early active subnetwork identified processes related to replication
  and active transcription. (d) An active subnetwork of late time points in the cell
  cycle (60–70 min) was extracted. Layer 1 (60 min): 22 nodes and 72 intra-layer edges;
  Layer 2 (65 min): 27 nodes and 101 intra-layer edges; Layer 3 (70 min): 21 nodes
  and 70 intra-layer edges. (e) Enrichment analysis of the genes contained in the
  late active subnetwork from time points 60–70 min shown in (d) resulted in enriched
  pathways related to late processes in the cell cycle, such as contractile ring organization,
  cell septum assembly or septin ring assembly and organization. Shown in (b) and
  (d) are the extracted active subnetworks of core cell cycle components of the early
  and late phases as displayed by the TimeNexus Viewer. Active subnetworks were extracted
  using PathLinker (pairwise method, K = 150). Enrichment results from the modEnrichR
  server for yeast were sorted according to the EnrichR combined score. Colorings
  of enrichment plots were chosen according to the colors of the first 3 (orange)
  and last 3 (blue) layers.'
