caption: Alizarin red staining of the direct co-culture of intact primary OB and transduced
  EC after 14 days of induced osteogenic differentiation. (A) Illustration of the
  Notch signaling pathway. The components of the Notch signaling pathway that were
  inhibited by lentiviral constructs are highlighted in red, while the activated components
  are shown in green. (B-C) The results of alizarin red staining after direct co-cultivation
  of OB with modified EC in the OM. The EC were previously modified 48 h prior to
  co-cultivation with OB using inhibitory (B) and activating (C) lentiviral constructs
  targeting components of the Notch signaling pathway. As a control of the lentiviral
  transduction, the shGFP vector was used, the target gene of which is not expressed
  in cells, as well as cells without viral load. (D) Quantitative assessment of the
  intensity of alizarin red staining by spectrophotometry. The results were analyzed
  using ANOVA, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ****p < 0.001 and compared them relative to
  the control co-culture there EC were transduced by shGFP, the target gene of which
  is not expressed in the EC (yellow column)
