caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating the role of repression of FGF signaling in
  inducing Dnmt3b inhibition during early development of IVF embryos. Upper panels:
  early embryonic development during preimplantation stage are supported via the synergic
  effect of autocrine and paracrine FGF signaling. Blue and red dots represent FGF2
  and FGF4 ligands, which are produced by the oviduct and embryos themselves, respectively.
  Lower panel: repression of FGF signaling underlies the mechanism responsible for
  Dnmt3b inhibition and hypomethylation in IVF embryos, MEK/ERK-SP1 pathway plays
  an essential mediating role during this process.'
