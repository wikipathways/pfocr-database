caption: A model of possible implication of MMPIs in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
  Hypothesized phases in the induction of apoptosis in response to common chemotherapeutic
  agents in ovarian cancer. In phase I, cytotoxic agents impart damage to a critical
  component of the cell such as DNA or microtubules. In phase II, the cell recognizes
  the damage through signaling mechanisms. In phase III, the cell assesses the extent
  of damage and decides the appropriate response. In most cancer cells, the preferred
  response is the induction of apoptosis, whereas the response can also involve growth
  arrest to allow for repair or senescence or terminal cell differentiation. Cancer
  cells may acquire resistance to apoptosis at several points in this pathway. MMPs
  appear to induce the irreversible phase of apoptosis. Highly selective MMPIs may
  have a complementary role in the treatment of ovarian cancer and in particular in
  patients whose tumor overexpress MMP-9.
