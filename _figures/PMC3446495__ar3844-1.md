caption: The impaired immune system in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus
  (SLE). Defective apoptotic clearance allows deposition of immune complexes which
  can stimulate B and T cells. Hyperactive B cells then produce auto-antibodies which
  activate complement, causing tissue damage. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)
  activated by immune complexes then release excessive interferon α/β (IFNα/β), again
  causing tissue damage. At each pathway, the known associated loci are indicated.
  All of the loci produce loss of both self-tolerance and autoimmunity, as seen in
  SLE. APC, antigen-presenting cell; BANK1, B-cell scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats
  1; BLK, B lymphoid tyrosine kinase; HLA-DRB1, human leukocyte antigen-DRB1; IFIH1,
  interferon-induced helicase 1; IL10, interleukin-10; IRF, interferon regulatory
  factor; ITGAM, integrin, alpha M; LYN, V-yes-1 Yamaguchi sarcoma viral-related oncogene
  homolog; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Mφ, microphage; NCF2, neutrophil
  cytosolic factor 2; PRDM1-ATG5, PR domain containing 1, with ZNF domain-autophagy-related
  5 homolog; PTPN22, protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22; RasGRP3,
  RAS guanyl releasing protein 3; STAT4, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  4; TCR, T-cell receptor; TNFAIP3, tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 3;
  TNFSF4, tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 4; TNIP1, TNFAIP3- interacting
  protein 1; UBE2L3, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2L 3.
