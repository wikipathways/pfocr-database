caption: As previously reported , , stimulation of the pathway by pheromone in opaque
  cells results in activation of the transcription factor Cph1 to induce the mating
  response (left), whereas white cells use the same pathway, but a different downstream
  transcription factor, Tec1, to promote biofilm formation in response to pheromone
  (middle). The scaffold protein Cst5 is required for both pheromone responses. Our
  present study shows that the MAP kinase pathway can also be activated in a different
  way in white cells, as by the hyperactive Ste11ΔN467 (right). This results in rewiring
  of the components, such that white cells now recruit the opaque-specific transcription
  factor Cph1 instead of Tec1 to promote a different behavioral response, switching
  to the opaque phase. Only one of the two MAP kinases, Cek1, is required for this
  response, while Cek2 is dispensable (indicated by the unfilled circle). In contrast
  to the pheromone-induced biofilm formation and mating response, Ste11-induced white-opaque
  switching does not depend on the scaffold protein Cst5. The signals that activate
  Ste11 in such an alternative way are unknown and may or may not involve the simultaneous
  presence of pheromone to induce white-opaque switching only under appropriate conditions.
  In our experiments, the upregulation of CPH1 in white cells also induced biofilm
  formation in a Tec1-dependent manner, in line with two recent studies ,  that also
  found a role for Cph1 in white cell biofilm formation (not shown in the figure).
