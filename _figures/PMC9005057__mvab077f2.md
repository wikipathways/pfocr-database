caption: 'Overview of SI-MOIRAI: tracking the anabolic trajectory and the metabolic
  fate of newly synthesized nucleotides. The SI-MOIRAI enables tracking the metabolic
  fate of ribonucleotide for RNA synthesis using a stable isotope tracer metabolite(s).
  A schematic diagram of the metabolic pathway of 13C6-glucose is depicted as an example.
  13C6-glucose is incorporated into ribonucleotides, which are further incorporated
  into r/m/tRNAs. First, total RNA is extracted and purified from the cells or tissue
  after labelling with 13C6-glucose agarose gel, followed by size separation into
  rRNA, mRNA and tRNA by gel electrophoresis. The isolated r/m/tRNAs are digested
  into mononucleotides and then nucleoside and subjected to MS analysis for quantification
  of 13C-labelled isotopomers.'
