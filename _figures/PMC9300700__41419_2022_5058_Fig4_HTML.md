caption: Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is one of the most highly expressed in Alzheimer’s Disease
  (AD) associated microglia (DAM) interacting with TREM2, TLR4 and MERTK. White matter-associated
  microglia (WAM) is also triggered by TREM2 activity but no role for Gal-3 has been
  yet uncovered. Gal-3 is found in the outer layer of the Lewy Bodies in neurons from
  Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients, whereas internalisation of alpha-synuclein (αS)
  by microglia leads to the release of Gal-3 to the extracellular matrix. In Huntington’s
  Disease (HD) Gal-3 is known to be released by microglia leading to inflammasome
  pathway activation and cytokine release. In Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Gal-3 is released
  in response to demyelinization and known to interact with TREM2. In Amyotrophic
  Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) microglia release Gal-3 which exerts a neuroprotective role,
  but no mechanism nor ligands have been identified. In Stroke, Gal-3 present a dual
  role binding to TLR4 and IGF1R to increase cytokine production and microgliosis,
  but also promoting VEGF release and angiogenesis. In Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI),
  Gal-3 is highly released after the trauma and binds to TLR4 predominantly to promote
  an intense inflammatory reaction associated to cytokine release.
