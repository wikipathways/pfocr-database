caption: miR-302s target genes are involved in the loss of epithelial phenotype. miR-302
  family are downregulated in islet-derived dedifferentiated cells respect to native
  human islets and are mainly involved in cell adhesion and motion, cell–cell signaling,
  cell growth, development and differentiation, WNT signaling pathway and insulin
  stimulus, as well as regulation of secretion. The scheme reports the entire set
  of analyzed miR-302s target genes; downregulated genes in islet-derived dedifferentiated
  cells are reported in red, while those upregulated are in green. Grey highlighted
  miR-302s target gene did not show any significant differential expression upon dedifferentiation.
