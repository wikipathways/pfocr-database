caption: Embryonic development and organization structure of TE/SJ/ mesenchymal tissue
  system. Mesenchymal tissue system consists of mesodermal-derived all kinds of cells
  (Flk+Lin-/KLF4+GMNN+) from postembryonic subtotipotent stem cells to functional
  cells in different stages of the embryonic development. In mammals, the intraembryonic
  coelom is a fluid-filled cavity with the somatic and the visceral mesoderm layers,
  which then forms TE/SJ/mesenchymal tissue system. Meanwhile, TE/SJ/mesenchymal tissue
  system constitutes the source of major organs and is the connecting pathway between
  them. It is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, tissue
  regeneration, and functional reconstruction. It also participates in human immune
  surveillance, cellular senescence and tissue metabolic.
