caption: Schematic diagram showing the proposed mechanism of the preventive effect
  of DHM against liver fibrosis via inhibiting HSCs activation by inducing autophagy
  and enhanced NK cells killing effect to HSCs through the AhR-NF-κB/STAT3- IFN-γ
  pathways. DHM attenuated CCl4-induced liver injury and fibrosis in vivo. On one
  hand, DHM-induced benefits were closely associated with the inhibition of HSCs activation
  by induction of autophagy. And on the other hand, DHM enhanced the killing effect
  of hepatic NK cells to the activated HSCs through AhR-NF-κB/STAT3-IFN-γ signaling
  pathway
