caption: 'Heterogeneity of the dermal fibroblast population. Mouse dermal fibroblasts
  exhibit variations on the cellular and molecular levels based on their distribution
  in the dermis. The two main subpopulations are (a) papillary fibroblasts in the
  most superficial layer of the dermis and (b) reticular fibroblasts in the deeper
  layer of the dermis. These fibroblasts respond to different signaling pathways (simplified
  in figure) such as Wnt and Notch pathways in the papillary fibroblasts vs. TGF-β
  pathway in the reticular fibroblasts. They are characterized by differences in their
  phenotype with distinct morphology, surface markers expression, genetic signature,
  and epigenetic modifications. Similar markers were also characterized in the human
  papillary and reticular fibroblast populations. APC: Adenomatous Polyposis Coli;
  APCs: Antigen Presenting Cells; CSL: C-promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1), suppressor
  of hairless (Su(H)), lin-12 and glp1 (Lag1); Co-A: Co-enzyme -A; Col1A1: Collagen
  type I alpha 1; DLK1: Delta-like non-canonical Notch ligand 1; Fbn1: Fibrillin 1;
