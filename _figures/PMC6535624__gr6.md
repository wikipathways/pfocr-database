caption: Model of the signaling pathway for membrane glucocorticoid receptor-induced
  endocannabinoid synthesis. The membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
  may be either the nuclear glucocorticoid receptor located at the membrane or an
  as-yet unidentified G protein-coupled receptor. Binding of glucocorticoid (GC) to
  the membrane GR triggers activation of PKA early in the pathway, upstream from PKC
  and ERK-MAPK, presumably via a Gαs-dependent mechanism (). PKA then activates a
  series of signaling molecules, including Src, PLC, PKC, IP3 receptors, and ERK-MAP
  kinase. Our data suggest that activation of PLC occurs without upstream activation
  of Gq, and that this leads to IP3 and PKC production. The glucocorticoid-induced
  endocannabinoid release also requires IP3 receptor activation and store calcium
  mobilization. The endocannabinoid synthesized by glucocorticoid activation of a
  membrane receptor is likely to be 2-AG.
