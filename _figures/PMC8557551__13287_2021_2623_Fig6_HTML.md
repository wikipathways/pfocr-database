caption: A summary diagram that leptin promotes megalin expression mediated by inhibition
  of CMA and synergistically with 25(OH)D3 to promote the osteoblast differentiation
  of rBMMSCs. As indicated by these studies, leptin inhibited the activity of CMA
  by activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote the expression of megalin, and
  then the quantity of 25(OH)D3 entering rBMMSCs was increased through increased megalin
  receptors. 25(OH)D3 was converted to 1α,25(OH)2D3 by 1α-hydroxylation of mitochondrial
  CYP27B1, and the synthesis of 1α,25(OH)2D3 was up-regulation and stimulated osteoblast
  differentiation of rBMMSCs
