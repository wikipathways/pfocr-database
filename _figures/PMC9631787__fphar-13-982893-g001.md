caption: Inflammation mechanisms of plant polysaccharides against lung injury. COVID-19
  induces lung inflammation via ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme II) receptor-mediated
  endocytosis into the airway epithelium. Plant polysaccharides have potential regulatory
  effects on MUC5AC expression, goblet cell differentiation, mucus secretion, and
  expiratory volume in 1 s percent predicted (FEV1% pred). In the TLR4/NF-κB signaling
  pathway, inflammatory cytokines can be affected by plant polysaccharides via targeting
  NF-κB. Plant polysaccharides could improve airway inflammation through the modulation
  of PERK, ATF6, and CHOP. Plant polysaccharides could decrease neutrophil levels
  and restrain NET formation. The TGF-β1 pathway can be regulated by plant polysaccharide.

  description: Inflammation mechanisms of plant polysaccharides against lung injury.
    COVID-19 induces lung inflammation via ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme II)
    receptor-mediated endocytosis into the airway epithelium. Plant polysaccharides
    have potential regulatory effects on MUC5AC expression, goblet cell differentiation,
    mucus secretion, and expiratory volume in 1 s percent predicted (FEV1% pred).
    In the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, inflammatory cytokines can be affected by
    plant polysaccharides via targeting NF-κB. Plant polysaccharides could improve
    airway inflammation through the modulation of PERK, ATF6, and CHOP. Plant polysaccharides
    could decrease neutrophil levels and restrain NET formation. The TGF-β1 pathway
    can be regulated by plant polysaccharide.
