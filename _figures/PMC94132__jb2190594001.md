caption: 'Biochemical master network with reactions for identified genes or enzyme
  activities in E. coli. The information was compiled from the EcoCyc database ()
  and other sources (, ). The reaction sets of glycolysis, the PP pathway, the TCA
  cycle (including the glyoxylate shunt), and C1 metabolism are shaded, and enzymes
  catalyzing key reactions are indicated in italics. The hatched arrow highlights
  the TCA cycle-replenishing anaplerotic reaction, and the broken arrows indicate
  the anaerobic pyruvate formate-lyase, which is interrupted in strain KO20. The grey
  arrows indicate the reactions catalyzed by the enzymes encoded on the pet operon
  of Z. mobilis. The intact carbon fragment patterns of boxed metabolites were directly
  determined by 13C-1H COSY of proteinogenic amino acids. Abbreviations: F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate; X5P, xylulose-5-phosphate; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate;
  S7P, seduheptulose-7-phosphate; PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; SER, serine; GLY, glycine;
  AAD, acetaldehyde; CIT, citrate; ICT, isocitrate; OGA, oxoglutarate; SUC, succinate;
  GOX, glyoxylate; and DH, dehydrogenase.'
