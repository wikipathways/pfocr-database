caption: Diagram showing the relationships among the regulatory factors governing
  srf transcription initiation. The srf operon as well as the regions of the srf genes
  encoding the amino-acid-activating modules of the peptide synthesis enzyme surfactin
  synthetase is shown. The comS gene, encoding the regulator of competence development,
  lies within the srfB gene of srf. Two pheromone-dependent pathways are shown. One
  pathway requires the ComX peptide which is processed by ComQ and which activates
  srf transcription through its interaction with ComP. ComP activates ComA by donating
  a phosphate, but it might also exert negative control by dephosphorylating ComA
  in the absence of ComX (see Discussion). The pheromone CSF activates srf transcription
  by inhibiting the ComA-phosphate phosphatase RapC. Import of processed, active CSF
  [CSF(act.)] requires the oligopeptide permease Spo0K. The inactive form of CSF [CSF(inact.)]
  is encoded by phrC, transcription of which requires the ςH form of RNA polymerase.
  ςH is encoded by spo0H, the transcription of which is regulated by Spo0A. Spo0A
  represses the abrB gene, which encodes a negative regulator of spo0H transcription.
