caption: (A) Workflow of integration modeling based on elastic net regression. For
  each cancertype, somatic mutation, SCNA, mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and RPPA
  protein expression data of 19 Hippo core genes, and cancer-specific predicted miRNA
  regulators were used as features to build an elastic net regression model to predict
  YAP/TAZ target score. In parallel, the modeling for cancer-type-specific significantly
  mutated genes and SCNAs were carried out. After 100 rounds of 10-fold cross-validation,
  the best model yielding the lowest mean squared error was selected, and the top
