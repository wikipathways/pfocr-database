caption: Steps in miRNA biogenesis. miRNAs are mainly transcribed by RNA polymerase
  II (RNAPII) into initial transcripts know as pre-miRNA, which are processed either
  via a canonical pathway, in which they are cropped by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex,
  or via the Mirtrons pathway, in which they are spliced to form hairpin-like miRNA
  precursors called pre-miRNAs. These precursors are exported from the nucleus to
  the cytoplasm in an Exportin-5-RanGTP—dependent manner. In the cytoplasm, they are
  processed by Dicer into an imperfect duplex comprising mature miRNAs and a complementary
  fragment called miRNA. The processed miRNAs are then loaded onto the RISC and are
  guided to their mRNA targets through interacting with various members of the Argonaute
  family such as Ago1–4 or Ago2 to form RISCs that are known as miRNP or miRISC. miRNA-mediated
  gene silencing or activation could be achieved through several identified mechanisms
  such as mRNA deadenylation, translational repression or translational activation,
  and possibly many more mechanisms yet to be discovered. Different base-paring combinations
  of miRNA-mRNA through their unique complementarities could result in gene silencing
  or gene activation.
