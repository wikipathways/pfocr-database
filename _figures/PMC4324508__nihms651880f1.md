caption: (A) The genotoxic effects of oxaliplatin comprise DNA damage, cell growth
  arrest and apoptosis. Oxaliplatin forms platinum (Pt)-DNA adducts, which in the
  presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces DNA damage and activation of
  the DNA repair pathway genes (including ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related [ATR]
  kinase, p53, BAX, FAS, RB1, CDKN1A) resulting in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis
  (). In the absence of microbiota, myeloid cells fail to produce NADPH oxidase (NOX2)-dependent
  ROS following oxaliplatin treatment and minimal DNA damage is observed (). (B) The
  presence of gut commensal microbiota is required for tumor-associated myeloid cells
  to respond to intratumoral injection of the TLR9-agonist CpG-ODN with production
  of TNF and IL12 (which induces IFNγ production primarily from NK and T cells in
  the tumor microenvironment) and induction of tumor hemorrhagic necrosis (). Treatments
  with (C) cyclophosphamide (CTX) and (D) total body irradiation (TBI; used as part
  of the myeloablative conditioning regimen that augments the effectiveness of adoptive
  T-cell transfer therapy) induce mucosal damage, dysbiosis, and transmucosal bacterial
  translocation (, ). This altered exposure to intestinal bacteria increases the ability
  of tumor-associated myeloid cells to sustain CTL generation and/or expansion and
  antitumor cytotoxicity (). In CTX therapy, drug-induced immunogenic tumor-cell death
  releases danger signal HMGB1, which binds to pattern recognition receptor TLR4 activating
  inflammasome processing and production of IL1β, resulting in the induction of antitumor
  “pathogenic” Th17 (pTh17) cells and the downstream activation of memory Th1 cells
  and antitumor effector CTLs. In the absence of microbiota, induction of T effector
  and memory cells are not observed (). (E) Treatment of mice with LPS conditions
  the myeloid cells for response to CpG-ODN and adoptive T-cell transfer even in the
  absence of the microbiota (, ). Blue bolts signify conditioning effect on myeloid
  cells.
