caption: Quercetin-mediated signaling pathway in the regulation of acute pancreatitis.
  This figure illustrates how quercetin modulates the molecular pathways involved
  in AP. It begins by activating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), initiating a cascade
  of signaling events involving molecules such as protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2), and c-Jun. These molecules subsequently interact
  with nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1),
  influencing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis
  factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and inducible
  nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Quercetin also attenuates nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)
  activation by inhibiting inhibitor of kappa B-alpha (IκBα), leading to reduced expression
  of inflammation-related genes. Additionally, quercetin activates peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), which mediates anti-inflammatory effects. This figure highlights
  the key molecular processes through which quercetin mitigates inflammation in AP
