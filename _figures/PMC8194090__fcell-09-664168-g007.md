caption: The Notch signaling pathway in chondrocytes. When Notch signaling is produced,
  Notch ligand of adjacent cells bind to Notch receptor, then the receptor is cleaved
  by γ-secretase to release the NICD. Next, NICD enters the nucleus and interact with
  RBPjk to induce the target genes expression (Hes and Hey). Afterward, the expression
  of Sox9 is inhibited, whereas the expression of Runx2 is increased. Besides, Notch
  also can induce the expression of p57 via BMP/Smad signaling to promote chondrocyte
  hypertrophy and suppress chondrocyte proliferation.
