caption: SFRP2 and noncanonical Wnt signaling. a The Wnt/PCP pathway is characterized
  by the recruitment of DvL upon Wnt binding. Via two parallel signaling pathways,
  ROCK and JNK become activated. b In the Wnt/Ca2+pathway, a cascade via several molecules
  eventually leads to the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. In turn,
  this activates calcineurin to dephosphorylate NFAT and regulates gene transcription.
