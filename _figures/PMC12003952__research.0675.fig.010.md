caption: PLEVPs deliver pab-miR396a-5p to mediate down-regulation of the IL-17 signaling
  pathway. Upon PLEVPs treatment, pab-miR396a-5p is delivered into keratinocytes,
  where it targets and down-regulates HSP90 mRNA. This down-regulation inhibits both
  the JAK2/STAT3 and NF-κB (p65) signaling pathways. Inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3
  pathway can reduce the production of CXCL10, IL-6, and IL-23, while suppression
  of the NF-κB pathway decreases TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β levels. Together, these effects
  lead to the down-regulation of IL-17 signaling, reducing the expression of IL-17a,
  IL-22, and CXCL5, ultimately resulting in decreased inflammation and keratinocyte
  proliferation
