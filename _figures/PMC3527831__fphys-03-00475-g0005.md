caption: Scaffold proteins and specificity in the yeast MAPK pathway. The mating response
  (A), filamentous growth response (B), and osmotic stress response (C) pathways all
  share the MAP3K Ste11. In the osmotic stress response, Pbs2 acts as a scaffold and
  also a MAP2K of the pathway at the same time. The mating response and filamentous
  growth pathways both share MAP2K Ste11 and MAP3K Ste7. Specificity occurs through
  the scaffold Ste5, which is required for the activation of Fus3 during the mating
  response. However there may be accidental activation of Kss1 during the mating response
  and further specification can be achieved by a negative feedback. The filamentous
  growth pathway possibly does not require a scaffold. Signal flow is shown by black
  arrows and red T shaped bar indicates inhibition.
