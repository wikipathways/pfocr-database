caption: 'Newly synthesized FGFR1 can enter either the constitutive membrane pathway
  or regulated nuclear pathway in membrane pathway the receptor is processed and glycosylated
  in Golgi and accumulates in plasma membrane. In the nuclear pathway, an atypical
  transmembrane domain in FGFR1 allows newly translated immobile receptor to be released
  from the pre‐Golgi membrane into cytosol generating a highly mobile protein in a
  process that involves proteasomes and is facilitated by the FGF‐2 ligand, and ribosomal
  S6 kinase (Dunham‐Ems et al., , ). The nuclear transport of FGFR1 is mediated by
  importin‐β (Reilly and Maher, ). The nuclear accumulation of the hypoglycosylated
  nuclear form of FGFR1 (nFGFR1) is stimulated by a variety of developmental signals,
  including various growth factors (i.e., EGF, NGF, BDNF, BMP), vitamins D and retinoids,
  hormones, and neurotransmitters, calcium, cyclic AMP, and is inhibited by cell contact
  receptors. This is the reason that this pathway is referred to as integrative signaling
  (Stachowiak et al., ). FRET and co‐immunoprecipitation assays show that the NLS
  containing 23 kDa FGF‐2 interacts with nFGFR1 during nuclear transport and in the
  nucleus while, 18 kDa FGF‐2, which lacks a bipartite NLS, interacts with FGFR1 only
  in the cytoplasm (Dunham‐Ems et al., ). Biophotonic assays, including FLIP and FRAP,
  have demonstrated that cytoplasmic FGFR1 exists in three separate populations: (1)
  an immobile, newly synthesized Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) population; (2) a highly
  mobile, non‐glycosylated, cytosolic population; and (3) a slowly diffusing, membrane
  receptor population (Dunham‐Ems et al., ). Nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 in live
  cells is promoted by an accelerated cytoplasmic to nuclear import, as well by as
  a reduced nuclear to cytoplasmic export (Lee et al., , ; Stachowiak et al., ). In
  addition, activation of cell surface FGFR1 by FGF‐2 induces FGFR1 internalization,
  which is dependent upon the ARF6, Dynamin2 and Rab5 endocytic machinery, and is
  inhibited by cell surface E‐cadherin adhesion complexes (Bryant and Stow, ). Once
  internalized, FGFR1 may be released from endosomes, or trafficked in a retrograde
  fashion to the ER/Golgi for cytoplasmic release via the RSK1‐associated pathway.'
