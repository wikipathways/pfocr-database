caption: Sugar sensing and signaling in S. cerevisiae. The sugar-sensing network in
  S. cerevisiae. The faded arrows and proteins represent the situation when sugars
  are absent. All proteins are represented as circles. Activation is represented with
  green arrows, while red arrows indicate inhibition. When the ScSnf3/ScRgt2 receptors
  sense glucose, ScYck1 phosphorylates ScStd1 and ScMth1. These are subsequently ubiquitinated
  by ScGrr1 and broken down by the proteasome. In the absence of glucose, they function
  together with ScRgt1 to repress transcription of the ScHXT genes. The ScHxt transporters
  allow glucose to enter the cells after which this monosaccharide is converted to
  pyruvate during glycolysis. One of the intermediates of this pathway is fructose
  1,6 bisphosphate which is found to activate ScCdc25. In this way, ScCdc25 allows
  the exchange of GDP to GTP on the ScRas proteins. ScRas is now activated and stimulates
  ScCyr1. Next to activation by ScRas, ScCyr1 needs the stimulus coming from ScGpr1
  to be fully activated. ScGpr1 is activated by sensing extracellular glucose which
  allows the exchange of GDP to GTP on the ScGpa2 proteins. ScGpa2-GTP activates ScCyr1.
  ATP is converted into cAMP after complete activation of ScCyr1. cAMP binds to the
  regulatory subunits of PKA (Bcy1) thereby causing them to release the catalytic
  subunits (ScTpk1, 2, and 3) causing PKA activation. The absence of glucose triggers
  the phosphorylation of ScSnf1 by ScSak1, ScElm1, and ScTos3. The activated ScSnf1
  protein phosphorylates ScMig1, preventing this protein to enter the nucleus. In
  the presence of glucose, both ScSnf1 and ScMig1 are dephosphorylated by ScReg1,
  allowing ScMig1 to enter the nucleus and function as a transcriptional repressor
  of the ScGAL genes and ScMTH1. When galactose is present (in the absence of glucose),
  it can enter the cells via the ScGal2 permease. Galactose can bind to ScGal3, which
  sequesters ScGal80 and prevents the latter to bind ScGal4. ScGal4 can thereby actively
  function in the nucleus as a transcription factor, inducing the expression of the
  ScGAL genes and of ScMTH1.
