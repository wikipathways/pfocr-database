caption: ‘Unfolded protein response pathway’ was generated in IPA, and overlaid with
  FDR values and FC values calculated from comparing gene expression levels in PC3
  and ARCaP(M) cells grown alone or in Transwell co-culture with adipocytes. Analyses
  were performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA; QIAGEN Bioinformatics,
  Redwood City, CA) using RefSeq IDs as identifiers. IPA-generated pathways were analyzed
  with a Right-Tailed Fisher’s Exact Test. Genes with an outer pink border are significantly
  regulated in our dataset, filled-in shape indicates up-regulated genes (red) and
  down-regulated genes (green) with darker colors being higher expression ratios.
  Shapes represent the category of the pathway components (complex, enzyme kinase,
  etc.) and lines represent direct interaction (solid line) and indirect interaction
  (dashed line) between molecules.
