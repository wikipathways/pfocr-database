caption: Pro-inflammatory pathways in microglia. (A) TNF-α receptor activation, induces
  the canonical pro-inflammatory transcriptional factors such as NFκB and subsequent
  production of inflammatory mediators. This pathway can be inhibited by Infliximab.
  (B) TLR4 ligands and secreted Gal-3 directly bind to TLR4 on the microglial surface
  and exacerbates inflammatory responses through induction of different cytokines
  and chemokines. This pathway can be inhibited by Ibudilast. (C) Activation of INF-γ
  receptor on microglia triggers the overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase
  (iNOS) and overproduction of nitric oxide via Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT)/RIF-1 pathway. Corticosteroids can suppress
  this pathway at the level of STAT factors. (D) IL-6 trans-signaling occurs in brain
  cell types that have membrane bound gp130, including microglia. IL-6 bound to soluble
  IL-6R activates signaling through membrane bound gp130. This trans-signaling is
  thought to be pro-inflammatory via the induction of JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling
  pathways. Tocilizumab inhibits this pro-inflammatory pathway. TNF-α, tumor necrosis
