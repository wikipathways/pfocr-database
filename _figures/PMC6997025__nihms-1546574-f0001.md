caption: Model for the cellular mechanisms underlying the rapid and sustained antidepressant
  actions of ketamine. Ketamine blockade of NMDARs on GABAergic interneurons results
  in disinhibition and a rapid glutamate burst that activates AMPARs. This leads to
  activation of L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) and Ca2+ influx that
  stimulates BDNF and VEGF release. BDNF and VEGF stimulate TrkB and Flk-1, respectively.
  Activation of TrkB and Flk-1 stimulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway which controls
  the translation and synthesis of synaptic proteins, including GluA1 and PSD95, that
  are required for increases in synaptogenesis and spine maturation. These cellular
  events are associated with the rapid and sustained antidepressant behavioral actions
  of ketamine. ADT, antidepressant; GABAAR, GABAA receptor.
