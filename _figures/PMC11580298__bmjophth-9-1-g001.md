caption: 'Study pipeline. This study contained two parts: the biomarker analysis and
  the drug–target analysis. The biomarker analysis came from downloading and integrating
  biomarkers–diseases interaction information to construct the human disease–biomarker
  interactions network (HDBIN). Then the greedy search was implemented to find the
  glaucoma-related hub diseases-biomarkers interaction network (GHDBIN). Several close
  diseases were found on the GHDBIN, and we used genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
  data from GWAS Catalog, text data from PubMed and epidemiology data from UK Biobank
  to verify the result. Based on the GHDBIN, we extracted the glaucoma hub biomarker
  network (GHBN). Further, the application information collected from PubMed and protein–protein
  interaction (PPI) information from STRING were added to the hub biomarker network.
  Gene expression data from GEO was used to verify the diagnosis value of hub biomarkers.
  Further, biological functional analysis was conducted to find key pathways for glaucoma
  hub biomarkers. The drug–target analysis started with constructing the human disease–target–drug
  interactions network (HDTDIN), and the glaucoma hub targets network (GHTN) was selected
  by the greedy form HDTDIN. PPI information was also annotated to GHTN and critical
  pathways for glaucoma drug targets were identified (cGMP-PKG signalling pathway,
