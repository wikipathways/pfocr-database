caption: Representation of secondary metabolic pathway genes and tissue specific expression
  in response to MeJA and wounding in Bacopa monnieri. Systematic representation of
  the cytoplasmic mevalonic acid pathway, phenylpropanoid and monolignoid biosynthesis
  pathway genes. Enzymes were highlighted and marked according to their tissue specific
  expression in the shoot and root tissue along with their up-regulation after exogenous
  MeJA application and Wounding in Bacopa monnieri. The relative expression of selected
  transcripts were represented in comparison to actin and ubiquitin taken as an internal
  control

  monnieri identifies potential genes related to triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis.
