caption: Diagrammatic representations of Kir2.1 channel–mediated regulation of the
  direction of EPC differentiation. After the Kir2.1 channel is inhibited, EPC depolarization
  is induced, and autophagy is then induced, promoting EPC differentiation into ECs.
  In contrast, if the Kir2.1 channel is agitated, EPC hyperpolarization is promoted,
  and the Akt/mTOR/Snail signalling pathway is excited, inducing the transdifferentiation
  of EPCs into mesenchymal cells (pericytes) and moderating/maintaining stem cell
  stemness
