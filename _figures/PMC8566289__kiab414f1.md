caption: Schematic summarizing the current state of knowledge on the role of pH and
  increased Fe-uptake efficiency with a focus on IRONMAN (IMA) peptides and coumarins.
  Plants under Fe-deficiency, when faced with acidic pH, favor the reduction-based
  FRO2-IRT1-mediated Fe-uptake strategy (Blue square).  show IMA1/IMA2ox mediates
  synthesis and secretion of the coumarin sideretin via increased expression of CYTOCHROME
  P450 FAMILY 82 SUBFAMILY C POLYPEPTIDE4 (CYP82C4), required for conversion of fraxetin
  to sideretin. Under alkaline conditions, the FRO2-IRT1 system is inactive, and the
  IMA1/IMA2 driven increased synthesis and secretion of coumarin fraxetin is favored
  via induction of MYB72 mediated phenylpropionate pathway and repression of CYP82C2.
  The secretion of coumarins is known to be facilitated by the coumarin exporter PLEIOTROPIC
  DRUG RESISTANCE9 (PDR9). Modified from Figure 7 of .
