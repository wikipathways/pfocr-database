caption: 'Citrate fate in cancer cells. Enzymes are indicated in pink (active) or
  brown (inactive). Metabolites are in yellow (intracellular) or green (when uptaken
  from the extracellular environment). Key cellular processes are in light green.
  Specific regulators of protein activities are indicated in blue (activators) or
  red (inhibitors). Arrow size is proportional to pathway engagement (in gray if the
  pathway is not active). Differences in glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP production
  are highlighted using a different font size. Small ATP and NAD(P)H boxes (not originating
  from an arrow) indicate their requirement to sustain the corresponding cellular
  processes (FAS from acetyl-CoA, 3-PG to G3P conversion, and GAPDH activity). On
  the left side, the functioning of cells relying on the Warburg effect is summarized.
  Glucose is channelled into glycolysis to produce ATP. Moreover, a portion of glycolytic
  intermediates is diverted toward the PPP and the serine one-carbon metabolism to
  sustain nucleotide synthesis. Since pyruvate is preferentially transformed by LDHA
  into lactate (with regeneration of NAD+ required for GAPDH functioning), it poorly
  supports the generation of citrate from acetyl-CoA and OAA in mitochondria. Consequently,
  citrate can be derived mainly from glutamine via AKG. Moreover, citrate is rapidly
  converted by ACLY into OAA (sustaining nucleotide synthesis and/or being recycled
  into malate and pyruvate) and acetyl-CoA (sustaining lipid synthesis and histone
  acetylation). On the right side, the functioning of cells relying on oxidative metabolism
  is depicted, in particular FAO, a condition observed especially in case of glucose
  deprivation. High levels of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA (derived from FAO) and OAA
  (derived from various carbon sources being converted into pyruvate) sustains the
  production of high levels of citrate. Citrate is used to a minor extent in the TCA
  cycle to support ATP synthesis, and it is mainly exported in the cytosol to sustain
  the synthesis of nucleotides and de novo FAS, as seen in glucose-based cancer cells.
  However, cytosolic OAA can be also diverted towards the production of PEP to feed
  gluconeogenesis. The latter pathway is required to support nucleotide synthesis
  via PPP and serine one-carbon metabolism. Of note, oscillatory levels of citrate
  may promote futile cycles, such as the alternance between glycolysis (when citrate
  is low) and gluconeogenesis (when citrate is high) or between FAO (promoted by low
  citrate via low malonate levels) and FAS (promoted by high citrate via high malonate
  levels). Furthermore, high consumption of citrate to sustain biosynthesis can induce
  a low citrate level, promoting a truncated gluconeogenesis due to FBPase inactivation
  (not figured). Abbreviations: ACLY: ATP citrate lyase, AKG: α-ketoglutarate (also
