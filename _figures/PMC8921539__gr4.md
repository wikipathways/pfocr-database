caption: 'Schema of the effects and mechanisms of drugs targeting hypoxia in CKD.
  Under normoxic conditions, the prolyl residues of HIF-α are hydroxylated by PHDs.
  Hydroxylated HIF-α is recognized by the vHL protein and then undergoes ubiquitination
  and degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Under hypoxic conditions,
  the above processes are inhibited, and HIF-α accumulates and translocates to the
  nucleus, thus increasing the expression of the EPO gene and other genes involved
  in iron metabolism. HIF-PHIs are stabilizers of HIF-PHDs and have multiple effects
  on CKD. SGLT2 inhibition attenuates the proximal tubular workload, normalizes tubuloglomerular
  feedback, and reduces glomerular hyperfiltration, thus reducing oxygen consumption
  and improving tissue oxygenation. SGLT2 blockade shifts some of the transport burden
  downstream to S3 segments, thick ascending limbs, and collecting ducts, reducing
  the oxygen partial pressure in the deep cortex and outer medulla, which may mimic
  systemic hypoxia and then activate the HIF pathway. Under unstressed conditions,
  Nrf2 is bound to Keap1 and subsequently degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway.
  In response to stress, Keap1 is inactivated, resulting in the activation and translocation
  of Nrf2 to the nucleus. Nrf2 binds to the ARE and activates the transcription of
  its target genes. Abbreviations: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase
