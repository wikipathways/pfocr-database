caption: 'Main signaling pathways elicited by the activation of the long and short
  prolactin receptor isoforms.The action of prolactin (PRL) is initiated by its binding
  to a prolactin receptor (PRLR) homodimer, forming a heterotrimeric complex. PRL
  binding to the long form of PRLR triggers distinct signaling cascades that ultimately
  culminate in the regulation of gene transcription. The main activation pathway of
  PRL is the JAK/STAT pathway, but prolactin is also able to induce the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  The MAPK/ERK is another signaling pathway triggered by prolactin binding to both
  PRLR isoforms. The activation of this pathway involves the SHC, Grb2, SOS, Ras and
  Raf cascades. It is also believed that the activation of the PRLR-short form inhibits
  the expression of FOXO3 and Galt, involved in the metabolism of galactose to glucose,
  possibly leading to developmental defects. However, the exact mechanism of action
  of this pathway remains unidentified. AKT: Protein kinase B; ERK: extracellular
  signal regulated kinase; FOXO3: forkhead transcription factor 3; Galt: galactose-1-phosphate
  uridyltransferase; Grb2: growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; JAK2: Janus kinase
  2; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK: MAPK kinase; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; Raf: rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; Ras: Rat sarcoma; SHC: SHC-transforming
  protein 1; SOS: son of sevenless; Src: proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src;
  STAT5: signal transducer and activator of transcription 5.'
