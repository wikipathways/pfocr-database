caption: 'Proposed model of fungal-plant interaction under heat stress (HS). The model
  was done using gathered information of in vitro L. theobromae HS global transcriptional
  response, gene expression in planta (Fig. ) and documented HS response in plant.
  a When fungus infects unstressed plant, selectively degrades pectin (up-regulation
  of PL compared with the other PCWDEs), this allows it to growth in intercellular
  spaces without causing major damage to PCW. The presence of the pathogen could trigger
  the host defensive mechanism mediated through SA, or by the activation of the phenylpropanoid
  pathway. However, the host defense could be impaired for the activity of SH and
  IRCD (degrade SA), or by HPPD (phenylpropanoid precursors). b Heat stress activates
  the same metabolic pathways increasing SA and the levels of phenylpropanoid precursors,
  thus the fungus could benefit from the higher availability of compounds using them
  as carbon sources. The main differential change on stressed plant, compared with
  unstressed, is the up-regulation of SH, FMH and XGH, whose activities could facilitate
  fungal colonization. Tyr: tyrosine. Phe: phenylalanine. SA: salicylic acid, IRCD:
  intradiol-ring cleavage dioxygenase (comp4276_c0_seq1); SH: salicylate hydroxylase
  (comp12473_c0_seq1); FMH: fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (comp14342_c0_seq1); SIT:sugar
  inositol transporter (comp8181_c0_seq1); PL: pectate lyase (comp16237_c0_seq1).

  dioxygenase (comp18638_c0_seq1). FCW: fungal cell wall. PCW: plant cell wall; PCWDEs:
