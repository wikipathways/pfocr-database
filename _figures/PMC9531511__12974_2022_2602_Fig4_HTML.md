caption: Interactions between the cGAS–STING pathway and ferroptosis. Loss of GPX4
  function, either directly or indirectly, is currently thought to be the key event
  leading to the onset of ferroptosis. In addition, GPX4 is needed for activation
  of the cGAS–STING pathway. GPX4 deficiency enhances lipid peroxidation, which promotes
  STING carbonylation and inhibits its translocation from the ER to the Golgi complex
