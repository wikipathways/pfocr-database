caption: A schematic representation of the UPR in response to ERS. The UPR signaling
  pathways are initiated upon the accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins
  in the ER, leading to the displacement of GRP78 from PERK, ATF6, and IRE1. This
  triggers downstream signaling cascades. PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, resulting in
  increased ER protein accumulation and decreased ATF4 mRNA translation. Subsequently,
  ATF4 interacts with CHOP to regulate the expression of target genes such as GADD34
  and ERO-1α. GADD34 encodes a regulatory subunit of the eIF2α-directed phosphatase
  complex that dephosphorylates eIF2α and restores protein synthesis. The PERK pathway
  is well-known for its ability to induce apoptosis. During ERS, IRE1 undergoes dimerization
  and activation. Activated IRE1 removes an intron from XBP1, leading to the production
  of XBP1s, which is then transported into the nucleus, where it facilitates gene
  translation. Upon ERS, ATF6 translocates to the Golgi apparatus where it undergoes
  cleavage by S1P and S2P enzymes. This cleavage generates cytosolic fragment ATF6f
  which directly controls basal transcription of genes encoding ERAD components including
  members of bZip family as well as XBP1. This figure is created with BioRender.com. Abbreviations
