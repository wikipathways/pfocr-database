caption: 'Schematic representation of β-adrenergic receptor (AR)-mediated induction
  of protein kinase A (PKA) and PKG downstream Gs and Gi protein activation. β1-,
  β2-, β3-, and the putative β4-AR are coupled to the stimulatory G proteins (Gs),
  while only β2- and β3-AR are also coupled to the inhibitory G proteins (Gi). Upon
  ligand binding (catecholamine, CA), Gs proteins activate the adenylate cyclase (AC)
  on the plasma membrane leading to the generation of Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate
  (cAMP), with subsequent activation of PKA, that in turn phosphorylates several key
  factors, including the PKB (Akt), with the subsequent activation of the endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Of note, eNOS activation increases the generation
  of NO that stimulates the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to produce cGMP and PKG
  activation. Notably, following the Gi signaling pathway activation, β2- and β3-AR
  can give rise to NO via both eNOS and neuronal NOS (nNOS), thus leading to PKG induction.
  Gs—pathway in orange; Gi—pathway in green. Black arrows: Gs and Gi pathway.'
