caption: a Interference with either DNA-PKcs or miR-1193 alone did not reduce the
  viability of cancer cells, while cell death was achieved by combined abolition of
  DNA-PKcs and miR-1193. b Function loss of DNA-PKcs resulted in dysregulation of
  the NHEJ-mediated DSB repair pathway (left panel). Inhibition of miR-1193 led to
  blockade of the FEN1-mediated HR/MMEJ repair pathway (middle panel). Combined abolition
  of DNA-PKcs and miR-1193 promoted DSB repair deficiency and induced apoptosis regulated
  by the ATR/CHK1/p53 axis (right panel).
