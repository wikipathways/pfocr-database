caption: A Proposed Model of Seed Germination Mediated by MFT.ABA regulates MFT expression
  via ABI3 and ABI5 with the former acting as a repressor and the latter as a promoter.
  MFT confers negative feedback regulation of the ABA signaling pathway through directly
  repressing ABI5. On the other hand, GA downregulates MFT expression and inhibits
  ABA synthesis via DELLA proteins (i.e., RGL2). Therefore, MFT serves as a mediator
  in response to ABA and GA signals to promote seed germination through constituting
  a negative feedback regulation of ABA signaling. Asterisks represent direct transcriptional
  regulation.[See online article for color version of this figure.]
