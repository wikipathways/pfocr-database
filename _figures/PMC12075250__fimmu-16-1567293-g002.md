caption: AECAs pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory effects in ECs. On the left, AECAs
  regulate mitochondrial pathway-mediated apoptosis through NO and HSP60 production.
  When ECs are injured, HSP60 is located on the plasma membrane and separated from
  Bax. With the decrease of HSP60, Bax moves from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria
  and is accompanied by the release of Cytoc, which activates caspase-3 and induces
  apoptosis in ECs. FcγRШ mediates NK cells, binds to AECAs and directly kills antibody-linked
  target cells. AECAs causes ECs apoptosis through Fas/FasL interaction. Upon binding
  of Fas to its cognate ligand FasL, Fas is recruited in the cytoplasm via the death
  domain of the intracellular FADD and caspase-8-associated Fas, forming a death-inducing
  signaling complex consisting of Fas, FADD and caspase-8, which activates caspase-3
  and ultimately leads to apoptosis. On the right, AECAs interact with ECs antigens
  and activate IKK. Activated IKK phosphorylates IκB protein and induces ubiquitination
  and degradation of IκB, which subsequently leads to NF-κB activation. After NF-κB
  translocation into the nucleus, the expression of IL-1, TNF-α, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1
  is upregulated (AECAs, anti-endothelial cell antibodies; ECs, endothelial cells;
