caption: 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling. Canonical:
  Stat3 is tyrosine phosphorylated by Janus kinase (Jak) kinases in response to cytokine/growth
  factor activation of cell surface receptors (eg, receptor tyrosine kinases [RTKs],
  glycoprotein 130 [gp130] with either interleukin-6 receptor [IL-6R] or soluble IL-6R
  [sIL-6R]). On tyrosine phosphorylation (PY), Stat3 dimerizes and localizes to the
  nucleus, where it binds to Stat3 responsive elements. Stat3 is also serine phosphorylated
  (PS). Soluble factors that activate Stat3 include the IL-6 family of cytokines.
  Noncanonical: Unphosphorylated Stat3 can bind to either nuclear factor κB (NFκB)
  or CD44 in the cytoplasm; the complexes translocate into the nucleus, where they
  bind NFκB (IKE) and Stat3 DNA-binding elements. Acetylated Stat3 is required for
  association with CD44. PS Stat3 and PY Stat3 can also localize into the mitochondria,
  where they modulate ATP production. Agents to inhibit the Stat3 canonical pathway
  include targeting Jak (CEP-701, XL019, INCB018424, AZD1480) and the IL-6/sIL-6R
  interaction (tocilizumab, CNTO-328). HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone
  deacetylase; ISRE, interferon stimulated response element; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PIAS, protein inhibitors of
  activated Stat; SOCS, suppressor of cytokin signaling.'
