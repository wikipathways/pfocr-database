caption: WNV infection is sensed by PRR from the RLR family (RIG-I and MDA5, green)
  or TLR family (TLR3 and TLR7, yellow and orange). PRR signal through their respective
  adaptor molecules (MAVS, TRIF, MyD88), which activates cellular kinases (TBK1, IKKε,
  TRAF6, IRAK1). Phosphorylation of IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7 (blue) induces nuclear
  localization, and in concert with other transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB), results
  in induced expression of Ifnb and ISGs. IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7 are each sufficient
  to induce expression of IFN-β (red), which can signal through IFNAR to activate
  expression of hundreds of ISGs (pink). Some ISGs, including Ifna, Oas1a, and Pkr,
  are dependent strictly upon IFN signaling for their induction. Others, including
  Ifit1, Ifit2, Rsad2, and Cxcl10, can be induced directly by IRF-3, although IRF-5
  apparently is not sufficient to induce these genes independently of IFN signaling.
  In addition to being activated by TLR7 signaling through MyD88, IRF-5 is activated
  by MAVS through an uncharacterized pathway.
