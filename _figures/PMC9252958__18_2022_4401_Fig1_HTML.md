caption: Ceramide metabolism in mammals. Schematic representation of the ceramide
  metabolic pathway highlighting critical enzymes involved in ceramide turnover and
  their respective inhibitors. Six different ceramide synthases (CerS1-6) produce
  (dihydro)ceramides of varying acyl chain lengths by catalyzing the N-acylation of
  sphinganine (derived from the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA; de novo
  pathway; highlighted in orange) or sphingosine (derived from sphingolipid breakdown;
  salvage pathway; highlighted in green) with a fatty acyl chain of defined length
  within the range C14–C26. Ceramides can also be derived from the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin
  (highlighted in purple). Ceramides serve as substrates for more complex sphingolipid
  species such as glucosylceramides and galactosylceramides, which can be further
  modified. Ceramides can also be converted to acylceramide species bearing an additional
  acyl chain at the 1-hydroxy position. ACSL5 Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family
