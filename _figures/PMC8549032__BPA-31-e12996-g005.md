caption: Interactomes of the dysregulated cytoskeletal, membrane, and synaptic (phospho)proteins
  in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and frontal cortex area 8 (FC) at different stages
  of NFT pathology (stages I–II, III–IV, and V–VI of Braak). A large number of (phospho)proteins
  are dysregulated at the first stages (I–II) in the EC and FC. Most dysregulation
  occurs at the middle stages (III–IV) of AD‐related pathology. Dysregulated proteins
  were artificially combined with proteins linked to β‐amyloid formation (red balls),
  including β‐amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2),
  β‐secretase 1 (BACE1), BACE 2, apolipoprotein E (ApoE4), aph‐1 homolog A γ‐secretase
  subunit (APH1A), APH1B, nicastrin (NCT/NCSTN), presenilin enhancer γ‐secretase subunit
  (PEN2/PSENEN), neprilysin (NEP/MME), and insulin‐degrading enzyme (IDE). Close interactions
  between the proteins of the membranes and cytoskeleton, and proteins of the β‐amyloidogenic
  pathway, are depicted. The endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins reticulon 3 (RTN3)
  and reticulon 4 (RTN4) (arrows) are constant elements in all the stages and regions
