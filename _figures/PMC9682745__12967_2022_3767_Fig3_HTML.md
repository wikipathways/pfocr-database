caption: 'Cytokine storm: Molecular mechanism and potential therapeutics in COVID-19.
  Lung infection by SARS-CoV-2 leads to production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines
  by innate immune cells. The combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon
  (IFN)-γ activates PANoptosis leading to a cytokine storm loop, which further potentiates
  cytokine release and perpetuates PANoptosis. This positive feedback loop can result
  in systemic inflammation, multiorgan failure, and lethality. Synergism of TNF and
  IFN-γ activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling
  and induces expression of IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), which regulates inducible
  nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) for nitric oxide (NO) production. This pathway leads
  to the induction of PANoptosis, which is regulated through a multiprotein complex
  called the PANoptosome. Based on the molecular mechanisms engaged by TNF and IFN-γ
  for the activation of PANoptosis, several drugs can potentially be repurposed for
  COVID-19 treatment'
