caption: '(a) Chemical structure of d‐pinitol (DPIN, C7H14O6) and d‐chiro‐inositol:
  its 3‐O‐methyl form obtained by acid hydrolysis in the stomach. (b) Schematic diagram
  depicting the signalling of the protein kinase B (Akt) pathway via insulin receptor
  substrate 1 (IRS‐1). Physiological growth factors, such as insulin, bind to its
  tyrosine kinase‐like receptor (RTK) in the cell membrane. An insulin‐receptor complex
  is formed, and this causes a conformational change in the receptor itself. The two
  intracellular domains phosphorylate each other by modifying their kinase activity
  and, therefore, the affinity of the two domains to other substrates. The adapter
  IRS‐1 bind now the phosphorylated receptor. The p85 regulatory domain of the Phosphatidylinositol‐3‐kinase
  (PI3K) (p85‐PI3K) binds the phosphorylated domains of IRS‐1, activating PI3K leading
  to phosphorylated Akt. Then, Akt inhibits by phosphorylation the glycogen synthase
  kinase‐3 beta (GSK‐3β). When inactive, GSK‐3β is not able to phosphorylate, and
  this activates the enzyme glycogen synthase (GS). Also, the inhibition of the kinase
  GSK‐3β will contribute to the reduction of phosphorylation on tau protein, decreasing
  the hyperphosphorylation and therefore the aggregation of tau. Akt also activates
  by phosphorylation the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to increase protein
  synthesis. Additionally, mTOR inhibits autophagy by several mechanisms. (c) Schematic
  representation of tau phosphorylation due to the disfunction of the Akt‐GSK‐3β pathway.
  In physiological conditions, Akt is phosphorylated and, therefore activated. This
  is known to result in the inactivation of GSK‐3β through its phosphorylation at
  S9. However, in a pathological condition, such as brain insulin resistance, Akt
  activates the kinase GSK‐3β, which in turn, phosphorylates tau in proline‐rich region.
  When tau protein is hyperphosphorylated (i), it dissociates from the microtubule
  (ii) and forms insoluble aggregates called neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in neurons
  and glial cells (iii). Both the destabilization of the microtubule and the aggregation
  of NFTs could lead to cell apoptosis. The domain structure of the longest isoform
  of human tau is shown below. It differs from other isoforms in the presence or absence
  of two N‐terminal domains (encoded by exons E2 and E3) and one of the repeats in
  the microtubule binding domain (R2 encoded by exon E10). The projection domain includes
  an acidic and a proline‐rich region, and interacts with cytoskeletal elements and
  neural plasma membrane. This N‐terminal part is also involved in signal transduction
  pathways by interacting with proteins such as the cyclin‐dependent kinase 5 (CDK5).
  The C‐terminal microtubules binding domain, is where tau binds microtubules through
  repetitive regions, regulating the rate of microtubules polymerization, and also
  binding with other functional proteins such as protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). We
  used the AT8 antibody that recognizes phosphorylated tau in S202 and T205 epitopes;
  the AT100, recognizing phosphorylated tau in S214 and T212 epitopes; and the E7G5W,
  recognizing phosphorylated tau in S235 and T231 epitopes.'
