caption: 'Circadian regulation of complement immune system. The stepwise schema of
  three different Complement cascade pathways originating from three different stimuli
  is depicted in the top panel. (1) The classical pathway is being activated by antigen
  (from pathogens or self-antigens) and antibody (IgM and IgG) interaction, leading
  to activation of C3. (2) The Lectin pathway recognizes pathogen-associated carbohydrate
  moieties via lectins, and leading to activation of C3, by classical C3 convertase.
  (3) The alternate complement pathway is activated through spontaneous hydrolysis
  of C3 and binding of C3b to the pathogens or self-antigens directly to further activate
  C3, by C3 convertase. C3 activation to generate C5 convertase, thereby activating
  Membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. C3a and C5a are the two anaphylatoxins
  that signal through their respective receptors, C3aR and C5aR1 on myeloid and non-myeloid
  cells, and enhance inflammation and chemotaxis. These inflammatory pathways are
  tightly regulated under normal physiological conditions by circadian Clock:BMAL1
  regulated signaling, that involves three circuits: The first circuit involves the
  transcriptional activation of Clock-BMAL1 control proteins, Per1-3/Cry1-2, Rev-erbα/β,
  and DBP/NFIL-3. Cry and Per regulate Clock: BMAL1 expression by binding to the Clock
  subunit at the E-box enhancer elements and repressing Clock: BMAL1-mediated transcriptional
  activation of several Circadian controlled genes (CCGs), besides the three circadian
  loops. The second circuit of repression involves Rev-ERBα along with RORα (RAR-related
  orphan receptor alpha (RORα), repressing BMAL1 by the ROR/REV-ERB-response element
  (RORE)-dependent mechanism. The third circuit employs NFIL-3 and DBP-mediated repression
  of Per 1,2,3 along with several proinflammatory mediators'' expression, and CCGs,
  thereby controlling complement activation and exacerbated inflammation. Explanations
  of these pathways are detailed in the text.'
