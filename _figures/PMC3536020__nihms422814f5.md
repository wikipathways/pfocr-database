caption: The GSK-3 serine/threonine kinase promotes MLL-FP-mediated leukemogenesis
  by increasing the recruitment of HOXA9 and its cofactor MEIS1 to target genes. GSK3
  has a role in multiple cellular pathways, such as Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling is
  repressed by GSK-3, which induces β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation [,].
  Interestingly, independent of its role in Wnt signaling, GSK-3 has an opposing pro-oncogenic
  role in MLL-FP leukemia, as its inhibition leads to G1 arrest []. Further investigation
  into how the cell cycle is regulated by GSK-3 demonstrated its ability to directly
  phosphorylate CREB, leading to the formation of a complex including CREB, MEIS1,
  HOXA9, and CBP to activate HOX/MEIS1 downstream targets () []. These results identify
  GSK-3-mediated HOX protein recruitment as a critical pathway for MLL-FP-mediated
  leukemogenesis.
