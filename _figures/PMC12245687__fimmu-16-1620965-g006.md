caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of the Wnt signaling pathway. Upon activation
  of the Wnt signaling pathway, the multiprotein complex dissociates, allowing unubiquitized
  and degraded β-catenin to enter the nucleus, resulting in an increase in the expression
  of anti-inflammatory factors and mitigating the damage caused by inflammatory factors
  to the intestine; whereas, when it is not activated, the multiprotein complex ubiquitinates
  as well as degrades the β-catenin after it has been phosphorylated, and it fails
  to play its role as an anti-inflammatory agen. Created with BioRender.com
