caption: Ferroptosis is an oxidative, non-apoptotic form of cell death that can be
  triggered by deprivation of cystine. Cystine is imported into the cell where it
  is reduced to the amino acid cysteine. Cysteine is necessary for the synthesis of
  the tripeptide antioxidant, glutathione, which is used by the lipid hydroperoxidase
  GPX4 to suppress the accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS, red stars).
  Stabilization of p53 leads to increased expression of p21CIP1/WAF1 (p21). p21 promotes
  the conservation of glutathione during ferroptosis to suppress the formation of
  lipid ROS and prolong cell survival.
