caption: 'The activity change and interaction of key molecular targets downstream
  of oxidative stress induced by maternal diabetes. Maternal diabetes-induced oxidative
  stress activates ASK1 signaling pathway through dissociation with Trx and then phosphorylation.
  Activated ASK1 further activates JNK1/2 by phosphorylation, resulting in mitochondrial
  dysfunction and ER stress. Activated ASK1/JNK1/2 stimulates FoxO3a nucleus translocation
  and subsequent TRADD expression, caspase 8 activation, which induces apoptosis and
  diabetic embryopathy. AKT pathway may inactivate FoxO3a function by phosphorylation.
  Oxidative stress inhibits AKT activity by dephosphorylation, which will increase
  levels of dephosphorylated and activated FoxO3a to translocate to nucleus as transcription
  factor inducing TRADD over-expression. Thus, the transcription factor FoxO3a is
  key mechanism of diabetic embryopathy induced by oxidative stress. mitochondrial
