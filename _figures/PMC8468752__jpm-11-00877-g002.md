caption: 'A schematic representation of the pharmacokinetic modulator genes involved
  in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and clearance of lipid-lowering therapy
  (created with BioRender.com). Oral lipid-antagonists enter the circulatory system
  via the enteric SLC and ABC gene-transporters. While intravenous anti-lipids enter
  directly into the circulation and reach the liver, the agents administrated subcutaneously
  are slowly absorbed through the blood capillaries. The liver and kidneys are the
  major metabolic sites for lipid-lowering medicines. The main catalytic proteins
  involved in their metabolic pathway are CYP and UGT, which inactivate or activate
  drugs. Members of the ABC family then mediate their elimination through kidneys,
  biliary, or intestinal pathways. Some drugs accumulate for a long-time in the muscle
  or adipose tissue. Abbreviations: ABCG2/5/8, atp-binding cassette, subfamily g,
  member 2, 5, or 8; SLCO1B1, solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1; CYP3A4,
  Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, member 4; UGT2B7, uridine 5′-diphosphate
  (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7; UGT1A1/3, uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase
  1A1 or 3.'
