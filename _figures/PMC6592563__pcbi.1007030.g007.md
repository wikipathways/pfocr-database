caption: The elementary pathway between on, off, and primed is described by a Markov
  process with an exponential holding time with parameters Ri = 1/ti. The core of
  this model is the three cyclic gene states, on, off and primed. The pathways accompanied
  by R0, R1 and R2 represent the transitions from on to off, from off to primed, and
  from primed to on, respectively. Conditional on the state we assume that gene expression
  follows a Markov jump process with birth rates, βH for on and βL for off and primed
  states, and degradation rate μ for mRNA molecules (same for all three states). The
  values of the rate parameters are found in Materials and Methods. Spatial coupling
  is implemented by assuming that the rates R1 and R2 are a function of the number
  of on genes in the connected cells (see Eqs ( and ) in ).
