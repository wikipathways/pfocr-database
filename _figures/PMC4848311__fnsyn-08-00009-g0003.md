caption: Postsynaptic regulation of the SUMO pathway. The diffusion of Ubc9, the sole
  conjugating enzyme of the SUMO system is regulated by synaptic activity. Neuronal
  activation increases the residency time of the SUMO-conjugationg enzyme Ubc9 at
  the post-synapse. This synaptic regulation is independent of NMDAR activation but
  involves an mGlu5R-dependent signaling pathway that leads to PKC activation. The
  effect of this activity-dependent PKC phosphorylation is the increased anchoring
  of Ubc9 to synaptic phosphorylated protein substrates, which ultimately enhances
  sumoylation at synapses. Activation of mGlu5R therefore promotes a transient diffusional
  trapping of Ubc9 in activated spines via a PKC-dependent pathway, which in turn
  contributes in the regulation of neuronal excitability.
