caption: The angiotensin II signalling pathway can signal through G-protein dependent
  and G-protein independent pathways. The angiotensin receptor (AT1aR) is phosphorylated
  upon stimulation and G-proteins activated, which leads to an increase in IP3, intracellular
  calcium and diacyglycerol, which activates the signalling cascade involving several
  kinases e.g. PKC, MAPK and PKD. Phosphorylation of the receptor also leads to the
  recruitment of G-protein coupled receptor kinases and β-arrestin, and ultimately
  to internalisation of the receptor. Internalisation of the receptor yields the second
  wave of signalling, and has been associated with some of the positive effects of
  angiotensin II signalling in the cardiac setting.
