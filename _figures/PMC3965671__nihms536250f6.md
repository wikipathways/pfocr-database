caption: Mechanisms by which Th17 and Th22 pathways contribute to psoriasis and atopic
  dermatitis. Psoriasis (left panel) and atopic dermatitis (right panel) are chronic
  inflammatory diseases of skin with distinct immunopathogeneses. In psoriasis, hyperproliferation
  and impaired differentiation of keratinocytes in the epidermis is caused by an inflammatory
  cascade primarily mediated by the signaling of cytokines produced by cells of the
  Th17 pathway within the dermis. IL-17A signaling into keratinocytes, in synergy
  with IL-22 and TNFα and potentially IFNγ, induces the production of a variety of
  pro-inflammatory proteins (AMPS, chemokines and cytokines), which results in a heightened
  immune state and the further recruitment and activation of immune cells that maintain
  chronic inflammation. IL-17A and IL-22 also induce the production of IL-20 and IL-24
  by keratinocytes, which, with IL-22, induce keratinocyte hyperproliferation and
  hyperplasia, or acanthosis, that is a hallmark of the psoriatic pathology. Atopic
  dermatitis (AD) is distinguished by both defects in the terminal differentiation
  of the epidermis and the pattern of sustained inflammation (right panel). In AD,
  the barrier function of the cornified layer of the epidermis can be defective, resulting
  in increased sensitization to environmental antigens that primes a dysregulated
  Th2 response. Th2 cytokines promote the generation of antigen-specific IgE and the
  recruitment/expansion of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. Similar to, yet
  distinct from, psoriasis, a variety of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), cytokines
  and chemokines are up-regulated in AD, which contribute to maintenance of the underlying
  inflammation. It has been recently demonstrated that Th22 (and Tc22 cells; not shown)
  are prevalent in AD lesions, which contribute IL-22 that induces the epidermal hyperplasia
  that is characteristic of AD lesions. The relative contributions of Th2 and Th22
  cells to pathogenesis has yet to be well explored, and there might well be a spectrum
  of disease in individual patients.
