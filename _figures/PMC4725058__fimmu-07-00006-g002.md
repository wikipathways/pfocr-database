caption: Length of interaction alters the activation of specific transcription factors.
  (A) Schematic diagram denoting the major signaling molecules involved in the T cell
  activation process upon stimulation of the TCR by cognate pMHCII, leading to the
  differential activation of downstream transcription factors based on signal strength
  and interaction times. (B) Short-term interactions induce a subset of default pathway
  of fast-acting transcription factors, which preferentially activate Th2-associated
  genes. Interaction for a longer period of time induces both default pathway-associated
  transcription factors and additionally allows for the induction of Th1-specific
  transcription factor activation, which are able to override the default Th2-inducing
  signal and skew the response toward the differentiation of a Th1 subset.
