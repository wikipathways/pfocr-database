caption: Notch signaling pathway. (1) Notch receptor and ligand genes are transcribed
  and translated into protein. (2) During posttranslational processing in the Golgi,
  Notch receptors are cleaved by furin to create heterodimers; both ligands and receptors
  are glycosylated on their EGF-like repeats by Fringe family enzymes. (3) trans activation
  of Notch receptor by Notch ligand from a neighboring cell, triggering cleavage by
  ADAM10 at S2 and γ-secretase at S3, releasing the NICD. (4) cis inhibition of Notch
  receptor by Notch ligand on the same cell, preventing activation. (5) Endocytosis
  of Notch ligand with associated NECD can be degraded by the proteasome or recycled
  back to the cell surface. (6) NICD is shuttled to the nucleus where it binds to
  RBPJ, displacing HDACs and corepressors such as CIR and recruiting MAML to activate
  transcription of Notch target genes. (7) NICD can both directly interact with Ras
  and promote ERK phosphorylation, though the mechanism is not yet known. (8) NICD
  can bind to the Wnt signaling mediator β-catenin and target it for degradation in
  the lysosome. (9) Transcription of some genes, including smooth muscle contractile
  genes, is coregulated by NICD/RBPJ and the TGFβ transcription factor SMAD3. (10)
  Many signaling pathways can regulate expression of Notch components, including PDGFRβ
  signaling via the MAPK pathway.
