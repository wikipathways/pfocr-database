caption: 'Simplified schematic of NIGT1/HRS1/HHO TFs involved in multifunctional regulation
  in plants. (A) The black arrow: Nitrate transporter NRT can increase the content
  of nitrate and can enhance the expression of the nitrate response transcription
  factors and induce the expression of NIGT1/HRS1/HHO family genes to inhibit the
  N starvation response. The red arrow: NIGT1/HRS1/HHO TFs can inhibit the expression
  of SPX and can induce the expression of PHR1 to promote PSR. The blue arrow: Under
  Pi deficiency, PSR can promote the expression of NIGT1/HRS1/HHO TFs to inhibit nitrate
  absorption and primary root growth. (B–E) Functions of NIGT1/HRS1/HHO TFs in plant
  growth and development. (B) HRS1 can promote seed germination by inhibiting ABA
  signaling. (C) HHO2 can increase the expression of CuAOζ and promotes IBA to enhance
  lateral root growth. (D) NIGT1/HRS1/HHO TFs are involved in flowering by coordinating
  temperature and light. SVP can promote the expression of HHO4. HHO4 can interact
  with JMJ30. Protein complex of HHO4 and JMJ30 repress the expression of FT gene
  to inhibit flowering. (E) HHO5 can interact with ULT1 and can inhibit the expression
  of WUS to participate in the homeostasis of floral meristems and the growth and
  development of floral organs. (F,G) Functions of NIGT1/HRS1/HHO TFs in abiotic stress.
  (F) The expression of HRS1 and OsNIGT1 are repressed under salt stress. Mutants
  of HRS1 and OsNIGT1 can enhance tolerance to salt stress. (G) VaAQ can improve low
  temperature tolerance. VaAQ increased the synthesis of RFOs by increasing GoLS activity
  to improve low temperature tolerance. VaAQ also regulates the expression of the
  CBFs or DREBs and improves tolerance to low temperature stress through the ABA pathway.
  Promoting and repressive effects are indicated by → and ┤, respectively, and P deficiency
  is denoted by -P.'
