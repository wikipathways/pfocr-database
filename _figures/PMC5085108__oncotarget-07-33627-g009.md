caption: The figure shows the simplified CREB signalling pathway in neurons. Activated
  neuronal receptors (Growth factor-, Glutamate- and GPC receptors) intracellularly
  signal to kinase proteins (Ras/Raf, PKC, cAMK's) phosphorylating MAPK proteins.
  This leads to phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB shuttling to the
  nucleus and leads to transcription of genes that regulate synaptic plasticity. The
  signalling pathway can be regulated by miRNAs, Ppp's and inflammatory cytokines
  such as TNFα triggered by oxidative stress, Aβ plaques / NF tangles or neuroinflammation.
  Ppp's, protein phosphatases; GPC, G-protein coupled; NF, neurofilament.
