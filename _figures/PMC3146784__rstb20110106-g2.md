caption: 'TLR ligands and signalling. TLR receptors recognize different microbial
  components: the heterodimer of TLR4 and MD-2 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS);
  TLR2 recognizes triacyl and diacyl portions of lipoproteins together with TLR1 or
  TLR6, respectively; TLR5 recognizes flagellin, a major component of flagella; TLR3
  recognizes double-stranded RNA; TLR7 recognizes single-stranded RNA and TLR9 recognizes
  bacterial and viral DNA, the so-called CpG DNA. The signalling pathways of TLRs
  are mediated by selective usage of adaptor molecules, MyD88, TRIF, TIRAP and TRAM.
  MyD88 is involved in all TLR signalling except for TLR3. TRIF is involved in TLR3
  and TLR4 dependent activation of IRF3 via IKKi/TBK1, resulting in type 1 interferon
  production. TRAM is responsible for the TLR4-MyD88 dependent pathway involving recruitment
  of TRIF to the cytoplasmic portion of TLR4. TIRAP is involved in recruiting MyD88
  to the cytoplasmic portions of TLR2 and TLR4. TLR7 and TLR9-dependent production
  of type 1 interferon requires direct interaction of MyD88 and IRF7, which occurs
  only in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Nucleic acid-recognizing TLRs (TLR3, TLR7,
  TLR9) are present in the endosome.'
