caption: Epithelial cells form a layer that functions as a physical barrier facilitated
  by tight connections between each cell. A number of tight junction protein components
  seal the paracellular pathway and conduct gate and fence functions. The mucosal
  layer is a chemical barrier that is critical to limit the contact between the microbiome
  and epithelial cells. Immune cells are also a major participant in the immune response
  and the tolerance of the host against external substances. The graphical illustration
