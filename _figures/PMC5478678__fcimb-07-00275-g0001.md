caption: Hypothetical metabolic network of Francisella tularensis. The pathways are
  predicted on the basis of the genome sequences and earlier biochemical studies (Gyuranecz
  et al., ; Meibom and Charbit, ; Raghunathan et al., ; Barel et al., ). Potential
  carbon substrates are indicated by red boxes. Major metabolic products are indicated
  by yellow boxes. Reactions of the glycolytic pathway (EMP) and gluconeogensis (GN)
  are indicated by red arrows. Reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and
  the citrate cycle (TCA) are indicated by blue and green arrows, respectively. The
  interconnection between Gly and Ser includes the glycine cleavage system.
