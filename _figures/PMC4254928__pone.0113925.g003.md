caption: 'Binding of WNT4 to the receptor FZD8 and LRP6 leads to inhibition of beta-catenin
  degradation. Beta-catenin in turn interacts with members of the TCF/Lef-1 family
  of transcription factors to co-activate target gene transcription. WNT components
  whose mRNA was more abundant in clam released than in stripped oocytes are marked
  with a red star next to the gene symbol. LRP6: low density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 6; CK1: casein kinase 1; GSK3: glycogen synthase kinase 3; APC: adenomatous
  polyposis coli; TCF: transcription factor.'
