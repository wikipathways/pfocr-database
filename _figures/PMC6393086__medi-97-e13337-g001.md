caption: The pathway of estradiol metabolism in extrahepatic tissues such as those
  of the breast. Estradiol is metabolized into hydroxyl-estradiols, which are then
  oxidized to form quinones that react with DNA to form depurinating DNA adducts.
  Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), glutathione S-transferase 1 (GSTP1), and GSTM3
  detoxify hydroxyl-estradiols and quinones via conjugation reactions. Estrogen and
  other exogenous estrogens are metabolized via the same pathway as estradiol.
