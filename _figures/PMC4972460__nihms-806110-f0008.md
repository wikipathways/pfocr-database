caption: Bright light exposure causes retinal degeneration that is associated with
  perturbation of retinal transcriptome homeostasis manifested as dysregulation of
  multiple gene sets, including but not limited to down-regulation of the phototransduction
  pathway and up-regulation of the apoptosis pathway, p53 signaling, cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interactions, and chemokine signaling. Pretreatment with individual drugs
  that act as antagonists at Gs-coupled GPCRs, agonists at Gi-coupled GPCRs, or antagonists
  at Gq-coupled GPCRs results in retinal protection. We found that, when each drug
  is delivered at lower subeffective doses, combinations of these drugs acting synergistically
  upon different GPCRs protected retinas from bright light–induced degeneration. The
  retinal protection by different treatment modalities, namely, monotherapy at high
  doses or combined treatments consisting of subeffective doses of drugs, not only
  prevents light-induced changes in common gene sets but also affects gene sets specific
  to each treatment. Combined treatment results in improved preservation of the retinal
  transcriptome compared to that conferred by monotherapy and may also offer the benefit
  of reduced side effects because of lower doses required for effectiveness.
