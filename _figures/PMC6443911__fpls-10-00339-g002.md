caption: KEGG map of the Citrate Cycle (TCA cycle; map00020) pathway, rendered by
  Pathview (). Each box is divided in three sub-boxes and represents a specific enzymatic
  step with the relative expression of the corresponding genes in Flooded versus Control
  roots, calculated as log2-ratio at T1, T2, and T6 (from left to right).
