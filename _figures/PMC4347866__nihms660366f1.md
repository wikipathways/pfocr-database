caption: The composition of an advanced lesion of atherosclerosis is depicted in which
  features associated with a vulnerable plaque are shown (top). The arrow indicates
  a shoulder region particularly at risk for plaque rupture with a thin fibrous cap
  and underlying apoptotic macrophages and a lipid-rich core. The SMC (bottom right)
  shows the DNA damage response pathway that was enhanced by Gray et al though SMC
  over-expression of a wildtype form of an essential MRN protein NSB1. ATM is recruited
  to the MRN complex that senses double-strand DNA breaks and leads to enhanced signaling,
  and consequently to increased ATM auto-phosphorylation and ATM-dependent phosphorylation
  of numerous targets including the histone H2AX (γH2AX) and others which control
  cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair, such as p53. In turn, activation of ATM also
  modulates central mediators of the response, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase, JNK.
  Observed SMC effects in atherosclerotic plaques in vivo are summarized. Although
  there is much more limited information on modulation of the DNA damage response
  in macrophages (bottom, left), a summary of data from in vitro studies is shown
  (indicated by brackets on the figure). These include the observation of enhanced
  ATM activation following stimulation with either chloroquine or with deficiency
  of the ATM inhibitor WIP1. Increases (up arrow), decreases (down arrow), or no change
  (flat double-arrow) have been indicated below the cells.
