caption: Possible pathways leading to inhibition of extracellular signal regulated
  kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation by A2B adenosine receptors (A2BARs). Stimulation
  of adenylate cyclase (AC) via the Gspathway results in inhibition of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) activity. Forskolin mimics this inhibition, confirming a role
  of cAMP. Alternatively, Gq/11 may be activated by A2BAR stimulation, resulting in
  an increased activity of phospholipase C (PLC) and in intracellular Ca2+ signal.
  The PLC inhibitor U-73122 and the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (applied as the cell-penetrating
  ester BAPTA-AM) both abolish A2BAR-mediated inhibition of MAPK, providing evidence
  for a second pathway leading to the inhibition of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. Both
  the Gs- and the Gq/11-mediated signals are linked to MAPK inhibition via currently
  unknown pathways
