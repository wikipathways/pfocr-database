caption: The relationship between microbiota and immunosuppressive of GC. The interaction
  between TCR and peptide-MCHII on APC and a second costimulatory signal mediated
  by CD28 can activate T cells, while CTLA4 binds to B7-1 to inhibit the activation
  of T cells. Binding of PD-L1 on GC cells to PD-I on T cells can also inhibit T cell
  activation, so blocking the binding can activate T cells. Gastrointestinal bacteria
  were found to act synergistically. Butyric can induce CD8 + T cells to express ID2
  through IL-12 signal transduction, and directly enhance the anti-tumor cytotoxicity
  of CD8 + T cells. Inosine could enhance ICI efficacy by acting on A2AR on T lymphocytes.
  It stimulates the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB)
  through the inosine-A2AR-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, which can upregulate IL12Rβ2
  and IFNγ transcription and promote Th1-cell differentiation and accumulation in
  the TME. This fig was made by Figdraw. TCR, T cell receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; APC, antigen-presenting cells.
