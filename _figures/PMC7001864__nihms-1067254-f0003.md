caption: (A) Activation of WNT/β-catenin pathway in malignant cells inhibits secretion
  of C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) that is required for the recruitment of basic
  leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 3 (BATF3)-dependent dendritic cells
  (DCs) to the tumor microenvironment. This results in reduced levels of DC-derived
  C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and limited CD8+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL)
  infiltration and hence defective cross-priming. Inhibition of glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 (GSK3) in cancer cells promotes β-catenin activation and consequent stabilization
  of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) that drives CTL exhaustion upon interaction
  with PD-1. The secretion of dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1 (DKK1) by
  latent metastatic cells prevents natural killer (NK) cell-dependent cancer cell
  lysis by reducing the expression of NK cell activating ligands (NKALs) that engage
  NK cell activatory receptors (NKARs). (B) Canonical WNT/β-catenin in myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs) inhibits their accumulation and ability to infiltrate malignant
  lesions, resulting in increased recruitment of CTLs. GSK3 inhibition and β-catenin
  overexpression in NK cells result in the upregulation of transcription factors responsible
  for NK cell maturation, hence stimulating NK cell effector function. While enforced
  expression of β-catenin favors regulatory T (TREG) cell survival in vitro, activation
  of transcription factor 1 (TCF1, encoded by TCF7) downstream of canonical WNT signaling
  impairs the immunosuppressive activity of TREG cells by blocking forkhead box P3
  (FOXP3) transcriptional functions. (C) WNT ligands released by cancer cells can
  induce canonical WNT signaling in DCs, resulting in increased secretion of interleukin
  10 (IL-10), limited production of IL-12, and upregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
  1 (IDO1). This favors the generation of TREG cells and consequent inhibition of
  CTL activity.
