caption: 'Role of fibrotic factors in the development of DKD. The diagram depicts
  the involvement of renal fibrosis in the development of DKD. This fibrotic process
  encompasses various pathways, including TGF-β, MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT,
  and NOTCH signaling. Within the TGF-β signaling pathway, Smad 2/3 mediates the production
  of ECM. The MAPK pathway leads to an increase in signaling transduction mediated
  by P38MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK, resulting in elevated collagen IV levels. The Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway contributes to podocyte loss and mesangial cell apoptosis through the regulation
  of WT-1-associated genes and the cleavage of cas-3 and PARP, respectively. The collective
  action of the PI3K/AKT-JAK/STAT-NOTCH signaling pathways promotes PI3K/AKT, STAT1/3,
  and Snail signaling, leading to the induced expression of fibronectin/collagen IV,
  TGF-β1, VEGF, ACE, α-SMA, MMP2/9. Ultimately, these molecules drive the process
  of renal fibrosis in DKD. Abbreviations: DKD: diabetic kidney disease, WT-1: Wilms
  tumor-1, a master regulator of gene expression in podocytes, TGF-β: transforming
  growth factor-beta, MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK1/2: extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 1/2, JNK: c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, Cas-3: caspase-3,
  PARP: polyADP-ribose polymerase, PI3K/AKT: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Ak strain
  transforming, STAT1/3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/3, JAK/STAT:
  Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription, Smad 2/3: suppressor
  of mothers against decapentaplegic 2/3, ECM: extracellular matrix, VEGF: vascular
  endothelial growth factor, ACE: angiotensin-converting enzyme, a-SMA: alpha smooth
  muscle actin, MMP2/9: matrix metalloproteinase2/9'
