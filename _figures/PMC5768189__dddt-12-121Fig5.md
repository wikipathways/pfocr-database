caption: 'Regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis.Notes: In prolonged fasting, hepatic
  gluconeogenesis is initiated and catalyzed by a series of enzymes including PC,
  PEPCK, FBPase and G6Pase. With food intake, the hepatic glucose production pathways
  are inhibited by the activation of insulin-mediated PI3K/Akt pathway. CREB/TORC-2,
  HNFs, FoxO1 and a family of nuclear receptors are critical in the activation of
  hepatic glucose production. The solid black line represents for the pathway under
  fasting condition and the red dotted line for the feeding condition. See the main
  text for more specific regulatory pathways.Abbreviations: FBPase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase;
  FoxO1, forkhead box O1; G6Pase, glucose 6-phosphatase; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor;
  PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3-kinase;
  PKA, protein kinase A; TORC-2, CREB and its co-activator 2.'
