caption: (A) Switch-and-rheostat regulation in the GAL pathway is achieved through
  a hierarchical design. In response to glucose, the rheostat works through Mig1p
  transcriptional regulation of GAL4, where the activity of Gal4p is then regulated
  in response to the galactose:glucose ratio. (B) Molecular mechanism of the independent
  control of Gal4p abundance and activity. Internal galactose concentrations (which
  depend on the external ratio of glucose:galactose) controls the activity of Gal3p
  (x-axis). Gal80p sequesters Gal4p; active Gal3p sequesters Gal80p. Thus, when the
  active Gal3p concentration exceeds the total Gal80p concentration, Gal4p will convert
  sharply in the galactose:glucose ratio space from inactive (gray circles) to active
  (orange circles). However, the total amount of active Gal4p controls the amount
  of transcriptional output from the GAL1 promoter (green shading). Glucose controls
  Mig1p activity, thereby setting the total level of Gal4p (y-axis). Thus, glucose
  controls the level of Gal1p by controlling the total level of Gal4p and thereby
  the amount of active Gal4p.
