caption: The signaling pathway was elucidated in hepatocellular carcinoma cells after
  Sal B treatment. Sal B can specifically bind to mortalin, and increased the degradation
  of mortalin proteasomes through ubiquitination. The down-regulation of mortalin
  can lead to the up-regulation of RECK protein. Then its downstream p-STAT3 and Ac-STAT3
  were inhibited to enter the nucleus, resulting in a decrease of the invasive and
  migratory abilities of hepatocellular carcinoma cells
