caption: Disruption of metabolic pathways involved in fat pad mass trait in mouse
  models of the candidate genes. The nine mouse models are labeled as 1 to 9 in red.
  Each of the metabolic pathways previously identified to be different between fat
  and lean mouse is marked with the identifiers of the mouse models whose liver gene
  expression signatures are enriched for the specific pathway. The number of pathways
  that are over-represented in the liver gene expression signature of each mouse model
  is listed in parenthesis following the name of each mouse model.
