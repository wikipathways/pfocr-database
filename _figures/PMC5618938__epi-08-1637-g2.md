caption: '(A) A model of interaction of environmental factors with epigenetic modulators
  during aging. Environmental factors affect cell function through direct or indirect
  mechanisms by influencing many epigenetic modulators including chromatin writers
  (e.g., DNMTs, HMTs and HATs), chromatin eraser enzymes (e.g., TET, HDMTs and HDACs)
  and various transcriptional factors resulting in dynamic chromatin modifications,
  which in turn influence gene expression. Epigenetic-mediated phenotypic plasticity
  attenuation during aging is characterized by a loss of the normal balance between
  the regulatory epigenetic landmarks and plasticity of response to environmental
  signals. For example, in young cells, the chromatin (hypothetically) with increased
  active histone modifications (orange circle, methylated histone tail; green circle,
  acetylated histone tail) and hypomethylated DNA pattern (red diamond, methylated
  CpG island, left panel) leads to gene activation in response to balanced environmental
  stimuli. However, the gene is relatively refractory to environmentally induced activation
  due to age-dependent epigenetic changes in the gene regulatory region including
  altered epigenetic landmarks and malfunction of epigenetic modulators such as changes
  in gene expression, binding ability or enzymatic activity of chromatin writers,
  erasers and relevant transcriptional factors (represented as distorted shapes, right
  panel). This results in an altered chromatin structure (compacted chromatin) and
  regulatory machinery (repressor complex recruitment) in the loci leading to gene
  silencing (right panel). (B) Schematic representation of mechanistic pathway indicated
  in (A).DNMT: DNA methyltransferase; HAT: Histone acetylase; HDAC: Histone deacetylase;
  HDMT: Histone demethylase; HMT: Histone methyltransferase; TET: Ten-eleven translocation.'
