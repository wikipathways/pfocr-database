caption: Basal ganglia signaling pathways and associated receptor localization. (A)
  Signals from the cerebral cortex affect the output nuclei (GPi and SNpr) via direct
  or indirect pathways via the basal ganglia input nuclei (CPU), which in turn regulate
  thalamic motor function. In Parkinson’s disease (PD), the loss of dopaminergic neurons
  leads to enhanced activity in the indirect pathway and diminished activity in the
  direct pathway, with more output of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric
  acid (GABA) from the GPi and SNpr, which depresses the motor thalamus, leading to
  the development of PD. Some receptors present in the basal ganglia play an important
  role in the regulation of signaling. CB1 receptors are mainly found in GABAergic
  and glutamatergic neurons. GPR55 is present in the nuclei of GPe, CPU, STN, and
  SNpr. CB2 receptors and TRPV-1 are mainly present in dopaminergic neurons originating
  from the SNpc. (B) Three major pathways of basal ganglia signaling.
