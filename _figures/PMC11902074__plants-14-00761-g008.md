caption: A schematic representation of gene expression regulation during the induction
  of embryogenic callus from explants in the banana cultivar MJ. The depth of the
  orange color in the oval signifies the importance of the involved signaling pathways,
  with darker hues indicating a higher likelihood of involvement. Genes highlighted
  in gray denote the presence of both A and B alleles, while those in blue indicate
  alleles specific to A or B. The auxin signaling pathway genes are primarily responsible
  for the induction of embryonic callus in bananas, with significant contributions
  from the MAPK signaling pathway, as well as the ABA, Ethylene, and BR pathways.
  Importantly, transcription factors such as LBD, WIND, and CYCD3, previously identified
  as key players in callus induction, are also integral to the formation of embryogenic
  callus in bananas, establishing a comprehensive regulatory network. Furthermore,
  our findings indicate that the predominant cause of browning in banana embryogenic
  callus is the marked upregulation of genes involved in the phenylalanine and flavonoid
  biosynthesis pathways, resulting in the accumulation of these compounds and potentially
  leading to browning
