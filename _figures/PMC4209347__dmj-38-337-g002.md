caption: Schematic presentation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant response
  element (ARE) pathway activation by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the cytoplasm,
  under normal conditions, Nrf2 is constitutively bound to Keap1 protein. Keap1 inhibits
  Nrf2 signaling pathway by promoting Nrf2 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation
  through proteasomal pathway. Mild oxidative stress and Nrf2 activators cause dissociation
  of Nrf2-Keap1 complex, phosphorylation of Nrf2, and the nuclear translocation. In
  the nucleus, Nrf2 promotes transcriptional activation of antioxidants (heme oxygenase-1
  [HO-1], NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 [NQO1], catalase, and superoxide dismutase
  [SOD]) and detoxifying enzymes by binding to the ARE in the promoter regions of
  the target genes.
