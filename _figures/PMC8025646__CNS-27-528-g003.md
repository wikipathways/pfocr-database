caption: 'Signals and molecules of pathological phagocytosis between microglia and
  target cell. Left panel: (A) Pathological microglial phagocytosis of synapse. (B)
  Pathological microglial phagocytosis of myelin sheath. (C) Pathological microglial
  phagocytosis of neuronal cell body. (D) Pathological microglial phagocytosis of
  myelin debris. The abnormal activation of "eat‐me" and "don''t eat‐me" signaling
  pathways exists in many CNS diseases. For example, Aβ causes C1q''s activation and
  induces excessive microglial phagocytosis of synapses (pink a). In chronic cerebral
  ischemia, excessive microglial phagocytosis of myelin sheaths via C3/C3aR pathway
  (green b). Right panel: In CNS disease, microglia recognize the "eat‐me" and "don''t
  eat‐me" signals exposed on the surface of target cells. "Eat‐me" signals can be
  divided into two categories: membrane anchoring signals (eg, TIM, PtdSer) and soluble
  bridging molecules (eg, CR3, C1q). "Don''t eat‐me" signal mediates the inhibition
  of microglial phagocytosis, which is mainly composed of CD47‐SIRPα'
