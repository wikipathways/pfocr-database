caption: ErbB4 signal pathway. WW-domain binding motifs in the C-tail of ERBB4 play
  an important role in the downregulation of ERBB4 receptor signaling, enabling the
  interaction of intact ERBB4, ERBB4 m80 and ERBB4 s80 with NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin
  ligases WWP1 and ITCH. The interaction of WWP1 and ITCH with intact ERBB4 is independent
  of receptor activation and autophosphorylation. Binding of WWP1 and ITCH ubiquitin
  ligases leads to ubiquitination of ERBB4 and its cleavage products, and subsequent
  degradation through both proteasomal and lysosomal routes [,]. In addition, the
  s80 cleavage product of ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 isoform is the target of NEDD4 ubiquitin
  ligase. NEDD4 binds ERBB4 JM-A CYT-1 s80 (ERBB4jmAcyt1s80) through its PIK3R1 interaction
  site and mediates ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 ubiquitination, thereby decreasing the amount
  of ERBB4jmAcyt1s80 that reaches the nucleus [].
