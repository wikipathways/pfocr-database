caption: During polyamine biosynthesis the methyl and sulfur of methionine are incorporated
  into 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA). The methionine salvage pathway converts MTA to
  α-keto-γ-methiolbutyrate. In mammals, the pathway is completed by transamination
  with glutamine (cycle 1). The product of glutamine transamination (i.e. αKGM, α-ketoglutaramate)
  is hydrolyzed to α-ketoglutarate plus ammonium ion by ω-amidase/Nit2. The α-ketoglutarate
  is converted to glutamate by transamination and/or reductive amination, which in
  turn is converted to glutamine via glutamine synthetase, thus closing cycle 2. Ado
  Met, S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Note that αKGM reversibly cyclizes to a lactam (2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline)
  in which the concentration of lactam is greatly favored over the open-chain form.
