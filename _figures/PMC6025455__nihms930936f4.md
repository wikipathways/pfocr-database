caption: Endothelial targeting to boost endogenous antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory
  pathways. The endothelial protein C (PC) pathway, which centers on the membrane
  glycoproteins, thrombomodulin (TM) and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), is
  a critical regulator of inflammation, thrombosis, and vascular permeability. Infusion
  of soluble biotherapeutics, like soluble human TM (shTM) and recombinant human APC
  (rhAPC), suffers from poor PK and lack of interaction with key components of the
  endogenous system. Anchoring recombinant TM and/or EPCR to endothelial cell adhesion
  molecules, like PECAM-1 and ICAM-1, localizes therapeutic action to the surface
  membrane and may exert superior effects through restoration of natural anticoagulant
  effects and signaling through protease-activated receptors (PARs). For these purposes,
  scFv fusion protein biotherapeutics may be preferable to large monoclonal antibody
  (mAb)-protein complexes, which can crosslink CAMs and induce endosomal uptake and
  endothelial disruption.
