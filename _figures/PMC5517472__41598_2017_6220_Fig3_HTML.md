caption: Overview of the metabolism of hepatic methylamine. (1) Choline oxidation
  pathway, the up regulation of gene expression and/or enzyme activity involved in
  this pathway. (2) Osmotic stress pathway by which curcuminoids might downregulate
  the BHMT enzyme activity in liver leading to high level of betaine. Choline transporter
  (A); choline dehydrogenase (CHDH); betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH); betaine
  homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT); cystathionine β-synthase (CBS); choline kinase
  (CK); 1,2 diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase (DGCPT); dimethylglycine (DMG);
  ethanolamine kinase (EK); methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT); methionine synthase
  (MS); phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (PCT); phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase
  (PEMT); S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH); tetrahydrofolate (THF).
