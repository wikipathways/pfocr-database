caption: 'SREBP pathway under conditions of (a) cholesterol deficiency and (b) cholesterol
  excess. (a) When mammalian cells are deprived of cholesterol, Scap escorts SREBPs
  in COPII vesicles from the ER to the Golgi. Two Golgi proteases (S1P and S2P) then
  sequentially cleave SREBPs, releasing their active NH2-terminal bHLH transcription
  factor domains, which travel to the nucleus and activate genes involved in cholesterol
  synthesis and uptake. (b) When cholesterol levels rise, the sterol binds to Scap
  and triggers Scap’s binding to Insigs, which retain Scap in the ER. Transport of
  SREBPs to the Golgi and subsequent transcriptional activation of lipogenic genes
  are halted. Abbreviations: bHLH, basic-helix-loop-helix zipper; COPII, coat protein
  II; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; S1P, site-1 protease; S2P, site-2 protease; SRE,
  sterol regulatory element; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein.'
