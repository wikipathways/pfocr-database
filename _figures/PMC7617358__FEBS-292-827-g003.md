caption: The anaerobic cobalamin biosynthesis pathway. (A) The schematic shows the
  abbreviations and EC numbers of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of adenosylcobalamin
  as found in the KEGG database, starting with the conversion of uroporphyrinogen
  III to precorrin‐2 and the early insertion of cobalt. Lower ligand synthesis is
  shown in Fig. S1. (B) In previously published literature, other abbreviations like
  UroM [97] or SuMT [98] have been used to refer to uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase
  (SirA). Abbreviations and full names of enzymes found in this article are displayed
  in the schematic. A short description of the steps and citations for the individual
  reactions is given in the Suppporting Information
