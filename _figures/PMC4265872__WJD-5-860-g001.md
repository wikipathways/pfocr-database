caption: 'Rap1a in advanced glycation end product/the receptor for advanced glycation
  end product signaling. A potential role for Rap1a as a molecular switch mediating
  the AGE/RAGE signaling pathway in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Increased Rap1a activity
  may stimulate PKC-ζ to further promote matrix accumulation, RAGE expression and
  fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblasts. AGE: Advanced glycation end product;
  RAGE: The receptor for AGE; ECM: Extracellular matrix; cAMP: Cyclic AMP; GAP: GTPase-activating
  protein; PKC-ζ: The ζ isotype of protein kinase C; MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase.'
