caption: (A) The six agonists used in this study (ADP, convulxin, U46619, thrombin,
  iloprost, GSNO) and their respective platelet signaling pathways, all of which converge
  upon intracellular calcium mobilization. (B) A two-layer, 12-node neural network
  architecture was employed. Agonist concentrations at a given time point were fed
  into the processing layers; the layers then integrated the input signal with feedback
  at t = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 seconds to calculate [Ca2+]i at the next time
  point. The pairwise synergy score (Sij) was also defined as the difference in integrated
  calcium response to two agonists used together and integrated response to agonists
  used individually, normalized by the maximum synergy score in the experiment.
