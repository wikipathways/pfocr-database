caption: Pyroptosis contributes to interstitial fibrosis. Pyroptosis owing to chronic
  exposure to diabetic substrates results in cell death, renal inflammation and renal
  injury. The pathogenic cycle, consisting of the canonical pyroptosis pathway and
  the TGF-β/Smad signalling pathway, has been proved to stimulate the progress of
  renal fibrosis. Meanwhile, NLRP3 inflammasome mediates activation of the p38MAPK
  signalling pathway, regulating the accumulation of fibronectin. Eventually, the
  crosslink between these pathways increases the production α-SMA, collagen, fibronectin
  and vimentin, and the accumulation of the ECM, playing a pro-fibrogenic role. Pro-inflammatory
  cytokines IL-18 from pyroptosis pathway also shows the pro-fibrogenic effect in
  DKD. Smad, drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; DKD, diabetic kidney disease; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin.
