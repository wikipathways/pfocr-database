caption: 'The relevant part of a specific KEGG pathway is shown with genes displayed
  as rectangles and metabolites displayed as circles. KEGG compound name for each
  metabolite is labeled beside the circle. Standard gene names are labeled inside
  the rectangle. For enzyme complexes, the gene name for the major component is shown
  followed with an ellipsis. The directions of irreversible enzymatic reactions are
  shown by the arrows. Reversible reactions are connected by straight lines. s-DEGs
  and s-SPMs are highlighted in blue (gpa2) and red (asc1). Shared s-DEGs and s-SPMs
  are colored half blue and half red. A) as compared with asc1, gpa2 affected more
  components in steroid biosynthesis (functional category: lipid); B) as compared
  with gpa2, asc1 affected more components in ribosome biogenesis (showing 90S pre-ribosome
  components, functional category: genetic information processing).'
