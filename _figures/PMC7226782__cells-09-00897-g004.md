caption: GSK-3/β-catenin in sensing of cytosolic DNA by the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase
  (cGAS)/STING pathway. Upon infection by DNA viruses, several DNA sensors molecules
  show overlapping abilities in their capacity to induce a type I IFN antiviral response,
  but cGAS is the most characterized. Upon binding with DNA molecules, it rapidly
  produces a second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) that activates the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER)–resident adaptor protein STING. In a complex with cGAMP, STING translocates
  from the ER to the ERGIC/Golgi to activate TBK1-IRF3 and NF-κB, resulting in robust
  type I IFN induction and inflammatory cytokine production. Limited information is
  available on the cross talk between the GSK-3/β-catenin and cGas/STING pathways.
  It may happen through either the recruitment of GSK-3 to TBK1 or through the binding
  of p-β-catenin Ser552 with the IRF3 promoter in association with TCF4 for the induction
  of type I IFN. The model was created using Servier Medical Art templates (www.servier.com)
