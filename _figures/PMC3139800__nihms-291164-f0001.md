caption: (A) A bulky DNA lesion is recognized by XPC-RAD23B, which binds to the undamaged
  strand of DNA, allowing for the recruitment of TFIIH (B). The lesion is verified
  by XPD resulting in the recruitment of XPA, RPA, and XPG leading to formation of
  the preincision complex (C). ERCC1-XPF is recruited to the preincision complex through
  interaction with XPA leading to DNA incision 5′ to the damage (D), which produces
  a free 3′-OH group available for inititation of repair synthesis by the replication
  machinery, and in turn triggers 3′ incision by XPG (E). Repair synthesis is completed
  and DNA ligase IIIα or ligase I seals the nick to complete the process (F).
