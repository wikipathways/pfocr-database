caption: In the setting of cerebral ischemia, excess intracellular calcium (Cai2+)
  activates various lipases, including phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and phospholipase C
  (PLC) which breakdown both intracellular and membrane phospholipids and release
  arachidonic acid (AA). Both the cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)
  pathways are activated. The COX pathway converts AA to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2),
  a precursor prostaglandin. PGH2 is then metabolized to various eicosanoids, including
  prostacyclin (PGI2), thromboxane A2 (TXA2), prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin D2.
  Eicosanoid family members have been shown to exert potent effect on brain vasomotor
  regulation and increase microvascular and BBB permeability. In the brain, they can
  act as neutrophil chemoattractants. AA can be also converted to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid (5-HPETE) by LOX-5. 5-HPETE is then metabolized to leukotriene A4 (LTA4) and
  B4 (LTB4). LTA4 is a precursor of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs). cysLTs are converted
  sequentially to leukotriene C4 (LTC4), leukotriene D4 (LTD4), leukotriene E4 (LTE4).
  Leukotrienes play multiple roles to mediate events such as chemoattraction, brain
  edema and BBB permeability.
