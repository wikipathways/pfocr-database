caption: 'The NRF2/KEAP1 signaling pathway adapted from [17]. (A) Under basal conditions,
  Nrf2 remains inactive in the cytoplasm bound to its regulatory protein Keap1. This
  protein is associated with the CUL3-RBX1 complex, allowing the transfer of ubiquitin
  (Ub) to the Lys residues located between the DLG and ETGE motifs of the Nrf2 Neh2
  domain. Then, degradation of Nrf2 occurs by ubiquitination and recognition by the
  proteasome 26S. (B) During oxidative stress, Cys residues at KEAP1 are oxidized
  at their BTB and/or IVR domains, inducing dissociation between Nrf2 and Keap1. Nrf2
  is released to the cytoplasm and, after accumulation, it is translocated to the
  nucleus where it binds to the small aponeurotic muscle fibrosarcoma (sMaf) proteins
  and induces the expression of antioxidant and detoxifying genes coding for enzymes
  that neutralize ROS and restore redox balance. (C) To restore redox balance, Keap1
  is translocated to the nucleus and translocates Nrf2 back to the cytoplasm. This
  controls the time of the antioxidant and detoxifying response. ARE, antioxidant
