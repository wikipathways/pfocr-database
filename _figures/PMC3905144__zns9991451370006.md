caption: Three retinal pathways for blue-green color vision. In the rabbit retina,
  S-cone bipolar cells exclusively contact S-cones, whereas the remaining cone bipolar
  cells are thought to contact both S-cones and M-cones nonselectively (). Although
  cones hyperpolarize in response to light stimulation, horizontal cells, which nonselectively
  contact S-cones (∼10% of total cones) and M-cones (∼90%), feed back onto cones and
  thereby confer a strong S−/M+ antagonistic response onto S-cone pedicles. Light
  hyperpolarizes S-cones, whereas horizontal cells create an antagonistic surround
  by feedback onto the cones. The first pathway, S-ON (1) is formed by the transfer
  of this response through a sign-inverting synapse onto S-ON cone bipolar cells.
  The antagonistic M-OFF signal is formed by horizontal cell feedback onto the S-cone
  pedicles. This S-ON/M-OFF signal is transferred from the bipolar cell directly onto
  the dendrites of the S-ON ganglion cell. The second pathway, the inverted S-OFF
  (2) diverges from pathway 1 when a glycinergic amacrine cell, which also receives
  synaptic input from the S-ON bipolar cell, then inhibits the inverted S-OFF ganglion
  cell. Additional chromatic antagonism is provided by direct excitatory input from
  M-ON bipolar cells (which may also contact ∼10% S-cones in rabbit). The third pathway
  (3) is the OFF counterpart of pathway 1. S-OFF bipolar cells inherit the horizontal
  cell-produced S-OFF/M-ON receptive field from S-cone pedicles through a sign-conserving
  synapse and relay this signal to the bistratified S-OFF ganglion cell. AC, amacrine
  cell; BC, bipolar cell; GC, ganglion cell; GCL, ganglion cell layer; IPL, inner
  plexiform layer; OPL, outer plexiform layer; a, sublamina a; b, sublamina b.
