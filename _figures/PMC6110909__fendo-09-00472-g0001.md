caption: Direct and indirect mechanisms of action of metformin in cancer cells. Metformin
  induces antitumorigenic effects by both indirect and direct mechanisms. In the blood
  circulation, metformin decreases glucose levels and therefore insulin levels; insulin
  can act as a growth factor in tumor cells. For direct effects, metformin acts by
  AMPK-dependent and independent effects. Generally, metformin induces inhibition
  of the mTORC1 pathway, which involves an essential protein complex in cellular processes,
  including protein synthesis and cell proliferation; this complex also promotes tumor
  cell resistance to therapies. Furthermore, metformin induces cell cycle arrest by
  p53 activation.

  description: Direct and indirect mechanisms of action of metformin in cancer cells.
    Metformin induces antitumorigenic effects by both indirect and direct mechanisms.
    In the blood circulation, metformin decreases glucose levels and therefore insulin
    levels; insulin can act as a growth factor in tumor cells. For direct effects,
    metformin acts by AMPK-dependent and independent effects. Generally, metformin
    induces inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway, which involves an essential protein
    complex in cellular processes, including protein synthesis and cell proliferation;
    this complex also promotes tumor cell resistance to therapies. Furthermore, metformin
    induces cell cycle arrest by p53 activation.
