caption: The cytoprotective APC pathway. This figure provides an overview of the direct
  cytoprotective effects for anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activity on leukocytes
  and endothelial cells. The anti-inflammatory effects of APC on endothelial cells
  include the inhibition of NF-κB activation with decreased expression of endothelial
  adhesion molecules and the reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. APC
  also inhibits the NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors on leukocytes and reduces
  their production of pro-inflammatory mediators. The end result of these effects
  is a reduction in leukocyte chemotaxis and infiltration. APC exerts anti-apoptotic
  effects on both leukocytes and endothelial cells by reducing several pro-apoptotic
  signals. The direct protective effects of APC on endothelial cells are mediated
  in the presence of EPCR and PAR-1. The effects of APC on leukocytes are mediated
  by EPCR alone or in the presence of PAR-1. APC increases endothelial production
  of PGI2 and MCP-1. The role of sEPCR, which is up-regulated in different inflammatory
  diseases, and PR3 on activated neutrophils are still not completely understood.
  PR3 binds both sEPCR and membrane-bound EPCR and may play a role in binding APC
  to neutrophils and/or inactivating the protein C pathway. The exact mechanism of
  APC signalling through PAR-1 is still not clear, and different models have been
  described in literature. AP-1, activator protein-1; APC, activated protein C; EPCR,
  endothelial protein C receptor; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; IL, interleukin;
  MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; PAR-1,
  protease-activated receptor-1; PGI2, prostaglandin I2; PR3, proteinase-3; sEPCR,
  soluble EPCR; TNF-α, tumour necrosis factor alpha; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion
  molecule-1.
