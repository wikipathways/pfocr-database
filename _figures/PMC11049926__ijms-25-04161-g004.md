caption: General model of neuroinflammation in epilepsy. Activation of microglia and
  astrocytes by hyperactive neurons leads to the release of proinflammatory mediators
  (TNF, IL-6, IL-1b), and the activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway. In addition,
  astrocytes release chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2, CCL5) that make their way to the blood.
  There, they attract different peripheral immune cells (neutrophils, monocytes, and
  T-lymphocytes) which infiltrate into the brain parenchyma. There, they express different
  proinflammatory mediators that, on the one hand, enhance the proinflammatory properties
  of astrocytes and microglia; on the other hand, they worsen the proinflammatory
  landscape. Eventually, neurons die and release DAMPs, which start the cycle again.
  Ne—neurons; A—astrocytes; M—microglia; N—neutrophils; Mn—monocytes; T—T-lymphocytes.
  A simplified seizure–spikes diagram is shown
