caption: 'The Notch pathway, showing therapeutic points for targeting Notch3. (1)
  HDAC inhibitors can enhance Notch3 gene transcription. (2) Notch3 mRNA translation
  can be inhibited by miRNA. (3) Furin‐like convertase inhibitors can inhibit Notch3
  protein folding in the Golgi apparatus. (4) Blocking antibodies can be used to block
  Notch3 extracellular domain and prevent its interaction with the ligand. (5) ADAM
  and gamma‐secretase inhibitors can be used to prevent Notch3 protein cleavage and
  release of Notch3 intracellular domain. (6) Notch3 is translocated to the nucleus,
  it binds to transcription factors and modifies target gene transcription.Abbreviations:
  ADAM, disintegrin and metalloprotease; CSL, CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag‐1; HDACi,
  histone deacetylase inhibitor; MAML, mastermind‐like protein 1; miRNA, microRNA;
