caption: Schematic diagram showing HbF regulation in response to HU, an HbF-inducing
  drug. BCL11A is a master repressor of gamma genes. The erythroid transcription factor
  KLF1 activates the transcription of BCL11A by binding to its promoter region. The
  expression of KLF1 is possibly regulated by MYB. The HBS1L-MYB intergenic region
  contains several trait-associated common genetic variations and a distal enhancer
  of MYB, promoting long-range transcription regulation by chromatin looping. SAR1A
  encodes a GTP-binding protein which has been reported to be associated with γ-globin
  expression. Variations in the candidate genes ARG1 and ARG2 are associated with
  HbF changes. Pharmacokinetic genes can affect absorption, distribution, and metabolism
  of HU.
