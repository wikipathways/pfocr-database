caption: Model for gonadotropin-mediated steroidogenesis in Leydig cells.  Gonadotropin
  (LH or hCG) activates the LH receptor, leading to a rapid and  prolonged increase
  in cAMP levels and subsequent PKA activity. Early increases  in PKA signaling trans-activate
  the EGFR independent of ligand (left  side of figure), leading to activation of
  the MAPK signaling pathway. By  mechanisms that are still not known, MAPK activation
  leads to phosphorylation  and translocation of small levels of existing StAR to
  the mitochondria,  resulting in increased steroidogenesis. Prolonged PKA signaling
  leads to  increased transcription of StAR mRNA, followed by increased StAR protein  expression
  (middle of figure). By 2 h, significant MAPK signaling is  no longer occurring nor
  is it required for StAR phosphorylation and  translocation to the mitochondria.
  Note that LH receptor activation also  triggers trans-activation of the EGFR via
  MMP activation (right side  of figure); however, this process is not necessary for
  steroid production and  any time point.
