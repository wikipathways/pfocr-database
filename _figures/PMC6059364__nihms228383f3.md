caption: a | The oncogenic function of Notch signalling in T cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukeamia (T-ALL) is connected with the downmodulation of p53 through increased
  MDM2 activity. As discussed in the main text, a proposed mechanism, based on experimental
  and clinical studies–, involves activation of the Pi3K–Akt pathway through Hes family-mediated
  down-modulation of PTeN expression. b | A positive feedback loop between p53 and
  NOTcH1 can counteract cervical carcinogenesis. Advanced stages of cervical carcinogenesis
  are linked to a concomitant upregulation of the human papillomavirus (HPv) e6 oncoprotein
  and downmodulation of NOTCH1. p53 protein levels and activity are increased by NOTcH1
  activation in cervical carcinoma cells through the suppression of activator protein
  1 (AP1)-dependent transcription of HPv e6. in turn, NOTCH1 is a direct positive
  target and is induced by increased p53. c | in ewing’s sarcoma, the EWSR1–friend
  leukaemia virus integration 1 (FLI1) translocation product (eWs–FLi1) is a negative
  regulator of Jagged1 (JAG1) expression, with consequent suppression of Notch activity.
  The Notch pathway in this system positively regulates p53 activity through a mechanism
  involving transcriptional repression of MDM2 by Hes and Herp family transcriptional
  repressors.
