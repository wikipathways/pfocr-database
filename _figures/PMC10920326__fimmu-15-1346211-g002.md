caption: Differential cellular components within the bone marrow microenvironment
  involved in immune evasion of MM. Dendritic cells (DCs), myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are crucial cellular components
  within the bone marrow microenvironment involved in the immune evasion of multiple
  myeloma, which plays pivotal roles in the progression of multiple myeloma. Briefly,
  the reduction in normal DC numbers is accompanied by a decline in antigen presentation
  ability; however, the accumulation of precursor DC cells drives the progression
  of multiple myeloma. MDSCs exert immunosuppressive effects and promote tumor growth
  through both direct and indirect pathways. TAMs exhibit diminished immune cytotoxicity
  and antigen presentation ability while promoting tumor survival and expansion through
  cytokine release such as IL-6 and IL-10. Moreover, they can induce vascular mimicry
  formation and release VEGF, thereby facilitating tumor angiogenesis. This figure
