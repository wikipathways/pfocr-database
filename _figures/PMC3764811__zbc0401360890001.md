caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for green leaf volatiles and their counterparts.
  Complex membrane lipids are hydrolyzed by lipases to form free fatty acids (18:3
  and 16:3). Then the free fatty acid is oxygenated by lipoxygenase, and resulting
  hydroperoxides are cleaved to form (Z)-3-hexenal and free traumatin or dinortraumatin
  derivatives. In disrupted leaves of Arabidopsis and some other plant species, galactolipids
  are directly oxygenated by lipoxygenase to form galactolipid-hydroperoxides which
  are subsequently cleaved by hydroperoxide lyase to form (Z)-3-hexenal and traumatin-
  and dinortraumatin-containing galactolipids.
