caption: Cell cycle (A) and DNA replication (B) pathways, Hedgehog (C) and Wnt (D)
  signaling pathways all have higher representation in larvae than in PLs, while in
  the insect hormone synthesis pathway (E), the expression pattern is more ambiguous.
  KO terms present in KEGG pathways but absent in the M. rosenbergii developmental
  transcriptome are highlighted in purple. KO terms with ≥2-fold over-expression in
  larvae are in green, and in pale green when the ratio falls between 1.5 and 2. Yellow
  denotes KO terms found in our transcriptome showing no differential representation
  between larvae and PLs. Red denotes KO terms with ≥2-fold over-expression in PLs,
  changing to pink when the ratio falls between 1.5 and 2. Blue denotes ambiguous
  expression between larvae and PLs. Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways include Patched
  receptor (Ptc), Wnt5 and Frizzled, whose encoding transcripts were validated using
  real-time RT-PCR (C and D).
