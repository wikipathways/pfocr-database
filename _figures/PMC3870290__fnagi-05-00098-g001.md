caption: 'Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch.
  APP processing: in the amyloidogenic processing pathway, APP is cleaved by the β-secretase
  BACE1 generating C99 which is further cleaved to the Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). The
  non-amyloidogenic processing pathway is initiated by α-secretase cleavage of APP
  within the Aβ domain, thus precluding the generation of Aβ. α- and β-secretase cleavage
  releases the soluble forms of APP, sAPPα, and sAPPβ, respectively, into the extracellular
  space. The remaining membrane-bound C-terminal fragments C83 and C99 are further
  processed by the γ-secretase complex leading to the generation of the non-toxic
  p3 from C83 or of the amyloidogenic Aβ peptide from C99. Aβ is rapidly degraded
  by several enzymes, for example neprilysin (NEP), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE),
  endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). In
  both processing pathways the APP intracellular domain (AICD) is released into the
  cytosol. Notch processing: after maturation S1 cleavage of the Notch receptor precursor
  by a furin-like convertase, Notch is processed similarly to APP. Ligand binding
  triggers the S2 cleavage by the α-secretase TACE/ADAM17 leading to the release of
  the Notch extracellular domain into the extracellular space. The remaining membrane-bound
  fragment Notch extracellular truncation (NEXT) is further processed by the γ-secretase
  complex resulting in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the
  membrane.'
