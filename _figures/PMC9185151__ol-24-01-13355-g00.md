caption: Canonical IFN-α signaling pathway. IFN-α binds to IFNAR1/IFNAR2 and subsequently
  activates JAK-1 and TYK2, which are two members of the JAK family. This subsequently
  leads to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. The pSTAT1/pSTAT2 heterodimeric
  complex combines with IRF9 to form an ISGF3 complex. ISGF3 binds to the homologous
  DNA sequence of ISRE to directly activate the transcription of ISGs. IFN-α, interferon-α;
  IFNAR, IFN-α/β receptor subunit; JAK, Janus kinase; TYK2, tyrosine kinase 2; p,
  phosphorylated; IRF9, IFN regulatory factor 9; ISG, IFN-stimulated gene; ISGF3,
  ISG factor 3; ISRE, IFN-sensitive response element.
