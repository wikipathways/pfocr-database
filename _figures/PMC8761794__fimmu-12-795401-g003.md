caption: Tumor-promoting mechanism of cGAS-STING pathway. DNA damage induces chronic
  inflammatory signaling through sustained activation of NF-κB downstream of the cGAS-STING
  signaling pathway, facilitating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and leading
  to increased migration and invasion of cancer cells. Expression of STING in tumors
  promotes immunosuppressive cells such as Treg and MDSC to infiltrate into tumor
  sites, and upregulation of IDO expression promotes immune escape of tumors in the
  body, creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In addition, the second
  messenger, cGAMP can be transferred through the cancer-astrocyte gap junction to
  activate STING protein in astrocytes, thus triggering TBK1 and IRF3 activation as
  well as IFNα and TNFα production to promote tumor brain metastasis. Created with
