caption: Proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients
  with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Far left part demonstrates the viral entry
  to host cells via binding of its spike protein with ACE2 receptor in the presence
  of TMPRSS2. Viral invasion and ensuing direct viral cytotoxicity result in malabsorption,
  stimulation of both intestinal secretion and enteric nervous system. The middle
  part depicts consequences of accumulation of Ang II and the decrease of Ang 1–7
  due to dysregulation of RAAS system. Ang II promotes proinflammatory cytokine release
  and tissue inflammation by binding to ATIR. The rightmost part shows the blockage
  of tryptophan uptake and inhibition of B0AT1/ACE2 transport pathway that is mediated
  by attaching of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor. This blockage affects the activation
  of mTOR to mitigate the antimicrobial peptide synthesis. Disturbance in antimicrobial
  peptide expression leads to gut microbiota dysbiosis, and the changed intestinal
  flora promotes the polarization of Th17 cells. The bottom part schematizes the recruitment
  of CCR9 + CD4 + T cells into the small intestine that is promoted by CCL25. SARS-CoV-2,
  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme;
  TMPRSS2, transmembrane protease serine protease 2; Ang II, angiotensin II; Ang 1–7,
  angiotensin 1–7; AT1R, angiotensin type 1 receptor; AT2R, angiotensin type 2 receptor;
  RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  CCL25, chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 25
