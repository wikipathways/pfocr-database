caption: a. The lncRNA-ROR promotes tumor chemoresistance by repressing P53 expression.
  b. The lncRNA PTCSC2 inhibits tumor cell cycle progression. c. The lncRNA LOC401317
  inhibits tumor cell cycle progression by inducing P21 expression and repressing
  cyclin D1 and E1 expression, and promotes apoptosis by inducing PARP and caspase
  3 expression; lncRNA LOC401317 expression is induced by p53 activity. d. The lncRNA
  NAMA represses tumor growth, and its expression is induced by cell cycle arrest
  and apoptosis. e. The lncRNA PTCSC2 inhibits tumor cell cycle progression and promotes
  apoptosis; f. The lncRNA NEAT1 promotes cell cycle progression by inhibiting the
  miR-107/ CDK6 pathway. g. The lncRNA PVT1 promotes tumor cell cycle progression
  by inducing cyclin D1 expression and promotes cell proliferation by inducing TSHR
  expression and recruiting EZH2 to repress the expression of tumor-suppressor genes.
  h. lncRNA-LET inhibits tumor cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis. LET is inhibited
  by EZH2-mediated H3K27 methylation. i. The lncRNA HOTAIR promotes cell proliferation
  by inducing PTEN expression, promotes metastasis by recruiting EZH2 to accelerate
  the EMT, and promotes tumor angiogenesis by inducing VEGF-A and HSP70 expression.
  j. The lncRNA HNF1A-AS promotes metastasis by accelerating the EMT. k. The lncRNA
  FOXCUT promotes invasion and metastasis by inducing FOXC1 expression. l. The lncRNA
  AFAP1-AS1 promotes metastasis by inducing AFAP1 expression. m. The lncRNA MEG3 promotes
  metastasis and is inhibited by miR-269-induced DNA methylation. n. The lncRNA H19
  promotes tumorigenesis by regulating DNA methylation. o. The lncRNA MALAT1 increases
  CSC activity by inhibiting miR-1 expression.
