caption: Hijacking of the RB-E2F pathway by viral proteins in the fungal ancestor
  and in cervical cancers. (A) SBF transcription factors in fungi may have arisen
  through a horizontal gene transfer event involving a virus encoding a KilA-N-related
  protein. (B) Human papilloma virus (HPV) encodes the E7 oncoprotein, which inhibits
  RB and activates endogenous E2F transcription factors to drive expression of cellular
  genes needed for viral replication. E7 is one of the viral genes that is integrated
  into the genome of most cervical cancer cells.
