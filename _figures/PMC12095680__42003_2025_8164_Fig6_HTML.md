caption: The key heterologous enzyme KivD (red) catalyses the conversion of 2-ketoisovalerate
  and 2-ketoisocaproate into isobutylaldehyde and 3-methylbutyraldehyde, respectively,
  which are subsequently converted into isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol by Synechocystis
  alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh). Genes (blue) targeted by the CRISPRa system were selected
  to enhance pyruvate formation and NADPH regeneration, hypothesised as key bottlenecks
  for IB/3M1B biosynthesis. Adh alcohol dehydrogenase, CBB cycle Calvin-Benson-Bassham
  cycle, DHAP dihydroxyacetone phosphate, FNR ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase, G3P
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, KivD α-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase, ME malic enzyme,
  PEP phosphoenolpyruvate, PK pyruvate kinase, PntAB pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase,
  PSI photosystem I, TCA cycle tricarboxylic acid cycle
