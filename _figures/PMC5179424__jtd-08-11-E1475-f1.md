caption: Irradiation induces ErbB/Rac1 activation to enhance proliferation and radiation
  resistance. HER2 is overexpressed by NF-κB in radiation-induced adaptive breast
  cancer cells, and subsequently drives signaling to P-REX1 Rac1-GEF for RAC1 activation.
  The activated RAC1 upregulates downstream proliferation and anti-apototic pathway
  involved in radioresistance and metastasis in HFR-selected survival breast cancer
  cells. Inhibition of Rac1-GEF, P-REX1, or RAC1 by treatment with dominative RAC1,
  N17Rac1, or GEFs inhibitors, NSC23766 and Ehop-016, resensitizes the resistant cells
  to irradiation.
