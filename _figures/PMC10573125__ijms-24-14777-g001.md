caption: 'Regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway by LNK in hormone receptor-positive
  breast cancer and non-tumor cells. Expression of IL-6R/gp130 and PRLR in non-tumor
  breast cells is closely associated with mammary gland development, whereas it is
  associated with cancer maintenance and initiation in hormone receptor-positive tumor
  cells. (1) Binding of IL-6 and PRL to their receptors induces activation of receptor-attached
  JAK2 kinases. (2) Active JAK2 phosphorylates STAT3 and STAT5 transcription factors.
  (3) STAT3 and STAT5 homodimers translocate into the nucleus and induce transcription
  of a number of genes that stimulate proliferation, differentiation, and survival
  of mammary cells. (4) STAT3 and STAT5 also stimulate the expression of LNK. (5)
  LNK localizes to the inner side of the cell membrane via interaction of the PH domain
  with membrane phosphatidylinositol lipids. This allows binding of the SH2 domain
  to JAK2, inhibiting the cascade. In tumor cells, constitutive activation of the
  IL6-IL-6R/JAK2-STAT3 and PRL-PRLR/JAK2-STAT5 loops may be associated with dysfunction
  of LNK. Three potential mechanisms have been proposed: (6) a reduction in LNK expression;
  (7) a blockage of LNK activity by binding with the inhibitor molecule 14-3-3; and
  (8) the presence of the SH2B3 missense variant rs3184504 (yellow star), which may
  be unable to interact with the cell membrane. As a result, increased proliferation,
  survival, migration, invasion capacity, and resistance to endocrine treatment have
  been reported. IL-6: interleukin-6; IL-6R/gp130: interleukin-6 receptor/glycoprotein
