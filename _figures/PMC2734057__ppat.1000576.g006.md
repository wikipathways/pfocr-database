caption: In the cartoon, the rodent malaria parasites P. berghei and P. yoelii, which
  are experimental but not natural pathogens of A. gambiae, exemplify a class of pathogens
  whose development in the host is inhibited by an APL1C-dependent mechanism. The
  “C-like” class of pathogens against which APL1C protects should include other unknown
  natural A. gambiae pathogens. The APL1C pathway is depicted superimposed on the
  Toll pathway because the Cactus/Rel1 module regulates levels of APL1C transcript
  and protein , but the presumptive extracellular signals that elicit APL1C protection
  are unknown, as are the immune receptors and the signalling intermediates except
  Cactus/Rel1. P. falciparum protection is mediated also by unknown immune receptors
  and signalling intermediates, and is shown superimposed on the Imd pathway because
  part of the Rel2 signaling module is involved. Specifically, the short Rel2 isoform,
  Rel2-S, which contains the Rel-homology domain (RHD) is required for host protection
  against P. falciparum infection and for APL1A gene expression. In contrast, the
  long Rel2 isoform, Rel2-F, does not influence protection against P. falciparum or
  APL1A transcript levels, and thus is depicted as a functionally unrelated shunt
  from the APL1A-terminated pathway.
