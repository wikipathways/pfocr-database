caption: Skeletal muscle releases to circulation several hormones denomined myokines
  acting as endocrine organ. Thus during exercise PGC1α is activated inducing FNDC5
  release which is cleaved to irisin. Irisin can act on different tissues, thereby
  brown adipose tissue activates UCP1 in mitochondria triggering transport protons
  chain in the mitochondrial membrane, resulting ATP increased and dissipating energy
  in form of heat. This process increases energy expenditure, reduces body weight,
  and improves metabolic parameters such as insulin sensitivity. Irisin on white adipose
  tissue stimulates BAT-like phenotypes changes, increasing PGC1α expression and thereby
  UCP1 and oxygen consumption while decreases WAT genes, process in which WAT stops
  behaving as energy reservoir for to use fat as energy source as in BAT, process
  named browning. For all of this, irisin has been proposed as a possible novel treatment
  in diabetes and obesity. Other target of irisin is nervous system where preliminary
  studies suggest that it could act on adipocyte metabolism through a novel neural
  pathway and on the other hand irisin induces neural proliferation and adequate neural
  differentiation, so it could also be a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative
  diseases such as Alzheimer or Parkinson.
