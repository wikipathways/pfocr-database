caption: 'Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. Schematic representation of
  TLR cellular location and their signaling pathways. TLR2, together with TLR1, TLR4,
  TLR5, and TLR6, is expressed on the external cellular membrane allowing the recognition
  of extracellular pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)/damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs), while TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are located in endosomal
  compartments where they bind nucleic acids. All the TLRs utilize the myeloid differentiation
  primary response protein 88 (MyD88) pathway except for TLR3, whose signaling depends
  on the TIR domain containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) pathway. As indicated
  by the red arrows, TLR2 dimers activate the canonical MyD88-dependent pathway that,
  through the recruitment of the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) complex and
  TNF receptor associated factors (TRAF)6, leads to the activation of nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK), and activating protein-1 (AP-1), with the consequent induction of
  pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Intracellular TLRs are mainly involved in
  the type I interferon response. TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 activate interferon regulatory
  factor 7 (IRF7) through the recruitment of IRAK and TRAF6. Since their signaling
  is initiated by MyD88, they can also activate the canonical pathway described above.
  Instead, the TRIF-dependent pathway, used by TLR3, or in some cases also by TLR4,
  leads to the activation of TRAF3 and consequently of IRF3, resulting in the induction
  of type I interferon (IFN) production. All arrows indicate activation: red arrows
  indicate the TLR2 signaling pathway, black and dashed arrows indicate all the other
  signaling pathways. Created with BioRender.com.'
