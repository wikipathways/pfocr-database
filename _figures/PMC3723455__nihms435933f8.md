caption: Proposed model of HNE disposal pathways. In addition to the well-established
  detoxification pathways for HNE, catabolism through fatty acid β oxidation serves
  as an important downstream pathway of HNE disposal. The catabolism of HNE is blocked
  under conditions where fatty acid β oxidation is inhibited under pathological conditions
  such as ischemia/reperfusion or when the heart is exposed to elevated concentrations
  of lipid. Diminished catabolism of HNE through β oxidation leads to a greater burden
  of disposal through detoxification pathways and an enhanced accumulation of HNE-modified
  protein, lipid and DNA. CAC; citric acid cycle.
