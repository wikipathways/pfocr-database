caption: Cell death pathways after irradiation. Apoptosis is mostly induced by irradiation
  (symbolized by the sinuous arrows and the trefoil) in hematopoietic cells, or in
  cells of the mucosa in the gastro-intestinal tract, or in p53 wildtype tumor cells.
  DSB-dependent activation of p53 results in increased expression pro-apoptotic genes,
  inducing the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (see the text for details). Additionally,
  apoptosis might be induced by irradiation due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production,
  or by activation of the second messenger ceramide, or the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
  In contrast, the cell fate in most normal tissues is senescence induced by the p53/p21
  and the p16/RB1 pathways, which result in cell-cycle arrest in the G1 phase and
  subsequent senescence (see the text for details). In p53-deficient cells, the blockage
  of CDK2-cyclinA/E by p21 is not functional; thus, centrosome hyper-amplification
  might occur, which is the prerequisite for mitotic catastrophe. This kind of cell
  death is caused by irradiation in most solid tumor entities. Arrows symbolize activation,
  the arrow with dotted line indicates a postulated effect; bar-headed lines symbolize
  inhibition. Targets for radiosensitization are in red, for radioprotection in green.
  See text for details.
