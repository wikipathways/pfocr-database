caption: (A) Mimosine biosynthetic pathway in leucaena. Serine acetyltransferase (SAT)
  catalyzes the formation of O-acetylserine from acetyl-CoA and serine. O-acetylserine
  (thiol) lyase (mimosine synthase) catalyzes mimosine biosynthesis from O-acetylserine
  and 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone [based on ]. (B) Mimosine degradation pathway in leucaena.
  Mimosine is degraded into pyruvate, formate and ammonia in two steps. First, mimosine
  is degraded into one molecule each of ammonia, pyruvate and 3-hydroxy-pyridone by
  mimosinase (). Then, 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone is further degraded by a dioxygenase and
  a hydrolase into one molecule of ammonia, one molecule of pyruvate and two molecules
  of formate ().
