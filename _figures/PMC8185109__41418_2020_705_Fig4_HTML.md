caption: 'In RNAi knockdown, the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), microRNA
  (miRNA) and short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) in the cell initiates recruitment of the ribonuclease
  DICER. DICER cuts dsRNA into shorter fragments called small-interfering RNA (siRNA).
  Argonaut is a key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that can
  bind non-coding RNAs, including siRNAs, and recruit the remaining RISC complex components.
  The RISC complex identifies mRNA of interest, via complimentary base pairing, and
  cleaves it, inhibiting translation of that protein resulting in a knockdown. The
  CRISPR/Cas9 system utilises the adaptive immune response of bacteria to conduct
  genome editing. Both Cas9 endonuclease, as a vector or protein, and gRNAs are required
  for this process. gRNAs (aka sgRNAs) are short synthetic RNA sequences composed
  of a tracrRNA, a scaffold sequence necessary to bind Cas9, and crisprRNA (crRNA)
  (a user-defined 20-bp nucleotide sequence complementary to the gene of interest
  (GOI)). Through complementary base pairing of the crRNA, the Cas9 is directed to
  specific genomic locations where it creates double-stranded breaks (DSB). Two principal
  mechanisms repair DSB: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination
  (HR). NHEJ is error prone and can result in insertions and/or deletions (INDELS)
  in the genome, causing frameshift mutations and leading to premature stop codons
  and gene knockout. The HR pathway uses template DNA and DNA synthesis machinery
  to repair the DNA without error, and can be utilised to incorporate point mutations
  or other genes (knock-ins).'
