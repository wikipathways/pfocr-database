caption: 'The biosynthetic pathway of salicylic acid and the modification strategy
  of this study. The abbreviations used in this paragraph are as follows: G6P for
  glucose 6-phosphate, GL6P for 6-phosphogluconolactone, 6PG for 6-phosphogluconate,
  Ru5P for ribulose 5-phosphate, R5P for ribose 5-phosphate, X5P for xylulose 5-phosphate,
  S7P for sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, GAP for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, E4P for erythrose
  4-phosphate, F6P for fructose 6-phosphate, FBP for fructose bisphosphate, PEP for
  phosphoenolpyruvate, OAA for oxaloacetate, CIT for citrate, ICI for isocitrate,
  α-KG for α-ketoglutarate, Suc-CoA for succinyl-CoA, FUM for fumarate, MAL for malate,
  and DHAP for 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate. The genes mentioned in
  this paragraph are as follows: aroG encodes 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate
  (DHAP) synthase, aroL encodes shikimate kinase, ppc encodes phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase, pchA encodes isochorismate synthase, and pchB encodes isochorismate
  pyruvate lyase'
