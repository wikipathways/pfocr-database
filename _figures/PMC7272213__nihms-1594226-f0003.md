caption: a | Pathogens such as Leishmania major are specialized to survive and replicate
  inside the phagolysosomal system. Microbial antigens at these sites drive the development
  of MHC class II-restricted T-bet-dependent CD4+ T cells, and the production of IFNγ
  by these cells is the dominant pathway that mediates parasite control. b | The ability
  to escape from the phagolysosomal system into the cytosol of host cells provides
  a mechanism for Listeria monocytogenes to avoid killing, but in this compartment,
  bacterial antigens are readily presented to MHC class I-restricted CD8+ T cells.
  In addition, innate responses mediated by natural killer (NK) cells also contribute
  to the production of IFNγ. c | Toxoplasma gondii replicates in a unique parasitophorous
  vacuole that does not fuse with the lysosomal compartment but fully engages innate
  and adaptive production of IFNγ. While the ability to generate parasite-specific
  CD4+ T cells is partially dependent on T-bet, the magnitude of the NK cell and CD8+
  cell response appears intact in the absence of T-bet.
