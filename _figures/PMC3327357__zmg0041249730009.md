caption: ECE-1 activity determines differential recycling fate of CRF1 upon Ucn1-
  or CRF-stimulation depending on agonist dose. 1, CRF or Ucn1 binds and activates
  CRF1. 2, βARR transiently associate with the receptor to mediate desensitization.
  3, CRF1 is endocytosed to Rab5 containing early endosomes. 4, Under low agonist
  conditions, ECE-1 facilitates dissociation of the ligands from CRF1, allowing CRF1
  to recycle and resensitize. 5, Under high agonist conditions, ECE-1 facilitates
  removal of Ucn1 from CRF1, thereby causing Ucn1-mediated receptor to recycle and
  resensitize. CRF then dissociates from CRF1 by an ECE-1 independent mechanism (presumably
  by an unknown peptidase?) that allows the freed receptor to recycle and resensitize.
  6, Rab11 knockdown studies suggest that CRF1 recycles and resensitizes via a Rab11-dependent
  pathway. The question mark (?) indicates that we did not test this at a low agonist
  concentration. 7, Recycled CRF1 is available for resensitization by CRF or Ucn1.
  8, ECE-1 is also present at the plasma membrane and gets constitutively shuttled
  between the plasma membrane and endosomes. 9, At low/basal agonist concentrations,
  ECE-1 activity regulates both Ucn1- and CRF-mediated Ca2+signaling, whereas ECE-1
  does not appear to affect Gαs-coupled CRF1 and downstream cAMP signaling. 10, At
  high/pathophysiological agonist concentrations, ECE-1 activity regulates Ucn1-,
  but not CRF-mediated Ca2+signaling, whereas ECE-1 does not appear to affect CRF1-mediated
  cAMP signaling. memb., Membrane.
