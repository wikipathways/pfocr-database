caption: Protein–protein interaction network of the differentially expressed proteins
  between IH-exposed HUVECs treated with or without estradiol (E2). The protein–protein
  interaction network exhibited hubs containing proteins related to cellular stress
  response including ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA topoisomerase IIb (TOP2B),
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EHMT1).
  The color and size of the nodes were set proportionally to the node degree by Cytoscape.
  The higher was the node degree, the larger was the size and brighter was the color
  of the node.
