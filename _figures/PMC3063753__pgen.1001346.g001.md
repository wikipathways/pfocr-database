caption: '(A) Dopamine biosynthetic pathway and enzymes (blue) with their inhibitors
  (red). TH converts tyrosine to L-DOPA, and then DDC converts L-DOPA to dopamine.
  AMPT is an inhibitor of TH, and HBH is an inhibitor of DDC. See text for the abbreviations.
  (B) Formulas for AILow and AIHigh. AI values: 1, all flies resided in the intermediate
  temperature region; 0, all flies distributed evenly between the intermediate and
  the other regions; −1, all flies distributed in the low or high temperature region.'
