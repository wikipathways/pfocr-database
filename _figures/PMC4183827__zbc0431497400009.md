caption: Proposed DAT/PAT, sulfolipid, and phthiocerol dimycocerosate biosynthetic
  pathways. Left, DAT and PAT biosynthetic pathway. The acyltransferase PapA3 initiates
  DAT and PAT biosynthesis on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane by transferring
  a palmitoyl group to the 2-position of one of the glucosyl residues of trehalose
  to form trehalose 2-palmitate. PapA3 next transfers a mycolipenoyl group, synthesized
  by the polyketide synthase Pks3/4, to the 3-position of trehalose 2-palmitate to
  yield DAT. FadD21 is the fatty acyl AMP ligase that provides the activated fatty
  acyl starter unit to Pks3/4. DAT is then flipped across the plasma membrane either
  by an as yet unknown flippase or by MmpL10 and further elaborated with mycosanoyl,
  mycolipenoyl, and/or mycolipanolyl chains by Chp2 on the periplasmic face of the
  plasma membrane to form the penta-acylated PAT. DAT serves both as the donor and
  acceptor substrate in these Chp2-mediated transesterification reactions. DAT and
  possibly PAT are taken up by MmpL10 and/or by other as yet unknown periplasmic and
  outer membrane proteins from the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and exported
  to the cell surface. The enzymes and transporters involved in the elongation, assembly,
  and export of sulfolipids (middle) and PDIM (right) and their localization in the
  bacterium are represented (for a recent review, see Ref. ). PpsA-E is a type 1 polyketide
  synthase responsible for the formation of the phthiocerol; Mas is mycocerosic acid
  synthase; TesA is a type II thioesterase thought to be involved in the release of
  phthiocerol from PpsE; PapA5 is an acyltransferase responsible for the transfer
  of mycocerosic acids to phthiocerol to form PDIM; FadD23, FadD26, and FadD28 are
  long-chain fatty acyl-AMP ligases; Stf0 is a sulfotransferase; and PapA2 and PapA1
  are acyltransferases responsible for the transfer of the first (palmitoyl or stearyl)
  and second ((hydroxy)phthioceranoyl) acyl chains, respectively, onto trehalose 2-sulfate
  to form the diacylated sulfolipid, SL1278. MmpL8 participates in the export of SL-I
  to the cell surface. MmpL7 participates in the export of PDIM. DrrABC and LppX are
  an ABC transporter and a periplasmic lipoprotein, respectively, required for PDIM
  to reach the cell surface. Sap is an integral membrane protein thought to facilitate
  the translocation of SL-I to the cell surface. The precise extent of sulfolipid
  and PDIM translocation mediated by MmpL7, MmpL8, Sap, LppX, and DrrABC has not yet
  been defined. Note that in the case of both sulfolipids and PDIM, the biosynthetic
  end products are formed on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane prior to
  export to the periplasm and outer membrane, whereas the Chp2-mediated elaboration
  of PAT from DAT occurs on the periplasmic side of the membrane.
