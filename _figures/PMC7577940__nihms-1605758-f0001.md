caption: Mechanical forces are sensed and transmitted across cells and tissues through
  a variety of mechanisms. (A) Cadherins, bound intracellularly to β-catenin, which
  in turn binds α-catenin, make up adherens junctions. (A’) Under tension, generated
  by actomyosin contractility, α-catenin recruits the actin binding protein vinculin.
  The mechanosensory function of adherens junctions allows the mechanical coupling
  of adjacent cells. (B) Focal adhesions, composed of Integrins, couple cells to the
  ECM providing cells with both mechanical and biochemical information. (B’) Under
  tension a series of intracellular adaptors are recruited to focal adhesions, including
  FAK, SRC, Talin and Vinculin, linking the focal adhesions to actomyosin. (C) The
  Hippo/YAP/TAZ pathway is a critical mechanosensitive signaling pathway. When there
  is low mechanical input MST1/2 kinases bind SAV1, phosphorylating LATS1/2 kinases
  which in turn phosphorylate YAP/TAZ, preventing them from entering the nucleus.
  (C’) When there is high mechanical input Hippo signaling is inactive, allowing YAP/TAZ
  to translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to TEAD transcription factors, driving
  target gene expression. (D) Dedicated mechanosensors, such as PIEZO proteins, can
  also detect forces within a tissue. (D’) When sensing crowding forces, PEIZO channels
  undergo a conformational change, enabling a calcium influx into the cell to impact
  downstream signaling.
