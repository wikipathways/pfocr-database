caption: Apoptosis and necrosis. IR-induced apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway begins with the development of DNA DSBs. ATM and CHK2 associated p53 phosphorylation
  events result in the nuclear accumulation of transcriptionally active p53, which
  in turn transactivates the pro-apoptotic genes PUMA, Bax, and Noxa. Cytoplasmic
  PUMA disrupts the Bcl-XL/p53 complex and liberates p53. Free cytoplasmic p53 disrupts
  the Bcl2/Bax complex by associating with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 and releasing
  the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Bax triggers cell death through the release of cytochrome
  c from the mitochondria, resulting in apoptosome formation and activation effector
  caspases and apoptosis. The extrinsic pathway involves signaling through death receptors.
  IR activation of p53, results in downstream transactivation of CD95/Fas and the
  CD95/Fas ligand. CD95/Fas ligand binding to CD95/Fas induces trimerization and clustering
  of the intracellular death domain (DD) region of the receptor. The DD recruits the
  adaptor protein, Fas-associated death domain (FADD). The death effector domain of
  FADD recruits pro-caspase-8, forming the death-inducing signaling complex. Activation
  of the initiator caspase-8 leads to activation of effector caspases and apoptosis.
  Additionally, IR-induced membrane stress leads to ceramide production, second messenger
  signaling, and apoptosis. RIP1 protein is associated with the FADD and is a key
  upstream kinase involved in the activation of regulated necrosis. Regulated necrosis
  is sustained in death receptor stimulated cells that are caspase-8 deficient or
  inhibited.
