caption: miRNA biosynthetic pathway and tools available for miRNA functional analysis.
  Primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts are produced by RNA polymerase II (RNA pol-II)
  and processed by the endonuclease Drosha and its cofactors in the nucleus. The resulting
  hairpin-shaped precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) is transported to the cytoplasm via Exportin-5
  for further processing by Dicer, an RNase-like enzyme, creating a 21-nucleotide
  miRNA duplex (miRNA5p–miRNA3p). The mature single-stranded miRNA is assembled into
  the miRNA-induced silencing effector complex (RISC). The RISC is then guided by
  the miRNA to complementary mRNA target sequences. Perfect sequence complementarity
  to the target mRNA results in mRNA degradation. Translational repression is initiated
  in cases of imperfect seed-region pairing. Modes of action of available tools to
  study miRNA-mediated functional aspects are also depicted. Lenti- or adeno-associated
  viral particles carrying pre-miRNA or coding sequences for either miRNA inhibitors
  or miRNA sponges are used to circumvent the problems of cellular uptake and to achieve
  long-term expression. miRNA mimics are synthetic double-stranded oligos; following
  cellular uptake one of the strands (the active strand) is incorporated into the
  RISC and directs downstream mechanisms to downregulate the mRNA target. The other
  strand (the passive strand) is degraded. miRNA inhibitors are single-stranded chemically
  modified oligonucleotides containing a sequence complementary to either the seed
  region or the complete sequence of the targeted miRNA. miRNA sponges are also like
  inhibitors but contain multiple sequences in tandem. Following cellular uptake of
  inhibitors or sponges, the endogenous miRNA is scavenged and cannot be incorporated
  into the RISC and contribute to mRNA cleavage or translational repression. miRNA
  target protectors work at the target mRNA level. Following cellular uptake, the
  target protectors bind to and block the miRNA-binding sites of the target mRNA from
  the RISC, ultimately resulting in bypass of RISC-associated mRNA cleavage or translational
  repression.
