caption: Integrated stress response signaling, from a metastasis perspective. ER stress,
  viral infection, amino acid deprivation, and heme deficiency activate PERK, PKR,
  GCN2 and HRI, respectively. These four kinases converge on phosphorylation of eIF2α,
  an initiation factor of protein synthesis, which leads to global translation attenuation
  but promotes the translation of certain specific mRNAs, including ATF4. The PERK-ATF4
  pathway is involved in oxidative resistance in two manners. On one hand, PERK directly
  phosphorylates Nrf2, causing the latter to disassociate with Keap1 and translocate
  into the nucleus. On the other hand, ATF4 directly drive Nrf2 transcription. Nuclear
  accumulation of Nrf2 triggers the transcription of redox homeostasis genes, including
  HO-1. ATF4 also enhances CREB3L1 transcription to promote cancer cell migration
  and invasion. However, ATF3, another target of ATF4, usually represses cell migration
  and invasion. In addition, LncRNA MALAT1 is a target of ATF4, which is critical
  for extravasation and subsequent outgrowth of cancer cells. MiR-708 can be up-regulated
  by CHOP, a downstream target of ATF4.
