caption: Schematic representation of MAPK signaling to the translational machinery.
  The Ras/ERK and p38MAPK pathways are activated by a wide range of stimuli, including
  cytokines, growth factors, and diverse environmental stresses. While many stimuli
  activate both MAPK pathways, stress stimuli and growth factors typically activate
  the p38MAPK and Ras/ERK signaling, respectively. While Ras/ERK signaling stimulates
  the activity of both RSK and MNK, the latter is also responsive to agonists of the
  p38MAPK pathway. MNK interacts with eIF4G and phosphorylates eIF4E on Ser209, a
  site that increases its oncogenic potential and facilitates the translation of specific
  mRNAs. Following activation of the Ras/ERK pathway, RSK phosphorylates rpS6, eIF4B,
  PDCD4, and eEF2K, which are important regulators of translation. RSK also modulates
  mTORC1 signaling by phosphorylating TSC2 and deptor. ERK and RSK regulate LKB1-dependent
  and -independent phosphorylation of raptor, resulting in increased mTORC1 signaling.
  ERK and RSK also collaborate in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis by promoting
  TIF-1A phosphorylation. Red T-bars represent inhibitory signals, whereas black arrows
  indicate stimulatory signals. P denotes phosphorylation. Abbreviations and detailed
  explanations about this signaling network are provided in the text.
