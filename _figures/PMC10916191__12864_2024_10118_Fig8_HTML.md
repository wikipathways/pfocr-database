caption: Working model of lipid synthesis induces by PPAR and cell cycle regulation
  in GCs after MLN4924 treatment. Rabbit follicular granulosa cells were isolated
  and treated with MLN4924, followed by transcriptomic and metabolomic sequencing.
  MLN4924 inhibits the intracellular neddylation process upon entering granulosa cells,
  impairing the PPAR signaling pathway, while also inducing apoptosis and cell proliferation
  in GCs. Inhibition of PPARα/γ down-regulates the target genes FABP3, FABP4, CD36,
  and LPL, which are involved in lipid transport, resulting in reduced fatty acid
  uptake. Similarly, the expression of CPT1 and CPT2 is also reduced, potentially
  inhibiting the process of fatty acid β-oxidation. ACSS2, responsible for linking
  acetate to CoA to produce acetyl-CoA, also shows reduced expression, affecting the
  availability of raw materials for fatty acid synthesis. Therefore, blocking neddylation
  within granulosa cells inhibited PPAR-mediated lipid metabolism and interfered with
  cell cycle progression
