caption: Therapeutic effects of irisin on OA during treadmill exercise via the inhibition
  of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway and pyroptosis in chondrocytes. Irisin is
  secreted during appropriate treadmill exercise and then released into the blood,
  eventually reaching the knee articular cavity to play its role in inhibiting inflammation
  and pyroptosis. Exercise-induced irisin interaction with chondrocytes leads to the
  downregulation of inflammatory responses and suppression of cartilage matrix degradation,
  subsequently inhibiting pyroptosis in chondrocytes. In addition, irisin inhibits
  chondrocyte inflammation and inflammation-related pyroptosis in IL-1β-induced OA
  chondrocytes by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway.

  description: Therapeutic effects of irisin on OA during treadmill exercise via the
    inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway and pyroptosis in chondrocytes.
    Irisin is secreted during appropriate treadmill exercise and then released into
    the blood, eventually reaching the knee articular cavity to play its role in inhibiting
    inflammation and pyroptosis. Exercise-induced irisin interaction with chondrocytes
    leads to the downregulation of inflammatory responses and suppression of cartilage
    matrix degradation, subsequently inhibiting pyroptosis in chondrocytes. In addition,
    irisin inhibits chondrocyte inflammation and inflammation-related pyroptosis in
    IL-1β-induced OA chondrocytes by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway.
