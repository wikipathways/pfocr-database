caption: Regulation of AMPK and mTOR activity. TRIM28 stimulates AMPK proteasomal
  degradation, through its degradative ubiquitination. The binding and ubiquitination
  of AMPK requires the interaction of TRIM28 with the protein MAGE-A3/6. TRIM37 is
  a negative regulator of autophagy that activates mTOR pathway by promoting the interaction
  between mTORC1 and RAG proteins. TRIM19 negatively regulates autophagy by controlling
  Ca2+ flux from ER to mitochondria to ensure ATP production. Regulation of BECLIN
  1 and ULK1 complex. TRIM5α, 6, 16, 20, 21, 22, 49, and 50 associate with both autophagic
  proteins ULK1 and BECLIN 1 assembling these factors in a complex and promoting their
  functions. Most of these TRIMs act in response to selective stimuli like HIV infection
  (TRIM5α), Endomembrane damage (TRIM16), interferon γ (IFN-γ) stimulation (TRIM20,
  TRIM21), and HDAC inhibition (TRIM50). A group of TRIM proteins regulates autophagy
  initiation preferably acting only on ULK1 or BECLIN 1. TRIM32 interacts with the
  autophagy cofactor AMBRA1 and promotes ULK1 kinase function by unanchored polyubiquitin.
  TRIM17 inhibits BECLIN 1 complex by promoting the interaction of BECLIN 1 with its
  negative regulator MCL-1. TRIM59 ubiquitinates and promotes the proteasomal degradation
  of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, inhibiting BECLIN 1 activity. TRIM28 positively
  regulates autophagy promoting VPS34 activation by sumoylation. Regulation of autophagy
  at transcriptional level. TRIM59 negatively regulates the expression of BECLIN 1,
  while TRIM22 stimulates autophagy by promoting BECLIN 1 expression. TRIM28 inhibits
  the expression of a series of autophagy inhibitory miRNAs. TRIM18 ubiquitinates
  and targets PP2A for proteasomal degradation, causing inhibition of TFEB activity.
  TRIM65 ubiquitinates and induces the degradation of TNRC6A, a component of the RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC), inhibiting the expression of a series of antiautophagic
  miRNAs. Proautophagic factors are colored in green, antiautophagic factors in red.
