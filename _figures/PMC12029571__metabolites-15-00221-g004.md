caption: 'UPR pathway. The red line indicates XBP1s. IRE1 pathway: in response to
  ER stress, IRE1 undergoes oligomerization and autophosphorylation, triggering the
  splicing of XBP1. The spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s) acts as a transcription factor
  to activate genes associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR). Additionally,
  the RNase domain of IRE1α mediates the degradation of specific mRNAs and microRNAs
  through a process called IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD). IRE1α also interacts with
  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein (TRAF-2), resulting in the phosphorylation
  of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and in the degradation of IκB, which leads to the
  activation of NF-κB signaling. PERK pathway: PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, which in
  turn stimulates ATF4. ATF4 regulates the expression of genes involved in the cellular
  stress response. ATF6 pathway: ATF6 is cleaved by the proteases S1P and S2P to produce
  its active form, ATF6f. ATF6f then translocates to the nucleus, where it initiates
  the transcription of genes involved in the UPR. Created with BioRender.com'
