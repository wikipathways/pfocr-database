caption: Estrogen (E2β) regulates uterine artery function partly via its actions on
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the endothelial cell (EC) and the large-conductance
  Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channel in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) during pregnancy.
  Shear stress stimulates eNOS activity, leading to increased NO production. E2β could
  increase the expression of eNOS in ECs via interacting with nuclear estrogen receptors
  (ERs) and/or elevate eNOS activity via interacting with the G protein-coupled estrogen
  receptor (GPER, GPR30) or membrane-associated ERα and ERβ. In addition, E2β increases
  the expression of the BKCa channel β1 subunit encoded by KCNMB1 and channel activity
  via upregulating ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1, encoded
  by TET1) in VSMCs. Moreover, the activity of the BKCa channel can be enhanced by
  NO-PKG signaling. In pregnancy complications, excessive oxygen species (ROS) impair
  the estrogen-NOS-NO-BKCa channel pathway.
