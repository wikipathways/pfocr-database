caption: The activation of ΔFosB transcription with morphine induction and inhibition
  of ΔFosB transcription via microinjection of BLF. When morphine is injected, high
  dopamine concentrations accumulate in the synapse. Dopamine binds to D1 receptors
  and then activates the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. Finally, the transcription activity
  of ΔFosB is regulated. Once translated, ΔFosB maintains a morphine addictive state
  by regulating genes involved in synaptic plasticity, leading to morphine dependence
  and tolerance. Nevertheless, BLF infusion can inhibit the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway
  to diminish the synthesis of ΔFosB and negatively mediate CK2 through some unknown
  pathways; thus, protein ΔFosB phosphorylation is inhibited, thereby promoting its
  degradation. Ultimately, the level of ΔFosB eventually may be negatively regulated.
  Gray arrows and text indicate the pathway inhibited by BLF injection. CaMKII, Calcium-calmodulin
  dependent protein kinase II; CK2, Casein kinase 2.
