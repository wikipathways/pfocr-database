caption: In vivo 2H/13C MFA has been used to address many important questions about
  metabolic pathway dynamics and regulation.(1) Assessment of genetic factors, dietary
  regimens, and treatment interventions in the control of in vivo metabolism. (2)
  Quantification of tissue-specific nutrient utilization and intermediary fluxes under
  normal versus disease conditions. (3) Tracing multi-tissue metabolic networks to
  elucidate inter-organ exchange fluxes and in vivo interactions. Created with BioRender.com.
