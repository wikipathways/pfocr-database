caption: T3SS expression in mutants of the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt pathway.
  (a) Diagram depicting the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt pathway. (b) Western blot
  analysis of PcrV expression in oxygen-limited planktonic cultures of P. aeruginosa
  PAO1 and the indicated TCA or glyoxylate cycle mutants (sampled at the exponential
  (PE; 12 h post-inoculation) and stationary (PS; 30 h post-inoculation) phases of
  growth). Note that as the aceE mutant had a growth defect, PE and PS samples were
  collected at 24 and 48 h post-inoculation, respectively.
