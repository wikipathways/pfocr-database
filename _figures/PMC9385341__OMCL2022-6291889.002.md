caption: 'The regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis in the pathological progression
  of CHD. There are three major independent regulatory pathways of ferroptosis: the
  System Xc-GSH-GPX4 axis, the GCH1-BH4 pathway, and the FSP1-CoQ-NADPH pathway. In
  addition, iron metabolism and lipid peroxidation are the main mechanisms. Abbreviations:
