caption: A proposed model illustrating the multiple signaling pathways by which PGRN
  (Atsttrin as well) exerts its anti-inflammatory actions. PGRN (Atsttrin) binds to
  TNFR2 and recruits unknown component, indicated by “X”, to the receptor complex(s),
  followed by the activation of anti-inflammatory pathway. In addition, PGRN (Atsttrin)
  antagonizes TNF/TNFR1 and TL1A/DR3 signaling and inhibits their inflammatory activities
