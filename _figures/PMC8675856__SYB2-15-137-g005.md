caption: Overall Representation of Integrative analysis. Yellow coloured boxes represent
  lncRNAs and pink coloured boxes represent their cis‐ and trans‐regulating mRNA targets.
  Red coloured lines with heads represent targets whereas arrows represent the constituent
  of the relevant signalling pathways. The lncRNA RP11‐108F13.2, based on analysis,
  targets mRNA gene TAF5L, which regulates basal transcription factors pigment epithelium‐derived
  factor induced signalling and the GPCR) pathway, RPL23AP2 was found to target CYP4F3,
  CYP4F8 genes which regulate and Arachidonic acid(AA) metabolism and lncRNA AL022324.2
  was observed to target LRP5L, AL022324.3 and Z99916.3, respectively Among them LRP5L
  acts in the regulation of the Wnt signalling pathway and the breast cancer pathway.
  While AL022324.3 and Z99916.3 were found as breast cancer targets, their complete
  annotation was not found. GPCR, G‐protein coupled receptorPathway analysis through
  different databases such as PathCards [], KEGG [] and literature search of the genes
  retrieved through integrative analysis was performed. A brief illustration of the
  pathways regulated by target genes is shown in Figure
