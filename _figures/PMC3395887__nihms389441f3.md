caption: Interaction of pathogen recognition and ST2 receptor systems with FcεRI leads
  to substantial enhancement of production of cytokines and chemokines. Panel A. Mast
  cell express receptors for IL-33 (ST2), various Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of which
  three are shown, and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) (see Section IIID). All these receptors
  act through the MyD88 to strongly activate the NFκB pathway. As discussed in Section
  IIID, the NFκB pathway is only weakly activated by low concentrations of antigen
  that barely stimulate degranulation but can still stimulate the NFAT pathway which
  ligands for ST2, TLRs, and NLRs do not. Both NFκB and NFAT are key regulators of
  cytokine gene transcription. Consequently cytokine production is amplified. As shown
  in more detail in panel B, additional amplification occurs at the level of the kinase
  TAK1 to enhance activation of the p38 and JNK MAP kinases and their downstream targets
  ATF2 and the AP1 component, c-Jun. A third level of amplification occurs through
  co-operative interaction between AP1 and NFAT.,  The calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine
  A, effectively blocks the NFAT pathway as well as cytokine production. The intermediate
  signaling steps between FcεRI and TAK1 is not determined and is indicated by the
  dashed line.
