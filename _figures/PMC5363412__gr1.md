caption: The Top Network Associated with the DERs Selected by the Criteria of 4-fold
  Change in Whole BloodThe functions related to this network are defined as cancer,
  organismal injury and abnormalities, and reproductive system disease. miRNAs, indicated
  as green half circles, represent the selected DERs. The connection with Ppara is
  shown using pink arrows. The analysis was performed using the Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA) program at http://www.ingenuity.com. Error bars show SD.
