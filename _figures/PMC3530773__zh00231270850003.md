caption: 'Vasopressin signaling network. Constructed from data reported by Hoffert
  et al. (). Colored nodes represent proteins that contain phosphorylation sites that
  are changed in abundance in response to exposure of suspensions of rat inner medullary
  collecting ducts (IMCDs) to the vasopressin analog dDAVP: red nodes, increased phosphorylation;
  green nodes, decreased phosphorylation. Proteins represented by individual nodes
  are designated by official gene symbols. User can obtain full protein annotation
  for each by going to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein and inserting the gene
  symbol. Series of four small boxes show direction of responses at 0.5, 2, 5, and
  15 min following dDAVP addition (red, up; green, down; yellow, no change). Edges
  are drawn based on ad hoc manual curation (see text). Background highlight shows
  individual modules: blue, canonical vasopressin pathway; yellow, calcium-dependent
  vasopressin signaling; green, Wnt signaling; pink, MAP kinase signaling; turquoise,
  apoptosis.'
