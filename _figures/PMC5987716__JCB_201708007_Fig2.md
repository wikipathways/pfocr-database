caption: SOD-dependent ROS signaling in mammalian cells. In aerobic organisms, many
  processes produce O2•-, including cytosolic xanthine oxidase (OX), the cytochrome
  P450-monooxygenases (CYP) in the ER, the mitochondrial ETC, and NADPH oxidase (NOX).
  NOX is a membrane-bound enzyme complex that can be found in the plasma membrane
  as well as within intracellular membrane structures or vesicles (). O2•- produced
  by the plasma membrane–bound NOX (e.g., NOX2) can act both intra- and extracellularly.
  H2O2 produced by SOD3 outside the cell can transverse into the cell interior in
  part through aquaporin channels to initiate intracellular signaling, whereas O2•-
  could influx through the chloride channel-3 (). The intracellular NOX complexes
  produce ROS in the lumen of a vesicular compartment, where ROS acts locally or from
  which it enters the cytosol (). H2O2 has been implicated in ROS signaling through
  oxidative modification of critical redox-sensitive cysteines in signaling proteins.
  The relatively well-recognized targets of ROS signaling include protein phosphatases
  (PTPs), nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs), and transcriptional factors (TFs). The signaling function
  of O2•- is yet largely uncharacterized. In C. elegans, it was shown that mitochondrial
  ROS act by signaling in part through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, likely via
  H2O2, triggering processes that promote longevity (). Compartmentalization of different
  forms of SOD provides an important mechanism for fine spatial control of ROS homeostasis
  and signaling, whose exact significance remains to be understood. CAT, catalase;
  GPX, glutathione peroxidase.
