caption: Early signals from the reproductive system determine somatic maintenance.
  (A) Proteostasis of young adult animals is robust, showing low levels of protein
  damage, effective activation of stress responses and high rates of stress survival.
  Following the onset of reproduction, signals from GSCs activate a regulatory switch
  that changes the proteostatic capacity of the soma. (B) Inhibiting GSC proliferation
  induces sterility and allows the organism to maintain robust proteostasis by somatic
  gonad signals, as seen in young animals. (C) DGLA supplementation during the L2–L4
  stage has a beneficial effect on proteostatic collapse, depending on somatic gonad
  function, and a negative effect on fecundity. (D) AA supplementation during the
  L2–L4 stage has a beneficial effect on proteostasis during adulthood.
