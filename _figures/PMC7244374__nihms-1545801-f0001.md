caption: 'Dietary retinyl esters (REs) and provitamin A carotenoids (pCars) are absorbed
  by enterocytes and converted into all-trans-retinol (ROL). The subsequent esterification
  of ROL enables the effective packaging and transport of REs by chylomicrons (represented
  by yellow spheres). Circulating chylomicrons deliver REs to the peripheral tissues,
  including the liver, where upon hydrolysis of REs resulting ROL is transported to
  hepatic stellate cells, re-esterified and stored. The mobilization of the hepatic
  pool of retinoids requires the hydrolysis of REs, transport of ROL back to the hepatocytes,
  and binding to RBP4. The complex of RBP4 and TTR is subsequently secreted to the
  blood stream. The effective uptake of ROL bound to RBP4 is achieved by the interaction
  of holo-RBP4 with its cell surface receptor, STRA6. Inside the peripheral tissues,
  ROL can be enzymatically oxidized to all-trans-retinaldehyde (RAL) and all-trans-retinoic
  acid (RA). In specialized RPE and photoreceptor cells, ROL can be utilized for the
  production of visual chromophore (11-cis-RAL) via the visual cycle metabolic pathway.
  Each step of the vitamin A metabolic pathways is accompanied by a set of specialized
  receptors, enzymes, and binding proteins. Those with known 3D structures are represented
  by colored cartoon structures. Proteins for which detailed molecular architectures
  remain unknown are depicted as grey colored models. Abbreviations used are the following:
  BCDO1, β,β-carotene-15,15-dioxygenase; CRABPs, cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins;
  CRBP1, cellular retinol-binding protein 1; CRBP2, cellular retinol-binding protein
  2; CRBPs, cellular retinol-binding proteins; LRAT, lecithin:retinol acyltransferase;

  retinol-binding protein; SCARB1, scavenger receptor class B type 1; SDRs, short-chain
  dehydrogenases/reductases; STRA6, stimulated by retinoic acid 6; TTR, transthyretin.'
