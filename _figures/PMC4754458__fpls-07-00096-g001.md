caption: 'The common symbiotic pathway. Ten proteins (in green) have been identified
  as essential for both RLS and AM. In contrast with the conventional representation
  of signal transduction along the common symbiotic pathway (A), CSP protein location
  in different plant cell districts (B) highlights the existence of significant discontinuities
  between three subsets of CSP members. The receptor-like kinase SYMRK is believed
  to interact with other co-receptors (such as NFR1 and NFR5) at the cell membrane;
  its cytoplasmic domain binds the mevalonate (MVA) biosynthetic enzyme HMGR1(3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl
  CoA Reductase 1), linking SYMRK activation to MVA synthesis in the vicinity of the
  plasmalemma. Three nucleoporins (NUP85, NUP133, and NENA) localize at the nuclear
  pore complex, but their role in signal transduction as well as their functional
  connection with the previous set of CSP proteins remains unclear. The final stretch
  of the CSP localizes to the nucleoplasm: here, repeated oscillations in Ca2+ concentration
  (spiking) are generated with the contribution of MCA8 (a nuclear envelope-bound
  ATP-powered Ca2+ pump) and the potassium channels encoded by CASTOR and POLLUX genes.
  Such Ca2+-mediated signals are believed to activate the nuclear kinase CCaMK. In
  turn, CYCLOPS phosphorylation by CCaMK preludes to the regulation of gene expression.
  (C) Presents a proposal model of receptor complex assortment and CSP protein role
  in two separate pathways for the transduction of Nod factors or chito-tetraose in
  legume root hairs and atrichoblasts, respectively. Localized on the plasma membrane
  of root hairs (left), the extracellular LysM domain of NFR1 and NFR5 directly bind
  Nod factors (). NFR1 and NFR5 form a complex with SYMRK () and HMGR1 (). MVA, produced
  upon HMGR1 activation () is small enough to diffuse through the nuclear pore complex
  without the involvement of nucleoporins (NUPs); nevertheless, the inclusion of three
  NUPs in the CSP opens the possibility that at least one additional unknown protein
  (A) is involved, which could be activated as a consequence of MVA production and
  translocated to the nucleus through the action of NUPs. Ca2+ spiking activation
  in the nucleoplasm is generated by the recursive release of Ca2+ through unidentified
  channel proteins (C) in the nuclear envelope, combined with the continuous action
  of ATP-powered Ca2+ pumps like MCA8 (; ). To consider a minimal number of unidentified
  proteins, we can assume Ca2+ channels are directly activated by nuclear-imported
  A. CASTOR/POLLUX has been proposed to act in concert with Ca2+ channels (). The
  resulting Ca2+ spiking activates CCaMK through a RLS-specific conformational change
  requiring calmodulin (; ), which then modulates the activity of gene expression
  regulators, allowing the establishment of RLS (). A parallel pathway acts in atrichoblasts
  (right), where chito-tetraose (CO4) released by glomeromycetes is recognised by
  a complex possibly including CERK1 (), SYMRK, and HMGR1. Also in this case an additional
  protein (B) is proposed to be activated by MVA. B is then translocated to the nucleoplasm,
  where it activates Ca2+ spiking signals with a distinct, AM-specific signature (;
  ). Consequently, CCaMK is activated in an AM-specific mode (; ), and its activity
  regulates AM-specific gene expression.'
