caption: Model depicting the functions of (p)ppGpp. Upon exposure to nutrient deprivation,
  the bacteria respond by activating the stringent response. This response is controlled
  by two nucleotide messengers, ppGpp and pppGpp, which function to shut down active
  growth and promote survival. [1] Once synthesized, these nucleotides can bind to
  the RNAP in Gram-negative bacteria, leading to altered transcription and decreased
  growth. In Gram-positive bacteria, these nucleotides instead bind to HprT and Gmk,
  two enzymes involved in the GTP synthesis pathway. Here, they inactivate the functions
  of these enzymes, resulting in decreased intracellular levels of GTP. This in turn
  results in altered transcription of a number of genes, mediated in part by the GTP-regulated
  control of the transcriptional repressor CodY and also by a decrease in the availability
  of GTP as an initiating nucleotide for transcription. [2] (p)ppGpp can bind to bacterial
  GTPases. In unstressed cells, these proteins associate with the ribosome and are
  thought to control the ribosome maturation processes leading to the formation of
  70S ribosomes. In stressed cells, the synthesis and binding of (p)ppGpp to these
  enzymes inhibits their GTPase activity, resulting in decreased 50S and 30S association
  and a reduction in the number of mature 70S ribosomes. This in turn slows growth,
  a consequence of which is an increase in the tolerance of bacterial cells to antimicrobials.
  [3] In addition to factors controlling transcription and ribosomal assembly, (p)ppGpp
  can also bind to proteins involved in translation, such as the elongation factors
  EFG and EF-Tu, replication, such as DnaG or lipid metabolism. Binding of (p)ppGpp
  to these proteins inhibits their function, again promoting a slower growth state.
