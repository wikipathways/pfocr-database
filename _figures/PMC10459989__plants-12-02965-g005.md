caption: The schematic diagram of the plant hormone signal transduction pathway and
  its correlation with DEGs in response to B. cinerea treatment. The investigation
  focused on all DEGs. Within the diagram, key enzymes related to the pathway were
  represented by colored shaded rectangles. The colors within the diagram represent
  the number of DEGs linked to each enzyme. Red represents that the number of DEGs
  exceeds 10, indicating a notable and statistically significant differential expression
  pattern; blue represents that the number of DEGs ranges from 2 to 8, suggesting
  a moderate differential expression pattern; yellow represents that the number of
  DEGs is approximately 1 gene, implying a minor differential expression pattern
