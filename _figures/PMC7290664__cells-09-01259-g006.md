caption: Functions of caspase-2 in DNA damage and cellular stress. After DNA double-strand
  breaks (DSBs), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM-related (ATR) kinases
  are activated and, in turn, phosphorylate and activate several target proteins,
  including checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and Chk2. Chk2 activates the p53 response pathway,
  which can lead to cell cycle arrest. ATM/ATR activation leads to the activation
  of caspase-2 and apoptosis, following irreparable DNA damage by an unknown mechanism.
  ATR also activates Chk1, which can then act in a feedback loop to negatively regulate
  ATR and inhibit further activation of nuclear caspase-2. DNA-dependent protein kinase
  (DNA-PK) is also activated by DSBs, probably by activation of ATM/ATR, then forms
  a complex with p53-inducible protein with a death domain (PIDD) and caspase-2 (DNA-PK
  PIDDosome). This complex phosphorylates and activates caspase-2, which then initiates
  non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and DNA repair. Caspase-2 is also activated by
  other stress signals such as metabolic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, cytotoxic
  drugs, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)). Heat shock recruits RAIDD (receptor-interacting
  protein-associated ICH-1/CED-3 homologous protein with a death domain), which also
  activates caspase-2 (inhibited by HSP90α). Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII)
  inhibits caspase-2 activation and cell death in oocytes. Activated cytosolic caspase-2
  cleaves Bid to its truncated form (tBid), which induces mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeability (MOMP), activation of caspase-9 and -3, and eventual apoptosis. P =
  phosphorous; PUMA = p53-upregulated mediator of apoptosis.
