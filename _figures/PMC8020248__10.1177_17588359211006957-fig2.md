caption: Dysregulated MET activation, signaling pathway, and tumorigenic consequence.
  Activation of MET in cancer cells, in general, is mediated through multiple mechanisms
  including ligand binding, activating mutation, receptor overexpression, aberrant
  splicing/alternative initiation, and transactivation through other receptor tyrosine
  kinases such as EGFR, IGF-1R, and RON. HGF-induced MET activation, a classical model,
  is functional through phosphorylation of several critical tyrosine residues and
  creates the C-terminal functional docking site, which recruits cytoplasmic molecules
  such as SOS and GRB2. The negative modulator c-CBL, a ubiquitin ligase, also binds
  the docking site and mediates MET endocytosis and degradation. Multiple signaling
  cascades, such as RAS/MAP kinase, PI3K/AKT, Wnt/β-catenin, and TGF-β/SMAD pathways,
  are activated upon MET phosphorylation in cancer cells, which creates a complex
  intracellular signaling network. The biological consequence is to induce cell proliferation
  with a malignant phenotype known as EMT, which leads to increased cellular survival,
  invasiveness, chemoresistance, and tumorigenic stemness.AKT, BCL-2, B cell lymphoma-2;
