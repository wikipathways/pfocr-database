caption: The SACPATH metabolic flux that gives rise to proline and pipecolate. As
  depicted in , the hydrolysis of saccharopine gives rise to glutamate and α-aminoadipate
  semialdehyde. Glutamate can be converted into proline by the action of P5CS and
  P5CR. P5CS converts glutamate into Δ1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate that is than transformed
  into proline by P5CR. The α-aminoadipate semialdehyde spontaneously cyclizes to
  Δ1-piperidine 6-carboxylate, which can serve as a substrate for P5CR to produce
  pipecolate.
