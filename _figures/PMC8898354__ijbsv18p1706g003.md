caption: The interaction between white adipose tissue (WAT) and the MGBA. In GF mice,
  excessive release of fasting-induced adipocyte factor (Fiaf) from the microbiota
  leads to the rapid production of visceral WAT (vWAT) . In HFD mice, the increasing
  intestinal omega‑6/omega-3 fatty acid (FA) ratio often directly affects the arcuate
  nucleus (ARC) and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN), promoting fat accumulation
  in WAT ,. Significantly, leptin released by WAT can regulate the output of the autonomic
  nerve system via acting on the hypothalamus. In addition to directly passing through
  the blood brain barrier (BBB), peripheral leptin has also been reported to bind
  to leptin receptors (lepR) on the presynaptic membrane of sensory neurons in WAT
  to connect with relevant encephalic regions ,. Exogenous LGG has also been proven
  to regulate the composition of intestinal microbiota and WAT‑derived leptin resistance
  by promoting hypothalamic cytokine signaling-3, which reveals the potential of WAT
  as a medium to contact with components within the MGBA . Interestingly, the other
  WAT‑derived adipokines, such as adiponectin and resistin also interact with the
  metabolic homeostasis of the gut and brain, the molecular mechanism of the former
  is associated with the DNMT1 and DNMT3a genes located around their DNA promoters
  ,. In addition, adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) originating
  from WAT play a unique role in interacting with the MGBA. Not only could they protect
  intestinal mucosa against inflammatory injuries by rebalancing the T cell repertoire
  and activating noncanonical Wnt signal pathways , but also can regulate inflammation
  in the central nervous system (CNS) through the brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF)-tropomyosin related kinase B (TrkB) pathway or by upregulating Nrf2/HO-1
  signaling . Interestingly, these latter two central pathways have also been reported
  to maintain intestinal metabolic homeostasis -.
