caption: Modular mechanism of the Piwi/piRNA pathway in C. elegans (PRG-1/21U RNA)
  for multigenerational transposable element silencing in the germline. (A) Transcription
  of 21U RNA precursors, small 25–26-nucleotide-long RNAs. (B) Truncation of two 5’
  precursor bases leave a 5’-uridine and further truncation at 3’-end creates mature
  21U-RNA. (C) The cognate 21 nucleotide’s long, 5’-uridine, mature 21U RNAs are bound
  to PRG-1. (D) PRG-1/21U RNA complex scans germline transcripts, recognising the
  target mRNA via imperfect base-pair complementarity and recruits RNA-dependent RNA
  polymerase (RdRP) to the target. (E) PID-4 and PID-5 proteins interact with PID-2
  and are hypothesised to play a role in controlling RdPR activity. (F) RdRP uses
  the targeted transcript for synthesis of complementary 22G RNAs that reinforce the
  PRG-1-initiated silencing mechanism. (G) 22G RNAs are loaded onto worm-specific
  argonaute proteins (WAGOs) and are transported to the nucleus for epigenetic silencing.
  (H) The 22G RNA/WAGO complex initiates silencing through deposition of heterochromatic
  marks at the target in a way that lasts several generations in a process termed
  RNA-induced epigenetic gene silencing (RNAe). The way in which the silencing becomes
  PRG-1-independent is currently unknown. Adapted from Ref. [].
