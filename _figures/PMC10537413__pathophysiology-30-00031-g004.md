caption: Several Strategies to Target MYC. Inhibitors of BRD4, CDK7 and CDK9 or G-quadruplex
  stabilizers inhibit MYC expression at the transcriptional level. Inhibition of the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway blocks MYC translation, whereas inhibition of RAF/MEK/ERK
  pathway, USP7, 28, 36, AURK and PLK1 inhibitors destabilize MYC at the posttranslational
  level. PP2A also dephosphorylates MYC at Ser62 and destabilizes MYC leading to MYC
  degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system. PP2A also inhibits the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  and RAF/MEK/ERK pathways. Omomyc drug functions to interrupt the MYC–MAX dimeric
  complex binding to DNA. Figure was created with BioRender.com, accessed on 5 August
