caption: Possible mechanisms of BBR to inhibit platelet activation. (1) In resting
  platelets, the majority of Rasa3 are located in the cytoplasm, while PI3K and CalDAG-GEFI
  jointly maintain the balance between GDP-Rap1 and GTP-Rap1. (2) When stimulated
  by agonists such as ADP, the PI3K signaling pathway is activated, and Rasa3 will
  translocate from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane, which is recruited by PIP3.
  As a result, the balance between GDP-Rap1 and GTP-Rap1 is broken, which causes the
  activation of integrin αIIbβ3 and the platelets. (3) When the platelets are pretreated
  with BBR or M2, the catalytic activity of class I PI3K p110β is inhibited. Rasa3
  will not translocate to the cell membrane and will remain in the cytoplasm, which
  will help to maintain the balance between GDP-Rap1 and GTP-Rap1. In this manner,
  the integrin αIIbβ3 keeps an inactive form, and the platelet activation is inhibited
  by BBR or M2.
