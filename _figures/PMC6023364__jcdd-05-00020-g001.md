caption: cGMP signaling and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) plasticity. (a) The
  canonical NO-cGMP-cGKI pathway in the vessel wall; (b) Concept of VSMC plasticity
  and (c) VSMC-derived cells and VSMC transdifferentiation in atherosclerotic plaques
  and potential role of cGMP. Note that monocyte-derived macrophages and other plaque
  cells are not shown. For further explanations, see main text. eNOS, endothelial
  NO synthase; iNOS, inducible NO synthase; nNOS, neuronal NO synthase.
