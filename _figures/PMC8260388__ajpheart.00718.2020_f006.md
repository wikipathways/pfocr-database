caption: 'Exosome-mediated signaling involved in angiogenic signaling pathways. Under
  physiological conditions (A), cardiomyocytes and telocytes release exosomes containing
  various miRNAs and bioactive molecules that promote proangiogenic signaling. Similarly,
  exosomes derived from cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxic conditions or glucose
  deprivation (B) contain various miRNAs that increase proangiogenic signaling pathways
  to stimulate endothelial cells to increase angiogenesis. In contrast, exosomes derived
  from cardiomyocytes subjected to pressure overload or type 2 diabetes (C) typically
  contain miR-300c and miR-320, which promote the antiangiogenic pathway. D: similarly,
  in peripartum cardiomyopathy, endothelial cell-derived exosomes can induce endothelial
  cells to downregulate several components of the proangiogenic signaling pathway,
  leading to impaired angiogenesis. VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; FGF,
