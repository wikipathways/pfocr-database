caption: The three major molecular pathways of colorectal cancer. The conventional
  chromosomal instability (CIN) pathway, initiated by APC mutation, then followed
  by mutations in KRAS, PIK3CA and SMAD4, loss of heterozygosity of p53 mutation was
  observed in most CRC cases. CRC progress and development via this pathway is often
  associated with no or low levels of the CpG island methylation pathway (CIMP- ),
  high levels of CIN (CIW+++), and microsatellite stability (MSS). Approximately one
  third CRC cases is regulated through the serrated pathway, which can be subdivided
  into CIMPlow MSS tumors with KRAS mutations, BRAF mutant CIMPhigh MSS tumors or
  BRAF mutant CIMPhigh microsatellite instability (MSI) tumors. Serrated pathway is
  commonly associated with silencing of 0-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT),
  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) or MLHl. MSI pathway is a third important
  pathway of CRC caused by dysfunction of DNA mismatch repair genes, encoding Mutl
  homolog (MLH) or MutS homolog (MSH) proteins.
