caption: Endurance exercise leads to the activation of AMPK and consequently to increased
  coactivation of PPARβ/δ by PGC-1α, resulting in improved mitochondrial oxidative
  function. Different pharmacological compounds may activate this pathway even in
  absence of endurance exercise and at least partially confer endurance performance
  benefits. Resistance exercise activates mTORC1 and increases coactivation of YY1
  by PGC-1α, presumably via phosphorylation of S6K (ribosomal protein S6 kinase).
  This also affects mitochondrial function. Rapamycin and other pharmacologic inhibitors
  of mTORC1, but also exercise interference can blunt this response. Exercise interference
  is a controversially discussed mechanism by which concurrent endurance exercise
  may negatively impact adaptations to resistance exercise by decreasing mTORC1 activity.
  AICAR, R419, Cpd14, Mk-8722, and Metformin are (potential) pharmacologic AMPK activators.
  GW501516 is a known pharmacologic PPARβ/δ activator. Arrows indicate activation,
  dashed lines indicate inhibition.
