  RNAs (siRNAs) play a role in the destruction of newly formed RNAs. Antisense oligonucleotides
  (ASO) work against the mRNAs and stop them from reaching the translation step. Capsid

  fail to further produce new cccDNA or virions. Nucleic acid polymers (NAPs) block
  the assembly and the secretion of spherical SVP. The release of subviral filaments
