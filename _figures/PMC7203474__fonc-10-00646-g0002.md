caption: Iron recycled and released by TAMs sustains the cancer progression. The pro-tumoral/anti-inflammatory
  macrophages adopt an iron-export phenotype. The released iron is absorbed by cancer
  cells, driven to mitochondria via mitoferrin-2 (Mfrn-2) and delivered to Fe-S clusters
  proteins essential for mitochondrial respiration and the activities of TCA cycle
  enzymes. TAMs rely on uptake of senescent red blood cells (RBC) and on the activity
  of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in order to recycle heme-iron and increase labile iron
  pool (LIP). Iron can be released via ferroportin (FPN) and after ceruloplasmin (CP)
  activity loaded onto circulating transferrin (Tf) for its uptake by cancer cells
  via the transferrin receptor (TfR). Alternatively, TAMs can use lipocalin-2 system
  or release ferritin to transfer iron. During cancer progression, tumor cells increase
  iron storage by ferritin (FT) overexpression, and iron uptake by upregulation of
  the ferritin light chain binding protein Scara5, transferrin-receptor (TfR) and
  lipocalin-2receptor (Lcn-2R). At the same time cancer cells decrease iron export
  by deregulation of ferroportin1 (FPN1). The figures have been prepared by assembling
  in-house built cellular metabolic pathway outlines with a modified and adapted version
  of BioRender images.

  description: Iron recycled and released by TAMs sustains the cancer progression.
    The pro-tumoral/anti-inflammatory macrophages adopt an iron-export phenotype.
    The released iron is absorbed by cancer cells, driven to mitochondria via mitoferrin-2
    (Mfrn-2) and delivered to Fe-S clusters proteins essential for mitochondrial respiration
    and the activities of TCA cycle enzymes. TAMs rely on uptake of senescent red
    blood cells (RBC) and on the activity of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in order to recycle
    heme-iron and increase labile iron pool (LIP). Iron can be released via ferroportin
    (FPN) and after ceruloplasmin (CP) activity loaded onto circulating transferrin
    (Tf) for its uptake by cancer cells via the transferrin receptor (TfR). Alternatively,
    TAMs can use lipocalin-2 system or release ferritin to transfer iron. During cancer
    progression, tumor cells increase iron storage by ferritin (FT) overexpression,
    and iron uptake by upregulation of the ferritin light chain binding protein Scara5,
    transferrin-receptor (TfR) and lipocalin-2receptor (Lcn-2R). At the same time
    cancer cells decrease iron export by deregulation of ferroportin1 (FPN1). The
