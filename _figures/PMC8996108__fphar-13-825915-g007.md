caption: BBJ could inhibit lung fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. Followed by a series
  of processing, BBJ was utilized in assays in vitro and in vivo. BBJ was proven to
  inhibit EMT in A549. BBJ could also suppress differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts
  induced by TGF-β1 proved by the changes of related proteins. In addition, in lung
  fibrosis, the C57BL/6 mouse model built by BLM, BBJ could prevent and ameliorate
  lung fibrosis by suppressing the Smad2/3 pathway and Stat3.
