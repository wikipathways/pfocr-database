caption: Rationale for choosing Arl13b, SMO, and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor
  1 (MCHR1) as cilia-targeting moieties. Mechanism of MCHR1 action (A) and a schematic
  (B) for tdTomato-MCHR1-N-10 plasmid. MCHR1 is a protein which belongs to a class
  A of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and localizes in neuronal cilia in the
  hypothalamus (). The translocation of MCHR1 to the ciliary membrane by the BBSome
  complex () allows it to play an important role in controlling energy homeostasis
  potentially through modulating cAMP signaling (). Mechanism of SMO action (C) and
  a schematic (D) for pEGFP-mSmo plasmid. Hedgehog (HH) pathway is uniquely associated
  with the primary cilium. Two key receptors for this pathway – Smoothened (SMO) and
  Patched (PTCH1) – localize within the ciliary membrane depending on the pathway’s
  activation stage. In the absence of HH ligands, PTCH1 accumulates at the ciliary
  membrane preventing translocation of Smo to the cilia. When the ligand binds PTCH1,
  it leaves the cilia allowing SMO to translocate and activate the pathway. Mechanism
  of Arl13b action (E) and a schematic (F) for L13-Arl13bGFP plasmid. Arl13b is a
  small guanosine triphosphate (GTPase) which localizes exclusively to the primary
  cilium, where it controls ciliogenesis through stabilizing the coordination between
  IFT-A and IFT-B complexes (). Additionally, Arl13b regulates translocation of SMO
  receptor to the cilia ().
