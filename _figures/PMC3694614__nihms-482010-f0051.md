caption: Free radical-producing MDRC are master regulators of airway inflammation.The
  three subsets of the myeloid lineage cells defined here express and use metabolites
  of the free radical pathways to differentially regulate T cell proliferation, Treg
  cell chemotaxis and AHR. The monocytic and granulocytic MDRC provide generally anti-inflammatory
  signals that suppress CD4+ T cell proliferation and AHR, whereas the macrophage-like
  MDRC enhance CD4+ T cell proliferation and exacerbate AHR. NO produced by the iNOS
  pathway or its metabolites regulate the numbers of Ly-6C−Ly-6G+ O2.−-producing cells
  that are recruited to the lungs, whereas NADPH oxidase-derived O2.− regulates the
  numbers of recruited Ly-6C+Ly-6G− NO-producing cells. The relative balance between
  pro- and anti-inflammatory MDRC contributes importantly to setting the inflammatory
  rheostat in the lungs.
