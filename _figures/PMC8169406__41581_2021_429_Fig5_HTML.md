caption: Endogenous nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity originates from the classical NO
  synthase (NOS) pathway and the alternative nitrate (NO3−)–nitrite (NO2−)–NO pathway.
  Signalling via NO and other bioactive nitrogen species involves soluble guanylate
  cyclase (sGC)-dependent formation of cyclic GMP (cGMP) as well as cGMP-independent
  effects. Kidney, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders are associated with reduced
  NO production and/or signalling, which might result from increased production of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) from NADPH oxidase (NOX), mitochondria or uncoupled
  eNOS owing to substrate or co-factor deficiency. Several approaches might increase
  NO bioactivity. First, increasing or restoring endogenous NOS activity by supplementing
  with l-arginine, l-citrulline or tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), inhibiting arginase
  or blocking the endogenous NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Statins,
  novel modulators of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and compounds
  that increase hydrogen sulfide (H2S) formation or signalling might also restore
  NOS activity. Second, inhalation of NO or inorganic NO2−, treatment with organic
  nitrates that directly or indirectly increase NO generation independent of the NOS
  system or dietary supplementation with inorganic nitrate. Compared with inhalation
  of NO and organic nitrates, the dietary approach, using inorganic nitrate, has a
  more favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and is associated with
  lower risk of tolerance and adverse effects. Third, limiting NO metabolism, for
  example, by reducing the generation of ROS and thereby preventing scavenging of
  NO, for example, using novel antioxidants and NOX inhibitors. In addition, angiotensin-converting
  enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonists, which
  block angiotensin II (Ang II) formation and signalling, respectively, might reduce
  mitochondrial and NOX-derived ROS generation. Another novel approach is to oppose
  classical Ang II signalling by targeting the ACE2−neutral endopeptidase (NEP)−Ang(1−7)−AT2−Mas
  receptor pathway using an ACE2 stimulator, AT2 receptor agonist or Mas receptor
  agonist. Activation of this pathway has been associated with increased eNOS function.
  Finally, NO signalling can be facilitated by modulating downstream signalling pathways
  using phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, which inhibit the breakdown of cGMP,
  sGC modulators (both stimulators and activators) or compounds that increase H2S
  signalling. R-ONO2, nitrate ester.
