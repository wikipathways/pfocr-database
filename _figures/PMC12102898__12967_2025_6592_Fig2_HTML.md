caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway processes and associated ubiquitination.
  Under normal conditions (Wnt Off), β-catenin binds to the degradation complex and
  is phosphorylated, subsequently recognized by E3 ubiquitin ligase (β-TrCP) and undergo
  ubiquitination and degragdation. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is initiated
  by binding of Wnt ligand protein to transmembrane protein FZD receptor (Wnt On),
  Dvl protein will be recruited to the cell membrane to bind FZD, and then Dvl protein
  interacts with Axin to recruit a protein complex composed of Axin, GSK-3β and APC.
  This progress allows the β-catenin protein to enter the cell and direct downstream
  gene transcription. Most E3 ubiquitin ligases protect against Wnt signaling pathway
  transduction and eventual oncogene transcription through ubiquitining and degrading
  related proteins, but are underexpressed in HCC
