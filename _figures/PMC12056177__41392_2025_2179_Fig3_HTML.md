caption: Typical RTKs-activated signaling cascades. Activation of the receptors (including
  growth factor receptors such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR),
  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR),
  and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), as well as tyrosine kinase receptor
  B (TrkB) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1R)) by the corresponding cytokines,
  growth factors, and hormones induces autophosphorylation of their receptor tyrosine
  residues within the cell, thereby further amplifying the kinase activity, exposing
  the tyrosine phosphorylation docking sites, allowing them to be recognized by cytoplasmic
  proteins with Src homology 2 domain (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains.
  Activated RTKs are able to recruit various signaling molecules and initiate downstream
  pathways. One major pathway involves the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase
  (PI3K), which converts PIP2 to PIP3, thereby activating AKT. Another pathway involves
  phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ), which, upon phosphorylation, stimulates protein kinase
  C (PKC) activity and mobilizes intracellular calcium (Ca2+). Concurrently, the RTK
  signaling cascade engages the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway via GRB2. Collectively, these
  pathways regulate diverse cellular processes, including cell cycle progression,
  proliferation, differentiation, survival, migration, metabolism, and other key functions.
