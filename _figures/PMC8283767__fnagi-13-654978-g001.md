caption: (A) The molecular mechanisms of the PIWI-piRNA pathway. The PIWI protein
  and piRNA form a complex. (i) Gene silencing at the transcriptional level. The PIWI-piRNA
  complex through recruiting a chromatin methylation complex to the nucleus, often
  serve as repressive chromatin modification. (ii) Gene silencing at the posttranscriptional
  level. PIWI protein serve as the endonuclease activity to inducing the cleavage
  of the target mRNAs in the cytoplasm. (iii) PiRNAs through binding to lncRNAs, release
  miRNAs from the binding sites of lncRNAs to induce target mRNA degradation. (B)
  Mechanisms of lncRNA-miRNA interaction. (i) LncRNAs act as miRNAs sponges. LncRNAs
  can sponges miRNAs through miRNA reaction elements (MREs) and suppress the targeting
  mRNAs degradation mediated by miRNAs. (ii) LncRNAs can function as miRNA precursors
  that generate specific miRNAs by intracellular RNA splicing and enhance the posttranscriptional
  regulation of target mRNAs. (iii) MiRNAs in RISCs can target and reduce some lncRNAs
  stability through imperfect base-pairing. (C) (i) CircRNAs function as miRNA sponges
  to bind to miRNAs and inhibit target mRNAs degradation. (ii) CircRNAs interact with
  the Pol II complex in the nucleus to influence mRNA transcriptional levels. (iii)
  CircRNAs bind to RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to influence mRNA transcriptional levels.
  (iv) CircRNAs function as mRNA trap to influence mRNA splicing and protein translation.
