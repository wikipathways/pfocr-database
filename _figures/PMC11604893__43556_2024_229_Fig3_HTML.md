caption: Schematic diagram of SWI/SNF complex regulating tumor metabolismThe purple
  gene and arrow represent glucose metabolism. PB1 deficiency can increase the expression
  of PFKP, ENO1, PKM and LDHA, activate AKT-mTOR signaling, and significantly increase
  the concentration of lactate in cells. The coding gene SMARCA2 of BRM negatively
  regulates PKM2 to inhibit glycolysis, negatively regulates the expression of AMPKα1
  coding gene PRKAA1 to inhibit the transport of glucose by GLUT-1, and overexpression
  of BRM can also increase the expression of FBP1 to promote cellular glycolysis.
  Deletion of ARID1A inhibits the expression of the key glycolysis gene PKM, leading
  to suppression of glycolysis. Cytoplasmic ARID1B interacts with c-RAF, stimulating
  the RAF-ERK signaling pathway. The activated transcription factors MYC and HIF1α
  then jointly promote the expression of GLUT and glycolytic enzymes, increasing glucose
  levels, glycolytic flux, and lactate production in cancer cells. Orange genes and
  arrows are associated with lipid metabolism. Silencing SMARCD1 can inhibit the activity
  and transcriptional activation ability of PGC-1α, downregulate the expression levels
  of fatty acid oxidation genes, and lead to significant accumulation of lipid droplets
  in liver cancer cells. SMARCD3 and FOXA1 cooperatively regulate the core genes involved
  in lipid and fatty acid metabolism, including Pparg, Scd1, Hmgcr, Ptgs1, and Vldlr,
  leading to an increase in the cellular content of fatty acids. Deletion of the ARID1A
  gene significantly reduces the expression of lipid beta-oxidation-related genes
  such as PPAR-alpha, Lcad, Acox-1, and cpt-1, leading to decreased lipid consumption
  and passive lipid accumulation. The blue gene and arrow represent glutamine metabolism.
  ARID1A is the first enzyme in glutamine breakdown and a transcriptional repressor
  of the rate-limiting enzyme GLS1, inhibiting glutamine metabolism through GLS1.
  The green gene and the arrow represent urea metabolism. Baf60a (SMARCD1) cooperates
  with Y-box binding protein-1 to inhibit the transcription of carbamoyl-phosphate
  synthetase 1 (CPS1), thereby suppressing urea synthesis
