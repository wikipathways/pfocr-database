caption: Overview of metabolic and transcriptomic responses of the polymyxin-susceptible
  PAK strain (A) and polymyxin-resistant PAKpmrB6 strain (B) to polymyxin B treatment.
  In strain PAK, polymyxin B (4 mg/liter) significantly upregulated the PmrAB regulatory
  system and related genes, resulting in the increased L-Ara4N synthesis. Meanwhile,
  polymyxin B induced severe oxidative stress and osmotic imbalance and significantly
  decreased metabolite levels related to LPS and peptidoglycan synthesis in the wild-type
  PAK strain. In contrast, in strain PAKpmrB6, 4 mg/liter polymyxin B did not activate
  the PmrAB system and related genes; therefore, the L-Ara4N synthesis pathway was
  not affected. Moreover, polymyxin B significantly elevated the metabolites associated
  with LPS and peptidoglycan synthesis pathways in the polymyxin-resistant PAKpmrB6
  strain. In addition, polymyxin B induced osmotic stress in both PAK and PAKpmrB6
  strains. It is also notable that in both strains, a high concentration of polymyxin
  B (8× MIC) significantly decreased fatty acid and phospholipid levels but increased
  lipoamino acid levels. The red and blue arrows indicate that the levels of metabolites
  were significantly increased and decreased, respectively (fold change > 2, P < 0.05,
  FDR < 0.05, Student’s t test).
