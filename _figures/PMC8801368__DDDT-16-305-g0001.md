caption: PR/RANKL signal in human breast. Progesterone can increase RANKL in PR positive
  luminal breast epithelial cells mainly through inducing the transcription or stabilization
  of RANKL mRNA. Then the paracrine of RANKL induce the proliferation neighboring
  PR negative luminal cells by activating NF-κB and cyclin D1 pathways. Activated
  RANKL is also involved in the process of myoepithelium to mammary stem cell and
  epithelial expansion. PR can mediate CXCL12-CXCR4 and Wnt Pathway within luminal
  and basal compartment.
