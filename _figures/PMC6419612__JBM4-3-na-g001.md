caption: Metastatic progression in the bone. (A) Tumor‐derived factors promote the
  formation of a premetastatic niche in the bone prior to tumor cell dissemination.
  Factors such as lysyl oxidase (LOX) and C‐C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) disrupt
  normal bone homeostasis thereby favoring tumor cell colonization. (B) Disseminated
  tumor cells (DTCs) enter the circulation and can eventually home to the bone via
  microenvironmental signals including CXCL12:CXCR4 and E‐selectin. (C) Following
  extravasation, interaction with resident bone cells and signaling molecules such
  as leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), p38, and thrombospondin‐1 (TSP1)
  maintain tumor cells in a dormant state. (D) Emergence of DTCs from dormancy results
  in the outgrowth into overt metastases. Tumor cell proliferation and osteolytic
  bone destruction is mediated by parathyroid hormone‐related protein (PTHrP), receptor
  activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL), and vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 (VCAM‐1).
  The growth of neovasculature within the metastasis produces transforming growth
  factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) and periostin to further promote the proliferation of metastatic
  tumor cells. CAF = cancer‐associated fibroblast; CXCL12 = CXC Chemokine Ligand 12;
