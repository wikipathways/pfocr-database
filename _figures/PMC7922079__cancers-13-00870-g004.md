caption: Targeting EPC expansion as a novel therapeutic strategy. Cancer-induced dysregulation
  of erythropoiesis resulting in the differentiation arrest of EPCs and their expansion
  may be diminished by different agents. Inhibitors of (1) transforming growth factor
  β (TGF-β) and (2) BMP signaling rescue maturation arrest. (3) Caspases inhibitors
  inhibit GATA1 cleavage triggered by the inflammasome. (4) P38 inhibitors promote
  differentiation and decrease the apoptosis of EPCs. (5) JAK inhibitors decrease
  activation of EPO-induced signaling, which decreases EPCs expansion. (6) mTOR inhibitors
  and inducers of FoxO3 promote differentiation of early-stage EPCs. (7) Increasing
  serotonin (5-HT) concentration with either selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
  (SSRIs) or inhibitors of the kynurenine metabolism pathway promotes differentiation
  of EPCs. (8) Enasidenib, an inhibitor of mutated IDH2 promotes terminal differentiation
  of EPCs.
