caption: A pathway description of the differentially expressed starch metabolism-related
  genes and their ratios between superior and inferior spikelets at 9 DPA. The ratio
  means the fold difference in the respective gene expression of superior to inferior
  spikelets, which was calculated according to microarray data, as described in Supplementary
  Table S3 at JXB online.
