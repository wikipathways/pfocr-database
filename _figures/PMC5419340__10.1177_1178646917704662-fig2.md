caption: Diet supplies nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide riboside as
  well as the essential amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan can be degraded to synthesise
  nicotinamide when there is dietary stress by the kynurenine ‘de novo’ ‘immune tolerance’
  pathway. Symbionts, whether in gut or TB, are a backup source as is ‘autocarnivory’.
  Salvage pathways are extensive and efficient to conserve NAD/nicotinamide as NAD
  consumers mean that there is a continuous need for replenishment. Many are involved
  in repair and disease processes and ageing. Excess nicotinamide can be excreted
  after a methylation reaction by NNMT. NNMT, indicates nicotinamide N-methyltransferase;
  TB, tuberculosis.
