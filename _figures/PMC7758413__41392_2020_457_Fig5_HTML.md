caption: Gene function network revealed a core role of the AP-1 linked signaling pathways
  during the recovery of COVID-19. a A network showing the relationship between genes
  and enriched KEGG pathway. The genes displayed are selected from the DEGs and the
  genes regulated by DEmiRNAs or DElncRNAs with a more significant differential expression
  and a higher connectivity. The color maps the linear regression slope of Log2 fold
  change of a gene. The size of the circle is proportional to the number of genes
  enriched in a KEGG pathway. b A KEGG graph showing the interactions of genes involved
  in the TNF signaling pathway. The color indicates linear regression slope of Log2
  fold change of a gene. c A protein–protein interaction network (PPI) showing the
  interactions between genes and non-coding RNA. The genes displayed are selected
  from the top hub genes with the most significant differential expression. d A line
  graph showing the expression profiles of the main hub genes during COVID-19 recovery.
  The color indicates samples with different clinical types. T, treatment stage; C,
  convalescence stage; R, rehabilitation stage. The data are shown as mean ± SD
