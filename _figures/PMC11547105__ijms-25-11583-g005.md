caption: 'Overview of the triacylglycerides metabolic pathway showing the differentially
  accumulated metabolites in low (ICMB89111, ICMB94111, ICMB95111, and ICMB95222),
  medium (81 B and ICMB96222), and high rancid (842 B, ICMB98222, ICMB95444, and ICMB91222)
  pearl millet genotypes. The enzymes are FAS, fatty acid synthase; FAT, fatty acid
  thioesterase; FAD, fatty acid desaturase; ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase; GPAT, glycerol
  3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase; PAP, phosphatidic
  acid phosphatase; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase; TA, reversible transacylase
  and PDAT, phosphatidylcholine: diacylglycerol acyltransferase and two organelles
  are mentioned in red color fonts. The log2 fold change abundance values of the intermediate
  metabolites involved in various steps of the pathway obtained across the 10 pearl
  millet lines (mid-right) are represented as heatmaps (red and green indicating high
  and low abundance values, respectively)'
