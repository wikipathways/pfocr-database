caption: NF-κB in the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  requires two signals, priming and activation. A prototypical example of priming
  is bacterial LPS binding to TLR4, leading to the activation of NF-κB signaling.
  In the nucleus, the active NF-κB promotes the transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes,
  such as NLRP3, Pro-IL-1β and Pro-IL-18, which are necessary for inflammasome activation.
  The second signal of inflammasome activation is provided by NLRP3 agonists that
  activates NLRP3 to trigger inflammasome assembly and mature IL-1β secretion. To
  date, mitochondrial damage is the most widely studied activating stimuli for NLRP3
  pathway in terms of its connection to diverse inflammatory, metabolic and malignant
  diseases. NF-κB induces delayed accumulation of the autophagy receptor p62, which
  can specifically bind to mitochondrial poly-ubiquitin chains though E3 ubiquitin
  ligase Parkin, and thereby, negatively regulate inflammasome activation via mitophagic
  elimination.
