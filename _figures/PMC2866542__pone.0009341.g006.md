caption: This is one of the canonical pathways that contains statistically significantly
  more genes than expected by chance in the group of 114 genes with RPE-specific expression.
  This figure shows the proteins corresponding to the overrepresented genes. Colored
  symbols indicate their presence among the 114 genes with RPE-specific expression,
  uncolored genes are added by the software to form pathways. Solid lines between
  molecules indicate direct physical relationships between molecules (such as regulating
  and interacting protein domains); dotted lines indicate indirect functional relationships
  (such as co-regulation of expression of both genes in cell lines).
