caption: Cooperative oncogenesis results from the atypical interplay of various signaling
  pathways that display several tumor cancer hallmarks. (A) In scrib−/− benign tumors,
  the JNK pathway (green) has an antitumorigenic function. It is activated by the
  TNF Eiger, which binds to the TNFR Wengen (Wgn). Elevated endocytosis levels contribute
  to activating the Eiger/Wgn complex that activates a phosphorylation event cascade
  involving successively the JNKKKK, JNKKK, and JNKK. Ultimately, the JNK Basket is
  phosphorylated and activates its downstream AP-1 TFs effectors. AP-1 TFs stimulates
  the expression of the proapoptotic factors rpr and hid, which execute apoptosis
  a well as paxillin and mmp1, which leads to basement membrane degradation. Simultaneously,
  the loss of cell polarity initiated by the loss of function of scribble provokes
  aPKC (blue) signaling impairment, which results in the activation of the SWH target
  Yki (orange). Yki together with Sd activates the expression of cyclinE and causes
  overproliferation. Finally, DE-cadherin expression decreases, contributing further
  to the loss of cell polarity phenotype. (B) In RasV12 hyperplastic tumors, the Scrib
  (grey) and aPKC (blue) apical complexes usually are localized close to the adherens
  junction and in the apical part, respectively. The aberrantly active RasV12 stimulates
  the downstream Raf/Mek/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways (purple) responsible for cyclinE
  (overproliferation) and dmyc (cell growth) overexpression, respectively. (C) In
  the RasV12; scrib−/− neoplastic tumors, JNK is protumorigenic. The upstream JNK
  signaling is not fully explored in the eye-antennal disc tumors yet. It seems to
  involve Eiger binding to Grnd mainly (and Wgn), which further activates the JNKKKK
  Msn, the JNKKK Tak1, the JNKK Hep, and Bsk. A parallel Src-dUev1/Ben/dTraf2 axis
  elevates the activity of Hep upstream of Bsk. The novel JNKK MMK3 and the nonreceptor
  tyrosine kinase FER might also contribute to Bsk activity. Bsk triggers the activation
  of the TFs Fos, Ets21c, and Ftfz1, which upregulate the expression of the BTBZF
  chinmo and abrupt (resistance to neuron differentiation), mmp1 and cher (basement
  membrane degradation and invasion), as well as dilp8 and upd (developmental delay).
  Whether they also elevate hid transcription is unknown. In parallel, lowering of
  SWH signaling leads to the activation of Yki (orange). Together with Sd, Yki activates
  the expression of dmyc (cell growth), cyclinE (proliferation), dilp8 and upd (developmental
  delay, not demonstrated) and of some other signaling components such as upd and
  stat (JAK-STAT pathway) as well as fos and ftzf1 (JNK pathway). RasV12 activates
  the Raf/Mek/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, contributing to the expression of dmyc (cell
  growth) and cyclinE (proliferation). It also inhibits hid expression and Hid activity,
  protecting RasV12; scrib−/− cancer cells from apoptosis. Finally, tumor-secreted
  Upds activate the JAK-STAT pathway in an autocrine manner and contribute to ROS
  production and tumor growth through an unknown mechanism.
