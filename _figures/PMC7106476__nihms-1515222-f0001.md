caption: 'GCs have been described to differentially affect basal intracellular Ca2+
  ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis. Depending on the cell type studied and GC applied, GCs can
  either reduce or augment basal [Ca2+]i. (A) GCs may decrease [Ca2+]i by activating
  AC/PKA mediated mechanisms, likely through events taking place at the cell membrane
  level and independent of GR stimulation, ultimately leading to SERCA activation
  (thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase). (B) Conversely, GCs can activate PLC/IP3 and
  PKC dependent signaling cascades resulting in enhanced basal [Ca2+]i; the involvement
  of GR in this process is currently unknown. (C) Agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]i
  can be counteracted by GC-mediated activation of AC/PKA-induced stimulation of SERCA
  pumps as described in ATP stimulated cells. In contrast, a functional role for PKC
  was determined in the effects of GC on serotonin-induced Ca2+ responses, suggesting
  that the acute inhibitory mechanisms of GCs are highly agonist specific. (D) Limited
  studies are available on acute potentiating effects by GCs on agonist-induced Ca2+
  responses; in neuronal cells it was suggested that these effects are mediated via
  the rapid activation of Ca2+-influx through ionotropic ATP-gated purinergic 2X receptors.
  Whether glucocorticoid-mediated membrane receptors are involved in this pathway
  remains to be further investigated (mGR?). These responses rely on the presence
  of external Ca2+. Abbreviations: AC, adenylyl cyclase; AR, agonist receptor; IP3,
  inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate; GC, glucocorticoid; mGR, membrane glucocorticoid
  receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; SERCA, sarco/endoplasmatic
  reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase.'
