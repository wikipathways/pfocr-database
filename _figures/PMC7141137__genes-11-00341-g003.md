caption: Intracellular regulators that link morphogen signaling pathways during DV
  and AP patterning of the ectoderm in vertebrate embryos. The genes six3 and evx1
  are expressed in the anterior and posterior neuroectoderm, respectively. Although
  both Six3 and Evx1 interfere with the BMP pathway by suppressing BMP ligand expression,
  these factors have opposite functions in AP patterning of the ectoderm. Six3 suppresses
  the expression of Wnt ligands to facilitate the formation of anterior neural tissue.
  Evx1 activates RA signaling by the induction of RA-synthesizing enzyme and the suppression
  of RA-degrading enzyme and thus enhances posterior development. FoxB1, Zbtb14, and
  Clk2 (highlighted in the orange square) reduce the level of C-terminally phosphorylated
  Smad1/5/8 (pSmad1/5/8) to inhibit BMP signaling, thereby promoting neural induction
  (dorsalization) of the ectoderm. These three factors are also involved in the posteriorization
  of neural tissue induced by BMP inhibition, albeit through different mechanisms.
  FoxB1 induces the expression of Wnt and FGF ligands, and Zbtb14 enhances Wnt signaling
  by increasing the accumulation of β-Catenin. Clk2 elevates the level of diphosphorylated
  mitogen-activated kinase (dpMAPK) induced by FGF, and thus Clk2 promotes FGF-mediated
  posteriorization. Green, neural/dorsal ectoderm; blue, epidermal/ventral ectoderm;
