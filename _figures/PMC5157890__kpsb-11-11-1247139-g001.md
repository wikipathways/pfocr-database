caption: Simplified model of hormone signaling pathways under different abiotic stress
  combinations in Arabidopsis. The models suggest the tailored response of Arabidopsis
  to (A) drought and heat combination, (B) drought and UV-B combination, and (C) osmotic
  and cold combination. The models were generated based on the researches using Arabidopsis
  subjected to different stress combinations. A model of the signaling pathway under
  the drought and UV-B combination was also suggested in a recent review based the
  researches using different plant species. ABA; abscisic acid, AUX; auxin, BR; brassinosteroid,
  ET; ethylene, JA; jasmonic acid, SA; salicylic acid.
