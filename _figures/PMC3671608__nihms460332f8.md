caption: (A). When normal cells are stimulated by growth factors, p110α is brought
  to cell membrane through binding of p85 to phospho-IRS1, whereby converting PIP2
  to PIP3.(B). In cancer cells harboring a p110α helical domain mutation, the p110α
  mutant directly binds to IRS1, thereby being recruited to cell membrane and converting
  PIP2 to PIP3.
