caption: scRNA-seq Profiles Reveal Clinical-State Specific Features of the Tumor Cellular
  EcosystemFeatures common to all time points are shown in the top-left quadrant and
  include the presence of multiple oncogenic drivers (1). Features shared in RD and
  PD are shown in the top-right quadrant and include various invasive signaling pathways
  (2). Features unique at RD, shown in the bottom-right quadrant, include the Alveolar
  signature (3) and increased T cell fraction (4). Features unique to PD, shown in
  the bottom-left quadrant, include upregulation of the plasminogen activation pathway
  (5), expression of gap-junction proteins (6), loss of tumor suppressor genes (7),
  expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines (8), increased Treg population (9), and
  increased kynurenine signature expression (10).
