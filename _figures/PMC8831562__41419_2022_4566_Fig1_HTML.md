caption: During the ubiquitination process, the cysteine group of the ubiquitin-activating
  enzyme (E1) conjugates the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin to initiate ubiquitination
  with assumption of an ATP. Subsequently, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) binds
  to E1 and activated ubiquitin complex, catalysing the ubiquitin transfer from E1
  to the active site of E2 through transesterification reaction. Then the ubiquitin-protein
  ligase (E3) establishes an isopeptide bond with C-terminal glycine on ubiquitin
  and lysine on substrate to form a ubiquitin-substrate complex. Ubiquitin can be
  conjugated by another ubiquitin to form a polyubiquitin chain via seven Lys residues
  (Lys6, 11, 27, 29, 33, 48 and 63) or Met1 by E1/E2/E3 recruitment. Once marked by
  a ubiquitin chain especially Lys48-linked chain, substrate tends to be degraded
  by proteasome. However, this process can be reversed by DUBs including multiple
  USPs. For example, CYLD can deubiquitinates Met1- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin
  chains for signalling []; USP30, the only human USP that inserted in the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, deubiquitinates Lys6-linked di-ubiquitin for mitophagy []; USP8 deubiquitinates
  Lys11 for autophagy regulation []; USP19 deubiquitinates Lys27-linked polyubiquitination
  for innate immune responses []; USP9X is implicated to deubiquitinate Lys29-linked
  polyubiquitination []; USP16 deubiquitinates Lys33-linked polyubiquitination for
  signalling []; USP7 deubiquitinates Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains for suppression
  of proteasomal degradation []. With specific USP domain, USPs can recognized the
  ubiquitin and catalyse the cleavage of polyubiquitin chains in the proximal, middle
  or distal linkage.
