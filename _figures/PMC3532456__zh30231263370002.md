caption: Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway. TGF-β is a pleiotropic
  cytokine that mediates fibrosis by inducing fibrogenic target genes. TGF-β is generally
  secreted as part of a large latent complex bound to latency-associated protein (LAP)
  and latent-TGF-β-binding protein (LTBP). Latent TGF-β is activated when it dissociates
  from LAP and LTBP. The active TGF-β binds its receptor to initiate Smad-dependent
  and independent signaling. Smad-dependent signaling regulates fibrogenic target
  genes such as α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), collagen, connective tissue growth factor
  (CTGF), tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP-1), and periostin. TGF-β can also
  induce a number of Smad-independent pathways such as Ras, TGF-β-activated kinase
  (TAK), RhoA, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), thereby adding to its pleiotropic
  effects. *Protein has been linked to EoE.
