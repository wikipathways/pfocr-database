caption: The complement system integrates distinct stimuli into a unified immunological
  response. The three pathways of complement activation, Classical (blue), Lectin
  (yellow), and Alternative (green), are activated by distinct perturbations to organism
  homeostasis such as antibody-based recognition of antigens or danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs), to drive a cascade of enzymatic activity merging in
  the terminal pathway (red). The cumulative result is the production of membrane-bound
  fragments (e.g., C3b and C5b) and soluble factors (e.g., C3a and C5a) that activate
  signaling through surface receptors (purple) that are highly expressed on immune
  and glial cells, and to a lesser extent, on neurons. Uncontrolled activation of
  the terminal pathway also promotes assembly of the cell-lysing terminal pathway
  complete complex (TPCC), also known as the membrane attack complex (MAC), which
  is regulated by multiple steric inhibitors and proteases (gray). This system controls
  the formation of complement products, their activity once formed and proteolytic
  degradation. A key component of the system is the amplification loop within the
  alternative pathway, which provides a positive feedback loop to ensure maximal activation
  of complement when appropriately triggered. However, this loop can also exacerbate
  complement-induced pathology under the conditions when complement inhibitors are
  dysregulated. Linked pain states are highlighted in red square brackets and include
  postsurgical pain, pain associated with peripheral nerve injury (PNI), complex regional
  pain syndrome (CRPS), and arthritic pain, as well as pain associated with paroxysmal
  nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), hereditary angioedema (HAE), ankylosing spondylitis
  (AS), and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). In this context, CIPN
  also includes a painful condition associated with the use of anti-ganglioside-GD2
  antibody for treating neuroblastoma cancer (, , ).
