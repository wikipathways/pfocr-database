caption: (A) Proposed model of organization of small airways. In lung epithelium,
  independent groups of cells simultaneously secrete and absorb to maintain fluid
  homeostasis. Under normal conditions, cells located in the pleats secrete fluid
  (blue) and cells located around the folds concurrently absorb secreted fluid (red).
  In lung injury, fluid transport in absorptive areas may be blocked while fluid secretion
  stays intact or increases. (B) Simplified, hypothetical concept of differential
  cytokine-dependent regulation of ion transporter in absorptive (red) and secretory
  (blue) areas in inflammatory lung disease. In apsorptive areas, AFC is impaired
  presumably through cytokine-mediated inhibition of CFTR and epithelial Na+ channel
  (ENaC). Proinflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), transforming
  growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin1β (IL-1β)] bind to their receptor inducing
  intracellular signaling cascades of MAP-kinases, JNK, p38, which prevent expression
  of ENaC. IL-8 blocks CFTR expression and activation by inhibition of cAMP/PKA pathway.
  In secretory areas, fluid secretion is stimulated by cytokines. Receptor binding
  of IL-1β, TNF-α, and TGF-β induces intracellular signaling pathways leading to activation
  and expression of CFTR and NKCC1.
