caption: The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is regulated by an interactive
  network of pathways that dictate its functional outcome. Persistent DNA damage can
  be responsible for activation of the SASP by a mechanism that is independent of
  cell cycle regulation. Also, the SASP can be induced via pathways separate from
  the DNA damage response (DDR) such as activation of p38MAPK or mTOR which, in turn,
  enhance transcriptional activity of NF-кB. Increased transcription of SASP genes
  is predominantly regulated by the transcription factors NF-кB and C/EBPβ. The composition
  of the SASP is regulated by genotoxic stress pathways, mainly the p53 tumor suppressor
  pathway. p53 attenuates the SASP through regulation of NF-кB function but can also
  directly influence the transcription of SASP genes qualitatively, facilitating immune
  clearance of senescent cells. NOTCH1 signaling modulates the secretome of senescent
  cells by inhibiting C/EBPβ, thus suppressing pro-inflammatory secretion in favor
  of a TGF-β-rich composition. This switch prevents recruitment of the immune cells
  to the tumor site. Components of the SASP act as signaling molecules in both paracrine
  and autocrine fashion and are capable of stimulating complex and sometimes conflicting
  pathways including senescence maintenance or escape, immune system activation or
  suppression, induction of tumorigenesis or tumor suppression in neighboring cells.
