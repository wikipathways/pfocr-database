caption: Autophagosomes are generated as phagophores and undergo elongation before
  ultimately fusing with lysosomes for degradation. Along with this process, mitochondria
  are recognized with the help from a variety of mitophagy-related proteins. The PINK1/PARK2
  pathway senses the depolarization of mitochondria. The accumulation of PINK1 and
  PARK2 on the mitochondrial outer membrane amplifies the mitophagy signaling by generating
  phosphorylated ubiquitin, which links the autophagosomal machinery, e.g., P62 and
  LC3 to engulf the target mitochondria. Alternatively, a variety of mitophagy receptors,
  including BNIP3L, BNIP3, FUNDC1, PHB2, and cardiolipin, sense distinct extra-/intracellular
  signaling to recruit autophagosomes by directly binding with Atg8s, like LC3, via
  their LC3 interacting region (LIR) motif. These pathways ensure the superfluous
  and/or damaged mitochondria can be eliminated by lysosomes, and thus control the
  mitochondrial quality.
