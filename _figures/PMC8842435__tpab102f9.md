caption: Proposed key mechanisms of Methylorubrum extorquens DSM13060 in affecting
  hormonal signaling of Scots pine and subsequent gene networks. (A) the bacterium
  induces host CUL1, potentially through phospholipase A2 enzymes or neddylation,
  which activates auxin signaling by submitting the AUX/IAA repressor to the ubiquitin
  degradation pathway. (B) Bacterial induction of HYL1 can affect auxin, abscisic
  acid (ABA) and cytokinin signaling via miRNA and siRNA processing. (C) Developmental
  genes behind flowering, root hair and lateral root formation are repressed, whereas
  genes for shoot and root growth are induced in pine seedlings. Biosynthesis genes
  of flavones are induced, and anthocyanin synthesis genes are repressed. Decreased
  expression of genes involved in senescence and cell death occurs in colonized seedlings
  potentially due to production of methyl-esterified 3-hydroxybutyrate oligomers ()
  and ononitol. ALE2 = abnormal leaf shape 2, ARF = auxin-responsive factor, ASK = apoptosis
  signal-regulating Kinase-1, AUX/IAA = auxin/indole acetic acid, COW1 = phosphatidylinositol
  transporter, CRSP = CO2response secreted protease, CUL1 = Cullin-1, DCL = dicer-like
  1, Pri-miRNA = primary transcript micro-RNA, RBX = RING H2-type domain, RUB = related
  to ubiquitin, SE = serrate protein, Ub = ubiquitin.
