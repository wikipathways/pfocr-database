caption: Schematic presentation of the signaling pathway induced by HCV for metabolic
  regulation. Based on our previous and current observations, we propose that HCV
  may interrupt at different nodes of the metabolic signaling pathway for insulin
  resistance and lipid metabolism. Core protein activates JNK and upregulates IRS
  Ser312 phosphorylation, thus inhibiting glucose uptake (). On the other hand, core
  protein inhibits phospho-FoxO1 and 14-3-3 protein interaction and thus may impair
  FoxO1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, or activated JNK may have
  a role in the regulation of FoxO1 phosphorylation (). This leads to upregulation
  of G6P in the nucleus and enables an increase in glucose synthesis. HCV inactivates
  FoxA2 by increasing cytoplasmic translocation, leading to lower levels of MTP activity
  and ApoB secretion. Bold arrow pointing upward (↑) represent activation, downward-pointing
  arrows (↓) represent repression, and blunt arrows (⊥) represent blockade of signaling.
