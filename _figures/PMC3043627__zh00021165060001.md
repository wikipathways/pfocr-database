caption: Simplified model for the intersection of signaling pathways regulating protein
  synthesis and degradation. Arrows indicate activating events, whereas perpendicular
  lines indicate inhibitory events. The solid lines represent direct activation. The
  dashed lines represent indirect activation, whereby intermediate steps are involved
  but are not specified in this schematic. Protein synthesis is regulated by protein
  kinase B (Akt), p44/42 MAPK (ERK½), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading
  to activation of the downstream targets mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), glycogen
  synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), MAPK-interacting kinases ½ (MNK½), p70S6 kinase (p70S6K),
  eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), and eukaryotic initiation factors 2B and 4E (eIF2B
  and eIF4E). Conversely, Akt is responsible for the phosphorylation status of forkhead
  box protein (FoxO). If FoxO is phosphorylated by Akt, it leaves the nucleus and
  becomes inactive, thus preventing protein degradation. If Akt activity is suppressed,
  FoxO becomes dephosphorylated, translocates to the nucleus, and exerts its transcriptional
  effects on atrogenes to induce protein degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome
  pathway. PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase.
