caption: Analysis of DEGs involved in the starch and sucrose metabolic pathway in
  ZM22, BN207 and BN607. a, Pattern diagram of the starch and sucrose metabolic pathway.
  The red squares indicate upregulated genes, the green squares indicate downregulated
  genes, and the orange squares indicate both upregulated and downregulated genes.
  b, The expression difference levels of DEGs involved in the starch and sucrose metabolic
  pathway between waterlogging treatment and control treatment in three varieties.
  The metabolism of each previously selected DEGs was analysed using a heatmap. Relative
  expression level of DEGs was measured by log2 ratio (Fold change between waterlogging
  treatment and control treatment each variety). Positive fold change values (red)
  indicate the up-regulation, whereas negative fold change values (blue)
papertitle: Transcriptomic and anatomic profiling reveal the germination process of
  different wheat varieties in response to waterlogging stress.
