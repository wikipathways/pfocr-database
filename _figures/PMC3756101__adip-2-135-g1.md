caption: Figure 1.  Insulin-stimulated PI3K signaling in adipocyte and endothelial
  cells. Insulin binding to the insulin receptor (IR) leads to auto-phosphorylation
  at tyrosine residues and subsequent recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of
  insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. IRS acts as a docking protein for PI3K
  and binding by regulatory subunit relieves kinase inhibition and brings the enzyme
  in close proximity to the phospholipid membrane. PI3K phosphorylates the 3′ site
  on the inositol ring forming phosphoinosital (3, 4, 5) phosphate (PIP3), which attracts
  lipid binding proteins, PDK1 and Akt. In adipocytes, activation of Akt is essential
  for glucose clearance by enhancing signals necessary for GLUT4 translocation to
  the plasma membrane and for suppression of lipolysis through phosphorylation and
  activation of phosphodiesterase 3b (PDE3b). Activation of PDE3b leads to inhibition
  of protein kinase A (PKA) and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) by depleting cyclic
  AMP (cAMP). In vascular endothelial cells, activation of Akt by PI3K promotes angiogenesis
  and nitric oxide (NO) production for vascular tone. Akt also represses the expression
  of adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte rolling and adhesion to the vascular
  luminal wall.
