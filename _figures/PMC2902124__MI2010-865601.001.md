caption: 'TLR signalling. Ligand recognition results in the recruitment of intracellular
  TIR-domain-containing adaptors proteins, including myeloid-differentiation primary-response
  protein 88 (MyD88, shared by all TLRs, except TLR3), and Toll/IL-1R domain-containing
  adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF, employed by TLR3 and TLR4). Engagement of MyD88 activates
  a signaling cascade including IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs,), (TNF)-receptor-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-activated kinase (TAK1),
  leading to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK, JNK,
  and p38, and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) (MyD88-dependent pathway). There is a second, alternative pathway triggered
  by TRIF (MyD88-independent pathway) that culminates in the activation of NF-κB,
  MAPKs, and the transcription factors interferon-responsive factors (IRFs), whose
  are responsible for induction of type I IFNs, in particular IFNβ. Besides MyD88
  and TRIF, two other adaptor proteins have been described: TIR-domain-containing
  adaptor protein (TIRAP, also called MAL), and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM,
  required for TRIF-dependent signaling through TLR4, but not TLR3).'
