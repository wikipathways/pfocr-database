caption: Hypothetical metabolic map in U. prolifera under lowdose and shortterm UV-B.
  Enhanced photorespiration, phenolic compounds metabolism, and the AsA−GSH cycle
  may contribute to explain the balancing damage mechanism in U. prolifera under UVBR
  stress. The red line represents the enhancement of a metabolic pathway. The blue
  line indicates that the metabolic pathway is inhibited. Black line, no supporting
  data on metabolic pathways. Enzymes are represented by italic letters.
