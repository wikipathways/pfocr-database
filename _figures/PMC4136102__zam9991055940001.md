caption: 'Glucose, fructose, and benzoate metabolism in P. putida KT2440 through the
  Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, and the
  β-ketoadipate pathway. Glucose transport into the cytoplasm is mediated through
  an ABC uptake system and phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and further
  to 6-phosphogluconate (6PG). Alternatively, glucose diffuses into the periplasm
  and is converted into gluconate and 2-ketogluconate (). These intermediates are
  transported to the cytoplasm and are subsequently phosphorylated and reduced to
  6-phosphogluconate, which is further metabolized by Entner-Doudoroff pathway enzymes
  or the pentose phosphate pathway enzymes. Fructose is transported into the cytoplasm
  by a PTS permease system and converted first to fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) and then
  to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). FBP can then follow a reverse/anabolic EMP route
  and then enter the ED pathway or be processed by the standard glycolytic EMP route.
  Benzoate uptake into the cytoplasm is mediated by a permease () and is then processed
  by the β-ketoadipate pathway enzymes, resulting in the central intermediates acetyl
  coenzyme A (AcCoA) and succinate (SUCC). The metabolic intermediates involved in
  the corresponding pathways are abbreviated as follows: F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  R5P, ribulose-5-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; PYR, pyruvate.'
