caption: Signaling pathways in the embryonic mammary gland. Cartoon depicting major
  signaling pathways that are critical during embryonic mammary gland development.
  (A) Hedgehog signaling. Although Hh ligands are expressed in the MRs, Hedgehog signaling
  is in the inactivated state. GLI is maintained in the repressor form to repress
  the transcription of Hh target genes. (B) FGF signaling. FGF10 binding to its main
  receptor, FGFR2B triggers receptor dimerization, phosphorylation and the activation
  of diverse downstream pathways. (C) IGF1R signaling. Ligand binding activates the
  receptor kinase, leading to receptor autophosphorylation, and tyrosine phosphorylation
  of multiple signaling adapter proteins including, the insulin receptor substrates
  (IRS1/2). (D) PTHRP signaling. PTHRP binding to the G-coupled receptor PTHR1 activates
  AC and PLC downstream signaling. (E) BMP signaling. Binding of ligand to the receptor
  complex stimulates BMPR autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of downstream substrates.
  BMP4 may interact with PTHRP signaling to facilitate epithelial-mesenchymal cross
  talk. (F) EDA-EDAR signaling. EDA binding to EDAR triggers downstream NF-kB signaling.
  (G) NRG3-ERBB4 signaling. NRG binding triggers receptor dimerization and activation
  of receptor tyrosine kinase domain and downstream signaling. (H) NOTCH signaling.
  Ligand binding triggers the cleavage of N1ICD which activates downstream signaling.
  (I) Hormone signaling. Binding of hormones such as estrogen or progesterone to their
  cognate hormone receptor (HR) promotes internalization of the hormone-receptor complex.
  Homo- or heterodimer formation ensues followed by translocation into the nucleus
  and binding to DNA response elements and transcription or repression of target genes.
  Only relevant components of each signaling pathway in embryonic mammary gland development
  are depicted. Genes highlighted in red denote genes that give rise to aberrant embryonic
  mammary gland phenotypes when deleted or overexpressed. P denotes phosphorylation
  events. Figure created with BioRender.
