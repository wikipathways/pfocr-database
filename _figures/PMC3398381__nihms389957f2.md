caption: Figure 2 A illustrated the interaction of the genomic and acute estrogen
  signaling pathways in regulating nitric oxide (NO) signaling. Estrogen (E2) can
  bind to ER resulting in dimerization and activation of gene transcription. Nitric
  oxide synthase (NOS) expression has been reported to be regulated by E2 and females
  have been shown to have higher levels of NOS than males. In addition, E2 active
  via rapid signaling pathways can activate the PI3K pathway regulating in phosphorylation
  and activation of NOS.Figure 2B illustrates how this signaling might be altered
  with aging and disease and provides a possible explanation as to why HRT failed
  to protect in post-menopausal women. Tetrahydropterin (BH4) is a cofactor for NOS
  and in the absence of BH4, NOS now generates ROS rather than NO.
