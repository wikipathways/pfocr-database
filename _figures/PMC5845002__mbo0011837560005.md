caption: Impact of kinase inhibition on metabolic pathways. (A) Intermediates of TCA
  and methylcitrate cycles. (B) Intermediates of lysine biosynthesis. Relative metabolite
  abundances (based on ion intensities) in the presence of equimolar concentrations
  of either the kinase inhibitor or the inactive control are indicated in heat map
  format below or adjacent to each pathway intermediate detected in the metabolomics
  analysis; the 4 blocks indicate the durations of compound treatment (0, 12, 24,
  and 48 h), and color intensities correspond to Log2-fold difference relative to
  time 0 h; P = <0.05. Genes with a Log2FC value of >0.5 or ≤0.5 in the RNA-Seq results
  are represented with an arrow next to the gene, with red arrows pointing up to signify
  increased expression and green arrows pointing down to signify decreased expression.
  Primary data are shown in  (transcriptomics) and  (metabolomics).
