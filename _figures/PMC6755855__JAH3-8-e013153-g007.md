caption: Schematic illustration highlighting the effect of the sphingolipid pathway
  on the mediator of flow‐induced dilation (FID). Shear stress from increased blood
  flow results in the formation and release of nitric oxide (NO) or hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2) in adults without coronary artery disease (CAD) versus those with CAD, respectively.
  Inhibition of neutral ceramidase (NCdase) favors ceramide accumulation favoring
  FID mediated by H2O2. Likewise, preventing formation of intracellular sphingosine‐1‐phosphate
  (S1P) through inhibition of sphingosine kinase (SpK) also results in H2O2‐dependent
  dilation in vessels from patients without CAD. Overexpression of NCdase, exogenous
  S1P, or adiponectin, or activation of adiponectin receptors, restores NO‐dependent
  dilation in arterioles from patients with CAD. Adiponectin, or the nonselective
  adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1/R2) agonist AdipoRon, is capable of either
  activating NCdase or has intrinsic ceramidase activity allowing for the hydrolysis
  of ceramide.
