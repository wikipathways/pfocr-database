caption: 'Role of ceramidases in ceramide metabolism. Ceramide in mammalian cells
  may be generated: (1) via the de novo synthesis pathway, which begins with the condensation
  of L-serine and Palmitoyl-CoA); (2) by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide;
  or (3) from the dephosphorylation of ceramide-1-phosphate. Ceramidase is an enzyme
  that cleaves fatty acids from ceramide, producing sphingosine. Sphingosine may then
  be phosphorylated by a sphingosine kinase to form sphingosine-1-phosphate. SMase—sphingomyelinase;
  GCS—glucosylceramide synthase.'
