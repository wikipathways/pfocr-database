caption: Model of NFAT/AP-1 complex regulation by Ras family GTPases in mast cells.
  Ras and Rac-1 are required for transcriptional activity of the NFAT/AP-1 complex.
  Ras signals do not regulate the subcellular localization of NFAT protein. Rac-1
  regulates NFAT phosphorylation status and, hence, nuclear import. The effect of
  dominant inhibition of Ras upon NFAT/AP-1 transcriptional activity can be rescued
  by activated Rac-1, indicating that there is a Ras-dependent Rac-1 signaling pathway
  acting upon the NFAT/AP-1 complex in addition to the Ras-independent effect of Rac-1
  upon NFAT subcellular localization. This latter pathway is postulated to target
  the AP-1 binding partner of NFAT.
