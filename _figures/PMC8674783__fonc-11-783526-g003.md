caption: NBR2 functions as a tumor suppressor. NBR2 is responsible for the glucose
  metabolism in cancer dependent on the AMPK–mTOR pathway. Glucose starvation in TME
  induces the expression of NBR2 depending on the LKB1–AMPK pathway. As feedback,
  stress-induced NBR2 enhances the activity of AMPK kinase by directly interacting
  with its AMPKα subunit, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. Based
  on its regulation of the AMPK–mTOR pathway, curcumin-induced NBR2 enhances the antitumor
  effects of curcumin by suppressing cancer proliferation and clone formation. In
  addition, NBR2 attenuates EMT by blocking the NOTCH1 pathway and inhibiting miR-21
  expression. Moreover, NBR2 impedes Beclin1-induced cytoprotective autophagy, thereby
  inhibiting cancer proliferation through ERK and JNK pathways.
