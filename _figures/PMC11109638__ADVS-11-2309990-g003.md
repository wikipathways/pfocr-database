caption: Accumulation of diverse BIAs and the proposed BIA biosynthetic pathway in
  M. dauricum. The shaded regions indicate the different BIA structural types, including
  bisBIAs, protoberberines, aporphines, sinomenines, and acutumines. The mean values
  of five replicates (n = 5 biologically independent samples) were used to calculate
  the relative proportions of BIAs accumulated in roots and aboveground tissues, indicated
  as yellow and green circles, respectively. Raw data were sourced from Data S2. RH
  (root hair), R (root), S (stem), L (leaf), YL (young leaf), and YS (young stem).
