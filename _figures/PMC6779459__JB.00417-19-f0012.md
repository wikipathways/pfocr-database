caption: Regulatory map of msaABCR (MsaB), sigB, and sarZ in the oxidative stress
  defense system. MsaB positively activates transcription of the STX biosynthetic
  operon crtOPQMN and ohr gene. In addition, MsaB also activates the expression of
  sigB, which is a positive transcriptional regulator of crtOPQMN expression, and
  the regulation of the two genes appears to be mutually epistatic. On the other hand,
  MsaB represses sarZ, which in turn also represses the ohr gene. The oxidative sensing
  pathway by MsaB and the coordinated expression of genes remain to be elucidated.
  At this time, although we do not know whether SigB and SarZ directly regulate MsaB,
  the increased transcription of msaB in the sarZ and sigB mutants indicates the possibility
  of interplay between these regulators and MsaB.
