caption: Overview on the mechanisms of glutathione induced cell death. Apoptosis includes
  cellular shrinking, chromatin condensation and margination at the nuclear periphery
  with the eventual formation of membrane-bound apoptotic bodies that contain organelles,
  cytosol and nuclear fragments and are phagocytosed without triggering inflammatory
  processes. Depletion of GSH might be a prerequisite for the generation of ROS. GSH
  depletion and the concomitant decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio might increase the availability
  of GSSG to exert its redox signaling and modulate both intrinsic as well as extrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis. GSH depletion triggers the permeability transition pore of
  the mitochondria, the pro-apoptotic function of released Cyt C, the formation of
  the apoptosome, and the activation of executioner caspases and lead to intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, GSH depletion might trigger aggregation of death
  receptors, activation of Fas/FasL and caspase-3.
