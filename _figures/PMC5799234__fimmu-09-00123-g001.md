caption: C-type lectin receptor (CLR) signaling in fungal recognition. Schematic representation
  of the transmembrane CLRs associated with antifungal immunity and their intracellular-signaling
  networks. The recognition of fungal components by several CLRs, including Dectin-1,
  Dectin-2, Dectin-3, macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle), and dendritic cell-specific
  ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), induces downstream signaling via Syk-dependent
  and Raf-1-dependent pathways to mediate antifungal immunity. Dectin-1 homodimers,
  Dectin-2-Dectin-3 heterodimers, and Mincle-Dectin-3 heterodimers couple with immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like and FcR-γ-associated ITAM motifs, respectively,
  to recruit Syk to initiate downstream signaling, which leads to reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production and caspase activation and recruitment domain-containing
  protein 9 (CARD9)/Bcl-10/MALT1 complex-mediated activation of NF-κB pathway. ROS
  triggers NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation, which cleave pro-IL-1β and
  pro-IL-18 into mature forms to elicit protective roles in anti-fungi immunity. Dectin-1-signaling
  pathway also induces Syk-dependent activation of Ras-GRF1, which recruits H-Ras
  via the CARD9 adaptor and ultimately leads to extracellular signal-regulated protein
  kinase (ERK) activation. Furthermore, signaling by Syk results in nuclear factor
  of activated T cells (NF-AT) activation in a calcineurin-dependent fashion, which
  integrates with NF-κB signaling to regulate gene transcription. Moreover, Dectin-1-signaling
  activation seems to be essential for the formation of noncanonical caspase-8 inflammasome,
  which is responsible for active IL-1β production.
