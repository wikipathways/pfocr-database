caption: Illustration of bone marrow niche, normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. (A)
  Schematic representation of the bone marrow (BM) niche summarizing key cell types
  and functional features. HSCs reside in the proximity of BM vessels (arterioles
  or sinusoids). Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) populations include, among others, NG2
  +, LEPR + and CAR cells and promote HSCs maintenance by releasing important factors
  (i.e., CXCL12, SCF). Endothelial cells (ECs) (arteriolar endothelial cells (AECs),
  surrounding the arterioles and sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), surrounding
  the sinusoids) also release important factors for HCSs maintenance. Sympathetic
  nerve fibers regulate HSCs migration through the sinusoids. MSC subpopulations,
  ECs, non-myelinating Schwann cells (NMSCs) and HSC progeny (i.e., megakaryocytes)
  contribute to the regulation of HSC homeostasis or regenerative hematopoiesis. Megakaryocytes
  produce CXCL4 to regulate HSCs. (B) Schematic representation of normal hematopoiesis.
  HSCs reside at the top of the hierarchy. Differentiation is considered today more
  of a continuum, than a step-by-step procedure, represented by the dashed arrow on
  the left. The HSC pool is heterogeneous in terms of self-renewal and differentiation
  properties. Self-renewal of HSCs is denoted by an arrow around the cells (solid
  arrow represents strong and dashed arrow weaker self-renewal potential). Hematopoietic
  Stem and Progenitor cells (HSPCs) pool contains long-term self-renewing HSCs (LT-HSCs),
  short-term self-renewing HSCs (ST-HSCs) and non-self-renewing multipotent progenitors
  (MPPs). Throughout differentiation, HSCs might first lose self-renewal capacity
  and then lineage potential as they commit to evolving to a mature functional cell
  of a specific lineage. MPPs, might have unilineage, bi- or trilineage potential.
  MPPs advance to oligopotent progenitors (OPPs), including the lymphoid-primed multipotent
  progenitors (LMPPs), the common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and the common myeloid
  progenitors (CMPs). The myeloid and lymphoid compartments remain associated in the
  hierarchy via the lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPP). CMPs give rise
  to megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors
  (GMPs). LMPPs give rise to give GMPs and CLPs. The OPPs through the lineage-restricted
  progenitors give rise to the mature effector cells (B-cells, T-cells and NK-cells,
  dendritic cells, granulocytes, macrophages, platelets, and erythrocytes). (C) Schematic
  representation of leukemic hematopoiesis. Aging, mutations, disease, inflammation,
  niche dysfunction/alterations and clonal hematopoiesis can lead to the generation
  of a leukemic stem cell (LSC). LSC can differentiate into the hematopoietic lineage
  carrying the mutation/s or remain as immature progenitor cells, called blast cells.
  Not all intermediate cell stages are depicted and cells are not in scale. Main differentiation
  points where the JAK-STAT pathway, JAKs and STATs exert their roles are shown.
