caption: Schematic of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling. Canonical Wnt signaling
  is activated upon Wnt ligand binding to FZD Wnt receptors and Wnt co-receptors such
  as LRP5/6, causing the recruitment of DVL to the plasma membrane. This causes the
  destruction complex (AXIN1/2, APC, GSK3β, CK1α) to dissociate, allowing the stabilization
  and accumulation of unphosphorylated β-catenin in the cytoplasm. β-catenin can then
  translocate to the nucleus where it associates with TCF/LEF, CBP/p300, PYGO1/2,
  and BCL9 to regulate the expression of Wnt target genes. Negative regulation of
  the canonical Wnt pathway can occur via multiple mechanisms, including extracellular
  sFRPs preventing FZD-Wnt binding and DKK-mediated inhibition of LRP5/6. Wnt ligand
  activation of the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway involves signal transduction via
  a complex of FZD Wnt receptors and Wnt co-receptors (e.g., ROR, RYK, and VANGL1/2),
  leading to plasma membrane recruitment and activation of DVL and CK1δ/ε-mediated
  phosphorylation of VANGL2. DVL binds to the small GTPase; Rac1, RhoA to activate
  ROCK and JNK. This can lead to ROCK-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements or JNK
  regulation of target genes via phosphorylation of transcription factors such as
  c-JUN, which can associate with proteins such as activation of transcriptional factor
  2 (ATF2). The Wnt/Ca2+pathway activation leads to increased PLC activity, stimulating
  the production of DAG that activates PKC, and IP3 that triggers intracellular release
  of Ca2+ ions. This results in downstream signaling events such as cell cytoskeletal
  rearrangements and calcineurin-mediated transcriptional responses via transcription
  factors such as NFAT or NF-κB.
