caption: The relationship between statins and ferroptosis. Iron overload, lipid reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and lipid peroxidation are prerequisites for
  the activation of cell death by ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is governed by three antioxidant
  axes, i.e., the GSH/GPX4, FSP1/CoQ10/NAD(P)H and GCH1/BH4 axes. The FSP1/CoQ10/NAD(P)H
  axis relies on the mevalonate pathway to generate CoQ10. IPP, the precursor of CoQ10,
  is also a limiting substrate for enzymatic isopentenylation of Sec-tRNA, thereby
  influencing the expression of GPX4. Statins regulate the GSH/GPX4 and FSP1/CoQ10/NAD(P)H
  axes via the mevalonate pathway, thereby inducing cell death by ferroptosis
