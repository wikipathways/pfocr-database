caption: Metabolic reconstruction of the branched amino acid degradation pathway in
  the peroxisome and proposed interactions with the mitochondria. The log2 FC acetate/butyrate
  is indicated by the color codes. Further information can be found in . Arrows in
  grey represent less likely or hypothetical pathways, pathways that are proposed
  use black arrows. ACSF exhibits an FC value with p > 0.004. ALD color gradient indicates
  different isoforms with FC values between 0 and 6.
