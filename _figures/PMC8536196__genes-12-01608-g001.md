caption: Representative image of HPA axis and the stress pathway genes implicated
  in suicide behavior. Upon perception of stress, CRH is released from the hypothalamus,
  which promotes the synthesis and release of ACTH from the pituitary. ACTH, in turn,
  increases the release of cortisol from the adrenal glands. Through negative feedback,
  cortisol inhibits the hormone release from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary
  glands. Inside the cell, cortisol causes the activation of molecular mechanisms
  that regulate the impact of the HPA axis.
