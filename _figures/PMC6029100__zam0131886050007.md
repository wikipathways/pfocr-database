caption: Metabolic pathways of ADD and 9-OHAD synthesis. (a) Metabolic pathway to
  produce ADD; (b) metabolic pathway to produce 9-OHAD; (c) description of the strains
  that were established in this study. ADD and 9-OHAD are denoted in red. The key
  steps catalyzed by Kshs, KstDs, and Hsd4A were labeled by red, purple, and blue
  arrows, respectively. The symbol X represents the block of the metabolic pathway,
  and the thick red arrows, purple arrows, and the blue arrow represent the overexpression
  of Ksh, KstDs, and Hsd4A in the metabolic pathway. The successive thick arrows represent
  certain unspecified enzymes.
