caption: 'In cancer cells, increased uptake of [1-13C]glucose through the glucose
  transporter Glut-1 is detected by analyzing extracellular levels of [1-13C]glucose
  in media. Increased activity of glycolysis is calculated by the amount of intracellular
  [3-13C]lactate in the cellular fraction, as well as the amount of lactate exported
  into media through the MCT4. Decreased mitochondrial activity is detected by low
  levels of 13C-enrichment into [4-13C]glutamate (through pyruvate dehydrogenase)
  and [2,3-13C]glutamate (through pyruvate carboxylase). Finally, exported acetyl-CoA
  (from the truncated tricarboxylic acid cycle) into the cytosol is used for increased
  13C-fatty-acid synthesis. 13C-fluxes through the pentose phosphate pathway can be
  detected by alternative methods, such as gas or liquid chromatography.3P: Tri-phosphate;
  ACL: ATP citrate lyase; FAS: Fatty acid synthase; LDH: Lactate dehydrogenase; M2-PK:
  M2 pyruvate kinase; MCT: Monocarboxylate transporter; OXPHOS: Oxidative phosphorylation;
  PFK: Phosphofructokinase.Adapted from [].'
