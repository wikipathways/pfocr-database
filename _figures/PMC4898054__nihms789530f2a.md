caption: A). In T cells, antigen-dependent activation of the T cell Receptor (TCR)
  signals through the PI3K pathway to stimulate increased translation of HIF-α mRNA.
  Additionally, inflammatory cytokines signal through the JAK/STAT3 pathway to increase
  transcription of HIF-α mRNA. These pathways are essential for induction of HIF-signaling
  in hypoxia and during T cell activation. In myeloid cells, toll-like receptor (TLR)
  signaling increases NF-κB-dependent transcription of HIF-α mRNA in response to a
  variety of stimuli including bacterial infection leading to increased HIF-signaling.B).
  The hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by PHDs utilizes α-ketoglutarate as a co-substrate,
  producing succinate in the process. Loss of function mutations to succinate dehydrogenase
  (SDH) and fumarate hydratase (FH) result in accumulation of succinate, which inhibits
  PHD activity and stabilizes HIF-α in normoxia. The enzymes labelled in red (SDH,
  FH, and IDH) are frequently mutated in a variety of malignancies resulting in inhibition
  of PHD activity and stabilization of HIF-α subunits. Increased concentrations of
  lactate and pyruvate have also been demonstrated to promote stabilization of HIF-α,
  but the mechanism by which this stabilization occurs remains unclear.
