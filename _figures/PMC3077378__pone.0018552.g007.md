caption: Ganetespib exerts potent antitumor effects through perturbation of multiple
  signaling cascades, including the JAK/STAT signaling axis and cell cycle mediators.
  (A) The JAK/STAT pathway is a principal signaling mechanism for a wide array of
  cytokines and growth factors. Hyperactivation of this pathway, through ligand activated
  receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR or FLT3), cytokine receptor mediated activation
  of JAK2, or activating mutations such as JAK2V617F, is often associated with oncogenesis.
  Regulation of the cell cycle involves a number of highly coordinated and essential
  processes, including checkpoint control and detection/repair of genetic damage,
  critical for correct progression and cell division. (B) Inactivation of Hsp90 by
  ganetespib results in the proteasome-mediated degradation of the upstream signaling
  components (indicated in grey) critical for STAT, MAPK and AKT activation, thereby
  resulting in growth inhibition. In addition, concomitant downregulation of key cell-cycle
  regulatory genes induced by ganetespib (as shown in ) results in cell cycle arrest
  in the G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and subsequent loss of S phase.
