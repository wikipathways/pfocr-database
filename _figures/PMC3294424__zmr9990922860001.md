caption: Virulence regulation of and interactions between the two AHL quorum-sensing
  systems in P. aeruginosa. After a threshold concentration of 3-oxo-C12-HSL is produced,
  the 3-oxo-C12-HSL–LasR complex binds the promoter regions of multiple genes, activating
  or repressing their transcription. Among the genes upregulated by this complex are
  lasI, which enhances the production of 3-oxo-C12-HSL (autoinduction effect), and
  rhlR, which increases the production of the rhl response regulator RhlR, activating
  the second AHL pathway at an earlier stage. Virulence factors regulated by each
  respective receptor-ligand complex are detailed on the left.
