caption: Fe-S cluster synthesis pathway and our working model for the life span extension
  and apoptotic events caused by depletion of abtm-1 in C. elegans. The diagram shows
  the ABC transporter ABTM-1/Atm1p and some of the enzymes (ferredoxin reductase,
  Y62E10A.6/Arh1p; ferredoxin, Y73F8A.27/Yahp) and scaffolding proteins (LPD-8/Nfu1p,
  B0205.6/Nfs1p, Y39B6A.3/Isa1p, and Y45F10D.4/Isu1p) involved in the synthesis of
  Fe-S clusters. These molecules are represented by the name of the protein in C.
  elegans (boldface), and the corresponding S. cerevisiae homologue. Defects in Fe-S
  cluster synthesis caused by abtm-1(RNAi), as indicated by the box surrounded by
  a dotted line, cause accumulation of iron, which in turn induces free radicals.
  The oxidative stress promoted by the free radicals is responsible for mitochondrial
  damage, which may lead to premature apoptosis and activation of DAF-16. Both the
  mitochondrial damage and DAF-16 activation may induce life span extension in individuals
  that survive embryogenesis. The life span extension induced by DAF-16 may be due
  to the expression of genes such as sod-3.
