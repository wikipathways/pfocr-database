caption: 'Pathways of potential therapeutic targets. Overexpression of the transcription
  factors: BRD4, FOXM1, and IRF-8 was observed in IL-1β induced chondrocytes. In studies
  of BRD4 and FOXM1, it has been suggested that the effect of IL-1β is regulated via
  the NF-kB signaling pathway, contrary to IRF-8. Matrix metalloproteinases genes
  are transcribed, translated and in the cytoplasm, pro-MMPs are synthesized. Then
  they are released into the ECM, converted into MMPs, and either participate in collagen
  degradation or are inhibited by TIMPs.NF-κB – nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells, P – phosphate, p65 – transcription factor p65.'
