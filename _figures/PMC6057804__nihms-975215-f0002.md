caption: 20-HETE is actively produced from PLA2-mediated formation of AA in proximal
  tubular cells and TALH cells by hormonal and stress stimulators downstream of PLC-mediated
  increases in intracellular Ca2+. 20-HETE may act intracellularly or via GPR75. In
  proximal tubular cells, 20-HETE promotes cellular proliferation by activation of
  PKC/MAPK mediated signaling pathway (1). 20-HETE also internalizes NHE3 via an undefined
  process (2) and inhibits activity of Na+-K+-ATPase by PKC-mediated phosphorylation
  (3), thereby diminishing sodium transport from the apical (luminal) to basolateral
  side of proximal tubule cells. In TALH cells, 20-HETE inhibits the apical NKCC2
  cotransporter (2) and basolateral Na+-K+-ATPase (3) to prevent sodium reabsorption
  from the renal tubular lumen into the basolateral space. 20-HETE also inhibits the
  70pS ROMK located on the apical side (1) and the 50pS ROMK located on the basolateral
  side (4), which normally contribute to NKCC2 cotransporter activity by allowing
  for K+ back-leak into tubular lumen and driving Cl− transcellular flux, respectively.
  All of the actions on proximal tubule cells and TALH cells by 20-HETE contribute
  to natriuresis and the prevention of water-sodium retention. NHE3, sodium-hydrogen
  antiporter 3; NKCC2, Na+-K+−2Cl− cotransporter; ROMK2, renal outer medullary potassium
  channel 2; PLA2, phospholipase A2; PLC, phospholipase C; PKC, protein kinase C;
  TALH, thick ascending loop of Henle. See text and Figure Legend 1 legend for additional
  details.
