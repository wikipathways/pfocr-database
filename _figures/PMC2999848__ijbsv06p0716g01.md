caption: Schematic diagram of the insulin signaling cascade that regulates GLUT4 exocytosis
  in the plasma membrane in adipose cells. Insulin stimulation results in tyrosine
  phosphorylation of IRS and activation of PI3K, which catalyzes the formation of
  PI(3,4,5)P3 from PI(4,5)P2, leading to the action of PDK1 and 2. The PDK's phosphorylate
  and activate AKT, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates AS160, a Rab GTPase-activating
  protein (GAP). AS160 negatively regulates GLUT4 translocation by converting the
  active GTP-bound form of Rab protein to the inactive GDP-bound form. This removes
  the inhibition of AS160 and permits GSV translocation to the plasma membrane for
  fusion. In the basal state, GLUT4 molecules are inserted into the plasma membrane
  primarily by fusion-with-retention in which GLUT4 molecules are retained at the
  site of fusion. Insulin modestly stimulates this fusion with retention, but markedly
  stimulates a second type of exocytosis, fusion-with-release, in which GLUT4 molecules
  are dispersed into the plasma membrane. In addition to the main PI3K pathway, the
  Rho-family GTPase TC10 pathway (not shown) has also been proposed to mediate insulin
  signaling in regulating GLUT4 translocation . AKT, protein kinase B; AS160, AKT
