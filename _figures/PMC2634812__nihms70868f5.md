caption: Schematic of counterbalancing and dose-dependent regulatory forces that act
  on T-cell precursors through the ETP and DN2 stages. Regulators named in red denote
  forces diverting cells from the T-cell pathway. Of these, only EBF and Pax5 are
  not normally active in the thymus during these stages. Notch signaling acts as a
  constraint on all of these alternatives. This dynamic equilibrium is normally resolved
  at the DN3 stage, in part by the downregulation of PU.1, but almost certainly through
  other regulatory changes as well [].
