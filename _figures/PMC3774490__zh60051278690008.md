caption: Ischemia-reperfusion inhibits multiple proteins regulating cap-dependent
  translation. The schematic diagram of proteins regulating signaling pathways controlling
  cap-dependent mRNA translation initiation and elongation. Ischemia-reperfusion inhibits
  cap-dependent translation initiation via inhibition of Akt-mTOR pathway and availability
  of 4E-BP1 to bind to and inhibit eIF4E association with eIF4G to form an active
  mRNA cap-binding complex (eIF4F). Ischemia-reperfusion also activates endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress via eIF2α, which inhibits cap-dependent translation initiation.
  ATF4 and GADD34, each downstream components of eIF2α, are proteins involved in recovery
  from cell stress and are upregulated during ischemia and provide inhibitory feedback
  onto eIF2α. Alterations due to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) additionally stimulate
  mRNA for all three isoforms of eIF4G. Together, these data may potentially provide
  some insight into the dramatic quadriceps atrophy (−12%) occurring within 2 wk post-TKA.
