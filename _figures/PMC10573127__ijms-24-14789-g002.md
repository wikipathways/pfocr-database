caption: Molecular pathways involved in multiciliogenesis. Different transcriptional
  regulators associated with each step in the program are shown, along with the regulatory
  relationships among them, together with the NOTCH signaling pathway that controls
  the initiation of the program. Black lines ending with a perpendicular line indicate
  an inhibitory effect. Dotted arrows and black arrows illustrate stimulation by different
  transcription factors. In progenitor cells, GEMININ is expressed at high levels,
  inhibiting MCIDAS and GEMC1 [11]. At this point, cell cycle genes are active and
  cilia-related genes remain repressed. For cells to differentiate in multiciliate
  cell lineage, GEMININ levels must drop while the levels of GEMC1 increase. GEMC1
  interact with the E2F4/5 and DP1 transcription factors, promoting the transcriptional
  activation of MCIDAS, which also forms complexes with E2F4/5 and DP1 [11]. These
  complexes activate genes required for centriole amplification and cilia formation,
  pushing cells toward multiciliogenesis. MCIDAS is upstream of TAp73, where TAp73
  is a master transcriptional regulator of motile multiciliogenesis in airways, directly
  controlling MYB, CCNO, FOXJ1, and RFX2/3. MYB and CCNO are involved in centriole
  amplification, while FOXJ1 and RFX are implicated in cilia formation [17,31,74].
