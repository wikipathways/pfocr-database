caption: KEGG annotates CCNB1 to belong to the p53 pathway together with CCNB2, CCNB3
  and CDC2 . In the KEGG p53 signaling pathway, these are regulated by the genes SFN,
  GADD45G, GADD45A and GADD45B, which constitute a subset of the p53 target genes.
  In the KEGG glioma pathway, G2 arrest impairment is annotated as one result of the
  altered p53 pathway activation .
