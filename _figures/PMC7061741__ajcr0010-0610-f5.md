caption: A schematic diagram showing the proposed mechanism by which the Hippo signaling
  pathway regulates ovarian cancer. In normal ovarian tissues, deactivated FGF ligands,
  such as FGFRs, are insufficient to activate YAP, leading to ubiquitin-dependent
  degradation of YAP proteins. In ovarian cancer tissues, the nuclear accumulation
  of YAP protein stimulates the expression of FGFs, FGFRs and AREG, thereby activating
  FGF receptors and EGFR, which in turn interact with downstream signaling pathways,
  such as the PI3K and MAPK pathways, inhibiting the Hippo pathway and activating
  the YAP protein. Moreover, the NRSF, UCA1, and LPA-G12/13-RhoA-ROCK-PP1A-YAP signaling
  pathways can stimulate the expression of YAP, miRNA-129-5p, and miRNA-149-5p and
  inhibit the expression of YAP, which affects the occurrence and development of ovarian
  cancer.
