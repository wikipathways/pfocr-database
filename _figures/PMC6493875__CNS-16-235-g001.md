caption: Summary of the synthetic pathway of acetylcholine. Principle of AcheIs functioning.
  Presynaptic cholinergic neuron synthesise acetylcholine (ACh) from choline and acetyl‐CoA.
  Choline‐acetyl transferase (ChAT) is the limiting rate enzyme for synthesis of Ach.
  It is stored in vescicles, and then released in the synaptic cleft. ACh acts on
  postsynaptic neurons on M1 subtype of muscarinic receptors and also on nicotinic
  receptors; in particular, the α7 nicotinic receptor is involved in most of the ACh
  effects on cognitive functions. ACh is then hydrolized through the enzyme acetylcholine‐esterase
  (AChE), allowing for its reuptake through the choline transporter and the high‐affinity
  choline transporter (HACU). To replace cholinergic transmission in patients with
  a diagnosis of AD, drugs able to inhibit AChE (AChEI) were developed, to increase
  the level and action duration of the neurotransmitter ACh. (“cholinergic hypothesis”).
