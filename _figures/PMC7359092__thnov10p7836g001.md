caption: 'Recent discoveries on the protective role of IL-22 against tissue injury.
  IL-22 ameliorates NASH via STAT3-dependent induction of antioxidant enzymes, MT1/2.
  IL-22/STAT3-dependent induction of cyclin D1, BCL2, and anti-bacterial genes as
  well as MT1/2 contributes to the amelioration of ACLF. The IL-22/STAT3/AMPK pathway
  promotes autophagy-dependent mitochondrial protection, which in turn protects against
  APAP-induced liver injury. AMPK/AKT/mTOR signaling is also activated by IL-22, which
  induces genes involved in glycolysis and metabolic reprogramming, thereby suppressing
  the liver injury caused by HFD feeding or cisplatin treatment. The IL-22/STAT3 pathway
  upregulates FGF21 in hepatocytes, which in turn upregulates cardiomyocyte survival
  genes and repairs myocardial infarction-derived cardiac injury. IL-22 produced by
  intestinal innate lymphoid cells upregulates REG3G that inhibits ethanol-induced
  bacterial growth and translocation to the liver, thereby protecting against alcohol-induced
  liver injury. ACLF: acute-on-chronic liver failure; AMPK: AMP-activated protein
  kinase; APAP: acetaminophen; BCL2: B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2; FGF21: fibroblast
  growth factor 21; HFD: high-fat diet; MT: metallothionein; mTOR: mammalian target
  of rapamycin; NASH: nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; REG3G: regenerating islet-derived
  protein 3 gamma; STAT3: signal transducers and activators of transcription 3.'
