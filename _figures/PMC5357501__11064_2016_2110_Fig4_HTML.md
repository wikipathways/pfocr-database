caption: 'The significance of SIRT1 in Alzheimer’s disease. SIRT1 modulates multiple
  pathways that adjust the metabolism of Aβ to keep its levels within physiological
  limits. The sequence of events occurring in AD reduces SIRT1-dependent effects:
  tau deacetylation, inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, and the α-cleavage of APP, leading
  to elevaed Aβ and to intensified pro-inflammatory signaling'
