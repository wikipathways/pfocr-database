caption: Model of how the source and context of activated Gαs and cAMP may determine
  whether they enhance or inhibit TCR-stimulated IL-2 transcription. Interactions
  between the TCR and peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) lead to recruitment
  of CD4 and its associated kinase, p56-Lck, which phosphorylates tyrosine residues
  in the cytoplasmic tails of the TCR subunits, leading to recruitment and phosphorylation
  of the tyrosine kinase, ZAP-70. CD28 co-stimulation provides an additional signal
  that is needed for complete T cell activation and regulation of IL-2 production
  []. ZAP-70 and p56-Lck then phosphorylate and activate numerous downstream target
  proteins, including PLC-γ, leading to Ca2+ increases and activation of a variety
  of downstream pathways including translocation of NFAT to the nucleus and activation
  of IL-2 transcription [] (black and white pathway). Gαs stimulated by a mechanism
  that does not involve GsPCRs, but which could potentially involve the TCR, enhances
  TCR-stimulated IL-2 transcription by a mechanism that may involve binding of pCREB
  to the CRE site of the IL-2 promoter [] during the initial stages of TCR stimulation
  (green pathway, Stimulatory Step 1). In contrast GsPCRs decrease TCR-stimulated
  IL-2 transcription, potentially by utilizing both Gαs and Gβγ signaling in cells
  that have been exposed to at least two days of TCR stimulation (red pathway, Inhibitory
  Step 2). The inhibitory GsPCR/Gαs/cAMP pathway may involve binding of CREM, which
  gradually replaces pCREB, to the CRE site of the IL-2 promoter [] or the formation
  of NFAT/ICER complexes on NFAT/AP-1 composite sites in the IL-2 promoter [], leading
  to repression of transcription (Inhibitory Step 2). Previous studies suggest that
  cAMP increases stimulated by the TCR are smaller and more transient than those stimulated
  by GsPCRs, as depicted by the relative sizes of the cAMP symbols, and this may contribute
  to the opposite effects on IL-2 transcription. Simultaneously, Gβγ may inhibit TCR-stimulated
  IL-2 transcription [] by decreasing TCR-stimulated Ca2+ increases through Cav1 channels
  (Inhibitory Step 2), which are activated by the TCR by an unknown mechanism [].
  Ca2+-calmodulin-activated calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, exposing a nuclear
  localization sequence (NLS) and leading to nuclear translocation.
