caption: The biological effects of the p53-Ac and p73-Ac deacetylation catalyzed by
  SIRTs and HDACs. ↑—upregulation, ↓—downregulation (A) BMRS1 disrupts the interaction
  between SIRT1 and DBC1, decreasing the p53-Ac level. (B) Phosphorylated DBC1 binds
  to SIRT1 that dissociates the SIRT1–p53 complex and simulates p53 acetylation leading
  to apoptosis. (C) BRG1 binds to SIRT1, which results in increased p53-Ac deacetylation
  and inhibits p53/p21-mediated cell senescence. (D) Downregulation of SIRT1 expression
  by specific inhibitors is associated with the upregulation of p53-Ac, which leads
  to the upregulation of proteins involved in apoptosis. (E) Repression of miR-34a/SIRT1/p53
  feedback loop by HNF1A-AS1 leads to a decrease in p53-Ac and activation of the Wtn
  signaling pathway, which, in turn, enhances cancer progression. (F) SIRT1 is regulated
  by several miRNAs, leading to a change of the p53-Ac level and modulation of apoptosis.
  (G) The influence of SIRT3 on p53Ac deacetylation and p53 degradation by the proteasome.
  (H) SIRT6 deacetylates p53-Ac, which is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome.
  (I) SIRT7 deacetylates p53-Ac, which leads to downregulation of Noxa and ultimately
  the inhibition of cell apoptosis. (J) SIRT1, SIRT2, and HDAC1 can deacetylate p73-Ac,
  leading to a decrease in apoptosis and increased cell proliferation and tumorigenicity.BMRS1—breast
  cancer metastasis suppressor 1; DBC1—breast cancer 1; BRG1—brahma-related gene-1;
  HNF1A-AS1—HNF1A-antisense 1 RNA1.
