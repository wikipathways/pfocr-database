caption: The classical Cori cycle that involves shuttling of lactate and glucose between
  skeletal muscle and liver appears to be active in mice with cancer cachexia. Increased
  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, [L-lactate]/[pyruvate], and lactate transporter
  MCT1 is supportive of enhanced lactate production by cachexic skeletal muscle (2
  ATP yield), release into circulation and shuttling to the liver. Livers of cachexic
  mice had increased MCT1, suggesting lactate uptake into the liver for use in gluconeogenesis
  (6 ATP cost). In our prior proteome analysis, cachexic livers showed increased phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase (PEPCK) in this same cohort of tumor bearing mice. PEPCK catalyzes
  a rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis, therefore, increased PEPCK suggests maintained
  drive for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Glucose generated by gluconeogenesis can be used
  as energy by muscle, however decreased glucose transporter expression and ongoing
  accumulation of glycolytic metabolites may impair uptake and use. Another form of
  Cori cycle may involve lactate release from the tumor, shuttling to the liver, gluconeogenesis,
  and shuttling of glucose for use by the tumor. Both muscle-liver and tumor-liver
  shuttles would be energetically costly, with persistent shuttling possibly leading
  to unintended weight loss in cachexia. Another possible inter-organ substrate exchange
  could occur between muscle and tumor, with high production and release of muscular
  lactate shuttled to the energetically demanding tumor. Thus, muscle-derived lactate
  may serve as an important source of energy for tumors that induce subsequent cachexia.
