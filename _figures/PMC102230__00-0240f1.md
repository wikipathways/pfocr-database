caption: Pathway of Moco Biosynthesis in Plants.The proposed starting compound GTP,
  the intermediates precursor Z, and the metal binding MPT as well as the end product
  Moco are shown. Cnx2 and Cnx3 () are involved in opening the pyrazine ring of guanine
  in a cyclohydrolase-like reaction (), forming the sulfur-free precursor Z (). In
  the second step, sulfur has to be introduced to form the dithiolene group. This
  step is catalyzed by MPT synthase, a complex of Cnx6 and Cnx7 (; R.R. Mendel, unpublished
  result) that is resulfurated by the sulfurase Cnx5 (). Finally, Mo is activated
  and incorporated into MPT by the activity of Cnx1 ().
