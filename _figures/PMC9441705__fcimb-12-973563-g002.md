caption: 'Mechanism of action of probiotics. Direct mechanism: probiotics can activate
  sentinel cells through the Toll-like activation of signaling pathways; DCs can drive
  NK cell activation by secreting cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-15, and probiotics
  can impact this pathway; probiotics can cause B cells to differentiate into IgA-producing
  plasma cells; and probiotics also interact with antigen-presenting cells to influence
  the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby triggering an adaptive response.
  Indirect mechanism: Through the manipulation of the gut epithelial barrier and mucus
  layer properties, probiotic release of antimicrobial compounds, and management of
  competition with pathogenic bacteria, specific probiotic metabolites may exert anti-inflammatory
  and antibacterial effects. This figure was drawn by Figdraw.'
