caption: 'Pathway of dietary phytosterol assimilation in humans. Phytosterols and
  dietary cholesterol are mainly absorbed in the intestine through NPC1L1 transporter.
  After absorption, sterols are esterified by ACAT and transported to the liver in
  the form of chylomicrons. The unesterified sterols are pumped out by ABCG5/ABCG8
  transporters. The plasma efflux of sterols is regulated by ABCA1, which is involved
  in the assembly of HDL-like particles with the assimilated sterols. In liver, phytosterols
  stimulate LXR receptors regulating ApoE expression required for HDL and LDL assembly
  and uptake. Stimulated LXR receptors upregulate ABCG5/G8 transporters and augment
  sterol absorption. The exported HDL-like particles containing phytosterols are taken
  up by SR-IB receptors expressed on the liver, adrenal, and brain surface. SR-B1
  has a crucial role in the flux of phytosterols across the BBB. ABCA1/ABCG1 transporters
  present on astrocytes and the basolateral side of the cerebral endothelium also
  assist in the transfer of phytosterols. Inside the brain, PS exert a positive effect
  on brain function by escalating A-β plaque clearance, increasing re-myelination
  besides reducing neuro inflammation and BACE 1 activity. Abbreviations: ABC, ATP-binding
