caption: 'Common molecular regulators include gene products that affect both autophagy
  and apoptosis and the pathways that they influence. The process of apoptotic cell
  death is mediated by two central pathways: an extrinsic pathway involving cell surface
  receptors (the death receptor pathway), and an intrinsic pathway using mitochondria
  and the endoplasmic reticulum (the mitochondrial pathway). A third pathway is mediated
  by cytolytic T and NK cells delivering perforin/granzymes to promote apoptosis.
  CD95 (also called Fas or APO-1) induces apoptosis by forming a death-inducing signaling
  complex (DISC) at the receptor that contains FADD, caspase-8, and the caspase-8
  regulator. Autophagy can degrade active caspase-8. The FLICE inhibitory protein
  (FLIP), a caspase-like molecule without proteolytic activity, protects cells from
  CD95-induced apoptosis. FLIP can suppress autophagy. The intrinsic mitochondrial
  pathway is activated by diverse apoptotic signals such as DNA damage, growth factor
  deprivation, and oxidative stress. Cytoplasmic translocation of mitochondrial proteins
  [such as cytochrome c (cyt c) and Smac/DIABLO] lead to activation of the caspase
  cascade and initiate apoptosis. A pivotal event in the mitochondrial pathway is
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is mainly regulated
  by Bcl-2 family members. Some of the Bcl-2 family members (e.g. Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL)
  are anti-apoptotic, whereas others (e.g. Bax, tBid, Bad, Bim, PUMA, and Noxa) are
  pro-apoptotic. Mitophagy is a well established mechanism necessary for elimination
  of dysfunctional mitochondria and regulation of mitochondrial quality in yeast or
  mammalian cells associated with cytosolic mediators such as NIX, Atg32, optic atrophy
  1 (OPA1), dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), Parkin,
  Pink1, voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), p62/Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), mitofusin
  1, and mitofusin 2. Beclin 1, the mammalian orthologue of yeast Atg6, plays a central
  role in autophagy. It interacts with several cofactors (e.g. Atg14L, UVRAG, Bif-1,
  Rubicon, Ambra1, HMGB1, nPIST, VMP1, SLAM, IP3R, PINK, and Survivin) to regulate
  the formation of Beclin 1-PI3KC3 complexes, thereby inducing autophagy. In contrast,
  the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 is bound to and inhibited by Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. This interaction
  can be disrupted by phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Beclin 1, or ubiquitination of
  Beclin 1. Interestingly, caspase-mediated cleavage of Beclin 1 promotes cross-talk
  between apoptosis and autophagy. Although apoptosis-associated cleavage of Beclin
  1 and Atg5 inactivates autophagy, the cleavage of Atg4D by caspase-3 generates a
  fragment with increased autophagic activity. In the presence of growth factors,
  growth factor receptor signaling activates PI3KC1 at the plasma membrane. PI3KC1
  activates the downstream target AKT, leading to activation of mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR) by inhibiting the tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1–TSC2), which
  results in inhibition of autophagy. Overexpression of the phosphatase and tensin
  homologue (PTEN) gene, by an inducible promoter, antagonizes PI3KC1 to induce autophagy.
  RAS has a dual effect on autophagy. When it activates PI3KC1, autophagy is inhibited,
  but when it selectively activates the RAF1–mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
  (MEK)–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade, autophagy is stimulated.
  AMPK monitors the energy status of the cell by sensing the AMP:ATP ratio. Several
  upstream kinases, including liver kinase B1 (LKB1, which is activated by energy
  depletion), calcium/calmodulin kinase kinase-β (CaMKKβ, which is activated by cytosolic
  Ca2+ levels), and TGFβ activated kinase-1 (TAK-1, which is also involved in IKK
  activation), can activate AMPK by phosphorylation. Activated AMPK promotes inhibition
  of mTOR kinase, which induces autophagy. NF-κB and p53 play a double role in regulating
  autophagy in a transcription dependent and/or independent fashion. In contrast,
  E2F1 and FOXO3 positively regulate autophagy in a transcription dependent fashion.
  Nuclear HMGB1 inhibits the p53-dependent transactivation from the Bax promoter.
  Accumulation of cytosolic HMGB1 sustains autophagy by liberating the Beclin 1 and
  PI3KC3 complexes. RAGE-induced autophagy is associated with decreased phosphorylation
  of mTOR and increased Beclin1-PI3KC3 interactions.'
