caption: Low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on the plasma membrane bind LDL
  particles and are delivered into early endosomes (EE) via clathrin-mediated endocytosis
  (1). As EE acidify and mature into late endosomes (LE), LDL dissociates from the
  LDLR and the LDLR is sorted into the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) and returned
  to the plasma membrane. LDL continues along the endocytic pathway and ultimately
  reaches the lysosome (2), where the LDL is broken down (3). Lysosomal acid lipase
  (LipA) hydrolyzes cholesteryl esters to release free cholesterol. Cholesterol is
  shuttled through the lysosomal lumen by NPC2, and subsequently transferred to the
  luminal N-terminal domain of the polytopic transmembrane protein NPC1 (4). The mechanisms
  of cholesterol export from the lysosome are still unknown, although they are likely
  to occur through several parallel routes that may involve the formation of membrane
  contact sites (shown by bidirectional dashed lines) between the lysosome and acceptor
  membranes (5). Endogenous cholesterol synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  requires multiple biosynthetic enzymes including the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA
  reductase. Under conditions of cholesterol abundance, ER cholesterol can be esterified
  by Acetyl-CoA Acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) and stored in lipid droplets (6).
