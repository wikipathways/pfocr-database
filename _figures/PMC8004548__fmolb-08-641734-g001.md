caption: Interleukin-6 classical and trans-signaling. In the classical signaling,
  interleukin-6 (IL-6) binds to a membrane bound-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) triggering
  the attachment and dimerization of glycoprotein 130 (gp130), followed by the activation
  of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase JAK that phosphorylates the STAT transcription
  factors. The activation of non-canonical signaling pathways, such as SHP-2/ERK,
  was also described. In the trans-signaling, soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) was produced
  by shedding of the membrane bound IL-6R by ADAM10 or ADAM17. In human, but not in
  mice, sIL-6R was also produced by alternative splicing. IL-6 interacts with sIL-6R
  and the IL-6/sIL-6R complex binds a membrane bound gp130, activating the same signaling
  pathway described for classical signaling. Soluble gp130 (sgp130) was produced mainly
  by alternative splicing and also by shedding of the membrane bound gp130 by ADAM17
  and A disintegrin. sgp130 binds the IL-6/sIL-6R complex and selectively inhibits
  the trans-signaling without affecting the classical signaling. Negative feedback
  involves the Stat-dependent expression of SOCS1/2 that inhibit JAK activity. Membrane
  bound IL-6 was described in hepatocytes and immune cells. Membrane bound gp130 is
  ubiquitous expressed in all cells.
