caption: STC1 expression and cell invasion. STC1 expression is increased via a PI-3K/Akt/NF-κB-dependent
  signaling pathway. STC-1 protein is subsequently secreted into the extracellular
  matrix in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Secreted STC1 binds to its receptors on
  the surface of the cell membrane to form a complex which initiates the JNK/c-Jun
  signaling pathway. Activated c-Jun dimerizes with the Fos family of proteins to
  form AP-1, which activates MMP-9 transcriptional activity. Finally, increased MMP-9
  expression results in increased cell invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells
  as a result of extracellular matrix degradation. STC1, stanniocalcin-1; PI-3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB.
