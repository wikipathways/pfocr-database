caption: Schematic representation of the role of lipid rafts in Coronavirus infection
  of the host cells is a multistep endocytic process characterized by a series of
  complex events tightly regulated in space and time. Step 1 Entry process of coronavirus
  into the host cells is initiated by the binding of the spike glycoprotein with the
  specific receptor (ACE2, APN/CD13) located into lipid rafts/caveolae. This interaction
  causes conformational changes of the viral particle, which trigger specific signaling
  events necessary for the viral entry mechanism. Step 2 Lipid rafts/caveolae-mediated
  endocytosis is followed by intracellular trafficking of virus particles in transport
  vesicles (early and late endosomes). The low pH in late endosomes induces a conformational
  change in coronavirus that mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal
  membrane. Step 3 Viral genomes are translated in two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab,
  which encode the non-structural viral proteins that form the replication transcription
  complex. This complex produces genomic RNA as well as multiple subgenomic mRNAs
  encoding structural proteins. Translation of mRNA encoding for the nucleocapsid
  proteins occurs in the cytoplasm where the newly synthesized proteins interact with
  new genomes to form ribonucleoprotein particles. In contrast, matrix, envelope and
  spike proteins translation occurs into the ER. Coronavirus uses also the autophagy
  machinery for replication and has evolved strategies to avoid autophagy-induced
  lysosomal degradation. Step 4 After assembly the progeny viral particles, virus-containing
  vesicles (smooth-wall vesicles) are budded and released into the extracellular environment
  through fusion with the plasma membrane (exocytosis). Alternatively, we speculate
  that coronavirus might utilize multivescicular bodies (MVBs) and take advantage
  of the exosomal pathway for egress.
