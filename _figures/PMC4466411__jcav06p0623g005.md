caption: 'A schematic model of the molecular mechanisms associated with PD-induced
  autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cells. According to this model, when NCI-H460 and
  A549 cells were exposed to PD, the phagosome converted to double-layered membranes
  of autophagosomes through increasing expression levels of Atg proteins including
  Beclin-1, Atg-3 and Atg-7 as well as leading to the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II.
  The inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and activation of JNK and p38
  MAPK signaling pathways contributed to the accumulation of LC3-II, which were the
  possible upstream signaling pathways of PD-induced autophagy. Once the autophagosome
  was developed, its maturation was complete upon fusion with lysosome to form autophagolysosome.
  Eventually, programmed cell death was induced by PD. The schematic model compiled
  with the results and conclusions of this study (→: Stimulatory Modification, ⊥:
  Inhibitory Modification).'
