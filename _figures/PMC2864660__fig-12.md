caption: The transsulfuration pathway. Dietary methionine is converted to the methyl
  donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and is demethylated to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)
  and homocysteine. In the transsulfuration pathway, homocysteine is converted to
  cystathionine that can be transformed into cysteine. Cysteine, in turn, can be used
  in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Homocysteine also can be remethylated to methionine,
  either through the folate cycle by using 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF)
  involving the enzyme methionine synthase (MS), or by using betaine and the enzyme
  betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). Both GSH and SAM can be transported
  to the mitochondria; however, whereas cholesterol loading in the mitochondria inhibits
  GSH transport, mitochondrial SAM transport is insensitive to membrane dynamics.
