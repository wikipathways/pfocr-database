caption: Glucose and Glutamine Targeting for the Metabolic Management of CancerMost
  if not all tumor cells, regardless of tissue origin, are largely dependent on glucose
  and glutamine for ATP synthesis, growth,and survival (; ). ATP synthesis through
  SLP in the cell cytoplasm (glycolysis) and in the TCA cycle (glutaminolysis) will
  compensate for diminished ATP synthesis arising from defective OxPhos or hypoxia
  that occurs in many tumors. The calorie-restricted ketogenic diet (KD-R) will reduce
  glucose carbons for both the glycolytic pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) that supply ATP and metabolic precursors for synthesis of glutathione, lipids,
  and nucleotides. Glutaminase inhibitors, like 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON),
  will deplete glutamate and the glutamine-derived amide nitrogen needed for ammonia
  and nucleotide synthesis (). Depletion of glutamine-derived glutamate will reduce
  anapleurotic carbons to the TCA cycle through α-KG for protein synthesis, while
  also reducing energy production through the succinyl-CoA ligase reaction in the
  TCA cycle. Glutamine-derived glutamate is also used for glutathione production,
  which protects tumor cells from oxidative stress. The KD-R + DON will make tumor
  cells vulnerable to lethal oxidative stress. The simultaneous targeting of glucose
  and glutamine, using the KD-R + DON, will thus starve tumor cells of ATP synthesis
  while also blocking their ability to synthesize lipids, proteins, and nucleotides.
  Metabolic starvation could also reduce extracellular acidification through reduction
  of lactate and succinate, the end products of glucose and glutamine fermentation,
  respectively. The elevation of non-fermentable ketone bodies is tumor cell toxic
  and is unable to replace glucose and glutamine for energy. Importantly, ketone bodies
  protect normal cells from oxidative stress while providing an alternative energy
  source to glucose. Figure and legend modified with permission from (; ).
