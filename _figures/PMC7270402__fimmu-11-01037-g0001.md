caption: The immune landscape of the HBV-based tumor microenvironment. Under virus
  infection conditions, the immune status of an HCC-bearing host becomes more immunosuppressive
  and is characterized by weakening of co-stimulatory signal, enhancement of co-inhibitory
  signals, functional impairment, decreased quantity of tumor-killing T cells, such
  as CD8+ and enrichment of Tregs. Therein, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a suppressive
  role to produce cancer immune escape, while the LAG3/MHC-II, Tim-3/galectin 9, and
  CTLA-4/(CD80, CD86) pathways also contribute to this process. This figure was drawn
  with Adobe Illustrator CS5. TCR, T-cell receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; APC, antigen-presenting cell; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1; PD-L1,
  programmed death-ligand 1; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4;
  Tim-3, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3; LAG3, lymphocyte activation gene
  3; TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta.
