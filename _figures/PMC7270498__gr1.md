  miRNAs and lncRNAs can regulate intracellular drug concentrations in HCC cells by
  targeting drug efflux pumps. Several miRNAs and lncRNAs dominate the expression
  of drug efflux pumps and metabolizing enzymes in HCC cells through the Nrf2 signaling
  pathway. miR-215 inhibits the expression of DHFR and TS, which are important targets
  of chemotherapeutic agents. miRNAs and lncRNAs also orchestrate the survival and
  proliferation of HCC cells by regulating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. ABC transporter,
