caption: Schematic biochemical pathway for the production of bioactive chemical mediators
  leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Cellular activation leads to translocation
  of both 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2a) to the nuclear
  membrane, where 5-LO converts the free arachidonic acid into leukotriene A4 (LTA4).
  LTA4 is in a substrate for nuclear membrane-associated LTC4 synthase (LTCS) and
  glutathione as well as cytosolic LTC4 hydrolase (LTA4H). Resulting bioactive leukotrienes
  are then transported into the extracellular matrix where they can encounter leukotriene
  receptors on nearby cell plasma membranes. In addition to this, LTA4 can be exported
  into an adjacent cell for transcellular biosynthesis into these bioactive leukotrienes.
