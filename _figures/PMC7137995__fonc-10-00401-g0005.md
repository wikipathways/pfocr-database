caption: Metabolic pathway of ganglioside synthesis and metabolism, where the name
  in bold is the name of the ganglioside above it; and the name next each arrow represents
  the gene encoding the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction represented by the arrow
  [adapted from Yu et al. ()]. The width of each red/blue arrow represents roughly
  the relative expression level of the corresponding gene, and color red is for reactions
  that each produce one net proton and blue for pH neutral reactions while reactions
  without such arrows are for those without expressions.
