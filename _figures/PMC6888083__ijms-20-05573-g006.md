caption: 'Mutual regulatory mechanisms among lncRNAs and miRNAs. (A) Pi starvation
  induces lncRNA IPS1, Pi-deficiency-induced long-noncoding RNA1 (PILNCR1), and PDIL1
  levels in Arabidopsis, maize, and Medicago truncatula, respectively, and these lncRNAs
  sequester miR399 and block its function in cleavage of PHO2 transcripts. (B) LncRNA
  small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) acts as a sponge for many miRNAs (such
  as miR-98, miR-216-5p, miR-302a-3p, miR-497, miR-140-5p, miR-1301, miR-218-5p, miR-195,
  and miR-135a), thus regulating gene expression involved in multiple human cancers.
  (C) lncRNA ATB, MALAT1, and SNHG16 function as miR195 sponges regulating target
  gene expression. (D) lncRNA MIR100HG has miR-100 and miR-125b precursor sequences
  that can produce miR-100 and miR-125b. miR-100 and miR-125b coordinately downregulate
  five negative regulatory factors (DKK1, DKK3, ZNRF3, RNF43, and APC2) in canonical
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling, thus increasing Wnt signaling and cetuximab resistance.
  GATA6 inhibits lncRNA MIR100HG expression, whereas miR-125b targets GATA6 and relieves
  this repression. (E) MuLnc1 is cleaved by mul-miR3954 and produces the secondary
  siRNA si161579, which targets and silences calmodulin-like protein gene CML27 (MuCML27)
  expression. The regulatory network of mul-miR3954-MuLnc1-si161579-MuCML27 is involved
  in the mulberry response to environmental stress. (F) miR3954 directly cleaves two
  lncRNAs (Cs1 g09600 and Cs1 g09635) and produces phasiRNA, which targets several
  NAC homologous genes including Cs7 g22460 (NAC); Cs7 g22460 is also a miR3954 target
  gene. The miR3954-lncRNA-phasiRNA-NAC pathway regulates early flowering in citrus.
