caption: The ALDH1A1-retinoic acid-HIF-1α-VEGF pathway is activated in breast cancer
  MCF-7 cells (A). VEGF drives breast and lung cancer-initiating stem cells through
  the VEGFR-2-STAT3 signaling pathway that upregulates MYC and SOX2 gene expression
  (B). RA, through RARβ, increases the production of CXCL12/SDF-1 in stroma cells
  and, consequently, activates the Src-ErbB2-Akt signaling pathway in breast cancer
  cells, promoting survival, cell growth, and invasion (C). When the nontumorigenic,
  immortalized mammary epithelial cell line, MCF12A and the non-invasive breast cancer
  cell line T47D were treated with RA, the RA nuclear receptor RARβ associated with
  a methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET2) that produces DNA demethylation. The consequence
  is the induction of genes involved in cell differentiation and the activation of
  miR-200c expression. MiR-200c downregulates stemness targeting the protein kinase
  PKCζ. RA does not perform these actions in aggressive breast cancers (D).
