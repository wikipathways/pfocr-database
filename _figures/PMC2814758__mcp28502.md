caption: Interactions between carbon and nitrogen metabolic signalling networks. The
  link between SnRK1 and GCN2 and the effect of nitrogen availability on the GCN2
  signalling pathway are hypothetical and therefore represented by dashed arrows.
  In animal and fungal systems the sugar signalling → GCN2 link comprises several
  factors, probably including the protein kinase TOR1.
