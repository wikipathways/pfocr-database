caption: A schematic diagram elucidating the potential mechanism underlying the synergistic
  effect of bevacizumab (Bv) on 5‐FU. Bv increased TP expression, which could facilitate
  VEGFA secretion and promote tumor angiogenesis. However, in tumor cells, elevated
  TP by Bv can drive 5‐FU metabolic activation forward and damage DNA synthesis. In
  contrast, the promotion of angiogenesis or resistance by TP may be diminished. This
  suggests the superiority of Bv in combination with fluoropyrimidine drugs compared
  to other chemotherapeutic drugs
