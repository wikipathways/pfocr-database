caption: Signal transduction pathways are induced by thyroxine and heteronemin in
  cancer cells. Thyroxine binds to cell surface integrin αvβ3 receptor to activate
  signal transduction pathways such as ERK1/2 and STAT3. Those signals play vital
  roles in gene expression involved in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. In
  addition, thyroxine suppresses pro-apoptotic gene expression and the activities
  of caspases. On the other hand, heteronemin suppresses ERK1/2 activation and increases
  ROS production. It inhibits the expression of proliferative genes. In addition,
  heteronemin activates the caspase signal pathway
