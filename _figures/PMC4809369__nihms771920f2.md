caption: LIF/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in mouse ESC self-renewal. a Binding of LIF
  to its membrane receptor results in recruitment of JAKs and phosphorylation of STAT3
  at Tyrosine 705. Activated STAT3 dimerizes and translocates into nucleus to activate
  transcription. LIF also activates PI3K/AKT and SHP2/MAPK pathways that are not essential
  for mouse ESC self-renewal. b STAT3 activation level is critical for maintaining
  mouse ESC self-renewal. Multiple downstream target genes have been identified to
  connect STAT3 signaling to core pluripotency network
