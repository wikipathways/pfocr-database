caption: Fibroblast growth factor receptors and genes that are involved in FGF pathway
  were analyzed by IPA in KC iPSC compared with normal iPSC. The genes that are upregulated
  or downregulated are shown. Fibroblast growth factor signal transduction. Formation
  of the FGF:FGFR:HS signaling complex causes the activation of the intracellular
  kinase domains and the cross-phosphorylation of tyrosines on the FGFRs. FRS2 interacts
  with the phosphorylated tyrosines and is phosphorylated itself. FRS2 then activates
  the adaptor protein Grb2 that associates with SOS, a nucleotide exchange factor
  that activates Ras. Ras is a small GTP binding protein that activates Raf, which
  activates MEK and that activates ERK, the downstream targets are the cell differentiation,
  cell growth, and morphogenesis. FRS2 activity also activates phosphoinositide-3
  kinase, which activates AKT/PKB and it affects cell survival. PLCγ binds the actvated
  FGFR by its SH2 domain and then generates inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG from
  phosphotidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate resulting in the activation of protein kinase
  C and the release of intracellular calcium. The downstream targets also affect angiogenesis,
  which are through the JNK and p38MAPK.
