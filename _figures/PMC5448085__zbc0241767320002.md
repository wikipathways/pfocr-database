caption: Drugging the gut microbial TMAO pathway for the treatment of prevention of
  cardiometabolic disease. Dietary consumption of choline, phosphatidylcholine (PC),
  carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine, and likely other methylamine-containing source nutrient
  gut microbes provides substrate for gut bacterial production of TMA through the
  collective actions of several TMA lyase enzymes. Bacteria expressing the YeaW/X
  enzyme complex can sequentially convert l-carnitine to γ-butyrobetaine and then
  γ-butyrobetaine to TMA. TMA can be generated from another l-carnitine TMA lyase
  enzyme complex known as CntA/B. Choline and phosphatidylcholine can be used by the
  CutC/D enzyme complex to generate a substantial pool of TMA. Once generated from
  these distinct sources, TMA enters the portal circulation where it is ultimately
  delivered to the host liver. The host flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) family
  of enzymes, especially FMO3, can then convert TMA to TMAO. TMAO can then promote
  atherosclerosis, thrombosis, heart failure, kidney disease, and insulin resistance
  via tissue- or cell type-specific reprogramming. Inhibition and choline and l-carnitine
  TMA lyase activity by DMB can blunt atherosclerosis progression in mice. The TMAO
  pathway represents one of the first pathways where small molecule inhibitors targeting
  microbial enzymes can benefit host disease.
