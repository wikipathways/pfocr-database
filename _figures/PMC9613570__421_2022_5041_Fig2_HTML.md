caption: Flow-responsive mechanosensory pathways. Changes in flow are detected within
  the endothelial cell through several mechanosensory pathways. There are broadly
  four key signalling cascades regulating gene expression. Membrane bound mechanosensory
  receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), Piezo1 and transient receptor
  potential vanilloid-type 4 (TRPV4) ion channels and glycocalyx members (including
  syndecan and glypican), induce changes in gene expression via the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathway (MEK5/ERK5). In addition, the VE-cadherin–PECAM-1–VEGFR2/3
  mechanosensory complex [comprising of VE-cadherin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion
  molecule 1 (PECAM-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and 3 (VEGFR2/3)]
  can induce a cascade of responses, through the activation of Src-dependent phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase (PI3K) and subsequent activation of the protein kinase Akt. Integrin-associated
  pathways can also induce signalling cascade responses via the p130Cas Scaffold and
  ERK5, either in response to activation via Akt signalling or through detection in
  changes in extracellular matrix structures in response to flow. Finally, activation
  of calveolins within membrane calveolae is also capable of inducing vasodilatory
  responses, via the activation of membrane-bound calcium (Ca2+) channels. Cumulatively,
  these signalling cascades induce changes in gene expression and acute vasodilatory
  responses via elevation in nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) production.
