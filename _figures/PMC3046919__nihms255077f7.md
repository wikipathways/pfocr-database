caption: Proposed model of the process of A20. In the present study we demonstrated
  that the inhibitory effects of A20 are achieved by blocking 4 proposed signaling
  pathways. First, activated TAK1 results in activation of p38 and JNK signaling pathways,
  enhances hypertrophic markers expression, and subsequently leads to cardiac hypertrophy.
  Second, TAK1 is shown to promote the Smad signaling, increase expression of fibrotic
  markers, and result in collagen synthesis and fibrosis. Third, activation of TAK1
  leads to signaling through the IKKβ/IκBα/NF-κB pathway, promoting proinflammatory
  cytokine expression and leading to inflammation. Fourth, hypertrophic stimuli also
  activate apoptotic signaling, ultimately leading to apoptosis. A20 blocks these
  proposed TAK1-dependent signaling pathways and apoptotic signaling and then protects
  against cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis, finally preventing
  the progression of cardiac remodeling and heart failure.
