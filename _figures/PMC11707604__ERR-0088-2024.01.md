caption: Severe asthma immunopathogenesis in type 2 (T2)-high asthma and the specific
  targets of biologic therapies. In the T2-high pathway, on exposure to allergens,
  pollutants or microbes, the airway epithelium releases alarmins such as interleukin
  (IL)-33, IL-25 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). The dendritic cells (DCs)
  present these aeroallergens to naïve CD4+ T-cells (Th0), which promotes their differentiation
  into Th2 cells. IL-4 plays a key role in this differentiation. The Th2 cells, along
  with type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), produce high levels of type 2 cytokines
  such as IL-4, IL5 and IL-13. Besides promoting the differentiation of Th0 to Th2,
  IL-4, along with IL-13, plays a major role in driving IgE isotype switching in B-lymphocytes.
  IgE then binds to the high-affinity receptors (FcεRI) on the surface of mast cells
  and basophils. On re-exposure to the same allergens, these interact with the IgE
  and induces the mast cells/basophils to release histamines, leukotrienes and prostaglandins
  resulting in bronchoconstriction. Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the
  high-affinity receptors on mast cells/basophils. IL-5 stimulates proliferation,
  differentiation and activation of eosinophils. Activated eosinophils release leukotrienes
  and toxic granules, which leads to airway inflammation, tissue damage and acute
  asthma flare. Three biologics, mepolizumab, reslizumab and benralizumab, target
  the IL-5 pathway. Besides its important role in recruiting eosinophils along with
  IL-4, IL-13 induces nitric oxide synthase, elicits mucus hypersecretion and stimulates
  airway smooth muscle contraction. Dupilumab inhibits the IL-4 and IL-13 signalling
  pathways. Inflammation in T2-low asthma is neutrophilic or absent (pauci-granulocytic).
  The alarmins TSLP and IL-33 may contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness in T2-low
  asthma. Tezepelumab inhibits the TSLP and the downstream inflammatory cascade. Created
