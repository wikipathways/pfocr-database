caption: Differences between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The energy
  obtained from glucose oxidation and glycolysis is very different, even in oxygen-activated
  Th cells which use glycolysis. The same situation also is observed in cancer cells.
  Because of this, the tumor environment is acidic. Activated Th and cancer cells
  use glycolysis to supply protein, DNA, and lipids to support proliferation.
