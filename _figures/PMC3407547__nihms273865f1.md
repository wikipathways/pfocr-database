caption: A. In the early stage of HIV-infection, the binding of HIV-1 or HIV-1 proteins
  with macrophage cell surface receptors induces intracellular signaling cascades
  such as Akt-1, ERKs, and NF-κB pathways. Activated Akt-1 and ERKs may inhibit FOXO
  function by phosphorylation. Subsequently, phosphorylated FOXO translocates to the
  cytoplasm and facilitates ubiquitination and degradation. As a consequence, inhibitory
  effect of FOXO to NF-κB was removed, which leads to enhanced NF-κB activation that
  promote viral replication, cell survival, inflammation and cytokine/chemokines production.B.
  In the late stage of HIV-infection, it has been suggested that productive HIV-1
  infection compromises PI3k/Akt-1 pathway, which lead to the activation of FOXO and
  translocation of FOXO in the nucleus. Activated FOXO triggers apoptosis pathways
  through increased expression of apoptotic proteins such as Puma. Activated FOXO
  can also inhibit NF-κB, preventing its pro-survival function. Dashed line indicates
  signal attenuation.
