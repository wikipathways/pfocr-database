caption: Genetic alterations of key components of the growth factor receptor-PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway are frequently observed in primary (IDH wild-type) GBM, which
  eventually activate mTOR signaling. c-Myc, a master regulator of cancer metabolism
  is transcriptionally and functionally regulated by two distinct mTOR complexes,
  mTORC1 and mTORC2. This circuit of metabolic shifting causes GBM cell resistance
  to molecularly targeted therapies by maintaining elevated levels of c-Myc. Interestingly,
  RTK- and Myc-dependent metabolic reprogramming might be also involved in malignant
  progression of IDH-mutant gliomas.del, deletion; EGFRvIII, epidermal growth factor
