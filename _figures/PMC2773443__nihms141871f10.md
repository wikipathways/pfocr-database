caption: Uronate isomerase (URI) catalyzes the first step in the pathway for the metabolism
  of D-glucuronate and D-galacturonate. In this transformation, D-glucuronate and
  D-galacturonate are initially isomerized into their corresponding keto products,
  D-fructuronate and D-tagaturonate, respectively (). D-Fructuronate and D-tagaturonate
  are then reduced to D-mannonate and D-altronate, respectively, by mannonate and
  altronate dehydrogenase in the presence of NADH (). The pathways converge through
  a dehydration reaction where mannonate dehydrase and altronate dehydrase convert
  mannonate and altronate to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconic acid (KDG). This product is
  then phosphorylated by the enzyme ketodeoxygluconic acid kinase with ATP to form
  2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconic acid (KDG-6-P). In the final step of this pathway,
  2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconic acid is cleaved by an aldolase to yield pyruvate
  and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which enter the citric acid cycle and glycolysis.
  The entire pathway is summarized in  (,).
