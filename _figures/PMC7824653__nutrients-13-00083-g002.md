caption: Scheme of mechanisms by which chronic kidney disease (CKD) impairs muscle
  protein metabolism. The inhibition of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is associated with
  an inhibition of IGF-I and insulin actions on muscle protein synthesis and growth;
  in addition, downregulation of p-Akt increases protein degradation, by acting on
  atrogin-1, MuRF-1 and caspase-3. Overexpression of Myostatin by inflammation results
  in cachexia by increased protein degradation because of upregulation of atrogin-1
  and MuRF-1. Inflammation upregulates nucleolar protein 66 (NO66), which suppresses
  both ribosomal DNA transcription and muscle protein synthesis via a demethylase
  mechanism.
