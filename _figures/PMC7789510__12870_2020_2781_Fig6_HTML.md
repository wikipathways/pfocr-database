caption: 'The simplified schema and functions of SAUR genes in plant evolution. During
  the process of plant evolution, SAUR gene family from bryophyta to anthophyta expended
  largely, and every clade experienced expansion at different degrees (left panel).
  Right panel of Fig. 6 showed the function of SAUR genes in response to hormonal
  and environmental signals: based on acid growth mediated by plasma membrane H+-ATPase,
  auxin-responsive SAUR proteins (AtSAUR 19- and AtSAUR 26-subclades in clade 1) activate
  plasma membrane H+-ATPase by inhibiting PP2C-D phosphatases to promote cell expansion
  []. The AtSAUR76-subclade in clade 9 mediates ethylene signaling via interaction
  with Ethylene Insensitive 4 (EIN4) and Ethylene Receptor 2 (ETR2) to promote plant
  growth []. The SAUR41-subclade is inducible by abscisic acid to modulate cell expansion
  and salt tolerance, and maintain calcium homeostasis []. Auxin Response Factor 6
  (ARF6), Brassinazole Resistant1 (BZR1) and Phytochrome Interacting Factor 4 (PIF4)
  may directly regulate transcription of AtSAUR19-subclade and AtSAUR26-subclade independently
  or as a complex [] sensing hormonal and environmental signals including auxin, brassinosteroids
  (BR), gibberellin (GA), jasmonic acid (JA), light, heat and shade [, , –]. Arabidopsis
  zinc-finger protein 1 (AZF1) and AZF2 in the ABA-response pathway can repress the
  expression of AtSAUR63 subclade []'
