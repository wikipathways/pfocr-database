caption: Schematics of the core pathway components and how they interact. (A) When
  the Hippo pathway is ON, MST1/2 phosphorylate SAV1 and together they phosphorylate
  and activate MOB1A/B and LATS1/2, which then phosphorylate YAP and TAZ. Phosphorylated
  YAP and TAZ are sequestered in the cytoplasm by the 14-3-3 phosphopeptide binding
  proteins and shunted for proteasomal degradation. As a result, the TEAD transcription
  factors associate with VGL4 and suppress target gene expression. (B) When the Hippo
  pathway is OFF, the MST1/2 and LATS1/2 kinases are inactive, YAP and TAZ are not
  phosphorylated and accumulate in the nucleus where they displace VGL4 and complex
  with TEADs. YAP and TAZ are transcriptional co-activators and in complex with TEADs
  promote the expression of target genes.
