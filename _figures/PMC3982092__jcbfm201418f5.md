caption: Cerebral neovascularization in diabetes after stroke. A representative diagram
  illustrating the mechanisms by which vasoregression of cerebral vessels occurs in
  diabetes after stroke. When stroke is overlayed on diabetes pathology, there is
  greater hemorrhagic transformation and free iron accumulation that induces cell
  death. In addition, adding stroke injury to diabetes dramatically increases peroxynitrite
  (PN) formation and nitration of p85 regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase that downregulates
  the downstream pro-survival Akt pathway and activates the pro-apoptic p38MAP kinase
  pathway. Finally, increases in angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and activation of toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR4) increase endothelial death and promote vasoregression in diabetes
  after stroke. ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species.
