caption: Multi-target therapeutic strategies for BBB repair. Schematic presentation
  of BBB treatment by targeting the Wnt signaling pathway, anti-inflammatory factors,
  and mitochondria. (1) The Wnt7a/b—Gpr124/Reck co-receptor complex binds to Frizzled
  receptors, activating the Wnt signaling pathway to restore BBB integrity. (2) Inflammatory
  signaling activates NF-κB, leading to the downregulation of tight junction proteins
  (ZO-1, occludin, etc.) and subsequent BBB impairment. Metformin counteracts this
  process by suppressing NF-κB activation through AMPK pathway stimulation. (3) Therapeutic
  antioxidant-loaded T807/TPP-RBC-NPs demonstrate direct mitochondrial targeting capability
  in neurons, effectively reducing oxidative stress to alleviate pathological symptoms.
  Future development should focus on engineering nanoparticles specifically targeting
  endothelial cell mitochondria within the BBB
