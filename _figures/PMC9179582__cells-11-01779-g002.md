caption: Mechanisms involving TG2 in cancer. TG2 is aberrantly expressed in several
  cancers where it modulates molecules involved in the activation of oncogenic pathways.
  TG-ase activity is linked to EMT, metastatic progression and drug resistance by
  regulating NF-κB, CREB, and YAP/TAZ signaling. By promoting integrin-mediated cell
  adhesion to FN, TG2 regulates β-catenin activation through a c-Src-dependent mechanism,
  leading to cancer cell proliferation and stemness. Active TG2/FN/β-Integrin complexes
  modulate PI3K/Akt pathway enhancing resistance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy.
  As a GTP-ase, TG2 regulates NF-κB and HIF-1α signaling which are involved in EMT,
  drug resistance and stemness.
