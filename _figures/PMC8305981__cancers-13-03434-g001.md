caption: Lipid metabolism in CML stem cells. Glycerophospholipids (phospholipids),
  which organize the lipid bilayer in a cell’s plasma membrane, are synthesized from
  lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs). LPAs originate from glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) via
  the Kennedy pathway (de novo pathway). Phospholipids are converted to lysophospholipids
  via the Lands’ cycle (remodeling pathway), which can reverse to produce a wide variety
  of phospholipids. Lysophospholipids are recycled back into LPAs by lysophospholipase
  D enzymes such as Gdpd3. Whereas phospholipids have two hydrophobic fatty acid chains,
  lysophospholipids and LPAs have only one fatty acid chain. Thus, lysophospholipids
  and LPAs are more hydrophilic than phospholipids and can act as lipid second messengers.
  We recently demonstrated that CML stemness in vivo depends on Gdpd3 and its function
  in lysophospholipid metabolism [].
