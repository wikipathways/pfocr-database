caption: This diagram of BCR/CD19-initiated signaling shows two key outcomes of PI3K
  activation. PIP3 production by class IA PI3K promotes formation of a signalosome
  containing Btk, BLNK, and PLCγ, leading to hydrolysis of PI-4,5-P2 by PLCγ. The
  products of this reaction, DAG and IP3, promote the activation of PKC and ultimately
  the nuclear translocation of NFκB transcription factors. This pathway is essential
  for proliferation following antigen recognition. A second outcome of PIP3 production
  is the membrane recruitment of PDK-1 and Akt, with subsequent phosphorylation of
  Akt on two distinct sites by PDK-1 and mTORC2 (mTOR in complex with rictor, see
  Figure ).
