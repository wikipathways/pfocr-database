caption: Schematic illustration of hypothetical pathway leading to the development
  of profibrotic macrophages and invasive fibroblasts in the pathogenesis of pulmonary
  fibrosis (PF). Although multiple cells and mediators are involved in this process,
  implication of CHIT1/CHI3L1 and PD-1/PD-L1 axis are highlighted as major players
  in the development of profibrotic macrophages and invasive fibroblasts/myofibroblasts
  leading to progressive and severe pulmonary fibrosis through suggested heterocellular
  interactions. As indicated, fibrotic macrophages are recruited from the circulatory
  monocytes potentially through CCL2, CHIT1 or CHI3L1 then develops to alternatively
  activated profibrotic macrophages that highly expressing CHIT1, CHI3L1 and TGF-β.
  These mediators synergistically interact to transform resting fibroblasts to myofibroblasts
  with invasive nature through CD44. PD-L1 expressing invasive fibroblasts interact
  with PD-1 (+) T cells that further induce the profibrotic mediators including TGF-β
  and IL-17, that resulted into fibrotic tissue response with excessive extracellular
  matrix (ECM) accumulation. Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, and IL-9) and proinflammatory
  cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-17) from TH2 cells and neutrophils can also contribute
  to profibrotic macrophage activation and subsequent fibroblasts proliferation and
  activation leading to pulmonary fibrosis (The image is created with  BioRender.com
