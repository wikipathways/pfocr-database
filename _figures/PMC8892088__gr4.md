caption: Antitumor roles of ferroptosis in the tumor immune microenvironment.A, immune-stimulatory
  effects of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis agents induce the release of immunogenic damage
  associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as ATP, HMGB1, and exposure of calreticulin
  on cell surface (ecto-CRT) from cancer cells. Early- but not late-stage released/exposed
  DAMPs result in the activation and maturation of professional antigen presenting
  cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells and macrophages, leading to activation of
  cytotoxic T cells. In addition, ferroptotic cells release/expose SAPE-OOH, an oxidized
  phospholipid molecule, which serves as a pro-phagocytic or “eat-me” signal by binding
  to its cognate receptor, TLR2, on macrophages. B, immune-checkpoint activated CD8+
  T cell-mediated ferroptosis of tumor cells. Activated CD8+ T cells secrete IFNγ,
  which binds to interferon receptor on tumor cells activating the JAK/STAT pathway
  and causing the translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 into the nucleus where it
  represses transcription of SLC7A11. The decreased level of the cystine importer
  leads to cysteine depletion, diminished GSH levels, and impaired GPX4 activity.
  Loss of GPX4 activity eventually results in the accumulation of lipid ROS and tumor
  ferroptosis. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ecto-CRT, cell-surface calreticulin; GPX4,
  Glutathione peroxidase 4; GSH, Glutathione; HMGB1, high mobility group box protein

  ROS, reactive oxygen species; SAPE-OOH, oxidized phospholipid, 1-steaoryl-2-15-HpETE-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine;
