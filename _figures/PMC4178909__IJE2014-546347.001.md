caption: Schematic illustration of the role of the VHL elongin BC complex in the HIF1
  pathway in normoxic, hypoxic, and pseudohypoxic conditions. Under normal physiological
  conditions (a), HIF1-α becomes hydroxylated on two prolyl residues. Hydroxylation
  of HIF1-α generates a binding site for the VHL elongin BC complex, consisting of
  elongin B, elongin C, CUL2 or CUL5, RBX1, and VHL, which directs the polyubiquitination
  of HIF1-α and targets it for proteasomal degradation []. In hypoxic conditions (b),
  PHD proteins no longer hydroxylate HIF1-α and VHL cannot add destabilizing ubiquitin
  polymers to HIF1-α. HIF1-α can then heterodimerize with HIF1-β and translocates
  into the nucleus where it binds to hypoxia response elements (HRE) and promotes
  the expression of genes, such as PDK1, PFKL, GLUT1, and VEGF, that mediate the cellular
  response to hypoxic conditions. Similarly, in some cancer types, such as PCC and
  RCC (c), a loss of function event (such as DNA sequence mutation or copy number
  loss) of VHL can result in an upregulation of HIF1-target genes independent of the
  oxygenation status of the tumor cells.
