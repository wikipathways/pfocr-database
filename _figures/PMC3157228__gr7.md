caption: Scheme for changes in the molecular pattern of inflammatory signaling, antigen
  processing, and presentation in attacked myofibers. HLA-I molecules are up-regulated
  in all IBM myofibers. We show the pronounced effect of IFN-γ–induced CIITA on HLA-II
  by a continuous arrow and the relatively small effect of CIITA on HLA-I expression
  (Gobin et al, 1998) as a dotted arrow. However, the effect of CIITA cannot be held
  responsible for the initial IFN-γ–independent and probably ubiquitous HLA-I up-regulation.
  In AIBM, we found up-regulation of IFN-γ pathway components IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. The
  response to IFN-γ explains the up-regulation of IFN-γ–inducible genes, such as STAT1,
  CIITA, PSMB8, and HLA-II, in AIBM.
