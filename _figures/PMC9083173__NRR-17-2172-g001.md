caption: 'Pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy.A chronic hyperglycemic state predisposes
  downstream metabolic processes of AGE/receptor for AGE, polyol pathway activation,
  production of ROS, and the induction of the PKC pathway. The subsequent activation
  of the nuclear factor kappa B, elevation in mitogen-activated protein kinase as
  well as the induction of hexosamine pathway heralds the onset of cytokine-mediated
  pro-inflammatory reactions. Collectively, this culminates in functional and structural
  aberrations of peripheral neuropathy via several established mechanisms – oxidative
  stress to nerve cells induced by ischemia, endothelial microangiopathy, and increased
  neuronal dysfunction. AGE: Advanced glycation end products; ATP: adenosine triphosphotase;
  IL-1β: interleukin-1 beta; Na+/K+ ATPase: sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase;
  NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B; RAGE: receptor for advanced glycation end products;
  TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor alpha.'
