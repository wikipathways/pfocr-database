caption: Hypothesis of possible ISG regulation pathway based on our analyses and findings
  in SLE and LN patients. Various pathogens could infect human cells through the TLR
  family, such as TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6, and activate interferon regulatory factors,
  such as IRF3 and IRF7, which are expressed in PBMCs of SLE patients. IRF3 and IRF7
  may positively regulate expression of interferon and ISGs. Production of interferon
  α may combine with interferon receptors and further promote the expression of ISGs
  and other positive ISG regulation transcription factors, like PLSCR1.
