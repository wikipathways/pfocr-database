caption: A schematic of C/EBP α/β functions in GCs. LH induces ovulation and luteinization
  by activating the cAMP/PKA pathway leading to expression of the EGF-like factors,
  AREG, epiregulin, and betacellulin. These factors then bind the EGFR to activate
  the RAS/ERK½ signaling cascade (, ). The results presented herein show that C/EBPα
  and -β are essential for LH induction of ovulation and luteinzation because they
  mediate specific events downstream of LH, PKA, and ERK½ (, , , ). By generating
  the Cebpa/bgc−/− double-mutant mice, analyzing gene profiling datasets and verifying
  target genes by in vitro approaches, we have identified specific genes that are
  potential targets (direct or indirect) of C/EBPα/β. These genes are involved in
  the formation and maintenance of CL, steroidogensis, and the vascularization of
  ruptured follicles.
