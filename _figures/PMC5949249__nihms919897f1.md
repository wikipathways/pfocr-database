caption: 'Ferroptosis is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Under
  normal conditions, glutathione synthesis axis, consisted of system Xc−-/γ-GCS-GS/GPX4,
  counteracts lipid peroxidation and thus prevents ferroptosis. Ferroptosis inducers
  inhibit the system Xc−-/γ-GCS-GS/GPX4 axis, leading to accumulation of lipid ROS
  (which is generated by the ACSL4/LPCTA3/LOX lipid peroxidation pathway). Transferrin
  receptor-mediated iron transportation and NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy promote
  ferroptosis by sustaining cellular iron availability. Glutamine metabolic pathway,
  glutaminolysis, plays crucial roles in the death process. Glutaminolysis may contribute
  to lipid peroxidation by providing precursors towards fatty acid or lipid synthesis.Abbreviations:
