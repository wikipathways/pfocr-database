caption: 'Schematic representation of canonical and noncanoical TGF‐β signaling pathway
  and targeted therapy in AS (BMP signaling pathway is not shown). The TGF‐β ligands
  are synthesized as a latent complex consisting of TGF‐β homodimer, LAP and LTBP,
  which are stored in ECM. In the canonical pathway, active TGF‐β dimers induce the
  formation of heteromeric complex by sequentially activating TβII and TβI, the heteromeric
  complex then reacts with the downstream Smad proteins, which form into trimeric
  complexes, translocate into nucleus and associate with the SBE, ultimately regulating
  the transcription of fibrosis‐related genes. The therapeutic mechanisms targeting
  this process can be divided into five categories: (1) inhibition of TGF‐β and TβR,
  (2) inhibition of Smad2/3 phosphorylation, (3) inhibition of nuclear translocation,
  (4) inhibition of the transcriptional activity of Smad complexes, and (5) enhancement
  of I‐Smad expression. In the noncanonical pathway, TGF‐β ligands can transmit a
  signal through other signaling pathway, including MAPK pathways and PI3K/Akt pathway.
  Targeting these signaling pathways can become a therapeutic strategy'
