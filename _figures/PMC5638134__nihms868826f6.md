caption: 'Selected Ser and Gly exchange reactions are depicted for the cytoplasmic
  and mitochondrial compartments to illustrate the production of different 2H isotopologues
  of Gly and Ser in  and . For example, the serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT)
  reaction was shown for the cytoplasm (SHMT1) but omitted for the mitochondria (SHMT2)
  [, ]. Blue text blocks depict the de novo synthesis carbon pathway from 13C6-glucose
  while green and beige text blocks respectively depict the hydrogen exchange pathway
  of Gly and Ser via 1-carbon metabolism catalyzed by SHMT1, glycine decarboxylase
  complex (GLDC), and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD). PHGDH: phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase; PSAT1: phosphoserine amino transferase 1; MTHFD2: mitochondrial NAD+-dependent
  methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/methylene tetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase;
  MTHFD2L: mitochondrial NADP+-dependent methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase.'
