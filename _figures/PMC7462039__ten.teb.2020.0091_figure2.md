caption: The interactions of pericytes with endothelial cells. (i) The roles of TGF-β
  pathway. In both pericytes and endothelial cells, TGF-β binds to TGFβR2, which subsequently
  phosphorylates Alk5, activating Smad signaling cascades that play a vital role in
  cell function such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, and expression
  of contractile and ECM proteins. In addition, TGF-β inhibits nitric oxides and promotes
  cell survival. (ii) The role of Notch signaling in pericytes and endothelial cells.
  Notch ligands bind notch, leading to translocation of NICD and the Smad cascade,
  which work synergistically to promote N-cadherin expression, increasing BBB stability.
  (iii) In endothelial cells, VEGF A binds VEGFR, affecting cell survival, proliferation,
  and differentiation. Furthermore, Alk5 works synergistically with Notch signaling
  and Tie2 downstream signals to promote BBB stability. Pericytes directly affect
  this process through Ang1-Tie2 signaling. (iv) Pericytes also secrete vitronectin,
  which interacts with integrin αv, resulting in transcriptional activities. Adapted
  from Sweeney et al. ECM, extracellular matrix; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth
  factor; NICD, Notch intracellular domain. Color images are available online.
