caption: It is generally accepted that Notch signalling integrates multiple pathways,
  thereby tuning downstream expression to match the cell’s current needs and situation.
  This could be considered to resemble a processor on a circuit board, integrating
  inputs from various computing processes and directing output to appropriate hardware
  to generate a coordinated response. a | A representative sample of the various ‘inputs’,
  which include Notch ligands and input through crosstalking pathways, is shown (top
  part). The ability of a cell to receive input is regulated by the availability of
  the Notch receptor (not shown) and ligands, and by post-translational modification
  of both the receptor and ligands by fringe family proteins — such modification results
  in some Notch ligands being activating and others inhibiting. Input capacity is
  further modulated by intracellular ‘accessory pathway’ components and cofactors,
  such as deltex, neuralized (NEUR) and mastermind-like proteins (MAMLs), and extracellular
  inhibitors, all of which can bias Notch activation in one cell of the signalling
  pair. The output of Notch signalling (a representative sample of the currently identified
  ‘outputs’ is shown; bottom part) results from both canonical Notch signalling (activation
  of genes whose expression is regulated by recombining binding protein suppressor
  of hairless (RBPJ)-dependent Notch signalling) and presumably non-canonical Notch
  signalling mechanisms. However, data on non-canonical signalling are limited. The
  output depends in part on the Notch pathways that are available in a given cell
  type and in part on the combination of inputs. b | In neural stem cells (NSCs),
  for example, Notch integrates growth factor (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF)) signalling with input from key stem
  pathways, such as sonic hedgehog (SHH) and WNT, to promote expression of genes that
  maintain stemness and self-renewal. c | In mature neurons, in which SHH has a less
  prominent role, Notch may integrate WNT, neurotrophin and NF-κB signalling to modulate
  synaptic complexity and survival. Most of the input and key pathways that interact
  with Notch in mature neurons are unknown (shown by dashed lines), as are the downstream
  effectors. Probable candidates include neurotrophins (for example, brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF)), activity-dependent modulators of synaptic and structural
  plasticity (for example, NF-κB), as well as effectors of cytoskeletal rearrangement
  (for example, RAS-related C3 botulinum toxin (RAC) proteins and β-catenin). Inputs
  that inhibit Notch signalling are shown in purple, and inputs that potentiate Notch
  signalling are shown in yellow. Inputs and outputs that play a less prominent part
  in a given stage are shown in grey with open circles. ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
