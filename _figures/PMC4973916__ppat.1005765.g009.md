caption: 'The glycolytic intermediates, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate (DHAP), and phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) are imported into the apicoplast by the apicoplast phosphate transporter (APT)
  and converted to glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) and acetyl-CoA, respectively. Acetyl-CoA
  is used by the FASII to generate, predominantly, C12 and C14 FA chains, which are
  transferred to G3P by TgATS1 to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). These LPA species
  are exported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by an as yet unidentified transport
  system to generate bulk PC, PI and PE (shown as head groups with C, I and E, respectively).
  All PC, PI and PE species could then be elongated by elongase enzymes (ELO) before
  being exported to contribute to general parasite membrane biogenesis. Note: PI may
  also me assembled by PI synthase outside of the ER, most likely in the Golgi apparatus.'
