caption: '(A) Predicted cell-specific net metabolite uptake rates in coculture. (B)
  Predicted cell-specific reaction rates in coculture, for acs (acetyl-CoA synthesis),
  ack (acetate synthesis), pta (acetyl phosphate synthesis), ppc (oxaloacetate synthesis
  from phosphoenolpyruvate), pdh (decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA) and pyk
  (pyruvate synthesis from phosphoenolpyruvate). Rates in (A) and (B) are averaged
  over all time points within the first 100 days of evolution, with reversed reactions
  or net metabolite export represented by negative rates. (C) and (D): Simplified
  model subset of E. coli acetate and glucose metabolism, showing pathway activations
  in type SS (C) and FS (D) relative to type A during exponential growth in monoculture.
  Non-bracketed numeric values are ratios of predicted fluxes in the evolved types
  over fluxes in type A. Bracketed values are ratios of mRNA harvested from monoculture
  experiments by , for comparison. A ratio of 0/0 indicates zero flux in both the
  evolved and ancestral type, a ratio of 1 corresponds to an unchanged flux or mRNA,
  a ratio of 0 corresponds to complete deactivation in the evolved type. Darker arrows
  indicate increased predicted fluxes in the evolved type. Flux predictions correspond
  to the time points of mRNA measurements, that is, 3.5 hr after dilution for SS and
  4 hr after dilution for A and SS ().DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08208.010'
