caption: 'Schematic illustrating the systemic effects of an aberrant circulatory metabolism
  reflecting PAD progression in serum that also reflects the localized ischemia of
  skeletal muscle in lower limbs. Reduced serum lysine, an inhibitor of plasmin activation,
  in pathological states, leads to excessive proteolysis and vascular tissue degradation
  that is exacerbated by elevated TMAO, further promoting atherosclerosis in CLTI.
  Serum oxoproline, a key precursor used in the glutathione (GSH) salvage pathway,
  decreases in circulation as it is transported within the muscle to support intracellular
  glutathione recycling in response to elevated oxidative stress as reflected by lower
  histidine, and higher cystine in serum. Reduced creatine availability leads to lower
  intramuscular phosphocreatine, attributing to myopathic ischemia and perturbed energy
  homeostasis within the muscle that coincides with elevated creatinine concentrations
  in serum for CLTI. Impaired mitochondrial beta-oxidation is reflected by higher
  circulating carnitine and propionylcarnitine, that are not stored within ischemic
  muscle tissue in conjunction with lower circulating lipids/fatty acids, such as
  stearic acid and linoleic acid. Lastly, increased serum phenylacetylglutamine and
  Phe/Tyr reflect increased inflammation in CLTI, which are risk factors for all-causes
  mortality and cardiovascular disease. Abbreviations correspond to ROS: reactive
  oxygen species, ADP: adenosine diphosphate, ATP: adenosine triphosphate, Crt K:
  creatine kinase, Crt Tr: creatine transporter, Plsgen: plasminogen, Plsn: plasmin.'
