caption: Model for the regulation of Salmonella biofilm formation by the Rcs phosphorelay
  pathway. In this model, when the Rcs system is off, the unphosphorylated form of
  RcsB induces the expression of CsgD. The ensuing CsgD induces the expressions of
  genes encoding curli fimbriae and the diguanylate cyclase AdrA. The accumulation
  of AdrA enhances the levels of the secondary messenger c-di-GMP, which activates
  the synthesis of cellulose and biases flagellar rotation toward the counterclockwise
  direction through binding to YcgR (). When the Rcs system is on, the levels of phosphorylated
  RcsB increase, leading to the repression of CsgD in a mechanism partially dependent
  on the small noncoding RNA RprA. Moreover, the flagellar master genes flhDC and
  some genes required for the intestinal phase of infection are repressed, whereas
  genes involved in the synthesis of the colanic acid capsule and factors required
  for persistent infection are upregulated.
