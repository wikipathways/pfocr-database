  diphosphate-fucose synthesis, Golgi transport and attachment of core fucose to N-linked
  glycoproteins. Proteins are designated by the symbols of the genes that encode them
  (bold). The more dominant de novo synthesis pathway is shown at the bottom, the
  salvage pathway is at the top. Diagram is based on previous studies[,]. GDP: Guanosine
