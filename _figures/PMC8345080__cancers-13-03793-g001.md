caption: Epigenetic and genetic regulation of the OPN promoter in CRC. The regulation
  of the osteopontin expression is complex and involves both genetic and epigenetic
  mechanisms such as promoter methylation, as well as different protein complexes
  acting on the histones and thereby regulating the compaction of chromatin within
  the SIBLING gene cluster. The osteopontin promoter also contains numerous binding
  sites for transcription factors that act in coordination to regulate the transcriptional
  activity. Some are known to be connected to important CRC signaling pathways, particularly
  the Wnt pathway, as well as the TGFβ pathway and the Hedgehog pathway. The pre-messenger
  is also subject to alternative splicing generating different isoforms and contains
  an alternative initiation site leading to the formation of a shorter protein. Osteopontin
  may be intracellular (nucleus, cytoplasm, and secretory vesicle) or extracellular
  following secretion. Osteopontin is believed to play a role in the liver both as
  a matrix protein and as a cytokine mediating signaling between tumor cells, as well
  as between cells in the tumor environment, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which also secrete osteopontin.
