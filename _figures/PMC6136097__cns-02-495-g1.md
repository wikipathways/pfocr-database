caption: 'The deregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways leads to aberrant
  intracellular signaling, including the PI3K pathway, that, among other effects,
  induces the transcription of genes responsible for sustaining several cancer hallmarks
  (e.g., HOX genes). Loss of PTEN function by mutation or loss of heterozygosity has
  been correlated with poor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patient survival. MGMT expression
  and promoter methylation levels are markers of GBM patient prognosis. Mut IDH1R132H
  and IDH2R172K enzymes are able to convert α-KG into 2-HG, and GBM patients with
  tumors presenting IDH mutations have longer survival. Deregulation of several miRNAs
  has been implicated in both the initiation and progression of GBM, and many have
  been reported to present prognostic value. YKL-40 is produced by GBM cells and released
  into the serum, where its levels are predictive of an aggressive phenotype and associated
  with poor overall patient survival. Mut H3F3AK27M is highly specific to pediatric
  GBM, and associates with worse prognosis in these patients. Green and orange boxes
  indicate loss or increased function, respectively. Blue boxes indicate mut IDHs
  and H3F3A.2-HG: 2-Hydroxyglutarate; α-KG: α-ketoglutarate; Mut: Mutant; RTK: Receptor
  tyrosine kinase.'
