caption: 'Proposed pathomechanisms of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in COVID-19 infection:
  direct and indirect pathways involving endothelial dysfunction. (A) Direct pathway:
  SARS-CoV-2 invasion of endothelial cells through ACE2 receptors may lead to endothelial
  cell death, vessel dysfunction, and rupture. Downregulation of ACE2 receptors may
  increase angiotensin II levels, resulting in hypertension and increased ICH risk.
  (B) Indirect pathway: SARS-CoV-2 interaction with endothelial ACE2 receptors leads
  to cytokine and chemokine release. This inflammatory response can interrupt tight
  junctions within the blood–brain barrier, increasing ICH risk. In addition to the
  direct and indirect pathways, ICH risk is increased by other risk factors such as
  anticoagulation, ICU admission, consumptive coagulopathy, and preexisting comorbidities.
