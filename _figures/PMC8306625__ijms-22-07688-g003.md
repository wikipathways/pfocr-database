caption: ROS generation mediated by NLRPs and their roles in regulating NLRP inflammasome
  activation. NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP6, and NLRP12 inflammasome are involved in ROS generation.
  Among them, the NLRP2, NLRP6, and NLRP12 inflammasomes are negative regulators for
  ROS generation, and the NLRP2 inflammasome mediates ROS generation through activating
  Nrf2 signaling. NLRP3 acts both upstream and downstream of ROS in an inflammasome-dependent
  as well as an inflammasome-independent pathway. On the one hand, ROS activation
  of NLRP3 inflammasomes have been demonstrated to associate with mROS and DAMP/PAMP
  induced ROS. On the other hand, inflammasome-independent NLRP3 regulates mROS in
  cardiac fibroblast under TGF-β1 stimulation and plays important role in mROS production
  by binding to MAVS in renal tubular cells.
