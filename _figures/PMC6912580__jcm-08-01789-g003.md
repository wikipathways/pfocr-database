  results in phosphorylation of CREB, and the CREB-mediated neuronal survival effect
  []. BDNF: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; TRKB: Tropomyosin receptor kinase B;

  PDK1: 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin;
  Akt: Protein Kinase B; Bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma 2; CREB: Cyclic AMP response element
  binding protein.'
