caption: 'The impact of metformin on cancer-related signaling pathways via AMPK activation.
  AMPK activation by metformin disrupts key cancer-related signaling pathways, leading
  to inhibition of tumor growth and proliferation. AMPK deactivates the mTOR signaling
  pathway through phosphorylation and degradation mechanisms, inhibiting proteins
  such as p70S6K and 4E-BP1 involved in mRNA translation, thereby limiting cancer
  cell proliferation. Additionally, AMPK reduces phosphorylation of IRS-1, impairing
  signal transmission from IRs and IGF-1Rs, which disrupts the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  axis. In breast cancer, AMPK activation supports the survival of dormant ER+ tumor
  cells under low-estrogen conditions. In ovarian cancer, AMPK influences the AMPK/GSK3β
  axis, triggering cyclin D1 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system,
  resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. AMPK activation also promotes the
  production of ROS and induces apoptosis, which collectively hinder tumor growth
