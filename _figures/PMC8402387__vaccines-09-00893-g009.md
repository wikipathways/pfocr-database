caption: Conceptualized activity of the RTCD-bound CPP-HuscFv11 in the HIV-1 infectious
  cycle. (1) The CPP-HuscFv11 is delivered intracellularly via the endocytic pathway;
  the transbodies escape into infected cell cytoplasm (CPP function). (2) The antibody
  recognizes its target, which is (3) reverse transcriptase connection domain (RTCD)
  in Gag-Pol polyprotein at the plasma membrane. (4) The antibody is trapped in the
  budded virion through the virus assembly pathway. (5) The antibody in the virion
  prevents virion maturation by interfering with Gag-Pol homodimerization (via RTCD)
  which hinders virus protease (PR) activation, leaving the immature virus non-infectious
  (6).
