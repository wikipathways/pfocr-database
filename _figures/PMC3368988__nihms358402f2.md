caption: A schematic representation of sites of PP2A activity within the network of
  ERK activation. Ligand-mediated activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) at
  the plasma membrane leads to activation of the classical Ras/Raf/MEK kinase pathway
  leading to phosphorylation of ERK (pathway components shown in white, activating
  phosphorylations indicated with a black arrow). Individual heterotrimeric PP2A complexes
  (shown in grey) containing the catalytic subunit (PP2aC), scaffolding subunit (PR65)
  and differing regulatory subunits are spatially separated within the network based
  upon specific interaction between network components and each regulatory subunit.
  The activating de-phosphorylation of network components by PP2aC is indicated by
  a grey arrow and inhibitory de-phosphorylation by a blunt ended grey arrow.
