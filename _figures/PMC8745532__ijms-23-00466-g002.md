caption: 'Working models for flowering-time regulation in soybean under long day (LD)
  and short day (SD). (A) Flowering-time regulation of soybean in LDs. Under LD, E3
  and E4 upregulate the expression of E1, E1Lb, E2, GmPRR3a and GmPRR3b. E1 promotes
  the expression of the floral inhibitors GmFT1a and GmFT4, but inhibits the expression
  of the floral promoters GmFT2a and GmFT5a, and thus the transition to flowering
  is greatly delayed in LDs. GmFT2a and GmFT5a interact with GmFDL19 to induce the
  expression of AP1a, SOC1 and LFY, whereas GmFT1a and GmFT4 function to inhibit the
  expression of these floral promoters to delay flowering. GmPRR3a and GmPRR3b repress
  GmLHYs expression through binding to their promoter. GmLHYs bind to the E1 promoter
  to repress E1 expression. The inhibition of E1 expression by GmLHYs is released
  by the induction of GmPRR3a and GmPRR3b. GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b are soybean flowering
  inhibitors and repress GmFT2a and GmFT5a expression, and there is a feedback regulation
  among GmCOL1a, E1 and E2. E3 and E4 promote the expression of E2. GmTOE4a delays
  flowering by inhibiting the expression of GmFT2a, GmFT5a, GmSPL3/9 and miR172, and
  promoting the expression of miR156, GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b. miR172 negatively feedback
  regulates its target gene GmTOE4a. GmTOE4a participates in the flowering-regulation
  pathway that requires E3 and E4. (B) Flowering induction of soybean in SDs. Under
  SDs, E3 and E4 play a limited role, and E1 expression is also suppressed; hence,
  the inhibition of GmFT2a/GmFT5a and the induction of GmFT1a /GmFT4 by E1 both are
  weakened; therefore, flowering is strongly promoted. The expression of E1/E1L is
  repressed by GmLHYs and GmELF3. GmELF3 and GmLHYs act additively to control E1 expression.
  GmELF3 is suppressed by two PHYA proteins, E3 and E4. As the functions of E3 and
  E4 are greatly weakened under SDs, the inhibition of GmELF3 is released. The GmELF3
  protein interacts with GmLUX1 and GmLUX2 to form the evening complex of GmELF3-GmLUX1-GmLUX2.
  In short, the two molecular regulatory modules: GmELF3/GmLUX1/GmLUX2 -E1/E1L-FT
  and GmLHYs-E1/E1L-FT, function to induce soybean flowering in SDs.'

  description: 'Working models for flowering-time regulation in soybean under long

    Under LD, E3 and E4 upregulate the expression of E1, E1Lb, E2, GmPRR3a and GmPRR3b.
    E1 promotes the expression of the floral inhibitors GmFT1a and GmFT4, but inhibits

    and GmPRR3b repress GmLHYs expression through binding to their promoter. GmLHYs
    bind to the E1 promoter to repress E1 expression. The inhibition of E1 expression
    by GmLHYs is released by the induction of GmPRR3a and GmPRR3b. GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b
    are soybean flowering inhibitors and repress GmFT2a and GmFT5a expression, and
    there is a feedback regulation among GmCOL1a, E1 and E2. E3 and E4 promote the
