caption: T cell metabolic programs that link to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
  and the de novo synthesis of GSH. Pyruvate that is derived from glucose via glycolysis
  is shuttled to the mitochondria and drives the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and
  fuels oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Glucose-derived glucose-6-phosphate feeds
  into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and produces NADPH in the cytoplasm. In
  addition, glutamate feeds the TCA cycle through α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to fuel OXPHOS
  and generate ROS. Excessive ROS production is regulated by glutathione (GSH), a
  tripeptide of glutamine, cysteine, and glycine, which is synthesized de novo by
  glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) and glutathione synthetase (GSS). In addition, NADPH,
  glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) are involved
  in regenerating GSH from glutathione disulfide (GSSG), whereas thioredoxin reductase
  (TXNRD) is responsible for the regeneration of thioredoxin (TXN) to control oxidative
  stress in T cell.
