caption: The gut microbiota interacts with the mammalian epigenome by generating epigenetic
  substrates or acting as regulators for chromatin-modifying enzymes. a, DNA methylation
  and histone methylation. DNA methylation is generally linked with repression of
  transcription initiation at promoters. Folate produced from Lactobacillus, bifidobacterium
  can synthesize methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) by the folate and methionine
  cycles to DNA/histone (a) methylation and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) (f). b, histone
  acetylation. Extracellular short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) enter colon cells via
  monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) and sodium-dependent monocarboxylate transporters
  (SMCTs). SCFAs can influence acetylation, deacetylation and crotonylation (f) of
  histone via inhibiting the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Acetyl-CoA
  and acyl-CoA derived from SCFAs metabolism can be utilized for histone acetylation.
  c, non-coding RNAs. Gut microbiota can influence the expression of non-coding RNAs,
  in turn, alterations of non-coding RNAs can also impact the abundance of gut microbiota.
  d, histone lactylation. Lactate is transported across the plasma membrane by monocarboxylate
  transporters (MCTs). Acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACCS2) and lysine acetyltransferase
  2A (KAT2A) function as lactyl-CoA synthetase and lactyltransferase, whereas HDACs
  or SIRT function as erasers. e, histone crotonylation. Butyrate and crotonate are
  metabolized into crotonyl-CoA by butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (BCDH) and ACCS2, respectively,
  which promotes lysine crotonylation (kcr) of histone. f, m6A. Butyrate enters the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce the intermediate α-KG, which contributes
  to RNA demethylation. Bile acids and vitamin B12 can influence the expression of
  the alkb dioxygenase family. Additionally, gut microbiota can regulate FTO expression
  through the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway. AMP-activated protein kinase, AMPK; CBP,
