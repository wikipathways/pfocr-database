caption: Ovarian cancer stem cells and macrophages reciprocally interact through the
  Wnt pathway to promote a pro-tumoral microenvironment. Our data suggests that in
  hetero-spheroids, CSCs drive a CD206+ expressing macrophage phenotype, suggestive
  of pro-tumoral M2 activation through secretion of the immuno-suppressive cytokine
  IL-10, and through WNT ligands. We also observe that macrophage-derived WNT ligands,
  specifically WNT5B, and to some extent the pro-tumoral cytokine IL-6, drive an enrichment
  in ALDH+ cells within hetero-spheroids. Knockdown of macrophage WNT5B expression,
  or inhibiting downstream activation of IL-6 using Ruxolitinib or sc144, result in
  a significant loss of ALDH+ populations within hetero-spheroids. Importantly, we
  find that the Wnt pathway is involved bi-directionally in CSC-macrophage interactions,
  and can potentially be targeted to reduce stemness, chemoresistance, invasiveness
  and immunosuppression in ovarian cancer
