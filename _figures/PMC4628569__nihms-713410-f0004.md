caption: The major mechanisms of IL-27-induced suppression of arthritic inflammation
  shown in the figure are derived from multiple studies described in the main text.
  IL-27 acts on APCs and decreases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines- IL-1β,
  IL-6 and IL-23. IL-27 can directly inhibit Th17 differentiation as well as indirectly
  inhibit Th17 response by increasing Th1 (IFN-γ) response. Furthermore, IL-27 can
  increase Treg and IL-10 production, and thereby alter Th17/Treg ratio in favor of
  immune regulation. IL-27 acts on fibroblasts and other cell types and inhibits the
  production of MMPs and VEGF, leading to reduced angiogenesis. In addition, IL-27
  decreases the production of RANKL from T cells and other cells, and inhibits RANKL/RANK
  pathway of osteoclast generation. The outcome of these actions of IL-27 is reduced
  arthritic inflammation. (Induction is shown as a green upward arrow, while inhibition
  or blockade is shown as a ‘T’. A direct influence is shown as straight line arrow,
  whereas an indirect influence is shown as a dashed line arrow. APCs, antigen presenting
  cells; MMPs, matrix metalloproteases; RANK, receptor activator for nuclear factor
  κB; RANKL, RANK ligand; and VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. (*) indicates
  similar direction of change in all cytokines or bone mediators indicated therein.)
