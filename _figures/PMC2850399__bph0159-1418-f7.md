caption: The mevalonate pathway and the pleiotropic effects of statins. Statins exert
  pleiotropic effects, via the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. This figure was summarized
  from previous reports (; ; ). Mevalonate, a product of HMG-CoA reductase, produces
  several isoprenoids in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. These isoprenoids associate
  with proteins and modify their functions. Geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (geranylgeranyl-pp),
  an isoprenoid derived from cholesterol synthesis, is formed from isopentenylpyrophosphate
  (isopentenyl-pp) and farnesylpyrophosphate (farnesyl-pp). Geranylgeranyl-pp and
  farnesyl-pp are associated with the C-terminal motif of several small G proteins
  such as those in the Rho, Rac, Rab and Ras families, and regulate their functions.
  This pathway is called the ‘mevalonate pathway’ and plays significant roles in the
  biological functions of cells in several organs. Depletion of mevalonic acid via
  inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins leads to depletion of geranyl-pp and
  farnesyl-pp. Depletion of geranyl-pp in turn decreases the synthesis of gernylgeranyl-pp.
  Finally, depletion of farnesyl-pp and geranylgeranyl-pp decrease the isoprenylation
  of small G proteins and thus decrease their activation and their functions. HMG-CoA,
  developed 3-hydroxyl-3methylglutaryl coenzyme A; GGTase, geranylgeranyltransferase
  I; FTase, farnesyltransferase.
