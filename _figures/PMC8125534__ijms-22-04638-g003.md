caption: The network of E3 ligases and their targets involved in ABA signaling. E3
  ligases are shown in orange, and their targets in ABA signaling pathway are colored
  according to target protein function (receptors in gray, PP2C phosphatases in green,
  transcription factors in blue, and other related components in terracotta). Different
  groups of target proteins are also shaded and labeled. Activation is shown by arrows,
  and inhibition by T-shaped bars. Black lines show interactions between proteins,
  while blue lines denote transcriptional control. The references are provided in
  .
