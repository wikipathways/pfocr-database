caption: Circadian regulation of drug response in mental disorders. The figure visually
  represents the circadian regulations of the components of five key signaling pathways
  of the brain that are frequently targeted by the majority of mental disorder drugs
  (FDR <0.05, fold enrichment >2.5, count >5). The rhythmicity symbols specify the
  transcript level rhythmicity (JTK Q < 0.1, period 24 ± 3 h) of that component in
  the particular signaling pathway. (A)The neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction
  pathway encompasses G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for neurotransmitters such
  as dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and acetylcholine, along with downstream effectors
  like calcium ion channels, cAMP, cGMP, PKA, and PKG. The downstream signaling cascades
  are displayed in panels (B–E), which play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of
  various psychiatric disorders by affecting gene expression, neuronal excitability,
  responses, and synaptic plasticity (Perez and Tardito, 2001; Reierson et al., 2011;
  Nakao et al., 2021). These pathways are closely intertwined and form a complex signaling
  network. A partial view of these interconnected pathways encompassing several rhythmic
  drug targets is depicted here. The complete pathway diagrams with rhythmic drug
  targets are shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Signaling pathways impacted by mental
  disorder drugs were retrieved from the DAVID database (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/).
  The rhythmicity of each component involved was investigated using the CircaDB database
  (http://circadb.hogeneschlab.org/). Created with BioRender.com
