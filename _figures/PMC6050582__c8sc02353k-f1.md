caption: . Engineering the auxin pathway for the development of a chemically induced
  proximity method. By engineering TIR1 to disrupt the association of TIR1 with a
  SCF protein complex, the auxin-induced protein degradation capability is abolished
  while the auxin-induced dimerization of TIR1 and AID remains unaffected.
