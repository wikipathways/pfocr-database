caption: A simplified TGFβ pathway leading to p21 expression. While p21 can be expressed
  through different pathways such as these, it is important to quantify which pathways
  affect p21 expression and activation the most in the RIBE response. This pathway
  is intrinsically connected to the TNFα, MAPK, and cell cycle pathways as an endpoint
  for intracellular signalling.
