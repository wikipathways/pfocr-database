caption: Generic illustration of the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway and main enzymatic
  complexes involved in the re-oxidation of reduced electron carriers, i.e. FADH,
  NADH and ferredoxin (Fd) and energy conservation in SPOB. Numbers 1–11 indicate
  the different steps of the pathways (see , , for details of the enzymes); (1) propionate-CoA
  transferase/acetate-CoA ligase; (2) methylmalonyl-CoA carboxyltransferase; (3) methylmalonyl-CoA
  epimerase; (4) methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; (5) succinyl-CoA synthetase; (6) succinate
  dehydrogenase; (7) fumarate hydratase; (8) malate dehydrogenase; (9) pyruvate carboxylase;
  (10) pyruvate-ferredoxin reductase and (11) acetate-CoA ligase Red arrows indicate
  steps putatively missing in Ca. Cloacimonetes. Dashed (orange and blue) arrows indicate
  putative reactions. Solid orange arrows indicate reactions that are putatively interconnected.
  [NiFe] and [FeFe] H2ase refer to [NiFe] and [FeFe] hydrogenase, respectively. SDH—succinate
  dehydrogenase, FDH—formate dehydrogenase, FdhC—formate transporter, MctC—propionate
  transporter, Rnf—ferredoxin:NADH reductase, Nfn—ferredoxin-dependent transhydrogenase
  and PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim)—a signaling domain that acts as molecular sensor. ΔG0` values
  were calculated for pH 7 (see , , for details of compounds involved in each reaction).
  Putative enzymatic complexes were identified based on the studies cited in the main
  text. To simplify the image, no separate subunits are visualized for the multimeric
  enzymes. D.thc—D. thermocisternus, D.thb—D. thermobenzoicussubsp.thermosyntrophicus,
  P.p—P. propionicicum, P.s—P. schinkii, P.t—P. thermopropionicum, S.f—S. fumaroxidans,
  Ca.C.a—Ca. Cloacamonas acidaminovorans, Ca.S.a—Ca. Syntrophopropionicum ammoniitolerans
  and Ca. S.t—Ca. Syntrophosphaera thermopropionivorans. 1This enzyme is a putative
  non-bifurcating and NADH-dependent only [FeFe] hydrogenase in Ca. Cloacimonetes
  (Losey et al. ). 2All syntrophic propionate-oxidising bacteria analysed possess
  in their genome genes encoding [FeFe] hydrogenases from the group B/C, but a PAS
  domian has been predicted only in the case of mesophilic bacteria belonging to the
  Peptococcaceae.
