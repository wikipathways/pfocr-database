caption: (A) IPA gene interaction network prediction diagram of differential genes.
  The prognostic genes ASNS and CEBPA are circled in red. Red represents up regulation
  and green represents down regulation. (B) The local interaction pathway diagram
  predicted by the IPA interaction network. The solid line represents the existing
  work verification, and the dash line represents the prediction. (C) The downstream
  genes of CEBPA. The blue arrow indicates inhibition.
