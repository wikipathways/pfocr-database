caption: Main metabolic pathways related to xylitol production in filamentous fungi
  and yeasts. Xylose is sequentially converted into xylitol, xylulose, and xylulose‐5
  phosphate by xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase, and xylulokinase, respectively,
  and then enters the pentose phosphate pathway in the form of xylose‐5 phosphate.
  The NADPH needed for xylose reduction is mainly generated from the glucose metabolism
  through the pentose phosphate pathway.
