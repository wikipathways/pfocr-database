caption: 'The colored bars represent the percentage of the transcripts in each bin
  (re-annotated to MapMan classification) whether up-regulated (red) or down-regulated
  (blue) under PEG or NaCl treatment in different cotton tissues. A: represents the
  differential expression transcripts related to auxin (IAA) signalling transduction
  pathway. B: represents the differential expression transcripts related to cytokinin
  (CK) signalling transduction pathway. C: represents the differential expression
  transcripts related to gibberellin (GA) signalling transduction pathway. D: represents
  the differential expression transcripts related to abscisic acid (ABA) signalling
  transduction pathway. E: represents the differential expression transcripts related
  to ethylene signalling transduction pathway. F: represents the differential expression
  transcripts related to brassinosteroid (BR) signalling transduction pathway. G:
  represents the differential expression transcripts related to jasmonate (JA) signalling
  transduction pathway. H: represents the differential expression transcripts related
  to salycylic acid (SA) signalling transduction pathway.'
