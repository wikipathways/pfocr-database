caption: (A) Predicted effects of BOSB consumption on atherosclerosis-related metabolic
  pathways; (B) Integration of the main BOSB-regulated systemic pathways associated
  to neuropeptide regulation, lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis signaling. This
  figure was generated with BioRender.com. (1) The atherosclerosis pathway initiates
  with LDL deposition and monocyte recruitment to the endothelial barrier mediated
  by MCP-1 and CCR2. (2) After monocyte rolling mediated by E-selectin and receptor
  ESL-1, (3) the lower levels of VCAM-1 found in the microarray analysis, and predicted
  reductions in plasma LDL levels, reduce endothelial cell adhesion. (4) Lower predicted
  LDL also inhibits CCR-2 expression and MCP-1 mediated trans endothelial migration
  of monocytes into the intima. It is known that ROS and oxidized-LDL uptake via scavenger
  receptors leads to lipid accumulation and foam cell formation that secrete a number
  of inflammatory cytokines. (5) Reduced M-CSF levels inhibit monocyte-to-macrophage
  differentiation, (6) as well as a decreased LDL migration into the intima and inhibition
  of CD36/IL-8RA. (7) This has a predicted effect on TNFRSF14 which may inhibit the
  NF-kB pathway and the downstream production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-3, MCP-1,
  TNF, IL-1, IL6), as well as TNF and matrix metalloproteases, involved also in inflammation
  processes and in atherosclerosis onset. (8) Finally, reduction observed for PDGF
  and TGF-β inhibits exacerbated collagen production via the CD40 receptor found in
  the surface of foam cells and T-lymphocytes, that may act via IFN-γ. Collagens constitute
  a component of the extracellular matrix in the atherosclerotic plaque.
