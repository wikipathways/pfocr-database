caption: Signaling pathways of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), cGAS, and AIM2-like receptors
  (ALRs). RLRs recognize dsRNA and activate MAVS, while cGAS recognizes dsDNA and
  activates STING. Activated MAVS and STING commonly stimulate TBK1 and IKK for production
  of type I/III interferons (IFNs) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. As with cGAS,
  ALRs also recognize dsDNA, but the ligand engagement leads to assembly of inflammasomes,
  which include receptors, adaptor ASC and effector caspase-1. Within the assembled
  inflammasome, caspase-1 cleaves IL-1β, IL-18, and gasdermin D, which results maturation
  of the inflammatory cytokines and induction of pyroptosis. IFI16 was also reported
  to activate the interferon pathway through STING, albeit through a poorly understood
  mechanism.
