caption: 'Diagram of the canonical steroidogenesis process in LCs. The steroidogenic
  signaling of ALCs are triggered by LH. LH binds to the LHCGR and activates adenylyl
  cyclase, resulting in the increase of cAMP concentration and cAMP-dependent phosphorylation
  of proteins through PKA. Cholesterol then is transferred into mitochondria and converted
  to pregnenolone by CYP11A1. In rodent model, the pregnenolone is mainly metabolized
  into progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone by HSD3B1, CYP17A1, and HSD17B3,
  respectively, in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (named Δ4 pathway). In human,
  the pregnenolone is mainly metabolized into dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenediol,
  androstenedione, and testosterone by HSD3B2, CYP17A1, and HSD17B3, respectively
  (named Δ5 pathway). The yellow and blue arrows represent the Δ5 pathway and Δ4 pathway,
  respectively. AC: adenylyl cyclase; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; LCs: Leydig cells;
  cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CYP11A1: cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome
  P450 enzyme; CYP17A1: cytochrome P450 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase; Gs: G proteins;
