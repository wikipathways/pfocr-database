caption: Proposed alternative pathway of feto-placental androgen synthesis from 17-hydroxypregnenolone.
  The lower-left corner represents the conventional pathway of androgen synthesis
  requiring sequential side-chain removal, oxidation by 3β, 17-keto reduction by 17βHSD
  and finally 5α-reduction terminating in DHT. The alternative pathway (upper right
  corner) starts with the formation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and its reduction to
  5α-pregnane-3α,17α-diol-20-one. In spite of attenuated 17,20-lyse activity due to
  POR deficiency this steroid can be converted to androsterone and likely on to DHT
