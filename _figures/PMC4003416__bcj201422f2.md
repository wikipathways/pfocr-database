caption: Targets of Twist proteins in the DNA damage response pathway. In healthy
  conditions, DNA damage triggers the activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated
  (ATM) and ATR kinases that usually results in activation of p53, of its transcriptional
  targets cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (CIP/WAF1, CDKN1A) and/or Bax, and
  ultimately leads to senescence or apoptosis. DNA damage can also induce the cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor p16 (INK4A) and the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma (Rb) that will
  further stabilize senescence cell cycle arrest. p14ARF might also come into play
  during the DNA damage response and is additionally induced by cellular stresses
  such as oncogene signaling and replication stress. p14ARF is an upstream regulator
  of p53 that acts through repression of p53-inhibitor MDM2. Myc transcription factor
  family members promote cell growth and proliferation, but might at the same time
  induce p53-dependent (through p14ARF) and -independent apoptosis. In cancer cells
  where Twist1 or Twist2 expression is increased, they neutralize senescence and cell
  death through inhibition of both p53 and Rb tumor-suppressor pathways. Twist1–2
  repress senescence through binding to E-boxes in the regulatory region of p21 and
  p16. They might also inhibit the expression of p14ARF. Furthermore, Twist1 is able
  to block the Myc-induced apoptotic response through modulation of the p14ARF–MDM2–p53
  pathway. Conversely, they increase cellular proliferation and trigger resistance
  to chemotherapy through the upregulation of AKT2 and YB-1 and the activation of
  the antiapoptotic NF-κB response.
