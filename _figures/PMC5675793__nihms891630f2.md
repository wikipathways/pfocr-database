caption: The protective role of the FOXO pathway in aging and AD pathogenesis. Briefly,
  FOXO could be phosphorylated by distinct kinase(s), acetylated or de-acetylated
  by SIRT and p300, respectively. Where indicated, red arrow indicates positive regulation
  and black line implicates negative regulation.
