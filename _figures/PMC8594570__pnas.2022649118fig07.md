caption: The hizr-1/HZA pathway promotes high zinc detoxification, the pcs-1/phytochelatin
  pathway promotes cadmium detoxification, and the mek-1/sek-1 kinase pathway promotes
  both high zinc and cadmium detoxification. (A) Molecular model of the transcriptional
  response to cadmium. Dietary cadmium (Cd) enters intestinal cells, binds the ligand-binding
  domain of HIZR-1, and promotes nuclear accumulation, HZA enhancer binding, and transcriptional
  activation of hizr-1–dependent genes. Cadmium activates transcription of additional
  genes independent of HIZR-1 by an undefined mechanism. (B) HIZR-1 can directly bind
  zinc, and the Zn/HIZR-1 complex activates cdf-2 and ttm-1 to promote zinc detoxification.
  Cadmium can also directly bind HIZR-1, and the Cd/HIZR-1 complex also activates
  cdf-2 and ttm-1. pcs-1 promotes formation of phytochelatin, which can directly bind
  cadmium, leading to cadmium detoxification. The mek-1/sek-1 pathway can promote
  both high zinc and cadmium detoxification. The dotted line from HIZR-1 to mtl-1
  mtl-2 indicates that this pathway may promote cadmium detoxification in a manner
  redundant with pcs-1.
