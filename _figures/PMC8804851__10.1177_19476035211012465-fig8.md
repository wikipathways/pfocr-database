caption: Schematic of the proposed mechanism for the shockwave-induced increase in
  extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in chondrocytes. Shockwaves induced reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production mainly through xanthine oxidase (XO) in porcine
  articular chondrocytes. Transient ROS signaling activated the phosphorylation of
  ERK1/2 and p38, which increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and the downstream
  gene expressions of Ho-1 and Nqo-1. Activation of Nrf2 function increased ECM production
  in porcine articular chondrocytes.
