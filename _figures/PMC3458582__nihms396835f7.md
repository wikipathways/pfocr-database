caption: HER2 overexpression confers oncogenic addiction to NFκB-mediated signaling
  pathway. HER2 activates IKKα which in turn phosphorylates and dissociates the NFκB
  and IκBα complex. IκBα is subsequently degraded by the proteasome while NFκB translocates
  to the nucleus to activate pro-survival pathways. PARP is a coactivator of NFκB
  and thus inhibition of PARP abrogates NFκB-mediated transcription, which subsequently
  inhibits the oncogenic pathway to which HER2+ breast cancer cells may be addicted.
