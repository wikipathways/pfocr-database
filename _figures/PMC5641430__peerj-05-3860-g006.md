caption: In the iJR904 network, the production of the biomass component peptido_EC
  (Peptidoglycan subunit) is assured by a cycle from di-trans,octa-cis-undecaprenyl
  diphosphate to diphospohdecaprenu-[GlcNAc-MurNAc-pentapeptide]n. All the elements
  involved in the cycle are sustainability, producibility and optimal-efficiency-PEMs.
  The cycle is initiated by a pathway starting from pyruvate and composed of nine
  sustainability-PEMs that are neither producibility nor optimal-efficiency-PEMs.
  Indeed, at steady state, activation of the initiation pathway is not required for
  the production of an optimal biomass, although this pathway may be necessary to
  initiate the cycle when not in a steady state. The latter role in the functioning
  of the network is reflected by the sustainability property.
