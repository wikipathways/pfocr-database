caption: Specific regulatory action of NRF2 on metabolic changes in the different
  stages of prostate cancer progression. (A). In normal prostate epithelium, NRF2
  and ROS levels are low, and cells use glycolysis for energy production with a low
  basal level of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). (B). In the initiation of prostate
  cancer (PCa), cells slowly shift to OXPHOS to produce most of the required energy.
  Glycolysis remains in a lower level. At this stage, radiotherapy (RT), and androgen
  deprivation therapy (ADT) begin. Both RT and ADT increase ROS to kill the cancer
  cells. Therefore, before RT and ADT, the use of a NRF2 activator may reduce basal
  ROS levels of the cells and push them to non-transformed mode of metabolism. After
  initial cell death due to RT and ADT, surviving PCa cells adapt to a high ROS environment
  and NRF2 levels increase in the PCa cells. (C). In advanced stages PCa, cells fully
  use OXPHOS, reduce glycolysis and after chemotherapy they begin using lipids as
  another energy source (smaller font size as cells do not depend on lipid only).
  Overactivation of OXPHOS produces more ROS and NRF2 levels increases. The use of
  NRF2 inhibitors as a therapeutic molecule will inhibit PCa cell growth in a high
  ROS environment. (D). In the metastatic therapy resistant PCa, cells reactivate
  glycolysis by noncanonical reactivation of AR signaling. In this high energy demanding
  stage, PCa cells use glycolysis, OXPHOS, and lipid metabolism to survive (bigger
  font size as lipid utilization increased). Cells are dependent on NRF2 to combat
  ROS. In this stage, use of NRF2 inhibitors along with conventional OXPHOS and lipid
  pathway inhibitors with chemotherapeutic agents may be useful to control therapy
  resistant PCa growth and increase therapy efficacy.
