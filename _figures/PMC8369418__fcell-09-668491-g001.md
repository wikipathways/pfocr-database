caption: 'NAD+ biosynthesis pathway and subcellular equilibrium: NAD+ is synthesized
  via three major pathways, including de novo biosynthesis (also called the kynurenine
  pathway), the Preiss–Handler pathway, and the salvage pathway. The kynurenine pathway
  starts with the catabolism of the amino acid Trp that is converted to FK, which
  is further converted to kynurenine. Kynurenine can be converted to KA and finally
  QA. In addition, kynurenine can be converted to 3-HK by KMO and further to 3-HAA
  by KYNU. The next step is performed by 3HAAO to produce ACMS and then converts to
  QA, which further formulates to NAMN by QPRT and finally to NAD+. NAD+-consuming
  enzymes include sirtuins, PARPs, cADPRSs, and SARM1. The equilibrium of NAD+ is
  a balance of synthesis, consumption, and recycling in various subcellular compartments
  including the cytosol, the nucleus, and the mitochondria. NAD+, nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide; KA, kynurenic acid; 3-HK, 3-hydroxykynurenine.'
