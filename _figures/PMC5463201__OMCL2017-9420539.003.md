caption: 'Examples of NOX signal transduction. NOX1-derived ROS can affect the following:
  differentiation through the p38 and ERK1/2 pathway, hypertrophy via p38-mediated
  activation of Akt, cell migration by the activation of cSrc protein, and cellular
  growth by the activation of ERK1/2; and subsequent activation of transcription factor
  Ets-1 and upregulation of cyclin D. nox1 also downregulates the expression and activity
  of the antiangiogenic receptor PPARα, known to inhibit the transcription factor
  NF-κB and, therefore, affects angiogenesis. NOX1 can be activated by thrombin, PDGF,
  or Ang II; activated by TNFα, thrombin or NF-κB NOX2-generated ROS promote migration
  and angiogenesis through the Akt and cSrc pathways. NOX2-mediated regulation of
  angiogenesis also occurs via VE-cadherin; via the activation of p38 or the inhibition
  of ERK1/2 NOX4-derived ROS promotion; via the activation of p38 or the inhibition
  of ERK1/2 differentiation, which regulates growth, by eiF4E and pRB pathways, and
  migration (through the activation of MMP2). NOX4 expression and activity can be
  increased by TGF-β1 or Ang II; NOX5 promotes growth and inflammation, respectively,
  through JAK-2/STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways. ROS production by NOX5 can be
  activated by IL4 or PDGF; there will be always some omitted proteins, no matter
  how detailed is the scheme.'
