caption: Redox regulation of apoptosis under ER stress. PERK can provoke apoptotic
  signaling by phosphorylating eIF2α, which stimulates the translation of ATF4. Acting
  as a transcription factor, ATF4 then promotes the transcription of CHOP/GADD153,
  which downregulates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and upregulates the pro-apoptotic
  proteins BIM and PUMA. CHOP/GADD153 also transcriptionally induces ERO1 to produce
  ROS. Another apoptotic pathway is the JNK, which is activated by the IRE1α-TRAF2-ASK1
  complex. Phosphorylated JNK activates the downstream apoptotic pathways, and induces
  oxidative stress related to mitochondria. In addition, the accumulation of misfolded
  proteins induced by ER stress will consume a large amount of GSH to induce oxidative
  stress. Moreover, calcium channel proteins IP3R can be activated by SERCA, leading
  to calcium outflow which induces apoptosis.
