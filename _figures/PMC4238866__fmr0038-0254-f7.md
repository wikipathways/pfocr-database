caption: Nutrient sensing by transporter-like plasma membrane sensors. The Snf3-Rgt2
  glucose-sensing pathway. (a) Glucose binding to the Snf3/Rgt2 sensors recruits Mth1
  and Std1 to the plasma membrane, where they are phosphorylated by Yck1,2. This phosphorylation
  targets them for ubiquitination by Grr1 and degradation by the proteasome, exposing
  Rgt1 to phosphorylation by PKA. This turns Rgt1 into a transcriptional activator
  for the expression of HXT (hexose transporter) genes. (b) In absence of glucose,
  Yck1,2 fail to phosphorylate Mth1 and Std1, which are no longer degraded and enter
  the nucleus to repress the expression of HXT genes. The SPS amino acid-sensing pathway.
  (c) In the presence of external amino acids, the amino acids bind to Ssy1, causing
  recruitment of the Yck1,2 protein kinases. They hyperphosphorylate Ptr3 and the
  Ssy5 prodomain, making it sensitive to ubiquitination by Grr1, after which it is
  broken down by the proteasome. Subsequently, the enhanced Ssy5 protease activity
  toward Stp1,2 leads to the removal of the N-terminal part of Stp1,2, which enables
  it to enter the nucleus and activate transcription of the target AAP genes. (d)
  In the absence of extracellular amino acids, phosphorylation of Ssy5 is counteracted
  by the phosphatase PP2A and its subunit Rts1, which keeps Ssy5 inactive. This prevents
  migration of Stp1,2 from the cytosol to the nucleus, and the expression of AAP genes
  is thus kept down.
