caption: Electrical stimulation of the CSN attenuates inflammation via activation
  of the GR in myeloid immune cells. Acute and chronic electrical stimulation of the
  left CSN in mice reduce the levels of blood-borne pro-inflammatory cytokines during
  endotoxemia. Chronic electrical stimulation of the CSN also improves survival in
  lethal endotoxemia. CSN simulation results in enhanced neuronal activity in the
  PVN of the hypothalamus, which activates the HPA axis. As the CSN terminates in
  the NTS, a neuronal connection between NTS and PVN mediating this activation can
  be suggested. The HPA axis, a major neuro-hormonal anti-inflammatory pathway is
  triggered by the PVN production and release of CRH into the median eminence which
  reaches the anterior pituitary and induces the release of ACTH. ACTH travels through
  the circulation to the adrenal glands, generating the production and release of
  glucocorticoids (corticosterone in mice; cortisol in humans). The anti-inflammatory
  effects of CSN stimulation in endotoxemia requires corticosterone signaling through
  GR in myeloid cells with presumed subsequent activation of a genomic, or non-genomic,
  pathway that involves suppression of NF-κB nuclear translocation—ultimately mitigating
  cytokine production and enhancing survival. CB, carotid body; CRH, corticotropin-releasing
  hormone.
