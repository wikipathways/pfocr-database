caption: The structure of FAK. The binding partners and substrates involved in the
  regulation of cell tension are shown. Autophosphorylation at Y397 creates a binding
  site for c-Src and the p85 regulatory subunit for PI 3-K. The Src substrates p130Cas
  and paxillin bind to the proline-rich and FAT domain of FAK, respectively. Growth
  factor receptors, integrins, and ezrin interact with the FERM domain of FAK, linking
  it to the cell membrane. The phosphorylation of α-actinin would inhibit its actin
  crosslinking activity and destabilize the adhesion. Association with GRAF with the
  proline-rich (PR) domain of FAK or the phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP would result
  in an inhibition of Rho, while association with p190RhoGEF or phosphorylation of
  PDZ-RhoGEF would stimulate the Rho pathway.
