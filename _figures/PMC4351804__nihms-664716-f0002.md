caption: (A) Glutamate homeostasis in a PFC-NAc excitatory synapse in a yoked saline
  rat. Extracellular glutamate regulates synaptic release from PFC terminals by stimulating
  mGlu2/3 receptors. (B) After chronic cocaine, basal extracellular glutamate is reduced
  and PFC-NAc synapses are potentiated pre- and post-synaptically as indicated by
  arrows (see text for details). (C) Cartoon of PFC-NAc pathway in a rat brain. (D)
  Stress, cues, or drug primes induce reinstatement of drug seeking by activating
  the potentiated PFC-NAc pathway. (E) Interfering with impulse flow pre- (NAcetylcysteine,
  mGlu2/3 receptor agonists) or post-synaptically (blocking ionotropic GluRs or mGlu5
  receptors in NAc) prevents relapse.
