caption: 'Main molecular pathways disturbed in GDM placentae. In this schematic, we
  highlight in red main molecules reported as overexpressed/overactivated in GDM placentae,
  whereas downregulation is highlighted in green. High expression of phospho-IR-A
  and phospho-IR-B has been reported in the GDM placenta. After insulin binding, IR-A
  phosphorylates IRS-1 and recruits Scheme 2. and Grb2 proteins which induce the GTPase
  activity of Ras, and then a GDP is exchanged by a GTP. This initiates a subsequent
  cascade of phosphorylations of Raf, MEK, and Erk 1/2. Finally, overexpressed phospho-Erk
  proteins translocate to the nucleus and recognize SRE sites favoring active transcription
  of c-fos and Elk-1. FOS proteins have been implicated as regulators of cell proliferation,
  survival, differentiation, and transformation. This pathway mediates increased placental
  weight and increased fetal growth in GDM. Additionally, increased levels of free
  IGF-I resulting from low IGFBPs serum concentrations also activate IR-A signaling
  as well as IGF1R and are related to proliferative effects. IGF-I excess has been
  also implicated in macrosomia and excessive placental growth in GDM women. On the
  other hand, after insulin binding to IR-B, phospho-IRS-1 activates PI3K and leads
  the formation of PIP3 from PIP2. Then, PIP3 activates Akt which mediates diverse
  metabolic effects; one of them includes GLUT4 translocation from endosomes to the
  cellular membrane through TBC1D4 signaling. High expression of GLUT1 and GLUT9,
  and probably GLUT4, mediates high glucose uptake in the GDM placenta, which can
  also participate in fetal and placental growth through an excess of this energetic
  substrate. Finally, GDM placentae present high expression of leptin and its receptor.
  High expression of phospho-leptin receptor recruits JaK-2 protein and activates
  STAT 3 or 5 proteins. Then, STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and recognize
  GAS sites and provoke transcription of VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9, TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β,
  IFN-α, IFN-γ, among others, which exacerbate the inflammatory placental milieu and
  contribute to stimulating the angiogenic process. Additionally, activation of the
  leptin receptor can also crosstalk with MAPK and Akt pathways. Sustained overactivation
  of all these pathways finally leads to clinical insulin and leptin resistance. GAS:
