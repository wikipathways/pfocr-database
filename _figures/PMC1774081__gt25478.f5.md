caption: The Wnt signalling pathway. (A) In the absence of Wnt signalling, Dishevelled
  is inactive (Dshi) and Drosophila Zeste-white 3 or its mammalian homologue glycogen
  synthase kinase 3 (Zw3/GSK3) is active. β-Catenin (black dumbbell), via association
  with the APC-Zw3/GSK3 complex, undergoes phosphorylation and. degradation by the
  ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Meanwhile, T cell factor (Tcf) is bound to its DNA
  binding site in the nucleus where it represses expression of genes such as Siamois
  in Xenopus. (B) In the presence of a Wnt signal, Dishevelled is activated (Dsha)
  leading to inactivation of Zw3/GSK3 by an unknown mechanism. β-Catenin fails to
  be phosphorylated and is no longer targeted into the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway,
  instead it accumulates in the cytoplasm and enters the nucleus by an unknown pathway
  where it interacts with Tcf to alleviate repression of the downstream genes and
  provide a transcriptional activation domain (from Willert and Nusse with permission).
