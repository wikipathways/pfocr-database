caption: Major metabolic changes in the development of hormone-dependent breast cancer
  promote increased production of lipids used for the plasma membrane, nucleotides
  for DNA synthesis, and amino acids (AAs) for protein synthesis. This is supported
  through metabolic alterations, which include increased uptake of choline to synthesize
  lipids. Additionally, uptake of glycine and formate increase, to support production
  of nucleotides and AAs. It has been found that hormone-dependent cancers exhibit
  increased glucose consumption and aerobic glycolysis, increasing lactate production
  and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) intermediates, which also fuels nucleotide production.
  In contrast ER−, or hormone-independent, breast cancers exhibit a shift from glycolysis
  towards glutamine consumption to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as well
  as donate nitrogen and carbon as precursors for proteinogenic AAs and nucleotides.
  Red indicates significant increase in either metabolite or enzymatic pathway activity.
