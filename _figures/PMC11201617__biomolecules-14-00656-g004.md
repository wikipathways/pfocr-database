caption: Hippo signaling pathway. When the Hippo pathway is off, YAP and TAZ proteins
  enter the nucleus and bind to the TEAD transcription factor, initiating the transcription
  of genes that promote cell survival and proliferation. Changes in the extracellular
  components can activate the Hippo cascade by triggering the activation of NF2 and
  KIBRA. These activate the kinases MST1/2, leading to the phosphorylation of the
  protein SAV1. The resulting complex phosphorylates the LATS1/2 and MOB by SAV1.
  LATS1/2 and MOB then phosphorylates YAP and TAZ. YAP/TAZ interact with the cytoplasmic
  protein 14-3-3, resulting in their proteasomal degradation. As a result, the transcription
  factor TEAD inhibits the expression of target genes. KIBRA—kidney and brain expressed
  protein, NF2—neurofibromatosis 2; SAV1—Salvador homolog 1; LATS1/2—large tumor suppressor
  homolog 1 and 2 proteins; MST1/2—monopolar spindle-one-binder proteins; YAP—Yes-associated
  protein; TAZ—transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif; TEAD—transcriptional
  enhancer activator domain; Ubiq—ubiquitin
