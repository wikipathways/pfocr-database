  freundii IFO 13545: (a) preparation of a Kmr gene cassette from pKD4 (Frag. 1);
  (b) amplification of the upstream and downstream regions of the target gene (acs)
  from the IFO 13545 genome (Frag. 2 and Frag. 3); (c) preparation of a DNA fragment
  for gene disruption (Frag. 4) from the amplified three fragments; and (d) disruption
  of the target gene (acs) by homologous recombination using Frag. 4. H1, H2, H3,
  and H4 indicate specific primers that were used or their sequence regions.'
