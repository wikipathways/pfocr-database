caption: LPS stimulated cells to induce the P2X7R-mediated intracellular Omi/HtrA2
  apoptosis signaling pathway. Under the stress stimulation of LPS, mitochondria in
  cells will produce a large amount of ATP and activate P2X7R on the cell surface.
  The activated P2X7R will cause a large amount of Ca2+ influx, and then the imbalance
  of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis will lead to the production of a large amount
  of intracellular ROS and further cause mitochondrial damage. However, Ca2+ overload
  in mitochondria will further increase the production of ROS and cause the transfer
  of OMI/HtrA2 in the damaged mitochondrial membrane space into the cytoplasm. Omi/HtrA2
  in the cytoplasm can crack the apoptosis inhibiting protein XIAP, which leads to
  the decrease of XIAP inhibiting caspase-3 and caspase-9 in cells, and promotes cell
  apoptosis.
