caption: Simplified overview of regulation of ATGL expression. ATGL is demonstrated
  to be activated by β-adrenergic activation. AMPK phosphorylates ATGL at Ser 406
  therefore activates its enzymatic activities. Insulin inhibits ATGL expression through
  upregulating SIRT1, which restrains the nuclear localization of FoxO1 by deacetylating.
  Insulin also inhibits ATGL expression through Egr1-mTORC1 signaling pathway. Sp1
  has an inhibitory control over ATGL in preadipocytes, while the functional interaction
  of PPARγ and Sp1 transactivates ATGL in mature adipocytes. TNF-α downregulates ATGL
  mRNA level but does not alter its protein level.
