caption: The Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome via mitochondrial damage in SIMD. Mitochondrial
  damage leads to the accumulation of ROS within the cell. ROS are released into the
  cytoplasm, where they interact with NLRP3 proteins, thereby triggering the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Impaired mitochondria can also induce a high influx of
  Ca2+ through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter and produce large amounts of ROS,
  leading to the release of mtDNA into the cytoplasm, which further activates the
  NLRP3 inflammasome and induces apoptosis. However, the activation of the kinase
  1/Parkin pathway promotes the removal of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria,
  reduces the levels of ROS and mtDNA, and inhibits the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  After mitochondrial damage, cardiolipin redistributes to the outer mitochondrial
  membrane and directly interacts with the LRR domain of NLRP3 to activate the inflammasome
