caption: Overview of the role of pioglitazone activated PPARγ and ROCK inhibition
  on survival of dissociated single hPSCs. Y-27632 inhibited the Rho/Rock signaling
  pathway, which was activated after hPSCs dissociation. This suppression led to up-regulation
  of the PPARγ protein. Pioglitazone (Pio)-activated PPARγ exerted its role by inhibition
  of GSK3β and increased membranous β-catenin. The mechanism of E-cadherin protein
  up-regulation after co-treatment with Y-27632 and pioglitazone remains unclear.
  Black lines show the role of the ROCK inhibitor as previously reported (, ). PIP5K
  regulates the cytoskeleton (). Red lines indicate new pathways found in this study.
  Only pioglitazone did not lead to colony formation. The dotted lines show through
  unknown mechanism. It seems that pioglitazone-activated PPARγ and ROCK inhibition
  interact synergistically in the survival of dissociated single hPSCs. The APC protein
  (adenomatous polyposis coli) controls β-catenin concentrations and interacts with
  E-cadherin, which are involved in cell adhesion.
