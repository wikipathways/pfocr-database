caption: Biological response pathways of GN2 (A) and GN18 (B) seeds in response to
  salt stress. Correlation analysis results of DEPs and DAMs were mapped into a comprehensive
  metabolic regulation network diagram based on the KEGG pathway. The DEPs and DAMs
  are marked as circles and rectangles, respectively; red and green indicate upregulation
  and downregulation, respectively.
