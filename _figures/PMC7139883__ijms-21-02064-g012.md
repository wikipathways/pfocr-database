caption: Sphingosine kinase 1/S1P signaling contributes to pulmonary fibrosis by activating
  Hippo/YAP pathway and mtROS. In vivo, BLM induced pulmonary fibrosis in WT mice,
  whereas deletion of Sphk1 in fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells conferred
  protection from pulmonary fibrosis in the Sphk1 knockout mice in the fibroblast
  or alveolar epithelial cells. In vitro, TGF-β induces activation of SPHK1 in HLFs
  and blocking SPHK1 activity or expression reduced YAP1 nuclear translocation, mitochondrial
  ROS (mtROS) production, and expression of fibronectin and α-smooth muscle actin.
  Experiments with exogenously added S1P-antibody suggest extracellular S1P signaling
  in YAP1 translocation to nucleus, mtROS generation, and the expression of fibronectin
  and α-smooth muscle actin. Here, we have not addressed the transport of S1P from
  inside to outside by S1P transporters and type(s) S1P1-5 receptors involved in transducing
  the signal inside the cell. The red T bars define inhibition.
