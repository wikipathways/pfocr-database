caption: Pathway for yeast cytoplasmic translation initiation. Protein synthesis begins
  with the dissociation of ribosomal subunits and assembly of a 43S PIC. This is shown
  as consecutive steps in which eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) 1, 1A, and 3
  bind to the 40S subunit first, followed by the eIF2–GTP (green circle)–Met-tRNAiMet
  ternary complex (TC) and eIF5. The 43S PIC binds an activated mRNA near the 5′ cap,
  forming a 48S complex. Activated mRNAs bear eIF4E at the 5′ cap, Pab1 bound to the
  poly(A) tail, bridged by eIF4G to form a loop along with eIF4A and eIF4B. During
  scanning, the 43S PIC in an open conformation, where Met-tRNAiMet is not fully base
  paired within the P site (Pout), moves in a 3′ direction along the 5′ UTR to the
  AUG codon. Either prior to or upon AUG recognition, GTP bound to TC is hydrolyzed
  to GDP+Pi (green and red hybrid circle), but Pi is not released until AUG recognition.
  Start codon selection is accompanied by release of eIF1, Pi loss from eIF2–GDP (red
  circle), release of eIF2 and eIF5, and reorganization of the 43S PIC to a closed
  state with Met-tRNAiMet in the Pin conformation and tightly bound to the complex.
  eIF5B–GTP promotes joining of the 60S subunit to the AUG-bound PIC. GTP hydrolysis
  and release of eIF5B–GDP and eIF1A forms the 80S complex with Met-tRNAiMet bound
  in the P site and a vacant A site ready for the elongation phase of protein synthesis.
  Recycling of eIF2 is accomplished by eIF2B displacing eIF5 from eIF2–GDP and then
  facilitating nucleotide exchange on eIF2. Met-tRNAiMet binds to eIF2–GTP reforming
  TC.
