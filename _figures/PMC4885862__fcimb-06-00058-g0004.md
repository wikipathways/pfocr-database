caption: Survival strategies used by E. chaffeensis during intracellular development.
  (1) TRP120 interacts with some important enzymes involved in the activation and
  regulation of host Notch signaling pathways e.g., ADAM17, NEDD4L, and FBW7. These
  TRP-protein interactions might play an important role in modulation and exploitation
  of the Notch pathway. (2) E. chaffeensis causes decreased PRR (TLR 2 and 4) expression
  through downregulation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK cell signaling molecules and subsequent
  inhibition of PU.1 transcription factor. (3) Interaction of TRP47 with host protein
  PTPN2 or induction of host cell protein kinase A (PKA) by Ehrlichia causes inhibition
  of IFN-γ mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAk/STAT and thus causes decreased
  cytokine production. (4) E. chaffeensis uses a two component system (TCS) for the
  inhibition of phagosome lysosome fusion and thus protect itself from degradation
  by autophagy. (5) The effector protein ECH0825 protects Ehrlichia from ROS by induction
  of MnSOD and inhibits Bax mediated apoptosis. (6) TRPs interact with host cytoskeletal
  proteins to facilitate exocytosis or filopodium formation, which helps direct cell
  to cell transfer. TRP interacting proteins are shown in purple.
