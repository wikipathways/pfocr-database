caption: 'Outlier genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Enzymes and
  intermediates are indicated in black. Enzymes in red are identified as targets under
  divergent selection, with corresponding outlier gene ID in pink. End products are
  placed in the square. CHS, Chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, fla-vanone
  3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid-3′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; ANR,
  anthocyanidin reductase; UFGT, UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O gluco-syltransferase.'
