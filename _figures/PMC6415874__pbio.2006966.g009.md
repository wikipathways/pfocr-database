caption: Potential autocrine (A) and paracrine (B) pheromone response models for stress-induced
  mating-projection formation and same-sex mating. Neither α-pheromone nor a-pheromone
  is constitutively expressed in “a” cells of C. albicans. Glucose starvation or oxidative
  stress first induces α-pheromone and its receptor Ste2 expression in “a” cells.
  α-pheromone binds to Ste2 and activates the pheromone-response pathway, which subsequently
  induces the expression of a-pheromone. “a” cells then become mating competent as
  both “a” and “α” types. The activation of the pheromone-response pathway promotes
  mating projection formation and same-sex mating. Autocrine pheromone response, self-activation
  (A); paracrine pheromone response, activation of neighbor cells (B). MFA1, Mating
  type A1; STE2, STErile 2.
