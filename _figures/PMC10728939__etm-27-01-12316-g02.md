caption: 'Signaling pathways regulated by BAMBI. BAMBI binds and affects three receptors
  on the cell membrane and activates downstream signaling pathways: i) LPS binds to
  the membrane receptor, CD14, to activate TLR4 signaling, and also downregulates
  BAMBI through MyD88-NF-κB-induced signaling, which in turn enhances TGFβ signaling;
  ii) BAMBI inhibits TGFβ signaling transduction, and this inhibition is mainly associated
  with the SMAD family; iii) BAMBI activates the Wnt pathway by increasing GSK3β phosphorylation
  and upregulating levels of unphosphorylated β-catenin and downstream cyclin D1.
