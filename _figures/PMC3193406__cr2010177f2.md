caption: Positive and negative domains regulating p100 processing. The tight control
  of p100 processing requires its DD as well as ARD, which serve as negative regulatory
  domains. The NRD, responsible for p100 inducible processing, contains a phospho-degron
  that is phosphorylated by IKKα and bound by βTrCP of the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase
  complex.
