caption: The regulation of acetylation in DOX-induced programmed death of cardiomyocytes.DOX
  increases p53 expression and induces Bax upregulation, subsequently triggers cytochrome
  c release, promotes caspase-9 and caspase-3 in sequence, and p53 also inhibits IGF/Akt
  signaling to increase caspase-3 levels. SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 and
  p66shc reverses the above process via inhibiting Bax expression and SIRT1 inhibits
  p38MAPK activity, which alleviate DOX-induced apoptosis. Sirt3 deacetylates Ku70
  and OPA1, leading to reducing Bax expression and mitochondria proapoptotic translocation.
  In addition, DOX inhibits STAT3 and ERK1/2, activates STAT1 and p38, acylated ghrelin
  prevents apoptosis through activation of STAT3 and inhibition of STAT1, which depends
  on GHSR1a receptors and requires JAK2 activation, and acylated ghrelin inhibits
  NFAT-4 nuclear translocation and downregulates FasL to reduce the expression of
  caspase-8 and caspase-3. Acylated ghrelin also suppresses excessive autophagy through
  inhibiting AMPK and stimulating p38-MAPK and mTOR. SIRT1 inhibits the mTOR pathway
  and activates Beclin1, LC3-II, p62 to promote autophagy, and SIRT3 induces the production
  of autophagosome and promotes autophagy. HDAC6 inhibitors recovers DOX-induced autophagy
  flux blockage through increasing α-tubulin acetylation. DOX upregulates TINCR via
  enhancing histone acetylation (H3K27ac) at promoter region and TINCR enhances NLRP3
  activation and promotes the expression of caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18 and GMDSD-N via
  bending with IGF2BP1, knockdown of TINCR attenuates the DOX-induced pyroptosis [].
