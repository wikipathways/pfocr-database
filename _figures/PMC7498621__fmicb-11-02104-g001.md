caption: Viral life cycle. Capsid-related proteins transport capsids along the microtubules
  to the nuclear pores. Capsids remain in the cytoplasm and release DNA into the nucleus.
  pp71 can be independently transported into the nucleus, where it combines with Daxx
  to cause its degradation, resulting in the derepression of viral immediate early
  (IE) genes and the activation of early (E) genes after transcription and translation.
  The viral early proteins induce viral genome replication. Following late gene transcription
  and translation, the viral structural proteins are synthesized and are assembled
  with the replicated genome to form a new naked virus, which passes through the nuclear
  membrane via an envelopment-de-envelopment pathway. The naked virus migrates to
  an assembly site on a Golgi-derived vesicle, where it obtains the final envelope
  with viral glycoproteins. Finally, virions are released by budding.
