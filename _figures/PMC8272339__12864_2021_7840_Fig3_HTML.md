caption: 'The signal transduction processes during encystment of Scrippsiella trochoidea
  induced by cold and darkness. Red lines and green lines represent Ca2+-dependent
  signaling process and MAPK signaling process, respectively. Solid arrows and dotted
  arrows represent positive regulation and putative pathway, respectively. RLKs: receptor
  like kinases; CaM: calmodulin; CBL: calcineurin B-like; CDPK: Ca2+-dependent protein
  kinase; PI(4)P: phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PIP5K: phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate
  5-kinases; PI(4,5)P2: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PLC: phospholipase
  C; IP3: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; TFs: transcription factors; G: G protein;
  P: phosphorylation; C: calcium-transporting ATPase; H: V-type H+ ATPase. This figure
  was modified from figures in Tsim et al. (1997) and Wu et al. (2016)'
