caption: Heatmap of Wnt members at the level of transcription and translation based
  on the Wnt signaling pathway (ko04310) network map. The genes displayed in the Wnt
  metabolic pathway heatmap that were differentially expressed in any of the three
  comparison groups at the transcription level, or differentially expressed genes
  in any of the three comparison groups at the translational level, are displayed
  on the heat map. There were a total of 58 genes in the Wnt metabolic pathway heatmap,
  for which the gene heatmap of the translatome is the three shades on the left and
  the gene heatmap of the transcriptome is the three shades on the right; heat map
  homogenization used Zscore. First, if a gene was only differentially expressed at
  the transcription level, it is displayed in red, black, and green shades at the
  transcription level and black, gray, and white shades at the translation level.
  Second, if a gene was only differentially expressed at translation level, it is
  displayed in red, white, and blue shades at the translation level and black, gray,
  and white shades at the transcription level. Third, if a gene was differentially
  expressed at both the transcription and translation levels, it is displayed in red,
  black, and green shades at transcription level and red, white, and blue shades at
  translation level.
