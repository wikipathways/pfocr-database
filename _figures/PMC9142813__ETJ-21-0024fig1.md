caption: Localization and physiological function of thyroid antigens in thyrocytes.
  The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) transports I− and Na+ through the basolateral
  plasma membrane of a thyroid epithelial cell. The Na+/K+ ATPase pump maintains the
  sodium diffusion gradient required for NIS function. Pendrin participates in the
  apical iodide efflux into the colloid of thyroid follicle. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO)
  catalyzes iodination of tyrosines in thyroglobulin (Tg), which attaches one or two
  iodine to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) or diiodotyrosine (DIT), respectively. TPO
  also catalyzes the coupling of iodotyrosine residues to form triiodothyronine (T3)
  and thyroxine (T4) attached to Tg, whereas the dual oxidase (DUOX) supplies hydrogen
  peroxide (H2O2) for thyroid hormones (TH) biosynthesis. Release of TH requires engulfing
  colloid material (endocytosis) to form intracellular endosomes (not shown) that
  merge with lysosomes to form an endolysosome. TH liberated from the Tg scaffold
  are subsequently secreted into the blood vessels. Binding of thyrotropin (TSH; or
  thyroid-stimulating antibody) to TSH receptor (TSHR) activates intracellular signaling
  by the cAMP pathway leading to thyrocytes growth, differentiation, as well as production
  and release of TH.
