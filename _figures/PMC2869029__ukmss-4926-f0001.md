caption: TLR/IL-1R pathway, IL-1R, and all TLRs (except TLR3) signal through the adaptor
  protein MyD88, leading to NF-κB activation and transcription of proinflammatory
  cytokine genes. It also triggers activation of MAPKs (eg, JNK, p38) and its downstream
  transcription factor, AP-1, which coregulates proinflammatory cytokine expression.
  The TRIF or MyD88-independent signaling pathway triggered by TLR4 or TLR3 signals
  via the adaptor protein TRIF, which induces a phosphorylation cascade involving
  activation of IKKi, TBK1, and downstream transcription factor IRF3, leading to IFN-β
  transcription. IFN-β in turn binds to its cognate receptor (IFNAR1/2) and induces
  STAT1-mediated expression of IFN-inducible chemokine genes. IFNAR1/2 also serves
  as the receptor for IFN-α and IFN-γ. The requirement for IRFs is also shown. STAT3
  and STAT6 activation induced by IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13 regulates the expression
  of several M2 genes and also inhibits STAT1 induction. p50 NF-κB homodimers also
  negatively regulated TLR/IL-1R signaling. Distinct transcription factor specific
  binding consensus sequences on gene promoters are indicated with different colors.
  “P” indicates phosphorylation; red T-bars indicate negative regulation.
