caption: The G2/M DNA damage cell cycle checkpoint regulation pathway in diffuse-
  and intestinal-type GC. (a) Gene expression and pathway activity predictions in
  diffuse-type GC are shown. (b) Gene expression and pathway activity predictions
  in intestinal-type GC are shown. The genes whose expression was altered in diffuse-
  and intestinal-type GC are shown in pink (upregulated) or green (downregulated).
  Predicted activation and inhibition are shown in orange and blue, respectively.
