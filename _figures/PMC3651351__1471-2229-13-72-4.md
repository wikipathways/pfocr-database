caption: 'SBGN Pathway of heterotrophic metabolism and changes in expression of metabolic
  genes in Sitka spruce needles during winter hardening. Metabolic pathways were drawn
  using the BEACON tool to represent activities as boxed reactions with associated
  temporal changes in expression of relevant genes (rows in colored bins/small boxes)
  in TP1 through TP4 obtained from MapMan. Gray boxes indicate that the change in
  gene expression was not statistically significant, while blue and red indicate a
  statistically significant up- and down-regulation, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Arrows
  connecting the activities indicate positive influence to generate a metabolic network,
  while “T” represents an inhibitory effect, e.g., components of the alternative ETC.
  in mitochondria interfere with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Each activity
  is associated with an enzyme (white rounded rectangle), enzyme complex (light gray
  octagon), or transporter (dark gray rounded rectangle). Abbreviations: 3PGK, 3-phosphoglycerate
