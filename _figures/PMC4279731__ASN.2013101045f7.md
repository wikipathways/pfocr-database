caption: RBP-J acts as a master regulator that maintains the identity of the JG cell.
  (A) RBP-J regulates a network of genes that confers the endocrine–contractile phenotype
  of the JG cell. Red bars located in the promoters of target genes represent RBP-J
  binding sites. Endocrine genes, such as renin and Akr1b7, and generation of renin
  granules are indicated on the left side of the diagram. Genes necessary to maintain
  the contractile phenotype are indicated on the right side. RBP-J regulates the SM
  genes directly through their promoter regions and indirectly by upregulating the
  expression of miR-145–5p and SRF. miR-145–5p positively regulates SRF, myocardin,
  and Nfatc4, and they act together to activate the expression of SM genes.SRF binds
  to CArG sites located in the SM genes. Given that SRF is an miR-145–5p target gene
  and has two RBP-J sites in its promoter, it is likely that both miR-145–5p and RBP-J
  regulate the transcriptional activity of SRF. In addition, miR-145–5p also promotes
  the expression of SM genes by repressing Klf4, a transcription factor that forms
  a complex with SRF to prevent transcriptional activity of SM genes.Crip1, another
  RBP-J predicted target gene, is an SM marker known to form a complex with GATA 6
  and SRF to promote the contractile phenotype. We hypothesize that the canonical
  Notch signaling pathway is involved in maintaining the myo-endocrine phenotype of
  the JG cell. The ligand–Notch receptor interaction (yet to be identified) results
  in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (pink boxes), allowing its translocation
  to the nucleus, where it binds RBP-J to activate transcription. CaM, calmodulin;
  Cn, calcineurin; P, phosphate; Smtn, smoothelin. (B) RBP-J maintains the identity
  of the JG cells by not only activating genes characteristic of their myo-endocrine
  phenotype but also, preventing the undesirable ectopic expression of genes from
  other lineages.
