caption: Entry into the pathway occurs by biosynthesis via serine palmitoyltransferase
  or dephosphorylation of sphingosine-1-phosphate by sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase.
  The enzyme targets of myriocin, fumonisin B1, and sphingosine kinase inhibitor SKI-II
  are also shown as are the targets of shRNA used in this study.
