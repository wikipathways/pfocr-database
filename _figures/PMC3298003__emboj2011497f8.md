caption: Depletion of PERK, PI3K p110α, and LRP1 but not caspase-8 reduces phox-ER
  stress-induced immunogenicity. (A) Hypothetical representation of main molecular
  players in phox-ER stress-induced ecto-CRT and ATP secretion pathways. In-vitro
  data suggested that while caspase-8 was dispensable for ecto-CRT induction after
  phox-ER stress; PERK and PI3K p110α were indispensable. In fact, both of these latter
  molecules were also required for ATP secretion. Moreover, LRP1 was observed to be
  crucial for surface tethering of ecto-CRT. (B) The mice were immunized either with
  PBS (CNTR) or with highest PDT dose treated CO-shRNA CT26 cells or with different
  CT26 cells expressing casp-8 shRNA 1, PERK shRNA 3, PI3K p110α shRNA 3, or LRP1
  shRNA 1, also treated with the highest PDT dose. These ‘immunized' mice were then
  rechallenged with live CT26 tumour cells. Subsequently, the percentage of mice with
  tumour-free rechallenge site was determined (n represents the number of mice).
