caption: This schematic depicts how low-dose ketamine and lithium can work in concert
  by activating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling
  and inhibiting of glycogen synthase kinase-3β kGSK-3 β to produce robust synaptogenic
  and antidepressant effects equivalent to a higher effective dose alone. GSK-3 is
  seen acting both upstream and downstream of the BDNF/Akt/mTOR dendritic protein
  translation pathway. Upstream, lithium reduces GSK-3 tonic inhibitory influences
  upon Akt/mTORC1 signaling. Downstream from mTOR lithium is shown to reduce GSK-3-mediated
  long-term depression (LTD)-like synaptic deconsolidation or synaptosis. ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase. Blue arrows, activation; red bars, inhibition.
