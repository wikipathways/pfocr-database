caption: 'The metabolic pathway reconstruction graphs of the starch, nitrogen, and
  lipid in the rumen of sheep fed different forage and grain sources. AHLR: alfalfa
  hay and low RDS, AHHR: alfalfa hay and high RDS, ASLR: alfalfa silage and low RDS,
  ASHR: alfalfa silage and high RDS. The red line, blue line, yellow line, green line,
  and black line represent the metabolic pathway of AH rich, AS rich, low RDS rich,
  high RDS rich, and not enriched, respectively. Each heatmap indicates different
  metabolites associated with metabolic pathways, and each is presented in Supplementary
  File S3, Table S6 in detail. PPP: pentose phosphate pathway. EMP: Embden–Meyerhof
  pathway. VFA: volatile fatty acid. TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle. MCP: bacterial
  protein'
