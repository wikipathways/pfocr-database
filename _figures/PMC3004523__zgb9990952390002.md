caption: Engagement of FcεRI (shown) or other receptors, such as FcγRI, BCR, and TREM-1/2,
  results in activation of various tyrosine kinases, such as Fyn, Lyn, and/or Syk,
  leading to phosphorylation of LAB, which can then recruit the Grb2-Sos complex,
  resulting in Ras-MAPK activation and IL-3 production, which promotes survival. Phosphorylated
  LAB may also recruit a Grb2-PLCγ complex, resulting in partial Ca2+ responses. Lastly,
  phospho-LAB may be involved in the LAT-independent Fyn-Gab2-PI3K pathway described
  previously, resulting in PKC activation and degranulation. It is through this pathway
  that the direct phosphorylation of LAB by KIT may potentiate FcεRI-derived signals.
  ?, Unknowns in these pathways.
