caption: 'A possible mechanism associated with the tumor-suppressing effect of Romidepsin
  in DEN-induced HCC mouse model. Romidepsin suppresses liver tumorigenesis, at least
  in part, by mediating the deregulated expression of extra- and intra-cellular molecules
  involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and inflammation
  processes, as well as in cancer-related signaling pathways (dashed lines). Molecules
  whose expression levels are upregulated, downregulated or non-affected by Romidepsin
  treatment are depicted in red, blue, and grey color, respectively.Abbreviations:
  BAD, Bcl2-associated agonist of cell death; CK2a, casein kinase 2, alpha 1 polypeptide;
  c-Met, met proto-oncogene; CYLD, CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase; DKK1, dickkopf WNT
  signaling pathway inhibitor 1; Frizzled, frizzled class receptor 9; HAT, histone
  acetyltransferases; HDAC, histone deacetylase; Ki-67, antigen identified by monoclonal
  antibody Ki 67; LRP6, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6; NF-κB
  p65, nuclear factor of kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells, p65; c-Jun,
  jun proto-oncogene; Nrf2, nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2; p38 MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase 14; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory
  subunit 1; PPAR-γ, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; β-catenin, catenin (cadherin associated protein) beta 1; Topo
  IIa, topoisomerase (DNA) II alpha; Wnt, wingless-type MMTV integration site family.'
