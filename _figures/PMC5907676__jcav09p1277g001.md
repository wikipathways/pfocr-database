caption: The Wnt signaling pathway. The blue pathway is the canonical Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. Wnts binding to its receptors from Fzd family stimulates the canonical
  pathway. The multi-protein complex is then inhibited and GSK3β is phosphorylated
  to an inactive form, leading to a block in β-catenin phosphorylation. Thus, cytoplasmic
  β-catenin is transported into the nucleus, binding to the promoter region of target
  genes with TCF/LEF. The green pathway is one non-canonical pathway, also called
  the Wnt/PCP pathway. Activation of the Wnt/PCP pathway requires the Wnt ligands
  (WNT4, WNT5A, and WNT11) to bind to the Fzd receptor without LRP 5/6 co-receptor
  prior to the activation of the Dsh/Dvl protein. Downstream RhoA and JNK cascades
  are then initiated. The orange pathway is the other non-canonical pathway, called
  the Wnt/Ca2+pathway. Binding Wnt ligands to the Fzd receptor promotes Dvl recruitment
  in complexes with heterotrimeric G-proteins. This activates PLC, resulting in inositol
  IP3 generation and subsequent Ca2+ release. The increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration
  activates Ca2+-dependent enzymes, such as CamkⅡ. The yellow proteins are endogenously
  secreted Wnt antagonists.
