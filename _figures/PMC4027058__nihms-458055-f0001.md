caption: (a) Schematic of putrescine and the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine.
  (b) The amino acid ornithine is a product of the urea cycle. Ornithine is converted
  to the diamine putrescine by the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Putrescine
  is then converted to the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine via spermidine
  synthase and spermine synthase, respectively. The decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) by S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) produces decarboxylated SAM
  (dcSAM), which acts as the propyl amine donor for the formation of spermidine and
  spermine via the spermidine and spermine synthases. Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase
  (SSAT) is a propylamine acetyltransferase that converts spermine and spermidine
  to N1-acetylspermine and N1-acetylspermidine, respectively. The acetylated polyamines
  can be either exported out of the cell via an undetermined transport system, or
  act as substrates for the polyamine oxidase (APAO). APAO catalyses the conversion
  of N1-acetylspermine to spermidine and N1-acetylspermidine to putrescine. Spermine
  oxidase (SMO) oxidizes non-acetylated spermine to form spermidine. Putrescine, spermidine,
  and spermine can also be imported into the cell via a poorly understood transport
  mechanism. All polyamine pathway enzymes are in blue.
