caption: Regulation of hepcidin by iron and inflammation. Hepcidin synthesis is transcriptionally
  regulated by iron through the BMP receptor complex and its Smad pathway (shades
  of blue) and by inflammation predominantly via the IL-6 receptor and its JAK-STAT3
  pathway (green). Extracellular iron is sensed by transferrin receptors (TfR1 and
  TfR2) aided by HFE, which can associate with either TfR but is displaced from TfR1
  when TfR1 binds diferric transferrin (HoloTf). When HoloTf concentrations are high,
  HFE is associated mostly with TfR2 and stabilizes it. HFE-TfR2 then potentiates
  BMP receptor signaling through an unknown mechanism. Stored hepatic intracellular
  iron increases the concentrations of BMP6 mRNA and presumably BMP6 protein in the
  liver thereby stimulating the BMP receptor, its Smad pathway, and hepcidin transcription.

  description: Regulation of hepcidin by iron and inflammation. Hepcidin synthesis
    is transcriptionally regulated by iron through the BMP receptor complex and its
    Smad pathway (shades of blue) and by inflammation predominantly via the IL-6 receptor
    and its JAK-STAT3 pathway (green). Extracellular iron is sensed by transferrin

    is displaced from TfR1 when TfR1 binds diferric transferrin (HoloTf). When HoloTf
    concentrations are high, HFE is associated mostly with TfR2 and stabilizes it.
    HFE-TfR2 then potentiates BMP receptor signaling through an unknown mechanism.
    Stored hepatic intracellular iron increases the concentrations of BMP6 mRNA and
    presumably BMP6 protein in the liver thereby stimulating the BMP receptor, its
    Smad pathway, and hepcidin transcription.
