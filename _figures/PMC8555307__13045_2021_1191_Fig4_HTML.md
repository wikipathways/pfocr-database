caption: 'The TLR signaling pathways. TLRs are located on either plasma membrane or
  endosomal membranes where they detect PAMPs or DAMPs. TLRs trigger two main pathways:
  the MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways. The MyD88-dependent pathway
  is initiated after surface (TLR1/2, TLR2/6, TLR4, and TLR5) or intracellular TLRs
  (TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) binding to corresponding ligands. Recruitment of MyD88 to
  the TIR domain of TLRs induces myddosome formation which involves MyD88, IRAK, and
  TRAF6. IRAK and TRAF6 stimulate TAK1 to activate IKKγ complex, which further releases
  NF-κB into the nucleus. The activated TAK1 also promotes MAPK activation which in
  turn stimulates AP-1 nucleus translocation. Both routes support proinflammatory
  cytokine transcription. In parallel, the myddosome also initiates IRF5 and IRF7
  production to induce type I IFN gene expression. The MyD88-independent pathway is
  activated by TLR3 and TLR4. The TIR domain of TLRs recruits TRIF to form a complex
  containing TRAF3, TBK1, and IKK, which promotes nucleus translocation of IRF3, or
  initiation of a late phase NF-κB via interaction with RIP1 and subsequent TRAF6
  activation. Both signaling stimulates the production of type I IFNs. The detailed
  signaling pathway is described in the text'
