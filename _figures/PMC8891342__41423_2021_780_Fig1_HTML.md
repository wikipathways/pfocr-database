caption: Glycolysis (light green box) supports the anabolic demands of activated immune
  cells. Upon immune activation, glycolysis shifts pyruvate toward lactate production
  instead of feeding the TCA cycle. Accumulation of the TCA intermediate succinate
  promotes glycolysis via HIF-1α stabilization. In addition, the accumulated citrate
  serves as a precursor for the anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate. Glycolysis
  also fuels the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to generate nucleotides, amino acids,
  and NADPH, which is used with citrate for fatty acid synthesis. Oxidized fatty acids
  drive mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, which is more prominent in tolerogenic
  immune cells than in other cells
