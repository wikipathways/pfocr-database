caption: Structure and Function of Gremlin-1. (A) Schematic diagram representing the
  structure of Gremlin-1 with its signal sequence, glycosylation site and cysteine-rich
  region. (B) Gremlin-1 can bind and inhibit the BMP signaling pathways including
  the SMAD family as well as direct binding to vascular endothelial growth factor
  receptor (VEGFR) and activating its downstream signaling pathway.
