caption: Proposed pathways for the correction by probiotics of abnormalities of colonic
  flora induced by stress. Published reports provide evidence for a potential use
  of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease,
  inflammatory bowel syndrome and food allergies. Stressful life events contribute
  to the development of these diseases accompanied with gastrointestinal function
  alterations. Probiotics can correct gut disturbances induced by stress by targeting
  several sites of action, resulting in a long gut–brain neuroimmune reflex pathway.
  (1) Locally, at the epithelium site, probiotics have numerous properties—namely,
  a trophic effect on intestinal villosities, normalisation of gut microbiota, prevention
  of adhesion of luminal bacteria, and reinforcement of the barrier function by enhancing
  barrier integrity. (2) At the intestinal mucosal level, probiotics by secretion
  of soluble factors or directly through activation of specific receptors, such as
  Toll‐like receptors (TLRs), mannose receptors or dendritic cell‐specific intercellular
  adhesion molecule 3‐grabbing nonintegrin (DC‐SIGN) from dendritic cells (DCs) can
  stimulate other immune cells like mast cells, T lymphocytes, normalising the ratio
  of pro‐ versus anti‐inflammatory cytokines. (3) Through a cytokine neurohumoral
  route, probiotics may indirectly stimulate afferent nerve fibres—that is, vagus
  afferents, resulting in (4) a reduction in the levels of systemic corticosterone
  and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH).
