caption: Network view of TGF-beta signaling pathway alterations in colorectal and
  ovarian cancer. (A) Network view of genes altered by copy number changes in colorectal
  cancer in the TGF-beta signaling pathway (diamond nodes) or genes directly interacting
  with TGF-beta signaling genes (circular nodes) based on the protein-protein interaction
  database. (B) The same network view for ovarian cancer. Size of node represents
  frequency of amplification or deletion in patient population. Color of node indicates
  whether gene is amplified (red), deleted (green), or unchanged (gray). Lines indicate
  interactions. Blue dotted line separates genes within the pathway from genes that
  interact with the pathway based on the protein-protein interaction database.
