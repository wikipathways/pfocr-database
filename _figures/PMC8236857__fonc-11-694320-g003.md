caption: Emerging strategies targeting MYCN. Innate systems regulating metabolism
  and immune response can be manipulated in cancer models to hijack the tumorigenic
  mechanism. PROTAC technology can be used to target MYCN (the target protein) by
  enhancing protein degradation through coupling with E3 ligase, which ubiquitinates
  the protein leading to degradation via the proteasome. Specific modalities (highlighted
  in red) have been developed to target the mechanistic components of each pathway.
