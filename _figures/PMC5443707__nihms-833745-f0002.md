caption: Overview of BER.1. BER is initiated by substrate-specific recognition and
  excision of a damaged base by a DNA glycosylase (e.g. OGG1), creating an abasic
  site. 2. APE1 incises the DNA backbone at the AP site, generating a strand break
  with 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-deoxyribosephosphate (dRP) flanking groups. Bifunctional
  glycosylases with AP lyase activity can also cleave the abasic site, generating
  a 3′-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (or 3′-phosphate) and 5′-phosphate termini; blocking
  termini require additional processing (see text). 3. The excised nucleotide is replaced
  by DNA polymerase repair synthesis. A. Short-patch repair synthesis by POLβ involves
  the incorporation of a single nucleotide. B. In the long-patch pathway, a DNA polymerase
  (δ, ε or β) incorporates 2-12 nucleotides by strand displacement synthesis in conjunction
  with the sliding clamp PCNA, creating a flap intermediate that is removed by FEN1
  (4). 5. The DNA nick is sealed by a ligase, namely DNA LIG3α (likely in complex
  with XRCC1) or LIG1. PARP1 preumably participates in the response when DNA damage
  or repair intermediates are not engaged by the classic BER machinery.
