caption: Relative levels of L. aequinoctialis culture metabolites under various melatonin
  concentrations. A pathway diagram of the relative levels (relative intensity/g)
  of metabolites was proposed in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). Data were normalized to an internal standard
  (myristic-d27 acid) and then multiplied by 1,000 times for simplicity. Vertical
  bars and error bars indicate the mean and standard deviation (n = 9, three biological
  replicates and three technical replicates) of the control group and the 0.1, 1,
  and 10 µM melatonin treatment groups on days 14 and 28. Black bars indicate no significant
  differences, red bars indicate statistically significant increases, and blue bars
  indicate statistically significant decreases by using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed
  by the Mann-Whitney test as a post hoc analysis with Bonferroni’s correction (p < 0.0083)
