caption: . Metabolic alterations that cause hepatic steatosis in insulin-resistant
  states. Fatty acids in the liver are derived from diet, de novo synthesis, and peripheral
  adipose tissue. In insulin-resistant states, lipases in adipocytes are not inhibited
  by insulin, and free fatty acids (FFAs) are released continuously and taken up by
  hepatocytes. In the liver, hyperinsulinemia induces sterol regulatory element binding
  protein-1c (SREBP-1c) activity, which increases the de novo synthesis of fatty acids.
  Fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria is reduced due to the inhibition of carnitine
  palmitoyl transferase-1 by the malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) generated from de novo fatty
  acid synthesis. Therefore, free fatty acids in the liver are preferentially esterified
  to triglycerides (TG). ChREBP, carbohydrate response element binding protein; VLDL,
  very low density lipoprotein; ATGL, adipose triglyceride lipase; HSL, hormone sensitive
  lipase.
