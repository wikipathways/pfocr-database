caption: Activation of canonical STING Pathway upon replication stress or DNA damage.
  Self-cytosolic DNAs arise from genetic instability caused by endogenous (ROS, replication
  stress, retroelements, etc.), exogenous sources (therapeutics agents, IR, etc.)
  or DNA damage persistence (loss of ATM, BRCA1, etc.). Cytosolic DNA could be DNA
  repair mechanism by-products or generated during stalled RF processing. Indeed,
  MUS81 participates to RF processing and leads to double strand cytosolic DNA accumulation.
  It has also been reported that aberrant fork processing occurs in the absence of
  SAMHD1, which leads to the accumulation of cytosolic ssDNA. This is the result of
  the displacement of the nascent DNA strand by RECQ1 and its cleavage by MRE11. To
  avoid cytosolic DNA accumulation, DNA repair protein such as RAD51 and RPA are bound
  to ssDNA to prevent their cleavage and passage in the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm,
  self-DNA (or cytosolic DNA originated from pathogens sources), if not degraded by
  TREX1, is sensed by cytoplasmic sensors such as cGAS. Cytosolic DNA are also generated
  from ruptures of the NE or leakage from micronuclei. cGAS activation leads to the
  production of cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), a second messenger capable of activating the
  adaptor molecule STING that resides in the ER. Upon activation, STING translocates
  to the Golgi where it can recruit kinases IKK and TBK1. Subsequently, these proteins
  activate NF-kB and IRF3, respectively. These later translocate to the nucleus leading
  to the transcription of inflammatory factors to trigger the immune response in a
  type I IFN-dependent manner.
