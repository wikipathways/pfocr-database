caption: PARPs and metastasis. (A) In circulating disseminated tumor cells (DTCs),
  PARylation is involved in the downregulation of adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM1,
  P-selectins), which establish contacts between tumor cells and platelets, offering
  protection from NK cells and granulocytes. PARP-1 is also instrumental in the expression
  of CCL2, a cytokine that educates granulocytes to not recognize DTCs. (B) DTCs lodged
  at metastatic sites must rely on cell death avoidance mechanisms to resist the hostile
  reactive stroma and attacks from innate immune cells (see also [] and ). DTCs have
  a predilection for environments rich in survival factors characteristic of the primary
  tumor site. PARP-1 can reinforce Src signaling in the metastases of primary breast
  tumors, in which the Src pathway has been activated by estrogen. PARP-1 shuts down
  the CXCL12 promoter, which negatively affects the metastatic potential of CXCL12-dependent
  breast tumors in bone marrow. The complex interactions between tumor cells and stromal
  cells at a metastatic site can profoundly affect the outcome of chemotherapy. This
  is the case in BRCA1/2-negative breast cancer with a bone marrow metastasis, where
  the inhibition of PARP-1 is therapeutically beneficial, but the simultaneous inhibition
  of PARP-2 regulates CCL3 in osteoclasts, leading to colonization of the bone marrow,
  with immune-suppressive T cells facilitating the survival of the tumor cells.
