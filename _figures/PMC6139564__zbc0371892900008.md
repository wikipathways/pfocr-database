caption: Kinetic model for the modulation of ATX activity by LPA shown as a cartoon
  representing the two ATX kinetic cycles (I–III and IV–VI). Starting from lipid-free
  ATX (I), LPC binding results in a transient complex (II) that undergoes slow hydrolysis
  (defined by kcat slow); this corresponds to the initial slow phase of in vitro catalysis.
  Upon catalysis, LPC is converted to choline and LPA, which can remain bound to the
  orthosteric site (III) or dissociate from ATX, as defined by KD-LPAo. This cycle
  represents the known catalytic pathway for LPC hydrolysis. LPA binding in the tunnel,
  however, can occur in lipid-free (I), LPC-bound ATX (II) or LPAo-bound ATX (III)
  to yield the respective LPA-carrying species (IV, V, and VI). This binding is defined
  by KD-LPAa, the dissociation constant for LPA in the allosteric site, which occurs
  independently of the presence of LPC in the orthosteric site. LPC in the presence
  of LPA bound in the tunnel (V) undergoes faster hydrolysis, defined by kcat fast,
  and yields ATX with two bound LPA molecules (VI); this is the steady-state rate
  observed in ATX catalysis. Last, ATX bound to one LPA molecule in each site (VI)
  can lose either tunnel-bound LPA as defined by KD-LPAa, leading to ATX with LPA
  only bound to the orthosteric site (III), or it can lose the LPA bound in the orthosteric
  site as defined by KD-LPAo, leading to ATX with LPA only bound to the allosteric
  site (IV). The final script used to define the model can be found in Fig. S4 and
  Scheme S1, and the energy profiles for both catalytic pathways are shown in Fig.
  S7.

  description: Kinetic model for the modulation of ATX activity by LPA shown as a
    cartoon representing the two ATX kinetic cycles (I–III and IV–VI). Starting from

    can remain bound to the orthosteric site (III) or dissociate from ATX, as defined

    LPA binding in the tunnel, however, can occur in lipid-free (I), LPC-bound ATX
    (II) or LPAo-bound ATX (III) to yield the respective LPA-carrying species (IV,
    V, and VI). This binding is defined by KD-LPAa, the dissociation constant for
