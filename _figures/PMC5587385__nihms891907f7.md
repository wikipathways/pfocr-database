caption: IFN-α stimulation in HUVECs leads to enhanced NF-kB signaling and upregulation
  of miR-155. MiR-155 may be, in part responsible for IFN-α mediated eNOS mRNA destabilization
  leading to reduced protein expression. IFN-α elicits an immune response through
  suppression of NO and subsequent increases in MCP-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. It is well
  established that insulin activates eNOS through the PI3K/Akt pathway leading to
  phosphorylation of eNOS at the Serine 1177 site and subsequent increases in NO production.
  However, in the presence of IFN-α, enhanced NO production is lost. This suggest
  that IFN-α may induce insulin resistance in HUVECs.
