caption: Mechanisms and functions of proteasomal targeting of Smad1 in signaling pathways
  of BMPs.A. A cartoon to illustrate a novel mechanism for BMP-induced proteasomal
  targeting of Smad1 induced by BMPs. The activation of BMP type I receptor enhances
  the interaction between Smad1 and two other proteins Az and HsN3. The newly synthesized
  HsN3 is in its prosequence-containing form, which forms a ternary complex with Smad1
  and Az. The assembly of HsN3 brings Smad1 and Az to assembly intermediates (see
  step 3). The final maturation of the 20S proteasome may lead to the unfolding and
  trapping of Smad1 inside the degradation chamber and the ultimate proteasomal degradation
  of Smad1. Alternatively, Smad1/Az complex may be docked to a receptor of Az on 19S
  complex for the final delivery of Smad1 to proteasome for degradation. Two other
  proteins, UMP1 and Hsp73, which are known to be associated with proteasome assembly
  intermediates, are also shown. Upon the assembly of 20S proteasome, UMP1 is trapped
  inside of the 20S proteasome for degradation []. Hsp73 may play a role in unfolding
  proteins []. B. A cartoon to illustrate proteasomal targeting of Smad1 as an integral
  event along the signaling pathways of BMPs. The activation of the BMP type I receptor
  is proceeded by type II receptor-mediated phosphorylation of the type I receptor
  and by the dissociation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor FKBP12 from the type I receptor.
  The activated type I receptor induces Smad1 phosphorylation and the subsequent formation
  of a complex of Smad1, Smad4, Az and HsN3, which is in its pre-assembled form containing
  the prosequence. The complex is then translocated into the nucleus, where Smad1
  and Smad4 are recruited to specific DNA-binding sites near those of other DNA-binding
  transcription factors (DBs). In cells where most of the CBP/p300 is bound to SNIP1,
  the removal of SNIP1 from CBP/p300 may be a critical step for the successful recruitment
  of CBP/p300 to DBs. One way to remove SNIP1 could be via the recruitment of SNIP1
  to Az and HsN3 in the complex containing Smad1 and Smad4. The targeting of Smad1
  to proteasome, as illustrated in panel A, could then mediate the co-targeting of
  SNIP1 to proteasome for degradation. The removal of SNIP1 then allows the subsequent
  recruitment of CBP/p300 to DBs for transcription. Possible cytoplasmic targeting
  of Smad1-containing complex via HsN3 assembly pathway is also suggested. See text
  for details.
