caption: Summary of our study. a Schematic view of functional changes of ERBB2 E401G
  and S310F mutants. ERBB2 E401G and S310F mutants can stabilize ligand-free EGFR-HER2
  heterodimers and activate the downstream MAPK pathway more efficiently than WT.
  These changes cause enhanced cancer activity, including increased invasive and proliferative
  capacities. b Workflow of functional analysis of VUS. After narrowing down the likely
  pathogenic variants using in silico prediction algorithms and general population
  databases, a combination of MD simulation analysis and in vitro and in vivo studies
  can lead to efficient functional analyses and identification of targets for molecular
  therapy
