caption: 'Structure of the neurovascular unit (NVU) with particular attention to the
  glucose metabolism impairment. (A) NVU contains the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which
  consists of many different cells including astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, microglia,
  and endothelial cells. The brain cells can work with each other when metabolic demand
  on glucose and other substrates is enough. BBB provides crossing of important substrates
  for mitochondrial metabolism, e.g., glucose, removal of toxic superoxides, e.g.,
  carbon dioxide, and reduce access to the brain of potentially damaging molecules
  in the bloodstream, e.g., some drugs. BBB constitutes a protection against harmful
  factors due to the mechanisms of active intercellular transport or control by proteins
  transporting energy substrates located in the vascular endothelial cell membrane
  (e.g., GLUT1). (B) Intracellular transport is regulated by protein complexes located
  between endothelial cells, i.e., ESAM, AQP4, GLUT1, PECAM, JAMs, VE-cadherin, peripheral
  proteins of tight junctions (ZO1÷3), claudine (3, 5, 12), and occludin. GLUT3 is
  seen in neurons, and GLUT1 in endothelial cells; GLUT2 is a glucose sensor present
  in the hypothalamus in the brain. In the course of schizophrenia, the GLUT1 translocation
  process, and thus glucose transport, is impaired, among others due to the effect
  of harmful oxidative stress, inappropriate mitochondrial metabolism, and impaired
  mTOR pathway. BBB also regulates the exchange of other components, e.g., calcium,
  elements of the immune system, or indicators of neurobiochemical focal lesions,
  i.e., S100β protein. Tight connections in the brains of schizophrenic patients can
  be broken due to the presence of claudin-5-deficient areas. Their expression is
  reduced in the prefrontal cortex and they are absent along the blood vessels, which
  may be associated with the penetration of S100β through BBB and, consequently, with
  a disorder of brain homeostasis. Abbreviations: AQP4: Aquaporin 4; BBB: Blood-brain
  barrier; ESAM: Endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule; GLUT1: Insulin-independent
  glucose transporter; JAM: Junctional adhesion molecule; NVU: Neurovascular unit;
  PECAM: Platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule; VE-cadherin: Vascular endothelial
  cadherin; ZO1÷3: (B) Peripheral proteins of tight junctions (zonula occludens).'
