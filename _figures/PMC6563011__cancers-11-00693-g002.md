caption: 'Schematic view of PKCα inhibitory activity on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway in the normal colon epithelium and in colon cancer. In normal tissue, when
  the pathway is inactive (Wnt-off state, absence of Wnt ligand), β-catenin is phosphorylated
  by the kinase GSK3-β of the destruction complex. This is the signal for β-catenin
  ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. When the pathway is
  active (Wnt-on state, presence of Wnt ligand), the β-catenin destruction complex
  is recruited and inactivated at the plasma membrane through a dishevelled-dependent
  process. In this situation, β-catenin is neither phosphorylated nor ubiquitinated,
  and thus is not degraded by the proteasome; consequently, it accumulates in the
  cell including in the nucleus, where it activates T-Cell transcription Factor (TCF)
  to induce the expression of Wnt target genes. In colon cancer, the β-catenin destruction
  complex is constitutively inactive due to APC mutations. In this situation, β-catenin
  constitutively accumulates and co-transcriptionally activates the expression of
  Wnt target genes. PKCα, which acts downstream of APC, can inhibit the activity of
  the pathway in both normal and tumor cells: PKCα-induced phosphorylation of β-catenin
  targets β-catenin for degradation, while PKCα-induced phosphorylation of the orphan
  receptor RORα inactivates β-catenin co-transcriptional activity. FAP, Familial Adenomatous
  Polyposis.'
