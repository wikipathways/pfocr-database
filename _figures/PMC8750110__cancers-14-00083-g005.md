caption: The activation of cGAS can support metastasis survival. (A) Activation of
  inflammatory genes through the detection of double strand DNA (ds-DNA) by the enzyme
  cGAS. Double strand-DNA bound cGAS induces the production of the second messenger
  cGAMP that in turn activates STING, leading to the transcription of several inflammatory
  response genes. cGAMP can also be a paracrine signal by being released in the extracellular
  compartment or transferred to other cells. cGAS pathway is involved in several processes
  such as alerting the immune cells but is also involved in senescence, autophagy,
  and surprisingly in favoring metastasis survival. (B) cGAS activation in metastatic
  cells. (1) cGAMP supports cell own growth as an autocrine signal by the induction
  of inflammatory genes. (2) To avoid extracellular cGAMP release and activation of
  immune cell attack, cancer cells express ENPP1 that selectively hydrolyze the extracellular
  pool of cGAMP. (3) In the context of brain metastasis, cGAMP can transfer to neighbor
  astrocyte cells by carcinoma–astrocyte gap junctions. This paracrine signal supports
  the growth of metastatic cells by the astrocytes.
