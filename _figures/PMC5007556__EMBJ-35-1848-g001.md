caption: The left‐hand side indicates many (but not all) of the known interactions,
  modifications and outcomes following binding of TNF to its receptor and includes
  the new player identified by Wagner et al (), SPATA2 (red). On the right‐hand side
  are novel, in the context of TNF signalling, modifications resulting from TNF signalling
  discovered by the same group. In addition to the modifications highlighted in the
  paper we have selected some additional ones based on the fact that they are high
  at 5 & 15 min following TNF stimulation in both replicates (Wagner et al, ) and
  score low in the CRAPome database (Mellacheruvu et al, ).
