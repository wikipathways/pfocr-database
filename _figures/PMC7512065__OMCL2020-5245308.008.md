  (a) Low-cholesterol diet. Proteolytic cleavage of SREBP is increased. The cleaved
  SREBP enters the nucleus to activate genes controlling cholesterol synthesis (including
  HMG CoA reductase) and uptake (LDL receptor). nSREBP, nuclear portion of cleaved
  SREBP. (b) High-cholesterol diet. Proteolytic cleavage of SREBPs is decreased, resulting
  in decreased nuclear SREBP and decreased activation of target genes. The decrease
  in LDL receptors produces an increase in plasma LDL. (c) High-cholesterol diet plus
  statin therapy. Statins inhibit HMG CoA reductase, causing a transient decrease
  in ER cholesterol. In response, SREBP cleavage is increased, and the resulting nuclear
  SREBP activates the genes for HMG CoA reductase and LDL receptor. The increased
  HMG CoA reductase is inhibited by the statin, and the increased LDL receptors lower
  plasma LDL.'
