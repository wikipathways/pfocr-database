caption: Role of extracellular matrix–receptor (ECM-receptor) interaction pathway
  in OSCC. The ECM-receptor interaction pathway was enriched based on proteins dysregulated
  in Moderate-OSCC and Poor-OSCC compared to Well-OSCC. Proteins highlighted in grey
  were not identified in our study. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using
  Reactome pathway analysis carried out using Enrichr
