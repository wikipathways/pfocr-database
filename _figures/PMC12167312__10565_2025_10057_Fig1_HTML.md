caption: 'Mechanisms of developmental neurotoxicity induced by anesthetics targeting
  GABAARs. Anesthetic drugs target GABAAR in immature neurons, leading to developmental
  neurotoxicity. Black arrows represent the direct effects of anesthetic drugs on
  immature neurons, while red arrows indicate the subsequent effects triggered by
  the inhibition of relevant signaling pathways. The underlying mechanisms include:
  GA upregulating NKCC1 and downregulating KCC2, thereby enhancing GABA-mediated excitatory
  signaling, which leads to excessive calcium influx and calcium overload. This overload
  then triggers neuroinflammation and exacerbates oxidative stress. Through NMDAR-mediated
  excitatory/inhibitory imbalance (E/I imbalance), synaptic plasticity is disrupted,
  with a reduction in PSD95 and related proteins, as well as inhibition of LTP. Furthermore,
  GA affects the BDNF signaling pathway by enhancing BDNF/P75NTR, inhibiting BDNF/TrkB
  signaling, and causing BDNF dysregulation. Simultaneously, it interferes with abnormal
  ncRNA and PTP-1B signaling pathways, inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress, which
  ultimately results in neuronal damage'
