caption: 'Biosynthetic scheme of ginger pungent compounds [,]. The enzymes involved
  in the biosynthetic pathway to gingerols in ginger are as follows: PAL = Phenylalanine
  ammonialyase; C4H = cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL = 4-coumarate: CoA ligase; CST
  = p-coumaroyl shikimate transferase; CS3H = p-coumaroyl 5-O-shikimate 3-hydroxylase;
  OMT = O-methyltransferase; CCOMT = caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase.'
