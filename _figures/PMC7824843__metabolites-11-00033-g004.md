caption: 'Pathway diagram showing the propagation of 13C label through citric acid
  cycle and anaplerotic intermediates. Solid-filled circles represent 13C label and
  gradient-filled circles represent all possible isotopomers for each metabolite.
  Isotopomers generated in the first turn of citric acid cycle and anaplerotic fluxes
  are indicated by dashed and dot-dashed boxes respectively. Carbons are numbered
  in right-to-left and bottom-to-top directions. Multiple arrows indicate multi-step
  pathways (such as glycolysis). Metabolites are abbreviated as follows: GLC: glucose,
  PYR: pyruvate, LAC: lactate, AcCoA: acetyl-CoA, FFA: free fatty acids, OAA: oxaloacetate,
  AKG: α-ketoglutarate, GLU: glutamate, and SUC: succinate. Fluxes are abbreviated
  as follows: LDH: lactate dehydrogenase, PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase, PC: pyruvate
  carboxylase, ACS: acetyl-CoA synthetase, and ANA: anaplerosis through succinate.'
