caption: Molecular mechanism of catalpol in diabetic nephropathy. Under high glucose,
  AGE/RAGE pathway is activated, leading to angiogenesis, inflammation, cell apoptosis,
  vascular remodeling, and vascular dysfunction. AGE/RAGE pathway is able to stimulate
  the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and lead to production of angiotensinogen
  II (Ang II). AGE/RAGE pathway could also stimulate the release of TGF-β. Both Ang
  II and AGE/RAGE increase the concentration of TGF-β, which increases the production
  of extracellular matrix (ECM). In DM, insulin signaling pathway is disrupted, which
  leads to the impairment of downstream pathway for protein kinase B (Akt) and Forkhead
  box protein O1 (FOXO1). Akt pathway is responsible for inhibiting apoptosis, while
  FOXO1 pathway plays a significant role in oxidative stress resistance and DNA repair.
  Hence, impairment of insulin signaling pathway leads to increased cell apoptosis,
  cell damage, and lack of DNA repair. In DM, mTORC1 is activated, which deactivates
  transcription factor EB (TFEB). This causes lack of autosomal gene expression. Catalpol
  demonstrated nephroprotective effect by deactivating AGE/RAGE and its downstream
  pathway. Catalpol could also decrease the production of TGF-β and Ang II, whereas
  it stimulates the insulin signaling pathway by deactivating GRB-10 and activating
  IGF-1/IGF-1R. Catalpol also increases the autophagy through deactivating mTORC1
  and activating TFEB proteins.
