caption: Graphical representation of the three causal models evaluated, together with
  the associated statistics and the partial correlation coefficient for each pathway
  (±1 s.e.). Tmed = annual mean temperature. The log10 of BMR, Cmin and mb were used
  in this analysis. Total number of observations = 127. p-values were smaller than
  0.01 for all partial correlations (except for those between Tmed and mb).
papertitle: Thermal conductance and basal metabolic rate are part of a coordinated
  system for heat transfer regulation.
