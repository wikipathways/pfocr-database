caption: Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. Schematic representation
  of the BMP signaling pathway. BMPs interact with specific type I and type II receptors
  to form a heterotetrameric complex. Complex formation and ligand binding can be
  potentiated by a coreceptor—that is, endoglin, betaglycan, lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 1 (LRP-1), or repulsive guidance molecule (RGM). After complex formation,
  the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, which then carboxy-terminally
  phosphorylates Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (canonical BMP signaling). Phosphorylated
  Smads propagate the signal via complex formation with Smad4, translocation into
  the nucleus, and regulation of the expression of target genes. Besides Smad-dependent
  signaling, BMPs can also transduce signals by mitogen-activated proteins kinases
  (MAPKs) (noncanonical BMP signaling). Canonical BMP signaling is intracellularly
  inhibited by inhibitory Smads—that is, Smad6 and/or Smad7, E3 ubiquitin ligases,
  such as Smurf1 or Smurf2, or phosphatases (PPA1α). BMPs are extracellularly inhibited
  from binding to the receptor complex by secreted inhibitors, like noggin, matrix
  Gla protein (MGP), and the decoy receptor BAMBI. BMP signaling can be extracellularly
  stimulated or inhibited by BMPER.
