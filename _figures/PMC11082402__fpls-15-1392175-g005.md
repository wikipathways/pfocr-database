caption: 'Riboflavin metabolic pathway. The heatmap shows the accumulation of metabolites
  and the copy number of genes among the seven species. Left corner there is a scale
  bar. The circles represent the accumulation levels of metabolites, and the data
  are represented by the average values of three biological replicates and normalized
  with z score standardization. Shades from blue to red represent increasing metabolite
  levels. The rectangular heatmap represents the copy numbers of genes, with green
  representing a high copy number and white representing a low copy number. The rectangle
  box indicates the key enzyme, and the abbreviation: RIB5, riboflavin synthase; BLVRB,
  biliverdin reductase/flavin reductase; hpaC, flavin reductase (NADH); fre, NAD(P)H-flavin
  reductase; PHO, acid phosphatase; FHY1, FMN hydrolase/5-amino-6-(5-phospho-D-ribitylamino)
  uracil phosphatase; RFK, riboflavin kinase; FLAD1, FAD synthetase; ENPP1_3, ectonucleotide
  pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 1/3; NUDT23, ADP-ribose/FAD diphosphatase.
  Wo, M, R, Wh, S, G and T represent wolfberry, maize, rice, wheat, soybean, grape
  and tomato, respectively'
