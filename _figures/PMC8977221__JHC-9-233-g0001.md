caption: Brief mechanisms of action mediating synergistic effects of combined immunotherapies.
  (a) Blocking the PD-1/L1 pathway alone does not induce an antitumor immune response,
  but inhibition of the CTLA-4 pathway via anti-CTLA-4 antibody promotes activated
  CD8+ T cells accumulating in lymph nodes and then infiltrating into TME, enhancing
  the antitumor effects of anti-PD1/L1 antibody. (b and c) LRTs or metronomic CTs
  trigger the release or exposure of immunostimulatory molecules like TAAs by damaging
  cancer cells, followed by the blockade of the PD-1/L1 and CTLA-4 pathway by anti-PD1/L1
  and anti-CTLA-4 antibody, resulting in robust antitumor immune response,,.
