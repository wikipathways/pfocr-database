caption: Signaling pathways of the CD70-CD27 axis in hematologic and solid cancers.
  In hematological malignancies, CD70-CD27 signaling activates the canonical Wnt,
  JAK/STAT, Hedgehog and TGF-ß pathways which can induce stemness/immature state.
  In addition, crosslinking of CD27 in a protein kinase C or ß-catenin-dependent manner
  and reverse signaling of CD70 were shown to induce proliferation of the malignant
  cells. CD70-CD27 signaling can promote survival by regulating kinases of the MEK
  pathway and transcription factor AP-1 and by the Wnt pathway through activation
  of ß-catenin. In solid tumors, CD70 signaling is associated with cancer stem cells
  and EMT transition via the induction of EMT-related gene expression (SOX2, CD44,
  Vimentin, Snail, Slug and ß-catenin) and via MAPK activation and RhoE overexpression.
  Furthermore, hypoxia is identified as a regulator of CD70 expression and is an important
  factor to promote stemness, migration and invasion of the tumor. Figure created
