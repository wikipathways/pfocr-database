caption: (A) Pathogenic infection induced increased level of TNF-α, which was attenuated
  by 2-APB interrupting Ca2+signaling activity; suppressed Ca2+ mobilization also
  suppressed release and expression of TNF-α. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathway is involved in regulating TNF-α production under O. tsutsugamushi infection;
  however, 2-APB restrains signal pathway of JNK and p38 but activates ERK pathway
  to promote upregulation of HSP70, which facilitates downregulation of TNF-α expression
  by blocking NF-κB translocation to nucleus. (B) Although 2-APB attenuates LPS-stimulated
  TNF-α production, different mechanism displays in regulating TNF-α expression. The
  importance of 2-APB in LPS-stimulated macrophages is to block TNF-α release rather
  than inducing ERK pathway to activate upregulation of HSP70.
