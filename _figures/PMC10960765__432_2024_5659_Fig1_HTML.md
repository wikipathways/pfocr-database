caption: The flowchart illustrates the contents of the present review. A Ubiquitination
  process involves Ub, E1, E2, and E3 ubiquitin ligases. ATP activates the E1 enzyme
  and binds to Ub. The Ub-E1 intermediate then transfers the activated Ub to the E2
  enzyme. Finally, Ub is transferred to a specific substrate by E3 ubiquitin ligases,
  which are categorized as the really interesting new gene (RING)-type E3 ligases,
  the U-box-type E3 ligases, the HECT-type E3 ligases, or the RBR-type E3 ligases.
  In RING and U-box E3 ubiquitin ligases, the Ub is transferred directly from the
  E2 enzyme to the substrate. HECT E3 ligase transfers Ub to the C lobe of HECT, and
  then Ub is transferred back to the substrate. RBR E3 ubiquitin ligase transfers
  Ub through the two RING domains. Subsequently, the substrate with the Ub linkage
  is destined for degradation or to participate in DNA repair, kinase activation,
  transcriptional regulation, and growth reactions. B, C ubiquitination enzymes are
  involved in the process of resistance to first-line chemotherapeutic agents, such
  as 5-FU, CPT-11, L-OHP, and Cetuximab, mainly through their involvement in the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, EMT, cell cycle perturbation, and others. D Various small-molecule
  drugs that target ubiquitination enzymes are being developed for use in the clinical
  management of CRC
