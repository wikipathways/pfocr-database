caption: The mechanisms or pathways associated with sepsis-induced ALI. Uncontrolled
  infectious inflammation in areas such as the lungs, skin, or small intestine can
  precipitate sepsis, which, in turn, may lead to varying degrees of tissue and organ
  loss, including lung injury. One significant pathway affected is the AMPK/PPARγ
  pathway; its down-regulation leads to the decreased activation of Nrf2, further
  diminishing the antioxidant response. Consequently, this affects the expression
  of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and CAT, impairing the ability to scavenge free
  radicals. The compromised state of the AMPK/PPARγ pathway in sepsis renders cells
  more vulnerable to oxidative damage and inflammatory responses due to insufficient
  antioxidant defense capabilities. Additionally, the activation of the PI3K/TLR4
  pathway facilitates the activation of NF-κB, resulting in the up-regulation of inflammation-related
  genes. NF-κB plays a crucial role in the regulation of the inflammatory response.
  Concurrently, activating the PI3K/TLR4 signaling pathway stimulates the MAPK pathway,
  including JNK, p38, and ERK. These pathways elevate inflammatory mediators like
  TNF-α and iNOS, further exacerbating the inflammatory response
