caption: Underlying mechanisms in impaired regeneration during myogenesis. Main regeneration
  signaling pathways in muscular dystrophy and the corresponding targets for intervention
  are presented. In adult healthy skeletal muscle, all signaling pathways are tightly
  controlled and highly synchronized for proper SC differentiation. This is well demonstrated
  by the interplay between Notch and Wnt signaling. Upregulation of Notch maintains
  SCs in a quiescent state and promotes self-renewal of activated SCs through upregulation
  of Pax7. Canonical Wnt signaling antagonizes the effects of Notch signaling, thus
  allowing the progression through differentiation. Also, canonical and non-canonical
  Wnt signaling oppose each other, as canonical Wnt signaling regulates the differentiation
  of muscle SCs, and noncanonical Wnt signals (through ligand Wnt7a) mediate self-renewal
  (symmetric divisions), migration of SCs, and growth of muscle fibers. p38MAPK pathway
  regulates toward asymmetric division and SC self-renewal. In dystrophic muscle,
  signaling is altered and unsynchronized, resulting in defective regeneration. Continuous
  intervention to activate or inhibit abnormal signaling in SCs failed to improve
  muscle regeneration. Thus, a dynamic/cyclic regulation of signaling is necessary
  to balance regeneration of SCs in order to improve long-term regenerative defects
  of dystrophic muscles (Jiang et al., ; Tierney et al., ). Cyclic administration
  of Wnt7a, Notch activators, and JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PKCθ inhibitors have shown beneficial
  effects on the regeneration process in dystrophic muscles.

    regeneration signaling pathways in muscular dystrophy and the corresponding targets
