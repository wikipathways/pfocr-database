caption: Evaluation of the WNT signaling pathway components in an expanded BMP-SOX9-WNT
  Turing network. (A) The BMP-SOX9-WNT (BSW) Turing model according to Raspopovic
  et al. (2014). (B) Modelling of a three-node circuit involving WNT2, β-catenin and
  SFRP2 demonstrates that this circuit can act as a classical activator-inhibitor
  module with all three components in-phase (in the interdigital tissue). (C) Extension
  of the three-node network (B) to incorporate the WNT modulator SULF1 expressed in
  the digit mesenchyme (out-of-phase with SFRP2) as a negative modulator of WNT2.
  This extended network also functions as a Turing network. (D) Extension of the original
  BSW model (A), to include SULF1 downstream of Sox9 to repress diffusible WNT2 ligand
  in the digit mesenchyme (in gray). This model also includes β-catenin acting in
  a cell-autonomous manner. Mathematical simulations using RDNets show that this extended
  BSW network functions as a substrate-depletion Turing system (rather than an activator-inhibitor
  model). BMP2 is the substrate in this system. (E) Numerical simulations of the four-node
  Turing circuit (C) in combination with the five-node circuit (D) establish that
  this extended network (six nodes in total) can also function as a Turing circuit.
  Black arrows indicate that the interaction has been tested by computational modelling;
  gray arrows indicate hypothetical interactions compatible with the model
