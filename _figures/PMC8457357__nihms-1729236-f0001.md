caption: 'TF activation mediated by APE1 redox function is involved in cellular metabolism,
  angiogenesis as well as inflammation-derived human diseases such as IBD. Subsequent
  activation of downstream mediators (such as TNF-α, IL-1, etc.) also have direct
  impact on inflammatory responses. Inhibition of the redox signaling pathway with
  APX compounds reduces the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  and ROS production and alleviates inflammation. The repair function of APE1 is essential
  for repair of damaged DNA or RNA lesions caused by chemotherapy (e.g., Cisplatin
  or Oxaliplatin) or other environmental factors. Overall, APX compounds can reduce
  inflammatory markers and ROS levels, enhance DNA repair function especially in neurons,
  thereby providing a new therapeutic opportunity for wide range of human illness.Abbreviations:
