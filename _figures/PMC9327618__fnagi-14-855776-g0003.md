caption: Servier () the neuroinflammatory cascade mediated by NF-κB. TNF-α, IL-1β,
  IL-6, and CD-40L are proinflammatory substances activating the canonical pathway.
  In the canonical pathway, an inhibitor of κβ kinase (IKK) β (or IKKγ) is required
  for NF-κB activation. IKKβ phosphorylates Iκβ. The regulatory subunit of the IKK
  complex is the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). In the cytosol, IκB is degraded
  by proteasomes, and the phosphorylated heterodimer of NF-κB (p50–p65) is transferred
  to the nucleus and binds to the NF-κB response element. Thus, pro-inflammatory mediators
  such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, and ICAM become activated, which play role in
  the degradation of dopaminergic neurons (DA). In the non-canonical pathway, NEMO
  phosphorylates IKK-α and induces proteasomal destruction as well as proteasomal
  processing of p100, a subunit of the NF-B heterodimer, creating the p52-RELB active
  heterodimer. IKκ induces INF-α production, triggered by TLR7,9. The p52-RELB active
  heterodimer enters the nucleus and binds to the NF-κB response element, regulating
  the expression of pro-inflammatory factors. Eventually NF-κB mediated neuroinflammation
  plays role in Parkinson's disease through DA degradation.
