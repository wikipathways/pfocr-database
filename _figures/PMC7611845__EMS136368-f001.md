caption: The NF-κB pathway plays a critical role in the development of MZL and can
  be activated by various mechanisms. BCR signaling dysregulation is a hallmark of
  MZL and can mimic antigen dependent BCR activation. Upon activation of BCR, SRC
  family proteins (i.e., LYN) phosphorylate the ITAMs of CD79A/B, which signals the
  recruitment of SYK in order to augment signaling. LYN is also able to activate and
  recruit PI3K pathway. BTK is then activated by LYN and SYK kinases, and in turn
  phosphorylates PLCγ2, leading to the proteolysis of PIP2 into DAG and IP3, triggering
  an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm that goes on to activate PKCβ. PKCβ phosphorylates
  CARD11, which then goes on to form the CBM complex with BCL10 and MALT1, eventually
  leading to downstream NF-κB activation. MYD88 L265P mutations leads to lymphomagenesis
  through activation of the TLR and IL1R pathways independent of ligand stimulation.
  Additional mutations and overexpression in other proteins involved in BCR signaling
  and interrelated pathways include CARD11, TNFAIP3, SYK, NOTCH2.
