caption: 'Schematic illustration of ACSS2 in BMVECs alleviating brain injury in a
  mouse model of CA/CPR. Via tail vein injection of HBAAV2/br1-m-Acss2-3xflag-null,
  we selectively augmented ACSS2 expression in brain microvascular endothelial cells
  (BMVECs), catalyzing acetyl-CoA synthesis. Moreover, this study elucidates a dual-pronged
  mechanism by which ACSS2-mediated autophagic enhancement operates: On one front,
  activated AMPKα directly initiates the autophagic process, accelerating organelle
  turnover and clearance of cellular damage. Simultaneously, ACSS2 overexpression
  facilitates nuclear translocation of TFEB, effectively unlocking a transcriptional
  program that broadly upregulates genes associated with the autophagy-lysosome pathway,
  thereby reinforcing the cell’s intrinsic repair capabilities. This intervention
  strategy has proven effective in enhancing the autophagic function of BMVECs, which
  leads to significant improvements in endothelial function and cerebral blood flow
  perfusion'
