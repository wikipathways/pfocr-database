caption: Regulation of PDK1-mediated TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway by hypoxia in yellow
  cattle and yak PASMCs. Solid lines indicate compatibility with the existing research
  base and experimental results on PDK1 and TGFβ/Smad signaling, and dashed lines
  indicate speculation with the experimental results that require further validation.
  Black is the pathway that is primarily affected by hypoxia in this study, and blue
  is the pathway that is secondarily affected by hypoxia
