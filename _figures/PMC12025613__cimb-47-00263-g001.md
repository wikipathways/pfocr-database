caption: 'Key pathways involved in hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis. (a) Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway: Upon activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, Wnt proteins bind
  to receptors, forming a complex that recruits degradation complexes to the cell
  membrane. This results in the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its
  subsequent translocation to the nucleus. (b) TGF-β/Smad Pathway: The binding of
  the TGF-β ligand to TGFβRI leads to the phosphorylation of TGFβRI, after which SMAD2
  and SMAD3 form a transcriptional complex with SMAD4. This complex then translocates
  to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and regulates the expression of target genes
  in collaboration with various cofactors. SMAD6 and SMAD7 act as negative regulators
  in the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. (c) EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: EGFR binds
  to ligands such as EGF, causing receptor dimerization and phosphorylation. Phosphorylated
  EGFR recruits PIK3, which, once activated, phosphorylates membrane lipid PIP2. PIP2
  subsequently binds and activates Akt. PTEN dephosphorylates PI3K lipid products,
  negatively regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. (d) JAK/STAT pathway: Various cytokines
  and growth factors activate the JAK/STAT pathway. Activated JAKs phosphorylate each
  other and subsequently phosphorylate STAT3 molecules. Phosphorylated STAT3 forms
  dimers that translocate to the nucleus, acting as transcription factors to regulate
  gene expression. (e) Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway: MST1/2 kinases bind SAV1 to form a complex
  that phosphorylates LATs1/2. Phosphorylated LATs1/2 inhibit the transcriptional
  coactivators YAP/TAZ, confining them to the cytoplasm or promoting their degradation.
  When the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway is inhibited, YAP/TAZ translocates to the nucleus,
  where they interact with transcription factors such as TEAD to initiate gene expression.
  (f) Hedgehog (Hh) pathway: Hh ligands bind to the transmembrane receptor Ptch, releasing
  the inhibition on SMO. Activated SMO initiates a signaling cascade in the cytoplasm,
  ultimately activating the Gli transcription factors. (g) Notch pathway: Jagged or
  Delta-like ligands bind to the Notch receptor, inducing structural changes. γ-secretase
  mediates receptor cleavage, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD
  translocates to the nucleus and binds transcription factor complexes, activating
  downstream gene transcription. Raf family, initiating a signal transduction cascade.
