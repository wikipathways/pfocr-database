caption: 'Proposed intersection between PAP and ABA signaling during drought stress,
  or in ost1-2 sal1-8 / abi1-1 sal1-8 treated with ABA. Binding of ABA to its receptors
  (PYR/PYLs) inactivates the inhibitory PP2Cs, thus allowing activation of OST1 for
  phosphorylation of proteins such as transcription factors and SLAC1. This is the
  major pathway for stomatal closure. Additionally, ABA signaling results in Ca2+
  release which could activate multiple Ca2+signaling proteins including CDPKs and
  CBLs/CIPKs thus allowing phosphorylation and activation of SLAC1. Many of these
  ABA and Ca2+signaling proteins can be regulated by PAP predominantly via PAP-XRN-mediated
  retrograde signaling. The CDPK activation of SLAC1 can occur in parallel with Ca2+-independent
  OST1, allowing a convergence between chloroplast and ABA signaling at this key anion
  channel for stomatal closure. It is possible that PAP can also regulate stomatal
  closure through other proteins, though there is as yet no evidence for this in plants.
  The relative contributions of each pathway towards control of stomatal closure are
  indicated by the thickness of the arrows and lines. Solid lines and arrows indicate
  characterized pathways. Signaling pathways which have not been fully studied are
  indicated with dashed lines and ‘?''.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23361.018'
