caption: Overview of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in cardiomyocytes. DOX treatment initiates
  a complex interplay of multi-focal signaling pathways that play critical roles in
  cellular responses. The HMGB1/TLRs/NF-κB signaling pathway is activated, leading
  to enhanced inflammatory responses, while the NOX/Nrf2/HO-1/ROS pathway contributes
  to oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species. Additionally, the AMPK/P53
  pathway can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and the PI3K/AKT/STAT3 pathway
  is involved in survival signaling. Collectively, these interconnected events result
  in oxidative stress, mitochondrial DNA dysfunction, increased inflammation, and
  several forms of cell death, including apoptosis, necrosis, and autosis, ultimately
  impacting tissue homeostasis and function
