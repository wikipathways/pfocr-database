  (for example, UV irradidation, viral infection or dysregulated apoptosis) leads
  to activation of antigen presenting cells which phagocytose self-antigen coated
  by opsonins (e.g. C3b), which are bound by their respective receptors (e.g. ITGAM).
  This leads to subsequent APC activation and presentation of self-antigen to host
  lymphocytes. This pathway potentially plays a role in disease initiation and perpetuation.
  In terms of initiation, a tendency towards antigen-presenting cell hyperactivation
  is a path toward loss of self-tolerance. In terms of perpetuation, when immune complexes
  are not cleared, this leads to the production of autoantibodies. [C1q: Complement

  Recent data () suggest that TREX1 digests cytosolic DNA and prevents activation
  of a cell-intrinsic type I interferon (notably, interferon-α) response pathway (see
  ). Similarly, activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs – notably TLR7, TLR8, and
  TLR9) on ligand recognition (CpG DNA or ssRNA) leads to production of type I interferon
  by immune cells, notably plasmacytoid dendritic cells and the interferon responsive
  gene expression signature observed in lupus serum. [CpG DNA: DNA containing CpG
  dinucleotides; ssRNA: single-stranded RNA; TLR: toll-like receptor; IRAK1: Interleukin-1

  | Immune Signal Transduction: Various stages in the life-cycle of lymphocytes are
  important for the development of the autoreactive B-cell clones, which produce the
  pathological autoantibodies observed in SLE. Here we focus on activation events.
  Self-antigen recognition by B-cells starts at the B-cell receptor (membrane IgM),
  where the balance of positive (B-cell receptor cross-linking) and negative signals
  (FCGR2B ligation) are transduced via intracellular kinases, such as BLK and BANK1,
  leading to B-cell activation. A similar process, leading to T cell activation occurs
  after uptake of the self-antigen and presentation on a class II MHC molecule, such
  as HLA-DR to a CD4+ T lymphocyte, which subsequently provides “Help” to B lymphocytes.
  It should be noted that autoreactive clones must avoid deletion before activation
  events can lead to florid autoimmunity. [BCR: B cell receptor; FCGR2B: Fc fragment
