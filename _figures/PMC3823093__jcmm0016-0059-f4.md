caption: The network analysis of proteomics using IPA. The top list of several pathways
  by this enrichment analysis are highlighted, such as NF-κB, TGF-β and P38-MAPK signalling
  pathways demonstrate to play an important role in the mechanical signalling during
  heart failure, Besides, several metabolism disease pathways, including Growth Hormone
  and PRDX6 pathway, are also highlighted. Meanwhile, functional modules related to
  cell differentiation and proliferation, as well as apoptosis (caspases) are centred
  in the interaction network including only experimentally validated targets. Moreover,
  some important modulators in immune/inflammatory response, cardiovascular development
  or angiogenesis, including TTR, ANGPT2 and FABP can also be found in the interaction
  map. The arrows represent the regulation between two proteins.
