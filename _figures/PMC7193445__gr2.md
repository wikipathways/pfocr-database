caption: Examples of SLC mediated drug transport across the blood-brain barrier and
  in glioblastomas and neurons. Three strategies of SLC mediated drug transportation
  in the brain. 1. SLC7A5 mediated liposomal drug carrier system. (1) An L-DOPA functionalized
  amphiphile is loaded with STAT3 inhibitor WP1066, a drug for the treatment of glioblastoma,
  and is modified with DSPE-(PEG)27–NH2, a reagent to enhance the circulation stability
  of the liposomes; (2) SLC7A5 mediates the uptake of Amphi-DOPA into the BBB endothelial
  cells; (3) Released Amphi-DOPA is recognized by SLC7A5 localized to the membrane
  of glioblastoma cells and is taken up by tumor cells; (4) WP1066 is released from
  the Amphi-DOPA and induces tumor cell death by inhibiting the STAT3 pathway. 2.
  SLC22A5 mediates the nanoparticle drug carrier system. (1) L-carnitine-conjugated
  poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA, biodegradable synthetic polymer) nanoparticles
  (LC-PLGA NPs) are developed which are loaded with paclitaxel, an anti-glioma drug;
  (2) SLC22A5 mediates the uptake of LC-PLGA NPs into the BBB endothelial cells; (3)
  Released LC-PLGA NPs are recognized by SLC22A5 localized in the membrane of glioblastoma
  cells and are taken up by tumor cells; (4) paclitaxel is released from the LC-PLGA
  NPs, leading to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis
  by the anti-microtubule effect. 3. SLC7A5 mediates prodrug carrier system. L-DOPA
  is a prodrug of the neurotransmitters dopamine. It is transported across the BBB
  and taken up by neurons via SLC7A5. L-DOPA is converted to dopamine for the treatment
  of Parkinson's disease.
