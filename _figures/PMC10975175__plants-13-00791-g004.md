caption: (A) Heat stress often leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  such as superoxide radicals (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In order to counteract
  the detrimental effects of ROS, plants activate heme oxygenase (HO), an enzyme responsible
  for converting heme to carbon monoxide (CO) as a byproduct. CO can then activate
  guanylate cyclase (GC), which triggers the production of cGMP. cGMP acts as a secondary
  messenger in various signaling pathways, including the stomatal signaling pathway.
  It activates the PKG (Protein Kinase-G) in guard cells, which are involved in phosphorylating
  different target proteins, including ion transporters and channels. Additionally,
  CO regulates the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which play a crucial
  role in safeguarding proteins from denaturation and aggregation during stressful
  conditions. Furthermore, CO induces the production of both enzymatic (SOD/CAT) and
  non-enzymatic antioxidants to scavenge ROS production, thereby inhibiting oxidative
  stress. (B) A straightforward model is presented in this illustration to demonstrate
  the role of CH4 in a stressful environment. Methane penetrates the plant cell through
  stomata and is transformed into methanol by the enzymatic activity of MMO (Methane
  monooxygenase). Methanol is a toxic substance, but it also acts as a signaling molecule
  that can stimulate the production of HSPs. Methanol binds to a receptor protein
  on the surface of the (ER) and triggers a signaling cascade that results in the
  increased production of HSPs and the activation of antioxidant and oxidative enzymes.
  These enzymes are then transported to various parts of the cell, where they help
  to safeguard the cell from ROS damage
