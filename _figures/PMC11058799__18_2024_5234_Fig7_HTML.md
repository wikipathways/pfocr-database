caption: 'A Gene network crosstalk between selected DEGs (TYK2, STAT1 and TLR7) created
  with NetworkAnalyst software [44]. Predicted protein–protein interactions involved
  in the canonical IFNα/β pathway are colored in turquoise. Named proteins are those
  found disrupted as consequence of TYK2 deficiency; in turquoise appear those shared
  both by MZ and by FO B cells analyzed by RNA-seq (17 out of a total of 49) or by
  qPCR (JAK1); in black are those analyzed by cytometry (IFNAR1) or ELISA (IL6, IL10,
  TNF-α). B Proposed model of the orchestration of IFN-I and TLR7 signaling by TYK2
  in splenic B cells. Left panel: Tyk2−/− cells in homeostasis showed down-regulation
  of IFN-I signaling pathway and low TLR7 expression. Middle panel: in WT cells, in
  the presence of IFN-I and TLR7L forward IFN-I signaling through IFNAR induces TLR7
  expression which in turn, upon binding to its ligands induces IFN-I, Igs and cytokine
  secretion. Right panel: upon activation with IFN-I plus TLR7L, Tyk2−/− cells poorly
  induce TLR7, are unable to proliferate and differentiate like WT cells and secrete
  lower amounts of cytokines and antibodies. TLR7 is a target of the IFN-I pathway
  in splenic B cells'
