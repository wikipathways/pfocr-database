caption: Mechanism of intestinal dysplasia. Under normal homeostatic conditions, activity
  of Immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is tightly regulated by multiple factors. This
  ensures moderate innate immune response sufficient to keep intestinal microbes in
  check while preventing excessive immune activation. In an aging intestine, however,
  loss of these regulatory mechanisms leads to chronic inflammation and dysbiosis,
  which results in dysplasia and disruption of tissue homeostasis. Dual oxidase (Duox),
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), peptidoglycan (PGRP), Relish (Rel), poor Imd response
  upon knock-in (PIRK), antimicrobial peptides (AMP).
