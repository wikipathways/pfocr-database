caption: Calpain-1 is rapidly stimulated by the calcium influx generated by NMDA receptor
  activation, resulting in spectrin and PHLPP1β (SCOP) degradation. Rapid calpain-1
  activation triggers a number of different signaling pathways, including cytoskeleton
  reorganization due to spectrin and RhoA truncation, and the ERK pathway through
  PHLPP1β degradation. In the following minutes, calpain-2 is in turn phosphorylated
  and stimulated through BDNF-mediated ERK activation; this leads to PTEN degradation,
  mTOR activation and stimulation of the synthesis of a number of proteins with mRNAs
  located in dendrites, including PHLPP1β and RhoA. Restoration of normal PHLPP1β
  levels inhibits ERK, thereby terminating the induction process for LTP.
