caption: PPD proteins and Dicer are proposed to function in three different pathways.
  On the right-hand side of the diagram, si/miRNA-dependent functions of Dicer and
  PPD proteins are illustrated. si/miRNA-directed mRNA cleavage or translational repression
  does not require Chp1 and Tas1-like proteins and is proposed to occur in the cytoplasm.
  In contrast, the heterochromatin-specific functions take place in the nucleus. On
  the left-hand side, we outline a model to account for the cell cycle functions of
  Dicer and PPD proteins. DNA damage or inhibition of replication results in a cascade
  of signalling events that lead to cell-cycle arrest via a Cdc2-dependent checkpoint.
  Although the exact points of PPD or Dicer proteins action along this pathway are
  unknown (red arrows), it is thought that these functions are independent of si/miRNAs.
  In contrast, RISC-mediated mRNA degradation and translational suppression (green
  arrows) require Dicer-dependent si/miRNA production and their inclusion into RISC
  or RISC-like complexes. Likewise, heterochromatin formation (purple arrows) requires
  the production and inclusion of si/miRNAs into a specialized complex named RITS.
  Association of RITS with chromatin results in methylation of histone H3 Lys9, followed
  by Swi6 binding and subsequent spreading of silencing to neighbouring regions.
