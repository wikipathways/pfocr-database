caption: Anti-IFN-I autoantibodies underlie life-threatening COVID-19. IFN-I can bind
  to the IFNαR and cause the phosphorylation of TYK2 and JAK1, thereby further activating
  STATs. STATs translocate to the nucleus and regulate type I IFN–inducible gene expression
  to achieve the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Autoantibodies against type I IFNs may
  underlie critical COVID-19 by blocking the binding of type I IFNs to their receptor
  and impairing type I IFN immunity. The number of SARS-CoV-2 represents the severity
  of the COVID-19. IFN, interferon; IFNαR, interferon-α receptor; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; P, phosphorylation; JAK, Janus kinase; TYK, tyrosine
  kinase; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; COVID-19, coronavirus
  disease 2019 pneumonia. The red cross represents the pathway blocked by the autoantibodies.
