caption: Upper part of the glycolytic pathway and pathways for production of glycerol,
  trehalose, and glycogen, with all proteins and their isoforms indicated. Expression
  of the genes encoding the proteins that are underlined is stimulated after osmotic
  shock, and expression of those that are overlined is diminished.
