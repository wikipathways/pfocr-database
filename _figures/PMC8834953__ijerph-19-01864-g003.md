caption: Mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation in the kidney. Stress
  stimuli example for, cisplatin, DGal, STZ, LPS, OPN, high glucose, and H2O2 generate
  ROS in the kidney. Accumulation of ROS induces inflammation through the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 involves a multi-protein complex known as inflammasome,
  which triggers the NF-κB signaling pathway. HMGB1 protein is a late inflammation
  instigating compound which activates the NF-κB signaling pathway by binding with
  Toll-like receptors. The NF-κB pathway further promotes an inflammatory storm by
  releasing inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18), which ultimately leads
  to kidney damage. High-mobility group box 1; HMGB1, D (+) galactosamine; DGal, osteopontin;
