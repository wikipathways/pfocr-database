caption: Alkaline responses in Rim101 regulation. Alkaline pH stimulates Rim101 activity
  through increased expression and proteolytic activation. The ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II,
  and Snf7-Vps20 complexes are required for Rim101 activation. The Rim13p-dependent
  C-terminal proteolytic processing event also depends on Rim20, Rim8, and other transmembrane
  proteins. Full-length Rim101-long does not have a known activity. Processed Rim101-short
  is required for the alkaline response, which includes activation of alkaline pH-induced
  genes, repression of alkaline pH-repressed genes, and filamentation. Since Rim101
  is an alkaline pH-induced gene, its expression may depend on autoregulation by Rim101-short.
  Alkaline pH also stimulates a RIM101-independent pathway. This pathway activates
  PHR2 expression and stimulates filamentation in conjugation with Rim101.
