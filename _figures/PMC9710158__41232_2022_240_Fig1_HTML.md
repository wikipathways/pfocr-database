caption: 'Systemic cancer ecosystem self-organized by CSCs in glioma-bearing mice.
  A functional niche network for CSCs to replenish iron, indispensable to GSC expansion
  themselves, is delineated by interconnecting GSC-induced TAM development in brain,
  and GSC-triggered enhanced erythropoiesis in peripheral. (1) Glioma: TfR+ GSCs recruit
  CCR2+ CD68+ inflammatory monocytes (iMo) from peripheral BM and induce F4/80+ CD163+ CD204+
  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through secreting some soluble factors such
  as CCL2 and CSF1/2 [Mo/Mφ development]. On the other hand, GSCs facilitate medullar
  and extramedullar erythropoiesis in peripheral hematopoietic organs, i.e., BM and
  spleen, potentially through secreting some soluble mediators. Collectively, Ter119+
  hemorrhaged erythrocytes (hEC) infiltrating from peripheral are phagocytosed by
  the TAMs in brain and catabolized into iron [erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling].
  Iron is stored in TAMs and potentially released upon the demands of GSCs highly
  expressing the receptor for the iron-carrier transferrin (Tf) [iron replenishment].
  (2) Spleen: CD163+ TIM4+ red pulp macrophages (RPMs) originally have the ability
  to engulf the aged and damaged erythrocytes (a/dECs) externalizing phosphatidylserine
  (PS) at the cell surface to recycle and release iron into blood stream at the time
  of needs [erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling]. (3) Bone marrow (BM): hematopoietic
  differentiation from common myeloid progenitors (cMP) to erythroblasts (EB), reticulocytes
  (Retic), and erythrocytes (EC) is enhanced in glioma-bearing mouse BM [erythropoiesis],
  potentially maintaining the influx of erythrocytes hemorrhaged into glioma tissues.
  In BM erythropoiesis, CD169+ nurse macrophages uptake the recycling iron from blood
  stream and supply it for EBs to synthesize hemoglobin from heme composed of protoporphyrin
  IX (PpIX) and iron. Such heme synthesis pathway is also elevated in iron-demanding
  TfR+ GSCs, causing them to escape from 5-ALA-based photodynamic diagnosis (PDD)
  during surgical operation'
