caption: (A) The list of regeneration genes from  and  with Z scores > 2.0 was assessed
  for Gene Ontology (GO) pathway enrichment using BINGO software (; ). Those pathways
  significantly enriched (Bonferroni-corrected family-wise error rate [FWER] p < 0.01)
  are shown with colored circles of greater intensity for greater significance. The
  size of each circle reflects the number of genes in that category.(B) The list of
  regeneration genes from  and  with Z scores > 2.0 that are in the “transport” GO
  function group was analyzed using GeneMania software () for interactions. Each red
  circle is regeneration gene, each gray diamond is a protein domain, and each gray
  circle is predicted regeneration gene on the basis of sequence homology. Protein-protein
  interactions, co-localization, and co-expression are shown by connecting lines.
  The “transport” pathways includes multiple Rab proteins. Statistical significance
  for enrichment of this process by genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated
  using the STRING database ().(C) Similar analysis as in (B) but for the “receptor
  binding” GO process.(D) Similar analysis as in (B) but for the “cytokine” plus “Jak-Stat
  signaling” KEGG pathways.
