caption: During cold exposure in brown fat, (i) norepinephrine binds to β3–adrenergic
  (β3-AR) receptors coupled with a G protein. This leads to increased cAMP level and
  phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA). (ii) Activated PKA phosphorylates hormone
  sensitive lipase (HSL), which hydrolyzes triglycerides (TG) into fatty acids and
  glycerol. (iii) Fatty acids are converted to fatty acyl-CoA by a long-chain acyl-CoA
  synthetase (ACSL). (iv) Norepinephrine-induced PKA also leads to activation of PKC
  through phoshoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). This could cause (v) phosphorylation of
  phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP), which relocates to mitochondria and
  interacts with thioesterase superfamily member 2 (Them2). This stimulates thioesterase
  activity and prevents fatty acyl-CoA uptake into mitochondria. (vi) Within mitochondria,
  fatty acyl-CoAs are oxidized, yielding NADH that is used for production of heat
  via uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which dissipates the proton gradient established
  by the electron transport chain (ETC). (vii) Under conditions where ATP production
  by the ETC exceeds heat production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced through
  the ETC provide feedback inhibition of this signaling pathway. Solid arrows indicate
  metabolic pathways. Hashed lines indicate stimulatory (arrowheads) and inhibitory
  (line-stops) regulation.
