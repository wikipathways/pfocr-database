caption: TRPV1 is expressed on primary sensory neurons of the unmyelinated (C fibre)
  type. Activation of TRPV1 by agonists like capsaicin, heat and protons (and putative
  ‘endovanilloids’) triggers the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides like substance
  P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), thereby initiating the biochemical
  cascade known as neurogenic inflammation. At the same time, an impulse is generated
  that is perceived in the brain as pain or itching. Protein kinase C (PKC) and nerve
  growth factor (NGF) lower the activation threshold of TRPV1 (sensitization). Stimulation
  of TRPV1 with a therapeutic dose of capsaicin results in a lasting (up to months)
  but fully reversible state in which the previously excited neurons remain unresponsive
  (‘silent’) to further challenge; traditionally, this is called desensitization.
  High-dose capsaicin patches and site-specific injections relieve pain by this mechanism.
  There is an ill-defined line between reversible desensitization and irreversible
  neurotoxicity achieved by therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of capsaicin, respectively.
  Although both desensitization and neurotoxicity depend on capsaicin-induced Ca2+
  influx through the TRPV1 channel, the downstream molecular mechanisms are still
  poorly understood. Mitochondrium swelling is an early ultrastructural sign of capsaicin
  neurotoxicity. Ca2+ is thought to sequester in mitochondria, where it triggers apoptosis
  using a molecular pathway that includes caspase activation. Intrathecal resiniferatoxin
  is used as a ‘molecular scalpel’ to achieve permanent analgesia in cancer patients
  with chronic, intractable pain by ablating sensory neurons. In principle, a similar
  strategy can be used to kill cancer cells that overexpress TRPV1 compared with normal
  counterparts. We note that small molecule TRPV1 antagonists prevent only TRPV1 activation
  by agonists, leaving other pain sensors intact.
