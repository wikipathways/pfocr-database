caption: 'Proposed metabolic pathway for tepotinib. Structural formulae are postulates
  and have yet to be confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and/or chemical
  synthesis, except for those proven by synthesis: racemic M506 (MSC2569775), M508–1
  (MSC2489309), M508–2 (MSC2489308), and M478 (MSC2157042)'
papertitle: Open-label, single-center, phase I trial to investigate the mass balance
  and absolute bioavailability of the highly selective oral MET inhibitor tepotinib
  in healthy volunteers.
