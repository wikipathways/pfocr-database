caption: CHI3L1-induced tumor angiogenesis, growth, migration, invasion, and inflammation.
  CHI3L1, secreted by tumors, stimulates angiogenesis by activating endothelial cells
  through the coupling of the membrane receptor syndecan-1 with integrin and upregulating
  the expression of VEGF via the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways. CHI3L1 promotes tumor growth
  and migration by interacting with TGF-β1 and its receptor TGFR, thereby activating
  the SMAD2/SMAD3 signaling pathway. Additionally, CHI3L1 interacts with CD44 and
  IL-13Rα2, further activating the AKT and ERK1/2 pathways, which enhance tumor growth
  and invasion. CHI3L1 also promotes invasion via MMP-9 and induces the secretion
  of CXCL8 and IL-6, driving inflammation and tumor progression
