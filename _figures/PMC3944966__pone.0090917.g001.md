caption: The scheme illustrates the individual enzymatic steps and intermediates of
  the catabolism of phe/tyr to acetoacetate and fumarate in the cytoplasmic compartment
  and their further metabolization within mitochondria. PAH, phenylalanine hydroxylase;
  BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin; TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; HPPD, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
  dioxygenase; HGD, homogentisate dioxygenase; MAAI, maleylacetoacetate isomerase;
  FAH, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase; DCA, dichloroacetate; TC, tricaboxylic acid
  cycle; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation.
