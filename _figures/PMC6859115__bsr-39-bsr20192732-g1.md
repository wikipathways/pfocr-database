caption: Enolase, in the glycolytic pathway, is involved in the breakdown of glucose
  into two pyruvate molecules and the high-energy compounds ATP and cofactor NADH,
  providing energy and material basis for cell metabolism and various life activities.
  Under normoxic conditions (left panel), most of the cellular energy is obtained
  from oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria with O2 as the terminal electron
  receiver in the electron transport chain to generate ∼34 ATPs/glucose molecule.
  However, in the absence of O2 or under reduced oxygen conditions (hypoxia, right
  panel), cells resort to substrate level phosphorylation by increasing the rate of
  glycolysis to generate ATPs from the process. The expressions and activities of
  glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, enolase and pyruvate kinase are elevated to facilitate
  the process. Cell damaging and cancer promoting factors, including ROS, are by-products
  of such inefficient cellular respiratory process.
