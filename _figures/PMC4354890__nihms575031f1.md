caption: (a) The ATR-mediated replication stress response. ATR and its obligate binding
  partner ATRIP are activated by a primer-template junction at the stalled replication
  fork, where ATR initiates a signaling cascade primarily mediated by the effector
  kinase Chk1. This response promotes fork stabilization and restart, while preventing
  progression through the cell cycle until replication is completed.(b) Mechanisms
  for the restart / rescue of stalled forks. Replication forks stalled at DNA lesions
  (shown here on the leading strand, red star) and stabilized by the ATR pathway can
  restart replication by firing dormant origins, repriming replication, reversing
  the stalled fork or activating the DNA damage tolerance pathways. Key intermediates
  in these restart pathways are illustrated.(c) Mechanisms of fork collapse. If stalled
  forks are not stabilized, or persist for extended periods of time, replication forks
  will collapse, preventing replication restart. The mechanism by which a replication
  fork collapses is still ambiguous, and several possibilities are presented here,
  including dissociation of replisome components, nuclease digestion of a reversed
  or stalled fork (middle panels) or replication run-off.
