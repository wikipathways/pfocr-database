caption: 'Overall scheme of the predicted cys regulon genes from Escherichia coli
  and putative orthologs identified in X. citri genome. (a) cys regulon genes from
  E. coli and (b) orthologs found in X. citri. Green boxes indicate the genes for
  the sulfate (SO42-) uptake system that are responsible for binding and reduction
  to sulfide, through a set of reactions whose intermediates are adenosine-5’-phosphosulfate
  (APS), 3’-phosphoadenosine-5’-phosphosulfate (PAPS) and sulfite. Identical colored
  lines (red, green and black) in boxes from X. citri genes represent genes that belong
  to the same predicted operon. CysP, only identified in E. coli, is the periplasmic
  component for thiosulfate uptake that uses the same sulfate transporter. Light blue
  boxes indicate the genes that are described for the transport and assimilation of
  alkanesulfonates. Based on the sequence identity and molecular modeling, the taurine
  transporter and TauD of the E. coli pathway (shown in gray) were not identified
  in X. citri, but seem to be replaced by other homologs of putative alkanesulfonate
  or aliphatic sulfonate transporter and desulfonative enzymes (SsuD1 and SlfA) (darker
  blue boxes). The red boxes show the regulatory genes, cysB, cbl. All genes are identified
  by their KEGG code and when present, the name of the putative protein. P: periplasmic
  space, I.M.: inner membrane, C: cytoplasm'
