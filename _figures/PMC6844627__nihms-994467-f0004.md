caption: 'The top citrullinated proteins for [ref] were up-loaded and analyzed in
  cytoscape via reactomeFI. Circles nodes represent proteins that were differentially
  citrullinated, whereas triangle nodes represent proteins that were not reported
  as having differenitally citrullinated residues, but are linked to proteins, through
  protein-protein interactions (grey lines) that do have differentially regulated
  citrullinated residues. The top 3 pathways enriched per module were extracted. Module
  1: Striated muscle contraction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy.
  Module 2: glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Biosynthesis of amino acids, and validated
  targets of c-myc transcriptional activation. Module 3: Parkinson’s disease, The
  citric acid cycle and respiratory electron transport, and Huntington disease. Module
  4: Tyrosine metabolism, Fatty acid degradation, and retinol metabolism. Module 5:
  The citric acid (TCA) cycle and respiratory electron transport, carbon metabolism,
  and metabolic pathway.'
