caption: Diverse roles of the Hippo pathway in epithelial cells and progenitor cells.
  a The Hippo pathway is involved in fundamental cellular functions, such as proliferation,
  differentiation, regeneration, cellular senescence, and regulated cell death. The
  appropriate regulation of the Hippo pathway in lung epithelial cells is essential
  for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Observed in IPF lungs are dysfunctional
  epithelial cells. In particular, epithelial cells with impaired differentiation,
  leading to features of both basal and mesenchymal cells, have been revealed as pathogenic
  epithelial populations. Furthermore, increased senescent cells and cells undergoing
  cell death due to repetitive cellular stresses play an important role in the progression
  of IPF. b Alveoli are lined by AT1 and AT2 cells. In acute lung injury, NF-κB is
  upregulated in the AT2 cells, and inflammation occurs. In response to the damage,
  YAP is activated in AT2 cells and promotes their proliferation. Furthermore, YAP
  induces IκBα expression in AT2 cells for resolution of the inflammation. In addition,
  upregulated YAP causes AT2 cells to differentiate into AT1 cells to promote tissue
  repair. c In the airway, basal progenitor cells and secretory cells comprise the
  pseudostratified epithelial architecture. Both types of cells transit reciprocally
  between each other, depending on YAP expression. When YAP is downregulated in basal
  progenitor cells, which then differentiate into secretory cells. In contrast, increased
  YAP expression in the differentiated cells causes them to dedifferentiate and acquire
  stemness. On the other hand, YAP overexpression in basal progenitor cells leads
  to their proliferation and stratification. With these findings, YAP can be considered
  a key factor for regulating tissue regeneration after injury by balancing quiescent
  and proliferative states
