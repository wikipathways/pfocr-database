caption: Cellular stress signaling in neurotoxicant-induced neuronal degeneration.
  Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central driver of PD and plays a significant role
  in PD pathogenesis. In the brain, MPTP is first metabolized to MPP+ by the enzyme
  MAO-B in glial cells. Upon uptake via DA transporter, MPP+ inhibits mitochondrial
  complex I. Similar to MPTP, rotenone, dieldrin, and PQ inhibit the mitochondrial
  respiratory chain, induce increased ROS release, and alter epigenetic modifications
  directly or indirectly via mitonuclear communication. Rotenone and dieldrin can
  also favor ROS production through PKCδ and NOX1, while PQ induces the generation
  of superoxide by transforming from PQ2+ to PQ+. Like other pesticides, DDT exposure
  induces oxidative stress, and it also causes mitochondrial impairment by altering
  the gene expression of the apoptosis regulator Bcl-2. DTT also induces neuroinflammation
  through the NFκB pathway. Similarly, excessive Mn increases the levels of inflammatory
  mediators, such as NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα. Mn overload likely puts mitochondria
  under stress and promotes α-synuclein aggregation. V overexposure can not only induce
  neuroinflammation but also can bring about ROS production and DNA damage.
