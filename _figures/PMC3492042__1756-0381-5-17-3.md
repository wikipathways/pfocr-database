caption: MicroRNA targetome suggests aberrant upregulation of cell cycle regulators
  in AD brains. The targets for the set of miRNAs downregulated in AD brains were
  identified by searching them on the miRTarBase []. The expression of targets in
  the human brain was verified by searching them on UniGene. Overall, 852 theoretically
  upregulated target genes for the set of miRNAs downregulated in AD brains were imported
  into the Core Analysis tool of IPA. The canonical pathway defined by “Cyclins and
  Cell Cycle Regulation” showing a significant relationship with the targetome (p = 2.18E-19)
  is shown. The red nodes represent cell cycle regulators theoretically upregulated
  in AD brains.
