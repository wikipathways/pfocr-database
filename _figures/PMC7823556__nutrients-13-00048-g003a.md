caption: '(A) Gene set enrichment legend, (B) Gene ontology (GO) and (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome pathways from custom gene set collections.
  Legend shows enrichment tests were run for gene sets enriched in “up-regulated”,
  “down-regulated” or “up- and down-regulated (i.e., differentially expressed)” genes
  in 5X-MTHF compared to 5X-FA dams using Goseq. Node size is proportional to the
  number of genes in the pathway set, and the connecting line thickness is proportional
  to the number of identical genes in connected sets. Outer node colors represent
  the FDR with multiple test correction (BH, Benjamini-Hochberg’s procedure). An FDR
  ≤ 0.1 and p ≤ 0.005 was used for enrichment analyses. Genes of interests (*) were
  validated by qRT-PCR at birth and post-weaning. Red font indicates if the gene was
  up-regulated and blue font indicates down-regulated genes. The center node color
  represents the number of identical genes that were from this validated gene list
  by qRT-PCR that are enriched in other pathways, with 10 being the maximum number
  of validated genes in a single pathway. Gene set clusters from GO are shown with
  representative cluster terms. Validated Gene Abbreviations: Cck, cholecystokinin;
  Crh2, corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2; Esr1, estrogen receptor 1; Gaba4a,
  gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (Gaba) receptor alpha; Gabrd, gaba receptor delta;
  Gabre, gaba receptor epsilon; Grm2, glutamate receptor 2; Kiss1, kisspeptin; Prhr,
  prolactin hormone receptor; Prlhr, prolactin-releasing peptide.'
