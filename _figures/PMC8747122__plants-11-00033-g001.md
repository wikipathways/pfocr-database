caption: Schematic overview of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling in Arabidopsis.
  (A) Ethylene biosynthetic pathway. Amino acid methionine is converted into hormone
  ethylene by three families of enzymes, SAM synthetases that produce S-adenosyl-methionine
  out of methionine, ACC synthases that make 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid,
  and ACC oxidases that generate ethylene. Ethylene then diffuses out of and into
  plant cells. (B) Ethylene signaling pathway in the absence of ethylene. Ethylene
  receptors ETR1, ETR2, ERS1, ERS2, and EIN4 localized in the ER membrane activate
  CTR1 kinase, which in turn phosphorylates the C-terminal end of EIN2 (EIN2-CEND)
  and turns EIN2 off. The mRNAs for F-box proteins EBF1 and EBF2 are translated and
  target the master transcriptional regulators of ethylene signaling, EIN3 and EIL1,
  to proteasomes for protein turnover, thus preventing ethylene responses. (C) Ethylene
  signaling pathway in the presence of ethylene. Ethylene binding to the receptors
  shuts them off, CTR1 is inactivated, EIN2 is dephosphorylated and is cleaved by
  an unknown protease, thus releasing EIN2-CEND that functions in the cytoplasm and
  in the nucleus. In the cytosol, EIN2-CEND recruits EBF1 and EBF2 mRNAs to the P-bodies
  and inhibits their translation. In the nucleus, EIN2-CEND directly or indirectly
  potentiates the activity of EIN3 and EIL1. Ethylene-triggered stabilization of the
  EIN3/EIL1 transcription factors leads to the transcriptional regulation of multiple
  target genes, including induction of several members of the ERF gene family that
  encode transcription factors of the second tier of the ethylene response that propagate
  the EIN3/EIL1-triggered transcriptional programs. Positive interactions such as
  activation, production, and stabilization are represented with lines that end in
  an arrowhead →. Negative interactions such as inactivation and repression are represented
  by lines that end in a hammerhead ⊣. Images were created with BioRender.
