caption: Wnt signaling interacts with intercellular junction components. β-catenin
  is involved in Wnt signaling and focal adhesions. β-catenin is a key downstream
  target of the Wnt signaling pathway and is also an important part of intercellular
  junctions. The loss of cell-cell contact in the epithelium leads to the formation
  of cancer cells, which is the initial stage of the metastatic process. Miscellaneous
  miRs from previous screens discussed in the present review were identified to be
  involved in this complicated network. Wnt, wingless-related integration site; miR,
  microRNA; β-cat, β-catenin; α-cat, α-catenin; Frz, frizzy.
