caption: Shows a zoom-in into the phenylalanine metabolism through PAH and PAL enzymes,
  exhibiting the main metabolic enzymes involved in this pathway. It also illustrates
  how AAAD is involved not only phenylalanine and L-Dopa metabolism, but also in tryptophan
  metabolism and serotonin synthesis
