caption: Role of lncRNAs in EMT regulation via MAPK and TGFβ signaling pathways in
  CRC. PVT1 suppressed the growth and metastatic ability of cancer cells via miR-216a-5p
  sponging that resulted in YBX1 up regulation. SNHG16 regulated CRC cell proliferation,
  migration, invasion, and EMT via the miR-124-3p/MCP-1 axis. SNHG6 activated TGF-β/Smad
  signaling by binding UPF1 that increased tumor cell proliferation and metastasis.
  TUG1 promoted carcinogenesis and EMT in colon cancer by stimulating the P38MAPK/Hsp27
  axis. BANCR promoted CRC cell migration by EMT induction through the MEK/ERK pathway.
  NNT-AS1 regulated tumor cell proliferation and invasion by reducing the activity
  of MAPK/ERK pathway to suppress EMT. (Created with www.BioRender.com)
