caption: '(A) Vasorin 3D structure: Cartoon representation of the structure model
  of Vasn predicted by RaptorX (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/). It is represented in
  rainbow color from the N-terminus to the C-terminus, at the exception of the predicted
  signal peptide (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) colored in purple. The
  transmembrane fragment predicted by TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/)
  is localized at its place on the schematic membrane. The different predicted domains
  are indicated along the structure. The intracellular carboxy-terminal peptide with
  unknown structure is represented with a dotted line (). (B) Vasorin major pathways:
  Vasn was first described as an inhibitor of TGF-β pathway: the metalloprotease ADAM
  17 cleaves VASN and releases the soluble extracellular part of vasorin (sVASN).
  TGF-β binds to sVASN instead of TGFβRII. The hetero-tetrameric complex between TGF-β1
  and−2 is not formed and the sequence of intra-cellular phosphorylation does not
  occur [adapted from ()]. A second pathway was recently discovered showing that Notch1
  can be stabilized at the membrane by VASN, thus escaping Numb (an inhibitor of the
  activation of Notch signaling) mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. This
  bonding allows both extracellular cleavage by ADAM 10/17 and intracellular cleavage
  by the gamma secretase to cleave Notch1 intracellular peptide NICD1, which translocates
  to the nucleus to form a transcription complex [adapted from ()].'
