caption: Overview of BCAA and propionate metabolism and effects of HIBCH knockdown
  in cultured Huh7 hepatocytes. Down- and upregulated genes (from RNA-seq) are marked
  in blue and red colour, respectively. Increased and decreased net medium appearance
  of metabolites based on extracellular measurements are marked with dotted lines
  in blue and red colour, respectively. Genes and metabolites that are unchanged by
  HIBCH knockdown are marked in grey colour and black dotted lines, respectively.
