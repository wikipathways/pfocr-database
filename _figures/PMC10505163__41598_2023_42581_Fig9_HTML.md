caption: Hallmarks of severe asthma and the possible role of the identified mRNAs
  by artificial intelligence methods. (a) Airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation
  and (b) airway remodeling (epithelial layer alterations, thickness of airway sub
  epithelium and smooth muscle (ASM) along with bronchial neo angiogenesis) are involved
  in the pathogenesis of severe asthma. (c) The PTBP1 is an RNA-binding protein that
  is implicated in several biological pathways, particularly in the activation and
  regulation of the immune system. The PTBP1, as an alternative splicing factor, could
  affect different aspects of asthmatic immune responses, notably by increasing MCH
  II class and disturbing T cell hemostasis that can increase the intensity of the
  condition from moderate asthma to severe asthma. Moreover, the PTBP1 plays a key
  role in airway remodeling by inhibiting PTEN and stimulating AKT phosphorylation
  that can promote PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1/VEGF signaling pathway. TGF-β, NOVA1,
  and miR-124 can regulate the PTBP1. The MYD88 plays a crucial role in the immune
  response and functions as a remarkable member of TLR signaling pathways and IL-1,
  controlling the activation of several pro-inflammatory genes. The TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
  signaling pathway has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of asthma. DCs Dendritic
  cells, HIF-1α hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, NF-κB nuclear factor-kappa b, NOVA1
  neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1, PI3K phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PTBP1 polypyrimidine
  tract-binding protein, PTEN phosphatase and tensin homolog, SMCs smooth muscle cells,
  TCR T-cell receptor, TGF-β transforming growth factor-beta, TLR4 Toll-like receptor
  4, VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin.
