caption: 'Ceramides (Cer) are generated from the sphingomyelinase pathway and other
  pathways such as the salvage pathway and the de novo synthesis pathway (not shown
  in this scheme). Sphingosine (SPH) which can be formed from the degradation and
  recycling of complex sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids in an acidic environment
  (salvage pathway) may also contribute to Cer metabolism. SPH is phosphorylated by
  SPH kinase to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid intermediates with
  several effects. In addition to Cer, SPC is another biologically active lipid metabolite
  generated from sphingomyelin (SM) under the action of a SM-deacylase. Secreted SPC
  is likely a substrate for autotaxin (ATX), an exoenzyme with lysophospholipase D
  activity, which leads to S1P generation. Alternatively, S1P can be converted from
  SPC by ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases (ENPPs). SPC and S1P can
  both induce their effects through binding to G-protein coupled receptors present
  on different cell types. It cannot be excluded that an intracellular SPC—> S1P conversion
  also occurs by a yet unidentified SPC-ase, and not SPC but rather S1P is secreted
  from cells predominantly. Extracellular S1P might be converted back to SPC through
  not yet identified enzyme(s). Substantial amounts of extracellular SPC and S1P are
  loaded to preβ-HDL particles and therefore they may contribute to the composition
  and/or maturation of α-HDL lipoproteins. UC: unesterified cholesterol, PC: phosphatidylcholine,
  LPC: lysophosphatidylcholine, PM: plasma membrane.'
