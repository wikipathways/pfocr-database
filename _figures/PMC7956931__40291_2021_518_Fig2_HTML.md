caption: 'Simplified overview of EGFR pathway, with numbers of studies included per
  EGFR pathway inhibitor target. Important note: Several studies investigated more
  than one inhibitor; the total number of studies depicted in this figure exceeds
  the total number of inclusions. EGFR can be bound by natural ligands such as EGF,
  leading to dimerization of two EGFR monomers and subsequent activation of the intracellular
  tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR. This results in activation of the downstream signalling
  cascade via PI3K/AKT/mTOR or KRAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK, signalling resulting in cellular
  processes such as cell proliferation or differentiation. Illustration made with
