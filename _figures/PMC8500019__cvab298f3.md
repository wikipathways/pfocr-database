caption: Mechanisms of endothelial activation/dysfunction and immunothrombosis in
  COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 activates the endothelium, either directly by interacting with
  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor or indirectly by triggering hyperinflammation.
  Inflammatory cytokines induce the activation of tissue factor (TF) and exocytosis
  of Weibel Palade bodies (WPB) from endothelial cells, enhancing expression of P-selectin
  and E-selectin which in turn recruits’ neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. Monocytes/macrophages
  activate and deliver through their microvesicles, TF to the sites of SARS-CoV-2
  exposure, initiating the TF pathway activation (or extrinsic pathway). Neutrophils
  release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which capture SARS-CoV-2, promote
  thrombus formation activation of factor XII (contact or intrinsic pathway of coagulation
  cascade), and promote platelet recruitment by binding von Willebrand factor (vWF).
  The NETs propagate coagulation by inactivating endogens anticoagulants such as tissue
  factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin III (ATII). Concomitantly, thrombomodulin
  is shed from endothelial cells, which further promotes a procoagulant and pro-inflammatory
  milieu. Spike (S) protein binding to ACE2 endothelial receptor reduce angiotensin
  (Ang) II conversion to Ang 1-7. Accumulation of Ang II leads to plasminogen-activator
  inhibitor-type 1 (PAI-1) production inhibiting fibrinolysis and thrombus dissolution.
