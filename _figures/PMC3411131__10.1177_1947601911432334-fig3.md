caption: Signaling pathways in angiogenesis. The key cellular events associated with
  tumor angiogenesis are very similar to those described in developmental angiogenesis.
  A vascular sprout is composed of stalk cells and tip cells. The distinction between
  stalk and tip is conveyed by Notch signaling, which is higher in the stalk than
  in the tip cell. Tip cells received signals from a gradient of VEGF and from the
  Slit-Robo pathway.
