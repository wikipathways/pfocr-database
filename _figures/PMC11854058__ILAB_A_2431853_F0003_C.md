caption: Schematic of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation and inactivation.
  (1) Agonist (orange) binds to the GPCR, initiating conformational changes in the
  receptor, resulting in exchange of GDP for GTP at the G protein α-subunit. (2) The
  G protein α and βγ subunits dissociate and signaling is initiated. (3) GRK is recruited,
  displacing enzyme and phosphorylating the agonist-occupied receptor. (4) β-arrestin
  (βarr) forms a complex with the receptor. Some GPCRs are able to initiate signaling
  pathways that involve βarr. (5) The receptor is internalized at clathrin-coated
  pits which requires the heterotetrameric adaptor protein 2 (AP2), βarr, and clathrin
  proteins. (6) Internalized receptor is directed to the endosome, from which it can
  be directed to the lysosome for degradation, or (7) dephosphorylated receptor may
  be recycled to the plasma membrane [54]. GDP guanosine 5′-diphosphate, GTP guanosine
  5′-triphosphate
