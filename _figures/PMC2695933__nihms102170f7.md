caption: Comparison of VPC and HCG patterning networks in C. elegans and Pristionchus
  pacificus. In the C. elegans hermaphrodite, the EGF signal is produced by the anchor
  cell and induces the 1°VPC fate. The Wnt pathway is required for VPC competence
  and has a minor role in induction. In the C. elegans male, the EGF and Wnt pathways
  participate in HCG specification. However, the relative contributions of these two
  pathways in hook development are likely different from their contributions in vulval
  development, as Wnt signaling plays a relatively major role in this process. In
  response to a high level of Wnt and EGF signal(s), the LIN-17 and LET-23 receptors,
  respectively, on the cell surface of P11.p activate downstream pathways to specify
  the 1° fate, which produces ligands (DSL) for LIN-12/Notch. In P10.p, activated
  LIN-12/Notch signaling by the adjacent 1°P11.p cell acts with a weak Wnt and/or
  EGF signal to promote the 2°HCG fate. P9.p receives little (if any) signal, and
  therefore usually fuses with hyp7, adopting a 3° fate. In P. pacificus, different
  Wnt ligands act to induce as well as inhibit vulval development. A lateral signal
  from P6.p induces P5.p and P7.p. to adopt the 2° fates. It is not known if this
  is mediated by LIN-12/Notch.
