caption: 'Schematic representation of factors situated at the interface between the
  ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosome degradative systems. A: Molecular
  interface between the UPS and autophagy. Misfolded proteins may be degraded preferentially
  by the UPS or by autophagy, or even by both degradative pathways. The fate of a
  given protein is dictated first by its altered conformation, and/or by molecular
  determinants such as exposed hydrophobic amino acids, specific signals (degrons),
  or N-terminal specific amino acids. These misfolded proteins are then recognized
  by the front-line detectors constituted of chaperones (Hsp70, Hsc70 or Hsp90) and
  co-chaperones (Bag1, Bag3, CHIP, HspBP1, HSJ1, etc.) that will attempt to refold
  it, or will make decisions (triage) about refolding or degrading the substrate protein.
  For simplicity, the case of Hsp90 has not be treated in this figure (see reference
  [] for more details). Co-chaperones molecules can display a ubiquitin-ligase activity
  (CHIP), and recruit ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes such as Ubc4/5, or facilitate
  binding to the proteasome (Bag1). On the other hand, the co-chaperone Bag3 will
  favor K63- (Lysine 63) over K48-polyubiquitination (Lysine 48), and direct the substrate
  protein to autophagic degradation. The tagged protein is usually recognized then
  by several types of adaptor proteins that bring them to the proteasome or to autophagic
  vesicle. Certain adaptor proteins, such as p62, can play different roles for both
  degradative systems. There are proteins involved in the structure or in regulation
  of one degradative pathway, and are degraded by the second degradative system, that
  are thus contributing to the cross-talk between both systems (p53, LC3, or proteasome
  subunits, see text). At a higher level of integration, the degradative pathways
  are probably coordinated with more general homeostatic programs, such as response
  to stress factors (the ER stress response is one example of coordination of signaling
  pathways directing the activity of both degradative pathways). Another example of
  integrative program concerns the catabolic atrophy in muscles that involves the
  coordinating action of the FoxO transcription factors on both pathways. B: Energy
  interface as a possible balance element between UPS and autophagy activities. The
  UPS requires energy to assemble the proteasomal complex, activate ubiquitin, and
  unfold the substrate protein. Although the proteasome structure can be switched
  to an ATP-free one, and certain proteins can be degraded without needing ubiquitination,
  low levels of ATP may globally reduce the efficiency of this pathway. Conversely,
  low level of ATP, amino acids (a.a.), glucids or anabolic hormones (insulin, insulin-like
  growth ractor (IGF-1)) results in the activation of autophagy. Amino acids resulting
  from protein degradation may either be used for the synthesis of new proteins, sparing
  thus energy for their de novo synthesis (except for essential amino acids that have
  to be brought by nutrition), or may be totally degraded through a catabolic pathway
  to recover new energy.'
