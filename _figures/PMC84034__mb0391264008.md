caption: A model for Shp-2 functions in promoting cell growth and survival. We and
  others have shown previously that protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 promotes mitogenic
  signaling pathways. Evidence is presented in this study that Shp-2 also acts as
  a survival factor in protecting cells against the cytotoxic effect of IFNs through
  modulation of Jak/STAT activities. Therefore, we propose a model in which the positive
  role of Shp-2 in cell growth and survival is contributed by its promotion of mitogenic
  signals and suppression of Jak/STAT activities.
