caption: 'In the presence of certain lesions/obstructions (denoted by red triangle)
  on the parental strands, replication fork progression is inhibited by blockage of
  replicative synthesis of the relevant daughter strand. The blocked fork may then
  be subject to regression to generate a Holliday junction or chicken foot structure,
  aided physically by superhelical tension (positive supercoiling) generated ahead
  of the fork during DNA replication and/or enzymatically by WRN or BLM. Left pathway:
  the regressed fork regenerates a normal DNA duplex in the vicinity of the lesion,
  facilitating its recognition and removal by standard repair pathways including nucleotide
  excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER). Reverse branch migration,
  catalyzed by WRN or BLM, re-establishes the replication fork structure, now without
  the blocking lesion. Center pathway (regions of particular interest denoted with
  broken orange circle): Extension of the unblocked daughter strand prior to regression
  provides for template switching and limited synthesis of the blocked daughter strand
  (denoted in green) once regression has occurred. In this case, reverse branch migration
  catalyzed by either WRN or BLM results in error-free lesion bypass (with the lesion
  presumably repaired at a later time). In these scenarios, WRN- or BLM-mediated re-establishment
  of the normal replication fork structure facilitates replication restart without
  replication errors or generation of double-strand breaks. Right pathway: In the
  absence of WRN or BLM, replication forks collapse either directly or through processing
  or resolution of regressed Holliday junction structures, resulting in formation
  of double-strand breaks. These breaks serve as substrates for RAD51-mediated homologous
  recombination processes that can potentially restart replication through the break-induced
  replication (BIR) pathway. However, these unscheduled recombination events may be
  prone to errors, leading to the types of chromosomal aberrations associated with
  WRN or BLM deficiency. Throughout the diagram, parental and daughter strands are
  denoted in black and blue, respectively, with continuous regions of DNA indicated
  by dotted lines.'
