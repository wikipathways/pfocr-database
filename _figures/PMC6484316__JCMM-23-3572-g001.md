caption: The study hypothesis and design. A, We suggested that that miR‐148a inhibits
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through the inactivation of the phosphoryl‐ERK/hypoxia‐inducible
  factor‐1α (pERK/HIF‐1α) pathway. B, In vitro, we transfected miR‐148a into HCT116
  and HT29 cells and established stable colorectal cancer (CRC) clones. The protein
  levels of pERK and HIF‐1α were examined through Western blotting and the mRNA levels
  of HIF‐1α were tested through RT‐PCR. The protein expression of VEGF was examined
  through ELISA
