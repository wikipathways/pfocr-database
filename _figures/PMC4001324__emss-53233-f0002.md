caption: Depiction of the process of selfish spermatogonial selection in the testis
  and its consequences for the offspring. The pink oval (left) represents the testis
  of an aging man in which mutations (represented by X or circles) have occurred randomly
  during the recurrent rounds of replication required for spermatogenesis. In gray
  (bottom of the diagram), functionally neutral mutations are not enriched in spermatogonial
  progenitors and are associated with a very low risk of transmission of individual
  genetic lesions in the offspring. In purple (top of the diagram), the mutant spermatogonial
  progenitor carries a ‘strong-effect’ mutation that is associated with overt dysregulation
  of the RTK/RAS pathway – such as a typical oncogenic mutation. These paternal age-effect
  mutations confer a strong selective advantage (represented by the thickness of the
  purple arrow) to the mutant spermatogonial stem cell, leading over time to the formation
  of large clones and relative enrichment in mutant sperm. Upon germline transmission
  to the offspring, strong paternal age-effect mutations can cause neonatal lethality
  or disease phenotypes and are eliminated by purifying selection as affected individuals
  are unlikely to reproduce. In red and orange (middle part of the diagram), are depicted
  intermediate scenarios for mutations with milder selective advantage (i.e. mutation
  of variable penetrance, weak gain-of-function) that are enriched over time in spermatogonial
  stem cells to a lesser extent (>1- to 100-fold). Unlike the strong effect mutations
  (purple), mildly pathogenic mutations are potentially transmissible over many generations,
  contributing to genetic heterogeneity and variable expressivity of disease phenotypes.
