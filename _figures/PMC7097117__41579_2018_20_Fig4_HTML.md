caption: Viral immune-evasion strategies have been identified that target the ubiquitin-like
  protein ISG15 pathway. Certain viruses, for example, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV),
  and hepatitis C virus (HCV),, suppress the expression of ISG15 at the transcriptional
  level. Vaccinia virus E3L and HCMV pUL26 (ref.) proteins bind to ISG15 to inhibit
  ISG15 conjugation by undefined mechanisms. HCMV pUL26 (ref.), influenza A virus
  (IAV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
  (KSHV) viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF1) also interact with an E3 ISG15–protein
  ligase HERC5 to reduce protein conjugation by ISG15. Even when the viral and host
  proteins are conjugated to ISG15, viruses have also developed strategies to deconjugate
  or sequester ISGylated viral proteins. Influenza B virus (IBV) NS1 protein counteracts
  ISG15 antiviral activity by sequestering ISGylated viral proteins, particularly
  viral nucleoproteins (NPs), to prevent their incorporation into NP oligomers, thus
  disrupting viral RNA synthesis. Several virus families encode enzymes possessing
  deISGylase activities, including papain-like protease (PLpro) of coronaviruses and
  viral ovarian tumour domain (OTU) proteases of nairoviruses and arteriviruses, to
  remove ISG15 from conjugated proteins. CCHFV, Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever virus;
  DUGV, Dugbe virus; EAV, equine arteritis virus; HERC5, E3 ISG15–protein ligase HERC5;
  HERC6, E3 ISG15–protein ligase HERC6; IE1, immediate-early protein 1; ISRE, interferon-stimulated
  response elements; MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; NS3, non-structural protein
  3; PRRSV, porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus; RNAP II, RNA polymerase
  II; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; TRIM25, E3 ubiquitin/ISG15 ligase;

  enzyme E2 L6; UBE1L, ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 homologue; USP18, Ubl carboxy-terminal
