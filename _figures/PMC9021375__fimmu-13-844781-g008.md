caption: 'The role of LPA3 protects against the organism by affecting the TLR4 signaling
  pathway and NETs release. During sepsis, LPA3 deficiency monocytes are stimulated
  to express more quantities of CD14, which interacts with LPS and activates TLR4
  signaling pathway. Activation of the TLR4-MyD88-p65 NFκB signaling pathway controls
  inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) release, induces excessive NETs, further
  causes thrombosis and tissue damage. (2S)-OMPT, the agonist of LPA3, inhibits the
  inflammatory cytokines and NETs formation, reduces tissue damage and septic lethality,
  to be a therapeutic improvement in sepsis treatment. Illustration created with BioRender.
  Abbreviations: LPA3, lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3; NETs, neutrophil extracellular
  traps; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4. (2S)-OMPT; (2S)-1-oleoyl-2-methylglycero-3-phosphothionate.'
