caption: CCR7-stimulated phosphorylation-inhibition of AMPK. Stimulation of CCR7 with
  CCL19 or CCL21 induces Gi,Gβγ-mediated activation of the kinases MEK1/2/ERK1/2.
  CCR7 also induces activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1/4EBP1 and S6K pathways, which
  promote survival in mDCs. Active AMPK induces apoptosis in mDCs by inhibiting the
  pro-survival effects of mTORC1 and by promoting translocation of the transcription
  factor FOXO to the nucleus, where it can control the expression of the pro-apoptotic
  Bcl2 family member Bim. Stimulation of CCR7 regulates, through the Gi,Gβγ/MEK1/2-ERK1/2
  pathway (and independently of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1pathway), the phosphorylation of
  the kinase AMPK on Ser-485, which results in the inhibition of this kinase and the
  consequent dampening of its pro-apoptotic effects. Therefore, CCR7 promotes survival
  in DCs through Akt-dependent mechanisms described previously () and by promoting
  MEK/ERK-dependent inhibition of AMPK.
