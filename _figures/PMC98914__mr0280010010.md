caption: Pheromone response pathway of S. pombe. Ste11 is a key regulator of sexual
  differentiation in S. pombe. Its transcription is induced by the Sty pathway in
  response to nitrogen starvation (right) (also see Fig. ). Its activity may be regulated
  by the Spk1 MAPK (middle). Ras1 and Gα-GTP are both necessary for activation of
  the pheromone response MAPK cascade. The target genes for this pathway include the
  pheromone precursor and receptor genes, the ste6 gene (encoding the GEF for Ras1),
  fus1 (required for cell fusion), mat1-Pm and mat1-Mm, and other genes (Table ).
  Nitrogen starvation is indispensable for the pheromone response, since addition
  of pheromones to cells growing in rich medium does not elicit the mating response.
  Ras1 is proposed to regulate a morphogenetic cascade (left) by activation of Scd1
  (a proposed GEF for Cdc42). Cdc42 in turn activates Shk1, a Ste20 homolog. See the
  text for details. Solid arrows indicate activation; dashed arrows indicate that
  evidence is limited or nonexistent.
