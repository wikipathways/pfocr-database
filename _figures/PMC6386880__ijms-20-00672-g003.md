caption: The AvrPphB effector protease from P. syringae acts as a double sword in
  the plant response to bacterial infection. (A) After the recognition of flagellin
  by FLS2, AvrPphB degrades the botrytis-induced kinase 1 (BIK1) of the active receptor
  complex and blocks the pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) pathway [,]. (B) Alternatively,
  AvrPphB may cut the PBS1 protein, which is guarded by the RPS5 (resistance to Pseudomonas
  syringae 5) protein. RPS5 becomes activated and induces the effector-triggered immunity
  (ETI) response [].
