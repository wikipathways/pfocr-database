caption: Synthesis of the 1,2,4-triazole series (14) in an analogous fashion was unsuccessful
  in which the side chain nucleophilic addition to the corresponding methyl ester
  failed to afford product. Therefore, an alternative approach was utilized to obtain
  the desired 1,2,4-triazoles (). 7-Phenylheptanal was converted to the silyl-protected
  cyanohydrin upon treatment with potassium cyanide, TBSCl, and catalytic ZnI2. The
  corresponding amidrazone was formed by in situ generation of sodium hydrazine followed
  by dropwise addition of the cyanohydrin, which was treated with an aryl(R) acid
  chloride. Surprisingly, the cyclization afforded mainly the 1,3,4-oxadiazole product
  along with a small amount of the desired 1,2,4-triazole product. Although this offered
  an additional route to the 1,3,4-oxadiazoles, it required modification for 1,2,4-triazole
  formation. The alternative was a two-step condensation and oxidation pathway via
  reaction of the amidrazone with aryl(R) aldehydes to give a stable imine, which
  undergoes oxidative cyclization to the triazole upon treatment with DDQ. The desired
  1,2,4-triazoles 14 were obtained after TBS deprotection (Bu4NF) and oxidation of
  the liberated alcohol with Dess–Martin periodinane ().
