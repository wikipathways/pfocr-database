caption: 'Then, 3-ketosphinganine reductase (KSR) mediates the reduction of 3KSa to
  sphinganine d18:0 (Sa), which is transformed into dihydroceramide (DHCer) through
  acylation by ceramide synthases (CerSs). Ceramide (Cer) is formed through the introduction
  of an (E)-4 double bond into dhCer by dihydroceramide desaturase (Des1). Once formed,
  Cer can be degraded through the catabolic route, which involves N-deacylation to
  sphingosine (So, sphinganine d18:1) by ceramidases, further phosphorylation to sphingosine
  1-phosphate (S1P) and final irreversible cleavage by S1P lyase (). Cer is the core
  structure of all complex SLs, which are generated by attachment of different polar
  head groups at the primary alcohol group (C1–OH) of a ceramide molecule. Depending
  on the type of polar group, two major classes have been defined: phosphosphingolipids
  (such as ceramide-1-p [C1P] and sphingomyelin [SM]) and glycosphingolipids (GSLs)
  (). GSLs are a heterogeneous group of membrane lipids formed by a Cer backbone covalently
  linked to a glycan moiety. Because these molecules are produced from Cer precursors,
  they may also have differences in their acyl chain composition, revealing an additional
  layer of variation. GSLs are divided broadly into two categories: glucosphingolipids
  and galactosphingolipids. Glucosphingolipids depend initially on the enzyme glucosylceramide
  (GlcCer) synthase (GCS), which attaches glucose as the first residue to the C1 hydroxyl
  position ().'
