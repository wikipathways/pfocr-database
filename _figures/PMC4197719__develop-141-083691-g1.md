caption: Mechanism of canonical HH signal transduction in vertebrates. (A) In the
  absence of hedgehog (HH) ligand, patched 1 (PTCH) localizes to the primary cilium
  where it prevents activation of smoothened (SMO), which is sequestered into endocytic
  vesicles (circle). Microtubule motors within the cilium form the intraflagellar
  transport (IFT) machinery responsible for shuttling components of the HH signaling
  pathway, including small amounts of the glioma-associated oncogene proteins (GLIs),
  in and out of the cilium. At the base of the cilium, the GLI proteins (GLI2 and
  GLI3) are phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), casein kinase 1α (CK1) and glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which results in their proteolytic cleavage and removal
  of the C-terminal ‘activator’ domain (green), generating GLI2R and GLI3R (red),
  which then suppress transcription of HH target genes in the nucleus. (B) HH signaling
  is activated upon binding of the ligand to PTCH proteins, which leads to their exiting
  the cilium and SMO subsequently entering. With the help of the IFT, the GLIs accumulate
  in the ciliary tip and then exit the cilium as full-length transcriptional activators
  (GLI2A and GLI3A). GLIA isoforms translocate to the nucleus, where they induce expression
  of HH target genes, including the transcriptional activator Gli1. The PTCH-bound
  HH ligand is internalized and degraded.
