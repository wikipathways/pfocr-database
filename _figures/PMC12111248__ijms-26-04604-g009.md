caption: Schematic diagram of cdh23 regulating rod cell calcium ion transport (image
  created by Figdraw). (A) In WT rod photoreceptor cells, genes such as Rho, Rhol,
  Grk1, Grk7a, Gnat1, Pde6a, Pde6b, and Guca1b play essential roles in phototransduction.
  Additionally, Atp2b1b is responsible for transport of calcium ions (Ca2+). Rhodopsin
  is synthesized in endoplasmic reticulum of inner segment (IS) and transported to
  outer segment (OS) through vesicular transport from Golgi apparatus, with IS and
  OS being connected by connecting cilium. Purine metabolism generates sufficient
  ATP to properly position rhodopsin in outer segment. Upon light stimulation, rhodopsin
  undergoes conformational change, activating Gt transducin protein, which subsequently
  activates phosphodiesterase (PDE). PDE hydrolyzes cGMP, leading to decrease in its
  concentration, which causes closure of CNG channels. This reduces inward flow of
  Ca2+ and release of neurotransmitter glutamate, completing phototransduction process.
  (B) In cdh23−/− embryos, disrupted purine metabolism leads to insufficient ATP production,
  impairing vesicle transport from Golgi apparatus and movement of cilium. As a result,
  rhodopsin fails to localize properly to outer segment, preventing cGMP hydrolysis
  by PDE. Increased cGMP concentration activates CNG channels, causing continuous
  inward flux of Ca2+, which activates Ca2+-dependent MAPK signaling pathway and triggers
  apoptosis in rod photoreceptor cells
