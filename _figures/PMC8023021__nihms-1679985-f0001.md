caption: Ceramide biosynthesis pathways (adapted from ref ). Various biosynthetic
  routes to ceramide are depicted for Cer(d18:1/18:1(9Z)). De novo pathway, salvage
  pathway, and sphingomyelin hydrolysis are highlighted in purple, orange, and cyan,
  respectively. Other sources of ceramide include glucocerebrosidase (gray), galactocerebrosidase
  (green), and ceramide-1-phosphate phosphatase (beige).
