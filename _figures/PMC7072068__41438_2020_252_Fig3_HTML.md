caption: 'Aspects of hormone homeostasis, transport, and signaling resulting in fruit
  set and early fruit development in diploid or octoploid strawberry have been implied
  from multiple transcriptome studies. Hormone metabolism genes are indicated in red,
  hormone transporters in blue, and hormone signaling components are indicated in
  purple. However, many question remain to be resolved (dashed lines) regarding pathway
  components for the two major hormones, auxin and gibberellin. These components need
  to be known before we can ask questions about how the genes involved in the process
  are regulated. Over 50 years have passed since auxin was identified as being required
  for receptacle enlargement, yet a fundamental question remains: what is it about
  fertilization that turns on the production of auxin? What form(s) of the hormones
  are transported from the ovule to stimulate growth of the receptacle, and what are
  the transporters involved? Which of the auxin and gibberellin responsive genes are
  critical to fruit enlargement?'
