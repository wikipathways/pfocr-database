caption: 'Proposed cadaverine catabolic pathway in Arabidopsis. By the action of exogenous
  La‐L/ODC, l‐lysine is converted into cadaverine, which further undergoes three major
  catabolic pathways: 1, oxidation leading to biosynthesis of δ‐valerolactam and alkaloid‐like
  metabolites; 2, N‐acetylation; and 3, conjugation with p‐coumaroyl‐CoA. In pathway 1,
  cadaverine is oxidized to 5‐aminopentanal, and then this metabolite is further converted
  into either 5‐aminopentanoate and δ‐valerolactam or is spontaneously transformed
  into Δ1‐piperideine to lead to compounds such as (R)‐pelletierine‐like and slaframine‐like
  metabolites. Pathways 2 and 3 form N‐acetylcadaverine and p‐coumaroylcadaverine,
  respectively. Enzymes in red have been shown to exhibit activity towards cadaverine
  or cadaverine catabolites. The activities of AtALDH10A8 and AtALDH10A9 against 5‐aminopentanal
  were confirmed in this study. Abbreviations: AtACT, agmatine coumaroyltransferase;
  AtALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; AtNATA1, N‐acetyltransferase activity1; AtAO1, amine
  oxidase1; La‐L/ODC, lysine/ornithine decarboxylase.'
