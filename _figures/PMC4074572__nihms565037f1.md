caption: 'In renal fibroblasts, through binding to IGF-IR and via the activation of
  the PI3K and Akt/PKB pathways and mTOR, decorin induces the translation of fibrillin-1,
  a regulator of TGF-β availability. In tubular epithelial cells decorin reduces apoptosis
  through interaction with IGF-IR and activation of downstream PI3K/Akt/PKB pathway.
  Additionally, decorin can bind CTGF (CCN2) and reduce the CTGF-induced levels of
  collagen III and fibronectin. Soluble biglycan binds to both TLR2 and 4 and via
  MyD88 activates the Erk, p38 and NF-κB pathways. This leads to the synthesis of
  pro-IL-1β, TNF-α, and the chemoattractants CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL3 and CCL5. The inflammasome
  complex NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 can also be induced by soluble biglycan, leading
  to activation of caspase-1 which cleaves pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β.Abbreviations:
  ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD; CCL, Chemokine (C-C
  motif) ligand; CTGF/CCN2, connective tissue growth factor; CXCL, Chemokine (C-X-C
  motif) ligand; Erk, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase; IGF-IR, insulin-like
  growth factor type I receptor; IL-1β, interleukin 1β; mTOR, mammalian target of
  rapamycin; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88; NF-κB, nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells; NLRP3, NLR family, pyrin domain–containing
  3; PI3K, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; TLR,
  Toll-like receptor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α.'
