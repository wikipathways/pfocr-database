caption: CD38 treatment and PD-1/PD-L1. Nivolumab significantly reduced the number
  of non-reactive T cells and increased the number of activated T cells expressing
  CD38. Activated CD38+ TILs produced cytotoxic compounds and inflammatory cytokines,
  such as IFN-γ to upregulate the immune response and exert pro-inflammatory effects
  on immune infiltration and tumor cells. However, CD38 is usually upregulated after
  a period of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. The adenosine activity of CD38 in turn leads
  to the inhibition of CD8+ T cells, which might partly explain the high drug resistance
  rate observed in patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blockers. Pharmacological targeting
  of the adenosine pathway could reverse the immunosuppression caused by the upregulation
  of CD38.
