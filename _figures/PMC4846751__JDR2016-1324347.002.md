caption: Schematic representation of the proposed role of EP4-mediated signaling under
  myocardial ischemia. During cardiac ischemia, increased PGE2 level may be a consequence
  of increased hypoxia inducible factor- (HIF-) 1α/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activation.
  PGE2 may play a beneficial role in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury through EP4/cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) or EP4/signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway. In addition, synthesized
  PGE2 in cardiomyocytes also diffuses into adjacent infiltrated macrophages or other
  inflammatory cells, protects the heart from ischemia/reperfusion injury through
  binding with EP4 receptor, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects.
