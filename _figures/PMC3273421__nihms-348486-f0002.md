caption: Myostatin and activin signaling in muscle. Myostatin or activin binds to
  type IIB activin receptor (ActRIIB) on muscle membrane to cause its dimerization,
  which leads to recruitment and activation of type I activin receptor transmembrane
  kinase ALK4 or ALK5. This in turn causes phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 and
  the recruitment of Smad4 into a Smad complex. The Smad complex translocates into
  the nucleus to elicit transcription changes of downstream genes, which result in
  muscle wasting. Myostatin/activin binding to the receptor also reduces AKT activity
  and consequently diminishes FOXO phosphorylation. Dephosphrylated FOXO enters the
  nucleus to activate transcription of atrophy-specific E3 ligases MuRF1 and Atrogin1,
  which cause muscle protein uniquitination and degradation by the proteasome. (SBE
  = S mad binding element; Ub = Ubiquitin).
