caption: Genetic regulation of HSC (hematopoietic stem cell) dynamics. Hematopoietic
  stem cells give rise to all the differentiated cell types in the blood. Key signaling
  pathways regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and self-renewal of HSCs
  are shown. Upregulation of Wnt signaling generally increases HSC and progenitor
  proliferation as well as increasing HSC survival and number during embryonic development.
  Notch signaling maintains the multipotency of the lymphoid and myeloid progenitors.
  Hedgehog and TGF-β increase LSK HSCs. Increased JAK/STAT, on the other hand, decreases
  the number of LSK HSCs, decreases repopulation capacity, and increases proliferation.
  Downregulation of the MAPK pathway causes HSC attrition, with bone marrow aplasia,
  anemia, leukopenia, and inhibited differentiation. Inhibition of MAPK signaling
  is reported to promote self-renewal as well.
