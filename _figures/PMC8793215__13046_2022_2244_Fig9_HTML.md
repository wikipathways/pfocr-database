caption: Graphic abstract. High level of ROS in cancer cells decrease tumor exosomal
  miR-155-5p that is taken up by macrophages to create an immunosuppressive microenvironment
  by upregulation of PD-L1 and other immunosuppressive factors that foster ovarian
  cancer development. Increase of tumor exo-miR-155 prevents ROS-mediated suppressive
  tumor immune response in ovarian cancer
