caption: Schematic illustrating the proposed mechanism of neuroprotective role of
  TAK1 inhibition by OZ. TAK1 plays a central role in several signaling pathways involved
  in early brain injury after SAH. As illustrated, several toxic stimuli (e.g. TNF-α
  and IL-1β) induced by SAH cause an increase in TAK1 activity in neurons, leading
  to NF-κB, JNK, and p38 activation, which further activate the apoptotic pathway.
  Inhibition of TAK1 by OZ will block the signal transduction to protect the neurons
  from apoptosis, eventually prevent the EBI.
