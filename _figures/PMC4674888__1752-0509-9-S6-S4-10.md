caption: Cell cycle Role of SCF complex in cell cycle regulation which is the third
  scored pathway map in MetaCore enrichment analysis results. The Skp, Cullin, F-box
  containing complex (SCF complex) play critical roles in the ubiquitination of proteins
  involved in cell cycle regulation. Ubiquitin was down-regulated in stoke samples
  at 3, 5, 24 hours and overall stroke samples as compared with control. NEDD8 was
  up-regulated in stoke samples at 5 hours and overall stroke samples.
