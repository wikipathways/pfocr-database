caption: 'Simplified graphical model of DEAR1 regulation of luminal differentiation
  via TGF-β dependent and indepdendent mechanisms of SNAI2 inhibition. Top: DEAR1
  inhibits SNAI2 (red pathway) by direct binding and uibiquitination, as well as by
  blocking SNAI2 transcription by binding and ubiquitinating upstream activator SMAD3
  that is activated by TGF-β (green pathway). Bottom: Shifts in luminal differentiation
  dynamics or state occupancies (as depicted by arrow sizes, where larger size indicates
  higher likelihood) of luminal progenitors (blue), toward incomplete basal-like (green)
  or mature luminal cells (pink), depending on the presence (black) or absence (gray)
  of DEAR1,SNAI2, and TGF-β. The figure was created using Adobe Illustrator 2020 (Version
  24.2.3), https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html.'
