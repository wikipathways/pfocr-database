caption: 'This representation of the hypotheses presented in the text helps explain
  cellular innate responses to CVB infection. Viral RNA (blue lines) releases the
  CARD domains of the cytosolic RNA sensors (RIG-I and MDA5) from their RD. By binding
  to MAVS (yellow bar), a signal transduction cascade is triggered, leading to induction
  of type I IFNs etc (lower right of cartoon). However, we speculate that MAVS binding
  has additional effects. We propose that mitochondria act as a bridge (green arrow)
  between the cytosolic RNA sensors (RIG-I, MDA5) and the intravesicular TLRs, as
  follows: mitochondrial depolarization occurs, upregulating autophagy; this increases
  the uptake of viral RNA into the autophagy pathway, thereby introducing this RNA
  to the nucleic acid-sensing TLRs (red ovals) in acidified autolysosomes. A positive-feedback
  loop (yellow arrow) ensures the rapid amplification of these RLR-initiated, TLR-propagated
  innate responses. Finally, we suggest that, as infection progresses within the cell,
  viral proteins may become sufficiently abundant to obviate the feedback loop by
  inhibiting autophagosomal maturation (┴), thereby limiting the amount of viral RNA
  that encounters TLRs.CARD: Caspase-recruitment domain; CVB: Type B coxsackieviruses;
  MAVS: Mitochondrial antiviral signaling; RD: Repressor domains; RLR: RIG-I-like
  receptor; TLR: Toll-like receptor.'
