caption: Schematic representation of quinone bioactivation mainly by two-electron
  reduction (two red circles). While activation of CoQ10 preferentially occurs via
  the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC), idebenone is activated to the
  hydroquinone by the cytoplasmic NQO1 reductase. In contrast, one electron reduction
  (one red circle) to the unstable semiquinone is mostly done by the Cyp450 family
  in the absence of two-electron-transferring reductases and is not a favourable pathway
  as it generates oxidative radicals.
