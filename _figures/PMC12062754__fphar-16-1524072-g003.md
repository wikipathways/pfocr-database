caption: 'Overview of how FNC fights tumors through various pathways (A) FNC induces
  cell death by lowering Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 levels and activating caspase-3, which breaks
  down key proteins like PARP. FNC also prevents Raji and JeKo-1 cells from sticking,
  moving, and invading by increasing E-cadherin and GSK-3β and decreasing β-catenin,
  VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is important in cancer growth,
  and changes in this pathway are linked to tumor invasiveness. FNC causes cell cycle
  arrest at G1/S or G2/M phases and induces apoptosis. It stops cell cycle checkpoints,
  like Cyclin-A binding to CDK2, allowing cells to finish the S phase and move to
  the M phase (B) Graphic Abstract, shows the mechanisms of FNC anticancer and antiviral
  activities. Abbreviations*HIV: human immunodeficiency virus, HCV: hepatitis C virus,
