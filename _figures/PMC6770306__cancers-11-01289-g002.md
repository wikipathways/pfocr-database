caption: 'The DNA damage response network in SCLC cells. (A) The roles of the ATR-CHK1
  signaling cascade in response to replication stress, replication protein A (RPA)
  is first loaded onto long stretches of single-strand DNA (ssDNA). The ATR was then
  recruited to the ssDNA sites through interaction with ATRIP. Once activated, ATR-mediated
  activation of CHK1 then transmits signals of replication stress through multiple
  mechanisms. (B) Once persistent replication stress cannot be fixed, replication
  forks then collapse into double-strand breaks (DSBs). In response to DSBs, SCLC
  cancer cells activate two major DSB repair pathways: Homologous recombination (HR)
  and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Crucial proteins involved in the HR repair
  pathway include BRCA1/2, CHK1/2, RAD51, ATM, etc.; the core components of the NHEJ
  repair pathway comprise KU70/80, XRCC4, DNA-PK, etc. Thus, constitutive activation
  of the replication stress response (RSR) pathway and DSB repair system is crucial
  for maintaining SCLC cell survival.'
