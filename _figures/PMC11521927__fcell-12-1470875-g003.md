caption: The various signaling pathways activated by TGF-β1 stimulation and their
  partial cross-talk are outlined. The TGF-β1/Smad pathway is initiated when the TGF-β1
  ligand binds to its receptors on the cell membrane, leading to the phosphorylation
  of Smad2/3 proteins. These phosphorylated Smads subsequently associate with Smad4
  to form a trimeric complex that translocates into the nucleus, where it regulates
  the transcription and translation of fibrosis-related genes, thereby inducing EMT.
  Concurrently, TGF-β receptors recruit ShcA to initiate downstream signaling mediators
  Grb2 and SOS, thereby activating the Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK pathways. Furthermore,
  TGF-β receptors can simultaneously activate the JNK and PI3K/AKT pathways via TRAF6.
  Likewise, in the pathogenesis of IPF, miRNAs not only regulate the TGF-β1/Smad signaling
  pathway but also serve as regulatory factors within this pathway. Additionally,
  they can interconnect the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, thereby establishing a complex
  regulatory network that sustains the pathological phenotype. This may open new avenues
  for utilizing miRNAs as more specific therapeutic agents for IPF. This figure is
