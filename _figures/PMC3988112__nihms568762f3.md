caption: The sphingolipids consist in a ceramide molecule attached to a long-chain
  sphingoid base (sphingosine), which is bound to a long-chain fatty acid. The degradation
  of specific sphingolipids requires specific enzymes, which are depicted here in
  each step of the pathway. The correspondent lysosomal storage disease (underlined)
  associated with each enzyme (italic) is also shown. Some the lysosomal enzymes need
  co-factors called sphingolipid activator proteins for the catalysis of their specific
  substrates. Examples of these co-factors are a group of proteins called saponins
  (Sap), here described as Sap A, B, C and D.
