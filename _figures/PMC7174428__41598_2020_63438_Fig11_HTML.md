caption: Model of alteration of NF-κB and ERK signaling pathways during HSV-1 infection
  and MG132-treatment. When an HSV-1 virion infects the host cell, it activates NF-κB
  signaling through IκBα destabilization, but suppresses c-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling
  by proteasome-mediated downregulation of Ras-GRF2. However, MG132-treatment during
  HSV-infection suppresses HSV-induced NF-κB activation, whereas MG132 overcomes HSV-1
  suppression of ERK signaling. The inhibition of ERK by PD98059 facilitates viral
  replication, whereas NF-κB suppression by BAY11-7082 has no effect. In sum, MG132
  activates ERK signaling and thereby reduces viral replication, demonstrating anti-HSV-1
  activity. HSV-1-mediated NF-κB activation might be involved in cellular functions
  such as innate immune responses.
