caption: Metabolism of sugars and 2,3-butanediol production by P. carbinolicus. The
  phosphotransferase system (right) consists of two enzymes (PtsI, PtsP) that take
  a phosphate (circled P) from phosphoenolpyruvate, a phosphocarrier protein (PtsH),
  two signal output proteins (PtsII A), and a tripartite transporter complex (PtsII
  BCD) that imports and phosphorylates sugars yet to be identified. Glycolysis of
  a sugar (e.g. glucose-6-phosphate) yields NADH, ATP and two phosphoenolpyruvate
  molecules, which can either bring in two sugar molecules or yield two ATP or enter
  a third pathway through phosphonopyruvate (bottom right). The oxidative pentose-phosphate
  pathway from glucose-6-phosphate to ribulose-5-phosphate (which is recycled into
  glycolytic intermediates) yields no ATP, but by making NADPH instead of NADH, it
  may facilitate production of hydrogen/formate. If pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin
  oxidoreductase does not function catabolically in P. carbinolicus (middle), there
  will be insufficient acetyl-CoA for ethanol production to dispose of NADH from glycolysis,
  and the only source of doubly reduced ferredoxin (Fd2e) for hydrogen/formate production
  will be the Rnf complex. Production of acetoin and 2,3-butanediol (left), which
  P. carbinolicus can degrade to acetyl-CoA later, disposes of half the NADH from
  glycolysis.
