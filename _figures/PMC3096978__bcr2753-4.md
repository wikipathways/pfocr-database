caption: Functional network connections between HRneg/Tneg signature genes. (a) Pathway
  diagram linking HRneg/Tneg genes with common upstream regulators. (b) Pathway diagram
  linking HRneg/Tneg genes with common downstream effectors. (c) Pathway diagram linking
  HRneg/Tneg genes by their shortest path. (a-c) Genes associated with positive hazard
  ratios are red, and those associated with negative hazard ratios are green. Arrows
  with + denote upregulation, and those with ┴ denote inhibition. Solid lines signify
  direct gene-gene interactions, and broken lines represent relationships that may
  require secondary effectors not depicted in the network. HRneg, hormone receptor-negative;
  Tneg, triple-negative.
