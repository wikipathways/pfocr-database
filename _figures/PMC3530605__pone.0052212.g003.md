caption: Under present-day conditions (∼38.5 Pa CO2), calcification (C) in the coccolith
  vesicle, and photosynthetic dark reaction (DR) occurring in the chloroplast compete
  for acquired inorganic carbon (Ci, red). DR fixes Ci into organic carbon (blue)
  that is channeled through glycolysis (GL) towards mitochondrial oxidation in the
  tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). NADH (purple star) produced in GL and TCA is used
  to drive mitochondrial ATP generation at the respiratory chain (RC). NADPH (orange
  star) created in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and photosynthetic light reactions
  (LR) is used to produce reduced storage compounds like glucans (G) and lipids (L).
  Under future conditions (∼101.3 Pa CO2), gene expression (GE) is altered and calcification
  is reduced, probably in consequence of altered plasmalemmal signal transduction
  (ST) and action-potential signaling at the endomembrane system (EMS). Due to diminished
  calcification under Ocean Acidification, DR produces more organic carbon. In addition
  to the intense buildup of glucans, the stimulated activity of the PPP under Ocean
  Acidification provides more NADPH and promotes lipid synthesis. Enhanced cytosolic
  levels of NADPH, in turn, result in a down-regulation of NADPH production in the
  LR.
