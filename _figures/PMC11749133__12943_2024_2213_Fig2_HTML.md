caption: Impact of traditional Chinese herbal preparations on cancer pathways. This
  diagram illustrates the molecular mechanisms through which different TCM formulations—Xiaochaihutang
  (XCHT), Zuojin Pill (ZJP), and Wei-Tong-Xin (WTX)—modulate signaling pathways in
  cancer therapy. XCHT is shown to regulate the microbiota, influencing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
  pathway, which is critical in immune response modulation in colon cancer. ZJP targets
  multiple signaling molecules including IL17, JUN, PI3K/AKT, MAPK1, and TNF, intersecting
  at various nodes to suppress tumor growth and proliferation in pancreatic cancer.
  WTX directly affects the PI3K/AKT pathway in colon cancer, highlighting its role
  in cellular processes such as growth and survival. The interplay of these herbal
  preparations illustrates a complex network of biochemical modulation that supports
  their use in complementary cancer therapy
