caption: The two compartment (or two cell-type) hypothesis. Two different  cell types
  exist within an adipose tissue depot; 1) undifferentiated  adipocytes which do not
  synthesize triglyceride and are predominantly  glycolytic (left side); 2) differentiated
  adipocytes which display  the phenotype characteristic of mature adipocytes (namely
  a large triglyceride  reservoir) and synthesize triglyceride (right side). The  differentiated
  adipocytes may rely mostly on glyceroneogenesis for the  deposition of triglyceride.
