caption: Light may play a crucial role during the first transition as determined by
  the potential involvement of tyrosinase (Tyr), the blue light transduction signal
  pathway (WC), the MAPK signaling pathway (MAPK), the cAMP signaling pathway (PKC)
  and the two-component system pathway (HDK). In addition, the cytochrome P450 (P450s)
  and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) genes were active in this process to facilitate
  mycelial growth. During the second transition, pathways related to stress reactions,
  such as the MAPK signaling (Mkk1_2 and PBS2) and cAMP signaling (PKA) pathways,
  were active, as were NADPH oxidase enzyme (Noxs) and the genes encoding glucosidase
  (gld) and laccase (lcc). These pathways and genes might be associated with primordium
  initiation. During the last transition, pathways related to nitrogen starvation,
  such as nitrogen metabolism (ats, nrd), mTOR signaling (mTOR) and Ca2+signaling
  (Ca2+-ATPase), might be more important in fruit body maturation than in other stages.
  Genes encoding ribosomal protein (rbp), rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor scd1
  (rho) and STE3-like pheromone receptor (ste3) had higher expression levels in fruit
  body maturation than in the other stages. The solid line indicates that the results
  were confirmed by transcriptomic analysis and RT-PCR; the dotted line indicates
  that the results were only confirmed by transcriptomic analysis.
