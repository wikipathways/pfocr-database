caption: 'Regulatory interactions of PPAR family members and their coactivator (PPARGC1A)
  and signaling partners (RXR-family members) with our DE proteins. The regulatory
  interactions (gray lines) of PPAR family transcription factors, PPARGC1A (coactivator)
  and RXRs with the DE proteins in our dataset were explored using an integrated transcription
  factor database, CATRIN. The network image was created using the NAVIGATOR software.
  The size of each transcription factor node corresponds to the number of our DE proteins
  regulated. Among the 70 DE proteins: red and blue outer circles denote increased
  and decreased expression in NEVKP at 30 min post-reperfusion respectively; gray
  arrowheads reflect increased or decreased expression in NEVKP at the POD3 time point
  respectively. Nodes are then colored to indicate relevant pathway enrichments associated
  with the respective proteins. Finally, cyan labeling indicates those proteins that
  were validated in independent datasets. DE, differentially expressed; NEVKP, normothermic
  ex vivo kidney perfusion.'
