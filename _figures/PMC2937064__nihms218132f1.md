caption: Leptin, IGFBP3, and rapamycin suppress the IGF-1 signaling pathway to preserve
  naïve T cells and promote longevity. IGF-1 signaling through the IRS proteins, which
  bind to the p110 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K), leads to the
  generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) and phosphorylation
  of AKT by phosphoinositide dependent kinase (PDK1). Phosphorylation of AKT leads
  to subsequent activation of mTOR and phosphorylates or inactivates a family of apoptosis-inducing
  forkhead transcription factors, including forkhead box O1 (FOXO1 or FKHR), forkhead
  box O3 (FOXO3, or FKHRL1), and forkhead box O4 (MLLT-7, FOXO4 or AFX). Life-long
  enhanced IGF-1 signaling pathway is associated with shortening of lifespan. In contrast,
  inhibition of mTOR by dietary restriction or rapamycin has been shown to be associated
  with longevity in mammals. It has recently been shown that increased levels of factors
  such as leptin and IGFBP3 that can inhibit the IGF-1 signaling pathway, are also
  associated with preservation of naïve CD8 T cells in human nonagenarians.
