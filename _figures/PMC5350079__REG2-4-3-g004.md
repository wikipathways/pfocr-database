caption: A framework for graft formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Upon cutting, auxin,
  cytokinin, and sugar transport are blocked at the graft junction and a wound healing
  pathway is activated. The WIND1 pathway activates and produces callus whereas auxin
  response proteins (TIR1, AFBs, AXR1, ALF4) below the graft junction perceive scion‐derived
  auxin to promote vascular connection (Iwase et al., ; Melnyk et al., ). Vascular
  tissues divide and differentiate to reconnect the vascular tissues by 8 days after
  grafting (Melnyk et al., ). Wound‐induced callus is found throughout the cut surface.
  Time‐course data taken from Yin et al. () and Melnyk et al. ().
