caption: A “bistable” model of ERN2/XBP1S-mediated regulation of MUC5B and its promoter
  variant in distal airway epithelia of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. (A) Basal MUC5B
  transcription produces MUC5B mRNAs that are translated into MUC5B protein at the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The MUC5B protein synthetic load is sensed by ERN2 (and
  perhaps also by ERN1), which leads to splicing of XBP1U (unspliced XBP1) to XBP1S.
  XBP1S regulates basal level expression of MUC5B and unfolded protein response (UPR)
  genes. Note, each step reflects a positive regulatory interaction. (B) In a rs35705950
  (G/G) distal airway mucin-secreting cell, inflammatory cytokines or other types
  of injury/stimuli stimulate MUC5B expression. An increased MUC5B mRNA load fuels
  increased MUC5B synthesis in ER, increased ERN2 activity, and XBP1S formation, and
  positive feedback by XBP1S on MUC5B transcriptional activity. The strength of this
  interaction is relatively weak, reflecting the “low-intensity state” of the XBP1S–MUC5B
  (G/G) promoter interaction. On removal of the stress-causing stimuli, the cell can
  revert to a low MUC5B basal secretion, low UPR activation state. (C) In a MUC5B
  rs35705950 (G/T or T/T) promoter distal airway mucus-secreting cell, stress signaling
  triggers overloaded MUC5B mRNA and protein synthesis, which in turn leads to ERN2
  hyperactivation and increased XBP1S formation. Note, the regulatory interaction
  in the MUC5B promoter between XBP1S and rs35705950 locus is amplified by the presence
  of G/T or T/T at that site. This positive feedback reflects a “high-intensity state”
  of interaction, which produces a high-intensity signal response that imposes significant
  ER stress and may be irreversible. This state is sufficient to trigger an abnormal
  response to impair innate host defense and contribute to cell senescence. A second
  hit (e.g., oxidative stress) may signal these already “high-intensity” cells to
  accentuate ER stress–induced injury further, resulting in a profibrotic microenvironment
  that promotes fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation (not shown
  in the illustration).
