caption: Scheme of known Wnt pathways. A Canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In the "off-state"
  no Wnt proteins are present or are inhibited by factors like WIF, sFRPs and Dkk.
  Cytosolic β-catenin is targeted to proteolytic degradation through phosphorylation
  by the APC-Axin-GSK3β-CK1á complex and ubiquitination by the βTrCP-dependent E3
  ubiquitin ligase. In the "on-state" stimulation of Fzd receptors and their co-receptors
  Lrp5/6 by Wnt ligands, leads to recruitment of Dvl and Axin to Fzd, thereby inhibiting
  the degradation complex. Consequently, β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and
  enters the nucleus, activating target gene transcription through association with
  Lef1/TCF. B Non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. Interaction of non-canonical Wnt ligands
  with Fzd receptors can lead to G-Protein mediated phosphorylation of Dsh, thereby
  activating PLC and increasing intracellular calcium levels. These will activate
  CAMKII and PKC, as well as the transcription factor NFAT. Additionally, Fzd receptors
  in association with Kny, Ror2 or Ryk receptors can activate JNK, promoting target
  gene expression through AP-1. C Non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway. This pathway is characterized
  by an asymmetric distribution of Fzds, the cadherin Flamingo and VANGL2, resulting
  in cell polarization. Wnt signaling promoted by either Wnt or an interaction of
  Fzd with VANGL2 activates RhoA/B, Cdc42 or Rac1. Dsh activates Rac1, while RhoA/B
  and Cdc42 need the participation of Daam1 downstream of Dsh. Rac1 can also activate
  JNK, resulting in the NFAT pathway. All three down stream pathways are key players
  in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cellular polarity. The signaling of the Flamingo/Fzd
  interaction is still obscure.
