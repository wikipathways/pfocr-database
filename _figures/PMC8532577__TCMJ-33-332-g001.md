caption: 'Upon stimulation of hepatocellular carcinoma by tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate,
  mitochondria reactive oxygen species is generated which can be blocked by mitochondria
  reactive oxygen species scavenger MitoTEMPO and Metformin. The mitochondria reactive
  oxygen species thus generated may oxidize heat shock protein 60 resulting in Raf
  kinase inhibitory protein dissociation from heat shock protein 60/mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (ERK and JNK) complex, triggering Mt → cytosol translocation of heat
  shock protein 60/mitogen-activated protein kinase. On the other hand, some mitochondria
  reactive oxygen species that diffuse into cytosol may also oxidize cytosolic heat
  shock protein 60, releasing Raf kinase inhibitory protein. Both the pathways contribute
  to the robust activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase s in the cytosol. It
  can be proposed that the same molecular event may occur in the signal pathway driven
  by other metastatic factors capable of generating reactive oxygen species via receptor
  tyrosine kinase in the tumor environment (indicated on the upper left panel). Solid
  lines: established pathway. Dashed line: proposed pathway'
