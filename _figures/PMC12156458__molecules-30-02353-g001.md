caption: Schematic representation of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption after
  cerebral I/R. Structural and functional support for the BBB is the neurovascular
  unit formed by endothelial cells (coded in light pink), pericytes (in green), astrocytes
  (in blue), and extracellular matrix components. The main physical barrier limiting
  paracellular diffusion between the blood and brain parenchyma is the TJ (shown as
  small dark red dumbbell-shaped structures on the apical side of endothelial cells).
  In the disruption of the BBB after cerebral I/R, the leading role is played by proinflammatory
  mediators, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2/MMP-9,
  which are under the control of the JNK pathway. After I/R, microglia and leukocytes
  generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS activate JNK and enhance the secretion
  of various cytokines, including TNF. TNF can induce ROS generation and JNK activation.
  ROS and JNK promote neuronal apoptosis, TJ disruption and neuroinflammation
