caption: A graphical summary of the effects on different cell populations and cytokines,
  involved in an allergic immune response, after exposure to polysaccharides, herbal
  medicinal plants or traditional Chinese medicine. The reported mode of action of
  either natural polysaccharides or medicinal plants appears to be quite similar in
  murine models. Mice supplemented with abovementioned sources demonstrates reduced
  allergen-specific IgE antibody responses and a marked reduction in clinical symptom
  severity including diarrhea and drop in temperature (clinical symptoms not shown).
  Reduced IgE expression levels inhibits mast cell degranulation leading to symptomatic
  relief. Polysaccharides and medicinal plants mediate Th-1 pathway by expressing
  IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-22 maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier function
  and preventing antigen presentation to dendritic cells (DC). Reduced levels of chemokines
  such as IL-25 and IL-33 results in decreased antigen presentation on DC's. Th-1,
  T-helper-1; DC's, Dendritic cells; IL, Interleukin; IFN-γ, Interferon gamma.
