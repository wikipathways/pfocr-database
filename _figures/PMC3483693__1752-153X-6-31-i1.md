caption: 5-HT signalling mechanism from enterochromaffin cells located within the
  lumen of the ileum.Top – Side view of the different layers that comprise the intestinal
  wall. The outer layer is the longitudinal muscle, followed by the myenteric plexus.
  A layer of circular muscle is next, followed by the submucosal plexus. The innermost
  layer is comprised of the mucosa where EC cells and epithelial cells are located
  along the villi. Bottom – Diagram of a single EC cell (centre) with two epithelial
  cells positioned either side. Steps 1–5 are the processes involved in 5-HT neurotransmission.
  The beginning of the synthesis pathway for 5-HT is represented by step 1, where
  5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is synthesised from tryptophan by the rate limiting
  enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TpH-1). The synthesis of 5-HT from 5-HTP by the
  enzyme L-amino acid decarboxylase (L-AADC) is represented by step 2. The release
  of 5-HT into the extracellular matrix is represented by step 3, where it can bind
  to corresponding 5-HT receptors on intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs) within
  the submucosal and myenteric plexus. The mechanism by which 5-HT is inactivated
  is represented by step 4, where 5-HT is transported into epithelial cells via the
  serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT). The final step in neurotransmission, represented
  by step 5 involves the metabolism of 5-HT into 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA)
  by the enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAOA).
