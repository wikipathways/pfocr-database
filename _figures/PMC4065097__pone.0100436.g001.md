caption: 'The critical genes of the B-terms were collected and using Mas 3.0 annotation
  system (Capital Bio http://bioinfo.capitalbio.com/mas3/) a molecular network was
  constructed. The abbreviations represented different genes involved in some important
  signal pathways related to both gastric cancer and anandamide. e.g., The PTGS2 gene
  codes for COX-2, an enzyme responsible for inflammation and pain, was reported that
  its mutationsmay be responsible for a higher risk of gastric cancer, in the meantime,
  COX-2 also metabolizes anandamide forming prostaglandin-ethanolamides (PG-EA). The
  numbers and color on the lines connected genes means the counts of the gene appeared
  in different signal pathways in three biological pathway database including Biocarta,
  GenMAPP andKEGG (Red: Biocarta; Green:GenMAPP; Blue: KEGG).'
