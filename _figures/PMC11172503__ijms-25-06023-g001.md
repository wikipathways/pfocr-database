caption: Modulation of Nrf2 and NF-κB signaling pathways by royal jelly (RJ). RJ reduces
  reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced tissue damage and toxicity by modulating Nrf2
  and NF-κB signaling pathways. Nrf2 and NF-κB are important regulators of the body’s
  response to oxidative stress and inflammation. The figure shows potential molecular
  mechanisms of RJ action via Nrf2 and NF-κB pathways and important effects on harmful
  exogenous and endogenous factors, as well as interplay between Nrf2 and NF-κB signaling.
  NF-κB functions as a homo- or heterodimer derived from one or more of the five members
  of the NF-κB family (RelA/p65, RelB, cRel, NF-κB1 or p50, and NF-κB2 or p52), and
  is activated by stimulus-dependent inhibitor degradation, post-translational modifications,
  nuclear translocation, and chromatin-binding. The activated NF-κB drives the pro-inflammatory
  response that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory
  diseases. In the nucleus, p65 coordinates gene transcription by recruiting coactivators
  (e.g., CREB-binding proteins (CBP)) or corepressors (e.g., histone deacetylases
  (HDACs)). Nrf2 and NF-κB compete for the CBP-binding in the nucleus; which transcription
  factor will bind to CBP depends on the relative amounts of translocated Nrf2 and
  NF-κB. In addition, NF-κB recruits HDAC3 which deacetylates Nrf2, reduces Nrf2 levels,
  and inhibits expression of ARE-dependent genes

  description: Modulation of Nrf2 and NF-κB signaling pathways by royal jelly (RJ).
    RJ reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced tissue damage and toxicity by
    modulating Nrf2 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Nrf2 and NF-κB are important regulators
    of the body’s response to oxidative stress and inflammation. The figure shows
    potential molecular mechanisms of RJ action via Nrf2 and NF-κB pathways and important
    effects on harmful exogenous and endogenous factors, as well as interplay between
    Nrf2 and NF-κB signaling. NF-κB functions as a homo- or heterodimer derived from
    one or more of the five members of the NF-κB family (RelA/p65, RelB, cRel, NF-κB1
    or p50, and NF-κB2 or p52), and is activated by stimulus-dependent inhibitor degradation,
    post-translational modifications, nuclear translocation, and chromatin-binding.
    The activated NF-κB drives the pro-inflammatory response that plays an important
    role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. In the nucleus, p65
    coordinates gene transcription by recruiting coactivators (e.g., CREB-binding
    proteins (CBP)) or corepressors (e.g., histone deacetylases (HDACs)). Nrf2 and
    NF-κB compete for the CBP-binding in the nucleus; which transcription factor will
    bind to CBP depends on the relative amounts of translocated Nrf2 and NF-κB. In
    addition, NF-κB recruits HDAC3 which deacetylates Nrf2, reduces Nrf2 levels, and
    inhibits expression of ARE-dependent genes
