caption: Various regulated cell death mechanisms—ferroptosis (1), cuproptosis (2),
  and necroptosis (3)—influence the tumor microenvironment (TME) by shaping immune
  cell populations and modulating tumor progression. 1) Ferroptosis, characterized
  by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and requiring GPX4 for protection, triggers
  the release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These signals promote
  dendritic cell (DC) maturation, enhance antigen presentation, and support cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte (CTL) responses while also affecting macrophage polarization (M1 vs.
  M2). 2) Cuproptosis, a copper-induced cell death mechanism dependent on ASAH2, can
  activate the cGAS–STING pathway and stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, IL-2). This may boost natural killer (NK) cell and T-cell
  activity but can also recruit immunosuppressive cells (e.g., regulatory T cells
  [Tregs], myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs]) and promote a tolerogenic TME
  under certain conditions. 3) Necroptosis, driven by the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL signaling
  axis, results in cell membrane rupture and additional DAMP release. While this can
  elicit strong innate and adaptive immune responses—such as NK cell activation and
  T-cell priming—it may also foster chronic inflammation that supports tumor growth.
  These distinct death pathways collectively reshape the TME and influence therapeutic
  outcomes, including responses to immunotherapy. The figure is created with BioRender
