caption: The L-arginine-NO biosynthetic pathway regulates key vasculogenic and angiogenic
  factors in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells in the placenta. Arginine
  stimulates placental NO synthesis mainly by enhancing the generation of BH4, an
  essential cofactor for NOSs. Estrogen and progesterone augmented the constitutive
  and inducible NOS activities and the BH4 concentration in the porcine placenta,
  thus playing synergetic roles in promoting the placental NO synthesis. The porcine
  placenta lacks arginase and arginine decarboxylase and thus cannot synthesize ornithine
  from arginine. NO interacts with critical mediators of angiogenesis (VEGF, PIGF,
  and the angiopoietins). The induction of angiogenesis by angiopoietin and VEGF proteins
  is dependent on the amount of VEGF and Ang-1/Ang-2 in endothelial cells. Besides,
  NO diffuses to the underlying VSMCs where they act on GTP to produce cGMP via guanylate
  cyclase, which is capable of dilating blood vessels. Ang-1/Ang-2, angiopoietin-1
