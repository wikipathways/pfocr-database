caption: The schematic chart for molecular mechanisms of metabolic dysregulation in
  DCM. Hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia induce cardiometabolic disorders in diabetes.
  Both CD36 expression and fatty acid (FA) uptake are increased in diabetic hearts.
  Activated MAPK signaling pathway induces toxic lipid intermediate accumulation.
  Increased expression of PGC-1β and MG53, and up-regulation of PPARα and its target
  genes promote FA oxidation, which further leads to abnormal cardiometabolism and
  cardiac dysfunction. Decreased glucose and lactate uptake, activation of the polyol
  pathway, and enhanced fructose metabolism lead to increased production of AGEs and
  UDP-GlcNAc, which induce inflammation and cardiac dysfunction. Additionally, increased
  level of amino acids and KBs may also be risk factors for cardiometabolic disorders
  in diabetes
