caption: Pathway analysis of radiation-induced acetylated and deacetylated proteins.
  All differentially regulated acetylated and deacetylated proteins were imported
  into the GeneMANIA and IPA software tools. (a) GeneMANIA identified translational
  initiation as the most significant protein class affected by irradiation on the
  acetylation level. The striped brown and gray circles represent the identified acetylated/deacetylated
  proteins, whereas the uniquely colored circles represent the predicted interactive
  proteins. The brown color shows the network involved in protein synthesis; the gray
  color indicates proteins only indirectly related to protein synthesis. (b) The most
  affected biological networks from the IPA analysis were cell death and survival,
  cellular movement, cellular development, cellular morphology and protein trafficking;
  these are shown as a merged network. The gray molecules represent proteins found
  to be altered in their acetylation status in this study; the white molecules are
  interaction partners predicted by the software. The solid arrows and lines represent
  direct interactions, and the dotted arrows and lines indirect interactions.
