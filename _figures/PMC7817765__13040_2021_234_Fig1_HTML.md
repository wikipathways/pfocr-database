caption: 'a Activation pattern of NF-KB pathway in lung cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2.
  b Detail of NF-KB pathway’s circuit with TNF as effector protein. c Heatmap representing
  activation values of all the circuits in COVID-19 disease map (left) and a representation
  of a Principal Component Analysis based on signaling profiles of the samples that
  clearly segregates the two conditions studied: controls are represented in dark
  blue and cases in purple (right). d An example of the Perturbation effect option
  simulating the effect of Siltuximab (targeting IL6 protein) in Toll-like signaling
  pathway. Individual gene expression levels in each node are represented green scale.
  e An example of the Variant interpreter option simulating the effect of a loss of
  function mutation in NFKBIA protein over lung tissue pathway activity in the TNF
  signaling pathway. Mean values of gene expression levels in each node are represented
  in green scale'
