caption: Functions of FSH signaling in early stages of spermatogenesis. Activating
  cAMP/PKA signaling pathway induces expression of GDNF and FGF2 in SC which will
  be secreted to SSC to maintain spermatogonia pool. Notably, FSH can inhibit degradation
  of GDNF via suppressing lysosomal biogenesis. This process is validated by activating
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Additionally, FSH negatively regulates PGE2 through inhibiting
  AMH. PGE2 is also important for spermatogonia pool maintenance. SLF, SCF, Igf3 and
  BMP4 that is activated via cAMP/PKA pathway, along with transferrin through unknown
  pathway, contribute to spermatogonia differentiation. FSH ensures entry into meiosis
  through regulating DNA synthesis and chromosome dynamics. FSH regulates DNA synthesis
  via temporally inhibiting IL-6, Activin A and inducing Inhibin B. Chromosome dynamics
  is positively regulated by nociception via cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Also, FSH
  upregulates Nrg1 and Nrg3 to induce Stra8 expression in spermatocytes. Besides,
  limiting gem cell apoptosis by inhibiting Gal3 and Bok is another task of FSH signaling
  in SCs. Dotted line represents unknown mechanism
