caption: Role of TBK1 in key mechanisms of inflammation-associated diseases. Inflammation
  is a central link in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of a variety of
  inflammation-associated diseases. TBK1 plays a key role in a variety of inflammation-associated
  diseases by linking inflammation to immunity, metabolism, or oncogenesis through
  the activation of various signaling pathways and the regulation of immune cell function
