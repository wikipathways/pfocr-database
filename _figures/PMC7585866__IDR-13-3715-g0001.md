caption: Diagram of regulatory mechanism of renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The classical
  RAS pathway begins with the conversion of angiotensinogen (AGT) to an inactive decapeptide
  precursor angiotensin I (Ang I) through the action of renin. Ang I is further recognized
  and cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to produce active octapeptide
  angiotensin II (Ang II). Ang II is the key biological peptide of RAS which has various
  physiological regulatory effects. It acts mainly through the combination of type
  1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1R) to constrict blood vessels, raise blood pressure,
  promote inflammation, and promote fibrosis and apoptosis. It can also bind to AT2,
  AT3, and AT4 receptors, and plays different physiological roles. In addition, angiotensin
  converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) can cleave Ang I C-terminal peptide to produce inactive
  Ang (1-9), then Ang (1-9) can be hydrolyzed by ACE and other peptidases to produce
  active Ang (1-7). ACE2 can also directly cleave Ang II to form Ang (1-7). Ang (1-7)
  binds to the Mas receptor (MasR) and exerts physiological functions that are contrary
  to Ang II, including vasodilation, lower blood pressure, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative
  stress, anti-fibrosis, etc. These form two main functional axes of RAS. Ala-Ang
  (1-7) is produced when the aspartate at the amino terminal of Ang (1-7) is replaced
  by alanine. It can bind to the new receptor Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor
  D (MrgD) and protect against hypertension, inflammation, and lung damage. Furthermore,
  ACEI and ARB can protect against RAS imbalance by inhibiting the conversion of Ang
  I to Ang II and the binding of Ang II to the AT1R, respectively. We also showed
  that some viral infections can interfere with the function of RAS, leading to acute
  lung injury (ALI) and even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
