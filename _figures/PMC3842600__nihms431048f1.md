caption: 'Key features of BMP signaling in embryos of diverse organisms: the sea anemone
  Nematostella, the leech Helobdella, studied by Kuo and Weisblat [], the insects
  Tribolium and Drosophila, the sea urchin Paracentrotus and the frog Xenopus. Phylogenetic
  relationships are indicated by the tree, which is not drawn to scale. Note that
  the dorsoventral (D-V) axis appears to have undergone an inversion in the chordate
  lineage, which includes vertebrates [,]. Red/pink indicates mesoderm; dark blue
  indicates CNS neuroectoderm; yellow indicates the domain of BMP expression, which
  corresponds to epidermal ectoderm in vertebrates, Drosophila, and Helobdella; the
  stippled region indicates region of known BMP activity, darker stippling indicates
  higher levels of activity; vertical arrows indicate vectorial Sog/Chd-mediated transport
  of BMPs. D = Dorsal; V = Ventral; Chd = Chordin; Grm = Gremlin; bp = blastopore.

  in ectoderm patterning, see [,,].'
