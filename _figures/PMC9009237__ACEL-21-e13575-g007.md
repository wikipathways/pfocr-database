caption: Dopamine signaling pathways intersect oxidative/inflammatory cascades in
  astrocytes. Schematic representation of DA modulation of astrocyte harmful phenotype
  during inflammation and oxidative stress. DA crosstalk with Nrf2‐ARE induced targeting
  of antioxidant response elements (ARE) is highlighted. Upon DA binding to DRD2,
  neuroinflammation can be mitigated by different mechanisms. αB‐Crystallin (αBC)‐dependent
  mechanism can be elicited by DRD2 agonists alleviating neuroinflammatory injury
  via the αβC/STAT3 pathway. DRD2 agonists can also mitigate LPS‐induced proinflammatory
  cytokine response, via a β‐arrestin‐2‐mediated signaling inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. On the contrary, α‐Syn reduced the expression of β‐arrestin‐2 in astrocytes,
  whereas it increased the β‐arrestin‐2 and can restore the anti‐inflammatory effect
  of DRD2 (detailed in the text). A critical loop is represented by the ability of
  DRD signaling to upregulate the master regulator of oxidative stress and inflammation,
  Nrf2 in astrocytes, via ARE stimulation of a panel antioxidant/anti‐inflammatory
  proteins, such as heme oxygenase (HO1), superoxide dismutases (SODs), glutathione
  S‐transferase (GST), and catalase (CAT) besides others, regulating the cellular
  redox state by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation (detailed in Section
  1.4)
