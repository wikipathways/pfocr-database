caption: 'Schematic representation of protein expression, molecular pahtways, facilitators
  and mutations involved in the genesis of brain metastases from melanoma, breast
  and lung cancer. Breast cancer cells: Upregulated expression of A.R. (androgen receptor),
  P.R. (progesterone receptor) and E.R .(estrogen receptor) in the primary tumor.
  miRNA-509 → Rhoc/TNF pathway → BBB permeability/MMP9 in Circulating tumor cells
  (CTCs). miRNA-31, -126,-335 suppress metastasic spread. miRNA-7 downregulates KLFM
  pathway in stem cells. Cathepsin S (CTSS) proteolytic processing of the junction
  adhesion molecule (JAM). The N-acetylgalactosaminidase α2,6 sialyltransferase 5
  (ST6GALNAC5) has been identified as a facilitator of tumor cell/brain endothelial
  adhesion. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 increase vascular permeability
  and activation of the PI-3K/AKT pathway. Lung Cancer cells: Upregulated EGFR, PI3K,
  Keap-1, Nfr2, P300, Tp53, Rad54L2, NTRK3, and TARX. miRNA-328 upregulates the PKACA
  pathway. miRNA-378 is upregulated and miRNA-145 downregulated. IncRNA MALAT1 induces
  EMT and HOTAIR high expression in BM. The Rho kinase signaling, involved in intracellular
  junction disruption, has been found activated in this transendothelial migration.
  Melanoma Cancer cells: Upregulated BRAF mutation, induce PI3K/AKT pathway. miRNA-210
  was overexpressed in exosomes of BM cells and miRNA 19a and miRNA-29c were downregulated
  in exosomes BM cells. In CTC, the membrane-bound melanotransferrin correlates with
  brain endothelial adhesion'
