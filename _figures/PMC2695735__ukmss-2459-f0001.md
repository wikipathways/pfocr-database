caption: 'Schematic representation of the cyclooxygenase–prostanoid biosynthetic and
  signalling pathway. Arachidonic acid (AA) is released from plasma membrane phospholipids
  by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and utilized by cyclooxygenases (COX) and specific synthase
  enzymes to form prostaglandin (PG), PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, PGI2 and thromboxane (TX)
  A2. These products are actively transported out of the cell by a prostanoid transporter
  (PGT), on which they exert an autocrine–paracrine effect by coupling to heptahelical
  transmembrane receptors to activate intracellular signalling. Inhibitors of COX
  enzyme function such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can block
  PG biosynthesis and subsequent downstream events. IP3: inositol trisphosphate; MAPK:
  mitogen-associated protein kinase; PGDS: prostaglandin-D-synthase; PGES: prostaglandin-E-synthase;
  PGFS: prostaglandin-F-synthase; PGIS: prostaglandin-I-synthase; TXS: thromboxane
  synthase.'
