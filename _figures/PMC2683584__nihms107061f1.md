caption: Testosterone, produced by the perinatal testes, regulates cell number in
  several sexually dimorphic areas. In this simplified model, (1) testosterone binds
  to (2) androgen receptors (AR), or is aromatized to an estrogen before binding estrogen
  receptors (ER), such as ERα and ERβ. (3,4) The activation of ARs or ERs leads to
  changes in the expression of proteins involved in cell death, including those of
  the Bcl-2 family; this may involve epigenetic changes in chromatin associated with
  cell death genes. (5) In other instances, testosterone regulates the availability
  of neurotrophic factors which may also lead, directly or indirectly, to changes
  in the expression or activity of Bcl-2 family proteins. (6) Pro-survival members
  of the family, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are primarily localized to the outer mitochondrial
  membrane. (7) Most cell types have two full-length pro-death members, Bax and Bak,
  but developing neurons lack Bak. Bax normally resides in the cytoplasm, and translocates
  to the mitochondria in response to a death signal. (8) BH3-only proteins are pro-apoptotic;
  they bind to and inactivate the pro-survival proteins, or directly activate Bax.
  (9) If not opposed by pro-survival family members such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, Bax forms
  oligomers at the mitochondrial membrane capable of releasing of cytochrome c and
  other factors. Cytochrome c interacts with apoptotic protease activating factor
  1 (Apaf-1) to trigger ‘initiation caspases’ such as caspase 9. (10) These in turn
  activate ‘executioner caspases’ such as caspase 3, which degrade cellular proteins
  and kill the cell. (11) A second cell death mechanism involves death receptors embedded
  in the plasma membrane (e.g., fas or the tumor necrosis factor receptor). Although
  not thought to be the predominant pathway for controlling cell number in the developing
  nervous system, some sub-populations of neurons may depend on this mechanism. Like
  the pathway regulated by Bcl-2 family members, the death receptor-mediated apoptosis
  also converges on executioner caspases.
