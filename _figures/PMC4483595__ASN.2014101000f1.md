caption: Three pathways of complement activation. The classical pathway is triggered
  by IgG– and/or IgM–containing immune complexes. The alternative pathway is constantly
  initiated by spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 [C3b(H2O)] that is efficiently powered
  by the covalent attachment of C3b on an activating surface. The lectin pathway requires
  a particular sugar moiety pattern (N-acetylglucosamine [GlcNAc]) to be recognized
  and bound by MBL, leading to a classical pathway–like activation cascade. Each pathway
  leads to formation of a C3 convertase. The addition of C3b to the C3 convertase
  creates a C5 convertase that, in turn, triggers the assembly of the membrane attack
  complex (C5b-9), which is also known as the terminal pathway complete complex. Regulatory
  factors are in red. CR1, complement receptor 1; FD, factor D; MAC, membrane attack
  complex; MCP, membrane cofactor protein; P, properdin.

  description: Three pathways of complement activation. The classical pathway is triggered
