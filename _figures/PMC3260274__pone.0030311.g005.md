caption: Elevated PTEN and suppressed p-Akt were found in the PDCD4 over-expressing
  stable clones. When cells were starved with serum-free medium, PDCD4 was un-phosphorylated
  due to suppressed p-Akt expression. Un-phosphorylated PDCD4 was not recognized by
  proteasome thus leading to the accumulation of PDCD4. When serum was re-administrated
  to the cells, up-regulated p-Akt phosphorylated PDCD4, which was then depleted through
  proteasome degradation. The administration of either PI3K inhibitor LY294002, capable
  of preventing PDCD4 from being phosphorylated by p-Akt, or proteasome inhibitor
  MG132, preventing the depletion of PDCD4, leading to the accumulation of PDCD4.
