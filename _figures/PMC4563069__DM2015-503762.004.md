caption: Canonical pathway of miRNA biogenesis in human. miRNAs are transcribed by
  RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) from intergenic, intronic, or polycistronic loci to
  long primary transcript, called primary miRNA (pri-miRNA), which consists in a stem,
  a terminal loop, and single-stranded RNA segments at both the 5′- and 3′-UTR sides.
  Microprocessor complex (Drosha and DGCR8 cofactor) cleaves the stem-loop and releases
  a small hairpin-shaped RNA, called precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Following, pre-miRNA
  is exported into the cytoplasm by the transport complex formed by protein exportin
  5 (EXP5) and GTP-binding nuclear protein RAN-GTP. Subsequently, pre-miRNAs are cleaved
  by a ternary complex formed by Dicer, TAR RNA Binding Protein (TRBP), and Protein
  Activator of PKR (PACT), producing small RNA duplexes (miRNA-miRNA ∗). Next, these
  are loaded onto an Argonaute protein (AGO) to form an immature RNA-Induced Silencing
  Complex (RISC) or pre-RISC, in a process mediated for Heat shock cognate 70- (Hsc70-)
  Heat shock protein (Hsp90) chaperone complex. AGO protein separates the two strands
  to generate a mature RISC effector. Finally, RISC binds the target mRNA through
  complementary binding of 6 to 8 base pairs of the miRNA, with a specific sequence
  of the target resulting in the gene silencing.
