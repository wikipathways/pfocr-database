caption: Hepatic glucose metabolic pathway during pregnancy. Pregnancy induces insulin
  resistance, and solute carrier family 2 member 2 (SLC2A2) mediates facilitated bidirectional
  glucose transport between portal vein and hepatocytes. During pregnancy, the increase
  in endogenous hepatic glucose production enhances the production of glucose-6-phosphatase
  (G6Pase), and 5’-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), angiopoietin like 4
  (ANGPTL4) and glucokinase (GCK), which are involved in glucose homeostasis. In addition,
  there is an upregulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PAK), which inhibits
  the activity of glycogen synthesis. The glucose level increases in the liver, which
  reduces the activity of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) by downregulating activity
  of insulin receptor (INSR). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of insulin receptor
  substrate 1 (IRS1) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is inhibited, which
  downregulates the activity of AKT serine/threonine kinase 2 (AKT2), and reduces
  the ability of solute carrier family 2 member 4 (SLC2A4) transporter, resulting
  in a decrease in glycogen synthesis
