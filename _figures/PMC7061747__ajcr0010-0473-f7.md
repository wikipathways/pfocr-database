caption: The potential synergistic mechanism of optimal dose platinum chemotherapy
  and PD-1 antibodies in cancer prevention. Platinum chemotherapeutic agents induced
  tumor cell apoptosis, and the stressed tumor cells released immunogenic signals
  (such as CRT and HMGB1). These signals allowed dendritic cells, the essential antigen
  presenting cells of the innate immune system, to take up portions of the stressed
  tumor cells and then presented tumor antigen to cognate T cells. Tumor antigen specific
  T cells with PD-1 expression are activated in lymph nodes and recruited to the tumor
  site. Unfortunately, in the tumor microenvironment, the PD-L1 molecule, which is
  expressed on the surface of tumor cells, engages with PD-1 on recruited T lymphocytes
  and blocks T cell function. Effective blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway interferes
  with the immune evasion of tumor cells and allows the immune system to control residual
  tumor cells.

  to the therapeutic efficacy of sequential PD-1 blockade in a mouse model of colon
  cancer.
