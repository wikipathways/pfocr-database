caption: 'Mechanism of ferroptosis. The regulatory pathways of ferroptosis are associated
  with lipid, amino acid, and iron metabolism. Firstly, iron homeostasis is a key
  part of iron metabolism, such as the regulation of iron intake (TFR1 and DMT1),
  iron export (FPN), iron storage (Ferrin), and mitochondria normal physiological
  processes. Secondly, multiple enzymes are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism
  pathways, such as ACSL4, LPCAT3, and LOXs, which have effects on lipid regulation
  and ferroptosis. Thirdly, GPX4 is the key regulator of pathway of amino acid metabolism,
  which is regulated by multiple pathways, such as the system Xc-, sulfur transfer
  pathway, MVA pathway, and NADPH regulatory pathway. Fourth, the FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H
  pathway exists as an independent parallel system that works cooperatively with GPX4
  and glutathione to inhibit phospho-lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. In addition,
  Nrf2 transcriptional targets are involved in regulating iron metabolism and lipid
  synthesis and metabolism, ultimately altering ferroptosis pro-cess. ACSL4: Acyl-CoA
  synthetase long-chain family member 4; CoQ10: coenzyme Q10; CP: ceruloplasmin; DMT1:
  divalent metal transporter 1; FPN: ferroportin; FSP1: ferroptosis suppressor protein
