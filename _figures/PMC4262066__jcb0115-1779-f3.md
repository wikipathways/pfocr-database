caption: Schematic presentation of mechanisms leading to cell cycle deregulation in
  growth plate dtd chondrocytes. Wnt canonical pathway activation and TGF-β activation
  through Smad3 lead to the stabilization of β-catenin resulting in cyclin D (Ccnd)
  and Cdk6 increase expression pointing to an activation of cell cycle progression
  in dtd mice. However the Ccnd–Cdk complex, in spite of its up-regulation, is not
  able to phosphorylate p130; weak p130 phosphorylation prevents E2f release from
  the pocket protein. This step, which is crucial to activate transcription of target
  genes involved in cell cycle progression (Cdc25a, Ccne, and Ccna), explains cell
  cycle deregulation in the G1 phase of dtd chondrocytes. Arrows pointing up or down
  indicate gene/protein up- or down-regulation in dtd mice, respectively.
