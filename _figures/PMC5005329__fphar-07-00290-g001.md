caption: Current view on T cell NNCS in regulation of immune function. (A) Proposed
  paracrine and autocrine effect of T cell-derived ACh in T cell microenvironment.
  (B) Role of NNCS in Ca2+signaling and gene expression in healthy T-lymphocyte. (A)
  TCR- and muscarinic (M1, 3, 5) receptor- triggered signaling pathways are cross-linked
  in T cells. In healthy T-cells, principle route of phospholipase C (PLCγ) activation
  upon recognition of antigen-presenting cell occurs via TCR/CD3 complex. TCR –generated
  signal is amplified by a co-receptor (CD4), which recruits Lck, a tyrosine kinase,
  phosphorylating several targets, including Z-chain protein kinase ZAP70, which phosphorylates
  LAT (linker for activation of T-cells), interacting with PLCγ. PLCγ may be activated
  through alternative mechanism related to T cell cholinergic system, where import
  of choline (Cho), synthesis of ACh and its secretion via yet unknown pathway results
  in paracrine/ autocrine activation of muscarinic receptors M1, M3 and/or M5. It
  follows by activation of trimeric G-protein (Gq11), whose subunit α activates PLCγ.
  PLCγ degrades phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into soluble IP3 and
  membrane bound diacylglycerol (DAG). Intracellular release of IP3 activates IP3
  receptor-channel, mediating Ca2+-release from ER. Ca2+ depletion of reticulum is
  sensed by STIM1 of ER membrane, which promotes assembly of Orai subunits and formation
  of CRAC channel in the plasma membrane, the main route of capacitive Ca2+ entry,
  which considered to be principle Ca2+ influx channel in lymphocytes. CRAC-mediated
  Ca2+ influx is sustained, when membrane negative potential difference is maintained
  due to K+ efflux via a set of K+-selective channels, in healthy T-cells represented
  by voltage-dependent Kv1.3 channel and Ca2+-activated intermediate conductance K+
  channel KCa3.1. Activation of calcineurin (CN) via Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) complex
  occurs only upon prolonged intracellular Ca2+ increase. Principle target of CN is
  NFATs, heavily phosphorylated at the rest; its dephosphorylation make it permeable
  via nuclear pore. By entering nucleus, NFAT induces the transcription of several
  genes.
