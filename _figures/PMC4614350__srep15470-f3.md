caption: Red, HGT genes and their putative contribution to virulence; solid red arrow,
  processes and genes involved, supported by published studies. Red dashed arrow,
  potential function of HGT genes according to protein domain and gene regulatory
  information. Green dashed box, biological process in which the two Ig family proteins
  may be involved, although it is not known whether this process is necessary to the
  hemolysis pathway.
