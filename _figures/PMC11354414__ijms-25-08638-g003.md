caption: Cell signaling pathway involving TNF-α in activating NF-κB. In the block
  diagram on the right, TNF-α can activate NF-κB signal and lead to chondrocyte apoptosis.
  However, MMW irradiation could down-regulate RIP, TAK1, IKK-β, and NF-κB (p65) and
  up-regulate IκB-α, thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling and reducing chondrocyte apoptosis
