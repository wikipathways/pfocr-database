caption: 'Proposed signaling cascades of curcumin in the spinal glia. Curcumin suppresses
  the activation of glial cells and inflammatory mediators via modulating the (1)
  MAPK, (2) NF-κβ, and (3) JAK-STAT pathways. (1) Curcumin regulates the MAPK signaling
  pathway by suppressing the activation of three major kinases: ERK, p38, and JNK,
  and at the upstream level, curcumin reduces the expression of CX3CR1 and TLR4 receptor
  that inhibits the activation of p38 in the MAPK pathway. (2) Curcumin inhibits the
  NF-κβ pathway via abrogating activation of NF-κβ. At the upstream level NF-κβ pathway,
  curcumin inhibits the expression of CX3CR1, TLR4, and TNF-α receptors. (3) Curcumin
  inhibits neuroinflammation by suppressing the phosphorylation of JAK and STAT proteins.
  Suppression of these pathways inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory mediators
  and enhances the release of anti-inflammatory mediators by spinal glia. Abbreviations:
  CX3CR1, CX3C chemokine receptor 1; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; TNFR1, tumor necrosis
  factor receptor 1; ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinases; TF, transcription factor; NEMO, NF-κβ essential modulator, IKK, IκB kinase;
  NF-κβ, nuclear factor κ light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; JAK, Janus kinase;
  STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription protein; NO, nitrite oxide;
  IL, interleukin, PPAR-α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α.'
