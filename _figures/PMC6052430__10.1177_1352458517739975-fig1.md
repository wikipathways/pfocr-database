caption: 'Schematic representation of the links between the gut microbiome, 5-HT production,
  and neuroinflammation in CNS. 5-HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin; 5-HTR1A: serotonin
  receptor 1A; MAO: monoamine oxidase; 5-HTR7: serotonin receptor 7; 5-HTR5: serotonin
  receptor 5; and SERT: serotonin transporter. The left side illustrates serotonergic
  pathways related to maintenance of 5-HT homeostasis and inhibition of neuroinflammation.
  These pathways include 5-HT production by healthy gut microbiota (depicted green
  with smooth texture) and 5-HT increase in CNS by 5-HT modulating medications. The
  right side represents neuroinflammatory pathways triggered by lowered 5-HT production
  in the gut as a result of altered gut microbiota (depicted in red with striated
  texture). The red crosses indicate decreased gut 5-HT synthesis, lowered levels
  of 5-HT uptake in platelets, and less 5-HT available to promote macrophage differentiation
  to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. The numbers circled in black indicate the main
  conclusions related to the specific branch of the pathway made throughout the paper.
  These conclusions are summarized in the accompanying table along with the relevant
  references. Images are adapted from Servier Medical Art by Servier and modified
