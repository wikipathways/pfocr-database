caption: Schematic representation of cannabinoid mediated signaling pathways in cancer
  cells. In cancer cells, cannabinoids engage the CB1 or CB2 receptors to modulate
  numerous signaling pathways promoting cell cycle arrest, autophagy, and apoptosis
  and inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. (1) Cannabinoids
  inhibit cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which modulates mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs) and leads to stimulation of cyclin kinase inhibitor p27 and inhibition
  of cell cycle regulatory molecules, resulting in G1 arrest and apoptosis. (2) Cannabinoids
  also modulate MAPKs and PI3K/Akt pathways and its downstream apoptotic proteins
  leading to induction of apoptosis. (3) Cannabinoids also stimulate ceramide synthesis
  via activation of serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT) and upregulate p8, leading
  to induction of apoptosis through autophagy. (4) Cannabinoids also cause depolarization
  of the mitochondrial membrane, and caspase activation. (5) Cannabinoids inhibit
  cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis by modulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  (6) Cannabinoids inhibit invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis through modulating
  COX-2/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling pathways, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and
  RhoA-ROCK pathways and inhibiting MMPs respectively. (7) Cannabinoids also induce
  cell death via CB1/CB2 receptor-independent mechanisms by activating nuclear factor
  (erythroid derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant responsive element (ARE) pathway
  and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction and transcription.
