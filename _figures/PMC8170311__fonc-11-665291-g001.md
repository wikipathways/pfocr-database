caption: Metabolic pathways potentially associated with resistance to currently used
  pharmacological agents or specific genetic signatures. Chemotherapeutics or targeted
  therapy drugs currently in use for AML (in green) are presented next to the cytosolic
  (in blue) or mitochondrial (in red) metabolic pathway whose activity has been reported
  to be modulated upon treatment with respective compound or which has been associated
  with drug resistance. Genetic markers associated to changes in certain metabolic
  pathways are given in yellow.
