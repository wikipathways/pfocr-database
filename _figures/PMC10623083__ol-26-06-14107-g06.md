caption: CFH knockdown suppresses the stemness of breast cancer cells through regulation
  of the EPB41L3/MAPK axis. CFH downregulation induced EPB41L3 expression, which induced
  the inhibition of ERK and the activation of the p38 signaling pathway. It also regulated
  related genes to decrease BCSC characteristics and trigger a decrease in resistance
  to immune attack and irradiation in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. BCSCs,
  breast cancer stem cells; CFH, complement factor H; EPB41L3, erythrocyte membrane
  protein band 4.1-like 3; NHS, normal human serum.
