caption: MYC promotes anabolic metabolism. Normal quiescent cells (left) predominantly
  rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to generate ATP energy.
  Breakdown of glucose in glycolysis and mitochondrial Krebs cycle yields ATP and
  reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH2). The transfer of electrons from reducing equivalents
  to molecular oxygen during OXPHOS completes the ATP-generating processes, yielding
  altogether 36 ATPs per glucose molecule. Supraphysiological expression of MYC induces
  a shift to anabolic metabolism (right), which predominantly produces building blocks
  for biosynthesis of macromolecules (nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids)
  at cost of less energy production. While aerobic glycolysis i.e. Warburg effect
  produces only 4 ATPs per glucose molecule, the glycolysis and parallel running pentose
  phosphate pathway (not shown in the figure) generate plenty of reducing equivalents
  for biosynthetic reactions. MYC also enhances utilization of glutamine-derived carbon
  for biosynthetic reactions and MYC transformed cells may use alpha-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG), a product of glutaminolysis, as a key anaplerotic substrate to maintain
  Krebs cycle-dependent biosynthetic reactions. The metabolic target genes regulated
  by MYC are marked with pink color. GLUT1, Glucose transporter 1; HK2, Hexokinase
  2; LDH-A, Lactate dehydrogenase A; MCT, Monocarboxylate transporter; ASCT2, ASC
