caption: Wnt signaling pathways and the effects in mature synapses. (A) activation
  of canonical Wnt/β-catenin dependent pathway starts with the binding of Wnt ligand
  to Fz receptor and to the co-receptor LRP5/6, which induces the recruitment of Dvl
  and causes the inhibition of the “β-catenin destruction complex” formed by Axin,
  APC, GSK3β, and CK1. The inhibition of the “β-catenin destruction complex” causes
  the accumulation of β-catenin, which is no longer phosphorylated and it translocates
  to the nucleus where it activates transcription of Wnt target genes mediated by
  TCF/LEF. Canonical Wnt pathway participates in synaptic plasticity and cell survival.
  A divergent pathway involving proteins of the “β-catenin destruction complex” participates
  in the clustering of pre-synaptic proteins and the neurotransmitter release. The
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway can be blocked by Dkk-1 which binds to LRP, or through the
  sFRP which binds directly to Wnt ligand. (B) In the non-canonical Wnt/JNK pathway,
  activation of Dvl by the binding of Wnt to Fz, induces the activation of Rho and
  Rac small GTPases. Activation of Rho signals through ROCK and the activation of
  Rac signals through the JNK. This pathway is involved in the clustering of post-synaptic
  proteins and can also lead gene transcription mediated by ATF2. (C) In the non-canonical
  Wnt/Ca2+pathway, the binding of Wnt to Fz, activates the heterotrimeric G-proteins
  which in turn signal through PLC and IP3 to induce the release of the intracellular
  Ca2+ and the activation of PKC and CaMKII. In this pathway, the transcription factor
  CREB is activated. Wnt/Ca2+pathway is involved in the clustering of post-synaptic
  proteins and the dendritic spine morphogenesis. This figure is a courtesy of Felipe
