caption: Mechanisms of action for the presence of GPX3 in cancer. (A) Hypermethylation
  of the CpG island of the GPX3 promoter results in decreased GPX3 expression, leading
  to the proliferation of tumor cells. (B) Modifications in GPX3 play a crucial role
  in the regulation of various signaling pathways in tumors, including NF-κB, Wnt-β
  connexin, and JNK signaling. (C) SNPs are predominantly located in the non-coding
  region of the GPX3 gene and have been shown to have a positive association with
  cancer risk. GPX3 rs3805435 and rs3828599 have been linked to the development of
  gastric cancer, and GPX3 rs736775 may serve as a prognostic marker. (D) GPX3 can
  actively scavenge ROS within the TME, thereby enhancing the removal of soluble lipid
  hydroperoxides present in the extracellular tumor environment. This process protects
  the tumor cells. GPX3, glutathione peroxidase 3; CpG, cytosine, and guanine; mRNA,
