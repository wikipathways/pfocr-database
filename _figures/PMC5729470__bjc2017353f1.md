caption: Differences in pathway activation between left-sided vs right-sided CRC.
  (A) Phosphorylated proteins that are differentially expressed (P<0.05) between left-sided
  and right-sided CRC were analysed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and found to
  be enriched in ErbB and Wnt signalling. Enrichment is calculated against the list
  of analysed proteins. The indicated threshold of −log (P-value)=1.3 corresponds
  to P=0.05. Expression data were overlaid on a schematic representation of the ErbB
  (B) and Wnt pathways (C) showing a higher activation of all measured proteins in
  left-sided colon. The red colour gradient of the proteins represents the fold change
  between left- and right-sided CRC, with a darker colour indicating a greater fold-change.
  White proteins are part of the pathway but have not been analysed in this project.
