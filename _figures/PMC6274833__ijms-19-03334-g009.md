caption: Schematic representation of the biological activities of KM and its effects
  on the AGE-induced mitochondrial/cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis pathway in GMCs.
  The thick blue arrows represent the order of action, the thin blue arrows represent
  the effects of drug intervention, the black arrow represents the decrease in mitochondrial
  membrane potential, the light green dots represent the release of cytochrome c in
  mitochondria, and the different color is for differentiate between different parts
  and proteins in the cell.
