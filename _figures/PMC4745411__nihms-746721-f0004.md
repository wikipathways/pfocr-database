caption: Mechanisms of action of PBM. The two principal chromophores are cytochrome
  c oxidase (CCO) which is unit IV in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and TRPV
  ion channels. Photon absorption leads to dissociation of inhibitory nitric oxide
  from CCO leading to increased enzyme activity and raised ATP production and a burst
  of reactive oxygen species. The extra ATP produced can activate the Na+/K+ ATPase
  pump. Another type of calcium ion channel called “transient receptor potential vanilloid”
  (TRPV) is activated by both visible and infrared light. Calcium signaling is a very
  important pathway in multiple cell types.
