caption: The GNB/LNB pathway and related enzymes. LNB (Galβ1,3GlcNAc) and GNB (Galβ1,3GalNAc)
  liberated from HMOs with a type 1 chain and mucin glycoproteins by LnbB and EngBF,
  respectively, might be captured by GL-BP, imported into the cell, and then phosphorolytically
  cleaved into Gal 1-P and the respective N-acetylhexosamines (GlcNAc and GalNAc).
  The former can undergo glycolysis via the Leloir-like pathway (GalE and GalT), and
  the latter can enter the aminosugar metabolic cycle after phosphorylation by NahK.
  Prior to the actions of LnbB and EngBF, α-1,2-fucosyl residues were removed by AfcA.
