caption: A) Synaptic NMDAR signalling suppresses the intrinsic apoptosis cascade at
  multiple levels. Synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity protects
  neurons against apoptosis in a manner that is independent of the type of cellular
  insult because it suppresses the core apoptotic pathway. Transcriptional suppression
  of the BH3-only domain gene Puma by activation of synaptic NMDARs is a key event
  upstream of cytochrome c release (A) , . Up-regulation of a battery of nuclear Ca2+-regulated
  genes (green box) is also strongly protective ,  and probably also acts upstream
  of cytochrome c release, as it inhibits insult-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization
  (B). Downstream of cytochrome c release, transcriptional suppression of components
  of the caspase cascade, such as Apaf-1, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3, also slows the
  apoptotic process (C) or raises the amount of mitochondrial cytochrome c release
  that is required to initiate apoptosis (as cytochrome c’s cytoplasmic target is
  Apaf-1) . Synaptic NMDAR activity also induces inactivation of the pro-death transcription
  factors FOXO and p53 (D) , , , and the subsequent suppression of the genes whose
  expression they regulate. Finally, transcription factors that have been shown to
  be important targets for NMDAR-dependent pro-survival signals are shown, namely
  CREB, NFAT and NFI-A (E) , , .B) Synaptic NMDAR signalling boosts intrinsic antioxidant
  defences. A schematic showing the effect of synaptic activity-induced changes in
  transcription on the thioredoxin (Trx)-peroxiredoxin (Prx) system. The dotted arrows
  indicate activity-dependent signalling events, which are collectively shaded in
  green. Briefly, reduction of peroxide levels is executed via the transfer of electrons
  from NADPH to peroxides through the redox-active sulfhydryl (-SH) groups of thioredoxin
  reductase, Trx and Prxs (the major two-cysteine Prx sub-type is shown). The catalytic
  redox-active cysteine residue of Prx (Sc, red) reduces peroxide, and is oxidized
  to cysteine sulfenic acid (SCOH). The resolving cysteine (SR, green) of a different
  Prx molecule then forms a disulfide bond with Prx-SCOH, thereby eliminating H2O.
  This intermolecular disulfide bond is then reduced by Trx, whose two-cysteine active
  site is reduced by Trx reductase. However, if levels of peroxide are too high, the
  – SCOH group becomes hyperoxidized to –SO2H (cysteine sulfinic acid). –SO2H is not
  a substrate for the resolving cysteine –SCH or for Trx. Instead, sulfiredoxin (and
  possibly sestrin 2) catalyses the reduction of hyperoxidized Prx-SO2H, returning
  it to the Trx cycle. Synaptic activity triggers the events shown to both enhance
  Trx activity and boost the reduction of hyperoxidized Prxs. These include the transcriptional
  activation of sulfiredoxin and sestrin 2, and the transcriptional suppression of
  Txnip, the gene encoding a the Trx inhibitor thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip).
