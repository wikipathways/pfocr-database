caption: Activation of the KEAP1-NRF2 and HSF1 pathways by electrophilic lipoxidation
  products. To survive, cells have developed an intricate set of stress signaling
  pathways that are activated by endogenous or exogenous signals . Central to these
  defenses are the KEAP1-NRF2 and HSF1 pathways that together regulate hundreds of
  genes via binding to antioxidant response and heat shock elements, respectively
  , . A) The main signaling proteins of KEAP1-NRF2 pathway are the transcription factor
  NRF2 and its negative regulator protein KEAP1, which is a cullin-3 (CUL3)-RING ubiquitin
  ligase adaptor/scaffold protein enabling rapid proteasomal degradation of NRF2 during
  unstressed conditions. NRF2 is bound by the BTB domains of the KEAP1 dimer via DLG
  and ETGE motifs residing in NRF2 Neh2 domain. During the activation by e.g. lipid-derived
  electrophiles, the proteasomal degradation machinery is disrupted and de novo synthetized
  NRF2 is free to enter the nucleus to heterodimerize with the members of the musculoaponeurotic
  fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog protein family (sMAF) and drive the expression of
  cytoprotective genes . SH; Sulfhydryl group of free cysteine residue, Ub; Ubiquitin.
  B) The HSF1 pathway consists of inactive HSF1 monomer that is bound by heat shock
  proteins from HSP90α  and HSP70  families. HSF1 is negatively regulated by HSPs
  . During stress, the interaction is disrupted and HSF1 trimerizes and enters the
  nucleus to regulate the heat shock response genes . While the two pathways are largely
  distinct, they converge at the level of shared stimulus (e.g. electrophilic lipid
  peroxidation products) and mode of action (i.e. modification of redox-active cysteines
  that are regarded as molecular “switches”) .
