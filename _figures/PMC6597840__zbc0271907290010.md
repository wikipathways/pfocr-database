caption: Model depicting DDR-induced respiration. DDR, in a Mec1p- and Rad53p-dependent
  way, regulates dNTP synthesis by a bifurcating mechanism. In one well-established
  branch of the pathway, Dun1p inactivates Crt1p, Sml1p, and Dif1p, leading to increased
  RNR activity and dNTP synthesis. In the second branch of the pathway, Mec1p and
  Rad53p down-regulate transcription of histone genes. Decreased histone levels result
  in altered chromatin structure and induction of TCA cycle and ETC genes required
  for respiration. A direct outcome of elevated respiration is increased production
  of ATP, a potent allosteric activator for the RNR enzyme, increased synthesis of
  dNTPs, and improved cell survival.
