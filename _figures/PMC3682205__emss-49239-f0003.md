caption: 'Cues that induce and inhibit protein synthesis antagonistically regulate
  the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates cap-dependent
  mRNA translation by phosphorylating its two major targets: eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6
  kinase (S6K). Protein synthesis-inducing cues, such as netrin 1 or brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF), may increase mTOR activity through the AKT–mTOR pathway
  by activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or by promoting ubiquitin–proteasome
  system (UPS)-mediated degradation of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), or
  through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–mTOR pathway by activating MAPK
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), that inhibits the mTOR negative
  regulators tuberous sclerosis protein 1 (TSC1) and TSC2. Some cues, such as ephrin
  A, can inhibit protein synthesis by inhibiting ERK1/2 leading to TSC1/2 activation
  and mTOR inhibition. Spatiotemporal summation of cue-induced signals converging
  on mTOR might lead to asymmetric translational activity. DCC, deleted in colorectal
  carcinoma (netrin 1 receptor); PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase

  phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (also known as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3).'
