caption: The PI3K/AKT and cell cycle signaling pathway model of NKTCL. MiRNAs can
  influence almost every cellular behavior from transcription to translation by diverse
  mechanisms including the cell cycle and the PI3K/AKT pathways, among others. All
  the miRNAs in this figure are upregulated in NKTCL sample, except miRNA-150. This
