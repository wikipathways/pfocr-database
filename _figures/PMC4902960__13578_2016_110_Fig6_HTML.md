caption: Activation of NF-κB and STATs signaling pathway in ZIKV-infected hNPCs. Cytokines
  (IL-1 and TNF-α), PAMPs, CD40 and CXCL12 interact with their receptors resulting
  in activation of the NF-κB pathway. IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-12 binding to their receptors
  induces STAT dimerization and translocation to the nucleus. Activation of both the
  canonical NF-κB and STAT signaling pathways, results in the production of numerous
  inflammatory cytokines.
