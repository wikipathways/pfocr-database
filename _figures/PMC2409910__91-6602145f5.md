caption: Schematic description of the apoptotic pathway in PC3 cells treated with
  DIM. Exposure of PC3 cells to DIM triggers the release of cytochrome c from the
  mitochondria. As a result, initiator caspase 9 is cleaved and activated, and cleaves
  and activates the effector caspases 3 and 6. These caspases cleave vital cell proteins
  such as PARP and cause the typical morphological and biochemical characteristics
  of apoptosis in these cells.
