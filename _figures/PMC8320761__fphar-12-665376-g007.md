caption: Atractylodin attenuates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis by alleviating
  gut microbiota dysbiosis and inhibiting inflammatory response through the MAPK pathway.
  The mechanism could likely be attributed to the effect of atractylodin in inhibiting
  the MAPK pathway; inhibiting the activation of macrophages in colon tissue; inhibiting
  the decrease in tight junction proteins, ZO-1, occludin, and MUC2 to protect the
  intestinal barrier; decreasing the abundance of harmful bacteria and increasing
  that of beneficial bacteria, thereby improving the overall intestinal microflora.
  In vitro experiments revealed that atractylodin could inhibit the MAPK pathway and
  macrophage activation. Atractylodin could not inhibit the transcription of TNF-α
  but could inhibit its translation, which might be related to its effect of inhibiting
  the malonylation of the GAPDH protein.
