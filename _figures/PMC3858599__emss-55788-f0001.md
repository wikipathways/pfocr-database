caption: The first step of the NAD+de novo biosynthesis is the conversion of tryptophan
  into N-formylkynurenine through an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by either indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). N-Formylkynurenine is
  then converted in four successive enzymatic reactions into α-Amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde
  (ACMS), which can undergo either enzymatic conversion directed to total oxidation
  or spontaneous cyclization to quinolinic acid. The following step is the formation
  of nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) through the quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase
  (QPRT) activity. NAMN is then transformed to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide
  (NAAD) by the nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) enzymes. The
  final step in the biosynthesis of NAD+ is the amidation of NAAD by the NAD synthase
  enzyme. NAD+ is also synthesized through the NAD+ salvage pathway from its precursors
  NA, NAM, or NR. From NA, the first step in NAD+synthesis is catalyzed by nicotinic
  acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPT) and leads to the formation of NAMN. Similarly,
  NAM is converted by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), forming NMN,
  which is also the product of phosphorylation of NR by nicotinamide riboside kinase
  (NRK). Both NAMN and NMN are then converted by NMNAT, after which the NAMN-derived
  NAAD requires the final amidation through NAD synthase.
