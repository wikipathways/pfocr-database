caption: Discovery of new diazo-containing natural products may reveal chemical and
  biosynthetic diversity. A) Select diazo-containing natural products. B) Known diazo-forming
  enzymes perform diazotization or hydrazide condensation followed by non-enzymatic
  oxidation. Azaserine biosynthesis proceeds through enzymatic hydrazone formation,
  however, the hydrazone oxidoreductase has not yet been identified. C) Our genome
  mining efforts combined with previously reported efforts reveal 440 putative diazo-natural
  product-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters from diverse sources. As previous publications
  used enzymes from only four diazo-containing natural product biosynthetic pathways
  as queries, there are likely many additional diazo compound-encoding biosynthetic
  gene clusters that are not represented here
