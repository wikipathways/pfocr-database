caption: TGF-β and BMPs signaling pathways in osteogenesis. TGF-βs and BMPs bind to
  the extracellular domains of specific receptors and require Sma and Mad related
  (SMAD) proteins for signal transduction within the cells. TGF-βs and BMPs work through
  heterodimeric receptors consisting of type I and type II kinase receptors. TβRI/ALK5
  is the type I receptor for TGF-βs, and BMPR1A/ALK3, BMPR1B/ALK6 and AcvR1/ALK2 are
  type I receptors for BMPs. TβRII/TGFBR2 and BMPR2 are the type II kinase receptor
  for TGF-βs and BMPs, respectively. Upon binding of the ligand to the receptor, the
  receptor forms homodimeric complexes, resulting in one subunit phosphorylating its
  partner subunit on the serine/threonine residues. This starts a cascade of events
  involving SMAD protein phosphorylation. The TGF-β pathway requires SMAD2 and SMAD3,
  whereas BMP signaling is dependent on SMAD1, 5 and 8. Phosphorylated receptor-regulated
  SMADs (R-SMAD) react with SMAD4 to create a heterocomplex. This complex, consisting
  of R-SMAD and common-mediator SMAD (Co-SMAD), enters the nucleus and controls transcription
  by binding to target gene promoters. Phosphorylated R-SMAD (R-SMAD-Pi) interacts
  with SMAD4 protein, then translocates into the cell nucleus where AMP response element
  binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and P300 coactivators are recruited
  which regulate gene targets. SMAD2/3-Pi in the nucleus and SMAD4-unlinked recruit
  HDAC4 and HDAC5 by inhibiting RUNX2 and OSX expression. In the Non-Smad-dependent
  signaling pathway, TGF-β activates kinase 1 (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1)
  to initiate the MKKs (MAPK pathway member-encoding genes kinases)-p38 MAPK or -Erk
  (extracellular signal regulated kinase) signaling cascades. Interaction between
  BMPs and their receptors result in comparable events triggered by TGF‐β. In BMP
  signaling, R-SMAD (SMAD1/5/8) bind SMAD4 to translocate into the nucleus, where
  they induce RUNX2 expression. Similarly, Non-Smad-dependent BMP-stimulated pathway
  induces DLX5, RUNX2, and OSX expression and leads to osteoblast and osteocyte differentiation.
  Latent TGF-beta binding proteins (LTBPs) bind TGF-β and prevent its interaction
  with TβRI and TβRII receptors; otherwise, Noggin, Chordin, Gremlin and Follistatin
  bind to BMP proteins and block their signaling cascades. In TGF- β signaling, SMAD7
  inhibits SMAD2/3 translocation into the nucleus, and, alongside Smurf2 induces R-SMAD
  proteasome-mediated degradation. Similarly, in BMP signaling, SMAD6/7 inhibit SMAD1/5/8
  translocation into the nucleus and, alongside Smurf1/2 induces SMAD1/5/8 and RUNX2
  proteasome-mediated degradation. In turn, SMAD6 expression is regulated by RUNX2
  in a negative feedback loop. ARKADIA protein positively regulates osteoblast differentiation
  by binding SMAD6/7 proteins.
