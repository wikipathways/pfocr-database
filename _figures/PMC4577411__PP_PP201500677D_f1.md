caption: Model of the ethylene (ET) signaling pathway to ERFs. In the absence of ethylene
  (left), the ethylene receptors promote CTR1 kinase activity, resulting in the phosphorylation
  of the C-terminal domain of EIN2. Because of the protein turnover involving the
  F-box proteins ETP1/2 and EBF1/2, the protein levels of both EIN2 and EIN3/EIL1
  are extremely low. In the presence of ethylene (right), the inactivation of the
  ethylene receptors and CTR1 results in the dephosphorylation and cleavage of the
  EIN2 C terminus and translocation to the nucleus, where they regulate EIN3/EIL1
  activation directly or indirectly. The direct targets of EIN3 are the  genes ERFs,
  such as ERF1, which activates, depending on the stress conditions (either biotic
  [pathogen infection] or abiotic [e.g. dehydration, salinity, or heat shock] stress),
  a specific set of stress response genes by binding to the specific cis-acting GCC
  box and DRE elements. ER, Endoplasmic reticulum; ECIP1, EIN2 C-TERMINUS INTERACTING
  PROTEIN1.
