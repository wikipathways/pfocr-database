caption: 'Role of GPx4 in the ferroptosis regulatory pathway: (a) GPx4 catalytic cycle
  representation. Under the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides (PLOOH) into their respective
  alcohols (PLOH), catalyzed by GPx4, GPx4 selenol (GPx4-SeH) is oxidized into selenic
  acid (GPx4-SeOH). Selenic acid is reduced to its active form, selenol, by a two-step
  reaction with GSH: The first GSH reacts with selenic acid to form a selenium–glutathione
  intermediate (GPx4-Se-SG), which is reduced by the second GSH to selenol. (b) Regulation
  of ferroptosis by GPx4. The conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of
  phospholipids to peroxide PUFAs represents the initiation step to drive ferroptotic
  cell death. The phospholipid hydroperoxides (PE-OOH) are formed via non-enzymatic
  and enzymatic lipid peroxidation. The increased cytosolic labile iron pool (LIP)
  activates Fenton reactions and generates •OH radicals, which initiate non-enzymatic
  lipid peroxidation with the formation of PE-OOH, and their levels can be raised
  by 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) activity. GPx4 catalyzes the reduction of toxic PE-OOH
  into nontoxic alcohol, ultimately inhibiting ferroptosis. The amino acid antiporter
  system xc- (composed of SLC3A2 and SLC7A11 subunits) mediates the exchange of intracellular
  glutamate and extracellular cystine, which is converted into cysteine, contributing
  to GSH synthesis. Inhibition of the key enzyme of GSH synthesis—γGCL (buthionine
  sulfoximine, BSO)—and SLC7A11 (erastin, sulfasalazine, sorafenib) leads to the activation
  of ferroptosis through GSH depletion. A selenocysteine residue is added to the catalytic
  center of GPx4 with the use of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), leading to GPx4
  activation and ferroptosis inhibition. IPP is generated via the mevalonate pathway:
  acetyl-CoA is converted to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). HMG-CoA is
  reduced by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) to mevalonate, which,
  in turn, is converted to IPP. IPP also generates coenzymeQ10 (ubiquinone, CoQ10),
  which is reduced to ubiquinol by ferroptosis-suppressor-protein 1 (FSP1), blocking
  lipid peroxidation. The ferroptotic inducer FIN56 works through a dual mechanism
  of depleting GPX4 protein and CoQ10 levels'
