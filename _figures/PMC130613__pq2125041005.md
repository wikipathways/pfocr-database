caption: 'Aβ modulation of PKA/CREB pathway: a working hypothesis. (A) After binding
  with a putative membrane receptor Aβ inhibits adenylate cyclase (AC), leading to
  lower cAMP levels {1}, which shifts the equilibrium in the PKA complex toward the
  inactive tetramer {2}. As a consequence, the transcription factor CREB cannot be
  phosphorylated {3} and initiate transcription. Later, the lower cAMP levels lead
  to a decrease in proteosomal degradation of the RIIα subunit (R) {4}, resulting
  in its accumulation and a further shift of equilibrium toward the tetramer. (B)
  Rolipram and forskolin act to increase the intracellular levels of cAMP either decreasing
  its degradation by the phosphodiesterase PDE4 (rolipram) or increasing its synthesis
  by adenylate cyclase (forskolin) {1}. The increased cAMP levels can counteract Aβ
  effects on PKA. Four cAMP molecules cooperatively bind to one RIIα molecule, inducing
  a conformational change and reducing its affinity for the catalytic subunit (C)
  {2}. The freed catalytic subunit is activated and can phosphorylate CREB at Ser-133
  {3}. The accumulation of cAMP could also drive the degradation of RIIα restoring
  the residual function of the proteasome (Pr) {4}, further shifting PKA to the active
  state. P, phosphoric group.'
