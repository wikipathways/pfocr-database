caption: Working model of cellular mechanisms giving rise to pLTF. Intermittent activation
  of serotonergic 5-HT2 receptors during hypoxic episodes activates protein kinase
  C (PKC). This, in turn, initiates new BDNF protein synthesis and increases NADPH
  oxidase (NOX) activity. After BDNF binds its high affinity receptor, TrkB, downstream
  signaling molecules include ERK MAP kinases. Although less clear, we suggest that
  ERK activity increases synaptic strength between descending respiratory pre-motor
  neurons and phrenic motor neurons, thereby expressing pLTF. Protein phosphatases
  (PP2A/5) normally constrain pLTF. However, ROS formation via NADPH oxidase activity
  inhibits these phosphatases and relieves their inhibitory constraint to pLTF. When
  this pathway is activated chronically, we propose that increased gene transcription
  occurs (i.e. in the cell nucleus), enhancing the expression of elements critical
  in this form of plasticity. For further detail, see ztext.340×241mm (600 × 600 DPI)
