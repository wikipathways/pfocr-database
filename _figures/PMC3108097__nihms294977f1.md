caption: 'Activation of STAT1/3 by cytokine signaling promotes transcription through
  a STAT element. IL-6 plays a predominant role in this inflammatory response. This
  element appears to be regulated through the nearby BMP-RE1 via SMAD activation,
  which is required for full promoter activity. A distal BMP-RE2 site is thought interact
  with the SMAD/STAT complex that brings distal and proximal regions of the hepcidin
  promoter into physical contact. SMAD signaling is activated through the HJV/BMP
  pathway. HJV is negatively regulated by matripase-2 cleavage; BMP signaling is negatively
  regulated by GDF15 and TWSG1. HFE interacts with TfR1 and may be released upon binding
  of diferric Tf. While binding of both diferric Tf and HFE to the TfR2 are known
  to stimulate hepcidin synthesis, the molecular aspects of this pathway remain unknown.
  In addition, ER stress response pathways involved in inflammation are known to induce
  hepcidin through at least two mechanisms: 1) negative regulation of C/EBPα by CHOP
  and 2) activation of CREBH, possibly in conjunction with activated (spliced) XBP-1.'
