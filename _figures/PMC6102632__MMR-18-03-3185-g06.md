caption: Schematic diagram of the beneficial effects and potential mechanisms of GK
  against ischemic insults. GK dose-dependently decreased OGD-induced ischemic neuronal
  damages, which may be mediated by downregulation of MAPK pathway, as well as suppression
  of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and p53. GK, ginkgolide K; OGD, oxygen-glucose deprivation;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
papertitle: Ginkgolide K protects SH-SY5Y cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced
  injury by inhibiting the p38 and JNK signaling pathways.
