caption: 'NO has pre- and postsynaptic effects in ACs. A, left: simplified cartoon
  of a GABAergic AC (light shading) in the retina receiving excitatory glutamatergic
  input from a bipolar cell (BC) and presynaptic to another AC. Right: NO synthesis
  in a NOS expressing AC (dark shading) can elicit changes in both pre- and postsynaptic
  processes. B: expanded view of the box in A, depicting presynaptic and postsynaptic
  effects of NO. Top: activation of a Ca2+-dependent isoform of NOS (eNOS or nNOS)
  produces NO (1). NO activates a voltage-independent Ca2+-permeable plasma membrane
  channel, possibly via S-nitrosylation (S-NO?) of a TRPC channel, to admit Ca2+ into
  the presynaptic terminal (2). Ca2+ elevations in the presynaptic terminal lead to
  increased vesicle fusion events and GABA release (3) onto its postsynaptic partner.
  VGCC, voltage-gated Ca2+ channel; GluR, ionotropic glutamate receptor. Bottom: NO
  diffuses into the postsynaptic terminal and induces Cl− release from acidic organelles
  (4) (). Increased Cl− concentration in the postsynaptic terminal reverses the Cl−
  gradient, converting typical GABAergic inhibition into depolarization (5) (). Depolarization
  (+) leads to activation of VGCCs in an adjacent presynaptic site in the same process
  (6). Ca2+ influx through activated VGCCs leads to enhanced GABA release (7). The
  postsynaptic partner that is downstream from the targets of NO will experience increased
  inhibition (8).'
