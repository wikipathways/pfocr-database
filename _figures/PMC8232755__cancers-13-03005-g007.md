caption: Dlx5 cooperates with activated Akt (MyrAkt) to accelerate T-cell lymphoma
  in a GEM model. The Wnt pathway was activated when mouse T-cells expressed both
  Dlx5 and MyrAkt2 transgenes. Inhibition of the β-catenin/Tcf complex resulted in
  apoptosis. β-catenin/Tcf directly transactivates several key components in the cholesterol
  synthesis pathway, such as Cyp51, Hmgcr, and Ncoa2. The augmented cholesterol synthesis
  at least partially underlies the oncogenic role of Wnt signaling, as statin treatment
  triggered cell death in these cells.
