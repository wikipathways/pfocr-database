caption: Chronic injury and development of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy
  (IF/TA). Continuous activation of myofibroblasts cause excessive deposition of extracellular
  matrix (ECM). Given enough time, the dense, fibrotic ECM perpetuates myofibroblast
  activation. Tubular dedifferentiation is impeded by cell senescence and apoptosis.
  Pathways such as the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and the transforming
  growth factor (TGF-ß) SMAD2/3 pathway play a key role in myofibroblast activation
  and therefore represent promising drug targets. TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor; IL-6,
  Interleukin 6; IL-1β, interleukin 1β. Created with BioRender.com.
