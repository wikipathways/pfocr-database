caption: 'Schematic illustration of the reaction network of apoptosis-inducing signaling
  pathways: the hypochlorous acid- and the nitric oxide/peroxynitrite pathway. Both
  pathways originate from superoxide anions and result in the formation of hydroxyl
  radicals, which are responsible for apoptosis-induction.'
