caption: Schematic illustration of the effects of simulated microgravity (SMG) on
  PaCa-44 cells. Under SMG, the cells leave their adhesion elongated shape and aggregate
  in 3D spheroidal structures. Indeed, SMG impacts on cellular morphology through
  the modulation of proteins involved in Cdc42 and RhoA signaling that in turn affect
  cytoskeletal organization, neo-angiogenesis and stemness. Cytoskeletal reorganization
  impairs cell biological processes and induces cancer cells to activate survival
  mechanisms, among which the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which supports
  autophagy to prevent cell death. The morphological rearrangement occurring during
  SMG additionally induces metabolic reprogramming orchestrated by the activation
  of HIF-1α and PI3K/Akt pathways, which pave the way for glucose metabolism upregulation.
  A more active glycolysis, compared to adhesion condition, is involved in the regulation
  of proliferation, metastasization, and aggressiveness. These metabolic changes,
  together with activation of PI3K/Akt/NF-κB/ERK5/IL-8 signaling axis induce the upregulation
  of stem-associated proteins and expansion of the CSC subset that supports neoplastic
  progression through EMT
