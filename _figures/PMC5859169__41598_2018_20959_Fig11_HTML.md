caption: Functional analysis of target genes (a) miR-30a-5p (b) miR-335 in KEGG pathway
  by ClueGo software in Cytoscape 3.2.1. The results of centiscape analysis elicited
  from the gene regulatory network and then the target genes of those hub nodes transferred
  into CluGo and were grouped with it as a functional cluster. Each node represents
  a KEGG pathways process, and their associated genes are represented as dots. All
  the nodes and their colors showed the functional group to which they belong. Edge
  of this functional analysis demonstrated the term-term interactions or term-genes
  interactions. The enrichment significant term showed by the size of each node.
