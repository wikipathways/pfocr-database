caption: 'Schematic diagram of pyroptosis pathways. The process of cell pyroptosis
  can be divided into 2 broad steps: GSDM activation and pyroptotic cell death. The
  first step includes several routes for active GSDMs to form nonselective pores in
  the plasma membrane and lead to cell death. (A) Canonical pathway. In the canonical
  pathway, upstream stimulation signals lead to inflammasome formation and activation
  of caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD and pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, thus
  leading to the pore-forming activity of the GSDMD-NT and the activation of IL-1β
  and IL-18. GSDMD-NT forms nonselective pores in the plasma membrane; initiates cell
  swelling with large bubbles, rupture, and the release of cell contents; and subsequently
  leads to cell death. (B) Non-canonical pathway. Caspase-4/5/11 directly recognizes
  LPS through the CARD domain, thus triggering oligomerization and activating proteolytic
  activity. Activated caspase-4/5/11 cleaves GSDMD and results in pyroptosis. The
  IL-1β/18 exudation relies on the activation of the canonical pathway. (C) Recent
  reports have suggested that Gzm A and Gzm B also induce pyroptosis through cleavage
  of GSDME or GSDMB. (D) Other pathways. Some molecules in apoptosis, such as caspase-3
  and caspase-8, have also been shown to be involved in pyroptosis. GSDME is the substrate
  for caspase-3 when it induces pyroptosis, and caspase-8 cleaves GSDMD and GSDMB.
  Caspase-3 also decreases pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMD at ASP87, thereby eliminating
  pore formation. In hypoxia, nuclear PD-L1 (nPD-L1) enhances the transcription of
  the GSDMC gene and directly regulates the caspase-8/GSDMC pyroptosis pathway. Remarkably,
  the ESCRT machinery may be involved in repairing membrane damage caused by GSDM
  activation.'
