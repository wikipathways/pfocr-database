caption: Diagram of key metabolic pathways (glycolysis, aerobic glycolysis, penthose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), and Kennedy pathway (KP)), transporters (GLUT1, MCT1),
  enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB)), and feedback metabolite flow between the
  RPE and the rods considered in our model. The metabolic pathway blocks represent
  several enzymatic reactions, and each reaction uses a specific metabolite as substrate
  to produce another metabolite. The RPE transports glucose from the choroid into
  the photoreceptors and keeps only a small portion to be converted into pyruvate
  through glycolysis. The transport is enabled by GLUT1. Once in the photoreceptors,
  glucose enters the glycolysis pathway from which intermediate metabolites are directed
  to the PPP and KP. Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, is reduced into lactate
  by aerobic glycolysis in the rods. Lactate is cleared from the rods, and transported
  to the interphotoreceptor matrix by MCT1, which also transports it into the RPE.
  Inside the RPE, lactate is converted to pyruvate by LDHB to be oxidized and processed
  by the tricarboxylic acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle.
