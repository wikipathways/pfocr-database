caption: Molecular interactions between Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) and Mast Cells
  (MCs). Tregs can produce IL-9 to promote MC recruitment and proliferation via IL-9R
  engagment. MCs can secrete IL-2 and expand the Treg population via stimulation of
  IL-2R. This mechanism involves the activation of JAK1 and JAK3, then activating
  STAT3 and STAT5, which translocate into the nucleus to increase the expression of
  the FoxP3 gene. The OX40/OX40L signalling pathway has bi-directional effects. OX40
  stimulation on MCs increases expression of cAMP and decreases cellular Ca2+ influx;
  as a result, FcεRI-dependent MC degranulation is suppressed, which blocks histamine
  release. On Tregs, OX40L signalling together with IL-6 can skew Tregs into IL-17-producing
  Th17-like cells. Histamine secreted by MCs binds to Histamine H1 receptor (HRH1)
  on Tregs and directly downregulates FoxP3 and CD25. TGF-β1 secreted by Tregs can
  inhibit FcεRI signalling in MCs and prevent their activation. On the other hand,
  MC-derived TGF-β1 can promote the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Tregs.
