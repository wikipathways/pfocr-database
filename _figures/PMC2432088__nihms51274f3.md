caption: Wnt signaling begins with Frizzled (FZD) receptors resulting in the activation
  of Dishevelled (DVL) followed by the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3β),
  Axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein complex. The
  suppressed GSK-3β, Axin and APC complex prevents phosphorylation (p) of β-catenin
  and leads to the accumulation of β-catenin. β-catenin enters into cellular nucleus
  and contributes to the formation of Lef/Tcf lymphocyte enhancer factor/T cell factor
  (Lef/Tcf) and β-catenin complex that may cooperate with factors activated by other
  signaling pathways resulting in cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival
  and apoptosis through the induction of target nuclear gene transcription. Interconnected
  pathways with Wnt involve IκB kinase (IKK), IκB, inhibitors of apoptotic protein
  (IAPs), the forkhead family members (FOXO), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β),
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), cytochrome c,
  (Cyto-c), and caspases. Ultimately these pathways converge upon early apoptotic
  injury with phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and later apoptotic DNA degradation.
