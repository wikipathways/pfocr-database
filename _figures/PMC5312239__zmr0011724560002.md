caption: Flavivirus life cycle and fusion mechanism. (A) The virus enters cells by
  receptor-mediated endocytosis and fuses its membrane by an acidic-pH-triggered mechanism
  in the endosome to release the viral RNA. The positive-stranded genomic RNA serves
  as the only viral mRNA and leads to the synthesis of a polyprotein that is co- and
  posttranslationally processed into three structural and seven nonstructural proteins.
  Virus assembly takes place at the ER membrane and leads to the formation of immature
  virions, which are further transported through the exocytic pathway. The acidic
  pH in the TGN causes structural changes that allow the cleavage of prM by the cellular
  protease furin and lead to the herringbone-like arrangement of E ( and ). At acidic
  pH, the cleaved pr part remains associated with the particles (preventing premature
  fusion in the TGN) and falls off at the neutral pH of the extracellular environment.
  Subviral particles (SVPs) are formed as a by-product of virion assembly and contain
  a lipid membrane and prM-E complexes but lack a capsid. SVPs are transported, processed,
  and released like whole virions. (B) Schematic of flavivirus membrane fusion. The
  acidic pH in the endosome causes the dissociation of the E dimer and exposure of
  the FL, which mediates the interaction with endosomal membranes. Further structural
  changes lead to the relocation of DIII and the formation of a trimer in a hairpin-like
  structure in which the FL and the TM regions are juxtaposed. These rearrangements
  provide the energy for membrane fusion and result in the merger of the two lipid
  bilayers. Color codes are as described in the legend of .
