caption: The model of Egr-1/GGPPS/Erk1/2 pathway regulating insulin resistance in
  hyperinsulinism. Egr-1 is greatly increased in hyperinsulinism and in insulin resistance
  through activation of the Erk1/2 MAPK pathway. The highly expressed Egr-1 can reactivate
  Erk1/2 by triggering GGPPS transcription and promoting Ras membrane association.
  Furthermore, the sustained activation of Erk1/2 can phosphorylate IRS-1 on Ser612
  and inhibit its activity. Insulin resistance eventually results from impaired glucose
  uptake.
