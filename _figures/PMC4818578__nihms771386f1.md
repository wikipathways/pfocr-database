caption: 'Schematic representation of known redox-sensitive signalling pathways which
  regulate cellular aging and age-related CVDs. Arrows denote positive activation
  of downstream targets. Blunt-ended arrow denotes inhibitory effects. Dashed arrow
  denotes cross-talk between pathways. Secreted Klotho prolongs lifespan by increasing
  the expression of antioxidant genes via Nrf-1/2 or by inhibiting IGF-1 signalling.
  Binding of growth hormones, such as IGF-1 to their respective receptors or oxidative
  stress leads to autophosphorylation of β-subunits on the IGF-1R, leading to subsequent
  activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3 results in
  nuclear exclusion and inhibition of FOXO3-mediated transcription of target antioxidants,
  such as MnSOD and Gpx. Oxidative stress induces phosphorylation and translocation
  of p66Shc via PKCβ and Pin1 to the mitochondrial inner membrane leading to cytochrome
  c-mediated apoptosis. ROS also causes post-translational modification of p53 resulting
  in its activation triggering p21cip-mediated cell senescence. Akt activation or
  p53-induced transcriptional activation of Mdm2 leads to ubiquitination-dependent
  degradation of FOXO3. Abbreviations: PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; s-Klotho,
  secreted Klotho.'
