caption: 'There are at least 3 models that could explain the apparent paradox associated
  with the continued analgesic efficacy of benzodiazepine receptor agonist in the
  face of a shift in the valence of GABAA receptor antagonist effects in the presence
  of persistent inflammation. All 3 require a functional separation between depolarizing
  shifts in Cl− equilibrium potential and γ2 containing GABAA receptors (i.e., those
  receptors responsive to benzodiazepines). Panel A: Separation in two subpopulations
  of dorsal horn neurons: In this model, γ2 containing GABAA receptors are enriched
  in a subpopulation of dorsal horn neurons critical for the establishment of nociceptive
  threshold and/or the perception of pain (i.e., dorsal horn projection neuron, star
  1). There is no shift in Eanion in these neurons, so that GABAA receptor activation
  is inhibitory, and facilitation of this receptor activation by benzodiazepines is
  analgesic (star 1). The γ2-containing neuron is post-synaptic to both GABAergic
  input and excitatory interneurons. A depolarizing shift in Eanion in these excitatory
  interneurons results in a shift in the valence of GABAAsignaling and a GABA-mediated
  facilitation of nociceptive behavior (star 2). The density of γ2-containing GABAA
  receptors in these interneurons would have to be relatively low such that benzodiazepines
  do not facilitate excitatory GABAergic transmission. The majority of lamina I–II
  neurons are interneurons (~90%) and these neurons may account for reduced KCC2 expression
  and excitatory synaptic GABAA responses (star 2) observed following peripheral nerve
  injury (PNI). Such a model could also account for changes observed in the presence
  of inflammation if the GABAA receptors on these excitatory interneurons have a higher
  affinity for muscimol. Panel B: Separation within a dorsal horn neuron: A differential
  distribution of γ2 containing GABAA receptors and cation-Cl− co-transporters within
  a dorsal horn neuron critical for nociceptive behavior and the perception of pain
  could underlie relatively localized changes in Eanion. In this model, there would
  be little or no change in Eanion around γ2 containing receptors following tissue
  injury (star 1), whereas a depolarizing shift in Eanion near receptors with a high
  affinity for muscimol would confer the facilitation of nociceptive transmission
  observed in the presence of persistent inflammation (star 2). Importantly, such
  a model is unlikely to account for changes observed following PNI given that a depolarizing
  shift in Eanion appears to impact the response to both exogenous and endogenous
  GABAA receptor activation, suggesting that the shift in Eanion is relatively uniform
  in these neurons. Panel C: Separation with the central terminals of primary afferent
  neurons. This model is analogous to that described for Panel B, except that the
  separation of γ2-containing receptors and depolarizing shifts in Eanion occur in
  the primary afferent. A subset of dorsal horn interneurons make axo-axonic synapses
  onto incoming afferent fibers (star 1). While the subcellular localization of GABAA
  subunits and/or NKCC1 is not known in these afferent axons, mechanisms involving
  the localization of midazolam-sensitive (γ2-containing) GABAA receptors coupled
  with differences in the localization of inflammation-induced plasticity in Cl− gradients
  (via changes in NKCC1 expression, localization or activity) could yield pharmacological
  profiles that account for the preservation of antinociceptive effects of midazolam
  observed in the presence of both inflammation and nerve injury (star 2).'
