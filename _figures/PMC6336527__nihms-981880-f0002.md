caption: DNA damage induced by UVR stabilizes p53, which subsequently promotes transcriptional
  activation of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene. POMC is cleaved to yield multiple
  peptides, including α-MSH and the opioid β-endorphin. Stimulation of the MC1R signaling
  pathway by α-MSH ligand activates the cAMP-CREB-MITF cascade in melanocytes, resulting
  in the synthesis of melanin and eventual transfer of melanosomes to keratinocytes
  for protection against UV. β-endorphin has been shown to be involved in mood-related
  effects and analgesia dependency. In addition, salt inducible kinases (SIKs) phosphorylates
  the cAMP-regulated transcriptional co-activator (CRTC) family of proteins, thereby
  preventing translocation of CRTC to the nucleus and eventually leading to inhibition
  of transcriptional activation of MITF. UV absorption by 7-dyhrocholesterol (7-DHC)
  forms vitamin D3, an inactive form of vitamin D in keratinocytes.
