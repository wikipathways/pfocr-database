  form an amino acid transport heterodimer that facilitates the reverse transport
  of BCAAs into cytoplasm under the stimulation of extracellular inflammatory factors.
  The intracellular BCAAs activate the mTOR signaling pathway, which is otherwise
  suppressed by GSK3β. Activation of mTOR enhances the transcription of ARRB1, leading
  to the upregulation of IL-6, MMP-9, and ADAMTS expression. This process contributes
  to increased oxidative stress (ROS). Dashed lines indicate inhibition of enzymatic
  activity, and the “×” symbol represents pathway blockage
