caption: A model for ligand concentration–dependent dual endocytic trafficking of
  EGFR. Ligand binding induces dimerization of cell-surface EGFR and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent
  endocytosis (canonical endocytosis, shown in red). In addition, canonically activated
  EGFR induces p38 activation, which leads to serine/threonine phosphorylation– and
  clathrin-dependent endocytosis of monomeric EGFR (non-canonical pathway, shown in
  green). Thus, ligand-induced EGFR trafficking involves the complex parallel events
  of canonical and non-canonical endocytosis, which are balanced by the ligand concentration,
  reflecting the initial ligand occupation rate. Under low-ligand conditions, a large
  amount of ligand-unbound EGFR is internalized via the non-canonical pathway and
  then recycled back to the cell surface. Conversely, ligand-occupied EGFR is internalized
  mainly via the canonical pathway under high-ligand conditions, which is preferentially
  sorted to the lysosome for degradation. CME, clathrin-mediated endocytosis; CIE,
  clathrin-independent endocytosis.
