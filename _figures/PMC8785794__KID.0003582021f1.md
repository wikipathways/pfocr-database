caption: Kidney diseases have several targets for multi-target drugs. In CKD, diabetes
  and hypertension contribute to 70%–80% of all patients with CKD (top). Factors contributing
  to CKD include endothelial dysfunction, TGF-β signaling, inflammation, hypoxia,
  mitochondrial injury, and oxidative stress. Kidney injury in CKD involves the mesangial
  matrix, podocyte damage, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and glomerulosclerosis. AKI
  can be caused by drug toxicity, ischemia during thoracic surgeries, and septic infections
  (bottom left). Therapeutic targets for AKI include hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)
  signaling, mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species (ROS), peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)/PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) pathway,
  and fructokinase signaling and inflammation. For glomerular diseases, therapeutic
  targets include mesangial cells and TNFα; leukocytes and complement 5 (C5); neutrophils
  and macrophages and TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 signaling; T cells and TNFα/intracellular
  adhesion molecule (ICAM), and signaling pathways resulting in podocyte damage (bottom
  right).
