caption: 'The metabolic pathway of GABA. GABA is converted to succinate in a two‐step
  sequence catalyzed by GABA‐transaminase (GABA‐T; generating succinic semialdehyde
  (SSA)) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). The latter is the site of
  the defective enzyme in patients who manifest accumulation of γ‐hydroxybutyric acid
  (GHB) in body fluids (cross‐hatched box). Intermediates quantified in the current
  study included vigabatrin (VGB; irreversible inhibitor of GABA‐T), GABA, β‐ALA (β‐alanine),
  4‐GBA (4‐guanidinobutyrate), and creatine. The latter is postulated to derive from
  interference of increased GABA in the AGAT (arginine amidinotransferase) reaction,
  which catalyzes the formation of guanidinoacetate (GAA) from ARG (arginine) and
  GLY (glycine). Additional abbreviations: AKR7a2, aldo‐keto reductase 7a2; MSA, malonic
  semialdehyde. Upward pointing arrows indicate predicted elevations in animal tissues
  with administration of VGB, and dashed lines indicate postulated reactions or predicted
  decreases, the latter in the case of creatine'
