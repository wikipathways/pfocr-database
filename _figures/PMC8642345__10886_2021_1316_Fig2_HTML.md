caption: Engineered pathways for production of mono- and di-unsaturated C12 pheromone
  precursors in Camelina seeds. FFA, free fatty acids. TAG, triacylglycerol. The introduced
  enzymes are indicated in blue. Acyl intermediates in the pathway are given as short
  forms. E9 -12:CoA refers to the fatty-acyl coenzyme A with a chain length of 12-carbon
  atoms and a double bond at ∆9 position in E configuration; E8,E10-12:CoA refers
  to the fatty-acyl coenzyme A with a chain length of 12-carbon atoms and two conjugated
  double bonds at ∆8 and ∆10 positions in E configuration
