caption: 'Top. Multiplying (M)-ProSG (present in mice at the embryonic (E) days indicated)
  are mitotically active cells derived from primordial germ cells (PGCs). They become
  transition (T) 1-ProSG when they cease proliferation. When they re-initiate proliferation
  (at birth or very early postnatally [P]), they are known as T2-ProSG. In mice, re-initiation
  of proliferation occurs approximately co-incident with the migration of ProSG from
  the center of the seminiferous tubule to its periphery: the “SSC niche.”. A cell
  cluster recently defined by scRNA-seq that is developmentally intermediate between
  most T1- and T2-ProSG – intermediate (I)-ProSG – appears to commonly undergo this
  cell migration event []. T2-ProSG have two fates: (1) conversion into differentiating
  (Diff)-SG, which immediately proceed through the first round of spermatogenesis
  to allow rapid fertility, and (2) conversion into SSCs for long-term spermatogenesis.
  Bottom. The expression pattern of selected marker genes defined by recent scRNAseq
  studies (most of those shown have been validated by immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence
  analyses). Also shown are signaling pathways inferred to be active in a ProSG stage-specific
  manner, based on the expression pattern of signaling pathway genes.'
