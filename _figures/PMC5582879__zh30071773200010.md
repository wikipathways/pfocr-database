caption: Proposed mechanisms underlying luminal FFA2 activation under normal conditions
  and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition in the duodenum. Under normal conditions (left),
  low doses of the luminal FFA2 agonist PA1 stimulate enterochromaffin (EC) cells
  and then increase 5-HT release. The physiological concentrations of released 5-HT
  activate 5-HT4 receptors on epithelial cells and/or cholinergic neurons and then
  stimulate  secretion (). 5-HT also increases blood flow (BF) via 5-HT3 receptor
  activation. When gastric acid enters the duodenal lumen, luminal acid increases
  PGE2 production in parallel with 5-HT release and then further stimulates  secretion.
  Acid also activates acid sensors on afferent nerves and then increases blood flow
  (). In contrast, high doses of PA1 release excessive amounts of 5-HT that reduce
  blood flow via 5-HT3 receptor (over)activation (right). Additional COX inhibition
  by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) further decreases blood flow. COX
  inhibition also impairs  secretory response and mucus secretion against acid exposure
  (). Consequent luminal acid exposure fails to enhance mucosal defense mechanisms,
  followed by injuring the duodenal mucosa. Furthermore, excessive 5-HT activates
  5-HT3 receptors on afferent nerves and then may trigger the abnormal symptoms such
  as emesis and epigastric pain.
