caption: (a) Biosynthetic reactions using epoxide as a biosynthon. Examples shown
  are for lasalocid and lanosterol formation catalyzed by epoxide hydrolase and oxidosqualene
  cyclase, respectively. (b) The cationic rearrangement of epoxide under strongly
  acidic conditions in organic synthesis. The semi-pinacol, Meinward and Jung rearrangements
  all involve the formation of a carbocation intermediate followed by C-C bond migration
  to yield aldehydes or ketones. A comparable reaction has not been reported in Nature.
  (c) Knowledge of the quinolone alkaloid biosynthetic pathways at the onset of this
  study. Penigequinolone A (1a) and B (1b) are from the pen pathway in Penicillium
  sp., while aspoquinolone A (2a) and B (2b) are from the asq pathway in Aspergillus
  nidulans. The alcohol 4 is oxidized into the epoxide 5 by the FMO in the pathways,
  which can spontaneously form the 5-exo-tet product 6. Previously, 1 was proposed
  to derive from 6, while 2 was proposed to derive from the 6-endo-tet product 7.
  The common uncharacterized genes in the two pathways are shown, and the two CrtC
  enzymes were investigated in this work to possibly catalyze the formation of 1 and
  2 from either 6, 7, or 5.
