caption: Model describing the putative mechanism of synergetic interaction between
  PFK158 and erlotinib in WT and mutEGFR NSCLC cell lines. In mutEGFR cells, chronic
  inhibition of EGFR signaling by erlotinib promotes reactivation of the MAPK pathway
  thereby stimulating PFKFB3 transcription via CREB1 binding to the PFKFB3 promoter.
  Enhanced PFKFB3 transcription compensates for the loss of protein because of targeted
  degradation by the proteasome and promotes cell survival. In WT-EGFR cells, prolonged
  erlotinib exposure stimulates EGFR signaling which, in turn, up-regulates PFKFB3
  expression by an unknown mechanism and promotes cell survival. PFKFB3 inhibition
  with PFK158 blocks the prosurvival function of PFKFB3 resulting in a marked increase
  in cytotoxicity when used in combination with erlotinib. Solid arrows indicate established
  direct regulations of downstream targets. Dashed arrows indicate indirect activation
  where intermediate steps are involved but are not specified in this schematic.
