caption: 'Cytosolic viral DNA sensing. DNA is a PAMP that can be delivered to the
  cytoplasm of host cells during microbial infection. Several DNA sensors have been
  reported to promote the activation of innate immune signaling by activating a STING-dependent
  signaling pathway. Among them, cGAS can catalyze ATP and GTP to generate the second
  messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and then activate STING. However, the molecular
  basis by which other DNA sensors activate STING is not well understood. RNA polymerase
  III can activate the immune response in a STING-independent way, RNA polymerase
  III can transcribe poly (dA-dT) into dsRNA, which is then recognized by RIG-I. Several
  members of DExD/H helicases are also respond to cytosolic dsDNA, such as DHX9, DHX36
  and DDX41. In IRF3-mediated innate immune responses of fibroblasts, DNA-PK recognizes
  cytoplasmic dsDNA of vaccinia virus. TREX1 is well known to protect host from excessive
  inflammation via efficiently degrading cytosolic endogenous DNA. PYHIN family proteins:
  AIM2 and IFI16. AIM2 senses dsDNA from virus and oligomerizes to form AIM2 inflammasome.
  IFI16 binds to cytoplasmic viral DNA and mediates the activation of STING-TBK1-IRF3
  axis. Moreover, NLRC3 recognizes dsDNA and releases STING, which activates type
  I interferon induction'
