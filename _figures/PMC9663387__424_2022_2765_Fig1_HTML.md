caption: hOPN5-mediated activation of Gq signalling pathways as suggested by Wagdi
  and colleagues []. Human OPN5, a seven-transmembrane opto-GPCR, is activated by
  near-ultraviolet light (406 nm) and deactivated by green light (511 nm). Upon activation,
  hOPN5 exclusively triggers the Gq downstream signalling pathway. The Gαq subunit
  of the heterotrimeric G protein acts via phospholipase C (PLC) catalysing the conversion
  of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). In turn, DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC) and canonical
  transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels. IP3 triggers the release of Ca2+ from
  intracellular stores, thereby inducing positive chronotropic (increase in rate)
  and inotropic (increase in contractility) responses in muscle cells. Based on a
  G protein coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) assay combined with
  pharmacological inhibition of either Gq or Gi proteins using FR900359 or pertussis
  toxin (PTX), respectively, the authors excluded the activation of Gi signalling
  pathways, which would decrease the intracellular cAMP levels by inhibiting adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) and would increase GIRK currents. In contrary, GIRK currents were reduced
  due to PLC-dependent PIP2 depletion
