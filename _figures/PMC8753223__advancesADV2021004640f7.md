caption: Schematic of how SBDS deficiency in the Mx1CreSBDSExc model impacts BM niche
  cell composition and gene expression in response to myeloablative irradiation, leading
  to impaired niche capacity to engraft donor HSC after HSCT. Our studies support
  a model by which Sbds knockdown in Mx1-inducible osteolineage niche cells impairs
  donor HSC engraftment after TBI. SBDS deficiency in osteoprogenitors causes ribosomal
  dysfunction, p53 pathway activation, and cell cycle arrest, which impairs the ability
  of these OCs to proliferate in response to IGF-1 and other growth factor signals
  after TBI and, consequently, to support donor hematopoiesis. Because of cell intrinsic
  or extrinsic mechanisms, SBDS deficiency in niche cells also increases adipocytes
  and decreases EC survival in the BM microenvironment after TBI, both of which may
  impair donor engraftment after HSCT. Decreased osteoprogenitor-derived CXCL12 and
  endothelial P-selectin expression may limit HSC homing and lodgment within BM niches
  after TBI. Elevation of CCL3 and endothelial E-selectin drives recruitment of inflammatory
  macrophages after TBI. The resulting proinflammatory environment may further disrupt
  engraftment and maintenance of donor HSPC.
