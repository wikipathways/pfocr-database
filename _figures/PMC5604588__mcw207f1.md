  pathways that lead to the production of defence-associated hormones and metabolites
  in wheat following F. pseudograminearum infection in wheat. The phenylalanine, tyrosine
  and tryptophan biosynthesis pathway (retrieved from KEGG) denoting Fusarium responsive
  genes encoding enzymes functioning within the pathway. Filled arrows denote up-regulated
  genes and open arrows denote down-regulated genes. Underlined compound names indicate
  metabolites which were detected in this study using LC-MS.
