caption: 'Model depicting the role for microvillous cells involvement in the olfactory
  epithelium innate immune response to viral infection. 1) Secreted or cell surface
  glycoproteins constitute a first barrier preventing virus entry. 2) When reaching
  MVC_eGFP, viruses can encounter three types of membrane proteins: adhesion molecules
  that trigger intracellular signaling upon viral recognition (black rectangle), transmembrane
  proteins that block virus entry (black circle), viral receptors allowing virus entry
  (grey circle). 3) MVC_eGFP express numerous transcriptional factors involved in
  the inhibition of viral replication. 4) Cytosolic viral RNA sensing induces the
  production of type I interferons. 5) A possible signaling pathway leading to intracellular
  calcium increase, TRPM5 activation and Na+-mediated vesicle release. Acetylcholine
  can activate neighboring sustentacular cells and underlying trigeminal fibers. 6)
  Eicosanoids synthesis, along with IL-25 production, can recruit and activate group
  2 innate lymphoid cells, which are key controllers of type 2 inflammation. 7) GPR126
  activation results in NFkB activation and TNFα production. TNFα can directly activate
  macrophages. TNFα also induces a change in the function of horizontal basal cells,
  switching their phenotype from neuroregeneration to immune defense. 8) Interferons
  and cytokines can in turn activate antiviral immune response in neighboring MVC_eGFP'
