caption: mTORC1 and its signaling networks. mTORC1 is composed of mTOR, Raptor, mLST8,
  PRAS40, Deptor and Tti1/Tel2 complex. The signaling networks of mTORC1. a Growth
  factors, such as insulin, stimulation leads to the activation of classic PI3K-AKT-TSC2-mTORC1
  pathway. b Amino acids, mainly leucine and arginine, stimulate mTORC1 through GTP-loaded
  RAG. c LATS can trigger hippo pathway by inhibition of YAP to activate mTORC1 signaling
  through PTEN suppression. d WNT signaling stimulates mTORC1 by inhibiting the activation
  of GSK3β, which can phosphorylate TSC2. e Notch signaling can regulate mTOR activity
  in liver. f AMPK inhibits mTORC1 activity through phosphorylating TSC2 or Raptor
  under energy limitation. Upon various stimulation, mTORC1 modulates its substrates
  such as 4E-BP, ULK1, TFEB1, LIPIN1, HIF1α, ATF4. S6K and GRB10 to affect cellular
  proliferation, metabolism and many other biological processes. In addition, negative
  feedback mechanisms of mTOR substrates, in turn, fine-tune mTORC1 signaling networks.
  For examples, Grb10 negatively regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway through a
  phosphorylation-dependent feedback mechanism on reptor or IRS. And S6K1 also negatively
  accommodates phosphorylation of IRS-1 to suppress IRS-1/PI3K /Akt /mTOR signaling.
