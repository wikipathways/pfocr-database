caption: Recalling the modus operandi of chlorinations of π-systems by 7·Cl− the chlorination
  of aliphatic C-H bonds is likely to involve the in situ generation of B (Pathway
  a, ). The latter may then insert Cl+ into a C-H bond of methane or a side chain
  C-H bond in 7·Cl− via an electrophilic aliphatic substitution. Such a reaction is
  reminiscent of electrophilic aliphatic methane chlorinations with Cl2/SbF5, Cl2/sulfated
  zirconia, and of electrophilic alkane fluorination by F2. Alternatively, we also
  considered an aliphatic C-H bond activation/functionalization involving PdIV-C bonds
  in intermediate J (Pathway b, ) since PdII-, or PtII-,  or rare PtIV- mediated aliphatic
  C-H bond activations generally involve the intermediacy of organometallic complexes;
  aliphatic C-H bond activations by PdIV are unknown. Some indirect support for the
  general viability of complexes containing PdIV-C bonds was found in the reaction
  of 7 with CH3MgCl, which produced a 1:1 mixture of CH3Cl and CH3CH3 and LPdIICl2
  (6) (entry 13, ). The formation of ethane is indicative of a PdIV-dimethyl intermediate
  LPdIVCl2(CH3)2 that subsequently reductively eliminates CH3CH3; unlike their PdII-analogs,
  dialkyl PdIV-species are susceptible to undergo C-C reductive elimination. However,
  while CH3Cl may have therefore been formed from LPdIVCl3(CH3) in entry 13, this
  does not necessitate the formation of intermediate J in .
