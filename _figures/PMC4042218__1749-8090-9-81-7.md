caption: Schematic representation of the blocking effect of sorafenib on development
  of left ventricle hypertrophy (LVH) induced by aortic banding. Mechanical stretch
  induced by pressure overload results in over-expression of growth factors, PDGF-BB
  and TGFβ1 in myocardium []. The original finding of this study shows sorafenib to
  inhibit the up-regulation of these growth factors following AB. Phosphorylation
  and hence activation of PDGFβR and TGFβ1R is known to activate the downstream signaling
  pathway of c-Raf/ERK1/2 []. Sorafenib is reported to block phosphorylation and activation
  of PDGFβR and c-Raf in cancer studies []. By blocking the c-Raf/ERK1/2 cascade,
  sorafenib down-regulates the expression of pro-proliferative (c-myc, c-fos) and
  pro-hypertrophic (GATA4) transcription factors as well. One of the pro-hypertrophic
  effector mechanisms regulated by GATA4 is ANP [] which is in turn suppressed by
  sorafenib treatment. The sum of the inhibitory effects of sorafenib ends at the
  suppression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as well as of interstitial collagen deposition,
  the two main components of LVH. Blocking effect of sorafenib on expression of growth
  factor as demonstrated in this study. Blocking effect of sorafenib previously reported
  by Wilhelm et al. [].
