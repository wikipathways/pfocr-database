caption: 'IPostC significantly protects hearts against I/R injury, but its molecular
  mechanisms remain poorly understood. The hypothesis: IPostC regulates uncoupled
  nNOS and the nNOS/AMPK/PGC-1α axis to decrease oxidative stress and improves SR
  function by increasing PLB phosphorylation via a nNOS-mediated pathway to decreased
  intracellular Ca2+ overload, which protects hearts against I/R injury. Considering
  that the effects of nNOS are closely associated with myocardial I/R injury, nNOS
  may thus be a promising future therapeutic target for ischemic heart disease'
