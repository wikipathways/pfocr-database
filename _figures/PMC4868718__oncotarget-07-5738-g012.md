caption: In normal mice (Lkb1fl/fl) ovaries, only a limited number of primordial follicles
  are recruited into the growing follicle pool. When we deleted Lkb1 from primordial
  follicle oocytes (Lkb1fl/fl;Gdf9-Cre), excessive primordial follicles were activated
  with elevated mTORC signaling pathway, resulting in defective follicular development.
  After rapamycin treatment, overactivation of primordial follicles in Lkb1fl/fl;Gdf9-Cre
  mice could be rescued to be the normal level. Additionally, when we deleted LKB1
  from oocytes in the primary follicle stage (Lkb1fl/fl;Zp3-Cre) to avoid overactivation,
  no defects were observed in the following follicular develop.
