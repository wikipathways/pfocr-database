caption: 'Hypothesized immune mechanisms of fish spleen against N. seriolae infection.
  The hypothesized portrait of activated immune pathways in the spleen of the snakehead
  was drawn based on the analysis of currently identified immune genes. During immune
  defense, a substantial number of genes with immunomodulatory functions were identified
  in the spleen, including innate immune molecules such as CLEC4E, FTL, FTH1, C5,
  Bf, CFH, C1q, and LECT2. These molecules are primarily involved in pathways associated
  with ferroptosis, the complement and coagulation cascades, the chemokine signaling
  pathway, and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, genes associated
  with T/B cell responses, including CD247, ZAP70, TRBV, CD22, CD79B, and MALT1, demonstrated
  significantly reduced expression levels. Furthermore, a notable presence of apoptotic
  macrophages was observed within splenic granulomas. MUFA: monounsaturated fatty
  acids; PL-OOH: phospholipid peroxides. This graphic was created by BioGDP.com'
