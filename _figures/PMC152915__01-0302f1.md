caption: Carotenoid Biosynthetic Pathway.The commonly held view of the carotenoid
  biosynthetic pathway in plants is a series of four desaturations to form all-trans-lycopene
  from phytoene. Lycopene is subject to two cyclization reactions to form α- or β-carotene,
  which are modified further to form the various xanthophylls. PDS, phytoene desaturase;
  ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase; βLCY, β-cyclase; ɛLCY, ɛ-cyclase; βOH, β-hydroxylase;
  ɛOH, ɛ-hydroxylase; ZE, zeaxanthin epoxidase, NXS, neoxanthin synthase; VDE, violaxanthin
  deepoxidase.
