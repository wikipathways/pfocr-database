caption: The pluripotent state is inherently unstable and minor perturbations disrupting
  the balance within the signalling network may lead to the initiation of differentiation
  to either one of the three germ layers or to extraembryonic derivatives. As a consequence,
  the shown pathways may act both to promote stemness in one setting and differentiation
  in another, all depending on the microenvironmental context, as well as the subcellular
  localisation and signalling dynamics of individual pathway components. Note that
  several of the displayed effectors exist in multiple isoforms and are currently
  omitted for clarity, although there are cases in which two isoforms may have different
  or even opposing effects on PSC biology []. The red question mark is used to denote
  existing uncertainty about the ability of PI3K and WNT signalling to access the
  same GSK3 pool. Dashed lines are used to indicate indirect regulatory relationships.
  Positive regulation is shown in green and negative regulation in black.
