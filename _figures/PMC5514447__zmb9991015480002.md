caption: Low-dose triptolide and aspirin suppress NF-κB survival pathways. (A) Downregulation
  of inflammatory cytokine-induced genes in lung tissues of mice treated with the
  combination of aspirin and triptolide. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was conducted
  on the microarray gene expression data to determine the molecular pathways and predicted
  activated and inactivated upstream transcription regulators. The upstream transcription
  regulators are predicted by the activation z score (a z score of greater than zero
  is defined as activated, and a z score of less than zero is defined as inactivated).
  The top inactivated upstream transcription regulators (red nodes) and the corresponding
  downregulated genes (blue, yellow, green, light blue, and gray circles) for the
  combined aspirin-triptolide (4 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg body weight, respectively; 2-month
  gavage) treatment group versus the control group are shown. Solid lines indicate
  the activation of the transcription factor, and dotted lines indicate the induction
  of gene expression. (B) Representative IHC images of NF-κB in lung tissue sections
  of E160D mice that were untreated or treated with aspirin-triptolide (TPL). Brown,
  NF-κB; blue, nuclei. (C) Representative immunofluorescence staining of NF-κB in
  primary E160D lung adenocarcinoma cells. Cells were untreated or pretreated with
  aspirin or triptolide overnight and stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 30 min.
  NF-κB (red) was detected with an anti-NF-κB antibody. The nuclei (blue) were stained
  with DAPI. (D) Comparison of gene expression profiles in different groups of mice
  suggests that aspirin and triptolide potentiate each other to block proinflammatory
  cytokine-induced NF-κB survival pathways.

  description: Low-dose triptolide and aspirin suppress NF-κB survival pathways. (A)
    Downregulation of inflammatory cytokine-induced genes in lung tissues of mice
