caption: 'Within the TME, rapidly dividing tumors cells may outcompete immune and
  stromal cells for essential nutrients, forcing metabolic adaptations for cell function
  and survival. In the TME, if glucose availability declines, alternative nutrients
  must supply the critical pathways that allow tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs)
  to support tumor progression. TANs utilize fatty acid oxidation to power immunosuppression
  of antitumor T cells []. Tumor-derived granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor (GM-CSF) also promotes expression of fatty acid transport protein 2 (FATP2),
  through which TANs take up fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, for prostaglandin-mediated
  inflammatory signaling []. TANs uniquely express cell surface receptor lectin-type
  oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1), which may stimulate
  NADPH oxidase []. In glucose-depleted conditions, c-KIT+ and low-density TANs exhibit
  increased mitochondrial respiration and are sensitive to either electron transport
  chain or fatty acid oxidation inhibitors, such as rotenone/antimycin A and etomoxir,
  respectively [,]. Furthermore, in some glucose-limited settings, NADPH oxidase activity
  can be supported by NADPH production outside of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  likely through either malic enzyme (ME) or isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) []. Pharmacological
  inhibition of glutamine catabolism by JHU-083 in the TME decreases TAN abundance,
  positioning glutamine as a regulator of TAN survival []. TANs also secrete metabolites
  and metabolic enzymes to suppress antitumor immunity. They directly suppress T cell
  inflammatory signaling by releasing proteases, NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase
  (iNOS) [,]. They also deplete the local environment of arginine, an essential nutrient
  for T cell function, by secreting arginase-1 (ARG1) []. TANs can also suppress cytotoxic
  T cell function through the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which
  can form a physical barrier between tumor cells and antitumor T cells, further disrupting
  antitumor immunity []. Abbreviations: α-KG, α-ketoglutaric acid; PGE2, prostaglandin
  E2, NO, nitric oxide; Rot/AA, rotenone and Antimycin A; TCA, tricarboxylic acid,
  electron transport chain inhibitors.'
