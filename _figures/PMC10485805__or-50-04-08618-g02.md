caption: Signaling pathways and cytokines. The signal transmission of innate immunity
  in the intestine is mainly achieved through the recognition of NOD like receptors
  and TLRs to generate perception. Pathogen related molecular patterns of different
  microorganisms are recognized by TLRs, TLRs activate NF-κB and stimulate the production
  of inflammatory factors and chemokines. When the gut microbiota changes abnormally,
  TLRs will be abnormally activated, producing a series of inflammatory and tumor-promoting
  reactions. At the same time, they can regulate the invasion and metastasis of cancer
  cells via MMPs and integrins. Th17 cells can secrete IL-17 and IL-23, which can
  regulate Th17 cells. Blocking IL-23 secretion can alleviate inflammation. The content
  of HIF-1α in a hypoxic tumor environment increases, which activates NF-κB. NF-κB
  can increase macrophage HIF-1α expression in the tumor microenvironment. HIF-1α
  and TGF-β have synergistic effects. HIF-1α is positively associated with the angiogenic
  factor VEGF. Th cells mature into Th1, Th2, Treg and Th17 cells. Th1 cells secrete
  IFN-γ, while Th2 cells and Tregs secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 for antitumor effects,
  and Th17 cells secrete IL-17. After gut microbiota depletion, the content of IFN-γ
  increases and the IL-17 content decreases. PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular
  pattern molecules; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; TLRs, toll-like receptors; Th,
  helper T cell; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; Treg, regulatory T cell
