caption: PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation pathway. (A) In the absence of bound PCSK9,
  following binding with LDL, LDLR on hepatocyte membrane surface is internalized
  through clathrin coated vesicles, which form endosomes in cytosol. The acidic environment
  of the endosome causes dissociation of LDLR and LDL particle, followed by the recycling
  of LDLR molecules back to the cell surface. However, the LDL particle is taken up
  by the lysosomes, where complex lipids are broken down to individual components
  and released into cytosol for further processing and use. (B) In the presence of
  PCSK9, which associates with LDLR and LDL through different domains, the complex
  of LDLR-PCSK9-LDL does not dissociate in the acidic environment of endosomes and
  is degraded into amino acids and individual lipid components, which are released
  into cytosol. Thus in the presence of PCSK9, there is no recycling of LDLR. Gain
  of function (GOF) mutations (e.g., D374Y) in PCSK9 increase its affinity for LDLR
  and augment its overall effect on the breakdown of LDLR. On the other hand, loss-of-function
  (LOF) mutations in PCSK9 (e.g., Y142X and C679X) and also treatment with therapeutic
  monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 result in decreased circulating levels of PCSK9
  and thus increased availability of LDLR on the cell surface and significantly lowered
  plasma LDL-C. PCSK9, pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9; LDLR, low-density
  lipoprotein-receptor; LDL, low-density lipoprotein.
