caption: Under normal conditions, TCF11/Nrf1 is a short‐lived ER membrane (endoplasmic
  reticulum)‐resident protein, which is rapidly subjected to proteasome‐mediated degradation
  following retro‐translocation to the cytosol by ER‐associated degradation machinery
  (ERAD). In case of proteasome dysfunction (i.e. proteotoxic stress), the half‐life
  of TCF11/Nrf1 is prolonged and become then a substrate for the NGLY1 and DDI2, thereby
  giving rise to a C‐terminal cleaved fragment that enters into the nucleus. After
  nuclear translocation, cleaved TCF11/Nrf1 associates with Maf and promotes the expression
  of proteasomes genes, so that protein homeostasis can be restored. In patients carrying
  the c.1127 + 337A>G homozygous PSMC3 variation, defective proteasomes promote a
  constitutive activation of TCF11/Nrf1, thereby resulting in increased assembly of
  newly synthetized non‐functional proteasomes, which in turn activate TCF11/Nrf1
  again. Over‐activation of TCF11/Nrf1 results in pathway exhaustion thus rendering
  patient cells incapable of responding to further proteotoxic stress.
