caption: Ginsenoside Re exerts protective effects on retinal microvascular endothelial
  cells by ameliorating HG-induced retinal angiogenesis and apoptosis via the HIF-1α/VEGF
  signal pathway. It suggests that Ginsenoside Re may reduce cell oxidation injury
  and mitochondrial apoptosis leaded to by the excessive ROS, regulate the HIF-1α
  expression and inhibit the activity of VEGF via downregulation of oxidative stress
  and intracellular ROS induced by HG in RF/6A cells, which indicates ginsenoside
  Re may have an anti-angiogenesis effect in diabetic retinopathy via the PI3K/AKT
  mediated HIF-1α/VEGF signal pathway. HG, high glucose; RE, ginsenoside Re; DR, diabetic
  retinopathy; “?” means “uncertain.”
