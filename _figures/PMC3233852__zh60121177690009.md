caption: 'Mitochondrial and Fas death receptor apoptotic pathways to apoptosis before
  (A) and after (B) MUN insult at term gestation in rats. A: before MUN insult, mitochondrial
  and Fas death receptor pro-apoptotic proteins are decreased, whereas anti-apoptotic
  proteins are increased. PPARγ upregulation may induce increased mitochondrial anti-apoptotic
  proteins that will prevent mitochondrial permeability to cytochrome c and subsequent
  activation of caspase-9 and -3 and apoptosis. B: conversely, MUN insult activates
  mitochondrial and Fas death receptor pathways and downregulates PPARγ expression,
  which may induce decreased anti-apoptotic protein expression and that will stop
  the inhibition loop allowing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and
  increase of activated caspase-9 and -3 and induction of apoptosis. PPRE, PPARγ response
  elements. Arrows indicate decrease in protein expression (↓), increase in protein
  expression (↑), and unchanged protein expression (↔).'
