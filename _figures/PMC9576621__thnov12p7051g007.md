caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanism through which ERK inactivation expands
  the CSC population. ERK inactivation activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, the
  activated pSTAT3 enhance expression of miR-204, which downregulates SPDEF expression.
  As a transcription repressor of Slug, SPDEF downregulation de-represses expression
  of Slug, triggering EMT and expanding the CSC population. The JAK inhibitor can
  block ERKi-induced Slug expression, thereby preventing expansion of CSCs.
