caption: Overview of formation of exosomes and exosomes in the TME. EBV-encoded molecules,
  such as EBER and LMP-1, are loaded into exosomes and regulate the formation of exosomes.
  The endosomal sorting complex required for transport pathway and associated proteins,
  including CD63, Syntenin-1, Alix, TSG101 and Hrs, interact with LMP-1, inducing
  LMP-1 loading in exosomes. Tumor-derived exosomes target surrounding cells or enter
  the fluid circulation. Stress from the TME, such as hypoxia and acidic microenvironment,
  stimulates the synthesis and secretion of exosomes. TME, tumor microenvironment;
  EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; EBER, EBV-encoded RNA; LMP, latent membrane protein; Alix,
  programmed cell death 6 interacting protein; TSG101, tumor susceptibility 101; Hrs,
  human growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate; UCH-L1, ubiquitin C-terminal
  hydrolase L1; TRAF2, TNF receptor associated factor 2; CHMPs, charged multivesicular
  body proteins; MVE, multivesicular endosome; La, Lupus antigen; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; TCR, T cell receptor.
