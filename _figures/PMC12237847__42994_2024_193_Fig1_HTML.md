caption: Symbiosis signaling and plant immunity that affect nodulation specificity
  in the legume–rhizobial symbiosis. A Nod Factor biosynthesis and signaling. The
  interaction between host-secreted flavonoids and bacterial NodD proteins leads to
  the expression of nod genes, resulting in the synthesis of Nod factors (NFs). These
  NFs are recognized by host Nod factor receptors (NFRs), initiating the nodulation
  signaling pathway. B Role of extracellular polysaccharides. Rhizobia produce extracellular
  polysaccharides (EPSs), lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), and capsular polysaccharides
  (KPSs) to facilitate infection during compatible interactions, or to induce immune
  responses in incompatible interactions. C Surface receptor-mediated nodulation specificity
  in Medicago. NS1 and NS2, both encoding malectin-like domain leucine-rich repeat
  receptor kinases (MLD-LRR-RLKs), restrict infection and nodulation with Sinorhizobium
  species that possess rns1 and rns2 genes, respectively. D Effector protein delivery
  and immune response. Some bacteria employ the Type III secretion system (T3SS) to
  deliver effector proteins (Nops) that facilitate infection and nodulation. However,
  in some cases, these molecules are recognized by plant resistance (R) proteins,
  triggering host immune responses that restrict infection and nodulation. Figure
