caption: (A) Complete sphingolipid metabolic pathway with explicit examples of ceramide
  structures of each ceramide subspecies investigated. Enzymes manipulated or mentioned
  in the text are highlighted with red color. (B) Generic ceramide structure with
  a C18 sphingoid base indicating placement of hydroxyl groups of alpha-hydroxy and
  phytoceramide species. A double bond is indicated at the third carbon of the fatty
  acid, but ceramide species with monounsaturated fatty acids may vary in placement
  of the double bond.
