caption: 'Simplified plant carotenoid biosynthetic pathway to zeaxanthin and lutein.
  The major question of metabolon organization and assembly is highlighted by the
  inset showing varying localization of maize (Zea mays) phytoene synthase (PSY) allelic
  variants and isozymes fused to GFP and introduced into chloroplasts marked by red
  chlorophyll autofluorescence (adapted from ). Formation of lutein actually requires
  the synergistic interactions of CYP97A and CYP97C (). Steps catalyzed by the bacterial
  enzyme, CrtI, are also indicated and correspond to the four steps catalyzed by the
  plant enzymes PDS, Z-ISO, ZDS, and CRTISO. These reactions also require an electron
  transfer chain and plastoquinones to channel electrons/protons produced during desaturation
  steps. Redox states of the Z-ISO heme iron depict posttranslational regulation of
  the pathway. Redox changes cause conformational changes in Z-ISO leading to a switch
  of the heme ligands and activation/deactivation of Z-ISO. When the heme iron is
  oxidized, the pathway is interrupted whereas when the heme iron is reduced, Z-ISO
  is active and the pathway progresses. “Z-ISO oxidized,” refers to the Z-ISO heme
  iron in the oxidized Fe+3 state; “Z-ISO reduced,” refers to the Z-ISO heme iron
  in the reduced Fe+2 state. CrtI, bacterial phytoene desaturase. Plant enzymes: PSY,
  phytoene synthase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; Z-ISO, 15-cis-ζ-carotene isomerase;
  ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase; CRTISO, carotenoid isomerase; LCYE, lycopene ε-cyclase;
  LCYB, lycopene β-cyclase; CYP97A, cytochrome P450 97A (P450 type β-ring hydroxylase);
  CYP97C, cytochrome P450 97C (P450 type ε-ring hydroxylase); HYDB, β-ring hydroxylase
  (nonheme diiron type). For more details related to this figure, see  and Beltran
  et al. (2015).'
