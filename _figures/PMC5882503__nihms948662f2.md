caption: The Effect of Heart Rate Reactivity on the Relationship between Autonomy
  and Relatedness and Adolescents' Internalizing and Externalizing Problems. Standardized
  betas are presented and * indicates significance at p < .05 level. aindicates that
  the critical ratio difference test was above 1.96 indicating significant differences
  across groups in the structural pathway. Those low in heart rate reactivity are
  to the left and youth high in heart rate reactivity are to the right of the diagonal.
  Analyses controlled for gender and W1 youth outcomes. Although represented here
  in the same figure, separate models were estimated for internalizing and externalizing
  problems.
