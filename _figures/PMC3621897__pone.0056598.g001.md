caption: The left-hand scale indicates carbon oxidation state. The chloromethane utilization
  cmu pathway (bold arrows) funnels the chloromethane-derived methyl group into central
  metabolism via methylene-H4F (CH2 = H4F), while the methanol (CH3OH) oxidation pathway
  operates with formaldehyde (HCHO) as a metabolic intermediate (grey arrows). H4F-
  and H4MPT-dependent enzyme-mediated steps are depicted in blue and pink, respectively.
  Carbon assimilation operates via the serine cycle (Ser) coupled with the ethylmalonyl-CoA
  pathway (EMCP) . Spontaneous condensation of HCHO with H4F or H4MPT, and formaldehyde
  oxidation to methylene-H4F are shown with broken line. In the cmu pathway, the methyl
  group enters a specific H4F-oxidation pathway for energy production driven by the
  FolD and PurU enzymes. Protein-encoded genes or genes located on plasmid pCMU01
  are shown in bold. Boxes and circles highlight proteins more abundant in chloromethane-
  and methanol grown-cultures, respectively. CmuA, methyltransferase/corrinoid-binding
  two-domain protein; CmuB, methylcobalamin:H4F methyltransferase; Fae, formaldehyde
  activating enzyme; Fch, methenyl-H4F cyclohydrolase; FDHs, formate dehydrogenases;
  Fhc, formyltransferase-hydrolase complex; FolD, bifunctional methylene-H4F dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase;
  FtfL, formate-H4F ligase; Gck, glycerate kinase; GcvT, H4F-dependent aminomethyltransferase;
  HprA, hydroxypyruvate reductase; MDH, methanol dehydrogenase; MetF, methylene-H4F
  reductase; MtdA, bifunctional NAD(P)-dependant methylene-H4F and methylene-H4MPT
  dehydrogenase; MtdB, NAD(P)-dependent methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase; Mch, methenyl-H4MPT
  cyclohydrolase; MtkA, malate thiokinase large subunit; MxaF, MDH alpha subunit,
  PurU, 10-formyl-H4F hydrolase; Sga, serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase . Plasmid
  pCMU01 encoded proteins with predicted functions include putative uncharacterized
  methyltransferases CmuC and CmuC2, the putative PaaE-like oxidoreductase, and the
  putative PQQ-linked dehydrogenase of unknown specificity XoxF2. GvcT may serve to
  transfer methyl groups from a wide range of substrates to H4F, as proposed for members
  that belong to the COG0354-related enzymes such as YgfZ .
