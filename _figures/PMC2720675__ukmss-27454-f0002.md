caption: De novo and salvage pathways to reduced folate, and (dashed boxed) the thymidylate
  cycle. Polyglutamated forms of folate (known to be the preferred substrates in other
  organisms, and experimentally demonstrated in P. falciparum [, ]) are omitted for
  clarity. The triphosphate group is removed from 7,8-dihydroneopterin before the
  DHNA step, but it is not yet known whether this is by a non-enzymatic loss of pyrophosphate
  and subsequent removal of the final phosphate by a non-specific phosphatase activity,
  or whether the entire step is enzymatically catalysed. Genes encoding a DHNA activity
  are as yet unidentified in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma. The oxidation state of salvaged
  folate is unspecified, although the major form in the human host is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.
  Experimental evidence for folate salvage in P. falciparum and Toxoplasma has been
  established, but is lacking for Cryptosporidium, despite its evident necessity (see
  text). The targets of current antifolate drugs in clinical use against malaria and
  toxoplasmosis are DHPS and DHFR. P,T,C indicate that the pathway or step is utilised
  in Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium respectively. For abbreviations of
  enzymes (boxed), see text.
