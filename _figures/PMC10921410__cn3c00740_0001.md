  Workflow of this study.
  The miRNA sequencing data from plasma and
  serum samples of 112 participants including 28 Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD), 63 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 21 controls
  were used to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers associated
  miRNAs, and all associations were independent by potential confounders
  and cross-validated. The gene targets of these miRNAs were retrieved,
  and expression of both miRNAs and genes was confirmed in the human
  brain using brain tissue. Moreover, these miRNAs were considered relevant
  to AD based on the literature. The potential functions of these miRNAs
  were analyzed using over-representation analysis including the Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Ontology (GO), and
  Reactome. Pathways or biological processes present in the results
  of the KEGG, Reactome, and GO terms were considered the key pathways;
  using miRNAs and gene targets involved in the key biological process,
  we constructed a network. The potential of these miRNAs as biomarkers
  was explored using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis,
  cross-validation, and randomness test. Both internal and external
  validation datasets were used
