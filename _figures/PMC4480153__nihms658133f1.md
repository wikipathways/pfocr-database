caption: Crosstalk of retrograde signaling with other signaling pathways. Availability
  of nutrients activates TORC1, which inhibits retrograde signaling and activates
  Sch9. This activation of Sch9 is inhibited by the retrograde response. The protein
  kinase Sch9 activates ribosome biogenesis, while inhibiting protein kinase A and
  the Msn2-Msn4 transcription factor, which is responsible for activating stress response
  genes. Protein kinase A also inhibits this transcription factor while stimulating
  ribosome production. Protein kinase A feedback inhibits its own activation. One
  or more signals activate Ras2, which functions in a cAMP-dependent and a cAMP-independent
  pathway. The first of these is likely to block the retrograde response, as it is
  known to curtail RLS, which is maintained by progressive activation of the retrograde
  response during the RLS. The second pathway is known to extend the RLS, and Ras2
  is required for the retrograde response that extends RLS. The Hog1 protein kinase
  is responsive to osmotic stress and to hypoxia. It activates the retrograde response
  directly and by inhibiting TORC1. Activation of the retrograde response extends
  lifespan.
