caption: Mechanisms of different self-incompatibility systems.(A) Papaveraceae GSI.
  The interaction between PrpS and PrsS activates Ca2+-dependent signaling events,
  including an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ and ROS, a reduction in ATP depletion
  and acidification of the cytosol, the inhibition of soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase
  P26.1, and the initiation of two key regulators of SI-PCD, MAPK9 and caspase-3-like/DEVDase,
  thereby resulting in programmed cell death of self-pollen.(B)Brassica SSI. Phosphorylated
  SRK/MLPK activates ARC1, which targets three compatibility factors, EXO70A1, GLO1,
  and PLDα1, for degradation. A second signaling pathway is mediated by the FER–Rac/Rop–Rboh
  module, which triggers a rapid increase in NADPH oxidase–produced ROS, leading to
  self-pollen rejection.(C)Arabidopsis SSI. The SRK/SCR interaction triggers a rapid
  increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ and the activation of autophagy, eventually resulting
  in inhibition of compatibility factors for pollen acceptance.(D)Primula HSI. SI
  occurs in short (S)-style morphs with stigmas positioned above the anther or long
  (L)-style morphs with stigmas situated below the anther. In the S-morph, the cytochrome
  P450 CYP734A50 inhibits cell elongation by repressing brassinosteroid.
