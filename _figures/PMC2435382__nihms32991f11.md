caption: 'A hypothetical scheme illustrates the putative intracellular signaling cascades
  serving as the context for the data collected in the current study. SNP provides
  extracellular NO, which then stimlulates NE release from its synaptic stores. NE
  then binds its receptor (GPCR), thereby activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase
  (PKA), which, in turn, phosphorylates CREB to transcribe BDNF. The neurotrophin
  is then packaged and secreted extracellularly to then bind its receptor, TrkB, in
  either an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Major signaling pathways (e.g., PI-3K
  and MAPK) are then activated, helping to promote neuronal survival through activation
  of survival-promoting genes, one of which, may be BDNF, which can then act in a
  positive feedback manner. But because neither l-NAME nor Hb decreased ERK1 phosphorylation,
  relative to that caused by NE alone, NE-induced ERK1 activation does not depend
  on NO signaling. Inside the cell, NOS produces NO, which, in our study, has a wide
  variety of possible fates: NO can diffuse out of the cell to activate NE release
  directly (as above) or through glutamate activation; NO can be sequestered by Hb,
  thereby decreasing its availability; NO can take part in what is thought to be its
  major cell survival signaling strategy by activating guanylate cyclase, producing
  cGMP and activating protein kinase G; NO can participate in the Ca2+-dependent activation
  of PI-3K, which can then phosphorylate Akt and/or cross-talk with the MAPK pathway
  via Ras activation, both leading to the promotion of neuronal survival; And, NO
  can be converted into a toxic intermediate, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), which can then
  bind TrkB to activate survival-promoting cascades. Alternatively, in removing NO,
  and therefore, ONOO-, it is possible that Hb and/or l-NAME take on anti-apoptotic
  roles via the increase in ERK1 phosphorylation. The NOS inhibitor, l-NAME, decreases
  intracellular NO, thereby decreasing PI-3K and subsequent cell survival-promoting
  effects (e.g., BDNF). The guanylate cyclase inhibitor, ODQ, prevented NE-simulated
  increases in BDNF expression in our experiments, suggesting that transcriptional
  activation via cGMP (e.g. through PKG or PI-3K) is an important source of BDNF.
  Our data suggests that ODQ also decreases P-ERK1 and subsequent cell survival-promoting
  effects, such as BDNF, possibly through the PI-3K-Ras-MAPK cross-talk pathway. ODQ
  did not decrease PI-3K, indicating that its activation is not cGMP-dependent and
  can be activated via the NE-GPCR-PKA-CREB-BDNF-TrkB route.'
