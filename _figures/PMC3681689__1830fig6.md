caption: Working model for the roles of the mitochondrial chaperones Ssq1-Jac1 and
  the glutaredoxin Grx5 in Fe/S protein maturation in eukaryotes. The model is based
  on the well-established working cycle of the Hsp70 chaperone system in the ISC assembly
  pathway (; ) and integrates the findings on Grx5 function from this work. 1) Initially,
  an ISC is synthesized de novo on the scaffold protein Isu1 involving early-acting
  ISC assembly components such as Nfs1-Isd11 (). 2) The cochaperone Jac1 recruits
  the ISC-loaded Isu1 and targets it to the ATP-bound form of the Hsp70 chaperone
  Ssq1. 3) Grx5 binds to Ssq1 in either its ATP- and ADP-bound state but has a higher
  affinity for the ADP-bound form of Ssq1. Most likely Grx5 binding to Ssq1 precedes
  that of Isu1, but the presence of Grx5 on Ssq1 is no prerequisite for binding of
  Isu1 to the chaperone. 4) Jac1- and Isu1-induced ATP hydrolysis triggers a conformational
  change of the peptide-binding domain of Ssq1, leading to tight binding of the LPPVK
  peptide of Isu1 and of Grx5. 5) The simultaneous presence of these two proteins
  on Ssq1 facilitates efficient ISC transfer from Isu1 to Grx5. 6) The nucleotide
  exchange factor Mge1 mediates the exchange of ADP to ATP on Ssq1. The associated
  conformational switch leads to less stable binding of Isu1 and Grx5, resulting in
  dissociation of the trimeric Ssq1-Isu1-Grx5 complex. 7) Finally, Grx5 facilitates
  ISC integration into recipient apoproteins, a function performed in cooperation
  with late-acting ISC targeting factors such as Isa1-Isa2, Iba57, Ind1, and Nfu1.
