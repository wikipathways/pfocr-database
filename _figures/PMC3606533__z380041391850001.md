caption: Genes in choline/1-carbon metabolism and related pathways influence hepatic
  lipid balance. One factor that influences accumulation of fat in the liver is excess
  calorie intake, as fatty acids are taken up by the liver and glucose is converted
  to lipids in the liver. At the same time, lipids are secreted from the liver, mainly
  as very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs). The net balance between lipid inputs and
  outputs determines whether hepatic steatosis develops. Secretion of VLDL requires
  synthesis of a lipid envelope containing apoproteins and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho).
  APOC3 is needed for apolipoprotein synthesis. PtdCho is formed from choline, or
  from methyl-groups in S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) that can be derived from choline
  or from 1-carbon pool (via methyl-tetrahydrofolate; MTHFR encodes for the enzyme
  that forms 5-methyl-terahydrofolate). Choline transport into the hepatocyte and
  then into the mitochondria is mediated by the gene product of SLC44A1. CHDH, BHMT,
  and PEMT are important genes for the pathway forming PtdCho. PtdCho can be used
  to make VLDL, or can be hydrolyzed in a pathway involving PNPLA3, or secreted in
  bile by a flippase encoded for by ABCB4. We found that SNP patterns across multiple
  genes, including ABCB4, APOC3, CHDH, PEMT, PNPLA3, MTHFR, and SLC44A1, were associated
  with hepatic steatosis burden.
