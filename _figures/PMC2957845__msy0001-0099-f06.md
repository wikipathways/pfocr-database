caption: Scheme of the Wnt signalling pathway including proteins from the RT-PCR array.
  Porcn, a transmembrane protein is involved in the secretion of Wnt proteins, which
  represent intercellular signalling molecules []. Reaching their target cells, Wnt
  proteins bind to Frizzled transmembrane receptors. The secreted protein SFRP4 shows
  homology to the cystein-rich ligand binding domain of the Frizzled receptors and
  thus functions as an antagonist of Wnt binding []. Kremen also has an antagonistic
  function, since it represents the receptor of the negative regulator Dkk []. LRP6
  represents a co-receptor of Wnt proteins, which is regulated by CSNK1G1 []. Dvl,
  which is inhibited by CXXC4 and CCDC88C, mediates Wnt signalling via inhibition
  of GSK-3. GSK-3 is also inhibited by FRAT1 [] and β-catenin is inhibited by CTNNBIP1
  []. By inhibition of the β-catenin degrading GSK-3/APC/Axin complex β-catenin accumulates
  in the cytoplasm and is transferred to the nucleus, where it associates with LEF,
  TCF or Pitx2 proteins to activate transcription of target genes. BCL9 and EP300
  represent transcriptional co-activators [; ] and TLE1, NLK and CtBP2 represent negative
  regulators [; ; ].
