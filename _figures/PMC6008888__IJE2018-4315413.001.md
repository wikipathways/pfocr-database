caption: Proposed cellular mechanisms involved in insulin-stimulated androgen biosynthesis,
  PCOS-associated defects, and free fatty acid-induced insulin resistance and androgen
  production, together with AT2R and PPARγ actions. Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1
  prevents its binding with PI3K and inhibits insulin signaling. Moreover, serine
  phosphorylation of P450c17 increases its 17,20-lyase activity and thus androgen
  biosynthesis. Interestingly, serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is constitutively increased
  in PCOS women and increased by nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) overload. Insulin-stimulated
  androgen production has been shown to be reduced by specific inhibition of PI3K
  and increased by specific inhibition of MEK. MEK/ERK activity was found to be constitutively
  reduced in PCOS women and inhibited by NEFAs. It was also suggested that P450c17
  activity may be stimulated by other players of the MAPK pathway, such as MKK3/6-p38
  and MKK4/7-JNK, whose activities are not reduced, and may be even increased, in
  women with PCOS. Adapted from [].
