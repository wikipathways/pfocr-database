caption: Intracellular energy relocation in fat body cell of Drosophila and immune
  cell of human. The fat body cell of Drosophila function as both metabolic and immune
  cell. Activation of toll and its adaptors, tube and dMyD88, results in the recruitment
  of Pelle kinase, subsequently inactivation of cactus (an orthologue of IκB), and
  the release of Dif (a transcription factor for antimicrobial genes). Simultaneously,
  insulin signaling is antagonized by the related proteins regulated by toll-induced
  Dif activation (left panel). Upon infection, activation of TLR in immune cell such
  as macrophage or dendritic cell stimulates inflammatory responses via the NFκB or
  IRF3 pathway, and IRF3 can also regulate metabolic response through interfering
  with the transcription activity of LXR, FXR, and RXR. In addition, phosphorylation
  of Akt mediated by the downstream kinases of TLR results in induction of glycolysis
  to generate ATP. Energy is being utilized to sustain the antimicrobial response (right
  panel)
