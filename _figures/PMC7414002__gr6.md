caption: Effect of regX3 Deletion on Primary Metabolism in S. pogona.This regulatory
  network is based on the analysis of differentially expressed proteins and metabolites
  associated with glucose transport, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the
  TCA cycle, and fatty acid degradation. Reactions are reported according to KEGG
  metabolic pathway databases. Triangle represents a change in protein abundance,
  and arrow represents a change in metabolite abundance.
