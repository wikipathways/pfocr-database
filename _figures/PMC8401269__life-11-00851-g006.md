caption: A schematic illustration of the hypothesized roles of ATP release in the
  cancer microenvironment. The slow and diffuse, but substantial and prolonged release
  of ATP via VRACs in cancer cells forms high-ATP interstitium around the cancer.
  ATP is degraded by ecto-ATPase CD39 and CD73, which are abundantly expressed in
  cancer cells, to produce adenosine. Adenosine suppresses the immune attack on the
  cancer through multiple pathways, including the suppression of natural killer cells
  and the activation of regulatory T cells via the A2A adenosine receptor. The activation
  of VRACs to release ATP is induced by hypotonic stress and S1P, an inflammatory
  mediator that exists abundantly in the cancer microenvironment. S1P activates its
  G-protein coupled receptors. Regarding hypo-osmotic stress, cells experience frequent
  fluctuations in volume due to unbalanced transmembrane fluxes of ions and nutrients
  or the synthesis and degradation of macromolecules within the cells. In cancer patients,
  the degradation of protein synthesis, including albumin, causes cachexia and edema.
  Thus, hypotonic stress may ordinarily occur in the cancer microenvironment. TGFβ
  is a major tumor progressor with EMT and also abundant in the cancer microenvironment.
  We found that TGFβ increased the VRAC expression and enhanced the release of ATP
  by both S1P and hypotonic stress []. The adenosine pathway was reported to synergistically
  interact with the immune check point pathway molecules (PD1, PD1L, CTLA4, etc.),
  which are strong target molecules []. CD39, CD73 and A2A are now considered molecular
  targets for cancer therapy []. Based on our results, VRACs or the source of the
  ATP signaling may be potential new therapeutic targets.
