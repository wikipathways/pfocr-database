caption: Systemic effects of altered micronutrients in one-carbon metabolism. (A)
  Reduced folate, methionine, or B12 can cause a decrease in one-carbon metabolism
  output, leading to decreased DNA synthesis, increased genomic instability, and decreased
  methylation potential. This can promote the development of neural tube defects (NTDs),
  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cancer (specifically colorectal cancer).
  Reduced B12 also decreases activity of the propionate catabolic pathway through
  decreased methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) enzymatic activity, leading to decreased
  myelin synthesis, increased cellular stress, and disrupted tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycling. These factors influence the development of neuropathies and promote NAFLD.
  (B) Effects of excess folate, methionine, and B12 are less understood, but increases
  can promote cell proliferation and can increase SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) levels,
  which allow cells to maintain their methylated states. This could lead to the development
  of cancers as maintenance of methylation is important for some malignancies. Excessive
  folate also disrupts normal hematopoiesis, possibly through increased one-carbon
  metabolism.
