caption: TLRs mediated the T cells response and programmed cell death process toward
  tumor environment. After TLRs bind to PAMPs or DAMPs, the activation of pro-inflammatory
  response and different programmed cell death process are elicited. On one hand,
  various antigen-presenting cells (APC) are activated, and a programmed maturation
  is initiated to induce the migration of APC to lymph node. Different TLRs are activated
  by MYD88 and TRIF to elicit the downstream pathway, leading to the phosphorylation
  of NF-κB or IRFs and consequent transcription of various genes coding pro-inflammatory
  cytokine. This cytokine production response to PAMPs/DAMPs and activates different
  subset of T cells. In addition, naive T cells in the lymph node activate. Differentiated
  T cells migrate through the blood to the tissue or tumor environment and are further
  activated by different factor. On the other hand, tumor gene-related programmed
  cell death is elicited by activation of TLRs signaling pathway. Apoptosis, autophagy,
  and necrosis are independent but have certain association with each other, which
  share the same signaling pathways or downstream effected adaptor to induce cancer
  cell death.
