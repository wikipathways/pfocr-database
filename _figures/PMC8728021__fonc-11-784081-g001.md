caption: '(A) Variant enrichment analysis performed on individuals who developed none/tolerable
  radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity suggests that functional impairment (dotted
  arrows) in pathways involved in the control of the radiation-induced expression
  of NF-kB (green dotted arrow = TNFR1-induced NFkB signaling pathway, functional
  variant related: 2/c.2051dupG) and AIM2 inflammasome activation (yellow dotted arrow
  = the AIM2 inflammasome, functional variant related: c.712delA, impact variant related:
  c.C278G), and of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis (blue dotted arrow =
  insulin receptor signaling cascade, functional variants related: 1/c.38_39insC,
  1/c.37_38insC, 1/c.37_38insC, and 1/c.C447), possibly correlated to an impaired
  plasmalogen biosynthesis (red dotted attow = plasmalogen biosynthesis, impact variants
  related: 9/c.G1300A, 9/c.C1240T, and 1/c.A83T), could play a role in preventing
  the development of acute radiation pneumonitis and chronic radiation-induced pulmonary
  fibrosis. (B) Variant enrichment analysis performed on individulas who developed
  severe radiation induced pulmonary toxicity suggests that, by affecting both the
  fibrinolytic activity (white arrow = dissolution of fibrin clot, functional variant
  involved: 4/c.C169T) and RNA editing pathways (light blue arrow = formation of editosomes
  by ADAR proteins, impact variant involved: 2/c.C577G), specific variants in genes
  involved in these pathways could be responsible of the severe toxicity events reported
  by some patients after irradiation.'
