caption: Pathways for HJ Resolution(A) Resolvases RuvC and GEN1 digest HJs to generate
  linear products with single nicks (carets). SLX1-SLX4 nuclease nicks HJs that can
  be used by MUS81-EME to generate linear products containing a flap or gap. Colored
  dots represent 5′-ends and dotted arrows represent nuclease cuts.(B) The BTR pathway
  for dHJ dissolution generates NCOs exclusively. Arrowheads represent BLM helicase.(C)
  In the absence of BTR, two pathways can act on dHJs or sHJs in mammalian cells.
  Epistasis analysis places SLX1-SLX4 and MUS81-EME1 in one pathway, while GEN1 defines
  the second. The action of these nucleases can lead to CO or NCO outcomes depending
  on the direction of cleavage which is assumed to be random.(D) Coordinated repair
  of ICLs by SLX4-bound nucleases. DNA replication produces a MUS81-dependent DSB
  which is postulated to occur on the leading strand template. This is followed by
  unhooking of the ICL by various candidate proteins including XPF, SLX1, mismatch
  repair and Fanconi Anemia proteins (not shown) and filling-in by translesion DNA
  synthesis (TLS). Finally, replication restart via break-induced replication creates
  a nHJ that can be cleaved by MUS81 using the vertical cleavage site to produce an
  SCE. Alternatively, branch migration of the nHJ produces an intact HJ that could
  be cleaved by MUS81 and SLX1 to produce an SCE or a NCO (not shown).
