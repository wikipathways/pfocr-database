caption: Mechanisms underlying the effects of Stachys sieboldii (SS). SS downregulated
  cellular apoptosis signaling cascade such as Bax, COX-2, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3,
  which results in the upregulation of memory enhancement-related gene such as NGF,
  BDNF, TrkB, and CREB, and its downstream targets Bcl-2 and Egr-1 which are involved
  in neuroplasticity and neuronal survival in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.
  SS also reduced the AChE and increased the CAT and ACh in brain. Thus, SS prevents
  memory impairments through the NGF-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway and inhibitory property
  of AChE.
