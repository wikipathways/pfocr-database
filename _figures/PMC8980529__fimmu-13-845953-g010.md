caption: Schematic overview of the interaction between FH/FHRs and the ECM. FHR1 and
  FHR5 can bind to ECM components and competitively inhibit the binding of FH, thus
  reducing the complement regulatory activity of FH. The ECM-bound FHR1 and FHR5 may
  also directly enhance alternative pathway activation by binding C3(H2O) and C3b
  and allowing formation of C3 convertase.
