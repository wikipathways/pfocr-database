caption: The RAS-MAPK Signaling Pathway. In the RAS ON state (left), EGF binds to
  EGFR with 2:2 stoichiometry at the plasma membrane. EGF binding results in dimerization
  of the receptors, and their autophosphorylation. GRB2 binds to the phosphorylated
  tyrosine on EGFR via its SH2 domain, and subsequently recruits the rasGEF, SOS.
  SOS catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on RAS, activating it. Activated RAS then
  activates RAF, which phosphorylates MEK, which, in turn, phosphorylates ERK. Phosphorylated
  ERK travels to the nucleus, though some remains in the cytoplasm, resulting in the
  phosphorylation of cytoplasmic and nuclear targets. ERK phosphorylates the transcription
  factor ELK, which allows it to form a ternary complex with serum response factor
  (SRF) at serum response elements (SREs). The complex then drives the expression
  of growth factor response genes, such as FOS, a component of the AP-1 transcription
  factor. In the RAS OFF state (center), no EGF or EGF-like ligand is present and
  EGFR remains unbound, its dimerization inhibited by its conformation. GTP bound
  to RAS is hydrolyzed to GDP by rasGAP, inactivating it. RAS which is bound to GDP,
  remains so. GRB2 and SOS remain unbound to EGFR, and RAF is inactive. MEK and ERK
  remain unphosphorylated, with some ERK remaining in the nucleus. ELK is unphosphorylated
  and is unable to form a ternary complex with SRF at the SRE. In Colon Cancer (right),
  K-RAS is mutated, at codon 12, which renders it refractory to GTP–GDP exchange by
  rasGAP, and rasGAP is, therefore, in grey. The actions of the upstream components
  EGFR, GRB2, and SOS are also in grey as their purpose, promoting the GTP bound state
  of RAS, has been achieved. RAF–MEK–ERK is active, inducing the activity of ELK and
  others.
