caption: (A) In HCC193 cells, apoptosis is primarily activated through the extrinsic
  pathway. Cell surface death receptors are activated by ligands such as TNFα and
  TRAIL, leading to the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling cascade through
  initiator caspase-8. IAPs exert their anti-apoptotic activity by inhibiting both
  this cascade as well as TNFα-mediated NF-κB signaling. BV6 blocks these effects
  by antagonizing IAPs, inducing their degradation, and enhancing TNFα secretion.
  (B) In H460 cells, apoptosis is primarily mediated through the intrinsic pathway.
  Here, cell stress triggers mitochondria to release the Apaf-1/cytochrome c complex,
  leading to the activation of the intrinsic pathway through caspase-9. BV6 prevents
  IAPs from inhibiting this cascade, and also induces their proteosomal degradation.
