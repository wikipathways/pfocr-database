caption: 'The role of insulin signaling and insulin resistance in MetS and skin diseases.
  Insulin binds to insulin receptor (IR) and phosphorylates insulin receptor substrates
  (IRS-1, IRS-2) and Shc, which activates the two main insulin signaling pathways:
  the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and the mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPK)/Ras pathway. Under insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia
  condition, insulin not only binds to IR, but also binds to IGF-receptors and stimulates
  the proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Moreover, insulin resistance
  and compensatory hyperinsulinemia could decrease the expression of insulin-like
  growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), thus increasing biological active IGF-1
  and resulting in the development of hyperkeratosis and papillomatosis, which are
  demonstrated as the possible pathogenesis of acanthosis nigricans. As for acne vulgaris
  and hidradenitis suppurativa, western diet and puberty increase PI3K/Akt signaling
  and activate mTORC1. mTOR causes the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS by
  activating S6K and reduces its ability to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues,
  which results in invalid insulin signaling and insulin resistance. mTORC1 also promotes
  lipid synthesis via activating the transcription factor sterol regulatory element
  binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and inducing the expression of acetyl CoA carboxylase
  (ACC), which is the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis. In psoriasis,
  overactivation of PI3K and Akt phosphorylates FOXO and leads to its nuclear export,
  thus promoting cell proliferation by suppressing its function of activating cell
  cycle inhibitors (p27KIP1 and p21) and repressing cell cycle activators (cyclin
  D1/D2), which contributes to proliferation of keratinocytes. Moreover, in psoriatic
  condition, growth factors and relevant cytokines (IL-17A, TNF-α, and IL-1β) in psoriasis
  activate mTOR and then promote keratinocyte hyperproliferation and inhibiting differentiation.
  In the MAPK/Ras pathway, ERK1/2 could activate upstream MEK, reduce Akt phosphorylation,
  and contribute to insulin resistance. Furthermore, p-ERK1/2 have been identified
  to be increased in psoriatic skin, which results in the abnormal and proliferation
  and differentiation of keratinocytes.'
