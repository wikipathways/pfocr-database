caption: 'Schematic representation of PI3K/Akt/Foxo signaling pathway as it relates
  to activation via IGF-1, insulin, and/or EGCG. IGF-1 and insulin activate the pathway
  through interaction directly with their respective cellular membrane receptor in
  addition to possible cross-reactivity (dashed line) of the respective ligand with
  the other’s receptor. From data presented in this study ECGC appears to act partially
  via the PI3K/Akt/Foxo axis (*, # and ^ in Fig ) as well as partially via an additional
  possible parallel pathway (? in Fig).'
