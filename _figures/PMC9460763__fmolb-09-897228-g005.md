caption: A proposed hypothesis of apoptosis and autophagy interactions in preterm
  birth. The imbalanced BAX/BCL2 expression in the preterm villous placenta increases
  the release of Caspase 3 and augments intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The upstream
  downregulation of IL10 may potentiate downregulation of BCL2 expression leading
  to BAX/BCL2 imbalance. Caspase 8 is also activated as an indicator of potential
  extrinsic apoptotic pathway activation. On the other hand, the downregulation of
  autophagy gene ATG7 results in accumulation of p62 cargo protein within the villous
  tissue which inhibits the net autophagy flux. The high level of p62 favours accumulation
  of effector caspases, including Caspase 8 and executes apoptosis. The aggregation
  of caspases including Caspase 3 degrades essential autophagy-associated proteins,
  such as Beclin 1, ATG3 and ATG7, which consequently inhibits autophagy. Calpain
  1 cleaves ATG5 and Beclin 1 and facilitates accumulation of p62 resulting in net
  inhibition of autophagy flux. Thus, a vicious cycle may potentially be established
  between apoptosis and autophagy via the reciprocal stimulatory actions of caspases
  and p62 within the preterm villous placenta that may have a pathognomonic effect
  on PTB. The figure is created with BioRender.com.
