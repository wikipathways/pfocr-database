caption: Molecular Mechanisms of Neurodegeneration in PD. There are multiple potential
  pathways of cell death in PD. It is unclear at the present time whether these pathways
  converge to one overarching central cell death mechanism in PD or whether they are
  independently and distinctly involved in different forms of genetic and sporadic
  PD. On the left are potential mechanisms and therapeutic targets for sporadic PD.
  Central to sporadic PD is mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is modeled by
  MPTP and other complex I inhibitors. MPTP is converted by monoamine oxidase B (MAOB)
  to MPP+ where it is concentrated in dopamine neurons due to its high affinity for
  the DA transporter (DAT) followed by transport and concentration into the mitochondria
  due to its positive charge. Once in the mitochondria, MPP+ poisons the mitochondria
  by inhibiting complex I. Selegiline and rasagiline were initially used as neuroprotective
  agents due their inhibition of MAOB, but it is now thought that they may actually
  inhibit GAPDH-dependent-cell death pathways downstream of complex I inhibition.
  Calcium channel antagonists of the dihydropyridine class may rejuvenate DA neurons
  to the point where they use sodium channels for their characteristic pacing, thus
  rendering them resistance to toxic effects of complex I inhibition. Co-enzyme Q10
  and creatine have neuroprotective properties in animal models of PD through augmenting
  the function of mitochondria. Complex I inhibition leads to cell death through classic
  apoptotic pathways, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as well as neuronal nitric
  oxide synthase (nNOS) activation, DNA damage and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
  activation. Accompanying derangements in mitochondrial complex I is the subsequent
  activation of microglia. Strategies aimed at reducing the inflammatory process in
  PD holds particular promise. On the right are potential therapeutic opportunities
  for familial PD. DJ-1 appears to function in controlling the level of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). Reducing oxidative stress and/or restoring DJ-1 function may be protective.
  PINK1 is a mitochondrial kinase and disruption of PINK1 may lead to alterations
  in the function of TRAP1 and HtrA2 setting in motion cell death pathways. Thus,
  strategies aimed at inhibiting TRAP1 and/or HtrA2 as well as enhancing PINK1 may
  be beneficial. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase and strategies aimed at maintaining
  its catalytic activity are particularly attractive, as well as, lowering the burden
  of toxic substrates such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) interacting multifunctional
  protein type 2 (AIMP2) and the Far Upstream Element-binding Protein-1 (FBP-1), which
  are degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in a parkin-dependent manner.
  S-nitrosylation (SNO) of parkin inhibits its activity and interfering with this
  process may also be protective. PINK1 and parkin appear to function in a common
  genetic pathway with PINK1 acting upstream of parkin, thus maintaining parkin function
  will in theory inhibit PINK1 dependent cell death pathways. LRRK2 kinase and/or
  GTPase inhibitors may be beneficial against cell death due to LRRK2 mutations. Reducing
  ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), modulating α-synuclein (α-syn) phosphorylation
  (PO4), reducing α-synuclein levels through RNAi or immunotherapy, reducing α-synuclein
  oligomerization, inhibiting α-synuclein cleavage or enhancing the degradation of
  α-synuclein through inhibition of SIRT2 are potential targets to reduce neurodegeneration
  by derangements in α-synuclein.
