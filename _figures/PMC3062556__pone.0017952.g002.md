caption: Relative quantitative comparisons of glycolysis and TCA cycle-related metabolites
  using CE-MS. In addition, IMS results of key metabolites for each pathway, including
  fructose 1,6-bi-phosphates in glycolysis and citrate in the TCA cycle, are also
  presented. Each result is mapped on the metabolic pathway (n = 4; *p<0.05, **p<0.01;
  Welch's t-test). Colored graphs indicate significant increases (orange) and decreases
  (blue). Open graphs indicate “not detected.” The full name of each abbreviated metabolite
  is shown in .
