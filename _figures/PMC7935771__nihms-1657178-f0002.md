caption: Simplified representation of the MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling, NF1 pathway and selumetinib
  impact.Activation of the pathway starts with extracellular growth and mitogenic
  factors binding to cell-membrane receptors tyrosine kinase (RTK), leading to their
  dimerization and autophosphorylation. Activated RTK recruit adaptor proteins (e.g.,
  Grb2 and SOS) which activate Ras-GDP by inducing the GDP to GTP molecule change.
  Ras-GTP activates Raf which catalyzes the sequential activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2
  through phosphorylation. Activated ERK1/2 proteins translocate into the nucleus
  to modulate cell proliferation, differentiation and survival, through the activation
  of transcription factors and the regulation of gene expression. ERK1/2 proteins
  also target cytosolic substrates to modulate cell migration and metabolism. The
  MAPK-ERK pathway is dependent on scaffold proteins and is tightly regulated by negative
  regulators (e.g., neurofibromin-mediated negative regulation of RAS), and feedback
  systems (e.g., ERK1/2-mediated feedback inhibition of Raf). Mutated NF1 leads to
  loss of neurofibromin function resulting in overactivation of MAPK-ERK pathway.
