caption: HSV proteins modulate key steps in interferon-related pathways. HSV proteins
  inhibit interferon-related pathways. Engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by
  viral determinants leads to the activation of transcription factors that induce
  the expression of type-I IFNs. (A) The HSV ICP0 protein can block IRF7 activation
  by hampering its phosphorylation and consequently inhibit its translocation to the
  nucleus. (B) Additionally, UL36 inhibits the ubiquitination of TRAF3 which is required
  for positive downstream signaling and activation of the transcription factors NF-κB
  and IRF3. (C) HSV proteins US3 and ICP0 can interfere with IRF3 activation at this
  stage, thus blocking this signaling pathway that otherwise would lead to type-I
  IFN expression. (D) Furthermore, VP16 inhibits the formation of the IRF3-CREBBP/p300
  complex hampering signaling events that would lead to IFN-I expression. (E) Upon
  IFN-I engagement, IFNR on the cell surface elicits intracellular signaling cascades
  mediated by STAT1, STAT2, and JAK1. However, the viral protein ICP27 interferes
  with STAT1 activation and the viral protein VHS hampers STAT2- and JAK1-related
  signaling pathways that otherwise would induce the expression of ISGs, which elicit
  antiviral effects. Black lines show cellular processes. Red lines show processes
  modulated by HSVs.
