caption: 'Ferroptosis metabolic pathway. (A) Antioxidant metabolism. GPX4 and CoQ10
  are two parallel pathways of antioxidant metabolism. GPX4 exerts an antioxidant
  function through the metabolism of GSH. CoQ10 is reduced to CQ10H2 under the action
  of FSP1, inhibiting lipid peroxidation by capturing lipid peroxidation free radicals.
  (B) Iron metabolism. Iron binds to TF and is released into the cytoplasm by TFRC.
  Ferritin releases a large amount of iron‐by‐iron autophagy mediated by NACO4. Heme
  releases iron under the catalysis of HO‐1. FPN can transport iron from cells to
  the blood. (C) Lipid metabolism signaling pathway. AA/AdA is converted into polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PE‐AA) by ACSL4 and LPCAT3. The balance between lipid synthesis, storage,
  and degradation can also manipulate the ferroptosis process. Acetyl‐CoA can also
  produce PUFA under the action of ACC synthase, immediately produce a large amount
  of ROS under the action of Fe2+ and LOX15. Abbreviations: GPX4, glutathione peroxidase
