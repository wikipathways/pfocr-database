caption: Interaction between QA and Nrf2 in depression. In chronic stress conditions,
  increased proinflammatory cytokines lead to microgliosis. Increased proinflammatory
  cytokines activate IDO (enzyme catalyzing first rate-limiting step of KP) and shift
  tryptophan metabolism from serotonin synthesis to KP in microglia. Elevated levels
  of QA further increases oxidative stress through NMDA agonistic activity and secondly
  might be through directly inhibiting nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and hence causes
  increased proteasome degradation of Nrf2 which ultimately led to decreased antioxidant
  levels and increased oxidative stress. QA also causes degeneration of astrocytes
  thus hampering protection and nutritional support to neurons. All this together
  lead to degeneration of 5HT neurons and decreased 5HT synthesis which results in
  depression. On the other hand mild oxidative stress stabilizes Nrf2 and increases
  Nrf2 transcribed antioxidant enzymes. IDO, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase; KP, kynurenine
  pathway; QA, quinolinic acid; KA, kynurenic acid; Nrf2, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived
  2)-like 2; 5HT, serotonin.
