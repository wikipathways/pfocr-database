caption: 'Overview of hemostasis. There are two pathways to initiate coagulation:
  the primary extrinsic pathway (shown on the right) and the intrinsic (also called
  the contact pathway) (shown on the left). The components of these multistep processes
  are illustrated as follows: enzymes (pink circles), inhibitors (blue circles), zymogens
  (green boxes), or complexes (cream ovals). The intrinsic pathway has no known bleeding
  etiology associated with it; thus, this pathway is considered accessory to hemostasis.
  Upon an injury to the vessel wall, TF, a membrane-bound cofactor, is exposed to
  circulating factor VIIa, forming the extrinsic factor Xase, a complex enzyme. Factor
  IX and factor X are converted to the serine proteases factor IXa and factor Xa,
  which are the enzymatic components of the intrinsic factor Xase and the prothrombinase
  complexes, respectively. The combined action of all three complexes lead to an explosive
  burst of thrombin (FIIa). Once thrombin is generated, it cleaves fibrinogen (releasing
  fibrinopeptides A and B (FPA and FPB, resp.)) and activates factor XIII to form
  a cross-linked fibrin clot. Thrombin-thrombomodulin also activates thrombin-activatable
  fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) that slows down fibrin degradation by plasmin. Thrombin
  has also been shown to activate factor XI. In addition to its multiple procoagulant
  roles, thrombin also acts as an anticoagulant when combined with the cofactor thrombomodulin
  in the protein Case complex. The product of the protein Case reaction, activated
  protein C (APC), inactivates the cofactors factors Va and VIIIa. The cleaved species,
  factors Vai (FVai) and VIIIai (FVIIIai), no longer support the respective procoagulant
  activities of the prothrombinase and the intrinsic factor Xase complexes. TF-triggered
  procoagulant response is also down-regulated by the stoichiometric inhibitors tissue
  factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin (AT). TFPI serves to attenuate
  the activity of the extrinsic factor Xase, the trigger of coagulation. AT directly
  inhibits thrombin, factor IXa, and factor Xa. High molecular weight (HMW) kininogen
  is one of components of the intrinsic pathway. (An original version of this figure
