caption: Consensus model of known proteinaceous mechanisms for metazoan heme transport
  and trafficking within and between cells. Intracellular heme is either produced
  via de novo synthesis in the mitochondria or imported via transporters or endocytosis
  (green components). The efflux of heme to exoplasmic spaces is mediated by transporters
  or exocytosis (blue components). The labile heme pool (LHP) consists of heme that
  is buffered by a network of proteins and facilitates its trafficking to other organelles
  throughout the cell. In mammals, FLVCR2 has been implicated as a plasma membrane
  heme importer, whereas LRP1 and CD163 are cell surface scavenger receptors for hemopexin
  (HPX) and the haptoglobin-hemoglobin (HP) complex (or hemoglobin alone), respectively.
  Heme is also transported via endocytosis of senescent red blood cells (RBCs) and
  shed microvesicles (MVs) or exosomes in vertebrates. In worms, HRG-4 homologs are
  dedicated plasma membrane importers and HRG-2 aids in heme utilization by functioning
  as an oxidoreductase. Finally, heme is imported into the cytosol from exoplasmic
  compartments via HRG1 and FLVCR1b at the endolysosome and mitochondria, respectively.
  Conversely, heme efflux is primarily achieved via plasma membrane exporters FLVCR1a,
  ABCG2 and MRP5 in mammals, with MRP5 also having been localized to the secretory
  pathway for heme efflux from the cytosol across metazoans. In worms, heme additionally
  is secreted from intestinal cells for intercellular heme transport via the heme
  binding protein HRG-3, while interorgan heme homeostasis is modulated via secretion
  of HRG-7. Created with BioRender - see text for additional details and .
