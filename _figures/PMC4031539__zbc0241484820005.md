caption: 'A summary figure of the switch from Pu.1 interaction with coactivators to
  corepressors caused by Runx1 deficiency. Two hours after cells were treated with
  tamoxifen to translocate Pu.1 into the nucleus, corepressors and coactivators co-immunoprecipitated
  (coIPed) with Pu.1 from PUER controls (empty vector pLenti6) and PUER shRunx1 cells
  were quantified by LC-MS/MS total spectra counts. For ease of interpretation, the
  tabular data (supplemental Tables S1–S3) are presented here in figure form as the
  gradient of color toward red (more enrichment in shRunx1 cells) or green (more enrichment
  in control cells). Clear double ring symbols are proteins that were not identified
  in any of the IP experiments, but which are linked to myeloid cancer pathogenesis
  by recurrent genetic abnormalities. The reproducibility of protein identification
  in three independent Pu.1 IP experiments is indicated by shapes of the protein symbols:
  not identified (clear double ring), identified once (circle), identified twice (diamond),
  and identified in all experiments (hexagon) (the figure was generated using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis).'
