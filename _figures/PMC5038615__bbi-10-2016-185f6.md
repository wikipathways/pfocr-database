caption: 'Pathways of abscisic acid synthesis, transport, and signaling.Notes: (A)
  Enzymes and intermediate products of the plastidial, endoplasmatic, and cytosolic
  pathways for abscisic acid production unify to the plastidal production of zeaxanthin
  (blue) as precursor for abscisic acid (red) synthesis in the cytosol. The storage
  pathway is catalyzed by BG1 and BG2 as well as by members of the UGT71B gene family.
  For further details, see text. The arrows are colored according to the species in
  which the enzymes were found (). The expression of the identified genes in tomato
  is shown as explained in . Genes coding for enzyme activities not expressed by any
  orthologue are indicated in gray. (B) Survey and localization of main transporters
  involved in uptake and intracellular distribution of abscisic acid. (C) The components
  involved in abscisic acid signaling are represented as interaction scheme.Abbreviations:
