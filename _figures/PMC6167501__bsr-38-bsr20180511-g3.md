caption: Malignant transformation in melanocytes can require combinations of frequently
  seen genetic defects, which lead to melanoma development. These mutants often elicit
  Akt over-activation, leading to constitutive pathway activation (indicated by thicker
  arrows). Constitutive activation of PI3K-Akt signaling impairs cell cycle regulation,
  favoring tumor initiation and progression. Mutations can be mutually exclusive or
  coexist. For example, mutated NRAS (NRASmut) and BRAF (BRAFV600E), from Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
  pathway, rarely occur in the same melanoma cell, whereas BRAFV600E and PTEN function
  loss (PTENdel) appears in 20% of melanomas. NRASmut, a well-described mutation in
  melanoma cells, may also lead to hyperactivation of the PI3K-Akt pathway. PI3K mutation
  itself (p110mut) is a rare condition. mTORC1mut increases protein translation and
  cell proliferation, favoring melanoma development. Also, mTORC2mut enhances Akt
  activation, collaborating with the maintenance of constitutive activation of PI3K-Akt
  pathway in cancer.
