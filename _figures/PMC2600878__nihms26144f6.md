caption: E-selectin binding to PSGL-1 leads, through Syk (arrows), to partial LFA-1
  (open curved arrow) activation that supports rolling on ICAM-1 (shown as dimer).
  CXCR2 engagement by CXCL1 leads, through Gai, to full LFA-1 activation, resulting
  in arrest on ICAM-1 (filled curved arrow). Straight arrows indicate signaling pathway,
  but interactions may be indirect. LFA-1 conformations from Takagi et al ().
