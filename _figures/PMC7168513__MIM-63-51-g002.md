caption: 'Viral strategies for evading the cGAS/STING pathway. Schema summarizing
  virus‐mediated immune strategies for evasion of the cGAS/STING pathway. To escape
  from the cytosolic DNA‐sensing immune response via the cGAS/STING pathway, several
  viruses may manipulate this signal activation through various evasion strategies,
  including: (i) inhibition of the function of cGAS or STING via physical interaction;
  (ii) manipulation of the PTMs system involved in the cGAS/STING function; (iii)
  induction of proteolysis and degradation of cGAS or STING; (iv) sequestration of
  the DNA‐sensing process mediated by cGAS; and (v) inhibition of STING‐dependent
  signal activation at the level of transcription factors such as IRF3 and NF‐κB.
  HcoV, human coronavirus; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; PEDV, porcine
  epidemic diarrhea virus; HTLV‐1, human T lymphotropic virus type‐1; 63, K63‐linked
  ubiquitin.'
