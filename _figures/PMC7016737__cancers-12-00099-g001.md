caption: Immunologic and genomic hallmarks of sarcomatoid dedifferentiation in renal
  cell carcinoma (RCC). (a) Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinomas (sRCCs) are associated
  with higher programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor cells and
  higher lymphocyte infiltration. (b) Recurrent alterations of cell cycle inhibitors
  CDKN2A/B promote cell proliferation and epithelial/mesenchymal transition. (c) Loss
  of chromatin-remodeling genes BAP1 and ARID1A induce genome-wide expression deregulation.
  (d) Loss of Merlin, encoded by the NF2 gene, promotes Hippo pathway activation,
  leading to growth and aggressiveness. (e) Loss of tumor suppressor gene TP53 favors
  survival and proliferation.
