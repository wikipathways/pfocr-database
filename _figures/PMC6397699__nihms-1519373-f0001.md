caption: Schema showing the effect of “activator” versus “amplifier” mutants in the
  MAPK pathway. Activator alterations lead to constitutive MAPK signaling through
  ERK activation that is independent of upstream pathway activity. Activator mutants
  strongly activate ERK and lead to negative feedback suppression of upstream signaling.
  Amplifier mutants augment the downstream signal to ERK and commonly co-occur with
  other activating mutations upstream in the pathway. They lead to modest activation
  of ERK and consequently cause minimal negative feedback inhibition of upstream signaling.
