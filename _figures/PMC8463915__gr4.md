caption: TMEM16A-mediated activation of diverse inflammatory signaling pathways in
  distinct cells in many inflammatory diseases. TMEM16A directly interacts with IP3R
  and increases [Ca2+]i via IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release, thus promoting excessive mucus
  secretion from goblet cells in airway inflammatory diseases such as asthma, COPD,
  and CF. TMEM16A-mediated Ca2+ elevation activates NF-κB signaling in pancreatic
  acinar cells (PACs) and promotes the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. TMEM16A
  activates the NF-κB signaling pathway in endothelial cells by increasing ROS generation
  in ischemic stroke. TMEM16A-mediated Cl− efflux facilitates high fat diet (HFD)/TLR4-induced
  NF-κB activation in hepatocytes by reducing intracellular Cl− concentration, and
  thus contributes to the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis. TMEM16A activates the ERK1/2
  signaling to promote mucus synthesis and release in goblet cells and thus is important
  for mucus hypersecretion in inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma. TMEM16A
  aggravated LPS-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction in intestinal epithelial cells
  by activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
