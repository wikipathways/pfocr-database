caption: Schematics of acylation/deacylation regulation of H-RAS localization and
  signaling. DHHC9 S-acylates H-RAS to stablize its localization on plasma membrance
  (PM) and activates the Raf-Erk pathway to regulate focal adhesion.Once the S-acylation
  is removed by APT1, H-RAS that is only farnesylated does not bind PM and cycles
  to Golgi.
