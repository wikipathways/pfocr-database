caption: Scheme of the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway and the uniform metabolite
  labeling after simultaneous incubation of cells with [U-13C]-glucose and CORM-401/iCORM-401.
  MEFs were simultaneously treated with [U-13C]-glucose and 50 µM CORM-401/iCORM-401
  or medium only (control), for 30, 90 or 240 min. Cells were then lysed and extracts
  analyzed via IC-MS analysis. Relative exchange rates of uniformly labeled metabolites
  are shown as mean ± SD (n = 4). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way
  ANOVA and results are given in .
