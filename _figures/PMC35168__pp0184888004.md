caption: Calcium-mediated signaling and the regulation of actin assembly and tension.
  A “road map” is presented for calcium signaling within the actin network. Regulatory
  molecules are presented with the inhibitory drugs used for identification listed
  beneath them. Other potential components of the regulatory pathway that have not
  been specifically tested, e.g. kinases, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs),
  and actin-binding proteins (ABPs), are also included on the map. Arrows indicate
  putative targets for calmodulin, kinases, and phosphatases.
