caption: A schematic depicting our model in which maturing erythroid cells rely on
  LAT3-mediated NEAA uptake to maintain homeostasis. In the absence of adequate uptake,
  reduced NEAA content, particularly L-leucine, triggers a reduction in mTORC1/4E-BP
  signalling and subsequent repression in translation for globin proteins. This mechanism
  is distinct from the previously identified eIF2α-dependent mechanism that becomes
  activated with severe amino acid deprivation (GCN2) or heme availability (HRI).
