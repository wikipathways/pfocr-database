caption: Simplified overview of acetyl-CoA metabolism and associated naringenin synthesis
  pathway in S. cerevisiae. Acetyl-CoA is generated in different compartments in yeast,
  including mitochondria (blue), cytosol [], and peroxisome (not shown). Three genes
  (4CL, CHS, and CHI) for naringenin synthesis were introduced into yeast genome.
  In addition, the rate-limiting enzyme of CoA synthesis, pantothenate kinase (PanK),
  and PDH bypass (ALD6 and SeAcs L641P) were introduced into S. cerevisiae to improve
  its acetyl-CoA level in cytosol
