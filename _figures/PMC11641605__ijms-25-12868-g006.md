caption: Crosstalk of ECM and hypoxia in the Hippo signaling pathway. The Hippo pathway
  can be influenced by various signals, including tight junctions, G protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs), the extracellular matrix (ECM), and hypoxia. Tight junctions
  modulate the activity of the Hippo core kinases by interacting with α-catenin and
  E-cadherin, furthermore impacting YAP/TAZ function. GPCRs can activate different
  G proteins, such as Gαi/o and Gαq/11, having distinct effects on the Hippo core
  kinases. The ECM transmits signals by altering the stiffness, releasing growth factors,
  and changing cell membrane polarity, which affects specific nodes in the Hippo pathway
  and alters the overall direction. Under normal conditions, YAP/TAZ are predominantly
  located in the cytoplasm, translocate to the nucleus via nuclear localization sequences,
  form complexes with AP-1, and bind to transcription factors such as TEADs to regulate
  downstream genes. The Hippo signaling pathway is activated when multiple upstream
  signals combined with the Hippo core kinases, leading to the phosphorylation of
  YAP/TAZ, which facilitates their binding to 14-3-3 proteins, preventing nuclear
  translocation and resulting in their ubiquitination and degradation or recruitment
  to the cell membrane. Under hypoxia, HIF pathway stabilizes HIF-1α, enabling it
  to dimerize with HIF-1β, facilitating HIF-1 entry into the nucleus to bind with
  HREs and regulate downstream gene expression. Created with BioRender.com
