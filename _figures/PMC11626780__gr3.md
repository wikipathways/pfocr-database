caption: Glutamine interconversions and metabolic pathways. Glutamine is essential
  for the synthesis of other amino acids. The details are shown in the figure. In
  vitro ingested glutamine is converted by glutamate as well as downstream enzymes
  to produce other amino acids that provide cell survival provide nutrients for cell
  survival
