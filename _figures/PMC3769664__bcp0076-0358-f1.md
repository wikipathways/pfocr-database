caption: The cell cycle checkpoint pathway activated by DNA damage. ATR and ATM are
  activated by DNA single-strand regions or double-strand breaks, respectively. Chk1
  and Chk2 are then activated, although Chk2 does not usually appear to elicit cell
  cycle arrest. Arrest is induced by phosphorylation and inhibition of CDC25 (either
  through degradation or sequestration). When Chk1 is inhibited, CDC25 is activated,
  which in turn activates cyclin/CDK complexes, driving the cell through the cell
  cycle, even when DNA damage persists
