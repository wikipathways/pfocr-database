caption: Schematic diagram of the role of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme)-2 in
  the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The severe acute respiratory
  coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) viral spike protein (red symbols) binds to the extracellular
  domain of ACE-2, and the virus and ACE-2 are internalized enabling viral entry into
  cells and reducing ACE-2 activity. Extracellular ACE-2 also is shed into the circulation
  during the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection by an ADAM-17 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17)–dependent
  process. The net effect is increased action of Ang II (angiotensin II) at AT1Rs
  (Ang II type 1 receptors) promoting detrimental inflammatory responses and reduced
  Ang (1–7) (angiotensin (1–7)) formation and consequent activity at the Mas receptor—a
  beneficial counterregulatory receptor of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE inhibitors
  and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) upregulate the protective ACE-2 pathway
  and downregulate the detrimental Ang II-AT1R pathway, theoretically protecting the
  infected host from COVID-19. ACE indicates angiotensin converting enzyme; and ROS,
  reactive oxygen species.
