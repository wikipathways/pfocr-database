caption: The mechanism graph of the regulatory network and function of FoxM1-mediated
  miR-335-3p in NSC self-renewal. miR-335-3p activated by FoxM1 could suppress NSC
  differentiation but promote NSC self-renewal by inactivating p53 signaling pathway
  via binding to Fmr1
papertitle: Transcriptional factor FoxM1-activated microRNA-335-3p maintains the self-renewal
  of neural stem cells by inhibiting p53 signaling pathway via Fmr1.
