caption: aEFE•Fe(II) binds 2OG predominantly in two monodentate conformations, with
  a small amount of chelate coordination to the metal. The nearby binding of L-Arg
  leads to a change in orientation of D191 (shown in cyan) as it forms a hydrogen
  bond with this substrate and the 2OG switches to bidentate coordination. Dioxygen
  binds to the metallocenter opposite of L-Arg to form the Fe(III)-superoxo species
  that transforms to a cyclic peroxide-Fe(IV) intermediate. The mechanism diverges
  at this intermediate, with the predominant pathway invoking a decarboxylative fragmentation
  to release ethylene with oxalic acid transiently bound to the ferryl species. Subsequent
  reactivity of this intermediate yields CO2 and bicarbonate or two molecules of CO2
  () and the recycled EFE•Fe(II). The second pathway depicts oxidative decarboxylation
  of 2OG to yield succinate and a ferryl species pointing away from the L-Arg substrate.
  A ferryl flip repositions the ferryl group to point toward C5 of L-Arg, with F283
  (and the repositioned D191) partly hindering this process. Hydrogen atom abstraction,
  hydroxyl radical rebound, elimination of guanidine from 5-hydroxy L-Arg, and ring
  formation complete this cycle.
