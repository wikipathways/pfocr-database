caption: Schematic representation of Hippo-regulated antimicrobial activities in oriental
  river prawns. In M. nipponense, Hippo–Yorkie signalling was activated by Gram-positive
  and Gram-negative bacteria. The activation of this signalling axis excluded Yorkie
  from the nucleus. Inhibition of the Hippo pathway promoted Yorkie translocation,
  enabling Cactus transcription; the high expression of Cactus prevented the transfer
  of Dorsal/Dif from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, thereby reducing the expression
  of AMPs (such as ALF, crustin, and lysozyme).
