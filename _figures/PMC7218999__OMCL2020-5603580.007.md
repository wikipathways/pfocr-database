caption: 'Protein-protein interaction analysis based on STRING with an interaction
  confidence score (0.400). SFO-HF: offspring from sedentary fathers exposed to high-fat
  diet; TFO-HF: offspring from trained fathers exposed to high-fat diet. STRING analysis
  for differentially abundant proteins upregulated in the analysis (TFO-HF : SFO-HF).
  Red highlighted nodes are related to metabolic processes including oxidative stress
  protection, glycolysis pathway, mitochondrial respiratory chain, and fatty acid
  metabolism proteins (a) and to translation, nucleosome assembly, and transcription
  regulation (b).'
