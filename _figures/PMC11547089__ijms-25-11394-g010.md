caption: 'Expression of genes involved in AsA biosynthesis in L. chinense fruits across
  three developmental stages: GF, CCF, and RRF. The AsA biosynthesis pathways examined
  include the L-Galactose pathway, the D-Galacturonate pathway, the L-Gulose pathway,
  and the Myo-inositol pathway. Nine green words represented the differential metabolites
  associated with AsA metabolism, while twelve red words denoted the enzymes involved
  in this process. The color coding indicated the accumulation levels of DAM, ranging
  from low (light blue) to high (purple), as well as the accumulation levels of DEG,
  from low (green) to high (red). The color coding indicated the accumulation levels
  of EN (enzyme activity), ranging from low (pink) to high (deep blue). The blocks,
  arranged from left to right, correspond to the GF, CCF, and RRF stages. The heatmap
  illustrated the normalized FPKM values, standardized by Z-score'
