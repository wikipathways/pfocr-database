caption: Synthesis of a block graft copolymer by ATRP and then ROMP (direct pathway
  downward), followed by acidolysis to release an amphiphilic graft block copolymer.
  A similar product was afforded by acidolysis at the macromonomer stage followed
  by ROMP under emulsion polymerization conditions.
