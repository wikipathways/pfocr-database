caption: 'Metabolic and mitochondria-mediated effects in PKD. (A) In mitochondria
  of the healthy cells, PDH converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is the main
  fuel for the TCA cycle, which produces NADH and succinate needed for OXPHOS to create
  ATP molecules. PPARα and PGC1α promote energy metabolism by affecting FAO and OXPHOS
  and help maintain normal mitochondrial biogenesis. PC1/PC2 complexes in cilia and
  mitochondria-associated membranes of the ER keep Ca2+ concentration level in range
  that is sufficient to successfully modulate mitochondrial metabolism, facilitate
  the work of TCA cycle enzymes, and affect ATP synthase activity. (B) In cystic cells,
  there is a Warburg shift in ATP production from OXPHOS to glycolysis. Overexpression
  of HIF-1α increases the expression of GLUT1, which allows more glucose molecules
  to pass into the cell. In addition, HIF-1α affects PDK1 that inhibits PDH and reduces
  conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. miR-17 inhibits PPARα and PGC1α, which decreases
  OXPHOS, FAO, and mitochondria biogenesis, and results in ROS production and mitochondrial
  swelling. In addition, the abnormalities of Ca2+ transport caused by PC1/PC2 dysfunction
  also decrease OXPHOS and TCA cycle efficacy, and PDH activity. The AMPK-ERK-mTOR
  pathway can be targeted to curtail mitochondrial metabolic abnormalities; metformin
  and other similar drugs can activate AMPK and (independently) suppress cAMP production,
  which also affects mitochondria. ERK1/2 inhibits AMPK activity and upregulates mTORC1,
  which then stimulates aerobic glycolysis, increases ATP production, and further
  inhibits AMPK. Abbreviations: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS), affecting fatty acid oxidation (FAO), AMP-activated protein Kinase (AMPK),
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), mammalian target of rapamycin complex
  1 (mTORC1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα), peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α), reactive oxygen species (ROS), pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase 1 (PDK1), hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1α (HIF-1α). Green triangles
