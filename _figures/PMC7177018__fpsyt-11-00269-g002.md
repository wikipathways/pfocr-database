caption: Enrichment of signaling pathways of metabolites in depression-associated
  suicide. All metabolites in depression-associated suicidal behavior were defined
  as KEGG C-numbers and brought into Reactome Pathway Analysis. Relevant pathways
  were highlighted. The right side bar indicates p-value.
