caption: 'STAs and MET for the treatment of DENV and ZIKV infections. (A) STAs and
  MET inhibit DENV infection in hepatocytes. STAs interfere with cholesterol biosynthesis
  pathways through competitive inhibition of HMGCR, affecting viral replication, morphogenesis,
  and progeny during infections in liver cells. STAs enhance the innate immune response
  by inhibiting isoprenoid synthesis. MET activates the AMPK pathway, which has many
  downstream targets. MET reduces cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis directly (enzyme
  inactivation) and via the SREBP pathway. MET also induces the interferon-mediated
  response via AMPK. Both drugs enhance the innate immune response by connecting the
  mevalonate pathway and the interferon response in specific cell types. (B) MET and
  neuropathogenesis in the brain of ZIKV-infected mice. It has been suggested that
  ZIKV can up-or down-regulate cell type-dependent AMPK activity. Activation of AMPK
  by MET could have a dual effect: counteracting infection in tissues where the virus
  down-regulates AMPK activity and contributing to the pathology and cell death of
  tissues where AMPK activation favors viral replication. It has been hypothesized
  that MET could contribute to apoptosis in neuronal cells.'
