caption: Canonical TGF-beta signaling pathway consists of Smad phosphorylation and
  mediation of transcriptional regulation, leading to cell death and growth suppression,
  representing a tumor suppressor activity. The non-canonical route includes the activation
  of Ras/MAPK pathway as a result of phosphorylation and binding of TGF-beta receptor
  to Shc and consequently recruitment of Grb2 and Sos. TGF-beta-stimulated activation
  of Ras/MAPK pathway induces expression of genes involved in cell survival and growth.
  Dab2 modulates TGF-beta signaling by sequestering Grb2 from Sos, resulting in a
  reduction of Ras/MAPK activation yet allowing Smad-mediated gene transcription.
