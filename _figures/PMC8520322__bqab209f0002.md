caption: During the prenatal stage, in the fetal ovary, gestational diabetes mellitus
  (GDM) associated in utero with high glucose and high insulin induces miR-101 expression
  and activates the PI3K/Akt pathway. Ezh2 gets inactivated by its phosphorylation
  at S21 by PI3K/Akt, while miR-101 permanently reduces Ezh2 levels, decreasing H3K27me3
  expression, a repressive mark from the Cartpt promoter. Low Ezh2 levels triggers
  cAMP response element–binding protein–binding protein/p300 recruitment with an increase
  in H3K27ac, a gene activation mark on the Cartpt promoter. Moreover, in utero high
  glucose converts 5mC, a long-term gene silencing mark, through activation of ten-eleven
  translocation enzymes to 5hmc, an active transcriptional regulatory region, on CpG
  sites in the 5′ upstream sequence of the mouse Cartpt promoter. Cartpt promoter
  converts to a superpromoter in the presence of high expression of gene-activating
  marks and depletion of repressive marks and makes it more sensitive to leptin levels.
  Later in life, encounter with a slight increase in leptin levels increases CART
  expression that compromises reproductive health (adapted from Sinha et al) ().
