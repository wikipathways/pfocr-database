caption: Stimulations from various sources induce pulmonary inflammation through the
  cGAS-STING pathway. Cigarette smoke mediates lung inflammation by the activation
  of cGAS-STING-IFN1 and the formation of NETs. With simulations of LPS, macrophage
  could release mtDNA, which was sensed by cGAS-STING and induced NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis
  as well as lung inflammation. Silica exposure to bronchus leads to different forms
  of STING-dependent cell death including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis.
  The dsDNA from the dead cells triggers lung inflammation via STING-IRF3 signaling.
