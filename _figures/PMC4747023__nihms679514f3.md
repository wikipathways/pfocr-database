caption: 'Growth factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activates downstream
  signaling through the PI3 kinase and MAP kinase signaling pathways. PI3 kinase alpha
  is comprised of the p85 regulatory subunit and the p110α catalytic subunit, encoded
  by PIK3R1 and PIK3CA, respectively. PI3K phosphorylates the signaling lipid PIP2
  to generate PIP3, leading to subsequent activation of downstream cascades, including
  the serine/threonine kinase AKT. The PTEN tumour suppressor is a protein and lipid
  phosphatase that directly reverses the action of PI3K. Growth factor binding to
  RTKs can activate both RAS and PI3K through different adapter proteins, or through
  direct interaction with PI3K, depending on the specific receptor. RAS is a small
  G-protein which is activated when in the GTP-bound state. The NF1 tumour suppressor
  is a GTP-ase activating protein that negatively regulates RAS activity. RAS participates
  in PI3K pathway signaling as well as downstream signaling through the serine/threonine
  kinase BRAF to additional downstream targets in the MAP kinase pathway. The frequency
  of mutations for the most recurrently mutated components of these pathways in paediatric
  high-grade glioma are indicated–. Some mutations show different frequencies in cortical
  (Cort) versus thalamic/midline HGGs or DIPGs. Of note, PTEN and EGFR mutations,
  which are frequent in adults, are not highly recurrent in childhood HGGs. mut: mutated,
