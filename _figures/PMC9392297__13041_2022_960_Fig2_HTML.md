caption: TLRs signaling. TIR domain-containing adaptors and TLR signaling. MyD88 is
  an essential TIR domain-containing adaptor for the induction of inflammatory cytokines
  via all the TLRs. Upon stimulation, MyD88 recruits IL-1 receptor-associated kinase
  (IRAK) to TLRs. IRAK is activated by phosphorylation and then dimerizes with TRAF6,
  leading to the activation of two distinct signaling pathways, finally activating
  MAPK and NF-kB to elicit proinflammatory cytokines. TIRAP/Mal is a second TIR domain-containing
  adaptor that specifically mediates the MyD88-dependent pathway via TLR2 and TLR4,
  While TRIF specifically participates in the MyD88-independent pathway mediated by
  TLR3 and TLR4, TLR2 leads to the complexity of signal pathway by forming tlr2-tlr1
  and tlr2-tlr6 heterodimers and starts intracellular signal transduction. Both homodimers
  (TLR10/TLR10) and heterodimers (TLR10/TLR2) can recruit MyD88. TLR10 can reduce
  the production of IL-1β by directly inhibiting MyD88 or MAPK. Although several studies
  have suggested its inflammatory properties, TLR10 has also been shown to increase
  the production of IL-1Ra (an anti-inflammatory factor), but the underlying mechanism
  is still unclear, as indicated by question marks. Nucleic acids in endolysosomes
  activate TLR3, TLR7 or TLR9 and initiate different and overlapping signal cascades
