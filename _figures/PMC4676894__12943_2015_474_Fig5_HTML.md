caption: 'Proposed model for the postulated functions of STAT1 in HR-DLBCL-NOS. Chronic
  exposure to IFNs and chemotherapeutic agents such as alkylating agents, topoisomerase
  inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, or proteasome inhibitors, can lead to constitutive
  oncogenic upregulation of STAT1 and interferon signaling genes (ISGs) during tumor
  development [–, , –] and select tumor clones resistant to a cytotoxic microenvironment
  and concurrently to genotoxic therapy []. The overall population of tumor cells
  is sensitive to cytotoxic factors of microenvironment and committed to death because
  of the secretion of cytotoxic ligands by host cells (T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes,
  tumor-associated macrophages, dendritic cells etc.) []. The majority of tumor cells
  are relatively sensitive to radio- and/or chemotherapy. However, a small fraction
  of tumor cells (HR-DLBCL cells) constitutively express STAT1/ISGs and are resistant
  to the cytotoxic microenvironment and genotoxic therapy. Oncogenic constitutive
  expression of STAT1 can activate the prosurvival secretome, including the interleukines
  IL6 and IL10 [, , ] and in turn, can enhance selective advantages of surrounding
  tumor cells []. Moreover, STAT1 pathway can be also activated in the context of
  IL6 and IL10 [, ], thereby generating auto-stimulatory feedback loops (IL6-IL16R-STAT1
  and IL10-IL10R-STAT1). Thus, IFN/JAK pathway and chemotherapeutic agents may act
  in concert with other HR-DLBCL specific intrinsic signaling pathways such as IL10/IL10R-JAK1-TYK2
  and or IL6/IL6R-gp130-JAK1/2-TYK2 to induce chemotherapy resistance. In addition,
  oncogenic JAK/STAT1α-autocrine signaling in HR-DLBCL causes enhanced expression
  of STAT1α dependent proto-oncogenes (i.e., DTX3L ARTD9, IRF2, MCL1, BCL2, BCL6),
  thereby stimulating proliferation and survival pathways []. In addition, oncogenic
  STAT1α signaling helps the tumors to escape the attack by the immune system (immunoediting)

  and pro-apoptotic genes (including tumor the suppressors IRF1 and TP53) [, ] as
  well as genes involved in immune surveillance [, , ]. Adapted from REF: [, , ].
