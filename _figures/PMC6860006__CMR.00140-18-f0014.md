caption: Galactose-containing molecules and their synthesis, an understudied pathway
  that is essential for in vivo fungal growth. GM, galactomannan; GAG, galactosaminogalactan;
  Ugm1, UDP galactospyranose mutase; Uge3/5, UDP glucose epimerase; GfsA, galactofuranosyltransferase;
  Gt4C, Scl1/2, and Adg3 are members of the biosynthetic cluster for galactosaminogalactan;
  Dfg, orthologs of the DCW5/DFG1 pathway of yeast involved in the binding of the
  GM to β1,3 glucans; m, mycelium; c, conidium; ManPol, a complex of 11 mannosyltransferases
  involved in the synthesis of the conidial mannan (based on data from references
  , , , , and ), indicates the unknown members of this biosynthetic pathway.
