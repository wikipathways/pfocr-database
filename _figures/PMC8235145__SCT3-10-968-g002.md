caption: 'The INCuBAToR (Innovative Neonatal Cellular Therapy for BPD: Accelerating
  Translation of Research) for the successful clinical translation of cell‐based therapies
  in neonates. The classical pathway to clinical translation includes the preclinical
  stage of discovery, exploratory, and confirmatory studies that provide the biological
  plausibility for the use of a novel therapy for a given disease and the rationale
  for initiating clinical trials. Numerous clinical trials fail because of shortcomings
  in the preclinical stages and/or lack of integration of critical information into
  clinical trial design. The INCuBAToR is designed to mitigate the risk of translating
  cell therapies into the clinic by providing an evidence‐based approach through the
  following. A, Preclinical and clinical systematic reviews and meta‐analyses to evaluate,
  synthesize, and quantitatively assess the best available evidence and identify knowledge
  gaps. B, Integrated knowledge translation to engage pertinent stakeholders, including
  patients, parents, physicians, nurses, and regulatory agencies, to identify opportunities
  and barriers in clinical trial implementation. C, Early economic evaluation to establish
  a “headroom analysis” for early determination of the potential value of the cell
  therapy. D, Retrospective cohort studies to estimate sample size, adverse events,
  and understanding of current patterns of care; this information can then be further
  refined by prospective observational cohort studies to provide “real world, real
  time” evidence to ensure feasibility and ultimately success of the clinical translation'
