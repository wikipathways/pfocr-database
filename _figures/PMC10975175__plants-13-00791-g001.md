caption: 'Heat stress can directly disrupt or harm the functioning of proteins, membranes,
  and DNA in plants or by generating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS).
  This disruption negatively impacts photosynthesis and plant growth. Ethylene, acting
  through EIN3 (signaling component), triggers the activation of ERF95, ERF97, ERF1,
  ERF74, and ERF75 by binding to their respective promoter regions. ERF95 and ERF97
  can form both heterodimers and homodimers, and they play a role in regulating the
  expression of HSFA2 by directly binding to its promoter. ERF1, on the other hand,
  controls the expression of HSFA3. All of these, in turn, regulate the expression
  of various genes responsible for producing heat shock proteins (HSPs), antioxidants,
  and osmolytes, thus helping plants in heat stress tolerance. Red solid arrow: Direct
  heat-mediated effect; Red faded arrow: Heat-induced ROS/RNS mediated effect; Green
  arrow: Ethylene mediated responses (solid arrow: direct pathway; dotted arrow: multistep
  pathway; head flat arrow: Inhibition)'
