caption: Apoptotic signaling in aging muscles. This figure summarizes the extrinsic
  death domain pathway and intrinsic pathway for mitochondrial apoptosis in aging
  muscles under conditions of muscle loss (e.g., unloading, denervation). The increase
  (+) and the decrease (−) in the direction of the change in apoptotic signaling in
  response to muscle wasting insults for proteins in these pathways are indicated
  in muscles from young adult (black) and old (gray) animals. Double positive (++)
  or double negative (−−) signs indicate a large increase or decrease in protein levels,
  respectively. Proapoptotic pathways are shown by lines and arrows. A line with a
  blunt end indicates an antiapoptotic influence. Dotted lines show examples of proapoptotic
  proteins that are released from the mitochondria in response to muscle wasting,
  which can either directly (e.g., AIF) or indirectly (e.g., cytochrome c) induce
  nuclear apoptosis in muscle cells. TRADD, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 associated
  death domain.
