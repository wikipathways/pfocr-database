caption: Metabolic pathway of folates and biopterin in Leishmania spp. The folate
  pathway primarily involves the DHFR-TS enzyme for the formation of dihydrofolate
  (DHF) and then tetrahydrofolate (THF). If the DHFR enzyme is inhibited, PTR1 provides
  sufficient folate to ensure the parasite’s survival. The biopterin pathway involves
  two steps where biopterin is first converted to dihydrobiopterin (DHB) and then
  DHB to tetrahydrobiopterin (THB). This reaction occurs through the interaction with
  Asp and Arg residues
