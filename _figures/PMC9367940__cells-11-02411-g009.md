caption: Proposed signalling pathway of the influence of denatonium on transepithelial
  ion transport. Denatonium binding to Tas2R in brush cells leads to a Gβγ-dependent
  activation of PLCβ2, which results in an activation of IP3 receptors. The increase
  in [Ca2+]i leads to an activation of Trpm5 followed by a release of ACh. The released
  ACh then binds to nAChR on neighbouring cells, resulting in an inhibition of ENaC
  and chloride channels. Simultaneously, the Gα-dependent reduction of [cAMP]i in
  brush cells might lead to an additional decrease in ENaC, CFTR, and KCNQ1 as well
  as NKCC1 activity.
