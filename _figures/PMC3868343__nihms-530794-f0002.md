caption: A molecular basis for synergistic activation through pairs of coactivation
  receptors on NK cells. Cytotoxicity and secretion by primary resting NK cells requires
  synergistic signals from two coactivation receptors, such as 2B4 and NKG2D or 2B4
  and DNAM-1. This synergy is required to overcome inhibition by the ubiquitin ligase
  c-Cbl of a Vav1-dependent activation pathway. Stimulation through 2B4 results in
  a Fyn-dependent, Syk-independent, selective phosphorylation of Tyr113, but not Tyr128
  in the adaptor protein SLP-76. Conversely, stimulation through NKG2D or DNAM-1 results
  in selective, Syk-independent phosphorylation of Tyr128, but not Tyr113 in SLP-76.
  In contrast, stimulation by the Fcγ receptor CD16 results in Syk-dependent phosphorylation
  of both Tyr113 and Tyr128, as is the case after TCR signaling in T cells.
