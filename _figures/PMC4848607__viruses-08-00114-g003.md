caption: The KEGG pathway analysis of the RIG-I-like receptor DEGs expressed in response
  to SAV-3 infection TO-cells. Red squares show upregulated genes while green squares
  represent downregulated genes. Square having both red and green represent a mixed
  expression of upregulated (red) and downregulated (green) unigenes for the gene
  represented. Black squares show that the genes represented were not expressed in
  TO-cells.
