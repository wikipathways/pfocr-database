caption: Fig 2A Autoregulation of Release Factor 2 (RF2) synthesis by programmed +1
  ribosomal frameshifting. The open reading frame encoding RF2, the translation termination
  factor that recognizes the UGA and UAA termination codons, contains an in-frame
  UGA codon that must be bypassed for complete translation of the protein. Low levels
  of RF2 promote inefficient recognition of the UGA codon. Ribosome pausing at this
  site enables base-pairing between an upstream Shine-Dalgarno like sequence, repositioning
  the ribosome to the +1 reading frame. The resulting +1 PRF event results in RF2
  production. As RF2 levels rise, UGA codon recognition increases, dampening frameshifting
  and RF2 production.Figure 2B Autoregulation of polyamine synthesis by programmed
  +1 ribosomal frameshifting. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) converts ornithine into
  putrescine, the substrate for all subsequent polyamine biosynthesis. Excess levels
  of polyamines stimulate +1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting on the antizyme mRNA,
  resulting in synthesis of antizyme (AZ). This enzyme sequesters ODC, triggering
  ODC degradation by the 26S proteosome. AZ is not degraded, but is recycled into
  the pathway.
