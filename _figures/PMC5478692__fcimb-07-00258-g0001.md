caption: Schematic overview of Imd pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. DAP-type PGNs
  trigger the activation of Imd signaling by direct interaction with the immune cell.
  Of Peptido-Glycan Recognition Proteins (PGRPs) that bind these pathogen-derived
  molecules, transmembrane PGRP-LC is the main receptor linked to activation of Imd
  pathway (Choe et al., ; Gottar et al., ). Its activity is enhanced in circulation
  by secreted PGRP-SD and intracellularly by the cytosolic PGRP-LE (Takehana et al.,
  ; Iatsenko et al., ). Both proteins can directly bind DAP-PGNs and promote PGRP-LC
  activity. Another extracellular PGN-binding protein PGRP-LB antagonizes PGRP-LC
  activity by scavenging PGNs in circulation (Zaidman-Rémy et al., ). PGN binding
  induces conformational changes in PGRP-LC that promotes recruitment of the death
  domain-containing proteins Imd, FADD and DREDD caspase from the nucleus to the plasma
  membrane, and it is followed by subsequent polyubiquitination of DREDD by ubiquitin
  E3 ligase IAP2, cleavage of Imd by DREDD and exposure of K63 site for polyubiquitination
  by IAP2 and E2 conjugating enzymes Bendless, Effete and Uev1a (Paquette et al.,
  ; Meinander et al., ). The K63-polyubiquitin chains, most likely, serve as activators
  of TAK1 kinase via the ubiquitin-binding domain of its regulatory protein TAB2 (Paquette
  et al., ). TAK1/TAB2 complex phosphorylates IKK complex, which consists of β and
  γ subunits. IKKβ further phosphorylates the NF-κB-like transcription factor Relish,
  while a regulatory IKKγ subunit regulates DREDD-mediated cleavage of Relish (Ertürk-Hasdemir
  et al., ). Relish consists of the Rel Homology Domain (RHD) and the inhibitory ankyrin-repeat
  rich domain (ANK) (Dushay et al., ). DREDD caspase cleaves the ANK domain from RHD.
  RHD translocates to the nucleus and initiates transcription of target genes. Caspar
  acts as a negative regulator of the pathway by inhibiting DREDD-dependent cleavage
  of Relish (Kim et al., ). Immunomodulatory cytokine Diedel restrains deleterious
  non-canonical activation of Imd in presence and absence of viral infection (Lamiable
  et al., ). Receptor that activates the pathway to viruses is not yet known However,
  epistasis analyses placed Diedel function between Imd and IKKγ, as mutants for both
  Diedel and Imd were more prone to spontaneous pathogenesis than Diedel/IKKγ double
  mutants (Lamiable et al., ). Additionally, activation of the pathway is held in
  check by other factors, including CYLD, Dnr1, and Pirk. Finally, transcriptional
  activity of Relish is regulated at the chromatin level through interactions with
  a nuclear co-factor Akirin and BAP60 component of Brahma chromatin remodeling complex.
  Akirin recruits BAP60 complex to promoters of a subset of Relish effector genes
  and hence regulates their transcription (Goto et al., ; Bonnay et al., ). Positive
  and inhibitory interactions are depicted with → and |–, respectfully; black—well
  established, and red—yet unknown interactions. Color coding highlights our current
  knowledge on the pathway in Anopheles gambiae. Confirmed pathway components are
  indicated in color. Components depicted in gray represent orthologs identified by
  genomic searches, but whose function was not experimentally validated. Components
  in gray with dashed lines are absent in A. gambiae.
