caption: 'NLR-mediated signaling pathway in mammals. The recognition of PAMPs/DAMPs
  [Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns/Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns) by
  NLRs (NOD (Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain)-like receptor proteins: NLRCs,
  NLRPs] promotes the recruitment of procaspase-1 (Pro-Casp1) through homotypic domain
  interaction, forming a large cytoplasmic complex named inflammasome. In some situation,
  the adaptor ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain)
  can take part to the complex, bridging the receptor to procaspase-1. The procaspase-1
  undergoes auto-activation and processing of its 2 active sub-units (p10 and p20)
  which assemble into a tetrameric active form. Active caspase-1 catalyzes the cleavage
  of proIL-18 (proInterleukine-18), proIL-1β (proInterleukine-1β) into mature cytokines,
  and gasdermin-D releasing the PFD domain that can oligomerizes and anchors into
  the membrane to form pores. Processing of gasdermin-D can also be ensured by caspase-4
  and caspase-5, which are activated after LPS binding. The gasdermin PFD can also
  form pores into the mitochondrial membrane that induce K+ release and ROS production.
  In addition, pores created in the plasma membrane by PFD also lead to IL1β and IL18
  release and to an ion imbalance that finally results in pyroptosis. The recognition
  of PAMPs/DAMPs by NOD1/2 promotes the formation of the NODosome composed of the
  sensor and the protein RIP2 (Receptor Interacting Protein 2) through CARD-dependent
  homotypic interaction. RIP2 can then recruit TAB1/TAB2/3/TAK1 and IKK complexes
  that engage MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways leading to the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines.'
