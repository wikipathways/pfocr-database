caption: Anti-apoptotic and cell survival activities of some HSPs in cancer. (A) Variant
  roles of HSP70 in carcinogenesis. High expression of HSP70 in tumor cells suppresses
  apoptosis by (1) hindering APAF1 recruitment to apoptosome, interfering with BAX
  translocation to mitochondria, downregulation of AIF1 and other stress-related kinases.
  Additionally, (2) HSP70 regulates both p53-dependent and -independent senescence
  pathways, (3) supports autophagy by stabilization of lysosomal membrane and finally
  (4) it forms complex with HSP90 which is essential for efficient functionality.
  (B) HSP60 controls apoptosis by stabilizing mitochondrial survivin (SVV) and hindering
  P53 pro-apoptotic actions. HSP60 ablation results in degradation of SVV and activation
  of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In addition, silencing of HSP60 increases
  P53 stability and subsequently, triggers p53-dependent transcription of apoptotic
  proteins such as BAX which promotes cell death []. (C) HSP27 performs multiple functions
  in cancer including protein folding, actin remodeling, minimizing oxidative stress
  and inhibition of apoptosis. Sample anti-apoptotic events of HSP27 are indicated
  by red blunt arrows.
