caption: The topological characteristics of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways.
  Graphs were generated from Metabolomics Pathway Analysis using MetPA. (A) Phenylpropanoid
  pathway map displaying some of the OPLS-DA selected metabolites, altered in response
  to C. sublineolum infection. (B) Flavonoid pathway map showing OPLS-DA selected
  metabolites altered during sorghum responses to C. sublineolum infection. (*) indicate
  overlapping points where metabolic pathways interconnect. Due to the limitation
  of the MetPA tool (considering the database used and search algorithm) not all metabolites
  that were chemometrically extracted (Table ) could be mapped in the constructed
  pathway graphs.
