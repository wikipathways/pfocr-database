caption: Signaling pathways and factors involved in programmed cell death ligand-1(PD-L1)-induced
  resistance. (1) PD-L1 expression induced by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  mutation activation via extracellular single-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, indirectly
  promotes expression of Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1 (BAG-1), the EGFR/ERK/PD-L1/BAG-1
  feedback loop reaches the reactivation of ERK signaling which promotes Bcl-2-interacting
  mediator of cell death (BIM) phosphorylation to help cells escape from apoptosis.
  (2) PD-L1-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) expression is stimulated
  by reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypoxia increases YAP-1 expression which confers
  resistance via a YAP1/EGFR/ERK/NF-κB loop. (3) PD-L1 regulates DNA methyltransferase
  1(DNMT1) via Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling
  and thus induces DNMT1-dependent DNA hypomethylation which promotes cancer development.
  (4) Activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)/Smad pathway induced by
  PD-L1 is crucial in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) expression which
  leads to resistance to TKIs.
