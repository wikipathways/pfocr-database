caption: Tryptophan affects central nervous system activity. The protective effect
  of the AhR ligand on CNS autoimmunity is through the IFN-I-AhR-Socs2-NF-κB signaling
  pathway. Microglia can send signals to astrocytes to mediate the response to the
  inflammatory in CNS. The microbial metabolites of tryptophan regulate the microglial
  activation, produce TGFα and VEGF-B, regulate CNS-related diseases, and the transcription
  in astrocytes through AhR. Microglia derived-TGFα can bind to the ErbB1 in astrocytes
  to show exert neuroprotective effects. In contrast, VEGF-B production triggers FLT-1
  signaling in astrocytes. AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; IFN-I, Type I interferon;
  Socs2, suppressors of cytokine signaling 2; IFNAR-1, AhR-mediated interferon-α receptor-1;
  TGFα, transforming growth factor-alpha; VEGF-B, vascular endothelial growth factor
  B; ErbB1, epidermal growth receptor; FLT-1, endothelial growth factor receptor 1.
