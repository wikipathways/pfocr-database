caption: Suggested signalling events involved in the effects induced by combined treatment
  with proteinase-activated receptor-2 activating peptide (PAR2-cAP) and interferon-γ
  (IFN-γ) on monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) secretion by human neutrophils
  (a) and monocytes (b). Experiments with selective inhibitors of signalling molecules
  led us to suggest that the phosphoinositide 3 kinase–protein kinase δ (PI3K–PKCδ)
  axis plays a key role in changes of MCP-1 secretion induced by co-application of
  PAR2-cAP and IFN-γ in human neutrophils (a). However, the inhibition of the PI3K
  molecule in human monocytes just weakened the effect of combined PAR2-cAP and IFN-γ
  application on MCP-1 secretion. This indicates the involvement of the PI3K-independent
  pathway in the effect of PAR2-cAP and IFN-γ co-application on MCP-1 secretion by
  monocytes (b).
