caption: Coordinated regulation of different host cellular pathways by Legionella
  pneumophila effectors. Upon bacterial infection, Ub-modulating effectors of the
  pathogen interfere with the vesicular trafficking between the ER and the Golgi to
  establish the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). SidE proteins PR-ubiquitinate
  several host proteins, including Rab33, SdeD removes this modification from the
  substrates, and SidJ negatively regulates the activity of the SidE proteins. The
  bacterial DUBs act to reduce ubiquitination on the LCV. SidE proteins can also serve
  to remove Ub from the LCV. Soon after infection, the bacteria target the ER-associated
  GTPase, Rab1. SidM recruits Rab1 to the LCV and activates it. PTMs such as AMPylation
  (by SidM) and phosphocholination (by AnkX) lock Rab1 in its active conformation
  (Rab1GTP). At later stages of infection, SidD and Lem3 remove these modifications
  from Rab1, allowing it to be inactivated by LepB. Rab1GDP is then removed from the
  LCV by GDIs. Legionella infection also affects the host immune response. Ubiquitination
  of Ube2N by MavC interferes with Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, dampening the
  NF-κB signaling pathway. MvcA and lpg2149 counteract the ubiquitinating activity
  of MavC at later stages of infection.
