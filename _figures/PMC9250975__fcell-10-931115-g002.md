caption: Versatile roles of UBAP2L in promoting cancer disease. UBAP2L upregulates
  key cell cycle regulators such as CyclinB1, CDK1 and the PI3K/Akt pathway, while
  it inhibits the expression of tumor suppressors such as PTEN and P21, thereby promoting
  cell proliferation and growth. PI3K/Akt activation enhances SP1 levels which in
  turn activates P65 expression, thereby activating NF-κB pathway and favoring epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT), migration and invasion. The metastatic potential of UBAP2L-overexpressing
  cells is also sustained by the activation of the SMAD2 pathway, triggering the transcriptional
  repressor SNAIL1 to the E-cadherin promoter, shutting down its expression. Cancer
  cells overexpressing UBAP2L are characterized by hyperactivation of the WNT/βcatenin
  pathway and by upregulation of mesenchymal factors such as N-cadherin and Vimentin,
  resulting in increased invasion and proliferation. Finally, UBAP2L favors tumor
  vascularization while inhibiting cancer cells apoptosis. Overall, UBAP2L promotes
  cancer progression by regulating various axes of tumorigenesis known as the hallmarks
  of cancer.
