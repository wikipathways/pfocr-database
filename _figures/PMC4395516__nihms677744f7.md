caption: Schematic representation of reported interactions between factors associated
  with Peters anomaly. The genes implicated in PA based on previous reports as well
  as this study are marked in bold. PITX2 and FOXC1 have been shown to physically
  bind and modulate the activity of each other () as well as to be regulated by TGFβ
  (; ), WNT and retinoic acid signaling pathways (; ; ); in connection with the WNT
  pathway, PITX2 has been reported to physically bind the DKK2 promoter (). Also,
  PITX2 has been shown to regulate the deposition of collagens by regulating the procollagen
  lysyl hydroxylase gene (). B3GLCT is a glucosyltransferase which catalyzes the addition
  of glucose to O-linked fucose via a β-1,3 linkage onto trombospondin type 1 repeats
  which have been found in the ADAMTS family of proteins (; ); some ADAMTS proteins
  have been shown to cleave heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (; ) and thus potentially
  affect TGFβ signaling (; ). NDP represents a WNT ligand (). TFAP2A has been shown
  to be responsive to retinoic acid, to inhibit the WNT pathway () and be involved
  in PITX2 regulation (). PAX6 deficiency has been shown to negatively affect FOXE3
  () and PITX3 expression (); PITX3 has been reported to directly regulate FOXE3 expression
  (; ). PAX6 and TFAP2A have been demonstrated to physically interact and promote
  transcription of some corneal genes (). CYP1B1 participates in the synthesis of
  retinoic acid (). FLNA appears to negatively regulate FOXC1 by physical binding
  and sequestering it to heterochromatin and is important for SMAD translocation into
  the nucleus (; ). FLNA may also be important in maintaining appropriate levels of
  WNT signaling ()
