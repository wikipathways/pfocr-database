caption: Schematic illustration of AF-MSC-EXO, HPL-EXO, HL-EXO, or rMFGE-8 treatment
  in CCl4-mice(A) The AF-MSC-EXO, HPL-EXO, or HL-EXO treatment promoted oval cell
  proliferation ex vivo. The administration of AF-MSC-EXO, HPL-EXO, or HL-EXO in CCl4-induced
  mice resulted in decrease of apoptosis levels, improvement of the inflammation phenotype,
  and downregulation of the PI3K pathway.(B) (i) Higher protein levels of MFGE-8 were
  detected in liver tissue from healthy donors compared with patients with AHF. (ii)
  The administration of rMFGE-8 in CCl4-induced mice ameliorated the AHF liver phenotype,
  decreased apoptosis levels, and downregulated PI3K pathway activity (Created with
