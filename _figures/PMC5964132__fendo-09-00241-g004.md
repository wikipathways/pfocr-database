caption: Multiple signaling pathways are upregulated in MCF7 parathyroid hormone-related
  protein-overexpressing cells. (A) STRING network analysis of the top 250 upregulated
  genes (with log2 fold change >1 and p < 0.05). Colors of each node correspond to
  the KEGG pathway indicated in (C). (B) STRING network analysis of the top 250 downregulated
  genes (with log2 fold change <−1 and p < 0.05). (C) KEGG biological pathways significantly
  enriched for in the STRING analysis of the top 250 upregulated genes. There were
  no significantly enriched KEGG biological pathways for the top 250 downregulated
  genes. Colors correspond to the nodes in (A).
