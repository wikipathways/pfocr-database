caption: Overview of the RFO metabolic pathway and corresponding genes in P. vulgaris
  and G. max. The galactinol- and RFO synthase genes for P. vulgaris and G. max are
  shown to the right of the metabolic pathway. The main expression of these genes,
  either in the seed or the vegetative tissue, is indicated behind the gene names
  and the expression level of these genes in the seed are indicated in color, ranging
  from red (high), orange (average) to blue (low or no expression).
