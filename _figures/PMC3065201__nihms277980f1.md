caption: Schematic diagram illustrating an overview of cellular injury and inflammatory-mediated
  steps in development of leiomyoma as compared with uterine scar formation caused
  by mechanical injury (i.e., myomectomy and cesarean delivery). Cellular/tissue injuries
  and generation of an inflammatory response, either at a small scale (microenvironment)
  or an extended area (myomectomy/cesarean delivery), result in individual and combined
  regulatory interactions among several proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators.
  These mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, eicosanoids, proteases,
  and extracellular matrix (ECM), activate to cause myoblasts and resident fibroblasts
  to differentiate into myofibroblastic phenotype. In addition, possible participation
  of fibrocytes, which are derived from bone marrow and through circulation reside
  at the site of inflammation/injury, as well as the transformation of vascular endothelial
  cells into mesenchymal cells, exist to transform into myofibroblastic phenotype.
  Collectively, myofibroblasts are highly responsive to the actions of many of the
  previously mentioned mediators, including profibrotic cytokines; they produce and
  deposit various components of ECM that are essential for tissue repair process.
  Continuous inflammation, excess myofibroblastic transformation, and production of
  a large quantity of ECM, with concurrently reduced degradation, represent a pathway
  that leads to development of either leiomyoma and/or scar tissue formation.EGF,
  endothelial growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage
