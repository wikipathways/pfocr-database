caption: A) The MEP pathway is used by higher plants, the plastids of algae, apicomplexan
  protozoa, and many eubacteria, including numerous human pathogens. Pyruvate (1)
  is condensed with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (2) to yield 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate
  (DXP; (3)) [], a branch point intermediate with a role in E. coli vitamin B1 and
  B6 biosynthesis ([], [], [], []) as well as isoprene biosynthesis. In the first
  committed step of the E. coli MEP pathway, 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase
  (also called MEP synthase, Dxr or IspC) catalyzes the reduction and rearrangement
  of 3 to yield MEP (4) []. CDP-ME synthase then converts MEP into 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  (CDP-ME; (5)). CDP-ME kinase phosphorylates CDP-ME, which is subsequently cyclized
  (coupled with the loss of CMP) by cMEPP synthase to yield 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate (7) ([], [], [], [], []). A reductive ring opening of 7 produces
  1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl diphosphate (HMBPP; (8))([], [], [], [], []) which
  is then reduced to both IPP and DMAPP in a ~5:1 ratio ([], [], [], [], [], [], []).
  B) The MVA pathway is utilized by humans and other eukaryotes, archaebacteria, and
  certain eubacteria to produce IPP and DMAPP, the building blocks of isoprenoids.
  The pathway is initiated by the enzymatic condensation of 3 molecules of acetyl-CoA
  (12) to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) (14), which is then reduced
  to MVA (15) by HMG-CoA reductase ([], []). Subsequent phosphorylation and decarboxylation
  yield IPP (10) ([], [], []) which is converted to DMAPP (11) by an isomerase [].
