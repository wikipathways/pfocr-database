caption: '(A) Muscle cell adhesion is mediated by integrin receptors on the cell membrane,
  which bind to ligands present in the extracellular matrix. This results in signaling
  via the mechanotransduction pathway, which leads to changes in gene expression and
  the modification of the cell phenotype. Cell adhesion is important for two reasons:
  (B) it enables myoblasts to follow geometrical cues, leading to their alignment
  as well as myotube and myofiber formation; (C) it allows stem cells to sense the
  mechanical properties of the underlying substrate and differentiate accordingly
  into specific tissue lineages. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to differentiate
  into the muscle lineage when cultured on polyacrylamide substrates with elastic
  moduli ranging between 8–17 kPa.'
