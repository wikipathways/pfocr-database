caption: (Right part) RAD inhibits mTOR and the downstream anti-apoptotic eIF4E-dependent
  pathway and, at the same time, causes inactivation of the beclin-1/bcl-2 complex
  formation inhibiting autophagy. Moreover, RAD induces a slight decrease of the activity
  of the survival enzymes Erk-1 and 2. (Left part) CLC increases the formation of
  the beclin-1/bcl-2 complexes thus inhibiting autophagy and, at the same time, induces
  a slight decrease of the Erk-1/2 activity and increases Akt activity. On these bases,
  the addition of CLC before RAD to EPCs inhibits autophagy occurrence through association
  of beclin-1 to bcl-2 and has poor effects on apoptosis as it decreases the activity
  of the pro-survival Erk-1/2, but increases the activity of the anti-apoptotic Akt.
  The subsequent addition of RAD potentiates the pro-apoptotic effects of CLC as it
  enhances the inhibition of Erk-1/2 and inhibits, at downstream levels, the Akt-dependent
  signalling (activated by CLC). In this way, the sequential treatment with the two
  agents induces a potent switch from autophagy to apoptosis in EPCs.
