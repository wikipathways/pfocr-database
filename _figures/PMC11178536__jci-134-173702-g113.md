caption: (A) Mitochondrial dysfunction in SMA iHeps. Dysfunction/dysregulation in
  mitochondrial complexes II, IV, and V, and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel
  protein (VDAC), as a result of decreased mRNA and/or protein subunit expression.
  (B) Lipid metabolism defects in SMA iHeps. Lipid metabolism gene expression dysregulation
  includes enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, lipid synthesis, and cholesterol
  synthesis pathways. Increased fatty acid accumulation due to cross-talk defects
  between mitochondria and fatty acid β-oxidation, increased cholesterol synthesis
  due to increased protein expression of HMGCS1, and increased triglyceride synthesis
  due to increased expression of SCD1 mRNA may account for overall lipid accumulation
  in SMA iHeps, as observed from Oil Red O staining assay. Portions of the figure
  were created with BioRender.com
