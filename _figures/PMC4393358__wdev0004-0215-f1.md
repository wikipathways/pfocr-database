caption: FGF and FGFR families. (a) Phylogenetic analysis suggests that 22 Fgf genes
  can be arranged into seven subfamilies containing two to four members each. Branch
  lengths are proportional to the evolutionary distance between each gene. The Fgf1,
  Fgf4, Fgf7, Fgf8, and Fgf9 subfamily genes encode secreted canonical FGFs, which
  bind to and activate FGFRs with heparin/HS as a cofactor. The Fgf15/19 subfamily
  members encode endocrine FGFs, which bind to and activate FGFRs with the Klotho
  family protein as a cofactor. The Fgf11 subfamily genes encode intracellular FGFs,
  which are non-signaling proteins serving as cofactors for voltage gated sodium channels
  and other molecules. (b) Schematic representations of FGFR protein structures are
  shown. FGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase of ∼800 amino acids with several domains
  including three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (I, II, and III), a transmembrane
  domain (TM), and two intracellular tyrosine kinase domains (TK1 and TK2). SP indicates
  a cleavable secreted signal sequence. The Fgfr gene family is comprised of four
  members, Fgfr1-Fgfr4. Among them, Fgfr1–Fgfr3 generate two major splice variants
  of immunoglobulin-like domain III, referred to as IIIb and IIIc, which are essential
  determinants of ligand-binding specificity. (c) The schematic representation of
  FGFRL1/FGFR5 protein structure is shown. FGFRL1, with structural similarity to FGFRs,
  is a membrane protein of ∼500 amino acids with three extracellular immunoglobulin-like
  domains (I, II, and III), a transmembrane domain (TM), and a short intracellular
  tail with no tyrosine kinase domain. SP indicates a cleavable secreted signal sequence.

  description: FGF and FGFR families. (a) Phylogenetic analysis suggests that 22 Fgf
    genes can be arranged into seven subfamilies containing two to four members each.
    Branch lengths are proportional to the evolutionary distance between each gene.
    The Fgf1, Fgf4, Fgf7, Fgf8, and Fgf9 subfamily genes encode secreted canonical
    FGFs, which bind to and activate FGFRs with heparin/HS as a cofactor. The Fgf15/19
