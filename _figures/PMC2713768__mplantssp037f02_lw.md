caption: Cell Wall-Related Biochemical Pathways Active in Mature Trichomes.(A) Synthesis
  of monosaccharides required for cell wall biosynthesis. Pathway was derived from
  a Mapman analysis ().(B) Synthesis of monolignols required for lignin biosynthesis.
  Pathway was derived from an AraCyc 4.5 analysis (). At all steps in both pathways,
  only the most highly expressed genes for each step are shown. Expression values
  (shown as a log10 derivative) are shown associated with predicted AGI gene identifiers.
