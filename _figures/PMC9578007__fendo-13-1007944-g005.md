caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of SELENOP, EDA and FETUB. (A) IPA investigated
  the molecular pathways of SELENOP involved in NAFLD and NASH. All identified pathways
  of SELENOP were screened individually. Representative canonical pathways of SELENOP
  are associated with other related genes of NAFLD and NASH. Functional relationships
  of these genes and SELENOP are depicted using straight lines with arrows. SELENOP
  is functionally related to 1. Hepatic stellate cell signaling and 2. NF-κB signaling
  (Right). (B, C) IPA investigated the molecular pathways of EDA and FETUB involved
  in NAFLD and NASH. All identified pathways of EDA and FETUB were screened individually.
  (D–F) IPA investigated the molecular pathways of Adipokine, Stellakine and Myokine
  network.
