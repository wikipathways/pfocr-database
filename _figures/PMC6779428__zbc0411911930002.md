caption: 'Detailed metabolic pathway from pantothenate to ergosterol. The pathway
  is divided into three subpathways: the CoA biosynthesis pathway from pantothenate
  (first box), the mevalonate pathway (second box), and the distal ergosterol biosynthetic
  pathway (third box). Solid arrows represent single enzymatic steps. Dashed arrows
  indicate multiple steps, catalyzed by the proteins in the order they are listed,
  from one intermediate to the next. Drug classes, individual drugs, and their site
  of action are shown in bold. Vit, vitamin; AAT, amino acid transporter; P-α-PanAm,
  phosphorylated α-PanAm.'
papertitle: The yeast pantothenate kinase Cab1 is a master regulator of sterol metabolism
  and of susceptibility to ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors.
