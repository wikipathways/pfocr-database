caption: Recycling pathway of murein turnover products in E. coli. During growth,
  lytic transglycosylases together with d,d-endopeptidases release monomeric 1,6-anhydromuropeptides
  in the periplasm, which are mostly tripeptide derivatives due to the presence of
  a l,d-carboxypeptidase. The turnover products can enter two different metabolic
  pathways. In one case, they are first degraded by an amidase (AmiA) () in the periplasm
  to the disaccharide and the peptide, which can be transported into the cell by the
  general oligopeptide transport system (Opp) () or the specific murein peptide permease
  (Mpp) (). The fate of the sugars is not well established. Alternatively, the turnover
  products can be taken up by the cell through the AmpG transporter, which accepts
  intact muropeptides (, ). In the cytoplasm, the muropeptides are further degraded
  by an amidase (AmpD) with a specificity for 1,6-anhydromuropeptides (, ) and an
  N-acetylglucosaminidase (), yielding free tripeptides, anhydro-MurNAc, and GlcNAc.
  The intermediate 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyltripeptide functions as an inducer of
  AmpC β-lactamases by interacting with the AmpR regulator (). The tripeptide can
  be reused directly for the synthesis of murein precursor molecules. A specific tripeptide
  ligase (Mpl) () forms UDPMurNAc tripeptide, which is a normal intermediate of the
  de novo murein biosynthetic pathway. Accordingly, a d-Ala–d-Ala dipeptide is linked
  to the tripeptide intermediate. The resulting UDPMurNAc-pentapeptide is then translocated
  to undecaprenyl phosphate, yielding the lipid I precursor that is supplemented by
  the addition of GlcNAc from UDPGlcNAc to the final lipid II precursor, the bactoprenol-linked
  disaccharide-pentapeptide. After its translocation to the periplasmic side of the
  membrane, the precursor is inserted into the murein sacculus by transpeptidation
  and transglycosylation reactions catalyzed by the high-molecular-weight PBP1A, PBP1B,
  PBP1C, PBP2, and PBP3. The released undecaprenyl pyrophosphate is hydrolyzed to
  undecaprenyl phosphate before it can enter a new cycle.
