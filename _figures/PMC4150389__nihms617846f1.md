caption: 'Top: The de novo pathway involves the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid
  catalyzed by a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT) generating phosphatidic
  acid. LPAAT exhibits substrate selectivity for linoleoly CoA or docosahexaenoly
  CoA (18:2 or 22:6, respectively) as acyl groups. Phosphatidic acid in a series of
  subsequent steps (not shown) can be converted to lysophosphatidylcholine, which
  lacks its sn-2 linked acyl group and in turn can serve as a substrate for the remodeling
  pathway. Bottom: In phosphatidylcholine (PC) remodeling in lung epithelia, lysophosphatidylcholine
  is reacylated with palmitoyl CoA through actions of a lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase
  (LPCAT) at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone. Unlike LPAATs, LPCATS exhibit
  substrate selectivity for palmitoyl CoA (or oleoyl-CoA, not shown). This reaction
  generates the product, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, the major surface-active
  component of surfactant.'
