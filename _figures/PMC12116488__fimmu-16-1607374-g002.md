caption: Testosterone-AR signaling pathway in HCC immunotherapy. (A)Testosterone binds
  to the androgen receptor (AR) in CD8+ T cells, forming a complex in the cytosol.
  This complex then translocates to the nucleus, where it upregulates the expression
  of USP18. USP18 inhibits NF-κB activity, reducing IFN-γ production. Additionally,
  testosterone-AR binding promotes T cell exhaustion, impairing T cell-mediated immunotherapy
  in HCC. (B) In regulatory T cells (Tregs), the testosterone-AR interaction stabilizes
  Foxp2, enhancing Treg cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (TME). This
  infiltration suppresses T cell immunotherapy in HCC. (C) In macrophages, the testosterone-AR
  binding increases the production of IL-10 and TGF-β, which promotes the polarization
  of macrophages from the M1 to the M2 phenotype. This shift suppresses cytotoxic
  T cell function, compromising the efficacy of immunotherapy in HCC. (D) In HCC cells,
  testosterone-AR binding upregulates the transcription of EZH2, resulting in increased
  levels of H3K27me3. This epigenetic modification silences Wnt signaling inhibitors,
  thereby activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which promotes cancer cell proliferation
  and tumor progression. Additionally, AR interacts with mTORC1, which phosphorylates
  AR at S96 in response to nutrient and mitogenic stimuli. This phosphorylation enhances
  AR stability, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity, further promoting
  lipogenesis, hepatocyte proliferation, and hepatocarcinogenesis
