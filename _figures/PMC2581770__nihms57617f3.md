caption: TNFR and LTβR signaling pathways for NFκB activation. Signaling through TNFR
  activates the canonical RelA NFκB pathway, which involves the α, β and γ (NEMO)
  subunits of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which leads to proteosomal degradation
  of IκB, releasing RelA/p50 dimer from its cytoplasmic constraint, locate to the
  nucleus and binding κB transcriptional target sequences. LTβR ligation activates
  the serine kinases NIK and IKKα (also a part of the canonical pathway). The phosphorylation
  and ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of p100 results in the processing
  of the precursor to the p52 subunit and accumulation of p52-RelB heterodimers to
  the nucleus. Signaling through the LTβR also leads to the activation of the classical
  NF-κB pathway. TNFR signaling rapidly activates a large number of proinflammatory
  genes, whereas LTβR activation of RelB takes several hours but sustained expression
  in the nucleus leads to different sets of activated genes involved in homeostasis,
  such as the chemokine, CCL21.
