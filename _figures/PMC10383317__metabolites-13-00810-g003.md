caption: The leptin-melanocortin pathway and its interactions with the NPY–AgRP neuroendocrine
  system. A huge population of neurons in the arcuate nucleus produce pro-opiomelanocortin
  (POMC), which is then cleaved into melanocortins by PCSK1, CPE, and SRC-1 upon leptin
  and its receptor (LEPR) binding. SH2B1 is a crucial adaptor protein involved in
  the leptin-LEPR pathway. The various MSH isoforms bind MC4Rs, which are highly expressed
  by MC4 neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, resulting in
  multiple gene expressions that promote satiety and decreased food intake. The stimulation
  of NYP/AgRP neurons by ghrelin, BDNF, and their own receptors results in a massive
  production of both NPY and AgRP. Their main goal is to antagonize MSH from binding
  with MC4Rs to increase hunger and improve food intake. Leptin also inhibits NPY–AgRP
  neurons and their suppression of POMC neurons via GABAergic systems. POMC = pro-opiomelanocortin;
  PCSK1 = proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1; CPE = carboxypeptidase E;
  SRC-1= steroid receptor coactivator 1; LEPR = leptin receptor; SH2B1 = SH2B adapter
  protein 1; MSH = melanocyte-stimulating hormones; MC4R = melanocortin receptor type
  4; NPY = neuropeptide Y; AgRP = agouti-related protein; GABA = γ-aminobutyric acid.
