caption: Schematic representation of the molecular mechanism by which AloAB suppresses
  HNSCC progression via inhibition of the STAT3/SLC7A11 signaling. AloAB treatment
  downregulated STAT3 expression, which subsequently reduced the expression of its
  downstream target SLC7A11. Under normal conditions, STAT3 promoted SLC7A11 expression,
  which maintained redox homeostasis by upregulating antioxidant enzymes such as SOD,
  CAT, GSH, GPx, and GPX4, and prevented ferroptosis by lowering MDA, ACSL4, lipid
  peroxidation (LPO), and intracellular iron levels. In addition, SLC7A11 facilitated
  epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing the expression of N-cadherin
  and Vimentin and suppressing E-cadherin. These molecular events collectively contributed
  to enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion of HNSCC cells. AloAB inhibited
  this pathway, thereby inducing oxidative stress and ferroptosis, reversing EMT,
  and ultimately suppressing tumor progression
