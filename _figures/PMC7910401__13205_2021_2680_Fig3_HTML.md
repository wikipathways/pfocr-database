  CRISPR-RNA (tracrRNA). The crRNA and tracrRNA forms a complex and acts as a guide
  RNA for the Cas9 enzyme. b Cas9 is a dual RNA-guided DNA endonuclease enzyme in
  Streptococcus pyrogenes. There are two nuclease domains, RuvC (which cleaves the
  non-target DNA strand) and HNH nuclease domain (that cleaves the target strand of
  DNA). Target DNA must contain a PAM-motif which is recognized by PAM-interacting
  domain (PI) of Cas9. Cas9 also have a recognition lobe (REC). Both REC and Nuclease
  lobe folds to give a positive charge that can accommodate the negative charged sgRNA:target
  DNA heteroduplex. c CRISPR/Cas9 induces double-stranded breaks which can be repaired
  either by the non-homologous end-joining DNA repair pathway (NHEJ) or the homology-directed
  repair (HDR) pathway. In NHEJ process, the two broken ends of DNA are ligated without
  a template donor which causes insertion and deletion (indel) mutations. This repair
  process is error-prone and can result in frameshift or loss-of-function and finally
  gene disruption. In case of HDR, it requires almost identical DNA template to repair
  the breaks that result in to precise insertion or edition ultimately leading to
  full correction of the DNA cleavage. d RNA targeting by CRISPR–FnCas9. Cas9 from
  Francisella novicida (Fn) can target and degrade mRNA. FnCas9 forms a complex with
  its tracrRNA and a novel and small CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (termed a scaRNA) instead
  of the crRNA. The exact mechanism is not very clear yet
