caption: The E. coli chemotaxis system and its control of motility. Extracellular
  ligands (circles) are detected by transmembrane chemoreceptors (MCPs; red) connected
  to a cytoplasmic kinase (CheA; blue) via a linker (CheW; green). A basal rate of
  autophosphorylation generates CheA∼P, which transfers its phosphate to two response
  regulators (CheB and CheY). CheY∼P binds to the flagellar motor, reversing its default
  counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation to clockwise (CW). CCW states promote runs, while
  CW states promote tumbles. The phosphatase CheZ dephosphorylates CheY∼P, terminating
  the tumble response. In the absence of chemoeffector gradients, the cells swim in
  a random walk of runs and tumbles. Chemoattractant binding represses CheA kinase
  activity, decreasing tumbling probability and extending runs and allowing cells
  to move up an attractant gradient. CheB∼P governs the adaptation response that returns
  the MCPs to their presignaling state by removing methyl groups added to the MCPs
  by the methyltransferase CheR, so that the MCPs remain responsive to changes in
  the chemoeffector concentration. MCP methylation controls their kinase on-off states.
