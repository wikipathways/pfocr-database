caption: 'Illustration of kinetic proofreading steps. (A) Forms of LCK. LCK can exist
  as coreceptor-bound form or free form. The yellow circle represents the phosphorylated
  tyrosine residues. (B) oreceptor scanning model. After the TCR is engaged with pMHC,
  the TCR scans through coreceptors (CD4 or CD8) to find a coreceptor that is bound
  to active LCK. Engagement with an LCK-bound coreceptor may promote TCR sensitivity
  toward the weak ligand stimulation. The time involved to search for a LCK-bound
  coreceptor may function as a kinetic proofreading step. (C) Two unique features
  of LAT. Recent studies have revealed two unique features of LAT: 1) the PIPRSP motif
  in LAT can bind to SH3 domain of LCK (a); 2) LAT Y132 is a very poor substrate for
  ZAP-70 (b), because its preceding residue is a glycine. In contrast, other three
  tyrosine residues (Y171, Y191, Y226) are good ZAP-70 substrates because they all
  have acidic amino acid at the -1 positions. (D) Coreceptor-bound Lck has dual functions.
  LCK functions as both a kinase and a scaffold protein. As a kinase, LCK phosphorylates
  tyrosine residues of ITAM motifs in CD3 and ζ-chains. Doubly-phosphorylated ITAM
  motifs create the docking site for kinase ZAP-70. The recruited ZAP-70 is further
  phosphorylated by LCK and becomes activated. As a scaffold protein, the LCK SH2
  domain binds to phosphorylated Y319 in ZAP-70 to promote continued LCK activity
  and ZAP-70 activity. LCK can also interact with LAT to actively recruit LAT to the
  pMHC engaged TCR complex. This active recruitment is mediated through LCK SH3 domain
  and LAT PIPRSP motif. The active recruitment of LAT to the proximity of pMHC-engaged
  TCR supports TCR sensitivity toward weak ligand stimulation. (E) LAT Y132 has a
  slow phosphorylation kinetics. On the contrary, Y171, Y191, Y226 in LAT have fast
  phosphorylation rates promoted by ZAP-70. (F) LAT Y132-PLCγ1 activation is a kinetic
  proofreading bottleneck. The adaptor protein LAT has five tyrosine residues, which
  are ZAP-70 substrates. Among these tyrosines, Y127, Y171, Y191 and Y226 all have
  either glutamate or aspartate at the -1 position, providing better binding to ZAP-70
  substrate recognition site through an electrostatic selection mechanism. Therefore,
  these four tyrosine residues have faster phosphorylation kinetics mediated by ZAP-70.
  In contrast, LAT Y132 has a glycine residue at the -1 position, making Y132 a poor
  substrate to ZAP-70. This feature causes Y132 to have very slow phosphorylation
  kinetics relative to the other tyrosine residues in LAT. The slow phosphorylation
  of Y132 ensures that the PLCγ1 pathway is the last to be activated. PLCγ1 activation,
  a key event in T cell signaling events, may represent the last step in the chain
  of kinetic proofreading steps. The yellow circle represents the phosphorylated tyrosine
  residues and the gray circle represents the unphosphorylated tyrosine residues.'
