caption: Schematic of hypothetical signaling pathway linking cytochrome P-450 (CYP)
  4 activation and 20-HETE-induced protection from apoptosis. Our laboratory has previously
  shown 20-HETE to be generated by CYP4 activation in PA endothelial cells (). Our
  laboratory's prior studies have also demonstrated that 20-HETE activates Rac and
  translocates NADPH oxidase, generates ROS in an NADPH oxidase-dependent manner (),
  and activates Akt (). In this study, we hypothesized that 20-HETE protects BPAECs
  from apoptosis through activation of PI3 and Akt and through generation of ROS.
  Our results provide evidence that 20-HETE activates the pathways as they appear
  in the schematic, together resulting in decreased apoptosis through ROS-dependent
  mechanisms.
