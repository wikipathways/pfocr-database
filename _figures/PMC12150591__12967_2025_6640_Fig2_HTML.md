caption: Oxidative stress plays a dual role in CRC development. The limited oxidative
  stress levels are crucial for maintaining normal colonic epithelium by inhibiting
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation.
  Under conditions of APC mutation, elevated oxidative stress can promote cancer stemness
  and EMT, contributing to cancer progression and drug resistance. The figure highlights
  how disruption of the balance between ROS production and antioxidant defenses can
  lead to pathological outcomes. This figure was created specifically for this article
  with BioRender
