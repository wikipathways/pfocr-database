caption: 'Functional analyses of differentially expressed predicted targets of significantly
  altered microRNAs. A: microRNAs miR-18a, miR-19b, miR-27b, and miR-93 were downregulated
  in CA vs. FA treatments (expression of CA divided by expression in FA). B: microRNAs-
  miR-16, miR-21, miR-26b, and miR-27b were downregulated in the CCA vs. FPA (expression
  of CCA divided by expression in FPA treatments). Their differentially expressed
  predicted targets (by mirWalk) are also shown. Signaling networks identified by
  IPA software are based on significant fold changes of the differentially expressed
  microRNAs. The intensity of the node (gene/microRNA) color indicates the degree
  of upregulation (red) or downregulation (green). Nodes are displayed using various
  shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product. Nodes without any
  color were not present in the input dataset but were present as a part of the network.
  Solid lines between genes/microRNAs represent a direct interaction based on experimental
  proven associations. Dashed line represent predicted interactions (indirect interactions)
  based on experimental evidence. Fx, functions and diseases; CP, canonical pathway.
  Symbols describing cell functions are shown in A.'
