caption: VZV IE63 modulates proinflammatory gene transcription by inhibiting the NF-KB
  pathway. The activation of NF-κB signaling is caused by extracellular stimulation.
  These stimuli are recognized by the receptor and delivered to the cell, which ultimately
  leads to the activation of IκB kinase (IKK). IKK phosphorylates inhibitory IκB in
  the cytoplasm and this causes IκB to be degraded by the proteasome and releases
  NF-κB from the inhibitory complex. The released NF-κB protein is then transported
  to the nucleus, where it binds to the target sequence DNA and activates gene transcription.
  After treating HeLa cells with TNFα, the presence of IE63 reduced the expression
  of IL-8, IL-6 and ICAM-1 mediated by TNFα and increased the expression of the IκBα
  gene. IE63 expressed in TNFα-treated HeLa cells reduced the binding of p65 to the
  NF-κB proximal sites on the IL-8 and ICAM-1 promoters and enhanced the recruitment
  of p65 to the IκBα promoter. Treatment of IE63-expressing cells with TNFα inhibits
  the NF-κB pathway, suggesting that VZV may be a strategy to resist VZV-infected
  cells from exogenous proinflammatory cytokine-induced antiviral reactions.
