caption: The different mechanisms of AAS neurotoxicity. In the classical pathway (1),
  the androgen freely passes through the membrane bilayer and binds cytoplasmic Androgen
  Receptor (AR); after translocation to the nucleus bound AR binds to Steroid-Response
  Elements (SRE), stimulating gene transcription. Bound AR also interacts with Src
  Homology Domain 3 (SH3) of the tyrosine kinase c-Src to activate the Mitogen-Activated
  Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway and induces gene transcription via phosphorylation
  of coactivator/receptor complexes (2). The androgen binds to Steroid Hormone Binding
  Globulin (SHBG) activating the SHBG Receptor (SHBGR) and leading to an increase
  in Protein Kinase A (PKA) activity. PKA may influence AR-mediated transcription
  via alteration of phosphorylation status of AR and AR coregulators (3). AAS can
  be also metabolized to estrogens, interacting not only with AR but also with Estrogen
  Receptors (ERα and ERβ) to regulate gene transcription. These interaction can result
  in change in GABAA receptor subunit gene expression. AAS also induce directly changes
  in GABAergic signaling altering gene expression. On the right the non-genomic androgen
  action via changes in intracellular ion concentrations and membrane fluidity is
  represented. Androgen interacts with a membrane associated AR leading to the activation
  of Ltype calcium channels through some type of inhibitory g-protein (GP). This increase
  in intracellular calcium activates Protein Kinase C (PKC), and activates via calmodulin
  (CAM) PKA and MAPK pathway. The modulation of GP may also activate Phospholipase
  C (PLC) resulting in increases in inositol 1,4,5-thriphosphate (IP3) and consequently
  in release of intracellular calcium stores from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and in
  activation of the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway (MEK=MAPK/ERK kinase, ERK=extracellular-signal
  regulated kinase).
