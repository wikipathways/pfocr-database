caption: A simplified model of the Notch signaling transduction cascade in the fruit
  fly. The signal sending cell is in blue and the signal receiving cell is in earthy
  yellow. Upon binding with the Delta/Serrate ligands (Step 1), the Notch receptor
  sequentially processed metalloproteases of the ADAM/TACE family (Step 2) and the
  γ-secretase (Step 3), resulting in the release of NICD from the membrane. In the
  nucleus, NICD assembles with the CSL family protein Su(H) and the co-activator Mam
  to form a complex that regulates target gene expression (Step 4). In cells not receiving
  the activation signal, Notch is not processed and Su(H) interacts with co-repressors
  CtBP and Hairless to suppress the expression of target genes.
