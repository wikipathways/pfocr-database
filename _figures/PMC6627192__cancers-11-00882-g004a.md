caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicates the relation between genes differentially
  expressed between imatinib-na誰ve (IM-n) and imatinib-resistant (IM-r) gastrointestinal
  stromal tumor (GIST) samples. The 352 significant differentially expressed genes
  between IM-r and IM-n GIST samples were used as input for an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA). The depicted IPA networks illustrate and visualize associations between the
  genes. (A) IPA network highlighting cell cycle related, differentially expressed
  genes. (B) IPA network highlighting CDK1, AURKB, and FOXM1 interactions. Green and
  red shading indicates relatively low and high expression in the IM-r samples. See  for
  an extended symbol legend.
