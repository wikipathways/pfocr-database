caption: Proposed integrated model for tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)- and
  plasminogen (Plgn)-mediated modulation of blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability
  during thrombolysis in ischemic stroke. (A) In brain endothelial cells (BECs), tPA
  engages low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related protein 1 (LRP-1) (upregulated
  by the ischemic insult) and activates surface-bound plasminogen,  into plasmin (Pln).
  LRP-1 binding by tPA signals BECs to produce and secrete matrix metalloproteinase
  (MMP)-3 and -9., ,  Plasmin activates these MMPs,, ,  which in turn degrade tight
  junctions (TJs), increasing the paracellular permeability in a process boosted by
  the ischemic damage to TJs. A flux of vascular tPA, plasminogen, plasmin, and activated
  MMPs then flows through the broken TJs and also arrives from within the injured
  brain, localizing on the basolateral BEC membrane, where plasmin continues to form.
  Subsequently, plasmin and the MMPs degrade the basement membrane (BM),, , ,  causing
  loss of BEC adhesion,  and substantial damage to the BBB. In addition, plasmin also
  cleaves monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), an event that enhances the ability
  of MCP-1 to initiate Rho-kinase (ROCK) and ezrin–radixin–moesin (ERM) signaling
  via its receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2). Activation of the ROCK and
  ERM pathways results in modulation of the actin cytoskeleton and BEC retraction,,
  , , ,  further enhancing TJs damage and exposure of the BM to plasmin and MMPs.
  Thus, the MCP-1 pathway initiates a positive feedback loop for additional loss of
  BEC adherence, ultimately leading to cell death and BBB impairment. (B) In astrocytes,
  specific tPA-mediated plasmin generation on the glial surface triggers a dual tPA-plasmin
  signaling events. These include tPA-induced cleavage and shedding of LRP-1, which
  initiates LRP-1-dependent signal, and also plasmin-mediated activation of the ROCK
  pathway, potentially via engagement of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1).,  LRP-1
  signaling and ROCK activation in turn cause modulation of the actin cytoskeleton,
  morphology changes and end-feet retraction in astrocytes,, , , , ,  leading to disruption
  of the BBB. Tissue-type plasminogen activator also activates platelet-derived growth
  factor C (PDGF-CC), which signals to astrocytes via the PDGF receptor-α (PDGFRα)
  to impair the BBB. It is plausible that plasmin, known for its ability to process
  PDGF-CC,,  may possess a similar capacity to initiate PDGF-CC-dependent BBB disruption,
  but this remains to be formally demonstrated.
