caption: 'Various physiological roles of intracellular visfatin (iNAMPT). iNAMPT can
  be located in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria. iNAMPT triggers its effects
  by regulating the levels of the core molecule NAD+. NAD+ levels are maintained through
  the de novo, Preiss–Handler, and salvage pathways. NAD+ is heavily converted to
  NAM by several cellular NAD+ dependent enzymes which include SIRT 1, 2 in the cytoplasm,
  SIRT 1, 6, 7 in the nucleus, and SIRT 3, 4, 5, in the mitochondria and PARPs. NAM
  will be converted to NMN via iNAMPT which is the rate limiting step in the salvage
  pathway. NAD+ can be regenerated from NMN via nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases
  (NMNATs). The ectoenzyme CD38 converts NAD+ to NAM to produce NAADP and cADPR involved
  in intracellular Ca2+signaling. CD38 can be also present on inner/outer mitochondrial
  membrane or inner/outer nuclear envelope. NAD+ can be metabolized extracellularly
  to NMN via the ectoenzyme CD73. NAD+ is a core molecule that plays a role in basic
  cellular metabolism. NAD+ is a key substrate for glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid
  cycle (TCA), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), beta-oxidation yielding NADH. The reduced
  form NADH can be regenerated via electron transport chain (ETC). NAD+ exist also
  in a phosphorylated form NADP+. The reduced form NADPH determines the anti-oxidative
  power of the cell. It is involved in anabolic biosynthesis (fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis),
  detoxification, cellular responses during oxidative stress via glutathione reductase,
  and protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) via NADPH oxidase. NR: nicotinamide
  riboside.'
