caption: 'The role of aberrant localization of glycolytic enzymes on cancer MDR. (A)
  Glycolytic enzymes translocate into the nucleus. Glycolytic enzymes have the capacity
  to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they engage in non-classical
  function: 1) Bind to nuclear proteins (Nanog, EZH2, PCNA) to increase cancer cell
  resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. 2) Protect telomeres from chemotherapy-induced
  degradation. 3) Function as protein kinases, to phosphorylate nuclear proteins to
  enhance oncogene (c-Myc) transcription expression, upregulate the expression of
  drug-resistance proteins (ABCB1, P-gp, MRP1and ABCG2), and promote DSB repairs.
  4) Produce metabolites in the nucleus to mediate post-translational modifications
  of histones, such as H3K79 hypermethylation, followed by the activation of transcription
  factors, leading to the upregulation of MDR proteins. (B) Glycolytic enzymes translocate
  to the cell membrane. Membrane-bound ENO1 interacts with and stabilizes the CMTM6
  protein, thereby activating Wnt signaling and inducing cisplatin resistance. Activated
  EGFR facilitates the acetylation of PFKP at K395 by KAT5, leading to its translocation
  to the cell membrane. Subsequently, PFKP undergoes phosphorylation at Y64 by EGFR.
  The phosphorylated PFKP then binds to and recruits p85α to activate PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. (C) Glycolytic enzymes translocate to mitochondria. HK2 can bind to mitochondrial
  outer membrane-localized VDACs, facilitating the rapid use of ATP newly synthesized
  in mitochondria for the phosphorylation of glucose. Moreover, HK competitively disrupts
  the association of BCL-2 family proteins with VDACs, which controls mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization and protects tumor cells from apoptosis and chemotherapy.
  ERK phosphorylates PGK1 and facilitates PGK1 translocating to mitochondria, where
  PGK1 phosphorylates PDHK1 at T338 to reprogramming glycolysis metabolism. PKM2 has
  been found to translocate into mitochondria under oxidative stress, where PKM2 interacts
  with and phosphorylates BCL-2 at T69, preventing BCL-2 degradation and cell apoptosis.
