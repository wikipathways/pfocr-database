caption: Immune response activation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The presence of virus
  particles in the cell, such as the viral RNA, is recognized by the Toll-Like and
  RIG-I/MAD5 pathway and will initiate signaling cascades resulting in the translocation
  of NF-kb and IRF3/7 into the nucleus and the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  that are responsible for recruiting immune cells to the site of infection (left).
