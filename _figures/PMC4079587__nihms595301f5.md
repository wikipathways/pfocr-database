caption: Interaction of kisspeptin, estrogen and BMP-4 in regulation of GnRH production
  by GT1-7 cells. Kisspeptin stimulates GnRH production via GPR54 and its downstream
  signaling of the ERK pathway in GT1-7 cells. Estrogen upregulates GPR54 expression,
  while kisspeptin increases the expression levels of ERα/β, suggesting that the actions
  of estrogen and kisspeptin are mutually enhanced. Kisspeptin effects on GnRH induction
  were suppressed by BMP-4, by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation and GPR54 expression.
  On the other hand, by upregulating inhibitory Smads6/7, kisspeptin suppressed Smad1/5/8
  phosphorylation and Id-1 expression induced by BMP-4 through the ALK-3/BMPRII receptor.
  In GT1-7 neuron cells, the axis of kisspeptin-induced GnRH production is augmented
  by an interaction between ERα/β and GPR54 and it is also negatively controlled by
  BMP-4.
