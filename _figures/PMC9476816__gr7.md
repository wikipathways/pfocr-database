caption: Speculated possible regulatory pathway of ginsenosides biosynthesis by PIN/PILS
  auxin transporters. Auxin transporter PIN/PILS family proteins, mainly locating
  on plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum membrane, maintain the distribution
  and homeostasis of auxin. PP2A, a heterotrimeric enzyme that binds the N-terminal
  region of HMGR, is involved in auxin, abscisic acid and ethylene signaling and emerges
  as a positive and negative multilevel regulator of plant HMGR. Meanwhile, PRL1 functions
  as a regulator of stress, and hormone response. From the above, it is assumed that
  phytohormone and stress response contribute to regulate the HMGR activity and subsequent
  ginsenoside production.
