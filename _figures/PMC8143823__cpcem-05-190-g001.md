caption: (A) Mechanism of anti-PD-L1, atezolizumab, on T-cell response to cancer cell.
  PD-L1 is expressed on cancer cells and inhibits T-cell activation when binding to
  the PD-1 receptor on T-cell surface. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment with atezolizumab
  leads to the inhibition of this inhibitory pathway and subsequent enhanced T-cell
  activity against tumor cells. (B) Mechanism of action of anti-PD-L1 agent on immune
  tolerance in the pancreas. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction between effector T cells and pancreatic
  insulin-secreting β cells inhibits T-cell activation against the pancreas. The anti-PD-L1
  agent, atezolizumab, blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, leading to activation of
  self-reactive T cells and destruction of the pancreatic islet cells of Langerhans.
  This results in immunotherapy-induced autoimmune diabetes. Figures created with
  BioRender.com (Toronto, ON, Canada).MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TCR,
  T-cell receptor; PD-L1, programmed death – ligand 1; PD-1, programmed death – 1.
