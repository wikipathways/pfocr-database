caption: Proposed mechanism of gene regulation in response to extracellular and intracellular
  dsRNA stimulation. TLR3-mediated extracellular dsRNA signaling pathway activates
  IFNB and inflammatory genes through NF-kB RELA but the subsequent activation of
  RELA by secondary signals is inhibited by RELB (left panel). On the other hand,
  secondary signals induced by the activation of NF-kB RELA in the intracellular dsRNA
  signaling pathway are not inhibited by RELB resulting in a positive feedback loop
  of RELA activation leading to powerful activation of IFNB and inflammatory genes
  (right panel).
