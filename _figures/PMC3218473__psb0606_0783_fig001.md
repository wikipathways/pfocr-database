caption: 'Position and involvement of GSH in the signaling web in plants. GSH has
  been known to participate in biotic stress tolerance by NPR1-dependent SA-mediated
  pathway. Only those signal transduction components relevant to this review has been
  shown. Continuous lines: established signaling pathways; broken lines: proposed
  signaling pathway.'
