caption: Significantly changed metabolites and pathways of Agrobacterium tumefaciens
  in plant tumours. Red circles and green circles represent the up‐regulated and down‐regulated
  reporter metabolites. Red backgrounds and green backgrounds represent the up‐regulated
  and down‐regulated reporter pathways. Metabolic pathways are shown in dotted rounded
  rectangles. A small black arrow represents one reaction, and a large grey arrow
  represents more than three steps connecting two metabolites or between one metabolite
  and one pathway. GLC, l‐glucose; PYR, pyruvate, AKG, α‐ketoglutaric acid; ORN, l‐ornithine;
  ARG, l‐arginine; SAM, S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine; VAL, valine; LEU, leucine; ILE, isoleucine;
  [e], extracellular compartment
