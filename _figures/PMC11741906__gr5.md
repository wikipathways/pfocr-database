caption: Effect of differentially expressed miRNAs related to cisplatin resistance
  on MAPK signaling pathway. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis
  was used to identify nine differentially expressed miRNAs' putative targets (highlighted
  by different colors). The yellow color indicates the target genes that are targeted
  by one of the miRNAs, the orange color indicates the target genes that are targeted
  by more than one miRNA, and the green color indicates the rest of the pathway genes
  that are not targeted by the studied miRNAs
