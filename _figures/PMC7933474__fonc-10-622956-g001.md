caption: Schematic diagram depicting a proposal model of the complex relationship
  between autophagy and exosomes in the context of pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma
  (PDAC) and its environment. The autophagy pathway and exosomes biogenesis are suggested
  to be highly interconnected. Both pathways share several structures of the endo-lysosomal
  system. In the context of PDAC and its tumor microenvironment, autophagy and exosomal
  processes are mutually influenced and condition tumor behavior responding to the
  pressure of the immune system. (1) – violet arrows - Cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs) foster proliferation and chemoresistance. Exosomes bearing miR-106b are released
  by gemcitabine-treated CAFs increasing proliferation and survival of PDAC cell lines.
  The effector response is traduced in cancer cells as induction of chemoresistance-inducing
  factors, Snail, and miR-146a, and TP53INP1. (2) – light blue arrows - Bone marrow
  mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosomes contain miR-126-3p and miR-1231, which
  in turn inhibit proliferation, invasion and metastasis and promotes apoptosis by
  down-regulation of disintegrin and metalloproteinase-9 (ADAM9). (3) – brown arrows
  - Vesicles from tumor-associated stroma cells (TASC) are enriched in miR-145. This
  molecule possesses tumor suppressor action on target cells by inducing apoptosis.
  (4) – green arrows - NK-derived exosomes mediate tumor cells suppression by two
  mechanisms. One of them is Fas-FasL interaction between exosomes and tumoral cells.
  The other mechanism is mediated by excessive uptake by cancer cells of exosomes
  carrying miR-3607-3p which possess tumor suppressive qualities and decrease IL-26
  expression. (5) – purple arrows – PDAC tumor exosomes (TEXs) bearing c-Met and PD-L1
  enhance carcinogenesis. c-Met provides proliferation, migration, and an anti-apoptotic
  status in recipient cancer cells. PD-L1 guarantees evasion of immune control. (6)
  – black arrow – TEXs from highly invasive cells carry ZIP4, miR-125b-5p and miR-5703
  towards weakly invasive cancer cells enhancing the aggressiveness of these last
  and promoting an increased invasive potential. (7) – orange arrows – In response
  to gemcitabine treatment, chemoresistant PDAC cancer cells are capable of transferring
  their resistance properties to neighboring cells through exosomes. They release
  TEXs bearing miR-155 and induce upregulation of SOD2 and CAT meanwhile DCK, a gene
  related to gemcitabine metabolism, is downregulated. Furthermore, exosomes from
  different cell types of tumor microenvironment condition autophagy response and
  affect PDAC behavior. EE, Early endosomes; LE/MVB, Late Endosomes/Multivesicular
