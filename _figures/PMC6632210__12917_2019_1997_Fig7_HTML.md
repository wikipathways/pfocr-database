caption: Schematic diagram of LPS-mediated platelet activation and TLR4 expression
  in canine platelets. ADP activation via P2Y1 or P2Y12 receptor upregulates surface
  TLR4 expression. TLR4 trafficking to cell membrane from granules may be mediated
  by alpha-granule secretion. LPS binding protein (LBP) presents LPS to CD14 forming
  a heterodimeric complex with TLR4 and myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2).
  Downstream signaling pathway of TLR4 leads to α-granule secretion, which is amplified
  by ADP and thromboxane A2 (TxA2). Activation of G-protein coupled receptors, P2Y1/P2Y12
  and thromboxane receptor (TP), leads to phospholipase C (PLC) activation and, subsequently,
  1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) for intracellular calcium release
  and alpha-granule secretion. LPS acts synergistically with ADP to increase generation
  of TxA2, serving a positive feedback mediator. TLR4 and ADP signaling activates
  cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which converts arachidonic acid (AA) to TxA2, likely by
  the Akt/p38 MAPK pathway
