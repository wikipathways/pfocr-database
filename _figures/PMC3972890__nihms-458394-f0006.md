caption: A schematic model for IL-22, CXCL12, and SOCS3 regulation of KC proliferation
  is shown. JAK/STAT3 pathway is activated by IL-22 and results in modest upregulation
  of SOCS3 that is insufficient to downregulate keratinocyte proliferation (A). SOCS3
  expression, however, is synergistically upregulated in the presence of IL-22, CXCR4,
  and CXCL12 (B), resulting in the abrogation of STAT3 signaling and marked inhibition
  of keratinocyte proliferation.
