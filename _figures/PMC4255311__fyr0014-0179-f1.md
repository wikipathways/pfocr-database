caption: Simplified overview of selected aspects of yeast lipid metabolism. Pathways
  and metabolites of the basic lipid homeostasis that are relevant to cell death have
  been depicted, including the synthesis of sphingolipids, phospholipids, and neutral
  lipids. The central metabolite phosphatidic acid (PA), which originates from glycerol-3-phosphate
  and free fatty acids (FFA), activated by condensation with coenzyme A (CoA), is
  used to synthesize diacylglycerol (DAG) and subsequently triacylglycerol (TAG),
  neutral lipids that can be stored in lipid droplets together with sterol esters
  (SE) generated from sterols (e.g. ergosterol). PA also serves as precursor for the
  generation of phospholipids via the cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG)
  pathway, leading to the formation of phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI), or cardiolipin. Cardiolipin
  is synthesized via phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP), which is dephosphorylated
  to generate phosphatidylglycerol (PG). Alternatively, the Kennedy pathway can supply
  PE and PC from DAG. The first step of sphingolipid synthesis requires acyl-CoA (mostly
  palmitoyl-CoA), leading to the long-chain sphingoid bases (LCB), which are used
  to build ceramides. In the following, PI is utilized to generate complex sphingolipids
  from ceramides. Note that for reasons of simplicity, cofactors such as ATP and NADH
  have been omitted.
