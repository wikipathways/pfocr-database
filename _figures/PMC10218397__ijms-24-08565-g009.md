caption: Mechanism of TASE and thymol supplementation in neuronal differentiation
  and outgrowth effect. TASE and thymol supplementation upregulate the brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which follows the TrkB-mediated downstream signaling
  pathway. Mitogen-activated protein kinase protein (MAPK) is phosphorylated, leading
  to upregulation of cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) family.
  CREB family of transcription factors upregulates microtubule-associated protein
  (MAP2) synthesis. Meanwhile, thymol also upregulates N-acetylglucosamine kinase,
  which is an enzyme of hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) which eventually upregulates
  the synthesis of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNac). Addition of O-GlcNac
  using O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) promotes stabilization of MAP2-regulated microtubule
  assembly. Moreover, MAP2 proteins with modified serine or threonine residues close
  to phosphorylation sites might be prone to O-GlcNac modification. Cross-linking
  of microtubules is significantly upregulated, along with NAGK-mediated cargo transport
  mechanism on the microtubule, finally leading to rapid elongation of dendrites and
  axons
