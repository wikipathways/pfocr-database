caption: Proposed molecular mechanisms of PAX3 in glioma pathogenesis and progression.
  In glioma cells, the activation of the canonical Wnt pathway involves the binding
  of Wnt to the receptors of the frizzled (FZD) and to the low density lipoprotein-receptor-related
  protein (LRP) on the cellular membrane, resulting in a trimer complex formation
  that enters the cytoplasm. This complex promotes the phosphorylation and subsequent
  activation of the protein disheveled (DVL), leading to the inhibition of glycogen
  synthase kinase (GSK-3β). As a result, phosphorylated β-catenin escapes from degradation
  and translocates into the nucleus, where it can bind to T-cell transcription factor
  (TCF), leading to the abnormal transcription of target genes implicated in cell
  proliferation, apoptosis and migration, including CyclinD1, vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7).Regarding the non-canonical
  Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt binds to FZD and activates the small GTPases, Rho and
  Rac, as well as JNK, resulting in cytoskeleton alterations and activation of transcription
  factors belonging to activator protein-1 (AP-1) family, which further regulate the
  expression of cell proliferation and apoptosis-associated genes. PAX3 has been shown
  to directly interact with β-catenin, and is also associated with reduction of JNK
  phosphorylation, as well as altered expression of VEGF, Myc, MMP7 and CyclinD1,
  implying its implication in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathway. In respect
  of brain glioma stem cells (BGSCs), PAX3 promotes their “dedifferentiation”, proliferation
  and invasivness by suppressing GFAP and p53 gene expression.
