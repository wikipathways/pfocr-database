caption: Schematic representation of the proposed effect of COX-2 inhibition on the
  production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites in epithelial cells and its association
  with disparate effects of airway contractility in wild-type and Cav-1 KO airways.
  (A) In wild-type airways, relatively low levels of COX-2 and 5-LO are expressed
  in the epithelium (pink cells) due to Cav-1-associated protein turnover. This is
  likely because of direct interaction of COX-2 with Cav-1; however, whether 5-LO
  interaction with Cav-1 is necessary is unknown (question mark). In wild-type tissues
  (in the absence of indomethacin; INDO), relatively modest basal levels of COX-2
  and 5-LO metabolites are released by the epithelium (thin red and green arrows respectively),
  and act equally on underlying airway smooth muscle. Airway smooth muscle is also
  likely to produce small amounts of prostanoids (green hatched line) and leukotrienes
  (red hatched line) that have autocrine effects. Inhibition of the COX-2 pathway
  with indomethacin suppresses the generation of prostaglandins, thereby promoting
  shunting of AA metabolites through the 5-LO arm of the cascade (hatched green arrow);
  however, this imbalance is not sufficient to affect methacholine (MCh)-induced contraction
  of airway smooth muscle (blue cells, blue ring below represents an intact airway).
  (B) For Cav-1 KO airways, the lack of caveolin-1 leads to selective accumulation
  (and increased activity) of both COX-2 and 5-LO in airway epithelial cells, and
  increases basal capacity to generate prostanoids and leukotrienes (thick red and
  green arrows respectively); however, in the absence of indomethacin, these metabolites
  act equally on underlying airway smooth muscle, thus no difference in airway response
  from wild-type tissues is evident. As in wild-type tissue, airway smooth muscle
  also produces small amounts of prostanoids (green hatched line) and leukotrienes
  (red hatched line), but unlike Cav-1 KO epithelium COX-2 and 5-LO in smooth muscle
  cells is not significantly elevated. In contrast to basal conditions, inhibition
  of the COX-2 pathway with indomethacin leads to significant unbalancing of AA metabolite
  production through shunting via the 5-LO branch of the cascade (thick, hatched green
  arrow). Due to the elevated levels of COX-2 and 5-LO, with indomethacin treatment
  sufficient levels of leukotrienes are synthesized and released to promote hypercontractility
  of the underlying airway smooth muscle (blue), an effect that is evident by excessive
  contraction in response to methacholine (depicted with blue ring at the bottom of
  the panel).
