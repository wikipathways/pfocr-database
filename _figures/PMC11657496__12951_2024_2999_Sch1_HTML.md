caption: Scheme illustration of the ZnO–Au@mSiO2 NPs for cancer immunotherapy. Mesoporous
  silica-encapsulated gold (Au@mSiO2) nanoparticles were used as carriers for Zn2+-dependent
  DNAzyme, which can act to degrade PD-L1, only after being activated by Zn2+. ZnO,
  as a double activator for DNAzyme and cGAS-STING, was used as a “caretaker” to block
  off the pore of the SiO2 for stability and safety (ZnO–Au@mSiO2). The nanoparticles
  exposed to X-ray could enhance oxidative stress and immunogenic cell death (ICD),
  which would cause tumor cell apoptosis and activate the tumor immune response; the
  released Zn2+ in acidic microenvironment activate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway
  for further amplifying the immune response, and activate DNAzyme for regulating
  PD-1/PD-L1 immunosuppression
