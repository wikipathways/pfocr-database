caption: Oncogenic MYC upregulates the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis,
  such as ATF4, which may result in proteotoxicity. PERK‐eIF2α‐ATF4 pathway is often
  activated upon this intrinsic stress, which subsequently induces cytoprotective
  autophagy. Alternatively, PERK may activate autophagy by phosphorylating NRF2. Meanwhile,
  GCN2‐eIF2α‐ATF4 axis can be activated by c‐Myc‐induced excess tRNAs, resulting in
  metabolic reprogramming and enhanced protein synthesis. In addition, MYC mediates
  transcriptional repression on NDRG1 and DDIT3, which leads to enhanced cytoprotective
  autophagy and suppressed apoptosis, respectively. Red arrows indicate direct transcriptional
  regulation of PERK arm by MYC.
