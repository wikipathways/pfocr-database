caption: Model of the signal pathways by which brassinosteroids (BRs) crosstalk with
  other SMCs in the growth, development, and stress response of plants. In terms of
  interaction with nitric oxide (NO), BRs induce NO generation through nitrate reductase
  (NR) and NO synthase (NOS) pathways. As the main synthesis pathway, NITRATE REDUCTASE1
  (NIA1) is responsible for BR-induced NO through the NR pathway. The crosstalk between
  BRs and NO regulates the antioxidant system, the photosynthesis system, osmotic
  adjustment, and the ion channel. Additionally, BRs are involved in the biosynthesis
  of ethylene through S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
  acid (ACC) and enhance the activity of key enzymes ACC oxidases (ACO) and ACC synthases
  (ACS) in the synthesis pathway to promote ethylene production. The crosstalk between
  BRs and ethylene is involved in the antioxidant system and the photosynthesis system
  and upregulates the expression of disease-related genes. In terms of hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2), BR signaling through BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) triggers the production
  of H2O2 in the NADPH-dependent pathway, and H2O2 regulates the BR activity downstream
  of BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2). The crosstalk between BRs and H2O2 regulates
  the antioxidant system, the photosynthesis system, and osmotic adjustment. Furthermore,
  ethylene modulates BR-mediated stomatal closure via inducing H2O2. Hydrogen sulfide
  (H2S) further functions as the downstream of H2O2. Meanwhile, BRs downregulate the
  sphingolipid long-chain base (LCB) total content and the expression levels of sphingolipid-related
  genes {the serine palmitoyltransferase I (OeSPT); sphingosine kinase (OeSPHK); glucosylceramidase
  (OeGlcCerase)}.
