caption: 'Function and Regulatory Mechanisms of the TLR Signaling Pathway in Lung
  Cancer (By figdraw). According to their subcellular localization, Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) are mainly divided into two categories: membrane surface TLRs (including
  TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, and TLR10) and endosomal TLRs (including TLR3, TLR7,
  TLR8, and TLR9). Upon activation, TLRs transmit signals through two core pathways.
  The first is the MyD88-dependent pathway, utilized by TLR2/1, TLR2/6, TLR4, and
  TLR7/8. This pathway involves the adaptor protein MyD88, which activates nuclear
  factor κB (NF-κB) and drives the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The second
  is the TRIF-dependent pathway, used by TLR3 and TLR4. It involves the adaptor protein
  TRIF, which activates interferon regulatory factors IRF3/7, leading to the production
  of type I interferons (IFN-α/β). MicroRNA-574-5p derived from extracellular vesicles
  regulates the biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2 by activating TLR7/8, thereby influencing
  intercellular communication in lung cancer. This highlights the intricate role of
  TLR signaling in modulating the tumor microenvironment and cancer progression. Therapeutic
  strategies targeting the TLR pathway show significant potential. TLR agonists such
  as the TLR2/1 agonist WYJ-2 can inhibit NSCLC proliferation by inducing pyroptosis.
  Additionally, high-efficiency nanoparticle formulations of the TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod,
  such as poly (2-oxazoline) carriers, significantly prolong survival and activate
  CD8+ T cell immune responses in chemotherapy-resistant lung adenocarcinoma models.
  TLR9 agonists, such as CpG-ODN delivered via nanoparticles, effectively promote
  tumor regression and enhance immune responses'
