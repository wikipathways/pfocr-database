caption: The development of the auditory sense organ. (A) The cochlear duct begins
  as an expansion of the ventral-most portion of the otocyst. Initial specifications
  of prosensory domain most likely begin as soon as the cochlear duct is recognizable.
  The prosensory domain is further restricted to a group of cells on the floor of
  the cochlea duct (shown with bracket) by the action of Sox2, Notch and Hedgehog
  (HH) signaling, and Lmx1a. Diagrams for the whole-mount cochlea (top) and the cross-section
  of the cochlea at this stage highlight the expression of Sox2 (yellow) in the prosensory
  domain. (B) The sensory precursor cells become postmitotic under the control of
  several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, including p27. Cell cycle exit is initiated
  in the cells in the apical region and progresses toward the basal region, coinciding
  with the gradient of p27 onset in the cochlea. The arrow indicates the direction
  of onset of p27 and the gradient of cell cycle withdrawal along the longitudinal
  axis of the cochlear duct. (C) The first sign of differentiation within the postmitotic
  prosensory domain is the expression of the transcription factor Math1, which starts
  in the midbasal region and progresses toward both the apex and the base of the cochlea.
  There is also a second gradient along the medial-lateral axis of the cochlea from
  the inner to outer hair cells. The arrow indicates the longitudinal gradient of
  Math1 onset and hair cell differentiation. (D) Inductive and inhibitory signaling
  creates the correct cellular patterning of the organ of Corti. Much of this appears
  to be mediated by Notch signaling, which inhibits hair cell neighbors from adopting
  the same fate. Furthermore, the initial differentiation of the inner hair cells
  appears to direct the differentiation of other cells types, such as the Pillar cells
  (blue) through FGF8 and Hey2 in a Notch-independent manner. Sprouty 2 (SPY2) further
  restricts the differentiation of pillar cells. (E) During terminal differentiation
  and maturation, all cells in the organ of Corti coordinate their cellular morphologies
  under the regulation of the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway, which,
  in part, involves the asymmetric distribution of a core set of proteins (some examples
  are shown). The result of PCP signaling in the ear can be most clearly observed
  by the uniform orientation of the ‘V’-shaped hair bundles on the apical surfaces
  of hair cells. In mice, late embryonic and early postnatal hair cell and supporting
  cell types all undergo morphological and maturational changes that ultimately result
  in a highly sensitive sensory structure that is functional by two weeks after birth.
