caption: Signal transduction pathways from the cell membrane to the nucleus discussed
  in this article. Solid lines with arrows indicate positive effects; broken lines
  indicate inhibitory effects. Tsp, thrombospondin; HA, hyaluronan; 1, TGF-beta receptor
  (TbetaR) I; 2, TbetaR II; PI3K, Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; SARA, Smad anchor
  for receptor activation; Dab2, disabled-2; TAK, TGF-beta-activated kinase; FAK,
  focal adhesion kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; UBQ, ubiquitin; Smad3-cP, Smad3 phosphorylated
  on the C-terminus; Smad3-LP-cP, Smad3 phosphorylated at the linker region and at
  the C-terminus; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; ECM, extracellular matrix.
  Three inhibitory pathways, involving (respectively) bone morphogenetic protein-7,
  hepatocyte growth factor and the nuclear receptor-associated hormones, are not shown
  because they act at multiple sites in the Smad2/Smad3-mediated pathway. The inclusion
  of arrows depicting both enhancing and inhibiting effects for Smad linker region
  phosphorylation indicate that the implications of these phosphorylation events remain
  poorly defined.
