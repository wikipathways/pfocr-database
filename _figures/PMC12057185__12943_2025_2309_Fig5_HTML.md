caption: 'The role of S-palmitoylation within the TME. S-palmitoylation influences
  several critical cellular processes across different cell types in the TME. 1.Hippo
  Pathway: Upon dephosphorylation, Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional
  coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) translocate into the nucleus, where they
  selectively interact with S-palmitoylated TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD)
  proteins. This YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional complex activates oncogenic gene expression,
  promoting tumor cell proliferation, survival, and therapeutic resistance. 2. Autophagy:
  S-palmitoylation controls multiple steps of the autophagy cascade. Under nutrient
  deprivation or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition, AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates unc- 51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) at Ser317 and
  Ser777, enhancing ULK1 activation. Simultaneously, Zinc finger DHHC-type containing
  13 (ZDHHC13)-mediated S-palmitoylation facilitates ULK1 recruitment to autophagosome
  formation sites, amplifying its ability to phosphorylate autophagy-related 14-like
  protein (ATG14L) in the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 K) complex.
  Additionally, ZDHHC5-mediated Beclin 1S-palmitoylation enhances its interaction
  with ATG14L and vacuolar protein sorting 15 (VPS15), synergistically activating
  PI3 K lipid kinase activity to initiate autophagosome formation. ZDHHC17 primes
  AMPK activation, forming a feedforward loop essential for sustained autophagic flux.
  During autophagosome elongation, ZDHHC17-mediated ATG16L1S-palmitoylation stabilizes
  its interactions with WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 2B (WIPI2B)
  and Rab33B, ensuring efficient LC3 lipidation (LC3-II) and autophagosome maturation.
  Finally, the selective autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1 is palmitoylated by ZDHHC19,
  enhancing its LC3-II affinity, thereby facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated
  cargo via lysosomal fusion. 3. Pyroptosis: S-palmitoylation of gasdermin D (GSDMD)
  at cysteine 191 (C191), catalyzed by ZDHHC5, ZDHHC7, and ZDHHC9, facilitates its
  membrane localization and pore formation in response to NLR family pyrin domain
  containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. While gasdermin D N-terminal domain
  (GSDMD-N) was previously thought to require cleavage for activation, new evidence
  suggests that S-palmitoylation alone can prime uncleaved GSDMD for membrane pore
  formation, establishing a novel checkpoint for pyroptosis regulation. 4. Energy
  Metabolism Regulation: ZDHHC9-mediated S-palmitoylation of lactate dehydrogenase
  A (LDHA) enhances its catalytic activity, driving aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect),
  increasing lactate secretion, and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation
  by shifting metabolism away from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).
  This metabolic adaptation supports tumor growth, invasion, and acidifies the TME.
  Additionally, S-palmitoylation of malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) at C138 enhances
  its enzymatic activity, boosting ATP production and facilitating tumor cell proliferation
  under metabolic stress conditions. 5. Immune Checkpoint: S-palmitoylation of programmed
  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) prevents its monoubiquitination, protecting it from lysosomal
  degradation via the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway.
  This stabilization prolongs PD-L1 surface expression, enabling persistent T-cell
  suppression by engaging programmed death- 1 (PD- 1) on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
  (TILs). Similarly, S-palmitoylation of PD- 1 prevents its degradation, stabilizing
  PD- 1 inhibitory signaling, which enhances mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  activation, ultimately promoting tumor survival, proliferation, and immune evasion.
  6. cGAS-STING Pathway: S-palmitoylation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) inhibits
  DNA binding, leading to reduced 2′3''-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthesis and weakening
  stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation, thereby suppressing innate immune
  responses. However, S-palmitoylation of STING promotes its Golgi aggregation, a
  prerequisite for TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) activation and interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, ultimately enhancing the type I interferon (IFN-I)
  response. AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG14L: Autophagy-related 14-like
