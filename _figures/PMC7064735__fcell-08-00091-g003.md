caption: 'Molecular mechanisms underlying PM2.5-induced defective airway epithelial
  host defense functions. (A) Major host defense functions of normal and PM2.5-exposured
  airway epithelia. Normal airway epithelia are protected from pathogens mainly by
  mucociliary clearance, the barrier functions of the epithelium, and the secretion
  of a number of AMPs with antimicrobial activities. However, PM2.5 exposure disrupts
  these host defense functions, resulting in more pathogens in the airways. (B) Underlying
  molecular mechanisms: ① PM2.5 → EGFR ↑→ MUC5AC ↑→ Mucus ↑→ Mucociliary clearance
  ↓: PM2.5 up-regulates the expression of MUC5AC (one of the predominant mucins produced
  by the airway epithelium) by activating EGFR pathway, resulting in decreased mucociliary
  clearance. ② PM2.5 → IL-6 ↑→ AKT ↑→ NF-κB ↑→ ICAM-1 ↑→ Pathogen adhesion ↑: PM2.5
  activates AKT/NF-κB pathway through IL-6 paracrine signaling, which then up-regulates
  the expression of ICAM-1 (an important glycoprotein on the cell surface) in the
  lung to increase the adhesion of pathogens to the airway epithelium. ③ PM2.5 → ROS
  ↑→ ERK-1/2 ↑→ Claudin-1 ↓→ TJs ↓→ Epithelial barrier ↓: PM2.5 down-regulates the
  expression of claudin-1 (a major structural protein of TJs) via generating ROS and
  activating ERK1/2 pathway, resulting in more pathogens to translocate across the
  disrupted epithelial barrier. ④ PM2.5 →β-defensin ↓→ AMPs ↓→ Antimicrobial activity
  ↓: PM2.5 inhibits the expression and secretion of β-defensin (one of the major AMPs
  in ASL), which allows more pathogens to survive and exacerbates respiratory infections.'
