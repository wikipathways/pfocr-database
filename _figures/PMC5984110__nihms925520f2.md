caption: a) HRAS-GAL1 and KRAS-GAL3 coupling support downstream RAS oncogenic signaling.
  b) Schematic of predicted effects of anti-Galectin treatments in H- and KRAS cancers.
  Galectin-1 inhibition using OTX008 or other GAL1 inhibitors results in loss of HRAS
  at the lipid ordered/disordered domain borders, and disruption of MAPK mitogenic
  signaling. GAL3 inhibition with modified citrus pectin, GSC-100, or other inhibitors
  blocks MAPK signaling by destabilizing KRAS membrane retention. Some PI3K signal
  output is retained by these treatments. c) Predicted effects of dual inhibition
  of Galectins and mTOR. Rapamycin or rapalog treatment potently reduces mTOR survival
  signaling. Combinatorial pathway inhibition blocks MAPK and PI3K signaling by RAS,
  resulting in an additive anti-tumor effect over either monotherapy.
