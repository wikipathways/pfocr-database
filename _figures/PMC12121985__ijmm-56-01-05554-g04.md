caption: 'Schematic diagram of the signalling pathway in anergic NK cells. In anergic
  NK cells, the EGR2 expression level is elevated, which subsequently triggers an
  increase in DGKα. This change prompts the conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid,
  which subsequently recruits more SHP-1 to the cell membrane. Therefore, DAG availability
  is limited, thereby inhibiting protein kinase Cθ activity and preventing the regulation
  of SHP-1 function. Dephosphorylation of SHP-1 further inhibits the phosphorylation
  of linker for activation of T cells and PLCγ1/2, blocking the initiation of downstream
  signalling. Additionally, DAG deficiency inhibits DAG-mediated activation of the
  Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway and IP3-mediated calcium influx. SHP-1, Src homology
  2 domain-containing phosphatase-1; PLCγ1/2, phospholipase C γ 1/2; NK, natural killer;
  DGKα, diacylglycerol kinase α; DAG, diacylglycerol; SHP-1, Src homology 2 domain-containing
  phosphatase-1; PKCθ: protein kinase C θ; LAT, linker for activation of T cells;
  PLCγ1/2, phospholipase C γ 1/2; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate'
