caption: The pyoverdine signaling pathway. (A) In the absence of ferripyoverdine the
  activities of sigma factors σFpvI and σPvdS are inhibited by the antisigma protein
  FpvR20. (B) Import of ferripyoverdine (Fe-PVD) causes a molecular rearrangement
  of the FpvA receptor protein, triggering a proteolytic cascade that degrades FpvR20.
  σFpvI and σPvdS then become active, stimulating expression of the fpvA gene and
  of pyoverdine (pvd) synthesis genes, respectively. See text and () for more detailed
  information. OM, outer membrane; CM, cytoplasmic membrane.
