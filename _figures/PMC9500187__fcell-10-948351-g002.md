caption: The INK4/ARF cell cycle regulatory network. (A) The p53-MDM2 pathway is controlled
  by the upstream effector protein p14ARF. By establishing a complex with MDM2, p14ARF
  permits p53 to activate its transcriptional targets. MDM2 ubiquitinates p53, which
  mediates proteasomal degradation in normal conditions. However, when MDM2 interacts
  with p14ARF, NoLS of MDM2 is exposed, resulting in MDM2 sequestration in the nucleolus.
  MDM2 sequestration prevents degradation of p53, allowing it to activate its transcriptional
  targets and arrest the cell cycle in the G1 phase. (B) The retinoblastoma pathway
  is regulated by p16INK4a and p15INK4b. E2F is a transcription factor that activates
  genes involved in the transition from G1 to M phase. Rb inhibits this function of
  E2F by establishing a complex with it. Under normal conditions, the cyclin D-CDK4/6
  complex phosphorylates Rb. Phosphorylated Rb doesn't engage with E2F, as a result,
  E2F binds to target genes to activate them. Once expressed, p16INK4a/p15INK4b inhibits
  cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex formation, keeping Rb hypophosphorylated. Hypophosphorylated
  Rb forms a complex with E2F, inhibiting its transcriptional activity.
