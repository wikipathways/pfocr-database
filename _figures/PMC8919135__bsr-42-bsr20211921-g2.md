caption: HTLV-1-infected cells utilize Tax to stimulate both the classical (A) and
  alternative (B) NF-κB pathways. (A) Tax interacts with NEMO to facilitate recruitment
  of the IKK subunits α and β, leading to activation of the IKK complex. Tax can also
  interact with these IKK subunits directly to promote their dimerization. The activated
  IKK complex then phosphorylates IκB, subsequently releasing p50/p65 and permitting
  their translocalization to the nucleus. Tax can also bind to p50/p65 subunits in
  the nucleus to induce dimer formation and recruit co-activators such as CBP/p300.
  (B) The alternative pathway depends on phosphorylation of the IKK complex by NIK.
  Once activated, the IKK complex then phosphorylates p100/RelB, stimulating proteasomal
  processing of p100 to p52. Tax accelerates this process by recruiting IKK subunit
  α to p100, thereby allowing p52/RelB to translocate to the nucleus. Similar to the
  classical pathway, Tax may additionally promote the dimerization and DNA binding
  activity of nuclear p52. (C) Tax-mediated activation of these respective NF-κB pathways
  leads to several downstream cellular effects, including deregulation of the cell
  cycle, stimulation of T-cell proliferation, and increased expression of anti-apoptotic
  proteins, ultimately promoting viral transformation of HTLV-1-infected cells.
