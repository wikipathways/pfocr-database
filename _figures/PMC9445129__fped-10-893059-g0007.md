caption: Schematic working model of proposed novel mechanism of NEC induced by gut
  functional dysbiosis in human premature newborns. (1) Functional metagenomic analysis
  revealed that Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the most discriminatory
  taxa related to NEC dysbiosis, (2) These top-two species are major contributors
  to the KEGG ortholog KO0656, pyruvate formate lyase, which directs the bidirectional
  conversion of pyruvate to Acetyl-CoA and formate. (3) PFL is up to 3-folds higher
  in NEC vs. control. (4) The concentration of formate increases more than 6-folds
  in fecal samples of NEC patient via a key anaerobic pathway of mixed acid fermentation.
  (5) Excess fermentation products including formate and gas produce epithelial cytotoxicity
  and the hallmark sign of pneumatosis intestinale observed in intestinal mucosal
  injury in NEC. Parts enclosed in rectangular boxes are direct results from current
  study. LDH, Lactate dehydrogenase; PFL, Pyruvate formate lyase; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase;
  ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; PTA, phosphotransacetylase; ACK, acetate kinase.
