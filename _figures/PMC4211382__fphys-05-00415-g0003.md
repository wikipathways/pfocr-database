caption: Summary of intravascular/extravascular Hb/heme clearance and cellular/tissue
  distribution. The main components of the Hb/heme detoxification system are haptoglobin
  (Hp), which sequesters Hb in the oxidatively protected Hb-Hp complex and hemopexin
  (Hx). The Hb-Hp complex is cleared and metabolized by CD163+ macrophages. Alternatively,
  during more severe hemolysis, free heme—after release from ferric Hb—can be detoxified
  by the hemopexin (Hx) rescue pathway. In all scenarios heme is finally detoxified
  by the heme oxygenases, which provide free iron for export by ferroportin or, alternatively,
  storage in the ferritin complex. The physiologic clearance and detoxification organs
  for Hb/heme are the liver and spleen, respectively, while the primary targets of
  Hb/heme toxic activities are the vascular endothelium and the kidney.
