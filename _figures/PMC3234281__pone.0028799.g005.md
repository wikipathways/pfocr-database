caption: Our results are consistent with a model where the ankyrin repeats suppress
  aspects of Gβγ-induced mating pathway activation independently of the DHHC domain.
  In the absence of mating pheromone the ankyrin repeats suppress basal Gβγ signalling
  through the STE20 MAPK pathway, possibly by directly binding (see results in ) and
  sequestering Gβγ or a Gβγ containing complex released by basal STE3 activity away
  from downstream mating pathway components The DHHC domain suppresses inappropriate
  mating pathway activation by ensuring STE3 levels are kept low via the S-acylation
  of YCK2, which in turn would phosphorylate STE3 at the plasma membrane leading to
  STE3 endocytosis. These processes would both help to maintain low levels of basal
  Gβγ signalling and promote vegetative growth. This model suggests the following
  explanations for the phenotypes that we have observed. The low level mating pathway
  activation in AKR1ΔN expressing cells could be due to free Gβγ released by basal
  STE3 activity partially activating the mating pathway in the absence of AKR1 ankyrin
  repeats (which would otherwise suppress Gβγ activity). AKR1 C500S, unable to S-acylate
  YCK2, would lead to a failure in constitutive endocytosis of STE3 , , and the resultant
  elevated levels of STE3 would lead to elevated basal Gβγ release , exceeding the
  buffering potential of the ankyrin repeats. This would explain the slightly poorer
  performance of AKR1 C500S in suppressing FUS1 induction (). Domains of AKR1 and
  proteins with roles predominantly in vegetative growth are represented in white
  while those with roles predominantly in mating are represented in grey. Broken lines
  represent S-acylation activity of AKR1. Arrowed lines represent positive effects
  on function, barred lines represent negative effects on function. AKR1 DHHC – DHHC
