caption: Role of Nrf2 in acute liver injury. The protective effects of Nrf2 in acute
  liver injury, one is through regulating antioxidant defense-related genes, including
  sulfiredoxin-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase, and glutathione peroxidase-2, and the
  other pathway is by promoting its target gene HO-1 and then enhanced autophagy.
  While its negative regulator-keap1, which by binding to it inhibits Nrf2 activation
  and Trx1-PI3K/AKT-HIF1-HO-1/CyclinD1 signal pathway and promotes liver injury.
