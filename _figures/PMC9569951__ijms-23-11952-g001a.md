caption: Main androgen sytntheis pathways. This figure represents the physiological
  molecular species secreted in/by adrenal glands (intermediate and cortical layers),
  testicles, ovaries and the brain, as well by a number of other organs or tissues
  with a critical participation in these processes (e.g., skin, liver, adipose tissue).
  Since the synthesis of androgens (especially in the adrenal glands) is closely related
  to the two parallel corticosteroid synthesis pathways (they share location and a
  few enzyme activities), the start of these paths has been indicated in green squares.
  This includes the estrogens, which metabolism is much more closely intertwined with
  that of the main androgens. The 16-[estriol] and 11-hydroxylative pathways, as well
  as the catechol-estrogen specific pathway, have been included only as annotations
  in green labels. Black arrows show the enzyme-driven changes between molecular species;
  two-headed arrows show reactions that are potentially bidirectional. The main androgen
  molecule borders are red, violet in those sharing androgen and estrogen capabilities
  and blue in the fully estrogenic molecules; the progestogen borders are marked in
  yellow, and the androgenic pheromone species are in grey. The remaining molecules
  (black borders) may show a limited (if any) androgen receptor binding ability. The
  enzymes intervening in the reactions depicted are listed below the figure. They
  are presented in borderless pale blue rectangles in contact with the corresponding
  black arrows; the letters are in brown for mitochondrial and black for microsomal
  (and other location) enzymes.
