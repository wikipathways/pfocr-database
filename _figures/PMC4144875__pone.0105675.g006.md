caption: A) The schema depicts the connections among the biochemical pathways for
  glutathione cycle, hexose monophosphate shunt (hmp), glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid
  cycle (TCA cycle), and the respiratory chain. Enzymes (PGDH, GPX4, LDH), transporters
  (SLC gene products), metabolites (glutamine, glutamate) and complexes (I and IV
  of the respiratory chain) upregulated by osteopontin-c are consistent with a metabolic
  shift toward increased mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. The genes and complexes
  upregulated by osteopontin-c are highlighted in red boxes. Evidence comes from this
  study, , and searches in Oncomine. ketoglut  =  ketoglutarate. B) The pathway shows
  the mode of glycerol utilization via the glycerol phosphate shuttle, which is supported
  by the biological effects of exogenous glycerol, and the upregulation of an enzyme
  (G3PDH) and a transporter (aquaporin). Like pathway A), the glycerol phosphate shuttle
  activates the mitochondrial respiratory chain. C) The upregulation of creatine is
  required for ATP regulation. Creatine is produced from serine via glycine. The depletion
  of available serine in this process blocks the ethanolamine (Etn) and choline (Cho)
  pathways (dashed arrows), thus leading to a build-up of phosphoethanolamine and
  phosphocholine (grey arrows). Metabolites upregulated according to NMR analysis
  are highlighted in red boxes. Ptd  =  phosphatidyl.
