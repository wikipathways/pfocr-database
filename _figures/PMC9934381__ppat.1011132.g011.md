caption: In this model, cytosolic mtDNA released after EV-A71, SVV, and FMDV infection
  binds to cGAS to activate cGAS-mediated signal transduction, resulting in the antiviral
  responses. Virus immune evasion strategies include SVV 2C induced the reduction
  of cGAS by activation of autophagy and FMDV 2B and 3Cpro proteins which inhibit
  STING expression to block the antiviral response. Furthermore, EV-A71, CA16, and
  EMCV 2C can antagonize activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway by impairing
  the interaction of STING with TBK1, while FMDV Lpro and EV-A71 2A proteins inhibit
  cGAS-STING-induced IFN-β protein expression.
