caption: 'Engineering the mitochondrial isobutanol biosynthetic pathway in a xylose-utilizing
  strain of S. cerevisiae. Two different heterologous xylose utilization pathways
  have been used in yeast to convert xylose to xylulose: the isomerase pathway (used
  in this study), which uses xylose isomerase (XI); and the oxidoreductase pathway,
  consisting of xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XHD). In both pathways,
  xylulose is subsequently phosphorylated to xylulose-5-phosphate (X5P) by xylulokinase
  (XK), and then channeled to glycolysis through the non-oxidative pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP). a Mitochondrial isobutanol biosynthesis involves an upstream pathway
  that consists of the ILV genes including acetolactate synthase (ILV2), ketol-acid
  reductoisomerase (ILV5), and dihydroxyacid dehydratase (ILV3), as well as a downstream
  pathway that consists of mitochondrially targeted α-ketoacid decarboxylases (KDC)
  and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH). b There is a considerable overlap between the
  upstream pathways for isobutanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol production, except the isoleucine
  precursor α-keto-β-methylvalerate (α-KMV) is synthesized by Ilv2p from one pyruvate
  and one α-ketobutyrate produced from threonine deamination catalyzed by threonine
  deaminase (ILV1); from there, the downstream Ehrlich degradation pathway for both
  branched-chain alcohols is identical. Genes overexpressed in our strains are shown
  in blue, while genes deleted are shown in red. ALD6: cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase,
