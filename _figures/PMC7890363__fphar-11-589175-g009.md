caption: Integrated mechanism of network pharmacology and metabolomic analysis. The
  main signaling pathways, differentially regulated metabolites, and metabolic pathways
  were combined logically through the biological functions. From the pathway perspective,
  the HLJDT targets were significantly enriched in seven pathways including Th17 differentiation,
  IL-17, RAS, MAPK, Pi3k-Akt, sphingolipid, and fluid shear stress signaling pathways,
  which were critical in the regulation of the immune, inflammation, oxidative stress,
  and apoptosis process associated with MI. From the metabolomics perspective, the
  GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the differential metabolites revealed
  consistent results. In summary, network pharmacology analysis suggested that HLJDT
  could act as an immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant stress, and anti-apoptotic
  agent to exert anti-MI effects.
