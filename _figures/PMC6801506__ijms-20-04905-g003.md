caption: Schematic representation of the most significant Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) network of differentially regulated proteins in the MHO group compared to
  those from the MUHO group. IPA analysis indicated a functional interaction of networks,
  and the highest score of 40 was mostly related to cellular compromise, inflammatory
  response, and cancer. NF-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are
  indicated as central nodes that were deregulated in MUHO. Nodes in green and red
  correspond to downregulated and upregulated proteins in MHO vs. MUHO groups, respectively.
  Uncolored nodes are proposed by IPA and indicate potential targets that were functionally
  coordinated with the differentially expressed proteins. Solid lines indicate direct
  molecular interactions, and dashed lines represent indirect interactions.
