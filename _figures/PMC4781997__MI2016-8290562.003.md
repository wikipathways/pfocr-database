caption: 'Apoptosis through death receptors: a signaling pathway in TLE(HS). This
  pathway was generated by the IPA software, based on 10 of the 15 upregulated genes
  (cutoff 2.0-fold change; see ) in hippocampal tissues from TLE(HS) patients (n =
  12) compared to post mortem controls (n = 4). The biological relationship between
  two genes, represented as nodes, is shown as a line. Nodes with different shapes
  indicate different functional class. The pathway created did not include the following
  genes: NFKB2, NGFR, TNFSF10, TNFRSF10C, and TNFSF10D. The function “nervous relaxed”
  was used. A, activation; E, expression regulation; I, inhibition; L, proteolysis;
  LO, localization; M, biochemical modification; P, phosphorylation; PD, protein-DNA
  interaction; PP, protein-protein interaction; RB, regulation of binding; T, transcription;
  and TR, translocation.'
