caption: Scheme representing the functions of ASCs after LL-37 treatment. LL-37 enhances
  ASC proliferation and migration via the EGR1 and MAPK pathways. Furthermore, LL-37
  stimulates the secretion of growth factors such as VEGF, TB4, SDF-1, and MCP-1 in
  human ASCs. CM from ASCs preconditioned with LL-37 strongly promotes hair growth
  in vivo. LL-37 can be modulated to activate human ASCs and may provide a therapeutic
  approach for tissue regeneration by enforcing the functions of ASCs (e.g., expansion,
  migration, and paracrine actions). ASCs adipose-derived stromal/stem cells, EGR1
  early growth response 1, MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase, VEGF vascular endothelial
  growth factor, TB4 thymosin beta-4, SDF-1α stromal cell-derived factor-1α, MCP-1
  monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, CM conditioned medium
