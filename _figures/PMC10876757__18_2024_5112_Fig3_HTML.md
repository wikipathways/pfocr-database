caption: Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning layers in neuronal and signalling networks.
  A Schematic representation of the combination of Hebbian- and anti-Hebbian learning
  layers, which result in the discrimination between predictable and unexpected inputs.
  The cerebellum-like laminar structure of the figure is widespread in various animal
  and human neuronal networks [95] and was also shown to work in computational neural
  networks [93, 94]. Note that self-inhibitory connections (‘autapses’) are not necessarily
  needed for the circuit. B Proposed Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning layers in the
  NF-κB signalling. Receptor proximally, the signalling of multiple receptors can
  lead to the activation of the NF-κB pathway through TRAFs. Concurrently, some can
  lead to the activation of the adjacent AP-1 signalling pathway [98]. This constitutes
  a horizontal activation in the proposed Hebbian learning layer in the upstream signalling.
  In the downstream signalling, AP-1 and the non-canonical NF-κB pathway modulate
  NF-κB target genes (e.g. interleukin-8, interleukin-6). The canonical NF-κB (RelA-p52
  heterodimer) has also been shown [100] to upregulate the formation of the transcriptionally
  inactive p50-p50/p52-p52 homodimers that act as competitors to NF-κB for κB sites
  in the target genes’ promoters. These interactions, highlighted in red, constitute
  a Type-1 incoherent feed-forward loop (I1-FFL, see inset) that can be understood
  as an anti-Hebbian learning mechanism. This system enables fold-change detection
  of the incoming signal in NF-κB nuclear levels, that is analogous to discrimination
  between predictable and unexpected inputs. This figure was created with yEd Graph
