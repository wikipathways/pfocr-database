caption: Assessing the role of Nrf2/GPX4-mediated oxidative stress in arsenic-induced
  liver damage and the potential application value of RRT. Our study provides some
  limited evidence that arsenite can activate Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway to induce
  oxidative stress, which in turn promotes arsenic-induced liver damage in MIHA cells.
  The second major finding was that Kaji-ichigoside F1 may be a potential bioactive
  compound of RRT, which can inhibit Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway to reduce oxidative
  stress, thereby alleviates arsenic-induced liver damage.
