caption: Proposed model of ZC3H11A pro-viral role in human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5)
  infected cells. Increased accumulation of the ZC3H11A protein promotes selective
  virus late mRNA (e.g., fiber mRNA) nuclear export during late phase of HAdV-5 infection
  (Wild-type). Lack of the ZC3H11A protein (ZC3H11AKO) reduces HAdV-5 late mRNA nuclear
  export, virus late protein synthesis, and formation of infectious virus progeny.
  ZC3H11A interference with the NF-κB signaling pathway prevents expression of pro-inflammatory
  genes, a block that is relieved in ZC3H11AKO cells. Figure created with Biorender.com.
