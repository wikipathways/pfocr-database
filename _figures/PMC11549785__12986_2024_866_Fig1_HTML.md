caption: LncRNAs modulate MR of solid tumor cells by targeting glucose metabolism.
  LncRNAs orchestrate glucose metabolism by regulating the expression of metabolic
  enzymes and transporters or interacting with relevant signaling cascades, thereby
  controlling tumor MR. In this figure, we mainly summarize that lncRNA AF339830 and
  LINRIS inhibit ubiquitination of c-Myc, increase its’ protein stability, then activate
  the transcription of the LDHA gene or other glucose metabolism-related genes. Meanwhile,
  lncRNA NEAT1, LINC00963, and GBCDRlnc1 also inhibit the ubiquitination of PGK1,
  a critical metabolic enzyme in glucose metabolism, which significantly activates
  aerobic glycolysis of solid cancer cells by related signaling pathways. Besides,
  lncRNA AC020978, LINC01554 and LINC02774 significantly affect the function of HIF-1α-related
  pathway to take action in aerobic glycolysis of solid cancer cells. These findings
  collectively underscore the promising influence of lncRNAs on MR of solid tumors
  by influencing glucose metabolism
