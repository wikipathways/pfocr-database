caption: The MYB8 transcription factor is up-regulated in response to herbivory and
  activates the transcription of downstream genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway (PAL,
  C4H, C3H and 4CL, , ). MYB8-activated N-hydroxycinnamoyl acyltransferases lead to
  the accumulation of direct defense metabolites including N-caffeoylputrescine (AT1)
  and N′,N′′-dicaffeoylspermidine (DH29 and CV86) in attacked and systemic leaves
  of N. attenuata . Simultaneously, MYB8 also activates the lignin-related acyltransferase
  HCT-LIKE (this report) which putatively promotes local and systemic lignification
  and mechanical defense. Enzymatic step are shown by solid lines; experimentally
  determined MYB8 regulatory steps are indicated by dashed lines.
