caption: 'Pathways of sugar metabolism and exopolysaccharides (EPS) biosynthesis in
  Streptococcus thermophilus (). In Streptococcus thermophilus, exopolysaccharides
  is synthesized through a series of complex intracellular enzyme interactions. It
  is exported to the extracellular environment in the form of macromolecules through
  a special lipid carrier. The biosynthetic pathway of exopolysaccharides includes
  sugar entry into the cytoplasm, sugar-1-phosphate synthesis, polysaccharide synthesis
  and exopolysaccharides export. 1: fructokinase; 2: UDP-galactose-4-epimerase; 3:
