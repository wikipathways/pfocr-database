caption: Targeting USP7-MDM2/MDMX-p53 network for cancer therapy. Several small-molecule
  inhibitors have been developed to broadly inhibit the deubiquitinating activity
  of USP7 without direct binding (Strategy 1), via covalent binding (Strategy 2),
  or via non-covalent binding (Strategy 3), therefore inducing the degradation of
  MDM2 and MDMX and stabilizing and activating p53. These compounds have shown anticancer
  efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Directly inhibiting the bindings of USP7 to MDM2
  (Strategy 4) and MDMX (Strategy 5) may be examined to develop more safe and effective
  inhibitors for cancer therapy.
