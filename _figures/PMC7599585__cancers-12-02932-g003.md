caption: Distinct mechanisms leading to Nrf2 activation in cancer cells. The figure
  illustrates some of the best known mechanisms leading to the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2
  pathway. Details are illustrated in the text. In the center of the figure is depicted
  an unstressed condition, where Nrf2 is bound to Keap1 and targeted to proteasomal
  degradation; nuclear translocation cannot thus take place. Numbers in brackets indicate
  the paragraph where the mechanism is described.
