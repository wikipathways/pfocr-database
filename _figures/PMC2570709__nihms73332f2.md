caption: During stimuli such as oxidative stress, FoxO can be linked to a number of
  pathways that directly modulate FoxO activity, such as protein kinase B (Akt), the
  IκB kinase (IKK) pathway, and NF-κB, or that require FoxO to ultimately determine
  several cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, immune system
  modulation, and malignancy.
