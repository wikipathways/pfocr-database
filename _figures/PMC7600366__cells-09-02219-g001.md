caption: Schematic of ubiquitination regulating the plant ABA signaling pathway. Under
  normal conditions (left), the redundant ABA receptors PYL, PYR, and RCAR are ubiquitinated
  (orange circles) and degraded (dashed outline) by E3 ligases, such as DDA1-Clu4,
  RIFP1-Clu4, and PUB22/23. Kinase SnRK and transcription factors ABI5 and ABF also
  are degraded via the UPS, mediated by RING E3 KEG. Together, these result in the
  ABA pathway being inactivated in the absence of stress. During stress conditions
  (right), the ABA receptors are activated by the binding of ABA, whereby they then
  interact with PP2C to inhibit its activity. PP2C activity is also inhibited by the
  RING E3s RGLG1 and RGLG5 and degraded via the UPS. KEG also undergoes proteasome-dependent
  degradation dependent on its own ligase activity, resulting in stabilization of
  SnRK, ABI5, and ABF and activation of the ABA signaling pathway throughinduction
  of responsive gene expression.
