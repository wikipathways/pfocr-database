caption: Mechanisms of negative regulation mediated by IL-1R8. IL-1R8 is characterized
  by a single extracellular Ig domain, a transmembrane domain, an intracellular TIR
  domain and an unusually long tail of 95 residues. The IL-1R8 TIR domain differs
  from the TIR domains of other ILRs for the substitution of two conserved residues
  (Ser447 and Tyr536 with Cys222 and Leu305), suggesting unconventional signaling.
  IL-1R8 inhibits the signalling pathways downstream ILRs and TLRs by competing with
  the recruitment of MyD88 and IRAK at the TIR domain, thus dampening the signaling
  pathways involved in NF-κB and JNK activation. In addition, in T, NK and epithelial
  cells, IL-1R8 negatively regulates the activation of the mTOR pathway. IL-1R8, together
  with IL-1R5, is part of the signaling receptor of the anti-inflammatory molecule
  IL-37. The IL-37//IL-1R5//IL-1R8 tripartite complex inhibits MAPK, NF-κB, mTOR,
  TAK1 and Fyn, and activates STAT3, Mer, PTEN and p62(dok) signalling, thus leading
  to an anti-inflammatory pathway.
