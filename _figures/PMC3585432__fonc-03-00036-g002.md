caption: Involvement of YAP in the DNA damage response. Schematic representation of
  the DNA damage response induced by Cisplatin (CDDP) treatment. It was shown to signal
  c-Abl-mediated YAP phosphorylation, resulting in YAP nuclear localization and increased
  p73 binding and activation of pro-apoptotic genes. By contrast, active Akt counters
  this effect by phosphorylating YAP and sequestering it at the cytoplasmic level.
