caption: Interferon-induced ISGylation of viral proteins. During the initial stages
  of infection, cellular IFN-α/β surface receptors are bound by IFN-α/β-specific ligands
  that expose receptor phosphorylation sites to the cytoplasm. Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)
  and tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (TYK2) phosphorylate exposed cytoplasmic IFN-α/β receptor
  sites, thus recruiting the nuclear transcriptional regulators signal transducer
  and activator of transcription proteins 1 and 2 (STAT1 and STAT2) to also be phosphorylated
  by TYK2. In the cytoplasm, phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 form a ternary complex
  with methylated IRF9 which is then demethylated to signal for the migration of the
  STAT1–STAT2–IRF9 (SSI) complex to the nucleus. Upon nuclear entry, the SSI complex
  binds to the ISG promoter region interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) to
  upregulate the transcription of several hundred ISGs, including ISG15, UBE1L, UBE2L6
  and HERC5. Translated UBE1L, UBE2L6 and HERC5 proteins are subsequently targeted
  to the perinuclear regions of the cytoplasm where they work in tandem to charge,
  transfer and attach ISG15 onto respective viral protein substrates to inhibit viral
  stability, transport and reassembly. ME, methylation. This figure was created with
