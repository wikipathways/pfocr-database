caption: 'The sources of H2S in the liver. The liver is exposed to H2S from both exogenous
  and endogenous sources. Exogenously, gut microbiota represents a substantial source
  for the systemic bioavailability of H2S, which is delivered to the liver via the
  portal vein. In the colonic lumen, certain bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and
  Clostridia, are capable to produce H2S from the desulphydration of cysteine. Others,
  namely the sulphate‐reducing bacteria, are able to reduce the sulphate present in
  epithelium‐released sulphomucins to produce H2S. Endogenously, in the liver, H2S
  can be produced non‐enzymatically from polysulphides and thiosulphate when reducing
  agents are present. However, H2S is majorly synthetized as a by‐product during the
  metabolism of sulphur‐containing amino acids, such as homocysteine and cysteine,
  in the transsulphuration pathway, which involves cysteine β‐synthase (CBS), cysteine
  γ‐lyase (CSE), 3‐mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase (MPST) and cysteine aminotransferase
  (CAT). H2S is a strong mitochondrial poison when present at high concentrations,
  and cells have developed a system to maintain non‐toxic levels of H2S: the sulphide
  oxidizing unit (SOU). The mitochondrial oxidation of H2S molecules conducted by
  the SOU generates electrons and protons that are injected into the mitochondrial
  electron transport chain, which makes H2S the first inorganic energetic substrate
  used by mammalian cells'
