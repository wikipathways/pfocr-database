caption: A general survey of NTP treatment affection on triple-negative breast carcinoma
  and normal cells through different cellular pathways.(A) NTP treatment inhibits
  proliferation of MDA-MB-453 and MCF10A cells through ROS-dependent cellular pathway
  (not discussed in this article). (B) NTP treatment effects on reduction of proliferation
  through IL-6R/pSTAT3 pathway in MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cells. (C) NTP treatment effects
  on recovering the proliferation especially in normal breast MCF10A cells with post-treated
  5 mM NAC.
