caption: Cross-feeding of carbon waste metabolites creates a global carbon cycle.
  The indicated trophic categories only refer to possible effects on carbon transformation.
  For example, chemoheterotrophs are primarily responsible for the conversion of macromolecules
  from both microbes and multicellular organisms into diverse organic compounds that
  can serve as nutrients for other lifestyles but might also participate in the cycling
  of other elements. Acetogenesis arrows involve the excretion of acetate from the
  conversion of two CO2 to acetyl-CoA via energy-conserving Wood-Ljungdahl pathway
  activity, rather than referring to every lifestyle possible for a bacterium classified
  as an acetogen (). Syntrophy arrows are for fermentative carbon transformations
  that require consumption by a partner to be thermodynamically feasible (, , ). The
  diazotrophy arrow represents one of the carbon transformations known to be carried
  out by nitrogenase in sufficient quantity to support the growth of a partner ().
  In some cases, only certain organisms within a category might generate a given molecule.
  The figure does not necessarily capture every possible activity within a given lifestyle.
  The figure also does not include every carbon transformation known to be carried
  out by microbes.
