caption: A genetic model of the interaction between secondary wall defects and the
  SL biosynthetic pathway. SL biosynthesis begins with the conversion of β‐carotene
  into carlactone by the consecutive action of MAX3 and MAX4. Carlactone then acts
  as a precursor for the synthesis of species‐specific SL compounds. In Arabidopsis,
  biosynthesis and perception of MeCLA, a major active SL, have been well characterized.
  Carlactone is converted to carlactonoic acid by MAX1 and then to MeCLA by an unknown
  enzyme. MeCLA is then perceived by a receptor complex including MAX2 in order to
  regulate several plant processes (e.g., branch development). According to our model,
  secondary wall defects caused by alterations in cellulose and xylan biosynthesis
  trigger a irregular xylem syndrome as observed in the tbl29 mutant. Mutations in
  the MAX3 and MAX4 genes (in green) are able to suppress tbl29 suggesting that production
  of carlactone is required for the xylem collapse in this wall‐deficient mutant.
  In contrast, mutations in MAX1 or MAX2 (in red) fail to complement tbl29, suggesting
  that downstream steps in the MAX1‐mediated biosynthesis and MAX2‐mediated perception
  of SL would not be involved in this signaling. Dashed arrows indicate unknown steps.
  First, it is still unknown how secondary wall defects trigger the activation of
  the SL pathway. Second, it is unclear if carlactone directly or an unknown carlactone‐derived
  molecule regulates xylem development. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility
  that MAX4 catalyzes the synthesis of a related compound/s (?), not necessarily derived
  from carlactone, regulating xylem development
