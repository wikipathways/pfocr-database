caption: PCET system of tyrosine. a) Thermodynamic cycle of PCET for tyrosine radical
  formation. The vertical and horizontal pathways show stepwise ETPT and PTET mechanisms,
  while the diagonal pathway shows concerted proton and electron transfer directly
  from TyrOH to TyrO*. The CPET pathway avoids charged intermediates, which are advantageous
  in low dielectric media such as the interior of proteins. b) A conceptual reaction
  coordinate diagram for the PCET process. The CPET designated by the red line has
  a single transition state, while the PTET and ETPT processes designated in blue
  line have multiple transition states and high‐energy intermediate.
