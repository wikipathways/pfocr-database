caption: 'Mechanisms of SMKIs-induced cardiotoxicity. Osimertinib exhibits simultaneous
  inhibition of the hERG potassium channel, Nav1.5 sodium channel, and L-type Ca2+
  channel, all of which are involved in myocardial cell conduction. This inhibition
  leads to the prolongation of both the PR interval and QT interval. Afatinib specifically
  targets the EGFR and HER2 receptors, resulting in the blockade of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  This blockade subsequently leads to the accumulation of ROS and the initiation of
  cell apoptosis, resulting in mitochondrial damage, ultimately inducing heart failure.
  Moreover, lapatinib also induces oxidative stress in myocardial cells through the
  PI3K/AKT pathway, further contributing to cardiotoxicity. Lastly, TKIs such as sorafenib
  or sunitinib selectively target the VEGFR and PDGFR receptors. Hypertension is a
  prevalent cardiotoxicity associated with VEGFR inhibitors, primarily attributed
  to the inhibition of downstream signaling pathways, such as ERK/AKT, after VEGF
  inhibition. This inhibition results in a reduction in the production of NOS and
  NO by endothelial cells, leading to vasoconstriction and the eventual development
  of hypertension. Furthermore, elevated blood pressure imposes an increased afterload
  on the heart, exacerbating cardiotoxicity. Additionally, following sorafenib treatment,
  there is an observed elevation in ATF3 expression within myocardial cells, which
  inhibits the expression of SLC7A11 and promotes ferroptosis of myocardial cells,
  resulting in cardiotoxicity. Imatinib induces cardiotoxicity by promoting endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, and ponatinib induces cardiomyocyte
  apoptosis by inhibiting the AKT/ERK signaling pathway, leading to cardiotoxicity.
