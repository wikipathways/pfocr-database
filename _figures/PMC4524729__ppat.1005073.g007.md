caption: Prion infection causes the overstimulation of ROCK. Overactivated ROCK alters
  neuronal polarity by disrupting the dynamics of F-actin cytoskeleton through the
  LIM kinases/cofilin signaling pathway. Overactivated ROCK also amplifies PrPSc production
  by acting on the PDK1/TACE signaling module. Prion infection increases the pool
  of PDK1 molecules interacting with ROCK and phosphorylated by ROCK, at the root
  of increased PDK1 activity. ROCK-induced PDK1 overactivation promotes the internalization
  of TACE α-secretase in caveolin-1-enriched vesicles, which cancels TACE neuroprotective
  α-cleavage of PrPC at the plasma membrane of prion-infected cells. The accumulation
  of PrPSc fuels the activation of ROCK, the formation of ROCK/PDK1 complex and the
  increase in PDK1 activity and thereby sustains a vicious circle that contributes
  to prion disease progression. The inhibition of ROCK with Y-27632 or dimethylfasudil
  (i) rescues F-actin plasticity necessary for neuritogenesis, synapse connectivity
  and the integrity of axon/dendrites, and (ii) disrupts the ROCK/PDK1 complex, which
  lowers PDK1 activity and allows TACE to target back to the plasma membrane. Relocated
  TACE upon ROCK inhibition recovers its cleavage activity towards PrPC and attenuates
  PrPC conversion into PrPSc. ROCK emerges as potential therapeutic target to combat
  prion diseases.
