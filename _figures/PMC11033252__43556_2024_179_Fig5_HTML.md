caption: 'The mechanisms of human NLRP3 inflammasome activation and regulation. The
  activation of NLRP3 inflammasome occurs either through a canonical two-step pathway
  or a non-canonical pathway, and a direct or alternative pathway. The canonical activation
  pathway involved 2 steps: a priming (signal 1, left panel) and an activation (signal
  2, second panel from left) steps. Priming step is induced by NLRP3 signals, including
  LPS and TNF, IL-1b, IFNs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and sphingosine-1 phosphate
  (S1P), activate NF-κB that; in turn upregulates the transcription of Nlrp3 gene
  and other genes (ASC and pro-caspase1) involved in NLRP inflammasome, by interacting
  with and triggering their receptors. Once transcribed, NLRP3 is pre-activated by
  interacting with NEK7, forming a complex that will be activated into hetero-complex
  inflammasome. The canonical activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is induced by signal
  2 including PAMPs (nigericin, viral RNA, and MDP) and DAMPs (extracellular ATP,
  mtDNA, and mtROS) and particulates. The molecular mechanisms behind the polymerization
  and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome include activation of several signaling
  events, including induction of K+ efflux, Ca2+ flux, Cl–efflux, lysosomal disruption,
  mtROS production, and release of oxidized mtDNA in the cytosolic compartment. Thus,
  formation of NLRP3 inflammasome includes oligomerization of NLRP3-NEK7, recruitment
  of ASC, and Casp1. auto-proteolysis of proteolytic cleavage of Casp1 releases p10/p20
  active enzyme, which digest Pro-IL-1β and Pro-IL-18 into IL-1β and IL-18 cytokines
  to promote proinflammatory responses. The subunit p10/p20 of Casp1 also digests
  GSDMD releasing GSDMD-N that form cell membrane pore to result in pyroptosis of
  the cell. Non-canonical activation of NLRP3 inflammasome (third panel from left)
  occurs without priming, as Casp4 is already present in the cytoplasm, and is induced
  by gram-negative bacteria that release LPS into the cell cytosol. Released LPS activates
  Casp11 in human (and Casp4/5 in mouse), which cleaves GSDMD complex releasing GSDMD-N
  that forms gasdermin pores and induces pyroptosis. The gasdermin pore formed constitutes
  a channel for K+ efflux, which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, and consequently
  activate Casp1 and IL-1β and IL-18. The alternative pathway (right panel) activation
  is induced by TLR4 agonists that activates the TLR4-TRIF-RIPK1-FADD-Casp8 signaling
  pathway. Consequently, Casp8 activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Note that, there
  is no need of K+ efflux, ASC speck formation, to activate inflammasome, and there
  is no pyroptosis'
