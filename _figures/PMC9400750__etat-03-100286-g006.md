caption: Activation of canonical and noncanonical NFκB pathways may lead to ET resistance.
  Activation of the canonical pathway can be induced by multiple stimuli, including
  inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, ultimately leading to phosphorylation
  and subsequent ubiquitination of IκBα by a trimeric IKK complex (IKKα, IKKβ, and
  IKKγ), allowing the nuclear translocation of p50/p65 heterodimer. Upon translocation,
  the complex accelerates the transcription of target genes. The noncanonical pathway
  is activated by TNF cytokine family members and results in phosphorylation of NIK
  and activation of IKKα. Activated IKKα then phosphorylates p100, resulting in the
  liberation of p52 and promoting p52/RelB nuclear translocation. Both canonical and
  noncanonical pathways play important roles in cell proliferation and survival and
  inflammatory and immune response. Deregulation of NFκB signaling can lead to drug
  resistance and expression of downstream NFκB-regulated proteins, like BCL-2, cyclin
  D1, and cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 described as contributors to ET resistance
