caption: Drugs in development for the treatment of achondroplasia. Depicted is a growth
  plate chondrocyte. The main targets are FGFR3 ligands, the mutated FGFR3 and its
  activated downstream MAPK signalling pathway, as well as the NPR‑B receptor. In
  bold are substances currently in clinical trials (as of November 30, 2019). The
  complex MAPK pathway which originates from FGFR3, as well the MAPK-inhibitory pathway
  that originates from NPR‑B activation, are depicted for simplification
