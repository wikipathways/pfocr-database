caption: PD-1/PD-L1 blockade enhances tumor rejection by activating T cells. (Left)
  When PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is active, promotes survival of cancer cells via antiapoptotic
  signals mediated via PD-L1 and inhibits signaling pathways that lead to activation
  and expansion of T cells that recognize tumor antigens. Together, these events lead
  to impaired generation of T effector and memory cells and preferentiation differentiation
  of TEX and TReg cells, which promote tumor tolerance. (Right) Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1
  immune checkpoint pathway by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies suppresses cancer
  cell survival and enhances the antitumor responses of T cells, leading to tumor
  regression and rejection. In contrast to impaired TCR signaling induced by PD-1
  engagement, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade causes activation of T cells by increasing PI3K/Akt
  or Ras/MAPK pathways, promoting differentiation of effector and memory T cells and
  suppression of TEX and TReg differentiation.
