caption: Linking orphan clusters to molecules. (a) Flowchart of the “genomisotopic
  approach” for the isotope-guided isolation of orfamide A biosynthesized from the
  ofa gene cluster. C, condensation domain; A, adenylation domain; TE, thioesterase
  domain; small circles symbolize the thiolation (T) domain. (b) Phylogeny of trans-AT
  KS domains, KS domains that accept similar substrates fall into the same clade type.
  (c) Cloning of the psy gene cluster and the elucidation of its biosynthetic pathway
  from a highly complicated metagenome by the chemical structure-based gene targeting
  approach. The KS with one asterisk is rare and no clade exists so far. The KS with
  two asterisks falls into the cis-AT group. Domains shown in white lack conserved
  catalytic residues and are non-functional. For the abbreviation for each domain,
  see reference []. (d) Flowchart of PrISM for the identification of robustly expressed
  NRPSs. The high molecular weight proteins from microbial cultures are subjected
  to in-gel digestion and proteomics analysis by LC/MSn. Peptides that contain Ppant
  arms can be traced by the Ppant ejection assay. Peptide sequences obtained from
  de novo peptide sequencing are used to design degenerate primers to amplify regions
  of the expressed gene cluster. The A domains of the identified NRPS cluster are
  used to predict the substrates of amino acid incorporated. The metabolites with
  the predicted amino acid sequences are ultimately confirmed by LC/MSn in the culture
  supernatant.
