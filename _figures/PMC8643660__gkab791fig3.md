caption: 'Rational design and genetic instability of individual lycopene overproduction
  constructs for Synechocystis. Four individual pathway constructs were designed:
  high expression (pGT432), medium expression (pGT433), low burden (pGT434) and high
  burden (pGT435). Each construct was individually assembled using Start-Stop Assembly
  in the destination vector pGT270 (). pGT434 was not cloneable in E. coli (in three
  independent attempts). Synechocystis was individually transformed with each pathway
  and PCR screening was used to assess genetic stability (detail in ). In each case
  flanking sequences allowing integration at the ndhB neutral site in the Synechocystis
  genome were present and antibiotic selection pressure maintained the kanamycin resistance
  gene kanR, but gross deletions in the lycopene pathway-encoding constructs were
  observed. Promoters in descending order of strength as characterised using EYFP:
  P1 = SPLc25, P2 = SPLc19, P3 = SPLc47, P4 = SPLc3, P5 = SPLc45 and P6 = SPLc17.
  RBSs in descending order of strength as characterised using EYFP: R1 = RBSc4, R2 = RBSc21,
  R3 = RBSc110, R4 = RBSc123, R5 = RBSc48 and R6 = RBSc249.'
