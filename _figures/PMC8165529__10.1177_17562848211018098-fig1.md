caption: Bile acid biosynthetic pathways. In liver, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1)
  and mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) are the key enzymes which initiate
  the classic pathway and the alternative pathway, respectively. Through the classic
  pathway, CYP7A1 converts cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol, which is then converted
  to 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B7). Sterol
  12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) catalyzes 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one into 7α,12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one,
  which successively transforms into 7α,12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and 5β-cholestan-3α,7α,12α-triol
  under the effect of aldos-keto reductase 1D1 (AKR1D1) and AKR1C4 and sterol 27-hydroxylase
  (CYP27A1), respectively, finally leading to the generation of 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic
  acid (CA). Also, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one can be converted to 5β-cholestan-3α,7α-diol
  by AKR1D1 and AKR1C4, and finally transformed into 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic
  acid (CDCA) by CYP27A1. In the alternative pathway, cholesterol can be directly
  converted to 27-hydroxycholesterol by CYP27A1, which is finally transformed into
  CDCA following the catalyzation of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) and other enzymes.
  Then CA and CDCA are amidated with glycine or taurine in the liver to form the conjugated
  bile salts (GCA and GCDCA, TCA and TCDCA). When secreted into the intestine, conjugated
  bile acids are converted to secondary bile acids [lithocholic acid (LCA) and deoxycholic
  acid (DCA)] after the deamination performed by bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) and subsequent
  7α-dihydroxylation by bacterial 7α-dehydroxylase. The 7β epimerization of CDCA leads
  to the formation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which is a secondary bile acid
  in humans.
