caption: 'Schematic representation of defense priming: (a) a picture depicting induced
  systemic resistance (ISR), which is induced by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria
  that provide resistance to biotic stresses, and systemic acquired resistance (SAR),
  which is induced by phytopathogens that provide resistance to biotic and abiotic
  stresses; (b) a flowchart showing signal transduction pathway of ISR that are followed
  by jasmonate (JA) and ethylene (ET) plant hormones, which are encoded by the jar1
  and etr1 genes, respectively, whereas SAR is followed by salicylic acid (SA), which
  is encoded by the sid1 and sid2 genes.'
