caption: (A) The sex-related candidate unigenes enriched in putative sexual differentiation
  pathway by the comparative transcriptomic analysis of MroDmrt11E knockdown. The
  primary upregulated transcripts (red color) and the downregulated transcripts (green
  color) were briefly profiled in the signaling pathway. The genes with gray color
  possibly participated in the sexual differentiation but did not show significant
  differential expression by MroDmrt11E knockdown. (B) The brief relationship among
  Dmrt gene family and Mr-IAG was summarized to evaluate their potential influences
  involved in the sexual differentiation of M. rosenbergii.
