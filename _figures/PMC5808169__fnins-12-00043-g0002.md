caption: Illustration of possible molecular mechanism by which alpha-synuclein monomers/oligomers/
  synuclein fibrils can modulate the homo-heteroreceptor complexes balance and panorama
  in the plasma membrane. In the far left part of the figure it is indicated that
  monomeric alpha-synuclein transmembrane (TM) peptide can become linked to A2AR homoreceptor
  complex and modulate the A2AR function. The A2AR antagonist may then favor the formation
  of non-propagating synuclein dimers (pathway highlighted in red). The A2A receptor
  agonist induced A2AR activation (pathway highlighted in green) may instead favor
  the propagation of the synuclein dimers/oligomers into small and large synuclein
  aggregates leading to formation of Lewy bodies. Ring-like synuclein oligomers may
  also be formed which may enter the membrane and there produce beta sheet structures
  that associate and give rise to pores in the plasma membrane through which calcium
  ions may pass. In the A2AR-mGluR5 heteroreceptor complex the signaling pathways
  are illustrated and how protein kinases like PKA, PKC and calcium-calmodulin kinase
  II activities can have a role in the modulation of the synuclein aggregation process.
  The A2AR-D2R-NMDAR complex, to which the alpha-synuclein monomer may bind to the
  A2AR, is also illustrated to indicate that A2AR activation can mediate toxicity
  also by turning on NMDAR signaling via inhibition of the D2R induced allosteric
  antagonistic interaction with the NMDAR. In this way the calcium influx through
  these ion channels is reduced as well as its coupling to nitric oxide (NO) toxicity.
  It is also indicated that beta sheet rich intermediates of alpha-synuclein peptides
  may bind to the intracellular loops and C-terminal of the receptor protomers of
  this heteroreceptor complex and modulate their signaling. They may also disturb
  the signaling of the G proteins and beta-arrestin. Finally to the far right the
  A2AR-FGFR1 heteroreceptor complex is presented with the alpha-synclein monomer bound
  to the A2AR. The role of this receptor complex in the degeneration process is unknown
  but FGFR1 activation by the A2AR may enhance structural plasticity and reduce toxicity.
