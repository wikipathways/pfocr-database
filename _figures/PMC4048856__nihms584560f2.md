caption: The iron-regulated pathway and the inflammatory pathway are the two well-studied
  regulators of hepcidin. The erythroid regulator pathway (not shown here) also exerts
  a strong effect on hepcidin expression but its molecular components are not yet
  known. In the iron-regulated pathway, extracellular iron in the form of holotransferrin
  binds to its two receptors (TfR1 and TfR2) which communicate with each other via
  iron-specific adaptor HFE and sensitize the BMP receptor to its ligands such as
  BMP6. Membrane-linked coreceptor hemojuvelin also potentiates the BMP receptor activation,
  which then controls hepcidin transcription via the SMADs. BMP signaling is also
  modulated by MT-2 protease, which cleaves hemojuvelin, and by neogenin, which may
  augment or stabilize membrane hemojuvelin. In hepatocytes, intracellular iron is
  also sensed, possibly through a mechanism that enhances the expression of BMP6 mRNA
  and protein, eventually leading to activation of the BMP receptor. Alternative ligands
  with BMP6-like activity must exist because mice that lack BMP6 still increase hepcidin
  mRNA in response to iron stores. Hepcidin transcription is prominently increased
  by inflammation, predominantly through the activity of IL-6, its receptor and its
  canonical JAK-STAT3 pathway.
