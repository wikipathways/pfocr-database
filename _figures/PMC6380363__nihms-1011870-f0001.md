caption: 'The primary product of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS; highlighted
  in green) is lipoic acid, an important cofactor for many mitochondrial proteins.
  However, new data from Van Vranken et al. show that mtFAS also functions as a nutrient
  sensor of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA levels via acylation of acyl carrier protein
  (ACP; orange). When acetyl-CoA levels are high, acyl-ACP is produced and interacts
  with Leu-Tyr-Arg (LYR)-motif-containing proteins (dark blue), which promotes assembly
  of LYR target proteins (purple) into electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, and
  ultimately supports mitochondrial respiration (bottom left). When acetyl-CoA levels
  are low, acyl-ACP is not produced and LYR targets are not efficiently incorporated
  into oxidative phosphorylation complexes, ultimately decreasing mitochondrial oxidative
  capacity (bottom right). It is possible that this nutrient-sensing pathway responds
  to specific mitochondrial acetyl-CoA sources and/or levels, such as glucose, fatty
  acids, or acetate, to tune mitochondrial respiration rates to nutrient availability.
  Abbreviation: holo-ACP, 4′-phosphopantetheine-bound ACP.'
