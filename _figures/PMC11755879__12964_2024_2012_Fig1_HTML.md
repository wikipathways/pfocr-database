caption: Molecular mechanisms of NLRC5 regulation of NF-κB and type I IFN pathways
  and MHC I gene expression. Role of NLRC5 in regulating host defence in MHC I-related
  antigen presentation. After binding to corresponding receptor, IFN-γ activates transcription
  factor STAT1 through phosphorylation, induces nuclear localisation of STAT1, binds
  to corresponding site, and induces transcription of NLRC5 and IFN regulatory factor
  1 (IRF1). IRF1 binds to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) on MHC
  I genes. NLRC5 enters nucleus through nuclear localisation signals and binds to
  MHC transcription factors (RFX component RFXANK) in promoter region of class I genes
  to induce expression of MHC I genes, ultimately activating antigen-specific CD8 + T
  cells. NLRC5 negatively regulates NF-κB pathway. LPS or other inflammatory factors
  are recognised by toll-like receptors to activate NF-κB pathway. NLRC5 inhibits
  NF-κB pathway by interacting with IKKα/IKKβ subunits, blocking their phosphorylation
  and NEMO binding. The ubiquitin–proteasome mechanism induces IκB degradation, resulting
  in transfer of free NF-κ B from cytoplasm to nucleus, and regulates transcription
  of downstream target genes through its activation. NLRC5 regulates type I IFN expression.
  NLRC5 inhibits type I IFN transcription and its mediated signalling pathway by reciprocally
  inhibiting phosphorylation of IRF3 with RIG-I/MDA5
