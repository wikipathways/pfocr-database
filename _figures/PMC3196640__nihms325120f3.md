caption: A glycolytic phosphate futile cycle that is initiated when 3-phosphoglycerate
  is converted to 2-phosphoglycerate by phosphoglycerate mutase. The reaction proceeds
  through a 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3DPG) intermediate that has a tendency to dissociate
  from Phosphoglycerate Mutase and release an inorganic phosphate. 2-phosphoglycerate
  is converted to Phosphoenolpyruvate by Enolase. Two enzyme activities compete for
  phosphoenolpyruvate as a substrate. One activity (left) involves pyruvate kinase
  that transfers the phosphate group to ADP to generate pyruvate and ATP. The other
  involves an enzyme complex that donates the phosphate to Phosphoglycerate Mutase
  to prime the enzyme active site (right). In turn, this alternate glycolytic pathway
  results in net zero production of ATP during glycolysis.
