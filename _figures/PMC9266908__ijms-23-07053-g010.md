caption: Schematic representation of the main molecular events responsible for the
  anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory capacity of hydroxytyrosol. The incorporation
  of HT into the cell triggers a profound inhibition of PI3K activity within the AKT/PI3K
  signaling pathway. This inhibition allows AKT to avoid phosphorylation, keeping
  its activity intact, generating a series of molecular changes that lead to a decrease
  in the proliferation and survival of cancer cells together with an increase in cell
  differentiation and apoptosis. The activity of AKT facilitates the development of
  the MAPK pathway through MEK1/2/ERK1/2, which together with a decrease in the expression
  levels of c-Myc and KSR1 favors cell differentiation. In addition, HT reduced the
  levels of the inactive form of p53, increasing the levels of the active form, as
  well as those of caspase 9 and induced a decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein
  Bcl-2, which led to a significant increase in the recognition of apoptosis of cancer
  cells. In parallel, the significant reduction in inflammation caused by the administration
  of LPS together with a drastic decrease in the expression levels of HSP60 and SOD
  after treatment with HT allows us to recognize the important anti-inflammatory activity
  of this natural polyphenol.
