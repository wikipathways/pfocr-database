caption: Schematic representation of the NGF metabolic pathway in healthy brains and
  its deregulation in Down’s syndrome. (A) The NGF precursor is released to the extracellular
  space along with the convertases and zymogens necessary for its maturation and subsequent
  degradation. ProNGF is cleaved extracellulary and converted to mature NGF by plasmin.
  Plasmin derives from plasminogen by the action of tPA. Neuroserpin is the endogenous
  tPA inhibitor in the CNS. Mature NGF (mNGF) is degraded by MMP9, which is also released
  from neurons along with its endogenous inhibitor TIMP1. (B) In Down’s syndrome brains
  there is a failure in proNGF maturation due to reduced plasminogen and tPA as well
  as enhanced neuroserpin levels. Down’s syndrome brains also exhibit increased MMP9
  activity and higher TIMP1 levels, likely contributing to enhanced mature NGF degradation.
