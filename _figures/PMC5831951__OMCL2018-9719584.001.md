caption: Dietary intake patterns affect human health state. High-carbohydrate and
  an animal-based protein diet and excessive fat consumption will eventually lead
  to obesity as well as other obesity-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases
  (CVD), diabetes, and cancer. The key pathway involved in the pathogenesis is via
  the elevation of oxidative stress. Subsequently, inflammation occurs resulting in
  the reduction of insulin sensitivity, increased cancer cell proliferation, involvement
  of gene in lipogenesis, and cancer development of which is activated and accompanied
  by apoptosis of healthy cells. To revert these unhealthy conditions, consumption
  of healthy diet is essential. Healthy diet includes whole grains, nuts, fruits and
  vegetables, fish, and legumes. In general, a healthy diet contains dietary fiber,
  unsaturated fatty acids like monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and n-3 polyunsaturated
  fatty acid (n-3 PUFA), protein, vitamins, minerals, and others health-promoting
  components. All these components exhibit antioxidant ability thereby reduce oxidative
  stress. The healthy diet could reduce inflammation, cancer development, and lipogenesis
  transcriptional expression. It also increases insulin sensitivity accompanied by
  the reduction of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity. A healthy dietary pattern
  is crucial for maintaining good health.
