caption: 'RPPA data shows increases in ErbB3, ErbB2, MET, PI3K, pBAD and pERK protein
  expression in M12 cells relative to the parental p69 cell lines (: green targets).
  Western blot () confirms a decrease in PTEN expression (red). These proteins figure
  prominently in signal transduction pathways that are targeted by miR-125b and miR-22.
  Intermediates in yellow (AKT, RAS and pMEK) were not included in the proteome analysis.
  miR-125b directly targets ErbB2, ErbB3 and MET and miR-22 targets PTEN [,]. We propose
  that the loss of tumor suppressor miR-125b in the M12 cell line would result in
  enhanced signaling via the PI3K/AKT pathway and the RAS/pMEK pathway as regulated
  by MET. Conversely, miR-22 targets PTEN, the loss of which by increased expression
  of miR-22 further exacerbates PI3K signaling. In this scenario the dysregulation
  of these two miRs could contribute to the highly tumorigenic/metastatic phenotype
  displayed by the M12 cells compared to the parental p69 cell line and subsequently
  contribute to prostate tumorigenesis.'
