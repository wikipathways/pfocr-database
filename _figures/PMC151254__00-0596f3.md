caption: Potential Pathways for Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate (IP3) Degradation in
  Plants.The pathways are drawn on the basis of information from animal systems. FIERY1
  inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase can hydrolyze Ins(1,4)P2 and Ins(1,3,4)P3.
  A potential pathway mediated by FIERY1 with direct hydrolysis of IP3 at the 1-position
  is also indicated (with a question mark). 5-phosphatase, inositol polyphosphate
  5-phosphatase.
