caption: Ferroptosis signaling pathway. Ferroptosis is primarily regulated by iron
  metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Initially, extracellular
  iron ions bind to TF/TFRC, subsequently entering the cytoplasm to form endosomes.
  These ions then enter the labile iron pool (LIP) via the actions of STEAP3 metal
  reductase and DMT1. Ferritin regulates the content of the LIP through autophagy
  or storage, whereas excess iron ions are expelled from cells via SLC40A1. The Fenton
  reaction involving Fe²+ and hydrogen peroxide generates reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), which promote ferroptosis. Secondly, cystine enters the cell via System Xc-
  and is converted to glutathione (GSH) through reduction and enzymatic reactions.
  The GSH-GPX4 axis functions as an antioxidant defense system in vivo, inhibiting
  ferroptosis. Lastly, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in lipids are enzymatically
  converted into PL-PUFA-OOH, promoting ferroptosis. Additionally, the FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H,
  PPR11-DHODH, and GCH1-BH4 pathways also regulate ferroptosis
