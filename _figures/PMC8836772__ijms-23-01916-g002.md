caption: Metabolomic profile of glucose metabolism. (A) All glycolytic intermediates
  were upregulated after TRT. (B) Intermediates of pentose phosphate pathway were
  restored to that similar to control. (C) Decrease of glutathione disulphide as a
  marker of the improvement of oxidative stress. Deregulation of level of NAD and
  NADH. (D) The glycerol shuttle was not active to contribute to the oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway in the mitochondria. It was used for phospholipid synthesis. All data are
  shown as mean ± SEM of fold-change relative to the metabolite levels in controls.
