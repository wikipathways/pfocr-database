caption: PMSC differentiation into skeletal muscle using the insulin-like growth factor
  system. PMSCs isolated from the chorionic villus of preterm human placenta expressed
  high levels of pluripotency-associated markers under normal growth conditions (10%
  FBS). As these cells differentiated into skeletal muscle, the levels of these markers
  decreased, and the cells committed to the muscle lineage, indicated by Pax3/7 expression.
  Once committed to differentiation, PMSCs subsequently decreased Pax3/7 expression
  and increased muscle differentiation markers (MyoG, MyoD, and MHC) as myoblasts
  aligned and fuse to form multinucleated myofibers. IGF-1 and IGF-2 binds to the
  IGF-1R and activates its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity resulting in signaling
  that accelerated muscle differentiation via downstream signals including PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  and the RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway. Due to IGFBP-6 intracellular and extracellular
  locations, IGFBP-6 demonstrated both IGF-dependent and IGF-independent effects on
  PMSC muscle differentiation. Extracellular IGFBP-6 binds IGFs and enhances the muscle
  differentiation process through the IGF-1R, while intracellular IGFBP-6 directly
  impacted PMSC muscle differentiation through an unknown mechanism.
