caption: Sphingosine‐1‐phosphate lyase‐1 (SGPL1) disruption causes adrenal insufficiency.
  (A) SGPL1 regulates breakdown of ceramide, a pathway associated with several established
  metabolic disorders (sphingolipidoses). (B) The Sgpl1‐/‐ knockout mouse has an adrenal
  phenotype including depleted lipid in zona glomerulosa cells. Panels (A) and (B)
