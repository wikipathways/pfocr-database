caption: Potential mechanisms of monocyte infection and immune-enhanced severity in
  COVID-19. (a) Receptor-mediated infection of target cells by SARS-CoV-2 is achieved
  by binding of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) with host membrane-bound ACE2,
  which allows TMPRSS2 proteasomal cleavage of the viral spike membrane to enable
  virus–host membrane fusion; (b) In antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), binding
  of the virus-antibody complex to an Fc gamma receptor stabilizes the viral spike
  in a manner that mimics the function of the viral receptor, enabling cleavage of
  the viral membrane and virus–host membrane fusion; (c) Induction of autoantibodies
  may result from molecular mimicry by viral proteins having sequence similarity to
  host proteins, anti-idiotype antibodies with cross-reactivity to host receptors,
  or direct disruption of immunological tolerance, which may be induced by TLR7 hyperactivation
  (not shown); (d) Increased disease severity may result from maladaptive immune responses
  to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Viral infection of monocyte/macrophages can contribute
  to inflammatory pathology, activating downstream cytokine signaling, and cellular
  differentiation pathways. Inflammatory responses may also be induced by activation
  of pattern-recognition receptors including RIG-I-like receptors (RLR), Toll-like
  receptors (TLR), and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). Receptors expressed at the
  immune cell membrane mediate adhesion of viral membrane glycoproteins, potentially
  contributing to infectivity by stabilizing the virus at the host cell membrane.
  Activation of complement pathway receptors by viral glycoproteins or antibody-bound
  target proteins may produce tissue damage by inducing complement-dependent cytotoxicity
  (CDC). Cross-linking of Fc gamma receptors by immune complexes can induce antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps
  (not shown). Elevated cytokine and chemokine expression promotes cell recruitment,
  increased vascular permeability, and inflammatory damage to infected tissue.
