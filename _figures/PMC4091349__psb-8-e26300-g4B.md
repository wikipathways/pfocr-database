caption: 'Figure 4B. Overviews of metabolism pathways of ambient O3-responsive genes
  in seeds of an O3-totlerant cultivar, Koshihikari (A) and a sensitive cultivar,
  Takanari (B). Significant fold changes in non-redundant 615 genes were transformed
  to Log2 (fold) and mapped on various metabolic pathways using the MapMan tool. Small
  red, blue and dark gray squares within each metabolism pathway (large light gray
  boxes) indicate upregulation, downregulation and no detection of mapped genes in
  a given cultivar, respectively. Of the displayed pathways, major biochemical process
  such as starch-sucrose metabolism, glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and GABA shunt are
  indicated by arrows and the corresponding metabolites are indicated as circles.
  Solid red, blue, and black arrows indicate upregulation, downregulation, and no
  detection of relevant genes for each metabolic reaction in a given cultivar, respectively.
  Dotted arrows mean that genes related to the mapped reactions is not detected in
  both cultivars. Abbreviations: G-6-P: glucose-6-phosphate, F-6-P: fructose-6-phosphate,
  Glycerate-2-P: glycerate-2-phosphate, PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate, Gln: glutamine,
  Glu: glutamate, GABA: gamma-aminobutyric acid, Sar: Sarcosine (N-methylglycine),
