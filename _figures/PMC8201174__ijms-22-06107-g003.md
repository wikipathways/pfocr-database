caption: Possible modulators of fibrosis via regulating TGF-β signaling and cell proliferation.
  TGF-β signaling promotes induction of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
  expression of fibrosis-associated genes via TGF-β-Smad-dependent canonical pathway
  and non-Smad pathway. In the canonical pathway, TGF-β binds to and activates its
  receptor complex and promotes phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Then activated Smad2/3
  forms a complex with Smad4 and the complex binds to the promoter regions of target
  genes associated with EMT and fibrosis. Inhibitory Smad such as Smad7 and Smad cofactors
  to regulate the TGF-β-Smad pathway. MiRNA such as miR-21 inhibits translation of
  Smad7 as a positive regulator of TGF-β signaling. Several lncRNAs participate in
  controlling TGF-β-mediated EMT and/or fibrosis. A lncRNA ELIT-1 which is induced
  by TGF-β-Smad pathway binds to Smad3 to facilitate recruitment to promoters of Smad
  target genes promoting EMT as a Smad cofactor. Moreover, several E3 ubiquitin ligases
  are involved in promotion in pulmonary fibrosis. Skp2 which promotes p27 degradation
  is involved in promotion of EMT and mesenchymal fibroblast proliferation. Fbw7 which
  participates in TPP1 degradation promotes alveolar epithelial stem cell senescence
  and pulmonary fibrosis. Abbreviations and details of each molecule are indicated
  in the text.
