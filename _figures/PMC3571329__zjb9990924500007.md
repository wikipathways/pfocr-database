caption: '(A) Proposed metabolic model for syntrophic growth of D. alaskensis strain
  G20; (B) revised metabolic model for syntrophic growth of D. vulgaris strain Hildenborough
  including all three pathways, Qmo-Qrc (I), Hmc-Coo (II), and Aor-Adh-Hdr-Flox (III),
  involved in electron transfer. Colors indicate transcriptional changes in individual
  genes during coculture growth relative to a sulfate-limited monoculture (the main
  electron transfer pathway in respective Desulfovibrio species is highlighted with
  red arrows); †, mutants of D. alaskensis strain G20 or D. vulgaris strain Hildenborough
  with no growth in coculture on lactate. Abbreviations: LctP, lactate permease; Ldh,
  lactate dehydrogenase; R(-SH)2 and R-SS, reduced and oxidized forms of unknown thiol-disulfide
  redox pair (probably DsrC) interacting as an electron carrier with Ldh; Por, pyruvate:ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase; Fd-II red and Fd-II ox, reduced and oxidized forms of ferredoxin
  II, respectively; Fd red and Fd ox, reduced and oxidized forms of ferredoxin, respectively;
  Qmo, quinone-interacting membrane-bound oxidoreductase; MQ, menaquinone; Qrc, quinone
  reduction complex; Pta, phosphate acetyltransferase; Ack, acetate kinase; Aor, aldehyde:ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase; Adh, alcohol dehydrogenase; Hdr-Flox, putative electron-bifurcating
  complex coupling NADH oxidation with reduction of thiol-disulfide redox pair (probably
  DsrC) and ferredoxin and vice versa (electron confurcation); Hmc, high-molecular-weight
  cytochrome c complex; Hyn, [NiFe] hydrogenase; Fdh, formate dydrogenase; Hyd, [Fe]
  hydrogenase; Tp-I-c3, type I cytochrome c3; Ssc, split-Soret cytochrome c; CoA,
  coenzyme A.'
