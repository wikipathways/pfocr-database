caption: 'Schematic illustration of molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of
  anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on neuronal physiology. The
  neurostimulation in the target cortical area depolarizes neuronal membrane and glutamate
  released in presynaptic neuron and binds in NMDA and AMPA receptors (see book chapter
  Rozisky et al., 2015). Consequently, there is intracellular Ca2+ upregulation in
  the postsynaptic neuron, which can activate protein kinases that in turn modulate
  numerous neuronal signaling pathways (such as the mTOR pathway) leading to transcriptional
  changes. The tDCS also activates molecular cascades to promote BDNF production.
  As a long-term mechanism, gene transcription is modulated leading to the formation
  of new proteins that in turn lead to facilitation of LTP and improvement of cognition.
