caption: Cartoon summarising endosomal trafficking and the known points of influence
  of free p85. The ligand-bound receptor is internalised within an intracellular clathrin
  lattice. The clathrin lattice invaginates forming a clathrin-coated pit that pinches
  off to form a clathrin-coated vesicle. This intermediate vesicle fuses with the
  early endosome, delivering the receptor. This vesicle fusion event is mediated by
  Rab5 that localises to early endosomes. p85 GAP activity towards Rab5·GTP switches
  off this initial fusion event and is implicated in receptor down-regulation. The
  RTK-containing early endosome can also be trafficked through the endocytic pathway
  to the lysosome for degradation. AP2, adaptor protein2; GF, growth factor; SNX9,
  sorting nexin 9; GAP, GTPase activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor.
