caption: Integrin signaling and regulation of structural changes, cell survival, differentiation,
  and gene expression. Peptides (light blue) bind first to the integrin α chain, causing
  a conformational change, thus facilitating an approximation to the integrin β chain.
  A high-affinity integrin complex is generated (green), and both cytoskeletal components
  (e.g., f-actin; black) as well signal transduction proteins (e.g., vinculin, paxillin,
  talin, focal adhesion kinase; red) bind to the intracellular domain of the integrin
  β chain. Secondary intracellular signal pathways include rac, ras, pi3K, erk, akt,
  and others. They relay signals, for instance to AP1 binding sites in integrin-regulated
  promotor sequences.
