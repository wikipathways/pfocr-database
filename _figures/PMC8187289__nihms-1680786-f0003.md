caption: (A) DSB repair pathways during the cell cycle. cNHEJ is active throughout
  the cell cycle (black circle). MMEJ and HDR can only be employed in S/G2 phases
  (green circle). (B) In the absence of a template guided repair mechanism editing
  outcomes are significantly affected by the target site sequence. MMEJ efficiency
  and the pattern of DNA small deletions are dependent upon the presence of microhomologies
  within the first 10 bp from the DSB end. 1–2 bp insertions/deletions through cNHEJ
  is affected by the nucleotide at the 4th position upstream from the PAM. (C) Nucleosomes
  can potentially block Cas9 access to target site, although the site can be exposed
  through nucleosome breathing or by a nucleosome remodeler. Compacted heterochromatin
  promotes HR, MMEJ, and SSA, while cNHEJ is preferred in euchromatin. (D) Homology-directed
  repair (HDR) with ssDNA or dsDNA donor templates. Double-stranded DNA donor templated
  repair (DSTR) occurs mainly through HR and single-stranded DNA donor templated repair
  (SSTR) occurs mainly through SSA and SDSA. Asymmetric HDR can arise when one end
  is repaired through HR, while the other end is repaired through cNHEJ or MMEJ. With
  ssDNA, the end that is complementary to the 3’ end of ssDNA templates is repaired
  through SSA/SDSA, while how the other end is repaired is unknown. The repair of
  the other end through MMEJ generates asymmetric HDR which displays a bias directionality
  with respect to the orientation of the ssDNA templates.
