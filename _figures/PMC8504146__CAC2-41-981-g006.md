caption: 'Physiological processes of EMT and its mechanisms in drug resistance. (a).
  EMT initiation elicits dramatic changes in cell morphology and physiology. Down‐regulation
  of multiple apoptotic signaling pathways associated with EMT, enhancement of drug
  efflux, and retarded cell proliferation all conspire to enhance the resistance of
  cancer cells to drugs. (b). Drug recognizes the EGFR receptor on the surface of
  epithelial cells, which in turn blocks the EGFR signaling pathway and ultimately
  induces apoptosis. In contrast, in mesenchymal cells, Snail induces the expression
  of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase. Meanwhile, AXL signaling triggered by binding to
  growth arrest‐specific protein 6 (GAS6) enhances drug tolerance. Abbreviations:
  EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; EMT: epithelial‐mesenchymal transition;
  GAS6: growth arrest‐specific protein 6'
