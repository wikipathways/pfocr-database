caption: Metabolism of phenylalanine. The different compounds that are generated in
  each metabolic pathway are showed and those harboring important organoleptic properties
  for cheese are colored in orange. The different metabolic pathways can be followed
  according to the corresponding arrows. Between every pair of compounds, the genes
  involved in such reactions are shown with their KO name. TPM values of each gene
  are shown as colored diamonds next to their corresponding KO name, which is colored
  in blue or green if significant transcription was identified for such KO day 30
  or 90, respectively (p < 0.05). Next to the KO names, the horizontal bar-plots represent
  the percentage of transcripts for that KO and ripening time that was associated
  with the different taxa.
