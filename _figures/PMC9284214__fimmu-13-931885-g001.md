caption: The classical cGAS-STING signaling pathway. The green arrows indicate the
  activation of this pathway and induction of the IFN-I response. The yellow arrow
  indicates the synthesis of cGAMP. The blue arrow indicates the phosphorylation of
  IRF3. Protein phosphorylation is depicted as P. The question mark indicates that
  the specific mechanism has not been elucidated.
