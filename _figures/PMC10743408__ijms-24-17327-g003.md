caption: Mechanistic illustration of downregulation of interferon-responsive genes
  and JAK/STAT1/2 signaling pathway. Red arrows demonstrate lower transcript abundance
  in MIX-Se- compared to ISe-supplemented heifers. All transcripts included were significant
  via transcriptomic analysis, and an asterisk (*) indicates those transcripts that
  were corroborated via qPCR at p ≤ 0.05. Results of qPCR analysis for MX1 are reported
  in Crites et al. [34]
