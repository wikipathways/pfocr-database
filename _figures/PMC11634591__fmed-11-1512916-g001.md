caption: The cGAS-STING signaling pathway. cGAS not only recognizes cytoplasmic self-DNA
  but also a large variety of DNA-containing pathogens, such as DNA viruses and bacteria.
  Upon binding to dsDNA, activated cGAS produces 2′3′-cGAMP, which binds to and activates
  downstream STING, causing its translocation from the ER membrane to the Golgi apparatus.
  The translocation of STING subsequently allows itself to recruit and activate TBK1
  and IRF3 via a phosphorylation dependent-mechanism. The active IRF3 dimer translocations
  to the nucleus and activates transcription of IFN-1 genes. In addition, activated
  STING triggers NF-κB and MAPK pathway activation
