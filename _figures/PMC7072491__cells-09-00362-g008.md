caption: 'Key regulators modulated by an E.A./CDDP combination in breast cancer cells.
  E.A./CDDP acts on the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by decreasing the expression
  of BCL-2 and BCL-xL anti-apoptotic proteins and by increasing the expression of
  Bax and Bak proteins. The relocalization of Bax into mitochondria would allow the
  release in the cytosol of pro-apoptotic molecules contained in the mitochondrial
  intermembrane space, allowing then the activation of the procaspase-9 in caspase-9,
  which, once activated, will turn on caspase-3. Also this E.A./CDDP combination is
  able to activate capsase-8, one of the apoptotic markers of the extrinsic pathway
  allowing both the cleavage of the Bid protein, where Bid truncate will proceed to
  activate the mitochondrial pathway and the cleavage of procaspase-3 into active
  caspase-3, which will target the cleavage of PARP and then lead to cell death (FADD:
  Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain).'
