caption: Metabolic flux distribution through branching areas of the central metabolism
  of MG1655 and ECOM4LA cell lines. Mean metabolic flux distribution data acquired
  from WT and ECOM4LA strains grown in triplicate are presented here. (A) Overall
  metabolic map of central metabolism, with branching areas of metabolism boxed. The
  corresponding gene expression data are presented in Fig. . (B) Relative input to
  glycolysis (F6P) from glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) versus input to the pentose phosphate
  pathway in each strain (based on [U-13C]glucose labeling data). (C) Relative input
  to oxaloacetate (OA) from α-ketoglutarate (αKG) in the TCA cycle or from PEP via
  PEP carboxylase. Also shown, in red, is the fraction of OA formed from PEP that
  recycled through fumarate (FUM) in each strain.
