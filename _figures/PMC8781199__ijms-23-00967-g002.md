caption: 'mTOR signaling pathway genes interacting with MAR ASD genes. The edges of
  the network are colored according to the type of interaction that had the highest
  confidence score. There were five dominant types of interactions: automated textmining
  (colored green), annotated database (colored cyan), experimentally determined (colored
  pink), homology (colored blue), and coexpression (colored black). mTOR signaling
  genes colored cyan, MAR ASD genes colored pink.'
