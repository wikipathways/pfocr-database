caption: Functions attributed to adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and interacting
  partners (A). APC, represented by the red disc, controls polarised cell division
  (asymmetric stem cell division and symmetric epithelial cell division), migration,
  axonal growth and chromosomal segregation. These functions may reflect a common
  molecular mechanism, the control of microtubules dynamics. The bold D indicates
  a dominant function of truncated APC over full‐length APC. (B) APC interacts with
  several proteins involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics, which have
  been linked to either cell migration (blue) or polarised cell division (green).
  ASEF, APC‐stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor; hDLG, human Disc Large;
  IQGAP1, IQ domain‐containing, GTPase‐activating protein; mDIA, diaphanous; KAP3,
  kinesin super family‐associated protein 3; EB1, end binding 1.
