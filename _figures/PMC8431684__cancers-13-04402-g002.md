caption: Examples of SUMO-modification regulation of key oncogenic substrates. (A)
  SUMOylation of PML-RARα in K160 and recruitment of co-repressors is required for
  APL cell differentiation blockade, self-renewal and immortalization. (B) PIAS3 promotes
  transactivation of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and proliferation of breast cancer
  cells via SUMO-dependent and independent mechanisms, whereas PIAS1 has a predominantly
  repressive effect on ERα. (C) SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation of androgen receptor
  (AR) promotes AR-dependent transactivation and proliferation of prostate cancer
  cells that is counteracted by PIAS1- and PIAS2-induced SUMO1-modification of AR.

  description: Examples of SUMO-modification regulation of key oncogenic substrates.
    (A) SUMOylation of PML-RARα in K160 and recruitment of co-repressors is required
    for APL cell differentiation blockade, self-renewal and immortalization. (B) PIAS3
    promotes transactivation of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and proliferation of breast
    cancer cells via SUMO-dependent and independent mechanisms, whereas PIAS1 has
    a predominantly repressive effect on ERα. (C) SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation of
    androgen receptor (AR) promotes AR-dependent transactivation and proliferation
    of prostate cancer cells that is counteracted by PIAS1- and PIAS2-induced SUMO1-modification
    of AR.
