caption: 'Schematic illustrating the role of the PLA2/COX cascade in the pathogenesis
  of schizophrenia and blunting of the niacin flush response. The PLA2/COX pathway
  is significantly disrupted in patients with schizophrenia: the level of cPLA2, which
  primarily mediates the dissociation of AA, is significantly increased, and catabolism
  of free AA is enhanced by COX-1. The metabolites affect nervous system function
  by interfering with the release of neurotransmitters and inducing overexpression
  of cytokines such as IL-6. However, downregulation of CREB1 and COX-2, as well as
  the decrease in the level of the PGE2 receptor EP4, may be related to the blunting
  of the niacin skin flush response.'
