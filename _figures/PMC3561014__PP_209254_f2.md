  known to be up-regulated due to  deficiency. Increased Suc metabolism via glycolysis
  and organic acid production provide carbon for malate and citrate exudation into
  the rhizosphere. Organic acids lost through exudation are replenished through anaplerotic
  pathways involving phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and a glyoxylate-like
  cycle malate synthase (MS). One-carbon metabolism is enhanced through a formate
  and  pathway. The  pathway contributes to Met and ethylene production. Increased
  expression of transcripts involved in phospholipid degradation releases  for recycling

  malate synthesis through malate synthase. Formate may be carboxylated to glyoxylate
  by a putative glyoxylate synthase (Glox-S). Additional abbreviations are as follows:
