caption: Perturbations of central carbon metabolism by the polymyxin B/rifampicin
  combination. The combination significantly altered metabolite levels and gene expression
  associated with the TCA cycle, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  with significantly changed metabolites at 0.25, 1, and 4 h shown in red. Differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) at 1 h (either upregulated or downregulated as indicated
  with arrows) are shown in blue. Box plots show the upper and lower quartiles (top
  and bottom of box), median (line within box), and the spread of data that are not
  outliers (whiskers). No significantly altered metabolites or DEGs were observed
  at 24 h with either monotherapy or the combination. Significantly changed metabolites
  and DEGs were identified with > 1.0 and < − 1.0 log2FC and FDR ≤ 0.05. The figure
  is modified from the KEGG with reference to P. aeruginosa PAO1
