caption: Microbial metabolites program mitochondrial functions in health and disease.
  Under homeostatic conditions, the healthy microbiota contributes to normal mitochondrial
  and cellular functions by providing, for example, metabolites that directly feed
  into mitochondrial bioenergetics or trigger signaling cascades. In diseased states
  such as chronic intestinal inflammation or cancer, these homeostatic interactions
  between the dysbiotic microbiota and mitochondria are deregulated and promote a
  proinflammatory environment fostering carcinogenesis that is characterized by an
  increase in aerobic glycolysis, a reduction in OxPhos and FAO, changes in mitochondrial
  membrane permeability and resistance to cell death. Due to its plasticity, interventions
  targeting the microbiota to restore normal mitochondrial functions are promising
  novel therapeutic approaches for intestinal inflammation and cancer by counteracting
  mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming. BA, bile acids; Trp, Tryptophan; SCFA, short-chain
