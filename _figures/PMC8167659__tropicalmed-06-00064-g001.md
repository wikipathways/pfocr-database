caption: Pathogenesis of cholera and mode of action of the cholera toxin. (A) In the
  1970s, the pathogenesis of cholera rapidly became better understood than any other
  infectious disease, as summarized in this figure from a Nobel Symposium on cholera
  in 1978 (A-M. Svennerholm, p.162 in []). After ingesting contaminated food or water,
  V. cholerae bacteria colonize the small intestine and secrete the cholera toxin,
  a doughnut-like protein with a central enzymatic toxic-active A (A1 + A2) subunit
  that is associated with a cell-binding pentamer of B subunits (B5). After binding
  to cell surface receptors identified as the GM1 ganglioside (the first-ever structurally
  defined mammalian cell receptors), the A subunit dissociates from the B subunits
  and its A1 entity binds to and ADP-ribosylates the GTP-binding Gs adenyl cyclase
  protein. This leads to the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which in turn induces
  the secretion of chloride, bicarbonate, and water from intestinal crypt cells and
  blocks sodium chloride and water uptake from villus cells, resulting in the watery
  diarrhea, dehydration, and acidosis that is typical of severe cholera. (B) Subsequent
  crystallographic studies have confirmed the A:B5 dough-nut structure of the cholera
  toxin and further detailed knowledge has been gained about the way the cholera toxin
  induces fluid secretion. After binding to GM1 ganglioside receptors, which are mainly
  localized in lipid rafts on the cell surface, the toxin is endocytosed and, via
  a retrograde pathway, travels to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the ER, the
  A subunit dissociates from the B subunits and, through translocation via the ER
  degradosome pathway, A1 is released into the cytosol. After refolding, A1 ADP-ribosylates
  Gs, stimulating the adenyl cyclase (AC) complex to produce increased levels of cAMP,
  leading to the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), phosphorylation of the major
  chloride channel CFTR (the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator),
  and the secretion of chloride (Cl−), among other effects, resulting in the often
  lethal cholera diarrhea and fluid loss.
