caption: The model highlights the interplay of SKN-1A-mediated proteasomal gene expression
  and activation of ORR and IPR in the epidermis and the intestine, respectively.
  1. Under normal conditions, proteasomal degradation of unknown positive regulators
  (denoted as X factor) keeps activation of immune responses in check. 2. When proteasome
  dysfunction happens either by BTZ treatment or loss-of-function of skn-1a, X-factor
  escapes degradation and activates ORR and IPR in the epidermis and the intestine.
  Simultaneously, BTZ-mediated inhibition increases proteasomal gene expression as
  a bounce-back response. Such X factors could be directly involved in the tissue-specific
  signaling pathway activated upon oomycete or microsporidia exposure, respectively,
  in the epidermis and the intestine. Alternatively, they could regulate ORR and IPR
  gene induction in parallel to the pathogen-induced signaling pathway. BTZ, bortezomib;
  IPR, intracellular pathogen response; ORR, oomycete recognition response
