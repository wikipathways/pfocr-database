caption: The diagram illustrates the proposed mechanisms of action of β-CTX. The β-CTX
  may non-competitively block the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) without affecting the
  downstream signaling. (A) Under the non-stimulating condition, the β-CTX directly
  reduces the myofibrillar ATPase activity, resulting in the reduction of myofilament
  kinetics and contractility. The calcium transient is, therefore, unaffected. (B)
  Under the stimulating condition with ISO, the cAMP-PKA pathway, however, could not
  be activated. The calcium transient is decreased likely due to the inhibition of
  SERCa. The effect of β-CTX on LTCC and RyR is unknown and awaits further investigation.
