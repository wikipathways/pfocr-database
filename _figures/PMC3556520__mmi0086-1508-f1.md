caption: Comparison of the early steps of the α-aminoadipate pathway for lysine biosynthesis
  with the citric acid cycle. Both pathways require an isomerization of a malate derivative
  (homocitrate, citrate). In the citric acid cycle, a single enzyme performs the reversible
  isomerization. The isomerization in the α-aminoadipate pathway is less well studied.
  Although homoaconitase performs the second reaction (II), its contribution in the
  homocitrate to homoaconitate dehydration (I) is unclear and could also be performed
  by an aconitase. The isomerization involving a flip of the substrate in the active
  site is highlighted in the separate box. Here, (R)-homocitrate is dehydrated to
  form (Z)-homoaconitate. After a 180° rotation of homoaconitate (≡) water is added
  yielding (2R, 3S)-homoisocitrate.
