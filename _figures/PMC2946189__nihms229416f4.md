caption: A schematic drawing of proposed underlying mechanisms of the bee venom (BV)-induced
  chemically relevant persistent nociception (CRPN) in the spinal cord dorsal horn.
  The BV-induced thermally relevant secondary hyperalgesia (TRSH) and thermally relevant
  mirror-image hyperalgesia (TRMIH) are proposed to share the mechanisms similar to
  the CRPN. Shown is a synaptic structure between a pre-synaptic component (central
  terminal of primary afferents, left) and a post-synaptic component (membrane of
  a pain-signaling neuron, right). Astrocytes and microglia are not fully activated
  at this stage. At the synaptic cleft, in response to the coming of tonic firing
  action potentials, excitatory amino acids (EAAs, glutamate and aspartate, small
  colored clear vesicles) are selectively activating ionotropic glutamate receptors
  (NMDA and AMPA/KA) and metabotropic glutamate receptor group I (mGluR I), while
  substance P (large dense-cored vesicles) are activating neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors.
  At this process, mGluR II and III are not activated. At pre-synaptic component,
  vanilloid receptor TRPV1, voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC), and NK1 are
  activated. ATP (green clear vesicles) released from glial cells or damaged cells
  due to cytotoxic effects are activating ATP P2X receptors. On the other hand, glycinergic
  and GABAergic modulations become weak due to lack of inhibitory amino acids. Intracellularly,
  extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPK, protein kinases (PKA
  and PKC and PKG) are phosphorylated and recruited as enhancing modulators of membrane
  receptors and ion channels. Cyclooxygenases 1/2 (COX-1/2) are also recruited as
  enzymes catalyzing arachidonic acids to prostaglandins. The inset on the right top
  shows involvement of descending nociceptive facilitatory pathway from rostral medial
  medulla (RMM) in the development and maintenance of TRMIH due to the centrally sensitized
  state.
