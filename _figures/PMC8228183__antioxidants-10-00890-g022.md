caption: Examples of signaling pathways involving NOX1, 2, 4 and 5 in the regulation
  of the different tumorous stages. NOX1-derived superoxide, activated by thrombin,
  PDGF or Ang II, can affect cell differentiation via the p38 and ERK1/2 pathways,
  hypertrophy via p38-mediated Akt activation, cell migration via cSrc (Proto-oncogene
  tyrosine-protein kinase Src) activation and cell growth via ERK1/2 activation, subsequent
  activation of transcription factor Ets-1 and upregulation of cyclin D. NOX1 also
  downregulates the expression and activity of the antiangiogenic receptor PPARα,
  which is known to inhibit the NF-κB transcription factor and thus angiogenesis.
  NOX2, activated by TNFα, thrombin or NF-κB-induced ROS, promotes migration and angiogenesis
  via the Akt and cSrc pathways. NOX2-mediated regulation of angiogenesis also occurs
  via cadherin, p38 activation or regulation of ERK1/2 activation mediated by NOX4-derived
  H2O2. NOX2 also regulates cell growth via p38 activation or inhibition of ERK1/2
  differentiation, and migration via the eiF4E (Eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4E) and pRB pathway. NOX4 expression and activity are promoted by TGF-β1
  or Ang II. NOX5, whose superoxide production is activated by IL4 or PDGF, promotes
  cell growth and inflammation, respectively, through the JAK-2 / STAT3 and NF-κB
  signaling pathways. Inspired by [].
