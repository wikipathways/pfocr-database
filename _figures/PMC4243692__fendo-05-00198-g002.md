caption: 'The major pathways by which leptin interacts with the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid
  axis. The hypophysiotropic TRH neurons are metabolic integrators that are regulated
  by leptin and the thyroid hormones. TRH is secreted from the PVN of the hypothalamus
  and stimulates the anterior portion of the pituitary gland to produce and secrete
  TSH, whose function is to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones,
  T4 and T3. These hormones regulate the activity of TRH neurons in the hypothalamus
  by a classical negative feedback pathway. Leptin stimulates TRH secretion in the
  hypothalamus. Leptin produced in the pituitary is capable of inhibiting TSH secretion.
  Leptin secretion from adipose tissues is regulated by stimulatory factors such as
  TSH, glucocorticoids, T4 and T3 and insulin as well as inhibitory factors such as,
  cold and free fatty acids. Leptin and the thyroid hormones, T4 and T3, have a role
  in puberty; however, whereas the leptin role is permissive, the T4 and T3 role remains
  uncertain. The arrays indicate: solid (stimulatory), dashed (inhibitory), dotted
  (uncertain) signals. TRH, thyreotrophin release hormone; TSH, pituitary tireotropin;
  T3, 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine; T4, thyroxine. See text for details.'
