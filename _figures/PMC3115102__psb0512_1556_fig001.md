caption: 'Systemic signaling of low external Pi for the onset of P-deficiency status.
  This model describes a causal relationship between photosynthetic C assimilation/partitioning
  and the onset of a systemic P-deficiency status under low external Pi. In this model,
  two types of phloem-mobile molecules (miR399 and sucrose) are both required for
  shoot-to-root communication to initiate P deficiency responses in roots. Under low
  external Pi, both the biogenesis of miR399 and the accumulation of sucrose require
  photosynthesis in shoots. After being transported to roots, shoot-derived miR399
  and sucrose act as systemic signals to initiate a series of changes, such as a higher
  level of root miR399 and the subsequently enhanced Pi uptake by repressing target
  gene PHO2. Furthermore, sucrose also stimulates lateral root development, a hallmark
  feature of root architecture in P-deficient plants. This signaling pathway could
  be disrupted by any one, or a combination, of the three limiting steps: drastically
  reduced photosynthesis (e.g., by extended dark treatment), impaired phloem uploading
  of sucrose (e.g., in the pho3 mutant), and/or blocking of phloem transport (e.g.,
  by stem-girdling). Therefore, low external Pi to roots is not sufficient for plants
  to initiate systemic P-deficiency responses in that low external Pi is superseded
  by C limitation.'
