caption: Using succinyl-CoA and glycine as precursor molecules, expression of the
  heme pathway enzymes HemA-F in E. coli results in production of PIX as the common
  intermediate of the heme and BChl biosynthetic pathways. Addition of the BChl enzymes
  magnesium chelatase (BchHID) and methyltransferase (BchM) yields MgPIX and MgPIXME
  in E. coli , . Subsequent steps have not yet been functionally assembled in a heterologous
  system and depending on the enzymes substrate specificities, the order in which
  the enzymes operate may differ from the depicted pathway. Briefly, formation of
  the characteristic fifth E ring of chlorophylls is catalyzed by two unrelated and
  yet to be biochemically characterized cyclases AcsF (aerobic)  or BchE (anaerobic)
  . The D pyrrole ring is reduced either by a light-dependent, nitrogenase-like (LPOR,
  three-subunit enzyme BchLNB) or a light-independent (DPOR) protochlorophyllide reductase;
  both enzymes have been biochemically characterized –. Reduction of the C8-vinyl
  group of BChl intermediates is catalyzed by the NADPH-dependent reductase BciA ,  investigated
  in this study. Seven additional enzymatic steps are required for production of Bchl
