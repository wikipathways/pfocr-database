caption: The scheme of zinc regulating neuronal glucose metabolism after SCI. After
  SCI, neuronal glucose transport, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitochondrial membrane
  potential of the neurons were decreased, with ROS accumulating and oxidative stress
  increasing (black arrow). Through the AMPK pathway, zinc strengthened neuronal glucose
  transport, promoted mitochondrial biogenesis, increased mitochondrial membrane potential,
  and reduced oxidative stress after SCI (blue arrow). Compound C suppressed the effect
  of zinc (red arrow).
