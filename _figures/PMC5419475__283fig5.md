caption: Proposed model of the interplay between the GαSpathway and the K2P channel
  TWK-7 in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic motor neurons of C. elegans. Stimulation
  of the G protein-coupled receptor GSA-1 activates the GαSpathway inducing cAMP synthesis
  by the adenylate cyclase 1 (ACY-1). Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4) counteracts this
  process by hydrolyzing cAMP (; ). (A) In wild-type background, elevated cAMP levels
  elicit the dissociation of the two inhibitory KIN-2/RIβ subunits from the KIN-1/KIN-2
  heterotetramer causing KIN-1/PKA activation. Accordingly, KIN-1/PKA is hyperactivated
  in kin-2 reduction of function mutants such as kin-2(cau1) or kin-2(ce179) (not
  depicted in the model). Our data suggest that activated KIN-1/PKA functions epistatically
  in GABAergic motor neurons to its putative downstream target TWK-7. Inactivation
  of TWK-7 leads to enhanced locomotor activity and hyperactive locomotion behavior.
  (B) When overexpressing dominant negative KIN-2(G310D) in GABAergic motor neurons
  of wild-type worms, the KIN-1/KIN-2 holoenzyme is insensitive to cAMP and TWK-7
  remains active. Therefore, these animals move with reduced crawling activity and
  exhibit a lethargic locomotion behavior. (C) Acting downstream of KIN-1/PKA, TWK-7(null)
  rescues the lethargic locomotion phenotype induced by specific overexpression of
  dominant negative KIN-2(G310D) in GABAergic motor neurons.
