caption: Pathway of the formation of VSMC-derived foam cells induced by ox-LDL. Low-density
  lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) plays a dual role in the process of transforming
  smooth muscle cells into foam cells induced by ox-LDL, including inducing lipid
  droplet formation and inhibiting the expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter
  (ABC) ABCA1 through ERK1/2/p-cPLA2. LRP1 plays a dual role in the process where
  high-fat stimulation transforms smooth muscle cells into foam cells. Ox-LDL induces
  WNT5A autocrine and then activates WNT5A/DVL2/JNK signaling, which enhances the
  expression of CD36. TREM2 upregulates the expression of the scavenger receptor CD36
  in VSMCs by inducing the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
  and PPARγ and increasing PPARγ nuclear transcriptional activity. Ox-LDL induces
  the direct phosphorylation of Lyn and AKT through CD36 and then downregulates the
  expression of LDL via TFEB. Ox-LDL induces VSMC transformation to foam cells through
  the mtROS/c-Fos/LOX-1 signaling pathway, which promotes ox-LDL uptake. LKB1 inhibits
  VSMC-derived foam cell formation and atherosclerosis via phosphorylation of SIRT6
  and subsequent inhibition of LOX-1 expression. ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated
