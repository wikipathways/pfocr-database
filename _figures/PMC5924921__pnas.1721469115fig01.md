  (R37E, R38E, W166Y); 4-HPAA, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde; 4-HPP, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate;
  4′OMT, 3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine 4′-O-methyltransferase; and 6OMT, norcoclaurine
  6-O-methyltransferase. (B) EIC MRM using noscapine’s highest characteristic precursor
  ion/product ion transition (414 → 220) of (i) 0.5 μg/L noscapine standard, (ii)
  CSY1149 media, and (iii) CSY1150 media. CSY1150 was cultured in SD with 2% dextrose
  in the presence of 10 mM ascorbic acid at 25 °C for 72 h. Growth medium was analyzed
  by LC–MS/MS MRM. Traces are representative of three biological replicates.
