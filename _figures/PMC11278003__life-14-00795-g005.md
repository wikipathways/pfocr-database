caption: 'KEGGs pathway and GO molecular function (MF) analysis based on AD correlated
  interactors of Apaf-1 and TNF-α. The Venn diagram represents the quantities of shared
  and non-shared proteins in the PPI networks. Functional annotations of shared PPI
  networks were illustrated using box plots, where a larger box indicates stronger
  enrichments (FDR < 0.05). CD4: cluster of differentiation 4, CRP: C-reactive protein,
  Cyt: cytokine, GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, IL: interleukin,
  INS: insulin, OR: oxidoreductase, Sp: signaling pathway, TLR4: toll-like receptor
  4, TNF: tumor necrosis factor'
