caption: One pathway by which dopamine D1-like receptors mediated the salicylate-induced
  GABAA receptor internalization was through the effect of PKC on spiral ganglion
  neurons. After SS increased the PKC-dependent phosphorylation at γ2 S327 by D1Rs,
  the internalization of GABAARs was increased through a clathrin/dynamin-dependent
  pathway, then the surface level of GABAARs was reduced, resulting in a weakened
  GABAAR-mediated response. PowerPoint 2020 (Microsoft, USA) was used for the creation
  of the figure.
