caption: Signaling pathway inferred from a gene regulatory network. This figure depicts
  a bow tie inferred from membrane-bound proteins and TFs that were predicted to be
  active in a gene regulatory network []. The proteins in the bottom are the TFs,
  the proteins at the top are the membrane-bound proteins and the remaining proteins
  constitute the inferred signaling pathway. Different modules of this pathway are
  associated with different biological processes, where the core module is associated
  with exocytosis – a process through which cells direct secretory vesicles out of
  the cell.
