caption: Model of LSEC activation and cellular crosstalk during COVID-19 according
  to McConnell, Kawaguchi et al.SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a systemic release of
  IL-6 which activates LSECs via a trans-signaling pathway involving the sIL-6R and
  gp130. Activated LSECs acquire a procoagulant and proinflammatory phenotype, secrete
  vWF, Factor VIII, CXCL1 and 2 and cell adhesion molecules ultimately favoring platelet
  aggregation and neutrophil recruitment in the liver. Moreover, LSECs produce IL-6
  and cross talk with hepatocytes, which respond to IL-6 via a classical signaling
  pathway involving the IL-6R. Hepatocytes contribute to the systemic response to
  SARS-CoV2 infection by producing fibrinogen and acute phase proteins. Gp130, glycoprotein
  130; IL-6, interleukin-6; IL-6R, interleukin 6 receptor; LSECs, liver sinusoidal
  endothelial cells; sIL-6R, soluble interleukin 6 receptor; vWF, von Willebrand factor.
