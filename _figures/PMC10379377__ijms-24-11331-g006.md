caption: The possible mechanisms of the pro-inflammatory response in yak AMs induced
  by low glucose plus BHB. In the condition of low glucose plus BHB, the GPR109A/NF-κB
  signaling pathway is activated through the receptor GPR109A. Oxidative stress is
  induced, which activates p38, which consequently stimulates NF-κB and results in
  the expression and release of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, low glucose can
  also induce oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the AMs.
