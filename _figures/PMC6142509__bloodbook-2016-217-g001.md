caption: Activation and regulation of the alternative complement pathway. A small
  amount of plasma C3 is continuously converted to C3b that is highly active and binds
  to cell surface via forming thiol bonds. Under normal conditions, C3b is rapidly
  degraded in plasma by FI and FH (FI cofactor), or on the cell surface by FI and
  glycosoaminoglycan-bound FH, membrane protein CD46 (or MCP), or CD35. Degradation
  of C3b to an inactive product (iC3b) on the cell membrane by membrane-bound FH,
  MCP, or CD35 requires FI, and is known as cofactor activity. IC3b cannot participate
  in any further complement activation. If not inactivated, C3b is able to bind to
  an activation product of FB (Bb) produced by FD-mediated cleavage of FB, and generate
  C3bBb (C3 convertase). C3 convertase is the engine of the complement pathways and
  deposit additional C3b molecules on membrane, which in turn amplify complement activation.
  C3 convertase is an important target for complement regulatory proteins. FH prevents
  the formation of C3 convertase and dissociate C3 convertase by competing with FBb
  for binding to C3b. This negative regulatory activity of FH is known as decay accelerating
  activity. If C3bBb remains intact, the complex is stabilized by FP (properdin) and
  binds to additional C3b to generate C3bBbC3b, which is also known as C5 convertase.
  C5 convertase activates C5 to generate C5b, which in turn binds to C6, C7, and C8,
  forming the C5b-8 complex that stably inserts into the lipid bilayer of the cell.
  Next, the C5b-8 complex binds and polymerizes multiple molecules of C9 (C5b-9n),
  forming cytolytic MAC of complement on the cell surface. CFB, factor B; CFD, factor
