caption: Schematic presentation of pathways for arginine catabolism and polyamine
  biosynthesis. Only key compounds and genes in the ADC pathway and polyamine biosynthesis
  are shown. The catabolic genes between putrescine and glutamate have not been identified.
  Solid and broken arrows represent biosynthetic and catabolic pathways, respectively.
  ADI, arginine deiminase; AST, arginine succinyltransferase; AOD, arginine oxidase;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid. The speA, speB, speC, and speE genes encode biosynthetic
  arginine decarboxylase, agmatine ureidohydrolase, ornithine decarboxylase, and spermidine
  synthase, respectively (). The aguAB genes encode agmatine deiminase and N-carbamoylputrescine
  amidohydrolase, as characterized in this study, and the catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase
  is encoded by gdhB ().
