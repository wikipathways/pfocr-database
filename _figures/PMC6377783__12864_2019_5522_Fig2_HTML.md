caption: Expression patterns for genes involved in the CO2signaling pathway of the
  stomata. Wild-type data are presented as an average of both wild-type genotypes.
  Data are presented as the average of log-transformed counts-per-million +/− standard
  error. Green area represents a maize guard cell. The bicarbonate pool produced by
  CA-medicated CO2 hydration is sensed by RHC1. When bicarbonate levels are high,
  RHC1 interacts with and binds HT1. This prevents HT1 from inhibiting OST1 (indicated
  with dashed line). With HT1 sequestered to the plasma membrane, OST1 is able to
  activate SLAC1, which results in stomatal closure. As pictured here, RHC1 and SLAC1
  are both expected to localize to the plasma membrane []
