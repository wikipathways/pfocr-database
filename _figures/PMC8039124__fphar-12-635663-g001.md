caption: Summary of the current evidence on the role of JAK/STAT pathway in the pathogenesis
  of vasculitis. TRM, Th1 and Th17 cells infiltrate the vessel wall and induce inflammation.
  Numerous cytokines are secreted by T cells and innate immunity cells and activate
  JAK/STAT pathway. Other cytokines, such as IL-17 are therefore produced an secreted,
  further amplifying the inflammatory response. The modulation of SOCS transcription
  may be another altered mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of vasculitides.
