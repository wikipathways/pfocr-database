caption: 'Elimination of pyruvate kinase as an acetate reduction strategy. Increased
  PEP leads to (i) feedback inhibition of Pfk and elevated HMP pathway flux and/or
  (ii) increased flux through the anaplerotic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (Ppc).
  Dotted and fat arrows depict lessened and increased fluxes, respectively, relative
  to the wild type. Key precursors for plasmid DNA synthesis (boxed) are also shown.
  Additional abbreviations: 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; αKG, α-ketoglutarate; AcCoA,
  acetyl coenzyme A; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; MAL, malate;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; Pgi, phosphoglucose isomerase; PTS, phosphotransferase system;
  PykA, AMP-activated pyruvate kinase; PykF, FBP-activated pyruvate kinase; PYR, pyruvate;
  R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; Zwf, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.'
