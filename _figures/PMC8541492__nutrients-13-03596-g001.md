caption: 'Metabolic pathway of vitamin D3: The chemical formula of calcitriol is used
  to illustrate the biochemistry of vitamin D and its metabilites using different
  colors. The vitamin D pathway is characterized by two subsequent hydroxylation steps.
  In the liver, 25-Hydroxylase produces 25(OH)D3 (calcidiol), which can be stored
  in fat tissue. 1-Alpha-hydroxylase generates the active steroid hormone 1,25(OH)2D3
  (calcitriol), which regulates calcium metabolism as well as the innate and adaptive
  immune system.'
