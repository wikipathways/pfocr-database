caption: A schematic diagram of the findings in the context of the ceramide (Cer)
  metabolism pathway. The summary diagram depicts the Golgi body and lysosome as indicated.
  In the Golgi body, the ceramide could be converted into glucosylceramide (GlcCer)
  by UGCG or galactosylceramide (GalCer) by UGT8. Sphingomyelin (SM) is generated
  from Cer by SGMS. GalCer is the metabolic precursor to sulfatide (ST) through the
  action of CST. Glucosylceramide is released by Golgi into the cytosol that reaches
  the lysosomes. The Golgi releases glucosylceramide into the cytoplasm, where it
  reaches the lysosomes. Ceramides can be synthesized from GlcCer in lysosomes via
  GBA; alternatively, ASAH1 can convert the pool of GlcCer to glucosylsphingosine
  (GluSph). CerG1 = hexosylceramide.
