caption: During salt-sensitive hypertension, excess sodium (Na+) enters the DC through
  sodium transporters to activate DCs. Activating the serum/glucocorticoid kinase1
  (SGK1) salt sensing kinase induces the NF-κB signaling pathway and fosters DC maturation.
  The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) on DCs drives IL-6 release to activate T cells.
  By contrast, the ubiquitin editor A20 in dendritic cells restrains NF-κB-dependent
  DC maturation. When DCs mature, C-C Motif chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and costimulatory
  molecules including CD40, CD70, CD80, CD86 are expressed on the DC surface to guide
  DC interactions with the T cell receptor. Sodium transporters, the MR, SGK1, and
  A20 are potential targets for restraining DC activation and limiting the severity
  of immune-mediated hypertension.
