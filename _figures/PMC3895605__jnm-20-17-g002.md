caption: 'Possible signalling pathways involved in enteric neurogenesis by a 5-hydroxytryptamine
  4 receptor (5-HT4R) agonist mosapride citrate (MOS). Main intracellular pathways
  activated by proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret (RET) are shown.
  MOS activates a 5-HT4R, G protein coupled receptor (GPCR). This GPCR possibly does
  transactivation of RET. RET activation results in phosphorylation of several residues,
  including Y1015 and Y1062. Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and phospholipase
  C gamma (PLCγ) are required for proliferation and/or differentiation of enteric
  nervous system (ENS) precursors. RAC, RHO and CDC42 regulate enteric neural crest-derived
  cells (ENCDCs) migration and proliferation. Kinesin-like protein KIF26A (KIF26A),
  Sprouty2 (SPRY2) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are negative regulators
  of RET signalling: KIF26A binds to GRB2 and prevents RAS-ERK and phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) signalling, whereas SPRY2 binds to RAS and RAF and blocks activation
  of the RAS-ERK pathway. PTEN regulates proliferation via PI3K and Akt. Retinoic
  acid reduces PTEN levels in migrating ENCDCs and hence blocks the inhibitory effect
  of PTEN on RET signalling. Protein kinase A is thought to integrate RET and endothelin
  B receptor (EDNRB) and possibly 5-HT4R signalling pathways by RET phosphorylation
  at S696 and RAC activation. Modified from Obermayr et al. EDN3, endothelin 3; GAB1,
  GRB2-associated binding protein 1; GDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor;
  GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; JNK, c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase; PKC,
  protein kinase C; S, serine; Y, tyrosine.'
