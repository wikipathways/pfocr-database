caption: 'NETosis activated by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and cytokines activate endothelial
  cells, which are able to produce adhesion molecules (e.g., P-SEL) and recruit neutrophils,
  which release NETs composed of nucleic acids, histones, and other proteins. NETs
  can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 present in the bloodstream and neutralize it. NETs can
  induce different immune cells to secrete IL-1β, which enhances NET formation in
  several diseases by providing positive feedback and accelerating thrombus formation.
  In addition, NADPH oxidase can produce ROS which activates NETosis. At the same
  time, the IL-6 receptor binds to IL-6, which enters the bloodstream and interacts
  with NETs. IL-1β is able to induce IL-6 expression which, in turn, is able to induce
  fibrinogen expression by increasing fibrin release. The virus’ endothelial damage
  can expose a tissue factor in activated endothelial cells capable of stimulating
  the coagulation pathway, which consists in fibrin deposition and blood clotting.
  At the same time, NETs also activate the coagulation contact pathway and bind activated
  platelets to contribute to amplify blood clotting. ACE2: angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; NET: neutrophil extracellular trap; IL-6R:
  Interleukin 6 receptor; P-SEL: P-Selectin. This figure is adapted from the work
  of Merad et al. [].'
