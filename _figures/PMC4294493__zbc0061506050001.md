caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of CMP-Pse in the Gram-positive strain B. thuringiensis
  israelensis ATCC 35646 (Bti) requires seven proteins, whereas six are needed in
  Gram-negative C. jejuni. A, in the C. jejuni pathway, a single enzyme PseB converts
  UDP-2-deoxy-2-acetoamido-d-glucose, UDP-d-GlcNAc, to UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-l-AltNAc.
  In the B. thuringiensis pathway, two enzymes are needed. First, Pen converts UDP-GlcNAc
  with enzyme-bound NAD+ to UDP-6-deoxy-d-GlcNAc-5,6-ene, and then Pal converts it
  to UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-l-AltNAc. From this point, both pathways carry out similar
  enzymatic reactions (although the amino acid sequence for each specific enzyme is
  not conserved between species, see ) leading to the final product of CMP-Pse. B,
  organization of the seven-genes pse operon and flanking regions in B. thuringiensis
  israelensis ATCC 35646. The locus number for each enzyme-encoding gene in the operon
  is shown.
