caption: 'Anthocyanin biosynthesis in higher plants. A, Chemical structure of the
  general anthocyanin molecule and main anthocyanin pigments synthesized in plants,
  according to the different nature of the R lateral groups. B, Anthocyanin biosynthetic
  pathway. Enzyme abbreviations: PAL, Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumaroyl:CoA-ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase; ANS, anthocyanin
  synthase; UFGT, anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase. In the final part of the
  biosynthetic way, from dihydroflavonols to anthocyanins, the pathway which is predominant
  in tomato plants is highlighted.'
