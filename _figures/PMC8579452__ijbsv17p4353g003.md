caption: Stimulators regulating IL-1β expression accelerate atherosclerotic vascular
  calcification. The NLRP3 inflammasome participates in the regulation of the progression
  of atherosclerotic vascular calcification via two signaling pathways described as
  follows. (A) The reduced Rac2 activity, caused by compromised guanine nucleotide
  exchange factors (GEFs), elevates the expression of Rac1, which promotes activation
  of NF-κB pathway and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These events lead
  to the NLRP3 inflammasome production. (B) Extracellular cholesterol crystals are
  taken up by macrophages and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 inflammasome-activated
  caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and induces the secretion of IL-1β. (C) Deletion of
  the gene encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) contributes to elevation
  in IL-1β expression and subsequent vascular calcification independent of hypercholesterolemia.
  This cascade may be modulated by the Wnt and β-catenin signaling pathways.
