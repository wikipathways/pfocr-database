caption: Metabolic pathways and their possible therapeutic approach in graft vs. host
  disease (GVHD). Energy or ATP generation in cells involve fundamental cellular processes
  glycolysis and OXPHOS. Glycolysis interconnects with Kreb’s cycle and the PPP, which
  is necessary for fundamental metabolic process, and NADPH regeneration. Metabolic
  changes in a pathway may consequently affects others as they are all interconnected.
