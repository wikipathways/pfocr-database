caption: This diagram illustrates the interconnected pathways involved in ferroptosis.
  First, the amino acid pathway is crucial for GSH production, a key antioxidant.
  Cystine enters the cell through the Xc- antiporter, is converted into cysteine,
  and combines with glutamate and glycine to form GSH. GPX4 then uses GSH to neutralize
  lipid peroxides, preventing ferroptosis. Second, the lipid pathway shows how PUFAs
  are processed by enzymes such as ACSL4, LPCAT3, and ALOX15, resulting in the formation
  of PUFA-OOH, which, if not neutralized by GPX4, triggers ferroptosis. Third, the
  iron pathway highlights how Fe2+ contributes to ferroptosis by generating ROS through
  the Fenton reaction. Iron enters cells via Tf, is reduced to Fe2+ by STEAP3, and
  either stored in ferritin or exported by FPN1. Excess Fe2+ leads to ROS production,
  enhancing lipid peroxidation and promoting ferroptosis. Lastly, the Nrf2 pathway
  serves as a protective mechanism against ferroptosis. Nrf2, typically inhibited
  by Keap1, is released during oxidative stress, translocates to the nucleus, and
  activates the expression of antioxidant genes like GPX4. This helps mitigate oxidative
  stress, regulate lipid peroxidation, and control iron metabolism, thereby preventing
  ferroptosis
