caption: A) Neurons in the hippocampus play critical roles in learning and memory,
  and are vulnerable to dysfunction and degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease, stroke,
  traumatic brain injury and epilepsy. The dentate gyrus (yellow) contains neurons
  that receive inputs from neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC), with the latter
  brain region serving as a conduit for sensory information from higher cerebral cortical
  regions involved in responding to sensory inputs and internally-generated cognitive
  processes. Increased activity in these neurons occurs in response to fasting resulting
  in the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF promotes the
  growth and maintenance of dendrites and synapses, and also enhances the production
  and survival of new neurons from neural stem cells; the newly-generated neurons
  then integrate into the existing neural circuits; B) Signaling pathways by which
  glutamate, BDNF, insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) improve neuronal bioenergetics
  and protect the neurons against neurodegenerative disease and traumatic injury.
  Glutamate activates AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors resulting in
  Ca2+ influx and the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive (CaM) kinases which,
  in turn, activate the transcription factors cyclic AMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Genes induced by the latter transcription
  factor include those encoding BDNF, the DNA repair enzyme APE1, the master regulator
  of mitochondrial biogenesis PGC-1α, and the antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide
  dismutase (MnSOD). BDNF and insulin bind their respective receptor tyrosine kinases
  (trkB and the insulin receptor) resulting in the activation of the PI3 kinase and
  Akt kinase. BDNF also stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Some
  of the gene targets of BDNF include PGC-1α, APE1, and the anti-apoptotic protein
  Bcl-2. Insulin activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway to promote
  protein synthesis and cell growth. Finally, GLP-1 activates receptors (GLP-1R) coupled
  to cyclic AMP production, CREB activation and BDNF production.
