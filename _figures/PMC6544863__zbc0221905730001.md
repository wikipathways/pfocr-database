caption: 'Metabolic pathways for the catabolism of glucose and benzoate in P. putida
  KT2440. The reactions involved in initial glucose catabolism, initial benzoate catabolism,
  PP pathway, ED pathway, reverse EMP pathway, downstream ED pathway, TCA cycle, glyoxylate
  shunt, and anapleurosis/gluconeogenesis are grouped, respectively, in purple, light
  brown, green, blue, light green, light orange, dark orange, and gray boxes. The
  arrows indicate unidirectionality or bidirectionality of the metabolic reactions.
  The gene annotated to each metabolic protein is placed next to the corresponding
  reaction arrow; the ORF number is given when gene annotation is not known. The full
  names of the metabolic proteins are listed in Table S1 (Appendix C). The metabolite
  abbreviations are as follows: glucose, Gluc; gluconate, 2K-Glucn; glucose-6-phosphate,
  ribulose 5-phosphate, Ru5P; erythrose 4-phosphate, E4P; 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate,
  KDPG; 1,3-biphosphoglycerate, 1,3-bisPG; 3-phosphoglycerate, 3PG; 2-phosphoglycerate,
  2PG; acetyl-CoA, Ac-CoA; succinyl CoA, succ-CoA; 4-ketoadipate-enol-lactone, 4KAEL.'
papertitle: Multi-omics analysis unravels a segregated metabolic flux network that
  tunes co-utilization of sugar and aromatic carbons in Pseudomonas putida.
