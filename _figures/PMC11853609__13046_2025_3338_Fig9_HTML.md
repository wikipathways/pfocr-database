caption: A schematic model of the mechanism by which PHF8 promotes malignant phenotypes
  and immune escape of KRAS- or BRAF-mutant CRC cells. Briefly, PHF8 downregulates
  the expression of MHC and interferon regulatory genes. On the other hand, PHF8 upregulates
  PD-L1 by remodeling histone modifications within its promoter, thereby leading to
  immune escape. Similarly, PHF8 also upregulates the expression of KRAS, BRAF, and
  c-Myc by remodeling histone modifications within their promoters to activate the
  MAPK/ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway. Thus, PHF8 may be a potential therapeutic target
  for KRAS- or BRAF-mutant CRCs. In addition, c-Myc can upregulate PHF8 at the post-transcriptional
  levels by downregulating miR-22-3p, while PHF8 in turn promotes c-Myc expression
  to form a positive feedback loop, ultimately promoting the malignant phenotypes
  and immune escape of KRAS- or BRAF-mutant CRC cells. Red asterisk represents mutant
  KRAS or BRAF
