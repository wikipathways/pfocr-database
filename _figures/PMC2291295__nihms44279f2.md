caption: The two primary survival pathways involve activation of a mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and activation of Akt. Integrin-mediated interactions
  with matrix proteins, particularly laminin 5, as well as signaling through epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR), lead to sequential phosphorylation and activation
  of MAPKs. The precise mechanism(s) by which activated MAPK kinases (MEKs) promote
  cell survival is not known (dotted arrows). Signaling by epidermal growth factor
  (EGF) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) may also stimulate a second survival pathway
  involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to phosphorylation and activation
  of Akt. Activated Akt promotes survival by activating the transcriptional regulator
  NF-κB and counteracts apoptosis by phosphorylating and inhibiting Bad and caspase-9.
  Caspase-9 is also subject to inhibition by IAP proteins. Finally, signaling by nerve
  growth factor (NGF) stabilizes levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.
  ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase.
