caption: Pathway diagram of the genes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Statistically
  significant genes (p < 0.01) (between critically ill and healthy controls) are coloured
  in either red or green. Red colour denotes up-regulation, and green colour denotes
  down-regulation. Lines with one-direction arrow (i.e. irreversible reaction) represent
  key regulatory control steps of the pathway. Lines with arrows on both directions
  denote reversible reactions determined by mass effect (i.e. forward and backward
  reaction can occur depending on substrate concentration)
