  unspecific contributor AATAi (see Tableand Supporting Additional file: Text S1 Table

  production pathway starting from tryptophan and involving the unspecific contributor
  2OXOADPTm (see Table  and Supporting Additional file : Text S1 Table S2) among other
  more specific contributions. Dashed lines indicate the threshold used for the GIMME
  computations.'
