caption: An outline of the inhibition of type I IFN signaling pathways by viral proteins
  of KSHV. Following KSHV infection of cells, specific TLRs are activated, initiating
  the recruitment of adaptor proteins, MyD88 and TRIF. Subsequently, it leads to the
  activation of TBK1 and IKKε, which phosphorylate IRF3. IRF3 then dimerizes and translocates
  to the nucleus and participates in the transcriptional activation of the IFN-β promoter.
  Binding of newly secreted IFN-β to the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1) leads to the
  activation of the JAK-STAT, resulting in forming thee ISGF3 complex. ISGF3 binds
  to ISRE found in numerous IFN-induced gene promoters, like IRF7. Newly synthesized
  IRF7 is phosphorylated by TBK1 and IKKε, which can then homodimerize or heterodimerize
  with IRF3 before binding to the promoters of the genes that encode IFN-α/β. Moreover,
  dsDNA accumulates in the cytoplasm after infection by KSHV. The intracellular DNA
  recognized by cytoplasmic receptor, IFI16 and cGAS. Alternatively, dsDNA is transcribed
  into dsRNA by polymerase III in cell-type specific manner. Generated dsRNA is recognized
  by RIG-1 and production of type I IFNs are induced. Following DNA stimulation, an
  ER protein STING translocates from the ER to the cytoplasmic punctate structure
  and subsequently it recruits TBK1 and IKKε. Among the KSHV-encoded proteins, numerous
  proteins target this pathway. Black squares indicate KSHV proteins.
