caption: Myogenic differentiation. SCs are myogenic progenitors and are localized
  in hypoxic niches near the muscle basal membrane. Following muscle injury, quiescent
  SCs (PAX7+ and MYF5+/−) are activated and differentiate into myoblasts (PAX7+, MYF5+,
  and MYOD+). After their proliferation cycle, myoblasts differentiate into myocytes
  (PAX7−, MYOD+, MYOG+, and MRF4+). Finally, myocytes fuse together to form multinucleated
  myotubes (MYOG+, MRF4+, and MHC+). The satellite stem cell subpopulation (PAX7+
  and MYF5−) can proceed to self-renewal to replenish the SC pool. HIF-1α pathway
  activation was found critical to maintain SC quiescence []. It was associated to
  an enhanced myogenic factor activation, an increased number of PAX7+ cells, a more
  rapid macrophage recruitment after a myotrauma [] and could promote myogenesis by
  increasing Myod expression through the WNT pathway [].
