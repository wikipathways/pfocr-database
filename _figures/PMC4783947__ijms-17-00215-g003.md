caption: 'Cell-type dependent regulation of AKT S473 phosphorylation by LPA: (A) Knockdown
  of RICTOR using a specific siRNA disrupts kinase activity of mTORC2. In MCF7 cells
  (breast cancer cells) this abrogates phosphorylation on Ser473 located in the AKT
  hydrophobic motif; (B) The same approach has no affect on AKT Ser473 phosphorylation
  in Hela cells (cervical cancer cells). This indicates the presence of an alternate
  pathway(s) and reflects different LPA receptor expression pattern in these cells;
  This pathway utilizes another, yet unidentified, kinase (marked with ?) for the
  Ser473 phosphorylation than mTORC2.'
