caption: Target TSCM cells to treat human diseases. TSCM cells can exacerbate human
  disease. Left, treat TSCM-driven diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, HIV, etc.,
  by blocking the production of TSCM. The expression of CCR5 promotes the infection
  of TSCM cells with HIV. Viral restriction factors and vaccines can target TSCM cells
  to treat HIV. Blocking the mTORC1 pathway promotes the self-renewal and differentiation
  of TSCM. Right, TSCM cells are expanded in vitro by adding cytokines, CAR modification,
  immune checkpoint blocking, and gene editing. Stars represent cells latently infected
  with HIV.
