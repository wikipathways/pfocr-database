caption: Regulators of cereal inflorescence development. (A) Inflorescence meristem
  regulators include the receptor and receptor-like proteins TD1/FON1, FEA2, and FEA3.
  These proteins perceive secreted CLE peptides, including ZmCLE7/FON4 and ZmFCP1.
  Perception of CLE peptides restricts ZmWUS activity. Downstream signaling components
  of FEA2 include CT2, ZmCRN, and ZmGB1. The rice DEP1 G protein also contributes
  to inflorescence meristem regulation through OsCKX2, though it is unclear if it
  acts in the CLV signaling pathway. (B) Lateral meristem regulators include TB1/TaTB1,
  D53, OsSPL14/UB2/UB3, OsSPL7, OsSPL17, GT1, and RA2. Inflorescence development and
  architecture of maize (C), wheat (D), and rice (E). IM, inflorescence meristem;
  SPM, spikelet pair meristem; SM, spikelet meristem; FM, floral meristem; BM, branch
  meristem.
