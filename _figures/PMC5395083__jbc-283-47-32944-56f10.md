caption: Model for the role of ErbB4 in synapse maturation and neurite morphology.
  A, postsynaptic ErbB4 expression modulates the maturation of presynaptic compartments
  through a mechanism that is dependent upon the extracellular domain of ErbB4. Two
  possible ways by which ErbB4 may regulate presynaptic maturation are illustrated
  1) by binding directly to NRG1 type I/II in the presynaptic compartment and 2) through
  direct interaction with protein X, possibly through PDZ-dependent interactions,
  which recruits postsynaptic protein Y, which in turn directly binds unknown presynaptic
  protein Z. B, binding of soluble NRG1 (sNRG1) to ErbB4 activates the ErbB4 receptor
  tyrosine kinase (TK), activating the PI3K pathway and inducing cytoskeleton reorganization
  and dendrite arborization.
