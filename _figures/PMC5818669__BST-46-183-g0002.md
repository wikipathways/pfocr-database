caption: (i) The P450 is in a low-spin ferric resting form with its heme iron axially
  co-ordinated by cysteine thiolate and a H2O molecule. (ii) Substrate (fatty acid)
  binding displaces the axial water and converts the heme iron from low-spin to a
  high-spin form. (iii) Peroxygenase P450s use the peroxide shunt pathway that bypasses
  the need for external electrons, and interaction with H2O2 facilitates direct conversion
  of the substrate-bound, high-spin P450 to the ferric-hydroperoxo species (compound
  0) (iv). Subsequent protonation and dehydration steps yield the reactive ferryl
  (FeIV)-oxo porphyrin radical cation (compound I) (v), as observed in rapid mixing
  studies of OleT with perdeuterated arachidic acid substrate []. (vi) Compound I
  abstracts a hydrogen atom from the Cβ position, resulting in formation of a substrate
  radical and the ferryl (FeIV)-hydroxo species (compound II) []. (vii) Decarboxylation
  of the fatty acid occurs through subsequent one-electron oxidation of the substrate
  by compound II to generate a substrate diradical species or a carbocation. (viii)
  The reactive species can readily eliminate CO2, with formation of the Cα–Cβ double
  bond and generation of a terminal alkene. The simultaneous recruitment of a proton
  to the heme restores the resting, distal water-ligated state of the P450. There
  is competition between the ‘radical rebound’ reaction in which (a) compound II transfers
  a hydroxyl radical to the substrate radical to form a hydroxylated fatty acid and
  the alkene-producing reaction in which (b) compound II abstracts a substrate electron
  to initiate fatty acid decarboxylation. The decarboxylase reaction dominates in
  OleT for longer chain substrates, although significant levels of hydroxylation are
  seen with short chain fatty acids. The P450 heme (illustrated by the iron in the
  relevant oxidation state and equatorial/axial bonds) is shaded to approximate the
  color of the relevant heme intermediate species.
