caption: CYLD-associated signaling pathways. NF-kB, Wnt/β-catenin, and JNK pathways
  have been shown to be regulated by CYLD. The canonical NF-kB signaling pathway has
  been shown to be regulated by CYLD through deubiquitination of target substrates
  such as RIP1, the TAK1 complex and NEMO []. In the non-canonical NF-kB signaling
  pathway, deubiquitination of Bcl-3 by CYLD results in the inhibition of cyclin D1
  gene expression []. Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been shown to be regulated by CYLD,
  via deubiquitination of the (disheveled) DVL protein []. The JNK signaling pathway
  has been demonstrated to be regulated by CYLD activity through unknown mechanisms
  likely involving TRAF2 and MKK7 []. In addition, the Notch/Hes1 pathway and the
  Hedgehog signaling have been shown to regulate transcription of CYLD, via suppression
  of CYLD transcription by Hes1 and snail1, respectively [, ]. Blue arrows indicate
  nuclear translocation of the proteins. The lower grey box shows the published signaling
  changes and likely consequences of CYLD deficiencies due to CYLD knockout, CYLD
  silencing by siRNA or shRNA or CYLD mutation. Red arrows indicate that the nuclear
  translocation of the indicated proteins was found to be increased. Potential therapeutic
  targets due to CYLD aberrations are highlighted in red within the lower grey box
