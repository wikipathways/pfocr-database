caption: 'Our multi-omics integrative analysis of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway
  in P. trichocarpa predicts wood properties for wood utilization. The pathway is
  represented by 21 monolignol genes (turquoise circles) identified from the genome
  sequence, and their corresponding transcripts (blue circles) and proteins (red circles).
  The gene transcript abundances can be converted to protein abundances by specific
  βi values from linear regression models (Supplementary Table ). The monolignol proteins
  in a metabolic grid convert phenylalanine to monolignols in stem-differentiating
  xylem. The metabolic grid consists of 24 metabolites (underlined numbers within
  structures), 37 reaction fluxes (white numbers on black circles), 104 reaction kinetic
  parameters and 103 inhibition kinetic parameters. Other enzymes, regulators, and
  components are involved but genes encoding these factors are unknown or not yet
  sufficiently characterized to be included in this study. Fluxes 16, 20, 21, and
  26 were set to zero because kinetic parameters for these reactions are not currently
  available. Colored lines represent pathway enzyme inhibitions. Multiple linear regressions
  predict the lignin and wood properties. Abbreviations: Reduced nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADP+), coenzyme A (CoA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine monophosphate
  (AMP), pyrophosphate (PPi), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)'
