caption: Mechanisms of fatty acid metabolic reprogramming. De novo lipogenesis and
  exogenous uptake of fatty acid both occur to sustain the altered lipid metabolism
  in cancer cells. The transporters CD36, FATPs, and FABPpm regulate exogenous fatty
  acid import. Increased CD36 and FATP expression is reported in various cancers.
  The oncogenic PI3K/Akt pathway is activated to regulate fatty acid metabolism. Activation
  of SREBPs is key in de novo lipogenesis and catabolism of imported fatty acids.
