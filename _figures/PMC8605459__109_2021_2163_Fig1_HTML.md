caption: Representations of ligand-dependent AHR activation pathways. Inactive AHR
  is localized at the cytoplasm complexed to some chaperones and other elements (HSP90,
  XAP2, p23, c-Src). Upon ligand binding, conformational changes allow AHR to translocate
  to the nucleus, where it dissociates from its chaperone complex. Depending on the
  ligand, AHR can follow either ARNT-dependent or ARNT-independent pathways. In the
  ARNT-dependent pathways, the AHR-ligand complex dimerizes with its binding partner
  ARNT. The ligand-AHR-ARNT complex will activate or repress the expression of different
  genes depending on the type of ligand. Canonical pathway (left side). AHR binding
  to Kyn, HAH (e.g., dioxin), or PAH (e.g., B[a]P) activates the canonical pathway;
  the dimer AHR-ARNT binds to xenobiotic response elements (XRE) and drives the expression
  of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such as CYP1A1, the prototypical target gene
  of AHR. The AHR-ARNT complex promotes gene expression by recruiting several components
  of the transcriptional machinery and fulfilled this function; AHR activity ends
  by the dissociation of the complex from the DRE to be exported from the nucleus,
  where it enrolls in ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation []. Moreover, a negative
  regulatory feedback mechanism is present, with the induction of AHR repressor (AHRR)
  gene, capable of competing with AHR for ARNT, originating a transcriptionally inactive
  heterodimer, thus repressing AHR transcriptional activity []. Alternative pathway
  (center). AHR binding to polyphenols such as resveratrol or quercetin activates
  the alternative pathway by binding to alternative xenobiotic response elements such
  as the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory paraoxonase 1 (PON-1). Other non-canonical
  pathways (right side) include alternative REs of alternative AHR-ARNT related transcriptional
  responses also observed in tyrosine hydroxylase [], a precursor enzyme in the synthesis
  of dopamine and catecholamines, Bax, an apoptosis regulator gene [], and in TGF-β
  []. Also, the AHR can bind to other non-ARNT binding partners, like the Kruppel-like
  factor 6 (KLF6) or the NF-kB subunits RelA or RelB. ALHD3, aldehyde dehydrogenase
