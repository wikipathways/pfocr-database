caption: HCoV viral proteins on innate immunity. During HCoV infection, PRRs such
  as TLRs, RIG-I and MDA5 are activated to trigger a series of signalling pathway,
  including MAPK and NF-κB, for IFN production. These IFNs then act on IFNAR and activate
  the JAK-STAT signalling pathway to induce ISGs. The yellow-orange boxes show the
  viral proteins that have been reported to modulate host innate immunity at multiple
  stages.
