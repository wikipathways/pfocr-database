caption: The TRIM8, NF-κB and JAK-STAT pathways. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα
  e IL-1β) promote NF-κB activation through TRIM8. In the nucleus, TRIM8 promotes
  the translocation of PIAS3 in the cytoplasm where it is then degraded. PIAS3 in
  the nucleus interacts with RelA (alias p65) preventing NF-κB activation. Moreover,
  TRIM8 promotes TAK1 Lys63- linked polyubiquitination leading to IKK kinase activation.
  IκBα phosphorylation mediated by IKK leads to its degradation and NF-κB translocation
  in the nucleus. TAK1 also induces the activating phosphorylation of downstream MAPK/p38
  and JNK signaling pathways. Long non-coding RNA Nespas directly interacts with TAK1
  and inhibits TRIM8-induced Lys63- linked polyubiquitination. Furthermore, TRIM8
  induces the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway promoted by IFN-γ through the degradation
  of two STAT protein inhibitors, PIAS3 and SOCS-1.
