caption: Resting immune cells, such as monocytes or T cells primarily produce energy
  (ATP) from breaking down glucose into pyruvate, and through mitochondrial oxidative
  phosphorylation. The activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) by microbes
  leads to the activation of the master transcription regulator NF-κB, which in turn
  results in inflammatory cytokine gene expression and production (e.g. IL-1β, TNF-α).
  Concurrently, cells also undergo a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis (a phenomenon
  also known as the Warburg effect), where energy production occurring through glycolysis
  breaks down glucose into succinate. Although less energy is produced for each glucose
  molecule, this pathway does provide large quantities of anabolic substrates necessary
  to feed into the high gene transcriptional activity occurring during immune activation.
  Succinate and NF-κB also stabilize the transcription factor HIF-1α, resulting in
  further upregulation of inflammatory cytokine gene expression. The shift away from
  oxidative phosphorylation also allows these cells to produce reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) more efficiently. By contrast, anti-inflammatory signaling (via STAT6) causes
  an increase in fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial biogenesis, and increased mitochondrial
  function. This metabolic shift towards fatty acid oxidation leads to upregulation
  of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10, TGF-β) and pro-resolving lipid mediators
  such as resolvins and protectins.
