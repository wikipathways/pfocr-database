caption: 'Activation of KIT, a receptor tyrosine kinase, leads to dual activation
  of the MAPK (NRAS, BRAF, MEK, ERK) and PI3K signaling pathways. The MAPK signaling
  pathway results in cell proliferation by activating cyclin-CDK complexes that promote
  cell cycle progression and gene transcription, as well as by influencing other transcriptional
  regulators. Signal output through the PI3K pathway leads to antagonism of apoptosis
  and increased cell growth and proliferation. The varying sizes of each protein in
  this figure are relative to the percentage of 262 cutaneous melanomas (the latest
  from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset) that harbor alterations (mutations, amplifications,
  homozygous deletions and mRNA up/downregulation) in each protein''s respective encoding
  gene. For example, BRAF is the largest because the BRAF gene has the highest burden
  of alterations among the 262 melanoma samples. Small-molecule, targeted therapies
  are listed next to target proteins. The following protein–gene associations were
  used when extracting data from the cancer genome atlas (those not listed share the
  same name): MEK–MAP2K1/2, ERK–MAPK3/1, Cyclin D1–CCND1, PI3K–PI3KCA, AKT–AKT3, p53–TP53,
  BIM–BCL2L11. Additionally, p14ARF and p16INK4A are alternative splice products of
  the same gene, CDKN2A.†Drugs approved by the US FDA for treatment of advanced melanoma.'
