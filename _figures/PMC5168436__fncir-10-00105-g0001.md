caption: Maladaptive corticostriatal synaptic plasticity mechanism in L-DOPA-induced
  dyskinesia (LID). Excess of dopamine (DA) abnormally stimulates D1 pathway with
  hyperphosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and uncontrolled
  activation of protein kinase A (PKA) that leads to hyperphosphorylation of DARPP32,
  which blocks PP-1 causing loss of synaptic depotentiation. PKA/DARPP-32 and ERK/mitogen-
  and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) signaling lead to phosphorylation of histone
  H3 in the nucleus, inducing changes in gene expression. Hyperactivation of ERK through
  convergent altered signaling pathways brings to increased inhibition of tuberous
  sclerosis complex (TSC)1/2, and consequent disinhibition of Rheb/Rhes, leading to
  excessive increase of signaling of mTORC1 that, in turn, exerts its long term effects
  through changes in protein synthesis. After chronic L-DOPA, cholinergic interneurons
  show increased phospho-ERK immunoreactivity and higher firing rates with increased
  release of acetylcholine (Ach). Striatal cGMP signaling is declined and activity-dependent
  LTD, which strictly relies on the nitric-oxide- (NO-) dependent activation of protein
  kinase G (PKG) is absent in LID.
