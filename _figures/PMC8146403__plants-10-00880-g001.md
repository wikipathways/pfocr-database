caption: Simplified presentation of the plant PR metabolism. Oxygenation activity
  of Rubisco within the chloroplast results in the generation of one molecule of 3-PGA
  and 2-PG each. While 3-PGA is metabolized in the CB cycle, 2-PG is degraded by the
  PR metabolism. Within the chloroplast, 2-PG is dephosphorylated by 2-PG phosphatase
  (PGLP). Formed glycolate is exported from the chloroplast by PLGG1 and BASS6 and
  enters the peroxisome by a yet unidentified (?) translocator. Glycolate oxidase
  (GOX1/2) generates glyoxylate and H2O2. The latter one is converted by catalase
  (CAT) activity into O2 and H2O. The PR intermediate glyoxylate is aminated by glutamate:glyoxylate
  aminotransferase (GGAT1) to yield glycine. Glutamate serves as a donor for the amino
  group. The peroxisomal importer for this amino acid but also glycine is to date
  unknown. Glycine needs to be imported by an unknown translocator into the mitochondrion.
  Here, the concerted action of the multienzyme system glycine decarboxylase (GDC)
  and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) results in release of CO2 and NH3 from
  one molecule of glycine but also conversion of another molecule of glycine into
  serine. The substrate(s) of the transporter À BOU DE SOUFFLE (BOU) are unclear.
  BOU is likely involved in mitochondrial glutamate transport and functionally linked
  with glycine-to-serine conversion. Export of serine from the mitochondrion is facilitated
  by an unknown transporter protein. This applies also to the import into the peroxisome.
  Serine is deaminated by serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT1) to form hydroxypyruvate.
  For the subsequent reduction of this intermediate to glycerate, hydroxypyruvate
  reductase 1 (HPR1) depends on NADH, which is provided by the oxidation of OAA into
  malate. NAD+ is basically imported into peroxisome by the peroxisomal NAD carrier
  PXN. Glycerate leaves the peroxisome by an unknown mechanism and imported into the
  chloroplast by PLGG1. The concluding step in the PR pathway is the phosphorylation
  of glycerate and formation of 3-PGA by glycerate kinase (GLYK). 3-PGA enters the
  CB cycle. The dicarboxylate translocators DiT1 and Dit2.1 function as two-translocator
  system for the refixation of NH4+ in the chloroplast by the GS/FdGOGAT system. Further
  details are given in the main body.
