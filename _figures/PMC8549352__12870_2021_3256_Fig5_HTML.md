caption: Overview of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway and involvement of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in Paphiopedilum hirsutissimum flower. Heatmaps were generated
  using Log2FC based on FPKM values and the DEGs encoding specific enzymes are denoted
  in blue color. In scale bar, red color shows upregulation, white color shows downregulation,
  and orange color means no change. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarateCoA
  ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavone 3-hydroxylase
  (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS), dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR), and UDP-flavonoid
  glucosyl transferase (UFGT), and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX). NL, normal
  labellum; NP, normal petal; AL, albino labellum; AP, albino petal
