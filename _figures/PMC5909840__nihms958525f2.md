caption: 'Using Reactome FI, a gene network was created using 322 genes with significant
  alterations in 5-hmC. Linker genes are shown as diamonds, while the 322 target genes
  are depicted with circles (a). The network was clustered into six modules and pathway
  enrichment analysis was performed. To correct for multiple comparisons, false discovery
  rate p values were calculated (p < 0.05). Significantly enriched pathways within
  each module are listed with p values (b). Like terms were combined (Neurodegenerative
  disease: Huntington disease, Parkinson’s disease, and AD; Synapse signaling: dopaminergic,
  serotoninergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic synapse signaling) and the least
  significant FDR was reported (╪).'
