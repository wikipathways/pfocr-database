caption: '(A) A schematic showing a model for NMBR-NPRC cross-signaling facilitated
  by BNP via the NMB-NMBR pathway. In response to histamine, NMB and BNP are released
  from primary afferents to activate NMBR and NPRC concurrently. Activation of NMBR
  by NMB at a low concentration may prime PLCβ signaling, whereas activation of NPRC
  by BNP stimulates Gai signaling, which in turn stimulates PLCβ to activate downstream
  Ca2+ signaling. (B) A hypothetic model depicting the respective roles of neuropeptides
  and glutamate in itch transmission. CQ itch is mediated in part by GRP-GRPR signaling
  independent of glutamatergic transmission. In contrast, histamine itch is mediated
  by NMB-NMBR signaling from primary afferents to NMBR neurons and by glutamatergic
  transmission from NMBR neurons to GRPR neurons. BNP facilitates NMB-NMBR signaling
  via NPRC independent of GRP-GRPR signaling but dependent on GRPR neurons. Glu: glutamate;
  GRP: gastrin-releasing peptide; BNP: B-type natriuretic peptide; NMB: neuromedin
