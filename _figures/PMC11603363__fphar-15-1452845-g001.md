caption: 'Schematic diagram of the pyroptosis pathways. Classical pyroptosis pathway:
  PAMPs and DAMPs activate inflammasomes and caspase-1. Caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD and
  pro-IL-1β/18. N-GSDMD perforates the cell membrane by forming nonselective pores,
  causing cell lysis and death. IL-1β/18 are released through the pores formed by
  N-GSDMD. Non-classical pyroptosis pathway: LPS derived from bacteria recognizes
  and activates caspase-11/4/5, leading to GSDMD cleavage, and triggering pyroptosis.
  In addition, caspase-4 also processes IL-18. GSDMC/E/B pathway: GSDMC: TNF-α induces
  the activation of caspase-8, which in turn cleaves GSDMD and GSDMC, triggering pyroptosis.
  GSDME: GzmB and caspase-3 cleave GSDME, triggering pyroptosis. GSDMB: GzmA and caspase-1/3/6/7
  cleave GSDMB. In addition, the full length GSDMB enhances the caspase-4-mediated
  GSDMD cleavage to induce pyroptosis. Notes: ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like
  protein containing a caspase recruitment domain; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular
  pattern; DAMP, damage-associated molecular pattern; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; GzmA, granzyme A; GzmB, granzyme B'
