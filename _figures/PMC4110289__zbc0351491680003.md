caption: EGFR signaling up-regulates glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.
  Intracellular concentration (pmol/million cells) of key metabolites involved in
  glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) after the inhibition of EGFR signaling
  is shown. Error bars indicate S.D. (n = 3). Total metabolites were extracted with
  methanol from HCC827, PC9 or H1975 cells treated with DMSO (blue) or erlotinib (red,
  1 μm) for 6 h. Representative metabolites such as glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), fructose
  1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  (DHAP), 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), pyruvate (PA), lactate
  (LA), 6-phosphogluconate (6PG), ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P), ribose 5-phosphate
  (R5P), and ATP are shown here. Others are listed in supplemental Table 1.
