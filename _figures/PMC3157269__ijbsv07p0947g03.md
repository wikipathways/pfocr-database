caption: Sensing the HP-PRRSV infection by host cell. PRRSV enters early endosomes
  but does not continue through the endocytic pathway to late endosomes . The ATP6V1B2
  gene, which encodes a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) that mediates acidification
  of endosomal organelles , facilitates the uncoating of the virus. Viral nucleic
  acids could be sensed by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) pathway or RIG-I pathway both
  of which lead to type-I IFN induction by activating IRF3 and IRF7, and to inflammatory
  cytokines expression by activating the MAPK signaling pathway. Several IFN-induced
  genes were upregulated during HP-PRRSV infection, even though no induction of type-I
  IFN was observed. Red background in the gene box indicates upregulation of the gene
  expression, green indicates downregulation, and white indicates no change of the
  gene expression. Fold changes of the differentially expressed genes are 1.94 (ATP6V1B2),
  0.31 (SARM1), 4.58 (IRF7), 1.79 (SOCS1), 1.59 (SBNO2), 1.81 (NMI), and 2.48 (STAT1),
  respectively.
