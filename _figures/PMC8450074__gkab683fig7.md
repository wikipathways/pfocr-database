caption: A model of how PfAP2-G5 programs the regulation cascade for gametocytogenesis
  in P. falciparum parasites. In the asexual cycle, PfAP2-G5 suppresses the pfap2-g
  gene to prevent the initiation of sexual commitment (left) via maintenance of the
  HP1-dependent heterochromatin structure at the pfap2-g gene locus. When it is removed
  from the upstream regulatory region of pfap2-g, sexual commitment is triggered by
  either NCC or SCC pathway upon pfap2-g gene activation, which is accompanied with
  local chromatin alteration. Subsequently, pfap2-g activates a set of early gametocyte
  (EG) genes (middle), but their transcription activities including pfap2-g itself
  will be suppressed by PfAP2-G5 during early gametocyte development, or parasite
  development is arrested (right).
