caption: Glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pyruvate metabolism and pathway
  for mannitol production are depicted. Production of mannitol by aerobically-grown
  cells under limiting oxygen and anaerobic glucose metabolism is highlighted in a
  grey box. The newly proposed pathway for the metabolism of lactate under aerobic
  conditions is indicated by thick dashed arrows. Anaerobic end-products are shown
  in dashed boxes. Enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism and aerobic lactate are
  shown in grey. LctP, lactate permease SACOL2363; nLDH, NAD+-dependent lactate dehydrogenase;
  iLDH, NAD+-independent lactate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex;
  PFL, pyruvate formate-lyase; ALS, α-acetolactate synthase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenas;
  PTA, phosphotransacetylase; AK, acetate kinase.
