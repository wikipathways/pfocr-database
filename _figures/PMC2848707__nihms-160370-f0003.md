caption: Schematic representation of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway in plants.
  All metabolic steps indicated by a plain arrow have been demonstrated in vitro.
  Activities are indicated in black boxes. Genes which have been cloned are indicated
  in dark grey ovals. The substrates for desaturation and fatty acid (FA) hydroxylase
  remain to be determined. Although ceramidase (CDase) activity has been detected,
  the substrate specificity remains to be characterized. Note that reverse CDase activity
  (RCDA) and CDase are activities from the same enzyme. LCB, long chain base; IPC,
  inositolphospho ceramide.
