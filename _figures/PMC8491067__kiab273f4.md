caption: Metabolomic landscape of heterosis for six agronomic traits. The landscape
  of heterosis was created by the overlapping metabolic pathways between traits. All
  the significantly enriched pathways from amino acid metabolism were positively correlated
  with heterosis of grain weight, and all the pathways from carbohydrate metabolism
  were negatively correlated. Similarly, four of six significantly enriched pathways
  from amino acid metabolism displayed positive correlations with heterosis of seed
  setting rate, and one out of four pathways from carbohydrate metabolism displayed
  a negative correlation. Eight significantly enriched pathways for grain number (namely,
  zeatin biosynthesis, two pathways in amino acid metabolism, and five in carbohydrate
  metabolism) showed negative relationships, and the pentose phosphate pathway showed
  a positive correlation. Only one pathway was significantly enriched for tiller heterosis,
  and the metabolite levels of pentose and glucuronate interconversions were positively
  correlated with tiller heterosis. In contrast to the above-mentioned correlation
  patterns, five out of six significantly enriched pathways in amino acid metabolism
  showed negative correlations with heterosis of PH, and three out of four pathways
  in carbohydrate metabolism showed positive correlations. Pearson correlation analysis
  was performed based on the metabolite levels of the significantly enriched pathways,
  and a correlation was significant when the P <0.05. Positive and negative correlations
  are indicated in different colors. The metabolic pathways from different types are
  marked correspondingly. Purple and green arrows indicate high-BPH hybrids with high
  or low metabolite levels, respectively. Numbers in brackets represent percentages
  of regulated pathways from amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism.
