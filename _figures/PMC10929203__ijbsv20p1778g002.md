caption: Exosomes in psoriasis pathogenesis. In psoriasis, keratinocyte exosomes promote
  neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression
  in neutrophils via activating the NF-κB and p38/MAPK pathway and promote their proliferation
  and M1 polarization of macrophages via transferring miR-4505. Neutrophil exosomes
  containing olfactomedin 4 activate NF-κB and MAPK pathway in keratinocytes to promote
  expression of IL-1β, IL-36G, IL-18, TNF-α, and C-X-C motif chemokine ligands (CCLs).
  Macrophage exosomes manipulated the asymmetric division of keratinocytes via activating
  the Par3/mInsc/LGN signaling pathway. Mast cell-released exosomes transferred cytoplasmic
  PLA2 to CD1a-reactive psoriatic T cells inducing the production of IL-22 and IL-17A
  in psoriasis patients. In conclusion, exosome-mediated communication between activated
  keratinocytes and infiltrated immune cells contributes to the progression of psoriasis
