caption: MEKi treatment (B) reduces pERK levels and leads to increased cell death.
  In contrast, PI3K inhibition (C) initially reduces AKT signaling but this reduction
  leads to enhanced expression of RTKs including IR, IGFR1, EphA10, EphA7, ErbB2 and
  ErbB3 presumably through relief of inhibition of FOXO proteins. Increased expression
  of these RTKs leads to their increased activation (likely through receptor homo-
  or heterodimerization) which in turn, stimulates rebound activation of MEK-ERK pathway
  which in turn, enhances survival and development of resistance. Combined inhibition
  of PI3K and MEK (D) prevents rebound activation of ERK in response to PI3K single
  agent treatment and helps overcomes resistance.
