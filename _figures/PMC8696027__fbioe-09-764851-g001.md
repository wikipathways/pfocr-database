caption: Establishment of a high throughput screening method for identifying new target
  genes of the A. thaliana cDNA library to improve the functional expression of P450s.
  (A) The betaxanthin biosynthetic pathway starting from L-tyrosine, including a P450
  enzyme (CYP76AD1, shown in red) and an L-DOPA dioxygenase (DOD). CYP76AD1 has been
  determined to be rate-limiting for betaxanthin production, indicating that the production
  of betaxanthin (yellow color or fluorescence) can function as a biosensor for the
  expression level of CYP76AD1. (B) Workflow of the genome-scale engineering experiments.
  The A. thaliana cDNA overexpression library was introduced into the betaxanthin-producing
  yeast (yJS1256, biosensor strain) via in vivo homologous recombination. Clones with
  obvious color changes were selected and inoculated into SCD-URA medium in 96 deep-well
  plates and the fluorescence intensities were measured using a microplate reader.
  Then the isolated plasmids were re-transformed into the biosensor strain and the
  corresponding genes were identified by DNA sequencing.
