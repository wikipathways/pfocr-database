caption: Mechanisms of bile acid regulation of bile acid synthesis. In the liver,
  activation of FXR by agonists induces SHP to inhibit CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 gene transcription.
  TCA activates S1PR2 and may inhibit CYP7A1 via the ERK1/2 pathway. In the intestine,
  TCDCA activates FXR to induce FGF15, which is transported to hepatocytes to activate
  FGFR4/β-Klotho receptor, which stimulates the JNK/cJun and ERK1/2 pathways to inhibit
  CYP7A1 and CYP8B1. In the brain, growth hormone (GH) activates STAT5 signaling to
  activate TGR5 signaling to induce CYP7B1 in male mice and regulate the alternative
  bile acid synthesis pathway. In the intestine, TLCA activates TGR5 in L cells to
  stimulate GLP-1 secretion, which increases insulin sensitivity by stimulating insulin
  secretion from pancreatic β-cells.
