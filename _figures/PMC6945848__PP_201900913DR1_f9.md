caption: Model of the H2Bub1 mechanism used to regulate defense responses to Vd-toxins
  in Arabidopsis. In this model, HUB-mediated H2Bub1 regulates the expression of the
  NADPH oxidase RbohD and WRKY33 by enhancing the enrichment of H3K4me3 in response
  to Vd-toxins. H2Bub1 also affects posttranscriptional MAPK signaling. H2Bub1 is
  required for the activation of MPK3 and MPK6. Phosphorylation of WRKY33 by MPK3
  and MPK6 regulates the expression of RbohD. Moreover, MPK3 and MPK6 associate with
  PTPs, which negatively regulate H2O2 production. The PTP-MPK3/6-WRKY pathway regulates
  H2O2 signals in the responses against Vd-toxins in Arabidopsis.
