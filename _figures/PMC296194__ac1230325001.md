caption: The pathway of Tet(O)-mediated tetracycline release is illustrated by cryo-EM
  reconstructions of ribosomes in various functional states (, ). The natural elongation
  cycle is represented by reactions a to e, such that if the ribosome is in the posttranslocational
  state (POST), a ternary complex of EF-Tu-aa-tRNA-GTP can decode the codon presented
  on the mRNA in the A site (reaction a). After correct codon-anticodon interaction,
  the GTPase activity of EF-Tu is triggered and the aa-tRNA is accommodated into the
  A site (reaction b), yielding a pretranslocational ribosome (PRE). After accommodation,
  the amino group of the A site-bound aa-tRNA attacks the ester bond of the P site-bound
  peptidyl-tRNA, thereby forming a peptide bond in a reaction called peptidyl transfer
  (reaction c). Following peptide bond formation, EF-G binds to the ribosome and promotes
  translocation of the tRNAs from the A and P sites to the P and E sites (reactions
  d and e), thus completing a single cycle and returning the ribosome to a POST state.
  Upon tetracycline binding (reaction f), the ribosome allegedly enters a nonproductive
  cycle illustrated by reactions i and j (). In this cycle, the ternary complex repeatedly
  tries to bind aa-tRNA to the A site but fails. Tet(O) is able to rescue the ribosome
  from this nonproductive cycle by releasing tetracycline from its binding site on
  the 30S subunit (reaction g). After promoting the release of tetracycline, Tet(O)
  hydrolyzes its bound GTP and disassociates from the ribosome (reaction h), thereby
  returning the ribosome to the elongation cycle (reactions a to e). This figure has
