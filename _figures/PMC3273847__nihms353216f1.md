caption: Pathogens are recognized by the host APCs through TLRs, which induce intracellular
  signaling mainly through two adapter molecules, myeloid differentiation factor 88
  (MyD88) or Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β
  (TRIF). While MyD88 is used by most TLRs, the TRIF pathway can be exclusively induced
  by TLR4 and TLR3. The MyD88 pathway strongly induces NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory
  cytokine secretion associated with pathogen clearance []. The TRIF pathway, on the
  other hand, induces type I IFNs and slower NF-κB activation [,]. On the other hand,
  pathogens can be recognized by NLRs in the cytosol, which assemble a protein complex
  named inflammasome to activate caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 induces cellular apoptosis
  and promotes secretion of IL-1β and IL-18.
