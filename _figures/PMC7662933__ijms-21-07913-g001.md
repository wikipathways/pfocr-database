caption: Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRI) signaling. Scheme of the
  principal signaling pathways downstream to mGluR1 and mGluR5, showing Gq/11-dependent
  activation of phospholipase C β (PLCβ), which mediates the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
  and generation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), that
  fosters Ca2+ intracellular mobilization from internal stores. Protein kinase C (PKC),
  also activated by DAG, is involved in the stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), affecting gene expression. mGluR1/5, through Gq/11-dependent mechanisms,
  also induce the opening of transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs), mainly
  responsible for mGluR1/5-mediated excitatory currents. Additionally, G protein-independent
  mechanisms primarily involve recruitment of β-arrestin, which mediates effectors
  anchoring and activation of other signaling pathways, like phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) kinase pathway, which
  affects protein synthesis, cell growth and survival. Homer 1b/c isoforms allow formation
  of multimolecular protein complexes, which bridge mGluR1/5 with various intracellular
  effectors or ligand-gated receptors, like NMDARs, while Homer 1a isoforms antagonize
  Homer 1b/c interactions, thus affecting mGluR1/5 signaling and functions.
