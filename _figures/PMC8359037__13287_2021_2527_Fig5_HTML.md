caption: The BMP signalling pathway in HFSCs. The BMP pathway is initiated by a BMP
  dimer connecting with a specific receptor. Then, the dimer phosphorylates and activates
  R-Smad (Smads 1/5/8), which subsequently associate with the co-Smad partner Smad
  4. The T-shaped lines indicate inhibitory interactions involved in this pathway,
  and the solid arrows indicate activating interactions
