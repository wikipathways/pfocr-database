caption: Crosstalk between primordial follicle activation and DDR pathway. Receptor
  protein tyrosine kinase (RPTK) Kit and its ligand activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K) and as a response to this activation, the catalytic subunits of PI3K, p85
  and p110, will be activated. In turn, it converts phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-bisphosphate (PIP3), which then serves as the
  second messenger to enable phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) activation.
  Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) reverses this process
  and increases PIP2 expression. PDK1 and Akt are recruited through binding of their
  pleckstrin homology (PH) domains to PIP3, leading to phosphorylation of protein
  kinase B (Akt) by PDK1. Akt activation consequently triggers phosphorylation of
  forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) resulting in cytoplasmic localisation of this transcription
  factor. Increased in Akt activity also induces phosphorylation of mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex I (mTORC1) through inactivation of tuberous sclerosis complex
  1 and 2 (TSC 1, 2). S6 protein kinase (S6K) activity is then upregulated and simultaneously
  triggers phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6). Meanwhile, high intracellular
  levels of Akt have been reported to increase DNA damage, repress nuclear translocation
  of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) and compromise homologous recombination
  (HR) in breast cancer cells.
