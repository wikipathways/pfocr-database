caption: The NO-cGMP pathway. HU acts as a NO donor in vivo and/or directly activates
  intracellular sGC. NO stimulates intracellular sGC to produce cGMP from guanosine-5′-triphosphate.
  Stimulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) by cGMP in erythroid lineage
  cells elevates HBG and fetal hemoglobin production and decreases leukocyte (WBC)
  adhesive mechanisms. PDE9 degrades intracellular cGMP to GMP and is highly expressed
  in hematopoietic cells. BAY73-6691 is a selective inhibitor of PDE9, and therefore
  elevates intracellular cGMP in cells that express the enzyme. PTIO is a radical
  scavenger for nitric oxide. L-NAME is an arginine analog that inhibits nitric oxide
  synthase activity. ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) is a selective
  inhibitor of sGC, whereas KT5823 selectively inhibits PKG.
