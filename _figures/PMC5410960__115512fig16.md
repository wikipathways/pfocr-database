caption: Top illustration shows disruptions in normal cell survival and normal apoptosis
  in glioblastoma. A combination of pro–cell survival and antiapoptotic events triggers
  resistance to death-inducing stimuli, and increased activity of PI3K—by way of extracellular
  factors (eg, EGF and PDGF) or inherently abnormal RTKs (eg, constitutively active
  EGFRvIII mutant)—leads to increased downstream pathway signaling effects. Decreased
  proapoptotic activity in the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways is a substantial
  contributor to enhanced survival. Bottom illustration shows therapeutic agents used
  to target contributors to cell survival and antiapoptosis, which overlap those used
  in antiangiogenesis and antiproliferation therapies and include receptor inhibitors
  and inhibitors of Akt and mTOR. Other newer strategies include targeting the apoptosis
  pathway with gossypol, adenoviral p53 therapy to restore tumor suppressor activity,
  and recombinant TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Bcl-2 = B-cell lymphoma
  2 oncogene, TNFR1 = tumor necrosis factor R1, TP53 = mutant tumor p53.
