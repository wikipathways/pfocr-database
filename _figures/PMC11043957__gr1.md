caption: 'Signaling pathways in radiation-induced lung injury. Radiation induces lung
  injury in these ways, showed in the figure. Under ionizing radiation, ROS are rapidly
  produced, and ROS can activate TGF-β. Activated TGF-β can bind to TGF-βRII, phosphorylating
  Smad2 and Smad3, which can form a complex with Smad4. Additionally, Radiation-induced
  ROS stimulates downstream signaling via the ERK/GSK-3β/snail axis. Increased GSK-3β
  then activates TGF-β and leads to an increase in β-catenin levels, which maintains
  stemness of type II AEC and promotes its differentiation into fibroblasts. IGFBP7
  is enhanced by TGF-β and is involved in the EMT of AECs through the ERK signaling
  pathway. The complex can regulate gene expression to promote fibrosis. Activated
  HMGB1 leads to NF-kB into the nucleus and interacts with DNA, promoting TNF-α, IL-6,
  and IL-1 expression, which can cause lung inflammation.Abbreviations: ROS: Reactive
  oxygen species; HMGB1: High-mobility group box 1; TNF: Tumor necrosis factor; IL:
