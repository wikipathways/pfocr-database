caption: 'Activation of the ER-tethered stress sensors CREBH and IRE1α is regulated
  by the circadian clock. ER-to-Golgi transport and proteolytic cleavage of CREBH
  protein is regulated by the circadian clock through the BMAL1-AKT-GSK3β regulatory
  axis. Activated CREBH translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with circadian-regulated
  nuclear receptors (PPARα and LXRα) or transcriptional modulators (DBP and E4BP4)
  to regulate expression of genes involved in lipid utilization (FA oxidation, TG
  lipolysis, and ketogenesis) or storage (de novo lipogenesis) pathways. The circadian
  clock also regulates activation of the IRE1α-XBP1 UPR pathway, which regulates the
  UPR and potentially metabolic pathways. Abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  DBP, D-site-binding protein; E4BP4, E4-binding protein 4; GSK3β, glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 β; AKT, protein kinase B; LXRα, liver X receptor α.'
