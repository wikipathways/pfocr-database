caption: Diverse tissues participate in host defence in Caenorhabditis elegans. (a)
  The intestine (yellow) is a major immune organ. In it, insulin signalling regulates
  DAF-16/FOXO, a transcription factor involved in stress responses. A novel putative
  receptor, follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR-1), acts in the intestine
  to presumably regulate signal transduction cascades that control the expression
  of pathogen-induced genes. A signalling pathway originating in diacylglycerol (DAG),
  produced presumably by phospholipase C, involves the protein kinase C homologue
  TPA-1 and the protein kinase D homologue DKF-2 to activate the PMK-1/p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that controls host defence genes. A parallel pathway,
  including MEK-1 and the protein phosphatase VHP-1, modulates PMK-1 activity. (b)
  In the hypodermis, an epidermal tissue in C. elegans, a non-canonical transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β signalling pathway downstream of the heterodimeric TGF-β receptor
  formed by DAF-4 and SMA-6 regulates the SMAD homologue SMA-3 to control expression
  of caenacin genes (CNC) during infection with Drechmeria coniospora. In parallel,
  a pathway involving RACK-1 and GPA-12 (subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins), PLC-3
  and EGL-8 (phospholipase C homologues), TPA-1 and PKC-3 (protein kinase C homologues),
  the Tribbles-like kinase NIPI-3 and the PMK-1 cassette regulates the expression
  of neuropeptide-like peptides (NLP) also during D. coniospora infection. In this
  pathway, the death-associated protein kinase (DAPK-1) regulates the PMK-1 cascade
  negatively at the level of or upstream of the protein scaffold TIR-1 (Toll, interleukin
  receptor). (c) In neurones, secretion of insulin INS-7 down-regulates DAF-16 in
  the intestine. Secretion of TGF-β DBl-1 regulates the SMA-3 in the hypodermis. Also,
  a poorly understood pathway including TIR-1, NSY-1 and SEK-1 regulates the production
  of serotonin via TPH-1; this PMK-1-independent pathway thus controls the aversive
  learning behaviour following infection. (d) It remains unknown where the BAR-1/β-catenin–EGL-5/HOX
  pathway controlling host response gene induction is required. Similarly, the locus
  of CED-1 activity for the induction of non-canonical unfolded protein response (UPR)
  genes remains to be determined.
