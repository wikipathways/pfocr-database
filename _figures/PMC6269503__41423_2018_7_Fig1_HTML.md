caption: 'The Toll or TLR signaling pathway activates Hippo signaling in innate immune
  cells. Left: upon activation by gram-positive bacteria, the Toll-Myd88-Pelle cascade
  leads to the activation of Hippo signaling, which causes Yorkie (Yki) blockage and
  induction of Dorasl/Dif-mediated anti-microbial peptide expression in Drosophila.
  Right: upon TLR ligation, activated MST1/2 induces TRAF6-ECSIT complex assembly
  through PKCα and Rac, promoting ROS generation and bacterial killing. MST1/2 also
  regulates the expression and secretion of chemokines (such as CXCL1/2) through IRF3
  for anti-mycobacterial immunity. On the other hand, MST1/2 and its downstream effectors
  LATS/NDR limit pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and TNFα) production by inhibiting
  IRAK1/NF-κB and Mekk2, respectively. During viral infection, virus-activated kinase
  IKK phosphorylates YAP and targets it for degradation, while YAP/TAZ negatively
  regulates anti-viral immunity by blocking either TBK1 or IRF3 activity. Collectively,
  the Hippo pathway plays important roles in innate immunity against pathogens and
  protects the host from inflammatory injury during infection'
