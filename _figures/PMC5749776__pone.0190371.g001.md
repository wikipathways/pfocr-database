caption: (A) Proposed biosynthetic pathways for synthesis of fucose and N-acetylperosamine
  monomers. Genomic, enzyme, and pathway data [,] support a predicted synthesis pathway
  for conversion of the GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose and GDP-N-acetylperosamine. Synthesis
  of both monomers begins with a shared first step in which conversion of GDP-mannose
  to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose, is catalyzed by Gmd. The GDP-6-keto-6-deoyxmannose
  intermediate can be converted to GDP-fucose by Fcl or to GDP-N-acetylperosamine
  by PerA and Per B. Enzyme names are indicated in bold, gene names, and Enzyme Commission
  (EC) numbers are also indicated. PubChem CID numbers are provided for each predicted
  precursor/product. (B) The NA1000 genome encodes the enzymes necessary for conversion
  of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose or GDP-N-acetylperosamine in operons located at two
  positions in the genome. The first locus is contained within the mobile genetic
  element (MGE, orange) and the second on the chromosome (chr, green). The operon
  structure at each locus is unique, but both operons contain a predicted gmd (gmd2
  within the MGE and gmd1 on the chromosome). (C) The gmd2 gene (CCNA_00472) contained
  within the MGE is co-expressed in an operon with fcl (CCNA_00471) and an O-antigen
  polymerase (CCNA_00470) [], suggesting it is important for the synthesis of GDP-fucose.
  (D) The gmd1 (CCNA_01062) encoded on the chromosome is expressed in an operon with
  perA (CCNA_01064) and perB (CCNA_01063), as well as two predicted glycosyltransferases
  (CCNA_01065 and CCNA_1066) and the outer membrane transport protein rsaFa [], consistent
  with its role in synthesizing GDP-N-acetylperosamine.
