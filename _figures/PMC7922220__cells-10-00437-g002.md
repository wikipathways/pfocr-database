caption: 'Schematic representation of GnRH-II signaling in ovarian cancer cells assuming
  that a truncated GnRH-II receptor (A) or no GnRH-II receptor (B) exists. (A) Binding
  of GnRH-II agonists, GnRH-I antagonists and GnRH-II antagonists to the truncated
  GnRH-II receptor cause PTP activation leading to dephopsphorylation of activated
  EGF-R. In addition, GnRH-II antagonists induce apoptosis through activation of p38,
  JNK and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. GnRH-I agonists only couple to the GnRH-I
  receptor. Signal transduction mechanisms and further details are described in  and
  the text. (B) Signal transduction of GnRH-I and GnRH-II and their agonistic as well
  as antagonistic analogs through the GnRH-I-R if no GnRH-II-R exists. Signaling and
  details are described in the text. Abbreviations: AP-1, activator protein-1; Bax,
  B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGF-R,
  EGF receptor; ERK1/2, p44/42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase; GDP, guanosine
  diphosphate; GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  JunD, transcription factor JunD; P38, mitogen-activated protein kinase P38; PI3K,
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase. Signal transduction
  pathway affected by GnRH-I agonists, GnRH-I antagonists, and GnRH-II agonists are
  marked brown. GnRH-II antagonist-induced signaling is marked red.'
