caption: Working model of the EphA4–ephexin1 signaling pathway and BDNF-TrkB signaling
  pathway in the model of depression. Social defeat stress promotes the activation
  of EphA4–ephexin1 signaling, which mediates synaptic loss. The activation of EphA4
  by stress enhances the activity of Cdk5 via the phosphorylation of Cdk5 at Tyr15
  and ephexin1. The activation of Cdk5 at Tyr15 and Fyn promotes ephexin1 phosphorylation,
  thereby leading to decreased synaptogenesis and dendrite atrophy. Social defeat
  stress inhibits BDNF-TrkB signaling, which could mediate synaptic loss. Rhynchophylline
  attenuates the activation of EphA4–ephexin1 signaling and the inhibition of BDNF-TrkB
  signaling in mice with the depression-like phenotype. The inhibition of EphA4–ephexin1
  signaling can improve the decreased BDNF-TrkB signaling in depression, thereby improving
  the synaptic protein level. The inhibition of Cdk5 or absence of the Cdk5 activator
  p35 completely abolishes BDNF-induced spine formation and enlargement, so it is
  likely that Cdk5 may work downstream of BDNF-TrkB signaling.
