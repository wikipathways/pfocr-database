caption: Cellular stress/injury models impacted by O-GlcNAcylation. Stress-induced
  changes in O-GlcNAc-cycling and O-GlcNAc–mediated cytoprotection have been observed
  in a broad range of environmental and physiological models. While global changes
  in O-GlcNAc levels are detected (both increased and decreased) in response to injury,
  protein specific studies identify a more nuanced model in which O-GlcNAc is cycled
  on and off proteins differentially. That is, while global levels of O-GlcNAc are
  increased, O-GlcNAcylation can be reduced on a subset of proteins. Similarly, in
  models where global O-GlcNAc levels are decreased, an elevation of O-GlcNAcylation
  is observed on a subset of proteins. Nonetheless, in all these models manipulating
  O-GlcNAc impacts survival, specifically acutely depressing O-GlcNAc promotes cell
  death, whereas acutely increasing O-GlcNAc augments survival. One interpretation
  of these data is that loss of O-GlcNAc on a subset of proteins promotes cell death,
  whereas elevation of O-GlcNAc on others promotes cell survival pathways. OGA, O-GlcNAcase;
