caption: Core central carbon metabolism pathways that impact Mtb drug sensitivity.
  Carbon sources that feed into Mtb central carbon metabolism are listed in blue boxes.
  Carbon flowing down the pathway from glucose toward pyruvate, indicated by the downward
  pointing arrows, is glycolysis, whereas the reverse pathway, indicated by upward
  pointing arrows, is gluconeogenesis (green background). Even-chain lipids feed into
  the TCA cycle (red background). Odd-chain lipids, cholesterol, and branched-chain
  amino acids feed into the MCC and methylmalonyl-CoA pathways (yellow background).
  Genes discussed in the text that impact antibiotic sensitivity are indicated on
  the pathway.
