caption: 'Mouse-specific reactions which were added into iMM1865. (A) Synthesis ascorbate
  (vitamin C) from glucose. The last enzyme of this pathway is not available in human.
  (B) There are three sub-pathways for threonine degradation. Human cells do not contain
  L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase enzyme. So breakdown of L-threonine into pyruvate does
  not occur. (C) A Sub-pathway of amino sugar metabolism which was added into iMM1865.
  Blue arrow: reactions exist in both Recon3D and iMM1865; Red arrow: reactions just
  exist in iMM1865; Dashed arrow: reactions are part of metabolic pathway; Black metabolites/enzymes:
  metabolites/enzymes exist in both Recon3D and iMM1865; Blue metabolites: metabolites
  just exist in iMM1865; Red enzymes: enzymes just exist in iMM1865. ER: endoplasmic
  reticulum.'
