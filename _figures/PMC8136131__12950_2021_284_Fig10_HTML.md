caption: Gene networks that are activated in IPF lung fibroblasts were analyzed using
  ToppFun functional enrichment analysis and visualized using Cytoscape software platform.
  Orange colored circles represent genes that are upregulated in IPF lung fibroblasts
  and downregulated by esomeprazole while the purple-colored circles represent genes
  that are downregulated in IPF lung fibroblasts but upregulated by esomeprazole.
  The blue-colored squares represent enriched biological processes for the inversely
  correlated genes between control and esomeprazole treatment
