caption: The M1P building block for the maltosyltransferase GlgE is formed via two
  alternative routes, TreS-Pep2 and GlgC-GlgA. Both routes are connected via the shared
  use of ADP-glucose by GlgA and OtsA, the latter providing the trehalose substrate
  for the TreS-Pep2 pathway. GlgA, like OtsA, is also capable of using UDP-glucose
  as a donor, which in turn is produced from G1P by GalU, but this appears to be less
  significant in vivo. GlgE is essential for intracellular and capsular α-glucan synthesis
  and generates linear maltooligosaccharides as the substrates for the branching enzyme
  GlgB. α-Glucans are produced intracellularly with partial coupling to secretion
  by unknown transport mechanisms. Steps highlighted in red are new findings as described
  in this report. G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; G1P, glucose 1-phosphate; M1P, α-maltose
  1-phosphate; T6P, trehalose 6-phosphate; ADPG, ADP-glucose; UDPG, UDP-glucose.
