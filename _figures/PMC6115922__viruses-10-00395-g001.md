caption: 'Honey Bee Immune Pathways—Highlighting Genes Implicated in Antiviral Immune
  Responses. The honey bee genome encodes major members of insect immune pathways
  including: Jak/STAT (Janus kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription);
  RNAi (RNA interference); Toll via NF-κB (Nuclear Factor κB/Dorsal); Imd (Immune
  deficiency) via NF-κB/Relish; JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase); and MAPK (Mitogen-Activated
  Protein Kinases), as well as orthologues of genes involved in the heat shock response
  (Hsp), autophagy, eicosanoid biosynthesis, endocytosis, melanization, and prophenoloxidase
  (PPO) response. Bold text indicates genes and proteins differentially expressed
  in virus-infected honey bees and/or bumble bees. The first step in immune activation
  is host recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including
  viral dsRNA, bacterial peptidoglycans, and fungal β-glucans. In general, the Toll
  pathway is involved in defense against Gram(+) bacteria and fungi and the Imd pathway
  is activated by Gram(−) bacteria, but specific host-pathogen interactions are unique.
  This is particularly true for host—virus interactions since data from fruit-flies,
  mosquitoes, and honey bees indicate differential activation of immune genes and
  pathways. The Jak/STAT pathway is activated via ligand binding to the Domeless receptor;
  while Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) express Domeless ligands (unpaired, upd, upd2,
  and upd3), a honey bee upd orthologue has not been identified. Following Domeless-ligand
  binding, Hopscotch Janus kinases are transphosphorylated, leading to phosphorylation
  and dimerization of STAT92E-like proteins. Activated STATs transcriptionally regulate
  antimicrobial effectors TEP7 (Thioester-containing protein 7), TEPA, TEPB, and the
  Jak/STAT inhibitor SOCS (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling). The honey bee genome
  also encodes for D-PIAS (Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT), another inhibitor
  of the Jak/STAT pathway. The RNAi-pathway is initiated by DmDicer-2 cleavage of
  viral dsRNA into 21–22 bp siRNAs; AmDicer-like shares ~30% aa identity with DmDicer-2.
  The siRNAs are then loaded into Ago2 (Argonaute-2), the catalytic component of the
  RISC (RNA Induced Silencing Complex). A single strand of the siRNA is retained in
  the RISC and used to specifically target cognate viral genome sequences for cleavage.
  In addition, DmDicer-2 serves as a dsRNA sensor that mediates a signal transduction
  cascade resulting in increased expression of DmVago, which suppresses viral replication.
  AmDicer-like may serve as a dsRNA sensor, as honey bees have a vago orthologue which
  is up-regulated in DWV-infected honey bees, but not Sindbis-GFP-infected honey bees.
  In B. terrestris, Vago limits viral infection in fat bodies in a Dicer-dependent
  manner. Though the mechanism(s) of non-specific dsRNA-mediated antiviral responses
  in bees require additional characterization, a putative serine/threonine cyclin-dependent
  kinase (MF 116383) is involved in this virus-limiting response in honey bees. Additionally,
  several members of the heat shock protein family exhibit increased expression in
  Sindbis-GFP infected honey bees (i.e., hsp90, activator of hsp90, 60 kda hsp, 10
  kda hsp, hsp83-like, hsc70-4, and hsf5), while dsRNA alone resulted in increased
  expression of hsp90. The Toll pathway is activated by a family of pathogen recognition
  receptors (PRRs) (e.g., peptidoglycan receptor proteins (PGRPs) and Gram(−) binding
  proteins) that bind fungal and bacterial PAMPs. The Toll pathway is activated in
  some insect host-virus combinations, although the activation mechanism is unknown.
  Following PAMP binding, a serine protease cascade results in cleavage of pro-Spaetzle
  into mature Spaetzle. The honey bee genome encodes two putative spaetzle orthologues,
  which bind the membrane-anchored Toll receptor. Toll dimerization results in the
  recruitment of dMyD88, Tube and Pelle. Pelle is likely involved in degradation of
  NF-κB inhibitors (e.g., Cactus-1, Cactus-2, Cactus-3), resulting in the release
  of transcription factors Dorsal-1A and Dorsal-1B. Nuclear translocation of Dorsal
  results in increased expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and Amel/102. The
  Imd pathway is activated by Peptidoglycan recognition protein LC (PGRP-LC) binding
  to diaminopimelic-containing peptidoglycan of Gram(−) bacteria, followed by activation
  of the adaptor protein Immune deficiency (Imd), Relish phosphorylation by the IKK
  complex (IkB kinase) and cleavage of Relish by the caspase Dredd (Death-related
  ced-3/Nedd2-like). Relish transcriptionally regulates expression of AMPs and other
  genes involved in antimicrobial defense. The JNK pathway is also activated by TAK
  (Transforming growth factor-activated kinase 1) and TAB2/3 (TAK binding protein
  2 and 3), resulting in AMP expression and/or apoptosis. In Drosophila, binding of
  vesicular stomatitis virus to the Toll-7 receptor promotes autophagy, likely by
  inhibiting the PI3/Akt/Tor (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Protein kinase B/Target
  of rapamycin) pathway which suppresses autophagy. The honey bee genome encodes for
  one gene in the Toll-7/2 clade, 18-wheeler (Am18w), which shares ~49% aa identity
  with DmToll-7 and ~45% aa identity with DmToll-2. The role of the Am18w protein
  in antiviral defense and autophagy in honey bees is unknown. In insects, Eicosanoid
  biosynthesis begins with the induction of PLA2 (Phospholipase 2) from signal cascades
  downstream of viral, fungal, or bacterial PAMP recognition. Activated PLA2 hydrolyzes
  arachidonic acid (AA) from cellular phospholipids. Eicosonoid production likely
  occurs via oxidation of AA by an unidentified enzyme. Eicosanoids are critical for
  nodulation and aid in phagocytosis, micro-aggregation, adhesion, and release of
  prophenoloxidase (PPO) from hemocytes. Experimental evidence also suggests endocytosis,
  melanization and MAPK pathways are involved in honey bee antiviral defense. Adapted
