caption: 'Defects in physiologically driven actin signaling at hippocampal synapses
  in Fmr1-KO mice. Observed impairments and their hypothesized causes are represented
  in a summary diagram of events involved in the production of stable LTP. Three classes
  of postsynaptic receptors (-Rs) are engaged by theta bursts, two of which drive
  cytoskeletal modifications. Bound neurotransmitter receptors (glutamate-Rs) initiate
  events that promote the full activation of these two groups. The modifier-Rs stimulate
  RhoA, presumably via multiple GTPase-regulatory factors (GRFs), which then initiate
  a pathway that goes through multiple effectors to trigger actin filament assembly.
  The modifier-R for BDNF (i.e., TrkB) also facilitates Rac>PAK signaling, which drives
  unknown effectors to stabilize the newly formed filaments. Adhesion-Rs belonging
  to the β1 integrin family also drive the RhoA assembly cascade and are assumed from
  the literature to have potent effects on the Rac, stabilization pathway. Past studies
  showed that the RhoA-initiated sequence is intact in Fmr1-KO slices; the present
  findings indicate that physiological activation of Rac and PAK is impaired (slashed
  lines) in the mutants, and that this is accompanied by a loss of rapid stabilization
  of both newly formed actin filaments and LTP. Given the results for RhoA, cofilin,
  and actin polymerization, the defect is not likely to reside in the membrane receptors
  or their activation. The proposed alternatives are (1) a flaw in the steps leading
  from the receptors to Rac (dashed arrows) and/or (2) defects in Rac-specific GRFs
  engaged by the membrane Rs (black ovals). The schematic includes a group of intact
  Rac-specific GRFs that are not linked to the membrane Rs: these are suggested by
  the observation that baseline levels of activated Rac and PAK appear normal in Fmr1-KO
  slices. Finally, myosin IIb is included in the schematic because its regulatory
  kinase is a target of PAK; disruption of this linkage in the mutants could lead
  to impaired myosin motor responses to afferent activity, and thus to the abnormalities
  in PAK distribution described here.'
