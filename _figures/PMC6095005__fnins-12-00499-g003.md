caption: 'Mechanisms involved in the induction of depressive symptoms in inflammatory
  conditions (gray arrows) and potential therapeutic implications following pharmacological
  or nutritional interventions (blue arrows). Activation of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
  (IDO) in inflammatory conditions leads to the production of kynurenine from tryptophan,
  at the expense of serotonin production. The synthesis of serotonin and other monoamines
  is also impaired because of reduced bioavailability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)
  that results from the induction of GTP-cyclohydrolase-1 (GCH1) by cytokines. By
  concomitantly activating the kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO), inflammation promotes
  the production of the neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid, while synthesis of
  kynurenic acid, rather neuroprotective, is reduced. Both inflammation-induced reduction
  of monoamine production and increase of neuronal damages ultimately contribute to
  the development of depressive symptoms. In that context, different therapeutic strategies
  targeting these mechanisms can be identified. They include: classical antidepressants
  that aim to increase monoamine synthesis, but also able of reducing inflammation
  or kynurenine pathway activation; anti-inflammatory interventions with antibiotics,
  ω3-PUFAs, anti-cytokine antibodies or NSAIDs; IDO or KMO inhibitors; antagonists
  of the NMDA receptors such as ketamine, and BH4 supplementation. PAH, phenylalanine
  hydroxylase; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; TrypOH, tryptophan hydroxylase.'
