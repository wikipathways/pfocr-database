caption: Role of BCR signaling to NF-κB in ABC DLBCL. (A) Schematic of BCR signaling
  to NF-κB. Recurrent genetic alterations in ABC DLBCL that result in constitutive
  NF-κB activation are indicated by the gray boxes. Proximal signaling by the BCR
  is initiated by SRC-family kinases (SFK; e.g., LYN, FYN, FGR, and BLK), which phosphorylate
  the ITAM motifs in the CD79A and CD79B components of the BCR receptor. SYK is recruited
  to the phosphorylated ITAMs and activated to phosphorylate many downstream proteins.
  The PI(3) kinase pathway is activated by SRC-family kinase phosphorylation of the
  BCR coreceptor CD19. The generation of PIP3 by PI(3) kinase recruits BTK and associated
  BLNK and phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) to the plasma membrane. PLCγ2 generates inositol
  triphosphate (IP3), which leads to opening of the capacitative calcium channel,
  thereby activating the NF-AT pathway. Diacylglycerol (DAG) is also generated, which
  activates protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ). PKCβ phosphorylates the latent form of CARD11
  (CARD-off) in the cytoplasm, causing it to adopt an active conformation (CARD11-on),
  translocate to the plasma membrane, and recruit the signaling adapters BCL10 and
  MALT1. MALT1 binds TRAF6, causing TRAF6 to catalyze K63-linked polyubiquitination
  of the IKKγ subunit, MALT1 and itself. TAB2 recognizes the polyubiquitin chains
  on TRAF6, leading to phosphorylation of IKKβ in its activation loop by TAK1 kinase.
  Ubiquitination of IKKγ and phosphorylation of IKKβ activate IKKβ to phosphorylate
  IκBα. Phosphorylated IκBα is ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin ligase βTrCP, leading
  to its proteasomal degradation. Nuclear NF-κB heterodimers activate multiple target
  genes, including A20. A20 terminates NF-κB signaling by removing K63-linked ubiquitin
  chains from IKKγ, TRAF6, and MALT1, and attaching K48-linked ubiquitin chains. (B)
  The role of chronic active BCR signaling in the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL. Genetic
  mutations in CD79B and CD79A ITAM regions in ABC DLBCLs suggest that BCR signaling
  is key to the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL. CD79B and CD79A ITAM mutations in the mouse
  cause hyperactive BCR signaling, suggesting that CD79 ITAM mutations in ABC DLBCL
  may amplify antigen-stimulated BCR signaling. CD79 ITAM mutations increase surface
  BCR expression and decrease activation of LYN kinase, a negative regulator of BCR
  signaling, potentially resulting in increased signaling to NF-κB and greater clonal
  expansion. A separate step leading to chronic active BCR signaling in ABC DLBCL
  is the acquisition of spontaneous BCR clustering, which is not caused by the ITAM
  mutations. The BCR clustering phenotype could theoretically be acquired either before
  or after the CD79 mutations. Finally, ABC DLBCLs must acquire additional oncogenic
  hits to become fully malignant.
