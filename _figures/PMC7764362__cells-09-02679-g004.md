caption: Main action mechanisms of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) related
  to antiviral and immunomodulators properties. By increasing the pH into lysosomes,
  CQ and HCQ interfere with cargo derived from endocytosis and/or from autophagic
  pathway. Moreover, CQ and HCQ prevent the PAMPs’ recognition by Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs). These drugs can inhibit the TLR and STING signaling, which automatically
  decreases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including the IFN response.
