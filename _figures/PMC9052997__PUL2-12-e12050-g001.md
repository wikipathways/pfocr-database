caption: 'Notch3 signaling pathway in a pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell. Left
  figure is the canonical pathway and right figure is the proposed pathway with Notch3
  mutation. Canonical pathway description (left pathway): Cell membrane‐bound ligands
  (Jagged‐1) on the signaling cell physically bind with the extracellular domain (epidermal
  growth factor [EGF]‐like repeats) of the NOTCH protein receptor. This triggers protease‐driven
  cleavage of the intracellular domain of the NOTCH protein which then translocates
  to the nucleus, binding with recombining binding protein suppressor (RBPJ) to active
  HES gene transcription. This subsequently leads to downstream effects on the vascular
  smooth muscle cells. Mutation pathway (right pathway): mutations can lead to improper
  signaling of the Notch3 protein and overexpression of downstream antiapoptotic factors
  and cell cycle promoters (cyclin D) leading to proliferation, prosurvival pulmonary
  vascular smooth muscle cells'
