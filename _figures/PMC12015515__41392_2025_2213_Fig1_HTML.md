caption: 'A novel signaling pathway linking IL18 proteolytic processing to anticancer
  immunity. In some cells including monocytes and macrophages, the proteolytic processing
  of immature interleukin 18 (IL18) by caspase 1 (CASP1) results in the generation
  of mature IL18 (mIL18) and its secretion, resulting in the establishment of inflammatory
  conditions upon binding to interleukin 18 receptor 1 (IL18R1) on target cells (a).
  Recent data demonstrate that—in some settings—malignant cells expressing full-length
  IL18 (flIL18) can cleave it at an alternative site (which is also a substrate for
  CASP3, at least in vitro), resulting in the formation of an atypical IL18 fragment
  that is not secreted. Short IL18 (sIL18) instead appears to bind cyclin-dependent
  kinase (CDK8) to promote signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)
  functions, culminating with the release of numerous bioactive factors including
  ISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier (ISG15) and the consequent recruitment of natural
  killer (NK) cells to the tumor microenvironment in support of cancer immunosurveillance
  (b). The actual mechanistic contribution of CASP3 (vs other proteases activated
  in apoptotic conditions that may recognize the same cleavage site) to the generation
  of sIL18 in malignant cells forming progressive neoplasms in vivo, however, remains
  to be formally established. LFA-1α (official name: ITGAL) integrin alpha L, P inorganic
  phosphate'
