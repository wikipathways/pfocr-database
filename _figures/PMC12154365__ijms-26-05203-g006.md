caption: Dual functions of EBF1 and its molecular regulatory network across multiple
  tumor types. (A) EBF1 promotes the malignant progression of osteosarcoma by activating
  the lncRNA FGD5-AS1 and forming the FGD5-AS1/miR-124-3p/G3BP2 axis, thereby relieving
  the suppression of G3BP2. (B) The tumor-suppressive lncRNA LINC00261 inhibits EBF1
  expression, attenuating EBF1-mediated proliferation and migration of TC cells. (C)
  In glioma, EBF1 suppresses cell proliferation and tumor progression by activating
  Hey2 and Zfp423, but this tumor-suppressive effect can be blocked by Sox2. (D) The
  oncogenic lncRNA RP11-874J12.4 upregulates EBF1 expression by inhibiting miR-19a-5p,
  promoting proliferation, migration, and tumor growth in OSCC. (E) In CCA, EBF1 expression
  is downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation and oxidative stress, which promotes
  cell proliferation, migration, invasion, stem-like properties, and tumorigenic potential
  and enhances the ability to adapt to oxidative stress; the tumor-promoting effects
  resulting from EBF1 dysregulation may be mediated through the regulation of IL-6-related
  signaling pathways. (F) EBF1 suppresses malignant behavior in CC cells by activating
  FBN1 expression and enhances sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin.
  (G) EBF1 may be involved in the tumorigenesis of LUSC by negatively regulating the
  oncogenic lncRNA CASC9
