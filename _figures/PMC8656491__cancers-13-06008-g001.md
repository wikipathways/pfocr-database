caption: DDR-targeted agents that have been clinically approved or are in clinical
  trials. PARP-1 and PARP-2 become enzymatically active upon recognition of DNA breaks,
  cleave β-NAD+ and transfer ADP-ribose moieties (PARylation) onto specific amino
  acid residues of acceptor proteins. The kinases ATR and ATM phosphorylate hundreds
  of proteins, including CHK1 and CHK2, respectively, which are key mediators of the
  checkpoint function. Whereas ATM is activated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs),
  ATR is activated by DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs). The kinase DNA-PK is critical
  for DSB repair via the non-homologous end-joining pathway. The kinase WEE1 controls
  mitotic entry.
