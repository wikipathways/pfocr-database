caption: The principal pathway is from DNA to mRNA to proteins (the bold lines) and
  is mediated by a bevy of proteins including RNA polymerase and those of the translational
  apparatus. However, it is well appreciated that enzymes control the synthesis of
  both DNA and RNA (their control is represented by the dotted lines). Information
  flows from RNA to DNA by the action of reverse transcriptase. Kinases regulate the
  phosphorylation status of the elongation-initiation factor 2-guanosine triphosphate
  (eIF2-GTP) complex. Large scale regulation of the genes that are expressed in a
  cell at a particular time in our lifetime is determined by the post-translational
  modification of histones, basic proteins that bind tightly to DNA. Deacetylation
  of histones leads to the suppression of gene expression.
