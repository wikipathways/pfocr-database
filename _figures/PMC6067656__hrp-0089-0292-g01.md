caption: Schematic representation of human adrenal steroidogenesis. Steroidogenic
  enzymes are depicted in grey boxes supporting catalytic activities indicated by
  the black arrow. Co-factors for steroidogenic enzymes are represented by white boxes.
  The three main steroidogenic pathways are coloured as green for the mineralocorticoid,
  yellow for the glucocorticoid, and blue for the androgen pathway. An asterisk marks
  enzymes that are predominantly expressed in extra-adrenal tissues. StAR, steroidogenic
  acute regulatory protein; CYP11A1, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme; CYP17A1,
  17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase; CYB5A, cytochrome b5; SULT2A1, DHEA sulfotransferase;
  POR, P450 oxidoreductase; CYP21A2, 21-hydroxylase; HSD3B2, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehy­drogenase;
  CYP11B1, 11β-hydroxylase; CYP11B2, aldosterone synthase; HSD17B3, 17β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase type 3; SRD5A2, 5α-reductase type 2; Adx, adrenodoxin; AdR, adrenodoxin
  reductase.
