caption: 'Metabolic model for the synthesis of glycogen and triglyceride from glucose
  or fructose in the liver. The model includes glucose-6-phosphate oxidation by the
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to provide NADPH for conversion of acetyl-CoA to
  fatty acyl-CoA via de novo lipogenesis. The 13C-enriched glucose and fructose precursors
  are highlighted in red and the sampled metabolites, glycogen and triglyceride, are
  highlighted in blue. The metabolite pools whose 13C and 2H enrichments are reported
  by the sampled metabolites, namely, glucose-6-P, triose-P (dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) and lipogenic acetyl-CoA, are highlighted in boxes.
  Glycogen synthesis from glucose via glucose-6-P from gluconeogenic precursors, including
  pyruvate and triose-P sources, is also indicated (direct and indirect pathways,
  respectively). For simplicity, some metabolic intermediates, as well as ATP/ADP
  and NAD/NADH interconversions, are not shown. Abbreviations are as follows: DHAP—dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; F-1-P—fructose-1-phosphate; F-6-P—fructose 6-phosphate; F-1,6-P2—fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  G-6-P—glucose 6-phosphate; Gly—glyceraldehyde; Gly-3-P—glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  OA—oxaloacetate; PEP—phophoenolpyruvate; Ru-5-P: ribulose-5-P.'
