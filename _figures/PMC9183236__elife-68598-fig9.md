caption: The main players during alveolar formation are shown in the schematic diagram.
  Mitochondria display dynamic subcellular distribution in alveolar epithelial cells
  and mesenchymal fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. Tfam controls mitochondrial activity
  while Rhot1 regulates mitochondrial distribution. Mitochondrial activity and distribution
  in alveolar epithelial cells (type I [AT1] and type II [AT2]) contribute to secretion
  of the PDGF-A ligand. Reception of PDGF-A by mesenchymal fibroblasts/myofibroblasts
  is critical to fibroblast/myofibroblast proliferation and migration, a key step
  in secondary septation. Similarly, mitochondrial activity and distribution in fibroblasts/myofibroblasts
  are also required for fibroblast/myofibroblast contraction and migration, likely
  through powering the cytoskeleton. The mTORC1 pathway plays a central role in controlling
  mitochondrial function during alveolar formation. Specification of alveolar epithelial
  cells and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts was unaffected in mutant mouse lungs in which
  mitochondrial activity and distribution were perturbed. We propose that essential
  cellular processes have differential requirements of mitochondrial activity and
  distribution. Investigating how mitochondria control signaling pathways and cellular
  processes in vivo provide a new way to functionally define signaling pathways and
  cellular processes. We surmise that the regulatory circuitry mediated by mitochondria
  activity and distribution is also deployed during alveolar repair following lung
  injury and could contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung disease
  (COPD)/emphysema.
