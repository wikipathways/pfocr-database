caption: The Wnt signaling pathway is comprised of extracellular, cytoplasmic and
  nuclear signaling events that are amenable to therapeutic intervention. Dysregulation
  at these stages are common in numerous cancers, captured in the white boxes. Upon
  entering the nucleus and interacting with TCF/LEF and various co-activators, β-catenin
  drives transcription of programs critical for CSCs, tumor cells and EMT.
