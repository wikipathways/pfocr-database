caption: The products of serine, either transported into the cell or synthesized from
  glucose de novo, contributes to SAM generation in two ways. Under normal culture
  conditions with sufficient methionine, the serine catabolism products glycine and
  formyl-THF support SAM synthesis through ATP (pathway 1, in blue). In the absence
  of methionine, serine becomes the crucial 1C donor for the re-methylation of methionine
  from homocysteine (pathway 2, in red).
