caption: Working model of the role of LXR in Fgf21 gene regulation in mouse liver
  during fasting. A, In control mice, PPARα, LXRβ, RORα, and Rev-erbα reside on their
  respective response elements. LXRβ, RORα, and Rev-Erbα interact with an HDAC3-containing
  corepressor complex, and the Fgf21 gene is marginally expressed. B, Upon fasting,
  PPARα is activated, which leads to its interaction with a coactivator complex, clearance
  of the HDAC3 corepressor complex, Pol II recruitment, and marked induction of Fgf21
  gene transcription. C, LXR activation by GW3965 during fasting results in increased
  recruitment of the LXRβ, RORα, and Rev-Erbα, resulting in the stabilization of the
  HDAC3/corepressor complex on the promoter. Increased heme synthesis (ALAS1 is induced)
  activates Rev-erbα that may in turn inhibit RORα-mediated transactivation. GW3965
  activates an LXRα-dependent signaling pathway, not yet identified, that contributes
  to the repression of Fgf21 expression by GW3965. Interaction between the activated
  PPARα and the coactivator complex is weakened and Pol II recruitment is inhibited.
  The fasting induced transcription of Fgf21 is blunted.
