caption: Dysregulated pathways in PMMs (in black circles, other mutated genes are
  highlighted with their protein representation, and colocalization parallel to the
  main signaling pathways). Recurrent mutations in GNAQ, PLCβ4, and CYSLTR2 are mutually
  exclusive and trigger Gαq signaling and related pathways (Akt/mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin,
  Yes-associated protein (YAP), and MAPK pathways). In brief, GNAQ mediates signals
  between the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and downstream effectors. Receptor
  activation by ligand binding causes the activation of GNAQ by catalyzing the release
  of GDP and binding of GTP. In its active form, GTP-bound GNAQ causes the release
  of the beta and gamma subunits of the heterotrimeric G-protein. GTP-GNAQ and beta
  and gamma subunits transfer the receptor-mediated signal to downstream effectors
  through secondary messengers, which participate in diverse signaling pathways to
  evoke different effectors. The known effectors for GNAQ include PLC beta, p63-RhoGEF,
  Trio, and Duet. GNAQ has been shown to activate the MAP kinase pathway, possibly
  via DAG-mediated activation of protein kinase C isoforms. GNAQ has an intrinsic
  GTPase domain at the C terminus, which causes the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, and
  the G-alpha-GDP re-associates with G-beta and G-gamma subunits. Somatic mutations
  in GNAQ have been described in uveal and meningeal melanocytic neoplasias. In uveal
  melanoma, 97% of the hotspot mutations cause the amino acid substitution Q209L (data
  similar to rare cases originating in the meninges); the other 3% of mutations generate
  amino acid change R183Q. The Glutamine 209 of GNAQ is similar to residue 61 of RAS
  protein. The Q209 and R183 mutations cause a complete or partial loss of intrinsic
  GTPase activity, thereby locking the protein in a constitutively active form. Q209
  and R183 mutations occur in a mutually exclusive pattern in human neoplasia. Mutations
  in GNAQ are also mutually exclusive from the hotspot mutations in GNA11, which belongs
  to the same family and shares 90% sequence homology. GNAQ mutations are not concurrent
  with other common oncogenic mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or KIT found in common melanomas.
