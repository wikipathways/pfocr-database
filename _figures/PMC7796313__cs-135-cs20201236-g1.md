caption: '(A) TGF-β is secreted by cells in an inactive form in which the latency
  associated peptide (orange) is wrapped around the mature TGF-β (green), preventing
  it from binding to cell surface receptors. Latent TGF-β can be activated by integrins
  or metalloproteases, among other mechanisms. Once activated, TGF-β binds initially
  to TGFβRII and thereafter recruits TGFβRI, thereby forming a heteromeric or heterotetrametric
  (not drawn) complex. Upon ligand-induced complex formation, TGFβRII kinase phosphorylates
  TGFβRI, which propagates the signal into the cell by phosphorylating SMAD2/3 molecules.
  Activated SMAD2/3 partner with SMAD4, translocate into the nucleus, where this complex
  can interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner and regulate transcriptional
  responses. The TGF-β signalling pathway can be targeted at several levels indicated
  by the red symbols: 1 – Transcription/translation of TGF-β genes with siRNAs or
  antisense oligonucleotides; 2 – Release of active TGF-β via integrins; 3 – Release
  of active TGF-β from LAP; 4 –TGF-β ligands and TGF-β receptor binding; 5 –TGFβRI
  kinase activity. (B) Schematic overview of the effects of TGF-β on the tumour microenvironment
  (TME). (I) Latent TGF-β is present in high amounts in the TME and, when locally
  activated by i.e. integrins or metalloproteases. TGF-β can affect cells locally.
  (II) TGF-β induces the activation of tumour supporting cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs), which create a physical barrier around the TME that hampers the influx of
  immune cells. Moreover, CAFs produce high amounts of TGF-β themselves. (III) Immune-modulatory
  molecules that further enhance the immunosuppressive milieu are being upregulated
  by tumour and resident immune cells (i.e. PD-L1 and IDO, respectively) and being
  secreted (i.e. arginase). (IV) High amounts of TGF-β increase the tumour cellular
  motility leading to an invasive phenotype contributing to metastasis.'
