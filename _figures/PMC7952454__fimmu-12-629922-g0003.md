caption: DNASE2A deficiency causes an accumulation of phagocytosed dsDNA as well as
  nuclear dsDNA transported by autophagy into endolysosomal compartments. Such dsDNA
  can gain access to the cytosol and activate the cGAS/STING pathway (orange) that
  leads to the production of type I interferons (IFN-I), which ultimately causes the
  development of fatal autoimmunity. In the absence of IFN-I signaling DNASE2A deficiency
  will induce the development of rheumatoid arthritis which is mediated by TNFα, whose
  production is triggered by the cGAS/STING pathway, but also by IL-1β and IL-18 which
  are inflammatory cytokines produced upon the activation of the AIM2 inflammasome
  by cytosolic self-DNA. Finally, DNASE2A deficiency also induces aberrant activation
  of endolysosomal TLR (red) which contribute via the activation of the MyD88 to the
  production of autoantibodies. PLD3/4 are novel endolysosomal nucleases (green) involved
  in the degradation of ssDNA. Their deficiency induces an accumulation of ssDNA in
  endolysosomes that ultimately activates TLR9-MyD88-NFκB mediated inflammatory cytokine
  (IL-6 and IL-12) production, causing fatal autoimmunity.

  description: DNASE2A deficiency causes an accumulation of phagocytosed dsDNA as
    well as nuclear dsDNA transported by autophagy into endolysosomal compartments.
    Such dsDNA can gain access to the cytosol and activate the cGAS/STING pathway
    (orange) that leads to the production of type I interferons (IFN-I), which ultimately
    causes the development of fatal autoimmunity. In the absence of IFN-I signaling
