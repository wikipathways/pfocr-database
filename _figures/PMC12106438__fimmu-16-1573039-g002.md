caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of intracellular lactate production and export. Tumor
  cells predominantly rely on aerobic glycolysis, converting glucose into lactate
  via LDHA even in normoxic conditions, sustaining glycolytic flux and rapid proliferation.
  Glutaminolysis serves as an alternative pathway, where glutamine is metabolized
  into α-KG, feeding the TCA cycle and contributing to lactate production. Lactate
  transport is mediated by MCTs: MCT1 facilitates lactate influx or efflux depending
  on tissue type, while MCT4 predominantly drives lactate efflux in glycolytic or
  hypoxic cells. These pathways underscore tumor cells'' metabolic flexibility and
  reliance on lactate dynamics for energy and biosynthesis. (Created with BioRender.com)'
