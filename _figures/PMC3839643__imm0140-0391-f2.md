caption: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) regulates the production of extracellular
  adenosine. Extracellular ATP released from infections and necrotic cell death is
  potently inflammatory. Regulatory T (Treg) cells constitutively express the two
  ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 that can convert ATP, via AMP into adenosine, thereby
  converting an inflammatory stimulus into an anti-inflammatory one. TGF-β is, however,
  able to induce the expression of both CD39 and CD73 on the majority of activated
  T cells, as well as on other cell types such as macrophages and dendritic cells,
  thereby providing a mechanism to dramatically amplify the anti-inflammatory action
  of these two enzymes.
