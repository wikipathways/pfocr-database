caption: The potential of radiotherapy to induce cytokine storm. Radiotherapy (RT)
  has three or more ways of immune activation. (A) The first is damage- associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs). RT could induce three types of DAMPs, namely exposed
  on the cell surface (CRT), released by cancer cells passively (HMGB1 and MTDs),
  secreted by cancer cells actively (ATP). DAMPs could interact with their pattern
  recognition receptors (PRRs) and activate downstream immune effects. (B) Meanwhile,
  radiotherapy could also stimulate the secretion of chemokines such as CXCL16 and
  CCL5, then recruit various pro-inflammatory immune cells into the tumor microenvironment.
  (C) Furthermore, radiotherapy could also arise the neoantigens presentation of neoantigens
  and active cGAS-STING signal pathway to increase the expression of interferon. All
  of the above immune activation effects could induce cytokine storm potentially.
