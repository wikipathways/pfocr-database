caption: Overview of metabolic pathways emanating from RubP by Rubisco activity. Upon
  carboxylation, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) molecules are formed from C1−C2 and C3−C5
  of RuBP. Upon oxygenation, one 3-PGA molecule is formed from C3−C5 of RubP, and
  up to one-half 3-PGA is formed via the photorespiration pathway through the peroxisome
  and mitochondrion. The color coding of hydrogen atoms tracks the biochemical origins
  of hydrogens at C3 of 3-PGA, which give rise to the isotopomer signal encoded in
  the colored C6H2 group of glucose.
