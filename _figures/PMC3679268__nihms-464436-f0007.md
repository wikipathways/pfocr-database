caption: In a normal cell, TAK1-TAB1 complex is minimally active and NF-κB pathway
  is dormant. However, mutant Kras leads to transcriptional upregulation of GSK-3α
  and GSK-3β, that can stabilize TAK1, TAB1 and TAK1-TAB1 complex leading to constitutive
  canonical NF-κB activation. GSK-3α also drives the non-canonical NF-κB pathway by
  promoting/stabilizing nuclear p52, thus leading to constitutive non-canonical NF-κB
  activation. NF-κB drives transcription of genes involved in survival, proliferation,
  metastasis that contributes to an aggressive pancreatic phenotype.
