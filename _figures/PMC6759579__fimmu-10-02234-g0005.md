caption: 'Functional overview of the embryonic complement system. Indicated are the
  canonical functional roles of membrane-expressed complement regulators (squares),
  soluble complement components (circles), and their cleaved activated membrane-deposited
  forms (demi-circles). Finally, embryonically expressed complement receptors are
  shown (pentagons). All molecules depicted were found to be expressed or bound by
  the embryos in this study (exceptions: C4, mannose binding lectin (MBL), ficolins
  (FCNs), and some MAC-components). The classical and the lectin pathways are initiated
  by target-binding of pattern recognition molecules such as C1q, or MBL and FCNs,
  respectively. Utilizing their associated proteases C1r/s or MASPs, they activate
  C4 and C2, which subsequently activate C3. Alternative pathway activation of C3
  occurs when factor D cleaves C3-associated factor B, which generates a novel C3-cleaving
  enzyme; C3bBb. Cleavage of C3 by either pathway leads to generation of soluble C3a
  and surface-deposited C3b, which amplifies alternative pathway C3 activation, and
  subsequently activates C5 to C5a and C5b. Finally, C5b initiates the assembly of
  the pore-forming MAC (, ). To avoid excessive immunological targeting of self, human
  cells express or recruit inhibitors of complement activation. Membrane regulators
  may function; () by disrupting the enzymes cleaving C3 and C5 (CR1, CD55), () as
  co-factors for factor I-mediated degradation of C3b and C4b (CR1, CD46), or () by
  inhibiting MAC-formation directly (CD59). Soluble regulators such as factor H and
  C4bp inhibit activation by mechanisms 1 and 2, while clusterin work through mechanism
  3. Inactivation of C3b, leads to generation of iC3b, C3dg, and finally C3d. While
  C3b and iC3b function as opsonins for increased phagocytosis by antigen presenting
  cells (through CR3 and CR4), C3d has important biological functions as an important
  internal adjuvant aiding antigen uptake by dendritic cells and inducing efficient
  antibody responses in B cells (through CR2) (, , ). While CR2, CR3 and CR4 expression
  is mainly described on immune cells, our study found embryonic expression of these
  receptors, along with the signaling receptors for C1q; calreticulin (CALR) and C1qbp.'
