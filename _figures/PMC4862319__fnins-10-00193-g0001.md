caption: Simplified schematic of signaling junctions that integrate the recognition
  of pathogen, host or environmentally derived DAMPs and dAMPs by their cognate receptors.
  Viral or host derived nucleic acids are recognized by several PRR families according
  to distinct structural characteristics and their location. cGAS generates second
  messenger cGAMP to activate STING-dependent signaling (Hornung et al., ). Other
  cytoplasmic DNA sensors, such as IFI16, converge on this pathway (Goubau et al.,
  ). RIG-I has dual functions in inducing nuclear translocation of transcription factors
  such as NF-κB and IRF-3/7 through MAVS (Yoneyama et al., ) and MAVS-independent
  inflammasome activation (Poeck et al., ). Like RIG-I, inflammasome forming PRRs
  AIM2 and NLRP1/3 direct procytokine conversion by activating caspase-1 (Kim et al.,
  ; Thaiss et al., ; in response to stimuli such as bacteria-derived MDP or toxins
  (Wen et al., ). Transcription factors NF-κB, AP-1, and IRF-3/7 can also translocate
  to the nucleus following activation of the endosomal TLRs which signal through either
  Myd88 or TRIF. Membrane bound TLR2/4 innervate these pathways on detecting host
  derived dAMPs such as HSPs and MSU (Gelderblom et al., ). Binding of pro-inflammatory
  ligands including AGEs, S100/calgranulin, amphoterin (HMGB1), and amyloid beta-peptide
  to RAGE, the receptor of advanced glycation end-products, triggers an increase in
  proinflammatory molecules, oxidative stressors and cytokines (Ray et al., ). HMGB1
  is a diverse PRR activator (Harris et al., ). TLR3-mediated necrosis is via TRIF
  (Kaiser et al., ). A table of DAMPs/dAMPs and their respective PRRs is included
  in Supplementary Section. PRR, pattern recognition receptor; cGAS, cyclic guanosine
  monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase; STING, stimulator of IFN genes;
  IFI16, IFN-Υ-inducible protein 16; RIG-I, retinioc acid inducible gene-I; NF-κB,
  nuclear factor kappa B; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral
  signaling protein; AIM2, absent in melanoma 2; NLRP, NOD like receptor, pyrin domain
  containing 1 and 3; MDP, muramyl-dipeptide; AP1, activator protein 1; TLRs, Toll-like
  receptors; Myd88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88; TRIF, Toll/interleukin-1
  receptor domain containing adapter-inducing interferon-β; DAMPs, danger-associated
  molecular patterns; dAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; AGEs, advanced
  glycation end products; HSPs, heat-shock proteins; MSU, monosodium urate.
