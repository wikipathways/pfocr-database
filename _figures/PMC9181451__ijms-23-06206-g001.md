caption: (A) The IMiD-type MG compounds’ chemical structures; (B) the substrate receptor
  CRBN-involved E3 ligase protein complex model. Each compound in (A) was documented
  to engage the same E3 ligase protein complex (CRL4CRBN) to polyubiquitinate the
  compound’s neosubstrates shown in . Then, the polyubiquitinated neosubstrates/protein
  targets in  would be degraded through the ubiquitination proteasome pathway; and
  (C) chemical structure of FPJFT-2216-derived three new small molecules (TMX-4100,
  TMX-4113, TMX-4116).
