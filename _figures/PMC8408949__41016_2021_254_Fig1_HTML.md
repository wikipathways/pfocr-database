caption: Overview of the BMP signaling pathway. BMPRI and BMPRII are located in the
  plasma membrane, composed of intracellular domain, transmembrane domain, and extracellular
  domain, and the intracellular domain possesses serine threonine kinase activity.
  BMPRI and BMPRII together with BMPs form heterotetrameric complex and translate
  signal to nucleus. This process can be inhibited by inhibitory Smad. Besides Smad
  pathway, non-Smad pathway, such as MAPK pathway, can also participate the BMP signal.
  All the effectors will finally lead to the induction of targeted gene expression
