caption: Working model. A, in wild-type mice, adropin cooperates with NB-3 to regulate
  the Notch1 signaling pathway for normal cerebellar development. Adropin may be important
  for NB-3 recruitment, enrichment, and/or binding affinity to Notch1 receptor and
  then affects brain development, locomotor activity, and coordination. B, in adropin
  knockout mice, less NB-3 was recruited, and the Notch1 signaling pathway was repressed.
  This may affect brain development and, hence, locomotor activity and coordination.
