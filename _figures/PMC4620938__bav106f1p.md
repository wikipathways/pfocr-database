caption: Cell-type-specific differential-ligand network map of CCL19/CCL21-CCR7 signaling.
  The network map of CCR7 signaling pathway reactions induced by its ligands CCL19
  and CCL21 that are experimentally identified in multiple cell types are represented
  using PathVisio. The topology of the network is devised based on the mutants, inhibitors,
  activators and silencing approaches. The edges represent the reactions and nodes
  represent the molecules. Molecules italicized represent the genes transcriptionally
  regulated by CCR7 signaling with red indicating the upregulated genes and green,
  the downregulated genes. The edges are distinguished by colors to differentiate
  different types of reactions such as protein–protein interactions, Post-translational
  modifications (PTMs) and translocation reactions. The PTMs of each protein are represented
  with the site and residue of modification mapped to the corresponding RefSeq accessions.
  The differential signaling by CCL19 and CCL21 in multiple cell types are also represented
  using colored square (CCL19), triangle (CCL21) and circle (not differential for
  both CCL19 and CCL21) shapes. Blue represent the reactions to be unique to one of
  them but not induced by the other whereas red indicates higher for one and the green
  indicates studied only in one of them and not the other and hence not to be considered
  differential.

    signaling. The network map of CCR7 signaling pathway reactions induced by its
