caption: 'Overview of NAD+ in cancer metabolic reprogramming. Under normal conditions,
  glucose is metabolized by glycolysis and generates pyruvate, which is preferentially
  transported into mitochondria. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) converts pyruvate to
  acetyl-CoA, which is further metabolized by tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, concomitantly
  converting NAD+ to NADH. NADH and FADH2 deliver high energy electrons to the electron
  transport chain (ETC) complexes (I~V) and power the production of ATP. Cancer cells
  adapt their metabolism to fulfill their increased demand for energy, biosynthetic
  intermediates, and to counter aerobic respiration-induced oxidative stress by: (1)
  increasing glucose uptake, (2) preferentially converting pyruvate to lactate by
  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) even under aerobic conditions (Warburg effect) to provide
  metabolic building blocks, (3) diverting glycolysis to pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP), where NADPH is produced to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ribose-5-phosphate
  (ribose-5-P) is produced to support nucleic acid synthesis, (4) promoting fatty
  acid oxidation to provide acetyl-CoA. GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
  G6PD: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, GSR: glutathione-disulfide reductase, GSSG:
  glutathione disulfide, GSH: glutathione.'
