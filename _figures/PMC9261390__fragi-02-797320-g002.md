caption: Summary of the impact each sphingolipid species have on the hallmarks of
  aging discussed in this review. (A) Early sphingolipid research uncovered the differential
  regulation of cell fate through the modulation of signaling pathways. Ceramide upregulation
  resulted in the activation of apoptosis and cell growth arrest while S1P is required
  for proper cellular growth. This is now known as the “Sphingolipid Rheostat” and
  is one of the fundamental concepts of sphingolipid biology. In age-related disease
  such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Huntington’s Disease (HD), Parkinson’s Disease
  (PD) and Cancer, the alterations in sphingolipid metabolism follows the rheostat.
  Changes in either pro-apoptotic or pro-survival signaling pathway is negatively
  correlated in the other. (B) Contributions of the major sphingolipid metabolites
  to the hallmarks of aging as mentioned in this review.
