caption: EV-mediated interactions between tissue macrophages and adjacent cells can
  induce tissue inflammation and injury. (A) Cardiac injury. M1 macrophages secrete
  extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing miR-155 that induce cardiomyocyte dysfunction,
  while EVs secreted by injured cardiomyocytes can activate macrophages. Conversely,
  exosomes secreted by M2 macrophages carry miRNA-148a, which can target cardiomyocytes
  and reduce myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. (B) Liver injury. EVs secreted
  by M1 macrophages can activate the hepatocyte NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and promote
  hepatocyte proliferation, liver fibrosis, and the secretion of inflammatory factors,
  including iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α, to cause liver injury. Stressed hepatocytes can
  secrete EV containing miR-192-5p, TRAIL and CD40L to promote M1 macrophage polarization.
  (C) Kidney injury. Tubular epithelial cells (TECs) secrete EVs enriched with miR-19b-3p,
  CCL2 and miR-23a that promote M1 macrophage polarization to induce tubulointerstitial
  inflammation. Conversely, M1 macrophages stimulated by high glucose secrete EVs
  that can activate NF-κB P65 signaling and promote proliferation of glomerular mesangial
  cells to cause kidney injury. (D) Lung injury. EVs secreted by lung epithelial cells
  carry miR-221, miR320a and caspase-3 to promote alveolar macrophages to adopt an
  M1 phenotype, while M1 macrophage EVs containing miR-155, miR-146a, miR-233 and
  miR-142 induce lung epithelial cell injury.
