caption: 'AA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that constitutes the phospholipid domain
  of most cell membranes. It is liberated from cellular membranes by cPLA2. Free AA
  can be metabolized through three major pathways: the PTGS/COX pathway, the LOX pathway,
  and the CYP pathway. In the CYP pathway, AA is converted to EETs and HETEs by CYP
  epoxygenases and CYP ω-hydroxylases, respectively. The EETs are then further metabolized
  to less active DHETs by sEH. MSPPOH is a selective inhibitor of CYP epoxygenases,
  and HET0016 is a selective inhibitor of CYP ω-hydroxylases. AR9281 is a selective
  inhibitor of sEH and is currently under evaluation in phase II clinical trials as
  a treatment for patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes.'
