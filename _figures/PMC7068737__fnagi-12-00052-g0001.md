caption: Mechanism of formation of 2SC. The figure shows the conversion of glucose
  to pyruvate in the glycolysis pathway. Then, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA,
  which enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the reducing equivalents (NADH
  and FADH2) generated from glycolysis and the TCA cycle enter the mitochondrial electron
  transport chain (ETC). So, glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and the ETC are integrated
  pathways to catabolize energy substrates and drive ATP synthesis via the complex
  V (ATP synthase). Complexes I–IV of the ETC and ATP synthase are shown. Importantly,
  the nucleophilic addition of the TCA cycle metabolite fumarate to cysteine yields
  2SC by a Michael addition reaction (R indicates peptide chain) in a non-enzymatic
  reaction called protein succination. Fumarate can also be exported outside mitochondria
  by carriers, potentially inducing 2SC formation in other cell proteins and even
  at the extracellular level.
