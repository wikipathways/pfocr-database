caption: Copper-signaling pathways and molecular targets in mammalian biology. Left
  (Cancer Cell), stimulation of growth factor receptors (GFRs) or mutations in proto-oncogene
  protein B-Raf (BRAF) cause activation of the MAPK pathway, leading to phosphorylation
  of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K1/2 or MEK1/2). MEK1/2 activation
  requires direct binding of cellular copper, which is supplied through the copper
  importer CTR1. Fully activated MEK1/2 phosphorylates MAPK or ERK, leading to tumor
  growth. Right (Adipocyte), activation of the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) causes
  recruitment of a G-protein (Gs) and activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC). Adenylyl
  cyclase converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP), which activates downstream pathways leading to lipolysis. The pathway is
  shut down when cAMP is hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE). However, direct
  binding of copper to phosphodiesterase inhibits cAMP hydrolysis and maintains activation
  of the lipolysis pathway.

  description: Copper-signaling pathways and molecular targets in mammalian biology.
    Left (Cancer Cell), stimulation of growth factor receptors (GFRs) or mutations
    in proto-oncogene protein B-Raf (BRAF) cause activation of the MAPK pathway, leading
    to phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K1/2 or MEK1/2).
    MEK1/2 activation requires direct binding of cellular copper, which is supplied
    through the copper importer CTR1. Fully activated MEK1/2 phosphorylates MAPK or
    ERK, leading to tumor growth. Right (Adipocyte), activation of the β-adrenergic

    monophosphate (cAMP), which activates downstream pathways leading to lipolysis.
    The pathway is shut down when cAMP is hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE).
    However, direct binding of copper to phosphodiesterase inhibits cAMP hydrolysis
