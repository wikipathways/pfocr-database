caption: Schematic illustration of the basic functioning of MAPK pathways.  Receptors
  sense specific extracellular stimuli (denoted by A, B, and C)  and activate MAPKKKs.
  This step usually involves other factors, such as  G proteins or protein kinases.
  Activation of MAPKKK results in  phosphorylation and activation of MAPKK. Some MAPKKKs
  are also capable  of activating unrelated protein kinases (PK) of other pathways.
  MAPKKs  activate MAPKs. MAPKs target different substrates, including  transcription
  factors, cytoskeletal proteins, or other kinases and  phosphatases, which are then
  directly or indirectly responsible for the  responses. Arrows indicate activation
  of targets.
