caption: The samples analyzed were obtained respectively from untreated K562 cells
  (a) or K562 cells treated with MTH (30 nM) + anti-microRNA-210 (b), MTH (c), or
  MTH + anti-microRNA-588 (d) (p<0.05). The differential expression of microRNAs can
  be easily followed by a color-bar approach indicating low levels (green) and high
  levels (red) of mRNA content.
