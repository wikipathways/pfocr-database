caption: 'Schematic representation of RAS pathway and its correlation with RASopathies.
  A growth factor activates its RTK causing phosphorylation of tyrosines, which are
  bound by adapter proteins, SHC/GRB2 and GAB. These interact with the activators
  of RAS, SOS1 and SHP2, and induce the dissociation of GDP and binding of GTP. RAS-GTP
  activates a cascade of downstream kinases: the MAPK pathway. On the other hand,
  the inhibition of RAS signaling is mediated by GAPs: RASA1 and neurofibromin 1.
  The RASopathies are developmental pathologies due to mutations on genes encoding
  proteins of the RAS pathway. HCM is uncommon in NS and CFC patients. However, nearly
  all NS patients with mutated RAF1 develop HCM. PTPN11 (encoding SHP2) loss-of-function
  mutations were observed in the majority of LS patients who developed HCM. Mutations
  in RAF1 have also been identified in a small percentage of LS with HCM. CS patients
  harboring HRAS mutations consistently show cardiac hypertrophy. Light gray shading
  indicates the mutation-specific syndromes accompanied by HCM; dark gray shading
  indicates those syndromes in which cardiac hypertrophy is less common.'
