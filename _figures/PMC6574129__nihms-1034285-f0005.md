caption: U2932 cells were treated with 50nM alisertib, 2.0μM ibrutinib and their combination
  for 4 days. Western blotting shows (A) Down regulation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT
  pathways but up regulation of DNA damage response, (B) Single agent alisertib induces
  aneuploidy due to active mTOR/AKT and ERK/MAPK pathways. But combination therapy
  able to overcome aneuploidy and senescence illustrated in (C).
