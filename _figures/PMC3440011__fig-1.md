caption: Two pathways, Ga13 pathway and Gai pathway, are connected via Gaq pathway.
  The figure shows how our storytelling framework connects two consecutive pathways
  based on subgraph overlap. Note that Ga13 and Gai pathways do not have significant
  overlap between them, but both of them have significant subgraph overlap with the
  intermediate Gaq pathway.
