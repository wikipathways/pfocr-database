  of this signaling pathway induces degradation of sarcomere components and ignites
  a muscle pro-atrophy response. The same degradative molecular program is also triggered
  by fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in the setting of mitochondrial dysfunction
  and oxidative stress. In this case, the release of FGF21 stimulates the expression
