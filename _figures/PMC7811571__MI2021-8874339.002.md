caption: Overview of the main TLR4 signalling pathways. TLR4 can be activated by LPS
  (classical PAMP), DAMPs, or viral PAMPs. LPS is also picked up by the LPS-binding
  protein (LBP) present in the blood and in extracellular fluid in tissues. LPS is
  transferred from LBP to the coreceptor CD14. Recognition by MD2 and TLR4 binding
  results in the nuclear induction of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 via the
  MyD88-dependent pathway involving IRAKs, TABs, TAK, MAP kinases, and IKK isoforms.
  This results in the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and regulators of
  cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. In fibroblasts, this pathway
  mediates myofibroblast differentiation and results in CTGF and collagen production
  [], while the alternative pathway is endosomal and involves TRIF and TRAM complex
  formation at the TIR domain. The alternative pathway results in the expression of
  anti-inflammatory cytokines, interferons α and β regulated by interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3), in addition to some NF-κB nuclear translocation. “Cross-talk” activation
  between the two pathways is indicated by brown arrows. Adaptors and cascade proteins
  are usually in homodimers, like the TLR4 receptor [], but were omitted here for
  simplicity.
