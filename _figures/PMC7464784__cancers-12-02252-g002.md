caption: Illustrating the metabolic components contributing to drug resistance and
  drugs to overcome the resistance. The five panels show various signaling pathways
  converging to increased glycolysis and drugs as monotherapy or combinations that
  modify these pathways, which help to reverse the resistance mechanism. (A) Metabolic
  components contributing to paclitaxel resistance include upregulated expression
  of GLUT, HK2, LDHA, and PFKFB3, thereby switching the metabolism of cancer cells
  to aerobic glycolysis. Drugs targeting these enzymes potentially downregulate aerobic
  glycolysis, lactate production, and drug efflux pumps. PAMAM-PTX is a conjugated
  drug targeted to mitochondria via GLUT []. (B) Targeting PI3K/AKT pathway and G6PDH
  can reverse cisplatin resistance []. (C) Increased expression of EN, PDK4, HK2,
  and LDHA confers resistance to tamoxifen. PI3K/AKT pathway plays an essential role
  in Warburg’s effect []. (D) Various combinations of drugs can reverse the glycolytic
  phenotype and reverse multidrug resistance. Lonidamine and 3-BrPy are already in
  the clinical trial phase. (E) A combination of drugs targeting HER2 can downregulate
  PI3K/AKT and decrease aerobic glycolysis by resensitization of cancer cells to trastuzumab.
  Drug interventions that inhibit the non-glycolytic and tumor-promoting functions
  of the enzymes/pathway components are shown as black T-ended stop bar. The red arrows
  indicate components and pathways that contribute to drug resistance, thereby promoting
  tumor progression. In contrast, the blue arrows indicate components and pathways
  that contribute to the reversal of drug resistance/resensitization to the drug,
  thus supporting tumor suppression/regression. The green T-ended stop bar indicates
  the reversal of resistance/resensitization to the drug.
