caption: Role of myosin II in C. trachomatis cellular exit by extrusion. After internalization,
  C. trachomatis efficiently replicates inside a specialized vacuole called inclusion.
  On the inclusion membrane, Chlamydia effector CT228 is found to colocalize with
  MYPT1 that is recruited early during infection. The localization and activation
  status of MYPT1 regulates the cell exit strategy of the bacteria. MYPT1 activated
  state (non-phosphorylated) is associated with Chlamydia exit through lysis. Extrusion
  pathway is associated with relocalization of MYPT1 in Src kinase-rich regions on
  the inclusion membrane in which MYPT1 could progressively be phosphorylated on both
  inhibitory sites, T696 and T853 by Src kinase and therefore inactivated. This may
  lead to the MLC2 release from its interaction with MYPT1 and its subsequent availability
  to be phosphorylated and activated by MLCK, triggering the recruitment of myosin
  II on Src kinase-rich regions. Myosin II is then used as a tether to walk along
  the actin to the plasma membrane and create an extrusion.
