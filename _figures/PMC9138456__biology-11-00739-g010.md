caption: Flow chart of the experimental protocol. A total of 28 rats were enrolled
  in this experiment and underwent randomization. Rats were assigned to 4 groups.
  The total number of samples was 7 for biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical
  examinations and 5 for RT-PCR gene expression analysis.
