caption: Summary of the most important metabolic mechanisms proposed to occur in both
  cancer and Sertoli cells (SCs). The high-affinity glucose transporters (GLUT1 and
  GLUT3) are present in the plasma membrane and are responsible for adaptive mechanisms
  under unfavorable conditions of glucose/insulin deregulation. In normal conditions
  these cells metabolize glucose into pyruvate in a multistep reaction where phosphofructokinase
  (PFK) is known to play a key role. Pyruvate is converted into lactate, by lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDH), that is then exported through the action of specific monocarboxylate
  transporters (MCTs). The Krebs cycle is known to be repressed in these cells but,
  under specific circumstances, several intermediates are known to be essential to
  maintain lactate production and/or the proliferative/nonproliferative activity of
  the cells. Glutaminolysis is represented, as it is a well-known source of pyruvate
  and is associated with tumorigenesis of cancer cells, as well as SC normal functioning.
  The action of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in acetyl-CoA formation is also highlighted
  since fatty acids and lipid synthesis occur at high rates in SC and cancer cells.
  The pentose phosphate pathway is also represented since it is stimulated by high
  glycolytic fluxes and both SCs and cancer cells present a high capacity for biosynthesis
  of nucleotides.
