caption: 'Graphical depiction of mechanisms responsible for inflammatory response
  mediating the onset of cancer via STAT3 signaling pathway. A large number of conserved
  upstream receptors, known to be important in cancer progression, can activate the
  canonical STAT3 signaling pathway. Cognate ligands that stimulate these receptors
  include hormones, cytokines, growth factors, LPS, and others. Following phosphorylation,
  homodimerisation, and nuclear translocation of the STAT3 dimer, the cytoplasmic
  STAT3 molecule is activated. The transcriptional machinery responsible for multiple
  features of cancer progression, including stimulation of immune escape, induction
  of proliferation, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of apoptosis,
  angiogenesis, metastasis, chemoresistance, and radio-resistance, as well as an increase
  in the expression of tumor-related genes, is activated by the STAT3 dimer within
  the nucleus. GRIM-19 facilitates the recruitment of non-canonical STAT3 signaling
  to mitochondria. MitoStat3, also known as mitochondrial STAT3, controls events other
  than transcription, such as ATP generation, reduction of ROS release, and elevation
  of mitochondrial Ca2+. Abbreviations: CXCR4, CXC chemokine receptor 4; STAT3, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3; VEGF, vascular endothelial factor;
  CXCR4, CXC chemokine receptor 4; NK, natural killer; BIRC5, baculoviral inhibitor
  of apoptosis repeat-containing 5; NKp30, natural cytotoxicity receptor 1 (NCR1);
  MMP, Matrix metalloproteinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; EGFR, epidermal growth factor
  receptor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; Ca2+, calcium;
  PD-L1, programmed death-ligand, BCL-XL, B-cell lymphoma-extra-large; TLR, Toll-like
  receptor; P, phosphate group; MCL1, myeloid cell leukemia-1; MCL1, myeloid cell
