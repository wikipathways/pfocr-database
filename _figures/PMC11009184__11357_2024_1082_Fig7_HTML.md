caption: A comparison of aging related changes in the eIF4 and P70S6K signaling pathway
  between mice and humans for each sex separately. (A) A schematic overview of the
  changes in the expression of the involved genes in old vs. young male humans and
  mice. (B) A heatmap with hierarchical clustering of genes significantly differentially
  expressed in old vs. young male humans and/or mice. The same schematic overview
  (C) and heatmap (D) were created using the results of the comparison between old
  and young female humans and mice as input. In all figures a red color indicates
  an increased expression, and a green color indicates a decreased expression in the
  aged group compared to the young group. For mice, data belonging to the comparison
  between the oldest group (25 months) with the youngest group (4 months) was used
