caption: Cellular mechanism of the LPS in the liver and interaction of PPARα at several
  levels of the inflammatory signaling pathway. Interaction with the NFκB pathway.
  LPS increases cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 through theNFκB pathway.
  Fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist, inhibits the NFκB pathway through blocking translocation
  of NFκB into nucleus. (1) Inhibition of phosphorylation of IκB. (2) Inhibition of
  nuclear translocation of inflammatory transcription factors. (3) Interference with
  activation of the transcription initiation complex via cofactor interaction.
