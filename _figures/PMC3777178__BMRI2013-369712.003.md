caption: Multifunctional phosphorylated PDZ proteins integrate signaling pathways
  to control hyperplasia, neoplasia, and cell metastasis. Modified forms of PDZ proteins
  are potential molecular markers predicting the aggressiveness of malignancy. Candidates
  include Dlg phosphorylated by PKA, JNK, CDK1, or CDK2; Scrib interaction with ERK;
  Scrib recruitment of PP1gamma for downregulation of the MAPK pathway. No studies
  that could offer an explanation of the phosphorylation of MAGI-1 and PTEN by MAPK
  are currently available.
