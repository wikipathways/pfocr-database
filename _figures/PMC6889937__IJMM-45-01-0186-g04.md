caption: Proposed action pathway through which Hnk protects cardio-myocytes against
  Dox-induced senescence. In response to Dox stimulation, TXNIP induces NLRP3 activation,
  which promotes IL-1β expression by cleavage of caspase-1. The increased IL-1β expression
  is necessary for inflammation and senescence in the cardiomyocytes. Hnk suppresses
  cardiomyocyte senescence via regulation of TXNIP and effectively inhibits IL-1β
  induction by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. The resultant inhibition of
  inflammation and protection of cells from senescence leads to the amelioration of
  cardiac dysfunction. Dox, doxorubicin; Hnk, honokiol; TXNIP, thioredoxin-interacting
  protein; NLRP3, NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3; IL, interleukin.
