caption: A) The role of FXRs in bile homeostasis and liver disease. B) Various FXR
  binding agents. CYP7A1 activity affects the overall rate of bile acid synthesis.
  Hepatic FXR activation reduces CYP7A1 mRNA expression by activating small heterodimer
  partner (SHP). FXR signaling plays an essential role in the control of hepatic de
  novo lipogenesis via SHP- mediated inhibition of SREBP-1c. SHP is also expressed
  in HSCs, and FXR ligands inhibit their activation and collagen synthesis. In enterocytes,
  FXR through Ileal bile acid-binding protein (IBABP), induces intestinal hormone
  fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), which activates FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) signaling
  in hepatocytes to inhibit CYP7A1 via triggering the extracellular stress-activated
  receptor kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a semi-synthetic bile
  acid analogue of 6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid (6-ECDCA), is used as a medication
  for treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. In REGENERATE trial, OCA improved
  fibrosis in NASH patients.
