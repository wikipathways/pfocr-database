caption: Schematic illustration of the Shh, TGF-β/BMP, and Wnt morphogenic signaling
  pathways. (a) Shh signaling pathway. Hhs like Shh are known to activate signaling
  through binding their receptor Patched (Ptch1; a 12-pass transmembrane protein).
  This leads to relief of inhibition of Smoothened (Smo; a 7-pass transmembrane protein),
  which then leads to a downstream intracellular signaling cascade. Smo then associates
  with the Gli/Ci-containing complex, which includes Costal 2 (Cos2), and the protein
  kinase Fused (Fu) and Su (fu) (suppressor of fused). Together, this complex acts
  constitutively to suppress the pathway by activating proteolysis of Gli/Ci, thus
  acting as a transcriptional repressor. Activation of Hh signaling reverses this
  regulatory inhibition of Gli/Ci, allowing transcription of Hh target genes. (b)
  TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway. Members of the DPP/BMP/TGF-β family of morphogens regulate
  cell fate and proliferation through binding to the extracellular domain of type
  I and type II TGF-β receptors, causing dimerization and autophosphorylation of the
  type I receptor's intracellular kinase domain. Targets of the type I receptor are
  the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), which are subsequently phosphorylated inducing
  their association with co-Smads before translocating to the nucleus where they combine
  with other DNA-binding proteins (Fast1) to initiate transcription of TGF-β/BMP target
  genes. (c) Canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway
  (β-catenin dependent) pathway controls gene expression through stabilization of
  intracellular β-catenin. Binding of Wnt to its receptor Frizzled (Fz; a 7-pass transmembrane
  protein), with coreceptor LRP-5/6, leads to Dishevelled (Dsh) activation and suppression
  of GSK3β activity, thus preventing phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal
  degradation of β-catenin. This requires formation of a complex scaffolded by axin
  and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) proteins. Increased concentrations of β-catenin
  transform lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)/T-cell factor (TCF) from transcriptional
  repressor to activator thereby leading to transcription of Wnt target genes. (d)
  Non-canonical signaling pathways. The two non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways include
  the Wnt/Ca2+pathway and the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. The Wnt/Ca2+pathway
  also involves binding of Wnt to Fz and subsequent Dsh activation, but instead signals
  via heterotrimeric G-proteins (α, β, γ subunits) leading to activation of phospholipase
  C (PLC) and increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, while simultaneously activating
  protein kinase C (PKC). Increased Ca2+ leads to activation of calcineurin and CaMKII.
  CaMKII induces activation of the transcription factor NFAT, which leads to transcription
  of Wnt/Ca2+ target genes involved in cell adhesion and migration. The Wnt/PCP pathway
  also involves Wnt binding Fz leading to recruitment and activation of Dsh, which
  then forms a complex with Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (Daam1).
  Daam1 subsequently activates the G-protein Rho, which leads to activation of Rho-associated
  kinase (ROCK), a major regulator of the cellular cytoskeleton. Dsh also forms a
  complex with Rac, which activates JNK and leads to actin polymerization
