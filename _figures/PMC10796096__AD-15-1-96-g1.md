caption: 'cGAS-STING signaling pathway in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). TDP-43
  translocated into mitochondria induces the release of mitochondrial DNA, which is
  recognized by cGAS. The activation of cGAS enzymatic function leads to the synthesis
  of a potent ligand cGAMP, which further activates STING. This induces phosphorylation
  of STING and activation of downstream TBK1-IRF3 pathway. The cGAS-STING signaling
  pathway also promote NF-κB signaling, leading to hyperactive type I IFN responses.
  Multiple ALS-implicated genes are involved in this complex signaling network. This
