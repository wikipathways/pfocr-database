caption: 'A: Classical pathway of RB and G1/S transition. Small cell cycle inhibitors
  of the INK4 and CIP/KIP families inhibit the activity of Cyclin/Cdk complexes, which
  consequently maintain the activity of RB by preventing it from being phosphorylated.
  Unphosphorylated RB would bind E2F family proteins and block their activities as
  transfactors; B: Beyond the classical pathway, RB also controls the cell cycle by
  blocking the degradation of the p27 small cell cycle inhibitor.'
