caption: Retinoid refractoriness due to phosphorylation of retinoid X receptor α and
  its restoration by acyclic retinoid in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells [modified
  from reference ()]. When acyclic retinoid (ACR) binds to and activates retinoid
  X receptor (RXR) α in normal hepatocytes, the receptor forms homodimers and/or heterodimers
  with other nuclear receptors, including retinoic acid receptors (RARs). This results
  in expression of target genes, which regulate normal cell proliferation and differentiation
  and modulate the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle progression, by binding to
  the specific response elements. Thereafter, RXRα dissociates from the dimer and
  is degraded by the proteasome via ubiquitination (Ub) (A). In HCC cells, several
  types of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as epidermal growth factor receptor
  superfamily, and their downstream Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
  are highly activated, which results in the phosphorylation of ERK and RXRα and subsequent
  suppression of dimer formation and transactivation functions of RXRα (refractoriness
  to retinoid). Phosphorylated-RXRα (pi-RXRα) escapes from ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation and accumulates in liver cells (B). Subsequently, pi-RXRα interferes
  with the physiological actions of the remaining unphosphorylated RXRα, presumably
  in a dominant-negative manner, contributing to liver carcinogenesis (C). ACR inhibits
  phosphorylation of RXRα, restores the function of the receptor, and activates transcriptional
  activity of the responsive element (D). This is accomplished by inhibiting the Ras/MAPK
  signaling pathway and the ligand-dependent RTK activities, which contribute to prevention
  of liver carcinogenesis and suppression of growth in HCC cells (E).
