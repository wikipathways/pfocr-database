caption: Pyroptosis pathways. (A) In the non-canonical inflammasome pathway, bacterial
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) recognizes and activates caspase-4/5/11 to cleave gasdermin
  D (GSDMD) and induce pyroptosis. (B) In the canonical inflammasome pathway, the
  inflammasomes recruit and bind to ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  a CARD), leading to ASC focus, which in turn recruits procaspase-1 and activates
  caspase-1. Caspase-1 is involved in the cleavage and maturation of proIL-18/1β and
  cleavage of GSDMD. The released N-terminal fragment of GSDMD (GSDMD-NT) creates
  pores in the plasma membrane, resulting in the secretion of IL-18/1β and causing
  water influx, and consequently cell swelling and osmotic lysis. The C-terminal fragment
  of GSDMD (GSDMD-CT) stays within the cytoplasm. (C) A new pyroptosis pathway revealed
  that certain stimulations activate caspase-3, a molecular considered as a substrate
  of apoptosis. Mature caspase-3 induces the cleavage of gasdermin E (GSDME), including
  its C-terminal and N-terminal fragments (GSDME-CT and GSDME-NT, respectively). Furthermore,
  GSDME-NT participants in the pore formation, resulting in pyroptosis.
