caption: Role of efferocytosis in tumor. Efferocytosis promotes the formation of immunosuppressive
  TME, tumor growth, and metastasis. First, after phagocytosis of dying cells in the
  TME by TAMs, cholesterol, a product of digestion, activates PPAR‐γ and LXR‐α, which
  subsequently, through a downstream signaling pathway, polarizes the TAMs toward
  the M2 phenotype. M2‐like macrophages secrete anti‐inflammatory cytokines, for example,
  IL‐4, IL‐10, and TGF‐β, which recruit Treg, and Th2 cells. These anti‐inflammatory
  factors recruit Treg, Th2 cells, which participate in the formation of an immunosuppressive
  TME. Reduced antigen presentation to T cells by M2‐like macrophages suppresses CD8+
  T cells, ultimately impairing antigen‐dependent antitumor immunity. In addition,
  the efferocytosis process induces upregulation of PD‐L1. PD‐L1 binds to PD‐1 receptor
  expressed on tumor–infiltrating activated T cells, leading to negative regulation
  of tumor‐reactive T cell activation and attenuation of antitumor T cell responses.
  Efferocytosis directly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, which activate
  downstream caspase‐1 and lead to subsequent IL‐1β secretion, thereby promoting tumor
  growth. M2‐like macrophages produce growth factors, such as EGF, FGF, and VEGF,
  which promote tumor vascularization. Efferocytosis directly activates nlrp3 inflammatory
  vesicles in macrophages, which activate downstream caspase‐1 and lead to subsequent
  IL‐1β secretion, thereby promoting tumor growth. M2‐like macrophages produce growth
  factors, such as EGF, FGF, and VEGF, which promote tumor vascularization. These
  new blood vessels provide the main pathway for tumor cells to leave the primary
  tumor site and enter the circulation, thus promoting metastatic spread of the tumor.
  Finally, M2‐like macrophages also secrete MMP‐9, which digests the extracellular
  matrix and promotes tumor metastasis
