caption: 'The wrong pathway from 5aizc to pyruvate calculated from GBA. Aspartate
  is a co-substrate for the first reaction but it cannot be produced from 5aizc. Therefore,
  no stoichiometrically balanced pathway from 5aizc can be obtained by FBA analysis.
  5aizc: 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxylate; 25aics: (S)-2-[5-Amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinate'
