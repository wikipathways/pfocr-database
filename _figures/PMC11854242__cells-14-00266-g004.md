caption: 'The Rho/ROCK/MRTF/SRF transcription pathway and its upstream regulation
  by the actin cytoskeleton in liver fibrosis. MRTFs (MRTF-A/MRTF-B) are transcriptional
  coactivators regulated by the ratio of F-actin to G-actin. Cytosolic G-actin binds
  MRTF masking a nuclear localization sequence. The activation of small RHAs by specific
  GEFs promotes F-actin polymerization via the RhoA effectors ROCK 1 and ROCK2, thereby
  reducing the cytosolic G-actin pool. This causes G-actin to dissociate from MRTF,
  unmasking the nuclear localization sequence, thereby allowing MRTF to translocate
  into the nucleus. MRTF binds the transcription factor SRF, forming the MRTF/SRF
  complex, which induces gene expression by binding SRE response elements. This, in
  turn, activates the transcription of genes encoding a subset of contractile proteins
  and fibrosis-associated proteins. Upstream activators of the pathway are biomechanical
  forces transduced by integrins, certain GPCRs, and TGF-β. Abbreviations: AngII,
  angiotensin II; COL1A1, collagen type I alpha 1; CTGF, connective tissue growth
  factor; ECM, extracellular matrix; ET-1, endothelin-1; FAK, focal adhesion kinase;
  FN1, fibronectin 1; HSC, hepatic stellate cell; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; MLC,
  myosin light chain; RHO-GEF, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate;
  ACTA2, smooth muscle actin (SMA); SRF, serum response factor; TGF-β, transforming
  growth transforming growth factor beta. The compounds that can influence some stages
  of the Hippo/YAP/TAZ pathway are highlighted in red. (Created with BioRender.com,
