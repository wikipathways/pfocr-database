caption: Cell intrinsic recognition. Dendritic cells directly infected by viruses
  recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns(PAMPs) (blue) within the cytosol
  via RIG-I like receptors (RLRs). Cytosolic viral proteins (red) are processed and
  presented on MHC class I (via the conventional ER pathway) or major histocompatability
  complex (MHC) class II (via autophagy). RLR signaling leads to the induction of
  costimulatory molecules and cytokines necessary for activation and differentiation
  of T lymphocytes. How the origin of antigen is established in this case is unclear.
  In the case of MHC class I pathway, this may depend on the abundance of viral antigens.
  In the case of MHC class II pathway, it may depend on targeting of viral antigens
  by the autophagy machinery.
