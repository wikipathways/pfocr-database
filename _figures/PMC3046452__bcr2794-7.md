caption: Model of melatonin regulation of breast cancer cell invasion. Ligand-dependent
  activation of the membrane-associated G-protein-coupled receptor MT1 leads to coupling
  of Gi2 protein to MT1 receptor. As a result, the Gαi2 subunit dissociates from the
  Gβγ subunits and inhibits the activity of adenylcyclase (AC), and this leads to
  a decrease in the intracellular level of cAMP and inhibition of protein kinase A
  (PKA) activity. The cAMP/PKA pathway cross-talks with the p38 pathway through PKA.
  In response to the reduced cAMP level, activity of p38 is suppressed, and this causes
  further downregulation of MMP-9 expression via repression of ETS1 transcriptional
  activity and, potentially, downregulation of MMP-2 transcription. MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.
