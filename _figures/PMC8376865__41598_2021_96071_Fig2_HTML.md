caption: Diagram of Leukocyte extravasation signaling (LES) canonical pathways with
  overlaid molecular activity prediction as identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) analysis of the differentially expressed genes in mandibular condylar cartilage
  zones and femoral condylar cartilage (FCC). The upregulated (red color) and downregulated
  (green color) genes identified in six comparisons, MZvC (a), HZvC (b), FZvMZ (c),
  FZvHZ (d), PZvMZ (e), PZvHZ (f) are shown along with predictions on biological function.
  Cell mobility, cell polarity, tail retraction, and actin cytoskeleton contraction
  biologic processes were predicted to be activated (orange color) at the deep zones
  (MZ & HZ) as compared FCC. These processes are predicted to be decreased (blue color)
  at MCC superficial layer (FZ & PZ) when compared to deeper zones. Data were analyzed
  through the use of IPA (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis).
