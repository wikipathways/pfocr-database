caption: 'Shortest path network of genes involved in apoptosis related pathways developed
  in MetaCore including the affected biological processes. (A) Network description:
  Shortest path network prefiltered on a subcellular level indicating the localization
  of gene expression of a selection of genes modulated in apoptosis-related pathways.
  Those genes for which the gene product eventually will result in a cellular effect
  were defined as target genes and grouped at the base of the network. The color of
  the upper right small circle at each network object indicates whether the gene was
  upregulated (red) or downregulated (blue). Detailed information on the symbols can
  be found at www.genego.com/pdf/MC_legend.pdf. Gene Symbols, full names and information
  on the function of the genes, including their full name can be found at EntrezGene
  (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/). The expression of a number of ligands was increased,
  that is, IL1B, IFN, and FASLG. FASLG can bind to both the death receptor TNFRSF1A
  and FAS, which were both upregulated. In addition, more cell type-specific genes
  encoding for membrane receptors were modulated, such as TLR4 (upregulated), beta-2
  adrenergic receptor (upregulated), IGF1R (downregulated), and IFNGR1 (upregulated).
  Upon binding of ligands to these extracellular receptors, several signaling cascades
  are initiated, such as PI3K/AKT and G-protein signaling, but also activation of
  downstream targets by MAP kinases, TRAFs, MTOR, PKC, and calmodulin. Activation
  of FAS and TNFRSF1A results in the recruitment and activation of the initiator CASP8.
  Active CASP8 subsequently cleaves and activates CASP7, CASP6, and CASP3. Activation
  of CASP3 leads to the ultimate death of the cell. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling
  cascades results in induction of apoptosis, cell survival, and cell cycle progression.
  Genes involved in this cascade were modulated, that is, GNAS2, GNAO1, GNG2, RACK1,
  and GNB5 (all encoding G-proteins), and PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and PKA (all downregulated).
  The PI3Ks can also be activated by FYN, which in turn is activated through binding
  of nicotine to the CHRNA. The downstream effector protein AKT acts via inhibition
  of FKHR or via activation of p70 S6 kinase 1 (RPS6KB1), thereby initiating apoptosis
  and downregulating cell survival. In addition to the extrinsic death receptor pathway,
  the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway was modulated. Associated with mitochondrial
  regulation of apoptosis are the members of the apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 family.
  The antiapoptotic genes BCL2 and MCL1 were downregulated, thereby abolishing their
  inhibiting effects on apoptosis. Furthermore, BAK1 and BAX were upregulated, which
  are proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 gene family involved in initiating apoptosis.
  (B) Affected biological processes based on the interpretation of gene annotation
  and function retrieved from EntrezGene (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/) and MetaCore.
  The color of the square indicates whether the process will be activated (red) or
  deactivated (green). To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to
