caption: The effects of silica NPs on Wnt signaling. Wnt signal is transduced via
  its receptor, Dvl, the degradation complex and β-Catenin, through which Wnt regulates
  its target gene expression and multiple biological processes (blue arrow-guided
  pathway). Cellular uptake of silica NPs promotes Dvl degradation via the endosome-lysosome
  pathway, and prevents Wnt signal transduction (orange arrow-guided pathway). Blocking
  the endosome-lysosome pathway enables Dvl to avoid silica NPs-induced degradation
  and rescues Wnt signaling (purple arrow-guided pathway).
