caption: The protective effects of sea cucumber and wild blueberry extracts on acute
  respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) model of acute lung injury (ALI) and the underlying
  mechanisms. Schematic view of the TLR4 and signaling pathway for C. frondosa extracts
  and V. angustifolium extracts as well as their combinations in the metabolism of
  LPS-induced infection. The extracts of C. frondosa extracts and V. angustifolium
  act by repressing NFκB and MAPK signaling pathways. The dotted lines represent postulated
  cell signaling pathways. TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; JNK, c-JUN N-terminal kinases; ERK, serine/threonine
  protein kinase; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; iNOS, nitric
  oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; PGE2, prostaglandin E2, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, Interleukins;
  TNF-α, tissue necrosis factor-alpha.
