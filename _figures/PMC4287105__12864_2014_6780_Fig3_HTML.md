caption: 'Example of difference between LW and MS at fetal gestational age 110: pathway
  of Gluconeogenesis. This figure represents the metabolic pathway of glycolysis and
  gluconeogenesis. Genes circled in orange (GPI, GBP2, PDHA1, DLD) are up-regulated
  at day 110 in KEGG pathway gluconeogenesis in both extreme breeds. Genes circled
  in red (PGK1, PCK2, LDHA) are up-regulated at day 110 in KEGG pathway gluconeogenesis
  in MS only. Box-plots of PCK2, PGK1 and LDHA are added and allow to observe up-regulated
  genes at day 110 in MS only. The gene expression were log2 transformed. The red-circled
  genes illustrate the difference of maturity between MS and LW.'
