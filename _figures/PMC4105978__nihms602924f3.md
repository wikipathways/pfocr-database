caption: Model of arteriovenous EC specification during embryonic development. Angioblasts
  derived from the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) are specified into either arterial
  or venous ECs prior to migration to the midline where they form the dorsal aorta
  (DA) and posterior cardinal vein (PCV). Specification is initiated by the expression
  of sonic hedgehog (Shh) by the notochord (Nc) and floor plate of the neural tube
  (NT), with Shh then acting on the adjacent somites (S) to induce the expression
  of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In arterial-fated angioblasts, VEGF
  signaling via a VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)/neuropilin 1 (NP-1) complex leads to the
  downstream activation of Notch and ERK signaling and the subsequent expression of
  the arterial marker ephrinB2. Foxc1 and Foxc2 (Foxc1/2) are transcriptional factors
  that control the expression of Notch components and therefore also promote arterial
  EC identity. In venous-fated angioblasts, COUP-TFII blocks NP-1 expression, which
  prevents Notch and ERK activation, and the venous marker EphB4 is expressed. Activation
  of the PI3K/AKT pathway also blocks ERK, which represses arterial EC fate. Adapted
