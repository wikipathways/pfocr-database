caption: LKB1 activation due to glycolysis inhibition is essential for the antiproliferative
  activity of EGFR TKI in EGFRWT NSCLCs by activating AMPK to suppress mTORC1 function.
  However, cigarette smoke and its ingredient B[α]P represses LKB1 expression by enhancing
  its promoter CpG island methylation which renders NSCLC cells resistant to EGFR
  TKI. The addition of AMPK activator metformin can overcome EGFR TKI resistance in
  response to cigarette smoke exposure in patients with EGFRWT NSCLC.
