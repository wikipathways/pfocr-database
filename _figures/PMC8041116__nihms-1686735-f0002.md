caption: Mitochondrial oxidation of nutrients, including glucose, amino acids and
  fatty acids, through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport
  chain (ETC) is a highly efficient means of producing energy for quiescent, differentiated
  cells. However, during periods of increased proliferation, such as after immune
  activation or malignant transformation, cells upregulate an alternative pathway
  for glucose metabolism, called aerobic glycolysis. Although less efficient in generating
  ATP, aerobic glycolysis allows for more rapid metabolism of glucose, efficient disposal
  of excess carbon and regeneration of NAD+ while preserving mitochondrial enzymatic
  activity for anabolic processes. Glycolytic intermediates are channelled through
  other essential pathways, such as the pentose phosphate pathway, the one-carbon
  pathway and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. These pathways support cellular
  processes that are critical for highly proliferative cells, such as synthesis of
  fatty acids and nucleic acids. Pathways for the metabolism of glutamine are also
  upregulated in the setting of increased proliferation. In addition to supplying
  the TCA cycle with carbon skeletons that maintain intermediates for biosynthesis
  of amino acids, nucleic acids and fatty acids (a process known as anaplerosis),
  glutamine is the primary source of nitrogen used for amino acid and nucleic acid
  synthesis. These cells also upregulate a broad range of amino acid transporters
  and maintain tightly controlled redox balance, primarily through NADPH synthesis.
  Many cells within the tumour microenvironment (TME) express ectoenzymes, such as
  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), arginase 1 (ARG1) and CD73, which deplete nutrients,
  as well as increase immunosuppressive metabolites, such as kynurenine and adenosine.
  Along with a deranged microvasculature, these metabolic adaptations can have profound
  effects on the metabolic make-up of the TME, leading to depletion of vital nutrients,
  hypoxia, acidosis and the generation of immune-toxic metabolites as shown. MDSC,
  myeloid-derived suppressor cell; R-2-HG, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; Teff, effector T; Treg, regulatory T.
