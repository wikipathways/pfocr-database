caption: 'Microenvironmental and spatial regulation of signaling pathways controlling
  EMT. The RAS–ERK1/ERK2 pathway is an example of a signaling module that is responsive
  to microenvironmental cues and requires specific subcellular localization to determine
  the consequences of gene expression and tumor phenotype. A simplified version of
  this complex process is illustrated in the diagram. ECM components interact with
  integrin receptors at the cell surface (step 1) and the affinity of this interaction
  is modified by growth-factor-regulated signaling, in a process known as ‘inside-out
  signaling’ (steps 1–3). Conversely, the affinity of the integrin–ECM interaction
  affects growth-factor-regulated signaling, in a process known as ‘outside-in signaling’
  (steps 2–3). The collective interactions between integrins and growth factor receptors
  promote the localization and activation of lipid-modified RAS (step 2) at the inner
  cell membrane leaflet (step 4). Activated RAS then selectively activates kinases,
  such as ERK1/ERK2 and other pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway. RAS also blocks
  the tumor-suppressing activity of TGF-β1 by linking this pathway to ERK1/ERK2 signaling
  pathways (step 5). This linkage promotes the proinvasion properties of TGF-β1. Activated
  ERK1/ERK2 must translocate to the nucleus or cell-adhesion sites (known as ‘focal
  contacts’) to have access to target proteins that regulate EMT, motility and/or
  invasion. ERK1-regulated and ERK2-regulated gene expression (e.g. MMP9) further
  modifies the microenvironment of the tumor cell, thereby affecting the activation
  status of the integrin–growth factor receptor signaling pathway. This downstream
  consequence of RAS–ERK1–ERK2 activation and the reversal of steps 1–5 have profound
  effects on the phenotype even if other pathways are mutated. Abbreviations: AKT,
  protein kinase B; ECM, extracellular matrix; EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal transition;
  ERK1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1; ERK2, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 2; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinoinositol 3-kinase;
