caption: The Ca2+/calcineurin pathway and Ras-signaling pathway in C. neoformans.
  These two pathways are also involved in a variety of stress responses, including
  thermotolerance and pheromone-responsive mating. Calmodulin (Cam1) binds four Ca2+
  molecules via four EF hand motifs. Subsequently, Ca2+-bound Cam1 activates calcineurin,
  a complex composed of a catalytic subunit A and a regulatory subunit B. Cyclophilin
  A and FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) bound with CsA and FK506, respectively, inhibit
  the activation of calcineurin. The Ras-signaling pathway governs thermotolerance
  in a Cdc24 (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and Cdc42 (GTPase)-dependent manner.
  Ras1 and Ras2 share some functions in both thermotolerance and mating.
