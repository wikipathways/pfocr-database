caption: H. pylori CagA cracks the host signaling via its interaction with Crk. CagA
  translocated from H. pylori into the host cell is tyrosine phosphorylated by SFKs
  and interacts with Crk/Crk-L adaptors. Crk is involved in MAPK activation leading
  to cell growth and proliferation through the Crk/SoS1/H-Ras/Raf1 and Crk/C3G/Rap1/B-Raf
  pathways. Crk also promotes Rac1 activity through the Crk/Dock180/ELMO pathway.
  Activated Rac1 induces actin reorganization by stimulating downstream effectors
  such as WAVE family proteins. These motogenic, mitogenic, and morphologic effects
  downstream of CagA/Crk signaling are required for H. pylori–induced cell scattering/hummingbird
  phenotype and cell–cell dissociation.
