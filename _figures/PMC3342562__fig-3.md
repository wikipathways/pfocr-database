caption: Schematic diagrams of the cytoprotective effects of H2S against hypoxia/ischemia-induced
  injury. H2S can protect cells from hypoxia/ischemia via different mechanisms. Up-regulation
  of H2S by pharmacological agents leads to an increase in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and
  preservation of mitochondrial function, resulting in increased cell survival. Simultaneously,
  H2S may also directly enhance antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
  glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), which act as reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers
  to neutralize its pro-oxidant activity. (To see this illustration in color the reader
