caption: '( A) α-Granules derive from two major pathways: synthetic and endocytic.
  The synthetic pathway originates at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Soluble clathrin
  molecules recruited to the TGN self-assemble into a lattice structure and interact
  with coat proteins, presumed to be adaptor protein 1 (AP1), to form clathrin-coated
  pits. These pits invaginate to bud off early membrane-bound vesicles that are ultimately
  directed to early endosomes. Endocytic vesicles originate similarly at the plasma
  membrane employing adaptor protein 2 (AP2) and ultimately merge into early endosomes.
  α-Granules mature in multivesicular bodies (MVBs), a process that requires proteins
  VPS33B, VPS16B, and NBEAL2. ( B) Dense (δ) granules are lysosomal-related organelles,
  which are derived from the endosomal compartment. The current understanding of biogenesis
  of dense granule is highly speculative and was extrapolated from the biogenesis
  of melanosomes. Early endosomes provide input for developing dense granules, which
  may mature in MVBs. In melanosomes, BLOC1 is required for the exit of tubular structures
  carrying cargo from the endosomes, which are directed to the developing melanosomes
  by BLOC2. Alternatively, cargoes can be directed to developing dense granules by
  an AP3-dependent pathway, which may or may not require BLOC2. BLOC, biogenesis of
  lysosome-related organelles complex.'
