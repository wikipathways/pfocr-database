caption: A revised model in mouse and human assumes preferential MK lineage commitment
  and differentiation through a pathway beginning from HSC and passing MK-P in the
  presence of TPO/Mpl signaling., In contrast, ME-Ps likely contribute to erythrocyte
  production. During megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis, TPO/Mpl signaling controls
  expression of the transcriptional factors Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1)
  and Kruppel-like factor 1 (KLF1), downstream of c-Mpl, which in turn regulates the
  individual blood cell types. On the other hand, a recent new mechanism of platelet
  release from MKs by IL-1α and TPO demonstrated that an excess of TPO during platelet
  biogenesis appears to inhibit platelet release.
