caption: Schematic diagram of polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) treatment in IL-1β-induced
  impairment of chondrogenic differentiation. PDRN protects against IL-1β-induced
  inflammation and promotes chondrogenic differentiation of hBMSCs by activating the
  cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway and inhibiting NF-κB activation. Binding of PDRN to the adenosine
  A2A purigenic receptor activates the downstream kinase cascade which ultimately
  results in CREB-mediated suppression of NF-kB. Inhibition of this pathway prevents
  suppression of growth factors necessary for chondrocyte development such as growth
  hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) as well as bone morphogenic
  protein 2 (BMP2) expression. Suppression of these factors normally leads to apoptosis
  and catabolism. Thus, PDRN action via the A2A receptor effectively prevents apoptosis
  and supports development and differentiation of hBMSCs
