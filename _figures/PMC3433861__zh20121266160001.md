caption: Summary of the biochemical pathways for parathyroid hormone (PTH)-, dopamine-,
  and FGF-23-mediated inhibition of phosphate transport in the renal proximal convoluted
  tubule. PTH interacts with the PTH1 receptor in renal proximal cells to activate
  PKC and PKA, resulting in the phosphorylation of sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory
  factor-1 (NHERF-1) and the dissociation of the proximal tubule sodium-dependent
  phosphate transporter (Npt2a) from NHERF-1. The unbound Npt2a transporter then interacts
  with other proteins that facilitate its endocytosis from the apical membrane, resulting
  in decreased phosphate transport. Dopamine interacts with renal D1-like receptors
  to activate the cAMP/PKA pathway, which, in turn, activates PKC. Like PTH, activated
  PKC phosphorylates NHERF-1 and dissociates Npt2a/NHERF-1 complexes, resulting in
  decreased phosphate transport. FGF-23 activates MAPK and phosphorylates NHERF-1.
  The site-specific phosphorylation of NHERF-1 by FGF-23, however, differs from that
  of PTH and dopamine ().
