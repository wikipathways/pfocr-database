caption: Functional Prediction of the Key Genes Involved in HBV Associated HCC. a
  Protein-Protein-Interaction (PPI) Network of the Key Genes Involved in HBV Associated
  HCC. GeneMANIA was applied to predict the function of key genes and construct the
  PPI network. The red rounds indicated key genes (query genes), and the khaki rounds
  indicated result genes. The different color lines between the rounds indicated distinct
  relationships between corresponding genes/proteins, such as co-expression, co-localization,
  physical interactions, predicted relations, shared protein domains, genetic interactions
  and pathway. b Visualization of the CELL CYCLE (hsa04110) KEGG pathway. The genes
  in the PPI network are highlighted in red. The different relations between proteins
  in the pathway are indicated in distinct types of lines. c The VIRAL CARCINOGENESIS
  pathways (hsa05203) related to the genes in PPI network. The genes in the PPI network
  are also highlighted in red
