caption: 'There is no available information regarding NaW signaling upstream of ERK1/2
  in muscle, except that again IR is not activated. The same scheme proposed for liver
  upstream of ERK1/2 (Scheme 1) was used as a reference. NaW induced-ERK1/2 activation
  led to phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC2, relieving inhibition on MTOR. Activated
  MTOR phosphorylates and activates S6K1, which inhibits eIF4E-BP1, alleviating eIF4E
  inhibition, and promoting protein translation. Moreover, ERK1/2 phosphorylates FOXO3
  and Mef2 transcription factors. Phosphorylated FOXO3 is inactive and cannot translocate
  into the nucleus to transactivate MurF1 and ATROGIN1 genes, down-regulating the
  expression of these important ubiquitin ligases, and reducing the activity of the
  ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of protein degradation. Besides, NaW induces a decline
  in auto-phagosome formation through the down-regulation of Bnip3. On the other hand,
  phosphorylated Mef2 is active and can enter the nucleus to promote Glut4 gene expression,
  which together with above-mentioned eIF4E stimulation led to enhanced protein synthesis
  of GLUT4 transporter. Finally, NaW-induced ERK1/2 activation stimulates fusion of
  GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane, maybe through direct activation
  of PLD, enhancing GLUT4 activity and glucose uptake. White letter: proteins are
  modified after NaW treatment; Black letter: proteins involved in the normal pathway,
  which are expected to be involved in NaW signaling, although it has not been determined;
  P: phosphorylation.'
