caption: Apoptosis pathways. The Intrinsic Pathway of apoptosis is activated when
  intracellular “stresses,” such as DNA or cytoskeleton damage or absence of growth/survival
  factors, are “perceived” by BH3-only members of the Bcl-2 family. These molecules
  become activated and migrate to the mitochondria where they facilitate or actively
  induce the release of apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c and SMAC/Diablo,
  to the cytosol. Cytochrome c associates with APAF-1 and pro-caspase-9 to form the
  apoptosome, resulting in the activation of caspase-9, which activates the effector
  caspases-3, -6, and -7, responsible for the biochemical and morphological modifications
  associated to apoptosis. SMAC/Diablo participates by preventing inhibition of caspases
  by IAPs. The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis initiates by the engagement of Death
  Receptor by their cognate Death Receptor Ligands causing the formation of the Death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC). DISC is formed by the intracellular portion of the Death
  Receptors, the adaptor proteins TRADD and/or FADD and the pro-caspase-8 (or pro-caspase-10).
  Activated caspase-8 may directly activate the effector caspases or process the BH3-only
  protein Bid. Truncated Bid migrates to mitochondria and activates the extrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis.
