caption: The role of PI3K/Akt in inflammation-induced tumor angiogenesis. Inflammation-induced
  cytokines and ROS activate PI3K/Akt signaling. Subsequently, PI3K/Akt increases
  the transcription of HIF-1 to promote VEGF expression by activating mTOR and p70S6K1.
  ENOS is a downstream effector element for PI3K/Akt, phosphorylated eNOS triggers
  the production of NO in endothelial cells. NO upregulates the expression of HIF-1
  and VEGF, and promotes further angiogenesis by elevating endothelial cell motility.
  TNF promotes the phosphorylation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member BAD by activating
  PI3K/Akt pathway, which leads to the failure of BAD to inhibit the activity of survival
  protein Bcl-2 or Bcl-xl.
