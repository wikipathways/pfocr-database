caption: Recently, additional classes of pro-resolution mediators derived from DHA
  have also been identified in resolving inflammatory exudates that display protective
  bioactivities, namely protectins and maresins (named for macrophage mediators in
  resolving inflammation) [,]. DHA-derived mediators are enzymatically generated via
  a LOX-initiated pathway [–]. At sites of inflammation, DHA is rapidly converted
  by LOX activity to 17S- hydroperoxy-DHA and via an epoxide containing intermediate
  to protectins, such as PD1 (10R,17S-dihydroxy-docosa-4Z,7Z,11E,13E,15Z,19Z-hexaenoic
  acid) [] (for detailed reviews, see refs [,]). DHA can be delivered during the early
  stages of an acute inflammatory response in albumin-rich edematous fluid []. It
  is noteworthy that the cellular components of the airway mucosa are enriched with
  DHA [] and both 17S-hydroxy-DHA and PD1 are generated in human airways []. Of interest,
  PD1 levels decrease during acute exacerbations of asthma and the bronchoprotective
  actions of PD1 have recently been demonstrated in a murine model of allergic asthma
  in vivo []. Using ovalbumin-sensitized mice, PD1 (2 – 200 ng) given by the intravenous
  route to sensitized mice prior to aeroallergen challenge markedly suppressed bronchial
  hyperresponsiveness, mucus secretion, pulmonary eosinophil accumulation and proinflammatory
  cytokine and lipid mediator release. PD1 also elicited a pro-resolving effect on
  established pulmonary inflammation when given after allergen challenge, leading
  to significantly expedited resolution of allergic airway inflammation []. The pro-resolving
  actions of maresins have recently been demonstrated during the resolution of murine
  peritonitis in vivo [] and have not yet been examined in the context of pulmonary
  inflammation. Thus, these findings are consistent with the ability of these ω-3
  PUFA-derived mediators to act as natural agonists for the resolution of pulmonary
  inflammation ().
