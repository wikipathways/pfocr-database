caption: 'Signaling pathways and receptors involved in uveal melanoma (UM) and cutaneous
  melanoma (CM). Three main signaling pathways affected in UM and/or CM patients are
  depicted. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with its Guanine nucleotide-binding
  proteins: the first is the Guanine nucleotide binding protein (GNAQ) and subunit
  alpha-11 (GNA11), which downstream activate Phospholipase C (PLC) and Protein Kinase
  C (PKC). The second is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway,
  consisting of BRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2. Finally, there is the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which
  can be influenced by both RAS (from the MAPK signaling pathway) and phosphatase
  and tensin homolog (PTEN). The previously described chemokine receptors and their
  influence on the signaling pathways are added: C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4),
  with its C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12), tyrosine-protein kinase Met (c-Met)
  and its ligand Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), and Insulin-like Growth Factor-1
  Receptor (IGF-1R), with Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1). In the nucleus, the
  ERK1/2 stimulates transcription factors, while both histone deacetylase (HDAC) and
  mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibit the formation of Reactive Oxygen
  Species (ROS). Figure was created with BioRender.com.'
