caption: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) produced in the paraventricular nucleus
  (PVN) is secreted from the median eminence (ME) and transported to the pituitary
  via the hypothalamus–hypophyseal portal system. TRH stimulates thyrotrophs to synthesize
  TSH in the pars distalis (PD) of the pituitary gland by upregulating mRNA levels
  of TSHA and TSHB. TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones (predominantly
  the prohormone T4) via the TSH receptor on the thyroid follicle cell membrane. TSH
  induces most of the essential events in thyroid hormone production. T3 derived from
  circulating T4 regulates synthesis and release of TRH and pars distalis TSH as part
  of a negative feedback loop mediated by the thyroid hormone receptor. This regulatory
  pathway is called the ‘hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis’,. PT, pars tuberalis;
  PN, pars intermediate; PI, pars nervosa.
