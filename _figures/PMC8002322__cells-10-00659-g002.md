caption: 'Targeted therapies directed at cell cycle and DNA damage repair pathways.
  Pro-growth stimuli promote the formation of the CDK4/6-cyclin D1 complex, which
  phosphorylates and inactivates the tumor suppressor Rb, and releases E2F. E2F then
  initiates a transcription program that supports G1-S phase transition. Genomic stress
  activates DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms, e.g., ATM/ATR, and PARP signaling
  pathways, and triggers the Chk1/2-p53-p21 axis to induce cell cycle arrest, senescence,
  or apoptosis as a means to halt the propagation of genetic lesions. Accumulation
  of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB) can be repaired by two mechanisms: (1) the error-free
  homologous recombination, HR; or (2) the error-prone non-homologous end-joining,
  NHEJ. FDA-approved PARP inhibitors, e.g., Olaparib, when used with standard treatments,
  can force HR repair-defective cells, such as in BRCA1 mutant cells, to activate
  the error-prone NHEJ pathway, leading to genomic instability beyond repair and causing
  cell death. BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1); RIF1 (Rap1-interacting
  factor 1 homolog); and 53BP1 (TP53-binding protein 1).'
