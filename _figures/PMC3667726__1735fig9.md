caption: Regulators of ATP7A trafficking. Schematic representation of the proposed
  trafficking routes taken by endogenous ATP7A, either constitutively (left) or induced
  by copper level changes (right). Routes are marked by arrows, and blocks imposed
  by RNAi, mutant constructs, or drug treatment are shown (see also ). Putative involvement
  of AP-2 in the constitutive pathway is shown as (?) (see the text). AP180-C shows
  a similar phenotype to clathrin knockdown and is not included in the scheme. Rab22aQ64L
  expression causes disruption of the TGN, which is not illustrated. Copper-induced
  forward pathway is shown as a direct trafficking step to the PM, although intermediary
  vesicles might be involved as in the constitutive route. V, vesicle.
