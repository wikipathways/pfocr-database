caption: Mechanisms of the circadian clock in cancer. The circadian clock plays an
  important role in tumorigenesis, tumor growth, metastasis, tumor immune escape,
  and other processes by regulating various biological functions, such as apoptosis
  and proliferation. Among them, many signaling pathways, such as the AMPK/mTOR pathway,
  Wnt/β-Catenin pathway, and NF-κ B pathway, as well as molecules, such as Hif-1α,
  P53, and PD-1 may play important roles.
