caption: Inflammatory cytokines intracellular pathways. (1) IL-4 and IL-13 induce
  arginase I expression via STAT6 activation and arginase I efficiently competes with
  iNOS for substrate l-arginine, causing a decreased output of NO in astrocytes and
  microglia. (2) High levels of IL-33 and other pro-inflammatory molecules may activate
  the NF-κB and MAPKs signaling pathways, which induces numerous pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, chemokines, and neurotoxic mediators, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ,
  TNF-α, CCL2, GMF, NO and ROS in astrocytes and microglia. (3) IL-33 binds to p65
  in the nucleus as a transcription factor, blocking the conjugation of p65 to the
  NF-κB transcription factor. It directly inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF-κB,
  which inhibits the NF-κB downstream pro-inflammatory signaling pathway and suppresses
  the inflammatory response. (4) These IL-33-induced inflammatory mediators act on
  neurons and modulate neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, apoptosis, and synaptic
  plasticity, ultimately, cognitive function
