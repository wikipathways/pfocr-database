caption: Proposed model for cytosolic–mitochondrial trafficking associated with astrocytic
  production of glutamine (pathway 1), its transfer to GABAergic neurons (without
  indication of any extracellular space, because astrocyte-to-neuron transfer is the
  only major function for extracellular glutamine), neuronal GABA formation via glutamate
  (without details), and extracellular release as transmitter GABA (pathway 2), with
  subsequent reuptake of GABA and oxidative metabolism in astrocytes (pathway 3),
  and connections between pathways 1 and 3 shown as pathway 4. Biosynthesis of glutamine
  is shown in brown and metabolic degradation of GABA in blue. GABA is suggested to
  enter the mitochondria in exchange with glutamate, although no such exchanger is
  presently known, and subsequently be transaminated to succinic-semialdehyde and
  oxidized to succinate. α-KG is initially used for the transamination, but later
  re-generated during metabolism of glutamate entering the mitochondria and metabolized
  as previously suggested for transmitter glutamate, with the mitochondrial malate
  extruder shown as a small purple oval. Redox shuttling and astrocytic release of
  glutamine and uptake of GABA are shown in black, and neuronal uptake of glutamine,
  followed by GABA formation and release in red. Reactions involving or resulting
  from transamination between aspartate and oxaloacetate (OAA) are shown in green.
  Note that (i) aralar activity is required not only for the initial production of
  each of two molecules of pyruvate (light blue oval in pathway 1), but also during
  the re-entry of glutamate into the TCA cycle and for the final entry of pyruvate
  into the mitochondria (light blue oval in pathway 3), (ii) all reactions are stoichiometrically
  accounted for, although only when GABA synthesis and oxidation are integrated. AGC1,
  aspartate/glutamate exchanger, aralar; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; Glc, glucose; Pyr,
  pyruvate; OGC, malate/α-ketoglutarate exchanger.
