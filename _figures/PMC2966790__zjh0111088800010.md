caption: Proposed scheme of the intracellular pathways involved in IL-1β–induced increase
  in intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ) permeability. IL-1β treatment resulted
  in activation of the MEKK-1 and NIK signaling cascades. MEKK-1 activation resulted
  in a step-wise activation of IKK and the canonical NF-κB pathway and activation
  of the MLCK gene, culminating in the opening of the TJ barrier.
