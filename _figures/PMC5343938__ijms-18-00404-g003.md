caption: Role of the RIG-1-like Receptors (RLRs) signaling pathway in antitumor immunity.
  Triggering of RLRs signaling by using oncolytic viruses or synthetic ligands in
  tumors cells can directly induce tumor cell death via interferon (IFN)-dependent
  or -independent manner. In addition, these agents are also sensed by host immune
  cells (primarily dendritic cells), resulting in activation of cluster of differentiation
  8+ (CD8+) T cells or natural killer (NK) cells, which exhibit an antitumor immune
  response. RLRs-mediated chemokines and cytokines production in the tumor site also
  contributes to recruitment of effector T cells. Tumor associated antigens from apoptotic
  tumor cells are presented to CD8+ T cell for producing tumor-antigen-specific cytotoxic
  CD8+ T cells.
