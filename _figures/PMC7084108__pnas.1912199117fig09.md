caption: Model of CUL3BPM-dependent regulation of MYCs. Activation of the COI1-dependent
  pathway by JA-Ile activates JA-dependent gene expression through the transcription
  factors MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4. JA-pathway activation stabilizes BPM3, likely by repressing
  a negative regulator of BPM3 stability, therefore activating a negative feedback
  regulatory loop to reduce MYC protein levels and their activity. BPMs are substrate
  adaptors of Cullin3-based E3 ubiquitin ligases that target MYC proteins for proteasome
  degradation in response to JA (i.e., CUL3BPM3) or other unknown signals (i.e., other
  CULBPMs).
