caption: Inhibitory receptors modulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to influence B cell
  fate decisions. Upon activation, B cells express several inhibitory or regulatory
  receptors, such as CD22, FcγRIIb, CD45, CD148, and FAS. These receptors are often
  associated with, or induce the activity of phosphatases like SHIP‐1, SHP‐1, SHP‐2,
  or PTEN, which counteract PI3K activity. A critical nodal point in this regulation
  is the mTORC1 inhibitor TSC complex (TSC1/TSC2), where multiple signaling pathways
  converge. Alternative activation can induce mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity, which are
  also subject to distinct regulatory mechanisms. Specific inhibitors can target different
  components of these signaling pathways, and those discussed in the text are indicated.
  Positive regulators are shown in red, negative regulators in blue, and pharmacological
  inhibitors in magenta. Phosphorylation of specific intermediates is highlighted
  in yellow. Arrows in the figure represent cross‐talk between different pathways,
  with a particular focus on the regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
