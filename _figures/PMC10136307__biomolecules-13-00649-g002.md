caption: 'Inhibition and induction of autophagy. (a) Nutrient availability: when nutrients
  are available, mTORC1 is activated and forms a complex accompanied by ULK1, Atg13,
  Atg101, and FIP200 (200 kDa FAK-family interacting protein) [23]. The developed
  complex inactivates ULK1 through its phosphorylation, which inhibits autophagy.
  (b) In starvation conditions, mTORC1 is inhibited by dissociation from the ULK1
  complex. Meanwhile, the ULK1 is dephosphorylated and activated by AMPK. The activated
  ULK1 induces autophagy by phosphorylation of Atg13 and FIP200. Then, the Beclin-1
  (Bcl-2-interacting protein) is released from Bcl-2 to form a complex with a set
  of proteins, including Vps34, Vps15, and Atg14L, resulting in autophagosome formation/maturation
  [23]. This process is accomplished via the Atg proteins in two ubiquitin-like conjugation
  pathways [24]. Finally, the lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) is localized to the autophagolysosome
  membrane [25]. LC3 interacts with p62 to engulf ubiquitinated proteins, and within
  the autophagolysosomes, the lysosomal hydrolases will then degrade the contents.'
