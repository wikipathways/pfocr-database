caption: Schematic overview of changes induced by hypersalinity in UWO 241. Under
  low salinity (right), linear electron transport is dominant, where the electrons
  are transported between PSII and PSI through electron spillover, cytochrome b6f
  (cyt b6f), and plastocyanin (PC). The electrons adopt a higher energy state during
  light excitation in PSI and are transferred to ferrodoxin (FR), which transports
  electrons to NADPH oxidase, fueling NADPH synthesis. Under hypersaline conditions
  (left), the proteins associate into the PSI supercomplex, which stimulates cyclic
  electron flow, transferring excited electrons from PSI back to cytochrome b6f. The
  sustained cyclic electron transport does not provide electrons for NADPH synthesis,
  which leads to an increase in ATP production that stimulates carbon metabolism,
  which in turn fuels the shikimate pathway and starch synthesis.
