caption: Escherichia coli mcc gene cluster and biosynthesis of microcin C. (A) The
  E. coli mcc biosynthetic gene cluster is schematically shown. Genes are shown by
  colored arrows and the functions of gene products are indicated below. Thin arrows
  indicate promoters from which transcription of mcc genes is initiated. A transcription
  terminator located between the mccA and mccB genes is shown as a hairpin. (B) The
  steps of the McC biosynthesis pathway and enzymes involved are presented. For the
  peptide part, the first 6 amino acids are shown as circles with their identity indicated
  in a single-letter amino acid code. The last amino acid is shown as a skeletal formula.
  The N-terminal methionine residue of mature McC is formylated.
