caption: The nuclear biogenesis (upper left) and cytoplasmic translation and decay
  (center) of normal cellular mRNAs are depicted. Degradation of these mRNAs is initiated
  by exonucleolytic shortening of the poly(A) tail, catalyzed by the Ccr4:Caf1 and
  Pan2:Pan3 complexes,,- (complexes not shown), or by endonucleolytic cleavage. Subsequent
  to poly(A) shortening, mRNAs are usually degraded by the decapping-dependent 5’
  to 3’ pathway or by the 3′ to 5′ exosome-dependent pathway. The latter pathways
  are also utilized to eliminate the 5’ and 3’ mRNA fragments resulting from endonucleolytic
  cleavage. Nonsense-containing mRNAs recruit the Upf factors (or the Upf and Smg
  factors) to the prematurely terminating ribosome, resulting in interactions that
  promote accelerated entry of the mRNA into the poly(A)-shortening or decapping pathways,
  or lead to endonucleolytic cleavage. Products of endonucleolytic are then degraded
  by the standard 5’ to 3’ and 3’ to 5’ pathways. Some steps of the 5’ to 3’ pathway,
  including translational repression, may take place in cytoplasmic P-bodies (GW-bodies
  in mammalian and Drosophila cells; not shown), sites where the Dcp1/Dcp2 decapping
  enzyme, the Xrn1 5’-3’ exonuclease, and the Pat1, Dhh1, and Lsm1–7 decapping activators
  can accumulate,. Evidence showing that decapped decay intermediates can be polyribosome-associated
  suggests that assembly of these structures is not essential for mRNA decay, at least
  in yeast. Moreover, in both yeast and metazoan cells, disruption of P bodies by
  depletion of core P body components failed to alter decay phenotypes for several
  different mRNAs,,.
