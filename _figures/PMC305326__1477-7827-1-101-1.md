caption: Model for the development, activation, and maintenance of the satellite cell.
  Upon skeletal muscle injury, quiescent satellite cells expressing Pax-7 and Foxk1
  are activated to proliferate, up-regulating the myogenic determination factors,
  MyoD and Myf-5 [-], the myoblast marker desmin [,], and Wnts 5a and 5b []. Satellite
  cell activation is regulated by the Notch signaling pathway [], and proliferation
  is stimulated by a number of growth factors, including basic FGF, insulin-like growth
  factor-1, and HGF/SF [,,]. Transition from proliferation to differentiation, which
  is accompanied by the down-regulation of Pax-7 [] and up-regulation of Myogenin
  and MRF-4 [,,], is dependent on both MyoD [] and the Foxk1 pathway [,]. Candidate
  satellite cell progenitors, which must activate Pax-7 for satellite cell development
  [], include embryonic myoblast precursors, fetal myoblasts, and vessel-associated
  mesoangioblasts, the latter of which exhibits strong myogenic potential [-]. Additionally,
  bone marrow-derived (BMD) stem cells can contribute directly to quiescent satellite
  cells and regenerating muscle fibers following injury [,,], and muscle SP cells
  have been used with some success in myoblast transplantation experiments into dystrophic
  muscle [,]. Importantly, members of the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins can
  convert SP cells favoring the hematopoietic fate into highly myogenic cells [].
