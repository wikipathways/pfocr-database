caption: Mechanisms associated with “lipid-inflammatory” interactions in atherosclerosis
  (AS)① Palmitic acid (PA) converts macrophages to the M1 type, which exacerbate the
  inflammatory response by upregulating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway; ② excess
  free cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) promote NF-κB-mediated inflammatory
  responses through the TLR4 pathway; ③ oxysterols and oleamide polarize macrophages
  toward the M1 type by activating HIF-1α or NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles in macrophages;
  ④ activation of PPARα and PPARγ attenuates free fatty acid (FFA) and TG accumulation
  in macrophages by inhibiting FATP1; ⑤ activation of PPARα and PPARγ attenuates FFA
  and TG accumulation in macrophages by inhibiting FATP1; ⑥ macrophages accelerate
  the conversion to foam cells by reducing the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression;
  ⑦ phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) improves AS plaque stability through PPARγ-mediated
  anti-inflammatory properties; ⑧ oleoyl ethanol amide (OEA) activates PPARα, which,
  inhibits ox-LDL production and reverses the inflammatory response; it promotes M2
  macrophage polarization via the AMPK-PPARα pathway
