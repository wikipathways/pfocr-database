caption: Pathway by which MSKE antagonizes Snail-mediated EMT in prostate cancer cells.
  Snail induces EMT via superoxide production which is characterized by decreased
  E-cadherin expression, increased vimentin expression and increased cell migration.
  MSKE antagonizes Snail-mediated EMT by inhibiting Snail expression possibly via
  inhibition of Stat-3 activity and superoxide production.
