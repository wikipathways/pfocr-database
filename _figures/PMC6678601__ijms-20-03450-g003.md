caption: A proposed model to explain the molecular mechanisms for phyA signaling under
  a light condition. PrA, the Pr form of phyA; PfrA, the Pfr form of phyA; 26S, the
  26S proteasome complex; P, phosphate; PK, unknown protein kinase(s). As a protein
  kinase, PfrA is autophosphorylated (AutoP) and phosphorylates substrate proteins
  such as PIF3. So far, PIF3 is also known to be phosphorylated by PPKs and BIN2,
  and COP1 is phosphorylated by PID. However, the protein kinase(s) that can phosphorylate
  phytochromes are unknown (labeled as “PK?”). In addition, it is not known how FHY1
  and FHL can be phosphorylated (i.e., another label with “PK?”). Moreover, it is
  possible that PIF3 and COP1 might be phosphorylated further by unknown protein kinase(s).
  As shown in this model, phosphorylation (shown as red arrows) takes significant
  portions in the phytochrome signaling in plants. In summary, the function of phytochromes
  is to inactivate the negative regulators for photomorphogenesis such as PIF3 and
  COP1-SPA1 complex, which eventually express and stabilize HY5 to initiate photomorphogenic
  development. At the same time, phosphorylated PfrP is rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin
  26S proteasome pathway (shown as green arrows) for an efficient desensitization
  of the phyA signal, which is necessary for responses to subsequent changes in fluctuating
  light environments.
