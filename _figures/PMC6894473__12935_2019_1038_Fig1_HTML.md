caption: Schematic view of the Wnt signaling pathways between MSCs and HCC cells in
  inflammation microenvironment. Wnt is one of the signaling pathways that act in
  HCC for survival, tumor growth and overexpression of TERT and EpCAM. Wnt ligands
  activate this pathway by binding to the frizzled receptors and LRP5/6. Otherwise,
  Soluble Wnt antagonists including sFRP, Dkk-1, and Wif-1 modulated Initiation of
  Wnt signaling. MSCs had an inhibitory effect on the tumor cells proliferation through
  secreting these antagonists and TNF-α/β, IL-1α/β, and IL-6 for increasing of these
  inhibitory factors. Tumor cells can inhibit the production of PDGF-BB and IL-1β
  by MSCs, which in turn reduces angiogenesis
