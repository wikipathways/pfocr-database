caption: Cell-specific genetic rescue of a behavioral response to pharmacological
  treatment or environmental stimuli produces models linking genes, GO molecular functions,
  GO biological processes, and cells in the C. elegans Gross Anatomy Ontology. A)
  Carnell et al. (2005) (Table 4D, this manuscript) found that VM-specific expression
  of ser-1 could rescue serotonin-dependent egg-laying behavior, suggesting that ser-1
  is required in VM neurons to induce egg-laying in response to serotonin. The G-protein
  coupled serotonin receptor activity is part of the positive regulation of egg deposition,
  because the part of relation is transitive (i.e. there is no need for an additional
  part of relation connecting these nodes). B) Carillo et al. (2013) (Table 4E, this
  manuscript) found that npr-1 expression in neuronal subsets that include URX is
  sufficient to rescue the behavioral response to carbon dioxide. The activity of
  some CO2 receptor is implied, leading to the addition of a placeholder term without
  an enabling gene, indicating an important piece of missing information. This activity
  can be included in the CO2 sensing circuit by asserting that it is part of the positive
  regulation of chemotaxis, along with the npr-1-dependent signaling pathway. C) AFD
  neuron responds to CO2 removal (Bretscher et al. 2011) (Table 4F, this manuscript).
  Currently, there are no terms within appropriate ontologies to describe temporal
  features of chemical or physical inputs (e.g. ‘decreasing’). The required definitions
  are suggested in this paper.
