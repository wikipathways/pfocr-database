caption: Overviews of the protocol and experimental design of the study performed.
  (a) Schematic diagram of the riboPLATE-seq protocol, from lysis in a multi-well
  plate to pooled library preparation. The right-hand side mirrors the original PLATE-seq
  protocol. In this workflow, an oligo(dT)-grafted plate captures polyadenylated RNA
  that can be reverse-transcribed with barcoded adapters, generating a plate of cDNA
  that may be pooled for library construction. The left side incorporates a pan-ribosome
  IP before PLATE-seq pooling and library preparation, generating instead a pooled
  library of ribosome-associated RNA. (b) Simplified structure of the signaling pathways
  under study and the specific protein targets considered. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  axis at left converges with the MAPK/ERK pathway at right on eIF4E, early in the
  process of ribosome assembly (green box). The figure also outlines the inhibitors
  used in this study and their specific targets within these pathways. NVP-BKM120
  is a PI3K inhibitor (orange), both AZD8055 and PP242 are mTOR inhibitors (blue and
  purple, respectively), MNK-i1 is a MNK1 inhibitor (green), and 4EGi-1 is a direct
  eIF4E inhibitor (black).
