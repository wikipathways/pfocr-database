caption: Schematic diagram of WATME-specific immunotherapy for obesity-induced coronary
  heart disease (CHD). Obesity is associated with increased secretion of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, especially IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, by obese WATME. There is established
  evidence linking these cytokines to the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Several WATME-specific
  immunotherapies have been identified for the treatment of atherosclerosis-mediated
  development of obesity-induced CHD. These WATME-specific immunotherapies target
  the NLRP3 inflammasome, TNF-α, and inflammatory signaling pathways. Some examples
  are Bazedoxifene and Etanercept
