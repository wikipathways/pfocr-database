caption: 'Lipogenesis in luminal and basal-like breast cancer cells. In luminal breast
  cancer cells, glucose-derived acetyl-CoA is the main source of citrate for the cytosolic
  synthesis of lipids. In basal-like, pyruvate is mainly converted into lactate in
  the cytosol, and other substrates such as glutamine and acetate are used to support
  cell lipid synthesis. Additionally, basal-like breast cancer cells increase free
  fatty acid entry in the cell to fulfill the β-oxidation pathway. Solid arrows signify
  the main reaction processes and dotted arrows signify processes with a minor relevance.
  Abbreviations: FFA, free (non-esterified) fatty acid; OAA, oxaloacetate; αKG, α-ketoglutarate;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
