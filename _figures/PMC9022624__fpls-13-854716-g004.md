  WH, white-heart Chinese fir; RH, red-heart Chinese fir; DK, dihydrokaempferol; Ka,
  kaempferol; Glu, glucoside; Rham, rhamnose; Rob, robinoside; PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone
  synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FLS, Flavonol synthase;
  F3′H, flavanone 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavanone 3′-5′-hydroxylase. Each colored
  cell represents the normalized intensity of each compound ion according to the color
  scale (three biological replicates × two cultivars, n = 6). Column plots are shown
  for changes of flavonoids and their glycosylations in white-heart and red-heart
  Chinese fir. The empty column represents the WH-TZ vs. RH-TZ; the wave column represents
  the WH-OHW vs. RH-OHW; and the reticulate column represents the WH-ISW vs. RH-ISW.
