caption: TMB-directed immunotherapy approaches at the Champalimaud Centre for the
  Unknown. The schematic shows strategies aimed at therapeutic targeting of private
  (personalized and patient-specific) and shared (often driver) mutations. For personalized
  therapy, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from TIL or peripheral blood expressing a highly
  diverse TCR αβ repertoire recognizing a private neoepitopes can be procured. HLA-matched,
  healthy donor-derived TCRs have also been shown to recognize patient-specific neoepitopes
  (). Personalized cancer vaccines, comprising private neoepitopes as a peptide formulation
  or as RNA constructs, promote durable immune responses in patients with advanced
  cancer. Autologous B-cells can be used as a source of APCs as well as cytokine producers,
  in addition to their differentiation into plasma cells to secrete tumor antigen-specific
  antibodies in vivo. Approaches targeting shared mutations serve as excellent ‘off-the-shelf’
  options which can be used for larger groups of patients simultaneously. Cancer vaccines
  based on shared mutations are also clinically important, provided the patients’
  HLA profiles are matched to the epitope binding characteristics. Antibodies derived
  from tumor-infiltrating B-cells or from peripheral blood B-cells targeting surface-bound
  shared neoantigens may mediating cellular cytotoxicity and aid in the development
  of CAR T-cells. Gene therapy to correct shared driver mutations may promote tumor
  susceptibility to immune attack. Immune checkpoint blockade has been placed between
  the two domains as its clinical activity targets both private and shared mutated
  targets. Similarly, NK, TCR γδ T-cells and possibly NKT T-cells or MAIT-cells may
  be instrumental in patients presenting with private and/or shared HLA pathway mutations
  and can be derived from allogeneic sources for treatment.
