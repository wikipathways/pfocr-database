caption: Cardiomyocyte fructose metabolism. Fructose is phosphorylated by fructokinase
  (FK) to fructose 1-phosphate (F1P), and metabolized to triose phosphates, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde (GA). The polyol pathway (black) converts glucose
  to sorbitol via aldose reductase (AR), and sorbitol to glucose via sorbitol dehydrogenase
  (SDH). DHAP and GA are converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates (GA3P) and provide
  substrates for glycolysis to produce acetyl-CoA to enter the mitochondrial TCA cycle.
  DHAP and TCA cycle-derived citrate contribute to lipid biosynthesis. HKII, hexokinase
  2; PFK, phosphofructokinase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid. Created using biorender.com.
