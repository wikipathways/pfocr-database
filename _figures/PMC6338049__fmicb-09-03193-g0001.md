caption: Schematic model of chimeric DNA synthesis and the interactions between DCR-HEL
  (RT-HEL), reverse-transcriptase (RT), retrotransposon DNA and viral dsRNA. Uptake
  of viral genomic RNA and synthesis of double-stranded replicative form RNA in cell
  cytoplasm stimulates chimeric circular and linear DNA production which allows increased
  de novo synthesis of virus-specific small RNAs and efficient antiviral RNAi response.
  Right part of the figure shows the hypothetical pathway specific for Lepidoptera
  insect species. DCR-HEL is shown in green; RT-HEL is shown in gray. Retrotransposon-specific
  RNA, DNA, and RNAi are shown in red; virus-specific RNA, DNA, and RNAi are shown
  in blue. DNA-specific steps are shown in pinkish areas; RNA-specific steps are shown
  in bluish areas.
