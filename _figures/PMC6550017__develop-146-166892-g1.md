caption: Overview of HH signaling. (A) HH signaling regulates a bi-functional transcription
  factor that can repress (GLI-R) or activate (GLI-A) the transcription of target
  genes. HH ligands bind and inhibit the function of their receptor PTCH, allowing
  SMO to adopt an active conformation. SMO transmits the HH signal across the membrane
  and antagonizes the function of two negative regulators, SUFU and PKA, which promote
  GLI-R formation. Consequently, full-length GLI proteins (GLI-FL) are converted to
  GLI-A. (B) All HH ligands are modified with a cholesteroyl group at their C termini,
  attached through an auto-proteolytic reaction catalyzed by the C-terminal domain,
  and a palmitoyl group at their N termini, attached by a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase.
  (C) Vertebrate HH signaling is associated with protein trafficking events at primary
  cilia. When the HH pathway is ‘off’ (left), PTCH is enriched in cilia and inhibits
  SMO. PKA and SUFU restrain GLI activity and promote its proteolysis into GLI-R.
  HH signaling is turned on in target cells (right) when HH ligands inhibit PTCH and
  induce its clearance from primary cilia. As a result, SMO is activated and accumulates
  in cilia in association with a scaffolding complex, the Ellis van Creveld (EvC)
  complex. Activated SMO antagonizes the inhibitory effect of PKA on the GLI proteins,
  leading to the dissociation of SUFU. Now, instead of being converted into GLI-R,
  GLI-FL can enter the nucleus and activate target gene transcription (GLI-A). The
  transition zone at the cilia base regulates receptor access to cilia, cilia tips
  form a compartment (marked by the kinesin KIF7) that regulates the GLI proteins,
  and the EvC complex scaffolds SMO signaling near the cilia base ().
