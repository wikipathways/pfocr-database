caption: 'A Ca2+-permeable MS channel (e.g. Piezo1, TRPV2, TRPV4) acts as the mechanotransducer
  providing local Ca2+ that in turn stimulates TRPM4. The Na+-permeable TRPM4 activity
  then could either stimulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels through membrane depolarisation
  or induce reverse activity of the Na+/ Ca2+exchanger through local Na+ loading.
  Either of these outcomes would lead to a high-amplitude increase in local Ca2+.
  Calmodulin then responds to this high-amplitude Ca2+ stimulus through the lower
  affinity Ca2+ binding site at its N-lobe which subsequently activates CaMKIIδ and
  thus stimulates the CaMKII-HDAC4-MEF2 pathway as shown in . Calcineurin activation
  is inhibited by the activated CaMKIIδ and is activated preferentially by low-amplitude
  Ca2+signalling via Gq-coupled receptors and calmodulin (see Discussion). ECM: extracellular
  matrix, MS: mechanosensitive, Cav: voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, ΔVm: membrane depolarisation,
  CaM: calmodulin.'
