caption: Calcium-activated signaling pathways that regulate gene transcription.  In
  neurons, neurotransmitter reception and membrane depolarization lead  to the opening
  of ligand- and voltage-gated calcium channels.  Subsequent calcium influx across
  the plasma membrane drives the  activation of a number of signaling molecules, including
  the  calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclase,  calcium/calmodulin-activated kinases,
  and Ras. Each of  these molecules activates a cascade of signaling proteins that  amplifies
  the calcium signal and carries it to the nucleus. Dashed  lines represent the components
  of each pathway that are proposed to  translocate into the nucleus. Nuclear kinases
  including protein kinase  A, CaMK-IV, and members of the Rsk family phosphorylate
  CREB at  Ser-133, rendering it competent to mediate transcription of genes such  as
  BDNF. [Reproduced with permission from ref.   (Copyright 1999, Annual Reviews, http://AnnualReviews.org).]
