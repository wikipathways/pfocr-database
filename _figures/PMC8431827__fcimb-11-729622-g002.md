caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis reveals interaction between bioactive components
  in spices and inflammation of the airway. Two possible mechanisms depicted through
  which active components from commonly used spices could help mitigate airway inflammation
  in COVID-19. One pathway involves inhibiting major pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukins (CXCL8 (IL8),
  IL6, IL10), and chemokine CCL2; blocking inflammatory signal onset by inhibiting
  TLR (toll-like receptors) or inhibiting ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule
  1) dependent migration of immune cells to the site of inflammation. Another way
  bioactive components could maintain inflammatory homeostasis is by targeting the
  oxidative stress pathway via activation of NFE2L2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2; Nrf2) and HMOX1(heme oxygenase 1). Synergistic effects of spices could
  also be evaluated, for example, between piperine and curcumin in attenuation of
  COVID-19 linked hyperinflammatory response. The name of major spice source(s) for
  the bioactive components are mentioned in boxes (pink). Interactive network constructed
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen Inc., Germantown, MD). Arrow-head
  indicates activation; bar-head indicates inhibition. Prediction legend indicates
  the relationship between molecules.
