  is the key signal transducer of the Hh pathway. In the absence of the Hh ligands,
  Hh receptor patched (PTC) is thought to be localized in the cilium to inhibit SMO
  signaling. Coreceptors of Hh include CDO (cell adhesion molecule-related/down regulated
  by oncogenes), brother of CDO (BOC), Gas1, glypican 3, (GPC3), and GPC5. Wnt inhibitory
  factor-1 (WIF1) can also regulate Hh signaling through association with CDO, BOC,
  or GPC5. Gli molecules are processed with the help of suppressor of fused (SuFu)/KIF7,
  β-TRCP molecules into repressor forms, which turn off the Hh signaling pathway.
  Other negative regulators of Gli molecules include Rab23, protein kinase A (PKA),
  SuFu, tumor suppressor sucrose nonfermenting 5 (SNF5), Culin 3 (Cul3), and itchy
  E3 ubiquitin ligase (Itch) through regulation Gli protein modifications, nuclear–cytoplasm
  shuttling, as well as transcriptional activities. In the presence of Hh, PTC is
  thought to be shuttled out of cilium and is unable to inhibit SMO. The ciliary localization
  of SMO is thought to require β-arrestin 2 (βArr2), and G protein coupled receptor
  kinase 2 (GRK2). Hh reception promotes SMO conformational changes to form dimers.
  Gli molecules are now processed to active forms (GliA), which will activate the
  Hh target genes. This process can be inhibited by KIF7 and SuFu. Protein kinase
  C isoform ι/λ0 (PKCι/λ) is known to positively regulate Gli transcriptional activity.
  Positive regulators are in red, negative regulators are in blue, and target genes
  are in pink. KIF7 can function (in black) as a negative regulator or a positive
  regulator. The interacting pathways with the Hh pathway are in green. Although the
  role of cilium for Hh signaling during embryonic development is well established,
  cancer cells generally lack cilia. It has been demonstrated that lack of cilia prevents
  development of basal cell carcinomas in mice. It is not clear whether this is true
  for all other types of Hh signaling-associated cancer.Abbreviations: EGF, epidermal
