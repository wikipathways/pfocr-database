caption: One-carbon metabolism, transmethylation reactions, folate cycle, and DNA
  demethylation. DNA methylation on specific cytosine moieties is catalyzed by DNA-methyltransferases
  (DNMTs). This reaction is dependent on the levels of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM),
  which is synthesized in the brain by the methionineadenosyl-transferase (MAT) 2.
  After the DNA methyl transfer reaction, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is formed as
  a by-product. SAH exerts a feedback inhibitory activity on DNMTs and is used as
  a substrate for the adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) leading to the synthesis
  of homocysteine. The remethylation of homocysteine to form methionine is catalyzed
  via the folate cycle, that is, the conversion of folic acid into tetrahydrofolate
  (THF) and 5,10-methylenete-trahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF). The methylene tetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR) will produce 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) that is used as
  a substrate by methionine synthase (MTR) to form methionine. The synthesis of methionine
  may also involve the activation of the betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT)
  pathway. DNA demethylation is initiated by ten-eleven-translocase (TET) enzymes
  that hydroxylate 5-methylcytosine (5mC) forming 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC).
  In the end, through a GADD45B coordinated process, 5hmC is first converted to 5-formylcytosine
  (5fC) and then to 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) by TET-mediated iterative processing.
  Thymidine deglycosylase (TDG) and members of the base excision repair (BER) pathway
  remove the modified residue, substituting it with cytosine. Stressful stimuli are
  known to activate neuronal pathways triggering DNA methylation or hydroxymethylation
  and demethylation, altering gene expression. Plus signs indicate positive regulation.
