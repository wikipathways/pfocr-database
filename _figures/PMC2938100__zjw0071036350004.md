caption: Connections of literature-completed interactome of PI3K-mTOR pathway with
  other signaling pathways. PI3K-mTOR pathway components as depicted as triangles,
  and interactors are depicted as circles. Pink links represent interactions found
  in this study, and gray links are manually curated interactions from the literature.
  The molecular function of each protein is described by a color code, and interactors
  are grouped according to their belonging to specific signaling pathways. GAP, GTPase-activating
  protein; TGF, transforming growth factor; PKC, protein kinase C; MAP, mitogen-activated
  protein; NFKB, nuclear factor κB; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and
  activator of transcription; CaM, calmodulin.
