caption: TEI is a 3-step process. We propose that stable heritable silencing requires
  3 phases, each with distinct genetic requirements. In response to RNAi, silencing
  is initiated in the exposed P0 generation by canonical RNAi pathway genes. In most
  cases, offspring do not inherit gene silencing, but occasionally an unknown trigger
  results in the establishment of a heritable silencing signal by the putative histone
  methyltransferases SET-25 and SET-32 in the germline of the P0 individuals. Silencing
  is then maintained transgenerationally in subsequent generations by small-RNA-associated
  genes, including HRDE-1 and NRDE-2. The heritable signal passed between generations
  remains to be elucidated.HRDE-1, heritable RNAi defective-1; NRDE-2, nuclear RNAi
  defective-2; RNAi, RNA interference; TEI, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.
