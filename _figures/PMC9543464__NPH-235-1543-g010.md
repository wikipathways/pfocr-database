caption: 'A schematic representation of the chloroplast MEP pathway involved in Bamboo
  mosaic virus (BaMV) accumulation. The product IPP of the MEP pathway was converted
  to GGPP by GGPPS2 and then via the gibberellic acid (GA) synthesis pathway to synthesize
  GA. GA could upregulate GA‐response genes that might include BaMV accumulation‐assistance
  factors, such as CA and FNR. The arrows are the metabolic steps in the MEP pathway
