caption: 'Schematic and mathematical representations of the main model assumptions.
  (A) Schematic and mathematical representations of auxin transport between cells
  (i, j) and cell wall interfaces (ij, ji, ik, and il). IAAi describes the mean auxin
  concentration in the ith cell; whereas IAAij and IAAji determine the auxin concentrations
  in discrete wall compartments (ij and ji). The functions fin+/fin− and fout+/fout−
  are used to evaluate the fractions of auxin in the cell and in the cell wall. Dashed
  arrows indicate the rate of passive auxin diffusion into the cell and pIAAH describes
  the membrane permeablility for protonated auxin. Da is the diffusion coefficient
  of auxin between neighboring wall compartments. pPIN and pAUX are parameters that
  determine PIN- and AUX/LAX-dependent efflux and influx of auxin across the plasma
  membrane, respectively. PINij/PINji and AUXij/AUXji are PIN (red) and AUX/LAX (blue)
  levels, respectively, in neighboring plasma membranes. (B) Schematic and mathematical
  representations of intracellular auxin perception: auxin-induced carrier synthesis
  (solid black arrows) and basic carrier degradation (dashed black arrows). The αPIN
  and αAUX are the rates of auxin-dependent PIN and AUX/LAX expression, respectively.
  The degradation rates of PIN and AUX/LAX proteins are given by parameters δPIN and
  δAUX. (C) Schematic and mathematical representations of auxin carrier trafficking.
  The rates of endo- and exocytosis affect carrier abundance at the plasma membrane.
  PINi corresponds to the PIN level at the plasma membrane of the ith cell (red arrows)
  and AUXi determines the AUX/LAX level (blue arrows) in the ith cells. The base rates
  for PIN exocytosis and PIN endocytosis are kexo and kendo, whereas aexo and aendo
  similarly correspond to AUX/LAX recycling rates. The component khij determines the
  inhibitory effect of auxin on the PIN internalization at a given cell side. (D)
  Schematic and mathematical representations of extracellular receptor-based auxin
  signaling pathway for modulation of PIN trafficking. Two adjacent cells share a
  common pool of extracellular auxin receptors denoted as 2RT=Cij+Cji+Rij+Rji, where
  Cij and Cji represent the levels of the auxin-bound receptor in the discrete wall
  compartments facing the surfaces of the adjacent cells i and j. Rij and Rji correspond
  to the levels of free receptors that undergo diffusion between common wall compartments
  (DR). The auxin receptors are activated by auxin via direct binding at the cell
  surface and transfer an inhibitory signal to regulate PIN internalization rates
  (khij and khji) that is linked with their temporal immobilization at a given side
  of the cells (DC∼0). The green bars represent auxin concentrations in the discrete
  cell wall compartments.'
