caption: (A) Activation of T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signaling induction of costimulatory
  and cytokine receptor-mediated signaling takes place. Activation of these signaling
  pathways results in the downstream activation of mTOR and C-Myc and the reprogramming
  of activated T-cell metabolism. (B) Metabolite produced inside the cell regulates
  the signaling pathway of activated T cells. Afterward, the activation-activated
  T cells increase the uptake of glucose and amino acids, which results in a significant
  increase in the metabolite concern with these biomolecules. This increased level
  of metabolites influences the signaling pathways (TCR mediated, costimulatory, cytokine
  mediated) of activated T cells, which further alter the metabolism of activated
  T cells.

    of these signaling pathways results in the downstream activation of mTOR and C-Myc
