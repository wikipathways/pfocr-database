caption: This schematic diagram illustrates key steps in the signaling pathway linking
  a high fat diet with increased lipogenesis. According to this model, high fat triggers
  lipogenesis by activating IDH1 though SREBF, ACLY, and FASN pathways. Liver-specific
  miR-181c can directly bind to the 3′-UTR of IDH 1 mRNA and mitigate lipogenesis.
