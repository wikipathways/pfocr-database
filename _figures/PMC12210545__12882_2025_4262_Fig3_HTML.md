caption: 'The complement system and the role of HCQ. The complement cascade can be
  activated via three distinct pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway,
  and the alternative pathway. The activation of C3 represents the pivotal step in
  complement activation. In the lectin pathway, the production of acute-phase proteins,
  such as MBL, bind to microbes, activating MASPs to form C4b2a (a C3 convertase).
  Conversely, the alternative pathway undergoes continuous low-level self-activation.
  In the presence of factors B and D, this process leads to the generation of C3b.
  All three pathways culminate in the formation of C5 convertase (C3bBb3b and C4b2a3b),
  which cleaves C5. This cleavage releases C5b and the potent anaphylatoxin C5a. C5adesArg
  is a derivative of C5a. Additionally, C5b initiates the sequential assembly of the
  lytic membrane attack complex (C5b-9), inducing cell and tissue damage and promoting
  inflammation. HCQ inhibits both MBL-dependent activation and the alternative pathway.
