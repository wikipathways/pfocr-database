caption: 'Expression of  pathway genes during fruit ripening in A. arguta (black bars,
  ripening stages a0, a3, and a5; see text) and A. chinensis (gray bars, ripening
  stages c0, c2, and c4; see text). Real-time  analyses were performed on pooled fruit
  samples using the gene-specific primers given in Supplemental Table S2. Error bars
  are based on four technical replicates, and data were normalized against the housekeeping
  gene EF1α. Error bars represent ±se.  pathway intermediate abbreviations are: CDP-ME,

  2-phosphate; DXP, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; HBMPP,
