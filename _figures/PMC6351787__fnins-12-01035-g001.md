caption: Four intracellular destinations of glucose that suggest an intersection in
  “X.” Glucose enters astrocytes mainly via GLUT1, and neurons mainly via GLUT3 and
  is trapped by phosphorylation (catalyzed by hexokinase 1, HK1). Afterward, four
  destinations are possible; these form a crossroads in the shape of an X, where glycogen
  synthesis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) are the left and right arms of
  the X, and glycolysis (until pyruvate) and the hexosamine pathway (HP) are the left
  and right legs of the X. The deviation of glycolysis that generates methylglyoxal
  (MG) is also indicated. PFK-1, phosphofructokinase-1; G-3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
