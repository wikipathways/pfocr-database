caption: 'Model of the regulation of the cGMP pathway. (A) cGMP signaling pathway.
  Activation of cGC by cAMP in starved cells requires Gα2 and RasC/G, and activation
  by folate in vegetative cells requires Gα4 and RasC/G. The produced cGMP activates
  the cGMP-binding protein GbpC that induces myosin filament formation in the rear
  of the cell. The activity of sGC is regulated by multiple processes: inhibition
  by cAMP-stimulated and cGMP-potentiated Ca2+ increase, inhibition by parallel F-actin
  in the cortex, stimulation by branched F-actin in pseudopods and cGMP is degraded
  by a cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase. (B) Localization of sGC. Confocal images
  reveal that sGC-GFP is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. sGC-GFP is enriched
  in pseudopods and at the cell boundary of the cell that is composed of the plasma
  membrane and the F-actin cortex. cGMP and guanylyl cyclase assays reveal that sGC
  in the cytoplasm is in equilibrium with association to branched F-actin in pseudopods
  and with association to the plasma membrane. sGC can also bind to parallel F-actin
  in the cortex that is formed upon cAMP stimulation. sGC associated to branched F-actin
  in pseudopods has increased activity. sGC associated to the membrane can be activated
  by Ras/Gα2; Ca2+ ions induce the dissociation of sGC from the membrane and thereby
  its inhibition. sGC associated to parallel F-actin in the cortex has reduced activity.'
