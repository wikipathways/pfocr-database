caption: The omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which humans mostly attain
  from dietary fish, can affect synaptic function and cognitive abilities by providing
  plasma membrane fluidity at synaptic regions. DHA constitutes more than 30% of the
  total phospholipid composition of plasma membranes in the brain, and thus it is
  crucial for maintaining membrane integrity and, consequently, neuronal excitability
  and synaptic function. Dietary DHA is indispensable for maintaining membrane ionic
  permeability and the function of transmembrane receptors that support synaptic transmission
  and cognitive abilities. Omega-3 fatty acids also activate energy-generating metabolic
  pathways that subsequently affect molecules such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). IGF1 can be produced in the liver
  and in skeletal muscle, as well as in the brain, and so it can convey peripheral
  messages to the brain in the context of diet and exercise. BDNF and IGF1 acting
  at presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors can activate signalling systems, such
  as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II (CaMKII) systems, which facilitate synaptic transmission and support
  long-term potentiation that is associated with learning and memory. BDNF has also
  been shown to be involved in modulating synaptic plasticity and cognitive function
  through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) signalling pathway. The activities of the mTOR and Akt signalling pathways
  are also modulated by metabolic signals such as insulin and leptin (not shown).
