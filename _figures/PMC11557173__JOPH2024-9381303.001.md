caption: 'Rho kinase signaling pathway and its effect. The engagement of G protein-coupled
  receptors, as well as receptors for cytokines or other growth factors, initiates
  the activation of RhoGEF, which subsequently phosphorylates RhoA or ROCK 1/2. Predominantly,
  ROCK triggers two downstream pathways: firstly, the myosin light chain phosphatase
  (MLCP)/myosin light chain (MLC), and secondly, LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3)/cofilin.
  Nevertheless, all these pathways harmonize in the regulation of various cellular
  functions including alterations in cell morphology, promotion of cell proliferation,
  transformation of myocytes into myofibroblasts leading to fibrosis, formation of
  stress fibers, and modulation of cell motility and adhesion. ROCK, Rho kinase; Ca-Cam,
  Ca2+/calmodulin; MLC, myosin light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; P-MLC,
