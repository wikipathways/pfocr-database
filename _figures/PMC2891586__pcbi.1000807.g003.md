caption: 'Comparison between a known pathway (NOTCH signaling pathway, taken from
  the KEGG database, ID: hsa04330) and the corresponding interactome network build
  using the proteins that interact with human NOTCH proteins. The top panel (A) shows
  the pathway including nine proteins (green boxes) directly connected to NOTCH. In
  this pathway, the central element is the NOTCH receptor and the interaction of its
  intracellular domain (called NICD) with protein RBPJ. The bottom panel (B) shows
  the NOTCH PPI network (built with Cytoscape and APID2NET), including all interactors
  proven with at least two different experiments. The number of experiments is indicated
  next to each link (blue line). The PPI network provides complementry information
  to the KEGG pathway, revealing the particular links of each of the four NOTCH paralogous
  proteins (NOTCH1, 2, 3, and 4) present in the human proteome. The biomolecular elements
  included in both networks are quite similar and the information that can be deduced
  from them is complementary. This can be seen in the interaction between NOTCH and
  RBPJ that drives the central signaling of the pathway and it is present in both
  networks.'
