caption: Comparison of mGluR-related signaling pathways activation in successful cognitive
  aging, Fragile X syndrome, and Alzheimer’s disease. Activation of group 1 mGluR
  mediates Ca+2 release from intracellular stores and protein translation through
  the activation of several kinases including ERK and mTOR. Once translated, FMRP
  proteins act as a negative regulator of protein synthesis and reduce LTD-related
  proteins levels and IEG expression. A good balance of these mechanisms leads to
  memory formation in the aged brain. Excessive mGluR-LTD has been linked to the Fragile
  X syndrome. While ERK activation is enhanced, protein synthesis related to the mTOR
  pathway is lost. Moreover, mGluR5 is associated more with Homer 1a stimulating agonist-independent
  signaling pathways. Without FMRP to decrease the protein translation, LTD-related
  proteins are overexpressed and memory is impaired. Excessive mGluR-LTD has also
  been reported in Alzheimer’s disease. Aβ oligomers clusters mGluRs on the plasma
  membrane promoting Ca2+signaling and release from intracellular stores. Stimulation
  of group 1 mGluR also increases APP translation. FMRP can bind to APP possibly altering
  the protein synthesis negative control and creating memory deficits.
