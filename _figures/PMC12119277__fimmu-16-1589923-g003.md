caption: 'Mechanisms by which mediators of inflammation resolution regulate neutrophil
  apoptosis and survival. The image is divided into two regions: the left side (pink
  area) represents the pathway of inflammation resolution, while the right side (blue
  area) represents the pathways of cell survival and inflammation prolongation. The
  blue module depicts pro-survival mechanisms, including BCL-2 family anti-apoptotic
  proteins, survival signaling pathways (AKT, ERK, NF-κB), and the inflammation-prolonging
  states they mediate. The red module illustrates pro-apoptotic mechanisms, encompassing
  caspase cascade activation and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways. The interactions
  between various receptors and signaling molecules collectively determine the ultimate
  cell fate and the progression of inflammation. PD1, Protectin D1; GPR37, G Protein-Coupled
  Receptor 37; ANXA1 - Annexin A1; ROS, Reactive Oxygen Species; ΔΨm, mitochondrial
  membrane potential: APAF1, Apoptotic Protease Activating Factor 1; MPO, Myeloperoxidase;
  SAA, Serum Amyloid A; CpG DNA, Cyclodextrin-Glycosylated DNA'
