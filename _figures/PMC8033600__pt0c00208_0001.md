caption: Hepatic glucose metabolism. Upon glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) mediated entry
  into the hepatocyte, glucokinase phosphorylates glucose into glucose-6-phosphate,
  which subsequently undergoes 3 major metabolic fates. This includes (1) storage
  as glycogen via glycogenesis, (2) the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to generate
  important cofactors (NADPH) to support DNL and the production of reduced glutathione,
  and (3) to generate small amounts of energy (ATP) via aerobic glycolysis, which
  results in the formation of pyruvate as an end-product. This pyruvate may be transported
  into the mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, following which the
  majority is carboxylated into oxaloacetate via PC, whereas a much smaller fraction
  is decarboxylated into acetyl CoA via PDH.
