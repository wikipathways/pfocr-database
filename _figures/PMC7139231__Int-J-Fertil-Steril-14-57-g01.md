caption: 'Concept model of micronutrients administration in support to DNA methylation
  (blue pathway) and antioxidant defences (grey pathway). Micronutrients: small amounts
  of folates, vitamins B2, B3 and B12 and zinc are needed daily to feed the carbon
  cycle and the methylations (SAMe). The same applies to vitamin B6, zinc and cysteine
  to feed glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Cross activation: SAMe acts on the enzyme CBS
  to increase GSH synthesis. Reducing power from GSH synthesis in turn activates the
  carbon cycle. Homeostatic effects: DNA methylation and antioxidant defences synergize
  in keeping a healthy DNA status.'
