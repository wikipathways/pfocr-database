caption: Association network of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the MAPK
  pathway in the organ of Corti in Fkbp5−/− mice before acoustic overexposure (AO).
  The network of DEGs in the MAPK pathway in Fkbp5−/− mice before AO as compared to
  wild-type mice before AO. Jun and p38 are recognized as key regulators in the protein-protein
  interaction network of MAPK signaling in Fkbp5−/− mice before AO. The STRING database
  (https://string-db.org) computed the graphical analysis of mutual relationships
  of DEGs as evidenced by experimentally verified interactions, co-expressions, and
  co-citations in curated databases and PubMed abstracts. The figure downloaded from
