caption: Working model of opioid regulation of FHC. Morphine-mediated activation of
  the µOR Gαi-protein pathway resulted in endolysosomal iron flux to the cytoplasm
  and a corresponding de-acidification of endolysosomes. This may be caused by µOR
  activation of two-pore channels (TPC), TRPML1, or DMT-1. Increased labile iron levels
  in the cytoplasm results in neurons producing additional FHC protein without altering
  FHC transcript levels. As FHC translation is controlled by IRPs that bind to FHC
  transcripts and prevent translation in low-iron conditions, endolysosomal iron flux
  may release IRPs from FHC transcripts, allowing FHC translation. FHC protein then
  directly interacts with the CXCR4 signaling complex and inhibits its homeostatic
  signaling pathways. Notably, this results in reduced dendritic spine density and
  reduced resilience to excitotoxicity. This pathway may be implicated in HAND with
  comorbid opioid use, as well as other neurologic disorders where neuronal iron levels
  are pathologically altered.
