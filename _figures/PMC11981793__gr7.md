caption: The main metabolic pathways of TCW were analyzed based on KEGG pathway enrichment.
  The orange box represents the metabolic pathway. The red and blue circles represent
  the up-regulation and down-regulation of DEMs in CG/UG on day 6, respectively, while
  the blank circle is the intermediate metabolite of the metabolic pathway. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
