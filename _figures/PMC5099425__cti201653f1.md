caption: Pathways of T-cell activation after allograft transplantation. After allograft
  transplantation, alloreactive CD8 T cells can be activated by several presentation
  pathways. 1. Donor DCs and other PLs migrate very quickly out of the graft into
  recipient SLOs and can directly activate CD8 T cells (direct pathway of antigen
  presentation). Many of these T cells are aberrantly activated and undergo early
  apoptosis, but some might escape deletion and recirculate to the graft. 2. Recipient
  DCs in SLOs can also capture alloantigens from the graft and promote functional
  activation of CD8 T cells restricted by recipient rather than donor MHC (indirect
  presentation pathway). 3. Donor MHC can be transferred to recipient APCs and activate
  alloreactive CD8 T cells. 4. Pre-existing memory T cells and effector T cells activated
  in SLOs by both the direct and indirect presentation pathways recirculate to the
  allograft where they can be silenced or contribute to rejection. 5. Na誰ve alloreactive
  CD8 T cells can be recruited and directly activated in the allograft. This pathway
  would only occur for liver allografts as the liver is the only organ that allows
  activation of na誰ve CD8 T cells.
