caption: 'Metabolic rewiring caused by transcription-stalling DNA damage and its contribution
  to tumor chemoresistance. (A) Cascade of events leading to reductive stress upon
  accumulation of transcription-blocking DNA damage that causes stalling of the multi-protein
  complex RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II), reduced transcription output, and thus decreased
  macromolecular synthesis. These alterations culminate in augmented concentrations
  of ATP that inhibit the glycolytic enzyme ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK,
  best known as phosphofructokinase) via allosteric mechanisms. Glucose is therefore
  diverted through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), with consequent increased
  production of NADPH that increases the reductive capacity of the cell. In the absence
  of commensurate pro-oxidant factors, the latter culminates in reductive stress (RNA
  pol II structure PDB code: 1i6h). (B) DNA-damage induces potentiation of the PPP
  and reductive stress, which may contribute to carcinogenesis and chemoresistance.
  (i) DNA damage could lead to the development of cancer cells via lesions that also
  induce transcription stalling. In cases where the DNA damage burden is not yet sufficient
  to miss checkpoints, and therefore if replication is not yet rampant, transcription
  stalling may lead to transient increased ATP concentration, glucose rerouting through
  the PPP, and reductive stress, which could provide these clones with increased fitness.
  Comparable phenomena may occur during chemotherapy; (ii) resistant clones, which
  may exhibit lower replication rates, use transient ATP surplus to reroute glucose
  through the PPP, to increase cellular reductive capacity, and to improve to clonal
  fitness. These metabolic rearrangements may ultimately favor chemoresistance.'
