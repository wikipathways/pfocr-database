caption: Gene- and pathway-based connectivity map of vismodegib and Gorlin syndrome.
  Drugs and diseases are represented as triangles and rectangles respectively. Genes
  are represented as hexagons while octagons represent pathways. Although vismodegib
  and Gorlin syndrome do not share a common gene, the hedgehog signaling pathway connects
  the drug and the disease.
