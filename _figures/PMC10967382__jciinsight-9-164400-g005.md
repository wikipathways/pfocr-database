caption: (A and B) Graphical overviews of the sphingolipid metabolism and signaling
  pathways in monocytes and neutrophils during CAP, based on literature and the KEGG
  database. Ellipses represent genes, and rectangles represent the class-wide lipid
  levels. Red indicates significantly increased, blue indicates significantly decreased,
  and gray indicates nonsignificance. Gene expression analyses were corrected for
  multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method, in an untargeted analysis (transcriptome-wide
  correction)
