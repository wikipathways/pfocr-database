caption: (A) Bacterial pathway for degradation of 109. (B) Mechanism for dehalogenation
  of 109 by GST-like PcpC. Keto-enol tautomerization is followed by conjugation to
  glutathione (GS−). Attack by an active site cysteine thiolate forms a protein-glutathione
  thioester and the dehalogenated product. The catalytic cycle is completed by the
  resolution of the protein-glutathione thioester by an exogenous glutathione thiolate.
