caption: Initiation of atherosclerosis by disturbed flow. (A) Inflammatory signaling.
  Fluid shear stress activates the PECAM–VE-cadherin–VEGFR2 pathway, which activates
  integrin signaling. Fluid shear also increases the expression of fibronectin and
  induces the assembly of the fibronectin matrix. Fibronectin switches integrin signaling
  to pro-inflammatory pathways, resulting in activation of NF-κB, PAK and JNK among
  others. (B) Anti-inflammatory signaling. Fibronectin also suppresses the flow activation
  of eNOS and production of nitric oxide (NO), thus inhibiting a major anti-inflammatory
  pathway. As a result, endothelial cells increase their expression of the leukocyte
  recruitment receptors ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and a variety of cytokines. The combination
  of these effects results in the recruitment of monocytes and other leukocytes to
  the vessel wall. NO also decreases smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction to reduce
  blood pressure (BP), and inhibits platelet reactivity, which also suppresses atherogenesis.
