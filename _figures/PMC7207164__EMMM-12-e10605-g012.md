caption: 'Left panel: physiological condition. Right panel: chronic consumption of
  THC during adolescence induces an overactivation of prefrontal CB1 receptors that
  are mainly located on GABAergic terminals. As previously established in adult mice
  that received an acute THC treatment (Puighermanal et al, ), this might lead to
  a decrease in GABA release and, subsequently, to an increase in the glutamatergic
  tone. Likewise, adolescent THC consumption might also increase serotoninergic tone
  leading to a sustained activation of 5‐HT6 receptor located on pyramidal neurons
  which is prerequisite for the long‐lasting stimulation mTOR signaling pathway. This
  in turn leads to an alteration in intrinsic neuronal properties and cognitive deficits
  in adulthood. The non‐physiological activation of mTOR and resulting imbalance in
  the excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium during adolescence might also interfere with
  maturational events occurring in the adolescent PFC leading to a persistent rearrangement
  of cortical networks affecting the serotonergic system itself and, ultimately, to
  a persistent mTOR activation. For the clarity of the figure, CB1 receptors were
  only represented on GABAergic terminals. The presence of GABA‐A receptors onto glutamatergic
  and serotoninergic terminals were previously suggested in Alle and Geiger (); Ruiz
  et al (); Yamamoto et al (); and Cerrito et al (), respectively.'
