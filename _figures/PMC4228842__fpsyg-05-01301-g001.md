caption: Schematic representation of striatal-associated decision-making neurocircuitry.
  Striatonigral D1 direct pathway neurons inhibit the SNr and release inhibition of
  thalamic activity, promoting behavior. Whereas, striatonigral D2 indirect pathway
  neurons inhibit the GP, disinhibiting the STN and exciting the SNr, which ultimately
  inhibits the thalamus and thus suppresses behavior. The balance between these opposing
  projections is likely to be regulated by glutamatergic and dopaminergic afferents,
  as well as GABAergic signaling within the striatum. DLS, Dorsolateral Striatum;
  DMS, Dorsomedial Striatum; GP, Globus Pallidus; NAc, Nucleus Accumbens; SNc, Substancia
  Nigra pars compacta; SNr, Substancia Nigra pars reticulata; STN, Subthalamic Nucleus;
  VTA, Ventral Tegmental Area.
