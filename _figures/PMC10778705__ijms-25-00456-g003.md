caption: cGAS-STING antitumoral and protumoral mechanisms. This graphical representation
  illustrates the antitumoral and protumoral roles played by the cGAS-STING signaling
  pathway. In tumor cells, the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway is predominantly
  triggered by CIN or DNA damage induced by chemo- and radiotherapy. Upon activation,
  double-stranded DNA fragments bind to cGAS, leading to the synthesis of cGAMP. Subsequently,
  cGAMP binds to STING dimers in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, activating
  STING and causing its trafficking to an ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. In this
  compartment, TBK1 is recruited to phosphorylate STING, and this phosphorylation,
  in turn, recruits IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3 can form dimers, translocate to the
  nucleus, and activate the transcription of target genes, including type I IFNs,
  that are released by tumor cells, recruiting antitumor immune cell populations.
  Conversely, a chronically low production of type I IFNs activates PARP12, whose
  overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Furthermore,
  dysregulated cGAS-STING signaling can activate the transcription factor NF-κB, leading
  to chronic inflammation and tumor-promoting effects. This includes the activation
  of the IL-6-STAT3 axis, promoting pro-survival effects, tumor cell proliferation,
  and PD-L1 expression, resulting in immune escape. Mutated forms of p53 play a role
  in the transition from the canonical cGAS-STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling to the cGAS-STING-NF-κB
  signaling, contributing to the tumor-promoting effects of the cGAS-STING pathway.
