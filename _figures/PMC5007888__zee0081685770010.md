caption: A model cell illustrates the Gq-mER signaling pathway in hypothalamic PVN
  CRH neurons that mediates the modulatory effect of E2 (or STX) on the M-current
  and on mEPSCs (1). E2 (or STX) activates a membrane-associated ER (mER) that is
  Gq coupled. The Gq protein activates PLC to catalyze the hydrolysis of membrane-bound
  PIP2 into IP3 and DAG (2). DAG activates PKCδ to augment adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity
  and generate cAMP, which in turn activates PKA (3). PKA phosphorylates KCNQ subunits
  to inhibit the M-current. Meanwhile, the hydrolysis of PIP2 (in step 1) in the membrane
  inhibits KCNQ activity. The change in ion (K+) conductance may alter the properties
  of EPSC (amplitude or frequency). The activation of PKA may also lead to the phosphorylation
  of AMPAR subunit (eg, GluR1-containing) augmenting membrane trafficking and recruitment
  to rapidly increases the amplitude of AMPAR currents (4).
