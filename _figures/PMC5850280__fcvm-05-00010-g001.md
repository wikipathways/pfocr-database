caption: Wnt activity is necessary for heart development and becomes very low in the
  adult heart. Upon stress, Wnt signaling components are upregulated in different
  heart cells. Transcriptional dependent-canonical Wnt signaling is known to be activated
  in CPCs, epicardial-derived cells (EPDCs), fibroblasts (FBs), cardiomyocytes (CMs),
  endothelial (EC) and smooth muscle cells (,). Non-canonical Wnt components are mainly
  upregulated in Macrophages (MΦ) and FBs. Wnt1 secretion from EPDCs and FB promotes
  FB expansion and fibrosis (); Wnt5a secretion from FB promotes CM-hypertrophy and
  fibrosis (,); Wnt5a secretion from macrophages (MΦ) induces inflammation and insulin
  resistance leading to cardiovascular complications (,). Secreted frizzled-related
  protein 5 (Sfrp5) by healthy adipocytes inhibits Wnt5a function from MΦ. The presence
  of unhealthy adipocytes with reduced Sfrp5 secretion increased Wnt5a activity (,).
  Wnt10b from healthy adipocytes balances adipocytes growth (). CMs-secreted Wnt Inhibitory
  Factor 1 (WIF1) reduces Wnt5a activity and may affect CPCs proliferation (). Secreted
  Wnt1, Wnt3a, Wnt5a as well as activation of Wnt/β-catenin induced by CPCs stimulate
  angiogenesis (). Exosomes derived from cardiomyocytes (CMs) showed ability to reprogram
  fibroblasts (FBs) in vitro (,). MiR-233 upregulates Wnt5a expression and miR-223
  can be found in exosomes (), thus Wnt5a regulation in cardiac failure may involve
  exosomal trafficking. Exosomes derived from adipocyte-derived mesenchymal stem cells
  (MSCs) was shown to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which may affect CM
  survival and constrains adipogenesis (). Exosomes derived from umbilical cord MSCs
  showed a pro-angiogenic effect by delivering Wnt4 and activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  in endothelial cells (ECs) (). Exosomes secreted from human induced pluripotent
  cells (iPSCs) showed protective effects on ischemic myocardium ().
