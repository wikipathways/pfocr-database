caption: (A) Pathways shown in blocks were enriched in the sub-networks (Fig. 7).
  Their cross-talks were observed in the cerebellar wound healing PPI network of zebrafish
  (solid arrows indicate cross-talks involving proteins in groups A, N, and P; dashed
  arrows indicate cross-talks involving proteins not in these groups). To establish
  cell communication and defense mechanisms (inflammation and immune response) after
  brain injury, cell communication was related to neurotransmitter-related pathways
  (through AP2 and AN2), the axon guidance pathway (through NP4 indirectly), and itself
  (through AN1). Defense mechanisms were related to the cell cycle pathway (through
  AP1), neurotransmitter-related pathways (through AN2), the cell communication pathway
  (through NP2), and neurodegenerative diseases (through NP2). Cell cycle pathways
  also interacted with gene regulation pathways through NP3 indirectly. (B) The cross-talks
  are found among pathways of inflammation, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis in cerebellar
  wound healing process. Inflammation is mediated by chemokine signaling pathway.
  New neural and vascular cells generation is mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
  and axon guidance pathway. PI3K in chemokine signaling pathway also regulates the
  PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and axon guidance pathway. PAK2 in axon guidance pathway
  also maintains the stability of vascular.

    (B) The cross-talks are found among pathways of inflammation, neurogenesis, and
