caption: Intracellular signaling pathways of CAP, SNS, and HPA axis for anti-inflammatory
  responses. Acetylcholine (Ach) can be released from the terminal efferent vagus
  nerve and further interacts with α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) on
  immune cells. Activation of α7nAChR triggers multiple intracellular signaling pathways,
  including promoting phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, inhibiting Toll-like receptor (TLR)4-myeloid
  differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)
  cascade as well as declining release of mitochondrial DNA, which contribute to suppression
  of proinflammatory phenotypes by disturbing activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  and inflammasomes. The interaction between glucocorticoids and glucocorticoid receptors
  (GRs) is capable of inhibiting production of proinflammatory cytokines by downregulating
  NF-κB activity and disturbing c-jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade after Toll-like
  receptor (TLR)7 and TLR8 stimulation. Activation of β2-adrenergic receptor with
  norepinephrine promotes the expression of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and activation of protein
  kinase A (PKA), which results in decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines
  by suppressing translocation of NF-κB. It also increases expression of fibroblast
  growth factor 21 (FGF21) which further suppresses NF-κB activation by promoting
  activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2-STAT3 cascades in
  an autocrine manner
