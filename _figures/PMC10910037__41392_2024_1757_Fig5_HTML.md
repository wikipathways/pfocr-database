caption: Strategies for targeting NF-κB signaling in human diseases. Inhibitors of
  NF-κB are widely used in various clinical settings for the treatment of tumors,
  diabetes, and other conditions. These drugs inhibit the NF-κB pathway through different
  mechanisms. NSAIDs selectively inhibit IκB to suppress the activation of NF-κB.
  Dexamethasone inhibits NF-κB by directly coupling with the RelA subunit to block
  its functional activity. IMiD drugs such as thalidomide suppress the transcription
  function downstream of NF-κB to exert their effects. Monoclonal antibodies, including
  anti-PD-L1, anti IL-1, and anti TNF-α block the binding of ligands and respective
  receptors to inhibit their biological effects. Proteasome inhibitors include Bortezomib,
  Carfilzomib, Ixazomib, and Lactacystin act by halting protein degradation that ultimately
  results in apoptosis and cell death. Tacrolimus inhibits the protein phosphatase
  activity of calcineurin, preventing the nuclear translocation of NFAT and subsequently
  suppressing the activation of T cells. IκBα super-repressor inhibits the translocation
  of NF-κB into the nucleus. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibits the intracellular
  phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase to block tumor cell growth. Natural compounds
  and derivatives such as resveratrol, quercetin, and isothiocyanates inhibits NF-κB
  through diverse mechanisms and exerts antitumor effects. Strategies targeting non-coding
  RNAs are also in development, such as anti-miR oligonucleotides, which can be used
  to inhibit miRNAs that promote the NF-κB signaling pathway. NF-κB-activated gene
  expression is a novel gene therapy to treat cancer by utilizing overactivation of
  NF-κB in cancer cells. IL-1 interleukin 1, IMiD immunomodulatory drugs, NFAT nuclear
  factor of activated T cells, NSAIDs nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, PD-L1
  programmed death-ligand 1, TNF-α tumor necrosis factor α
