caption: Activation of NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels
  (L-VSCC) trigger calcium influx and induction of calcium-dependent signalling molecules,
  including CaMKK that activates the kinases CaMKII and CaMKIV, calcium-sensitive
  adenylyl cyclases (AC) that activate PKA, and the calcium dependent phosphatase
  calcineurin. In addition, the RAS–ERK–RSK/MSK pathway is activated upon stimulation
  of L-VSCC. These signalling cascades phosphorylate or dephosphorylate transcriptional
  regulators in the nucleus, leading to the expression of transcription factors (shown
  as c-Fos and NPAS4). These transcription factors contribute to the regulation of
  activity-dependent gene transcription and to the expression of effectors that function
  to modify synapses (shown as BDNF, Arc and Ube3A). In addition, changes in chromatin
  modifications (including histone acetylation), and the phosphorylation of chromatin-associated
  proteins (for example, MECP2) may modulate activity-dependent gene transcription.
  Mutations of proteins involved in activity-dependent gene expression are associated
  with some forms of ASD including L-VSCC in Timothy syndrome, RSK2 in Coffin-Lowry,
  CBP in Rubenstein-Taybi, Ube3A in Angelman syndrome and MeCP2 in Rett syndrome.
