caption: Mechanisms of hepcidin regulation in hepatocytes. Iron excess is taken up
  by LSECs by an unknown mechanism and initiates the production and release of BMP6.
  Dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap 1 also induces BMP6 production. BMP2 is constitutively
  expressed. BMP6, BMP2 and the heterodimer BMP6/BMP2 bind to types I and II BMP receptors
  activating the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of the SMAD 1/5/8 complex
  assisted by SMAD4 leads to the translocation into the nucleus and attachment to
  a BMP-response element (BMP-RE) in the HAMP gene encoding hepcidin. In iron overload,
  holo-Tf binds to TfR1 and TfR2 on the surface of hepatocytes. It is believed that
  HFE dissociates from TFR1 and attaches to TfR2 and HJV, activating the BMP/SMAD
  signaling pathway. Neogenin (Neo) stabilizes HJV and the BMP receptor complex. On
  the contrary, in iron deficiency, TfR1 increases iron uptake from Tf, but also detaches
  HFE from TfR2 and blocks the BMP/SMAD cascade. SMAD 6 and 7, the immunophilin FKB12,
  erythroferrone, miR122 and matriptase 2 (MT 2) that cleaves HJV are negative regulators
  of hepcidin production. Inflammation also may increase hepcidin production by a
  BMP-independent mechanism. Secretion of IL-6 and IL-1β by macrophages IL-6 activate
  hepcidin via the JAK/STAT3 and the NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways, respectively,
  leading to the binding at the relative response elements. For more details, see
  text. Black arrows indicate induction. Red arrows indicate inhibition
