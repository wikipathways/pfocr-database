caption: The highest confidence network constructed with differentially methylated
  genes by proton beam treatment on the MCF-7 cell. The CpGs in which methylation
  level was significantly changed by proton beam treatment were analyzed through the
  Ingenuity pathway analysis software tool. The analysis indicated “Developmental
  Disorder, Hereditary Disorder, Metabolic Disease” as the network of highest confidence.
  Red-colored genes are hypermethylated in the proton beam treated cells, and green-colored
  genes indicate hypomethylation, with intensity signifying the magnitude of methylation
  change. Solid and dashed lines represent direct and indirect interactions, respectively,
  with each interaction supported by at least one literature reference.
