caption: Molecular mechanisms underpinning the DAs resistance in PRL- and GH-secreting
  PitNET. 1) The gene variant NcoI T+ of the synonymous polymorphism NcoI, consisting
  in a cytosine to thymine (NcoI C/T) transition at position 957, leads to a decreased
  D2DR mRNA stability and synthesis through a putative alteration in the receptor
  mRNA folding, conferring resistance to the antitumoral action of CAB in PRL-secreting
  PitNET; 2) Estrogens may affect the D2S/D2L ratio tumors, increasing the expression
  of D2L and therefore affecting the efficacy of DAs treatment in PRL-secreting PitNET;
  3) D2DR in PRL-secreting PitNET cell model and primary cultures of nonfunctioning
  PitNET triggers the β-arrestin 2-mediated PKB dephosphorylation inducing antiproliferative
  effect and the lack of β-arrestin 2 induces DAs resistance in nonfunctioning PitNET;
  4) FLNA is involved in the regulation of D2DR membrane expression and signalling.
  Indeed, FLNA anchorage and expression of D2DR on the plasma membrane, by controlling
  D2DR fate towards recycling processes or degradation in PRL- and GH-secreting PitNET;
  5) D2DR activates ROCK/LIMK pathway with consequent inactivation of the protein
  cofilin resulting in a loss of its ability to bind the actin and, thus, promoting
  cell migration and invasion; 6) miR-93-5p targets Smad7, a negative regulator of
  TGF-β1/Smad signalling, sustaining the TGF-β1-induced fibrosis in PRL-secreting
  PitNET. Alongside, miR-93-5p down-regulates p21 inducing cell-cycle progression
  and losing the control of ROCK/LIMK pathway, and down-regulates ATG7, decreasing
  the autophagic cell death induced by CAB in PRL- and GH-secreting PitNET; 7) the
  reduced expression of miR-145-5p stimulates the TPT1 protein resulting in decreased
  DNA repair, increased cell migration and invasion and reduced apoptosis and autophagy.
