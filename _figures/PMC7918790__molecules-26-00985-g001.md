caption: Graphical summary of some inflammatory and oxidative pathways related to
  obesity. High glucose intake and FFA-dependent TLR4 activation lead to the activation
  of NOX, which can also be activated by PKC in adipocytes. NOX mediates intracellular
  ROS generation, mainly O2•−, both in preadipocytes and macrophages. Likewise, mitochondrial
  ROS exacerbate oxidative stress and inflammatory processes in obesity. JNK mediates
  ROS and oxidative stress-dependent activation of NF-κB and AP-1. These latters regulate
  gene expression of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1 and PAI-1. The NF‑κB pathway might be upregulated
  in hypoxic adipose tissue and in response to TNF-α. Furthermore, TNF-α inhibits
  AMPK pathways, resulting in increased COX-2 and PGE2 and decreased PPARγ. TNF-α
  and IL-6 secreted from WAT enhance CRP and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) release
  from the liver in response to hepatic oxidative stress. A crosstalk between adipocytes
  and resident macrophages reinforces oxidative stress through TNF-α–mediated ROS
  generation within WAT cells in an autocrine and paracrine manner.
