caption: GenMAPP of virus-induced gene expression changes affecting integrin subunits,
  integrin-to-actin signaling pathways, and actin cytoskeleton. This map was generated
  by using the “integrin-mediated cell adhesion” KEGG pathway as a template. Genes
  (abbreviated names based on SwissProt accession number) are shown in boxes (see
  Materials and Methods for website and other information files). The map also includes
  two genes from the signaling category (the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase subunits
  p110 [PI3K p110] and p55 [PI3K p55]) and eight genes from the GTPase category (rhoA,
  rac1, cdc42, rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 [ROCK1], LIM
  motif-containing protein kinase 1 [LIMK1], and p21-activated kinases 2 [PAK 2],
  3 [PAK 3], and 6 [PAK 6]). Genes represented by more than one spot in the SAM-generated
  list are shown in a dashed box. Genes consistently upmodulated are bright orange,
  genes consistently downmodulated are green, genes not found in any of the data sets
  are uncolored, and one gene, which scored as SAM significantly upmodulated at one
  time (integrin β4 was upmodulated in the 98 hpi data set), is light orange. The
  mean fold change (calculated by SAM) is noted to the right of each box, with positive
  values indicating upmodulation and negative values indicating downmodulation. The
  two dashed parallel lines indicate the plasma membrane. Solid arrows denote proximal
  events, and dashed arrows denote distal processes in the pathways shown. MLC, myosin
  light chain.
