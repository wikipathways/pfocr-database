caption: Nutrient signaling to mTORC1. The involvement of glutamine in nutrient regulation
  of mTORC1 signaling is depicted. Glutamine, as a free amino acid, promotes amino
  acid-induced mTORC1 activation by enhancing the uptake of essential amino acids
  including leucine. In addition, through metabolism to αKG, glutamine is able to
  activate Rag GTPases through a leucine/GDH-dependent mechanism. Leucine can also
  signal to the Rags by activating LRS and/or inhibiting SH3BP4, which is proposed
  to inhibit leucine signaling to mTORC1 by preventing the formation of the active
  Rags (). The metabolism of the critical nutrients glucose and glutamine contribute
  to generating cellular energy, which is required for the assembly of a functional,
  dimeric mTORC1 via the TTT-RUVBL1/2 complex and its subsequent amino acid/Rag-dependent
  lysosomal localization.
