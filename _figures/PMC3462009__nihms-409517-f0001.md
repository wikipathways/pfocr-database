caption: To analyze cellular vulnerability and dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation
  relevant to PD, ten different cellular stressors were administered to cells derived
  from PD patients and asymptomatic individuals carrying PINK1 or LRRK2 genetic mutations,
  and healthy subjects who were not carrying these PD-associated mutations. The cellular
  stressors were known to affect pathways implicated in PD pathogenesis, such as oxidative
  phosphorylation, the autophagy-lysosomal pathway or the ubiquitin-proteasome system
  (UPS).
