caption: Routes of KYNA formation. The canonical pathway is initiated by the oxidative
  degradation of tryptophan to L-KYN and the subsequent irreversible transamination
  of L-KYN to KYNA. Alternative routes to KYNA involve interactions between tryptophan,
  L-KYN and D-KYN, respectively, and ROS. Moreover, DAAO can convert D-KYN to KYNA.
  Fluctuations in KYNA levels can alter glutamatergic, dopaminergic, GABAergic and
  cholinergic neurotransmission, and may thus be causally involved in cognitive impairments
  in aging and major brain diseases.
