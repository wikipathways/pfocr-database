caption: Schematic illustrating NLR attenuation of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB
  signaling. NF-κB is a master regulator of gene transcription and contributes to
  several hallmarks of cancer. NLRX1, NLRP12, and NLRC3 negatively regulate NF-κB
  signaling at multiple levels. NLRX1 interacts with and inhibits TRAF6 and the IKK
  complex resulting in the attenuation of NF-κB signaling following TLR stimulation.
  Likewise, NLRC3 was also shown to interact with TRAF6 and attenuate NF-κB signaling
  through a similar mechanism. NLRP12, has been shown to attenuate both the canonical
  NF-κB signaling pathway through modulating the phosphorylation of IRAK-1 and the
  non-canonical NF-κB pathway through interactions with TRAF3 and NIK.
