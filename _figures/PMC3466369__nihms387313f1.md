caption: Alveolar epithelial type II cells and alveolar macrophages likely receive
  cholesterol from circulating low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein
  (LDL, HDL) through the LDL receptor (LDLR) and scavenger receptor B type I (SR-BI),
  respectively. HDL is also the major source of the antioxidant vitamin E for type
  II cells. Class A scavenger receptors (SR-A) on macrophages play a role in clearance
  of oxidized alveolar lipids that may otherwise mediate cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory
  effects. The disposal pathway for cholesterol from type II cells and macrophages
  involves the cholesterol efflux transporters ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) A1 and ABCG1,
  and perhaps also SR-BI. ABCA1 also mediates basolateral surfactant efflux from type
  II cells; deletion of either ABCA1 or ABCG1 leads to severe surfactant proteinosis
  and lipidosis. Disordered cholesterol/phospholipid trafficking through the lung,
  such as with ABCG1 deletion, alters immune cell trafficking to the lung as well
  as the lung’s immune responsiveness to a variety of environmental exposures, indicating
  that there is intimate crosstalk between lipid and immune homeostasis in the lung.
