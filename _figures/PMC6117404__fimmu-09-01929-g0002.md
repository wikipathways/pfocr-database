caption: T. cruzi evades the microbicidal action of the macrophage by escaping from
  the phagolysosome into the cytoplasm, and by using enzymes that detoxify oxygen
  and nitrogen reactive species. The parasite enters the cell and escapes from the
  normal phagolysosome pathway, before its differentiation, and replication (Left).
  On the (Right), the peroxidases used by the parasite to inactivate different components
  of the oxidative burst imposed by activated macrophage are represented. TcCPX, T.
  cruzi cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidases; TcMPX, T. cruzi mitochondrial tryparedoxin
  peroxidases; TcAPX, T. cruzi ascorbate-dependent haemoperoxidase; TcGPXI, T. cruzi
  glutathione peroxidases I; TcGPXII, T. cruzi glutathione peroxidases II.
