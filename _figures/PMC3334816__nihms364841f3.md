caption: 'Upon synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and glycosylation in the Golgi,
  CLN3 has several potential fates that may in part be mediated by compartment-specific
  interacting proteins. The sorting of CLN3 into post-Golgi transport vesicles may
  be directed by adaptor proteins AP-1 and AP-3 in clathrin-coated membrane buds from
  the trans-Golgi network. A significant proportion of CLN3 then enters late endosomes,
  which undergo acidification to form lysosomes. A portion of the lysosomal pool fuses
  with autophagosomes, double membrane structures that may be derived from the Golgi
  (as shown) or other sources, including the endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes (not
  shown). CLN3 may interact with a complex of autophagy proteins including Atg3 and
  Atg7, which catalyze the addition of phosphatidylethanolamine to LC3 to form LC3-II,
  a proteolipid that assembles into the inner and outer membranes of the nascent phagophore
  and promotes its extension to a mature autophagosome. An undetermined fraction of
  CLN3 may be directed from transport vesicles to the plasma membrane or from late
  endosomes to the plasma membrane, where it may interact with components of the membrane
  cytoskeleton such as nonmuscle myosin-IIB and fodrin, which links plasma membrane
  proteins such as the Na+/K+-ATPase to the actin cytoskeletion. Whether CLN3 interacts
  with these proteins as an endosomal protein (as shown) or as a plasma membrane protein
  is unclear. The possible interaction of CLN3 with AP-2, the adaptor protein involved
  in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins (labeled as cargo receptors),
  is less clear. A portion of CLN3 may facilitate the transport of sphingolipids,
  including GalCer, from the trans Golgi to the plasma membrane. Recent evidence in
  yeast models suggests that CLN3 or its yeast ortholog Btn1 (shown) is involved in
  retrograde transport from the endocytic compartment to the trans-Golgi network.
  This may be mediated indirectly by assembly of the SNARE protein Sed5, which must
  be phosphorylated to direct retrograde transport. Sed5 is either directly or indirectly
  phosphorylated by the palmitoylated endosome- and vacuole-associated casein kinase
  Yck3. It was speculated that Btn1p may exert a desaturase activity on the palmitoyl
  moiety of Yck3 and thereby promote its activation of Sed5. CLN3 interactors are
  shown in red text.GalCer: Galactosylceramide.'
