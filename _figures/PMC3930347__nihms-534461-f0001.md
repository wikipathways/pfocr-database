caption: The intersection of glucose metabolism and NAD salvage. Glycolysis, depicted
  on the left, reduces 2 units of NAD+ per unit of glucose metabolized. The reducing
  equivalent stored in NADH can be transferred to the mitochondria to facilitate oxidative
  phosphorylation or can be oxidized back to NAD+ concurrent with the generation of
  lactate. In both cases, regeneration of NAD+ facilities continued glucose metabolism
  in glycolysis. The NAD salvage pathway is depicted on the right and recycles nicotinamide
  back into NAD+ after its metabolism by NAD+ consumers (e.g. SIRT1 or PARP1). Small
  molecule mediated inhibition of NAMPT, the rate limiting enzymes in NAD salvage,
  impairs pancreatic tumor growth.
