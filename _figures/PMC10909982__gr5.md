caption: The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway potentially contributes to PTC progress.
  β-catenin is phosphorylated and degraded when the Wnt signal is absent. However,
  upon activation of the Wnt signal by binding to Frizzled family proteins and its
  ligand Wnt, the protein tyrosine kinase Dishevelled (Dvl) gets activated, protecting
  phosphorylated β-catenin from degradation. The β-catenin then enters the nucleus
  through nuclear pore complexes where it binds with TCF/LEF transcription factors
  to promote transcription of target genes such as c-Myc and cyclin D1 involved in
  cellular proliferation
