caption: In this diagram colored arrows represent pathways that have been shown to
  be used in the cell types indicated, grey arrows indicate pathways that might be
  used, but have yet to be clearly defined, and dashed arrows indicate multiple steps
  shown in a single arrow. A. In activated neutrophils, M1 macrophages and iNOS expressing
  DCs stimulated with TLR agonists, Warburg metabolism dominates. ATP production and
  cellular survival are dependent on glycolysis, with the majority of pyruvate being
  converted to lactate. In this pro-glycolytic state, the PPP is active and provides
  NADPH for key microbicidal pathways regulated by NADPH oxidase. Under these conditions,
  there is little evidence for OXPHOS, but maintenance of mitochondrial potential
  and integrity are needed to maintain cell survival. B. Activated T cells engage
  OXPHOS and glycolysis. Most pyruvate is excreted as lactate, but some also enters
  the TCA cycle. Glutaminolysis is an important pathway in these cells as glutamine
  replenishes TCA cycle intermediates as they are withdrawn for biosynthesis. Metabolizing
  glucose in the PPP can yield both nucleotides and NADPH for lipid synthesis. C.
  Memory T cells, Treg cells, and alternatively activated macrophages use FAO for
  survival and to support function. Other pathways are depicted in grey as the extent
  to which they are used in these cells, if at all, has not been established. D. Overview
  of the TCA cycle.
