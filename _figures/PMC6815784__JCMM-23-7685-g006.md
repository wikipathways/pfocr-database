caption: 'Schematic cartoon showing the proposed signalling pathway linking lncRNA
  CHAR to CH. lncRNA CHAR is down‐regulated in pathological CH; down‐regulation of
  CHAR weakens its ceRNA action on miR‐20b to increase the functional level of this
  miRNA; up‐regulation of miR‐20b represses its target gene PTEN leading to enhanced
  activation of AKT and consequent exaggeration of CH. This suggests a new signalling
  pathway: CHAR↓ → miR‐20b↑ → PTEN↓ → p‐AKT↑ → CH. CHAR, cardiac hypertrophy‐associated
  regulator; lncRNA, Long non‐coding RNA; PTEN, Phosphatase and tensin homolog'

  hypertrophy via regulating miR‐20b and the downstream PTEN/AKT pathway.
