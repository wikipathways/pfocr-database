caption: Potential mechanisms through which astrocyte-neuronal metabolic coupling
  and lactate release can mediate pain-related neuronal activity. (1) Lactate taken
  up by neurons via MCT2 is converted to pyruvate, where it can be used to generate
  ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. (2) Neurons express HCAR1, a Gi-protein coupled
  receptor which inhibits adenylyl cyclase and reduces intracellular cAMP. Neurons
  also appear to express an unidentified lactate receptor which activates adenylyl
  cyclase and increases cAMP. (3) Similarly, astrocytes have been found to express
  HCAR1, however recent findings also suggest the presence of a lactate receptor which
  exerts opposite effects and activates rather than inhibits adenylyl cyclase. (4)
  Lactate binding to HCAR1 was recently associated with a non-Gi-protein mechanism,
  acting through β-arrestin2-MAPK-signaling. The β-arrestin2-MAPK pathway has been
  associated with induction of astrocyte proliferation. (5) Glutamate released into
  the synaptic cleft is taken up by astrocytes via GLT-1 and GLAST. Astrocytic GS
  converts glutamate to glutamine, which is exported and taken up by neurons. Altered
  GLT-1/GLAST expression may affect synaptic transmission through dysregulation of
  extracellular glutamate concentrations.
