caption: Hypothetical mechanism by SARS-CoV-2 in establishing an inflammatory feedback
  loop between IL-6 and angiotensin II. Cytokine IL-6 has been found increased in
  COVID-19 patients, thus suggesting a direct role of SARS-CoV-2 in a massive cytokine
  release. IL-6 is able to activate a soluble form of IL-6 receptor interacting with
  gp130, thereby promoting the downstream activation of JAK/STAT signaling, and thely
  production of IL-6. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has been directly related with the occurrence
  of cardiovascular implications, such as coronary atherosclerosis, inflammation in
  the vascular system and diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Synthesis and secretion
  of IL-6 are directly implicated in cardiovascular damages. Indeed, IL-6 production
  is also induced by angiotensin II in AT1/JAK/STAT-dependent manner. As observed
  in SARS-CoV, also SARS-CoV-2 may be hypothesized to downregulate ACE2 expression,
  thus resulting in over-production of angiotensin II by the related enzyme ACE. In
  turn, increased angiotensin II enhances IL-6 production via JAK/STAT pathway, thus
  establishing a positive inflammatory feedback loop, ultimately resulting in the
  exacerbation of vascular and lung injuries. Moreover, the angiotensin II/AT1 receptor
  axis activates ADAM17 that cleavages and inactivates ACE2, enhancing angiotensin
  II retention. In addition, ADAM17 induction has been found to process the membrane
  form of IL-6Rα to the soluble form (sIL-6Rα), followed by the gp130-mediated activation
  of STAT3 via the sIL-6Rα-IL-6 complex in a variety of IL-6Rα-negative non-immune
  cells. The IL-6 amplifier promotes the production and secretion of several pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6, sustaining the IL-6 amplifier-driven positive
  feedback. SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; IL-6, interleukin
