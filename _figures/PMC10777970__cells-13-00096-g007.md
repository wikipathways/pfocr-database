caption: The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. When Hh ligand binding is not present,
  the PTCH1 receptor is a negative regulator of the Hh pathway, as it impairs SMO.
  Upon tethering of Hh to PTCH1, it liberates the SMO. Subsequently, the SMO induces
  the downstream signal transduction pathway that causes the activation of the transcription
  factor GLI. As a consequence, the GLI translocates in the nucleus and initiates
  the Hh-pathway-driven gene expression. Activated GLI (aGLI); inactivated GLI (iGLI)
