caption: "After TNFα binds to TNFR1, it forms a TNFR1 signaling complex by recruiting
  TRADD, RIP1, and TRAF2/5, activating downstream signaling pathways such as NF-kB.
  The complexes of TRADD, RIP1, and TRAF2 proteins dissociate from receptors and recruit
  other proteins to compose distinct secondary complexes to regulate apoptosis and
  necroptosis. Among them, apoptosis is mainly initiated by the recruitment of FADD,
  which recruits and activates caspase 8 to cause apoptosis, while necroptosis requires
  the activation of RIP3 and the recruitment of downstream MLKL proteins. Phosphorylated
  MLKL proteins migrate to the cell membrane, causing K+ efflux and Na+ influx"
