caption: Schematic diagram of metabolic rewiring mechanisms in drug-resistant breast
  cancer cells. Drug-sensitive cells have lower methylation levels of PFKFB3, PKM2,
  and PHGDH, increasing polyubiquitination of PFKFB3, PHGDH, and FASN to reduce influx
  from the glycolytic system into the serine synthesizing pathway (top). PRMT1 methylates
  PFKFB3, PKM2, and PHGDH to determine the fate of the carbon source for fatty acid
  synthesis to support chemoresistance in TNBC (bottom). Arginine methylation of PHGDH
  (R20/54) stabilizes the enzyme to enhance the serine synthetic pathway and de novo
  fatty acid synthesis through augmentation of αKG coupled with a PSAT1-involving
  reaction. Enhanced fatty acid synthesis sustains enzyme activity by S-palmitoylation
  of PHGDH and FASN through de novo synthesis of palmitate, promoting positive feedback
  between the serine synthetic pathway and fatty acid synthesis to acquire malignant
  traits in TNBC. Blockade of this feedback system using the PRMT1 inhibitor MS023
  or S-palmitoyltransferase inhibitor 2-Br-Pal unlocks chemoresistance to paclitaxel
