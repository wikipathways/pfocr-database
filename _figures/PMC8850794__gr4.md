caption: The application of nanotechnology in drug delivery of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors
  in lung cancer. The administration of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors in lung cancer could
  result in tumor regression; however, due to low local concentration, those treatments
  need to be applied in high dosages and/or in a combination form which consequently
  leads to higher AEs. Another challenge is the bio-degradation of drugs that diminishes
  their efficacy in the tumor microenvironment. The conjugation of inhibitors with
  nanoparticles is a novel approach to deliver drugs more efficiently to the tumor
  microenvironment. Nanoparticles not only elevate the local concentration of inhibitors
  that results in higher tumor regression but also reduce the off-target toxicities
  and drug bio-degradation.
