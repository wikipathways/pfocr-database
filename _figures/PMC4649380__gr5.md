  Interaction partners with links to cell-cycle progression were chosen to determine
  how CTGF would affect cell-cycle progression (). The latter interaction partners
  were compiled into a network, which was then visualized using Edinburgh Pathway
  notation. () In the model, activation links (A, green lines), inhibitory links (I,
  red lines), binding partners (B, black lines), phosphorylation targets (black lines),
  cytosol-nucleus transport (T, blue lines), and possible synergistic actions (&)
  are shown.
