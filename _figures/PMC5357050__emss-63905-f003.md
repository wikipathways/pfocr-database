caption: 'Schematic representation of the BH4 recycling pathway and eNOS coupling.
  BH4 is synthesised de novo from GTP via a series of reactions involving GTPCH, 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin
  synthase and sepiapterin reductase (– – –). DHFR can regenerate BH4 from BH2 as
  part of the recycling pathway. Both BH4 and BH2 bind eNOS with equal affinity, altering
  the ‘balance’ between NO and superoxide production by eNOS: BH4 bound eNOS produces
  NO while BH2 bound eNOS promotes uncoupling and eNOS-derived superoxide rather than
  NO.'
