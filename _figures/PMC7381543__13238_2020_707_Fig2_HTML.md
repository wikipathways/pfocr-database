caption: 'Molecular and metabolic regulation of effector and memory T cell differentiation.
  Following immunization or infection, naïve CD4+ T cells are activated by cognate
  antigens presented by DCs through MHC class II and upregulated CD40L expressions.
  Then, DCs are licensed by cognate CD4+ T cells through a CD40-CD40L interaction,
  which enables the DCs to obtain sufficient antigen-presenting and co-stimulation
  capacities to induce a robust CD8+ T cell response. In some cases, DC functional
  maturation is mediated by TLR ligands and bypasses the requirement for CD4+ T cells.
  The differentiation of effector and memory T cells is orchestrated by three major
  signals: TCR, co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines. Effector T cells formation
  initiates with TCR signals delivered by DCs through MHC class I in the presence
  of antigen, while memory T cells are generated after the antigen is quickly cleared.
  Integration of TCR signals, co-stimulatory signals including CD28-CD80/CD86, CD40-CD40L,
  OX40-OX40L, CD27-CD70 and 4-1BB-4-1BBL plays important roles in certain inflammatory
  settings. Cytokines can affect T-cell differentiation, proliferation and survival
  at many stages of the immune response. For example, IFN-γ α/β, IL-27, and IL-12
  derived from mature DCs and IFN-γ and IL-2 derived from helper CD4+ T cells activate
  the JAK-STAT signaling pathway mediated through STAT1/STAT4 or STAT5 in effector
  T cells, while IL-10 and IL-21 secreted by helper CD4+ T cells selectively activate
  STAT3 and STAT5 in memory T cells. In addition, memory T cells are maintained in
  an antigen-independent, cytokine-independent manner mainly through the action of
  stromal cell derived IL-7 and DC derived IL-15, which promotes cell survival by
  upregulating the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2 and BCL-xL. These
  three classes of signals are closely linked and act collaboratively to endow T cells
  with different transcriptional profiles. Therefore, effector T cells, characterized
  as KLRG1high IL7Rαlow IL2Rαhigh express high level of transcriptional factors such
  as T-bet, Blimp1, and ID2, and epigenetic regulators including DNMT3a and TET2.
  In contrast, memory T cells characterized as KLRG1low IL7Rαhigh CD27high CXCR3high
  express high level of EOMES, BCL-6, ID3, BATCH2, SOCS3, FOXO1, TCF1 and LEF1. Additionally,
  effector and memory T cell differentiation are coupled with metabolic reprogramming.
  In effector T cells, activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway promotes aerobic glycolysis,
  a hall-mark of activated T cells. In contrast, in memory T cells, cellular stress,
  such as growth factor deprivation or a low ratio of ATP/AMP, will activate AMPK
  and inhibit mTOR signaling. Moreover, extracellular ATP released from dying cells
  can activate P2RX7, which further induces AMPK expression and mitochondrial homeostasis.
  As a result, anabolism is shut down, and metabolism switched to fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Accordingly, pharmacological inhibitors
  of mTOR pathway such as rapamycin can be useful to memory T cell induction. Recently
  elevating L-arginine level was also reported to promote the metabolic shift from
  glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation and promote cell survival, providing another
  potential strategy for memory T cell generation in vitro'
