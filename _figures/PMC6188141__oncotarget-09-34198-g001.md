caption: 'Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation mediated by the UPS is known
  to rid the cells of misfolded proteins, whose accumulation would otherwise induce
  proteotoxic stress, unfolded protein response and ultimately cell death after sustained
  disruption. Ubiquitylation is also involved in regulating DNA repair and other signaling
  pathways such as the NF-κB pathway. Three examples of the different ubiquitylation
  patterns are depicted in the diagram: mono-ubiquitin, Lys48- (K48)- and Lys63 (K63)-linked
  polyubiquitin chains. UBA1, NAE and the proteasome are targeted by TAK-243, pevonedistat
  and bortezomib, respectively.'
