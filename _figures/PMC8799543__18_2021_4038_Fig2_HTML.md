caption: MIF-induced signaling pathways (Created with BioRender.com). MIF mediates
  its biological activities either via membrane receptors (left panel) or through
  intracellular binding partners (right panel). Extrinsic pathway MIF binds to its
  membrane receptor CD74 or/and atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3), which initiates
  a phosphorylation signal through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. The downstream effects
  of MIF increase cellular survival and proliferation through the inhibition of p53.
  The intracellular domain (ICD) of CD74 could enter into nucleus and signal through
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). The interaction of MIF-CXCR2/4 induces cell migration.
  Intrinsic pathway Depending on the oxidative environment, cytosolic MIF interacts
  with thioredoxin-1, resulting in internalization of MIF. Intracellular MIF binds
  to superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and inhibits the accumulation of misfolded SOD1,
  protecting from motoneuron damage. Under ischemic or excitotoxic stress, apoptosis-inducing
  factor (AIF) binds to MIF and guides MIF into the nucleus. Nuclear MIF works as
  a nuclease and causes DNA damage, leading to cell death. Intracellular MIF interacts
  with C-Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (JAB1), inhibiting JAB1-induced transcription
  of AP-1 and degradation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27Kip1), resulting
  in cell cycle arrest. Upon damage or infection, intracellular MIF interacts with
  nitrogen permease regulator-like 3 (NLRP3) and facilitates the interaction between
  NLRP3 and vimentin, resulting in IL1β release. MIF has been identified as the first
  endogenous inhibitor of HTRA1, which prevents the inhibition of astrocyte migration.
  Gremlin-1 also binds to MIF with high affinity, which results in MIF-dependent inflammation
  and cell differentiation
