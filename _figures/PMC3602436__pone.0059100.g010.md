caption: Blast limb trauma induces systemic inflammatory response, oxidative stress
  and suppression of CSE/H2S pathway. All those induce to the disruption of endothelium
  and the increase of permeability of gas blood barrier, and ultimately lead to lung
  oedema formation and remote lung injury following blast limb trauma. Exogenous NaHS
  treatment attenuates lung injury following blast limb trauma via preventing the
  decrease of plasma H2S, suppressing the production of cytokines and adhesion molecular,
  such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, ICAM1, CXCL-2 and CD11b  and ameliorating oxidative
  stress though Nrf2, K+ATP and Cl− channel and inhibition of iNOS/NO pathway and
  L-type Ca2+ channels , , .
