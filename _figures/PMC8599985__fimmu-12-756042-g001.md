caption: A schematic representation of the role of various non-coding RNAs in modulating
  the differentiation of T cells via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK signaling cascades.
  a) The MAPK/ERK pathway can be triggered via several growth factors including PDGF,
  EGF, NGF, and insulin. Upon receptor dimerization, activation of its tyrosine kinase
  module could be triggered, subsequently recruiting Grb2 and SOSto the phosphorylated
  domain, thus creating the Grb2-SOS complex. Furthermore, the GTP binding protein
  RAS interacts with the Grb-2-SOS complex that in turn leads to the activation of
  RAS. Activated GTP-bound RAS plays an effective role in upregulating the phosphorylation
  of MEK1/2 (MAPKK), which then phosphorylates ERK1/2 (MAPK). Eventually, ERK is transferred
  to the nucleus where it triggers the activation of various target genes involved
  in a variety of cellular processes (–). b) The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is activated
  by a subset of growth factors such as PI3KCI, which phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3.
  PIP3 has an important role in recruiting AKT which gets activated through double
  phosphorylation (via PDK1 and mTORC2). In addition, activated AKT suppresses TSC2
  through phosphorylation. Inactive TSC1/2 complex is able to bind RHEB, which eventually
  triggers the activation of mTORC1. The mTORC1 has a significant impact on many downstream
  proteins, such as S6K1/2 and 4EBP1 (, ). Besides, exposure to IL-17 results in receptor-mediated
  activation of Src, MAPKs, and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades (). Moreover, subsequent
  to JAK activation, CRKL is phosphorylated by TYK2 that could result in CRKL complexation
  with STAT5. STATs in turn interacts with individual mediators of the PI3K/AKT signaling
  cascade (). Accumulating finding has demonstrated that miR-let-7d-3p via directly
  suppressing AKT1 could regulate expression level of IL-17 in CD4+ T cells through
  the AKT1/mTOR signaling pathway (). In addition, another research has authenticated
  that overexpression of lncRNA NEAT1 could promote the expression levels of CXCL8
  and TNF-α in Sjögren’s syndrome via positively regulating MAPK signaling (). Green
  arrows indicate upregulation of target genes modulated via ncRNAs (lncRNAs, and
  miRNAs), red arrows depict inhibition by these ncRNAs. All the information regarding
  the role of these ncRNAs in modulating T call differentiation can be seen in and.
