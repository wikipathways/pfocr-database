caption: Schematic illustration of the MyD88‐dependent and MyD88‐independent pathways
  mediated by TLR4 ligation to induce NF‐κB activation and cytokine gene expression.
  TLR4 activates the NF‐κB transcription factor via the adaptor molecules MyD88 and
  Mal, which activate several kinases including TAK1 in the MyD88‐dependent pathway.
  The IRF transcription factor is activated by TLR4 via TRIF, an alternative adaptor
  molecule in the MyD88‐independent pathway. The TLR signalling antagonist (+)‐naloxone
  binds MD‐2 to prevent TLR4 engaging with LPS or other ligands. Term labour is mediated
  by the MyD88‐independent but not the MyD88‐dependent pathway of TLR4 signalling,
  while preterm birth involves both signalling pathways (see text for details)
