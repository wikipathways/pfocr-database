caption: a | In DNA vaccination, the plasmid DNA contains a fungal gene that is often
  under the control of an active promoter. Other genes can be co-expressed, for example
  cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12 that can exert adjuvant effects. The fungal
  proteins are translated and from the cytosol enter the endogenous route of antigen
  processing, as shown in . Therefore, this vaccine strategy primes CD8 + T cells,
  which function by producing T-helper 1 (TH1) cytokines, and perhaps lytic products
  such as perforin or granulysin. A secretion signal (not shown) can be engineered
  onto the antigen sequence so that the expressed gene product is exported out of
  the cell, and thereby enters the exogenous antigen-processing pathway, as shown
  in , priming CD4+ T cells and their soluble products. b | In vaccination with a
  protein antigen, the soluble protein and an adjuvant enter the exogenous antigen-processing
  pathway, which chiefly primes CD4+ T cells. These cells perform helper and regulatory
  functions by releasing various soluble products, which arm phagocytes, balance the
  unrestrained vigor of the immune response, and help B cells produce antibody. c
  | A live attenuated vaccine can enter antigen-presenting cells, especially dendritic
  cells, by multiple routes. The vaccine primes CD4+ T cells through the exogenous
  antigen-processing pathway pathway and CD8+ T cells through cross presentation.
  This engages multiple arms of the immune response, including multiple T-cell subsets
  and their accompanying products, and B cells and antibody production. GM-CSF, granulocyte–macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor; IFN, interferon; MHC, major histocompatibility complex;
  TCR, T-cell receptor; TGF, transforming growth factor; TNF, tumour necrosis factor;
