caption: Neurosteroid biosynthetic pathways and potential sites of modulation by midazolam.
  The upper panel shows blockade sites of PK11195 and finasteride in the neurosteroid
  biosynthesis pathway in the brain. The prototype endogenous neurosteroids allopregnanolone
  (3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnane-20-one), androstanediol (5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol), and
  allotetrahydrodeoxy-corticosterone (THDOC) are synthesized from cholesterol and
  steroid hormone precursors. Activation TSPO by appropriate ligands (e.g., benzodiazepines)
  facilitates the intramitochondrial flux of cholesterol and thereby increases the
  availability of cholesterol to the cytochrome P450SCC, an enzyme located in the
  inner mitochondrial membrane that catalyzes cholesterol side-chain cleavage to yield
  pregnenolone. Pregnenolone is the first key intermediate for neurosteroid biosynthesis.
  PK11195 inhibits the TSPO transport protein, prohibiting cholesterol from entering
  the mitochondrial membrane. The steroids progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, and
  testosterone are further reduced into neurosteroids by the common 5α-reductase enzymatic
  pathway. Finasteride blocks the 5α-reductase, thereby preventing the synthesis of
  neurosteroids allopregnanolone, androstanediol, and THDOC. The bottom panel shows
  the potential GABAA receptor mechanisms for midazolam. Midazolam binds to the benzodiazepine
  site located on the γ-containing synaptic GABAA receptors. The extent of the drug
  to increase the rate of δ-extrasynaptic GABAA receptor opening remains unclear.
  3α-HSOR, 3α-hydroxysteroid-oxidoreductase; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
