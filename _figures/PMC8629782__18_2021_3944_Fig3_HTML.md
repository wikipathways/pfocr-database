  cell types. Top left: BV2 microglia cells (modified from [, ]).TLQP-21 mediates
  P38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (P38/MAPK) pathway through Complement C3a Receptor
  1(C3aR1) causing an increase in phagocytic activity leading to increased fibrillar
  amyloid β (fAβ) uptake leading to lysosomal degradation. Top right: adipocytes (modified

  Regulated Kinase (ERK) activation of Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL). Bottom left:
  Spinal cord microglia (modified from []). TLQP-21 mediates through C3aR1 an increase
