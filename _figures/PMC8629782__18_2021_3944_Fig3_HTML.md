caption: 'TLQP-21 mediates intracellular signaling via C3aR1 activation in different
  cell types. Top left: BV2 microglia cells (modified from [, ]).TLQP-21 mediates
  P38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (P38/MAPK) pathway through Complement C3a Receptor
  1(C3aR1) causing an increase in phagocytic activity leading to increased fibrillar
  amyloid β (fAβ) uptake leading to lysosomal degradation. Top right: adipocytes (modified
  from [, , ]). TLQP-21 mediates β Adrenergic Receptor (β-AR)-induced lipolysis in
  a C3aR1-mediated fashion by intracellular calcium mobilization and MAPK/Extracellular
  Regulated Kinase (ERK) activation of Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL). Bottom left:
  Spinal cord microglia (modified from []). TLQP-21 mediates through C3aR1 an increase
  in calcium transients in spinal cord microglia as well as an increase in cytokine
  release and IL-1β release in a pronociceptive manner as well as for spinal neuroplasticity
  following nerve injury. Bottom right: primary microglia (modified from []. TLQP-21
  mediates in a C3aR1-dependent pathway, an activation of membrane currents, Ca2 + responses
