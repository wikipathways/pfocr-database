caption: Functional role of the novel phosphorylation site serine 811 (S811).The amino
  (N)-terminal domain of NCC contains several key phosphorylation sites (T55/T66)
  that are essential for NCC activity and plasma membrane abundance. S811 acts as
  a dominant regulatory site for phosphorylation of T60 and T55 in NCCSV and NCC3.
  The various interactions of the NCC regulatory pathway are shown as green arrows
  (stimulatory) or red lines (inhibitory). Phosphorylation is indicated with the symbol
  P. The with no lysine kinases (WNKs) are capable of activating SPAK (STE20/SPS1-related,
  proline alanine-rich kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress responsive protein type
  1). The hormone receptors are located in the basolateral membrane with indicated
  signaling pathways involving either serum glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1)-Nedd4-2
  pathway, protein kinase A/C (PKA/PKC), or WNKs. V2R, vasopressin receptor; AT1R,
  angiotensin receptor 1; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor.
