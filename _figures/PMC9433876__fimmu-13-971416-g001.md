caption: Overview of the Hippo-YAP pathway. The core components of the Hippo-YAP pathway
  contain kinases mammalian Ste20-like kinases 1/2 (MST1/2) and Large tumor suppressor
  homolog 1/2 (LATS1/2), their cofactors Salvador (SAV) and scaffolding proteins MOB
  domain kinase activator 1A/B (MOB1A/B), the transcription co-activators Yes-associated
  protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and
  the TEAD1–TEAD4 family of transcription factors. When the Hippo-YAP pathway is at
  the “ON” status (red), phosphorylated MST1/2 activates the phosphorylation of LATS1/2,
  which in turn phosphorylate and promote the degradation of the YAP and TAZ. When
  the Hippo-YAP pathway in at the “OFF” status (green), YAP/TAZ are dephosphorylated
  and accumulate in the nucleus, where they bind with TEADs to induce gene transcription.
  Various upstream mediators, such as adhesion proteins, mechanotransduction, and
  other signaling pathways, directly or indirectly to regulate the activity of YAP.
  For relationship among signalings, arrow represents positive regulation and transverse
  line represents negative regulation. AMOT, angiomotin; GPCR, G protein–coupled receptors;
  KIBRA, kidney and brain protein; NF2, neurofibromin 2; RASSF1A, ras association
  domain-containing protein 1A; VGL, vestigial like family.
