caption: Regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in terpenoid biosynthesis, phenolic biosynthesis,
  and alkaloid biosynthesis in medicinal plants. A large number of miRNAs participate
  in secondary metabolite synthesis by cleaving or repressing target mRNA. The modulating
  role of miRNA redirects secondary metabolites in plant cells for a specific biosynthetic
  pathway, thereby enhancing the production of therapeutic plant metabolites. The
  graph summarizes the current knowledge and understanding of miRNA and its role in
  the regulation, biosynthesis, and accumulation of secondary metabolites in plants,
  including alkaloids, terpenoids, and flavonoids. AACT, acetoacetyl CoA thiolase;
