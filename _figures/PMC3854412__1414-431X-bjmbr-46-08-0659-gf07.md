caption: '. Schematic illustration of the effect of OAβ on the NF-κB/SIRT1 pathway
  in cells and the role of OAβ in the chronic inflammation of AMD in tissue. A, Aβ
  induces NF-κB signaling via inhibition of SIRT1. 1: Binding of Aβ to an extracellular
  receptor, such as TLR4, leads to phosphorylation of IKK complex subunits (NEMO,
  IKKα and IKKβ), which subsequently phosphorylate IκBα and lead to its proteosomal
  degradation. This then releases NF-κB into the nucleus. 2: Newly liberated NF-κB
  can be acetylated for full-transcriptional activation. However, the acetylated NF-κB
  can also be deacetylated by SIRT1. This action of SIRT1 promotes IκBα binding and
  nuclear export of the deacetylated NF-κB complex, which terminates the NF-κB response
  and replenishes the cytoplasmic pool of latent NF-κB/IκBα complexes. B, Aβ-induced
  expression of IL-8, IL-6 and MMP-9 contributes to chronic inflammation in age-related
  macular degeneration. Figure adapted from Refs. 11,33,38.'
