caption: Signaling molecules and pathways regulating ferroptosis and gemcitabine resistance
  in cancer cells. Ferroptosis is a form of cell death driven by iron accumulation
  and lipid peroxidation. The acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4)-lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3)-arachidonate lipoxygenases (ALOXs) pathway enzymatically
  mediates oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the plasma membrane
  to phospholipid hydroperoxide (PLOOH), ultimately leading to ferroptosis. Nuclear
  receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) induces ferritinophagy to increase intracellular
  iron, promoting non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation and inducing ferroptosis. However,
  glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibits lipid peroxidation together with glutathione
  (GSH), which prevents ferroptosis. Intracellular levels of GSH are maintained by
  the system X c − (solute carrier family 7 member 11, SLC7A11 and solute carrier
  family 3 member 2, SLC3A2), which accepts extracellular cystine for GSH synthesis.
  In addition, apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondrial 2 (AIFM2) maintains a reduced
  state of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10H2) to prevent lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Therefore,
  upregulation of SLC7A11, GSH, GPX4, and AIFM2 expression renders cancer cells resistant
  to ferroptosis. Gemcitabine can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
  via nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)-p22-phox-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  oxidase (NOX) pathway in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells to induce
  ferroptosis. Activation of nuclear erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) decreases ROS
  and suppresses ferroptosis.
