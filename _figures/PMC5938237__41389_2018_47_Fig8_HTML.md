caption: Mechanistic scheme is drawn to depict the functional interaction between
  GRHL2 and TGF-β signaling through Erk and JNK MAP kinase signaling. The current
  study identified an alternative pathway by which GRHL2 regulates TGF-β signaling
  through activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathways. This pathway is distinct
  from the transcriptional regulation of the target genes, e.g., E-cadherin, hTERT,
  p63, and miR-200 family genes, by direct GRHL2 binding at the promoter regions
