caption: 'Tentative Model Explaining Redirection of Metabolism in the Absence of MDH2
  during Photoautotrophic N Deprivation.FA degradation starts with hydrolysis of TAGs
  and membrane lipids by lipases. FAs released enter the peroxisomes via an ABC transporter
  and subsequently are degraded to acetyl-CoAs by the core FA β-oxidation spiral,
  which consists of four enzymatic activities (ACX, MFP-hydratase, MFP-DH, and KAT).
  MDH2 plays a role in oxidation of NADH, which is generated by hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  (MFP-DH) at the third step of β-oxidation spiral. In the absence of MDH2, NADH is
  likely accumulated, thereby increasing the reduction state of peroxisome. This would
  result in two metabolic changes in peroxisome: a decrease in malate export and an
  increase in H2O2 level. These two metabolites would in turn significantly alter
  photosynthesis and chloroplast metabolism. Activated pathways in the mutant are
  indicated by blue arrows, whereas downregulated pathways are indicated by red arrows.
  Based on results obtained from this study and current literature, we propose a cascade
  of events leading to the observed phenotypes in mdh2 mutants: “High oil” phenotype
  (events 1, 2, and 5): A block in FA β-oxidation combined with increased de novo
  FA synthesis contributes to higher TAG accumulation. “High starch” phenotype (events
  2 to 4): During N starvation, the more active CO2 fixation and photosynthesis in
  the mdh2-1 mutant provides more NADPH and carbon precursors for starch synthesis.
  The increased level of NADPH in chloroplast activates AGPase for starch synthesis
  and also activates several starch-degrading enzymes; therefore, it results in an
  increased carbon flux into and out of the starch route. Higher amounts of starch
  indicate high sink capacity, therefore sustaining photosynthesis. As a consequence,
  more NADPH is produced by photochemical reactions, and this further activates AGPase,
  together resulting in the 100 to 300% increase in starch content. “High H2O2” phenotype
  (event 3): The higher level of H2O2 in the mutant is supported by the 2-fold increase
  in the H2O2-generating reaction catalyzed by ACX activity. Once it is transmitted
  to chloroplast, H2O2 activates the starch synthesis pathway, as supported further
  by the observation of starch overaccumulation in wild-type cells supplemented with
  exogenous H2O2. “Sustained photosynthesis” (events 1 and 2): A blockage in FA β-oxidation
  at the step of MDH2 will result in less malate being produced in the peroxisome.
  Malate, a recognized electron carrier, can be transported to other compartments
  via the dicarboxylate transporter. When malate level is high, less NADP+ is available
  as electron acceptor at PSI, therefore downregulating photosynthesis. Conversely,
  in the absence of MDH2, the malate level is decreased, and more NADP+ is available
  to accept electrons from PSI. ACX, acyl-CoA oxidase; CAT, catalase; CBC, Calvin-Benson-Bassham
