caption: Simplified diagrams of putative signaling pathways responsible for the different
  migration patterns (i.e. directionally persistent vs. random) of control DK-MG (A)
  and SNB19 (B) cells, as well as for the cell line-specific effect of the PI3K/mTOR
  inhibitor PI-103 on cell migration (C) and (D). In contrast to DK-MG cells, the
  PTEN-mutated SNB19 cells express constitutively activated PI3K- and ERK-pathways
  which favor migration and invasion of these cells. Besides this, the protein p53
  is mutated in SNB19 cells, which might also influence their migration phenotype,
  e.g. increased expression of RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1/2/3. Incubation of SNB19 cells
  with PI-103 for 24 h (D) leads to a rebound activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway,
  most likely due to inhibition of the negative feedback loop mediated by ribosomal
  protein S6, resulting in mostly unaltered motility. In contrast, in PI-103-treated
  DK-MG cells, which lost their motility, the expression of p-AKT remained almost
  undetectable. The diagram is based on the data presented in Figures – and  and ,
  and also includes data published elsewhere [, , , ]. Non-determined proteins are
  marked with dashed lines. The symbols ↑ and ↓ denote, respectively, increased and
  decreased protein expression levels compared to corresponding control cells (A,
  B), as detected by Western blot analysis shown in Figure . (For detail, see the
  Discussion section.)
