caption: It is well-known that ethanol metabolism mainly by ALD and CYP2E1 enzymes
  increases oxidative stress (OS) which is considered the primary mechanism of liver
  injury during ALD progression []. (A) Image shows basal status of OS, FLII, NXN,
  MYD88, and FLII/NXN/MYD88 complex in unexposed cells to ethanol effects. (B) Upon
  chronic ethanol exposition, OS levels increase and oxidize NXN disrupting FLII/NXN/MYD88
  complex, and increasing FLII levels and secretion into the blood circulation. The
  complex might be differentially disrupted and MYD88 might increase its interaction
  with TLR4. Additionally, LPS administration partially reverts the effects of ethanol
  but NXN overexpression modifies the response of FLII/NXN/MYD88 complex to ethanol
  and/or LPS effects in vitro. The reversal effect of LPS might be due to the development
  of hepatic tolerance to neutralize the hyperactivation of TLR4/MYD88 signaling pathway.
