caption: 'COVID-19: lung injury comprises epithelial, vascular, and fibrotic effects.
  Abbreviations: ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; AFOP, acute fibrinous and
  organizing pneumonia; DAD, diffuse alveolar damage; IFN, interferon; NET, neutrophil
  extracellular traps; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TMPRSS2, transmembrane serine
  protease 2; TNF-α, tumor-necrosis factor-alpha; →, leading to/resulting in. Explanatory
  notes: SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell through the ACE2 receptor after the activation
  of the spike domain by TMPRSS2 [, ]. Lung injury by COVID-19 has epithelial, vascular,
  and fibrotic effects []. Pulmonary alveoli are lined with type I and II epithelial
  cells surrounded by capillaries to promote gas exchange. SARS-CoV-2-induced alveolar
  damage → build-up of debris and fluid inside the alveolus (affects gas exchange
  associated with pro-inflammatory responses, increases vascular permeability, and
  induces fibrosis with collagen deposition and thrombosis) []. SARS-CoV-2 directly
  infects alveolar type I and II epithelial cells → loss of epithelial layer and occurrence
  of DAD (stimulated by the innate immune response). Alveolar capillary damage → fluid
  accumulation (capillary leak and intra-alveolar hemorrhage). DAD: exudative → hyaline
  membranes of serum proteins and condensed fibrin [, ], interstitial and alveolar
  edema, capillary congestion and microthrombi, inflammatory cell infiltrates, scattered
  fibroblasts, thickening of the alveolar septa, denudation of the alveolar epithelium,
  and type II hyperplasia within a few days of infection; organizing → proliferation
  of fibroblasts in septa and alveolar spaces to begin tissue repair through the organization
  of edema, the disappearance of hyaline membranes, atypia of pneumocytes, thromboembolic
  in capillaries and pulmonary vessels; fibrotic → stage in approximately 3 to 4 weeks
  []. Intra-alveolar hemorrhage is also observed in COVID-19 patients. The alveolar
  space can be infiltrated by inflammatory cells, neutrophils, megakaryocytes, macrophages,
  and other components that damage its function []. Monocytes recruited into the alveolar
  space secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce the apoptosis of pneumocytes
  through the release of IFN through a pathway dependent on TNF-α activating cell
  death receptors. Macrophages release chemokines and other cytokines → increased
  permeability and the recruitment of neutrophils. Excessive neutrophil degranulation
  leads to damage and breakage of the alveolar-capillary barrier []. AFOP → formation
  of fibrin balls in the alveolar space blocks airflow into the alveoli, formation
  of hyaline membrane, and thickening of the septa for gas exchange and can also contribute
  to fibrosis. Loss of type I and II epithelial cells contributes to the flooding
  of alveoli with blood, edema, or cellular debris due to lost or impaired ion channels;
  this further degrades epithelial cells and the surfactant layer (reduced area of
  gas exchange). In response, the surrounding alveoli increase in volume, and the
  forces on the alveolar walls increase leading to increased stress surrounding the
  foci of injury, leading to further damage. With the progress of lung injury, more
  alveoli are damaged which leads to decreased lung compliance. Indeed, alveolar collapse,
  surfactant dysfunction, intra-alveolar edema, lung inflammation, and focal fibrotic
  remodeling are all lung stress concentrators that cause further injury progression.
  Microthrombi were found in autopsies of COVID-19 patients with observed deposition
  of fibrin within the capillaries. Neutrophils also contribute to capillary damage
  through NETs, which promote vascular occlusion due to the high neutrophil content
  of clots in capillaries of the alveolar septa. Platelet, fibrinogen, and neutrophil
  microthrombi and NET formation associated with immunothrombosis were observed in
  COVID-19 patients’ lungs when compared with non-COVID-19 controls. Neutrophils generate
  excessive ROS, which induces further lung damage []'
