  lines: steps catalyzed by enzymes reported in KEGG database. Red lines: enzymes
  found by proteomics or transcriptomics analyses with inferred function. Pink lines:
  enzymes previously reported. Dotted black lines: enzymes not found in genome database.
  Abbreviations in blue: compounds up taken from the medium. Abbreviations in green:
  phospholipids not yet identified. PE biosynthesis: ethanolamine is phosphorylated
  by ethanolamine kinases (1) and activated by ethanolamine phosphate cytidyl-transferase
  (2). CDP-ethanolamine is transferred to diacylglycerol by ethanolamine phosphotransferase
  (3) to produce PC and PE. PE, methylated by phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase
  (4), produce PC. SM, catabolized by sphingomyelinases (SMA) (5), produce phosphocholine,
  which follows the Kennedy pathway. PS is synthesized from PE by PS synthase 2 (6).
  PI(4)P and PI(3)P are produced from IP by the action of type III EhPI(4)K and EhPI3K
  respectively (7). PI(3,5)P2 is generated from PI(3)P by the action of EhPIPKIII
  (8). PI(4,5)P2 is produced from PI(4)P by EhPIPKI (9). EhPI3KC1 (10) produces PI(3,4,5)P3
  from PI(4,5)P2. Enzymes involved in the production of PG were not detected in E.
  histolytica genome. PL, AT, and TA enzymes (11) produce LBPA from PG. Cardiolipin
  is produced from PG or PE by synthase CMP-forming (12) and phospholipase D respectively
  (13). In sphingolipid metabolism, the enzymes involved are SPT (14), Cer S and its
  orthologs LAG family proteins (15) are involved in the production of ceramides,
  which can be transformed in complex SL by SL synthase (16). ASM participate in the
  ceramide''s synthesis by the hydrolysis SM (17). Enzymes involved in fatty acid
  synthesis pathway were not detected in amoeba genome. Four putative enzymes that
  participate in the fatty acid elongation cycle: 3-ketoacyl-CoA (18), very-long-chain
  3-oxoacyl CoA reductase (19), very-long-chain-3-hydroxyl-CoA dehydratase (20), and
  very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase (21). AcetylCoA, Acetyl coenzyme A; PA, Phosphatidic
