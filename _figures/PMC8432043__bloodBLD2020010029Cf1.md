caption: The CLL microenvironment. The main types of accessory cells in the CLL microenvironment
  are depicted surrounding the CLL B cell, which is located at the center. CLL cells
  enter the lymphoid tissue through HEVs (depicted on the right), which also may elaborate
  chemokines, such as CCL21 and CCL19, which bind CCR7 and can attract CLL cells.
  HEVs also produce hyaluronic acid (HA), which can activate CD44 on the CLL cell,
  as it attaches to HEVs via l-selectin (CD62-L) to egress from the blood (CD62-L).
  In the bottom left corner is a nurse-like cell (NLC), a lymphoma-associated macrophage
  (LAM) that secretes a number of chemokines, such as CXCL12 or CXCL13, which bind
  to CXCR4 or CXCR5, respectively, on the CLL cell, attracting it to the microenvironment.
  The leukemia cell in turn can elaborate chemokines, such as CCL3 and CCL4, which
  bind to CCR1 and CCR3 (CCR1/3), or CCL17 and CCL22, which bind CCR4, to recruit
  T cells (depicted in the bottom right) and monocytes, which are the cells that can
  differentiate into NLCs. Cognate interactions between CD31 and CD38 on NLCs and
  CLL cells, respectively, may promote CLL-cell survival. The NLC also expresses proteins
  of the TNF family, such as BAFF (CD257) and a proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL
  or CD256), which in turn activate TNF-family receptors such as transmembrane activator
  and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand (CAML) interactor (TACI or CD267),
  B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA or CD269), or BAFF-receptor (BAFF-R or CD268) on
  the CLL cell, inducing activation of nuclear factor κ-light chain B (NF-κB). NLCs
  and stromal cells (depicted on top) also can produce factors that stimulate the
  CLL cell, such as various Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) factors, with
  interact with Frizzled (Frz) receptors, or noncanonical Wnt factors, such as Wnt5a,
  which can bind and activate ROR1 on the CLL cell. Wnt5a also can activate NF-κB
  via ROR1 signaling, which induces production of cytokines, such as IL-6, which can
  stimulate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the CLL
  cell or NLCs. NLCs and stromal cells may elaborate Hedgehog (Hh) factors, which
  interact with surface Pitch 1 (Ptch1) and Ptch2, blocking their capacity to inhibit
  Smoothened (Smo), allowing for activation of the Hedgehog-signaling pathway in the
  CLL cell. Cognate interactions between surface cell adhesion molecules, such as
  vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1 or CD106) on the stromal cell, with CLL
  integrins, such as very late antigen (VLA), enhances CLL cell survival. Self- or
  environmental antigen (depicted at the bottom of the figure) that is recognized
  by the sIg expressed by the CLL cell can lead to activation of the BCR signaling
  pathway. Cognate interactions between the CLL cell and the T cell in the microenvironment
  also can involve other TNF-family factors, such as CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154),
  which enhance expression of chemokines and cytokines, such as IL-4, that further
  influence the cellular composition of the microenvironment Collectively, the crosstalk
  between the CLL cell and the accessory cells within this microenvironment provides
  the perfect niche to foster leukemia-cell proliferation, forming the so-called proliferation
  centers within lymphoid tissues of patients with CLL. Adapted from Kipps and Choi
