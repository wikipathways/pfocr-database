caption: A model depicting how flavonoid metabolites may exert its chemo-preventive
  effects on colonic tissue to protect against CRC. We suggest that 2,4,6-THBA generated
  by auto-degradation of flavonoids or those through the action of microflora is taken
  up by the colonic epithelial cells through SLC5A8. Since SLC5A8 is expressed only
  in the apical surface (and not in the basolateral surface) [], 2,4,6-THBA may accumulate
  to pharmacologically relevant concentrations within cells, sufficient to inhibit
  CDKs. This would lead to a reduced rate of cell proliferation through 2 distinct
  mechanisms—one by direct inhibition of CDKs by 2,4,6-THBA and the other through
  the upregulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, possibly through an indirect pathway. The
  reduced rate of proliferation will provide an opportunity for DNA repair to occur
  or destruction of cancer cells through immune surveillance. The metabolites such
  as 3,4-DHBA and 3,4,5-THBA that are generated from flavonoids may also contribute
  to chemo-prevention by targeting extracellular proteins.
