caption: Regulation of p21CIP1 contrasts ERK1/2 function in the opposing contexts
  of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling, i.e., proliferation versus growth arrest. To promote cell
  proliferation, ERK2 phosphorylates Thr57 and Ser130 of p21CIP1, which induces p21CIP1
  ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In contrast, to promote growth
  arrest, ERK1/2 upregulates p21CIP1 levels in cells for which ERK1/2 has non-kinase
  effects. These mechanisms highlight different mode of ERK1/2 signaling for the opposing
  physiological outputs.
