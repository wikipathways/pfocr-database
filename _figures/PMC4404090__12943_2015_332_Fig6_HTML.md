caption: A Model of PinX1 suppresses MMP-9 expression via NF-κB signaling pathway.
  We speculate that PinX1 can suppress the expression of MMP-9 owing to the inhibition
  of transcriptional activity of NF-κB p65 proteins by direct protein-protein interaction
  with its G-patch domain which could combine with the C-terminus of the NF-κB-repression
  factor (NRF).
