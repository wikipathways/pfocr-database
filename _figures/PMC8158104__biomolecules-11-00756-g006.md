caption: Scheme illustrating the links between sugar metabolism/signaling and glycosylation
  and the trade-off between growth and stress responses. The figure illustrates the
  effect of sugar metabolism and signaling during unstressed conditions and stressed
  conditions in terms of sugar availability. Under non-stressed conditions, photosynthesis
  provides sugars to be used in metabolism and directly in glycosylation reactions.
  Sugar availability stimulates Target of Rapamycin (TOR), promoting growth and development
  and inhibiting stress responses. Sugar availability can also directly influence
  glycosylation by serving as the substrates, for instance through O-GlcNAc transferases
  (OGTs). Invertases (INVs) are key components, specifically in sink tissue, to convert
  sucrose to metabolizable hexoses. Under these conditions, Snf1-related protein kinase
  1 (SnRK1) is inhibited by trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P). When exposed to severe stresses,
  photosynthesis is hampered, resulting in sugar deprivation, reflected through T6P
  levels (mirror sucrose levels). Low T6P results in an active SnRK1, inhibiting growth
  and possibly also glycosylation by regulating OGTs as is the case in animals. Active
  SnRK1 also promotes stress responses. It is important to note that mild abiotic
  stresses result in temporal leaf sweetening which can also potentially stimulate
  SnRK1 and/or stress responses. During sugar deprivation, TOR is typically inactive.
  Apart from sugar signaling pathways, limited sugar availability can also directly
  hamper glycosylation due to limited substrate availability and low energy levels.
  It is unclear whether a sugar sensor exists that translates sugar availability to
  glycosylation reactions in plants; however, candidates include OGTs themselves or
  SnRK1, since this appears to be the case in animals. In animals, AMP-activate protein
  kinase (AMPK), the homolog of SnRK1, and OGTs co-regulate one another to alter their
  activities and localization. It is important to note that glycosylation will never
  be completely inhibited even under severe stresses, as a low level of glycosylation
  is also important during these conditions. Arrows with arrow heads indicate stimulatory
  effects whereas arrows with blunt ends indicate inhibitory effects. Solid lines
  are known effects and dashed lines predicted effects. Grey arrows indicate an inactive
  pathway under a specific condition. This figure was created with BioRender.com.
