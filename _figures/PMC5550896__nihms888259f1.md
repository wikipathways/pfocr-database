caption: TGF-β family member signaling and its target in CRC. Members of the TGF-β
  family are commonly mutated in CRCs. Various ligands bind to specific cell surface
  receptor systems to affect downstream SMAD and non-SMAD signaling. Pathway members
  commonly mutated in CRC are in green, members affected in other GI cancers are in
  purple, and members that have been found altered in both are striped. As depicted
  in this simplified cartoon, there is frequent cross-regulation among upstream and
  downstream pathway members that are context dependent.
