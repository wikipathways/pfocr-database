caption: 'Probable mechanisms through which royal jelly (RJ) and its components extend
  lifespan. RJ reduces insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS), which
  heightens the activity of DAF-16—the C. elegans counterpart to the mammalian Forkhead
  Box O transcription factor (FOXO). Activation of DAF-16/FOXO promotes its translocation
  from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and fosters interactions with its associated transcriptional
  co-regulator proteins: host cell factor (HCF-1), sirtuin homologue (SIR-2.1), and
  FTT-2 (a 14-3-3 protein). This results in formation of protein complex inside cells
  and enhancement of the expression of multiple longevity promoting genes as well
  as regulation of downstream process of dietary restriction signaling (which lowers
  food-intake) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by extending
  the lifespan of the control unc-24/+ mutants. The interplay among several genes
  involved in IIS, mTOR, and dietary restriction signaling boosts key longevity-related
  cellular processes: DNA repair, autophagy, antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory
  activity, stress resistance, and cell proliferation. On the other hand, RJ activates
  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling mainly by activating its receptor
  (LET-23). EGFR functions via downstream phospholipase C-γplc-3 and inositol-3-phosphate
  receptor itr-1 to upregulate elongation factors and chaperonins, which increase
  protein translation and proteasome activity—a mechanism that entails rebuilding
  cellular components; enhancement of cellular detoxification, ribosomal function,
  and muscle maintenance; and reduction of lipofuscin levels (age-pigments that accumulate
  during senescence).'
