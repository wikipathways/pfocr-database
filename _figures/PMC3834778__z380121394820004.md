caption: Shear stress reveals the mechanisms by which OA induces PICs and MMPs in
  human chondrocytes. At the early stage of OA, shear stress mediates the development
  and progression of OA by inducing the expression of IL-6 and MMP-9 in human chondrocytes.
  Involvement of COX-2 and its derived PGE2 is implicated in the production of IL-6
  and MMP-9, which is mediated by PI3-K-, ERK1/2-, PKA- and JNK-activated NF-κB pathways.
  In contrast, the apoptotic mechanism shows its effect on the physiopathology of
  OA at the late stage. Plk1 and Plk3 play pivotal roles in mediating chondrocytic
  apoptosis via a p53-dependent pathway.
