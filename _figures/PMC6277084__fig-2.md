caption: The NAD+ metabolome. l-TRYP, NA, NAM, NMN, NR, and NAR can be used as precursors
  for NAD+synthesis. (A) l-TRYP is catabolized to N-formylkynurenine (N-f-KYN) by
  IDO or TDO. (B) N-f-KYN is catabolized by arylformidase to form KYN. (C) KATs catabolize
  KYN to form KA. (D) Kynurenine 3-hydroxylase uses KYN as a substrate to form 3-HK.
  (E) Kynureninase then forms 3-HAA, which is converted to 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate
  semialdehyde (not shown) by (F) 3-HAAO. (G) This product is then converted to picolinic
  acid by picolinic acid carboxylase. (H) Alternatively, the semialdehyde undergoes
  spontaneous condensation and rearrangement to form QUIN, which forms NAMN by (I)
  QPRT. (U) NAMN undergoes adenylylation by NMNAT1-3 to form NAAD, which forms NAD+
  by (M) glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetases. NA is used by the Preiss–Handler pathway.
  (L) NAMN is formed by NAPRT following addition of 5-phosphoribose group from PRPP
  to NA. (P) NAMPT forms NMN by addition of phosphoribose moiety to NAM. (U) NMN is
  then converted to NAD+via the catalytic activity of NMNAT1-3. (N) NAM is also produced
  as a by-product of NAD-dependent enzymes, for example, PARPs, sirtuins, and CD38.
  (O) NAM can also be converted to NA by bacterial nicotinamidases. (J) NR is phosphorylated
  to form NMN by NRK1/NRK2, which is then subsequently converted to NAD+ by NMNAT1-3.
  (J) NAR can also be used to form NAMN by NRK1/NRK2 or (K) NA by purine nucleoside
  phosphorylase. (Q) NAM is methylated NNMT to MeNAM and modulates the efficiency
  of NAD-dependent biological processes. (T) NAD+ can be reduced to form NADH. (R)
  NAD+ can also undergo phosphorylation to NADP+(S) and then further reduction to
  NADPH. 3-HAA, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid; 3-HAAO, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase;
