caption: Schematic overview of the complement system activation. Complement system
  can be commonly activated through three pathways, the classical pathway, the Lectin
  pathway, and the alternative pathway (AP). Importantly, the AP can be initiated
  spontaneously by the “C3 tick-over”, which keeps AP idling and has the ability of
  fast-response through an amplification loop. These three pathways converge at C3
  and produce C3 convertase and C5 convertase, which cleave C3 and C5, thereby generating
  C3a and C5a, important potent pro-inflammatory molecules. The activation of C5 eventually
  activates the downstream C6, C7, C8 and C9 to form the MAC. MBL, mannose-binding
  lectin; MASP, mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease; MAC, membrane attack
  complex; ASP, acylation stimulating protein; B, factor B; D, factor D; H, factor
  H; P, properdin.
