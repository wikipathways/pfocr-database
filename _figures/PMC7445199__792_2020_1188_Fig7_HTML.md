caption: Energy and co-factor balance of heterologous ectoine and hydroxyectoine biosynthesis
  in E. coli. The diagram shows the main intermediates of the ectoine and hydroxyectoine
  formation from glycerol and glucose, respectively, as well as co-factors used and
  generated on route. The reactions of the heterologous biosynthetic pathway are indicated
  by a blue box. Ectoine biosynthesis needs one molecule of L aspartate-βsemialdehyde
  and acetyl-CoA. In the best-case scenario, oxaloacetate is directly supplied by
  carboxylation of PEP, while acetyl-CoA is generated from a second PEP. Theoretically,
  one molecule of glucose or two molecules of glycerol could be sufficient for the
  generation of one molecule of ectoine. If, however, oxaloacetate is replenished
  via the glyoxylate cycle, three rather than two molecules of glycerol would be required.
  In the case of hydroxyectoine production the consumption of α-ketoglutarate leads
  to a shortcut of the citrate cycle, resulting in the loss of 1 NADH and 1 GTP for
  every turn of the cycle. ASA L-aspartate-βsemialdehyde, CoA Coenzyme A, GAP glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate, PEP phosphoenolpyruvate
