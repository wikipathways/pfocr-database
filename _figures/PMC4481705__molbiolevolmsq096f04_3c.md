caption: Predicted biosynthetic pathways of archaeal wyosine derivatives. Acronym
  names for wyosine derivatives (boxed) and for enzymes (not boxed) are defined in  and
  also in text. Wyosine derivatives that are unique to the archaeal domain are in
  gray background. Symbols (colored circles, squares, and triangles) are defined in
  . Green squares with a FMN inside correspond to the flavodoxin domain that is needed
  to allow Tyw1 to catalyze the formation of imG-14. In Archaea, this domain apparently
  must act in trans and is yet to be identified. Symbol ‘?’ means that the enzyme
  has not been characterized. A black arrows means that the enzyme certainly catalyzes
  the reaction (when dashed the quantities of the product detected were small). A
  dashed red arrow corresponds to a predicted but not experimentally validated reaction.
