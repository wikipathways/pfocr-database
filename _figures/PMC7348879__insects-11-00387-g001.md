caption: 'The insect immune system. Insect innate immunity is based on the recognition
  of non-self by cellular and soluble host receptors; the recognition of foreign molecules
  (PAMPs) by host receptors (PRRs) initiates a synergistic network of cellular and
  humoral effector responses aimed at neutralizing the non-self. As in vertebrates,
  the innate immune response in insects can be triggered systemically (hemocoel, left)
  and locally, as in the gut (right). Unlike systemic innate immunity, where the Toll
  and Imd pathways are essential, the immune response in the gut mucous membrane epithelium
  depends on the Imd pathway and on the DUOX pathway. SBPs: sugar-binding proteins;
  PGRPs: peptidoglycan receptor proteins; LBPs: lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins;
  GBPs: glucan-binding proteins; proPO: prophenoloxidase-phenoloxidase; AMPs: antimicrobial
  peptides; ROS: reactive oxygen species; DUOX: dual oxidase.'
