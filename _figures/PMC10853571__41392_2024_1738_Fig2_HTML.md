caption: Schematic illustration of the pharmacological mechanism of fluoxetine in
  astrocytes. Acute treatment with fluoxetine at low concentrations (green arrows)
  stimulates Src, which phosphorylates EGF receptors by activating 5-HT2B receptors
  (5-HT2BR) and activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. AKT phosphorylation induced
  by fluoxetine at low concentrations inhibits the expression of cFos and subsequently
  decreases the expression of caveolin-1 expression (chronic effects), which in turn
  decreases the membrane content of PTEN, induces phosphorylation and stimulation
  of PI3K and increases the phosphorylation of GSK3β, thus suppressing its activity.
  At higher concentrations, fluoxetine (red arrows) stimulates metalloproteinases
  (MMP) by activating 5-HT2BR and induces the release of growth factors, which stimulates
  EGF receptors and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/ERK1/2
  signaling pathway. ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by fluoxetine at high concentrations
  stimulates the expression of cFos and subsequently increases the expression of caveolin-1
  (chronic effects), which inhibits PTEN/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β,60 ultimately leading to MDD
  like behavior. At high concentration, fluoxetine can also stimulate the activation
  of cPLA2a by the transactivation of EGFR/MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, and the activated
  ERK1/2 can also increases the expression of cPLA2a at chronic treatments.61 In addition,
  the increased expression of cFos induced by fluoxetine can further increases the
  RNA editing of GluK2 by increasing the expression of ADAR2 at the chronic treatments,
  the function of the edited GluK2 by fluoxetine is down-regulated, which causes the
  acute glutamated induced Ca2+-dependent ERK phosphorylation is suppressed.63 Adobe
