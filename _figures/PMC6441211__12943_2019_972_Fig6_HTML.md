caption: Schematic figure for present study. Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-induced
  interleukin-6 (IL-6) activates the Jak1-STAT3 pathway in gastric cancer cells via
  paracrine signaling, which allows tumor cells to increasingly oppose apoptosis and
  increase their survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Tocilizumab, a humanized
  monoclonal anti-IL-6R antibody that is an FDA-approved drug, inhibits the CAF-induced
  activation of the Jak1-STAT3 signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells and consequently
  increases the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs
