caption: Regulation of the erythroid-related-nuclear-factor-2 (NRF2) pathway mediated
  by physical exercise. (A) Under basal conditions, cytosolic NRF2 is maintained at
  low levels by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. (B) Electrophilic stress
  and NRF2 phosphorylation can induce NRF2 nuclear translocation and further interaction
  of the transcription factor with the antioxidant-responsive element (ARE). The interaction
  with ARE mediates the transcriptional activation of many genes encoding phase II
  drug-metabolizing and antioxidant enzymes, or proteins that will enhance mitochondrial
  activity and number, and promote an anti-inflammatory status. (C) Signaling pathways
  activated by physical exercise. The regular practice of physical exercise positively
  regulates NRF2 nuclear translocation, the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)
  and epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation. DNA methylation could be
  the result of an interplay among methionine, folate and BH4 pathways. Folate is
  transformed into tetrahydrofolate (THF) by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR),
  the same enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dihydrobiopterin (BH2) into BH4
  in the BH4 biosynthetic pathway. THF is transformed to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
  (5-MTF) by MTHFR and converted back to THF by methionine synthase (MS), allowing
  the methylation of homocysteine to methionine. The latter is then transformed into
  S-adenoslymethionine (SAM), which can donate a methyl group for DNA methylation,
  leading to the formation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and methylated DNA. The
  enzymes involved in DNA methylation are DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which transfer
  the methyl group from SAM to DNA, leading to methylation of the promoter region
  of KEAP1 gene, decreasing its expression and favoring NRF2 translocation. In addition,
  the hypermethylation of the promoter region of the ASC gene and NFkB, which encode
  proteins involved in promoting an anti-inflammatory status, will promote an anti-inflammatory
  environment.
