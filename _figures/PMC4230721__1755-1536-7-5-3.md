caption: Compounds used as anti-fibrotic therapies in other organs and their mode
  of action. The blue boxes represent a major profibrotic pathway. Compounds are depicted
  in red, indicating their mechanism of action. Abs, antibodies; ALK, activin receptor-like
  kinase; AT, angiotensin; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; ECM, extracellular
  matrix; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A; Inh, Inhibitor; IL, interleukin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR,
  mammalian target of rapamycin; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor;
  SMAD, small mothers against decapentaplegic; TGF, transforming growth factor.
