caption: a The reconstructed metabolic pathway of Methylophaga aminisulidivorans SZUA-1124.
  The expression levels of individual protein-encoding gene/genes were calculated
  and labeled accordingly in RPKM. The left square represents the average RPKM value
  from all Cayman Shallow plume metatranscriptomes, and the right square represents
  that from all Cayman Shallow background metatranscriptomes. The square and arrow
  colors correspond to different RPKM value ranges. The protein details of labeled
  IDs refer to Supplementary Dataset S8. b The presence/absence matrix of functions
  in closely related Methylophaga genomes. The function IDs are the same as those
  in Panel (a). The detailed annotations of these close related Methylophaga genomes
  refer to Supplementary Dataset S8.
