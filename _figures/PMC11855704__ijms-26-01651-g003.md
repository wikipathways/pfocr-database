caption: 'The Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the pathogenesis of obesity. Photo Note: The
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a normative pathway in Wnt signaling, and the activation/inhibition
  of the Wnt signaling pathway leads to different roles in the pathogenesis of obesity
  [26], which is determined by specific action pathways. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  is thought to inhibit adipogenesis and the development of obesity. Wnt/β-catenin
  can inhibit the expression of adipocyte-related genes (including PPARγ and fatty
  acid synthase) and inhibit adipogenesis [27]. But Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays
  a complex role in different fat pools, different diets, and different stages of
  fat production. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway also affects insulin action and systemic
  glucose homeostasis. Promoting this signaling helps regulate energy homeostasis.
  After activation of the Wnt protein, beta-catenin is released and enters the nucleus
  as a transcriptional co-activator of T-cell factor (TCF) to regulate the transcription
  of target genes. Note: ↑ indicates an increase in content, and ↓ indicates a decrease
