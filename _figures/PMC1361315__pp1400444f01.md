caption: Proposed diagram of the photorespiratory nitrogen cycle involving respiratory
  Glu metabolism with release of ammonium and 2-oxoglutarate between three subcellular
  compartments. Ammonium can be produced during photorespiration and oxidative deamination
  of Glu by GDH and assimilated by the action of the GS-GOGAT pathway. The stoichiometry
  of the cycle is not included. GDC, Gly decarboxylase multienzyme complex (EC 1.4.4.2/2.1.2.10);
  GGAT, Glu:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.4); SHMT, Ser hydroxymethyltransferase
  (EC 2.1.2.1); SGAT, Ser:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.45); CH2-THF, N5,N10-methylene
  tetrahydrofolate; G3P, glycerate-3-P; OH-pyruvate, hydroxypyruvate; RuBP, ribulose
  1,5-bisphoshate.
