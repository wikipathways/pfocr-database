caption: Pathway Studio Analysis of Proteomic Content of TFMPs at 6 Months in the
  Infarcted Groups Compared With Control Group Profile(A) Heat shock proteins (HSPs)
  associated with post-ischemic conditioning detected in CRT+BB–treated animals only.
  Metoprolol administration enhanced levels of HSPA1A. (B) Factors related to cardiac
  function improvement were detected in treated animals 6 months after infarction,
  but no such observation made in the infarcted, untreated animals.

  description: Pathway Studio Analysis of Proteomic Content of TFMPs at 6 Months in
    the Infarcted Groups Compared With Control Group Profile(A) Heat shock proteins
    (HSPs) associated with post-ischemic conditioning detected in CRT+BB–treated animals
    only. Metoprolol administration enhanced levels of HSPA1A. (B) Factors related
    to cardiac function improvement were detected in treated animals 6 months after
    infarction, but no such observation made in the infarcted, untreated animals.
