caption: Dopamine-glutamate circuitry underlying CS-induced reinstatement of drug
  seeking. VTA dopamine (DA) input into the NAcore mediates CS-induced reinstatement.
  DA input into the PFC may also modulate rapid, transient glutamatergic plasticity
  in the NAcore in response to drug-associated CSs and mediates drug seeking behavior.
  DA input into the BLA may alter excitatory inputs into the NAcore and reciprocal
  BLA-PFC signaling. As well, DA input into the vHPC has been implicated in CS-induced
  reinstatement of drug seeking, and glutamatergic projections from the vHPC to the
  VTA may be an indirect pathway through which the HPC modulates dopaminergic input
  into other brain regions.
