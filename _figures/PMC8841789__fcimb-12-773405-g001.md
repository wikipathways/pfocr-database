caption: Achieving a manually refined metabolic network for K. pneumoniae Kp13, Kp13-GEM.
  In (A) the main steps involved in the curation process of Kp13-GEM are shown, initially
  by an automatic generation of a draft network model using Pathway Tools. This model
  is subjected to a first annotation stage, where pathway holes and candidates are
  manually evaluated using the Pathway Hole Filler algorithm, followed by a second
  stage of curation where all pathways are evaluated. Panel (B) shows Kp13-GEM represented
  as a reaction graph. Nodes represent reactions, which are linked if a product in
  a given reaction is used by another as a substrate. The size of the nodes is proportional
  to their betweenness centrality. The red nodes are choke-points. The metabolic routes
  for Kdo transfer to lipid IVA and 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation to succinyl-CoA,
  top ranked pathways in and, respectively, are detailed in the boxes next to the
  reaction graph.
