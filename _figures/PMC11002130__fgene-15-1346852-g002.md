caption: A comprehensive eight-step protocol for MAPK-related tsRNA screening. The
  screening process for MAPK-related tsRNAs comprises eight distinct steps. Initially,
  total RNA is extracted from tissues, cells, and exosomes in both diseased and normal
  groups. Subsequently, this extracted RNA is reverse-transcribed into cDNA. In the
  third step, the cDNA is submitted to a sequencing platform, where qualified reads
  are meticulously selected. In the fourth step, these processed reads are meticulously
  aligned to the genome and cross-referenced with the genomic tRNA database to identify
  tsRNAs. Moving on to the fifth step, a differential analysis of tsRNAs is conducted
  to pinpoint differentially expressed tsRNAs (DEtsRNAs). In the sixth step, predictions
  are made regarding the protein-coding genes (PCGs) downstream of DEtsRNAs, employing
  tools like TargetScan, RNAhybrid, miRanda, and other relevant websites. In the seventh
  step, the downstream genes of DEtsRNAs are subjected to KEGG analysis to elucidate
  the pathways to which they are linked. Finally, this comprehensive approach leads
  to the identification of MAPK-associated DEtsRNAs within the MAPK signaling pathway.
  To clarify, in this context, abbreviations such as tsRNAs (tRNA-derived small RNAs),
  MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases), ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase),
  JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), p38 (38 kDa protein), UTR (untranslated region),
  tsRNA, and cDNA (complementary DNA) represent key components of the methodology
