caption: Common miRNA putative target genes and GO/Pathway enrichment analysis. The
  network analysis of DEMs between target genes (A), pathway (B), and biological process
  (C) of GC tumorigenesis with ClueGO software. The red and yellow nodes represent
  the biological pathway. The nodes of the light blue colors around represent the
  genes and miRNAs involved in modules and the lines represent the interaction between
  two nodes. The more forward ranking is represented by a redder color. GO, gene ontology;
  DEMs, differentially expressed miRNAs; GC, gastric cancer.
