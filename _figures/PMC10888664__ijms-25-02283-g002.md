caption: Evolution of CRC. The evolution of CRC involves two pathways. Firstly, the
  adenoma-carcinoma pathway, characterized by the accumulation of mutations in the
  WNT, MAPK, PI3K, TGFβ, and p53 signaling pathways, leading to a sequential progression
  from adenoma to carcinoma. On the other hand, there is the serrated pathway, featuring
  specific mutations in the KRAS or BRAF genes, resulting in hyperactivation of the
  MAPK signaling pathway [21,24]. The stages of CRC are determined by the extent of
  the tumor and the presence of metastases. The TNM staging system assesses cancer,
  focusing on Tumor (T), which describes the depth of primary tumor growth into the
  intestinal lining (ranging from T0 to T4b, indicating invasion of other organs or
  structures). The evaluation of Lymph Nodes (N) and Metastases (M) is combined with
  T to assign a stage to the cancer, ranging from 0 to IV [12]. Images were created
