caption: Network of NO and low oxygen interactions in a developmental stage-based
  context. Somatic embryogenesis, seed germination, RAM, and SAM. (A) The SAM displays
  a state of physiological hypoxia which prevents N-degron pathway activation, that
  is also influenced by low NO levels. VRN2 contributes to vernalization and hypoxia
  tolerance, while ZPR2 sustains leaf production in the SAM. (B) SE is generally favored
  by mild hypoxia, and oxidative stress-inducing compounds promote dedifferentiation
  by increasing endogenous auxin levels. NO stimulates the activation of cell division
  and embryogenic cell formation in some systems. Mutation of PGB2 increases the number
  of somatic embryos by suppressing the expression of MYC2 and induces the transcription
  of several IAA biosynthetic genes promoting SE. (C) NO is necessary for completion
  of germination; NO binds to ABI5, through Cys S-nitrosation of Cys153, and promotes
  the interaction with CULLIN4-based and KEEP ON GOING E3 ligases and consequently
  its degradation by the proteasome. ABI5 is modulated by NO and O2 through the N-degron
  pathway. Members of the ERFVII group have been identified as ABI5 transcriptional
  activators. (D) NO is necessary for normal RAM organization; however, high levels
  of NO reduce PIN1-dependent auxin transport, reducing RAM activity. NO influences
  meristem size and promotes PR root growth by preventing N-degron pathway activation.
  (E) NO donor treatments promote lateral root growth in a dose-dependent manner,
  NO could be promoting RAP2.12 degradation and thus reducing LRP stabilization and
  inhibiting LR density. Arrows and bars indicate positive and inhibitory effects,
  respectively. Dotted arrows and bars indicate putative regulations (created with
  BioRender.com). ZPR2 (protein LITTLE ZIPPER 2); VRN2 (VERNALIZATION 2); PGB2 (phytoglobin
  2); MYC2 (basic helix–loop–helix protein 6); IAA (indole-3-acetic acid); ABA (abscisic
  acid); ABI5 (ABA INSENSITIVE 5); ERFVII (Group VII ethylene response factors); PRT6
  (PROTEOLYSIS 6); PIN1 (PIN-FORMED 1); SAM (shoot apical meristem); SE (somatic embryogenesis);
  RAM (root apical meristem); PR (primary root); LR (lateral root).
