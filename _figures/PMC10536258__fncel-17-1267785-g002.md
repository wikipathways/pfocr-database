caption: 'Factors that impact the contractile characteristics of cerebrovascular pericytes.
  (1) Ca2+: the increase in the rate of glycogenolysis decomposition and ATP production
  leads to the increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium ion and subsequent
  pericyte contraction; (2) reactive oxygen species: hypoxia, hyperglycemia, hydrogen
  peroxide, and radiation can result in the increase in intracellular reactive oxygen
  species, through which the concentration of calcium ion is increased and subsequently
  pericytes contract; (3) regulatory factors: endothelin-1 induces contraction by
  acting on its type-A receptor, while CNP can inhibit endothelin-1-induced contraction
  through the GC-B/cGMP signaling pathway; (4) membrane proteins: inhibition of α-smooth
  muscle actin expression could prevent contraction, GPR39 knockout results in pericyte
  contraction; (5) other mediators: SARS virus infection induces pericyte contraction
  by interacting with cell surface membrane proteins. Abbreviated specification: A2AR-A2A

  glucose 1- (dihydrogen phosphate); Glc-6-p: glucose 6- (dihydrogen phosphate); Glc:
