caption: Figure 2. Hypothetical model involving CML9 in flg22-induced plant growth
  inhibition through GA-dependent signaling pathway. (A) Model of plant growth control
  through GA-dependent signaling. Upon GA binding to its soluble receptor (GID1),
  signaling pathway is activated; DELLA proteins are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. The major players of this GA-signaling cascade are the GA receptors (GID1),
  the DELLA repressor proteins and the F-box protein part of the SCF E3 Ubiquitin
  ligase complex. DELLAs are nuclear transcriptional regulators, which interact with
  other transcription factors (i.e. GA-TF, GA-dependent transcription factor) to modulate
  expression of GA-responsive genes. (B) Working model of flg22-induced plant growth
  inhibition that involve GA signaling cascade components and CML9.
