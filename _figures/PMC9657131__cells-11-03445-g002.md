caption: 'Pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegeneration: dopamine depletion (left)
  and loss of proteostasis (right) in damaged midbrain substantia nigra pars compacta
  dopaminergic neurons. Upon dopaminergic neurodegeneration, surviving neurons activate
  compensatory mechanisms to maintain striatal DA concentrations and keep normal motor
  regulation. Such mechanisms include increased dopaminergic metabolism, alterations
  in D2Rs, reduced DAT expression, and an increment in DA diffusion. Nonetheless,
  if neurodegeneration continues, DA depletion translates into a disrupted regulation
  of motor control and, hence, symptoms. Such neurodegeneration is caused, among other
  factors, due to the loss of proteostasis. When misfolded into a β-sheet composition
  due to mutations, pH, or chaperon alterations, α-syn can aggregate. This aggregation
  disrupts the UPP and ALP proteolytic pathways (inhibiting misfolded α-syn degradation);
  stresses the ER activating the UPR; causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which generates
  toxic ROS species that further facilitate α-syn aggregation; alters normal synaptic
  processes (synaptopathy), which in turn causes a DA depletion; and creates fibrils
  that travel through axons (axonopathy) into the cytoplasm, where fibrils sequester
  organelles and proteins to form LBs. Consequently, α-syn misfolding and aggregation
  generate neurotoxicity in dopaminergic neurons, causing the vicious degeneration
  cycle observed in PD. DA: dopamine; D1R: dopamine 1 receptor; D2R: dopamine 2 receptor;
  DAT: dopamine transporter; α-syn: alpha-synuclein; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; UPR:
  unfolded protein response; UPP: ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; ALP: autophagy-lysosomal
  pathway; ROS: reactive oxygen species; PD: Parkinson’s disease. Figure made in BioRender.com.'
