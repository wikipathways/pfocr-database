caption: 'RTKs involvement in the RAS carcinogenic pathway. (A,B): Most RTKs in different
  malignancies have undergone mutational alterations (data was retrieved from cBioPortal
  patient cancer databank). In each pathway, RTKs including other oncodrivers were
  highly mutated and modulated a number of oncogenic mechanisms which promote tumor
  initiation, invasiveness, and tumor burden spread in several cancers.'
