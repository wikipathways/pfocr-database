caption: H2S generation and sulfur metabolism in plant cells.Sulfate uptake occurs
  mainly via root absorption. A variety of sulfate transporters (Sultrs) are responsible
  for transporting sulfate to the cells of aboveground tissues. Once sulfate enters
  the plant cell, it is preferentially assigned to chloroplasts by Sultr3s to participate
  in sulfur metabolism, and excess sulfate is stored in the vacuoles. In chloroplasts,
  sulfate is reduced to sulfite through a two-step reaction catalyzed by ATPS and
  APR with APS as an intermediate. Sulfite is further reduced to sulfide by the six-electron
  reduction of SiR. As a substrate, sulfide (H2S) reacts with OAS to produce cysteine,
  which is the basic amino acid for the synthesis of proteins and polypeptides. This
  reaction occurs in different compartments and is catalyzed by different OAS-TLs
  (OAS-A1/B/C), with different SATs to provide OAS. In the cytoplasm, cysteine is
  transformed into H2S, NH3, and pyruvate via D/L-CDes, which initiates intracellular
  H2S signaling. Excessive sulfide can cause cell poisoning, and two sulfide detoxification
  processes of cells take place mainly in the mitochondria. In addition to the production
  of cysteine, sulfide is also oxidized to slightly toxic sulfite. Similarly, cyanoalanine
  can produce H2S in a reaction catalyzed by CAS. In some special cases, plants can
  assimilate sulfur-containing gas molecules, such as H2S, SO2, and COS, into the
  sulfur metabolic pathway through the stomata. Solid arrow, existing pathway; dotted
