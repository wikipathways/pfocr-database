caption: Cold promotes lipolysis in WAT resulting in the release of free fatty acids
  (FFA) that directly serve as substrates for BAT-mediated thermogenesis or are delivered
  to the liver, where they undergo conversion to acylcarnitines due to an increased
  CPT1 gene expression mediated by HNF4α activation. Liver-derived acylcarnitines
  are an alternative fuel source for BAT-mediated thermogenesis. Cold exposure also
  activates the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis in the liver. Bile acids
  induce changes in the gut microbiome, resulting in production of microbial metabolites
  with thermogenic activity. This figure was created using  BioRender (https://biorender.com/).
