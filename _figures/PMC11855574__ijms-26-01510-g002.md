caption: 'De novo biosynthetic pathway for caffeine. (A) The main biosynthetic pathway
  for caffeine in caffeine-producing plants. (B) The secondary (supplementary) biosynthetic
  pathway of caffeine in plants. SAM: S-adenosylmethionine, a key methyl donor in
  the biosynthesis of various compounds. AMP: Adenosine monophosphate, an intermediate
  in purine metabolism. IMP: Inosine monophosphate, a precursor in the purine biosynthesis
  pathway. XMP: Xanthosine monophosphate, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of xanthine
  derivatives. GMP: Guanosine monophosphate, involved in the synthesis of purine nucleotides'
