caption: Integrin αβ heterodimers shift between a low-affinity bent-closed (inactive)
  conformation and a high-affinity extended-open (active) conformation. Many interactors
  (collectively identified as “the adhesome”) bind the cytoplasmic portion of conformationally
  active integrins; among them, talin (T) and kindlin (K) are the only two β subunit
  adaptor proteins found to be indispensable for integrin activation (upper right
  panel). Integrins sense the biophysical properties of the surrounding microenvironment.
  Stiff substrates promote an increased force transmission and YAP/TAZ translocation
  to the nucleus, whose target genes promote cancer progression. In blood vessels,
  low hemodynamic forces promote the binding of circulating tumor cells to fibronectin
  (FN) secreted by vascular endothelial cells; in this process, αvβ3 integrin/CD44
  first and α5β1 integrin later promote cancer cell arrest. Stiff extracellular matrix
  (ECM) sustains PI3K and FAK signaling (upper left panel). Integrins are constitutively
  endocytosed and recycled back to the cell surface in a short loop (RAB4-dependent)
  or long loop (TGN and RAB11-dependent) or sorted for degradation in lysosomes (Ly).
  The escape of integrins from the degradative pathway sustains their signaling from
  endosomes (EE) and promotes their recycling to the surface (lower left panel). Mutual
  regulation between integrin and growth factor TKR signaling and traffic is crucial
  for cancer development and metastatic dissemination (lower right panel). TKR, tyrosine
  kinase receptor; PGC, post-Golgi carrier.
