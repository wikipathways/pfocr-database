caption: Roles of shati on dopamine uptake – the relationship shati and TNF-α. TNF-α
  increased dopamine uptake via the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)
  signaling pathway in PC12 cells. The increase was antagonized by the anti-TNF-α
  antibody (Ab) and soluble TNF receptor I (sRI), suggesting that TNF-α certainly
  increases dopamine uptake in PC12 cells. Moreover, TNF-α inhibited the methamphetamine-induced
  decrease in dopamine uptake in PC12 cells. Overexpression of shati increased dopamine
  uptake and inhibited the methamphetamine-induced decrease in dopamine uptake in
  PC12 cells by increasing TNF-α expression, since these effects were antagonized
  by anti-TNF-α antibody and soluble TNF receptor I.
