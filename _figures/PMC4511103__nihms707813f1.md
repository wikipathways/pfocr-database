caption: A comparison between the apoptotic pathways in C. elegans, Drosophila and
  mammals reveals conservation and expansion of the apoptotic pathway during evolution.
  A. In C. elegans apoptotic signals regulate the interplay between Egl-1 (BH3-only
  homology) and CED-9 (Bcl-2 family homologue), liberating CED-4 (Apaf-1 homologue)
  to activate CED-3 (caspase-9 homologue) for programmed death of 131 cells. B. In
  Drosophila, many different signaling pathways regulate both the IAP antagonists
  Reaper, Hid, and Grim (RHG) and the apoptosome proteins Ark (Apaf-1 homologue) and
  Dronc (caspase-9 homologue). On the one hand, this causes the ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation of DIAP1 and de-repression of caspases, and on the other hand it enables
  Dronc (caspase-9 homologue) to associate with Ark, creating active apoptosomes and
  activation of the effector caspases DrICE and Dcp1. Both pathways are required for
  efficient caspase activation and are coordinately regulated, in analogy with driving
  a car with “gas” and “brake”. However, removal of the “brakes” is necessary for
  the efficient induction of apoptosis in vivo and often initiates it. The P35 protein
  can specifically inhibit the activity of Dcp-1 and DrICE. C. In mammals, the balance
  between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members is a key factor in
  the commitment to apoptosis by regulating the release of cytochrome c and IAP antagonists
  from mitochondria. Binding of cytochrome c to Apaf-1 promotes apoptosome assembly,
  which recruits and activates caspase-9. IAP antagonists liberate caspases from the
  inhibition of IAPs, most notably XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis), which targets
  both initiator and effector caspases. The XIAP-antagonist ARTS is localized to the
  mitochondrial outer membrane and acts prior to the release of cytochrome c, Smac
  and other proteins released from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space.Homologues
  proteins (by either function or sequence) are similarly illustrated.
