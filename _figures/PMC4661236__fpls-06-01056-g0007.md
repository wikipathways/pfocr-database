caption: Ethylene may regulate morphological and physiological responses to Fe deficiency
  through different signaling pathways in Strategy I species. Ethylene could regulate
  morphological responses through a pathway including CTR1 and EIN2 (in green) and
  physiological responses through a CTR1-EIN2-independent pathway (in red), instead
  using AHPs (phosphotransfer proteins) and ARRs (response regulators; Shakeel et
  al., ). Both pathways could converge through EIN3/EILs activity under certain circumstances,
  since EIN3 and EIL transciption factors have been involved in the regulation of
  both physiological (Lingam et al., ; Yang et al., ) and morphological responses,
  e.g., root hairs (Zhu et al., ) and transfer cells (Andriunas et al., ). For the
  regulation of physiological responses, ethylene may interact with some Fe-related
  repressive signals, probably moving through the phloem (García et al., ; Mendoza-Cózatl
  et al., ; Zhai et al., ). This phloem-Fe, through SKB1, could favor the chromatin
  package, where are located the bHLH38 and bHLH39 genes, thus inhibiting their transcription
  (Fan et al., ). Fe def, Fe deficiency; ET rec, ethylene receptors.
