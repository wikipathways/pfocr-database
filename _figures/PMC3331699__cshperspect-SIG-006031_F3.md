caption: Regulation of muscle glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis by insulin and
  contraction. In resting muscle in the fed state, insulin binding to its receptor
  activates the PI-3-kinase → Akt pathway. Akt phosphorylates the Rab-GAP protein
  TBC1D4 (AS160) attached to GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs), causing its dissociation
  and promoting Rab:GTP-mediated fusion of GSVs with the plasma membrane and increased
  glucose uptake. This causes accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), which activates
  glycogen synthase; the latter is also dephosphorylated and activated following inactivation
  of GSK3 by Akt. Muscle contraction, by contrast, causes increases in ADP and AMP
  levels that activate AMPK. AMPK phosphorylates TBC1D1, causing GSVs to fuse with
  the membrane. In this case, G6P does not accumulate because of the demand for ATP,
  and AMPK also inactivates glycogen synthase. This drives flux from increased glucose
  uptake into ATP production rather than glycogen synthesis.
