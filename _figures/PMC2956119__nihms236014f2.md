caption: 'This figure shows the mechanisms that control FASL-FAS induced apoptosis
  and BIM-dependent ‘BCL-2-regulated’ apoptosis in activated T and B cells during
  shutdown of acute or chronic immune responses.During shutdown of an acute T cell
  immune response (left side, top panel), the reduction in the concentrations of cytokines,
  such as IL-2 and IL-7, leads to a reduction in PI3K and AKT. This causes activation
  of the transcription factor FOXO3A, which promotes transcriptional induction of
  the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein BIM and consequently activation of the ‘BCL-2-regulated’
  apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, reduced antigen concentration leads to diminished
  TCR stimulation and consequently reduced activation of the REL-NF-κB and NF-AT transcription
  factors, which are known to promote expression of pro-survival proteins, such as
  BCL-2 or BCL-XL.As in shutdown of acute T cell immune responses, during shutdown
  of a chronic T cell response (left side, bottom panel) the availability of growth
  factors is also reduced, leading to the activation of BIM and initiation of the
  ‘BCL-2-regulated’ apoptotic pathway as described above. In addition, repeated TCR
  ligation triggers FASL expression on T cells leading to autocrine and/or paracrine
  stimulation of FAS, caspase-8 activation, activation of ‘effector’ caspases and
  consequently apoptosis as shown in .During shutdown of a B cell immune response
  (left side) FAS is induced on B cells and can be activated by FASL presented on
  T helper cells. This leads to B cell apoptosis when CD40 signaling is diminished
  due to reduced expression of CD40L on T helper cells, because this causes a reduction
  in the activity of the REL/NF-κB and NF-AT transcription factors, which normally
  promote expression of pro-survival proteins, such as c-FLIP. In addition, a reduction
  in the concentration of growth factors can lead to BIM up-regulation as described
  above.Abbreviations: γc Receptors: common gamma chain containing cytokine receptors
  (e.g. receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-15); DISC: death inducing signaling complex;

  3-kinases.'
