caption: BR-bodies facilitate the mRNA life cycle. BR-bodies are stimulated by untranslated
  mRNAs causing condensation of RNA degradosomes with mRNA. mRNA acts as a scaffold
  to which RNA degradosomes can self-assemble. The mRNA decay pathway is shown on
  the right, with both the monophosphate stimulated decay pathway and the direct entry
  pathways highlighted. The localization of RppH, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion
  to a 5′-monophosphate containing RNA which enhances the RNase E cleavage rate. Within
  the condensate, mRNA decay is stimulated by high concentrations of the RNA degradosome
  and poorly translated mRNA (top middle). The initial step of mRNA decay is controlled
  by the endoribonuclase RNase E and is stimulated within the BR-body (right). The
  subsequent steps of mRNA performed by RNA degradosomes associated exoribonucleases
  that are also stimulated within the BR-body (right). Upon cleavage of the mRNA down
  into small oligonucleotides by both the endoribonuclase RNase E and RNA degradosome-associated
  exoribonucleases, the multivalent bridging functionality of the mRNA is lost, causing
  a dissolution of the BR-body, releasing short oligo RNA products and RNA degradosomes
  that can reassemble on new mRNAs.
