caption: Reprogramming LD biogenesis from the INM to the ONMModel describes how two
  distinct transcriptional circuits, together with seipin and PA distribution across
  the NE, collectively regulate the balance of nLD/cLD production in response to UFAs
  and nutrients. Inhibition of Ino2/4 by Opi1 stimulates both cLD and nLD formation
  and correlates with high PA levels at the INM and ONM/ER. This pathway globally
  determines whether cells invest into lipid storage or membrane proliferation. In
  contrast, the Mga2-Ole1 circuit preferentially induces cLDs, while nLD biogenesis
  is inhibited, possibly through low PA levels and decreased seipin activity at the
  INM (transparent icon). The reprogramming of LD biogenesis from the INM to the ONM
  may protect the nucleus from UFA-induced lipotoxicity.
