caption: A model for transcriptional activation of antioxidant and aflatoxin biosynthetic
  genes by oxidative stress-related transcription factors. Based on available experimental
  evidence, the model proposes that increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) in fungal cells down-regulate the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. This
  promotes MsnA binding to STRE sites in promoters of antioxidant genes for their
  activation. Simultaneously, ROS up-regulate the stress activated protein kinase/mitogen
  activated protein kinase (SAPK/MAPK) signaling cascades through the multistep phosphorelay
  system. Activation of the SAPK/MAPK cascade promotes AtfB and SrrA binding (SrrA
  recruits AP-1) to corresponding CRE, SRRA, and AP1 sites in promoters of the antioxidant
  genes for their induction. Then MsnA, AtfB, and SrrA bind (SrrA recruits AP-1) to
  corresponding STRE, CRE, SRRA, and AP1 sites in promoters of aflatoxin genes for
  their activation due to excessive levels of ROS. AflR assists in induction of aflatoxin
  biosynthetic genes by binding to AFLR sites in the aflatoxin gene promoters. The
  dotted arrows indicate signal transduction from ROS and the solid lined arrows indicate
  signal transduction pathways. The curved arrows designate entering of transcription
  factors from cytoplasm to nucleus and binding of the transcription factors to the
  corresponding recognition motifs. Undefined yet signal transduction between MsnA
  and SAPK/MAPK module is shown by a question mark. PKA, protein kinase A; MP, multistep
  phosphorelay; SAPK/MAPK, stress activated protein kinase/mitogen activated protein
  kinase.
