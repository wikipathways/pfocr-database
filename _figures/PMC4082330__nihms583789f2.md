caption: Activated signalling cascades can alter the epigenetic landscape directly
  or indirectly by communicating with chromatin regulators. a, Metabolites and nutrient
  availability influence the activity of many enzymes regulating the epigenome, as
  these small molecules are used as cofactors. Forexample, oxygen is required for
  the activity of the JumonjiC (JMJC) family of Lys demethylases. The extent to which
  a hypoxic environment inhibits the various JMJC demethylases is not known. Hypoxia
  can lead to histone acetylation around hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and HIF1β
  target genes via the recruitment of p300. Dietary Met is a precursor of the methyl
  donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is required for DNA, Lys or Arg methylation
  (Me) events, and glucose metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle produces
  α-ketoglutarate, which is also required for JMJC demethylase activity. Glucose metabolism
  through thehexosamine biosynthetic pathway produces uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc), which is used by O-linked β-d-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT)
  to trigger O-GlcNAcylation of enzymes that regulate chromatin modification, histones
  and transcription factors (TFs). Acetyl-CoA that is produced from citrate exiting
  the TCA cycle also provides the donor group for protein acetylation (Ac). b, A simplified
  and generic kinase cascade that collides with chromatin modifying factors in the
  nucleus. Signal-induced post-translational modifications (PTMs) of enzymes (such
  as phosphorylation) may alter enzyme activity in modifying histone or DNA residues.
  Enzyme modification of ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers can also alter their
  effects on nucleosome repositioning, changing the modification landscape or DNA
  accessibility around particular gene promoters or enhancers. Controlling enhancer
  activity or responsiveness to signals through nearby histone tail modifications
  and transcription factor binding site accessibility may be a crucial process in
  cell fate decisions, as enhancer utilization drives tissue-specific gene expression.
  Phosphorylation–dephosphorylation events on histone chaperones can alter their ability
  to deposit histone variants into functionally important genomic areas, such as around
  the transcriptional start sites of genes. Reader proteins may also be direct targets
  of signalling cascades; changing the ability of these proteins to recognize the
  PTMs on chromatin and therefore the recruitment of additional regulators can completely
  switch the biological consequence of a chromatin modification. Another mechanism
  at work is complex nucleation initiated by a signalling event. In this case, one
  or a few proteins are maintained on or nearby their target genes, poised but not
  active, and acting as a ‘placeholder’ for rapid induction. Upon a signalling event,
  the placeholders nucleate the remaining protein complex and a function is executed.
  Due to the rapid nature of this response, complex nucleation may be most prevalent
  during primary response gene (PRG) induction.
