caption: The activities of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5) are regulated by interacting proteins that modulate their RNA-binding
  ability, oligomerization, tripartite motif-containing 25 (TRIM25)-mediated K63-linked
  ubiquitylation or subcellular localization. Furthermore, several cellular long non-coding
  RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate RIG-I-mediated and MDA5-mediated
  innate immune signalling. Conceptually, these RNAs promote or diminish RIG-I-like
  receptor (RLR) signalling by regulating the gene expression of these sensors or
  regulatory proteins in the RLR pathway, or they modulate the activity of RLRs or
  TRIM25 through a direct physical interaction. CARD, caspase activation and recruitment
