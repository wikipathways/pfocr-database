caption: Relationship between GLI1 and YAP1 and the proposed model for physalin A-induced
  CSC death. (A) Scatter-plot of GLI1 and YAP1 expression in breast cancer patients
  (based on publicly available TCGA data). Spearman’s correlation coefficient and
  p-values are shown in this analysis. (B) The proposed schema suggests that physalin
  A regulates the canonical Hedgehog signaling pathway, induces down-regulation of
  YAP1, and inhibits BCSC. GLI1 also regulates the expression of YAP1. Inhibition
  of GLI1 and YAP1 contributes to the inhibition of BCSC formation.
