caption: Interaction between dietary protein and mechanical loading on skeletal muscle
  cell. Dietary protein increases serum amino acids and IGF-I, which, through transporter
  and receptor localized in the skeletal muscle sarcolemma exert, through a complex
  intracellular pathway, an anabolic effect. Contractile forces resulting from mechanical
  loading also stimulate a complex molecular cascade. These pathways impact on the
  mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTOR), which enhances several translation
  factors (70-kDa ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic elongation factor 2, ribosomal
  protein S6). This simplified illustration schematizes the combined effects of dietary
  proteins, through amino acids and IGF-I, and mechanotransduction-mediated anabolic
  cell signaling on skeletal muscle mass and strength. Adapted from Pasiakos [] (Color
  figure available online.)
