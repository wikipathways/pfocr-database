caption: Coexpression of proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase (PSMC) genes and signal transduction
  pathways in breast cancer tissues. (A) Venn diagram of PSMC family coexpression
  networks in METABRIC breast cancer databases. PSMC genes were analyzed using METABRIC
  databases, and the intersection of coexpressed genes was plotted. (B) To explore
  potential networks regulated by PSMC family genes, we exported coexpressed genes
  and further uploaded them to the MetaCore platform for a pathway analysis. (C) The
  MetaCore pathway analysis of "biological processes" indicated that “Cytoskeleton
  remodeling_Regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization by the kinase effectors
  of Rho GTPases"-related pathways were correlated with breast cancer development.
