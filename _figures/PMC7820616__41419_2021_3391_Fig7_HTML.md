caption: As cancer stem-like cells exhibit constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway
  and are addicted to pro-survival signaling mediated by this pathway, effective inhibition
  of mTOR results in inhibition of Bmi-1 (self-renewal) and AKT activity. The net
  effect of these events is a decrease in the fraction of cancer stem-like cells in
  salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma upon therapeutic inhibition of mTOR signaling.
