caption: (A) The six outer photoreceptors R1-R6 all express Rh1 and are involved in
  motion detection and image formation in dim light. They surround the rhabdomeres
  of the two inner photoreceptors R7 and R8, which are located on top of each other,
  thus sharing the same optic path. (B) The transcription factor Ss is expressed in
  65% of R7 cells (yellow cells), activating Rh4 and repressing Rh3. Ss inhibits the
  instructive signal from R7 to R8, allowing for the default phosphorylation and activation
  of Wts in R8 and subsequent expression of Rh6 and repression of Rh5. Wts makes up
  one half of a double-negative feedback loop that establishes and maintains R8 subtypes.
  The other half of the loop, Melt, is expressed in R8s downstream of the other 35%
  of R7 cells (pale cells). These pale R7 cells lack Ss expression, allowing for expression
  of Rh3 and instructive signaling to R8 (red arrow). The instructive signal likely
  activates Melt, which represses Wts, allowing for Rh5 expression. (C) TGFβ superfamily
  ligands induce oligomerization of Type I and Type II serine-threonine kinase receptors.
  Binding of the ligand dimer to the Type II receptor initiates its kinase activity,
  phosphorylating residues on the Type I receptor, which becomes activated. Type I
  receptors then phosphorylate members of the receptor regulated (R)-SMAD family of
  transcription factors, allowing them to bind co-SMADs, translocate to the nucleus
  and activate or repress transcription of downstream target genes. (D) The TGFβ pathway
  in Drosophila contains both BMP and Activin subfamilies. The BMP subfamily is composed
  of three ligands, Dpp, Gbb and Scw, two Type I receptors, Tkv and Sax and one R-SMAD,
  Mad. The Activin subfamily also contains three ligands, dActβ, Daw and Myo, but
  only one Type I receptor, Babo and one R-SMAD, dSmad2. Both subfamilies share the
  Type II receptors Punt and Wit as well as the Co-SMAD, Med.
