caption: 'The cell cycle traverses through the G1-S-G2-M phases tightly controlled
  by check points between each phase through a set of regulatory proteins, primarily
  cyclins and kinases. The levels and expression of these regulators ensure the fate
  of the preceding and proceeding phases of the cycle. Cellular destinations, division,
  differentiation, senescence and apoptosis are controlled by a certain restriction
  in the late G1 phase termed the restriction (R) point. It is when cells successfully
  cross this threshold point, that cellular destinations are met. Various genes involved
  in tightly regulating the cell cycle in ovarian cancer. A. Deregulation of the key
  genes (black circle with a star) initiates aberrant proliferation triggering the
  development of neoplasms. Single or multiple pathways may be involved in the process.
  In early stage development there are chances of single gene mutations or epigenetic
  mechanisms that transform the cell into an immortal phenotype. However, when multiple
  pathways are hit or crucial genes such as NF-κB are mutated, far more aggressive
  tumors can develop. Symbols used: open circle, normal cell; open oval, cell towards
  senescence or apoptosis; black jagged star, cancerous cell; black circle with white
  star, mutated gene/pathway; black circle with ‘P’, phosphorylated. B. Gradual stages
  of early to late ovarian tumor development and pathway abnormalities have been highlighted
  in miniature figures below the main one. Symbol used: grey cloud-like structure,
  tumor.'
