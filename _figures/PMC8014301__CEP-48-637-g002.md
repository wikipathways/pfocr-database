caption: Schematic diagram describing the signalling pathways transduced by S1PRs.
  S1P activates the S1PRs, S1PR1‐5, which transmits various intracellular signals
  according to the coupled Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. S1PR1 is coupled
  with Gi/o, while S1PR2 and S1PR3 are coupled with Gi/o, Gq and G12/13; S1PR4 and
  S1PR5 are coupled with Gi/o and G12/13. The signalling through Gi/o is related to
  the activation of Ras/ERK to promote proliferation and survival, improve survival
  rate through PI3K/Akt; through PI3K/Rac promote migration, enhance vascular barrier
  integrity and vasodilation; increase intracellular Ca2+ through PKC or PLC. Signalling
  through Gq mainly activates the PLC pathways. Signalling through G12/13 can promote
  the activation of Rho/Rho kinase, thereby inhibiting migration, reducing the integrity
  of the vascular barrier and inducing vasoconstriction. ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated
  kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; PKC, protein
  kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C
