caption: Tumor necrosis factor-α and its osteoblastogenesis paradoxical effects. (A)
  Under normal condition, various receptors and downstream signaling pathways can
  be activated in osteoblasts. The most common ligands, receptors, and their signal
  transduction are represented in black. Essential pathways involve bone morphogenetic
  proteins (BMPs) and their receptors, acting via SMAD proteins to directly or transcriptionally
  activate RUNX2 and its subsequent downstream cellular events and the Wnt–frizzled
  pathway, which utilizes β-catenin for further activities. Under inflammatory conditions,
  the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 leads to the inhibition
  of osteogenic differentiation via several mechanisms (represented in green in the
  figure). IL-6 inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities by activated
  signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). TNF-α activates SMAD
  ubiquitination regulatory factor-1 (SMURF1) and SMURF2 leading to the inhibition
  of SMADs. The pro-inflammatory cytokines also up-regulate dickkopf-related protein
  1 (DKK-1) and sclerostin (SOST), which inhibit the Wnt–frizzled pathway, whereas
  many other osteoblast gene products are down-regulated. (B) TNF-α can also favor
  osteogenic differentiation via NF-κB by increasing expression of BMP-2, Osx, Runx2,
  OCN, and Wnt pathway. [AP-1, activator protein 1; BMPR, BMP receptor; ERK, extracellular
