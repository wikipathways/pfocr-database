caption: Frequently altered cancer pathways in HCC. Core pathway analysis identified
  frequent genomic alterations in multiple cancer pathways, including (A) Wnt, (B)
  JAK/STAT, (C) G1/S cell cycle, and (D) apoptosis pathways. Alterations include somatic
  mutation, DNA copy number changes correlated with gene expression, and HBV integration.
  Alteration frequency was represented as a percentage of all cases harboring a genomic
  alteration in one of the pathway genes shown. Gene expression up- or down-regulation
  in tumor relative to normal samples is shown but not included in the calculation
  of alteration frequencies. Alteration types and frequencies were represented by
  different colors and color gradients, respectively.
