caption: Summary of major upregulated genes and biological pathways in human neuroblastoma
  SH-SY5Y cells in response to 2B protein of enterovirus-A71 (EV-A71). The EV-A71
  2B protein increases cytosolic calcium (Ca2+). The aberrant level of cytosolic Ca2+
  triggers Ca2+-related signaling pathways participating gene expression, apoptosis,
  inflammatory response, non-canonical NF-κB signal transduction, and long-term potentiation
  of neuron. CCL2, IL32, PLAT, PTGES, and PHLDA1 are associated with neuroinflammation.
  The EV-A71 2B might activate non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway through TNFRSF9,
  BIRC3, and RelB by unidentified mechanism which lead to expression of CCL2.
