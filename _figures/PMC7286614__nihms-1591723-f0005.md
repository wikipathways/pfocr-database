  2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), succinate, and fumarate. IDH1/2 mutants produce the histone
  demethylation inhibitor 2HG from αKG while inactivating SDH and FH mutations generate
  high levels of succinate and fumarate, which are inhibitors of αKG-dependent dioxygenases
  including TET involved in demethylation of methylcytosine in DNA. Green arrows denote
  anaplerotic inputs into the Krebs cycle mediated by pyruvate carboxylase (PCB) ()
