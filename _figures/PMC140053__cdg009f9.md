caption: Fig. 9. Model for the NF-κB activation pathway induced by oxidative stress.
  Oxidative stress induces the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by activating the
  Src–Abl signaling pathway, leading to phosphorylation of PKD at Y463 in the PH domain.
  Oxidative stress also leads to activation of PKCs, which mediate phosphorylation
  of the PKD activation-loop residues S738/742 in the catalytic kinase domain. These
  two events result in a fully-active kinase, which mediates activation of IKKβ and
  degradation of IκBα, leading to the activation of NF-κB. This pathway contributes
  to the survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress.
