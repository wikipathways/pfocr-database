caption: Schematic representation summarizing the functional effects of the three
  regulatory pathways controlled by IL-1β. (A) IL-1β affects dendritic complexity
  through IL1RAPL1-dependent mechanisms. This pathway activates JNK and PTPδ intracellular
  proteins (). (B) IL-1β regulates dendritic spine morphology by upregulating the
  transcription factor MeCP2 in an mTOR-dependent manner (). (C) IL-1β leads to an
  excitatory/inhibitory unbalance by delaying the developmentally regulated switch
  of GABA signaling. This pathway involves the interplay between the two transcription
  factors REST and MeCP2, which in turn regulates the transcriptional level of KCC2
  ().
