caption: Model Depicting Glu, Asp, and Lys at the Core of an Important Regulatory
  Loop in Plant Amino Acid Metabolism.The hypothesized Glu-Asp-Lys metabolic loop
  is presented in the center, linked by orange, yellow, and pink arrows, respectively.
  A different branch of the Asp family pathway (brown arrows) synthesizes Thr and
  Met. The pathway of Lys catabolism produces acetyl-CoA (brown arrow). Two of the
  most important regulators in this loop are the extreme sensitivity of DHPS activity
  to feedback inhibition by Lys and the stimulation of LKR/SDH activity by excess
  Lys levels (light blue arrows) (for discussion, see ; ). Impairment of these two
  important regulatory elements causes extensive conversion of Glu and Asp to Lys,
  thereby activating several other metabolic regulatory circuits. We believe that
  the rapid reduction in Glu, an important regulatory amino acid, triggers increased
  synthesis of Gln and Asn and their conversion to Glu and Asp, respectively (dashed
  gray arrows). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the increased Lys
  level triggers this metabolic change as well (dashed green arrows). In addition,
  the increased Lys level also triggers another novel regulatory circuit, resulting
  in a significant increase in Met level (dashed blue arrow). The significance of
  this novel regulatory circuit is unknown.
