caption: 'Regulation of glycogen metabolism in liver by GLUT2. The insulin-independent
  GLUT2 facilitates glucose transport across the cell membranes. Sodium-glucose cotransporter
  (SGLT) transport activity can be regulated by protein kinases including PKA (protein
  kinase A) and PKC (protein kinase C). PKA activation positively regulates SGLT1
  expression and activity. Increased glucose concentration causes conformational change
  and activation of glucokinase (GK), which phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P) and serves as a substrate for glycogen synthesis or glycolysis. In hepatic
  glycogen metabolism, G6P serves as the central intermediate. During glycolysis,
  utilization of G6P provides energy in the form of pyruvate, NADH and ATP. Acetyl-CoA
  produced from pyruvate, enters the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA).
  During fasting, G6P serves as a substrate for synthesis of glucose during gluconeogenesis
  or glycogenolysis. Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) catalyze glycogenolysis, activated
  by AMP or PKA, and inhibited by insulin. GSK-3β (a serine/threonine kinase) is a
  downstream element of PI3K/AKT pathway, whose activity can be inhibited by protein
  kinase B (PKB)-mediated phosphorylation at Ser9 of GSK-3β. Glycogen synthase (GS)
  is phosphorylated and inactivated by GSK3. SGLT: sodium-glucose cotransporter; G:
  glucose. Green arrows (stimulation); Red arrows (inhibition); Green Sp (phosphorylated
  serine): activating phosphorylation; Red Sp: inhibiting phosphorylation. Dashed
  lines indicate many steps not listed in the gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis pathways
  to glucose.'
