caption: Arachidonic acid can be oxidatively metabolized by both the COX and lipoxygenase
  (LO) pathways, but the COX pathway is the primary focus of this review. COX catalyzes
  two reactions, an initial cyclooxygenase reaction resulting in the insertion of
  two oxygen molecules into arachidonic acid to produce prostaglandin (PG)G2, with
  a subsequent endoperoxidase reaction that reduces PGG2 to PGH2 (). PGH2 is the precursor
  for the prostanoids PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, PGI2, and thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Each of
  the prostanoids is produced by tissue specific enzymes and isomerases that will
  be further discussed later. Two COX enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, are functional in
  humans. A third cyclooxygenase enzyme, COX-3, is encoded by the COX-1 gene, but
  has an intron that is not retained in COX-1 and is not believed to be functional
  in humans. COX-1 and COX-2 are products of separate genes and have different biologic
  functions based on their divergent temporal and tissue-specific expression. The
  human COX-1 gene is present on chromosome 9 and is constitutively expressed in most
  tissues. COX-1 can be induced in specific instances and is thought to participate
  in homeostatic prostanoid synthesis. In contrast, COX-2 expression is usually induced
  and the induction is transient. The human COX-2 gene is located on chromosome 1.
  COX-2 expression is induced by the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, and TNF,
  as well as by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced by Gram-negative bacteria. While
  COX-2 is primarily considered to be an inducible enzyme, it is also constitutively
  expressed in cultured human lung epithelial cells, cortical thick ascending limb
  of the kidney, pancreatic islet cells, and in human gastric carcinoma.– The ability
  of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to inhibit COX-2 activity is likely their
  major therapeutic effect, while the inhibition of COX-1 may result in some of their
  undesired side effects. However, there are instances where inhibition of COX-2 may
  be harmful. For instance, there was an increase in cardiovascular disease resulted
  from medications that specifically inhibited COX-2, likely as a result PGI2, inhibition,
  while the COX-1 product TXA2 was unaffected.
