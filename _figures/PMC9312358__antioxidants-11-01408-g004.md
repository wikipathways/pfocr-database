caption: 'Possible mechanisms of action of antioxidant compounds. (A) Effects on ROS
  production or scavenger systems. Resveratrol (RSV) inhibits NADPH oxidase (NOX)
  and increases paraoxonase (PON) activity. Vitamin D and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C)
  inhibit NOX and increase superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Vitamin B6 is involved
  in glutathione peroxidase (GPX) synthesis. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) regenerates glutathione
  (GSH). Melatonin enhances glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and thioredoxin (Trx), reducing
  ROS. Melatonin and acacetin, through the mitochondrial Sirtuin-3 (SIRT-3) pathway,
  increase SOD scavenger activity. Stevioside enhances both SOD and peroxisomal catalase.
  n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA) enhance SOD activity. (B) Inhibition of
  ROS-activated pathways involved in atherosclerosis. Melatonin can activate the Notch
  homolog 1 (Notch-1) pathway and restore, through hairy and enhancers of split-1
  (HES-1), the Phosphatidyl Inositol 3-Kinase/Protein kinase B/Endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase (PI3K/Akt/eNOS) pathway, which is inhibited by ROS. ROS-induced PI3K/Akt/eNOS
  inhibition decreases NO and vasoprotection. Vitamin D and n3-PUFA, through the activation
  of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), stimulates protein kinase
  B/Endothelial nitric oxide synthase/NO (Akt/eNOS /NO) pathway and NO release. Resveratrol
  (RSV) increases Akt activity, increasing NO and vasoprotection, and through Sirtuin-1(SIRT-1)
  pathway, inhibits ROS-induced nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells (NF-κB) deacetylation, which upregulates the nuclear transcription of vascular
  cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1),
  leading to monocyte adhesion. (C) Inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Melatonin can
  scavenge •OH and lipid peroxyl radicals. Vitamin E can scavenger lipid peroxyl radicals.
  Vitamin C can regenerate preferentially the Vitamin E radical and the ascorbic acid
  radical can be regenerated by GSH. ALA can regenerate both ascorbate and tocopherol
  radicals. n3-PUFA increases PON activity and reduces lipid peroxidation. Abbreviations:
