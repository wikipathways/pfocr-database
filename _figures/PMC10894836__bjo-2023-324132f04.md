caption: The role of miRNAs in Müller cells on retinal regeneration. During retinal
  injury or stimulation, the regenerative miRNA expression profile of Müller cells
  is altered. MiR-200a, miR-200b, miR-143 and miR-145 may be downregulated, causing
  the upregulation of ascl1a, lin28a, E-cadherin, sox2 and zebrafish to promote Müller
  cell regeneration. MiR-28 in Müller cells can target the photoreceptor-specific
  transcription factor CRX, inhibiting Müller cells from transforming into PRCs which
  further differentiate into photoreceptors. MiR-216a is downregulated in Müller cells;
  its target H3K79 methyl transferase Dotl is therefore upregulated in proliferative
  Müller cells and regulates the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway to promote cell reprogramming.
  The expression of let-7 is downregulated in injured retinas, resulting in the upregulation
  of regeneration-related genes such as ascl1a, hspd1, lin-28, oct4, pax6b and c-myc.
  MiR-25 and miR-124 are increased or decreased during injury, respectively, and are
  predicted to inhibit the transcription factors Klf4, Dkk3, Tpm1, Itgb1 and Ctdsp1,
  which regulate the reprogramming of Müller cells mediated by ascl1 through the reporter
  element 1 silencing transcription factor pathway.
