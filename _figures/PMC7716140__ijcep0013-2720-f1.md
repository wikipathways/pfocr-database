caption: 'The figure shows the pharmacological effects of ulinastatin. UTI: ulinastatin;
  LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MyD88: myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88;
  IκB: inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-B kinase;

  TNFR: tumor necrosis factor receptor; Bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma 2; Bax: Bcl-2 associated
  x; Cytc: cytochrome-c; ①. UTI can reduce the release of inflammatory mediators TNF-α
  and IL-6 by inhibiting the protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB, thereby
  attenuating the acute lung injury induced by LPS. ②. For the apoptosis pathway stimulated
  by TNF. UTI can up-regulate Bcl-2 and down-regulate Bax, leading to down-regulation
  of the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, decreased cytochrome c release, decreased caspase3 activation,
  and decreased apoptosis response. ③. UTI can inhibit endogenous proteases (trypsin,
  chymotrypsin, and elastase) and increase neutral protease activity. The activation
  of the neutral protease can significantly enhance collagenase activity and thus
  increase the islet yield. ④. UTI can inhibit the excessive conversion of prothrombin
  into thrombin and reduce thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and P-selectin production
  to regulate blood coagulation function effectively. ⑤. UTI can prevent immunosuppression
  by increasing the ratio of CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocytes, reducing CD8+ lymphocytes’
  rate, thereby increasing the proportion of CD4+/CD8+.'
