caption: Model for aberrant epithelial differentiation and carcinogenesis in DES-induced
  endometrial cancer. During normal endometrial epithelial development, SIX1 is required
  for complete differentiation of CK14+/18+ cells. When Six1+/+ mice are neonatally
  exposed to DES, poorly differentiated CK14+/18+ cells are initiated, serving as
  a pool of progenitor cells that are transformed and promoted to become neoplastic
  by endogenous estrogens over time. However, SIX1 overexpression directs most CK14+/18+
  cells down a differentiation pathway (uniformly SIX1+ basal or luminal cells within
  metaplastic glands), thereby decreasing the pool of CK14+/18+ available to continue
  transformation. This process delays, but does not prevent, the transformation of
  poorly differentiated CK14+/18+ progenitor cells or fully differentiated basal CK14+/18−
  or luminal CK14−/18+ cells that will eventually form a heterogenous tumor morphology.
  In the absence of SIX1 in CO Six1d/d mice, poorly differentiated CK14+/18+ cells
  fail to fully differentiate, leading to glandular dysplasia and/or carcinoma in
  situ. When Six1d/d mice are neonatally exposed to DES, SIX1 is not present to direct
  initiated CK14+/18+ cells to a more differentiated state. As a result, there is
  an increased opportunity for the pool of CK14+/18+ cells to continue down the transformation
  trajectory, leading to decreased cancer latency.
