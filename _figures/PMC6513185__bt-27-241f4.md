caption: Effects of flavonoids on signaling pathway of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  Many flavonoids possess anti-inflammatory activities by interrupting various signaling
  stages of NLRP3 inflammasome pathway both in vitro and in vivo. They inhibit the
  expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related components such as IL-1β, IL-18, NLRP3,
  and caspase-1 and/or block inflammasome assembly which are mediated through signaling
  molecules such as TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3, PPARγ, TXNIP and Syk/Pyk2, etc.
