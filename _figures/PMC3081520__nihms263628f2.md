caption: 'Beclin 1 in complex with class III PI3K and Atg14 acts as a major positive
  regulator of autophagy. The rapamycin-sensitive mTOR/class I PI3K pathway, which
  is sensitive to cellular nutrient status, acts as a negative regulator of autophagy.
  Consequently, rapamycin acts as an activator of the autophagy pathway. Autophagy
  can be inhibited by molecules targeting the class III PI3K, including wortmannin,
  and 3-MA. Wortmannin can also inhibit the class-I PI3K associated with mTOR signaling.
  siRNA strategies targeting autophagic proteins can be used to inhibit autophagy
  at several steps, as indicated on the diagram. Autophagosome–lysosome fusion can
  be inhibited by bafilomycin A1. Lysosomal turnover of LC3B can be inhibited by protease
  inhibitors such as leupeptin.3-MA: 3-methyladenine; LAMP2: Lysosomal-associated
  membrane protein 2; ULK1: Mammalian uncoordinated 51-like protein kinase-1.'
