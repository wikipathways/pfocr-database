caption: 'A simplified cartoon of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. Polymerase (Pol)
  IV and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR2) physically associate and are required
  for the synthesis of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) that are diced by DICER-like 3 (DCL3)
  into 24 nt siRNA duplexes. Upon loading into Argonaute 4 (AGO4), the siRNA-AGO4
  complex finds its target sites by binding to Pol V transcripts and by interacting
  with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the Pol V largest subunit. The cytosine methyltransferase
  DRM2 is ultimately recruited to Pol V-transcribed loci, resulting in de novo cytosine
  methylation in all sequence contexts (CG, CHG and CHH; where H represents a nucleotide
  other than G).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09591.003'
