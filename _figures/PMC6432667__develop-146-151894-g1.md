caption: An overview of the BR signaling pathway. (A) Schematic of the BRI1 signaling
  pathway. In the absence of BR, BIN2 phosphorylates BZR1 and BES1 proteins, inactivating
  them by promoting their binding to 14-3-3 proteins, leading to their cytoplasmic
  retention and degradation. When BRI1 perceives BR molecules, it heterodimerizes
  with BAK1, initiating an intracellular phosphorylation relay cascade that ends with
  the dephosphorylation and consequent activation of BZR1 and BES1. (B-D) Schematics
  of the root tissue-specific expression of BR receptors. BRI1 is expressed throughout
  the root (B), whereas BRL1 (C) and BRL3 (D) exhibit a more discrete expression pattern,
  being active mainly in the root stem cell niche area. Dark green represents high
  expression of the protein, whereas light green represents lower expression.
