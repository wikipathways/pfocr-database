caption: Conceptual overview of potential mechanistic pathway of Aspergillus fumigatus
  recognition through pattern recognition receptors in dendritic cells to upregulate
  IL-10 production and to downregulate allergic hypersensitivity reactions. A. fumigatus
  is recognized to signal through TLR2 and CTLRs (e.g., dectins). The current study
  demonstrates that MALT signaling was dispensable and TLR2/MyD88 was critical to
  lung eosinophilia and T-helper cell type 2 allergy responses. Scavenger receptor
  signaling has been demonstrated to mediate IL-10 responses to complex environmental
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Created in Biorender.com. A. fumigatus =
  Aspergillus fumigatus; CREB = cAMP response element-binding protein; CTLRs = C-type
  lectin receptors; MALT1 = mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation
  protein 1; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKCζ = protein kinase C zeta;
  TLR2 = Toll-like receptor 2.
