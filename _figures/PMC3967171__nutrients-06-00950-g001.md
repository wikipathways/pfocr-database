caption: 'Direct and indirect mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression by
  estrogen. E1, E2, and E3 are the three predominant naturally occurring forms of
  estrogen. 17β-HSD catalyzes the reversible conversion of E1 and E2. Three types
  of estrogen receptors were identified: nuclear receptors ERα and ERβ, as well as
  transmembrane G-protein coupled estrogen receptor ER1 (alias GPER). The classical
  pathway for direct gene transcription is the binding of E2 to ERα and ERβ and activation
  of target genes containing ER response elements (ERE) (Vertical signaling). Activation
  of ER1 by E2 can in turn activate the classical ERα and ERβ pathways through the
  signaling cascade governed by PI3K/AKT protein kinases (Vertical signaling). Alternatively,
  PI3K/AKT triggers activation of other transcription factors (TF) that do not contain
  ERE (Horizontal signaling). 17β-HSD, 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; ERα, estrogen
  receptor alpha; ERβ, estrogen receptor beta; GPER, G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor
  one (alias ER1, GPER or GPR30); P13K, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase
  B; AKT, protein kinase B.'
