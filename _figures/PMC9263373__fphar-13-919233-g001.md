caption: Nrf2 signaling pathway. The relative positions of the Neh domains of transcription
  factor Nrf2 are shown. The Neh2 structural domain containing multiple lysine residues
  at the N terminus is present with a high affinity of ETGE motif and a lower affinity
  of DLG motif. Keap1 is a sparse group-rich protein that inhibits Nrf2. Keap1 degrades
  Nrf2 through polyubiquitination and phosphorylation modification of Nrf2. In the
  organism, Nrf2 is bound to the cytoplasm by Keap1, and only when the cysteine residues
  of Keap1 are modified to cause conformational changes, Nrf2 is released into the
  nucleus and binds to the ARE to promote the expression of the target genes NQO1
  and HO-1.
