  effect autophagy is initiated via the modulation of Wnt/β-catenin axis. The application
  of autophagy inducer, magnolol (Ery5), has an inhibitory effect on migration and
  tube formation properties in both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and apoptotic
  resistant cancer cells while chemical blocking of autophagy by 3-MA or gene silencing
  of Atg7 and LC3 reversed anti-angiogenic effect of autophagy VEGFR-2 levels and

  glycation end products (AGEs) accumulation under diabetic condition. Autophagy plays
  a key role in VEGFR-2 degradation and impaired angiogenesis. Gastrin-releasing peptide
  (GRP) and its receptor GRPR through PI3K-AKT pathway have a pivotal role in cancer-related
  angiogenesis. By antagonizing GRPR, pro-autophagic proteins are overexpressed and
  angiogenesis blocked by autophagy-mediated GRP degradation mechanism
