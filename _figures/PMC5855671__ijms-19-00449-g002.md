caption: Integrins act as “double agents” during Helicobacter pylori infection in
  the stomach, serving to potentiate bacterial pathogenicity while also aiding in
  the immune response. H. pylori bacteria in the gastric lumen bind integrins on gastric
  epithelial cells in order to inject the virulence factor CagA. As shown in the magnified
  view of this process, docking of α5β1 integrin is achieved through integrin affinity
  for the RGD motif of the CagL protein component of the type IV secretion system
  (T4SS). Integrin α5β1-mediated stabilization of the T4SS facilitates the translocation
  of CagA while activating intracellular kinases. Once in the cytosol, CagA is phosphorylated
  by Src family kinases (SFKs) and Abelson (ABL) kinases, which potentiates its virulence.
  Phospho-CagA activates Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) and
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, triggering cytoskeletal remodeling.
  CagA disrupts cell-cell junctions, activates the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway,
  and stimulates cytokine production. Alternatively, CagL docking with αVβ5 integrin
  on gastric G cells activates integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which stimulates epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MAPK activation, inducing gastrin production.
  These mechanisms increase the permeability of the gastric epithelium, which aids
  H. pylori dissemination into the underlying lamina propria. This stimulates an inflammatory
  response causing the release of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 from gastric epithelial
  cells and recruitment of immune cells from the blood stream. As shown in the magnified
  view of the recruitment process, leukocytes first stick to inflamed endothelium
  through selectin binding, which facilitates integrin-mediated tight adhesion. This
  leads to leukocyte extravasation into the lamina propria, where neutrophils and
  macrophages phagocytize bacteria. Phagocytosis is mediated through integrin recognition
  of the opsonization factors LL-37 and complement. Neutrophil extracellular traps
  (NETs) are stimulated through integrin interaction with pathogens.
