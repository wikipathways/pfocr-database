caption: Schematic of NOTCH signaling pathway. NOTCH signaling pathway consists of
  ligands (DLL1, DLL3, DLL4, and JAG1, JAG2), receptor (NOTCH1-4), nuclear effector
  RBPJ, and cofactors. Both NOTCH ligands and receptors are type I transmembrane proteins
  with an extracellular domain consisting of a number of EGF-like repeats modified
  by sugars essential for the ligand-binding specificity. The NOTCH signal is initiated
  when the ligand on the surface of the signaling-sending cell binds the NOTCH receptor
  on the signaling-receiving cell. This ligand–receptor interaction generates a mechanical
  force that causes the conformational change of the NOTCH receptor, leading to subsequently
  proteolytic cleavages mediated by disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing
  protein (ADAM) metalloproteinases and the γ-secretase–presenilin complex. These
  cleavages on the NOTCH receptor release the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD), which
  then translocate into the nucleus and form a transcriptional complex with the DNA-binding
  protein RBPJ. RBPJ forms a complex with corepressors (CoR) and suppresses the transcription
  of target genes when NICD is not in the nucleus. The binding of NICD with RBPJ results
  in the release of CoR, while recruiting the coactivator Mastermind-like protein
  (MAML), leading to the transcription activation of the target genes such as the
  HES and HEY families of basic helix–loop–helix transcriptional repressors.
