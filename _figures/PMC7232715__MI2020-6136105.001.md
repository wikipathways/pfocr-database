caption: Main mechanisms of the organ-protective effects of α2AR agonists. α2ARs are
  classic inhibitory GPCRs (Gi). On the one hand, α2ARs directly inhibit the AC-cAMP-PKA
  pathway through Gαi proteins; on the other hand, the separation of the Gβγ subunit
  from Gαi activates the PI3K/Akt pathway and influences a series of downstream signaling
  including MEK/ERK, HGMB1/TLR4/NF-κB, and IKK/NF-κB. Incidentally, α2AR agonists
  may inhibit JAK/STAT pathways. But when under high concentrations of an agonist
  and high receptor expression, α2ARs may couple both physically and functionally
  to Gs, producing an opposite effect of inhibiting NF-κB.
