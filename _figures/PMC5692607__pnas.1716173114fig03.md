caption: (A) Coincidence detector model for how mTORC1 integrates signals from nutrients
  and growth factors to regulate growth. The Rag GTPases promote the localization
  of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface in response to nutrients, and, at the lysosome,
  the Rheb GTPase activates its kinase activity in response to insulin and energy
  levels. (B) Schematic showing components of the nutrient-sensing pathway upstream
  of mTORC1, including the many multiprotein complexes that regulate the Rag GTPases
  as well as the amino acid sensors Sestrin2, CASTOR1, and SLC38A9, and the SAM sensor
  SAMTOR.
