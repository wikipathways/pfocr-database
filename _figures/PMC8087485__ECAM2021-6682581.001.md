caption: 'The link between gut microbiota and liver disease risk factors.Inflammation,
  EnEth, lipid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and endotoxin levels are the common
  risk factors for liver diseases induced by intestinal microbiotas and their metabolites.
  (a) Inflammation: it is one of the most typical features of liver disease and occurs
  at all stages of disease development. (b) Bile acid metabolism: bile acid is an
  important part of bile, and intestinal floras regulate its metabolism through the
  FXR/TGR5 pathway. (c) Ethanol: in addition to exogenous alcohol intake, intestinal
  flora also can produce a large amount of ethanol (EnEth), affecting intestinal barrier
  and BT. (d) Lipid metabolism: gut microbiota influence on lipid metabolism may be
  mediated through metabolites and LPS. NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; HCC,
  hepatocellular carcinoma; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns; BT, bacteria translocation; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; EnEth, endogenous
  ethanol; ROS, oxidative stress, and reactive oxygen species; SCFAs, short-chain
  fatty acids; TG, triglycerides; FFA, free fatty acids.'
