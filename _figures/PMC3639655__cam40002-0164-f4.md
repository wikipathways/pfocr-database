caption: 'Schematic depiction of c-Myc functional interactions with other pathways
  (for full discussion, see section Induction–Reversion Tumorigenesis in Animal Models
  by Oncogene-Driven Cancer Network Formation). Blue arrows and sticks indicate (tumor)
  growth suppressive, functional interactions, and red tumorigenic interactions. Identifying
  Myc and other oncogene networks, especially in the context of others such as the
  p53 or Ras, in tumor samples using multidimentional analysis  promises to illuminate
  how oncogenes and tumor suppressor proteins are functionally networked in tumor
  cells and, in turn, how these networks determine cell growth autonomy. Key steps
  include determining which oncogenes or associated proteins in complexes and networks
  are important hubs or clusters and if so whether perturbing them is pharmaceutically
  feasible. Note: A pathway is different from a network in that it refers to an experimentally
  determined series of events that lead to a functional outcome as measured by commonly
  accepted methods. In contrast, a network is a grid of interactions between components
  of a system under study and can represent (a) direct structural interactions between
  proteins in a complex or a cluster, (b) functional gene–gene or genetic protein–protein
  interactions (obtained from DNA or protein microarray experiments). Genetic protein–protein
  interactions do not imply direct physical interactions between network-associated
  proteins.'
