caption: 'SPMs, their receptors, signaling and actions in neutrophils. Simplified
  biosynthesis pathway of the SPM families namely lipoxins, maresins, resolvins, and
  protectins with examples of identified receptors. Downstream signaling pathways
  and polyisoprenyl phosphate remodeling in neutrophils upon LXA4-ALX interactions:
  LXA4 acts as a “stop signal” during inflammation to inhibit PLD, PI3K, NFkB among
  others and block PSDP turnover to PSMP. PSDP inhibits PLD and PI3K to further reduce
  pro-inflammatory responses. Red lines represent inhibition, and black arrows represent
  activation of a pathway. PMN, polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Signaling schematic
