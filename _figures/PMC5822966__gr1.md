caption: Molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in magnesium-enhanced bone formation
  and bone fracture healing. Mg2+ releasing from the implant is diffused into the
  periosteal region and transported into the sensory neurons by magnesium transporter
  1 (MAGT1) and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7).
  Elevation of intracellular Mg2+ further leads to increased accumulation and transportation
  of CGRP+ synaptic vesicles in the nerve ending. Higher extracellular CGRP binds
  to CGRP receptor expressed on the surface of periosteum-derived stem cells (PDSCs),
  which activates the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)
  in the nuclei of PDSCs. The activation of CREB specifically targets Osterix, a known
  important transcriptional factor for the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells,
  following with higher osteocalcin (OCN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Through
  connecting these aforementioned signalling pathway elements, PDSCs are promoted
  to differentiate toward osteoblastic lineage, presenting with significantly more
  new bone formation in the periosteal region.
