caption: (A) The Stat pathway. (B) The Smad pathway (C) The NFκB pathway. In unstimulated
  cells (A - C, left panels), transcription factors are either in latent form [Stat
  (A) and Smad (B)] or bound to an inhibitor [NF-κB bound to IκB (C)]. They shuttle
  between the cytoplasm and the nucleus through the nucleoporin complex (NPC) but
  are for the most part unable to bind to promoters and affect gene expression. They
  are also actively transported back to the cytoplasm where they accumulate. Upon
  binding of cytokines to their receptors (A - C Right panels), latent Stats (A) become
  activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, homo-or heterodimerize and get transported
  to the nucleus by importins α/β and the NPC. The R-Smads (B) become serine phosphorylated,
  form dimers with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus via the importins and the
  NPC. The IκBs (C) are activated, ubiquitinated and lyzed and the free NF-κBs enter
  the nucleus where they activate transcription.
