caption: l‐Carnitine and metabolites in the l‐carnitine biosynthetic pathway, as well
  as two essential amino acids, lysine and methionine, necessary for the synthesis
  of l‐carnitine were identified through our modeling approach. The analogs of l‐carnitine
  were proposed as antimetabolites for the treatment of HCC patients and the predicted
  consequence of the use of an l‐carnitine antimetabolite is presented. l‐Carnitine
  antimetabolites may result in reduced β‐oxidation, de novo synthesis of fatty acids,
  and eventually may suppress or kill the growth of the HCC tumor. The abbreviations
  and the detailed explanations for the metabolites as well as the associated genes
  for each reaction are presented in HMR 2.0.
