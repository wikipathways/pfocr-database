caption: Model of TRAF3-dependent regulation of RIG-I signaling pathway by NS1/126-225.
  Following IAV infection, RIG-I recognizes and binds 5′-triphosphate dsRNA to initiate
  host antiviral response. The NS1 protein of IAV inhibits host IFN responses either
  by sequestering viral dsRNA or by binding to RIG-I and TRIM25 or RIPLET proteins
  required for RIG-I activation. In addition, the NS1 C-terminal effector domain (AA126
  to 225, NS1/126-225) associates with TRAF3 to remove the Lys63-polyubiquitin chains
  on TRAF3 and to disrupt the MAVS–TRAF3 complex. NS1/126-225 also increases the recruitment
  of IKKε to MAVS. This releases TRAF3 from the mitochondria, further decreasing the
  level of K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 and impairing IRF3 phosphorylation.
  This results in a decreased level of IFN-β transcription.
