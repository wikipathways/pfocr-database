caption: Mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. A) In melanoma mechanisms of
  secondary resistance to BRAF inhibitors include BRAF splice variants expression,
  CRAF activation (all of which activate MAPK/ERK) or signaling trough alternatives
  pathways AKT/m-TOR etc. (see ) B) In Colorectal cancer, primary resistance to BRAF
  inhibitors is caused by direct activation of EGFR and AKT/m-TOR pathway.
