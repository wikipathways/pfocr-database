caption: Working models for highly complex effector-mediated feedback systems of the
  shikimate and AAA pathways in different tissues of Arabidopsis. Different isoforms
  of plant DHS enzymes are subjected to highly complex effector-mediated feedback
  regulation in a tissue-specific manner. (A) In mature leave tissues, total DHS activity
  is mainly governed by AthDHS1 and AthDHS3 enzymes, which are not directly inhibited
  by AAAs. Chorismate strongly inhibits AthDHS1 and AthDHS3, which is offset by arogenate.
  (B) In young etiolated/de-etiolated seedlings, the AAA-inhibited AthDHS2 isoform
  is dominantly expressed and directly inhibited by Tyr and Trp. Chorismate and arogenate
  also inhibit AthDHS2. In both tissues, Phe has no regulatory effects on plant DHSs
  but caffeate and its derivatives act as strong inhibitors for all AthDHS isoforms,
  likely coordinating the shikimate and Phe phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Blue and
  pink lines represent feedback inhibition of AthDHS1/3 and AthDHS2 enzymes, respectively,
  by the indicated effectors. Gray lines with an arrowhead and hash indicate known
  feedback activation and inhibition, respectively, of AS, CM, TyrA, and ADT enzymes.
  DHS, 3-deoxy-D-arabino- heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase; AS, anthranilate synthase;
  CM, chorismate mutase; TyrA, arogenate dehydrogenase; ADT, arogenate dehydratase;
