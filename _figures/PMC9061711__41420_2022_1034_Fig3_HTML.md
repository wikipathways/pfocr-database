caption: Major ER transmembrane proteins mainly include IRE1, PERK and ATF6. Under
  normal physiological conditions, they are all bound to Bip / GRP78 to form a stable
  complex. Under various acute pathological stimuli such as hypoxia, the reduction
  of ATP, nutrient deficiency, and an increase in ROS, tubular cells often undergo
  ERS. The three ER transmembrane proteins disassociate with Bip to collectively execute
  the UPR. The UPR pathway consists of the adaptive UPR pathway which could maintain
  cell function and the apoptotic pathway which could cause cell death. ER endoplasmic
  reticulum, ERS endoplasmic reticulum stress, IRE1 inositol-requiring protein 1,
  PERK protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase, ATF6 activating transcription factor 6,
  UPR unfolded protein response.
