caption: Hypothetical model of how ceramides could control PD permeability. Sterol
  and sphingolipid biosynthesis begins at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and these
  molecules are subsequently transported to the plasma membrane by the vesicle-mediated
  exocytosis pathway to form lipid rafts, preferentially at plasmodesma (PD) membranes.
  Eventually, PD membranes are enriched by lipid raft formation (A). The excessive
  ceramide in acd5 and erh1 mutant plants enables the salicylic acid (SA)-mediated
  upregulation of PD LOCATED PROTEIN (PDLP) and CALLOSE SYNTHASE1 (CalS1) transcript
  levels to induce plasmodesmata callose (PDC) accumulation (B); SA-mediated PDLP
  and CalS1 activation can also be directly upregulated during infection with a biotrophic
  pathogen such as powdery mildew (B). Blue arrows, trafficking; black arrows, signaling;
  Question mark, not enough evidence that explains how the lipid raft–enriched vesicle
  controls plasmodesmata callose directly.
