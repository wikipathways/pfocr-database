caption: Summary of potential druggable monocyte and T-lymphocyte immune pathway targets
  assessed. Assessment of a panel of druggable immune targets and associated pathways
  typically associated with immunosuppression in sepsis underpinning the commonality
  in the immune response to surgery and sepsis. CD, cluster of differentiation; HLA-DR,
  human leukocyte antigen–DR isotype; LD, live/dead; CCR2, C-C motif chemokine receptor
  2; CXCR4, CXC motif chemokine receptor 4; IL, interleukin; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated
  protein 4; TCR, T-cell receptor, PD-1, programmed cell death protein-1; PD-L1, programmed
  death-ligand 1.
