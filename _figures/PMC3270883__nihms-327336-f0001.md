caption: Expression of human CD81 and OCLN is sufficient for HCV to gain entry into
  mouse cells. These cells allow HCV genome translation, but replication is limited
  (, , ). Long et al. demonstrate that assembly and egress are possible in murine
  cells with sufficient expression of either mouse or human apoE (). ApoE may play
  a role early in HCV assembly via interaction with NS5A (apoE*) (), and/or be later
  incorporated into the virion via VLDL association. Pre-VLDL is formed by co-translational
  lipidation of apoB by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in the rough
  ER. Lipid enrichment and apoE addition (resulting in a mature, lower density VLDL)
  and HCV interaction may take place in the smooth ER (apoE**), or in a post-ER stage,
  as the particle passes through the Golgi (apoE***) (reviewed in (, )). These lipoviral
  particles (LVPs) are then transported along the VLDL secretory pathway as their
  route of egress from the infected cell.
