caption: Anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and immuno-modulatory activities of gemfibrozil
  do not depend on PPAR-α. In one mechanism, gemfibrozil binds and stimulates the
  recruitment of human S μ binding protein-2 (HSµBP-2), glial factor-1 (GF-1), and
  possibly aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) at the drug responsive element (DRE) of
  numerous anti-inflammatory as well as neurotrophic genes. In another pathway, gemfibrozil
  is able to stimulate phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase via an unknown PPAR-α-independent
  mechanism. Once PI-3 kinase is activated, it stimulates the expression of inhibitory
  kappa B-alpha (IκBα) molecule, which in turn binds with functionally active NF-κB
  molecule and arrests the nuclear migration of NF-κB complex.
