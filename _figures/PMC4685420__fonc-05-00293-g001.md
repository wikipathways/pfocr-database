caption: Schematic summarizing some of the genes and pathways known to influence c-Myc
  cap-independent translation in multiple myeloma (MM). Cytokine activation of key
  signaling pathways, or pathway dysregulation, may affect the levels or activity
  of IRES trans-activating factors (ITAFs), including YB1 (conditions of low Akt activity).
  MNK1-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNPA1 and/or RPS25 increases interaction between
  them and might improve ribosome loading on the c-Myc IRES (). Conventional treatments
  for MM usually inhibit CAP-dependent translation but their impact on CAP-independent
  translation is unknown. BMSC, bone marrow stromal cell.
