caption: A proposed scheme for BRCA1 and γ-H2AX-dependent DNA repair in neurons under
  normal conditions and in HD. The phosphorylation status of BRCA1 is imbalanced in
  normal versus HD striatal cells and the BRCA1-dependent spatiotemporal dynamics
  of γ-H2AX is impaired in HD cells. Consequently, BRCA1and γ-H2AX-dependent DNA repair
  pathway is dysfunctional and DNA damage is exacerbated in HD cells.

  and DNA damage responses in Huntington’s disease.
