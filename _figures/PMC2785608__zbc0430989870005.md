caption: A model of complex I mechanism, based on structures described here. Iron-sulfur
  clusters N2 and N6b are depicted as oxidized or reduced by empty or filled circles,
  respectively. C46 and C45 indicate the tandem cysteines from Nqo6 subunit, whereas
  Q/QH2 indicate quinone/quinol. One of possible proton acceptors from C45 is 4Tyr87
  (Y-O) and from C46-6Glu49 (E-O). H-path indicates proton delivery pathway from the
  cytosol to tandem cysteines, such as that shown in supplemental , which may be the
  same for both cysteines (although other pathways are also possible). H1 and 4HB
  indicate helix H1 from Nqo6 and the four-helix bundle from Nqo4, respectively, and
  are shown on dark backgrounds when helices are shifted relative to oxidized state.
  The proposed catalytic cycle is described in detail in the text.
