caption: Involvement of the network of CCR2 and its ligands in regulation of immune
  mechanisms during liver injury, fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis. Sophisticated
  experimental mouse models of liver injury, fibrosis, and HCC revealed the complex
  interplay of different chemokines and liver cells. In the initial phase, upon hepatocyte
  injury, DAMPs activate KCs that in turn secrete inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β),
  which contribute to further hepatocyte injury and release chemokines including,
  CCL2, CCL7, CCL16, and PSMP. CCL2, CCL7, and PSMP promote the recruitment of CCR2+
  circulating monocytes into the injured liver, where they develop into inflammatory,
  angiogenic, and fibrogenic IMs. During chronic injury, these macrophages activate
  HSCs by secreting TGF-β and PDGF to become collagen-producing myofibroblasts responsible
  for excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and deposition, promoting liver
  fibrosis development. In addition, CCL16 directly inhibits the activation of HSCs,
  and PSMP directly promotes the activation of HSCs during liver fibrosis. In the
  HCC tumor microenvironment, TANs and CAFs could recruit TAMs by secreting CCL2 and
  CCL7. TAMs, specifically the M2 phenotype, promoted tumor growth, invasiveness,
  and metastasis by suppressing CD8+ T lymphocyte responses and producing PD-L1, IL-6,
  G-CSF, TNF-α, TGF-β, and VEGF. Additionally, CCL2 could directly promote HCC progression
  through activation of the Hh pathway. CCL7 could directly enhance the mesenchymal
  phenotype of HCC cells and facilitate their migration and invasion through the TGF-β
  signaling pathway. CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast; DAMP, danger-associated molecular
  pattern; ECM, extracellular matrix; G-CSF, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor;
