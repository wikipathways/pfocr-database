caption: 'Mechanisms underlying hnRNPC/XB130-promoted NSCLC progression. In NSCLC
  cells, elevated levels of hnRNPC bind to XB130 mRNA 3’UTR. This interaction performs
  a dual function: first, hnRNPC enhances XB130 mRNA stability by inhibiting the recruitment
  of nucleases XRN1 and DIS3L2. Second, hnRNPC simultaneously interacts with eIF4E,
  a component of the eIF4F complex, thereby facilitating the proximity between the
  5’ and 3’ ends of XB130 mRNA. This spatial arrangement supports the efficient recycling
  of ribosomes, thereby increasing the translation efficiency of XB130 mRNA. Together,
  these mechanisms result in the upregulation of XB130 expression, which subsequently
  activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby promoting cell proliferation and
  EMT in NSCLC'
