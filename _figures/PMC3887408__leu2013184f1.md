caption: Interactions of the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways with
  GSK-3. Some of the regulatory interactions between GSK-3 and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways are indicated. An activated growth factor receptor
  is indicated in blue. Ras and Rheb are indicated in dark blue ovals. IRS1 is indicated
  in an orange oval. Kinases are indicated in green ovals with the exception of GSK-3β,
  which is indicated in a red oval. The p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K is indicated
  in a green oval. The phosphatases that inhibit steps in this pathway are indicated
  in black octagons. The phosphatases PP2A and PP1 that may activate GSK-3 are indicated
  in yellow octagons. NF1, TSC1 and TSC2 are indicated in black squares. PIP2 and
  PIP3 are indicated in yellow ovals. Phosphatases are indicated in black octagons.
  mTOR interacting proteins that positively regulate mTOR activity are indicated in
  yellow ovals. mTOR interacting proteins that negatively regulate mTOR activity are
  indicated in black ovals. Transcription factors activated by either ERK or Akt phosphorylation
  are indicated in yellow diamonds. The FOXO transcription factor that is inactivated
  by Akt phosphorylation is indicated by a black diamond. β-Catenin is indicated in
  an orange oval. mRNA initiation factors and proteins associated with the ribosome
  are indicated in magenta ovals. mTORC1 phosphorylates the ULK1 (unc-51-like kinase
  1) that results in the suppression of autophagy. ULK1 is indicated in a black oval.
  Proteins involved in the regulation of translation are indicated in purple ovals.
  Red arrows indicate activating events in pathways. Black arrows indicate inactivating
  events in pathways. Activating phosphorylation events are depicted in red circles
  with Ps with a black outlined circle. Inactivating phosphorylation events are depicted
  in black circles with Ps with a red outlined circle. This figure is provided to
  give the reader an idea of the complex interactions of GSK-3 with various signaling
  molecules in the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways that are key
  in regulating cellular proliferation survival and often become dysregulated in cancer.
