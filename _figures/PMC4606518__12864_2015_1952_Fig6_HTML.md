caption: Comprehensive panel of the ER stress response in soybean. To enter the ER
  lumen, secretory proteins are translated by ER-associated polysomes, and the nascent
  secretory peptide is co-translationally transported to the ER through the Sec61
  translocation complex (1). In the ER, the pre-assembly oligosaccharide core (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2;
  N-glycan) is transferred (2) from the ER-localized dolichyl pyrophosphate (Dol-PP)
  to the nascent polypeptide by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). Processing or trimming
  of the N-glycan begins in the ER with the sequential removal of the more external
  glucose residues by glucosidase I (3) and glucosidase II (4). The monoglycosylated
  glucan-peptide is targeted to the calnexin/calreticulin system containing the protein
  disulfide isomerase (PDI) accessory protein for proper folding (5). Folded proteins
  are released from this N-glycan-dependent quality control mechanism through hydrolysis
  of the third glucose residue by GluII. Properly folded proteins leave the ER. Unfolded
  proteins may be re-glycosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase
  (UGGT) to re-enter the CNX/CRT-mediated folding cycle (6). The removal of glucose
  residues and transient re-addition of the innermost glucose during protein folding
  contribute to the ER retention time of a given glycoprotein. Failure to achieve
  the proper conformation within a defined period of time is a signal for exclusion
  of the glycoprotein from the CNX/CRT folding cycle by the sequential removal of
  two α1,2-mannose residues by MNS3 and MNS4/MNS5 (7). The removal of these residues
  exposes an α1,6-mannose, which targets the glycoprotein to the ERAD pathway. EBS6
  and EBS5 recruit unfolded glycoproteins to redirect them to the membrane-associated
  ERAD complex for ubiquitination and retrotranslocation to the cytosol, where they
  are targeted to the proteasome (9). Ubiquitinated ERAD substrates are directed from
  the ER to the proteasome via the trimeric complex cdc48/Ufd1/Npl4 (9). ER stress
  induces the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen and activates the UPR
  pathway (10). BiP-mediated dissociation 0of the UPR transducers GmbZIP37/38 (AtbZIP17/28)
  (11) allows for the mobilization of these receptors to the Golgi (14), where they
  are proteolytically cleaved by S1P and S2P (15), releasing the N-terminal bZIP domains
  as functional TFs that are then translocated to the nucleus (15), where they activate
  ER stress-responsive promoters (16). In the other arm of the UPR (12), under ER
  stress, GmIRE1 dimerizes to activate its ribonuclease activity, which promotes unconventional
  splicing of the GmbZIP68 (AtbZIP60) mRNA, generating an active TF (GmbZIP68S) lacking
  the transmembrane segment. GmbZIP68S (AtbZIP60S) moves to the nucleus to induce
  the expression of molecular chaperones, ERAD components, GmbZIP68 (AtbZIP60), GmNAC021
  (AtNAC062) and GmNAC103 (AtNAC089). Evidence indicates that GmbZIP37/38 and GmbZIP68S
  may act in concert as heterodimers to activate ER stress-responsive genes. GmbZIP68S
  (AtbZIP60S) also induces expression of the TF GmNAC020 (AtNAC103) to further amplify
  the ER stress response (19). As a plasma membrane component of the ER stress response
  (17), membrane-tethered GmNAC021 (AtNAC62) also undergoes regulated intramembrane
  proteolysis (RIP) for release into the nucleus as a positive regulator of ER stress-responsive
  genes. If the UPR is not capable of restoring ER homeostasis under prolonged and
  severe stress, then PCD responses are activated for the regulated disposal of abnormal
  cells. ER stress-induced proteolysis of ER membrane-tethered GmNAC103 (AtNAC089)
  exemplifies an ER stress-induced plant-specific PCD response (20). RIP-mediated
  translocation of GmNAC103 to the nucleus allows for the induction of PCD-associated
  gene expression, promoting DNA fragmentation and an increase in caspase-3/7-like
  activity. A distinct ER stress-induced PCD response in soybean integrates an osmotic
  stress signal into a full response (22). The combination of ER stress and osmotic
  stress fully induces the expression of the TF GmERD15 (22) to activate the expression
  of the membrane-associated protein DCD/NRP-B (23). Induction of DCD/NRP-B activates
  a signaling cascade that culminates with the induction of the GmNAC081 and GmNAC030
  TFs (24), which form heterodimers to fully transactivate the vacuolar processing
  enzyme (VPE) promoter (25). VPE exhibits caspase-1-like activity and induces plant-specific
  PCD, mediated by collapse of the vacuole (26)
