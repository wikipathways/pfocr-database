caption: Under normoxic conditions, the ER and mitochondria remain in close contact.
  Small amounts of DRP1 are recruited to mitochondria to maintain the balance of mitochondrial
  fission and fusion. A small proportion of FUNDC1 associates with the ER membrane
  protein calnexin at the sites where ER and mitochondria are tethered. At the early
  stage of hypoxia, FUNDC1 increasingly accumulates at the MAM by interacting with
  calnexin mediated by an unknown intermediate protein. As mitophagy proceeds, FUNDC1
  and calnexin dissociate, and DRP1 is recruited by FUNDC1 to the MAM to initiate
  mitochondrial constriction. Mitochondria are further constricted by self‐assembled
  DRP1 and fragment at the later stage of hypoxia. Meanwhile, the most upstream ATG
  complex (ULK1 complex) phosphorylates FUNDC1 to promote engulfment and clearance
  of damaged mitochondria by the autophagy pathway (Wu et al, ).
