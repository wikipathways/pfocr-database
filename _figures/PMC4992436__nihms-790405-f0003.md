caption: Much of the regulation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway revolves around
  stabilization or degradation of NIK. cIAP1/cIAP2 are the most well-known suppressors
  of NIK activity, forming a complex with TRAF2 and TRAF3, resulting in ubiquitination
  and proteosomal degradation. NLRP12 performs a similar function by binding to NIK
  and enhancing the formation of this complex. HSP70 also downregulates NIK via its
  partner CHIP, and TNAP interacts with NIK, TRAF2, and TRAF3 and inhibits NIK’s kinase
  activity. CYLD negatively regulates non-canonical NF-κB signaling further upstream,
  by ubiquinating TRAF2 and therefore inhibiting CD40 and XEDAR signaling. In terms
  of activators, XEDAR activates non-canonical NF-κB signaling and stimulates NIK
  by binding to TRAF6 and TRAF2. Also at the receptor level, TWEAK/Fn14 binding disassociates
  the ubiquitination complex itself and frees NIK. A20 binds to cIAP1/2 and also prevents
  proper NIK degradation. BCL10 controls the phosphorylation of NIK and promotes its
  activity, while ZPF91 binds directly to NIK to augment function.
