caption: In eukaryotes, proteostasis pathways function in protein quality control
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the cytoplasm and stimulate protein translation,
  translocation, vesicular export and additional chaperone functions to restore proper
  folding and function of proteins. They have been proposed to rescue Plasmodium falciparum
  cells from artemisinin-induced protein alkylation, aggregation and toxicity (or
  proteopathy) and death. There are four major pathways that maintain quality control
  of proteins in the ER and cytoplasm of eukaryotes, as indicated in the figure. In
  the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (I), misfolded proteins are unfolded
  by binding to the ER chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP),
  translocated from the ER to the cytoplasm, ubiquitylated and targeted for proteasomal
  degradation by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway (II). Misfolded proteins in
  the ER are initially removed by ERAD, but when this pathway gets saturated, BiP
  continues to bind to misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. BiP is a key component
  of the reactive oxygen stress complex (ROSC) pathway (III) in the ER lumen, which
  is regulated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). Under equilibrium conditions,
  BiP binds to and keeps inactive transmembrane ER stress-response proteins activating
  cAMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF6), inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1)
  and protein-kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK; which targets eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 2A, eIF2A, to suppress translation). Because BiP has a high preference
  for unfolded proteins, accumulation of these proteins in the ER lumen decreases
  the binding of BiP to transmembrane stress-response proteins, leading to their activation.
  In clinical isolates of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum, increased transcript
  levels of the gene encoding BiP have been detected, possibly indicating a mechanism
  of artemisinin resistance to remove misfolded, aggregated toxic proteins and to
  activate putative transmembrane ER stress-response proteins. Because P. falciparum
  orthologues of PERK and eIF2A exist, activation of PERK might yield a UPR mechanism
  of translational repression and explain why artemisinin-resistant ring parasites
  may temporarily slow down. However, P. falciparum does not encode for orthologues
  of transcription factors of ATF6 and IRE1, which are the main drivers of UPR in
  eukaryotes. Therefore, these major UPR pathways of transcriptional activation of
  redox survival (needed for resistance) have yet to be established in P. falciparum.
  Thus, how the parasite induces the UPR-induced transcriptional increase of ROSC
  and the compensatory global antioxidant responses needed for resistance is unclear.
  Cytoplasmic unfolded and misfolded proteins may also be removed by autophagy (IV),
  including by macroautophagy, which involves phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P)-dependent
  expansion of the ER. However, macroautophagy has not been established in P. falciparum.
  Chaperone-mediated autophagy is a second type of autophagy that also assists in
  the removal of misfolded proteins via interactions with cytoplasmic heat shock protein
  70 (HSC70) and HSC90. T-Complex protein 1 (TCP1) ring complex (TRiC) chaperones
  enable misfolded proteins to become properly folded in the cytoplasm (and hence,
  TRiC substrates do not undergo chaperone-mediated autophagy). Resistant clinical
  isolates have been shown to have increased transcript levels of genes encoding TRiC
  chaperones. Thus, a model has been proposed whereby the transcriptional increase
  of two major chaperone complexes, the ROSC linked to the UPR and the TRiC, might
  mitigate toxic protein aggregates in the ER and cytoplasm by accelerating their
  removal through the proteasome (via the ROSC) or by restoring proper folding (via
  the TRiC). PfKelch13 mutations C580Y and R539T increase levels of the P. falciparum
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PfPI3K) and its lipid product phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate
  (PtdIns3P). Thus, stimulation of macroautophagy by elevation of PtdIns3P suggests
  a second mechanism to remove toxic protein aggregates from the parasite.
