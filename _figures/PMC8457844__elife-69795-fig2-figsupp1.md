caption: Olmesartan, captopril, and aliskiren are antihypertensive medications working
  on the Renin-Angiotensin Signaling (RAAS) pathway by blocking the binding of angiotensin
  II to the receptor, inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II,
  and directly inhibiting the renin enzyme respectively. Ten other RAAS inhibitors
  also in the 1403-compound bioactive screen are imidapril, enalaprilat, quinapril,
  ramipril, moexipril, enalapril, which are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
  and valsartan, telmisartan, azilsartan, and eprosartan, which are angiotensin receptor
  blockers (ARBs).
