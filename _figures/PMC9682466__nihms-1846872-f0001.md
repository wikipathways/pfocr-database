caption: Shown is the general quorum sensing scheme for Vibrio campbellii, with a
  general list of individual and group behaviors observed in Vibrio species. Autoinducer
  molecules (HAI-1, CAI-1, AI-2) are synthesized by LuxM, CqsA, and LuxS, respectively,
  and bound by membrane-bound histidine kinase receptors LuxN, CqsS, and LuxPQ, respectively.
  The histidine kinase receptor HqsK senses nitric oxide. At low cell densities, autoinducer
  concentrations are low, the receptors are unbound, and the receptors act as kinases
  to phosphorylate LuxU, the phosphotransfer protein, which phosphorylates LuxO, the
  response regulator. Phosphorylated LuxO and Sigma-54 activate expression of the
  five Qrrs, which repress LuxR translation and activate AphA translation, leading
  to expression of genes for individual behaviors. At high cell densities, binding
  of autoinducers and/or nitric oxide to the receptors changes their activities to
  phosphatases, resulting in dephosphorylated LuxO and lack of Qrr expression. Thus,
  the production of the transcription factor LuxR is maximal, and LuxR activates and
  represses genes encoding proteins with various functions. LuxR protein homologs
  in various Vibrio species are listed.
