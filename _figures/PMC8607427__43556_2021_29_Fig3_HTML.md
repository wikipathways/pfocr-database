  description: PTM events in CDK5-mediated biological function in cancer progression.
    a PTM events in CDK5-mediated cell proliferation and DNA damage repair. (1) In
    cancer cells, CDK5 mediates cell proliferation through activating E2F-CDK2 pathway.
    (2) CDK5 induces c-Myc Ser62 phosphorylation for abolishing Bridging integrator
    1 (BIN1)/c-Myc interaction, promoting cell cycle progression. (3) During DNA damage,
    CDK5 can be up-regulated or phosphorylated by EGFR, inducing the phosphorylation
    of Ser727 on STAT3, the activated STAT3 promotes the expression of Eme1 gene to
    initiate DNA damage repair. (4) In response to radiation, ATM can be phosphorylated
    by CDK5 at Ser794 and undergoes autophosphorylation at Ser1981 for activation,
    which signals for p53 and H2AX pathways to initiate DNA damage repair. b The mechanism
