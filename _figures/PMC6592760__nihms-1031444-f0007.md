caption: Growth factor-stimulated cells often display increased ability to take up
  nutrients. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling is a typical downstream mediator
  of growth factor stimulation. Most growth factors that regulate metabolism bind
  to cognate RTKs, and result in the auto-phosphorylation of the receptor to initiate
  a series of kinase-mediated signalling events. Members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K) family are major targets of RTKs. Upon interaction with the auto-phosphorylated
  form of RTK, PI3K gets activated and converts the plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3). Local
  enrichment of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 serves as the subsequent signalling cue to bring together
  kinases including phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and AKT (also known
  as protein kinase B, PKB). PDK1 can phosphorylate the regulatory loop of AKT and
  promote AKT activation. AKT is a serine/threonine kinase, for which a variety of
  downstream targets have been identified, including glucose uptake through glucose
  transporter 1(GLUT1) and induction of glycolysis by activation of hexokinase (HK),
  which converts glucose to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) (see ). Together, activation
  of AKT targets supports an anabolic growth phenotype,. This process is under tight
  control as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 can be dephosphorylated and converted back to PtdIns(4,5)P2
  through the lipid phosphatase activity of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
  on chromosome 10 (PTEN). This negative regulatory mechanism, among others, dampens
  the PI3K–AKT pathway activity and ensures that normal cells can only commit themselves
  to proliferation when persistent growth factor signalling is present.
