caption: A. KRAS-mutant NSCLCs signal via the MAP kinase pathway to stimulate cell
  cycle progression. B. A bFGF autocrine/paracrine loop propagates and maintains palbociclib
  resistance in NSCLC. Increased signals through MEK-ERK1/2-mTOR enhance the expression,
  assembly and activity of cyclin D-CDK6, which promotes palbociclib-resistant proliferation
  and growth and enhances the transcription of the FGFR ligand bFGF. bFGF is secreted,
  where its activates its receptor to further enhance MEK-ERK1/2 signaling within
  the individual resistant cell as well as in neighboring cells. Increased MAP kinase
  activity in the palbociclib-resistant state also leads to increased cyclin E-CDK2
  activity. C. MAP kinase pathway inhibition is expected to disrupt the autocrine
  loop, reducing the expression of D-cyclins and CDK6. MEK inhibition causes increased
  expression of p27Kip1, as well as a redistribution of p27Kip1 from CDK4/6 to CDK7
  with maintenance of the association of p27Kip1 with CDK2. These events block the
  activating phosphorylation of CDK2 mediated by CAK, and directly block CDK2 activity.
  Therefore, MAP kinase inhibition reduces the activity of all G1 CDK complexes in
  palbociclib-resistant cells.
