caption: The B. licheniformis BlaP β-lactamase is inducible by a β-lactam antibiotic
  (the inducer) []. The regulation of β-lactamase production involves three regulatory
  genes, blaI, blaR1 and blaR2. The first two genes encode a repressor and a penicillin-sensory
  transducer respectively ([], but see []), whereas the third gene is not identified
  yet. (A) In the absence of a β-lactam antibiotic, the BlaI repressor is bound as
  a dimer to three operator sequences (OP1, OP2 and OP3) located in the intergenic
  region between blaP and blaI-blaR operon. Bound to DNA, BlaI prevents the transcription
  of the blaP, blaI and blaR1 genes ([], but see []), []. (B) When a β-lactam antibiotic
  is added in the medium, the extracellular penicillin-binding domain of BlaR (BlaR-CTD)
  is acylated by the antibiotic [], and a signal is transduced through the transmembrane
  segment resulting in the activation of the intracellular metalloprotease domain
  by proteolysis []. In B. licheniformis, it has been postulated that the activated
  metalloprotease converts a pro-coactivator into a co-activator, whose final target
  is BlaI itself. The BlaI dimer complexed with the co-activator is then released
  from its operator and β-lactamase is produced at high level ([], but see []). The
  product of blaR2 is necessary for the induction process; it is postulated that it
  can be involved in the activation of the intracellular domain of the BlaR receptor
  or in the production of the pro-coactivator [].
