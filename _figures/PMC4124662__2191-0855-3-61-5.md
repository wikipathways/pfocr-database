caption: Proposed pathway for CO2 incorporation in C. cellulovorans. Possible metabolic
  maps of C. cellulovorans in media containing NaH13CO3(a) and [U-13C]-glucose (b).
  Solid lines, possible pathways with directions indicated by arrows; dashed lines,
  impossible pathways in our studies. Lactate is produced from pyruvate, whereas fumarate
  is generated from oxaloacetate and malate. CO2 is fixed by PFOR and PEPC. In contrast,
  no citrate is produced from oxaloacetate.
