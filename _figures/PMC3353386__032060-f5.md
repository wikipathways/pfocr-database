caption: Antigen-presentation and apoptosis pathways are highly upregulated by Tx/91
  NS1 : 1–126. (a) Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes from IFN
  treatment and virus infection conditions. The Venn diagram shows induced genes changing
  ≥1.5-fold for Tx/91 NS1 : 1–126 relative to Tx/91 intersected with genes changing
  ≥1.5-fold for IFN-treated A549 cells relative to mock. (b) The 210 genes commonly
  differentially regulated were analysed in ipa and direct functional relationships
  between pathway nodes were examined. Nodes shaded yellow represent antigen-presentation
  genes, those shaded blue represent apoptosis- and complement-pathway genes, and
  nodes shaded green represent innate immune signalling genes.
