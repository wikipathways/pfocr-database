caption: RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway regulating hMPV-induced NF-κB and IRF activation
  in airway epithelial cells. Production of specific RNA moieties during viral replication
  leads to activation of the RIG-I-MAVs pathway, which subsequent activation of the
  IKK complex, which is upstream NF-κB activation, and of the TBK1/IKKβ complex, which
  regulates IRF-3 activation, leading to proinflammatory/immune gene expression. P
  indicates phosphorylation; ? indicates the unknown kinase that phosphorylates NF-кB
  in response to hMPV infection.
