caption: 'Ferroptosis-related signaling pathway. (A) GSH relies on the molecular substrate
  called cysteine, which is transferred via a heterodimeric cell membrane antiporter,
  system Xc-that is composed of SLC7A11 and SLC3A2, regulating ferroptosis by exchanging
  glutamate and cystine at a 1:1 ratio. (B) Ferroptosis is triggered by the peroxidation
  of PUFAs and accumulation of ROS, which are catalyzed by ACSL4 and LPCAT3. GPX4
  can hydrolyze lipid peroxides into innocuous alcohols. (C) Free iron bound with
  Tf is transported into intracellular area via TfR1 in endosomes. Fe (III) is reduced
  to redox-active iron (FeII) by ferrireductase of STEAP3, while Fe (II) is released
  from endosomes into LIP through DMT1. Under the oxidative stress, Fe2+ catalyzes
  the generation of hydroxyl radicals by Fenton reaction, which eventually initiates
  ferroptosis. Ferritin is utilized to iron storage and can be degraded by NCOA4-mediated
  ferritinophagy. (D) GSH synthesis is a requisite for GPX4 in mediating an antioxidant
  impact, thereby inhibiting the iron-dependent ROS production by catalyzing lipid
  hydroperoxides into lipid alcohols.; Abbreviations: GPX4, glutathione peroxidase
