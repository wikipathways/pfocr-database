caption: Key anorexigenic components are illustrated in dark blue for the leptin-melanocortin
  pathway and lighter blue for the BDNF-TrkB-FRS3 pathway. Pointed arrows between
  the components represent activation of downstream proteins, where whole pointed
  arrows indicate that the linking mechanisms are well-established and dotted pointed
  arrows indicate that mechanisms remain to be clarified. The leptin-melanocortin
  pathway is activated in response to increased leptin levels and other hormones in
  the feeding state, resulting in decreased appetite and food intake, increased energy
  expenditure, and lower BMI. It also has an inhibiting mechanism, illustrated in
  light blue to the left, where AGRP acts as an antagonist of MC4R in response to
  low leptin levels with food deprivation, resulting in MC4R inhibition, increased
  appetite, decreased energy expenditure, and higher BMI. The BDNF-TrkB pathway is
  thought to be activated downstream of the leptin-melanocortin pathway to mediate
  its effect on energy balance. We postulate that FRS3 is a link in the undiscovered
  downstream signaling cascade of BDNF and TrkB. Components of these pathways are
  associated with both monogenic and polygenic forms of obesity, with the supporting
  evidence summarized to the right in the figure. Created in BioRender. Aegisdottir,
