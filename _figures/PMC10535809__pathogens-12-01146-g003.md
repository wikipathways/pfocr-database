caption: 'HBV interaction with host metabolic pathways. Metabolic control orchestrated
  by hepatitis B protein X (HBx): (1–3) The hepatitis B protein X (HBx) mediates metabolic
  control by activating genes linked to glycolysis (grey arrows). (7) HBx modifies
  the expression of long non-coding RNA UCA1, leading to increased expression of hexokinase
  and upregulation of phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH). This enzymatic surge propels enhanced glycolysis, elevating pyruvate production.
  (8) The resulting pyruvate enters the mitochondria, converting to acetyl coenzyme
  A (acetyl-CoA) and entering the Krebs cycle. (9) Citrate undergoes reactions releasing
  carbon dioxide and generating reduced compounds NADPH and FADH. (10) This process
  boosts succinyl-CoA conversion to succinate, producing more GDP that converts to
  ATP. (6) HBx influences gluconeogenesis by up-regulating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
  (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC), facilitating the conversion of oxaloacetate
  to phosphoenolpyruvate and hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. (4) HBx
  stimulates transcription of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), pivotal in
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). (5) The PPP crucially generates nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and ribose-5-phosphate, vital for nucleotide
  biosynthesis. (11) HBx interacts with the liver X receptor (LXR) and increases the
  expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). (12) SREBP-1c,
  a transcription factor, promotes the expression of genes essential for fatty acid
  synthesis, including fatty acid synthase (FAS) (15) and peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor (PPAR). (13) The cytoplasmic FAS complex transforms acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA
  into palmitic acid, using NADPH as a cofactor (14). Palmitic acid contributes to
  key fatty acids in triglycerides. (18) Overexpressed PPAR induces serine-palmitoyl
  transferase (SPT) expression, condensing serine and palmitic acid into ceramide
  within the endoplasmic reticulum, a critical component in sphingolipid synthesis.
  (16) PPARs initiate phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) synthesis, enabling phospholipid
  transfer. (17) PPARs induce CD36 receptor expression, aiding fatty acid and lipoprotein
  uptake. (19) The interaction between HBV and NTCP disrupts bile acid metabolism,
  elevating serum bile acid levels.'
