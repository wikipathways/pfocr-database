caption: Mechanisms of kidney cell pyroptosis in chronic kidney disease. (1) (NLRP3-caspase-1-GSDMD
  pathway) PAMPs and DAMPs activate NLRP3 molecules, NLRP3 oligomerizing to form the
  NLRP3 complex, which recruits procaspase-1 monomers through the adapter protein
  ASC, activating caspase-1. Caspase-1 processes the pro-IL-1β/pro-IL-18 to generate
  mature IL-1β/IL-18, and in the meantime, GSDMD is cleaved to produce GSDMD-NT, which
  damage the cell membrane eventually leading to pyroptosis. Then, IL-1β and IL-18
  are released extracellularly, initiating the inflammatory response. Simultaneously,
  pyroptosis promotes the release of intracellular DAMP, further inducing pyroptosis
  in other cells and forming a positive feedback loop, aggravating renal inflammation
  damage. (2) (NLRP1-caspase-1-GSDMD pathway) Bacterial muramyl dipeptide, anthrax
  toxin, etc., can activate the NLRP1 inflammasome. The NLRP1 molecule C-terminal
  CARD domain can be directly activated by interacting with the CARD domain of procaspase-1,
  then activating caspase-1. The next steps are similar to the NLRP3 pathway. (3)
  (AIM2-caspase-1-GSDMD pathway) dsDNA can bind to and activate the C-terminal HIN200
  domain of AIM2, and the PYD domain of the activated AIM2 molecule interacts with
  that of the ASC molecule to activate ASC. The CARD domain of activated ASC combines
  with the CARD domain of procaspase-1 to form AIM2 inflammasome, and procaspase-1
  cuts and activates itself, eventually causing pyroptosis. (4) (LPS-caspase-4/5/11-GSDMD
  pathway) When the pathogen invades the kidney cells, the component of LPS, lipid
  A, binds to and activate the CARD domain of caspase-11, thereby cleaving GSDMD and
  causing pyroptosis. Meanwhile, the gap junction protein 1 (pannexin 1) transmembrane
  channel is cleaved, forming a pathway, along which the intracellular ATP is released.
  ATP binds to the membrane P2X7 receptor, opening the nonselective P2X7 positive
  ion channel, which causes intracellular K+ outflow and extracellular Na+ and Ca2+
  inflow, and finally the cell membrane is damaged, leading to pyroptosis. (5) (ATP-caspase-3-GSDME
  pathway) ATP can activate caspase-3 in macrophages and lyse GSDME protein to produce
  GSDME-NT. GSDME-NT is similar to GSDMD-NT, leading to membrane pore formation, eventually
  resulting in pyroptosis.
