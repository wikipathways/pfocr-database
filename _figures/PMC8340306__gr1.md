caption: Molecular mechanism of cGAS-STING signalling.The initial function of cGAS-STING
  signalling is to defend host cells against pathogens, and later studies have shown
  that this pathway is also related to inflammatory diseases and tumours. Upon recognition
  of DNA, cGAS-DNA complexes catalyse ATP and GTP to generate 2’,3’cGAMP. STING located
  in the ER can be activated by 2’,3’cGAMP and other CDNs. Activated STING recruits
  and phosphorylates TBK1 and IKK, which can phosphorylate IRF3 and IκBα. Phosphorylated
  IRF3 translocates to the nucleus where it triggers the transcription of the IFN-I
  gene. Phosphorylated IκBα recruits NF-κB and initiates the transcription of genes
  encoding proinflammatory cytokines. CDNs, cyclic dinucleotides; cGAMP, cyclic GMP-AMP;
