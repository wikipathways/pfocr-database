caption: Figure 1. Simplified illustration of Type II fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB)
  in photosynthetic organisms. The synthesis of fatty acids takes place within the
  plastid. (A) The initial steps involve the synthesis of malonyl-CoA by the enzyme
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase). (B) Malonyl-CoA is converted into malonyl-ACP by
  enzyme FabD, following which a series of Fab enzymes are engaged in the synthesis
  of saturated fatty acid chains. (C) The production of unsaturated fatty acids is
  catalyzed by a number of fatty acid desaturases (FADs).
