caption: Model for atypical MyD88-independent TLR7 signaling during Yersinia pestis
  infection. Wild-type Y. pestis prevents the acidification of the macrophage phagosome,
  and the bacteria remain viable in a pathogen-containing vacuole. For this compartment,
  we hypothesize that Y. pestis stimulates atypical TLR7 signaling (MyD88 independent),
  which activates the expression of IFN-β. In contrast, the phoP mutant is unable
  to prevent the acidification and maturation of the phagosome. Consequently, bacteria
  lyse and likely stimulate canonical TLR signaling through MyD88 and TRIF, which
  activates the transcription of IFN-β, TNF-α, and other proinflammatory cytokines.
  During pneumonic plague, the TLR7 type I IFN response protects the lungs but causes
  pathology in the liver.
