caption: 'A proposed model in which ABA and other endogenous hormones modulate starch
  accumulation. Red upward arrow indicates up-regulated protein in response to uniconazole,
  green downward arrow for down-regulated, gray arrow means no significant difference
  was observed in this research. The model was constructed to help understanding uniconazole-induced
  hormone variation and starch accumulation in L. punctata. Uniconazole induces in
  expression of hormone-associated enzymes that result in changes in endogenous hormone
  contents. ABA is bound by PYRs and then initiates ABA signaling pathway [, ]. The
  significantly increased ABA and decreased GA modulate the expression of some enzymes
  involved in starch metabolism, and these enzymes finally result in starch accumulation.
  There may be an unknown regulation mechanism of starch accumulation, which is indicated
  by a question mark. See text for detailed description of the model. PYR: pyrabactin
  resistance; AGP: ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; α-AMY: alpha-amylase'
