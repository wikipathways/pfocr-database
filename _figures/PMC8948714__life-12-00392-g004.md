caption: Gene ontology interaction network of the ClueGO analysis of clustered cytokines
  within each GO node for biological process interaction and signalling pathway analysis
  involved in the treated cells. Node sizes are relative to the number of proteins
  in the dataset identified in that GO. Coloured nodes and labels present important
  GO terms in-network. Red nodes indicate GO related to cell regulation and differentiation,
  yellow glial cell activation and neuroinflammatory response, dark blue nodes regulation
  of cascades, green nodes regulation of negative inflammatory response and epithelial
  cells, purple nodes positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase signalling,
  light blue nodes positive regulation of peptidyl-tyrosine phosphyrylation, orange
  nodes negative regulation of endothelial cell proliferation.
