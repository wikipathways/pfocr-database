caption: CYP2D6 metabolic pathway of common oral opioids resulting in biologically
  active metabolites. Depending on CYP2D6 metabolic activity (poor, intermediate,
  extensive or ultrarapid metabolizing status) varying levels of respective active
  metabolites from codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone and oxycodone are formed resulting
  in clinically unpredictable inter-individual variations in responses. Oral morphine,
  hydromorphone and tapentadol are not affected by the CYP2D6 metabolic pathway.
