caption: Ferritinophagy regulatory network influences ferroptosis sensitivity. Lysosomal
  iron is produced by ferritinophagy and TFR1-mediated transient iron storage. Release
  of ferrous iron from lysosomes increases the cytosolic LIP, exacerbates lipid peroxidation
  and promotes ferroptosis. VAMP8 functions as a fusion autophagosome and lysosome
  and is transcribed by the MiT/TFE family transcription factor TFEB. TFEB also functions
  to upregulate the expression of TFR1, FTH1, and FTL. NRF2 initiates transcription
  of the ferritin components FTH1 and FTL enables safe storage of cytosolic iron.
  Ferritinophagy is mediated by NCOA4, and both ferritin containing ferric iron and
  empty ferritin can be recognized by NCOA4 and undergo autophagic degradation. Transcriptional
  regulation of NCOA4 by JNK/c-Jun and phosphorylation of NCOA4 by ATM and ERK can
  regulate ferritinophagy. ATM can regulate the expression of FTH1 and FTL through
  MTF1, while MTF1 also has the function of initiating the transcription of the iron
  export protein FPN1. NRF2 upregulates the E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2 to inhibit FBXL5-IRP2-mediated
  ferritin synthesis and suppresses NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy. Divalent free iron
  can bind to NCOA4 and FBXL5, which contributes to the ubiquitin degradation of NCOA4
  by HERC2 and maintains the stability and functionality of FBXL5. NRF2 also indirectly
  inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK and phosphorylation of mTOR. The latter phosphorylates
  TFEB and thereby deprives it of its transcriptional function. The regulation of
  autophagy by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway affects ferritinophagy as well as ferroptosis

  description: Ferritinophagy regulatory network influences ferroptosis sensitivity.
    Lysosomal iron is produced by ferritinophagy and TFR1-mediated transient iron
    storage. Release of ferrous iron from lysosomes increases the cytosolic LIP, exacerbates

    and lysosome and is transcribed by the MiT/TFE family transcription factor TFEB.
    TFEB also functions to upregulate the expression of TFR1, FTH1, and FTL. NRF2
    initiates transcription of the ferritin components FTH1 and FTL enables safe storage
    of cytosolic iron. Ferritinophagy is mediated by NCOA4, and both ferritin containing
    ferric iron and empty ferritin can be recognized by NCOA4 and undergo autophagic
