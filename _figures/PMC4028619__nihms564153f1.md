caption: 'SAM biosynthesis is catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase MAT1A in
  the liver. SAM donates methyl groups to methyltransferases and also Glycine N-methyltransferase
  for methylation of Glycine to become S-adenosyl homocysteine, which is hydrolyzed
  to form Hcy. Hcy is then re-methylated to form methionine by one of two enzymes,
  methionine synthase (MS), the canonical enzyme found in all cells, or betaine-homocysteine-methyltransferase
  BHMT which is found mainly in the liver and kidney. Low abundance of SAM can lead
  to a lack of methyl reactions in the liver, oxidative stress (via deregulation of
  the transulfuration pathway) and arrest of DNA synthesis (via the folate metabolic
  pathway). Maintenance of the SAM: Hcy ratio and the labile methyl pool are essential
  to liver function.'
