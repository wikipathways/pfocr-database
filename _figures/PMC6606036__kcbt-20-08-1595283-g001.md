caption: GSK-3β-mediated signaling pathways. When the Wnt ligand is present, it inhibits
  GSK-3β on the target cell, which suppresses β-catenin phosphorylation and makes
  it stable in cytoplasm. Stable β-catenin translocates into the nucleus promoting
  transcription of target genes such as c-Myc and cyclin-D. GSK-3β prevents epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) by inhibiting Snail, a repressor of E-cadherin gene. GSK-3β phosphorylates
  several upstream and downstream components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and AKT
  can phosphorylate GSK-3β and inhibit its activity.
