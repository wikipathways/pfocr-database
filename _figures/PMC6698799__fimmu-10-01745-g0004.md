caption: Proposed molecular mechanism of regulation of the pyrin inflammasome. Geranylgeranylation
  (mevalonate kinase pathway) and release of GEF-H1 (i.e., through the microtubule
  polymerization inhibitor colchicine) induce RhoA activity. RhoA effector kinases,
  PKN1 and PKN2, cause subsequent phosphorylation of pyrin and binding to inhibitory
  proteins 14-3-3. This mechanism is enhanced by PKN1/2 activating substances and
  release of GEF-H1, while low GEF-H1 or defective MVK-pathway function leads to inactivation
  of PKN1/2. Decreased phosphorylation of pyrin is associated with pyrin inflammasome
  activation and release of mature IL-1β and IL-18. The release of IL-1β and IL-18
  is further facilitated by the production of the plasma membrane pore-forming N-terminal
  fragment of gasdermin D.

  description: Proposed molecular mechanism of regulation of the pyrin inflammasome.
    Geranylgeranylation (mevalonate kinase pathway) and release of GEF-H1 (i.e., through
    the microtubule polymerization inhibitor colchicine) induce RhoA activity. RhoA
    effector kinases, PKN1 and PKN2, cause subsequent phosphorylation of pyrin and

    with pyrin inflammasome activation and release of mature IL-1β and IL-18. The
    release of IL-1β and IL-18 is further facilitated by the production of the plasma
    membrane pore-forming N-terminal fragment of gasdermin D.
