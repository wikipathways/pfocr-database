caption: The role of ER Ca2+ in synaptic plasticity. A, the ER can extend into both
  the pre- and postsynaptic compartments of a synapse. In presynaptic terminals, ER
  Ca2+ release can trigger spontaneous neurotransmitter release and can also integrate
  with voltage-gated Ca2+ entry elicited from action potential invasion to facilitate
  vesicle release and the repopulation of the ready-releasable pool of vesicles. NMDAR-mediated
  Ca2+ signals are amplified postsynaptically by RyR in dendritic spines and contribute
  to homosynaptic plasticity. At extrasynaptic sites, glutamate spillover triggers
  metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor-mediated generation of IP3 and activates
  a Ca2+response outside of the synaptic contact point. Subsequent activation of IP3Rs
  supports regenerative Ca2+ waves, which may be involved in heterosynaptic plasticity
  and gene expression. [Modified from Bardo S, Cavazzini MG, and Emptage N (2006)
  The role of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store in the plasticity of central neurons.
  Trends Pharmacol Sci 27:78–84.). B, the Ca2+ generated by both plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable
  channels (e.g., NMDAR) and ER Ca2+ channels can subsequently trigger multiple Ca2+-dependent
  cascades that encode long-term plasticity. In the case of LTP, Ca2+ in dendritic
  spines locally activates effectors, including calmodulin, which in turn activates
  several kinase pathways such as adenylyl cyclase, CamKII, and PKC. These then trigger
  longer term cascades, such as the cAMP/phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding
  protein (pCREB) pathway, which results in protein translation and long-term structural
  and functional alterations to the neuron that support learning and memory encoding.
