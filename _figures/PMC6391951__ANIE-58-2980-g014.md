caption: 'Illustration of most of the proposed modes of action of antitumoral POMs.
  a) POM induced inhibition of ATP synthesis by interfering with the electron transfer
  chain (represented as dark blue entities, the inset shows a zoomed view of the chain).
  b) POM induced increase in ROS‐level (for example by oxidizing cell components)
  and depletion of the GSH pool (by GSH oxidation). c) POM induced enhancement of
  the expression of pro‐apoptotic components (Bax and Bim) and the reduction of the
  expression of anti‐apoptotic components (bcl‐2 and NF‐κB). d),e) Activation of the
  p53 and/or p38 pathway by POMs. Please note: the circles reading p38 and p53 do
  not represent the respective protein but the pathways. f) Induction of apoptosis
  by direct DNA damage. g),h) POM‐mediated inhibition of angiogenesis via interaction
  with bFGF and VEGF leading to the disruption of the VEGF/bFGF‐receptor interactions
  (receptors are indicated as yellow and brownish channels). Without VEGF/bFGF‐receptor
  binding, the ERK pathway cannot be activated leading to the breakdown of angiogenesis.
  i) Inhibition of ectonucleotidases by POMs leads to a distortion in the concentrations
  of nucleotides (NTP, NDP, and NMP) and nucleosides (Ns), which negatively affects
  the functioning of cancer cells. j) Inhibition of HDAC by POMs leads to the accumulation
  of acetylated histones, causing fatal changes in the expression of genes. k) Inhibition
  of P‐type ATPases has fatal effects on the cellular ion homeostasis. l) Decavanadate‐induced
  mitochondria membrane depolarization. m) Inhibition of other proteins that affect
  cell viability (for more details, see text of Section 2.3.1 and 3.2.5, and references
  therein). n) POM hybrids loaded with siRNA (siRNA is depicted as red RNA structure)
  downregulate HIF‐1, leading to the impairment of angiogenesis and the adaptation
  of cancer cells to the hypoxic environment. o) Immunostimulating activity of POMs
  by promoting the expression of antibodies and immune‐related components (for example,
  NK cells). The figure depicts the activation of NK cells via antibody binding enhancing
  the recognition of tumor cells (antigens are depicted as purple triangles) by NK
  cells. Dotted lines indicate that the reason of activation/deactivation (for example,
  enhanced/decreased expression) of certain components is not known. The release of
  cytochrome c (purple circle) triggers the apoptotic machinery of the cell, which
  ultimately activate the final executers of apoptosis (caspases).'
