caption: Proposed mechanism of Pin1 in the reversal of PAH. Juglone inhibits Pin1
  activity which (i) blocks proliferation through inhibition of cell cycle proteins;
  (ii) inhibits inflammation through blocking the NFκB pathway; (iii) inhibits TGF-β
  signalling via pSmad2/3 and enhances BMP signalling via pSmad1/5/8-Id1/3 axis. Abnormal
  proliferation and excessive inflammation along with enhanced TGF-β signalling and
  impaired BMP signalling leads to initiation and progression of PAH. Inhibition of
  Pin1 with selective Pin1 inhibitors might reverse the abnormal remodelling and inhibits
  PAH
