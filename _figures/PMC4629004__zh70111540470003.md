caption: Changes in genes encoding components of the glycolytic, TCA cycle, and mitochondrial
  NADH shuttle pathways in gastrocnemius muscle in response to BCATm KO. Effects of
  BCATm KO on muscle gene expression are shown for the glycolysis pathway (A), citric
  acid (TCA) cycle (B), and two mitochondrial NADH shuttles (C). Metabolites and glycolytic
  intermediates are shown in black font; gene names are italicized. The beige border
  represents the sarcolemma (A) or mitochondrial membrane (C). Black arrows indicate
  a pathway direction. Blue color indicates that the expression of the gene was decreased
  (emphasized with a down direction arrow). Red color indicates expression of a gene
  was increased (emphasized with an up direction arrow). Lighter shades of blue along
  with lightfaced rather than boldfaced font indicates that the normalized fold change
  was significant, but less than the −1.4 normalized fold change used as an arbitrary
  cut-off for IPA analysis (Supplementary Tables S1–S3). Gray font and equal sign
  (emphasized with = sign) indicates no significant change. Where the abundance of
  two isoforms is different, the font size is smaller for the isoform where the FPKM
  has a lower value (Supplementary Tables S1–S3).
