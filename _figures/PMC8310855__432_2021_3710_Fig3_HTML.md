caption: Overview of the downstream activation and crosstalk of signalling pathways
  of cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid receptors. Activation of the cannabinoid receptors
  CB1 and CB2 (red arrows) via cannabinoids stimulate ERK1/2 signalling which activates
  p27 and p21 causing a decrease in cyclins D and E, cdc2 and cdk2 through an increase
  in pRb, leading to cell cycle arrest. Inhibition of the P13K pathway leads to a
  decrease in Akt which inhibits cell proliferation. Biosynthesis of ceramide takes
  place at the endoplasmic reticulum through a series of biochemical steps involving
  many enzymes which help to convert dihydroceramides (DhCers) into ceramide. An increase
  in ceramide level in turn increases the stress protein p8/Nupr1 and TRIB3 which
  activates upregulation of ATF4 and CHOP proteins. A decrease in Akt leads to a downregulation
  in mTORC1 signalling causing autophagy. Activation of TRPM8 (purple arrows) leads
  to an increase in ROS production which also induces ER stress. Stimulation of non-cannabinoid
  receptor GPR55 (blue arrows) through LPI via the subunit Gαq subunit stimulates
  the production of PLC to release Ca2+ and DAG which leads to the activation of MAPK/ERK
  signalling. This causes gene transcription by activation of transcription factors
  CREB and NF-κß. Gα12/13 subunit activates the RhoA/ROCK pathway which regulates
  PLC, actin cytoskeleton and p38/ATF2 activity. ATF2/p38 inhibits antiapoptotic proteins
  and enhances the interaction between Beclin-1 and Vps34 which is also inhibited
  by BCL-2 further enhancing ROS production by activation of the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway (Velasco et al. , ).Created with BioRender.com. TRPV1,2 transient receptor
