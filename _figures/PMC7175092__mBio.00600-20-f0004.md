caption: Metabolic model of anaerobic ethane oxidation in “Ca. Ethanoperedens thermophilum.”
  Ethane is activated in the ethane-specific MCR. The produced CoM-bound ethyl groups
  are consecutively oxidized and transformed to CoA-bound acetyl units. Acetyl-CoA
  is cleaved using the ACDS of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The remaining methyl groups
  are fully oxidized on the reversed methanogenesis pathway. Similarly to ANME archaea
  and “Ca. Syntrophoarchaeum,” “Ca. Ethanoperedens” does not contain a reductive pathway;
  hence, electrons released during ethane oxidation are transferred to the partner
  bacterium “Ca. Desulfofervidus auxilii.” Therefore, in both partners, cytochromes
  and pili are present and expressed, similarly to what is described in thermophilic
  consortia performing AOM () (for detailed expression patterns, see ).
