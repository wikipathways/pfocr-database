caption: Possible origins of urinary excretion of 3MGC (U-3MGC) in SLOS. Dotted lines
  represent multiple metabolic steps. Red arrows indicate reported changes in metabolite
  concentration or excretion. When in parenthesis, the arrows indicate putative changes.
  In SLOS, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (7-DHC reductase) deficiency causes low
  cholesterol, 7-DHC accumulation and diversion of 7-DHC precursors toward dolichol
  and ubiquinone, whereas mevalonate (MVA) is normal. Short-chain isoprenoid precursor
  3,3’-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMA-PP) may also accumulate as a consequence of
  7-DHC reductase deficiency. DMA-PP may be metabolized into 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA
  via the shunt pathway and excreted in the urine as 3MGC (pathway 1). Alternatively,
  3-methylglutaconyl-CoA may be converted to HMG-CoA by mitochondrial 3MGC-CoA hydratase
  and further converted to CO2 or fatty acids (pathway 2). 3-Methylglutaconic acid
  is also a byproduct of the mitochondrial leucine catabolic pathway (pathway 3).
  Hence, in SLOS, increased U-3MGC may be caused by 1) increased diversion of MVA
  through the shunt pathway secondary to either MVA accumulation and overflow or activation
  of the enzymes of the MVA shunt pathway, or 2) impaired mitochondrial function,
  a potential consequence of altered cell membrane structure ().
