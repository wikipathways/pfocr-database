caption: Model of activation of the ATR-signaling pathway during G1/G0 or G2-M phases
  of the cell cycle. When DNA is damaged by UV or a UV-mimetic agent, the core excision
  repair factors (RPA, XPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, XPF-ERCC1) excise a ∼30 nt oligomer containing
  the damage. (Note that XPC, after playing an essential role in damage recognition,
  dissociates from the repair complex prior to the dual incisions (1) (18), and hence
  it is not shown in the incision complex.) The resulting gap is either filled in
  by polymerases or the gap is enlarged by EXO1. The enlarged ssDNA gap is coated
  with RPA, which recruits ATR-ATRIP, TopBP1, and substrates including p53. The close
  proximity of the ATR kinase with its activator, TopBP1, and substrate, p53, results
  in phosphorylation and checkpoint activation.
