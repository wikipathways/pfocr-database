caption: 'A brief summary of the possible mechanisms of KSHV-mediated pathogenesis
  at the cellular level. Shown in the diagram are viral lytic proteins in orange and
  viral latent proteins in green. (i) KSHV vGPCR, K1, K15, and vIL-6 proteins activate
  the PI3 Kγ/AKT, MAPK, JAK/STAT, NF-κB, MEK/ERK/JNK signaling pathways for infected
  cells to secrete a number of cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6/8/10/1β, GM-CSF
  and VEGF; KSHV miR-K5/9/10a also induced the cytokines secretion. miR-K2/3/5/6 can
  induce angiogenesis-related factors, like VEGFA; (ii) KSHV encodes three chemokine
  homologs: viral CC-chemokine ligand-1-3 (vCCL1-K6, vCCL2-K4 and vCCL3-K4.1) to downregulate
  cellular immune response; (iii) KSHV RTA up-regulates the Notch ligand JAG1 by interacting
  with LEF1 and triggers Notch activation in neighboring cells. The activated Notch
  inhibits KSHV reactivation in those neighboring cells. It provides an insight into
  the mechanism by which a minority of viruses undergoes reactivation, while the majority
  maintains a persistent latent infection in KS tissues; (iv) v-FLIP in the infected
  cells inhibits the activation of pro-caspase-8 and has the ability to induce the
  expression of anti-apoptotic proteins via activation of NF-κB to upregulate pro-survival
  genes expression. vBcl-2, a homolog of cellular Bcl-2, inhibits apoptosis via tightly
  binding proapoptotic peptides. KSHV miR-K10a blocks TWEAK-induced apoptosis; (v)
  LANA affects the BMP signaling pathway and converts it to an oncogenic BMP-Smad1-Id
  pathway, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of KSHV-induced malignancies;
  (vi) KSHV LANA binds to and blocks p53-transcriptional activity to inhibit p53-induced
  cell death. LANA also binds and inactivates pRb, thereby removing the inhibition
  of pRb-induced cell cycle arrest. LANA binds to GSK-3β and thus accumulates unphosphorylated
  β-catenin, which in turn affects the cell cycle. v-Cyclin regulates the cell cycle
  and cell proliferation by constitutive activation of cellular cyclin-dependent kinase
  6. vIRF-3 acts as a transcriptional activator on genes controlled by cellular IRF-3
  and IRF-7. Further, vIRF-3 negatively regulates p53 protein stability, thereby inhibits
  p53-mediated activation of p21 gene transcription.'
