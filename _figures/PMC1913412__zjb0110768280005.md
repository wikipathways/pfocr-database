caption: Biosynthesis of phenylalanine via fructose 6-phosphate. (Left column) Synthesis
  of erythrose 4-phosphate by reaction of the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway.
  TK, transketolase; TA, transaldolase. The labeling pattern of dehydroshikimate is
  constructed from erythrose 4-phosphate and PEP on the basis of the conventional
  shikimate pathway. (Right column) Synthesis via 6-deoxy-5-ketofructose 1-phosphate
  and aspartate semialdehyde. The labeling pattern of aspartate semialdehyde was predicted
  from that of aspartate.
