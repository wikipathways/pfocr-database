caption: Formation of uroporphyrinogen III (UPG III) and the branching of the heme
  b biosynthesis. In nature, the pathway from 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) to UPG
  III is a highly conserved three-enzyme cascade. UPG III is decarboxylated by uroporphyrinogen
  III decarboxylase to form coproporphyrinogen III (CPG III), a reaction shared by
  the protoporphyrin-dependent (PPD) and coproporphyrin-dependent (CPD) pathways.
  In the siroheme-dependent (SHD) pathway, the C2 and C7 positions of UPG III are
  methylated by the SAM-dependent uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase (SumT) to
  generate precorrin-2.
