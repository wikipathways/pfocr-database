caption: An overview of the folate metabolism pathway in formation of essential intermediates
  in Leishmania. (a) Dihydrofolate (DHF) is converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF) by
  the actions of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and/or pteridine reductase (PTR1).
  THF is modified by serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) or formyltetrahydrofolate
  ligase (FTL) and the interplay between three substituted intermediates of THF is
  controlled by the bifunctional dehydrogenase cyclohydrolase (DHCH). Intermediates
  generated at each stage are utilized by other pathways, for example N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  is used by thymidylate synthase (TS). (b) The action of DHCH maintains the required
  levels of methenyl-, methylene-, formyl-tetrahydrofolate molecules, first by an
  NADP+ dependent oxidation from N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to form N5,N10-methenyltetrahydrofolate,
  then to N10-formyltetrahydrofolate by the cyclohydrolase activity. The inhibitor
  LY354899 is also shown. Figure produced using ChemDraw.
