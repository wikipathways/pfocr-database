caption: The related mechanism of PSTPIP2. PSTPIP2 have a N-terminal F-BAR domain
  and a C-terminal tail. The PSTPIP2 C-terminal can be combined with PEST- family
  and the inhibition of PSTPIP2 is mediated by protein tyrosine phosphatases located
  in the central area of PEST-family. PEST-PTPs can bind to CSK through a proline-rich
  or tyrosine-rich motif in their central region. PEST-PTPs also involves recruiting
  CSK to PSTPIP2, which further enhances the independent binding of CSK to PSTPIP2.
  SHIP1 binds to the key tyrosine residues at the C terminal of PSTPIP2. Lipid phosphatase
  SHIP1, a regulatory protein, controls the activity of the PI3K pathway via dephosphorylating
  its crucial mediator, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI (3,4,5) P3].
  This results in the decreased activity of some of its downstream effectors, such
  as Akt. PSTPIP2 regulate membrane curvature by binding to cell membrane phospholipids
  by F-BAR domain. F-BAR could bind to actin polymerization factor of actin filament.
  WASP binds to the Arp2/3 complex and triggers the formation of a weave of actin
  comprising branched actin filaments. And the SH3 domain of PSTPIP1 could interact
  with WASP.
