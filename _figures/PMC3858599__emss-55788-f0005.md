caption: Resveratrol promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and functions through indirect
  AMPK and SIRT1 activation. First, compelling evidence suggests that the metabolic
  actions of resveratrol are based on its ability to act as a mitochondrial poison
  by inhibiting ATP synthase activity (1). The resulting energy stress will in turn
  activate AMPK, leading to the stimulation of SIRT1 by increasing NAD+ levels. SIRT1
  will then activate downstream targets through deacetylation, ultimately leading
  to an improvement of mitochondrial function. Another potential explanation of how
  resveratrol acts is based on a recent report showing that resveratrol inhibits phosphodiesterase
  (PDE) 4 activity and induces cAMP signaling resulting in Ca2+ release and, ultimately
  the activation of the CamKKb-AMPK pathway (2).
