caption: Metabolic reprogramming during OS metastasis. MPT promotes Warburg effect
  in OS cells by suppressing mitochondrial function. The serum metabolic profile of
  lung metastasis shows lowered carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism but an elevated
  lipid metabolism. YB-1 contributes to metastasis by translational activation of
  EMT and HIF-1α, which then induces CXCR4 expression. Cyr61 enhances the metastatic
  potential of OS cells through multiple signaling pathways, including PI-3K/Akt/GSK3β,
  IGF1/IGFR, and angiogenesis-associated signaling (increased VEGF, FGF2, PECAM and
  reduced TSP-1, SPARC). WWOX maintains mitochondrial respiration and inhibits Warburg
  effect by physical interaction with HIF-1α. WWOX also suppresses c-Jun activity
  by physical association while CDH4 overexpression activates c-Jun via the JNK pathway.
  AP-1 is a transcriptional complex, mainly composed of c-Jun and c-Fos, which promotes
  metastatic potential by upregulating several downstream effectors, including FGFR1,
  podoplanin, and TGFβ. The dotted lines indicate the mechanistic study is performed
  in melanoma cells, that is, HIF-1α interacts with AP-1, which then binds to AP-1-binding
  motif within the Cyr61 promoter and induces Cyr61 expression. MPT, mitochondrial
  permeability transition; YB-1, Y-box binding protein 1; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition; Cyr61, cysteine-rich protein 61; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1;
