caption: Model linking trans-splicing to nutrient dependent translational control
  of maternal mRNA. Growth is characterized by an increase in the production of the
  protein synthesis machinery (via the translation of TOP mRNAs) and is limited by
  resource availability. The mTOR pathway mediates the response to nutrient levels
  by controlling the translation of TOP mRNAs. Egg number in O. dioica is dependent
  on nutrient levels and the majority of maternal mRNAs and TOP mRNAs are trans-spliced.
  We propose a model whereby the spliced-leader fulfills the function of the TOP motif
  and allows the translational control of trans-spliced mRNAs. This allows the animal
  to adjust reproductive output, and therefore population level, in accordance with
  dynamic resource levels (including algal blooms) in its environment. Control at
  the translational level allows a more rapid response to changes in nutrient levels
  compared to transcriptional control, and this may be of particular importance for
  organisms with short life cycles.
