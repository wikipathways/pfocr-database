caption: Summary of the role NGN2 plays in the differentiation of different neuronal
  subtypesDuring the differentiation of glutamatergic cortical neurons, PAX6 activates
  NGN2, which in turn inhibits PAX6 and results in the activation of the cortical
  transcription factor cascade (orange pathway). NGN2 is phosphorylated at two serine
  residue sites and forms a complex with LHX3 and ISLET1, activating genes required
  for motor neuron differentiation (green pathway). NGN2 plays a role in dopaminergic
  neuron differentiation but is not a critical regulator (purple pathway). NGN2 plays
  a role in the waves of sensory neurogenesis, in turn activating the genes required
  for differentiation of specific peripheral sensory neuron subtypes (pink pathway).
  NGN2 inhibits MASH1, a transcription factor required for GABAergic neuron generation
  (gray pathway). WNT signaling activates NGN2, which represses the differentiation
  of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes by the downregulation of astrocyte genes and
  OLIG2, respectively (cream pathway).
