caption: 'NADPH serves as a major electron donor for reductive biosynthesis and defence
  against ROS, reactions that yield its oxidized form, NADP+. In the cytosol, NADPH
  can be regenerated from NADP+ through reactions involving two enzymes of the oxidative
  PPP (G6PD and PGD), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and malic enzyme (ME). Downstream
  of AKT and mTORC1, SREBP induces expression of these enzymes to enhance NADPH production.
  AKT-mediated phosphorylation of NADK serves to boost NADP+ abundance to further
  enhance the production of NADPH through these redox reactions. Many cellular reactions
  consume a large quantity of NADPH as reducing power. NADPH is required for key reactions
  in the biosynthesis of macromolecules, including fatty acid synthase (FASN) to produce
  palmitate, ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) to convert ribonucleotide diphosphates
  (NDPs) into deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates (dNDPs), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)
  for tetrahydrofolate synthesis, and the proline synthesis enzymes pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  (P5C) synthase (P5CS) and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR). NADPH also serves
  as essential reducing power for antioxidant enzymes including glutathione reductase
  (GR), which reduces the oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to glutathione (GSH),
  and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which transfers electrons from NADPH to reduce
  thioredoxin for subsequent reduction of oxidized cysteines.ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (reduced); G6PD, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGD, phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase; SREBP: Sterol regulatory element binding proteins; NADK, NAD kinase.'
