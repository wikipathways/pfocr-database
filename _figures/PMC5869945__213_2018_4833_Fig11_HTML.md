caption: DA mediated the destruction of the synaptogenesis signaling pathway. a DA
  initiates its effects by binding to a dopamine receptor. Once activated, the DR
  recruits DARPP32, which inhibits the activation of GABAARβ, then destroys the TrkB
  signaling, and subsequently dephosphorylates AKT. Inactivated AKT leads to the downregulation
  of presynaptic markers (synaptotagmin and synapsin I) and postsynaptic markers (PSD95
  and spinophilin), which induces synaptic loss. b Conversely, BAI is recruited to
  bind to GABAARβ1, which activates TrkB signaling and subsequently phosphorylates
  AKT. Activated AKT leads to the upregulation of presynaptic markers (synaptotagmin
  and synapsin I) and postsynaptic markers (PSD95 and spinophilin), which potentiates
  synaptic loss

  description: DA mediated the destruction of the synaptogenesis signaling pathway.
    a DA initiates its effects by binding to a dopamine receptor. Once activated,
    the DR recruits DARPP32, which inhibits the activation of GABAARβ, then destroys

    to the downregulation of presynaptic markers (synaptotagmin and synapsin I) and
    postsynaptic markers (PSD95 and spinophilin), which induces synaptic loss. b Conversely,
    BAI is recruited to bind to GABAARβ1, which activates TrkB signaling and subsequently
    phosphorylates AKT. Activated AKT leads to the upregulation of presynaptic markers
    (synaptotagmin and synapsin I) and postsynaptic markers (PSD95 and spinophilin),
    which potentiates synaptic loss
