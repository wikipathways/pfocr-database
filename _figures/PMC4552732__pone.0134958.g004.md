caption: a) Increasing metabolites of galactosylsphingosine, sphinganine, sphingosine
  and palmitoyl sphingomyelin were found in PAH. Gene array shows that expression
  of genes coding for the key enzymes that catalyze particular steps in the pathway
  are significant increased, including serine palmitoyltransferase, long chain base
  subunit 1(SPTLC1), serine palmitoyltransferase, long chain base subunit 3 (SPTLC3),
  neutral sphingomyelinase activation associated factor (NSMAF), sphingomyelin synthase
  2 (sgms2), N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase (non-lysosomal ceramidase) 2 (ASAH2)
  (P<0.01). In all graphs, metabolic data for normal lung are shown in filled green
  boxes for control, data for PAH lung are represented in filled pink boxes, and the
  genes encoding key enzyme are shown in open blue boxes for control and open green
  boxes data for PAH lung (NL = control, PAH = pulmonary hypertension). P<0.05 for
  the group labeled with red frame.
