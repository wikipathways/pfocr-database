caption: Wild type mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells can be differentiated into primitive
  erythroid colonies (A). In the normal setting, colony formation can be further increased
  by p53 knockdown. (B) Rps19 mutant ES cells exhibit defective primitive erythroid
  colony formation through an unknown p53-independent mechanism. However colony formation
  can be augmented by p53 knockdown through a separate p53 dependent pathway. (C)
  The Rpl5 mutant ES cells show an early cell cycle defect at the ES cell stage that
  is p53-independent. These cells also exhibit a similar defect in primitive erythroid
  colony formation through a p53- independent mechanism. p53 knockdown in these cells
  increases colony formation to a greater degree than the Rps19 mutant cells, for
  unknown reasons.
