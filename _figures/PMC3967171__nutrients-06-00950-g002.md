caption: Sex hormones and SREBP selectively regulate expression of Aldh1. ALDH1A1,
  ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3 are members of the ALDH1 enzyme family that convert Rald to
  RA. E2 suppresses Aldh1a2 and Aldh1a3 in adipose tissue. Androgens can stimulate
  Aldh1a3 expression. Aldh1a3 expression is elevated in the visceral fat of ovariectomized
  mice. Hypothetical feed-forward pathway for Aldh1a1 regulation in females (green
  line). SREBP-1c can up-regulate Aldh1a1 and Aldh1a2 in animals fed a high-fat diet.
  However, in females E2 can suppress Aldh1a2. RA produced by ALDH1A1 can activate
  the RAR/RXR transcriptional complex, which in turn activates SREBP-1c. C/EBPβ and
  mucin1 can regulate Aldh1a1 in breast cancer cells. RA production can stimulate
  adipogenesis through ZFP423 and PPARγ. In multiple myeloma B cell lines, RA suppresses
  oncogenes (Hoxa10 and Ap1) through ZFP423 and PPARγ activation. Rald suppresses
  adipogenesis through inhibition of RXR and PPARγ. Rald, retinaldehyde; ALDH1A1,
  retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1; ALDH1A2, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase
  1 family, member A2; ALDH1A3, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A3; SREBP-1c,
  sterol regulatory binding protein 1; C/EBPβ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta;
  RA, retinoic acid; ZFP423, zinc finger protein 423; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma; RXR, retinoid X receptor.
