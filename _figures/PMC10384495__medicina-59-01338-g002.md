    Molecular pathway changes in obesity, including increased insulin levels and development
    of insulin resistance, inducing the synthesis of insulin growth factors I and

    and cytokines and expression of leptin receptor LEPR and adiponectin receptor

    by transcription faction sterol regulated element binding protein-2 (SERP-2, SERP-1).
    Downstream activation of molecular changes such as Janus kinase/signal transducer
