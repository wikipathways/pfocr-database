caption: 'The pathogenesis of liver cancer. The occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma
  is related to the abnormal activation of multiple signaling pathways. When there
  is a wnt signal, abnormalities in the AXIN gene can inhibit β-catenin degradation,
  accumulating in the cytoplasm and entering the nucleus to bind with T-cell factor
  family proteins, enhancing downstream gene transcription. In the presence of hedgehog
  (Hh) ligands, the binding of Hh ligand to patched (Ptch)-1 can lead to the endocytosis
  of Ptch-1, thereby relieving the inhibition of smoothened (Smo). The accumulation
  and activation of Smo lead to the dissociation of suppressor of fused and GLI, forming
  GLI activators that promote the expression of target genes. Notch protein is cleaved
  by furin like proteins and expressed on the cell surface in the form of heterodimers.
  After binding with ligands, it is cleaved by proteases, and then cleaved by γ-secretase
  complex in the transmembrane region. At this time, the activated molecule notch
  intracellular domain enters the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target
  genes. Hh: Hedgehog; Smo: Smoothened; TCF/LEF: Transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor'
