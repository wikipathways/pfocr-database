caption: 'Cartoon summarizing the role of HSPB5 in breast cancer pathology. The overexpression
  of HSPB5 appears to involve the proto-oncogene Ets1, a member of the ETS transcription
  factors that bind to DNA at palindromic ETS-binding site (EBS) (position −441/−431)
  in the human αB-crystallin (HSPB5) promoter. The up-regulation of HSPB5 regulates
  negatively the apoptotic process through a direct interaction with Bcl-2 family
  members such as CASPASE-3, Bax, and Bcl-Xs, as well as the constitutive activation
  of Akt and raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Simultaneously, HSPB5 overexpression enhances tumour
  angiogenesis by protecting VEGF from intracellular degradation. Finally, the nuclear
  stabilization of the mutant p53 and the activation of raf/MEK/ERK pathway induce
  cell migration and invasion through EGF and anchorage-independent growth. The numbers
  indicate the location of transcription binding sites relative to the transcription
  start site. TATA indicates the TATA box. HSE and SOX are cis-regulation elements.
