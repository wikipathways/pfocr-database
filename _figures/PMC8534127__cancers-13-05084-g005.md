caption: 'Signaling pathways downstream of IKZF1 and IKZF3 in response to lenalidomide.
  Blue rectangles represent 5q genes. Grey rectangles represent diploid genes. Dashed
  rectangles represent protein degradation. Dashed circles represent dead cells. Yellow
  circles represent phosphorylation (Pi). Green circles represent ubiquitination (Ub).
  Yellow square represents lenalidomide (LEN). Purple square represents Cyclosporin-A
  (Cys). (A) Lenalidomide executes immunomodulation through CRL4CRBN-dependent and
  -independent mechanism. Cereblon (CRBN), damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1), cullin
  4a (CUL4A) and regulator of cullins 1 (ROC1) form the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase
  complex. T cell receptor (TCR) and coreceptor serve as the “first” signal to activate
  various signaling pathway, such as calcineurin (CaN)/nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT), and finally activate T cells. Lenalidomide could directly phosphorylate
  CD28, serving as co-stimulator (i.e., “second” signal) that activates T cell response
  (i.e., CRL4CRBN-independent mechanism). Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) and Cyclosporin-A
  (Cys) inhibits the activity of calcineurin and T cell response. In the presence
  of lenalidomide, the CRL4CRBN complex mediates the degradation of IKZF1/3, leading
  to increased expression of interleukin 2 (IL-2) that activates T cell response (i.e.,
  CRL4CRBN-dependent mechanism). Ag/MHC: antigen and major histocompatibility complex.
  (B) Lenalidomide mediates anti-myeloma effect through depleting the IKZF1/3-IRF4
  pro-survival pathway. In the presence of lenalidomide, the CRL4CRBN complex mediates
  the degradation of IKZF1/3, leading to reduction of interferon regulatory factor
  4 (IRF4) and the resultant apoptosis of multiple myeloma (MM) cells. (C) Lenalidomide
  mediates anti-leukemia effect through activating the calpain 1 (CAPN1) pro-apoptotic
  pathway and/or inhibiting the CaN pro-survival pathway. In the presence of lenalidomide,
  the CRL4CRBN complex mediates the degradation of IKZF1, leading to increased expression
  of G protein-coupled receptor 68 (GPR68) that elevates intracellular calcium levels
  ([Ca2+]i) and activates calpain 1 pro-apoptotic pathway in del(5q) MDS cells when
  the physiological calpain 1 inhibitor calpastatin (CAST), a 5q gene, is expressed
  at lower levels. Meanwhile, degradation of IKZF1 leads to increased expression of
  RCAN1 that inhibits the CaN pro-survival pathway in MDS/AML. Cyclosporin-A (Cys)
  enhances the anti-leukemia effect of lenalidomide through inhibiting CaN.'
