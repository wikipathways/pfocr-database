caption: Schematic representation showing the interaction between foot-and-mouth disease
  virus (FMDV) viral proteins and host proteins in the innate immune system. FMDV
  invades into host cells through integrin receptors, the viral cytosolic RNAs and
  endosomal RNAs are recognized by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) [retinoic acid-inducible
  gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5] and Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) (TLR3 and TLR7/8), triggering a signaling cascade, and inducing
  the production of interferons (IFNs) and cytokines to initiate direct or indirect
  antiviral responses. RIG-I and MDA-5 expose their CARD domains and then interact
  with the CARD of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), while TLR3 and
  TLR7/8 interact with TRIF and MyD88, respectively. The recruited molecules TANK
  and TRAF3/6 subsequently activate different pathways through recruiting the IKK-α/β
  or TBK1/IKK-ϵ. IKK-α/β activates IκBα by phosphorylating it, and the phosphorylated
  IκBα is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasomes, allowing the release of p50/p65.
  The released p50/p65 translocates to the nucleus and binds to the specific gene
  promoters, initiating the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines. TBK1
  phosphorylates IRF3 or IRF7, and induces the IRF3-IRF3 or IRF3-IRF7 dimerization.
  The IRF3-IRF3 or IRF3-IRF7 dimers transport to the nucleus, then bind to the IFNs
  promoters and initiate IFNs secretion. The synthesized IFNs bind to their specific
  receptors on the cell surface, activating TYK2 and JAK1 to induce STAT1/2 forming
  the phosphorylated heterodimers, which then interact with IRF9 and serves as a transcription
  factor complex (also known as ISGF3). The ISGF3 enters the nucleus and induces the
  expression of ISGs. Multiple virulence factors of FMDV target the components of
  the host innate immune system, thereby inhibiting the host antiviral responses.
  Lpro, as a multifunctional protein, cleaves LGP2, acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme
  (DUB) to inhibit the ubiquitination of RIG-I, TRAF3/6, and TBK1, decreases the accumulation
  of p65, and hinders IRF3/7 phosphorylation. 3Cpro, as an important virulent factor
  as well, cleaves NEMO, inhibits the binding of STAT1/2 to IRF9, induces the degradation
  of PKR through the lysosomal pathway. 3A interacts with DDX56 to inhibit the phosphorylation
  of IRF3. VP1 interacts with sorcin, activating STAT3 to inhibit IκBα phosphorylation.
  VP3 inhibits the expression of MAVS, and interacts with JAK1 to inhibit STAT1/2
  phosphorylation and dimerization. In contrast, several host restriction factors
  also interact with the components in the pathways to enhance host antiviral response
  and suppress FMDV replication. Sec62 interacts with MAVS and TRAF3 to stabilize
  their status. EGR1 and ESD promote the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3, respectively,
  to enhance type I IFN production and IFN response.

  description: Schematic representation showing the interaction between foot-and-mouth
    disease virus (FMDV) viral proteins and host proteins in the innate immune system.
    FMDV invades into host cells through integrin receptors, the viral cytosolic RNAs
    and endosomal RNAs are recognized by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) [retinoic acid-inducible
    gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5] and Toll-like

    TANK and TRAF3/6 subsequently activate different pathways through recruiting the
    IKK-α/β or TBK1/IKK-ϵ. IKK-α/β activates IκBα by phosphorylating it, and the phosphorylated

    TBK1 phosphorylates IRF3 or IRF7, and induces the IRF3-IRF3 or IRF3-IRF7 dimerization.
    The IRF3-IRF3 or IRF3-IRF7 dimers transport to the nucleus, then bind to the IFNs
