caption: After its synthesis, dihydrosphingosine is N-acylated by one of 6 ceramide
  synthase enzymes, each of which have distinct acyl-CoA preference. This produces
  an array of ceramides bearing different N-acyl chains; in mammals, C14-C26:1 are
  detected, though C16:0 and C24:1 tend to be the most abundant. The complex sphingolipids
  are the most abundant cell sphingolipids; ceramides are second most abundant. Production
  of sphingosine-1-phosphate is tightly regulated, and thus, its abundance is extremely
  low except under conditions that stimulate its production. Note that almost each
  step is reversible; much data show that perturbing one enzyme leads to perturbations
  and/or compensations in other parts of the pathway. Therefore, biology arising from
  overexpression or inhibition of one enzyme may not always be directly attributable
  to that enzyme (see text). For the purpose of simplicity, some species of low abundance,
  and steps not thought to be regulated are not shown. Molecular structures courtesy
