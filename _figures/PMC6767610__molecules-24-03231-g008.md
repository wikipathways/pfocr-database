caption: Model of Nrf2 signaling cascade. Cyanate may reduce the release of Nrf2 into
  the nucleus by inhibiting the uncoupling of the Nrf2-Keap1 complex, thus the expression
  of antioxidant enzymes (including HO-1) and a series of detoxifying substances are
  reduced, resulting in excessive release of ROS. Further impairs mitochondrial damage
  and abnormal energy metabolism. This results in a decrease in the level of p-AMPK
  and activation of the mTOR pathway, causing lipid deposition to further damage the
  liver. More importantly, these signaling pathways play a key role in oxidative stress
  and inhibition of lipid accumulation.
