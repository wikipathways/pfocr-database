caption: Schematic that illustrates the hypothesis of how the interferon tau (IFN-τ)
  acts on positive HPV 16 tumor cells. IFNτ binds to the receptor of the type I interferon
  family (rIFNs) and activates the JAK-STAT pathway in the tumoral cells which stimulates
  STAT1, STAT2 and resuts in the activation of the caconical pathway. However, other
  proteins that are involved in cell signaling corresponding to a non-canonical pathway
  are also detected. MAPK, MEK1, MEK2, Raf1, STAT3, STA4, STAT5 and STAT6 were observed,
  indicating the activation of other no-classical pathway HPV 16 tumor cells. These
  events may result in the induction of the expression of genes responding to type
  I interferon and to interferon-activated sites associated with the effects of antiviral,
  immunoregulatory, antiproliferative and apoptosis effects in tumor cells. IFNAR,
  Interferon-α/β receptor; STAT, Signal transducers and activators of transcription1,
  ISRE, Interferon-sensitive response element; GAS, Interferon-activated site; STAT1,
  Signal transducers and activators of transcription 1. IP10, Interferon-inducible
  protein 10; MX, myxovirus resistance protein; MHCI, Major histocompatibility complex;
