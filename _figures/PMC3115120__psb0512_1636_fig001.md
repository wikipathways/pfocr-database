caption: Hypothetical model for the potential function of NO, H2O2 and ethylene as
  signaling molecules in AP induction under salt stress in Arabidopsis. Salt stress
  activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the increased activity of
  AOX, whose expression leads to enhanced AP activity. NO is generated by NOS, H2O2
  is likely generated by PM NADPH oxidase attributed to NO, and ethylene emission
  is stimulated by ACS attributed to H2O2. The AP activity is regulated by ethylene
  directly under salt stress.
