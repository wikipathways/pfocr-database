caption: 'Alternative pathway of complement activation: feedback loop and regulation
  by cofactor activity. A, Four plasma proteins, C3, factor B (FB), factor D (FD),
  and properdin (P) assemble into the AP C3 convertase. C3 convertase has a continuous
  activity that generates a basal level of C3b. C3b engages the zymogen Factor B (FB)
  that is then cleaved by the serine protease Factor D (FD) to generate Bb and Ba.
  Bb remains bound to C3b while Ba is liberated (not shown). C3bBb is an active, albeit
  transient, AP enzyme complex that cleaves C3 to form C3a and C3b. C3a is a small
  peptide anaphylatoxin when released. C3b covalently binds to a nearby target (T)
  surface forming an ester linkage. Properdin binds to and stabilizes the C3bBb complex,
  increasing the half‐life 5‐ to 10fold. Thus, the cleavage of C3 to C3b may result
  in a potent positive feedback amplification loop. The AP C5 convertase (C3b)2 BbP
  (not shown) cleaves C5 to C5a and C5b. C5a is a potent anaphylatoxin. C5b binds
  C6 and C7 and C5b,6,7 complex attaches to a membrane. The binding of C8 followed
  by multiple C9s then completes the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC),
  which has the capacity to perturb cellular membranes including generating pores
  to lyse cells. B, Crry mediates membrane cofactor activity in the mouse. After Crry
  binds to C3b, then Factor I (FI), a plasma serine protease, can now cleave C3b to
  iC3b. iC3b has no hemolytic potential because it does not engage FB to initiate
  the feedback loop. Crry has intrinsic complement regulatory activity in that it
  primarily acts on the same cell on which it is expressed'
