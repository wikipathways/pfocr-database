caption: Cardiotoxicity of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. JAK inhibitors can interfere
  with growth hormone and leptin pathways in adipocytes, causing dysregulation of
  lipolysis, metabolism, and blood pressure homeostasis. In adipocytes, JAK/signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, mainly through STAT5,
  is involved in regulation of lipolysis, glucose and lipid metabolism, response to
  insulin stimulation, and regulation of blood pressure. Inhibition of JAK/STAT in
  adipocytes can contribute to metabolic changes leading to weight gain and arterial
  hypertension development.
