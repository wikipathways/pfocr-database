caption: Potential mechanism of alterations in the TSPO-mediated mitophagic signaling
  pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bipolar disorder. Downregulated in
  PBMCs from BD. Upregulated in PBMCs from BD patients. Mitochondrial ROS induced
  by an increase in the TSPO:VDAC ratio leads to the activation of protein kinase-Cε
  (PKCε) through the Raf-1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway, thus promoting the gene expression
  of TSPO via c-Jun, activator protein 1 (AP-1), E-twenty-six oncogene homolog (ETS),
  and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3). Moreover, TSPO,
  via VDAC, triggers an ROS-mediated inhibition of mitophagy, limiting PARK2-dependent
  ubiquitination and P62/SQTM1 recruitment. Consequently, spontaneous inflammasome
  activation can be induced by ROS-mediated inhibition of mitophagy. Furthermore,
  VDAC could lead to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
