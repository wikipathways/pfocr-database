caption: The role for the MAPK p38 signaling pathway in cellular response to 5-FU.
  There is a critical role for the MAPK p38-signaling pathway in the cellular response
  to 5-FU by controlling the balance between apoptosis and autophagy (adapted from
  ref. ). This pathway is tightly controlled by the TP53-mediated regulation of autophagy.
