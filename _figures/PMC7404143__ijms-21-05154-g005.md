caption: Roles of NRP2 in SMC phenotypic switching. NRP2 expression is upregulated
  in SMCs in response to injury [,] and pro-inflammatory stimuli [,] via Smad3 transcription
  factor binding to the NRP2 promoter []. NRP2 expression is linked to VSMC transdifferentiation
  [,]. Evidence suggests NRP2 positively regulates PDGFbb-induced VSMC migration and
  proliferation []. NRP2 is linked to loss of the contractile phenotype via promoting
  activation of the RhoA/ROCK signalling pathway [,,]. TSS; transcriptional start
  site, UTR; untranslated region.
