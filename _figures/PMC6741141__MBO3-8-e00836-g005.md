caption: Metabolic pathway of aerial and submerged mycelia in the liquid surface culture
  of Cordyceps militaris. The expression of genes was significantly upregulated in
  the submerged mycelia and downregulated in the aerial mycelia. The glycolytic pathway
  was upregulated by the increasing activity of hexokinase (HK) to convert glucose
  to D‐glucose‐6P, followed by the activities of glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GAPDH) and phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), which further enter the fermentation
  pathway, shown by the increasing activities of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and
  alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Since the hypoxic condition was created in the submerged
  mycelia, the activities of some enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were
  downregulated with the exception of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme. As
  a consequence, NADPH served as an energy carrier instead of ATP via the fermentation
  pathway and the activation of glucose‐6‐phosphate‐1‐dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase (PGD) enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The PPP also
  plays a major role in providing the nucleotides for biosynthesis, as well as in
  cordycepin biosynthesis. Interestingly, under hypoxic conditions, this fungus also
  activated the heme biosynthetic pathway by upregulating the expression of 5‐aminolevulinic
  acid synthase (ALAS), delta‐aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), coproporhyrinogen
  III oxidase (CPO), and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) enzymes, sequentially. However,
  the hypoxic condition is strongly related to the oxidative stress due to the production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This fungus develops its defense mechanism by
  activating the expression of the peroxide family enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPX)
  to reduce glutathione, which corresponds with the PPP biosynthesis using NADPH as
  a hydrogen donor and finally produces glutathione as an antioxidant using glutathione
  S‐transferase (GST) as a catalyst
