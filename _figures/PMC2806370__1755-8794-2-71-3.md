caption: Pathway deregulation in ovarian cancer. Individual signaling pathways hypothesized
  to be deregulated in the oncogenic transformation of ovarian surface epithelia (OSE)
  into ovarian cancer epithelia (CEPI). An individual OSE is represented on the left
  with individual pathways (as discussed in the text) labeled adjacent to their respective
  section of each cell. An individual CEPI with the same signaling pathways is represented
  on the right as a mirror image of the OSE cell. The legend describes the colored
  boxes and lines used to represent expression differences and potential interactions
  among genes. The juxtapositional placement of the two cell halves is meant to emphasize
  the dichotomous state of signaling between the OSE and CEPI as revealed by our gene
  expression microarrays.
papertitle: Gene expression profiling supports the hypothesis that human ovarian surface
  epithelia are multipotent and capable of serving as ovarian cancer initiating cells.
