caption: Insulin crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) via a carrier facilitated process
  to activate insulin receptors in the CNS and stimulate similar signaling cascades
  as has been described in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipose
  tissue. These insulin signaling cascades diverge following autophosphorylation of
  the β subunits of the insulin receptor and include the MEK/Erk pathway and the PI3/Akt
  pathway. Dysregulation of these pathways may occur at several sites (shown as Stop
  signs) and in doing so contribute to the development of hippocampal insulin resistance,
  including impaired BBB transport of insulin, decreased expression and/or activity
  of the insulin receptor, as well as modulation of the phosphorylation state of insulin
  receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. Decreased insulin-stimulated phosphorylation
  of Akt will also impact several downstream components of insulin signaling, including
  the trafficking of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 and the activity
  of GSK-3β, which regulates the phosphorylation state of the microtubule associated
  protein Tau and the activity of FOX01 family of transcription factors. Figure adapted
  from [].
