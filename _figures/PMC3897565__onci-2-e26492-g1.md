caption: 'Figure 1. Impact of diacylglycerol kinases on the antineoplastic activity
  of CAR-expressing T cells. (A) Obstacles for CAR-expressing T cells in tumor microenvironment.
  The tumor microenvironment is inhibitory for T cells and CAR-expressing T cells.
  At least in part, this results from: (1) the immunosuppressive effects of various
  tumor-infiltrating cells, (2) the inhibitory effects of tumor-derived soluble factors,
  (3) metabolic challenges, and (4) a microenvironment characterized by hypoxia and
  low pH. (B) DGKs are central inhibitors of TCR-mediated RAS/ERK signaling in functionally
  impaired T cells. Prolonged TCR signaling upregulates the expression of cell-intrinsic
  immunosuppressive factors such as diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) and cbl-b. In functionally
  impaired T cells, high levels of DGKs mediate the phosphorylation of the second
  messenger diacylglycerol (DAG), blunting the activation of the RAS/ERK/AP-1 signaling
  pathway.'
