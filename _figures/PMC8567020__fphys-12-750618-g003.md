caption: Regulation of BK channels by AT1R signaling and caveolae compartmentalization.
  In DM, AT1R expression, and caveolae formation are upregulated in vascular SMCs.
  Upon Ang II activation, AT1R translocates to caveolae, where G-proteins, BK-α, NOX-1,
  and c-Src are colocalized. In caveolae, AT1R interacts with Gαq to activate PKC
  and NOX-1 through IP3/DAG signaling pathway, leading to an increase of ROS production.
  Meanwhile, the Gαi and β-arrestin complex induces c-Src activation. As a result
  of AT1R activation, BK-α protein oxidation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and tyrosine
  nitration are enhanced. In addition, AKT phosphorylates FOXO-3a, which in turn suppresses
  FOXO-3a nuclear translocation and reduces its transcriptional activities. With high
  glucose, increased ROS production inhibits AKT function, which promotes FOXO-3a
  nuclear translocation and facilitates Cav-1 expression. Since BK-β1 is not present
  in the caveolae, an increase in BK-α compartmentalization in caveolae may lead to
  physical uncoupling between BK-α and BK-β1 in vascular SMCs. The symbols “n,” “o,”
  and “p” represent protein nitration, oxidation, and phosphorylation, respectively.
