caption: 'Molecular mechanism for neurogenesis activated by 5-HT4 receptors by MOS.
  Main intracellular pathways activated by proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase
  receptor Ret (RET) are shown. MOS activates a 5-HT4 receptor (SR4), G protein coupled
  receptor (GPCR). This GPCR possibly does transactivation of RET. RET activation
  results in phosphorylation of several residues, including Y1015 and Y1062. Growth
  factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ) are required
  for proliferation and/or differentiation of enteric nervous system (ENS) precursors.
  RAC, RHO and CDC42 regulate enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDCs) migration
  and proliferation. Kinesin-like protein KIF26A (KIF26A), Sprouty2 (SPRY2) and phosphatase
  and tensin homolog (PTEN) are negative regulators of RET signalling: KIF26A binds
  to GRB2 and prevents RAS-ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3 K) signalling, whereas
  SPRY2 binds to RAS and RAF and blocks activation of the RAS-ERK pathway. PTEN regulates
  proliferation via PI3 K and Akt. Retinoic acid (RA) reduces PTEN levels in migrating
  ENCDCs and hence blocks the inhibitory effect of PTEN on RET signalling. Two circled
  pathways supposed to be more important than others. This figure was reproduced and
