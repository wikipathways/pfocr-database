caption: A schematic model of the signal pathway of phot1- and phot2-dependent increase
  in [Ca2+]c in leaves of A. thaliana. phot1 and phot2 in the PM could mediate Ca2+
  influx through a Ca2+ channel in the PM. phot2 alone induces CICR from internal
  Ca2+ stores through PLC-mediated signaling. In WT leaves, phot1 possibly increases
  the phot2-dependent PLC pathway and suppresses phot2-dependent Ca2+ influx from
  the apoplast. We describe the possibility in Discussion. See text for details.
