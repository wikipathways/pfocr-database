caption: 'Schematic summary of two distinct signaling pathways involved in the induction
  of cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload: (1) The calcineurin-NFAT
  pathway is activated by Gq-coupled receptors in response to neurohumoral stimulation,
  not only by AngII but possibly also by endothelin and by catecholamines (acting
  on alpha-adrenergic receptors); (2) Mechanical loading, such as transverse aortic
  constriction (TAC), does not activate the systemic renin-angiotensin system but
  induces hypertrophy mediated by CaMKII-HDAC4-MEF2 signaling that does not require
  Gq-coupled receptor activation, but is presumably activated by calcium entry controlled
  by mechano-sensitive channels. Differences in the mode of intracellular calcium
  elevation in response to different stimuli (mechanical versus neuro-humoral) may
  account for the differential activation of calcineurin versus CaMKII, but CaMKII
  also directly inhibits activation of calcineurin, as indicated by the broken red
  inhibitory path (see section “Discussion”).'
