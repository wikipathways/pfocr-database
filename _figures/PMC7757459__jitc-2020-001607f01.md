caption: Schematic overview of the study. (A) Work flow showing that kinase activity
  was measured in baseline PBMC samples using a peptide microarray system consisting
  of identical arrays, each containing 144 unique protein tyrosine kinase phosphorylation
  sites. PBMC samples were isolated from blood collected before onset of ICI therapy.
  The kinase activity profile was analyzed using BioNavigator (PamGene), Coral tool
  (courtesy Cell Signaling Technologies) to annotate kinases onto a phylogenetic tree
  and ingenuity pathway analysis software (Qiagen) to perform gene set enrichment
  analysis. (B) Flow chart of the patient selection process. ICI, immune checkpoint
  inhibitor; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear
  cells; PD-1, programmed cell death 1
